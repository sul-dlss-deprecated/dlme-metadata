(c) The basis of His Majesty’s Government’s present treaty relationship with Koweit was unsatisfactory. In the first place, it did not rest, as was the case with Bahrein, Muscat and the Trucial Sheikhdoms, on a long series of formal treaties with the Sheikh dating back for over a century, or, as in the case of Qatar, on a comprehensive treaty, but was based only on a comparatively brief correspondence exchanged between the sheikhs and His Majesty’s Government since 1899 and on the reciprocal engagements, still presumably binding since they had not been abrogated, entered into in connexion with the lease of Bunder Shweikh in 1907; secondly, there were certain gaps, e.g., we had no slavery agreement with Koweit. It might, he suggested, be possible to fill in the gaps left by this correspondence and tighten our control in that way. An example was our recent request to the Sheikh for certain undertakings in regard to air facilities in his sheikhdom, one result of which would be to concentrate effective control of such facilities, whether military or civil, in the hands of His Majesty’s Government. Another instance was the recent proposed amendment of the Koweit Order in Council so as to place responsibility for jurisdiction over non-Moslem foreigners in the hands of His Majesty’s Government. A gradual tightening of our control of this character, particularly if pursued as a definite policy on all convenient occasions, would, he thought, at once avoid the difficulties involved in establishing a formal protectorate and would make it very much simpler. Colonel Fowle expressed the view that there did not seem to be any inter mediate position possible between a treaty relationship with the Sheikh on the present lines and a full protectorate. The Sheikh would certainly be unwilling to agree to the sheikhdom becoming a formal protectorate, and, prima facie, he (Colonel Fowle) was not much in favour of it. He agreed, however, that it would be advisable, on suitable opportunities, to try to tighten up our control over the Sheikh. _ ... On being questioned whether he did not consider that our restricted position vis-a-vis of the Sheikh in regard to the Koweit oil concession indicated the essential weakness of our treaty position, he replied that our difficulties in that case had been due rather to the special undertakings given to the United States Government in that matter than to any weakness in our normal control over the Sheikh under the treaty engagements. Had we been able, without violating our pledges to the United States Government, to tell the Sheikh that we required him to give the concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company he would have done so. Mr. Rendel drew attention to the fact that in the event of serious misgovern- ment by the Ruler of Koweit such as prejudicially to affect foreign citizens m Koweit, we might find ourselves in a difficult position vis-d-vis of the foieign Power concerned. Mr. Laithivaite said that on this point he thought that Bahrein might be regarded as locus classicus. We had for many years put up with a considerable degree of misgovernment by Sheikh Isa. But when conditions at last, m our view, became intolerable, we did not hesitate to intervene and to depose the Sheikh. There were obvious arguments for doing so, for were we not to intervene when misgovernment had reached a certain pitch, it would be dimcuit tor us to justify a refusal to allow foreign Governments which might be anected to take steps to protect the interests of their nationals. He did not think that there need be any apprehension in the case of Koweit that we would fail to bring pressure on a sheikh who was abusing his position, once it became necessary to do so. The case for early intervention would probably be stronger now that the Gulf was so much more in the public eye. The meeting then went on to consider- relations between Ibn Sand and Koweit. [935 1—1] B 2Sir Andrew Ryan stated that he had been impressed by the apparent weakness of His Majesty’s Government’s position of Ibn Sand with regard to Koweit His Majesty’s Government were not strongly placed when it became neSssary to warn Ibn sLd to keep his hands off Koweit since they were committed to maintaining that Koweit was technically an independent State. A case in point had been the Saudi intrusions into Koweit territory referred to in paragraph 3 of his note, when Saudi officials had performed acts of authority within the limits of the sheikhdom. Colonel Fowls pointed out that, in fact, our treaty engagements did entitle us to prevent foreign Powers from dealing direct with the Snei - . Saud had certainly been informed of the special relations existing between the Sheikh and His Maiesty’s Government. Speaking generally, he added that, m fact, little trouble was likely to be experienced with foreigners m Koweit, so long as it remained a Bedouin town ruled by a Bedouin sheikh, and not, like Bahrein, a relatively cosmopolitan commercial centre. If, however, oil were discovered within the sheikhdom, it was possible that difficulties might arise. Mr. Rendel pointed out that the Arabian air route was likely to develop quickly. If Iraq were to adopt an anti-foreign policy, and Koweit became correspondingly more important as a centre of international traffic, other countries might well wish to take advantage of the facilities there. We might well find many foreign Powers becoming increasingly interested in Koweit. We could not have it both ways, and should sooner or later have to define our position. His Majesty’s Government ought, therefore, to orient their policy definitely either towards the greater independence of the sheikhdom or towards a tightening of their own control. Mr. Laithwaite agreed, and added that, in his view, our policy should be directed towards a closer control, but that it was undesirable to hasten any overt declaration of full control, such as the establishment of a protectorate would be. Such a declaration might well frighten the Sheikhs of Bahrein and of the Trucial Coast, and do more harm than good. The policy to be followed was, therefore, one of occasional minor adjustments, as these became necessary, tending to increase, or at any rate not to relax, our control over the sheikhdom. Reverting to the question of Saudi-Koweiti relations, Sir Andrew Ryan drew attention to the toleration extended by His Majesty’s Government to direct correspondence on business matters between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud. This, no less than the independence formula, placed us in a weak position in defending Koweit, and the correspondence in question was of such long standing that it was difficult now for us to take the line that Ibn Saud should write to us rather than to the Sheikh. What was desirable was that we should be able to tell Ibn Saud openly that we were responsible for defending the Sheikh’s interests in any given dispute. Mr. Laithwaite said that the explanation of the system of direct correspon dence between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud was, he thought, that it dated from a time when the latter was not so important a ruler as he had since become, and when we had taken the view that it was unnecessary to take too strict a view of correspondence between sheikh and sheikh. That position was now changed, and reconsideration seemed desirable. Ibn Saud was well aware both that His Majesty’s Government conducted the foreign relations of Koweit and that the Sheikh had undertaken certain obligations towards us. He agreed that it was now necessary to exert stricter control over the correspondence in question and to emphasise our own special position in Koweit vis-d-vis of Ibn Saud more definitely than had been the case while Iraq was still under British control. He suggested that we might (a) check Ibn Saud when he appeared to be presuming too far with regard to Koweit—a policy which we were, in fact, now prepared to follow in regard to the Saudi-Koweit blockade; and (b) enforce stricter regulations on the Sheikh in the matter of direct correspondence. Colonel Fowle agreed. Such action would show both the Sheikh and Ibn Saud that we considered the Sheikh to be under our direction. If we did not take some such step as this, we might be in danger of finding ourselves faced with the results of a kind of conspiracy between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud. We ought, therefore, to write to th~ Sheikh in the sense that we noted that his privatecorrespondence with Ibn Sand had assumed an increasing importance, and tell ' 1 him that that correspondence must now cease. Mr. Rendel concurred. A straightforward control of this nature would be M easier to maintain, and would prevent a repetition of such incidents as the letter ^ ^ in which Ibn Saud had recently tried to detach the Sheikh of Koweit from his connexion with His Majesty’s Government. Sir A. Ryan also concurred, and drew attention to the success with which y - Ibn Saud was spreading the idea that he might naturally absorb Koweit and was bound to do so sooner or later. He pointed out that such an idea could never have prevailed to the extent to which it had, if His Majesty’s Government had * [equally definitely made known their own special position with regard to Koweit. The meeting then discussed what point in the correspondence between the ! Sheikh and Ibn Saud could most suitably be taken up in connexion with the reprimand which it was proposed to address to both parties. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that if it were discovered that the Sheikh had committed himself to Ibn Saud in regard to the grant of an oil concession in the Koweit Neutral Zone, this might be an excellent opportunity for checking him. The question then arose, what action could be taken if the United States Government, in dealing with whom His Majesty’s Government had consistently emphasised the Sheikh’s independence, were to produce communications from him regarding the grant of a concession in the Neutral Zone? It was, however, agreed that His Majesty’s Government could demonstrate from the Sheikh’s treaty engagements that he had not been entitled to make any such grant without our knowledge and consent. Eventually it was agreed that the most suitable occasion for the proposed representations to the Sheikh and Ibn Saud would be Ibn Saud’s letter suggesting terms for the settlement of the Saudi blockade of Koweit and warning the Sheikh against His Majesty’s Government. At the conclusion of the meeting Sir A. Ryan raised the question of the pressure which might be exerted upon Ibn Saud in regard to the Saudi blockade of Koweit. This blockade had one of two purposes, either to complete the economic strangulation of Koweit and lead to its complete absorption in Saudi Arabia, or else the safeguarding of Saudi economic interests. His Majesty’s Government could not possibly allow the first of these alternatives. The question, therefore, was what real force there was in Ibn Saud s suggestion that his own purely economic interests required the maintenance oi the blockade. Colonel Fowle suggested that we might well revert to the Sheikh’s proposal that Ibn Saud should have customs posts at a given place along but outside the Koweiti border, and that this might, if necessary, be coupled with a system ot manifests for Koweiti-Saudi trade. He gave it as his opinion that even it Ibn Saud were to develop Ras Tanura, possibly with American help this port was not likely to compete seriously with Koweit, which served quite a dinerent nm ei land, nor was there any port between the Koweit area and the Ras lanura area which could be successfully developed as a rival to Koweit. ^ ^ , Colonel Fowle suggested that on his return to the Gulf on the 16th October he should discuss the situation with Colonel Hickson, Political Agen , » who had s&lt;reat experience of the sheikhdom, in the light of the conversations at the present meeting, and should submit a comprehensive report It was agreed that this course should be adopted, and that in the light of the Residen s rep or an of the conclusions of the present meeting the question of future policy m Kowei should be discussed if necessary in the Middle East Official bub-Commi ee. The conclusions of the meeting were as follows : (1) That in dealing with Ibn Saud, His Majesty's Government ^oukl increasingly emphasise the closeness of their relations with the Sheikh (2) That the Sheikh should be told that his personal correspondence with Ibn Saud on official matters was to cease. „„ with (3) That the issue of the Saudi blockade of Koweit should 'l 6 *4 ° Haakon Ibn Saud by His Majesty’s Government on the basis of their obligation to protect the interests of Koweit. itW“ cy sti ; en ir iteii: _ ftbl is, ^ . tenfe' nimli iDdeiEf s ratii6 W That on receipt of the despatch promised by Colonel Fowle the whole Question of relations between His Majesty’s Government and Koweit might suitably be referred for further discussion to the Middle East Official Sub-Committee, to which a note should be sent recording the points discussed at the present meeting, and setting forth the argu ments for and against the possible declaration of a protectorate. Appendix A. Note by Sir Andrew Ryan. Ibn Sand’s Attitude towards Koweit. the embargo on trade, but the embargo on trade has not destroyed the Sheikh’ ostensible friendliness towards Ibn Sand. They are “Arcades ambo,” as I once to r\ 4 -o /d h /-v 1 XT’ ~ IV X ~ * i ? ^ /O/-virz-wniTiPTI {a) felio Aral get te-ti 'Islio anr I h&gt; VE been turnino 1 over in my mind for some time the possibility that it may be a^definite object of Ibn Sand’s policy to reduce Koweit to a position of dependence on him somewhat similar to that of Asir from 1926 to 1930. This is in the nature of a pure speculation, but it is a speculation so interesting that I think it worth while to collect the principal data bearing on it. It must be. admitted at the outset that, if Ibn Sand had such an idea m his head, he would realise the need for great caution lest he should indispose His Majesty s Govern ment. His only formal obligation towards the latter is that contained m article 0 of the Treaty of Jedda, but he understands very well the implications of the words therein “who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment.’’ On the other hand, he has seen His Majesty’s Government tolerate direct correspondence on business subjects between him and the Sheikh of Koweit He might think that they would not react over strongly if he and the Sheikh confronted them with the fait accompli of a political deal. 2. Apart from the correspondence, of which we have knowledge, there has been other intercourse between the rulers, notably the Sheikh’s visit to Riadh in 1932, the secret messages brought by Ibn Sand’s confidential messenger to the Sheikh early this year, and the Sheikh's mysterious dashes intoNejd last February, when Colonel Dickson surmised that he had gone to meet some high baudi personage, possibly Ibn Saud himself. 3 . I may interpolate, as a minor indication of Ibn Sand’s attitude, a reference to two occasions on which it has been suggested or hinted by his Ministry for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty’s Government should not concern themselves with affairs between Saudi Arabia and Koweit. I class them as minor, because this position has never been categorically asserted. The first was when, in reply to a complaint of mine regarding Saudi encroachments on Koweit territory, which had perturbed His Majesty's Government, the reply was in effect: “ Sorry you have been perturbed. You need not have been if the matter had been pursued through An. Nafisi.’’ On another occasion Fuad Bey, in rather light conversa tion, asked me why we concerned ourselves in matters between his Government and Koweit. 4. The personal relations between the two rulers are peculiar. Ibn Saud grew up at Koweit, and it is sometimes said that he has shown himself ungrateful to his former hosts. It is said by others, I do not know on what precise grounds, that Mubarak treated Ibn Saud very badly. Anyhow, through all the relations there runs a thread of old friendship, however flimsy and however frayed by frequent friction over raids, the embargo and so on. It has helped towards the settlement of minor questions. It has not deterred Ibn Saud from enforcing trib froi Em tof (fTki in i a« Coi in. 1 Itisi i not know t i. I WTO rtetical j piithisci pttktl tasjsee Vtalway I®! to k Meveloi wrote, and they both combine some real friendship for His Majesty’s Government and a healthy fear of them with a good deal of fundamental mistrust. 5. The point of my theory or speculation is that, if the Sheikh of Koweit were at all willing to be “ Asirised,” Ibn Saud could make the proposal quite attractive on the following lines, if I may venture to put into his mouth the sort of language he could use :— Y ou are not really independent, my dear fellow. You are under the thumb of the English. They might annex you at any moment, or even present you to Iraq. If you must be dependent on some one, whyi 7 f be dependent on those untrustworthy imperialists, when you might depend, without being exactly dependent, on a man like, me, old friend, fellow Moslem, fellow Arab and the one big independent man in Arabia ? (b) “I don't like squeezing you, I really don’t, with that embargo. As things are at present, I have to think of my own interests. But if your interests were mine, we could easily have an understanding. A sort of ‘ Zollverein' as they say; same duties levied in our ports; free competition between yours and mine; free trade over our land border. What have the English done about it ? Nothing; because they cannot get at me. ‘ Sois mon frere et je te fais vivre. Sois le leur et je te tue.' (c) “I should not mop you up, of course. You would rule your State under an understanding with me. Indeed, if you were in with me, I might recognise a sort of influence of yours over those three Lost Tribes that you always want back. Look at how I treated the Idrisi. I made a sensible agreement with him in 1926. He remained a ruler with tribal influence. I did not take charge in his country, until he got into such a mess that he asked me to in 1930. I did not hit him on the head until the poor mutt thought he could try conclusions with me in 1932. He looked to foreigners and he got it in the neck from me. (d) “You have had trouble wdth Iraq over your property there. What has England been able or even willing to do for you? If I had the right to protect you against third parties, you would find that I knew how to see you through. (e) “ Then there’s oil. People are after it in my country, and in yours, and in the Neutral Zone. Why not have an agreed policy and present a common front to the West? You know what the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is. Another name for the British Government, as we saw in Persia the other day, even if w~e had not known it before. Take my tip and keep them out at all costs. Play about with Holmes, if you like. But don’t trust him, and remember that in the long run your best policy would be to deal, like me, direct with American interests, using the others to put up the price.” [yisl 6 . It is easy enough to detect fallacies in the above imaginary address. I do not know enough about the Sheikh of Koweit to judge what his reaction to jujjg) it would be, but many an Arab, not well pleased with British protectors, might , w | f j L find it convincing enough to be attracted into Ibn Baud’s parlour. ict: hisW 7. I wrote the above notes in Jedda at the end of June. I thought them too hypothetical at that time to submit them for official consideration. They may, however, be worthy of some attention now that the Political Pesident and I are both in this country, and Colonel Dickson will soon be available for consultation. Except that Ibn Saud continues to show a marked anxiety to avoid all compli cations, I see no material reason to modify what I wrote nearly three months ago, subject always to the consideration that I merely suggest an uncertain working theory to be tested by further examination and by keeping a close watch on future developments. August 16, 1933. Appendix B. Note. Obligations of His Majesty’s Government towards the Sheikh of Koweit. (A)— Nature of the Undertakings given. By the agreement of the 23rd January, 1899, His Majesty s Government ire formally assured the Sheikh “ of the good offices of the British Government towards you, your heirs and successors, so long as you, your heirs and successors fC&gt; : (# r )' l) : #! soruoulouslv and faithfully observe the conditions of the said bond, under which the Sheikh Ld-pledged himself, his heirs and successors, not to receive the agent or representative of any Power or Government at Koweit without the previous sanction of the British Government, and not to cede sell, lease or mortgage or give for occupation or for any other purpose, any portion of his territory to the Government or subjects of any other Power without the previous consent of His Majesty g^°™j cle g of the Secret Agreement of the 15th October, 1907, for the lease of the Bunder Shweikh foreshore, the Political Agent intimated that he was “ duly authorised on behalf of the precious Imperial English Government to promise, and do hereby promise, that the town of Koweit and its boundaries likewise belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him, and that all Sheikh Mobarak s arrangements m the matter of customs, &amp;c., and all his arrangements at the present day shall remain in the hands of Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit and of his heirs after him, pu and . . . In consideration of this promise the Sheikh undertook not to levy 0 customs dues in excess of 4 per cent, on goods imported oi expoited by the subjects of the aforesaid English Government,” save with the approval of that ^° Ve 3 . The undertakings given in writing to the Sheikh on the 3rd November, 1914' in return for his co-operation against the Turks, contained an assurance that “ Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.” of St 11 J iQl iftkk 1 is clear This a is rele va - .forint (B) —Construction of the Undertakings given to the Sheikh. 4. As will be seen, the engagements entered into by His Majesty’s Govern ment with the Sheikh are in rather general terms, and it is perhaps desirable briefly to record the construction placed upon them at various times by His Majesty’s Government. 5. ' In 1901, when there was a Turkish threat to Koweit, the Viceroy was informed (Secretary of State’s telegram No. 45 of the 4th December, 1901) that this “appears to constitute a distinct violation of the Sultan’s promise” (to respect the status quo), “ and in these circumstances His Majesty’s Government are prepared to support the Sheikh, and will not tolerate an attack by Turkish troops or ships upon Koweit. The Sheikh should not leave Koweit, and should continue to observe his engagement with us.” The assurance given is clearly limited by the words “ in these circumstances ” to this particular case. More over, it is not conditional on, and is independent of the Sheikh’s observance of his agreement of 1899. 6 . On the 21st March, 1902, Lord Lansdowne, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in a memorandum on the situation in Koweit, remarked that our obligations toward the Sheikh were “ as ill-defined as the boundaries of his principality. We have distinctly announced that he does not enjoy British ‘ protection ’; on the other hand, we once made him a present of £ 1 , 000 , and promised him our £ good offices,’ whatever that may mean. When we made this promise we were, I feel no doubt, thinking of Koweit proper, if there is such a thing, and not of Boobyan or other outskirts over which the Sheikh has rights of one sort or another We might, it seems to me, explain (1) to the Porte; ( 2 ) to the Sheikh; and (3) to the foreign Powers immediately interested the objects of our policy. I should be inclined to say that our engagements to Koweit do not extend beyond the district adjoining or close to the bay of that name, and to endeavour to obtain the adhesion of the Porte and of the Sheikh to our approximate definition of that district ” piioBthatj jikse limit: li. The ilia's views, 'Vis lytheMa is based, far as he his Lords hood of K seen fron incident 1 the limit Lorim’, In this 1 of unpro control, r using th offices ’ i to inter]; with mo &amp;ggte$si( Lordshi] to whitt 1 his mim prestige 7. Later, in 1902, it was reported that Ibn Rashid was making energetic preparation for attacking Ibn Sand, then the Sheikh of Koweit’s friend, and the Sheikh was warned not to take any action likely to bring him into difficulties with either Nejd or Turkey. About the same time the Sheikh informed us that Ibn Sand had with him a gun presented by the Turks, and asked for a gift of two or three guns, which it was understood were wanted for Jehara to protect Koweit against land attack. The Viceroy (telegram No. 39 of the 3rd October, 1902) proposed to reply that the Sheikh ; s request could not be granted, “but that, provided he complied with the injunction conveved to him in pursuance of your telegram of the 4th December, 1901 (see paragraph 5 above). His Majesty’s 11 Tb icnrred ' these oi 5 ^ pass; % refep sJOli dto Mb Government would charge themselves with the defence of Koweit district.” The Secretary of State, after consultation with the Foreign Office (Foreign Office letter of the 13th October, 1902), replied (telegram No. 133 of the 14th October, 1902) : “I approve your proposed reply about the guns, provided Koweit district is clearly defined as the district adjoining or close to the bay of that name.” This assurance similarly admits of being read as an assurance ad hoc, and it is relevant that when, in April 1911, enquiry was made by the Secretary of State for India of the Government of India whether the definition in question of Koweit territory had been communicated to the Sheikh, they replied that it might be assumed that it had, but that it ‘ c only referred to our pledge to defend him against Ibn Rashid, who was threatening the immediate neighbourhood of Koweit” (telegram of the 6 th April, 1911). 8 . The more specific undertakings embodied in the Bunder Shweikh lease of 1907, and quoted in paragraph 2 above, may be regarded as to some extent committing us in respect of “the town of Koweit and its boundaries.” The phrase “its boundaries” is, however, very vague, and could perhaps most reasonably be construed as applying to the immediate district around Koweit town. Tlie discussions as to our obligations to the Sheikh which took place in 1911, and which are summarised in paragraphs 9 to 12 below, appear to have turned essentially on the undertakings of 1899. 9 . In 1911, in connexion with the Anglo-Turkish negotiations, the question of our obligations was examined in some detail. The Government of India, on being asked, with reference to Lord Lansdowne’s memorandum of 1902, to which reference is made in paragraph 6 above, to “ define the region to which our ^ obligation extends,” and “whether they accepted” general description of boundaries in Persian Gulf Gazetteer, p. 1059, &amp;c., replied: “We are of ' opinion that (1) our obligations extend to the limits of the Sheikh’s territory; M ( 2 ) these limits, to the best of our knowledge, are defined with fair accuracy by Lorimer, especially as regards northern portion. ...” 10. The Secretary of State for India, in the light of the Government of India’s views, wrote as follows to the Foreign Office (the 8 th April, 1911) : “ Viscount Morley is not aware on what grounds the opinion expressed i by the Marquess of Lansdowne in his memorandum of the 21st March, 1902, . is based, but he observes that the language used is very tentative, and, so far as he knows, the subject was never pursued along the lines suggested by his Lordship, except in the case of the attack on the immediate neighbour hood of Koweit threatened by Ibn Rashid in the autumn of 1902. It will be seen from the Government of India’s telegram of the 6 th April that this incident does not affect their opinion that our general obligations extend to the limits of Koweit territory as described in Vol. II, pp. 1059-1061, of Lorimer’s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, copy of which is m your possession. ! In this Lord Morley concurs; that is to say, he thinks that, in the e vent 1 of unprovoked aggression by the Turks or by Arab tribes under Turkish control, upon those limits, His Majesty s Government could not abstain riom using their ‘ good offices ’ in the Sheikh s favour. But the term good offices ’ is a very vague one, which His Majesty s Government are at liberty ieRli to interpret at their discretion, and which they would doubtless interpret with more or less strictness, according to the nature and locality oi the aggression, and all the circumstances of the case. It would, I ? 0 l we ^ er ’ Lordship’s opinion, be very impolitic to attempt, in dealing with the b&gt;hei to whittle down the extent of our obligations, since such a course would hil his mind with suspicions, and could not fail to affect unfavourably our prestige in the Persian Gulf. ...” 11. The Foreign Office replied, on the 9th May, 1911, that Sir E Grey concurred “ in the view of the Government of India, shared by Viscount Morley, that these obligations extend to the whole territory of the Sheikh, as described in the passage of LorimePs Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf o w y l*0f0X*S _ - 12 In August 1911 the Government of India, after consultation with the Political Resident (Sir P. Cox), recommended that His Majesty s Government should communicate to the Turks a copy of the agreement of 1899, with a note that His Majesty’s Government had subsequently informed the Sheikh that so long as he and liis heirs and successors acted up to their obligations under the agreement, we charged ourselves to support them and to protect Koweit against [935 1—1] C10 attack by land or sea. The Secretary of State for Indii^on clo^r consideration, found himself unable to accept this proposal. India Office lettei to the Foreign Office of the 30th October, 1911, remarked “ The telegrams of the 4 th December, 1901, and the 14th October, 1902, on which the Government of India appear to base the obligation to protect Koweit by land and sea, in the Marquess of Crewe s opinion, clearly refer only to the incidents that occasioned them, and cannot be understood to have given any general undertaking. Nor, in view of the tact that it has since been decided that our obligations extend to the wliole of the Sheikh’s territory, as described in Lorimer’s Gazetteer, would it be sate to pledge ourselves to any specific method of defending them. As was pointed out by Lord Morley in this Office letter of the 8 th April last, the term good offices ’ (which by Colonel Meade’s letter of the 23rd January, 1899, we undertook to accord 1 to the Sheikh) is a conveniently vague one, and Lord Crewe is of opinion that it is neither necessary nor safe to go beyond it. The action taken by His Majesty’s Government in 1901-02, when men and guns were landed at Koweit to defend it against unprovoked Turkish aggression, will, moreover, have made it plain to the Porte in what way we are prepared to interpret the term if necessity arises. 1 “ His Lordship would therefore suggest that the formula should run : ‘ As regards No. 1, His Majesty’s Government have informed the Sheikh of Koweit° that, so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obligations under the agreement, His Majesty’s Government undertake to support them and accord them their good offices,’ with, perhaps, the addition that His Majesty’s Government reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion.” The Foreign Office (Foreign Office letter dated the 1 st November, 1911) accepted the proposed redraft and addition, and a communication in this sense was made to Tevfik Pasha in Sir Edward Grey’s letter of the 24th October, 1911. 13. The undertaking given in 1914 that Koweit “ shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection,” may be regarded as importing a degree of responsibility for the protection of the principality as a whole. 14. On the death of Sheikh Mobarak his eldest son was informed, in March 1916, on his accession, by the Viceroy, that, “ so long as you act up to the existing arrangements with the British Government, you may expect the same support as was enjoyed by your father.” A similar assurance was given on Sheikh Jabir’s death in 1917 to his brother and successor, Sheikh Salim, in March 1917. Sheikh Salim’s conduct was unsatisfactory, and it was found necessary to warn him, through the Political Pesident, on the 5th July, 1918, that the assurances (which presumably covered the assurance of the 3rd November, 1914) conveyed to him on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour, and that, should acts “contrary to the interests of His Majesty’s Government unfortunately be committed in future,” he would be held personally responsible. 15. In connexion with the operations against the Ikhwan in 1928, the question of the precise extent of the obligations of His Majesty’s Government for the defence of Koweit wa.s considered in the India Office, when the view was put forward that consideration of our engagements suggested that, on a strict reading, our liability could be confined to the protection of the town of Koweit, and that we are not called upon to protect Koweit territory as a whole.

No definition has been given or attempted of the meaning of ‘ ‘ British protection ’ ’ in this connexion; and, while 'prima facie the Sheikh would apparently be justified in claiming that it represented an assurance of effective protection in respect of the whole of his principality, there is some room for discussion as to its precise implications, and it is noteworthy that no appeal appears to have been made under it either by the present Sheikh or by his predecessors.

Question of Liability for the Protection of Koweit against Aggression from Outside, 1928-29. Akhwan raids on Koweit had taken place in 1924 and 1925, but on an inconsiderable scale. The Akhwan raids on Iraq by Feisal-al-Dawish and the Mutair tribe at the end of 1927 had, however, more important reactions on the principality. At the request of the Sheikh His Majesty’s Government agreed to aerial reconnaissance over his territory; and, with his concurrence, it was later decided to withdraw the restrictions originally imposed by His Majesty’s Government on bombing in pursuit of raiders within Koweit territory. An Akhwan raid was successfully dealt with by Koweit forces at El Riqai on the 27th January, 1928, and whilst retiring into Nejd was pursued and successfully attacked by the Royal Air Force on two following days. A further raid occurred late in February, which was not opposed by ground forces, but was again success fully pursued by the Royal Air Force for two days. In view of the possibility of further serious developments, and of the recognised liability of His Majesty s Government under existing engagements for the £ 1 protection of Koweit (a phrase the exact scope of which is open to argument), further defence measures were now taken. A temporary air base (political objections to a permanent station being regarded as conclusive) was established in Koweit: a flight of aeroplanes and a detachment of armoured cars were despatched to the town for its protection : three vessels of the Persian Gulf Squadron (later reduced to one) were stationed off Koweit itself, and a landing party disembarked and remained on shore until the crisis had passed. All action taken was taken with the concurrence of the Sheikh, who was, in addition, allowed to purchase from the Government of India a small supply of machine guns and Lewis guns. After some discussion His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India agreed that his Excellency might be allowed to purchase armoured motor cars, on the understanding that they would be used only for defence, and would not cross the borders of Koweit in repelling raids save with the concurrence of the Political Agent. The crisis, however, passed off without incident, and the special forces which had been despatched to Koweit were withdrawn during the late spring. For financial reasons the Sheikh abandoned the idea of purchasing armoured cars. 2. On the 15th August, 1928, the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, m order to provide against all eventualities, asked permission to send car or air recon naissances into Koweit territory and to establish a defence air base at Koweit in the event of a raid. The India Office remarked (letter of the 22nd August, 1928) : “ The Secretary of State would see strong objection on political grounds to the use of Koweit territory in connexion with air operations against the Akhwan, by which Kowxfit was not directly or immediately threatened. Having regard, however, to the treaty liability of His Majesty s Government for the protection of Koweit and to the action taken with the consent of the Sheikh in the early part of this year, he would see no objection to the grant of the authority now requested when Koweit was directly or indirectly menaced, on the understanding that the prior consent of the Sheikh was obtained from theResident .... so far as may be practicable, on each specific occasion, and subject to the further restriction that there shall be no question of establishing a 'permanent base in Koweit territory. As the result of considerable further interdepartmental discussion, the Air Officer Commanding was authorised on the 25th September, at his discretion, to carry out occasional reconnaissances over Koweit territory, both by air and car. “ His Majesty s Government are anxious. &gt;' however, that-— ( 1 ) These reconnaissances shall be carried out as infrequently and in as unprovocative a manner as possible, and (2) That the Sheikh shall be given no ground for supposing that responsi bility for the defence of Koweit has been assumed by His Majesty’s Government, or that he himself has been relieved of his obligations in this respect. These considerations should be borne in mind by the Air Officer Commanding in acting under the authority now given him.” (Colonial Office telegram to Bagdad, No. 306, dated the 25th September, 1928.) 3. Approval was subsequently given in view of a threatened Akhwan raid over the border, to the concentration, subject to the approval of the Sheikh, of armoured cars in Koweit ££ for protection of Iraqi tribes for so long a period as one month.” (Colonial Office telegram to Bagdad, No. 76, dated the 23rd February, 1929.) 4. In April 1929 the question of the policy to be adopted by the Sheikh of Koweit in the event of Nejdi tribesmen taking refuge from King Ibn Baud in Koweit territory arose, the air authorities suggested that the Sheikh should be asked to concur in the use, if necessary, of military force, the nature and extent of which should be determined by the Air Officer Commanding. Iraq, for the ( purpose of preventing any such refugees from entering or remaining in any part of Koweit territory. On the 8 th May, 1929, the India Office, in a letter to the Colonial Office, remarked : £ £ Viscount Peel gathers that the attitude of the Sheikh is no longer in question and that he has already promised to endeavour lfh\ to prevent refugees making use of Koweit territory. As regards the question of giving the Sheikh military assistance for this purpose, the Secretary of State remains of his previous opinion that it is undesirable to extend in any way the I * , general liability hitherto accepted by His Majesty’s Government for the defence if 1 of Koweit territory, if this can at all be avoided It would, on the whole, be preferable, if possible, to avoid asking the Sheikh to concur in the use of h military force, but if ... . such a request is still essential, he is prepared to agree |' that the Sheikh should be asked to concur ” The other Departments regarded ; it as essential to make a request in the sense referred to of the Sheikh and the necessary instructions were sent to the High Commissioner on the 11 th May. 5. The view held as regards our liability for protection of Koweit during the operations of 1928-29 is perhaps best stated in the India Office letters of the wnn i ^ u £ ust, 1928, and the 8 th May, 1929, quoted in paragraphs 2 and 4 above. M mie our precise liability for protection was not investigated in any great detail, tne course of action adopted in dealing with threats to Koweit territory appears to have been generally consistent with the construction of our liability 111 P ara g ra P h of Bushire despatch No. 1365-S of the 25th October, 1933.( x ) India Office, February 6 , 1934.

Ohajinal of official correspondence between His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait and His Majesty King Abdul Aziz el Baud. o .A* A, t \ AT a I have the honour to refer you to your telegram No dated the £7th March 1954, and to correspondence ending with His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India’s lette No.P.Z.1B99-34, dated March 9th 1934 and paragraph 3, to your address. 2. As instructed by you I called on His Excellency the Shaikh on 1st April and after discussing several other ordinary matters of business, I quite informally and after asking him to keep what I had to say, a confidence between him and myself, opened 'die question of the channel of tuture official correspondence between himself and Pin Saud now under discussion. [, 3. I of course approached the subject with great tact, and circumsp ec ti on f and employed almost word fbr word the language used b^ you in paragraph 6 of your Confidential Despatch No.1363^8, dated the 25th October 19 35 to His Majesty’s Secretary of State. 4. I ended by saying that Hie Majesty’s Hovernmenr- would be glad to know how His Excellency vie wee thc.ir proposals, which I emphasized were prompted in the fnendliesi spirit possible and solely with a desire to strengthen him in his official relations with Bin Saud who, when it suitedsuited his purpose/apparently found it convoaient to forget that Kuwait was in special treaty relations of protection with His Majesty’s Government etc* 5. I limited my proposals to altemative(2) paragraph 5 of your letter No*156*^-S and omitted any mention of Asir as a parallel* I also make a point of saying that his (the Shaikh’s) purely personal correspondence would be un affected by the arrangement* 6. His ihceellency ’ s reactions were interesting, and entirely followed the line I expected they would (See last sentence of paragraph 5(2) of your despatch referred to ab ov e). 7. His Excellency after listening very attentively and politely to all I had to say, commenced by quietly ask ing me to convey his sincere thanks to His Majesty’s ^ Government for their consideration, and for the obviously good intentions underlying the ir suggestion* He particularly appreciated, he said, the tactful way in which their ideas had been put to him, which proved to him that His Majesty’s Government had studied the Arab proverb ’HJdkhulu fil biyut min abwabiha, lat insulu min al satah” (enter into peoples houses by the main doorwalln, do not attempt to get in over the housetops)* He nevertheless was compelled to tell His Majesty’s Government very definitely and firmly that their suggestion found no favour with him, was dangerous and quite impossible for him to approve of. 8« His Excellency went on to add that His Majesty’s Government must forgive him if he spoke candidly, but he thought their proposal had been made without a proper knowledge of local conditions, or a true appreciation of the politics of Saudi Arabia, while psychological, tribal and family considerations had been overlooked entirely* 9. When 1 asked him to give me something a little more concrete to go on, His Excellency aailingLy said thatthat he could not consider the proposal for the following reasons: (a) 'Ihere was no analogy between the case of ’Iraq and Bin Baud • The former was looked upon by himself and other Arab Rulers in Arabia as a properly consti tuted 'Hakum a V’ or Gov eminent, o ompa rab le to Tur key, Persia or Greece, but that Bin Gaud’s Kingdom was something entirely different, and in the eyes of him self and States like Bahrain, Oman etc. was nothing more than a Bedouin autocracy, except perhaps for the Hejaz where P3in Ssud liked to keep up a semblance of an organized State with so called Ministers (without powerimpress representatives of Foreign Powers^* (b) He (the Shaikh) had certainly requested His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad to be his channel of correspondence with the ’Iraq Govermnent, and would do so if necessary again, where other properly organized A State was concerned, but with Bin Baud matters were as poles apart, and he valued the direct connection too highly to discard it lightly. (c) Bin Baud himself and his family of the A1 Sand were Bedouins at heart and in idea^-like hirself, they and he not only understood each other perfectly, but were of the same stock and family. (d) He, the Shaikh, and his people originally all cam® from Wejd and Qasim, and although they had greatly suffered from, and loathed Bin Baud’s methods and policy, personal relations had always been good and he and most other .i&gt;rab rulers were proud of their Arabian King, who was to them, the champion ofa &lt;tic Islam, and the Defender of the true Faith. There was such a thing as t ’noblesse oblige” also among Arab Rulers. (e) For him as an Arab Ruler to hold direct ofl. icial communications with Bin Baud, was above all a matter of prestige. The Arabian world (which to him countedcounted more than everything) saw in his doing so, the sign patent that Kwait was an independent Arab State, like Yemen, though in closest treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government. (f) ’Iraqis by the very nature of their form of Government would realize the re a sen why he, the Shaikh, wanted no direct communication with them. The people of Arabia proper and his fellow rulers, conversely would look upon Kuwait as having definitely cane under Great Britain^direct control (like a colony,) were he to surrender his right to address Bin Baud by direct official letter. (g) States like Kuwait and Bahrain valued above life their connection with His Majesty’s Government, out it was one thing to have England a friend and ally, who would come to their help in time of need,^quite another thing to be looked upon as a colony of His Majesty’s Government pure and simple. 10. The Shaikh thui angrily enQuired wbat I thought Bin Saud would say, if the proposed arrangement came off. T *He will be overjoyed”, he said, ”and will hold up my first letter under the new arrangement, in open Mejliss, and say ’look oh my people, Kuwait has now been taken over by England Brother iihnad is no longer an Arab Ru3.er In .^rabia. Behuld the first step, the next to go will be Bahrain, and Oman. Did I not tell you not to trust these English, did I not warn Ahmad of this times without number’” How could he ever face Bin Saud or any Bedouin Shaikh after that, said xzis Excellency. 11. I hero calmed the Shaikh down and he continued in quieter mood by asking *y His Majesty’s Government felt distrust, of him, and idiat was wrong with the existing system, whereby he always showed me, his rolitioal and His Majesty's Government's accredited representative, any of fi cl si letter that went from him to Bin Baud , or which came from Bin Saud to him* He/5 - He called God to witness that not a single missive that so passed, and which contained saiy sort of comminioation that counted had ever been hold back by him. In this matter His Majesty’s Government must remember that he was an Arab rrince of noble blood and honour, and so must trust him to play the game* Was it sense to suppose that he, the Shaikh, #10 was weaker tb&amp;n Bin Baud, always on the defensive against the latter’s intrigues and underground attacks, and for ever requiring His Majesty’s Government’s help and assistance, would deliberately put himself out of count by keeping back certain of his correspondence with Bin Saud. Thy, such conduct would place him in Bin Baud’s hands at once, and should be rejected as absurd, by His Majesty’s Government, 12. I hsive suggested that perhaps Bin Saud was not aware that he, the Shaikh, made a practice of shewing all official letters to his Political Agent, and that His Majesty’s Government’s proposal after all anounted to making this plain to Bin Saud. The Shaikh burst out laughingly at this and said, ^Believe me, not only does Bin Saud know this very well, but whai I saw him last he twitted me unmercifully about it. He has made many efforts to get me not to do so, clearly in order to weaken me with His Majesty’s Government and spoil my relations with you, Colonel Dickson, but I am too old a bird to be caught and not only has he failed, but he knows he has failed and will fail, hence his much better treatment of Kuwait in the matter of raids etc. since you took over from Colonel More. Bin Saud_J ojay_.knows that I_am carrying out mv grandfather. Shaikh Muba r*y£l^^ p olicy in this matter, which between him and the British —- 13. In conclusion His Excellency begged me to leave well alone both for his sate, and for the sake of good relations between His Majesty’s Government, himself and his people, also for the sake of His Majesty’s Government’s relations with other Arabian Rulers in treaty relations with iwith her, who would be horrified beyond measure if they thought that His Majesty’s Government had possible intentions of acting as ’go between’ where letters with Bin Sand were cone erned. 14o From my experience of the Arab of Arabia proper with whom after all we are dealing in this matter, I am myself definitely of opinion that the best course for us is, as the Shaikh says, to leave well alone* It would be a grave error, I think, at the present momsnt especially, to start hurting the ’pride’ of Shaikh Ahmad, in the matter of his correspondence. After all ’pride’ is all in all to the Bedouin Arab of the stamp and kind of the Shaikh. The present system works well and as you have remarked in one of your despatches to His Majesty’s Government , if we want to tighten up control here, we can do so in other and more palatable ways. 15. In the case of the present Ruler relations with myself^ are, I believe, as near the ideal as possible. There is the closest friendship and cooperation between us, and without wishing to boast, I believe, I can make the Shaikh do most things, if only I am given time , and am allowed to progress in my own way. 16. I apologize fbr the inordinate length of this letter but, as the Shaikh’s remarks apply with equal force to the future question of a regular protectorate over Kuwait I thought it best to give you a full account of his talk with me.

The former was looked upon by himself and other Arab Hulers in Arabia as s properly constituted (, Hakuma rt or Croverwent, comparable to ''urkev, ? ersi a or Oreece, but that Ibn Sand ’s Kingdom was something entirely diffcrertt t and in the eyes of himself and states like Bahrain, Oman, etc. was nothing more than a Bedouin autocracy, except perhaps for the Hedjas whe^e Ibn Baud liked to keep up a semblance of an organized State with so called Ministers (without power) to impress // representatives of foreign Bowers. 4« There may be something in this from the Arab ( point of view, but politically this argument cannot hold water. Ibn Baud himself created a government - o Tit ward ly we at lenst - on western lines, and^ reat it as such, ihe Bhaikh in fact, not for the first time, is trying to have it both ways. He is willing to consider himself under our protection when he is oppressed by Ibn Baud, in the matter of the Blockade for instance, yet at the same time wants unfettered correspondence with the same oppressor. 5. However, I am of opinion that Colonel hfcckson f B approach to the Shaikh, which must be remembered 'as, as suggested in paragraph 6 of my letter already yio+ed, on confidential and informal lines, has done good. It has on the one hand shown us hat the Shaikh’s views are on the matter, and on the other has doubtless impressed on the latter/3- latter that *e refmrd the queetior of his co r res port derice Xunait Oil ne^otiatiops are in progress I an of opinion that this question of correspondence had better not be pursued for the present. ^ think however that at an appropriate moment something mipht be done on the lines surested in mra^rraph 4 of 31 r Andren Cyan’s ^espatch Ho.84 of f?9th March 1934 to the ? oreirm Office. Would it not be practicable to intiuate to Tbn Baud and the Bhatkh that official letters from Thn Baud to the Bhaikh nou3d to be shown to the British Minister, and letters from the Bhaikh to Ibn Baud would have to be shown to the Political Affeut. ^irther that any letter not so shewn not be invoked against either His Majesty’s (&gt;ov!?rpment. impressing on Tbn Baud our npecial relate ors with vuwait. and protecting the interests of His MaJeety*s Government, mipht at the seme time tend to ruffle the susceptibilities of both poterta 4, es less than the sonewhat ha'n! and fast the two Bulers.

British Legation J edda• 29th March 1934 Sir / I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your printed despatch No. 81(E 775/739/91) of February ?7, in which you call for my observations on the subject of th nclosed to the Foreign Off ic e No. P.Z.7683/33 of February 1 and Foreign Office letter to the India Office No.775/739/91 of Febrjiatjty. (e) Possible declaration of a protectorate over Kuwait. (b) Gaps in the existing agreements between His Majesty’s Government and the Sgaikh of Kuwait. (c) Direct correspondence between the Shaikh and Ibn Saud. (d) Obligations of His Majesty’s Government in regard to (e) Suggested substitution of a formal treaty for the existing agreements between His Majesty’s Government and the Shaikh. 2 . As regards (a) above* it has already been decided not tp pursue at present the question of declaring a protectorate. All that I need say in this connexion, there fore* is that if at any future time it should prove more practicable than it is at present to declare a protectorate, it would greatly clarify the situation as between Kis Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud and would place the former jn a much stronger position vis a vis of the latter. Looked at from correspondence regarding the relations between His Majesty’s Government and the Shaikh of Kuwait, viz., India Office letter 24th These letters deal with the following subjects: Kuwait this/this point of view the policy of His Mrjiesty's Government in regard to Kuwait should in my opinion be considered to some extent in conjunction with the question, which has areas to the east and south-east of Ibn Baud’s dominions. 3. The subjects at (b) , (dj and (e) above are so far outside my province that 1 cannot usefully of£r any observations on them. I propose therefore to confine myself to the question of direct correspondence between the Shaikh of Kuwait and Ibn Saud on official subjects. There is general agreement, I think, as to the desirability of controlling this correspondence and the only question which arises is that of the best means of establishing an effective 4. So far as the practical considerations are concerned, I am inclined to share your view as to the adequacy of the course indicated in paragraph 3 (4} of the Political Resident’s des^ch to the India Office -N0.1365S of be difficult for His Majesty’s Government to disavow communica tions addressed by the Shaikh to ibn Saud without the approval of the Political Agent unless communications which had been approved by him bore some indication of that fact. I may add that this alternative no less than the other would necessitate an undertaking nob only with the Shaikh but with that unapproved communications could not be invoked against either His Majesty’s Government or the Shaikh himself and recently become active, of their policy in regard to the other control, having regard to both practical and legal considerations. October 25. You have yourself pointed out that it would Ibn Saud. It would have to be made clear to the latter that communications addressed by the King on his side to the Shaikh/ /Shaikh must be considered not only by the Shaikh but by the Political Agent. If this position were established the effect would be much the same as that of Colonel Fowle*s second alternative, except for one thing, namely the difficulty of discriminating between official and unofficial communiaatioi s. This difficulty appears to me to be very great in the case of two rulers whose practice appears to be to exchange purely personal letters and to deal with official matters in enclosures appended to them. 5.. The adoption of Colonel Fowle’s second alternative would not obviate the danger of the Shaikh compromising his position by direct letters but it would establish quite definitely the fact that such letters could have no sort of official character. It may perhaps be hoped that both rulers would then realise that their direct correspondence had better be confined to personal greetings and news. It remains to be considered whether the legal position is such as to enable His Majesty^ Government to impose the proposed system firstly on the Shaikh and secondly on Ibn Saud. It is not for me to deal with this question as regards the Shaikh but I submit the following observations as regards Ibn Baud*. 6 . tfhen the Treaty of Jedda was being negotiated His Majesty’s Government wished to include in it a clause similar to Article 6 of the Treaty of December 26, 1915 by which Ibn Saud undertook 'to refrain from all aggression on, or interference with the territories of Kuwait, Bahrain and of the Shaikhs of Q,atar and the Oman coast, who are under the protection of the British Government and who have treaty relations with the said Government'. The use of 'who' inthis clause seems to confine the application of the words ’•under the protection of ' t o t he Shaikhs cf Q,atar, etc* Ibn Saud rejected the clause and His Majesty's Government accepted the substance of a counter^proposal by Ib n Saud, subject to the addition of the words 'who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty's Governmenf. This produced Article 6 of the Treaty fif Jedda as we now have it* The word ’•who” stnnds but was perhaps not intended to be used 1 imitatively• Anyhow His Majesty’s Government hadmade it clear in their instructions to Sir G*Clayton that they attached the same meaning to the form of clause to which they were willing to agree as to the clause they had themselves proposed* 7* After the conclusion of the Treaty of Jedda, His Majesty's Government communicated to Ibn Saud a number of treaties with Arabian rulers.

His Majesty’s Govern ment have also assured the Sheikh that they recognise ( l) that the town of Kuwait and its boundaries belong to him and to his heirs after him; ( 2 ) that all his arrangements shall remain in the hands of himself and his heirs; and (3) that they vail not take customs or anything in any lands they/-5- *they may rent, or in which they may dwell, within the limits of Kuwait, Finally his Majesty’s Government have assured the Shaikh that Kuwait shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection”. the possibility of relations between Ibn Baud and the Shaikh of Kuwait, which were to be friendly and peace ful. This pr esumably need not mean more than that Ibn Saud was to observe e friendly and peaceful attitude and Ibn Saud knows that the Shaikh is not free to receive the agent of any foreign power without British sanction, He are, however, eternally dogged by the contradictory express!on n independent principality under British protection 11 , a definition which we have tried to abandon but which remains on record as between His Majesty’s Government end Ibn Saud. His Majesty’s Governmentwould be on absolutely safe ground in informing Ibn Saud of their own motion that he anas must not correspond with the Sheikh of Kuwait except through British channels. I suggest, therefore, that any communication on the subject to the Saudi Government will be made expressly as the result of an understanding between them and the Shaikh. 10 .

(14377) Relations between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Sheikh of Koweit. [E 6077/16/91] 1 .—Final Record of a Meeting held at the Foreign Office, on October 5, 1933. THE following were present at the meeting :— Mr. G. W. Rendel (in the Chair), Foreign Office. Mr. K. R. Johnstone, Foreign Office. Sir A. Ryan, His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda. Lieutenant-Colonel T. C. Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Mr. J. G. Laithwaite, India Office. The meeting had before it Sir Andrew Ryan's note of the 16th August, regarding the attitude of King Ibn Saud towards Koweit (see Appendix A). Mr. Rendel outlined the present political situation of Koweit. The Sheikh was tied to His Majesty’s Government by his treaty engagements, but at the same time was being courted both by Ibn Saud and by Iraq. It was clear C/at the sheikhdom was not in a position which in the ordinary way would enable it to stand alone either as a political or as an economic entity, and that it must there fore depend on some stronger Power. He understood that it was the policy o± His Majesty’s Government, in view of the strategic importance of Koweit, not to allow it to be absorbed by any foreign Power, but, so far as was possible, to maintain their present treaty relationship with the Sheikh. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that Koweit was at the present moment of more vital importance to His Majesty’s Government than it had been at any time, since it had bulked so prominently as the terminus of the Bagdad Railway before the war. This was the result first of the development of the air route to India and Australia, which had made the Gulf as important imperially from the air stand point as was the Suez Canal for naval reasons, and, secondly, owing o le ’ tion of the mandatory regime in Iraq and the uncertainty of the future ^elat o of His Majesty’s Government with that country. So long as Iraq had been undei British control, there had been a natural tendency to give it prior consideration and the less important question of Koweit had been kept comparatively m the background. But now that Iraq had attained full independence, the position was changed and Koweit had once again assumed major importance Gwgraphmally^ Koweit occupied a key position at the head of the Persian Gulf, and one tio which the Gulf could be controlled. In the event of war we could probab y safe j assume that Koweit would be on our side and her territory would afford us a base of operations of definite value, to the use of which, on the assumpGon m quest , no objection could be raised on the ground that we were vl f a ^ n S ^ Further, with the development of the Arabian coast air route to the East Koweit was likely to prove more and more vital as a station on that rout^especial y relations with Iraq should at any time become so strained that we were unable to rely on the use of the Iraqi aerodromes for the purposes of that route. Colonel Fowle suggested that in point of fact it inight one ^y be possible to avoid the use of Iraq altogether, and fly direct from a es me , range of the aircraft using the Arabian.route increase . Mr. Rendel concurred with Mr. Laithwaite's 'fif.[1 ^/’our'whole regards Iraq. In view of recent events m Iraq it w P considered that relationship with that country might have to be modified aud both the future of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty and of the P°' °“f at iJ S u e he Force in Iraq must be regarded as doubtful. On ie g P 7329 [9823] Bobserved that one of the main points to be borne in mind was me fact that Koweit was not naturally independent from either the geographical or the economic point of view. It was a port without a hinterland, cut off at present by the Iraqi and Saudi frontiers from the territory which it would naturally teed, and at present denied free communication with the country behind it. Moreover, even its present trade might be jeopardised by the development of the Saudi port at Has Tanura under the auspices of the American oil concessionaires on the Hasa coast. What was even more important was that its fresh-water supplv was not derived from its own territory, but had to be imported from Iraq. It was for consideration, therefore, whether it would, in fact, be practicable for His Majesty’s Government to maintain the independence of Koweit as against its neighbours, at any rate on the present basis of a rather loose and ill-defined dependence on His Majesty’s Government. Colonel Fowle concurred generally in Mr. Rendel’s description of the economic position of the sheikhdom. He pointed out, however, that Koweit hao always been the port of the deserts of northern Arabia, as Bahrein was the port of Central Arabia. In regard to the position of Koweit vis-a-vis of Iraq, he added that beside the influence which Iraq could exert by controlling Koweit’s fresh water supply, it was also powerful enough to bring pressure to bear upon Koweit over, for instance, the question of smuggling. Mr. Rend el agreed that both Iraq and Saudi Arabia were in a position to exert strong pressure on Koweit. This being so, the rivalry between them over Koweit was likely to increase, unless, of course, Saudi Arabia disintegrated. The present position of Koweit between these two States was weak, and Sir Andrew Ryan’s note showed how powerful an attraction Ibn Saud could exert. The question, therefore, was whether His Majesty’s Government would not be well advised to develop and tighten up their own relations with Koweit in order to strengthen its position. It had, in fact, been suggested that it might be more advantageous to convert our present treaty relationship into a definite protectorate, on, for instance, the analogy of the Hadramaut, which was now regarded as part of the Aden Protectorate, but where our treaty relationship with the local rulers and obligations to afford them protection had been if anything looser than those we had towards Koweit. Would not a protectorate ensure Koweit more effectively against absorption than the present attempt to maintain the sheikhdom as a kind of political vacuum in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Laithwaite drew attention to three points :— (a) At present the obligations of His Majesty’s Government to Koweit were represented by their undertaking to grant “ good offices ” in respect of Koweit under the 1899 agreement, by their promise of 1907 that “the town of Koweit and its boundaries belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him,” and their undertaking of the 3rd November, 1914, that Koweit, in the event of a victory over the Turks, would be recognised by us as an independent princi pality under British protection. They were thus very general in terms, and, in accordance with our normal policy on the Arab littoral, which dated from a period in which it was possible to protect a sea port by action from the sea, but not to afford effective help inland, we had consistently endeavoured to limit our obligations, save as regards “good offices ' to Koweit town and the immediately adjoining area. Recent experience had, however, shown that in cases of intervention from outside it was in fact necessary to give the Sheikh, at our discretion, and on our own terms, a measure of active assistance up to the limit of his frontiers and with the development of aircraft the problem of inland defence was now less difficult. This was to some extent a strengthening of his strict treaty position, as also possibly an extension of our strict treaty obligations. {b) With regard to the suggested establishment of a protectorate, it was necessary to consider what the reactions of the Sheikh would be, and also what effect the proclamation of a protectorate might have on the other Arab rulers of the Gulf. It would in any case be wiser not to make an overt proclamation of this nature, since both in Bahrein and m Qatar and along the Trucial Coast it would probably rouseapprehensions and might even cause the local sheikhs to turn away from His Majesty’s Government and consider submitting themselves to Persia or to Ibn Saud. (c) The basis of His Majesty’s Government’s present treaty relationship with Koweit was unsatisfactory. In the first place, it did not rest, as was the case with Bahrein, Muscat and the Trucial Sheikhdoms^ on a long series of formal treaties with the Sheikh dating back for over a century, or, as in the case of Qatar, on a comprehensive treaty, but was based only on a comparatively brief correspondence exchanged between the sheikhs and His Majesty’s Government since 1899 and on the reciprocal engagements, still presumably binding since they had not been abrogated, entered into in connexion with the lease of Bunder Shweikh in 1907; secondly, there were certain gaps, e.g., we had no slavery agreement with Koweit. It might, he suggested, be possible to fill in the gaps left by this correspondence and tighten our control in that way. An example was our recent request to the Sheikh for certain undertakings in regard to air facilities in his sheikhdom, one result of which would be to concentrate effective control of such facilities, whether military or civil, in the hands of His Majesty’s Government. Another instance was the recent proposed amendment of the Koweit Order in Council so as to place responsibility for jurisdiction over non-Moslem foreigners in the hands of His Majesty’s Government. A gradual tightening of our control of this character, particularly if pursued as a definite policy on all convenient occasions, would, he thought, at once avoid the difficulties involved in establishing a formal protectorate and would make it very much simpler. Colonel Fowle expressed the view that there did not seem to be any inter mediate position possible between a treaty relationship with the Sheikh on the present lines and a full protectorate. The Sheikh would certainly be unwilling to agree to the sheikhdom becoming a formal protectorate, and, prima facie, he (Colonel Fowle) was not much in favour of it. He agreed, however, that it would be advisable, on suitable opportunities, to try to tighten up our control over the Sheikh. _ . On being questioned whether he did not consider that our restricted position vis-a-vis of the Sheikh in regard to the Kov/eit oil concession indicated the essential weakness of our treaty position, he replied that our difficulties in that case had been due rather to the special undertakings given to the United States Government in that matter than to any weakness in our normal control over the Sheikh under the treaty engagements. Had we been able, without violating our pledges to the United States Government, to tell the Sheikh that we required him to give the concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company he would have done so. Mr. Rendel drew attention to the fact that in the event of serious misgovern- ment by the Ruler of Koweit such as prejudicially to affect foreign citizens m Koweit, we might find ourselves in a difficult position vis-a-vis of the foieign Power concerned. Mr. Laithwaite said that on this point he thought that Bahrein migh e regarded as locus classicus. We had for many years put up with a considerable degree of misgovernment by Sheikh Isa. But when conditions at last, m our view, became intolerable, we did not hesitate to intervene and to depose e Sheikh. There were obvious arguments for doing so, for were we not to intervene when misgovernment had reached a certain pitch, it would be n^st di cu or as to justify a refusal to allow foreign Governments which might be affected to take steps to protect the interests of their nationals. He did not think that there need be any apprehension in the case of Koweit that we would fail to bring pressure on a sheikh who was abusing his position once it became necessary o do so. The case for early intervention would probably be stronger now that the Gulf was so much more in the public eye. The meeting then went on to consider relations between Ibn Saud and Koweit. [9823] B 2Sir A redrew Ryan stated that he had been impressed by the apparent weakness of His Majesty’s Government’s position vis-d-vis of Ibn Sand with regard to Koweit. His Majesty’s Government were not strongly placed when it became necessary to warn Ibn Sand to keep his hands off Koweit, since they were committed to maintaining that Koweit was technically an independent State. A case in point had been the Saudi intrusions into Koweit territory, referred to in paragraph 3 of his note, when Saudi officials had performed acts of authority within the limits of the sheikhdom. #r:; ( : iP* 1 I lb ^ I .kK)® 31 rirf Sir^ Colonel Fowle pointed out that, in fact, our treaty engagements did entitle us to prevent foreign Powers from dealing direct with the Sheikh. Ibn Sand had certainly been informed of the special relations existing between the Sheikh and His Majesty’s Government. Speaking generally, he added that, in fact, little trouble was likely to be experienced with foreigners in Koweit, so long as it remained a Bedouin town ruled by a Bedouin sheikh, and not, like Bahrein, a relatively cosmopolitan commercial centre. If, however, oil were discovered within the sheikhdom, it was possible that difficulties might arise. Mr. Rendel pointed out that the Arabian air route was likely to develop quickly. If Iraq were to adopt an anti-foreign policy, and Koweit became correspondmgly more important as a centre of international traffic, other countries might well wish to take advantage of the facilities there. We might well find many foreign Powers becoming increasingly interested in Koweit. We could not have it both ways, and should sooner or later have to define our position. His Majesty’s Government ought, therefore, to orient their policy definitely either towards the greater independence of the sheikhdom or towards a tightening of their own control. Mr. Laithwaite agreed, and added that, in his view, our policy should be directed towards a closer control, but that it was undesirable to hasten any overt declaration of full control, such as the establishment of a protectorate would be. Such a declaration might well frighten the Sheikhs of Bahrein and of the Trucial Coast, and do more harm than good. The policy to be followed was, therefore, one of occasional minor adjustments, as these became necessary, tending to increase, or at any rate not to relax, our control over the sheikhdom. If.

Reverting to the question of Saudi-Koweiti relations, Sir Andrew Ryan drew attention to the toleration extended by His Majesty’s Government to direct correspondence on business matters between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud. This, no less than the independence formula, placed us in a weak position in defending Koweit, and the correspondence in question was of such long standing that it was difficult now for us to take the line that Ibn Saud should write to us rather than to the Sheikh. What was desirable was that we should be able to tell Ibn Saud openly that we were responsible for defending the Sheikh’s interests in any given dispute. Mr. Laithwaite said that the explanation of the system of direct correspon dence between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud was, he thought, that it dated from a time when the latter was not so important a ruler as he had since become, and when we had taken the view that it was unnecessary to take too strict a view of correspondence between sheikh and sheikh. That position was now changed, and reconsideration seemed desirable. Ibn Saud was well aware both that His Majesty s Government conducted the foreign relations of Koweit and that the Sheikh had undertaken certain obligations towards us. He agreed that it was now necessary to exert stricter control over the correspondence in question and o emphasise oui own special position in Koweit vis-d-vis of Ibn Saud more definitely than had been the case while Iraq was still under British control. He suggested that we might («) check Ibn Saud when he appeared to be presuming oo ai with regard to Koweit a policy which we were, in fact, now prepared to follow m regard to the Saudi-Koweit blockade; and (b) enforce stricter regulations on the Sheikh m the matter of direct correspondence. agreed Such action would show both the Sheikh and Ibn Saud that we considered the Sheikh to be under our direction. If we did not he^dt^nf n ffP/ s , thlS ’ we mi gJ 1 t be in danger of finding ourselves faced with thereW tn ^ betw f n the Sheik h and Ibn Saud. We ought, e efore, to write to the sheikh in the sense that we noted that his private ' micst j iiia, or iferamen ; Wore, i y idy ecoi Coloiu I iatlkS keiti tx ^ mifests : In Saudi I i likely t fj lit, non y icleoul5 ) correspondence with ibn Sand had assumed an increasing importance, and tell him that that correspondence must now cease. Mr. Rendel concurred. A straightforward control of this nature would be easier to maintain, and would prevent a repetition of such incidents as the letter in which Ibn Baud had recently tried to detach the Sheikh of Koweit from his connexion with His Majesty’s Government. Sir A . Ryan also concurred, and drew attention to the success with which Ibn Saud was spreading the idea that he might naturally absorb Koweit and was bound to do so sooner or later. He pointed out that such an idea could never have prevailed to the extent to which it had, if His Majesty’s Government had equally definitely made known their own special position with regard to Koweit. The meeting then discussed what point in the correspondence between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud could most suitably be taken up in connexion with the reprimand which it was proposed to address to both parties. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that if it were discovered that the Sheikh had committed himself to Ibn Saud in regard to the grant of an oil concession in the Koweit Neutral Zone, this might be an excellent opportunity for checking him. The question then arose, what action could be taken if the United States Government, in dealing with wdiom His Majesty’s Government had consistently emphasised the Sheikh’s independence, were to produce communications from him regarding the grant of a concession in the Neutral Zone ? It was, however, agreed that His Majesty’s Government could demonstrate from the Sheikh’s treaty engagements that he had not been entitled to make any such grant without our knowledge and consent. Eventually it was agreed that the^most suitable occasion for the proposed representations to the Sheikh and Ibn Saud would be Ibn Baud’s letter suggesting terms for the settlement of the Saudi blockade of Koweit and warning the Sheikh against His Majesty’s Government. At the conclusion of the meeting Sir A. Ryan raised the question of the pressure which might be exerted upon Ibn Saud in regard to the Saudi blockade of Koweit. This blockade had one of two purposes, either to complete the economic strangulation of Koweit and lead to its complete absorption in Sau i Arabia or else the safeguarding of Saudi economic interests. His Majesty s Government could not possibly allow the first of these alternatives. The question, therefore, was what real force there was in Ibn Sand’s suggestion that his own purely economic interests required the maintenance of the blockade. Colonel Fowle suggested that we might well revert to the Sheikh s PT0P 0S fl that Ibn Saud should have customs posts at a given place along but outside the Koweiti border, and that this might, if necessary, be coupled with a system of manifests for Koweiti-Saudi trade. He gave it as his opinion that eve Ibn Saud were to develop Ras Tanura, possibly with American help this port was not likely to compete seriously with Koweit, which served ^t® ^ 1 %®'^ hm e a land, nor was there any port between the Koweit area and the Ras Tanu a which could be successfully developed as a rival to Koweit October Colonel Fowle suggested that on his return to the Gulf on the Ibth October he should discuss the situation with Colonel ^ichsoo. Poh^ical Agent^^ °wei^ who had great experience of the sheikhdom, m the ig agreed that present meeting, and should submit a comprehensive le P ? eDort an( j this course should be adopted, and that in the light of * r f P ^ ei t of the conclusions of the present meeting the question of future PubcJ “ K° welt should be discussed if necessary in the Middle East Official Sub-Corn The conclusions of the meeting were as follows : (1) That in dealing with Ibn Saud, His Majestyh Government should (1) increasinglv fmphasise the closeness of their relations with the Sheikh That the Slfeikh should be told that his personal correspondence with Ibn Saud on official matters was to cease^^ be ^ up with ri ibn SaudbyHis Majesty’s Government on the basis of their obligation to protect the interests of Koweit. ( 2 ) (3) Sr(4) That on receipt of the despatch promised by Colonel Fowle the whole question of relations between His Majesty’s Government and Koweit might suitably be referred for further discussion to the Middle East Official Sub-Committee, to which a note should be sent recording the points discussed at the present meeting, and setting forth the argu ments for and against the possible declaration of a protectorate. Appendix A. Note by Sir Andrew Ryan. Ibn Sand's Attitude towards Koweit. I HAVE been turning over in my mind for some time the possibility that it may be a definite object of Ibn Sand's policy to reduce Koweit to a position of dependence on him somewhat similar to that of Asir from 1926 to 1930. This is in the nature of a pure speculation, but it is a speculation so interesting that I think it worth while to collect the principal data bearing on it. It must be admitted at the outset that, if Ibn Saud had such an idea in his head, he would realise the need for great caution lest he should indispose His Majesty’s Govern ment. His only formal obligation towards the latter is that contained in article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, but he understands very well the implications of the words therein “who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment.” On the other hand, he has seen His Majesty’s Government tolerate direct correspondence on business subjects between him and the Sheikh of Koweit. He might think that they would not react over strongly if he and the Sheikh confronted them with the fait accompli of a political deal. 2. Apart from the correspondence, of which we have knowledge, there has been other intercourse between the rulers, notably the Sheikh’s visit to Biadh in 1932, the secret messages brought by Ibn Saud's confidential messenger to the Sheikh early this year, and the Sheikh’s mysterious dashes intoNejd last February, when Colonel Dickson surmised that he had gone to meet some high Saudi personage, possibly Ibn Saud himself. 3. I may interpolate, as a minor indication of Ibn Saud’s attitude, a reference to two occasions on which it has been suggested or hinted by his Ministry for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty’s Government should not concern themselves with affairs between Saudi Arabia and Koweit. I class them as minor, because this position has never been categorically asserted. The first was when, in reply to a complaint of mine regarding Saudi encroachments on Koweit territory, which had perturbed His Majesty’s Government, the reply was in effect: “Sorry you have been perturbed. You need not have been if the matter had been pursued through An. Nafisi.” On another occasion Fuad Bey, in rather light conversa tion, asked me why we concerned ourselves in matters between his Government and Koweit. 4. The personal relations between the two rulers are peculiar. Ibn Saud grew up at Koweit, and it is sometimes said that he has shown himself ungrateful to his former hosts. It is said by others, I do not know on what precise grounds, that Mubarak treated Ibn Saud very badly. Anyhow, through all the relations there runs a thread of old friendship, however flimsy and however frayed by frequent friction over raids, the embargo and so on. It has helped towards the settlement of minor questions. It has not deterred Ibn Saud from enforcing the embargo on trade, but the embargo on trade has not destroyed the Sheikh s ostensible friendliness towards Ibn Saud. They are “Arcades ambo,” as I once wrote, and they both combine some real friendship for His Majesty’s Government and a healthy fear of them with a good deal of fundamental mistrust. 5. The point of my theory or speculation is that, if the Sheikh of Koweit were at all willing to be “ Asirised.’ Ibn Saud could make the proposal quite attractive on tne following lines, if I may venture to put into his mouth the sort of language he could use :— (a) \ou are not really independent, my dear fellow 7 . You are under the thumb of the English. They might annex you at any moment, or even present you to Iraq. If you must be dependent on some one, why■■■ Ma be dependent on those untrustworthy imperialists, when you might depend, without being exactly dependent, on a man like me, old friend, fellow Moslem, fellow Arab and the one big independent man in Arabia ? (b) “I don’t like squeezing you, I really don’t, with that embargo. As things are at present, I have to think of my own interests. But if your interests were mine, we could easily have an understanding. A sort of ‘ Zollverein ’ as they say; same duties levied in our ports; free competition between yours and mine; free trade over our land border. What have the English done about it ? Nothing; because they cannot get at me. ‘ Sois mon frere et je te fais vivre. Sois le leur et je te tue.’ (c) “I should not mop you up, of course. You would rule your State under an understanding with me. Indeed, if you were in with me, I might recognise a sort of influence of yours over those three Lost Tribes that you always want back. Look at how I treated the Idrisi. I made a sensible agreement with him in 1926. He remained a ruler with tribal influence. I did not take charge in his country, until he got into such a mess that he asked me to in 1930. I did not hit him on the head until the poor mutt thought he could try conclusions with me in 1932. He looked to foreigners and he got it in the neck from me. (d) “You have had trouble with Iraq over your property there. What has England been able or even willing to do for you ? If I had the right to protect you against third parties, you would find that / knew how to see you through. (e) ‘ ‘ Then there’s oil. People are after it in my country, and in yours, and in the Neutral Zone. Why not have an agreed policy and present a common front to the West? You know what the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is. Another name for the British Government, as we saw in Persia the other day, even if we had not known it before. Take my tip and keep them out at all costs. Play about with Holmes, if you like. But don’t trust him, and remember that in the long run your best policy would be to deal, like me, direct with American interests, using the others to put up the price.” 6. It is easy enough to detect fallacies in the above imaginary address. I do not know enough about the Sheikh of Koweit to judge what his reaction to it would be, but many an Arab, not well pleased with British protectors, might find it convincing enough to be attracted into Ibn Baud’s parlour. 7. I wrote the above notes in Jedda at the end of June. I thought them too hypothetical at that time to submit them for official consideration. They may, however, be worthy of some attention now that the Political Resident and I are both in this country, and Colonel Dickson will soon be available for consultation. Except that Ibn Baud continues to show a marked anxiety to avoid all compli cations, I see no material reason to modify what I wrote nearly three months ago, subject always to the consideration that I merely suggest an uncertain working theory to be tested by further examination and by keeping a close watch on future developments. August 16, 1933. Appendix B. Note. Obligations of His Majesty’s Government towards the Sheikh of Koweit. (K)—Nature of the Undertakings given. By the agreement of the 23rd January, 1899, His Majesty s Government formally assured the Sheikh “of the good offices of the British Government towards you, your heirs and successors, so long as you, your heirs and successo i8 scrupulously and faithfully observe the conditions of the said bond, under which the Sheikh had pledged himself, his heirs and successors, not to receive the agent or representative of any Power or Government at Koweit without the previous sanction of the British'Government, and not to cede, sell, lease or mortgage, or give for occupation or for any other purpose, any portion of his territory to the Government or subjects of any other Power without the previous consent of His Maiesty’s Government. „ ^ o , 2. By article 9 of the Secret Agreement of the 15th October, 1907, for the lease of the Bunder Shweikh foreshore, the Political Agent intimated that he was &lt;£ dulv authorised on behalf of the precious Imperial English Government to promise, and do hereby promise, that the town of Koweit and its boundaries likewise belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him, and that all Sheikh Mobarak’s arrangements m the matter of customs &amp;c., and all his arrangements at the present day shall remain in the hands of Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and of his heirs after him, and . . . In consideration of this promise the Sheikh undertook not to levy customs dues in excess of 4 per cent, on goods imported or exported by “the subjects of the aforesaid English Government,” save with the approval of that Government. JIB 3. The undertakings given in writing to the Sheikh on the 3rd November, 1914. in return for his co-operation against the Turks, contained an assurance that “ Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.” (B )—Construction of the Undertakings given to the Sheikh. .fori ISOUP* t Tk [ •f d ess®' Ini 4. As will be seen, the engagements entered into by His Majesty’s Govern ment with the Sheikh are in rather general terms, and it is perhaps desirable briefly to record the construction placed upon them at various times by His Majesty’s Government. 5. In 1901, when there was a Turkish threat to Koweit, the Viceroy was informed (Secretary of State’s telegram No. 45 of the 4th December, 1901) that this “appears to constitute a distinct violation of the Sultan’s promise” (to respect the status quo), “ and in these circumstances His Majesty’s Government are prepared to support the Sheikh, and will not tolerate an attack by Turkish troops or ships upon Koweit. The Sheikh should not leave Koweit, and should continue to observe his engagement with us.” The assurance given is clearly limited by the words ‘ c in these circumstances ’ ’ to this particular case. More over, it is not conditional on, and is independent of the Sheikh’s observance of his agreement of 1899. 6. On the 21st March, 1902, Lord Lansdowne, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in a memorandum on the situation in Koweit, remarked that our obligations toward the Sheikh were “ as ill-defined as the boundaries of his principality. We have distinctly announced that he does not enjoy British ‘ protection ’; on the other hand, we once made him a present of £1,000, and promised him our £ good offices,’ whatever that may mean. When we made this promise we were, I feel no doubt, thinking of Koweit proper, if there is such a thing, and not of Boobyan or other outskirts over which the Sheikh has rights of one sort or another We might, it seems to me, explain (1) to the Porte; (2) to the Sheikh; and (3) to the foreign Powers immediately interested the objects of our policy. I should be inclined to say that our engagements to Koweit do not extend beyond the district adjoining or close to the bay of that name, and to endeavour to obtain the adhesion of the Porte and of the Sheikh to our approximate definition of that district ” 7. Later, in 1902, it was reported that Ibn Rashid was making energetic preparation for attacking Ibn Saud, then the Sheikh of Koweit’s friend, and the Sheikh was warned not to take any action likely to bring him into difficulties with either Nejd or Turkey. About the same time the Sheikh informed us that Ibn Saud had with him a gun presented by the Turks, and asked for a gift of two or three guns, which it was understood were wanted for Jehara to protect Koweit against land attack. The Viceroy (telegram No. 39 of the 3rd October, 1902) proposed to reply that the Sheikh’s request could not be granted, &lt;£ but that, provided he complied with the injunction conveyed to him in pursuance of your telegram of the 4th December, 1901 (see paragraph 5 above), His Majesty’s 1 m, esj .

Government woul^ charge themselves with the defence of Koweit district.” The Secretary of State, after consultation with the Foreign Office (Foreign Office letter of the 13th October, 1902), replied (telegram No. 133 of the 14th October, 1902): “I approve your proposed reply about the guns, provided Koweit district is clearly defined as the district adjoining or close to the bay of that name.” This assurance similarly admits of being read as an assurance ad hoc y and it is relevant that when, in April 1911, enquiry was made by the Secretary of State for India of the Government of India whether the definition in question of Koweit territory had been communicated to the Sheikh, they replied that it might be assumed that it had, but that it ‘ ‘ only referred to our pledge to defend him against Ibn Rashid, who was threatening the immediate neighbourhood of Koweit ” (telegram of the 6th April, 1911). 8. The more specific undertakings embodied in the Bunder Shweikh lease of 1907, and quoted in paragraph 2 above, may be regarded as to some extent committing us in respect of “the town of Koweit and its boundaries.” The phrase ‘ ‘ its boundaries ’ ’ is, however, very vague, and could perhaps most reasonably be construed as applying to the immediate district around Koweit town. The discussions as to our obligations to the Sheikh which took place in 1911, and which are summarised in paragraphs 9 to 12 below, appear to have turned essentially on the undertakings of 1899. 9. In 1911, in connexion with the Anglo-Turkish negotiations, the question of our obligations was examined in some detail. The Government of India, on being asked, with reference to Lord Lansdowne’s memorandum of 1902, to which reference is made in paragraph 6 above, to “ define the region to which our obligation extends,” and “whether they accepted” general description of boundaries in Persian Gulf Gazetteer, p. 1059, &amp;c., replied: “We are of opinion that (1) our obligations extend to the limits of the Sheikh’s territory; (2) these limits, to the best of our knowledge, are defined with fair accuracy by Lorimer, especially as regards northern portion. ...” 10. The Secretary of State for India, in the light of the Government of India’s views, wrote as follows to the Foreign Office (the 8th April, 1911) :— “ Viscount Morley is not aware on what grounds the opinion expressed by the Marquess of Lansdowne in his memorandum of the 21st March, 1902, is based, but he observes that the language used is very tentative, and, so far as he knows, the subject was never pursued along the lines suggested by his Lordship, except in the case of the attack on the immediate neighbour hood of Koweit threatened by Ibn Rashid in the autumn of 1902. It will be seen from the Government of India’s telegram of the 6th April that this incident does not affect their opinion that our general obligations extend to the limits of Koweit territory as described in Vol. II, pp. 1059-1061, of Larimer's Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, copy of which is in your possession. In this Lord Morley concurs; that is to say, he thinks that, in the event of unprovoked aggression by the Turks or by Arab tribes under Turkish control, upon those limits, His Majesty’s Government could not abstain from using their i good offices ’ in the Sheikh s favour. But the term good offices ’ is a very vague one, which His Majesty’s Government are at liberty to interpret at their discretion, and which they would doubtless interpret with more or less strictness, according to the nature and locality of the aggression, and all the circumstances of the case. It would, however, in his Lordship’s opinion, be very impolitic to attempt, in dealing with the Sheikh, to whittle down the extent of our obligations, since such a course would fill his mind with suspicions, and could not fail to affect unfavourably oui prestige in the Persian Gulf. ...” 11. The Foreign Office replied, on the 9th May, 1911, that Sir E. Grey concurred “ in the view of the Government of India, shared by Viscount Morley, that these obligations extend to the whole territory of the Sheikh, as described in the passage of Larimer's Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf to which youi tetter refers ? ? 12 . j]Q August 1911 the Government of India, aftei consultation with the Political Resident (Sir P. Cox), recommended that His Majesty’s Government should communicate to the Turks a copy of the agreement of 1899, with a no e that His Majesty’s Government had subsequently informed the Sheikh that, so long as he and his heirs and successors acted up to their obligations undei t e agreement, we charged ourselves to support them and to protect Koweit against [9823] cattack by land or sea. The Secretary of State for India, on closer consideration, found himself unable to accept this proposal. India Omee letter to the Foreign Office of the 30th October, 1911, remarked :— “ The telegrams of the 4th December, 1901, and the 14th October, 1902, on which the Government of India appear to base the obligation to protect Koweit by land and sea, in the Marquess of Crewe’s opinion, clearly refer only to the incidents that occasioned them, and cannot be understood to have given any general undertaking. Nor, in view of the fact that it has since been decided that our obligations extend to the whole of the Sheikh’s territory, as described in Lorimer’s Gazetteer, would it be safe to pledge ourselves to anv specific method of defending them. As was pointed out by Lord Morley in this Office letter of the 8th April last, the term ‘ good offices ’ (which, by Colonel Meade’s letter of the 23rd January, 1899, we undertook to accord to the Sheikh) is a conveniently vague one, and Lord Crewe is of opinion that it is neither necessary nor safe to go beyond it. The action taken by His Majesty’s Government in 1901-02, when men and guns were landed at Koweit to defend it against unprovoked Turkish aggression, will, moreover, have made it plain to the Porte in what way we are prepared to interpret the term if necessity arises. “ His Lordship would therefore suggest that the formula should run: ‘ As regards No. 1, His Majesty’s Government have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that, so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obligations under the agreement, His Majesty’s Government undertake to support them and accord them their good offices,’ with, perhaps, the addition that His Majesty’s Government reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion.” The Foreign Office (Foreign Office letter dated the 1st November, 1911) accepted the proposed redraft and addition, and a communication in this sense was made to Tevfik Pasha in Sir Edward Grey’s letter of the 24th October, 1911. 13. The undertaking given in 1914 that Koweit “ shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection,” may be regarded as importing a degree of responsibility for the protection of the principality as a whole. 14. On the death of Sheikh Mobarak his eldest son was informed, in March 1916, on his accession, by the Viceroy, that, “ so long as you act up to the existing arrangements with the British Government, you may expect the same support as was enjoyed by your father.” A similar assurance was given on Sheikh Jabir’s death in 1917 to his brother and successor, Sheikh Salim, in March 1917. Sheikh Salim s conduct was unsatisfactory, and it was found necessary to warn him, through the Political Resident, on the 5th July, 1918, that the assurances (which presumably covered the assurance of the 3rd November, 1914) conveyed to him on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour, and that, should acts contrary to the interests of His Majesty’s Government unfortunately be committed in future,” he would be held personally responsible. ^J 1 £ onnex i? n with the operations against the Ikhwan in 1928, the question (n the precise extent of the obligations of His Majesty’s Government tor the defence of Koweit was considered in the India Office, when the view was put forward that consideration of our engagements suggested that, on a strict reading, our liability could be confined to the protection of the town of Koweit, and that we axe not called upon to protect Koweit territory as a whole.

We communicated article 9 of the Bunder Shweikh Agreement to Ibn Baud in 1928; and in 1933 the Political Agent, Koweit, and the Political Resident brought to notice the continued existence of the obligations of the Sheikh in regard to customs duties (paragraph 2 above) under article 10 of the agreement); (d) fourthly, that we have undertaken to recognise, and have in fact recognised, Koweit as an independent principality under British protection. No definition has been given or attempted of the meaning of “British protection” in this connexion; and, while prima facie the Sheikh would apparently be justified in claiming that it represented an assurance of effective protection in respect of the whole of his principality, there is some room for discussion as to its precise implications, and it is noteworthy that no appeal appears to have been made under it either by the present Sheikh or by his predecessors. J. G. LAITHWAITE India Office, October 11, 1933. in Mail ecessarr:: 19 5 are® 1 '; assure; ter#| Appendix C. Supplementary Note. Question of Liability for the Protection of Koweit against Aggression from Outside, 1928-29. Akhwan raids on Koweit had taken place in 1924 and 1925, but on an inconsiderable scale. The Akhwan raids on Iraq by Feisal-al-Dawish and the Mutair tribe at the end of 1927 had, however, more important reactions on the principality. At the request of the Sheikh His Majesty’s Government agreed to aerial reconnaissance over his territory; and, with his concurrence, it was later decided to withdraw the restrictions originally imposed by His Majesty s Government on bombing in pursuit of raiders within Koweit territory. An Akhwan raid was successfully dealt with by Koweit forces at El Riqai on the 27th January, 1928, and whilst retiring into Nejd was pursued and successfully attacked by the Royal Air Force on two following days. A further raid occurred late in February, which was not opposed by ground forces, but was again success fully pursued by the Royal Air Force for two days. In view of the possibility of further serious developments, and of the recognised liability of Flis Majesty s Government under existing engagements lor the protection of Koweit (a phrase the exact scope of which is open to argument), further defence measuies were now taken. A temporary air base (political objections to a permanent station being regarded as conclusive) was established in Koweit: a flight of aeroplanes and a detachment of armoured cars were despatcned to the town for its protection : three vessels of the Persian Gulf Squadron plater reduced to one) were stationed off Koweit itself, and a landing party disembarked and remained on shore until the crisis had passed. All action taken was taken with the concurrence of the Sheikh, who was, in addition, allowed to purchase from the Government of India a small supply of machine guns and Lewis After some discussion His Majesty s Government and the Government of India agreed that his Excellency might be allowed to purchase armoured motor cars, on the understanding that they would be used only for defence, and would not cross tho borders of Koweit in repelling raids save with the concurrence of ttie Political Agent. The crisis, however, passed off without incident, and the special forces which had been despatched to Koweit were withdrawn during the late spring. For financial reasons the Sheikh abandoned the idea of purchasing armoure Cai&gt;S 2 On the 15th August, 1928, the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, in order to provide against all eventualities, asked permission to send car or air recon naissances into Koweit territory and to establish a defence air base at Koweit in the event of a raid. The India Office remarked (letter of the 22nd August, 1928): “ The Secretary of State would see strong objection on political grounds to the use of Koweit territory in connexion with air operations against the Akhwan, by which Koweit was not directly or immediately threatened Having regard, however, to the treaty liability of His Majesty s Government for the protection of Koweit and to the action taken with the consent of the in the early part of this year, he would see no objection to the grant of the authority now requested when Koweit was directly or indirectly menaced, on the understanding that the prior consent of the Sheikh was obtained from the [9823] c 212 Resident .... so far as may be practicable, on each specific occasion, and subject to the further restriction that there shall be no question of establishing a 'permanent base in Koweit territory.’ As the result of considerable further interdepartmental discussion, the Air Officer Commanding was authorised on the 25th September, at his discretion, to carry out occasional reconnaissances over Koweit territory, both by air and car. “ His Majesty’s Government are anxious, however, that— (1) These reconnaissances shall be carried out as infrequently and in as unprovocative a manner as possible, and (2) That the Sheikh shall be given no ground for supposing that responsi bility for the defence of Koweit has been assumed by His Majesty’s Government, or that he himself has been relieved of his obligations in this respect. These considerations should be borne in mind by the Air Officer Commanding in acting under the authority now given him.” (Colonial Office telegram to Bagdad, No. 306, dated the 25th September, 1928.) ’irfdi 1 3. Approval was subsequently given in view of a threatened Akhwan raid over the border, to the concentration, subject to the approval of the Sheikh, of armoured cars in Koweit ‘ ‘ for protection of Iraqi tribes for so long a period as one month.” (Colonial Office telegram to Bagdad, No. 76, dated the 23rd February, 1929.) 4. In April 1929 the question of the policy to be adopted by the Sheikh of Koweit in the event of Nejdi tribesmen taking refuge from King Ibn Saud in Koweit territory arose, the air authorities suggested that the Sheikh should be asked to concur in the use, if necessary, of military force, the nature and extent of which should be determined by the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, for the purpose of preventing any such refugees from entering or remaining in any part of Koweit territory. On the 8th May, 1929, the India Office, in a letter to the Colonial Office, remarked : “Viscount Peel gathers that the attitude of the Sheikh is no longer in question and that he has already promised to endeavour to prevent refugees making use of Koweit territory. As regards the question of giving the Sheikh military assistance for this purpose, the Secretary of State remains of his previous opinion that it is undesirable to extend in any way the general liability hitherto accepted by His Majesty’s Government for the defence of Koweit territory, if this can at all be avoided It would, on the whole, be preferable, if possible, to avoid asking the Sheikh to concur in the use of military force, but if ... . such a request is still essential, he is prepared to agree that the Sheikh should be asked to concur ” The other Departments regarded it as essential to make a request in the sense referred to of the Sheikh and the necessary instructions were sent to the High Commissioner on the 11th May. 5. The view held as regards our liability for protection of Koweit during the operations of 1928-29 is perhaps best stated in the India Office letters of the wv-i ^ u ^ us ^’ 1928, and the 8th May, 1929, quoted in paragraphs 2 and 4 above. Wnile our precise liability for protection was not investigated in any great detail, the course of action adopted in dealing with threats to Koweit territory appears to have been generally consistent with the construction of our liability C u 0l0n ?L F ^ le in P ara g ra P h 10 of Bushire despatch No. 1365-S of the 25th October, 1933.( 1 ) r -tf. ^ r j- G.

One of the two questions (the other is dealt with below m paragraphs 7 and 8) discussed at the meeting was, briefly, whether, with a view to iruimtaiiiing our control over Koweit, which was undoubtedly fast increasing in importance as Apolitical and strategical centre in the Middle East, (a it was advisable to declare a British protectorate over that sheikhdom, or (b) whethei sufficien control could not be obtained over it by adopting a policy of tightening up our control over the sheikh as opportunity offered by filling in the gaps which at present existed in our agreements with him.^ .

A third “gap ” is the habit of direct correspondence which has grown up between the sheikh and Ibn Saud, and which was dealt with at some length at the meeting. The outcome of my discussion with Colonel Dickson on this point is as follows : There would appear to be two ways in which we can ensure control over this correspondence : — (1) By informing the sheikh that before despatching any official communi cation to Ibn Saud he should show it to the Political Agent, and should take similar action with communications received from Ibn Saud. This has been the sheikh's custom in the past, at any rate in regard to his outward correspondence; whether he has shown all Ibn Saud’s official letters to Colonel Dickson, we do not, of course, know. After the sheikh had received our communication, which would! of course, be tactfully worded and would merely ask him to continue the practice which he already observed, he would not be able to quote officially any letters which he had not shown to the Political Agent. If, for instance, in order to present His Majesty's Government with a fait accompli on some point agreed upon between Ibn Saud and himself, he should produce a communication which had not been seen by the Political Agent, we could ignore it. Both Colonel Dickson and I think that perhaps it would be better in our communication not to refer to any particular correspondence, but to treat the matter on general grounds. The above refers, of course, to official correspondence; nothing we can do will prevent ‘ £ private and personal ’ ’ letters passing between the two potentates. (2) The second alternative is to insist that official correspondence between the sheikh and Ibn Saud should pass through His Majesty’s Government’s local representatives: the Minister at Jedda, and the Political Agent, Koweit (or, perhaps, the Resident, Persian Gulf). This is already the procedure in force (at the sheikh's own request) in regard to the sheikh’s correspondence with the Iraq Government, and so no new departure in principle would be involved. The advantage of this alternative would be its emphasis' to Ibn Saud of the special ielations that Koweit has with His Majesty’s Government, which emphasis is apparently particularly needed at the present juncture {vide conclusion 1 of the meeting) As against this advantage, Colonel Dickson is of the opinion that the sheikh, who regards Ibn Saud, in spite of the latter’s treatment of Koweit, in a somewhat different light to Iraq, might object more or less strongly to the proposal. D J ol m'nd as neither irthis a; i oar ol A across attitude iited m ling fro 11. In 6 Considermg all the circumstances, I would suggest that I be authorised o instruct Colonel Dickson to approach the sheikh verbally on the following me . s ‘ x'kat hfis Majesty s Government have had it recently brought to their no ice that Ibn Saud apparently harbours designs of trving to reduce Koweit to a position ot dependence on him, similar—for instance—to that of Asir: that it is Possible that the practice of direct correspondence between him—the sheikh- and Ibn baud which has grown up of late, even though he—the sheikh—shows in® c 2 rre ?PT de i lce , t0 /r?

The most important of these obligations, which are dealt with in the India Office note on the subject, and the one which in a sense determines any others there may be, is that of protection against hostile incursions or invasions. His Majesty’s Government’s agreements with the sheikh are three in number : that of January 1899, that of October 1907 and that of November 1914. 8. The agreement of 1899, as far as t£ protection ” is concerned, in return for the good behaviour of the sheikh and his successors, merely promised £C the o-ood offices” of His Majesty’s Government, “whatever that may mean” as Lord Lansdowne later remarked. Our construction of this agreement appears to have been the convenient one that we could choose the circumstances in which we need, or need not, protect Koweit in any particular crisis that arose, the exact area which we were responsible for defending being left more or less vague. 9. The agreement of 1907 merely confirmed from His Majesty’s Govern ment that £ £ the town of Koweit and its boundaries ’ ’ belonged to the sheikh of that day and his successors. This agreement in no way added, in principle, to our nebulous responsibilities for the defence of Koweit, though, possibly, read with that of 1899, it might increase these responsibilities up to the “boundaries.” 10. The 1914 agreement states that, in return for the sheikh’s co-operation against the Turks, ££ Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.” This, unlike the phraseology of the previous agree ments, is a most categorical assurance, and the word £t principality,” and not “town,” being used would seem definitely to place the responsibility of protecting the whole of the Koweit sheikhdom on His Majesty’s Government. Personally, I cannot agree with the view quoted in paragraph 15 of the India Office note that £ £ on a strict reading our liability could be confined to the protection of the town of Koweit, and that we are not called upon to piotect Koweit as a whole.” It is true, as pointed out in the note (paragraph 16 (d )), that neither the present sheikh, nor his predecessors, appear to have appealed under this agreement to His Majesty’s Government, but that hardly relieves us from our obligations. This does not imply, of course, that His Majesty s Government’s obligations relieve the sheikh completely of the responsibility of his own defence. The sheikh should certmnly be nble to deni with nny smnll raids across his frontiers, and should only look for assistance from His Majesty s Government in the case of more serious incursions. This, in fact, was piesumably the attitude taken up after the Akhwan operations of 1928, when the sheikh was encouraged to purchase half a dozen lord vanettes, Lewis guns which were mounted in the vanettes, and ammunition, and when some of his men leceived training from the Royal Air Force as machine gunners. 11 In conclusion, I venture to suggest that this question, the exact extent of the obligations of His Majesty’s Government for the protection of Koweit, be investigated with a view to a definite decision on the subject. The question is an important one, and the advantages of having a clear conception of what our responsibilities may be in time of crisis, before such a crisis arises are obvious^ I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India and His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda.

Oil a cuiaoni reading nf that iettai-, R^m tonot ^ t|lat lbn Salld tn Ryan’s view, it16 is undesirable to say anything to the sheikh in the sense of that clause, as it might conceivably come to the ears of Ibn Saud, whether thiough the sheikh — • t -i-i, rm mir relations with him. Kvan th^rai conceivably come 10 me ears ui v^ vr vr'®^or indirectly, with unfortunate effect on our relations with him. Kyan therefore sug-gests that this sentence should be omitted from the instructions. I send you this simply as a record of Ryan s remarks to me; I gather that he spoke to you in the same sense. Fowle s letter has not yet been considered by my higher authorities. , . ^ ° lours sincerely, KENNETH JOHNSTONE. [impt Jortan i S* [E 775/739/91] n’O I,—India Office to Foreign Office.—(Received February 1.) gj r India Office, February 1, 1934. I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that he has had under his consideration the proceedings of the interdepai tmental meeting held at the Foreign Office on Thursday, the 5th October, 1933, to discuss relations between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Sheikh of Koweit, and also the Political Resident’s despatch of the 25th October, 1933, containing Colonel Fowle’s recommendations on the tentative conclusions of the meeting in question in the light of discussion of them with the Political Agent, Koweit. 2. In the light of Colonel Fowle’s views, Sir Samuel Hoare is definitely of opinion that the question of declaring a protectorate over Koweit should not at present be further pursued, and he considers that it should be possible to ensure a sufficient degree of British control over the sheikhdom by adopting a policy of tightening up our control over the sheikh as opportunity offers, by filling in the gaps which at present exist in the agreements between the sheikh and His Majesty’s Government. The gaps (with the exception of that discussed in the following paragraph and of a slavery agreement) are not, in fact, very serious. Apart from the major assurances contained in the agreement of 1899, the sheikh has already given undertakings in respect of the arms traffic; he is precluded from granting a pearling, sponge-fishing, or oil concession without the approval of His Majesty’s Government (though as regards oil the specific undertaking contained in the letter of the 27th October, 1913 (No. XLI on p. 264 of Volume XI of the 1929 edition of Aitchison’s Treaties), is by no means so clear as could be desired); the control of aviation, whether military or civil, in his State will pass to His Majesty’s Government in the event of his accepting the proposals which the Resident has recently been instructed to make to him on this subject; while the proposed amendment of the Koweit Order in Council, once the sheikh’s con currence in this has been obtained, will place the question of jurisdiction over non- Moslem foreigners in his State on a securer and more satisfactory basis. 3. The delicate question of the direct correspondence which has gradually established itself between the sheikh and Ibn Saud remains for consideration. Sir Samuel Hoare has considered the alternatives discussed in paragraph 5 of Colonel Fowle’s despatch of the 25th October, and as a result he is of opinion, subject to the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that the first alternative suggested by the Resident (which incidentally is, apparently, likely to prove the less objectionable to the sheikh) is the right solution. Subject to Sir John Simon's concurrence, he would propose, however, to approve the Resident's recommendation that Colonel Dickson should approach the sheikh verbally on the lines suggested in paragraph 6 of Bushire despatch under con sideration, with the modification suggested in Mr. Johnstone’s demi-official letter of the 25th November last to Mr. Laithwaite. Sir Samuel Hoare would also propose that it might be left to Colonel Fowle’s discretion, after the sheikh’s attitude has become known, to settle the matter in accordance with either of the alternatives discussed in paragraph 5 of his despatch. The important question whether special action should be taken to emphasise at Jedda to Ibn Saud the nature of the relations which exist between His Majesty’s Government and the sheikh might be considered when a repoix has been received from Colonel Fowle. 4. The question of the obligations of His Majesty’s Government for the protection of Koweit, to 'wnich the Resident refers in paragraphs 7—11 of his ktvsGc G&lt; jesty’s Gi if tie vif jefattol fhi fetation i state o i informal u formal me forma rprotectn17 s &amp; ty despatch, is one of considerable importance. The general position is examined in the India Office memorandum B. 427/P.Z. 6535/33, of which copies have already been communicated to the Foreign Office. The Secretary of State agrees with the Political Resident that the agreements of 1899 and 1907, containing as they do merely a promise of good offices, the applicability of which to the whole sheikhdom as distinct from the town of Koweit is open to doubt, are not of great material importance so far as “protection” is concerned. The undertaking of real importance is that given to the sheikh in 1914 in return for the co-operation of his predecessor against the Turks. 5. Subject to Sir John Simon’s views, Sir Samuel Hoare, on a consideration of the position as a whole, is in agreement with Colonel Fowle’s view that the phraseology of this undertaking and the use of the word £ 4 sheikhdom ’ ’ and not t£ town ” would appear to place definitely a responsibility for the protection of the whole principality of Koweit on His Majesty’s Government. He is, at the same time, in entire agreement with the Resident that such an obligation, if His Majesty’s Government now formally confirm that they recognise its existence, cannot be regarded as relieving the sheikh completely of the responsibility of his own defence, and that ‘ ‘ the sheikh should certainly be able to deal with any small raids across his frontiers and should only look for assistance from His Majesty’s Government in the case of more serious incursions.” Such a construction would, as Colonel Fowle suggests, be consistent with the attitude adopted by His Majesty’s Government after the Akhwan operations of 1928-29, though it is relevant that no close examination of the precise obligations in the matter of His Majesty’s Government was undertaken at that time. Should Sir John Simon share the views expressed in this paragraph, Sir Samuel Hoare will cause the Resident to be instructed accordingly. 6. While the Secretary of State, as stated above, would be opposed to the declaration of a protectorate, and is satisfied, as at present advised, that the desiderata of His Majesty’s Government can be sufficiently secured by indirect tightening up of our control over the sheikh, he is at the same time impressed by the informal character of the engagements which have been entered into on behalf of Koweit. He would, therefore, be disposed to see advantage in consolidating the various undertakings which have from time to time been given on either side in a formal treaty on the lines of the Qatar Treaty of 1916, could this be secured without much difficulty. This would probably involve a reiteration and possibly a more formal specification by His Majesty s Government of their iesponsibility for protection of the principality of Koweit. Moreover, as stated in the India Office note B. 427/P.Z. 6535/33 on this subject, the assurances at present given to the sheikh are, in practice, renewed to each successor in return for his acceptance of the obligations, liability for which was accepted by his predecessors, and m 1918 it appears to have been held that our obligations held good only so long as the ruling sheikh on his side complied with his engagements. It is arguable tiiat a formal treatv might place a heavier burden on His Majesty s Goveinment wi out correspondingly binding the sheikh. But it seems doubtful whethei t is view could, in fact, be sustained. Formal recognition by His Majesty s Government of a Sheikh of Koweit would presumably be necessary before the engagements entered into with previous sheikhs could be regarded as binding on either party. Any formal comprehensive treaty which might be drawn up could presumably be so framed as to make it clear that obligations were entirely reciprocal, and that the liability of His Majesty’s Government held good only so long as they were satisfied with the performance by the sheikh of his obligations under the trea y. ina y, so far as protection is concerned, if the view suggested m paragraph a above is accepted, that a general liability (within the limits described) for the protection of the principality of Koweit as a whole must already e regar e as S , His Majesty’s Government, no material increase of their responsibilteies wou^ be involved' in reiterating their acceptance of that liability m a formal treaty while the mere fact of reiteration might make it easier to “’Jh we^ome sheikh to a consolidating agreement. The Secretary of State would w Sir John Simon’s views on this point a , -c^oirm Affairs thf* 7 Subject to the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Anairs, the Secretary of' State would suggest that, in view of the small margin of difference which appears to exist between the provisional lecomme , ,• £ „ departmental conference of the 5 th October last, t e lec it will be Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the proposals in this letter, it w [9823] D18 unnecessary, if those proposals commend themselves to Sir John Simon, to refer the question for discussion to the Official Middle East Sub-Committee. Copies of the relevant papers might, however, once final instructions have been sent to the Political Resident in the jPersian Gulf, be circulated for information to the other Departments represented on that committee. I am, &amp;c. J. C. WALTON. [E 775/739/91] o. -Foreign Office to India Office. Sir, Foreign Office, February 24, 1934. I AM directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to request that you will lay before Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare the following observations on India Office letter of the 1st February, regarding relations between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Sheikh of Koweit. 2. Sir John Simon concurs in the view expressed in paragraph 2 of that letter that the question of declaring a protectorate over Koweit should not for the present be further pursued. 3. With regard to the question of direct correspondence between the sheikh and King Ibn Saud, Sir John Simon agrees that the sheikh should first be sounded orally in the sense suggested in paragraph 3 of your letter. He would, however, suggest that thereafter the Political Resident should report further which of the alternative courses of action discussed in paragraph 5 of his despatch of the 25th October, 1933, he recommends, before adopting either, in order that His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda may be given an opportunity of furnishing his observations. As at present advised, Sir John Simon is inclined to prefer the second alternative proposed by Colonel Fowle (viz., that all official correspondence between the sheikh and Ibn Saud should pass exclusively through the Political Resident or Political Agent and his Majesty’s representative at Jedda), as emphasising more strongly the special position of His Majesty’s Government in Koweit and placing a more effectual check upon Ibn Saud’s attempts to strengthen his own position there to the detriment of that held by His Majesty’s Government. Phis course would, in Sir John Simon’s view, have the additional advantage that the influence of His Majesty’s representative at Jedda could, when necessary, be more easily exerted upon the Saudi Government, if he were the actual channel of the sheikh’s communications. u ^ cas ?’ ^ appears that, were the first alternative adopted, it would not be sufficient simply to exercise a discreet control in Koweit over direct correspondence between King Ibn Saud and the sheikh. For, although the sheikh s side of the correspondence would be seen by the Political Agent, there would be no indication of this fact on the document which reached Ibn Saud. , therefore, the sheikh were to send Ibn Saud a letter which the Political Agent had not seen and which His Majesty’s Government wished to repudiate on that ground, they might find some difficulty m establishing with King Ibn Saud the fact that they were justified m doing so, since, so far as he could see, this letter wou d be no less authentic than others which he had exchanged with the sheikh, and which he had been tacitly led to consider perfectly in order. It would, therefore m Sir John Simon s view, be necessary to add to those of the sheikh’s letters which the Political Agent had seen and approved some indication of fhat tact But such an arrangement would probably in the sheikh’s eyes be as a llmita t 1 on on his official correspondence with Ibn Saud as the second alternative proposed by Lieutenant-Colonel Fowle. firci L 11 f V rther a PP ear s to Sir John Simon that, since it is proposed in the corrcLorffip^p 611 the sh e ik fi orafiy, to suggest to him that all his official correspondence with Ibn Saud should be conducted through His Maiestv’s local w f ? ba ° k ° n the f rst alternative Reposed by Stenpt- Colonel Fowle would represent a weakening on the part of His Maiesiv’s Government, which on general grounds would be better avoided. 1 b - A hnal decision m the matter must, however evidentlv denend unon the loThe 1 ^ LieUtenant - C ° l0nel Fowle af ter the p^miLr^orat a^roath the protection^of ^Knwpi t°^ s Majesty’s Government in respect of paragraphs 4 andLof your1rtter 0 unde™eply agreeS ^ the ^ eXpreSSed iD Liieiit ^ !f0! ill by the n treaty re 11 Sir Mary t&lt; Mines tl midi u rom8. He has also considered the proposal in paragraph 6 of that letter for the conclusion of a new and comprehensive treaty between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the sheikh, which should include inter alia the acceptance by His Majesty s Government of a general liability for the protection of the whole sheikhdom within the limits indicated in paragraph 10 of Colonel Fowle’s despatch of the 25th October, referred to above. While agreeing that there would be advantage in such a treaty, Sir John Simon assumes that it is not proposed to undertake the negotiation of it immediately. Prima facie it seems inadvisable to raise a possibly controversial issue of such importance with the sheikh until the question of his relations with King Ibn Sand and that of the projected oil concession (which appears likely to indispose the sheikh, since he may lose financially by the elimination of competition between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the United States oil interests) have been disposed of. 9. As regards the possibility mentioned in paragraph 6 of your letter, that a formal treaty might be considered to place a heavier burden on His Majesty’s Government than that which they at present bear in respect of Koweit, without correspondingly binding the sheikh, I am to observe that, in accordance with the construction which is usually placed upon treaties with heads of States, any formal treaty concluded with the Sheikh of Koweit would attach to Koweit as a State, and would apply automatically to the sheikh’s successors. The under takings given by the two contracting parties to a treaty must certainly be construed as reciprocal. Sir John Simon notes, however, from statements made by the India Office representative at the meeting held at the Foreign Office on the 5th October to discuss this question, that it is considered that His Majesty’s Government could and would remove a Sheikh of Koweit for hopeless misgovern- ment. He presumes, therefore, that His Majesty’s Government could in practice prevent the accession of a ruler who seemed unlikely to observe his treaty obligations towards them, or could, at any rate, remove a ruler who after his accession in fact refused to observe those obligations. If this be so, there appears no ground for fearing that a situation might arise in which His Majesty’s Government would be faced with the alternatives either of acquiescing in a refusal by the sheikh to recognise his treaty obligations or of putting an end to their treaty relations with Koweit. 10. Sir John Simon concurs in the view of Sir Samuel Hoare that it is unnecessary to refer this question to the Official Middle East Sub-Committee, but he assumes that copies of the relevant papers will be circulated later to the Departments represented thereupon.

The Secretary of State would be glad m due course to receive your views on the proposal referred to in paragraph 6 of India Office letter of the 1st February for the conclusion of a new and comprehensive treaty between His | Majesty’s Government and the Sheikh of Koweit. The matter is not one of j immediate urgency, and it may well be that, as suggested by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, there may be advantage in deferring any reference to it until further progress has been made in the disposal of the vexed question of the relations of the sheikh with King Ibn Sand and the questions of oil concessions for Koweit proper and the neutral zone between Koweit and Nejd. 6. The interdepartmental meeting of the 5th October recommended, inter alia, that the issue of the Saudi blockade of Koweit should be taken up with King | Ibn Sand by His Majesty’s Government on the basis of their obligation to protect the interests of Koweit.

Mr.Laithwaite said that there seemed great force in the arguments in Colonel Fowle’s despatch of the 27th April and in particular in its suggestion that the matter should be left alone for the present, until the Kuwait Ml question was out of the way, and that at an appropriate moment both Ibn Baud and the Shaikh should be warned that no unofficial coimruni cation could be recognised as binding by His Majesty’s G-ovemment. The best course in all the circumstances seemed to be to leave matters as they were for the moment. If, in fact, as stated by the Shaikh (paragraph 11 of Colonel Dickson’s despatch of the 6th April, No.C.125) we saw all official coraiiunications/V4 - 2 - communications that cassed between the Shaikh and Ibn Saud that was to some extent a safeguard. The Shaikh was perhaps likely to be more careful than in the past as a result of his unfortunate correspondence over the claims, and it would be open to us to emphasise at a suitable stage that we could recognise no correspondence that we had not seen. The Political Agent might be relied on to scrutinise all correspondence carefully. After further discussion, during which Mr.Warner suggested that a somewhat better control might be achieved if the Shaikh 1 s recent assurancesto Colonel Dickson (i.e. that he showed to the Political Agent all official correspondence with Ibn Saud) were officially communicated to Ibn Saud as part of the demarche foreshadowed in the previous paragraph, it was agreed that the matters might be left for further discussion with the Political Resident and Colonel Dickson during their leave in England this summer.P.Z*702l/35o (/V/C . IKDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W.l End October, 1935. My dear Hendel, Would you Mndly refer to your letter of the 28th September, HOoE 5095/19/91, about the possibility of substituting a new comprehensive treaty for the present series of agreements between His Majesty^ Government and the Sheikh of Kuwait. We have, in fact, already discussed this question with Fowle, and 1 was going to write to you about it. Fowle feels, and we agree, that it is better to leave this question over for the moment, and I note that this coincides with your present feeling on the matter. The chief reason for Fowle f s view is that a comprehensive treaty, even if it were merely a consolidation of existing agreements (and still more, of course, if there were any idea of 'tightening up”) would doubtless be regarded with suspicion by the Sheikh, who would feel that His ^ Majesty*s Government were trying to get something out of him. In view of our continued failure to resolve the Date Garden question, the Iraqi smuggling problem and the Saudi Blockade it would be difficult, in present circumstances, to press the Sheikh in the matter if he felt that way about it. If we can get at any rate one or two of these vital questions settled we can, no doubt, broach the subject of the Sheikhas relations with His Majesty’s Government with greater confidence. Even then, as you point out, we may have to have a difficult discussion in the Middle East official sub-Committee on the subject. I doubt if there would be any point in discussing the matter further with Fowle at this stage. By the way, Fowle does not actually leave until the end of next week. Yours sincerely, r.Rendel, Esq., CMG., ( sd *) M.J. CLAUS Ob. Foreign Office, S.W.lE 5095/19/91) FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l 28t.h September, 1935. ■T' My dear Clauson, . v - ^ ^ You may remember that in the India Office official letter, No.r*2*521/35 of the 19th February, the question was raised of the possibility of substituting for the present series of letters and informal undertakings which govern relations between His Majesty’s Government and the Sheikh of Koweit, a new comprehensive treaty on the lines of the Treaty of 1916 with the Sheikh of Qatar. In a letter of the 13th March, we welcomed this idea, but suggested that the whole question of our future relations with the Sheikh of Koweit might be considered at a meeting of the Middle ^ East Official Sub-Committee. The correspondence was forwarded by the India Office to the Political Resident and the Government of India, and F'owle replied, on the 4th April, that he would submit his views on the matter in due course. I understand that Ward, of my Department, has discussed the question with you once or twice, and that you undertook to ascertain Fowle’s views before he returns to the Gulf and to let us hear further on the subject indie course. I do not know whether it will really be practicable to proceed much further with this question in present circumstances. Although we all agreed some time ago that our policy as regards the Sheikh of Koweit should be one of tightening up our control wherever possible, the meeting of the Middle East Official Sub-Committee on the 24th September shewed that there was still a good d eal of difference of opinion as to the general direction which our policy/ Clauson, EsqMmm—mmamti&amp;n policy should follow on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf. It may be, therefore, that it will be best to leave this rather difficult question overfor the present. On the other hand I understand that Powle is leaving for the Gulf in a few days and we may thus find that we have missed a good opportunity of consulting him on a question which may possibly become acute again sooner than we think. You may therefore like to take the opportunity of discussing the question with him while he is still here, and I need hardly say that if you would both like to talk it over with me here, I am completely at your disposal.

I am leaving it to his discretion to impress on Shaikh desirability of avoid ing political discussions except in presence of Political Agent.

Gur relations with the Arab Tulers are governed by certain treaties. Those with Bahrain and the Trucial Shaikhs (including qatar) contain a specific provision tfe^t the rhaikhs concerned can have no cOfc&amp;aunicutiotn with foreign ulers and therefore inferentially should not pay or receive visits without the sanction of His Majesty*s Government. In the Kuwait Agreements* however* there is nothing to prevent comsiunicationo between the Ghaikh and Foreign vulers, and therefore inferer*tially he can pay and receive visits without the sanction of His Majesty** Government. 4 . / Hon’ ble Sir Aubrey Metcalfe* KCXK.*CS2.,HVO. i Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, lew ilelhi •*0 £*} «■» 4* * ther« i» therefore a definite gap in oar Kuwait Agree- aiento which we tried to fill up a couple of years ago* The result of this attempt is given in letter Bo*388-11 of the 27 th April 1934 to the India Office# (copy forwarded to Govern ment of India and Kuwait under wy Printed Letter Be*589-S of the same date)# quoted by Ryan* The Ahaikh reacted most unfavourably to the suggestion that official correspondence between him and I bn baud should pass through the hands of His Majesty*a Government 1 * Representatives* the Minister at Jedda and the 1 olitical Agent at Kuwait, 8 , But when X said that our control over the foreign relatione of Kuwait differed from that over those of the other Shaikhs all I ;&amp;eant was in regard to the particular point at issue i*e* coamunieati ns witn Foreign Rulere* Kacept for this point the Shaikh of Kuwait’s position is similar to th t of the other Shaikhs* He Is not allowed to receive th© Representative of ainy foreign Power# or to cede# sell# etc*# etc* any portion of his territory to the govern ment or subjects of a foreign Power without the sanction of His Majesty’s Government (Aitchison 1*0* Bo. tOXVl ) or to import arias into# or export them from# uw&amp;it { .bid XXXVI1) or to grant an oil concession without sanction of His Majesty** Government (Ibid XI,J). It will be seen therefore that under our Agreements we have a fairly close control over Kuwait in the matter of foreign relations and otherwise, and even with regard, to communio&amp;tl ns we have the Shaikh*s assurance ^iven in paragraph 11 of Dickson*s letter Bo*0-1^5 of the 8 th April 1934 (copy forwarded to India Office and Government of India under my Printed Letter So.Sfte-S oS the 20 th\.April 1934) to the effeot that he (the Bh*ilth) ehnwed ell official oorreS' pondence with Ibn Bead to the iolitiesl /igent. .

I think that this letter will fill the gap already referred t© in a practical manner. It will remind the Shaikh of his assurance, in case he has forgotten about it, and will ensure that he acts up to it. if he fails to do so, and correspondence of importance passes between him and Ihn Baud which he does not show to the Political Agent, we shall be in a position to confront the diai&amp;h with his promise, and to consider any such communication as personal, of which we can rtfuse to take any official cognisance.

Until 1 received your letter I had nurposely refrained from making observations, as it appeared to me that the subject, though of great interest to me, concerns me only indirectly and that His Majesty's Government and the Government of India had all the elements necessary to form a judgment* 1 contented myself with including the following passage in a personal letter to Powle himself, dealing primarily v/ith a matter of office routine regarding the transmission of the copy of his letter, which he had kindly sent me:- M I may add that I read your above mentioned letter to Metcalfe about the foreign relations of Kuwait with great interest. I an not sure that it entirely convinces me b\it I am impressed by the argument developed in paragraph 5. Anyhow, I now leave the matter to higher authorities. ± am sure that you will forgive me for having butted into a subject which primarily concerns you but which is of great importance to me also, as Minister in one of the only two countries, besides ours&amp;bves, who matter much politically to Kuwait”. 2. As you ask for my observatione, I now give them; but with grea + diffidence, as I am not sure that i have all the necessary material for a detailed study and, even if 1 have, 1 have insufficient time for such a study, in view of my imminent departure from Jedda. 3. Until the question arose in its present form, I was imbued with the belief that our position in regard to Kuwait, though resting on a different documentary basis, was, so far as foreign / G.W.Pendel k!sq,,CMG., POPKJOH 0^1 CM.— foreign affaire are concerned, indiatingniehable from our position in regard to Bahrain, Qatar and the ^racial Bhaldch- dome. I had not gone deeply into the natter, hut 1 regarded this belief an renting on bed-rodc and it han animated every discussion I have had v;ith + he Saudis during the lan+ six years. I imagined for instance that, if an agreement resulted from local discussions of the blockade question, it would be recorded in an Anglo-Saudi exchange of notes,. When v;e went into the subject of direct correspondence on official matters between Ibn £»aud and the Shaikh of ICuwa it , I never doubt ed that we had the ri ght to object to it, though 1 acquiesced in the final decision, which in my view was merely a decision not to assert that right categori cally for the time being. 4* I have never understood the phrase^Am independent principality under British protection*, which was applied to Kuwait in the official communication to the fiiaudi (xovernm^wf, * based on 'Foreign Office despatch to Jedda llo a lll(K 4144/119/91) of Beptember f? 9 th 19B r7 but I have always set greats^ore by the statement that rt British rights in the Persian Oulf and on the coast rest not merely on the agreements which ha^e been conclud ed, but on the custom, consent and long established relations of all the Persian Gulf chiefs and the Bu It an of Muscat with the Government of India’*. 1 have also set storeby the fact that Kuwait was referred to in the same terms? as Bahrain &amp;c. in Article of the ^reaty of dedda. 5 . I agree with Powle that the undertakings given to us by the Shaikhs of Kuwait cover a great deal of the ground, and probably the most important ground, covered by our agreements with Bahrain &amp;c. I have now compared them hurriedly with the agreements with Bahrain, as given in Aitchison. Apart from the /-3- the old-vjorld provisiors about piracy, which may he dis regarded, and the ahserce of ary provisions about slavery in the case of Kuwait, the main obligations assumed by Bahrain, but not Tr r Kuwait, appear to be the following (a) freedom for British subjects to reside in Bahrain. (b) Limitation of cu s t ons d u t i es to 5% ml_ valor era. (c) Bo correspordence or agreement to be entered into with any power other than Brent Britain, without British consent, subject to a reservation in the 18R0 agreement, not reproduced in that of 1B9B, in favour of continued correspondence wi th the local authorities of neighbouring stages abou+ matters of minor importance. 6 . The absence of (a) and (b^ in our undertakings with Kuwait is presumably at present of no practical consequence. absence of (c) however, might easily become crucial, especially in view of the present recrudeserce of pan-Arabism* Bowie’s proposal in paragraph n of bi s letter to Metcalfe would, I admit, go far to tie the Bhaikh u]3 as regards his relations with Ibn Baud, but would it go far enough,if the f^haikh, a charming but not entirely trustworthy man, swayed away from us? Wha* would our attitude be, if either he or the f$audi Bovernment claimed tha 4 any futmre agreement between them must be made direct? Tnat restraint could v.e impose, to take an extreme case, if Baud! Arabia and/or Iraq ceased to covet Kuwait and. invited the Bhaikh instead to accede to their recent ^reaty of Alliance? 7, T do not say that the dangers implied in these questions are imminent.. I do noi think that the Bhaikh is such a fool as to break away from us in present circumstances and I think that the chances of Ibn Baud trying to nobble him on the lines suggested in a memorandum submitted by me at hone on August / \ ^ im '16th 1933 (Ree Print in IS 60 r 7 r, /l6/9i) are Bnaller dots 'han they niyht have been in 1933. All the same I think that v;e should have a clear idea in our ov?n nin&amp;B as to the Bhaikh's legal position In regard to correspondence v;ith other rulers and above all the making of agreements with them. 8 , In this connection 1 note tv;o possibly conflicting facts. 'Hie Kuwait-ITejd Boundary Convention of December !?nd 19^y seems to have been signed by More as being technically the direct representative o&gt;f the Shaikh. Cn the other hand, tiie recent foreign Office letter to the India Office of Way 7th, enclosed in your printed letter No.l72(3S 2085/2085/91) of the same date about f he titles of the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain, emphasises very strongly and without any distinction between independent in international law but are undor the suzerainty 9 .

My dear Brenan, Would you kindly refer to your letter No. E.5747/1603/ 91, of the 12th September and to the last paragraph of my letter of the 2 At»d September about the control of Kuwait foreign relations? We have now received Fowle’s considered views on the subject, which are given in the note of which ^ I enclose a copy, and I have submitted the matter for / consideration here. Our view is that the question is one largely of tactics which the Resident (in consultation, no doubt, with the Political Agent) is in the best position to decide. What we want to do is to arrange, at some time or other, | for an exchange of Notes with the Sheikh of Kuwait whereby m he acknowleuges in so many words that his foreign relations 1| are conducted by H.M.G. The time and method for doing this | \is primarily a matter for the Resident. We propose, if you agree, to inform Fowle accordingly and to say that we agree with the views which he has expressed in his note, namely that in the first place the exchange of Notes regarding the lifting of the Saudi blockade should be disposed of and that thereafter Fowle m should take the first available opportunity of reverting to the Sheikh’s previous discussion with Dickson on the subject * and should endeavour to crystallise the matter in a satisfactory exchange of Notes. May we assume that the Foreign Office, with whom we are now in agreement as to principle, agree with us as to the tactics? •Brenan Esq., O.B.E. Yours, &amp;c., (Sgd.) M.J. CLAUSONCOPY OF NOTE BY LT.

My views are that, as Mr.Rendel pointed out at the Meeting, there was some danger of some Power, now that Kuwait is more or less in the international sphere, challenging our status in Kuwait and our right to conduct its foreign relations. At the same time I think that Sir Andrew Ryan’s suggestion at the end of the record of the meeting that when the texts of the notes on the blockade question were agreed, but before they were actually signed, that we should then tell the Sheikh that the question had arisen as to the proper form for the notes to take, might well raise some difficulties. In the first place, it would mean a delay in the actual signing of the notes which the Saudi Government would not understand, and might lead to various complications. If the Sheikh refused to accept our letter regarding our control over his foreign relations, I do not see how we could refuse to let the notes actually be signed. Moreover the Sheikh might convey the gist of our letter to Ibn Baud. 2* I think it would be preferable to return to the suggestion made in my demi-official letter No.19b of March 5th 1936 to Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, P.Z.1844, and try to hang our letter to the Sheikh on something which the Sheikh himself had already said. Before addressing this letter to him, I could again revert in the course of conversation to the Sheikh’s original promise to Colonel Dickson that he always showed all official correspondence between himself and Ibn Saud to the Political Agent. From the Sheikh’s reaction to my conversation we could judge what his feelings were on the matter and proceed accordingly. 3 ./2 . 3. To sum up, I think it would he better to address a communication to the Sheikh after the actual exchange of the blockade notes and not before.P.z. 7427/36 ; r ^00/1603/91) POHEION OFFICE, S.¥. 1, 15th October 1936. I My dear Clauson, We have been considering your letter Ho.p. Z.6611/36 f of September 30th to Brenan (who is still away on leave) about the control of the foreign relations of Koweic. 2. We agree with the action proposed in the third paragraph of your letter and are quite willing to let the Political Hesident take up the question at whatever moment he thinks the most suitable. We would even suggest that it might be preferable to postpone approaching the Sheikh until after the exchange of notes regarding the Saudi-Koweit || blockade has been published, since if these notes were published without challenge from the Sheikh or anyone else, this would be to all intents and purposes an acceptance of the traditional and prescriptive position which would trengthen our hand in dealing with the Sheikh.

I therefore conclude that any such overcharge of duty may have been more due to lack of liaison between the shaikh's Customs Office and his secretariat than anything else. The amount involved is very small and no one has pressed for a refund. it will be recalled that a similar lack of efficient coordination among His .Excellency’s officials resulted some time back in the payment of duty by Imperial Airways on their supplies of Petrol ana Oil, which should have been allowed to enter here free of auty uncer the terms of the Civil Air Agreement.

My dear Be Gfaury, Please see Koweit Intelligence Summary No. 14 of 1936. There is a story going around Basra to the effect that the Shaikh of Koweit deliberately kept Vice-itdmiral ohe Honourable Sir Alexander Ramsay waiting an hour when he dined on the ^Norfolk' on October 14th; and that he was annoyed when Dickson found excuses for him on the alleged ground that he had had motor trouble. The story goes on to say that the Shaikh had been put up to behave badly by two Egyptiems who have been foisted on him by the Italians and that he is becoming more and more impressed by Italian wireless propaganda to the effect that we are an effete and decadent lot who have announced our intention to sit down under any insult - no matter how blatant.

Rendel, Yoar more important suggestion is in regard to the paragraphs dealing with the Koweit, But here my difficulty is rather the same. I could, of course, put in a couple of paragraphs in defence of the Sheikh oi Koweit, but the difficulty is that a good many copies of the report have already gone out, and I am not sure whether so important an alteration is practicable without a good deal more labour than would be justified. Moreover, we have now discussed the whole question of Koweit at the interdepartmental meeting which took place here on Lay 18th when the various points you make in your letter were very fully gone into. In the circumstances might it not be enough to insert a passage in any covering letter you send to the recipients of the report, explaining that you have drawn my attention to the possible unfairness to the Sheikh in the passages in question and that the whole matter has now formed the subject of further discussion in the course of which a somewhat new light was thrown on the problem/problem, so that this particular part of the report should be read in conjunction with the record of that discussion and not independently?Extract from letter from Mr• J.C. Walton, India Office, to Mr. (x.l* Rendel, Foreign Office, dated 11th May 1937. I have no very grave criticism as to what you have indicated of the India Office and Government of India point of view. In what is said about policy in Koweit, however, I do not think that it is quite correctly described, as at the end of paragraph 30, as 'mainly negative”. As regards the attitude of the Sheikh also there is, I think, one factor of importance which is not mentioned, i,e., the fact that the Sheikh has for long years had two legitimate grievances against His Majesty 1 s Government ~ namely the non-fuliilment or delayed fulfilment of our promises about the date gardens and helping to secure the removal of Ion Saudis blockade* 7 /e have, of course, done our beso, and are cool! u.i g ^ do so, but it would not be surprising if the long wait had made the Sheikjj somewhat bitter, as he struck me when he was here (rather than quite happy about the situation, as you describe him in paragraph 32); and it seems a probable partial explanation of his somewhat unamenable/unamenable attitude. The Sheikh of Bahrein, with whom you contrast him, has nothing to complain of, and has flourished lite the green bay tree under our protection. The fact that Koweit, unlike Bahrein, is on the mainland wedged between two larger States is also another factor which makes things much more difficult for the Sheikh of Koweit, as welj. as for us. I do not know whether you would care to add something on these points, in order to avoid any risk of doing an injustice to the Sheikh of Koweit through the omission of factors which are very likely relevant to his attitude. Only one other point* Does it give quite the right impression to say (paragraph 32) that most of the Sheikh’s subjects seem to do a thrivirg trade in smuggling? Mo doubt they import the goods into Koweit, but we have always been told that the smuggling across the frontier into Iraq is done by Iraqis (De Gaury confirmed this to me orally the other day), and I think a large nart of that into Hejd is done (is it not?) bjr Ibn Baud's tribesmen.Telegram XX. i. 1 rom India Office, London.

E I T. 1 Kie question of our future policy in regard to Koweit is one of considerable difficulty and may require an urgent solution. ^ • ill til©X*t o our ■') o 1 i nrr Viao ntariv-i , 4 „ n , . x nco seen mainly negative. Our chiei concern lias been to prevent the absorption of Kaweit by elther 0f its tvvo P° werfu l neighbours, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, | and ao defend tne interests of the Sheikh against those two countries to the best of our ability with the minimum of interference m his internal affairs. We have also sought to prevent, tne penetration of any non-British foreign influence into Koweit and have sought to insist on our right to manage Koweit‘s xoreign relations. We have very carefully refrained from interfering in any way in the internal affairs of Koweit and have relied wholly on powers of peaceful persuasion to induce the Sneiihi 10 follow a reasonable policy. We have not contemplated at udip time atremoting to coerce the Sheikh, and in fact no metnods of coercion are at present available. To embark on a more forward or active policy would lead to a number of serious complications and involve a complete departure from our tretai Lions. A very strong case would therefore have to be made cut if any such change of policy were to be contemplated. am On the other hand the situation is becoming increasingly unsatisfactory. It is admitted that Koweit could not maintain its independent existence without our support. It has no hinterland of any importance, it has a very limited water supply (it depends largely on fresh water brought in dhows from the Shatt-el-Arab), and it has none of the elements necessary to self-sufficiency or independence. It is no exaggeration therefore to say that it ernes its continued independence solely to the protection of His Majesty’s Government. 4 . The relations of Koweit both with Iraq and with Saudi Arabia are, however, extremely unsatisfactory, difficulties are accumulating with both countries, owing to1“ 2 the smu^isliii^ ^xiioli uiiucu.d beo-lj 7 ' tcihes pX8.ce on ci very Is.n^e scale through howeit into both Iraq and Saudi Arabia. The authorities in the Persian Gulf are naturally inclined to sty that it is hie business of Iraq or Saudi Arabia to prevent this smuggling; that persons and organisations in both those countries tend to benefit by it, if not actively to Koneit himself is innocent, or the sake of Iraq or subjects which any attempt exp loit it; that the ; Sheikh and in no w ay bound to incur, Ara hia, the odium with his ow on his part to s top srn uggling cas e His kEa jesty’s Gov eminent str ’ong step s in the matter. 5. All this is to some extent true, but the fact remains that the relations of His Majesty's Government both with Iraq and Saudi Arabia are greatly complicated by the extreme tension which lias developed between K owe it and those two countries. It is impossible for His Majesty's Government to avoid some responsibility for this situation so long as they continue to control the foreign relations of Howeit and to protect Koweit against external attack, and the reaction of this situation on British imperial interests in more important matters is beginning to prove most embarrassing. tie therefore have a direct interest in doing* whatever may be possible to bring the present unsatisfactory situation to an end, cmd to bring: about a real improvement in relations between Kao eit on the one hand and Saudi Arabia and Iraq on the other. But it is extremely doubtful whether it is pnysically possible for us to do this if our present policy in regard to Mavert centinues unchanged. 6. There is another aspect of Anglo-Koweiti relations which is of even greater importance. The future of Iraq is most uncertain. The present Iraqi Government is weak and somewhat unreliable, and dependent to a much greater extent than is at all healthy on the good will of military leaders.The possibility cannot be excluded of serious trouble breaking Rr p0Sltl0n ln teat country being much impairea. It has for long been a principle of our Middle Eastern policy that we should have air bases and. free air transit through the Middle ^«o+ - a a i ° Ui^^xo aja&amp;t, and it was, m fact, largely for this reason that the App’l n t- r «&lt;■ i - lL ^ l0 “ J - ra hi alliance was negotiated. it is legitimate to question whether that alliance can now be reliea upon quite so confidently as when it was first concluded, with this increasing uncertainty in Iraq, it is for consideration Ydietn&amp;r it might not be a prudent form of insurance to try to strengthen our position in some neighbouring territory which nifcnt, in an emergency, serve as some kind of alternative. The only territory where this would be at all possible is that of K owe it. 7. Again cur relations with Persia are still far from being regularised. We depend to a very great extent on soiunern rersia lor our oil supplies. It is most unlikely that V'/e shall ever need to use force in order to maintain the safety of our oil supplies. Put the possibility of a situation arising where it might be of great value to us to have a good base in this area under complete British control cannot be altogether excluded; and here again Koweit seems to offer the only p os s i b i 1 i ty. 8. Lastly it is of the utmost importance to us from the imperial strategic point of view - and incidentally also in view of the new oil resources which appear to exist in Koweit - that no other Power should establish itself in Koweit, and that howeit should remain definitely under British control. But the time has passed when such a situation can be secured by purely negative means; if we really wish to keep other people out we hast inevitably step in and assume more direct responsibility ourselves. The same problem has arisen in Bahrein and the trueial States and in the Aden Protectorate In all thesecases, tne situation would ‘be simple and safe if we were preparea to assume control and responsibility; while it is confused and precarious so long as our attitude is mainly negative and aloof. The problem which has arisen elsewhere new seems oo be arising in Koweit and it is submitted that the s ooner it is xranixly faced, the better. ^ • ■ Lii ‘ d special aiiliculties of assuming greater control m howtoic a,i o well known • Apart from obvious geographical iactors, tney arise to some extent both from the failings and from the good qualities of the character of the Sheikh himself. His Excellency’s present policy seems to be to play off the | British, the Iraqis and the Saudis against each other, and to maintain his independence and prosperity by a precarious equilibrium of the three. The fact that British oil interests allowed an America! oil company to obtain so large a share in exploiting the oil possibilities of hov eit has considerably strengthened the Sheikh’s hands, and he is quite clever and capable enough to make full use of every advantage which the situation gives him. Should oil be discovered in commercial quantities in the near future - as seems possible - the Sheifh is likely to be able still further to strengthen his position \ and to accumulate still greater resources which he will be able tc use against our interests. 10 . It is therefore submitted that the time has come to adopt a more forward policy with the Sheikh of Kcweit, and to consider hew we can gradually strengthen our control over him. The ideal first step would be the establishment ox a British political adviserehip, corresponding to that exercised by Mr.Belgrave at Bahrein. It will, however, take a long time to get the Sheikh of Koweit to agree to this, ana, before anything of the kind can be pressed successfully, it will be necessary for us to strengthen our physical position in his principality. /5 11# It is submitted that this could be rendered much easier if could establish in Howe it ^ naval and air stations even of a more or less skeleton type# It is admitted that such stations are not at present necessary for purely naval or military reasons; that bases at Basra and Bahrein are all that is for the moment required; and that the establishment of a raw- base at K owe it would have to be justified by political rather than by technical considerations. It is submitted, however, that political reasons are so strong that the establishment at any rate of skeleton bases would be more than justified, and that even from the strictly Service point of view, the uncertainty of the future situation in neighbouring countries would give an important insurance value to the establishment of such bases which would justify the comparatively small expenditure involved. 12, Unfortunately hitherto the question of the establishment of an air or naval base at Koweit seems to have been considered purely from the point of view of the immediate Service requirements of the situation. It is understood that the Air Mi ms b i ^ have already decided against the acquisition of land foi an aerodrome, while the navy are naturally in no hux iy t-c establish a new naval station at Koweit, which is too elooe uO Basra and possesses too little in the way of amenities, to o+ier much attraction from the service point of view. 12 . There is, however, a place immediately to the west of the town of Koweit where it is understood that two or three sloops could find a satisfactory anchorage and where a amaul naval station with the necessary amenities could still be bui-tu. Land moreoever appears still to be available wheie &lt;-n 'with the necessary buildings could oe established ev-n if installation were not completed for the present. It seems probable that the Sheikh, if he were tactfully approached, voula raise no objection to these proposals, pm uioul^xii as professes the greatest friendship and admiration for the BritisnNavy and Air Force. it is submitted that the establishment of naval and air bases would very greatly strengthen our physical position in koweit and make it far easier to develop a forward policy in other matters later on. la. me oiecise methods, however, by which a more ionward policy could be adopted would need to be worked out in consultation with the local authorities. What is important is an cai 1\ decision on che principle of strengthening' our position in Lovveit, and of aiming at increasing our control, and taking an increasing amount of direct responsibility for Kow e i t af f a i rs . EaSTEKH DEPARTMENT, FOREIGN OFFICE. May 10, 1937.'?/ Koweit. Inal record of informal interdepartmental meeting held in Mr* Rendel 1 s room in the Foreign Office at 3.30 p.m. on the 18th May. Mr. Rendel (in the aheir) ) Mr. E. Warner Mr. Walton (during the first part of the discussion) Mr. Rumhold Mr. Symon Mr. Seal Foreign Office India Office ) )Admiralty Major G.W.M. Grover ) Squadron-Leader Jope-Slade, Air Ministry. Colonel Osborne, War Office. Captain de Gaury, Political Agent, Koweit. Mr. Rendel explained that the meeting had been called in accordance with the arrangements outlined in his letters of the 13th May to Mr. Clauson, Group-Captain Pirie, Mr. Seal and Colonel Osborne (E 2606/2606/91), for the purpose of having a preliminary and entirely informal discussion about the situation in Koweit. He had been much struck in the course of his recent journey in the Middle East by the unsatisfactory position in regard to Koweit. Koweiti problems were it seemed to him poisoning our relations both with Iracq and with Saudi Arabia. On his passage through Iraq_, everyone had si)oken to him with great bitterness on the subject, while in Saudi Arabia feeling seemed to run almost equally high. The extent of our responsibility for Koweiti affairs was vague and uncertain, but tne reaction of those affairs on our own relations with neighbouring countries was/was serious. He had outlined his preliminary views on the question in a memorandum which had already heen circulated to those present at the meeting, hut he wished to make it clear that that memorandum had only heen intended to serve as a basis for discussion. MTjj—D alton agreed that the meeting might he useful, hut wished again to stress its informal character. We should have in the first instance to consult the Political Resident on any proposals. Mr. Rendel’s memorandum illustrated the differences between the Foreign Office and the India Office view. The India Office would like to strengthen our relations with Koweit and also the position of Koweit itself vis -a- vis its powerful neighbours. The Foreign Office stressed the desirability of strengthening British control. This was possibly a desirable object, but perhaps the Foreign Office did not attach enough importance to the psychological factor, namely the point of view of the Sheikh himself. He had two important grievances against His Majesty’s Government. The first of these was that in 1914 His Majesty’s Government had given an undertaking of the nature of a treaty that he should continue to enjoy his date gardens in Iraq.* Since the Iraqi Government had been in control His Majesty’s Government had been unable to implement that undertaking. In the second place, about ten years ago. His Majesty’s Government had promised their good offices in persuading King Ibn Saud to raise the blockade. They had been unable to do so. Mr. Walton felt that if anything was to be done with the Sheikh every effort should first be made to remove these grievances. He was in favour of strengthening our position in Koweit, out he did not think that this object was likely to be achieved by adopting a bullying attitude. With regard to Mr. Rendel’s suggestion for/for an air tase and a naval taae In Koweit, the India Ofuce, if such steps were practicable and subject to the views of the Political Eesident, would regard these prime feoie as welcome, since they would bring money into the country. Mrv. it end el thought that there was not necessarily any very great difference -between the India Office and Foreign Office views. The Foreign Office were fully alive to the importance of removing the Sheikh’s grievances, and had in fact for years been making every possible effort to do so. But the main difficulty still seemed to he the inadequacy oi the control v/e exercised over the Sheikh. At present the only sign of our influence at Koweit was the Agency building, outside the town on its seaward side. On the fl inland side there was nothing to show that Koweit v/as in any way separate or distinct from Saudi Arabia or Iraq, fhat was wanted was some outward and visible sign of British influence, to emphasise the fact that Koweit was essentially separate and independent from Saudi Arabia and Iraq, and under British protection. It was really a case of showing the flag. From the technical point of view there might be no need for a new naval base at Koweit, but for general political reasons, and for reasons of wider strategy, the establishment of some kind of naval station there might be of great value. Apart from the psychological effect, it would give us a means of strengthening and increasing our influence at any moment at v/hich it should be desirable to do so, without making any obvious new departure. * Mr. Seal admitted that Koweit might be strategically important, but it was a far cry from this to say that the building of a naval base was justified. Mr. Rendel said that all that was required was a small affair/(n©) ai-isir c-out';-weat of the town, flying the flag, and provided with a canteen and a caretaker. The establishment should be in an obvious place. —Sec_l did not think that the Admiralty would like this at all. Where, he asked, would it lead to? There would have to he similar establishments in many other places. It would all be most expensive. —* Hendel indicated some of the difficulties involved in any other course. It was unlikely that we should meet with any success if we urged the Sheikh to accept any British political adviser like Mr. Belgrave at Bahrein. The Sheikh, however, had a great affection and admiration for the British Navy and would be much less likely to raise objection to the establishment of a naval station in his territory. Mr. Rendel suggested that full use ought to be made of this circumstance. Major Grover asked whether this object could not be fulfilled by more frequent naval visits to Kov/eit. Mr. Rendel and Captain de G-aury pointed out that this would not achieve the same purpose. What was required was the frequent presence of British sailors on shore. At present there were no facilities for the men from His Majesty’s sloops to land at Koweit. If, however, certain amenities could be set up for them, e.g. a canteen and a football ground, the men could land frequently, they would become a familiar sight in the bazaars, and the psychological effect would be considerable. It would in fact go a long way to make it plain that His Majesty’s Government took a direct interest in Koweit, and would not tolerate any foreign interference there. This was not plain at present to the mass of the popuilst ion, even though the Sheikh and certain foreign Governments might be aware of it. Mr. Walton suggested that the best way of establishing our/our influence with the' Sheikh would he to obtain satisfaction for him over the date gardens and over the Saudi blockade. i-^ndol reminded the meeting of some of the overwhelming difficulties which had been encountered in the way of obtaining a settlement of these two. .questions. Unfortunately, owing to the mistakes of our predecessors, we were on extremely weak ground over the date gardens question, which had been badly compromised in 1924, when it had been omitted from the list of international obligations taken over by Iraq. As regards the Saudi blockade, we had no means of forcing the Saudi Government to reopen trade with Koweit, while the Saudi suspicions had a good deal of excuse. Mr. Walton said that, however weak our ground might be Xl-S -a- vis Iraq over the date gardens, it was up to His Majesty’s Government to keep their promise to the Sheikh. Mr. Rendel s&amp;id that he did not dispute this, but pointed out that the cost involved might be enormous, and that the Treasury were the department primarily concerned. In any case, whenever efforts were made to obtain a satisfactory settlement from the Iraqis they always retorted by referring to.the question of smuggling. Whoever was ultimately responsible for the smuggling, there was no doubt that the Koweitis did very well out of it. Mr. Walton said that we had been informed that the smugglers were Iraqis (Captain de Gaury confirmed that this is so). Surely it was for the Iraqis to take whatever steps they thought proper to deal with their own nationals, and if they were unwilling or unable to do so, it was unfair to put the whole onus on the Sheikh of Koweit. Mr. Rendel replied that the Iraqi Government were in a difficult position, as they were a weak Government without much authority. They could of course blockade Koweit,■but that would hardly bring about a solution. Mr..-, Valton suggested that a solution could best be sought bj/ co-operation between the Governments of irso and Koweit. ihe Sheikh as a result of his visit to this country in 1935.had already agreed to certain stepso In reply to a question from Mr. Seal ? Mr. Ren del pointed out tnat it was much easier for Saudi Arabia to blockade Koweit than for Iraq. The nearest Saudi Arabian markets for smuggled goods were hundreds of miles away across difficult deserts, but there were many places in Iraq where smuggled goods could be sold, e.g. Zubair, Basra, hejef, Kerbela etc., all of which were moderately accessible. In his opinion, smuggling could only be checked with the willing cooperation of the Sheikh, or with the assistance of British administrative advisers. But whatever was done about the smuggling, it seemed clear that a closer British control over Koweiti affairs was required. The discussion then reverted to the question of the proposed naval station. The alternatives appeared to be (l) the establishment of a regular fortified naval base, (2) the establishment of a small station consisting mainly of a canteen and recreation ground, and (3) more frequent visits of His Majesty’s sloops without any increased shore facilities. Mr. Rendel pointed out that he had never intended to suggest alternative (l)- If alternative (2) were adopted (l) could no doubt be developed later on if this were found necessary. But he entirely agreed that it was unnecessary and would be unduly expensive at present. As regards alternative (3) C a p t a in d e _.G a.uny pointed out/■ ■ out that it would have no advantage over the present situation, since there were no facilities for men to land. What was required was the familiarisation of the inhabitants of Koweit with the sight of British sailors, etc. It was agreed that in these circumstances the most useful alternative appeared to he (2) and Mr. Rendel and Captain de G-aury both strongly supported this, emphasising the psychological and political advantages which might follow from it. The Admiralty representatives, however, were not convinced and asked for time to consider the matter further. The question was then considered of how far there was in fact any real danger of the Sheikh of Koweit accepting the overlordship of Saudi Arabia or Iraq_, and shaking himself from British influence. Mr. Rendel pointed out that our treaty relationship with the Sheikh was at present vague and uncertain. There was no clear and comprehensive treaty binding him to the British connexion, and we might find ourselves on very poor legal ground for objecting if he were to confront us with a fait accompli . Mr. Rendel considered that it was by no means impossible that the Sheikh might negotiate a secret agreement with Ibn Saud, accepting Saudi suzereignty but retaining a large measure of autonomy. While Ibn Saud was unlikely to fall in with such a suggestion at present, he might easily do so if matters went wrong in Palestine and Anglo-Saudi relations were to deteriorate. Were we to be confronted with such a treaty, our position would be very difficult, and it might be practically impossible to recover our position in Koweit without the use of force or without quarrelling with Ibn Saud. nolonel Osborne asked whether it was really essential that/ vr \S that we should maintain our position in Koweit at all. —h-h nc ^el replied that the whole discussion hitherto had proceeded on the assumption that we could not afford to abandon Koweit or to allow any other power to occupy it. This had been an old established principle of British policy and had even led to acute controversy with Germany before the War. If, however, the War Office wished to call this principle in question, perhaps the best plan would be to refer the matter to Chiefs of Staff Committee as had been done in the case of the Yemen, so tnat we might be sure that we were working on sound premises. a premise of the argument hitherto had been that it was essential that we should maintain our position in Koweit. Mr. Rum-bold said that he doubted whether a reference to the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee would carry us further. Whatever the decision on the strategic aspect of the question it was essential that we should maintain our position in Koweit for political reasons. We could not allow Saudi Arabia or Iraq to absorb Koweit because of the reactions of any such event on the attitude towards us of our other Arabian protected states in the Gulf. If we abandoned Koweit our position in Bahrein, Qatar, and the Trucial coast was likely to be seriously weakened. Mr. Rendel further pointed out that we were already committed to protect Koweit by land. Further if oil were found in paying quantities in Koweit, as now seemed probable, it seemed of great importance that we should maintain our hold on the principality, since it might prove a most important source of oil for the British Navy in time of war, particularly if anything were to go wrong in Southern/Southern Persia. Sfluadron-Leader Jope Slade asked what Mr. Rende! had m mind when he suggested the establishment of an air base in Koweit. re Plied that what he contemplated was something corresponding to the proposed naval station - i.e. an aerodrome and a few sheds with a canteen and a petrol store. He did not contemplate a fortified hase, hut some kind of station which could he developed if necessary, and which would give us a right to he there and enable us to show the flag. Prom the strategic point of view it seemed that it might he very useful to maintain an air station at Koweit so as to insure against trouble in Iraq.* Although the range of aircraft was no doubt becoming longer, and Koweit might perhaps not he easily defensible if a definite attack were launched against us in Iraq, it might nevertheless be very useful to have an air station under entirely British control at this point on the route to India, if at any time serious internal disorder were to break out in Iraq, or the security of our normal communications were otherwise threatened. For example, landing and refuelling facilities in Iraq might easily become precarious, while in Koweit we were free to establish a station under our complete and permanent control where we should be able to take our own steps to maintain order and security in case of need. Mr. Seal reverting to the question of the proposed naval establishment said that he did not see that this would affect the situation. What mattered in his view was our prestige in the East. If our position were strong theSheikh would he loyal to his British connexion in any case, while if it were weak the naval station would not make any difference. —— tenael ^Plied that, although our international prestige was an important factor, the actual presence of British sailors on Koweiti soil would prohahly make a more direct appeal to the population of the principality. Moreover, it seemed to him that the situation might easily he a very evenly balanced one where a very small factor might tip the scale« At present there was practically nothing to show our authority in Koweit. We could not, in his view, hope to maintain our position there against the various risks which threatened it with so small and inadequate an establishment. Mr. Seal suggested that the proper way to ensure our position in Koweit was to make it clear to the Sheikh that we were strong, and that we would not stand any nonsense. His view was that it was a bad mistake to try and run backward areas such as the Gulf on League of Nations’ principles.. Mr. Rendel pointed out that Koweit - unlike the Persian Islands in the Persian Gulf was a place where we had a legal claim to establish ourselves. ¥e could now establish ourselves there without violating any international principle, and quite consistently with our general policy. If, however, v/e waited indefinitely the position might become much more difficult. Mr. Rumbold said that the India Office considered a canteen, etc., might well be useful, but as part of a policy, the other part of which would be the pressing on with our efforts to redress the Sheikh’s legitimate grievances./Igrievances. It was eventually agreed (i) that Mr. Seal should submit the results of the discussion to the authorities m the Admiralty and ascertain their views as to the possibility of setting up some kind of naval establishment in Koweit, ( 2 ) that, if the Admiralty were prepared to consider the matter further, the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf should be consulted by air mail the India Office simultaneously consulting the Political Resident in the Gulf end the Government of India and ( 3 ) that Squadron Leader Jope-Slade should similarly discuss with the Air Ministry the question of a possible establishment of an aerodrome and landing and refuelling facilities. It was agreed that if the matter were further proceeded with, the next step after receiving the views of the local authorities, would be for it to be considered by the Middle East Sub Committee.i/^ ^ \ jr No. c/171 of 1337, £• &gt; The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presents his compliments to 1* ^ ie llon, ’3 -g I»t.-Col, 1 .fareone, C;!',D60. , Secretary to the Soverrjnenf of In data, internal Affairs Ifepartr:ient ^' 2# Captain 3**i,de Gaui v ?

As the meeting was an informal one I am making my comments deai-officially^ — A /, ;tK' : • 2. With regard to my discussion with Poland - the Senior / * C/163 Naval Officer - I enclose a copy of a demi-official letter 16th ;ust 1937, which I think puts the matter clearly from m point of view* 3. H end el in his Memorandum and at tne Interdepartmental Meeting advanced views which can X think be s^uarised as follows. In the first place he emphasised tne importance of Kuwait from tne political and strategical aspect. I entirely agree with this. Ae ftendel rerain ed tne Meeting we are already consaitted to the defence of Kuwait by land. X originally put forward the view that we were so committed (vide paragraphs « 7 - 11 of ray demi-official letter ho. 1365-0 of the 25th October 1933 to Secretary of 3tate for andia, copy forwarded to the Government of India under Printejd Letter djo* 1366-3 of same date). fhe India Office concurrejd (vide paragraphs 4 and 5 of tneir letter no.P.^.7633/33 of the 1st February 1934 to / J.C. ?alton isquire, the / The India Office, London. r U5 . / - 2 - y the Foreign Ofrice} # as aid tae Foreign Office (Tide paragraph 7 of their letter no* 776/739/91 of the 24tn ’ebrufery 1334 to the India Office). I presume that this constitutes a decision hy His ?f&amp;J esty*s aoTerwaent, and that the Service departments, tho would have to carry out the defence, realise their res ponsibilities in this direction 7 If there is any doubt on this important point I suggest that it be el eared up. Apart from this commitment Kuwait is strategically and politically important as its frontiers run with those of 4 Iraq ani isudi Arabia* It is also on ths British air route to India and beyond (the (lulf is now the ** Sues Oanal of the Air 11 ), and the possibility of oil being found there adds to its importance, especially in view of the fact that the other main supply of oil in the uulf, with the exception of Bahrain, is situated in a foreign country - Iran. (Bendel stressed this point)• 4. On the subject of Kuwait Oil Rend el remarked (paragraph 9 of his Memorandum) s *The fact that British oil interests allowed an American oil company to obtain so large a snare in exploiting the oil possibilities of Kuwait has considerably strengthened the lhaikh’s hands-. mether this ms, or has not, strengthened the Shaikh’s hands surely tne responsibility is not entirely that of British oil interests V men the dulf (American) Oil Company competed for the Kuwait concession with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company His Majesty’s Government decided not to stand on the linaikn’s agreement with them that he would not give an oil concession witno it their sanction, and permitted free competition. tf His Majesty’s Government had told the Hhaikh that we required him to give the concession to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company he would nave done so. ( I pointed this out at an interdepartmental Meeting held on October 5th 1933}. /7. / «t -3- S. Henkel furtn«r adrocat^ci tna t a zaore tor ward policy anould be adopted in Kuwait witn tne following o^j@cta ? A. To obtain more control over the anai^n of , Kuwait. B. To prevent tne a be or pt ion of Xu wa i t by eitner 1 Iraq or laudi Arabia* C* To provide an alternative air base at Kuwait in tne event of our position in ’Iraq bein' materially impa ired* As a first step in tnis forward policy K end el sogcreated the establishment at Kuwait of a small Maval Htati^n consist ing of a canteen and recreation ground, arid a itoyal Air Korce base corresponding in siae to tne B&amp;val Station* 6 * Witn regard to tne purpose underlying A. As I under stand it Kendal’s chief end in advocating more control over tne Shaikh was for us to be in a position to induce tne latter to come to terms with * Tr&amp;q and Saudi Arabia on tne various questions! Blockade, juggling etc* over wnicn tnere is dis agreement. I agree with Rend el that it la unfortunate that these differences should exist, but I also entirely agree with the India Office views las given by you at tne Keating) that the best way of establishing our influence over tne Shaikh would be to implement our promise and assurance to tne latter in the matter of the Date Dardens and the Daudi Blockade respect ively. If it is a case of bargaining, that is to say if for example of his own free will in order to induce the Iraqis to settle the Date Darden question the Shaikh is prepared to assist in tne smuggling, then that is one thing. I am, however, definitely opposed, a® you are aware, to bringing pressure on the &gt;haikh for the benefit of eitner ’Iraq or aaudi Arabia without his obtaining ah? corresponding benefit for himself.7• Hth regard to ttte first step in a forward policy tnftt Hendel proposes in order to attain his three objects, i*e. the establishment of small j» a val and Koyal Air Force stations with canteen and recreation facilities. 1 am afraid that I entirely disagree with Hendel, (with whom de &lt;*&amp;ury apparently generally concurred), that the establishment of such stations would have any practical effect at all towards the desired objects, while his view that by the presence of these ht&amp;tione ’’the psychologic eal effect would be considerable* seeaa to me definitely far fetched. ~nfty years ago there might have been something in Bendel's general contention that in order to support Britisn rights and interests in Kuwait one must necessarily have a snow of armed force there, but this is hardly the case to-day. 8 . To turn in detail to the objects which Kendel nas in view. 4 . More control over the ana ikh« Whatever may be the purpose to which tnis control ie put (see paragraph 6 above) personally i cannot see that the Stations will nave any effect whatever on the Shaikh towards this end. As I have pointed out before the Rulers of the Arab Coast, (and particularly the Shaikh of Kuwait), are no longer in the '.bead and bludgeon 11 age, when they could be successfully cajoled by the offer of a bag of beads in one hand, and a flourish from a thick stick in the other. They are fully alive to the fact that they are living in post- Var not pro- far days. They know something about the principles of the League of hat ions, and the moral rights of small States. in particular they are well conversant with their Treaties with His 'iaj esty * s iovernment, and nave a pretty shrewd guess as to what the latter can, and more particularly wnat they can’t, do to them. This being so i cannot /cannot see wnat over-awing effect ( if tnis is Kendel aeana) the ^frequent presence of British sailors on shore'* proceeding peacefully on tneir lawful occasions to play foot ball on their recreation ground, or to slaice their thirst at the canteen, would nave either on tne Hhai&amp;h or his people* fe have got not a sta&amp;ll, but a fairly large, liaval Base at Bfihrain and an important aerodroiae and fortified Kest house J0 at Sharjah, but these are mere facilities and give me as Resident no more ‘♦control* over the hiaikns of Bahrain and Sharjah than I had before they existed. The same would be the case with any similar facilities obtained at Kuwait. 9* (1). B. The prevention of the absorption of Kuwait by either ♦Iraq or Saudi Arabia. X naturally entirely agree that this danger would ma&amp;e our position in Kuwait vis a via either of these two Powers a by different to wnat it is now. we are not dealing with a parcel of Saudi or Iraqi Bedouin tribes who might be impressed by a show of armed force in Kuwait, but with the Governments of two countries in treaty relations with His Majesty's Government, who are perfectly aware of our position in that Htate. Our insurance against tne absorption of Kuwait by either of these two Powers does not - in my opinion - rest on the establishment of a local show of armed forces but on the fact that both tne Powers concerned Know t that by our Agreements with tne anaiicn we nave a very special position tnere, which position we intend to maintain, ana that if necessary we are /- ■ prepared /prepared to protect Kuwait by force (see para- grapn 2 abore). (2). In connection with this danger of absorption the following remarks of K end el at tne Meeting tnougn they were not &lt;iiecursed, appear to me to raise a very serioue isaaei , * Mr &gt; nandel pointed out that our treaty relationship witn the jmiicn wa@ at present vague and uncertain, there was no clear and comprehensive treaty binding aim to the British connexion, and we might find our selves on very poor legel ground for object ing if he were to confront ue with a fait feccompl i « Mr* ; end el considered that it was by no means imposeibie that the ahai&lt;h might negotiate a secret agreement with I bn daud, accepting a&amp;udi auz er;^ inty but retaining a large measure of autonomy, While I bn tfaud was unliicely to fall in with such a sugges tion at present, he mit&gt;ht easily do so if matters went wrong in Palestine and Anglo- Baudi relations were to deteriorate* vere we to be confronted with sucna treaty, our position would be very difficult, and it might be practically impossible to recover our position in Kuwait without the use of force or without quarrelling with Ibn baud** I do not know Whether His Majesty’s rovernment agree with Hendel's assumption that the two Kulers in question could make such a treaty. Personally I feel inclined /inclined to doubt it. the position &amp;s regards our control over the foreign relations of Kuwait was dealt with in paragraphs 3 - 5 of my letter jso. 191-3 of tne btn mrcn 1950 to Metcalfe, particularly in paragraph D of that letter, there is the gap in our control referred to therein - tn&amp;t tne ohaUcn, uni lice tne Hulere of tne other ■'m ikndoms, can coimaunicate with foreign Hulers, but it is a long step from that to his having the power to make a treaty such as K end el suggests, and I should have thought that the Bhahen’s obligations to us as outlined in paragraph 5 of my letter just quoted prevented him by implica tion from entering into any such agreement, lee idee these definite obligations there are the points noted by Ryan in paragraph 2 (a) (b) and (c) of his &amp;ote of 51st January 1956 enclosed with Jedda jointed setter Mo.255/5»0/27 of tne 4 tn February 1955 . A decision by iiis majesty’s dovemment as to whether tne Shaikh can or cannot make a treaty with Ibn Baud, or for the matter of that with any other Foreign Ruler, should I suggest be come to as soon as possible. A reference to tne Law Officers of the Crown might be advisable I s I may add that it the Shaikh of Kuweit can make treaties with Foreign Rulers so, it seems to me, can all the ocner Arab Rulers of the Gulf - unless Kendel bases his view solely on the fact that the Shaikh of Kuwait can communicate with Foreign Rulers, since in other respects their obligations to us are the same ns Kuwait, no more and no less. (Resides tne gap referred /referred to above tnere is tfte exception tnat iritish subjects nave not tne rignt to live in Kuwait - vide paragraph 2 (a) of my letter no*do7r^ of tne 7th July 1936 to Metcalfe, copy sent to tne India Office under .Printed hette.' ^o.od 6-2 of same date - and that we have no Slave treaty with Kuwait, but tnese have no bearing on tne present issue). It may be, nowerer, tmt H end el bases nis view on the fact that our relations with Kuwait consist of various agreements instead of a '’clear and comprehensive treaty’*. I agree tnat a treaty would be tidier, and perhaps more imposing, but surely the present agreements are equally binding on tne gnaiicn so far as tney go ? i If Ills Majesty’s government, however, decide that our agreements do not prevent the Shaikh from m&amp;lcing treaties with .foreign Powers, I do not quite aee how the establishment of email iaval and Eoyal Air tforce stations is going to help us materially. Our action, X imagine, would r&amp;tner taice the line of trying to rectify our Agreements. G. fhe establishing of an alternative air base at Kuwait in tne event of our position in 1 Iraq being materially Impaired. It may be that this eventuality may come to Pase, but a Haval station does not enter into t his picture. As far as the establishment now of a small Koyal Air Force base is concerned, this seems to be a matter for tne Koyal Air Force to decide having regard to tneir share of the responsibility’ for tne defence of Kuwait (see parsgrapn 3 above), and to the desirability of obtaining an option fora la ger Station in case land for tnia zaignt not at some future date be available e.g. by reason or its acquisi tion by tne Kuwait uil Compart/. i‘nis aspect of tne qj estion was conveyed to tae Air ministry, w&amp;o are of tne opinion tnat tnere is ample accosaaodat ion totn for the Oil Qompany and tneiaselves (viae correspondence ending wi tn India Office telegram 221 oC tne 22nd January iy57) m d t oat tnerefore no action seems necessary at present, 11. tfrom wnat I have written my personal views *ill be obvious: that if Maval and/or Hoy&amp;l Air Force utations are establisned at Kuwait this action a nould be taicen purely on strategic or recreational grounds, of which tne Naval and \ #*****• / x |v6 VjL Rcyal Air iforoe autHori«i«8 are tne beet judgee, since I am not I of opinion that the establishment of such stations would nave &amp;r?y material political effect. 12. At tne Meeting neid on October otn 1^53 (already referred to) ftendel drew attention to tne fact tnat in tne event of serious aisgovernment by tne Ruler of Kuwait such as prejudicially to affect foreign citizens in Kuwait, we might find ourselves in a difficult position ris a vis tne foreign Power concerned. Tnia n&amp;s now been met by tne Kuwait Order- in- Council of mb by which the subjects of non- Moslem Foreign Powers (it was American subjects waoa we had particularly in mind in view of possible oil developments ) are definitely put under the jurisdiction of the Political Agent. #ith regard to the gap in our control referred to in paragraph 9 (2) above: tmt tne Shaikh, unlike tne Kulers of tne other tfhaikhdoma, can cosnunioate with Foreign Halers. When tne Trade Agreement between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia is concluded this gap will be . filled /filled (vide correspondence ending jrith India Office letter .74P9/36, dated tne 29tn October 19316}• the presence of an ’Iraqi Post Office in Kuwait, wdicn of course is most undesirable, was not Brougnt up at tile Meeting# As you are aware, after amen effort on tne part of all concerned to find a substitute, tnis Post Office is being replaced by a British one* (See correspondence ending witn India Of lice letter **o.

(e) Certain steps In tne way of &amp; quiet forward policy at Kuwait, nave already been ta&amp;e'i, and I do not tninic anything of a more forward nature is either necessary or desirable (paragraph 12 ). (f) I presume that iiie Majesty's Government nave finally decided tnat they responsible for the defence of Kuwait. If, however, there is ary doubt on this important point I suggest it Should be cleared up (paragraph 3). (g) I also suggest that a definite decision should be made on the serious issue as to whether tne hhaiicia of Kuwait, navin** regard to his obligations to us under his treaties and our special position in Kuwait can or cannot make ;reat iss with foreign Powers (paragraph 9 (!})• 1 am sending copies of this letter to Parsons ana de Saury, Yours sincerely, sd* T.C.Fowle.Resident .... so far as may be practicable, on each specific occasion, and subject to the further restriction that there shall be no question of establishing a 'permanent base in Koweit territory.” As the result of considerable further interdepartmental discussion, the Air Officer Commanding was authorised on the 25th September, at his discretion, to carry out occasional leconnaissances over Koweit territory, both by air and car. His Majesty s Government aie anxious, however, that— ( 1 ) These reconnaissances shall be carried out as infrequently and in as unprovocative a manner as possible, and (2) That the Sheikh shall be given no ground for supposing that responsi bility for the defence of Koweit has been assumed by His Majesty's Government, or that he himself has been relieved of his obligations in this respect. These considerations should be borne in mind by the Air Officer Commanding in acting under the authority now given him.” (Colonial Office telegram to Bagdad, No. 306, dated the 25th September, 1928.) 3 . Approval was subsequently given in view of a threatened Akhwan raid over the border, to the concentration, subject to the approval of the Sheikh, of armoured cars in Koweit 1 ‘ for protection of Iraqi tribes for soJ.ong a period as one month.” (Colonial Office telegram to Bagdad, No. 76, dated the 23rd February, 1929.) , G |g 4 . In April 1929 the question of the policy to be adopted by the Sheikh of Koweit in the event of Nejdi tribesmen taking refuge from King Ibn Saud in Koweit territory arose, the air authorities suggested that the Sheikh should be asked to concur in the use, if necessary, of military force, the nature and extent of which should be determined by the Air Officer Commanding. Iraq, for the purpose of preventing any such refugees from entering or remaining in any part of Koweit territory. On the 8 th May, 1929, the India Office, in a letter to the Colonial Office, remarked: “Viscount Peel gathers that the attitude of the Sheikh is no longer in question and that he has already promised to endeavour to prevent refugees making use of Koweit territory. As regards the question of giving the Sheikh military assistance for this purpose, the Secretary of State remains of his previous opinion that it is undesirable to extend in any way the general liability hitherto accepted by His Majesty’s Government for the defence of Koweit territory, if this can at all be avoided It would, on the whole, be preferable, if possible, to avoid asking the Sheikh to concur in the use of military force, but if ... . such a request is still essential, he is prepared to agree that the Sheikh should be asked to concur ” The other Departments regarded it as essential to make a request in the sense referred to of the Sheikh and the necessary instructions were sent to the High Commissioner on the 11 th May. 5. The view held as regards our liability for protection of Koweit during the operations of 1928-29 is perhaps best stated in the India Office letters of the 22nd August, 1928, and the 8 th May, 1929, quoted in paragraphs 2 and 4 above. While our precise liability for protection was not investigated in any great detail, the course of action adopted in dealing with threats to Koweit territory appears to have been generally consistent with the construction of our liability suggested by Colonel Fowle in paragraph 10 of Bushire despatch No. 1365-S of the 25th October, 1933.0) India Office, February 6 , 1934.

C. Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Mr. J. G. Laithwaite, India Office. EASTERN (Arabia). CONFIDENTIAL. / * j ^ « ! • i C 934 The meeting had before it Sir Andrew Ryan’s note of the 16th August, regarding the attitude of King Ibn Saud towards Koweit (see Appendix A). Mr. Rendel outlined the present political situation of Koweit. The Sheikh was tied to His Majesty’s Government by his treaty engagements, but at the same time was being courted both by Ibn Saud and by Iraq. It was clear that the sheikhdom was not in a position which in the ordinary way would enable it to stand alone either as a political or as an economic entity, and that it must there fore depend on some stronger Power. He understood that it was the policy oi His Maiesty’s Government, in view of the strategic importance of Koweit, not to allow it to be absorbed by any foreign Power, but, so far as was possible, to maintain their present treaty relationship with the Sheikh. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that Koweit was at the present moment of more vital importance to His Majesty’s Government than it had been at any time, since it had bulked so prominently as the terminus of the Bagdad Railway before the war This was the result first of the development of the air route to India and Australia, which had made the Gulf as important imperially from the air stand point as was the Suez Canal for naval reasons, and, secondly owing to the expira tion of the mandatory regime in Iraq and the uncertainty of the future relations of His Majesty’s Government with that country. So long as Iraq had been undei British control, there had been a natural tendency to give it prior consideration and the less important question of Koweit had been kept comparatively m the background. But now that Iraq had attained full independence, the position was changed and Koweit had once again assumed major importance. Geographically, Koweit occupied a key position at the head of the Persian Gulf, and one from which the Gulf could be controlled. In the event of war we could probably safely assume that Koweit would be on our side and her territory would afford us a base of operations of definite value, to the use of which, on the assumption in que stl «u, no objection could be raised on the ground that we were violating hei neuteality. Further, with the development of the Arabian coast air route to the Past Koweit was likely to prove more and more vital as a station on that route, es P“ia!ly H ou relations with Iraq should at any time become so strained that we were unable to rely on the use of the Iraqi aerodromes for the purposes of that route. Colonel Fowle suggested that in point of fact it might one d a ybe possible to avoid the use of Iraq altogether, and fly direct from Palestine to Koweit, as the range of the aircraft using the Arabian route mcreasea. Mr. Rendel concurred with Mr. Laithwaite's estimate of the position as regards Trao In view of recent events m Iraq it was possible that our wnc relationshipswith that country might have to be m° dified &gt; both the future of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty and of the A^e Force in Iraq must be regarded as doubtful. On t g p [935 1—X]2 i ■ V\o V»nrnp m minci Wets tilt? fetet that !Kow 6 it observed that one of the main poi - tt geographical or the economic point was not naturally independent '‘d fu? off at present by the Iraqi and of view.

Moreover, even its present denied free communication w i , ^ of the g aud i p 0r t at Has Tanura trade might be jeopardised by Ae develop the Hasa coast what I under the auspices of the American oil concessit, was ^ was even more important was that its tresn^ x wag for considerationi its own territory, nut had , t j a ble for His Majesty’s Government therefore, whether it would, its neighbours! at anv rate on th^present basistf ^ rlther loo^e and iU-dlfined dependence on His Majesty’s Government. Colonel XXkh£T He pointedout 6 howe^ei^ha? Koweit had IK^nflu^wWch by controlling Koweit’s fresh water supply it was also powerful enough to bring pressure to bear upon Koweit over for instance, the question of smuggling. Mr. Rendel agreed that both S»S^^esS^^di Arabia disintegrated. The nrelent Ssition of Koweit between these two States was weak, and Sir Andrew Rvan’s note showed how powerful an attraction Ibn Sand could exer The nnestion therefore was whether His Majesty's Government would not be well hviS to develop and tighten up their own relations with Koweit in order to strengthen its position. It had, in fact, been suggested that it might be more fdvTftageous to convert our present treaty relationship into a definite protectorate on for instance the analogy of the Hadramaut, which was now regarded as part of’the Aden Protectorate, but where our treaty relationship with the local rulers ■iiirl obligations to afford them protection had been if anything looser than those wehad towards Koweit Would not a protectorate ensure Koweit more effectively against absorption than the present attempt to maintain the sheikhdom as a kind of political vacuum in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Laithwaite drew attention to three points (a) At present the obligations of His Majesty’s Government to Koweit were represented by their undertaking to grant ’ good offices m respect of Koweit under the 1899 agreement, by their promise of 190/ that tne town of Koweit and its boundaries belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us-buba, Ruler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him,' and their undertaking of the 3rd November, 1914, that Koweit, in the event of a victory over the Turks, would be recognised by us as an independent princi pality under British protection. They were thus very general in terms, and, in accordance with our normal policy on the Arab littoral, which dated from a period in which it was possible to protect a sea port by action from the sea, but not to afford effective help inland, we had consistently endeavoured to limit our obligations, save as regards “good offices” to Koweit town and the immediately adjoining area. Recent experience had, however, shown that in cases of intervention from outside it was in fact necessary to give the Sheikh, at our discretion, and on our own terms, a measure of active assistance up to the limit of his frontiers and with the development of aircraft the problem of inland defence was now less difficult. This was to some extent a strengthening of his strict treaty position, as also possibly an extension of our strict treaty obligations. (b) With regard to the suggested establishment of a protectorate, it was necessary to consider what the reactions of the Sheikh would be, and also what effect the proclamation of a protectorate might have on the other Arab rulers of the Gulf. It would in any case be wiser not to make an overt proclamation of this nature, since both in Bahrein and in Qatar and along the Trucial Coast it would probably rouseTFLEG-PAM.

L«®?®-REC01D OF A MEETING HELD AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER 5TH TO DISCUSS RELATIONS BETWEEN HIS MAJESTY 1 S GOVERNMENT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE SHEIKH OF KOWEITo The following were present at the meeting: Mr* G.W. Rendel, (in the Chair) ^ Foreign Office Mr* K.R. Johnstone ( Sir A* Ryan, His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda. Lieutenant-Colonel T„C. Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Mr. J„G. Laithwaite, India Office. The meeting had before it Sir Andrev/ Ryan’s note of the 16th August, regarding the attitude of King Ibn Saud towards Koweit (see Appendix A). MR. RENDEL outlined the present political situation of Koweit. The Sheikh was tied to His Majesty's Government by his treaty engagements, but at the same time was being courted both by Ibn Saud and by Iraq. It was clear that the Sheikhdom was not in a position which in the ordinary way would enable it to stand alone either as a political or as an economic entity and that it must therefore depend on some stronger Pov/er.

MR. LAITHWAITE/MR, LAITHWAITE suggested that Kovireit Y/as at the present moment of more vital importance to His Majesty's Government \ than it had 'been at any time since it had hulked so promin ently as the terminus of the Baghdad railway before the war. This was the result first of the development of the air route to India and Australia* which had made the Gulf as important imperially from the air standpoint as was the Suez Canal for naval reasons* and secondly ov/ing to the expira tion of the mandatory regime in Iraq and the uncertainty of the future relations of His Majesty’s Government with that country 0 So long as Iraq had been under British control, i there had been a natural tendency to give it prior con sideration and the less important question of Koweit had been kept comparatively in the background« But nov/ that Iraq had attained full independence* the position was changed and Kov/eit had once again assumed major importance. ?

COLONEL FOWLE suggested that in point of fact it night one day he possible to avoid the use of Iraq, altogether and fly direct from Palestine to Koweit, as the range of the aircraft using the Arabian route in creased. MR. RENDEL concurred with Mr. Laithwaite’s estimate of the position as regards Iraq. In view of recent events in Iraq it was possible that our whole relationship with that country might have to be modified and he considered that both the future of the Anglo-Iraqi treaty and of the position of the Royal Air Force in Iraq must be regarded as doubtful. On the general point at issue, he observed that one of the main points to be borne in mind was the fact that Koweit v^as not naturally inde pendent from either the geographical cr the economic point of view. It was a port without a hinterland, cut off at present by the Iraqi and Saudi frontiers from the territory which it 'would naturally feed, and at present denied free communication with the country behind it. Moreover, even its present trade might be jeopardised by the development of the Saudi port at Ras Tanura under the auspices of the American oil concessionaires on the Hasa coast. Y/hat was even more important was that its fresh-water supply was not derived from its own territory, but had to be imported from Iraq. It Y/ns for considera tion therefore whether it Y/ould in fact be practicable for His Majesty’s Government to maintain the independence of Koweit as against its neighbours, at any rate on the present basis of a rather loose and ill-defined dependence on His Majesty’s Government. COLONEL FOWLE/4, tion COLONEL POV/LE concurred generally in Mr 0 Rendel 1 s description of the economic position of the SheikMem He pointed out ; however 3 that Koweit had always been the port of the deserts of northern Arabia^ as Bahrain was the port 01 Central Arabia* In regard to the rosj of Koweit vis-a-vis cl Iracjj he added that beside the influence which Iraq could exert by controlling Koweit f s fresh—water supp.iy, it was also powerful enough to bring pressure to bear upon Koweit ever* for instance* tne question ol siiiugglrnga MR. RENDEL agreed that both Iraq and Saudi Arabia were m a position to exert strong pressure on Koweit, This bcixig so* the rivalry betwnen them over Koweit was likely to increase* uniess ol course Saudi Arabia disintegrated. The present position of Koweit between these two States was weak and oir Andrew Ryan’s note showed how powerful an attraction Ihn Saud could exert. The question therefore was whether His Majesty’s Government would not be well advised to develop and tighten up their own relations with Koweit in order to strengthen its position 0 It had in fact been suggested that it night be more advantageous to convert our present treaty relationship into a definite protectorate* on, for instance* the analogy of the Hadramaut* which was now regarded as part o: ^xo lien Protectorate but w r here our treaty relationship with the local rulers and obligations to afford them protection had utnn if anything looser than these we had towards Koweit. would not a Protectorate ensure Koweit more effectively against absorption than the present attempt to maintain the Sheikhdom as a kind of political vacuum in the Persian Gulf, Mt. LAITHMITE drew attention to three points:-* (a)/5. (a) At present the obligations of Hie Majesty's Government to Koweit ware represented by tholr undertaking to grant 'good offices' in respect of Kowelt under the 1899 Agreement, by their premise of 1907 that “the town of '’Kowelt and its boundaries belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us- “Suba, Riler of Kcweit, and to his heirs after him' and their undertaking of 3rd November 1914 that Kowelt, in the event of a victory over -1218 mrka, would be recognised by us as an Indspcndent principality under British protec tion. Thay were thus v«ry general in terms, and, in ac cordance with our normal policy on the Arab littoral, which dated from a period in which it was possible to protect a sea port by action from the sea, but not to afford effective help inland, we had consistently endeavoured to limit cur obligations save as regards 'good offices' to Koweit town and the inraediately ad joining area. Recent experience had, however, shown that In cases of intervention from outside it was in fact lecessary to give the Sheikh, at our discretion, and on our own terms, a measure of active assistance up to the Limit of his frontiers and with the development of aircraft the problem of inland defence was now less difficult. This ma to sane extent a strengthening of his strict treaty position, as also possibly an extension of our strict treaty obligations. CJ— a^vJMh. •fcj (b) With regard to -the suggested establishment of a 3 rotectorats it was necessary to consider what the reactions 3f the Shaikh would be, and also wh&amp;t effect the proclama tion of a Protectorate mi$it have on the other Arab rulers xf the Gulf. It woul'i in any case be wiser not to make an jvert proclamation of this nature since both in Bahrain and ■ n Qht&amp;r and along the Truci&amp;l Cwist it would probably rouse apprehensions....r\i 6 . apprehensions Pnd might even cause the local Sheikhs to turn away from Ills Majesty's Government and consider sub mitting thetnas].vos to Persia or to Ibn Sand. (c) Hie basin of His Majesty's Government's present treaty relationship with Kowolt was unsatisfactory. In the first place it did not rest, as was tits case with Bahrein, Muscat and the Trucial Sheikhdoms, on a long series of formal treaties with the ffosildi dating back for over a century or, as in the case of Qatar, on a compre hensive treaty, but ms based ooly oa &amp; comparatively brief correspondence eschanged bstwem tlie £2ieikhs and His Majesty's Gavarcmeot since 1889 and an the reciprocal engagements, still presumably binding since they had not been abrogated, entered Into in connexion with tine lease of Bunder Shweikh in 180V; secondly there were certain gaps, o.g. we had no slavery agreement with Kcweit. It mig:ht, he suggested, be possible to fill in the gaps left by this eorrespcadence and tighten oar ccatrol in -that W» An example was cur recent reausst to the Sfceikh for certain undertakings in regard to air facilities in his Sheikhdom, one result of which would be to concentrata effective control of such facilities, whether military or civil, in the hands of His Majesty's Government. Another instance was the roctnt proposed aioendraent of the Koweit Grdsr-in-Council so as to place respcnsibilily for juris diction over non-Moslem foreigners in the hands of His Majesty's Government. A gradual tightening of our control of this character, particularly if pursued ae a definite policy on all convenient occaaicns, world, he thcaght, at ones avoid the difficulties involved in establishing a formal protectorate and would make it very imeh simpler.

In the lease 9^ land at Bander Shwaikh/l90Tj/article ten places a limit of 4/£ on the rate of customs that can be levied on goods imported or exported by British subjects without the previous consent of the ’’Imperial English Government”. Hitherto what has been the rate of customs duty levied on imports and does this new tax infringe the 1907 agreement? it.Col*H.R.P.Dickson,C.I.E., Political Agent, Kuwait» ''X/ 0 J r » i i b ■ * / &lt;y ' IS11 —'■ i l - 1 -■ ■ ‘ —Jr ' f ioXltioal Agmoy, Kuwait* Dated tiie S5th May 1931* Win you pleas© refer to your D*0*No*1006 dated 13tH i!ay 1931 regarding the jfp tax on imports recently imposed by His lixoellcaioy W&amp; Shaikh* 2* as a result of a talk, I had with His Excellency this morning (25th May 1931) on the subject, I do not think the now import tax infringes the 1907 agree- i mont for reasons given below and I feel certain the Shaikh would never have moved in the matter had he thought that it did* 3* The shaikh was of course Quite aware of i the wording of the treaty and paragraph 10, even though to refresh his memory I showed him the English and Arabic version* 4* In the fir at place, the Shaikh pointed out that the wording of the treaty, as far as he understood it imported forbade him to raise the duty on goods exported from or / into Kuwait by British subjects including British Indians. But that he was free to make on increase in the case of his own subjects should the state finances render this necossarj With this view I concur. ' b. Secondly the Shaikh assured me that al though there were about a dozen Indians all told making a living in Kuwait, only one soda-water manufacturer, exportec anything into Kuwait, and very occasionally an Indian who runs a flour mill here. The others were all people of the U barber, oculist and durzi type who imported or exported nothing* In spit© of this however he the Hhaikh had passed orders to the Director of Customs, that the extra ^ taxtox wgs In no case to be leviod from British subjects. He hed dona this the day the new tax was inaugurated, though lie had not thought it worth mentioning to mo. quite olear that the levying of the new tax of ^ originated from tlie I~uws.it merchants themselves t and was a sort of subscription to be taken from the rich of the town, to ease the lot of the many poor who today were finding it very hard to keep themselves alive, much less pay house tax. In other words the n well to clo' had codo f crward and offered to bear the burden of the city House Tax, provided mch house tax was abolished, end they considered that the easiest way of bringing this about was to ask the Shaikh to impose on themselves the merchant!Xe community the small additional burden of ^ over ©nd above the reasonable import duty they already paid. raised in yatr last paragraph.

Thirdly the Shaikh wished to make it 7. Fourth ly, and this replies to the question C IaT—12 c without our knowledge and consent. Eventually it was agreed that the most suitable occasion for the proposed representations to the Sheikh and Ibn Baud would be Ibn Baud’s letter suggesting terms for the settlement of the Saudi blockade of Koweit and warning the Sheikh against Kis Majesty’s Government c At the conclusion of the meeting SIR A 0 RYAN raised the Question of the pressure which might be exerted upon Ibn Baud in regard to the Saudi blockade of Koweit. This blockade had one of two purposes 5 either to complete the economic strangulation of Koweit and lead to its complete absorption in Saudi Arab;ia s or else the safeguarding of Saudi economic interests. His Majesty's Government could not Possioly allow the first of these alternatives. The Question therefore was what real force there was in Ibn Saud's suggestion that his own purely economic interests required the maintenance of the blockade. COLONEL FOWLE suggested that we might well revert to the Sheikh's proposal that Ibn Baud should have customs posts at a given place along but outside the Koweiti border, and that this might, if necessary, be coupled with a system of manifests for Koweiti-Saudi trade. He gave it as his opinion that even if Ibn Saud were to develop Ras Tanura, possibly with American help, this port was not likely to compete seriously with Koweit, which served quite a different hinterland, nor was there any port between the Koweit area and the Ras Tanura area which could be successfully developed as a rival to Koweit, COLONEL FOWLE suggested that on his return to the GulfGulf on 16th October ho should discuss the situation with Colonel Dickson* Political Agent, Kuweit* who had great experience of the sheikhdom, hi the light of the conversa tions at the present meeting, and should submit a compre hensive report. It was agreed that this course should be adopted, and that in the light of the Resident 1 s report and of the conclusions of the present meeting the question of future policy in Koweit should be discussed if necessary in the Iliddle East Official Sub-Committee 0 The conclusions of the meeting were as follows: (1) That in dealing with Ibn Baud, His Majesty’s Government should increasingly emphasize the closeness of their relations with the Sheikh 0 (2) That the Sheikh Sxhould be told that his personal correspondence with Ibn Saud on official matters was to cease c (3) That the issue of the Saudi blockade of Koweit should be taken up with Ibn Saud by His Majesty's Govern ment on the basis oi their obligation to protect the interests of Kcweitc (4) That on receipt of the despatch promised by Colonel Fowle the whole question of relations between His Majesty’s Government and Koweit might suitably be referred for further discussion to the Middle East Official Sub committee, to which a note should be sent recording the points discussed at the present meeting, and setting forth the arguments for and against the possible declaration of a protectorate«S ir rJidrew Ryan . 14. Hi)IX A. Ibn Baud's attitudo towards Kowait o I have been turning over in my mind for some time the possibility that it may be a definite object of Ibn Sand's policy to reduce Kowait to a position of dependence on him somewhat similar to that of asir from 1926 to 1950. This is in the nature of a pure speculation but it is a speculation so interesting that I think it worth while to collect the principal data bearing on it. It must be admitted at the outset that, if Ibn Sand had such an idea in his head, he would realise the need for great caution lest he should indispose Kis majesty's Government. His only formal obligation towards the latter is that contained in Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda but he understands very well the implications of the words therein n who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty’s Government'. On the other hand he has seen His Majesty's Government tolerate direct correspondence on business subjects between him and the Sheikh of Koweit. He might think that they would not react over strongly if he and the Sheikh confronted them with the fait accompli of a political deal. 2« Apart from the correspondence, of which we have knowledge, there has been other intercourse between the rulers, notably the Sheikh's visit to Riadh in 1932, the secret messages brought by Ibn Saud's confidential messenger to the Sheikh early this year and the Sheikh's mysterious dashes into Hejd last February, when Colonel Hickson surmised that he had gone to meet some high Saudi personage, possibly Ibn Baud himself. 5. I may interpolate, as a minor indication of Ibn Saud's I i (i I 'i ! attitude, a reference to two occasions on which it has been suggested or hinted by his Ministry of Foreign Affairs that His Majesty's15* iajesty's Gov.rnnent should not concern theuselves with allnirs hotween Saudi Arabia and Kowait. 1 class then as minor, oecause this position has never been categorically asserted, rne j.irst Y/as when, in. reply to a complaint of mine regarding Saudi encroachments on Kowait territory, wnich haa per cur* ecu ills hajesty’s Governnent, the reply was in effect: ’’Sorry you have been perturbed* You need not have been if the matter had b^en pursued through An. Ilafisi 1 '. On another occasion x'Uau ney, in rather light conversation, ashed me why we concerned ourselves in natters between his Government and r.owait. 4. ghe personal relations between the two rulers are peculiar. Ibn Gaud grew up at Kowait and it is sometimes said tnat no- nns shown himself ungrateful to his former hosts. It is saiu oy others, I do not know on what precise grounds, tnat i-aioarak treated Ibn Baud very badly, anyhow, through all the relations there runs a thread of old friendsnip, horever flimsy and however frayed by frequent friction over rains, the embargo and so on. It has helped towards the settlement of minor Questions, It has not deterred Ton Baud iron enforcing Gllu embargo on trade but the embargo on trade has not aesxroyed the Sheikh’s ostensible friendliness towards 1 on ! --aua. in ' y Y are ^hircades ,bfbo” as I once wrote and they both combine some real friendship for bis majesty’s Goverimient and a healthy fear of them with a good deal of fundamental nisxrust. 5. The point of my theory or speculation is that, ix the Sheikh of Kowait were at all willing to be lasirized', Ten Sana could make the proposal quite attractive on tne following lines, if I may venture to put into his mouth the sort of language he could use:- (a) ’’You are not really independent, my dear fellow, moa 51 are under the thumb of the mglisn. mney mignt annex you at ny16. ’’any moment or even present you to Iraq. If you must be ’’dependent on some one, why be dependent on those untrustv/orthy ’’imperialists, when you might depend, without being exactly ’’dependent, on a man like me, old friend, fellow Moslem, fellow 'Arab and the one big independent man in Arabia'&lt;&gt; (b) 'I don't like squeezing you, I really don't, with that 'embargo. As things are at present I have to think of my own 'interests. But if your interests were mine, we could easily 'have an understanding, m sort of ’Zollverein’ as they say: 'same duties levied in our ports; free competition between 'yours aid mine; free trade over our land border. 'That have 'the hnglish done about it? Nothing, because they cannot get 'at me. So is non frere, et .je te fais vivr e . Sois le leur, 'e t je te tue ''. (c) 'I should not mop you up of course. You would rule 'your state under an understanding with me. Indeed, if you 'were in with me, I might recognise a sort of influence of 'yours over those three Lost Tribes that you always want back. 'Look at how I treated the Idrisi. I made a sensible agreement 'with him in 1926. He remained a ruler with tribal influence. 'I did not take charge in his country, until he got into such 'a mess that he asked me to in 1950. I did not hit him on the 'head until the poor mutt thought he could try conclusions with 'me in 1952. He looked to foreigners and he got it in the neck 'from me' . (d) 'You have had trouble with Iraq over your property there. ' ’That has hngland been able or even willing to do for you? 'If I had the right to protect you against third parties, you 'would find that I knew how to see you through.' (e) ’'Then there's oil. People are after it in my country 'and in yours and in the Neutral Zone. Thy not have an agreed 'policy'policy and present a common front to the best.

Play about with Holmes, if you like. But don't trust him 'and remember that in the long run your best policy would be 'to deal like me direct with American interests, using the 'others to put up the price'. 6. It is easy enough to detect fallacies in the above imaginary address. I do not know enough about the Sheikh of Koweit to judge what his reaction to it would be but many an Arab, not well pleased with British protectors, might find it convincing enough to be attracted into Ibn Baud's parlour. 7. I wrote the above notes in Jedda at the end of June. I thought them too hypothetical at that time to submit them for official consideratioiio They may, however, be worthy oi some attention now that the Political Resident and I are both in this country and Colonel Dickson will soon be available for consultation, -xcept that Ibn Saud continues to shew a narked anxiety to avoid all complications, I see no material reason to modify what I wrote nearly three months ago, subject always to the consideration that I merely suggest an uncertain /forking theory to be tested by further examination and by seeping a close watch on future developments. iugust 16th, 1953.3/ A. Nature of the undertakings Riven . By the Agreement of 23rd January 1899 His fejesty’s Government formally assured the Sheikh 'of the good offices of the British Government towards you, your heirs and successors, so long as you, your heirs and successors scrupulously and faithfully observe the conditions of the said Bond', under which the Sheikh had pledged himself, his heirs and successors, not to receive the agent or representative of any power or government at Koweit without the previous sanction of the British Government and not to cede, sell, lease, or mortgage, or give for occupation or for any other purpose, any portion of his territory to the government or subjects of any other power without the previous consent of His Majesty’s Government. 2. By Article IX of the Secret Agreement of 15th October 1907 for the lease of the Bunder shweikh foreshore, the Political Agent intimated that he was 'duly authorised on behalf of the precious Imperial English Government to promise and do hereby promise that the town of Koweit and its boundaries likewise belong to sheikh IVbbarak-us-Suba, Buler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him, and that all Sheikh Mobarak’s arrangements in the natter of customs etc. and all his arrangements at the present day shall remain in the hands of Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, puler of Koweit, and of his heirs after him, and...' In consideration of this promise the Sheikh undertook not to levy customs dues in excess of 4% on goods imported or exported by 'the subjects of the aforesaid English Government' save with the approval of that 'Government.3* The undertakings given in writing to the sheikh on 3rd November 19i4 in return for his cooperation against the Turks contained an assurance that “Koweit shall he recognised as an independent principality under British protection.” B. Construction of the undertakings gi ven ~ To~the Sheikh . 4. As will he seen, the engagements entered into by His Majesty’s Government with the Sheikh are in rather general terms and it is perhaps desirable briefly to record the construction placed upon them at various times by His Haje sty’s Government. 3* In 1901, when there was a Turkish threat to Koweit the Viceroy was informed (Secretary of State’s telegram No•45 of 4th December 1901, p.1417/01) that this 'appears to constitute a distinct violation of the Sultan's promise” (to respect the status quo) 'and in these circumstances His Majesty’s Government are prepared to support the Sheikh and . will not tolerate an attack by Turkish troops or ships upon Koweit. The Sheikh should not leave Koweit and should continue to observe his engagement with us”. The assurance given is clearly limited by the words 'in these circumstances' to this particular case. Moreover, it is not conditional on and is independent of the sheikh’s observance of his Agreement of 1899. 3* On Blst March 1903 Lord Lansdowne, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in a Memorandum on the situation in Koweit remarked that #ur obligations towards the .Sheikh were ”as ill-defined as the boundaries of his Principality. We have distinctly announced that he does not enjoy British 'protection”; on the other hand we once made him a present of £1,000, and promised him our 'good offices” whatever that may mean. When we made this promise we were, I feel no doubt, thinking/thinking of Koweit proper, if there is such a thing,and. not of Boobyan or other outskirts over which the Sheikh has rights of one sort or another...We might it seems to me explain (1) to the Porte (2) to the Sheikh, and (3) to the foreign Powers immediately Interested the objects of our policy. I should be inclined to say that our engagements t* Koweit do not extend beyond the district adjoining or cluse to the bay of that name and to endeavour to obtain the adhesion of the Porte and of the Sheikh to our approximate definition of that district...' 7. Later in 1902 it was reported that Ibn Rashid was making energetic preparation for attacking Ibn Baud, then the Sheikh of Koweit 1 s friend, and the Sheikh was warned not to take any action likely to bring him into difficulties with either Nejd or Turkey. About the same time the sheikh informed us that IbniteshiA had with him a gun presented by the Turks and asked for a gift of 2 or 3 guns which it was understood were wanted for Jehara to protect Koweit against )2 land attack. The Viceroy (telegram No.39 of 3rd October 1902) proposed to reply that the Sheikh f s request could not he granted, 'but that provided he c omplied with the injunction conveyed to him in pursuance of your telegram of 4th December 1901 (see paragraph 5 above) His Majesty's Government would charge themselves with the defence of Koweit district.' The Secretary of State after consultation with the Foreign Office (F.O. letter of 13th October 1902) replied (telegram Mo.133 of 14th October 1902) 'I approve your proposed reply about the guns, provided Koweit district is clearly defined as the district adjoining or close to the bay of that name.' This assurance similarly admits of being read as an assurance M-ifPff., and it is relevant that when, in April 1911, enquiry was made by the secretary of State for India of the Government of/ Iof India whether the definition in question of Koweit territory had been couimunicated to the sheikh they replied that it might he assumed that it had, hut that it 'only referred to our pledge to defend him against Ihn Rashid who was threatening the immediate neighbourhood of Koweit.' (telegram of 6th April 1911, P.594/11)-. 8. The more specific undertakings embodied in the Bunder Shweikh lease of 1907 and quoted in paragraph 2 above may be regarded as to some extent conmitting us in respect of “the town of Koweit and its boundaries' 1 . The phrase 'its boundaries' is, however, very vague, and could perhaps most reasonably be construed as applying to the j immediate district around Koweit town. The discussions as to our obligations to the Sheikh which took place in 1911 and which are summarised in paragraphs 9 to 12 below, appear to have turned essentially on the undertakings c£L1899. 9. In 1911, in connection with the Anglo-Turkish negotiations, the question of our obligations was examined in some detail. . The Government of India, on being asked, with reference to Lord Lansdowne’s Memorandum of 1902 to which reference is made In paragraph 6 above, to 'define the region to which' our obligation extends, and 'whether they accepted' general description of boundaries in Persian Gulf Gazetteer, page 1059 etc;' replied 'We are of opinion that (1) our obligations extend to the limits of the Sheikh’s territory, (2) these limits, to the best of our knowledge, are defined with fair accuracy by Lorimer, especially as II regards northern portion...' 10.. The Secretary of State for India in the light of the Government of India's views, wrote as follows to the Foreign Office (P*594/11, 8th April 1911); 'Viscount/ |12./ ' - 5 'Viscount Morley is not aware on what grounds the opinion expressed by the Marquess of Lansdowne in his memorandum of 21st March 1902 is based, but he observes that the language used is very tentative, and, so far as he knows, the subject was never pursued along the lines suggested by His Lordship, except in the case of the attack on the immediate neighbourhood of Koweit threatened by Ibn Rashid in the autumn of 1902. It will be seen from the G-overnment of India’s telegram of 6 April that this incident does not affect their opinion that possession. In this Lord Morley concurs: that is to say he thinks that in the event of unprovoked aggression by the Turks or by Arab tribes under Turkish control, upon those limits, h.M.O. could not abstain from using their 'good offices' in the Sheikh’s favour. But the term 'good offices' is a very vague one, which are at liberty to interpret at their discretion, and which they would doubtless interpret with more or less strictness according to the nature and locality of the aggression, and all the circumstances of the case. It would, however, in His Lordship’s opinion, be very impolitic to attempt, in dealing with the Sheikh, to whittle down the extent of our obligations, since such a course would fill his mind with suspicions and could not fail to affect o ur unfavourably/prestige in the Persian Gulf..,.” 11 The F.O .replied on 9 May 1911 that Sir E.Grey * concurred 'in the view of the Government of India, shared by Viscount Morley, that these obligations extend to the whole territory of the Sheikh as described in the passage of our general obligations extend, to the limits of Koweit territory as described in Vol.II pp.1059-1061 of LoriiiBr^s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, copy of which is in your 1 Lorimer’s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf to which your letter refers.'sY'*-' - 6 - x oy 'S l 446/ 12. In Aug: 1911 the Government of India, after consultation with the Political Resident (Sir P.Cox) recommended that H.M.G. should communicate to the Turks a copy of the Agreement of 1899 with a note that H.M.G.had subsequently informed the Sheikh that so long as he and his heirs and successors acted up to their obligations under the ll Agreement, we charged ourselves to support them and to protect Koweit against attack by land or sea.' The Secretary of State for India, on closer consideration, found himself unable to accept this proposal. India Office letter to the Foreign Office of 30th October, 1911, P : . 1446/11, remarked: 'The telegrams of 4th December 1901 and 14th October 1902, on which the Government of India appear to base the obligation to protect Koweit by land and sea, in the Marquis of Crewe's opinion clearly refer only to the incidents that occasioned them and cannot be understood to have given any general undertaking. Nor, in view of the fact that it has since been decided that our obligations extend to the whole of the Sheikh’s territory as described in Lorimer’s Gazetteer, would it be safe to pledge ourselves to any specific method of defending them. As was pointed out by Lord Morley in this Office letter of 8th April last, the term 'good offices' (which by Colonel Meade’s letter of 23rd January 1899 ?/e undertook to accord to the Sheikh)is a conveniently vague one and Lord Cre?/e is of opinion that it is neither necessary nor safe to go beyond it. The action taken by H.M.G. in 1901/02, when men and guns were landed at Koweit to defend it against unprovoked Turkish aggression, will, moreover, have made it plain to the Porte in what way we are prepared to interpret the term if necessity arises. 'His Lordship would therefore suggest that the formula should run: 'As regards No.l, H.M.G. have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that so long as he and his heirs and successors/successors act up to their obligations under the Agreement, undertake to support them and accord them their good offices/' with perhaps the addition that reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion.” The Foreign Office (F.O.letter dated 1st boverriber 1911) accepted the proposed redraft and addition and a communication in this sense was made to Tewfik Pasha in Sir Edward G-ray's letter of 24th October 1911(42135). 13. The undertaking given in 1914 that Koweit 'shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection” may be regarded as importing a degree of responsibility for the protection of the principality as a whole, 14. On the death of Sheikh Mobarak his eldest son was informed in March 1916 on his accession by the Viceroy that 'so long as you act up to the existing arrangements with the British Government you may expect the same support as was enjoyed by your father,” A similar assurance was given on Sheikh Jabir's death in 1917 to his brother and successor, Sheikh Salim, in March 1917. Sheikh Salim's conduct was unsatisfactory and it was found necessary to warn him,through the Political Resident, on 5th July 1918, that the assurances (which presumably covered the assurance of 3 Nov. 1914) conveyed to him on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour and that should acts 'contrary to the interests of (His Majesty's Government” 'unfortunately be committed in future” he ?/ould be held personally responsible. 15. In connection with the operations against the Ikhwan in 1928 the question of the precise extent of the obligations of H.M.G.for the defence of Koweit was considered innfche India Office, when the view was put forward that consideration of our engagements suggested that on a strict reading our liability could be confined to the protection of/- 8 - of the town of Koweit and that we are not called upon to protect Koweit territory as a whole. above (a) we appear consistently to have taken the view that Sheikh; (b) secondly, ' subject to this reservation, ?/e are committed to 'good offices' in respect of 'Koweit', an assurance which has since 1911 been accepted as extending to the whole territory of the Sheikhdom, but which would not commit us to anything further than diplomatic support; and its boundaries' 'belong to ' the heirs of Sheikh Mobarak; (w r hiie the payment of rent for the Bunder Shweikh : site was terminated in 1907, the Agreement of 1907 was not abrogated, and the reciprocal pledges embodied in that Agreement should apparently still be regarded as binding in so far as they are not affected by other subsequent instruments. We communicated Article IX of the Bunder Shweikh Agreement to Ibn Saud in 1928: and in 1933 the P.A.Koweit and the Political Resident brought to notice the continued existence of the obligations of the Sheikh in regard to Customs duties(para.2 we have undertaken to recognise, and have in fact recognised, Koweit as an independent principality under British protection. No definition has been given or attempted of the meaning of 'British protection' in this connection; and while nrima facie the Sheikh might apparently be justified in claiming that it represented an assurance of effective protection in respect of the whole of his principality, there is some room for discussion as to its precise implications, and it is noteworthy that no appeal appears to have been made Conclusion. As will be seen from the correspondence summarised our obligations are conditional on the good behaviour of the (c) thirdly, we have promised 'that the town of Koweit above) under Article X of the Agreement) (d) fourthly,that xredecessors. v/AIlh •w ' r *' a The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Grulf presents his com pliments to ''he Secretary to the Oov^rmaent of Xnciia, Rct?

The delicate question of the direct correspondence which has gradually established itself between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud remains for consideration. Sir Samuel Hoare has considered the alternatives .discussed in paragraph 5 of Colonel Fowls T s despatch of 25th October, and as a result he is of opinion, subject to the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs t hat th e fi rst alternative suggested by the Eesident (which incidentally is, apparently, likely to prove the less objectionable to the Sheikh) is the right solution. Subject to Sir John Simon f s concurrence, he would propose, however, to approve the Resident f s recommendation that Colonel Dickson should approach the Sheikh verbally on the lines suggested in paragraph 6 of Bushire despatch under consideration, with the modification suggested in Mr. Johnstone f s demi-official letter of 25th November lastE.7141/16/91, to Mr.Laithwaite,i- o • Sir Samuel Hoare would also propose that it might he left to Colonel Fowle’s discretion, after the Sheikh 1 s attitude has. become known, to settle the matter in accordance with either of the alternatives discussed in paragraph 5 of his Despatch. The important question whether special action should be taken to emphasise at Jedda to Ibn Saud the nature of the relations which exist between His Majesty f s Government and the Sheikh might be considered when a report has been received from Colonel Fowls. 4. The question of the obligations of His Majesty^ Government for the protection of Koweit, to which the Besident refers in paragraphs 7-11 of his despatch, is one of considerable importance. The general position ^ is examined in the India Office memorandum B.427/P.Z* 6535/33, of which copies have already been communicated to the Foreign Office. The Secretary of State agrees with the Political Besident that the agreements of 1899 and 1907, containing as they do merely a promise of good offices, the applicability of which to the whole sheikhdom as distinct from the town of Koweit is open to doubt, are not of great material importance so far as n protectioii T is concerned. The undertaking of real importance is that given to the Sheikh in 1914 in return for the cooperation of his predecessor against the Turks. 5. Subject to Sir John Simon f s views, Sir Samuel Hoare, on a consideration of the position as a whole, is in agreement with Colonel Fowle's view that the phraseology L o aisssfe of this undertaking and the use of the word 'Sheikhdom' and not 'town' would appear to place definitely a • responsibility for the protec t ion ^ of., the whole principality of Koweit on His Majesty’s Government. He is, at the same time, in entire agreement with the Besident that such an / \d7./ of Koweit. Moreover, as stated in the India Office note B.427/p*Z.6535/33 on this subject, the assurances at present given to the Sheikh are in practice renewed to each successor in return for his acceptance of the obligations, liability for which was accepted by his predecessors, and in 1918 it appears uo have been held that our obligations held good only so long as the ruling sheikh-on his side complied wit h his engagements. It is arguable that a formal treaty might place a heavier burden on His Majesty's Government without correspondingly binding the Sheikh. But it seems doubtful whether this view could, in fact, be sustained. Formal recognition by His Majesty's Government of a Sheikh of Koweit would presumably be necessary before the engagements entered into with previous Sheikhs could be regarded as binding on either parry. Any formal comprehensive treaty which might be drawn up could presumably be so framed as to make it clear that obligations were entirely reciprocal and that the liability of His Majesty's Government held good only so long as they were satisfied with the performance oy the Sheikh of his obligations under the treaty. Finally, so far as protection is concerned, if the view suggested in paragraph 5 above is accepted, that a general liability (within the limits described) for the protection of the principality of Koweit as a whole must already be regarded as resting on His Majesty's ‘Government no material increase of their responsibilities would be involved in reiterating their acceptance of that liability in a formal treaty, while the mere fact of reiteration might make it easier to obtain the consent of the Sheikh to a consolidating agreement. The Secretary of State would welcome Sir John Simon's views on this point.6. 7. Subject to the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of State would suggest that, in view of the small margin of difference which appears to exist between the provisional recommendations of the interdepartmental conference of 5th October last, the recommendations of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the proposals in this letter, it will be unnecessary, if those proposals commend themselves to Sir John Simon, Id refer the question for discussion to the Official Middle East Sub-Committee.

Secretary of State agrees that the question of declaring a protectorate over Koweit should not for the present be further pursued. Sheikh and King Ibn Saud, the Secretary of State, in the light of the considerations adduced in paragraphs 3~6 of the Foreign Office letter of 24th February, agrees with the course of action therein suggested by Sir John Simon. I am to request that you will be good enough to instruct It.-Ool. Dickson to approach the Sheikh accordingly and that you will in due course submit a further report v/hen the result of Ool. Dickson’s discussions with His Excellency is known and you are in a position to make recommendations as/ 2.

On whe question of the obligations of His Majesty Government in respect of the protection of Koweit, you will observe that the St;cretary of St^e for Foreign Affairs has expressed his agreement with the views contained in paragraphs 4 and 5 of Inula Office letter of 1st PAoru^ry 1934. Tnc Foreign Office print of which a copy is sent •'ewith, contains a supplementary historical note prepared in this Office on the question of the view taken in 1928-29 as to the liability of His MajestyGovernment for the protection of Koweit against aggression from outside. 5. The Secretary of Sarbe would be glad in due course to receive your views on the proposal referred to in paragraph 6 of Iiiu.ia Office letter of 1st February for the conclusion of a new and comprehensive treaty between His Majesty’s Government and the Sheikh of Koweit. The matter is not one of immediate urgency and it may well be that, as suggested by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, there may be advantage in deferring any reference to it until further progress has been made in the disposal of the vexed question of the relations of the Sueiwh with King Ton Su,ud and the questions of oil concessions for Koweit proper and the Neutral Zone between Koweit and Nejd. ' * l' } 6. The interdepartmental meeting of 5th October recommended inter alia that the issue of the Saadi blockade of Koweit should oe taken up with King Ion S&amp;uci by His MajestyGovernment on the basis of their obligation/obligation to protect the interests of Koweit. Disposal of this question has been deferred pending a decision on the matt ers discussed in the present letter, but steps are now being taken to deal with it as a matter of urgency. 7. Copies of this letter are being sent for information to the Government of India and to the Political Agent at Koweit. I i, air, Your obedient Servant, £Sd,) J. C. WALTON.Government would charge themselves with the defence of Koweit district.” The Secretary of State, after consultation with the Foreign Office (Foreign Office a Se i letter of the 13th October, 1902), replied (telegram No. 133 of the 14th October, ' 1902): “I approve your proposed reply about the guns, provided Koweit l0 ^ Cflsfc LWA) • I _ ^ l ' district is clearly defined as the district adjoining or close to the bay of that name.” This assurance similarly admits of being read as an assurance ad hoc, ,, 'and it is relevant that when, in April 1911, enquiry was made by the Secretary ° ei of State for India of the Government of India whether the definition in question Mill /VN: is heirs J iertooy export wdaut hjestr' . .. 0 f Koweit territory had been communicated to the Sheikh, they replied that it | i! might be assumed that it had, but that it “ only referred to our pledge to defend m 1 him against Ibn Rashid, who was threatening the immediate neighbourhood of Koweit” (telegram of the 6 th April, 1911). 8 . The more specific undertakings embodied in the Bunder Shweikh lease of 1907, and quoted in paragraph 2 above, may be regarded as to some extent committing us in respect of ‘ c the town of Koweit and its boundaries.” The phrase ‘ ‘ its boundaries ’ ’ is, however, very vague, and could perhaps most reasonably be construed as applying to the immediate district around Koweit town. The discussions as to our obligations to the Sheikh which took place in 1911, and which are summarised in paragraphs 9 to 12 below, appear to have turned essentially on the undertakings of 1899. 9. In 1911, in connexion with the Anglo-Turkish negotiations, the question of our obligations was examined in some detail. The Government of India, on being asked, with reference to Lord Lansdowne’s memorandum of 1902, to which reference is made in paragraph 6 above, to “define the region to which our obligation extends,” and “whether they accepted” general description of boundaries in Persian Gulf Gazetteer, p. 1059, &amp;c., replied: “We are of opinion that (1) our obligations extend to the limits of the Sheikh’s territory; ( 2 ) these limits, to the best of our knowledge, are defined with fair accuracy by Lorimer, especially as regards northern portion. ...” 10. The Secretary of State for India, in the light of the Government of India’s views, wrote as follows to the Foreign Office (the 8 th April, 1911) :— “ Viscount Morley is not aware on what grounds the opinion expressed by the Marquess of Lansdowne in his memorandum of the 21st March, 1902, is based, but he observes that the language used is very tentative, and, so far as he knows, the subject was never pursued along the lines suggested by his Lordship, except in the case of the attack on the immediate neighbour hood of Koweit threatened by Ibn Rashid in the autumn of 1902. It will be seen from the Government of India’s telegram of the 6 th April that this incident does not affect their opinion that our general obligations extend to the limits of Koweit territory as described in Vol. II, pp. 1059-1061, of Larimer’s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, copy of which is in your possession. Ii* this Lord Morley concurs; that is to say, he thinks that, in the event of unprovoked aggression by the Turks or by Arab tribes under Turkish control, upon those limits, His Majesty’s Government could not abstain from using their ‘ good offices ’ in the Sheikh’s favour. But the term good offices ’ is a very vague one, which His Majesty’s Government are at liberty to interpret at their discretion, and which they would doubtless interpret with more or less strictness, according to the nature and locality of the aggression, and all the circumstances of the case. , It would, however, in his Lordship’s opinion, be very impolitic to attempt, in dealing with the Sheikh, to whittle down the extent of our obligations, since such a course would fill his mind with suspicions, and could not fail to affect unfavourably our prestige in the Persian Gulf. . . 11. The Foreign Office replied, on the 9th May, 1911, that Sir E. Grey concurred “ in the view of the Government of India, shared by Viscount Morley, jmber.

In August 1911 the Government of Indiq, after consultation with the Political Resident (Sir P. Cox), recommended that His Majesty s Government should communicate to the Turks a copy of the agreement of 1899, with a note that His Majesty’s Government had subsequently informed the Sheikh that, so long as he and his heirs and successors acted up to their obligations under the agreement, we charged ourselves to support them and to protect Koweit against [935 1—1] c10 attack by land or sea. The Secretary of State for India, on closer consideration, found himself unable to accept this proposal. India Office letter to the Foreign Office of the 30th October, 1911, remarked :— “ The telegrams of the 4th December, 1901, and the 14th October, 1902 on which the Government of India appear to base the obligation to protect Koweit by land and sea, in the Marquess of Crewe’s opinion, clearly refer &gt; only to the incidents that occasioned them, and cannot be understood to have given any general undertaking. Nor, in view of the fact that it has since been decided that our obligations extend to the whole of the Sheikh’s territory, as described in Ijorimer's Gazetteer, would it be safe to pledge ourselves to any specific method of defending them. As was pointed out by Lord Morley in this Office letter of the 8 th April last, the term ‘ good offices ’ (which, by Colonel Meade’s letter of the 23rd January, 1899, we undertook to accord to the Sheikh) is a conveniently vague one, and Lord Crewe is of opinion that it is neither necessary nor safe to go beyond it. The action taken by His Majesty’s Government in 1901-02, when men and guns were landed at Koweit to defend it against unprovoked Turkish aggression, will moreover, have made it plain to the Porte in what way we are prepared to interpret the term if necessity arises. ‘ ‘ His Lordship would therefore suggest that The formula should run: ‘ As regards No. 1 , His Majesty’s Government have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that, so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obligations under the agreement, His Majesty’s Government undertake to support them and accord them their good offices,’ with, perhaps, the addition that His Majesty’s Government reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion.” The Foreign Office (Foreign Office letter dated the 1 st November, 1911) accepted the proposed redraft and addition, and a communication in this sense was made to Tevfik Pasha in Sir Edward Grey’s letter of the 24th October, 1911, 13. The undertaking given in 1914 that Koweit “ shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection,” may be regarded as importing a degree of responsibility for the protection of the principality as a whole. 14. On the death of Sheikh Mobarak his eldest son was informed, in March 1916, on his accession, by the Viceroy, that, “ so long as you act up to the existing ai rangements with the British Government, you may expect the same support as was enjoyed by your father.” A similar assurance was given on Sheikh Jabir’s i 1917 t0 ^ is brother and successor. Sheikh Salim, in March 1917. S eikn Salim s conduct was unsatisfactory, and it was found necessary to warn hnn, through the Political Resident, on the 5 th July, 1918, that the assurances (which presumably covered the assurance of the 3 rd November, 1914) conveyed o im on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour, and that, should ac s contrary to the interests of His Majesty’s Government unfortunately be committed m future, he would be held personally responsible 15.

No definition has been given or attempted of the meaning of “British protection” in this connexion; and, while jprima facie the Sheikh safey would apparently be justified in claiming that it represented an assurance of effective protection in respect of the whole of his principality, there is some room for discussion as to its precise implications, and it is noteworthy that no Vei l appeal appears to have been made under it either by the present Sheikh or by his predecessors. it H' J. G. LAITHWAITE flanh India Office, October 11, 1933. Appendix C. Supplementary Note. Question of Liability for the Protection of Koweit against Aggression from Outside, 1928-29. h perk' Akhwan raids on Koweit had taken place in 1924 and 1925, but on Ostler an inconsiderable scale. The Akhwan raids on Iraq by Feisal-al-Dawish and the Mutair tribe at the end of 1927 had, however, more important reactions on ^ over the principality. At the request of the Sheikh His Majesty's Government agreed [ ni ‘. to aerial reconnaissance over his territory; and, with his concurrence, it was i 0 : later decided to withdraw the restrictions originally imposed by His Majesty’s i Government on bombing in pursuit of raiders within Koweit territory. An f k ':; Akhwan raid was successfully dealt with by Koweit forces at El Riqai on the e i - 27th January, 1928, and whilst retiring into Nejd was pursued and successfully 1)1111 attacked by the Royal Air Force on two following days. A further raid occurred late in February, which was not opposed by ground forces, but was again success- fully pursued by the Royal Air Force for two days. In view of the possibility )tl t! ' of further serious developments, and of the recognised liability of His Majesty’s Government under existing engagements for the “protection of Koweit ’ (a phrase the exact scope of which is open to argument), further defence measures n 1L were now taken. A temporary air base (political objections to a permanent ee; ' station being regarded as conclusive) was established in Koweit: a flight of tie as aeroplanes and a detachment of armoured cars were despatched to the town 1911 f or protection : three vessels of the Persian Gulf Squadron (later reduced ndtk one ) were stationed off Koweit itself, and a landing party disembarked and nfortiif remained on shore until the crisis had passed. All action taken was taken with the concurrence of the Sheikh, who was, in addition, allowed to purchase from Q k ^ the Government of India a small supply of machine guns and Fewis guns. After r’sGit some discussion His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India agreed ntleff that his Excellency might be allowed to purchase armoured motor cars, on the iat, oil' i understanding that they would be used only for defence, and would not cross the iwnoff borders of Koweit in repelling raids save with the concurrence of the Political iwtolt Agent. The crisis, however, passed off without incident, and the special forces ater ^ which had been despatched to Koweit were withdrawn during the late spring. For financial reasons the Sheikh abandoned the idea of purchasing armoured cars. 2. On the 15th August, 1928, the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, in order to provide against all eventualities, asked permission to send car or air recon- aboff naissances into Koweit territory and to establish a defence air base at Koweit ^re ^ in the event of a raid. The India Office remarked (letter of the 22nd August, lisresetf ]928) : “ The Secretary of State would see strong objection on political grounds sm# to the use of Koweit territory in connexion with air operations against the ritot'l Akhwan, by which Koweit was not directly or immediately threatened. Having an if] regard, however, to the treaty liability of His Majesty’s Government for the ] protection of Koweit and to the action taken with the consent of the Sheikh ymefltfl in the early part of this year, he would see no objection to the grant of the authority now requested when Koweit was directly or indirectly menaced, on the understanding that the prior consent of the Sheikh was obtained from the7, COLO IEL FOWLS expressed the view that there did not seem to he any intermediate position possible between a treaty relationship with the haeikh on the present lines and a full Protectorate 0 The dheikh would certainly be unwilling to agree to the sheikhdom becoming a formal protectorate, and prime, fac ie he (Colonel Towle) was not much in favour of it 0 He agreed, however, that it would be advisable on suitable opportunities, to try to tighten uo our control over the Sheikh. On being questioned whether he did not consider that our restricted oosition vis-a-vis of the Sheikh in regard to the Koweit oil concession indicated the essential weak ness of our treaty position, he replied that our difficul ties in that case had been due rather to the special undertakings given to the United States Government in that matter than to any weakness in our norma], control over the Sheikh under the treaty engagements« Had we been able, without violating our pledges to the United States Govern ment, to tell the Sheikh that we required him to give the concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company he would have done so. MR, RENDEL drew attention to the fact that in the event of serious rnisgovernment by the Ruler of Koweit such as prejudicially to affect foreign citizens in Koweit we might find ourselves in a difficult position vis-a-vis the foreign power concerned, MR. LAITHWAITE said that on this ooint he thought that Bahrain might be regarded as locus classicus. We had for man:/ years put up with a considerable degree of misgovernment by Sheikh Isa, But when conditions at last in our view became intolerable we did not hesitate to intervene and to depose the Sheikh, There0, Tiere were obvious argument&amp;-for doing so, for were we not to intervene when misgovernment had reached a certain pitch it would be most difficult for us to justify a re fusal to allow foreign governments which mig£t be affected to take steps to protect the interests of their nationals. e did not think that there need be any apprehension in the case of Koweit that we would fail to bring pressure on a Sheikh who was abusing his position, once it became necessary to do so. The ca.se for early intervention would probably be stronger now that the Gulf was so much more in the public eye. The meeting’ then went on to consider relations between Ibn Gaud and Koweit. 813 AIDISW RYAN stated that he had been impressed by the anparent weakness ox His Majesty's Government's position vis-a-vis of Ibn Baud with regard to Koweit. His 'ajesty's Government were not strongly olaced, when it became necessary to warn Ibn Baud to keep his hands off Koweit, since they were committed to maintain ing that Koweit was technically an independent State. A case in point had been the Saudi intrusions into Koweit territory referred to in paragraph 3 of his note, when Saudi officials had performed acts of authority within the limits of the sheikhdom. COLO ILL FOWLE pointed out that in fact our treaty engagements did entitle us to prevent foreign lowers from dealing direct with the Sheikh. Ibn Srud had certainly been informed of the special relations existing between the Sheikh and His Majesty's Government Speaking generally, he added that infect little trouble O was likely to loe experienced with foreigners in Koweit, so long as it remained a Beduin town ruled hy a Beduin Sheikh and not, like Bahrain, a relatively cosmopolitan commercial centre. If,however,oil were discovered within the bheikh- O-Om, it was possible that difficulties might arise.9 ° we o e 9 • MR„ RENDEL pointed out that the Arabian air route was likely to develop quickly 0 If Iraq were to adopt an ant:L~ foreign policy, and Koweit became correspondingly more important as a centre of international traffic, other countries might well wish to take advantage of the facilities there 0 We might well find many foreign Powers becoming increasingly interested in Koweit, We could not have it both ways, and should sooner or later have to define our position* His Majesty's Government ought, therefore, to orient their policy definitely either towards the greater independence of the Sheikhdom or towards a tightening of their own control 0 MR, LAITHWAITE agreed and added that, in his view, our policy should be directed towards a closer control, but that it was undesirable to hasten any overt declara tion of full control, such as The establishment of a protectorate would be 0 Such a declaration might well frighten the Sheikhs of Bahrain and of the Trucial Coast and do more harm than good* The policy to be followed was. therefore, one of occasional minor adjustments, as these became necessary, tending to increase, or at any 'rate not to relax, our control over the Sheikhdom* Reverting to the question of Saudi-Koweiti relations, SIR hhiRhY RYAH drew attention to the toleration extended by His Majesty’s Government to direct correspondence on business matters between the Sheikh and Ibn SaufL This, no less than the independence formula, placed us in a weak position in defending Koweit, and the correspondence in question was of such long standing that it was difficult now ion us to take the line that Ibn Baud should write to us rather than to the Sheikh„ What was desirable was that10 „ the 9 • 9 v/e should .oe aole to tell Ibn Saud openly that v/e were responsihle for defending the Sheikh’s interests in a,ny given dispute c kiH, LAITIIYAITE said that the explanation of the system of direct correspondence between the Sheikh and iDn sand v/ as $ he thought v that it dated from a time when tne latter was not so important a ruler as he had since oocome and when we had taken the view that it was un necessary to take too strict a view of correspondence between Sheikh and Sheikh, That position was now changed, and reconsideration seemed desirable„ Ibn Saud was well aware both thaw His Majesty's Government conducted the foreign relations of Koweit and that the Sheikh had undertaken certain obligations towards us., He agreed that it was now necessary to exert stricter control over the correspondence in question and to emphasize our own special position in Koweit vis-^a-vis of Ibn Saud more definitely than had been the case while -Uc-.q as still under British control„ He suggested that we might; (a) check Ibn Saud when he appeared to be pi esuming too far with regard to Koweit - a policy which we were in fact now prepared to follow in regard to the Saudi-Koweit blockade, and (b) enforce stricter regula tions on the Sheikh in the matter of direct correspondence COLONEL FOWLS agreed 0 Such action would show both the^oMCxkh and Ibn Saud that we considered the Sheikh to be under our direction 6 If we did not take some such step as thisj we might be in danger of finding ourselves fenced with the results of a kind of conspiracy between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud, We ought, therefore, to write to11 the Sheikh in the sense that we noted that his private correspondence with Ihn Baud had assumed an increasing importance and tell him that that correspondence must now T.- ^ a MR 0 RENDSL concurred. A straightforward control of this nature would he easier to maintain and would prevent a repetition of such incidents as the letter in which Ihn Baud had recently tried to detach the Sheikh of Koweit from his connexion with His Majesty 5 s Government, SIR A. RYAN also concurred, and drew attention to the success with which Ihn Sand was spreading the idea that he might naturally absorb Koweit and was bound to do sc sooner or later 0 He pointed out that such an idea could never have prevailed to the extent to which it had, if His Majesty’s Government had equally definitely made known their own special position with regard to Koweit. The meeting then discussed what point in the corres pondence between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud could most suit ably be taken up in connexion with the reprimand which it was proposed to address to both parties 0 MR* LAITHWAITE suggested that if it were discovered that the Sheikh had committed himself to Ibn Saud in regard to the grant of an oil concession in the Koweit Neutral Zone, this might be an excellent opportunity for checking him. The question then arose what action could be taken if the United States Government, in dealing with whom His Maj ^sty’s Government had consistently emphasised the Sheikh ! s independence, were to produce communications from him regarding the grant of a concession in the Neutral Zoneo If was, however, agreed that His Majesty’s Govern** ment could demonstrate from the Sheikh 5 s treaty engagements that he had not been entitled to make any such grant with-coimwgt , *iAJ., .

In the light of Colonel Fowle’s views, Sir Samuel Hoare is definitely of opinion that the question of declaring // * a urotectorate over Koweit should not at present be further __|,«n«minuwnr pursued, and he considers that it should be possible to ensure a sufficient degree of British control over the Sheikhdom by adopting a policy of tightening up our control over the Sheikh as opportunity offers by filling in the gaps which at present exist in the agreements between the Sheikh and His Majesty's G-overnment. The gaps (with the exception of that discussed in the following paragraph and of a slavery agreement), are not in fact very serious. Apart from the major assurances contained in the Agreement of 1899, the Sheikh has already given undertakings in respect of the arms traffic; he is precluded from granting a pearling, spongefishing, or oil concession without the approval of/ Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, SJJ.l.w SI 'V 4. an obligation, if His Majesty f s ‘Government now formally confirm that the t y recognise its existence, cannot be regarded as relieving the Sheikh completely of the responsibility of his own defence and that ,! the Sheikh should certainly oe able to deal with any small raids across his frontiers and should only look for assistance from His Majesty T ^ Government in the case of more serious incursions.' buch a construction would, as Colonel Fowle, suggests, be consistent with the attitude adopted by His Majesty f s Government after the Akhwan operations of 1928/^9, though it is relevant that no close examination oi the precise obligations in the matter of His Majesty's Government was undertaken at that time. Should Sir John Simon share the views expressed in this paragraph, Sir Samuel Hoare will cause the resident to be instructed accordingly. 6. While the Secretary of State, as stated above, would be opposed to the declaration of a protectorate, and is satisfied, as at present advised, that the desiderata of His Majesty's Government can be sufficiently secured by indirect tightening up of our control over the Sheikh, he is at the same time impressed by the informal character of the engagements which have been entered into on behalf of Koweit, He would therefore be disposed to see advantage in consolidating the various undertakings which have from time to time been given on either side in a formal treaty on the lines of the Qatar Treaty of 1916, could this be secured without much difficulty.

CONFIDENTIAL. October 11, 1933. Section 1. [E 6077/16/91] No. 1. Final Record of a Meeting held at the Foreign Office on October 5 to discuss Relations between His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and the Sheikh of Koweit. THE following were present at the meeting :— Mr. G. W. Rendel (in the Chair), Foreign Office. Mr. K. R. Johnstone, Foreign Office. Sir A. Ryan, His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda. Lieutenant-Colonel T. C. Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Mr. J. G. Laithwaite, India Office. The meeting had before it Sir Andrew Ryan’s note of the 16th August, regarding the attitude of King Ibn Sand towards Koweit (see Appendix A). Mr. Rendel outlined the present political situation of Koweit. The Sheikh was tied to His Majesty’s Government by his treaty engagements, but at the same time was being courted both by Ibn Saud and by Iraq. It was clear that the sheikhdom was not in a position which in the ordinary way would enable it to stand alone either as a political or as an economic entity, and that it must there fore depend on some stronger Power. He understood that it was the policy of His Majesty’s Government, in view of the strategic importance of Koweit, not to allow it to be absorbed by any foreign Power, but, so far as was possible, to maintain their present treaty relationship with the Sheikh. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that Koweit was at the present moment of more vital importance to His Majesty's Government than it had been at any sin P e it had bulked so prominently as the terminus of the Bagdad Railway before the war This was the result first of the development of the air route to India and Australia, which had made the Gulf as important imperially from the air stand point as was the Suez Canal for naval reasons, and, secondly, owing to the expira tion of the mandatory regime in Iraq and the uncertainty of the future relations of His Majesty’s Government with that country. So long as Iraq had been under British control, there had been a natural tendency to give it prior consideration and the less important question of Koweit had been kept comparatively m the background. But now that Iraq had attained full independence, the position was changed and Koweit had once again assumed major importance. Geographically, Koweit occupied a key position at the head of the Persian Gulf, and one from which the Gulf could be controlled. In the event of war we could probably safely assume that Koweit would be on our side and her territory would afford us a base of operations of definite value, to the use of which, on the assumption m question, no objection could be raised on the ground that we were violating her neutrality Further, with the development of the Arabian coast air route to the East, Koweit was likely to prove more and more vital as a station on that route, especially it our relations with Iraq should at any time become so strained that we were unable to rely on the use of the Iraqi aerodromes for the purposes of that route. Colonel Fowle suggested that in point of fact it might one day be possible to avoid the use of Iraq altogether, and fly direct from Palestine to Koweit, as the range of the aircraft using the Arabian route increased. Mr. Rendel concurred with Mr. Laithwaite_s estimate of the position as regards Irao. In view of recent events in Iraq it was possible that our whole relationship with that country might have to be modified, and he considered t a both the future of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty and of the position of the Royal An Force in Iraq must be regarded as doubtful. On the general point at issue, he [935 1—1] n2 T observed that one of the main points to be borne in mind was the fact that Koweit was not naturally independent from either the geographical or the economic point of view. It was a port without a hinterland, cut off at present by the Iraqi and Saudi frontiers from the territory which it would naturally feed, and at present denied free communication with the country behind it. Moreover, even its present trade might be jeopardised by the development of the Saudi port at Ras Tanura under the auspices of the American oil concessionaires on the Hasa coast. What was even more important was that its fresh-water supply was not derived from its own territory, but had to be imported from Iraq. It was for consideration, therefore, whether it would, in fact, be practicable for His Majesty’s Government to maintain the independence of Koweit as against its neighbours, at any rate on the present basis of a rather loose and ill-defined dependence on His Majesty’s Government. Colonel Fowle concurred generally in Mr. Rendel’s description of the economic position of the sheikhdom. He pointed out, however, that Koweit had always been the port of the deserts of northern Arabia, as Bahrein was the port of Central Arabia, In regard to the position of Koweit vis-a-vis of Iraq, he added that beside the influence which Iraq could exert by controlling Koweit’s fresh water supply, it was also powerful enough to bring pressure to bear upon Koweit over, for instance, the question of smuggling. Mr. Rendel agreed that both Iraq and Saudi Arabia were in a position to exert strong pressure on Koweit. This being so, the rivalry between them over Koweit was likely to increase, unless, of course, Saudi Arabia disintegrated. The present position of Koweit between these two States was weak, and Sir Andrew Ryan’s note showed how powerful an attraction Ibn Saud could exert. The question, therefore, was whether His Majesty’s Government would not be well advised to develop and tighten up their own relations with Koweit in order to strengthen its position. It had, in fact, been suggested that it might be more advantageous to convert our present treaty relationship into a definite protectorate, on, for instance, the analogy of the Hadramaut, which was now regarded as part of the Aden Protectorate, but where our treaty relationship with the local rulers and obligations to afford them protection had been if anything looser than those we had towards Koweit. Would not a protectorate ensure Koweit more effectively against absorption than the present attempt to maintain the sheikhdom as a kind of political vacuum in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Laithwaite drew attention to three points :— {a) At present the obligations of His Majesty’s Government to Koweit were represented by their undertaking to grant “good offices ” in respect of Koweit under the 1899 agreement, by their promise of 1907 that “the town of Koweit and its boundaries belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him,' and their undertaking of the 3rd November, 1914, that Koweit, in the event of a victory over the Turks, would be recognised by us as an independent princi pality under British protection. They were thus very general in terms, and, in accordance with our normal policy on the Arab littoral, which dated from a period in which it was possible to protect a sea port by action from the sea, but not to afford effective help inland, we had consistently endeavoured to limit our obligations, save as regards good offices to Koweit town and the immediately adjoining area. Recent experience had, however, shown that in cases of intervention from outside it was in fact necessary to give the Sheikh, at our discretion, and on our own terms, a measure of active assistance up ^ frontiers and with the development of aircraft the problem of inland defence was now less difficult. This was to some extent a strengthening of his strict treaty position, as also possibly an extension of our strict treaty obligations (b) With regard to the suggested estkblishment of a protectorate it was necessary to consider what the reactions of the Sheikh would be, and also what eftect the proclamation of a protectorate might have on the other Arab rulers ot the Gulf. It would in any case be wiser not and’fn e rw overt P r ° clamatl °n of this nature, since both in Bahrein and m Qatar and along the Trucial Coast it would probably rouseapprehensions and might even cause the local sheikhs to turn away from His Majesty’s Government and consider submitting themselves to Persia or to Ibn Saud. (c) The basis of His Majesty’s Government’s present treaty relationship with Koweit was unsatisfactory. In the first place, it did not rest, as was the case with Bahrein, Muscat and the Trucial Sheikhdoms, on a long series of formal treaties with the Sheikh dating back for over a century, or, as in the case of Qatar, on a comprehensive treaty, but was based only on a comparatively brief correspondence exchanged between the sheikhs and His Majesty’s Government since 1899 and on the reciprocal engagements, still presumably binding since they had not been abrogated, entered into in connexion with the lease of Bunder Shweikh in 1907; secondly, there were certain gaps, e.g., we had no slavery agreement with Koweit. It might, he suggested, be possible to fill in the gaps left by this correspondence and tighten our control in that way. An example was our recent request to the Sheikh for certain undertakings in regard to air facilities in his sheikhdom, one result of which would be to concentrate effective control of such facilities, whether military or civil, in the hands of His Majesty’s Government. Another instance was the recent proposed amendment of the Koweit Order in Council so as to place responsibility for jurisdiction over non-Moslem foreigners in the hands of His Majesty’s Government. A gradual tightening of our control of this character, particularly if pursued as a definite policy on all convenient occasions, would, he thought, at once avoid the difficulties involved in establishing a formal protectorate and would make it very much simpler. Colonel Fowle expressed the view that there did not seem to be any inter mediate position possible between a treaty relationship with the Sheikh on the present lines and a full protectorate. The Sheikh would certainly be unwilling to agree to the sheikhdom becoming a formal protectorate, and, prima facie, he (Colonel Fowle) was not much in favour of it. He agreed, however, that it would be advisable, on suitable opportunities, to try to tighten up our control over the Sheikh. On being questioned whether he did not consider that our restricted position vis-a-vis of the Sheikh in regard to the Koweit oil concession indicated the essential weakness of our treaty position, he replied that our difficulties in that case had been due rather to the special undertakings given to the United States Government in that matter than to any weakness in our normal control over the Sheikh under the treaty engagements. Had we been able, without violating our pledges to the United States Government, to tell the Sheikh that we required him to give the concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company he would have done so. Mr. Rendel drew attention to the fact that in the event of serious misgovern- ment by the Ruler of Koweit such as prejudicially to affect foreign citizens in Koweit, we might find ourselves in a difficult position vis-d-vis of the foreign Power concerned. Mr. Laithwaite said that on this point he thought that Bahrein might be regarded as locus classicus. We had for many years put up with a considerable degree of misgovernment by Sheikh Isa. But when conditions at last, in our view, became intolerable, we did not hesitate to intervene and to depose the Sheikh. There were obvious arguments for doing so, for were we not to intervene when misgovernment had reached a certain pitch, it would be most difficult for us to justify a refusal to allow foreign Governments which might be affected to take steps to protect the interests of their nationals. He did not think that there need be any apprehension in the case of Koweit that we would fail to bring pressure on a sheikh who was abusing his position, once it became necessary to do so. The case for early intervention would probably be stronger now that the Gulf was so much more in the public eye. The meeting then went on to consider relations between Ibn Saud and Koweit. [935 1—1] b 2Six A ndrew Ryan stated that he had been impressed by the apparent weakness of His Majesty’s Government’s position vis-a-vis of Ibn Sand with regard to Koweit. His Majesty’s Government were not strongly placed when it became necessary to warn Ibn Sand to keep his hands off Ivoweit, since they were committed to maintaining that Koweit was technically nn independent State. A case in point had been the Saudi intrusions into Koweit territory, referred to in paragraph 3 of his note, when Saudi officials had performed acts of authority within the limits of the sheikhdom. Colonel Fowle pointed out that, in fact, our treaty engagements did entitle us to prevent foreign Powers from dealing direct with the Sheikh. Ibn Sand had certainly been informed of the special relations existing between the Sheikh and His Majesty’s Government. Speaking generally, he added that, in fact, little trouble was likely to be experienced with foreigners in Koweit, so long as it remained a Bedouin town ruled by a Bedouin sheikh, and not, like Bahrein, a relatively cosmopolitan commercial centre. If, however, oil were discovered within the sheikhdom, it was possible that difficulties might arise. Mr. Rendel pointed out that the Arabian air route was likely to develop quickly. If Iraq were to adopt an anti-foreign policy, and Koweit became correspondingly more important as a centre of international traffic, other countries might well wish to take advantage of the facilities there. We might well find many foreign Powers becoming increasingly interested in Koweit. We could not have it both ways, and should sooner or later have to define our position. His Majesty’s Government ought, therefore, to orient their policy definitely either towards the greater independence of the sheikhdom or towards a tightening of their own control. Mr. Laithwaite agreed, and added that, in his view, our policy should be directed towards a closer control, but that it was undesirable to hasten any overt declaration of full control, such as the establishment of a protectorate would be. Such a declaration might well frighten the Sheikhs of Bahrein and of the Trucial Coast, and do more harm than good. The policy to be followed was, therefore, one of occasional minor adjustments, as these became necessary, tending to increase, or at any rate not to relax, our control over the sheikhdom. Reverting to the question of Saudi-Koweiti relations, Sir Andrew Ryan drew attention to the toleration extended by His Majesty’s Government to direct correspondence on business matters between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud. This, no less than the independence formula, placed us in a weak position in defending Koweit, and the correspondence in question was of such long standing that it was difficult now 7 for us to take the line that Ibn Saud should write to us rather than to the Sheikh. What was desirable was that we should be able to tell Ibn Sand openly that we were responsible for defending the Sheikh’s interests in any given dispute. Mr. Laithwaite said that the explanation of the system of direct correspon dence between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud was, he thought, that it dated from a time when the latter was not so important a ruler as he had since become, and wffien we had taken the view that it was unnecessary to take too strict a view of c 011 espondence between sheikh and sheikh. That position was now changed, and reconsideration seemed desirable. Ibn Saud was well aware both that His Majesty s Government conducted the foreign relations of Koweit and that the ei a undertaken certain obligations towards us. He agreed that it was now necessary to exert stricter control over the correspondence in question and to emphasise our own special position in Koweit vis-d-vis of Ibn Saud more definitely than had been the case while Iraq was still under British control He suggested that we might (a) check Ibn Saud when he appeared to be presuming too far with regard to Koweit-a policy which we were! in fact, now prepared to follow in regard to the Saudi-Koweit blockade; and (b) enforce stricter regulations on the Sheikh m the matter of direct correspondence. Colonel Fowls agreed. Such action would show both the Sheikh and Ibn baud that we considered the Sheikh to be under our direction If we did not take some such step as this, we might be in danger of finding ourselves faced with therefore 8 to wHte to the Sh&lt; L ikh and fbn Saud - We ou g ht ’ tneieiore, to wnte to tb Sheikh m the sense that we noted that his private[feiiv correspondence with Ibn Sand had assumed an increasing importance, and tell nk him that that correspondence must now cease. j Mr. Rendel concurred. A straightforward control of this nature would be ;' li;r easier to maintain, and would prevent a repetition of such incidents as the letter in which Ibn Saud had recently tried to detach the Sheikh of Koweit from his So ‘ati connexion with His Majesty’s Government. ^ Sir A. Ryan also concurred, and drew attention to the success with which y ' : : Ibn Saud was spreading the idea that he might naturally absorb Koweit and was bound to do so sooner or later. He pointed out that such an idea could never ,fN have prevailed to the extent to which it had, if His Majesty’s Government had r • equally definitely made known their own special position with regard to Koweit. ■I The meeting then discussed what point in the correspondence between the ' re Id Sheikh and Ibn Saud could most suitably be taken up in connexion with the reprimand which it was proposed to address to both parties. ^t§ Mr. Laithwaite suggested that if it were discovered that the Sheikh had kOW ® i committed himself to Ibn Saud in regard to the grant of an oil concession in W 6 f, the Koweit Neutral Zone, this might be an excellent opportunity for checking a % him. The question then arose, what action could be taken if the United States Koweit Government, in dealing with whom His Majesty’s Government had consistently emphasised the Sheikh’s independence, were to produce communications from him regarding the grant of a concession in the Neutral Zone? It was, however, satigl agreed that His Majesty’s Government could demonstrate from the Sheikh’s treaty engagements that he had not been entitled to make any such grant without | ] Y our knowledge and consent. Eventually it was agreed that the most suitable ySl ^occasion for the proposed representations to the Sheikh and Ibn Saud would be Ibn Sand’s letter suggesting terms for the settlement of the Saudi blockade of Koweit and warning the Sheikh against His Majesty’s Government. Saud ’ in defs igtktilf s ratk tell li in any et corif; latedii become ictaff ow cfc otb tk and tk ! that!!' pestil . Saudi conk- ie m owprf arcfi ^ ikb a® : wei 1 ! s fack fk At the conclusion of the meeting Sir A. Ryan raised the question of the pressure which might be exerted upon Ibn Saud in regard to the Saudi blockade of Koweit. This blockade had one of two purposes, either to complete the economic strangulation of Koweit and lead to its complete absorption in Saudi Arabia, or else the safeguarding of Saudi economic interests. His Majesty's Government could not possibly allow the first of these alternatives. The question, therefore, was what real force there was in Ibn Saud’s suggestion that his own purely economic interests required the maintenance of the blockade. 'Colonel Fowle suggested that we might well revert to the Sheikh’s proposal that Ibn Saud should have customs posts at a given place along but outside the Koweiti border, and that this might, if necessary, be coupled with a system of manifests for Koweiti—Saudi trade. He gave it as his opinion that e\en if Ibn Saud were to develop Ras Tanura, possibly with American help, this port was not likely to compete seriously with Koweit, which served quite a different hintei- land. nor was there any port between the Koweit area and the Ras Tanura aiea which could be successfully developed as a rival to Koweit. n rx u Colonel Fowle suggested that on his return to the Gulf on the 16th October he should discuss the situation with Colonel Dickson, Political Agent, Koweit, who had great experience of the sheikhdom, in the light of the conversations at the present meeting, and should submit a comprehensive report. It was agreed that this course should be adopted, and that in the light of the Resident s report and of the conclusions of the present meeting the question of future policy in Koweit should be discussed if necessary in the Middle East Official Sub-Committee. The conclusions of the meeting were as follows : (1) That in dealing with Ibn Saud, His Majesty’s Government should increasingly emphasise the closeness of their relations with the Sheik ^ (2) That the Sheikh should be told that his personal correspondence with Ibn Saud on official matters was to cease. 111 . (3) That the issue of the Saudi blockade of Koweit should be taken up with Ibn Saud by His Majesty’s Government on the basis of their obligation to protect the interests of Koweit.6 ( 4 ) That on receipt of the despatch promised by Colonel Fowle the whole question of relations between His Majesty s Government and Koweit might suitably be referred for further discussion to the Middle East Official Sub-Committee, to which a note should be sent recording the points discussed at the present meeting, and setting forth the argu ments for and against the possible declaration of a protectorate. Appendix A. Note by Sir Andrew Ryan. Ibn Sand’s Attitude towards Koweit. I HAVE been turning over in my mind for some time the possibility that it may be a definite object of Ibn Saud's policy to reduce Koweit to a position of dependence on him somewhat similar to that of Asir from 1926 to 1930. This is in the nature of a pure speculation, but it is a speculation so interesting that I think it worth while to collect the principal data bearing on it. It must be admitted at the outset that, if Ibn Saud had such an idea in his head, he would realise the need for great caution lest he should indispose His Majesty’s Govern ment. His only formal obligation towards the latter is that contained in articled of the Treaty of Jedda, but he understands very well the implications of the words therein “ who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment.” On the other hand, he has seen His Majesty’s Government tolerate direct correspondence on business subjects between him and the Sheikh of Koweit. He might think that they would not react over strongly if he and the Sheikh confronted them with the fait accompli of a political deal. 2. Apart from the correspondence, of which we have knowledge, there has been other intercourse between the rulers, notably the Sheikh's visit to Riadh in 1932, the secret messages brought by Ibn Saud's confidential messenger to the Sheikh early this year, and the Sheikh’s mysterious dashes intoNejd last February, when Colonel Dickson surmised that he had gone to meet some high Saudi personage, possibly Ibn Saud himself. 3. I may interpolate, as a minor indication of Ibn Saud’s attitude, a reference to two occasions on which it has been suggested or hinted by his Ministry for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty’s Government should not concern themselves with affairs between Saudi Arabia and Koweit. I class them as minor, because this position has never been categorically asserted. The first was when, in reply to a complaint of mine regarding Saudi encroachments on Koweit territory, which had perturbed His Majesty’s Government, the reply was in effect: “ Sorry you have been perturbed. You need not have been if the matter had been pursued through An. Nafisi.’ On another occasion Fuad Bey, in rather light conversa tion, asked me why we concerned ourselves in matters between his Government and Koweit. 4. The personal relations between the two rulers are peculiar. Ibn Saud grew up at Koweit, and it is sometimes said that he has shown himself ungrateful to his former hosts. It is said by others, I do not know on what precise grounds, that Mubarak treated Ibn Saud very badly. Anyhow, through all the relations there runs a thread of old friendship, how r ever flimsy and however frayed by frequent friction over raids, the embargo and so on. It has helped towards the settlement of mrnor questions. It has not deterred Ibn Saud from enforcing the embargo on trade, but the embargo on trade has not destroyed the Sheikh’s ostensible friendliness towards Ibn Saud. They are “Arcades ambo ” as I once wrote, and they both combine some real friendship for His Majesty’s Government and a healthy fear of them with a good deal of fundamental mistrust. o. I he point oi my theory or speculation is that, if the Sheikh of Koweit were at all willing to be “ Asmsed,” Ibn Saud could make the proposal quite attractive on the following lines, if I may venture to put into his mouth the sort of language he could use :— («) “ You are not really independent, my dear fellow. You are under tf thumb of the English. They might annex you at any moment, or eve presen you to Iraq. If you must be dependent on some one, wb7 be dependent on those untrustworthy imperialists, when you might depend, without being exactly dependent, on a man like me, old friend, fellow Moslem, fellow Arab and the one big independent man in Arabia? (b) “I don't like squeezing you, I really don’t, with that embargo. As things are at present, I have to think of my own interests. But if your interests were mine, we could easily have an understanding. A sort of ‘ Zollverein' as they say; same duties levied in our ports; free competition between yours and mine; free trade over our land border. What have the English done about it ? Nothing; because they cannot get at me. £ Sois mon frere et je te fais vivre. Sois le leur et je te tue.' (c) “I should not mop you up, of course. You would rule your State under an understanding with me. Indeed, if you were in with me, I might recognise a sort of influence of yours over those three Lost Tribes that you always want back. Look at how I treated the Idrisi. I made a sensible agreement with him in 1926. He remained a ruler with tribal influence. I did not take charge in his country, until he got into such a mess that he asked me to in 1930. I did not hit him on the head until the poor mutt thought he could try conclusions with me in 1932. He looked to foreigners and he got it in the neck from me. (d) “You have had trouble with Iraq over your property there. What has England been able or even willing to do for you ? If I had the right to protect you against third parties, you would find that I knew how to see you through. (e) “ Then there’s oil. People are after it in my country, and in yours, and in the Neutral Zone. Why not have an agreed policy and present a common front to the West? You know what the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is. Another name for the British Government, as we saw in Persia the other day, even if we had not known it before. Take my tip and keep them out at all costs. Play about with Holmes, if you like. But don’t trust him, and remember that in the long run your best policy would be to deal, like me, direct with American interests, using the others to put up the price.' 1 byltf 6 .

JSI August 16, 1933. ied Appendix B. Note. strust, Obligations of His Majesty's Government towards the Sheikh of Koweit. I Joutli (A )—Nature of the Undertakings given. By the agreement of the 23rd January, 1899, His Majesty s Government area 111 ' formally assured the Sheikh “ of the good offices of the British Government on# towards you, your heirs and successors, so long as you, your heirs and successorsscrupulously and faithfully observe the conditions of the said bond, under which the Sheikh had pledged himself, his heirs and successors, not to receive the agent or representative of any Power or Government at Koweit without the previous sanction of the British Government, and not to cede, sell, lease or mortgage, or give for occupation or for any other purpose, any portion of his territory to the Government or subjects of any other Power without the previous consent of His Majesty’s Government. 2 . By article 9 of the Secret Agreement of the 15th October, 1907, for the lease of the Bunder Shweikh foreshore, the Political Agent intimated that he was “ duly authorised on behalf of the precious Imperial English Government to promise, and do hereby promise, that the town of Koweit and its boundaries likewise belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him, and that all Sheikh Mobarak’s arrangements in the matter of customs, &amp;c., and all his arrangements at the present day shall remain in the hands of Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and of his heirs after him, and . . . In consideration of this promise the Sheikh undertook not to levy customs dues in excess of 4 per cent, on goods imported or exported by “the subjects of the aforesaid English Government,” save with the approval of that Government. 3 . The undertakings given in writing to the Sheikh on the 3rd November, 1914, in return for his co-operation against the Turks, contained an assurance that “ Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.” (B) —Construction of the Undertakings given to the Sheikh. 4. As will be seen, the engagements entered into by His Majesty’s Govern ment with the Sheikh are in rather general terms, and it is perhaps desirable briefly to record the construction placed upon them at various times by His Majesty’s Government. 5. In 1901, when there was a Turkish threat to Koweit, the Viceroy was informed (Secretary of State’s telegram No. 45 of the 4th December, 1901) that this ‘appears to constitute a distinct violation of the Sultan’s promise” (to respect the status quo), ” and in these circumstances His Majesty’s Government are prepared to support the Sheikh, and will not tolerate an attack by Turkish troops or ships upon Koweit. The Sheikh should not leave Koweit, and should continue to observe his engagement with us.” The assurance given is clearly limited by the words ‘ ‘ in these circumstances ’ ’ to this particular case. More over, it is not conditional on, and is independent of the Sheikh’s observance of his agreement of 1899. 6 . On the 21 st March, 1902, Lord Lansdowne, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in a memorandum on the situation in Koweit, remarked that our obligations toward the Sheikh were ” as ill-defined as the boundaries of his principality. We have distinctly announced that he does not enjoy British ‘ protection ’; on the other hand, we once made him a present of £ 1 , 000 , and promised him our £ good offices,’ whatever that may mean. When we made this piomise we were, I feel no doubt, thinking of Koweit proper, if there is such a thing, and not of Boobyan or other outskirts over which the Sheikh has rights of one sort or another We might, it seems to me, explain ( 1 ) to the Roite, (2) to the Sheikh; and (3) to the foreign Powers immediately interested the objects of our policy. I should be inclined to say that our engagements to Koweit do not extend beyond the district adjoining or close to the bay of that name, and to endeavour to obtain the adhesion of the Porte and of the Sheikh to our approximate definition of that district ” 7. Later, in 1902, it was reported that Ibn Rashid was making energetic preparation for attacking Ibn Sand, then the Sheikh of Koweit’s friend, and the Sheikh was warned not to take any action likely to bring him into difficulties with either Nejd or Turkey. About the same time the Sheikh informed us that Ibn Sand had with him a gun presented by the Turks, and asked for a gift of wo or ree guns, which it was understood were wanted for Jehara to protect Koweit against land attack. The Viceroy (telegram No. 39 of the 3 rd October, 902) pioposed to reply that the Sheikh’s request could not be granted, “but vour telSra.m ofGrf ! n Wlth , the conveyed to him in pursuance of } e e 0 iam of the 4th December, 1901 (see paragraph 5 above), His Majesty’s</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000b0_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/5/189</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000b0</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/5/189</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 4/9 I Anglo-Kuwait Relations'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1929/1937</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-02-08T22:14:56</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (212 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the first folio with 1 and terminates at the last folio with 212; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
