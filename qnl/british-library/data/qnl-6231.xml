Burne, Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Dept., To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Marine Department. I am directed to forward, for the information of the Government of Bombay, No. 139 , dated 17 th July 1873. the accompanying copy of a despatch from the Right Hon’hie the Secretary of State for India, and of its enclosures, regarding an alleged want of courtesy towards the senior Naval 0nicer ou the occasion of the visit of the \iceroy and Gover nor-General to Bombay in November 187,2. 2. r lhe Governcr-G&lt; ncral much regrets that there should have been any appearance even of a want of courtesy to Captain Grant in any of the arrange ments made under l£is Rxcelleucy s directions for the conduct &lt;&gt;f the ceremonies at Bombay; and he D els assured that nothing could have been fuither from the intention of any of those charged with the arrangements on that occasion. B. A\ ith regard to the general question of the precedence to be assigned to officers of the Royal Navy, and the mode of conducting correspondence, I am desired to remark as follows :— In the Royal Warrant of precedence, dated Oth May 1871, published* in the Gazette of India of the Sth July 1871, provision is made for an officer of the rank of Commodore only; but as since that warrant was framed, thouo-h before it was actually published, Her Majesty’s Naval Forces in the East Indies have again been placed under a Hag Officer, bolding the position and designa tion of Commander-in-Chief, His Excellency in Council is of opinion that, he should take the precedence assigned in the previous Royal Warrant of the 21st May 1862, viz., below the Commander-in-Chief in India, if not also a Alember of Council. R As regards the position of the senior Naval Officer in the absence of the Admiral Commanding-in-Chief, the Governor-General in Council is unable to discover any authority for granting him, unless holding the recognized posi tion of Commodore, any higher position than that which attaches under the precedence warrant and regulations to the rank lie may bold in the Boval Navv ; and in the Army there is no special rank assigned to the senior officer of any body of troops, however large, unless he is commissioned in consequence as a General Officer. But on extraordinary occasions, suah as durbars, processions or other public ceremonies, the Governor-General in Council thinks the representative of the Royal Navy should be specially recognized, and that on such occasions a distinctive place should, in the absence of the Naval Commander-in-Chief, be assigned to tae senior Naval Officer present, irrespective of his rank in the Roval Navv. * i It is the intention of the Viceroy also to confer on the senior Naval Officer the privilege of the entry to Government House. 5. As regards the mode of conducting correspondence, I amtoohserve that the Government of India has always been accustomed to correspond (as prescrib- cd by the Secretary of State) through the Secretary to the Government, in the Military Department (which embraces the old Atari no Department), and no other channel has ever been adopted. The Governor-General in Council leo-s that a similar practice may be observed at Bombay. 6. Should the Naval Commander-in-Cliief at anv time see fit to address the Governor-General or the Governor direct (as the Bishops do, there can be no objection, but it is considered convenient lo reply as is done in the case of the Bishops) through the Secretary to the Government in the particular depart ment to which the subject of the correspondence pertains. 7. Should the Naval Commander-in-Chief desire it, there wovdd be no objection to such correspondence as being carried on, in any particular case in which it might he convenient to adopt such a mode between His Excellency's Secretary and the Secretary to the Government, in the Alilitary (Marine) De partment.

I forward herewith a copy of a correspondence* with the Admi ralty as to the general question of the • From Admiralty, 4th June 1S73, and enclosure. position assigned to the officers of the lloy- To Admiralty, 11 th July 1873, No. 252A. ^ NaV y ^ t i ie Governments in India, arisin 0, out of the instance of a want of courtesy which the Captain of the Indian troopship Serapis was of opinion had heen shown towards him as senioi otlicer of Her Majesty’s ships and vessels present at the visit of your Excellency to Bombay, on the 14th November 1872. 2. In bringing this subject to your notice, I request that you wdll cause such steps to be taken as will insure the officers of Her Majesty’s Navy, more especially the senior officer of Her Majesty’s ships, being assigned their proper positions, and accorded those acts of courtesy w hich their rank entitles them to. 3. With reference to those portions of the accompanying papers which relate to the manner that is stated at present to prevail at Bombay, of conduct- in' official correspondence between the Government there and the officers of the Royal Navy, I request that your Government will issue such rules as may be considered right and proper for adoption; not only at Calcutta, hut also at Madras and Bombay, and all other ports within Indian limits, w ith a view to prescribing clearly the mode in winch official correspondenee shall in future h*. carried onbetween the several Governments and the Officers of Her Majesty’s Naw ; for it does not appear to me that, as was the case at Bombay, such cor respondence should have heen carried on through the Superintendent of the Marine, the head of a Department of the Government there. Such a practice should be discontinued as soon as possible. 4. It seems to me that the Secretary to Government, in the Marine De partment, is the proper channel of communication with your Government. 5. You will take care to acquaint me of your proceedings in these matters for my information and guidance, and lor communication to the Lords Commis sioners of the Admiralty. Dated Admiralty, the 4th June 1873. From—R obert Hill, Esq., To—The Under-Secretary of State, India Oflioe. # I am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to transmit to you, to he laid before the Secretary 24 th December 1872. ^ state for India in Council, copy of a letter from the Captain of Her Majesty’s S. Serapis, representing that q, want of courtesy had, in his opinion, heen shewn towards him as senior ‘ officer of Her Majesty’s ships and vessels present on the occasion of the visit of His Excellency the Viceroy of India to Bombay on the 14th November last.3 2. On receipt of Captain Grant’s letter, and before directing ibe attention of the Secrtary of State to the matter, my Lords called for a report from the Naval Commander-in-Chief on the East India Station, Hear-Admiral Camming, both with reference to the complaint of Captain Grant, and to the general question of the position assigned to the o Tice is of the Koval Navy by the Indian authorities. 1 he Heai-Admiral in his reply has endorsed the views of Captain Grant; and states that he is of opinion that the r ink and position of the officers of Her Majesty’s Navy was not sufficiently recognized by the Eombay officials. 3. My Lords request that you will submit to tbo consideration of the Secretary of State that in all Her Majesty’s Colonies the Military and Naval Commanders-in-Chief rank next after the Governor of the Colony, and take precedence of the Lieutenant-Governor of the Division of Canada; and that in all public ceremonies, naval officers have always been assigned their proper positions as representing an important- service of the mothei-country, and while their Lordships would regret that any misunderstanding on this point should exist, thev do not wish to enter into the question further than to express a hope that the Secretary of State for India will soe lit to take such steps as His Grace may, under the circumstances, consider desirable to insure the officers of Her Majesty’s Navy, more especially the senior officer of Her Majesty’s ships and vessels, being assigned their proper positions and accorded those acts of couvtesv which their Lordships consider their rank entities them to, and which their Lordships feel assured the Secretary oi State can Lave no desire, should he withheld. 4. Their Lordships desire me, before concluding, to remark that it appears to them that the correspondence in this ease has not been conducted in the usual official manner, having been carried on through the Superintendent of Marine, to whom Officers Commanding Dated 13th April isos. ]-£ er Majesty’s ships are in no way respon sible, instead of directly with the Government of Bombay; and they would suggest that instructions may be given to the Governors of the several presi dencies, when corresponding with the senior officers of the Boyal Navy, to act in accordance with the provisions of the enclosed circular, which was issued by the Admiralty after communication with the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and which has been since embodied in the Queen s Regulations and Admiralty instructions. Dated Her Majesty’s S. S era pis at Portsmouth, the 24th December 1872. From— Captain H. D. Grant, To—Rear-Admiral Sir F. L. McClintock, Kt., Senior Officer. The peculiar position in which I was placed during the stay of Her Majes ty’s ship under my command at Bombay, on the arrival of His Excellency the Viceroy on the 14th November, and the subsequent State occasions, compels me to brin 0 * the circumstances to your notice for the information of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, with a view to obtaining their Lordships’ instructions for future guidance. 2. On my arrival at Bombay on the 8th November, I heard that His Excel lency the Viceroy was expected on the 14th, and that the Government had requested Commander Cay, of- Her Majesty's S. Rultiore, to remain fire such salutes as might be required. Lnder these circumstances I called on His Excellency the Governor Sir P. Wodebouse that day, and acquainted him that as I should be the Senior Naval Officer in the port during the ap proaching visit of the Viceroy, I had come to ascertain what his viishes were. Sir P. Wodehouse replied that he expected the Admiral, and I told him that, although 1 had nothing official, I was in possession of private information that the Admiral intended remaining at Trincomalee. His Excellency then told me I should be communicated with further. 3. I heard nothing until the 12th, when, after a verbal request to the Superintendent of Marine, I received a memorandum enclosing the Govcrnmennotification of tbe programme intended to he followed, which, however, did not provide for the I\avy. Upon this l wrote to the Secretary to Government, Marine Department, and asked him to ascertain what the Governor’s wishes were; and on the morning of the 14th I received a letter from the Secretary, informing me that it was wished that Ilis Excellency should he received with the same ceremonies as on the occasion oi landing from the Glasgoio in April last, and also stating that the Superintendent of Marine had been directed to communicate with me. Simultaneously I received a private note from the Superintendent of Marine, acquainting me that His Excellency had been accompanied to the landing place by Admirals Cumming and Seymour, and the Captains in tin dr galleys. Einding, however, that it was the intention on this occasion for the Superinten dent of Marine to furnish the boat, I claimed that privilege on behalf of the Navy. The reply that I received was a request that the arrangements already ordered to he carried out might not be disturbed. 4. The Dalhousie, with His Excellency the Governor-General on hoard, arrived at noon of the 14th November, and was received by Her Majesty’s ships ^ in port being dressed with flags, yards manned, and a Royal salute fired. As soon as the Dalhousie anchored, I went on board and acquainted an Aide-de- camp that I had come as Senior Naval Oflicerto pay my respects to the Viceroy, ' and was informed that His Excellency was engaged with the Governor, and could not see me. I said I wished especially to ascertain what w'ero his wdshes as to landing. The Aide-de-Camp replied that the authorities in Bombay made the arrangements, and then I said they had acquainted me that they wished the same proceedings to he followed as in the case of the landing from the Glasgow) and as in that case of His Excellency had landed in the Glasgow's barge, I was prepare d to furnish the boat, and direct the Captains to be present. The Aide-de-Camp replied that he would mention it to the Viceroy, and I should he communicated with, but nothing more transpired. At 4-30 p.m. the boats were in atten lance, and the disembarkation took place. The Captains of Her Majesty’s ships in their galleys saluted and followed in the wake of the Viceroy’s boat without any recognition either then or on landing except being received at the steps by Commander Robinson, late Indian Navy, and Superin tendent. The ships manned yards and saluted. 5. On the occasions of having the honour of meeting the Viceroy at din ner at Government House on 18th November, and at the Maharajah Scindiah’s banquet on the 21st, no seat was assigned to me; hut at the Byculia Club a seat was set apart for me as the Senior Naval Officer. 6. The Naval service was, on the IGth November, honoured in the nomin ation of Lieutenant Lake, Senior Lieutenant of Her Majesty’s S. Serapis as Extra Naval Aile de-Camp, for the ceremony of the chapter of the Star of India; and while much appreciating the consideration, I have with regret felt compelled, in upholding the dignity of the service, to mention the foregoing circumstances, as I am confident that no one would regret more than His Ex cellency the Viceroy, or His Excellency Sir i\ Wodehouse, anything even ap proaching a slight of the Royal Navy ; but it was equally apparent that their staff were unacquainted with the status of the Sene r Naval Officer; and as this is not the first occasion, even with myself in which that has been shewn, I believe it would tend to more harmony, if the Government of Bombay were authoritatively informed of his position. 1 7. It will he seen that the correspondence with His Excellency and the Governor was through the Secretary to Government, Marine Department,—a practice I found had been pursued for some time in Bombay, hut which seems to me not in accordance with Art. 346, page 114 of the Addenda, 186S. On the present occasion, had there been direct communication with His Excellency the Governor, there could have been no doubt as to the part the Navy should take in these ceremonies. 4 (Conimu should veyim AVatei the L points A is to s of Fla Office] munic racter bet we Force' .4 Comm the Cc whose Ihroui • I the re patch and pi and th oondu Navy. 2 , Grant, teotlsh bay in Excel! tary o an ex which 3 Comm Vicerc nary i High i ‘ 4. the Nj ed by letter nary o5 J 1 Circular No. 41. c M.

(Communications between GoTernovs of Colonies and Naval Officers. Notifications to Commanders of Foreign Vessels in Colonial Waters.) Questions having arisen as to the mode in which Governors of Colonies should communicate with officers of Her Majesty’s Navy, and the mode of con veying notic.es of different kinds to Commanders of Foreign Vessels in Colonial Waters, it has been arranged between the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, that the following rules ou these points shall be followed, viz. : — A Governor will write in his own name to any Senior Naval Officer (that is to say, the Senior Officer then within his immediate reach), holding the rank of Flag Officer, Captain, or Commander, hut will communicate with any Senior Officer of lower rank through his Private Secretary. In no case will he com municate through the Colonial Secretary, whose functions are of a different cha racter, and whose office should not be the place of deposit for communications between the Governor and officers in command of Her Majesty’s Naval Forces. Any notice or direction conveyed by the authority of a Governor to the Commander of auy Foreign Vessel should be conveyed through the officers of the Colonial Government, and not through the Officers of Her Majesty’s Navy, whose intervention should not he applied for, unless the directions conveyed through the ordinary channel should fail to produce any effect. No. 961, dated Bombay Castle, the 22nd September 1873. I rom —Lieutenant-Colon el J. Macdonald, Secretary to the Government of If m- bay, Marine Department, To— tColonel H. K. Buknk, Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Depart ment. I am directed by His Excellency the Governor in Council to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 45 of the 28th ultimo, enclosing copies of a des patch from the Secretary of State and other papers, relative to the precedence and proper recognition on public occasions of the Naval Commander-iu-Chief and the officers of the Royal Navy in general, and also relative to the mode of conducting official correspondence between Indian Governments and the Navy. 2. This correspondence has had its. origin on a complaint made by Captain Grant, Commanding Her Majesty’s troop-ship Serapis, of having been discour teously treated in certain quarters on the occasion of the Viceroy’s visit to Bom bay in November last; and as this complaint is in its nature very personal, His Excellency in Council has thought it expedient to forward direct to the Secre tary of State, for the information of His Grace and the Lords of the Admiralty, an explanation of all that occurred with Captain Grant, in the despatch of which I enclose a copy. 3. As regards the precedence to he assigned for the future to the Naval Commander-in-Chief, it is understood to be the wish of His Excellency the viceroy in Council, that a position should he assigned to him between the ordi nary members of the Council of this Presidency and puisne Judges of the High Court, and directions will be given accordinglv. 4. In the absence of the Naval Commander-in-Chief, the Senior Officer of the Navy present in Bombay will, on ordinary occasions, take the place assign ed by existing regulations to officers of the rank, whatever it may be. Your letter does not state precisely in what position lie should, on extraordi nary occasions, be placed as the representative of the Navy, but as it is to be6 presumed that he ought not to he placed at any time in a position higher than that given in the Table of Precedence for the Commodore, His Excellency in Council would suggest that if a Post Captain, he should take rank immediately after the Chief Secretary to this Government, and that if a Commander, he should follow immediately after the other Secretaries to this Government and any Major-General in the Army. 5. With regard to correspondence, His Excellency in Council is disposed to recommend that if His Excellency the Viceroy sees objections to answers being addressed by the Governor to the Xaval Commander-in-Chief, it should be understood that the Secretary of the latter shall address himself to the Secre tary to Government in the Military and Marine Departments, and that all Xaval Officers of lower rank than the Commander-in-Chief shall address the same authority. 6. His Excellency in Council will be glad to learn how far these sugges tions meet with tlie approval of the Government of India. No. 42, dated Bombay Castle, the 22nd September 1873. Prom—The Government of Bombay, Marine Department, To—Her Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for India, India Office, London. We have received from the Government of India copies of Your Grace’s military despatch No. 139 of 17th July last, and its enclosures, and hasten to express our regret, that in consequence of a representation made by the Captain of Her Majesty’s troop-ship Serapis you should have thought it necessary, in accordance with the request of the Lords of the Admiralty, to direct through the Government of India, that those acts of courtesy which their rank entitles them to, should be accorded to the officers of the Royal Navy. 2. No previous explanation was invited from us, and perhaps it did not occur to you, that at the time when the transactions referred to took place, the several departments of this Government in Bombay were working under a very severe pressure in making the necessary arrangements for the reception not only of the Viceroy and members and Officers of the Government of India by whom he was accompanied, hut also of the numerous Native Princes and Chiefs who presented themselves at Bombay. 3. In such circumstances it would certainly have been excusable if some unintentional slight had been otfered to the Captain of one of Her Majesty’s troop ships, which during the season pass frequently into and out of the harbour of Bombay, who had happened to arrive a few days before, and was senior to the Commander of the only regular ship-of-war lying in the harbour. But we are not prepared to admit that any “ want of courtesy ” was shewn to this officer. 4. After Captain Grant’s arrival he was received by the Governor, who before the close of the interview said he “ should he communicated with further.” Two days before the Viceroy’s arrival he voluntarily and verbally applied to the Suprintendent of Marine, with whom,’as the President Transport Officer, he is in constant communication, and whom he perfectly well knew to he entrusted with the control of the Government business of the Port and the Marine arrange ments for the landing of the Viceroy. This led to his being furnished on the same day by the Secretary to Government with a copy of the General Noti fication for the regulation of the ceremonial. On the same day Captain Grant acknowledged its receipt, wrote to the Secretary that he had given the neces sary instructions for the Naval Honours and of his own accord forwarded officially to the Superintendent of Marine a copy of the order ke had issued, including those for the Procession of Boats. 5. Nevertheless, Captain Grant enquired officially the next day of the Secretary to Government what arrangements should be made for the disembarkation, and was told in reply, “ that the procedure adopted on the occasion of His Excellency the Viceroy’s first landing from England should, os far as the means at your disposal will admit, be adhered to on the present occa sion.” 6. This is the only error we are prepared to admit in the whole transaction, and that was no breach of courtesy. Lord Northbrook, when he first arrived,7 landed in one of the boats of Her Majesty’s S. Glasgow. Captain Grant accordingly claimed to land His Excellency in one of the boats of the Serapis which was declined in view of the arrangements already made. When Lord Northbrook first arrived, he came as a passenger in the Glasgow, and it was quite right that she should deliver him on shore. When His Excellency came the second time, he came in a steamer of this Government, and it rested with the Government of Bombay to bring him on shore. 7. With regard to the complaint that the officers of the Navy were not re cognized on landing, we are at a loss to understand what was expected. All the chief civil and military officers were assembled on the occasion in honour of the Viceroy. The military performed their share of the ceremonies. The Navy did the same. What special recognition of the latter was expected, or at the * time practicable ? 8. The next complaint is, that when Captain Grant met the Viceroy at dinner at Government House on the 18th November, no seat was assigned to him. 9. The party consisted of rather more than seventy, of whom nineteen were ladies. It is the practice at Government House to allot seats to the ladies and to the gentlemen who conduct them to the table, and to leave the other gentle men to take their places at their pleasure. Among the gentlemen of the party in question there were present, besides the Viceroy and the Governor, two Members of the Council of India, a Bishop, a Member of the Bombay Council, three Members of the Legislative Council, a Secretary to the Government of India, an English Peer, four Major-Generals, or persons holding that rank according to the Table of Precedence, and other high officers. No ' want of courtesy ” there fore was shewn to the Captain of the Serapis, to whom, as his rank was inferior to that of those whom we have enumerated, no lady was allotted. 10. We trust that this explanation will satisfy Your Grace and the Lords of the Admiralty, to whom we hope it will be forwarded, that no “ want of courtesy ” was shewn to Captain Grant, and that with this explanation, which we had no previous opportunity of offering, their Lordships will be prepared to admit that we did not need to be admonished of our duty as to the courteous treatment of naval officers. No. 38 Rank, dated Simla, the 31st October 1873. From— Colonel H. K. Burne, Secretary to the Government of India, Marine De* partment, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Marine Department. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 961, dated the 22nd September 1873, and in reply to state, for the information of the Govern ment of Bombay, that the position proposed to be given to the representative of the Royal Navy on extraordinary occasions, viz., Durbars and other public ceremonials, maybe acted upon, pending the receipt of an answer shortly expect ed from the Secretary of State. 2. In regard to the method of conducting correspondence, I am to state that the opinion of Admiral Gumming will be asked, when, as expected, His Excel lency comes to Calcutta in the winter, and a further communication made for the information of His Excellency the Governor in Council. No. 23, dated Simla, the 1st September 1873. From—The Government of India, To—Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. We have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Grace’s despatch No. 139 of the 17th July 1873, regarding an alleged want of courtesy towards the Senior Naval Officer on the occasion of the visit of the Viceroy and Governor- General to Bombay on November 1872. 2. The Governor-General regrets that there should have been any appear ance even of a want of courtesy towards Captain Grant, and feels assured thatnothing could have been further from the intention of the Government of Bombay or of those charged with the ceremonial arrangements on that occasion. 3. A copy of our Secretary’s letter to the Government of Bombay is here with forwarded, conveying our views and instructions in regard to the mode of procedure to be adopted for the future, and these we trust w r ill meet the approval of Her Majesty’s Government. 4. Correspondence with the Naval Gommander-in-Chief or with the Senior Naval Officer for the time, has invariably been carried on by the Govern ment of India through the channel indicated by your Grace, mz., the Secretary to the Government in the Military (Marine)Department. . 5. As the position of the Commander-in-Chief of Her Majesty’s Naval Forces is not defined in the latest warrant of precedence, the command of these forces having again been placed in the hands of a Flag Officer, we think he should take rankm the Table of Precedence next below the Commander-in- Chief in India, if not a Member of Council. This position is similar to that assigned in the previous warrant of 1855, and we would request your Grace’s sanction to this being notified. 6. As regards the Senior Officer of the Boyal Navy in the absence of the Commander-in-Chief, we do not consider that any precedence be assigned to him ordinarily, beyond that attaching to his rank in the Royal Navy ; but w r e have given instructions that on all extraordinary occasions, such as Durbars, processions or other public ceremonies, the representative of the Royal Navy should be specially recogniaed and a distinctive place, in the absence of the Commander-in-Chief, be assigned to the Senior Naval Officer irrespective of his rank in the Royal Navy, and the Viceroy has given directions that the Senior Naval Officer shall have the private entree to Government House.

The matter has been fraught with a good deal ofl difficulty to me as a newcomer from the following causes:- (a) The records in this Agency of past procedure in this connection are very meagre indeed, the matter having appa rently been often arranged verbally and no written record kept of salutes asked for or fired. (I attach for your in- -formationan abstract memorandum of such references to the subject as my office files contain.) (b) The instructions on the subject.in the hands of Na- -val Officers are so worded as to ^capable of being vanous- -ly interpreted by the commanders of different ships. for example In some instances an affirmative answer by the Political Agent to a verbal query from the Naval Comman - der as to whether a salute was advisable^ has been consider . -ed by the latter sufficient for firing one. In others, a writteJSLrequest has been asked for but when given has oeen accepted without question, the responsibilityresponsibility for the expediency of a salute being thereby allowed to rest with the Political Agent. In otherF ag^in the Political Agent has been asked to go into his reasons for considering a salute advis. -able, the commander of H.M.Vessel in question thus becoming the judge of their adequacy. (3.) In my own case. I have done my best to supplement the paucity of written precedents by indenting on the memo- -ries of members of the Agency establishment of long local experience; they have however been able to afford little prac- -tical assistance as their evidence only tends to support the fact that there has been a great want of consistency in time past in pf the matter of salutes, and that the firing of them has depended sipon two factors, neither of them constant in themselves or in their relation to one anothei• namely in the first placejbhe degree of cordiality at the time of the relations existing between the British Government (and its representative) and the Sultah; and in the second the indivi dual judgment of the Naval Officer commanding the vessel for the time being in Muscat Harbour, and the interpretation pla£? «ed by him on his orders from the Admiralty. Sugh being the case it will I think be conceded that the matter, as it stands now is likeljs to remain a source of doubt and difficulty and that it requires to be placed upon a somewhat more defined ba- -sis than is at present the case. (4. ) The occasions on which the question of the firing of a salute arises may be summed up as follows;- two (I) 1st January / On these occassions the Sultan fires a (II) 24th: May. j salute of 31 guns in honor of Her Ma,jes- -ty the Queen Empress, and I respectfully that if any vessel A of the Royal Navy be in harbour at the time, the salute should as a matter of course be returned. &lt;• “ (III) The Eed-ul-Pitr or Ramzan Eed on lst:Shaban. These (IV)The M Eed-ul-Kabir M or Bakri Eed on 10th: Zil Hijjeh.J are the two great festivals in the year at Muscat. The Flagstaffs of foreignforeign Consuls are always dressed for the occasion in honor #of the Ruler and it is evident from my records, and from the testimony of members of the establishment that i: subject to the conditions mentioned in Para:3 it has been the custom for any of H.M.*s vessels in Harbour to pa# the Sultan the compliment of saluting his flag on one occasion or the other. I am of opinion seeing that the Sul tan fires salutes for Her Majesty on occasions I &amp; II it would be both courteous and politic to return the complement at all events on one of these festivals, the salute being fired on a request from the Political Agent and on the un- -derstanding that it will be returned. As regard these two the procedure followed at Constantinople might, I suggest.be ascertained, the information being likely to ase -sist in the consideration of what it is desirable to ac- -cord the Sultan of Muscat. ^) On the first arrival of one of HIM.Ships in Muscat and afterwards once during the year on arrival and on hear- -ing that it will be returned. (VJ) Whenever the Sultan pays an official visit to one of H. M . 9 s Ships usually only once djiring a commission. (5-) Thft/focal conditions place Muscat in regard to sa- -lutes fired by H.M.'s vessels in a peculiar position, re- -quiring special handlin^and furthermore^that the treat- -ment accorded to the Ruler in this respect is regarded lo- -cally as a gauge of their relations between him and the British Government, has been officially recognised for a long time past, am?the case partially met^but I think the Agency records of which a samunary is attached will make it &amp; w f evident that it has been the opinion of predecessors of min£. as it is my own that some further adjustment is call -ed for, and the suggestions now made (in para.4 above) are those which suggest themselves to me as being adequate and not excessive. (6.) With regard to the amount of discrimination tojbe made betwedS^w vesselsvessels classed in Admiralty Regulations as ’’saluting' of 'non-saluting' it is hardly gor me to of£er an# remark. It is a matter in which technical considerations and the exigencies ol the Naval Service come into play^ in respect of which a lay- -man cannot have full knowledge and seems to depend upon the 9 . . i amount of concession and relaxation of regulations which the naval authorities find it possible to make. I will only ob serve that as far as six months eKperience of the Royal Navy vessels in the station enables me to judge^it does not appear that Service Regulations apart, any one of them have or would find much practically difficulty in giving salutes when re- -quired, on the lines now suggested. (7.) As between the Agency and the Residency there seems no object in not putting this communication in official form^ but should you consider that there is a case for representa- -tion to Government I beg you will use it in such form as may seem expedient. I have etc: etc: Capt. H.B.M.C. &amp; P.A. Muscatv J- Abstract of Muskat Agoncy regarding salutes to Sultan of Muskat. j.

Of these, NOs. 390-391, 396, 399, 401-402, contain re -ferences pertinent to the present question. 2 . The next record is dated 22nd: May, 1882, when the Poli -tical Agent asked H. M.

The Commander repli -ed that he did not consider that the reason given justified him in saluting, but agreed to do so on condition that the Sultan did not expect any more from fresh arriving ships'*. The Sultan refused to accept the salute on this condition^ it was not given and His Highness was told that the question might be considered pending. There is an office note in the file to the effect that the matter should go to the Resident with the Political Agent's comments, but I can find no re cord of this ever having been done. On August 4th: of the following year, 1883, the Politic -al Agent wrote to the Commander of H. M. S. 'Woodlark', to- -morrow is the Eed of Ramzan and it has been customary for , any of Her Majesty's vessels lying in the Port of Muscat on that day, to fire a Royal salute'. The Commander and Senior Naval Officer replied that a Royal salute would be fired ac- -cordingly and that H. M. S. 'Woodlark' would 'dress ship'. The next reference that I can find is the Resident, Colonel Wilson's demi- official letter to Captain Seville dated 6th August, 1896. Major Sadler's demi-official of 6th: December, 1895, referred to in the opening sentence thereof is not traceable, but it is doubtless on your files as also Captain Seville's reply dated Ilth: September,1396. (X beg to draw attention to the views expressed by Matter officer). Nqthing ensued until 26th: November, 1897, when thethe Resident asked for Major Fagan's views on the subject The latter apparently over- looked the matter, ana it has remained in its present unsatisfactory state until the present time. Since my arrival in October, 1899, I have made written requisitions for salutes (I) to H. M. S. 'Sphinx' on 1st: January, 1900, in response to His Highness's salute to the Queen-Empress.

Dear Mons. Ottavi, The Senior Naval officer has received a reply from His Excellency the Commander-in-chief of the East Indian Station, to his reference on the question of your Consular Salute. The Admiral holds that in the case once saluted you with 9 guns as Vice-Consul, the Command er was not justified in firing such a salute, and he now instructs the Senior Naval Officers that in view of the fact that the British Admiralty Regulations clearly lay d down 7 guns as a salute provided for the rank of Consul a and do not permit any increase in this number as a compli ment to the Consul of a Foreign Power, no variation should.take place. The Senior Naval Oflicer thereioie de sires me to inform you as above and to say with his com pliments that the Commander of H.B.M.'s Cossack will now oe happy to receive your official visit and to salute you on your leaving his ship with 7 guns. cited by you in which a British Man-of-war (H.M.'s Cossack) ever Yours sincerely.The Secretary to the Government of India Foreign Department, CALCUTTA, Dated MUSKAT POLITICAL AGENCY, January, 12th: 1901. Sir, Referring to Marine Department letter No.547 dated 28th: September, to the address fof H. E. Rear-Admiral Bosan- quet, and in continuation of my letter No. 493 of the same date on the subject of the Salute claimed by the French Con sul at Muskat, I have the honour to forward for the inform ation of th© Government of India, copies of further corres pondence which has ensued, as detailed in the list accompany ing. Copies of Enclosures Nos.2 to 10 have at the request of the Senior Naval Officer and Commander H. M. S. 'Cossack' been furnished to him for the information of H. E. the Com mander- in-Chief. 2. I beg to offer a few words of comment with regard to certain of the enclosures. Enclosure No.6 It will be noticed that Captain Kiesel does not-write, as one would have expected from Mons: Otta- vi's point of view: 'I will give the British Consul the same salute as the ships of his own Navy give him'. He writes: 'I will give the British Consul the 11 guns that you (i.e. Mons: Ottavi) asked of me for yourself'. That is to say the 11 guns were given to Mons: Ottavi not on the strength of any instructions or Regulations within the knowledge of Captain Kiesel but simply because Mons: Ottavi demanded it. I may mention that the American Consul only got a salute ol 7 guns from the same ship. E nclosure No.8 Mons: Ottavi's allusion to his indispo sition is a good deal overdrawn. He was not suiiering irom anythinganything worse than an attack of malarial fever with which he habitually suffers from time to timeand may at the most have missed one mail steamer by reason of it. Under the cir cumstances it is not unreasonable to suspect that he has either made no specific reference to his Government in the matter at all, or that if he has done so the reply received has not been satisfactory to him. insure Mo. 10 The paucity and unsoundness of the pre cedents upon which the French Consul relies so much in pres sing a presumptive right to a special salute, has been before pointed out. He is quite inaccurate in stating or inferring here that vessels of Her Majesty's Navy and Indian Marine have, among others, accorded him a salute of 11 guns. No Bn- tish ship has done so. 5&lt; The question of international etiquette involved in the non-return of an official visit which according to ordinary usage, should invariably be returned within 24 hours, is one with which, I am not concerned except in so far as the in cident may give rise to undesirable gossip on shore. I sub mit however that if the French Consul considers as he admittedly does that it is a matter oi the highest importance to him that the salute accorded to him should not be less than that received by the British representative, his proper course was to seek to have the matter arranged by c\ specific . ^r, means of^official entente between our respective foreign 01 fices, and ghat his persistent endeavour to bring about the result which he desires in a manner both unconstitutional and entailing discourtesy to a British man of war to which unfortunately a good deal of unnecessary prominence has been given by the Press, is a matter which, I venture to suggest, it would be well if Her Majesty's Government could take some notice. 4 . * H.M.S.'Cossack' left here yesterday for Bombay and her Commander expressed his intention oi reporting the matter to H.

Cox, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul and Political Agent at Maskat, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I have the honour to make a reference to the Government of India under the following circumstances, connected with the official attitude of my French colleague. 2. Ever since Her Majesty w r as proclaimed Empress of India, the 1st January has been celebrated in Maskat as “ Queen-Empress’s Day ”, as in India, in the following several ways:— (a) The flagstaff at the British Consulate is dressed, and the detachment of Native Infantry stationed in Maskat parade and fire a feu de joie. (b) The Sultan with his suite pays an official visit to the British Representative; dresses the flagstaffs on his forts; fires an Imperial salute of 31 guns, and flies the Union Jack above his Saluting Battery throughout the day. (c) Her Majesty’s gun-boat in harbour “ dresses ship ” and fires a similar salute. (d) Deputations from the British Indian communities (Hindu and Muhammadan), and the principal well-disposed Arab subjects, visit the British representative during the day to express senti ments of loyalty and respect for Her Majesty. (e) The British Consul usually gives a semi-official dinner-party to his colleagues and the officers of Her Majesty’s ship in harbour in honour of the occasion. 3. I was informed in December 1899 that Mons. Ottavi habitually absented himself on these occasions, but I hoped that, as I was then a new arrival in Maskat, he might be inclined to make a fresh start. However, on that occasion, after accepting invitations to dine at this Consulate on Christmas and New Year’s Days, he left for Seeb just before Christinas, and then wrote in to say that he was too ill to return. His Consular flagstaff was not dressed, and he remained away until the night of the 1st or morning of the 2nd January, but returned in time to receive a New Year’s visit from the Sultan on the 2nd. This year he pursued exactly the same tactics, evading invitations to dine at this Consulate (though he readily accepts at any other time), and refraining from dressing his flagstaff, but returning at nightfall on the 1st, so as to obtain the Sultan’s New Year’s visit on the 2nd. The explanation of his conduct is that Mons. Ottavi does not recognise Her Majesty the Queen’s Imperial status in Maskat, and takes upon himself to give expression to this sentiment in the studied manner described, lie will not in fact identify himself with any act, such as the dressing of his flagstaff or joining a semi-official gathering of Englishmen at this Consulate, which could be ascribed to any recognition on his part of “ Queen-Empress’s Day At the same time he takes care not to let his own personal or national dignity suffer by arranging to get back soon enough after 1st January to qualify for the usual New Year’s visit from the Sultan. In a more civilised community, which would assign to it its proper value, this narrow-minded attitude of the French Consul, though it savours of international discourtesy 7 , might perhaps be considered beneath specific notice and best ignored, but the position in Maskat is a peculiar one. The public notice that on the Queen’s Birthday, Mons. Ottavi (intentionally or otherwise) is always away at Sur (though on this occasion he does have his flagstaff dressed) and that on the Queen-Empress s $Day he pointedly absents himself for the occasion and allows his flagstaff to remain the only one “ undressed ”, but yet returns immediately after nightfall in order to receive the Sultan’s visit in the morning. On the other hand, they notice that on the French National Day the British Consul, and sometimes a British man-of-war, dress their flags for the occasion, and that the former invariably pays the French Consul a complimentary visit. The interpretation placed upon this contrast of attitude by the ignorant native, to whose undesirable comment Mons. Ottavi recently made such pointed reference in connection with the question of his own salute, is not that the latter’s action is a form of discourtesy which we do not trouble to take notice of, or reciprocate, hut that it must surely be evidence of the power and independence of the nation whose representative can afford thus habitually to slight Her Majesty or the British Government year after year. Some such impression exists, and Mons. Ottavi may he expected to make the most of it. 4. I have the honour to enquire, therefore, whether the Government of India consider that we have sufficient locus standi to invite Foreign Consuls formally on the Queen-Empress’s day, as is done on the Queen’s Birthday, to “dress” their flagstnffs for the occasion, and failing that, whether steps should he taken to inform the Sultan, who has himself spontaneously commented to me upon Mons. Ottavi’s attitude, that under the circumstances it would he considered a friendly act on his part if he were to intimate to the French Consul that he would be unable to pay him a New Year’s visit in future unless he could make it convenient to receive him on New Year’s morning, as do the other Consuls. I may mention, in conclusion, that the American Consul dresses his flagstaff on 1st January; not, I understand, specially in honour of the Queen-Empress, but because New Year’s Day is an American holiday and because the Sultan visits him on that day.Wmm India Office, London, Hth June 1901.

I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to state that he has given bis consideration to the papers enclosed in your letter of 23rd March, relative to the manner in which the French Consul at Muscat avoids recognising the anniversary of the proclamation of Her late Majesty as Empress of India. Lord Lansdowne does not think that the British Consul at Muscat could properly address a formal invitation to the Consuls of other Powers to dress their flagstaffs on this occasion. His Lordship, on the other hand, sees no reason why the French Consul should receive invi tations to the British Consulate on that day. It would be better to treat the occasion as one in which the Sultan and population of Muscat and the British Consulate and community are interested, but in which the French Consul is not concerned. As regards the celebration of the day which the King may for the future designate as the national festival, Lord Lansdowne thinks that Captain Cox may be authorised to take the French Consul’s conduct on this occasion as the standard for his own observance of the French national day, provided always that in so doing he avoids any appearance of resentment, or disrespect to France. Lord Lansdowne would deprecate the matter being made a subject.of discussion between Captain Cox and the Sultan.

Sir, I have the honour to state that recent inconsistencies in the firing of Consular oalutes in Muscat, which will be found recorded in the Weekly Political Diaries of this Agency for the past and current weeks, make it advisable for me to make a further reference to the Government of India on the subject. 2 years ago 2 . It will be remembe^red that Monsieur Ottavi, then French Consul, refused to return the official visit of the Commander of the 'Cossack 1 ’ because the latter was unable to accord him the 11 gun salute which he claimed. The Commander’s action was fully supported by the Naval 0om- mander-in-Chief, vide his memorandum of 12th October 1900, forming Enclosure No.1 to this Office letter No.13 da-ed 12th January 1901 to your address. I may mention here in pass.ing that up to the time of Monsieur Ottavi’s departure from Muscat, nearly a year later, he did not return the call either officially or privately; as how ever he originally informed the Commander that he was refer ring the matter to Monsieur Dclcasso, possibly some excha’go of views may have taken place in London or Paris, of which i for mation has not reached the Commander of the 'Cossack' or myoolf 3- Monsieur Laronce, who sue ceded Monsieur Ottavi, is of the rank of Vice-Consul, but has received salutes of 9 guns from French mcn-of-war visiting Muscat si:.-o hi-j arrival here.Thus on the 20th instant the French Cruiser u Friant ,f on ar rival in Muscat harbour accorded him 9 guns. On Mr Mackirdy, / head of the British Merchantile Firm of Towcll &amp; Co,, and tf Vice and Acting Consul u for America, calling on the same ves sel 2 days later he was given 11 guns. Yesterday the American man-of-war u Isla do Luzon ,r also arriv ed and gave Mr Mackirdy 7 guns, the ,T Friant tf being at the time in harbour, a cable’s length away. As to myself, since I found 2 years ago thatljty salute as a Political Agent was a subject of embarrassment to my colleagues, I have never called on any Foreign man-of-war officially, but have exchanged calls privately. This paying of official calls by Consuls on Foreign mcn-of-war was the custom in Muscat when I arrived hero, but it seems to me to be quite an un in necessary proceeding and so fer as I know is nol^vogue anywhere else. At the same time when Commanders of Foreign men-of-war want assistance from the British Consulate^as they not infre quently do in one form or another^ii may occur that they come on shore officially without warning and then His Majestyts Representative has no alternative but to return the call in like manner. 4* Tt will be realised from what has already been re ported that the salutes given by the ships of civilized Powers to Consuls at Muscat are at present inconsistent, not co say faciful, and the reason of this is, no doubt, the 11 gun saluce which the British Representative at Muscat is en titled to from British men-of-war as a Political Agent of the Government of India, ihere seem to be two means of arriving at a satisfactory un derstanding, (a) Either that the Political Agent at Muscat should be officially authorized to inform Foreign men-of- war ihav. his salute is 7 guns when occasion arises, while still receiving 11 guns from British men-of-war(l&amp;) ( A ,f on ar- yy yi according to the present Naval Regulations, or not , r Maokird^, as may be considered expedient. This should be con • ^ and dition al O’ the 8t’-feer Consuls of other Powers accepting same ves- a similar purely Consular salute from our ships. (b) Or that the French and American Governments should be Iso arriv officially asked to inform His MAJEdTY ! s Government al the what is the salute which they authorize, for their Vice-Consuls and Consuls at Muscat, with a view to ute as a the British Admiralty issuing the necessary instruc y colleagues, tions to the Commander-in-Chief of the East Indian ially, but bquadron.

The question of uni call in form seems unimportant, but if the first proposal is adopted it would be advisable for him to fly the British Flag instead of Deen re- the Indian pattern. ized 5.

Laronce gets from a French man-of-war the 7 guns to which he is entitled or the 9 guns to which he has proper claim. So long as our ships give him his proper salute only, the Government of India need not oDject. That the American man-of-war gave Mr. Mackirdy 7 guns just after he had received 11 guns from the French cruiser should hardly prove a cause of exultation to the latter though possibly the French Captain may have taken credit for superior politeness* *he fact that nothing more has been heard of Mons. Ottavi's protest to the French Government about the refusal of the Cossack to give him 11 guns, shows that the French G &gt;vernment are not &gt;e P ared to demand this honour from Foreign ships oi war, and the matter may, it is thought, safely be allowed to rest.

Z. Cox, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty's Consul and Political Agent, Maskat, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to state that recent inconsistencies in the firing of Consular salutes in Maskat, which will he found recorded in the weekly diaries of this Agency for the past and current weeks, make it advisable for me to make a further reference to the Government of India on the subject. * 2. It will be remembered that two years ago Monsieur Ottavi, then French Consul, refused to return the official visit of the Commander of the Cossack because the latter was unable to accord him the 11-gun salute which he claimed. The Commander’s action was fully supported by the Naval Commander- in-Chief, vide Memorandum of 12th October 19C0, forming enclosure No. 1 to this Office letter No. 13, dated 12th January 1901, to your address. I may mention here in passing that up to the time of Monsieur Ottavi’s departure from Maskat, nearly a year later, lie did not return the call either officially or privately; as however he originally informed the Commander that he was referring the matter to Monsieur Delcass6, possibly some exchange of views may have taken place in London or Paris, of which information has not reached the Commander of the Cossack or myself. 3. Monsieur Laronce, who succeeded Monsieur Ottavi, is of the rank of Vice-Consul, but has received salutes of 9 guns from Prench men-of-war visiting Maskat since his arrival here. Thus on the 20th instant the french Cruiser Friant on arrival in Maskat harbour accorded him 9 guns. On Mr. Mackirdy, head of the British Mercantile Firm of Towell &amp; Co. and “ Vice and Acting Consul ” for America, calling on the same vessel two days later, he was given 11 guns. Yesterday the American man-of-war Isla de Luzon also arrived and gave Mr, Mackirdy 7 guns, the Friant being at the time in harbour, a cable’s length away. As to myself, since I found two years ago that my salute as a Political Agent was a subject of embarrassment to my colleagues, I have never called on any Foreign man-of-war officially, but have exchanged calls privately. This pay ing of official calls by Consuls on Foreign men-of-war was the custom in Maskat when I arrived here, but it seems to me to be quite an unnecessary proceeding, and so far as I know is not in vogue anywhere else. At the same time when Commanders of Foreign men-of-war want assistance from the British Consulate, as they not infrequently do in one form or another, it may occur that they come on shore officially without warning, and then His Majesty’s representative has no alternative but to return the call in like manner. 4. It will he realised from what has already been reported that the salutes given by the ships of civilized Powers to Consuls at Maskat are at present inconsistent, not to say fanciful, and the reason of this is, no doubt, the 11-gun salute which the British representative at Maskat is entitled to from British men-of-war as a Political Agent of the Government of India. There seem to be two means of arriving at a satisfactory understanding :— (a) Either that the Political Agent at Maskat should be officially author ized to inform Foreign men-of-war that his salute is 7 guns when occasion arises, while still receiving 11 guns from British men-of- war according to the present Naval B-egulations, or not, as may be considered expedient. This should be conditional on the .Consuls of other Powers accepting a similar purely Consular salute from our ships.K28SE3B9BflH^HIHH * (b) Or that the French or American Governments should be officially asked to inform His Majesty’s Government what is the salute which they authorize for their Vice-Consuls and Consuls at Maskat, with a view to the British Admiralty issuing the necessary instruc- ticns to the Commander»in-Chief of the East Indian Squadron. It will be seen from Admiral Bosanquet’s Memorandum of 12th Octo ber, above referred to, that the Commanders of His Majesty’s ships have no power to depart from the scale laid down in the $aval Regulations, in the absence of special orders. With regard to the first alternative, I should mention that at present the British representative at Maskat wears the uniform of a Political Agent and flies the flag of the Government of India over his flagstaff and boat. The question of uniform seems unimportant, but if the first proposal is adopted it would be advisable for him to fly the British flag instead of the Indian pattern, 5. In a small harbour like Maskat guns fired in salutes are plainly heard and carefully counted by the public; consequently such incidents as that which have recently occurred, in any case from the subject of unpleasant gossip, and the mere fact of their occurring in the presence and to the amuse ment of a semi-civilized community, seems to be derogatory to the prestige of civilized Powers. It is at the* same time unpleasant for the British representative personally to feel that he is the unwilling cause of such a state of things. 1 shall feel grateful therefore if the Government of India on a further consideration of the circumstances can see their w r ay to move His Majesty’s Government to arrive at a precise understanding on the subject with the American and French Foreign Offices through the usual diplomatic channels. I can quite understand my colleagues not wishing to accept salutes inferior to what is accorded to me, and shall willingly accept any solution which carries with it the authority of the official sanction of the Governments concerned.

My de«r Hdll-2hcm r 3cn, Since receiving your si^ndl this morning about an ackn^^leci^ement from tiie Sultan of the salute which you were go^ci enough to fire in his honour on the occasion of his anniversary, I have been looking through the records of the Consulate to see whether a written acknowledgement is customary or not. So far as I have teen able to find out, it iu-s not be ^n usual. The whole os- salutes ition with regard to sjrsiiftws &amp; ceremonida here remains wa to great extent undefined, in spite of the efforts of many of my predecessors, notably sir Percy Cox, to get some rule of rccedure formally ap f rov$b ed &amp; laid down, however, if you will remember, when I told H.H. it the interview which we had with him on Thursday, that you were kindly 'Cing to fire a salute in his honour at noon, he expressed his thanks I &amp; these were communicated by me to you verbally then &amp; there. The I same evening on board the “bur—ui—Bahr** H.H. repeated an expression of satisfaction at the manner in which his day had been honoured, but without making specific reference to the salute. In the circumstances I have not asked H.H. for a let ter acknowledgement. If you think that in future one ought to bu sent, if you do think so, I am in- j clinea oo ^.gree with you), may I ask you to acquaint me with your viefs d I will refer them for orders to my superiors. Then on the nex occasion H.H. can be informed bef^r^h»*nd that a letter of thanks will k*' ©x; ected of him. I v*ni sur».i that he wil make no difficulty about sending it. But the resent Juncture, when there is a tiff on between k l^sit^dces net seem to me a good time for introducing a novel departure. Please do not think that I have failed to appreciate the uniform help that I have always received from you &amp; all other &amp; fficers of H.M.*3 Kavy during my stay here, or that I am ungrate ful for it. I only think it well to go slow in introducing nr»e*i+.r to an o r i er f- ** ^My Dear How take part i either by d concerned o whoever is the day aft courtesy sh&lt; its place.

If this is impossible a letter or signal must take its place. I certainly think this should be done in the case of the Sultan or H.M.Ships cannot take notice of such occasions. I daresay that this is perhaps the only occasion in which honours have been done on a similar occasion at Muscat as I understand H.H s Father did not celebrate his accession, and of course Returned Salutes, such as on first arrival, and salutes when Sultan visits ships etc, are in a different category. I hope it will be possible to get some satisfaction from sending oultan concerning^Soldiers into British Territory ( i.e Collier and Depot ) as I feel rather keenly on the matter. Very many thanks for your letter and I quite understand the last paragraph and need hardly assure you that the obligation is n . reciprocated.

H.H. has very severely reprimanded them &amp; to-day he apologised to me for their behaviour in a very ample fashion, lie also undertook that nothing of the sort should ever occur again either on any ship or at the coal depot. By the »Yay I think that I am right in saying that the coal depot is not British territory.

I am desired to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 547-S, dated the 8 th December 1920, enclosing copy of a letter from the Political Agent, Muscat, re garding the grant of a salute to the President, of the Council of Ministers or to the Council as a whole, after a visit to one of His Majesty’s ships. The Government of India observe that His Highness the Sultan does not appear to have been consulted or asked for his advice. As an independent Ruler His High ness can presumably in his own territory order salutes for his own subjects or officials, and indeed the correspond- enclosures to your letter No. 817 dated 17th } ence regarding the 19B 0 • 5 ..... salute for his Wazir shows that His Highness did take the initiative on that occasion. The proper procedure in the present case would therefore seem to be for the Sultan to grant a salute, and o.sk that the same number of guns nk*y be accorded by His Majesty’s naval and other vessels on formal and State occasions. As regards the number of guns, I am to pbint out that 17 gm is a very big salute and at the very most 15, which is the same number that the Political Resident% enjoys as a first Class Resident, would appear to suffice. There is no guarantee that the President of the Council will always be so high a personage as the Sultan^ brother or present fact which seems chiefly to have influenced you in recommending the large number of 17 guns.quaation o Minister*. snould COD) Sultan.

At the same time he would of course write to the Council ordering a certain salute to be given.

This question was deferred vide your telegram No.513-5, dated 11th april 1921, but I consider it is now time that these salutes should be put on to a permanent basis, and I herewith.put up my proposals which I venture to hdpe will be favourably considered by the Government of India.

The Political .igent, Muscat, has informed the Sultan of Muscat of these salutes and the latter has expressed nis pratitude to the Government of India agreeing to these, hut he makes the following suggestions namely that if the President of the Council is not a member of the ruling family he should only receive a salute of 9 guns while individual members should receive a salute of 7 {runs. Political Agent, Muscat, however, only recommends 5 guns in the latter case and I agree. This point was discussed with the Sultan when I was at Muscat recently and His Highness also agreed that 5 runs M would he sufficient. I attach herewith a copy of a letter with enclosures frora the Political Agent, Muscat, on this subject and I agree with his views. recommend the foilowing;- (1) that the provisional salute as whole and the salute of 13 guns member of the Ruling family should I accordingly berr to of 17 guns for the Council for the r»res i lent if a be made permanent.

(5) that the salute for individual members of the Council should be fixed at 5 guns. xxx x x xx Thus briefly the changes shown in the annexed schedule would be necessary in the table of salutes provided my suggestions are approved. In most of the oases, however, I would note that provisional sanction has already been given. MUSCA T.

British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, 6th March 1926. From ✓ V Captain B. Stuart Horner, I.A., Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The Political Agent, Muscat. Sir, I am directed to refer to your predecessor’s letter No. 155, dated the 5th February 1926, regarding the desire of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to confer the status of a Minister on Mr. Thomas. 2. The Hon'hie the Political Resident considers that there is not likely to he any difficulty as regards the name and status, hut before approaching the Government of India „ jj he wishes to he informed whether his views regarding the salutes given to the Ministers, collectively and individually,^ are correct. 3 . Cn the analogy that a British Consul does not fly his flag nor receive a salute when his superior officer is in the station he understands that it is only in the absence of the Sultan that collectively the Council-of Ministers, when calling on a Naval Conmander, receive a salute of 17 guns, that the President of the Council, alone or perhaps attended by one Minister, receives a salute of vxiVM&amp;^J*********** 13 or 9 guns, according as he is a member of the ruling family or not, and that other members, singly, receive a salute of 5 guns. He also presumes that if two members went together they would only receive the one salute of 5 guns. 42 4. It would therefore he necessary for His Highness to he away, and all the other memhers of the Council ill or absent, before any one member would pay an official visit representing the State, and the chances of Wazir Thomas calling officially alone are very remote. 5. If a practice has been established not in accordance with the above views, Colonel Prideaux enquires whether an understanding can be come to that only in the most exceptional cases will a Naval Commander receive an official visit — whic’r naturally entails a return visit — from the Council even collectively, while Kis Highness the Sultan is in residence at the Port.

To Th« Council of ; inistera of Hia hi^hneos the Sultan of Muscat &amp; Onen, i uscat• jlftcr compliments, I have the honour to enquire from Your Honours as to the practice followed hy you in calling on and receivint^ visits from the Coraraaridcrs of ships. It is i-&gt;resumed that just as a Hritisl Consul docs not fly his fla;; nor receive &amp; salute when his superior officer is in the station so it is only in the absence c of the Cult; n that collectively the Coun cil of inisters, when callm ; on v llcvrl Commander, receive a salute of 17 ti unc # that the ^ resident of the Council, alone or perhaps attended by one ITinistex, XK&amp;fci receives a salute of 13 or 9 (juns, accord- in*; as he is a member of the ruling family or not, ; nd that other members, singly, receive a salute of 5 guns. It is also presumed that if two members went together they would only receive the one salute of 5 guns. If this be the case it would be ne cessary for His Highness to be away, and all the other members of the Council ill or absent before any one member would payan official visit representing the rtatc # end th.e chances of ' f azir Thonas Ce lling officially are very remote. I shall be tflad if I may be informed if the presumptions made above correctly describes the practice followed in the 3tate and if not what the local practice may be.
