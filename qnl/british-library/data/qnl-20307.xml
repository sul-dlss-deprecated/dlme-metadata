This tribe ia as stated in the jmbasFy»e note, an Iraqi tribe, and it crossee into rvowelt .or a limited number of days for ^rasing* purposes. if the allegation about aggression by policemen upon it was trae, 'lie tribe »houlc # ae expected, have reported the matter to the essrt elice ftation. The tribe, however, did not do so. 2. The Cuetoms Police motor car© at Safwan did not leave their headquarters for touring: on 28th September, 1940, Similarly, the remaining sections of the Customs and Excise Police armed cars did not proceed beyond the limits of their district in the course of the purauit and chasing of smugglers. If the claim of Mttnsi&amp;.r- ? &gt;in Jiffran were true, he should heve reported to the Custom© Police at Safwan or other Iraqi quarters stating: the nature of the trespass on him for legal proceedings to be t^ken against the trespassers. He, however, did not do so. Information available with the Iraqi authorities excludes the possibility of this individual or his companions having been subject of any such assault. 3. The record* of the Customs and Excise Police show that an the 13th October, 1940, the Sefwan Police motor oars went out touring within Iraqi territory, and that on reaching A1 Kajmi lands the c®rs seized a caravan, with 5 donkeys^ carrying 0 simigglsd goods consisting of tobacco and su^ar, but they did not in any way trespass on the frontiers of Koweit. In this connection, the ^nistry wish to point out that whenever the Iraqi authorities intensified their pursuit of smugglers in the Southern 'Desert, the latter would start fabricating lies and reporting fictitious and baseless incidents with the object of occupying the authorities concerned with fruitless correspondence and of shaking the morale of those engaged in their pursuit. It is noteworthy that the present complaints are not the first of their kind to be made. ^ny similar complaints were in the past which upon investigation were recovered to be groundless. A Particularly noteworthy point sbout the present complaint is the fabrication therein^ of a non-existent name. i.he ikinistry avail themselves of the opportunity to express their highest consideration and esteem.53/57 and 53/83 Te legrara S • From Political Agent, Kuwait.

POLITICAL AGENCY, KUWAIT. Dated the IStii July, 1941, Reference to previous correspondence; DESCRIPTION OF ENCLOSURE. Name and Date. Demi-official letter No. C/388 of the 12th July, 1941, to Lieut-Commander W.B.E. Weld- forester, EN, H .M 's Consul, Basra^ Subject. Iraqi incursions into Kuwait territory. W y *//fL l v..y D.O. No, 0/388 Political Agency, Kuwait, 12th July, 1941. My dear Weld-Forester, I wonder if you could do something for me requiring a little tact. His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait reported to me on 2nd July last that on the 28th June an Iraqi G-overnraent armed car was seen scouting on the high ground ahoTe BOEEAT KURAIM immediately Borth 'by east of the Kuwait Sasra road where it crosses the Liyah ridge - that is to say some 35 to 40 miles inside Kuwait territory and south of Safwan. 2. According to the Shaikh the report was 'brought in by Kuwait Zubair Transport car driver, who said that the armed car contained 5 men one of whom a certain Tbn La * ahim he identified. This person forms part of the Iraq. Badawin guard post at Safwan, and in the past has 'been more guilty than any one else of trespassing into Kuwait territory. 3. As I have not 'been ahle to get other evidence in support of the driver's story and as the driver fears to say too much I have not represented the matter officially, hut I cannot help thinking that the Iraqi car was in fact where it was reported. 4. As we do not want a recurrence of the old trouble of Iraqi Police cars invading Kuwait territory in so called search of smugglers, a thing which the Shaikh is terribly touchy ahout, do you think you could pass a hint to the Basra Mutassarif, to give stringent orders to hoth Customs and/ Lieut-Commander 'T.B.E. ¥eld-Forester, HN., His Majesty's Consul, Basra.and Desert Policemen at Safwan to 'be most oareful not to conduct their operations south of an east and west line running approximately one mile south of Safwan post - this will insure that no incidents occur. Thanking you in anticipation, and with 'best wishes, Yours sincerely, Sd. H.H .P. Dickson. £ J|, Your hint to the Mutassarif might sink in deeper perhans if you mentioned that Kuwait armed vannettes from jahra nowadays patrol the Basra road as far as the Kodhataii (15 miles south of Safwan) and there would at once 'be a scrap if they met the Iraqi car operating inside Kuwait territory.Qonfidential , Political Agency, j Kuwait, No. 0/682• 17tii DecemlDer, 1941. 11 fe [ I From To Major T. Hickiribothain, Political Agent, Kuwait. The Hon^le the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Subject:- Kuwait - Iraqt Transit Trade. /c/, v O A /v- 2- Sir, « * « ^ ' 'I I have the honour to refer to your predecessor's Printed Letter No. 653-S of August 21st 1935, and to forward extracts from a letter which I received from the Shaikh of Kuwait on the 26th of September, 1941. 2. It is suggested that in order to reduce the possi'bility of exports from Irag re-entering that country illegally the Iraq. Customs and the Kuwait Gustoms should issue manifests for all goods exported from their respective countries to the other and that copies of these manifests should 'be sent to me. I will forward copies of Kuwait manifests to the Iraq, Customs officials so that they can satisfy themselves that the goods exported from Kuwait have in fact arrived; as in the case of Saudi Arabian exports from Kuwait great care will 'be exercised to ensure that no goods leave Kuwait for Iraq, without a manifest. I will pass on Iraq. Customs manifests to the Kuwait authorities who will verify the arrival of the goods here after which the manifests could 'be returned to the Iraq. Customs authorities. Just as they should return Kuwait manifests after verification through me to the Kuwait Customs authorities. In my opinion the adoption of such a scheme as I have outlined ahove would make it wellnigh impossible for goods exported from Iraq, to Kuwait/-2- Kuwait to find their way 'back into Iraq, 'by iin3rawfuL channels. to 'be adequate measures to discourage smuggling into Iraq, for I have had no written report of any incident taking place nor have I 'been asked to endeavour to trace any seized smuggled goods since my arrival here in August txhis year and the reopening of the transit trade would he an added incentive to him to cooperate with the Iraqi Government in the suppression of a traffic which would 'be profitless to him and his people and detrimental to the goodirelations existing 'between the two countries. 4. I trust that you will consider favourably the sugges tions now put forward and that the Iraq. G-ovemment may he asked ^ 1 ^ $ to agree to cancel the Regulation dated July 11,1935, under Articles 48, §8 and 119 of the Customs Code which was published in the Iraq. Government Gazette on the 23rd July, 1935, and to permit once more transit trade 'between the two countries. 3 The Shaikh of Kuwait is already taking what appear I have the honour to 'be, Sir, Your most obedient servant Major Political Agent, Kuwait P'/. d - J**V Extracts from letter No. il-6/1563, dated the 26th September, 1941, from His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait, to the Political Agent, Kuwait, Reference our conversation this week on the subject of smuggling into Iraq., I wish to explain to Your Excellenc; that I have always tried to maintain cordial and friendly relations between my country and Iraq our neighbour and have never at any time encouraged smuggling 'but rather endeavoured to prevent it. However, as Your Excellency well knows matters have been exaggerated 'by elements unfavourable to us in Iraq, who have always worked against our interests 'both in regard to general economic problems concerning both countries and our private interests in Iraq.. We are endeavouring by every means to suppress smuggling between the two countries and Iraq, should reciprocate with us and restore the trade relation exist ing prior to 1935. In our opinion the reopening of transit trade will affect advantageously the interests of both countries. To check smuggling we will tak:e all possible steps to ensure that no commodities are exported to Iraq, other than under cover of manifests issued by our Customs Department. The Iraq. Customs authorities should give similar instructions. Copies of all manifests issued by both countries will be forwarded to Your Excellency so that you may be able to let those interested know that the commodities have arrived and the date of their arrival. This procedure should discourage smuggling. In conclusion I request Your Excellency to put forward my proposals and to use every endeavour to reach agreement with those concerned for the benefit of all.QOHglPSNTXAL * 5i/sy H0.229-S of i942# ■ I — Brltieh Residency &amp; Oonsulate-GeneraX, Bu8hlr3 9 14th February 1942* From The Hon'bXe lieu tenant •Colonel W«R#Kay, a«I«S» 9 Political Heeident in the lersian Gulf.

Therefore, there is still pressing need to continue the arrangements confirmed by Regulation No. 30 of 1935. But as the present war condition may in some cases require the carrying out of exceptional formalities in respect of goods destined for Koweit, necessary arrangements have been made to meet this purpose by Regulation No, 1+6 of 19U2, which has lately been issued,under which the Minister of Finance has been given authority to give permission, in special circumstances and during the present war, for the exportation and transport of goods to Koweit via Iraq. The Ministry avail themselves of the opportunity to ecpress their highest consideration and esteem.

Iraq. Intention of firm who were refused Iraq import licenses is undoubtedly to smuggle cars etc. out of Kuwait and sell at inflated prices to non-approved purchasers. Goods imported overland do*not require import license and it would thus not be possible to take action here if this were done. 2. I realise Kuwait has first claim on these goods but if legislation permits of requisitioning I hope authorities (group ommitted) ? them and agree to resale to certain members of the diplomatic and consular staffs here who are in urgent need of cars for the performance of their official duties. Ends. 2. I conveyed the Ambassador's request to the Shaikh who has requisitioned the cars and tyres. He considers it desirable to retain two of the cars and all the tyres as a State reserve but is willing to place the other tjiree cars at the disposal of the .-oabassador. The cars will cost about Iis#5000 each. Do you see any objection? I consider it highly desirable that the tyres should be retained here under the Kuwait Government's control.

DESCRIPTION OF ENCLOSURE. Name and Date. Subject. Office note dated 12th Sept, ^USHi ' c PE^IOFNCY no ;; Date. 1942^ Transit trade between Iraq and Kuwait,N 0 T E. / Reference the British Embassy Baghdad^s reference No, 448/19/42 date^ Septeraber 1st, 1942, The Iraq Govermnent 1 s action in ammending Regulation No, 30 of 1935 has little practical value as regards transit trade though I suppose in theory it should be construed as a friendly act. 2, Tt is understandable that the Iraq O-overnment should insist on retaining close control over exnorts fror their country either of horne grown nroduce or of goods imported for consumption in Iraq and that they should consider the matter sufficiently important to insist on the specific sanction of the Minister of Finance being necessary in each case^but T do not see the necessity for such specific sanction in the case of goods in transit to Kuwait through Iraq territory or via an Irac nort. I am assuming that 'transportation of goods ? I to Kuwait' in Art. 2 of Regulation No,46 of 1942 may be read f r ^ J to transit trade, 3, The time which will be lost in obtaining the specific sanction of the Minister renders it scarcely practicable for merchants to place orders with Palestine or Syria or for ship ment of goods from overseas to Basra in transit to Kuwait. We have already had experience of the time involved in obtaining an export permit when it took from '^'une 27th to July 21st of this 3rear to obtain permission for His Highness the Ruler to export from his own estates at Fao and elsewhere his own palm branches with the power of E.B.M's Embassy at Baghdad working on our behalf, a potent force which could, not be invoiced in each individual case of a transit permit, Vore than three weeks elapsed with every means of pressure brought to bear. How long would a merchant have to wait for a permit unaided and alone? 4, I do not consider that any useful purpose can be served hy reopening the question with the Iraq Government.

Sir, JAiave the honour to refer to your printed letter ? To, 0 /135 dated March 19th, 1942 and to inform you that on the 16th of October when I was driving to TJmm Qasr accompan ied by my driver, a bedouin guide&gt;and a bedouin retainer oi His Highness the lhaikh I had an interesting encounter with an Iraqi police patrol car. 2, At a point twenty two miles south of Umm Qasr Fort I sighted a motor car about a mile away to the north and travelling due east. I was informed by one oi my companions that the car was an Trani police car searching for smugglers. I could scarcely credit that Iraqi officials would so flag rantly disregard international conventions so I determined to drive over to the car and identify it oeyond all possible doubt, if indeed it was an Iraqi Government vehicle. As I turned to carry out my intention the car turned as well and made off at high speed. My suspicions roused I followed and a after a six mile chase it became apparent ohat we were gaining rabidly. Apparently the Traois thought the same ior the car suddenly slowed down turned right round to face us and halted. The Lewis gun on the roof of the car was manned and two armed men jumped out of the Tt piclc up rt % as that particular make of car is designated,and loaded their rifles. We were now between fifteen and sixteen miles inside Kuwait territory. I drove up to the Iraqi car and asked the individual in charge, who stated his name was Khalil, what he was doing and he replied that he was searching for smugglers. I asked if he was aware that/that he was in Kuwait territory and he replied quite uncon- was oernedly that he did whereupon one of the uniformed bedouin wearing a Xance corporal/s stripe caiiie up and stated that it did not matter as Kuwait and Iraq were now ail one, I pointed out his error; any way in bs far as incursions by armed Iraq GrOvermEent lorries were oonoerned* I noted that the number of the car was n t ** ari ^ have since been told that it came from the Hafaia post and not from Safwan # I left the Iraqi car halted and drove straight to Urom Qasr which by my speed ometer reading was sixteen miles from the spot and nearly due north,, 3, I request that action be taken to prevent any further incursions of this nature for not only are they discourteous but they create an unfortunate impression on the bedouin mind. The bedouin guide with me replied / on my expressing astonish ment that the car should have come so far south^ '•the Iraqis are brave people they know we cannot stop them and of course they don't fear the British or else they would not make a practice of coming into our territory as every one knows they do'. The militant attitude adopted by the Iraqis on being overtaken was probably due to their tiiinicing mjr car belonged to His Highness and contained a party of his bedouin and they were uncertain of their reception.

(omission) if any to c.i.f. cost you consider reasonable per car in respect of landing charges, storage etc. Price payable to Ades will be on basis laid down in paragraph 2 of my telegram 44 to Political Resident (i.e. c.i.f. price plus charges plus 10^.) 3, I could make payment for all five cars in Baghdad if this were more convenient to His Highness and to Political Resident. 4, I should be grateful for early reply. - CHARGE D'AFFAIRES -Tele^rp.m s. ^om Political Besident, Bushire.

In August Baghdad Embassy telegraphed Political xigent Kuwait asking him to impound five cars exported from India to Kuwait for Ades Limited Iraq and said that intention of firm was undoubtedly to smuggle cars out of Kuwait and sell them to non- approved purchasers. While realising that Kuwait had first claim on them Embassy asked that they might be requisitioned and re-sold to '•certain members of the diplomatic and consular staffs here who are in urgent need of cars for the performance of their official duties' 1 . 3. Hay replied that 2 cars could be made available and in the meantime Rogers who had been endeavouring unsuccessfully to obtain a car from India for the last 14 months and Howes and Hickinbotham whose cars were falling to pieces also applied for a car each. Hay decided in favour of Rogers and Howes and he asked them to give an undertaking that the cars would be available for their successors in the event of their leaving the Gulf. To this both readily agreed. As it was essential that the Shaikh should not go empty handed one car was kept for him. 4. The Ambassador then wired asking for a third car saying that he did not wish to appear greedy but that we were nearer a source of supply in India than he v/as and that we had the ear of the Government of India. Hay thereupon wired the Government / ofof India in his telegraia Fo.i859 of 21st September 1942 stating that Howes and Rogers 'both required cars to enable them to carry out their duties properly and enquiring whether it was possible to purchase new cars through the Government of.India. 5. The Government of India replied in their telegram ITo• 763 S of 24th September that they regretted it was impossible but that they would permit the export-of cars purchased by officers in direct negotiation with dealers* This they had of course been anable to do although they had been endeavouring to do so for a long time. 6. Thompson then wired on the 4th October stating that the Foreign Office had now authorised the purchase of a third car 'for official use here* and hoped that we could do without it. I replied on the 9th October stating that as the Government of India had been unable to help and as both my Secretary and Vice Consul had been attempting in vain to obtain cars for the past year I hoped that he would not press me beyond the two units already agreed upon and I finally allotted the two cars to Howes and Rogers. that 7. On the 28th October Thompson stated/in view of what I said he did not wish to press the matter further but in a later telegram he again hoped that we could let him have the third car mentioning for the first time that two cars were purchasable from Government funds and one for H«M«Gonsul General at Basra. I replied that there appeared to be some misunderstanding as at no time had more than two cars been earmarked by my predecessor for Baghdad and that in view of the fact that my Secretary and Vice Consul had been unable to secure cars from India I had decided in their favour in place of the Political Agent. There the matter rested. 8. It is now almost impossible to hire cars in Persia and new ones are unobtainable while on the other hand v/e now have / orders-3- orders to tour frequently, and I am therefore faced with the dilemma of having to order officers to tour while at the same time no cars are available for them. Moreover, as you are aware, our two office® are seven miles apart. I find it difficult to believe that the Baghdad Embassy with all the pov/er and influence of His Majesty's Government behind them are unable to secure cars for the public service and it will be remembered that their original request was for cars for •cettain members of the diplomatic and consular staffs here«. I cannot feel that these officers have any better claim than Howes or Rogers for whom the provision of cars is equally a necessity in the public interest and for v/hom the cars in question have actually been cleared through the customs at Bushire and taken into use• The only person who might have a legitimate grievance is possibly the Shaikh of Kuwait. - Britconsul. i.L.53/83 Telegram G.T.C.

The incident brought to notice in Colonel Hay's despatch 0/180 01 March 18th last was Judged by the Ambassador to be too unimportant to warrant, in itself, formal representations, especially as the story of the Koweiti fisherman seemed somewhat inconclusive and no date was given of the alleged Iraqi trespass in Koweiti waters. His Excellency accordingly decided to wait and see whether other similar incidents occurred which could be connected with this affair and which, in the aggregate, would warrant a protest to the Iraqi Government, ^ But no further incidents took place and in consegience the matter has never been taken up with the authorities here, 3. It is now nearly a year since the Ruler of Koweit complained to the Political Agent and it would clearly be impossible for efiective enquiries to be made after such a long lapse of time# U.

'nhev had .heir names registered at the Koweiti Police post situate in Bab al parwaza and they entered the town within the view of tne Koweiti authorities and rented a house there. Nevertheless, the escaped convict was not arrested. The kinistry strongly regret the contravention committed by these police officers in crossing the frontiers of the Principality of Koweit in the manner stated above, and the appropriate authorities have drawn the attention of these officers to the matter and advised them against the future repetition of such acts of (frontier) violation. On the other nana, the Ministry had hoped that the Koweit authorities would give the necessary assistance for steps to be taken against the escaped convict, on the same lines on which the Iraqi authorities nave been acting in cooperating and collaborating with the Koweit j authorities. The Irasti authorities have lately learnt that the convict in question has since escaped from Koweit into Arab Sa'udi territory. The kinistry will be glad if the esteemed iimbassy will be so good as to approach the appropriate authorities in Koweit with a view to ascertttining whether the report of the escupe of this convict is true, ana inform the kinistry of the result.

Telegram S(A) From Political Agent, Kuwait. To Political Resident, Bushire, No. 447 Dated 3rd and received 4th June 1944. IMPORTANT You may reco lect that when you were here I mentioned to you proposal of 40th Indian Infantry Brigade to station here small patrol of two troops with motor transport who would search vehicles and camels from Iraq in Kuwait territory with a view to checking the suspicion that such vehicles and camels occasionally carry articles stolen from British Military in Iraq. I rejected the proposal in writing' without mentioning it to Shaikh, stating at the same time that the proper place to check such a suspicion was in Iraq. 2. Colonel HINHBLIF^E, Commander of 40th Indian Infantry Brigade visited me recently and on June 1st, brought up this proposal again stating that idea uas that British patrol would transport one or two Koweit 'Police men' and that latter would actually do searching at request of former while any stolen goods discovered would be handed over to Koweit authorities and case reported through me to them for action against 'accused'. (BINGBLIFFE continued as follows to the end of this paragraph). Presence of British trooos necessary to check work of state 'policemen' while mobile natrol essential to check whether stolen goods are brought' from Iraq to sea coast or coast villages outside Koweit town. It is impossible to exercise Effective check? in Iraa because of the length of frontier between it and Koweit 'and ease of crossing it at any point. General .lead- quarters P.A.I.G. are very keen on this proposal and should I not be able to put it through they will possibly take it up with the Political Resident. 3, I discussed proposal at length with Shaikh who stated that no goods stolen from British military found their way here and certainly none wen^ to sea coast outb -i .de tovvn. Standing orders exist for search at town gates of all cars coming from Iraa and orders will now issue for their stricter enforcement and a procla4mation be made prescribing heav/^ penalties for any dealing with goods in question. Road checKS will also be made occasionally by Koweit patrols. Carrying out'of Brigade's proposal would create very considerable xeel- ing against us in Koweit. ^ j accept Shaikh's statements with reservation which do not affect my conclusion that very proolematical^advantage from Brigade's proposal does not repeat not outweign certain damage its execution would do to our relations with Koweit implying: as it would in the first place that we have no trast in Ruler If you agree I shall inform Brigade tna^ I regret l'cannot'arree' to nress the proposal giving: at the same time appropriately presented reasons for not doing so. r i For vour information I add my suspicions tnat tnis nrooosal partly inspired by Iraqi Government and that an effort would be made to use British jiilitary v if posted here) lo'check not only stolen goods of British Military origin but also goods innocently acquired by Kuwaities in Iraq an smuggled here with connivance ox Iraqi Oj.iiCj.ais.

As you are aware, the vehicles have in the great maiorltv of cases been taicen out by Zubair inhabitants (mostly of Saudi nationality) or by Kuwait nationals. The latter are specially organised into a contraband gang which used to be run bv a certain notorious smuggler HUSAIN BM'MADl AL HEDJAZI who was caught cuu later escaped from Basrah Jail, His chief Assistant is one called MUS'AD 3ALEH who enticed a great number of Iraoi vehicles 'Do -,ecca and lauer boughu ohem in Kuwait.

I considei that he should be trailed and his activities looked into Bashd ® d is SAL® ABID, spare parts seller below RASAjA Louel (near Lhe Semiramis Hotel), and in Basrah ABDULL4 aL ^SHU/AI3H, spare parts seller, Seimar Stree, IBRAHIM TAYARAH driver, QHlTLiVI' ABBAS, driver, who smuggled out some cars for him. I gi T v e below a list 01 the chief smugglers of cars during the past pilgrimage season with the number of cars taken out by them:- 1. HUSAIN, ABDUL 'ADIR AND AZOOZ sons of *UBAID from Zubair, smuggled several cars, of which-they sold some to SULAIIvIAN . AL MARSHUD at Kuwait. 4 2. AHMAD and ABDUL LATI?, sons of RABI f AH from Zubair, Saudi nationals, smuggled eight cars, Ahmad is now in Kuwait waiting to collect the balance of 'uhe value of the cars he sold in Kuwait. I know of 2 lorries at least which he has unofficially bought in Baghdad and smuggled out: B.D. 3454 and 3147 which figured in Major CORNET'S report, 3. IBRAHIM AL NASIR and his partner ABDULLAH AL MUNI? from Zubair, smuggled 8 cars. 4, ABBAS MAHMUD - from Ashar, Basrah, took out 6 cars. 5, NASIR AL JAREED, Juss seller in Basrah, took out 12 cars, 6, FARHAN, 'from Zubair, several cars, some of which returned and some are still with his son in Kuwait, 7, SAYID KADHIM AL HAKIM, smuggled 3 lorries 2 of which returned and were fined by Customs, the third lorry is in Kuwait, He admitted this to 'me. 8. SAYID AMEN SAYID MUHD. ALI of Kadhimain, smuggled 4 vehicles to Kuwait. 9. ABDULLA AL OHUBAISHI from Zubair smuggled 4 cars. 10. ISSA BIN TAHA and IBRAHIM AL MALLAK, spare parts sellers at Seimar at Basrah, smuggled 6 cars to Kuwait to Sulaiman .A1-Marshood. 11. MUSA 1 1D SALEH from Kuwait. The exact number is not known - probably 30 cars. He still has 12 of them in Kuwait, 12. MUHAMMAD ZUBAR, Saudi national living in Basrah - he smuggled an unknown number of vehicles: member of Husain Hamadi's gang,13. HUSAIN SABHI, from Basrah, smuggled cars to Kuwait, 14. MUHiilVHiAD I'uOANT, Saudi national llvln^ in TCnwa^t «. f—7 C3 A a . VA v v CI. J^. O « smuggled 3 cars. ' 15# MIRZA HASAN AJT.II, from Kuwait, smuggled, several cars - a notorious smuggler. 16. HASAN -SAFFAR, from Kadhimain, smuggled several cars with pilgrims. From the reported activities of some of the above, it seems that they are already preparing for another large scale smuggling and it is urgent that any of them found in any town in Iraq' should he carefully watched to ascertain the nature of his business. They do not confine their search to the southern areas, but look for cars specially in Najaf, which is over abundant with vehicles, and Kadhimain. As you are aware, the Basrah Police cannot be relied upon, as events have proved Lheir co-operation with the smugglers, and their too free certificates in 'Dhe case of the vehicles which have returned. Perhaps with the few cases which we now propose, to submit to the Courts concerning the vehicles identified in Kuwait, the vehicle owners will hesitate before selling them to the smugglers if a severe sentence is passed, on them, but it is nevertheless essential to discourage the smugglers from coming into contact with the prospective sellers. It is also most important that the Kuwait market for smuggled cars is controlled; as you have seen from Major Corner's report, even the Kuwait ruling family does not hesitate to buy smuggled vehicles. Last year*3 temptation has been so great specially when Iranian pilgrims arrived at Basrah and Kuwait ready to pay over I.D.SOO/- per passenger, that the question should be studied from all its aspects and measures taken.

REFERENCE: - Baghdad despatch to ^'inisber of State No.52 of 17th July, 1944 . ' — It is considered here of some importance to secure 'Dhe co -operation of all neighbouring countries to prevent, at all times v , the uncontrolled movement of motor transport from one Middle East territory to another,' and at the last Meeting of the Road Transport •Sub -Committee I was asKed by the Chairman to take up this matter with you. (See minutes 178, 139 (b) and 192 (a) of the 24th and 25th Meeting of the Road Transport Sub-Committee). At present no formal agreement whatsoever in this connection exists between Iraq and Persia, Kuwait or Saudi Arabia but as regards Palestine, Syria and Trans-Jordan, a 'gentleman's agreement tT has been reached whereby truant vehicles are returned to the country in which they are registered. Although this agreement is based on a purely personal arrangement between Lt,Col,A ,p, Le Blanc, Director General of Transport, Iran, Maj, Hegerty, (Road Transport Controller of Palestine), Lt,Gol, A ,Cr, Griffin, (M.E.S.C. Transport Officer, Levant States) and Maj, E, Lawrence (Transport Controller, Transjordania), whereby it has already resulted in the recovery of two Iraqi vehicles in the past four months. .One Palestinian vehicle has also been traced in Iraq and is being returned. The escape of vehicles to Kuwait presents a serious problem to Irao, particularly as no extradition procedure exists between the two territories. In addition to the 53 vehicles which, as stated in the report mentioned in minute 189(b), have been irre vocably lost, .a further vehicle escaped from Iraq in May last. The vehicle and driver were allowed to leave the town of Kuwait unescorted, with the result that neither has been seen since. According to the Directorate General of Road Pransporu, the smuggling would appear to be effected by a well organised band in Kuwait, The Question of securing the co-operation or the Government of Saudi Arabia to prevent the unconcrolled use ox motor transport during the next pilgrimage, has already been ^ raised with the Minister Resident in the^Middle East, Cairo, in Baghdad despatch under reference but it is the wider aspect of permanent control to which reference is no T mao-e, j should be grateful for your views regarding the possibility of enforcing inter -territorial control of motor transport on an official basis. !opies for British Legation, Jeddah.

O /llUfS -a /i of 18th Au^oiat this morning, The Shaikh ia not, of course, concerned with Iraqi vehicles that escape to yaudi Ambia, but the position vis a vis Iraq is not so siiaple. 2. Xf the Iraqis do not make any serious attempt to enforce their regulations effectively then X agree that it is difficult to persuade His Highness to take action, but if they do - and there is every sign that the position is being tightened up throughout the Middle Kast - then Kuwait will have to come into line, for though its position as an entrepot is admitted it cannot allow itself to degenerate into becoming a fence. Apart from the ethical position, both Xraq and the Middle l^ast Supply Centre have plenty of means of retaliation and will not hesitate to use them. 5. Colonel -ije Blanc should therefore be permitted to visit Kuwait and given every reasonable facility in assisting the Xraq Government to enforce their regulations. Kuwait placed themselves in an impregnable position by offering to return all iraqi vehicles at their purchase price after the last pilgrimage and Iraq cut the ground from under their own feet by rejecting the offer but some more positive action will now be required. Xt was, for example, most unfortunate that b vehicle which had recently been located by the Iraqis was allowed to leave without escort and it was only natural that it should have t^-ken the opportunity to vanish. / 4. /4, Until Kuwait can free itself fro;a the Iraqi Trade nexus it behoves her to walk carefully, more especially when - as in this case - Iraq's interests coincide with the expressed policy of His Majesty's Government.

It appears that on the night of the 12th September an Iraqi police car broke down near Matla 1 and could not be got back to Safwan. It was seen by Kuwait lorry drivers and others who passed on the 15th. On the night of the 13th it was repaired by a relief car sent down for the purpose. 4. Now that the Kuwait Rationing Committee take over the entire quota of tea and cotton piece-goods there should be very little leakage from Kuwait town itself; but the smuggling of goods from Saudi Arabia will no doubt go on. -V/ .. IC.^ ' • • j! a o. • * • * CO k F ua K lu, - Political Agent, Kuwait *(xi)/ A NOTE ON IRAQI POLICE INCURS Timg IN KUWAIT TERRITORY. I Recent enquiries into the incursions of Iraqi police to Matla 1 have revealed the following points:~ (i) The Customs Posts especially told off to watch Kuwait are those located at Safwan, Rafafiya (also ?? 1 ^ ed / Rafitiya, 2D miles west of Shaiba) and Khadhar •A1 Ma (west of the A1 Batin). (ii) The staff at Safwan are provided with light trucks of different types, whilst patrols from Khadhar Al Ma and Rafafiya are mounted on camels. (ili) The staff of all three posts work in close co—operation to extract ^largess from smugglers taking goods into Iraq., and in return give free passage and advice as to the safest routes and markets. They share the proceeds and allow only a small proportion of captured contraband to reach their superiors. (iv) Small hauls go to individuals who seize them; but larger hauls are shared by the staffs of all three posts. The ramp is well organized. (v) Contraband cargoes are rarely seized because the method of levying blackmail in cash on the smugglers and allowing them to pass into Iraq is easier and more profitable for the police, and involves less risk. (vi) Contraband cargoes are generally small, and consist of goods carried on three or four camels at the most. (vii) The normal method adopted by the Iraqi Police is to maintain paid spies in Jahara, and to vary the procedure by sending policemen into Jahara disguised as bedouin. Both mix with the crowd sitting in the coffee shops and gather information. (viii) About once a week police cars leave Safwan after dark in time to reach the vicinity of Jahara at about 8 p.m. in winter and later in summer. The cars are usually stopped at the top of the Matla 1 pass overlooking Jahara, and the police hide them inside nullahs. Certain of the police then change into bedouin clothes and make thej.r way down into the village. There they make themselves known to smugglers whom they know as such and take 50^4 of the value of the goods to be smuggled from them in cash, and give them free passage. They also try to discover the routes to be taken by smugglers who try to operate in spite of them. If possible, these latter are then intercepted and told to pay 50% of the value of the cargo in cash or surrender their camel loads. If they pay up, they are allowed to pass; if they refuse, their cargoes are confiscated and taken to Safwan in the police trucks. Almost invariably money is paid and the police return to Safwan by dawn and report that no smugglers were intercepted. (ix) Similar methods are used by the camel patrols wording from Khadhar Al Ma. (x) The most profitable cargoes at present are cotton, piece-goods, and tea. By far the largest quantities of cotton piece-goods come from Saudi Arabia.A NOTE ON Tffi i; ACTIVI TIES OF SHAIKH SUBAH AL NASIR AL SURAH. ~ ' v v, ? ha f^ h ^ubah Al Nasir, grandson of Shaikh Mubarak Al Subah, is the bedouin member and the bandit of the A1 Subah In 1927 he shot his brother in excep-oionally unpleasant circumstances. , The murder was committed in a car as both brothers were being driven to see the Ruler in respect of a difference of opinion between them. Subah Al Nasir alleged that had he not drawn his revolver first his brother would have shot him; but this version of the incident is not generallv believed. o j 2. ^ ^ After shooting him, Subah Al Nasir threw' his brother out of his car and drove over the body several times. He then fled to the north-west corner of Kuwait and took refuge with the Beni Hussain section of the Dhafir, an Iraqi bedouin tribe where he made ^dakhala 1 . The Beni Hussain-have been his friends ever since, and are closely associated with him in smuggling transactions to and from Iraq. Shaikh Ahmed only got the Dhafir to hand over the fratricide after promising not to harm him. Shaikh Abdullah Al Jabir conducted the negotiations and brought Subah back to Kuwait, where he was confined to his house a close prisoner for six months. 3. To this day his mother has refused to have anything to do with him; and the rest of the Al Subah have as little to do with him as possible. On release Subah Al Nasir took to the desert. He only comes into Kuwait in the height of summer or during Ramadhan. He is never short of funds, and maintains himself regardless of expense and, to his friends, he is generous. He keeps large flocks of sheep usually in the Araifjan (near Ras Al Q,aliyah) and the Neutral Zone seaboard areas, and maintains some 800 camels. He is married to the second sister of Abdullah Al Salim. His wife is also a sister of Bebe, the senior and official wife of the Ruler. 4. After the collapse of the Ikhwan rebellion in the winter of 1930, Subah Al Nasir took upon himself the right to reserve a large area of land for grazing. This was in addition to his permanent reserve which had been given to him by the Ruler. The area appropriated extends from Umm Al Himan, just . south of Shiaibah on the coast, to the borders of the Neutral Zone. The area is some thirty miles by ten miles and is bordered on the land side by the Al Dhahar ridge and contains the Araifjan wells. 5. Subah Al Nasir T s usual migration is to go out in October with his camels to the Dibdibah and Al Batin areas in the western part of the State, and to camp in the vicinity of Umm Amarat Mahzul. He sends his sheep down to the Neutral Zone seaboard where there is water. About February he moves to the Araifjan area with his camels and summers there. 6. During his sojourn in the Dibdibah area Subah collects round him a number of Dhafir (Beni Hussain) tribesmen, and later on some of the Zubair shepherd tribes, usually the Zoba, Al Barghut and Rafi T iyat tribes, old friendsof his. These^ he uses to smuggle anything offering profit into Iraq; and in return they bring him rice and dates. None of his dependents, nor the tribes camped with him, have been short of rice since 1941. 7. ?/hen Subah moves south to Araif jan, the Iraqi shepherds accompany him; and by giving them^favoured treatmen and allowing them to graze their sheep in his reserves he Keeps them by him and affords them his protection. In return he takes 'Maniha* and ^habiha* from them, a perogative ox the Shaikh and an old custom by which foreigners buy projection and/COWFIDHHTIAT, GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, ___—_— D kpartment, EXPRESS LETTER [N* T&gt; % —This is an ORIGINAL MESSAGE, sent by post to save tdegrapJiic expense and undue use of the wires, but intended to he treated, on receipt, with the same expedbtion as if it had been telegraphed.

After staying ^-here Tor two nights, the Assistant Commandant of Police took the arnif d vehicle and roamed in the desert aiaon^bt the Iraqi post^ to resume the search for the smugglers. While carrying oat this auty, the Iraqi police encountered on 27th October, 1 jl + j , u civilian vehiclu coming from Koweit via buiairnan roua, which is an irregular roau lor travelling between Iraq ana jcvu*«cit anu is often known as a roaa used by amu toiJ lerB. 2. It appeared to the Iraqi patrol Police that the above- mentioned vehicle increased its speed and took the direction of Zubair. ^he patrol pjlice, 'hereupon, pursued it in compliance with their duties. Having done so from H A1 ^arka' lauds to 'Al A thai, w i.e. a distance of about 1 !30 kilometres, ^.ave it seV'ral signals to halt, but, notwithstanding this, the vehicle did not halt. Thereupon, +he policemen in charge of-2- the vehicle opened fire as a warning for the motor vehicle to • ' i ' actually halted after Shaikh Muhammad al Sebah had en wounded and his servant receiving a mortal shot, ^hen only Oi: - I k patrol police come to know that the pursued v*' hicl' »/as ca .rr j in g' Shaikh Muhammad al Sabah» 3, From ^he aorcgoing, it will appnar to the esteemed Embassy that the araml pet trox |police^ v*urunav/ai'e 1 that the vehicle carried iihaikh muhacua^d al 3abah, ana that the police could not realise this fact during the pursuit in view of the long Pa \ ud (2 jc distance between the two vehicles ant the VAMtm^vo^ of the Tc Shaikh a c^i imuim aespite its pursuit lor a uioUuice of dbout 1UO kiiOmetrub, iaureever, the road in which the pursuit took place v»ub a.ii Irregular road foi* normal travelling between Kowe it and Iraq, a fuc+ which forced A he Iraqi patrol police to con+lnue carrying out their duties in the belief that the vehicle they were pursuing was an ordinary civilian vehicle.

Britoonsul, Buahire. i personal for Hov^es. r I v 6- Fiye new cars costing about 13.5,000 each t. have been requisitioned in Kuv /ait« Do you want one of thee Please note that I am not repeat not vailing to sanction ai advance from any of our funds, - RESIDENT - i«t ls 53/83 If we receive a favouraWe reply to S.32, or if the Shaikh of Kuwait can be ..ade to give up one of the two cars he is keeping vle oa , n p robably let ^33^^ ■! have the third car. 2. I would note however that Captain Howes' franchise expires on or about Hovember 10th and if a car is obtained for him through the Goveriment of India it is extremely unlikely that it will arrive by that time. If a car ia available from those detained at Kuwait (l) Major Hickinbotham (2) Capt.Howee and (3) Mr •Rogers Lave applied for it« Major Hickinbotham's excuse for t 4 ^ tli asking for a new car appears to be very flimsy vide para# 3 ol b # 25 and I have already told him vide para. 3 of ^#29 that I consider the need of the other two officers greater* Capt. Howes has a car in a very bad •; condition which cannot be- used for touring. I have told him more than once that I consider that he should obtain a better car to enable him to carry out his duties properly. Mr. Rogers has no car at all and has been trying to get one from India for the last year. He certainly requires one here, but it is doubtful how long he will retain his present post. If therefore one of the Kuwait cars becomes available I consider Capt.Howes should be allowed to purchase it, especially in view of what is stated in para. 2 above. 4. If any of our officers is allowed to purchase one of the Kuwait cars, or special arrangements are made for him to buy a car through the Government of India, I consider that this should be conditional on his agreeing (a) not to sell the car locally without the permission of the P.H. and (b) on his leaving the Gulf (if he does not wish to take car with him) to sell it to another ol our officers, if any wishes to buy, at a reasonable m 1 j 1 .r J r / priceprice i If necessary the P.R. will have to determine what is a reasonable price, but in any case it should not exceed the cost price. I am suggesting these conditions because one of our officers in Persia recently sold his car to a Persian at an enormous profit, and was then unable to obtain a replacement so that he put himself completely out of action as a touring officer. It is possible to sell a new car in Persia now at a profit of 4c0 or 500 %• Id. f.R.H. 22/9 • Kuwait endorsement No.G/875* dated 11 .9•42.

J I have discussed this case with Major Hickinbotham. i ifeta id His car is in good running order but the wood-work requires removal. His idea now is to induce the Shaikh to exchange it for one of the new cars which he has kept in reserve. Apart from this possibility he does not think that the Shaikh would willingly part with one of the cars, but that if pressed he would agree. He requires one in 4ny case for •' • * v his Secretary who is without a car. I suggest that a reply to S.32 should be awaited. If the reply is favourable we should obtain cars for Gapt. Howes and Mr.Rogers from India, and let the Baghdad Embassy Lave tr ree of the cars at Kuwait. If Major Hickinbotham is permitted to exchange his station wagon for one of the other two care at Kuwait he should report the terms of the trans- action in detail for approval. If the reply from the Govt.of India is unfavourable I think we should if possible induce the Shaikh to give up /another. 47 ' y O another car then let the Er.bae.y have three 0ara and Captain Howes one.

A telegram has now been received from the Govt, of India that they cannot buy oars for officers but will permit export of care purchased in direct negotiation with dealers.

Ut- Iup . C 6' / *?£() —I agree with my predecessor that Captain Howes and Mr.Rogers have a 'better claim than Major Hickinbothanu Captain Howes* oar requires replace ment, and 'both he and V.O. have heen attempting to secure cars for a very long time - in fact I remember that V.O. was attempting to secure a car before I left for Cairo. On the other hand since they are obtaining these cars through the support of this Residency it will 'be reasonable to ask them to place them at our disposal if and when they leave the Gulf. 2. I therefore propose that they should take over these cars on the following condition, via. that in the event of their leaving Persia or the Persian Gulf they would offer their cars to t his Residency at the purchase price plus any customs duty that may be leviable. ^ ^ ^ 3.

We may (a) instruct P.A. accordingly and -(b) telegraph at the same time to Baghdad, repeating Kuwait, saying that (i) the protest has been communicated (ii) that the incursion in question is normal winter tribal movement and mention the annual winter movement of the very large number of Southern Euphrates Iraqi 04^4 tribes into Kuwait territory. It is not clear how the Shaikh can make it difficult /i53/83 and costly fur the Iraqi tribe^ moving into Kuwait, If trouble is started, it is probable .that the Kuwait tribes will suffer more from intertribal raiding than the Iraqis, and we dont want any action to be taken that will result in a recrudescence of the inter tribal raiding in Kuwait territory of 10 - 12 years ago, /.if t a &lt;:■ ' fH 4/1/44 J 15.
