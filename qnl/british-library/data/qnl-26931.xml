It will be seen fron the Foreign Oflice letter that there can be no question of His Majesty’s Goverruiant enteiing into an extradition treaty with Muscat, and that if the Gk/veinment oi India should wish to conclude such a treaty it would be preferable in the Foreign Office view to avoid any obligation to surrender to iwnscat any pel sons other than Muscat subjects and the classes of British-protected persons in respect of whou the Sultan is recognised under -the recent Treaty to have jurisdiction* 3* * ve sone doubt however in the light of the Sultan’s letter whether if would not be possible to settle this ns.tier without the fonatality of a treaty. I^ce paragraph 2 of Hickinbothan’s letter of I9th Julj, there does exist machinery under Chapter III of the Indian .extradition act, 1903 , which a request of the Sultan, without any oxtiedition treaty, could set in motion to obtain the surrender of a Muscat subject who had fled to Inaic from the territorial jurisdiction of the Muscat courts, it is true that the Government of India have discretion to grant or refuse any such request, but if the procedure could be explained to the Sultan and if the Government of India would be piepc.rod to give him cn assurance that assent to such a request would not be unreasonably withheld it is possible that he would regard this C.

(3 Y©4*i*» ainoorodt Sge.) R. P&amp;&amp;Lr7319 -7 D v A FOREIGN OFFICE, SvW.l. 19th December, 1939 J Dear Gibson, y Your letter (P*Z•6885/39) of the 16th November to Eyres, regarding the suggested conclusion of an extradition treaty with Muscat, has been passed to me. 2 , As we have extra-territorial rights in Muscat an extradition treaty providing for the surrender of British subjects seems to be out of the question, because a treaty containing such a provision would in theory mean that we surrendered our rights. Moreover, the Fugitive Offenders r \? Act, v/hich has been applied to Muscat by Article 12 of the Muscat Order in Council, 1939, covers cases where British subjects who have committed offences in Muscat have fled to British territory and vice versa. 2&gt;. If we were to conclude a treaty undertaking to surrender foreigners to Muscat, there might be objections from foreign countries: France, for instance, appears to have the right, under her treaty of 1844 v/ith Muscat, to exercise jurisdiction over French citizens in Muscat. HaiECD. POL. DEPt7 Furthermore/ J.P. Gibson, Esq. ?JulUQ39 ImMmmtti m INDIA OFFICE(D 4 . Furthermore, the Home Office have taken the line that negotiations for the conclusion of an extradition treaty with a foreign country should not, for the future, be entered upon unless the foreign country concerned has adopted the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners which have been recommended by the International Prison Commission. 5. In these circumstances it would, in our opinion, be undesirable to embark upon negotiations with Muscat for the conclusion of an extradition treaty under the United Kingdom Extradition Acts. G. We observe that the Indian Extradition Act, 1903, contains provisions regarding the surrender of fugitive criminals in the case of States other than Foreign States. The expression 'Foreign State' is defined in the Act as meaning a State to which, for the time being, the Extradition Acts, 1870 and 1873, apply. It might perhaps be suggested to the Government of India that they should consider the possibility of concluding a treaty with Muscat under this Act. There is much to be said for refusing in this particular case, to accept a binding obligation to surrender a national of any third State; and/and we think the obligation should he limited to persons who are Muscat subjects or who are nationals of Koweit, Bahrein, Qatar, the Trucial States or (if the Colonial Office agree) of the Aden Protectorate, and (again, if the Colonial Office agree) nationals of Zanzibar of Omani origin who own property in Muscat (see the definition of ’’British Protected Persons” in Article 4 of the Muscat Order-in-Council 1939). As regards the form of such a treaty, there would appear to be no objection to its being concluded between His Majesty and the Sultan. We agree that the initial drafting might well be left to the local authorities. 7 . The question of making arrangements with the Sultan for the arrest and handing over to His Majesty’s Consul of British subjects who are fugitives from justice is one on which we find it difficult to offer any suggestion. Article 13 (3) of the Treaty of the 5th February, 1939, provides in effect that no British subject shall be arrested etc. by an officer of the Sultan save under an order signed by His Majesty’s Consul and that any British subject arrested etc. shall be placed in the custody of His Majesty’s Consul. It may be that the presentationof a signed order to the Muscat authorities would be sufficient to achieve the arrest of a wanted British subject; but perhaps your Department may be able to suggest some other method. Yours sincerely,INDIA OIDIGD, 'OITEPALI Z. 6835/39. LONDON» 3.W.1 16th November, 1939 Dear Eyres, On the 25th August (India Office letter No. P.Z. 5099/39) we sent the Foreign Office a copy of correspondence from the Persian Gulf regarding the suggested conclusion of an extradition treaty with Muscat, and I now enclose a copy of a demi-official letter Dated 25th from the Government of India on the subiect. October,1939. 2. The first point on which we should be glad to have the views of the Foreign Office relates to the scope of the treaty. Theoretically, perhaps, it should be treated as a corollary to the recent Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation and so, on our side, be made for the United Kingdom and India, with provision for the accession of the Dominions and for extension to the Colonies. But for all practical purposes, I imagine, H.M. Lyres, Esq., Foreign Office S.W.l. an/an extradition treaty operating between Muscat and India only (though concluded, I presume, by His Majesty 'for India') would be adequate r .&lt;nd this would of course simplify the procedure and drafting. Would the Foreign Office think this latter course satisfactory, or would they prefer, if a treaty is to be made, to give it the wider scope so as to provide against the possibility that an extradition treaty between the United Kingdom, or one of the Dominions or Colonies, and Muscat might one day be thought desirable? 3. Secondly, the Government of India wish to entrust the drafting to 'the Legal Experts at the India Office.' Presumably this is the consequence of the Muscat Order^B in Council having been revised in London, chiefly with Beckett’s help.' If the treaty is to operate between India and Muscat only the initial draft might well be left to the local authorities, v/ho will know what it is essential to include. If the United Kingdom is to be a party it would perhaps be better to prepare a draft here, possibly using the 1932 extradition treaty with Iraq as a model/o. model, as the Government of India suggest. In either case the treaty would presumably extent to foreigners fugitive from justice in India etc. or Muscat, and not be confined, as the Political Agent seems to suggest, to Muscat is and British subjects. The fact that the exercise of criminal jurisdiction over British subjects rests exclusively with the Political Agent introduces complications, as you will note that it is felt to be desirable that the Muscat authorities should in practice assist in the arrest of fugitive British subjects. 7/e should be glad to have your views. 4. Pending your reply I have not sent copies of the correspondence to the Dominions Office or the Colonial Of!ice. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) J. P, GIBSONP.Z.6885/39 Minute *K Paper. Lejai Adviser’s Departnient. Although it is true, as stated by the Sultan, that there is ''no connection 1 ' between him and the Government of India 'to bind either party' in the matter of extradition of offenders, I doubt whether it is correct to say - as the Political Aaviser observes - that 'the 'e is no machinery that can be set in motion to obtain the surrender of a Muscat subject who has fled' (presumably into British India). There is in fact such machinery in Part III of the Indian Extradition Act, and the existence of a specific treaty is not, as far as I can see, a condition precedent to the setting in motion of that machinery, - although, of course, in the absence of any treaty, the Government of India would have an unfettered discretion to refuse to hand over a fugitive, whether application for his surrender was made under s.7 or under s.9 of the Act. As for the converse case, viz. - the surrender by # the Sultan of fugitive criminals, I note that the Political Adv-ireer confines his comment (and suggestion) to the case of fugitive British subjects. He agrees that in theory there is in their case no necessity for any agreement as to extradition, but adds that such an agreement would facilitate their apprehension in practice. But, however that may be, there is, I assume, no way at by rUc present open to secure the surrender of such fugitives fporc justice in British India as are not British subjects. And this may well be deemed necessary. On the question of the course to be adopted, I was at/aOMHK /&lt;*» /u«-.^L/-^ at first inclined to agree that there was no reason why any treaty entered into in this connection should he confined, on our side, to British India, - and indeed it ma^ he better in any case to communicate with the Foreign Office, for, if it is in the circumstances felt desirable to give an extended operation to any such treaty, there is no point in taking two bites at a cherry There might well be a distinction drawn between the course adopted with regard to Indian States, and that ^ *v&lt;T7* considered appropriate in regard to Muscat - which/' I believe, i® technically an independent State? £ As to Indian States, the^treaty with Nepal will be found in Aitchison, Vol.II pp.118-122, and that with Ulwar (in a form adopted in the case of numerous oth'r small States) in Aitchison Vol.III. (In the case of practically all of these treaties, a subsequent modification was made applying the procedure of the Indian Extradition Act to the extradition from British India to the State concerned), ) s y ** L/ ^ ^ ^ V-/ WllW J. v-t y • / ^ ^ - / r / ^ 'V S' / l/^~ £/*'*** ■ d y At. ■ J- Z^«4y y ^ iC- it* J */7&gt;- c£ c ^rL ct. *£ ^ (‘■l / L+v/ y *£ p1nLj~* /SaJl,i /*4 ' f'/) &amp;^ // «,/ M /3S/-W ^(^4. /2~&lt;- ^ 44- J Ih.COKFIES:.. 1 .. lAL. 5^ D.O.No. ' Procos FILE COPY H'LtttM* C* y-w , 'V )Q External Affairs Department, ^ New Delhi, The ' October W d eKfeaditio^ treaty with Muse G8S5 % 7 Will you please refer to dir Tronchard Fowle’s letter f^cj No._C/317, dated the 8th August 1959, a copy of which was sent direct to His Britannic Majesty’s Secretary of State for India under Printed Letter No. C/318, dated the 8th August 1939? Z. The Government of India have no objection to an extradition treaty being concluded with His Highness the Sultan of Muscat on the lines proposed. If the treaty is to be confined to extradition between British India and Muscat, it will presumably not be between the United Kingdom and Muscat, but between His Majesty acting in respect of his Indian Possessions and His Highness the Sultan of Muscat. We should be very grateful if the drafting could be done by the Legal Experts at the India Office, who will no doubt consult the Foreign Office if necessary. In so far as the substance of such a treaty is concerned, the Extradition Treaty between the United Kingdom and Iraq, 1932 would probably serve as a useful model. 3.

I have the honour to enclose a copy of letter Ho* 244 dated the 13th July 1938 that I have received from His Highness the Sultan of Muscat on the subject of 'Extradition'* 2« The present position is that whereas the Political Agent is empowered by the Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881, under the Muscat order—in—Council, 1915, to obtain the surrender from British India of absconding British Subjects who have committed an offence in Muscat territory for trial in the Agency Court at Muscat there is no machinery that can be set in motion to obtain the surrender of a Muscat Subject who has fled beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the Muscat Courts. 3* Although, as stated above, provision is for the surrender from British India of British Subjects for trial in‘ike political Agent's Court at Muscat there exists no provision by which the Sultan can be required to hand over a British Subject, fugitive from justice, for trial by the Political Agent or by some court having Jurisdiction outside His Highness's terri tories.
