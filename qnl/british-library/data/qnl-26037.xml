As regards Aden Protectorate and the Sudan it would I feel be most difficult to ensure that no person devoid of means left for the Hejaz but a warning could perhaps be issued in these territories.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000517.0x0002ba_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/752</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x0002ba</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/752</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Ext 4986/42 Destitute Yemenis and Hadhramis entering Saudi Arabia'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1942/1942</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-10-25T22:14:19</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (3 folios)</extent><extent>There is only one letter within the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 3; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains a letter from the British Ministry at Jedda to the Foreign Office, informing them that Ibn Saud had asked for assistance in preventing destitute Yemenis and Hadramis from entering Saudi Arabia, requesting that only subjects with means of subsistence be admitted.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia 'Abd al-'Azīz bin 'Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa'ūd</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Immigration</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x0002ba#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
