Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf(XS031/34K( 15/47) ) Ext &gt;1166/47 FOREIGN OFFICE, 8.W.I. 21st May, 1947. Dear DojoialdsoA, Mamy thajdcs for your letter Ext.869/47 of 24th April. 2. We are aj&amp;xious to push ahead as quickly as possible with our plans for taking over the posts in the Persian Gulf and in South and East Persia. We are very much handicapped by our almost complete lack of knowledge of the establishment and organisation side of these posts about which we only know what you have kindly told us. In order to make plans for administering them as Foreign Service posts, we need a certain amount of information which we think can only be supplied by those on the spot. 3. I have drawn up a short memorandum which we should now like to be sent as soon as possible to those posts we shall be taking over; i.e. Hashed, Khorramshahr, Bushire (which as you know will become a Vice Consulate under.the Foreign Office regime), and the Agencies at Kuwait, Bahrein and Muscat. It may be that you would prefer to send the memorandum with enclosures to Hay in the first instance for those posts I have mentioned except Meshed, since the Political Resident controls the officer and Ministerial staff manning all the others. 4. In regard to the Residency at Bahrein itself the establishment is of course a larger and more complicated problem if only because the control of the quarantine organisation is carried out from there. It would help us very much if Hay could give us the outline of the establishment there (in a chart form, if possible, as for the other places) and also the other particulars in respect of the Residency for which the memorandum asks. But we should appreciate additional information from him on matters common to the other posts as well; e.g. some idea of how the various Ministerial officers rank in their own heirarchy. For instance I see in Hay»s letter D0429/3 of the 7th Mareh to you he describes three different categories of officers, Indian political Service Officers, Ministerial Gazetted Officers and Ministerial staff. We have quite a clear idea of the I.P.S. cadre since recruitment for it has been conducted for many years from this country, but we are in the dark about the other two categories. For instance the Ministerial staff and Ministerial Gazetted Officers divided into grades? What sort of people are they and how are they recruited ? What are their prospects of promotion and at what age are they reevuited? Are they divided into grades and if so that sort of job is done by each grade and what is the salary, the incremental scale, etc. ? Can we be given a rough idea of the ages of the different grades in their categories ? Presumably the Ministerial Gazetted Officers are comparable to Warrant Officers or N.C.Os. in the Services, but we do not know. Can Hay give us some idea of the different kinds of duties of the categories, and, of the three categories of staff, what proportion would one expect to find in any given set-up? Hay has given us the extracts of financial terms of service in his letter under reference which was forwarded under cover of your letter 570/47 of the 20th Mareh; what we are anxious to have also is the background and the general conditions of service for these different categories of staff. We should also be grateful for a brief note from Hay regarding the penslonabllity of these categories, retiring ages, normal number of years* service and how pension is calculated, whether allocation can be made to dependents, etc. •» E.P.Donaldson, Esq., C.M.G India Office. 5./...5* Provided you see no objection f I should be gratefal therefore if the memorandum with enclosures (referred to in para 3 above) could be sent either to Bahrein for onward transmission or direct personally to each of the posts in question asking them to supply all the information asked for by the memorandum as scon as possible. These, together with the information we hope Hay can supply as regards Bahrein itself and the general conditions of the service as a whole, will be most useful. It may be that a certain number of queries will arise about which tha South $nd East Persia posts could get elucidation from the Embassy at Tehran to wfcoch we are sending a eopy of this letter with the enclosures. 6. Turning now to the suggestion made by Hay that we should send out an officer to go into all these problems on the spot, we agree in principle that this is most desirable although we think it better first to have the replies from the posts to the enclosed memorandum and the information from Hay. if we get this information and can assemble and digest it here first, any officer we then send out will be able to make a much better job of it than a man sent out knowing nothing at all about the set-up. Also he should be able to make much quicker progress if he aas some idea of the ground to be covered before he leaves. 7. I am afraid I cannot at the moment answer any of Hay^ queries. All our pensionable appointments are confined to British subjects; whether Indians or Anglo-Indians will continue to be British subjects is something which will emerge at a later date. 8. In return for Hay*s summary of the regulations for the l.p.S. 4n the Gulf we enclose herewith for his information 6 copies of the f regulations for 'Branch A' of the Foreign Service. (The term « Branch A ,f is explained in the attached memorandum) • Regulations for 'Branch a' of the Foreign Service (i.e. the executive and clerical staff which we ti|ke to be similar to your Ministerial staff) are not yet ready but will follow closely the pattern of the Branch A regulations while being rather less generous on the whole. You will no doubt explain to Hay that these regulations are applicable only to the established members of the Service, i.e. to the career men who are entitled to a pension at the end of their service. 9. Since the above was drafted we have had sight of your letter Ext*973/47 of the 7th May, 1947, to Garran, forwarding eopy of Government of India letter d.o. NO.F15-BP0/47 of 25th April in which some very useful information has been furnished by the Government of India. We shall study this carefully and should like to see any amendments to this which the Political Bcsident may send to the Government of India as requested by them. At the same time the information for which we are now asking in the attached memorandum is complementary to that contained in the enclosure to your letter to Garfan except for the salaries and names of people actually in post. I think, therefore, that the present letter and the attached memorandum can stand without duplicating, ex eept in a very minor degree, the returns being made by the Political Resident to the Government of India. Yours sincerely, (sd.) T.J.Wilson.

Foreign Service I have been considering what steps can be taken to ensure that employees of Missions and Consular posts abroad do not in the future retire without adequate financial provision for their old age. With the creation of Branches B and C of the Foreign Service many employees who previously served on a temporary basis with no guarantee for the future and without pension rights have been recommended for establishment. If accepted, they will form part of the Foreign Service and will be as freely transferable from one post to another as members of Branch A and with the right to a pension at the end of their service. Plans for Branch D (Chancery Servant-Guards) are taking shape. 2. One result of these measures will be that the number of unestablished employees at posts abroad will fall considerably when the size of staffs returns more nearly to normal. But there will always be, for one reason or another, a small number of temporary staff to supplement the established Foreign Service framework and it is provision for these employees on retirement which is now under consideration. I am not thinking of inflated war-time staffs or of the large numbers at present engaged on work of a relatively short-term nature in the recently liberated territories or in countries behind the “ iron curtain,” but of the Relatively small number of “ temporary ” employees, both British and foreign, whom we shall continue to employ at normal posts even when the established Foreign Service is up to full strength. 3. I hope eventually to introduce some scheme to which temporary employees would contribute to ensure that they receive an adequate retiring gratuity (or pension or annuity) when their employment comes to an end. But this is necessarily a long-term project involving legislation which I am unable to anticipate. My immediate concern is with those employees who have already served us for a number of years in a ” temporary ” capacity (or who are likely to do so in the future) and who for one reason or another are not being established in the Foreign Service. It may be that they are only employable in a particular town or 14392 34411—10 His Majesty’s Consular Officers.country or that they have certain specialised knowledge or qualities which have a greater value in a given country than could be expressed in terms of any grade of the Foreign Service. Or it may be that they are not for one reason or another suitable for one of the regular branches of the Foreign Service, e.g., on grounds of nationality. 4. It may be possible to offer such people what is known as “ local establishment ” ; that is to say permanent pensionable employment but only in the country where they are serving or a group of homogeneous countries, and in a “ local grade.” Suc 1 ^ establishment. would not imply a right to employment elsewher if the job in question came to an end. Naturally therefore ” local establishment ” could only be offered to persons of whose permanent employment at any given post there is a reasonable prospect. 5. Before considering further the possibilities of local establish ment in the Foreign Service, I need to know approximately the numbers involved. I should be glad therefore if you would forward to me a list of those members of your staff, including Consular, Commercial Diplomatic and Information staff, whom you would recommend for local establishment either on the strength of their past record of service with His Majesty’s Government, or who, on their present showing, are likely to remain with us permanently as far as can reasonably be foreseen. It is unlikely that foreigners will be admitted even to local establishment, but you should nevertheless include them for the present purpose. Your reply should give name, sex, age and nationality of the employee, a very brief description of the posts previously held, particulars of present employment with approximate dates and present salary in sterling. 6. I should emphasise that this circular is only a fact-finding enquiry. Neither the conditions of service nor the basis upon ^ which pensions of employees locally established would be calculated^ have yet been agreed upon, and it therefore would be premature / this stage to make any statement to potential candidates which would provoke enquiries on these points. 7. A similar circular has been addressed to His Majesty’s Representatives (as No. 0189). I am.

Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Ltd. at Bahrain, (b) existing rates of dearness allowance and (c) existing rates of house rent allowance. 2. It is proposed to offer these terms only to temporary clerks who are already serving and new entrants. 3. The rate of pay proposed is more generous than that at present in force but It has to bo remembered that the service will be non~pensionable and liable to termination at short notice and that ah any rate for the present there will be no provident fund benefits. 4. The general terms of service proposed are not exhaustive but it has been impossible for m in the time at my disposal to work out a complete code on the lines of the Government of Indian Fundamental Rules.

It may be necessary to ask the Governments of India and Pakistan to allow a few of the permanent stuff to remain on deputation after the 15th August 1948 if they are willing to dc sc in order to ovoid having to fill the more important posts with young and dnexperienced hands. 7. I should be grateful for very early orders on the terms I have proposed as juaffbars of the temporary staff are likely to leave and seek service in India unless they can be assured of reasonable continuity of service on satisfactory terms here.

Stobart, Esquire, Political Agent &amp; Consul Muscat• Sir, With reference to Major Dredged Demi-official letter No. M/48 dated the 2nd June, 1948, regarding the grant of three year contracts to members of the temporary establishment, I beg to state that in the event of a contract being offered me on your recommend ation, I would request that the 1 Confidential Allowance 1 now being paid me for holding charge not only of the Confidential Office, but of India Office Officer, Foreign Office, and Navy Cyphers etc., be continued until such time as I am relieved of such responsibilities. I beg also to state that as Confidential Clerk I have been, and still am, called out at all -parts of the day and night outside office hours to attend to messages or any special work delegated to me by the Political Agent. In view of this, the responsibilities of holding charge of Cyphers etc., and the additional work that has been allotted to me as a result of the post of the Assistant Confidential Clerk being abolished, I request that the confidential allowance be included in the terms of contract, should one be offered me ( for which allowance I shall be most grateful )• I beg to remain, Sir, Your most obedient servant, ( A.S.

Will you please refer to ray telegram No. C 230 dated the 24th July, 1948, and to your Demi-official letter No.M/48 dated the 2nd June, 1948 ? The delay in replying is regretted. 3. I am well satisfied with the present staff in the Main and Confidential Offices, and I consider that the two new recruits PJohammed Faiz Khan and Ashar Ali Khan will do well. Rosario, the Confidential Clerk, has asked me about 4. the former Confidential Allowance which, under the Government of India, used to be given to those in charge of Cyphers. The draft contract makes no mention of such allowances, as I assume that His Lfajesty’s Government considers, logically enough, that strict attention to security is incumbent upon all our staff. However, as long as the present system of Main and Confidential Offices continues, in fact, if not in theory, I can see quite a strong case for the allowance. I am well pleased with his work. 5. Furthermore, I might point out that the Confidential Clerk in Muscat has to turn out at odd hours of the day and night to decypher * immediate telegrams 1 ( often from outside authorities e.g. Civil Aviation India or Headquarters British Forces, Aden ) and I consider that there should be some recompense given. I should be grateful for your views. Yours sincerely Major A.L.A. Dredge, MBE., Secretary to H.E. the Political Resident Persian Gulf, Bahrain. asrBAHRAIN, 19th August, 1948.
