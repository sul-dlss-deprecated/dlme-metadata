Since there is no legal basis for existence of station at Henjam end there is no general principle of international law requiring in ell circumstances the admission into a country duty free of goods required for the use of a foreign government, exemption cannot be claimed as of right. This applies equally to exemption from Trade Monopoly Law restriction and from customs duty. 3. it might have been possible to base request on ground of courtesy. Governments often grant frenchise to stores belonging to other governments on this ground alone and in the absence of any obligation to do so under either international law or some special agreement. But this is usually only done for particular reasons on special occasions, and the use of Henjam by H.M. shxps hardly falls into this category. 4. There remains the status o uo_ understanding. In view of 1926 correspondence this clearly does not cover customs franchise, and you should now withdraw request for franchise, explaining, if you think it necessary or desirable,2 . f’ desireble, that search of your archives has shown that duty has been paid in the past* 5 C As regards monopoly restrictions, you should not attempt to do more than make best arrangements you can ora.liy ? without pressing question beyond safety point - i.ec beyond point at which Persian government might be provoked into raising question of categories A and 3 of stores, or even whole question of Henjamo io Any argument you employ will have to be used with great caution in view of Persian demand of 1932 for our withdrawal, revival of which it is most desirable tc avoid* Addressed to lehr an Nod33, repeated to India.

Please see foreign Ofi'ice letter ol the 16th November, on p.z.7 0iDl/34 below, regarding a difficulty which has arisen owing to the refusal of the Persians to allow certain stores for use in the 3.I.M. Depot at Henjam to be imported auty free. The letter is self-explanatory. 2* we clearly cannot take our stanu, in the lace of Persian reluctance to repeat the concession which they granted to usy aftey difficulty^ in 1931, on the lact tnat that concession was^ranted. Prom the Foreign Office letter it appears that we have no legal standing in the matter, and on political grounds it is, of course, most desirable to avoid raisin^ the question of our continued use of Henjam or giving the Persians any excuse for renewing their request that we should evacuate it. In these circumstances, the course suggested by tne Foreign Office and embodied in their draft telegram to Tehran seems suitable, and I submit that we may concur in it, subject to ctny views wnicn tne admiralty may express. Sir H. Hoare’s despatch has been repeated to the Government of India, and it is proposed tnat the Foreign Office draft telegram should also be repeated to them. On the who-le, I think it is unnecessary to consult them before concurring In the course oi action proposed. The arguments for that course are cogent and it is most unlikely that the Government of India would dispute them. While the r uepot is in name an Indian ferine depot, the Indian marine have not now for some time been employed in tne Gulf, and I understand from the Admiralty and- the military Department that the only staff at present maintained there is a tally clerk named Telltfs, under whom some coolies serve, and who acts for practical purposes as an a^ent for the Navy, looking after stores and making himself useful to tne ships of the Persian Gulf Gquadron when tney put in at Henjam.

Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. IMMEDIATE. XT' ^ With reference to Foreign Office letter E 6302/ 328/34 of the 1st January, 1932, enclosing a copy of a note from the Persian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to His Majesty 1 s Legation at Tehran, respecting the importation into Henjam free of Trade Monopoly Law restrictions and customs duty of certain stores for the use of the Royal Indian Marine depot, I am directed hy Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit to you the accompanying copy of a despatch from His Majesty^ Minister at Tehran stating that the Persian Government are reluctant to grant the same facilities as were granted in 1931 in respect of a further consignment of stores which it is now desired to import into the island. 2. In Sir John Simon f s opinion the determining factor in the situation is the admitted absence of any legal right for the use of Henjam as a depot by His Majesty 1 s ships. There is no general principle of international law requiring in all circumstances the admission into a country duty free of goods required for the use of a foreign government, and there can therefore be no question of pressing for the exemption of the stores in question from either the restric tions of the Trade Monopoly Law or the payment of customs duty as a matter of legal right. The only possible ground for claiming exemption, apart from that of courtesy, would be that it was granted in 1931 and that it would be reasonable for the Persian Government to continue to grant it until such/ The Under-Secretary of State, India Office.28 suoii time as the position at Henjara was regulated by some definite arrangement. There is, however, an obvious danger in the use of this argument: the position has been modified since 1931 by the receipt in the summer of 1932 of a formal demand from the Persian Government for the evacuation of Henjam and any active attempt to press for exemption might easily lead to a revival of this demand, which, though at present dormant, cannot be regarded as dead. 3*- In the circumstances Sir John Simon considers that the most that can be done is to leave it to His Majesty*s Representative at Tehran to obtain the best terms he can by some unofficial arrangement, without pressing the matter further than he considers safe. Sir Samuel Hoare will doubtless agree that it will be preferable to pay the customs duty, and even to comply with the Trade Monopoly Law restric tions, at any rate in regard to the category of stores now involved (i.e. category (c)) rather than to bring the whole ctuestion of Henjam to a head while the policy of His Majesty's Government in regard to this question is under re-consideration. 4. A draft of the telegram which Sir John Simon proposes to send to His Majesty's Representative is enclosed herein, and I am to express the hope that he may be informed at an early date whether Sir Samuel Hoare concurs in its terms. 5. A similar letter is being sent to the Admiralty. I am.
