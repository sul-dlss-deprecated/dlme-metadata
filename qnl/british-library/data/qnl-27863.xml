Dear Gi/bson, Would you please refer to my letter of the 21st September, to Peel under this number, regarding the pre-emption of Bahrein and Hasa oil? 2. In paragraph 5 of that letter the view was accepted that it would be preferable not to commandeer any Hasa oil lying in the Bahrein refinery. We have since gone into the question more fully and, though we do not appear to have received the text of any agreement between C*A*S.O*C. and the Bahrein Petroleum Company, it would seem from the enclosures to your official letter P.Z. 4221/38 of the 30th June, 1938, that the Hasa oil may be bought by the Bahrein Petroleum Company. 3. If this is so, there would appear to be no need to differentiate between Bahrein and Hasa oil, if the/ J.P. Gibson, Esq. REC»*P»OL.DEPt.

As far as Bahrein is concerned, we understand the position to he as follows. His Majesty’s Government wish to enter into an agreement with the Bahrein Petroleum Company v/hich will cover, inter alia, the pre-emption of their oil in certain circumstances. The Company object to this on the ground that it would greatly complicate their contracts with the firms to whom they supply oil, if these firms knew that such a clause might become operative. If, on the other hand, there were no such clause, and the oil were in fact pre-empted by His Majesty’s Government through the Government of Bahrein, the Company would simply plead ’’restraint of /princes” RECd.

This being so, I presume that the statement in your letter, that 'the Company ’’are fully av/are of the possibility of such action' means that they will not object to, and may even welcome, forcible action of the kind contemplated, as protection for themselves against third-party claims. 4. If this is so, we see no reason to object, and agree that, if Bahrein oil is required by His Majesty’s Government before the conclusion of the pre-emption agreement with the Company, action will have to be taken by the Sheikh as the Political Resident suggests. If, on the other hand, we have not rightly understood the position, and there is any chance of the Company objecting to the proposed measure, we should like to have an opportunity of offering further observations before any action is taken. / 5 . 5 *J o o ^rigitt sb^far^as 'princes' and everything would be all their obligations to third parties were concerned. 3.

With reference to your letter, P.Z.3354/39, of 16th June about the possibility of securing pre-emption rights over Hasa oil, my feeling is that it is probably not advisable to pursue this matter. I have no doubt you have considered the political aspect of the question, but knowing that H.M. Government are anxious to keep on friendly terms with Ibn Saud, and are indeed contemplating taking special steps to this end, I should have thought that any attempt on our part to secure a pre-emption of oil from his territory would be likely, unless we were to do it with his knowledge, to have unfortunate repercussions. To the extent moreover that Hasa oil is taken to Bahrein for refining, there should, I think, be no great difficulty in embracing it in the proposed pre-emption agreement with the Bahrein Petroleum Company, if it is found possible to secure this. From a practical point of view we shall in the case of both territories have a strong hold on oil exported from this area R. T. Peel, Esq., M.C., India Office, Whitehall, S.W. 1. RECd. POL.

There is another point, that in certain circumstances we may ^J^jve more production in this part of the world, including Iran, than we can arrange to transport; and if Ihn Saud were to he approached hy H.M. Government concerning a proposal for pre-emption he might conceivahly reply that he was agreeable provided we undertook to take the whole output. Such a suggestion might become an embarrassment.

Subject to the remarks of the Petroleum Department, we are of the opinion that it is worth while sounding the Company to see how they would react to the suggestion that they should undertake some such obligation. As Hasa is within the Saudi-Arabian territory, and as there is no question of approaching the Saudi Government, we recognise that the circumstances are somewhat different from the case of the Irucial sheikdoms, and that any agreement which we might secure would have no backing in the form of an undertaking from the territorial Sovereign to treat a breach of the agreement as a breach of the concession. Nevertheless, an agreement would place a moral obligation on the Company to sell to us as much of their Hasa oil as we wished to buy, and it might, in addition, result in some saving of coj IflECD.

If, on the other hand, the Coi reaction is very unfavourable, we do not think that it is worth while pressing these extraneous desiderata to such an extent as would prejudice our efforts to obtain a pre-emption and refinery agreement in respect of the new and the old Bahrein concessions. In that case we should presumably confine our efforts to discouraging the Company from erecting a refinery in Hasa and to persuading them to rely instead on refining any oil produced at Bahrein where it would come under our control in time of war.

Question of ensuring adequate supplies of oil from oil-producing y/ells in the Gulf States is clearly of great importance - please see paragraphs 14 and 19 of enclosure to Pov/le's demi-official letter No. C/14, January 18th, 1938, to V/alton and paragraph No. 12 of Fowled note, forwarded v/ith your demi-official letter No. P.z. 3128/38, May 19th, 1938. This desideratum appears to be secured by pre-emption clauses in agreements between the Companies and His Majesty^s Government except at Bahrain, where there is no agreement between His Majesty 9 s Government and Company. We do not know result of negotiations between Admiralty and Bahi'ain Petroleum Company, referred to in a private note of April 19th, 1938, but consider, in any case immediate steps should, if possible, be taken to negotiate an agreement with Company either through Sheikh, or direct, which wil] give us rights of pre-emption and control in the event of war on the lines of Muscat pre-emption agreement - copy of v/hich was forwarded under Gibson’s demi- official letter No . P.Z.5081, September 30th, 1938, to Powle. RECd. POL. D£Pt&gt; -8(VIAY1939 INDIA OFFICE3. Fowle in his demi-official note of January* 1938* (paragraph No.19) assumes that, even in the absence of such agreement, the Sheikh could, in exercise of his sovereign power, direct Company to sell their oil to His Majesty 1 ’s Government. We feel some doubt whether, in the absence of any clause in the Agreement between the Sheikh and the Company, this could be done without rendering Sheikh liable for damages. We suggest, hov/ever, that the matter should be examined urgently with a view' to ascertaining what procedure could be adopted in an emergency to secure oil supplies for His Majesty 8 s Government at Bahrain and at the same time to safeguard the legitimate interests of concessionaires. 4. ]?owle will no doubt telegraph his comments.The Residency, ^Vvv^ o(/^n.

Has it been thought worth while to consider the possibility of obtaining some sort of pre-emption rights over the Has a oil ? In view of the lack of absolute certainty (as it appears to me) of obtaining oil from Persia in the event of war, every extra ton of oil we can secure from the Arab side is very much to the good. * I am sending copies of this letter to Metcalfe, Tyssen, Poland and Weightman. - c - R.
