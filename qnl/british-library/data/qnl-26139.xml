These figures are required for the preparation of the Aden budget. Yours sincerely, M.J.

''ve in view of the definition of the liability for Indian income-tax given by the Financial Secretary in his Note at P.Z.5302/33, it seems clear that Companies and individuals who are doing business in Aden wil not in future be liable to Indian income-tax, in spite of the fact that ' their headquarters or principal branches are in India. Provided therefore that some Ordinance is issued in Aden, such persons will in future be liable to Aden income-tax. ^ 4*4 y J \ x*k ** Thi«i% however, would appear to be a point for the Colonial Office, though we might ask the Government of India to 7* supply up-to-date figures for the sum involved. ^ «M^OjuU&gt;OUJUaJUuU_m V / Financial Secretary .

I have no douht that if something like the existing Indian law continues to he the basis of Aden income-tax, Aden can tap everybody who does business there. In any case obviously Aden can have any lav/ it likes and can tax anybody who comes within its jurisdiction as much as it likes - subject to the usual limitations of expediency. It is, however, by no means necessarily the case that income tax in Aden will not be liable to Indian tax in addition if that income accrues ultimately to somebody within the ambit of the Indian law. How far double taxation is likely to arise and whether special arrangements should be made for relief therefrom I cannot say on the facts before me. But the possibility had better not be ignored. The above considerations are incidentally relevant to any estimate of the tax likely to accrue to Aden. In that connection I may also observe that it is impossible for us to supply or check any estimate of the probable yield of Aden income-tax. I do not understand why the Resident thinks that Aden tax rates must necessarily be the same as the Indian rates. This seems to be a question for decision on its own merits when the Budget is nearer finality. VV. UP fl'Vr. THE HESIDEHCY, Aden, 5th May 193 6. Dear Walton, Will you please refer to Laithwaite's letter to me P.Z.7877/33 dated 4th December 1933 enclosing copies of my letter of the 10th August 1933 on points arising in connection with the transier of Aden, and of the minutes of the meeting at the Foreign Office at which my letter was discussed? As it has been proposed that 1 should go to England this summer to discuss details connected with the transfer with the India Office and tne Colonial Office, I have prepared a note reviewing ohe fourteen points that were then discussed, ard adding remarks on further questions that appear to me to iequire consideration and decision before the transfer takes place. I enclose a copy of this note. I also enclose a copy of a draft estimate for Aden (as distinct from the Aden Protectorate) showing probable revenue and expenditure after its separation from India. I am sending a copy of the note and of the draft estimate to the Colonial Office and to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. Yours sincerely, (SD.) B.K.Reilly.

In September 1933 a statement was sent to the Acting Chief Commissioner at Aden by the Foreign and Political Department of the Gove rime nt of India showing the approximate amount of income tax and super tax paid on their Aden business by certain firms having their headquarters at Bombay, Surat and Calcutta with branches in Aden, The statement was as follows:WM ■D VJ M £5 A i • IV u A Jj • Net income tax and Net Income Tax and Super Tax.

Meanwhile the Income Tax Officer at Aden is requesting the local Managers of the Aden Branches of firms whose head &lt;ji arte rs are in India to be prepared to submit to him separate returns on account of their Aden business before the 1st April 1937 for the purpose of Income Tax assessment.Financial secretary, You will like to see the papers attached. It has, I think, teen accepted generally that with the separation of Aden from India the new colony will be entitled to claim income tax from firms doing business at Aden in respect of their Aden business, such as the A.P.O.C., etc. Political Secretary . Seen, thank you. The criterion of liability to Indian income-tax is laid down in the Indian Income-tax Act. Very broadly it is that the income can be described as •'accruing, arising or received in British India”. If Aden ceases entirely to be a part of British India, income arising in Aden, and no longer accruing, etc. in British India, will cease to be subject to Indian income-tax. Whether the new colony /Colony will be entitled to claim tax on such income for itself will depend on the law or ordinance in force in the colony. hth September 1933 .FILE COPY L etter from Colonel R e illy to Lir.Laithv/aite P.Z.4699/33 . Sunrnereet, EMITS. 10th August, 1933 Tel: lT:M.nrt/On 232 . J Dear Laithwaite, In conversation in London some weeks ago it was suggested that I should enumerate some of the points that; will require consideration if Aden is separated from India. Those that occur to me are:- 1 . Tnoome-tas from firms doin t T bus iness at .Man which at present is c ollected bv the Government of India filaewhere than at Aden , e.g. at Calcutta or Bombay. There are many such cases, the most important probably being the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which does a very large business at Aden, but whose income-tax is paid, not at Aden, but at Calcutta. In the event of separation it (and other firms in the same position) ought to pay in respect of its Aden business to the new Aden Government.1 / r &gt; i i 7 (The references in the note below are to the points raised in Colonel Eeilly’s demi-official letter of 10th August 1933). Colonel Reilly's d.o. letter of 10th August 1933 was discussed at the India Office on 15th August. In addition to Colonel Reilly there were present Mr. Cowell of the Colonial Office, Mr. Walton and Mr. Laithwaite of the India Office. \ LQlSk.jr* Income ta x arrangements in the event of separation . Mr. Cowell said that Crown Colonies as a rule were responsible for their own income tax arrangements and fixed their own rate of income tax. Theri would probably be much to be said for fixing (under a special Aden Ordinance, to be made by the new Aden Crown Colony Government) the present Indian rate of income tax as the rate in future to prevail In Aden. Colonel Reilly emphasised that if and so long as Aden was to continue to draw staff from India the question of income tax would be one of real importance. So far as budgeting was concerned it would be important to reach an understanding well in advance of actual separation as to whether firms such as the A.P.O.C., the shipping companies and the salt Interests, which did a large business in Aden, but whose income tax was at present paid not at Aden but at Calcutta or elsewhere in India, should pay in respect of their Aden business to the new Aden Government. It was agreed that this point should tfilcan un.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000011_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/1481</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000011</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/1481</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 1/45 'Aden.
