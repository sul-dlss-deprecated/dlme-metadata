                           Bhowany Pursad— a vessel from the Port of Porebunder [Porbandar] under British colours — which is alleged to have been seized by the Mahara Arabs [Al-Maharah] of Wadi in 1836. It instructs the Resident to appeal to Sa‘īd bin Sultān Āl Sa‘īd, the Imam of Muscat, for the return of the vessel if possible, and for the restoration of the property removed from the boat to Zanzibar.The item has three enclosures:1. A memorandum outlining a petition from Jewun Oodhowjee Gomashta, Manager of the firm Dhuumsey Lukmedass, representing the seizure of one of their boats by the Mahara Arabs of Wadi from the Arabian Coast; it notes this act is believed to have been undertaken in retaliation for the previous seizure of slaves from a Mahara boat at Porebunder. It outlines the Government of India's resolution on the matter, and the efforts of the British to affect the restoration of the boat, and property in return for compensation for the aforementioned slaves; so far these efforts have failed.2. Letter No. 315 of 1838 from Rear Admiral Charles Malcolm, Superintendent of the Indian Navy, at Bombay to Robert Grant, President and Governor in Council, Bombay, dated 16 May 1838.The enclosure is forwarding a report received from Commander William Denton — dated 10 May 1838 — reporting on his visit to Wadi and Kisseem to investigate the case of the Porebunder boat; it explains that his attempt to secure the restitution of the boat has been unsuccessful. It is further reported that a portion of the cargo has been removed to Zanzibar.In order to prevent such occurrences in future, it contains a recommendation from the Rear Admiral; it suggests making the Sultans of Maculla, Aden, or Kissem 'amenable for the deeds of these plundering tribes'.3. Letter from Robert Grant, Governor of Bombay to the Imam of Muscat, dated 14 Jun 1838.The enclosure is informing the Imam of the bugalow seized by the Maharah Arabs of Wadi; it requests the Imam's cooperation in securing the return of the plundered cotton from Zanzibar, and in affecting the restoration of the boat if it should appear at any of his ports.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023654731.0x000006#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
