A further question v/ill arise on accounts when they are rendered in respect of the second light huoy which has been or is being placed in the Sitrah Channel, to take the place of one of the two conical buoys there. I think a question will arise as to whether the dumb buoy taken away is to remain the property of the Company, or whether some allowance v/ill be made for it; and there may be one or two other questions of de tail to be settled before the accounts concerning the placing of buoys and the maintenance of buoys in the %* / ^ £ a- The Bahrein Petroleu M C&amp;m haTtKLim ited % I, BircHIN Lan e, London, e.c.3. 9th 1 ^arch 1937. f Dear Mr. Clauson, Charting and Buoying.

With reference to the copy of a letter dated 25th September 1936 from the Bahrein Petroleum Co., Ltd., London, forwarded to me under your endorsement No. PG/3598, dated 27th October 1936, the follow ing are ny remarks to the information called for by the Company:- Paras. 3 &amp; 4.- In ny letter No. 1/1304/301, dated 24-1-34 the approximate cost of three dumb buoys complete with moorings etc. was quoted as follows:- (a) Approximate cost of 3 dumb buoys completed with moorings. £ 600/- (b) Approximate cost of laying 3 dumb buoys and one light buoy (10 days if special cruise) otherwise 3 or more days if laid during rout ine cruise @ £56/- per day £ 560/- (c) Approximate annual cost of maintaining buoys including gas for light buoy say.. £ 280/- whereas the Company has been charged separately for the buoys and for the moorings, etc., as per statement sent in support of the bill re ferred to in your letter No. PG/88, dated 2-6-36. Para. 5.- The West Spit Buoy is the light buoy which was snifted from the sea end of Si trail Charnel where it was replaced by the Light Vessel. Paras. 6 &amp; 7.- Of the threeConical Buoys laid in the Sitrah Channel only one has 'been replaced by the West Spit Buoy leaving now two Conical Buoys in the Channel. An order has been placed for the second Light Buoy and on receipt of which the second Conical Buoy will be replaced by this buoy which will then leave one Conical Buoy only in the Channel. Para. 8.- Vide ny remarks to paras. 3 &amp; 4. Para. 9.- There will be no maintenance cost chargeable against the Company in respect of the dumb buoy relieved but chargesthe Sitrah Channel (2 dumb will be made for the existing buoys in buoys and 1 light buoy) as follows.— (a) Light Buoy.- Cost of maintenance including raising, chipping, ^painting and gas but not including cost of moorings, repairs to buoy, lamp and flasher, etc. ^ £152/- per annum per buoy. (b) Dumb Buoys.- Cost of maintenance including raising, chipping and painting buoy but not including moorings, and minor repairs to the buoy done, if any, in the Fao Workship, @ £80/- per annum per buoy. In conclusion I may state that the Itomb Buoy which has been relieved by the west Spit li^it buoy will be required for relieving the dumb buoys belonging to the Company which are a present in the Sitrah Channel. As regards the second Dumb Buoy it will be considered by this Directorate for taking over when same has been relieved. Sd/- For Port Director &amp; Director General of Navigation.

The account has been referred to the Company for consideration with the result that they draw attention to several items which are not quite clear to them and on which they would ask you kindly to let them have fur ther information before they send you a Draft in settlement of the account. There appears to be included the purchase price of only one buoy, namely, that referred to as the 'West spit Buoy.' This charge is Rs.10,967-10-0. There are, however, three conical mark buoys referred to under the heading of 'laying and maintaining the buoys', the cost of which is respectively Rs.1000.0.0., Rs.B33.5.4. and Rs.833.5.4. There are added to these costs various items which appear to be mainly concerned with the cost of mooring and transport charges. Is the West Spit Buoy the light buoy which was shifted from the sea end of Sltrah Channel where it was replaced by the lightship at present in that position, to a position at the south end of Muh&amp;rraq (26- 10* 3u' N., 50° 44 9 0' ».^ - -/u* the three oonioal mark buoys which were originally asked for to '^mapk the tiitrah Channel, one has been replaced by the so-called ,r *veat L»pit Buoy” a second one has been replaced by another lighted buoy, leafing only one conical mark buoy now in the Channel. In regard to the secondly mentioned light buoy, the Company has given an assurance to pay the capital expenditure on it, including tiio purchase of the buoy and moorings (such expenditure being estimated at £830) a nd tne maintenance cost thereof isuoh cost being entitled ut £152 per annum and to include attendant and gas). Have these changes been taken into account in arriving at the figures charged in respect of the three conical mark buoys originally asked for and placed in position to ether with their moorings. 0ns appreciates, of course, that the cost of placing those buoys into the Channel was an expenditure incurred, and must be met, by the Company. It Is also assumed that there are no maintenance costs chargeable against the Company in respect of two of the oonioal mark buoys but merely in respect of the on© which now remains between the two existing light buoys in the Sitra Channel. Will you please give the Company the necessary answers to clear away the points which have been raised in this letter ?

Dear Mr. Cle.uson, I think you are familiar vdth the correspondence which has passed between the India Office and Mr. Ballantyne relative to the marking of the Sitrah Channel at Bahrein with buoys. In the absence of Mr. Ballantyne from London I have been requested by The Bahrein Petroleum Co.Ltd. to take up with you the matter of changing one of the buoys in the Sitrah Channel. The buoy in question is a Nun Canbuoy shown on Admiralty Chart 3790 and is located approximately l^i miles 208° from the Bahrein lightship. The report of the Mooring Director of The Bahrein Petroleum Co.Ltd. at Bahrein is as follows: 'Several of the vessels using Sitra Channel and some of the B.I. steamers have complained of the buoy situated I 5 J miles 208° from Bahrein light ship, please refer to British Admiralty (Approaches to Bahrein) Chart 3790* 'This buoy lies directly on the course of vessels bound to Sitra, and of light draft shipping enroute to Manama. 'It is of material assistance during daylight, but at night it cannot be seen and therefore there is danger of colliding with it. Several vessels would not sail from Sitra at night for this reason. 'Strong currents, setting nearly at right angles to the Sitra channel, are usually experienced in the vicinity and a navigational aid is therefore necessary. 'It is advisable to replace this buoy by a light-buoy as soon as possible. This w r ould assure safe navigation at night as, under normal weather conditions, a lighted aid would be visible at all times on the route from Sitra moorings to the lightship.'- 2 - n I discussed this matter recently with Captain Bird of the ^Tearchus*. Captain Bird is also of the opinion that a lightbuoy is necessary at this point. He stated that a small lighted buoy could be installed at a comparatively small expense as credit would doubtless be given for the present buoy.” The Company suggest that it would be advisable to have this work done by the ’Nearchus* which I understand handled the previous work in connection with the installation of the buoys. The Company would very much appreciate it if the change could be made as soon as possible, and if any considerable time would be saved by cabling to the necessary authorities, the Company would be prepared to pay the cost of such cables.

As I mentioned to you on Friday last, the Company find from their experience that it is necessary to have a light buoy in the position now occupied by Dumb-buoy No.4 in the Sitrah Channel. As I understand it, the reason for this is that it is essential for tankers to be able to come in at night time. It is hoped that the Admiralty will see no object ion to this re-adjustment of the buoys. Assuming that it does not, May the Company ask that the Government of India arrange for Gumb buoy No. 4 to be replaced by a light buoy at the time the Lightship is placed in position? The question then arises as to what light buoy should be used. The present light buoy is a second-hand one which replaced the light buoy originally in position. If the present light buoy is suitable the Company would have no objection to buying it, otherv/ise the Com- pany would like to have a new light buoy supplied, if possi- ble by the Government of India. It is assumed that the arrangements already made for the maintenance of the light buoy in its present posi--2- 1st April, 1935 . rion would apply to the maintenance of the light buoy in its new position but as to this no doubt you will kindly let me know.

Dear Mr. Ballantyne, I write in confirmation of our conversation this morning to say that we have discussed with the Admiralty the point raised in your letter to me of DOth December about the Lightship. 2. The position which the Government of India have proposed for the Lightship is identical with the site originally proposed for the Company’s outer light- buoy - Latitude D6 0 31' N. Longitude 50°59V E, and it is one which the Admiralty regarded as offering every advantage when the question was under discussion in January 1934. But since that date a different position 6 degrees North, so far as I can see, of the position originally proposed - appears to have been selected for the outer lightbuoy as the result of local discussion. 3/ H,B.

The Government of India are, of course, the responsible lighting and 'buoying authority, and it would he necessary to discuss any alteration of the position of the lightship with them. The Admiralty have, however, suggested that, unless the Government of India see difficulty about this, it should be possible to meet the point which you have raised by mooring the lightship in 9i fathoms at Latitude N.

But before we take the natter up with them perhaps you would be so kina as to confirm my understanding that a location such as the Admiralty suggest, if the Government of India see no objection to it, would meet the point which the company have raised?

Caroe, Esq., C.I.E., Deputy secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign ana political DepartmentMilitary Branch, S.W. 1. 9th February 1935. We have now had an opportunity of considering Mr. Baliantyne's letter of the 20th December about the lightship at Bahrein which you sent to me under cover of your letter P.Z.7605/34 of the 21st December. As you will see from our letter M.0142/34 of the 12th February 1934, it was recognised, when the position for the lightship was under discussion in January 1934, that there would be every advantage in placing it on the site proposed for the company’s outer lightbuoy (Lat. 26 0 31*N. Long. 50°59i*E.). The present tangle seems to have resulted from the fact that when as a result of ORMONDE’S survey in February 1934, another position, giving the company a better channel, was selected for the outer lightbuoy, the Government of India were left still considering whether or not they would approve of the original proposed position as the site for the lightship and they have in fact just recently decided to approve it. This change in the position of the outer lightbuoy appears to have been made by consultation only among the people on the spot, but in any event we think that Mr. Ballantyne should not be left with the impression, which he seems to have, that the Admiralty are responsible for determining the position of the lightship; and that it should be made clear to him that we merely acted in a consultative capacity, the responsibility resting with the Government of India as the lighting and buoying authority for the Gulf. As for solving the difficulty which he has raised, we suggest that the lightship should be moored in 9i fathoms in Lat My dear Laithwaite, G.

This would leave the company with a straight channel to the oiling berth at Sitrah (which they seem entitled to expect) and would be equally suitable for ships making the Bahrein anchorage; and it would have the further advantage that it falls within the limit of the detailed chart No.3790, which the present position of the lightbuoy does not do.

Dear Mr.Laithwaite, I refer to your letter to me P.Z.7144/34 of the 23rd November. It would seem to be of question whether the position of the Lightship presently intended affords a direct course leading to the proposed oiling berth. The position proposed for the Lightship is, as you state, that originally proposed for the LightDuoy: the former is 6° south of the latter. My instructions are that upon completion of H.M.S.“Ormonde’s u survey, it was decided to place the buoys in the positions they now occupy in order that the vessels inbound to Sitrah anchorage could steer a direct course along a 3-mile wide channel from No. 1 to No. 4 (roughly, east of the Sitrah anchorage) buoys. There is a distinct advantage to this condition of no turning points since there would be no particular danger if No. 2 and No. 3 buoys were not seen/ V T 2 - 2Dth December, 1934. to be preferable for the Lightship to be in the position of the No. 1 buoy. His Majesty’s Admiralty may, however, have chosen the proposed position for the Lightship because it is the most advantageous for vessels entering Manama Harbour. Prom the above it would seem to be preferable that the Lightship be stationed at the position of the'No. 1 buoy although, as I understand it, it will serve very well in the position proposed, the only disadvantage being that vessels inbound to Sitrah may be delayed during times of low visibility. The enclosed Chart (which I would ask you kind ly to return) shews at a glance the positions of the various buoys and the intended position of the Lightship. I am to ask if it would be possible to place the lightship in a position which would give a direct run-in to the Sitrah anchorage without affecting the direct run-in to the Manama anchorage. In the meantime, may we leave the question of the Lightbuoy in abeyance? J.G.Laithwaite Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. Enclosure.H Draft Paper. / C f/ tfu M s P.Z.7144/34 political Department.

An order for the construction of a Lightship for Bahrain has been placed with Messrs.

I find I have yet to deal with the question of the replacement of the light buoy, which is the subject matter of your letter P.2^.3635/34 of the 31st May and of my reply there to of the 1st June. You kindly made some suggestions that the Company might be able to get a light buoy made by firms in this country. Instructions received from the Company are to replace the borrowed light buoy at the earliest possible moment and it has occurred to the Company to suggest that the Government of India might care to have the light buoy manufactured to their (the Government of India’s] specification, at the cost of the Com pany. It is not known whether the light buoy which has been borrowed is a new one or an old one, but if it is a new one it might be possible to make the further suggestion that expense and trouble could be avoided by the borrov/ed one being handed over to the Company, as its property, upon the new one being com-- 2 - 20th July, 1934. pleted. I must, of course, leave it to you as to whether these suggestions can be taken up with the Government of India, but if you think they can be and you are willing to do so, the Company would be glad if you would forward them to the proper quarter. If the Government of India do not entertain the first proposal, Would it not be advisable for the Company to be supplied with the Government of India’s specifica tion for a buoy suitable to replace the one now in posi tion?

Ballantyne at the I noTa Oil ice on Wednesday. 16th Day 1934 . Mr. Ballantyne asKea lor an interview to discuss arrangements in regaha to lighting ana buoying and the calibration of tanks at Bahrein. 2. As regards lighting and buoyin^ he said that the Company appreciated the great assistance which had been given them by trie Indian autnorities ana aia not wish to press the matter unuuly. But it was most important from their point of view to know with tne minimum of delay the position in regard to the light buoy, which was the key of the present position, and they would be grateful therefore if a further reminder could be sent at their expense. I said tnis would be none &lt;&gt; 5. Calibration, etc . Mr. Ballantyne said that tne Company's reply to our enquiry on this subject haa, he hoped, made the position clear. They were anxious to know as soon as possible where they stood, because it woula be necessary, if there was unlikely to be any hitch, to send out instruments, etc. to Bahrein in the near future for use in connection with the checkin^, of tne measurements of the tanks. I said that the Petroleum Department had haa no very material criticism to make of the arrangements suggested in his letter and that a telegram Tmd been sent to tne Political Resident (repeated to Bahrein) on 15th May that the comments of tne Petroleum Department on the arrangements proposed by the Company would follow by the air mail of 18th May. Mr. Ballantyne said that this information/2 information as to ths action which naa been t&amp;Ken in the matter would he of value to the Company and was all that they wanted to know for the moment. 4 # Mining Lease desiderata . I informed Mr. Ballantyne that we hope a to he in a position to discuss next week the Company's reply on the question of our Inning Lease desiderata. I had not yet received the comments of trie Petroleum Department, hut mignt pernaps mention that one of the most important points on which our requirements were unsatisfied appeared to he that of commercial exploitable quantity. He was aware of the importance attached to this point hy the Sheikn. 5, Mr. Ballantyne said that he thought the Company had gone a long way to meet any reasonable demands on this question in their reply regarding the Sheikh's Mining Lease desiderata and that if they started production without further delay that was all that he could reasonably require. I said that I did not think that that was the case and that, while any remarks I might make must he the regarded as wholly provisional pending receipt of/advice of the petroleum Department, I ooubtea if tne advance represented hy the amended Lease would really meet tne Sheikh's point. It was quite true that tne Sheikh, under the amended Lease would he entitled to a minimum royalty of Pb.30,000 throughout. But M.. Ballantyne would agree that that figure had been granted hy tne Company as consideration for an extension of the prospecting licence and was something quite separate from the payments which the sheikh might expect to receive under tne Mining nease. The original Lease had contemplated a not unimportant increase in minimum royalty payments on the Mining Lease being/being taken out, and the Sheikh, now that the minimum payment during the interim period was fixed at Rs.30,000, might reasonably expect some advance on that figure on the killing Lease coming into operation. The figures which I suggested to him in one of our earlier interviews haa been a minimum annual payment on the basis of, say, Rs.30,000 101 one first two years, Rs.60,000 for the next three years, ana Rs. 100,000 thereafter, Iv:r. Ballantyne said he could not see what justification there was for the making of a substantially higher payment to the Sheikh on the Mining Lease coming into operation. 7 ’ 1 r0 Plied that we understood that the Company were proposing to produce at the rate of 5,000 barrels a aay from June or July of this year. If, in fact, they were to produce on a substantial scale, then, speaking personally, I was quite prepared to agree that the sheikh mi e m, have no very stron 6 claim to a higner minimum rate ox royalty, since the royalties which he would receive consequent on such substantial production would be sufficiently considerable to safeguard his interests. But tne contingency which should not be overlooked (regarding the matter from the point of view of the sheiKh) was the possibility of tne Company, for whatever reason, ceasing to produce on a really substantial scale. (Mr. Ballantyne interjected that there was no risk, so far as he was aware, of the Company using Bahrein as a reserve oil Held). It clearly would be of great importance to the Sheikh to safeguard himself against the risk of this by securing a fairly substantial minimum royalty. If, on the other hand, the Company had no intention of reducing production/proauction, then equally they ran no risk in agreeing to minimm, royalty figures ox the dimensions whicn I had SU^&gt;i3 6 b o6 Q • 3 . Ivir. Ballo-ntyne sa.io. t/ftcLlj it/ wtis 9 o± cours 6 , t/iiQ case tnat if tne bottom fell oui of tne oil market altogether anu it was impossiole for trie Coiiipary to dispose of more than a certain minimum amount of oil, the royalties woulu fall. That equally was a consideration from their point of view in agreeing to any substantial minimum royalty. They might fine, themselves committed to a minimum royalty of a very substantial nature in respect of an oilfield which hau ceasea to pay tuem. 9 . I said that it was just for that reason that it was desirable to safeguard the sheikh’s interests. We had no complaint to make of our dealings with the Company, which had been amicable on both sides, or of the attitude which the Company' had adopted in relation to oil questions. Looking at the matter broadly, it appeared to us that there was not much in it from tne point of view of tne Company. They were already liable for a minimum royalty of Rs .30,000; the maximum royalty wnicn had been suggested to him at an earlier date was Rs.l lakh alter a number of years. The difference was at the maximum Hs.70,000, say £5,000. That, for a company of the standing of the Bylire in Petroleum Company, was not a very substantial risk. On the other hand, for someone like the Sheikh of Bahrein it did present a quite substantial safeguard. 10. Mr. Ballantyne replied that the Company must consider its own interests and that the more he saw of this particular question the more he was impressed by the way in which thousands mounted up. At the same time he recognised the force of the argument. He also recognised that/that anything that was now saia to him was purely provisional in character, hut if on receipt of the advice of the expert Department we raised the point on the lines on which it had just been pressed on him, clearly the Company would have to consider it further. He wished to emphasise, however, that the Lease did impose a definite burden on the Company. Ihe rate of royalty was very high; one point considered in connection with the Mining Lease desiderata had been whether the Company should not demand a revision downwards in the rate of the royalty after a period of, say, 5 years, or if circumstances changed. I said that we were advised that the rate of royalty, though generous, was by no means excessive and that it would be unwise to hold out hope to him of the probability of any revision. 11* It was agreed that the matter should be discussed further on receipt of the advice of the Petroleum Department.

Ex tracted entirely, the letter reads thus:- 'Mr. Deacon*s work is progressing so well that he now thinks he will be able to release the ^El Segundo n between June 10th and 15th. In order to do this, it will be necessary for 20 men (including Deacon and his EngineersJ to live in our Camp for about 30 aays. One of these men will be Captain Nelson and four of the others are already at our Camp. I have approached Captain Loch on this sub ject aid he sees no objection to the men living here providing they have the proper visas. All of them have passports and can secure visas from Colonel Loch. Altho our Camp will be a little crowded and we will have to have two sittings for meals, we have no objection whatever to Deacon and his men staying here. In fact, I rather favor it as the men will have an opportunity of going home through Europe as a reward for the good job they have done in the short time they will have been here. n I believe there have been no complaints about these men and it is hoped that with the Political Agent in agreement. as apparently he is from Mr. Skinner*s letter, there will be no COPY SENT tY /Aid MAU. n/rfw9th May, 1934 objection to the men living ashore for the short time con templated.

On this paper the Hydrographer has pointed out that the greatest rise of the tide above datum is probably about 8i ft. and that in order to make reasonably sure that the pipe is always a foot above water he thinks the underside of the pipe line should be 10 ft. above datum. He suggests that you might like to communicate this information to the company since there is a note on the Admiralty charts giving the mean spring rise as 6| ft. above datum, which though correct might be misunderstood. The maximum rise is of course appreciably more than the mean rise. , I am sending copies of this letter to Starling and Warner. J.G.

An iniornidl meeting took place at the Admiralty on 8th January aw which there were present the Kydrographer, Mr. Seal, Mr. Laithwaite, and, from the Bahrein petroleum Company,.' C. W. Deacon, Engineer in charge of the submarine line, Mr. E.J. Nelson, nis assistant, and Captain Nelson, who will he in charge of the harbour installation. 2. The representatives of the Bahrein Petroleum Company first discussed with the Hydrographer the technical aspects of the work which they propose to do in connection with the submarine line, and examined the charts which are being prepared for the Company. 3. A brief discussion followed on conditions in Bahrein, it being impressed on the Company’s representatives that it was essential that they should keep in close touch with the political authorities and be gulden by them in their general conduct. The Company’s representatives expressed their anxiety to cooperate to the full with the local authorities ana with Mr. Hamilton remarking that if only for selfish reasons it was to their interest to do so. He added that the importance of leaving notning undone to avoid any incident or difficulty had been impressed by the Company on the personnel who were now being sent out. 4. • The Company’s representatives stated that Mr* Deacon, Mr. Nelson and Captain Nelson would leave for Bahrein by air next week, arriving there about the 17th January/January. The Bahrein about present the wo i* El segunao' and its crew woula arrive in 1st Larch. 3o far as coula he judged at rk was likely to take about 3 months, hut In. Deacon, in the interests of leaving a wide margin, was reluctant to commit himself to its completion before July. From the Company's point of view, however, it was desirable to finish as quickly as possible, first, because of the onset of the hot weather; secondly, because the retention of the 'El segundo' immobilised her ana also involved considerable expenditure on the wages of her crew. It appeared that the crew plus the expert party would number about 45. Arrangements would be made that all save possibly two or three should live on board. As regaras arrangements for shore leave, etc., there woula be no difficulty about complying with any desires which might be expressed by the local authorities 5. Mr. Ballantyne mentioned that it had now been decided that he should not go out to Bahrein with the submarine party, pressure of work matting this impossible. He added that it was probable that Captain Nelson would remain on in order to look after the harbour installation after the main party haa left. He rather contemplated that in aue course he would be provided with an assistant,who would be an Englishman ana who would unaerstudy him with a view to ultimately replacing him. 6. Mr. Hamilton asked the present position as regards the enquiries which had been made of the Government of India as to their willingness to arrange for lighting and buoying ana was informed that a reminder had been sent asking the Government of India to indicate whether they were prepared, in principle to agree to assume/assume responsibility. He stated that if they were not prepared to ao so for any reason the Company would be reaay to make arrangements, but that in that event, in pursuance of their policy of cooperation, they would ask us to indicate what types, etc. of buoy should be lain down, so that there snoula be complete conformity between any arrangements made by them and the general arrangements of the Government of India in the Gulf. 7.

Consequent on iniorrnal discussion with the interested aepartisents in the light of the Naval Cormiander -in-Chief' s telegram No. 920 of 23ra December and of a telephone conversation with Mr. Ballantyne, I asked him to come to see me to-day to discuss the situation which had arisen in connection with the despatch of a party of 45 Americans for the purpose of laying the submarine line. 2 . I said on his arrival that, as I haa already explained by telephone, had we known that so large a party of foreigners was contemplated and haa we thought that the expert party to which he had referred meant more than five or six people, we should certainly have pressed, under the guarantee given by the Company at the time of the assignment, that the work should be done by British personnel, such personnel were available and we nad in fact made airangements to put me expert who haa advised the A.P.O.C. in similar cases in touch with them. In all the circumstances, however, ana as matters had advanced so far, we did not propose to interfere with the arrangements that had been made, but I was asked to emphasise that the suaden arrival of a large party of foreigners in a small Arab state of this type might well ce very embarrassing; that it was most important that the Americans should pay uue deference to any advice they might receive from the local political authorities and should walk extremely carefully; that the more of them who lived on board the 'El segundo* the better. He would2 . not misunderstand it if one warned him that in the event of troutie it would probably be necessary to request tne removal of the offending party. Mr. Ballantyne interrupted to say that the Company had consistently been most anxious to work harmoniously in the Gulf and had taken special pains about the selection of personnel. He could assure me that any man of the party who misbehaved would be removed long before any official protest could be made. 3. I went on to say tnat this was possibly a delicate subject but that we felt we had reason to complain of a recent failure of liaison. There seemed to be an increasing tendency for the Company to deal direct with Bahrein without keeping Lcnaon fully informed. As Mr. Ballantyne was aware, four departments here were closely concerned with the working of this concession, and it was most important tnat we should be kept in touch direct with all developments in connection with it. In recent cases neither In. Ballantyne nor the India Office had haa information of the Company's intentions, embarrassing situation might arise unless liaison was improved. If he thought it desirable he was at full liberty to inform the Company that we had protested officially and were anxious that the situation should be improved, 4* Mr. Ballantyne saia that as regards the expert submarine party the Company were not to be taken as accepting our proposition that they could have been/'been reQuiract to employ British personnel, cut ha would say quite irankly tnat ha iully roalisau Ciia possiule difficulties and apprehensions which the arrival 01 a large party of foreigners for a period of two or three months might give rise to. He appreciated the i act that we dia not wish to press our objection to the despatch of the party. 'Ye could rely on every precaution Doing taken to ensure that no difficulties were caused locally and the points which I had mentioned to him would be fully borne in mind. 5 . On the question of liaison, he and Mr .Hamilton entirely agreed that arrangements haa been unsatisfactory lately. They had sent in a protest in very strong terms to the Company. Their position would, indeed, he made impossible unless they were kept in closer touch with what was going on. What haa caused particular annoy since to them was that they had not been informed s.t the time of the Company’s arrangements in connection with production ana shipment (I understood this to be the arrangement for shipping 5,000 barrels a day by 1st July 1934, reported in the Political Resident's telegram of 12th December, No.1124, P.Z.8020/33). He tnought that as a result of the protest there would be no difficulty in future. Part of the trouble arose from the fact that the Engineering Department in California had been dealing with tnat certain of the technical aspects ana/it had been necessary to hustle at the last moment, because It was regarded as important to get preparatory work such as the laying of the submarine line out of the way before the beginning of the hot weather. For part of tne trouble also Mr. Skinner was responsible. He was a technician ana not a representative ana while his local relations appeared tous excellent, iie ciiu not n pp do. * go i'sn 11 os on vviocit points it was necessary to Keep Lonaon in close touch with what was going on. That, too, he thought would he remedied, in future. (5 # Mr. bail an ty n s pi oceecicd tii^vu, c^pai ^ x i. o a lack Oj. appreciation Ox wnau was aiio. vaiat- was not important from the Lonaon point or view, Mr. Skinner was inclined to write abrupt and unsatisfactory letters. Thus, the Sheikh having recently written to make an enquiry as to the Company’s intentions in regard to refining, Mr. skinner hau replieu tnat the Company haa no present intention of refining locally ana that they were under no obligation so to do. That : i cl ki not the type of letter to write. 7. i said that we had seen trie letter ana that it had been regarded as unsatisfactory. We should oe writing to him on the subject in tne immediate future. 8 . Mr. Baliantyne saio. uiiao tn^ fact &lt;vab txiat it was far too early to talk ox detailed re lining arrangements. The Company had not yet worked out its marketing or sale arrangements, ana hie first thing to do was oQ lino ouw now muon oil oiicnc# xiaci^y g-^ oe ana on what scale arrangements ought to be made and what difficulties there might be in connection with them. If the sheikh of Bahrein merely wanted a small local refinery to supply his own needs ana those or his population, there would probably be no aixiiculty aoout it* Til ere was to be a capping plant a g n ah re in. 9 . i saia that what the Sheikh wanted was that the oil won by the Company should be refined locally, thus providing employment for his subjects and bringing money, in the shape of wages, into Bahrein. It was not/® ' HE not merely a question of local requirements. Mr. Ballantyne said that until matters proceeded further it was clearly impossible for the Company to commit themselves as regards refining arrangements for the reasons which ha had explained. I said that presumably it was in principle desirable to refine locally on commercial grounds, since local refining would save the cost and difficulty of transporting crude oil for considerable distances. Mr. Ballantyne agreed. He said that tae nearest refineries of the Company (? The Standard Oil) appeared to be in Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. I said that was half-way round the world. He enquired whether the A.P.O.C. refined locally in the Gulf. I said 'Yes, at Abadan'. This appeared to strike him ana he asked if we could get a copy of the A.P.C.C. concession, which he understood was a public document, since it might be of considerable assistance to the Company in formulating their further plans. I promised to do tills. 10. In conclusion, I said tnat I thought it would be a good thing if we had a talk with Mr. Deacon, the leader of the submarine line party, before he went out ana further impressed on him the considerations to which Mr. Ballantyne‘s attention had been drawn. Mr. Ballantyne agreed. He added that the suggestion haa been made that he should himself go out to Bahrein with the party to see local conditions and he thought that he would now ao this. He would probably be away from London not more tnan three weeks in all. It would be possible to say a good deal orally to Mr.Skinner which he could not write, ana such a visit would, he thought make it still more unlikely than before that there would be any repetition of the lack of liaison andJ.G.

Dear hr. Laithwaite, I understand from you that you have received from Mr. E. A. Seal of the Admiralty, a copy of his letter addressed to me under date the 20th instant and reference M.03535/33. I have also heard this morning from the Company to the effect that the largest ship used would he one whose carrying capacity is 130,0^0 barrels of oil and which would have a draft of 32 feet. As it transpired at our discussion at the Admiralty on Tuesday last, that the proposed channel is, at its shallowest part, not less than 39 feet deep, a further survey of the channel does not appear to be necessary. I am, however, instructed to take advantage of your kind offer to enquire of the Government of India if that Government, on behalf of the Company and at its cost, would undertake the work of furnishing, in stalling and maintaining buoys as under:--2- 21st December, 1933. 26° 31 ’ N) Light Float or Light Buoy.

It may be that the Government of India have at their disposal already and by way of reserve, buoys which could be utilised for the Company’s purposes. If this were so, and it would mean a saving of time, the Company would like to suggest that such buoys should be utilised and re placed, the cost of replacement being reckoned as the cost of the supply of buoys. It would be a convenience to the Company to know (a) the approximate cost of the buoys (b) the approximate cost of laying the buoys (c) the yearly cost of maintenance of the buoys, including the light and (d) when the work-3- 21st December, 1933. could be commenced and completed. I understand that the work of laying the submarine line with its sea terminal and the anchorage for ships using the terminal, will be undertaken under the supervision of the Special Kngineering party placed at the disposal of the Com pany by the Standard Oil Company of California. This party has apparently an extensive knowledge of this kind of work. These Engineers or some of them will, I understand, arrive in London on the 4th January next en route for Bahrein. It may be that by then matters will have advanced sufficiently to justify another '’round-table” talk, such as we had on Tuesday, with the Engineering party joining in. I have written to hr. Seal an acknowledgment of his letter and thanking him for the information he has given me . J.G.Laithwaite Esq., India Office, &gt;/hitehall, S.W.&gt;• A preliminary Meeting was held in the Hydrographer 1 s Room on Monday, December 18th, between representatives of the Admiralty and the India Office to discuss v/hat should be said to the representatives of the Bahrein Petroleum Company concerning the possibility of Admiralty or Government co-operation in making arrangements for marking a channel and laying buoys etc* at Bahrein. It was generally agreed that as the available information suggested that the Company intended to press on with the necessary arrangements in any event, and as it was in principle most desirable to give no excuse for the introduction in the Gulf of the U.S.A* Marine Survey (who might v/ell welcome such an opportunity), or for anything which might interfere with the effective general control of lighting and buoying arrangements at present exercised in that area by H.M* Government and the Government of India, it would be well to give such assistance as we could to the Company without endeavouring to bargain over it, and to aim at securing that any work done was done under our auspices, and did not conflict with our interests or with existing arrangements*3» *. * * SSSSIESISSZESS 1933 A meeting was held in the Hydrographer 1 s room at the Admiralty on Tuesday, December 19th, 1933, at 3*30 p.m. to discuss with representatives of the Bahrein Petroleum Company the possibility of Admiralty or government co-operation in making arrangements for marking a channel and laying 5^ buoys, etc., in order to enable the Company’s tankers to reach the end of the submarine pipe line which will come to the surface approximately three miles east of Sitra Island. There were present s- Captain J.A. Edgell, R.N. (Hydrographer ) in the Chair). ) Representing Captain J.l. Clayton, R.N., ) (Director of Navigation). ) the Commander Dickson, R.N.(Plans Division) ) Mr. E.A. Seal (M. Branch). ) Admiralty Mr. R.R. Powe*l (M. Branch) ) Mr. J.O. Laithwaite (Representing the India Office). Mr. Ballantyne ) Representing the Bahrein Mr. Hamilton ) Petroleum Con^any. 2. The Hydrographer in opening the meeting suggested that the first question to be discussed should be that of the buoys required and how they should be laid. Mr. Hamilton said that he and Mr. Ballantyne were both ignorant of technical details; all they knew was that the Company intended to lay a submarine pipe line coming to the surface three miles east of Sitra Island and that a channel approximately 30 miles long and 4 miles wide would have to be marked in order to enable large tankers of, say, 15 - 20,000 tons which would draw between 30 and 35 f to reach the end of the pipe line. The company intended to erect on Sitra Island two tanks each of a capacity of 135,000 barrels, (say 20,000 tons), which would be about 60 feet high and 147 feet in diameter. There would also be a Diesel-engine pumping plant.■■■PM Y-&gt;, —«&gt; 3. After some discussion it was agreed that the best arrangement would be that the Government of India, who were the lighting and buoying authorities in the Persian Gulf,should be asked if they saw no objection to lay and maintain the buoys necessary for the Company’s purpose. It was understood that the Company would be prepared to reimburse the Government of India for the expenditure incurred. The buoys wwribdfbe laid by the NSARCHUS and, in addition to payment of the first costs of providing and laying the buoys, which would trecome tire - propdfty uf GuvernaentIndia&gt; compounded annual payment for maintenance might be arranged between the Company and the Government of India* It was e^lained that general arrangements for lighting and buoying in the Gulf were under Government control. It would therefore be desirable not only that buoys should be the same make as those already employed by the lighting and buoying authority, but that any fresh buoys laid should be under the control of that authority and laid and maintained so as not to interfere with its general arrangements. tfr. Hamilton emphasised that the company regarded the matter as one of great urgency and wished to expedite it as much as possible and said that evidently the best policy to adopt was one of full co-operation between the Company and the Government of India. In reply to an enquiry as to details of the buoys necessary and their cost he was informed that three ordinary buoys and a light buoy would be necessary to mark the channel properly and that a light buoy would possibly cost approximately £600 and an ordinary buoy approximately £260. Possibly an arrangement might be made whereby the Government.••••. | r &gt; M 1 ” - - —Ghovemxaent of India would issue buoys from thetlf own reserre stocks, in order to avoid delay, provided arrangements could be made to send out buoys from this country at once to replace them. The cost of maintenance of an ordinary buoy might at a very rough guess work out at approximately £10 a year, but this would be for t he Government of India to determine. In addition to the buoys required for the channel comprehensive moorings would be necessary for the vessels actually loading oil and a float line to which the flexible end of the pipe/would be secured. Advice on the type of float seemed to be outside the Admiralty’s province and it was agreed that Mr. Laithwaite should make enquiries of the Colonial Office concerning the moorings and float which had recently been laid down at Haifa with a view to ascertaining the best firm to do the work for the Bahrein Petroleum Company. 4. Consideration was then given to the question whether further survey of the channel was necessary before it could definitely be said that tankers could enter there safely. - The Hydrographer stated that although incomplete a considerable amount of hitherto unpublished survey work had been done in the neighbourhood of Bahrein, which would ultimately justify the publication of a chart of the neighbourhood on a much larger scale than the existing charts. In order to assist the Company, he was willing to prepare a chart of the area concerned at once; it would be available in about four months time and would of course be put on sale like any other Admiralty chart. A small amount of additional survey work would be required, which could be carriedriwmrm carried out Dy H.M.S. ORMONDE, but should not take more than ten days to complete and would not be chargeable to tue company* In the meantime the ship which was to lay the pipe line could navigate in safety by making use of photographic reproductions of portions of existing charts which could be made for the Company at a cost of about £20. It was agreed that details of what charts were necessary should be settled at a further meeting between the Hydrographer and Mr* Hamilton at noon on Yednesday, December 20th. Mr* A*aithwaite said that he was anxious to be sure that the pipe line which the Company were to lay would not interfere with the pearl banks at Bahrein as there was a possibility that any oil waste which might escape might be detrimental to the pearl fisheries. Mr. Hamilton explained that no oil would be left in the pipe after loading a tanker as it would be flushed through with water so that there was no danger of this happening. It subsequently appeared that the Bahrein Pearl Banks were probably not in the area where the pipe line would be laid but it was agreed that the Company should cable to Bahrein to make sure that no interference would take place and to reassure the Government of Bahrein that their interests were being kept under consideration. ^^ finally settled that the India Office should cable to the Government of India asking whether they would be willing to co-operate in the laying of the buoys and also for an approximate estimate of cost of laying and maintenance. In the meantime Mr. Seal would let Mr. Ballantyne know the technical details of the buoying arrangements suggested and Mr. Ballantyne would then write V, toA to Mr. Laithwaite asking for the work to be put in hand as soon as possible provided the Government of India agreed to undertake it. In reply to a question from Mr. Ballantyne Mr. Laithwaite said that speaking under oorrection he did not think that a formal agreement between the Company and the Government of India on the subject would be necessary and that it might be possible to settle everything by an exchange of letters.' t THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LimSeS)^ 19, Moorgate, London, E.C.2. 20th Docei^toer 1933. l^&gt;nr Sir, Referring to Mr. L.

The Company is, I think, looking forward to re ceiving some guidance from the Admiralty not only in approaching the work hut in carrying it on, completing it and subsequently maintaining it. It seems to me that what will be done will emerge as a result of discussions rather than from a plan worked out in detail beforehand by San Francisco. Consistent with its policy to make the most of its opportunities for developing and rendering productive what ever there may be in the shape of an oil-field in Bahrein, the Company is anxious to get ahead with this work of chart ing and buoying v/ith the utmost expedition. Therefore, I am all the more grateful to you, on the Company’s behalf, for having so quickly arranged a meeting for the Company’s Representatives at the Admiralty. Knclosure. J.l.Laithwaite Esq.

According to the present survey data available, theCompany understands that it will be necessary or advisable to mark a channel - possibly for a distance oi some thiroy miles - to enable tankers and other vessels engaged in or in connection with the Company’s activities to approach safely to within three miles of Sitra Island for the purposes of anchoring and being loaded with oil, etc. etc. It will probably be required to make a survey of the channel, and to mark it properly witn buoys and other markers. The Company seeks the aid of H.M.Government, insofar as the same can be given, in determining the manner of accomplishing this work, i.e. the materials required, the ships and labour that have to be em ployed, and the date of commencement of operations and the period of time during which operations can proceed, and the eocimated cost of the operations, and on all matters Incident al to the foregoing.FILE COPY INDIA OFFICE* P.Z.7929/33. CONFIDENTIAL . 33. Mr. Bullantyne had asked for an interview to discuss first the Company’s desiderata in respect oi the charting and buoying of tiie channel in connection with their plans for snipping oil through a submarine line and secondly the establishment of radio-telephone transmitters. As regards the first of these questions (on which compare paragraph 6 of the memorandum of an interview on the 4th December, P.Z.7662/33) he said that a rather obscure telegram nad been received from Mr. Skinner, which had left him in some doubt as to what exactly was involved. Mr. Skinner had, however, intimated that the matter had been taken up with the Political Agent on the 18th November and was, he assumed, now under reference to the India Office, as no reply had yet been received. I read mr. Ballantyne Mr. Skinner’s letter of the 18th November to Colonel Loch (P.Z.7760/33) and repeated what I had said at our meeting of 4th December, viz. that the Admiralty were not yet in a position to tell us to what extent they could assist, but that it was possible that they might be able to produce an advance copy of a chart which would be of service, the probable cost of which would be in the neighbourhood of £10; that as regards the actual buoying of channels I was myself disposed to think that the simplest course would be that the matter should be discussed on the ORMONDE’S next visit to Bahrein between the Political Agent, Mr. Skinner, and the Captain of the ORMONDE. I could not, of course, give any COPY SENT BY AIR MAIL COPY SENT BY AID MAIL indication/2 . indication of what the cost to the Company of the work which they required done would he likely to he. Mr.Ballantyne saia he would inform Mr.Skinner hy letter of the present position in regard to the request he had put forward. 3. Employment hy Company of radio-telephone transmitters* (please see on this the telegram from the political Agent, Bahrein to the Political Resident, repeated to the Secretary of state. No.566, of 6th December, 'which explains what the Company had in view and the Sheikh’s reaction to their request). Mr. Ballantyne said that from a telegram from Mr.Skinner he understood that the conditions on which the installation oi these transmitters could oe permitted had heen discussed locally, that the Sheikh was prepared to agree subject to certain safeguards for existing wireless installations, and that tne question had heen referred urgently to the India Office. As the telegram of 6th December stated that the Sheikh’s views had already heen communicated to Mr.skinner I gave its substance to Mr.Ballantyne, and explained in the first place, in reply to an enquiry hy him, that the Imperial and International Communications Company had a separate wireless establishment irom Imperial Airways, ana that it would he necessary to avoid interference with either; secondly that the Sheikh had stipulated that if wireless telephones were allowed at this stage to trie Company they should not he used for transmission to stations outside Bahrein. Mr.Ballantyne said that as he understood the position trie Company, who appeared, so far as he could judge, (though he was not to he taken as making any statement as to their intentions and hope d that Mr. skinner had equally taken care to avoid committing himself in any way regarding them) to he pressing on with plans for marketing oil, were anxious to instal these telephones for purposes of communication between shore and vessel in connection 1irstly with the charting of channels referred to in paragraph 2 above, and secondly with the arrangements lor the loading ana shipping of oil. He was not quitesure, however, that they might not wish to use the telephones, when installed, ior transmissions to stations or ships outside the territory of Bahrein. I said it appeared important to clear up this point, as our view would, I thought, he quite definitely that for any purposes other than for office and local purposes within Bahrein connected with the proauction etc. of oil, uhe Company should use the ordinary facilities provided sy the Communications Company. Mr. Ballantyne saia he appreciated the point ana would mention it to San Francisco. 4* He enquired as to the best method of dealing with the question of avoiding interference with the wireless installations of Airways and the Communications Company. I said that I thought we should he willing to write to ooth Companies explaining the position to them ana asking them to assist the Bahrein Petroleum Company in the matter. Mr. Ballantyne expressed appreciation. 7th December 1S33. J • G • juAI THWAI if •**&amp;S£S firt M jf * CONFIDENTIAL . INDIA OFFICE.

Mr. B^llantyne came to see me tnis morning with reference to India Office letter of 23rd November, P.Z.7187/33, about the interpretation of Clause V of the First Schedule to the Bahrein Oil Concession of 2nd December 1925. 2. He said that he had considered that letter in the light of the full correspondence between tne Chie:; Local Representative and the local authorities of wnich he had now received copies from Bahrein. He had also had some informal discussion with Major Holmes as to what exactly had been intended at tne time when the concession had been negotiated. Major Holmes had strongly reaffirmed tne interpretation which he had already placed upon the relevant clause in his correspondence with tne Financial Aaviser to the Bahrein Government and the Company thought that there was something to be said for this interpretation ana that the Chief Local Representative had adopted a not unreasonable line. He added that his general feeling was that tne matter was one of relatively small importance with which it snoula not have been necessary to trouble H.M.G., and secondly that it was desirable to reach some friendly settlement of it. It might well be that this could more easily be done on the spot. 3. I said that we had taken pains before raising the matter with the Company to assure ourselves that there was nothing on record to show the intentions of the two parties at the time when the concession was entered into and that the clause must therefore be interpreted as it stood. In our view, however, while there might have been some genuine misunderstanding/I 0 . ./ misunderstanding on doth sides, the position was quite clear. The terms ’’material, apparatus and machinery H were intended to cover technical equipment required by the Company for the purposes of its field work; the term ”office requirements‘ , was intended to cover secretarial material, such as typewriters, office tables ana aesks, etc., required for the equipping of their secretarial offices; the phrase 'not including trie personal requirements of employees' was intended to make it clear that personal equipment for employees, such as beds, mirrors and household furniture generally, would be liable to pay such duty as was in force from time to time and was specifically excluded from the exemption granted to 'office requirements' and 'material, apparatus and machinery'. If a. difference of opinion on the matter persisted, it would, of course, be open to the Sheikh to take the matter to arbitration; but as the point was relatively such a small one, it seemed preferable to avoid th i s ii po s s i o 1 e. 4. Mr. Bailantyne saia that he agreed as to the desirability of settling a relatively snail point in a friendly way. It was a great pity that it had ever been necessary to raise it. Tne Company’s attitude in the natter was, of course, that it had been intended at the time when this concession was entered into to secure exemption from customs duties for all the material necessary for the work carried out by the Company, and while this might not include phonographs he thought it was reasonable to contend that it covered furniture imported by the Company at its own cost to equip the huts, etc. which it put up for the Company in Bahrein. He suggested, however, that the best method of dealing with the question would be that, if Can Francisco agreed, it should be furtner discussed on the spot between Mr.Skinner, Colonel/A ■ n' r Colonel Loch and Ivlr• Belgrave, with a view to a friendly understanding being reached as to the precise ^ interpretation to be placed in practice on this phrase in the Second ana Ihird Schedules of the Concession of 1925* The best thing would probably be an understanding embodying an agreement as to the articles which the Company coula be allowea to import free of duty. In reply to a question he added that there was no question that a motorcar imported oy an employee for his private use, as distinct from one imported by the Company for the official purposes of its work, would, of course, be liable to duty. ^ I said we hau no objection to further discussions in Bahrein, but we would, of course, make it clear before such discussions to the Bahrein Government that in our view their legal position in this matter was as set out in paragraph 3 above am that they should take their stand in any discussions on that interpretation of the terms of the concession. Mr. Ballantyne said he would consult San Francisco by nail am communicate further with me before any instructions were sent to Bahrein. 6 * Buoying, etc, of channel in connection with Bgiitein Petroleum Company^ plans for shinning oil through a., submarine line. I referred to Mr* Skinner’s demi- official letter of 18th November 1933 to the Political Agent, Bahrein, of which copies were received by us under tile Political Aesiaent’s express letter No.C. 172 of 1933. Mi. ballantyne said he had had no previous intimation that a request of this nature had been maae by Mr. Skinner, and would make enquiry of him regarding it. I said that so far as we were concerned we had consulted the Admiralty, who were not yet in a position to tell us to what extent they could/could assist, but who, I gathered, thought it possible that they might be aole to produce an advance copy oi a chart which would be of service to the Company. If so, be that the simplest course would be tnat when the Captain of H.M.s. ’’Ormonde”, which was, I understood, again in the ±croicui LrUxl, next called at cahrein, ne, tne Political agent and Mr. skinner should discuss the matter with a view to clearing the air. 7 • Appointment of a permanent Chief i.ocrI rcepresentative . I said that the Sheikh had now on two occasions raised the question of Mr. Skinner's position and had enquired for how long ne was to act and what the intentions of the Company in the matter were. We had not so) far sent him a reply to his letters. Mr. Ballantyne said that the Company had noticed in correspondence of which copies had been sent by Mr. skinner that a request of this nature had been made by the sheikh. I said that the Company would no doubt put forward proposals in due course for our consideration. He had, however, mentioned privately and unofficially to me at an earlier stage the possibility that they might desire to suggest the name of Mr'. BeIgrave as Mr. skinner's successor. Speaking equally privately ana unofficially I thought it well to give him a warning that difficulty might arise over this. We had the highest opinion of Mr*. Belgrave, who had done excellent work in Bahrein. But there seemed obvious objections to his Onnhl inp- t.h^ nXet. nr nhi^r r + j~\ ■■■■ to continue to serve as Financial Aaviser, Bahrein, and that he fully appreciated the objections to the doubling of ohd posts, as, he felt sure, would the Oornpany also* He wished, however, to make clear tnat the hint which he had given me at an earlier stage aia not correspond to any i ixed intention on the part of the Company. But a suggestion had been put forward - he did not say by whom Z? hlajor Holmes7 - that Mr. Belgrave should be appointed to tnis post, and he (Mr. Ballantyne) and the Company, who had not been aware how complete our information in the matter was, had been anxious to emphasise that this was a matter which must be considered entirely separately from the extension of the prospecting licence. He would, however, now communicate with the Company again ana press them for an early intimation of their wishes in regard to the appointment of a permanent Chief ijocai Representative. 4th December 1933.

Dear Laithwaite, Your letter of the 23rd April and India Office official letter No.P.Z.2628/34 of the 20th April about lighting and buoying at Bahrein. The light buoy required by the company will need to be large and I understand that the Admiralty have none of sufficient size available and that those they have would have to be reconditioned before they were fit for service. Captain Edgell has suggested that there might be a buoy of the right size available at Basrah as the Port Trust have several light buoys which they look after, and he thinks that it might be worth while to consult Colonel Ward. The Admiralty do not know whether the NEARCHUS carries a spare. The experts here tell me that the **OPY S SENT BY AIK I\ MAIL Laithwaite, Esq. Gas /V/ ^ Gas Accumulator Company, Beacon ?/orks , Brentford, Middlesex, could probably produce a buoy to fit the company’s purpose very quickly. Another possibility is that Trinity House might have a spare buoy of suitable size; but the quickest solution would of course be that one should be sent from Basrah. Yours sincerely,INDIA OFFICE, YHITSHALL, 3. V. 1. ^3ra April 1954. Ivy dear Powell f You will have had under our printed letter No. P.£.^6&lt;i8/34 ol aOth April a copy of Ballantyne’s letter to me of 19th April on the question of lighting and huoying etc. at Bahrein. 30uld you be so klnu as to let me Know as soon as possible the views of the Admiralty on the point he raises as regards the loan of the light buoy? we shall have to ask tae Government of India to confirm that maintenance covers raising, chipping and re-painting the buoys ana also ascertain from them whether the work of mooring can be fitted in with the regular schedule of the Light Tender. Yours sincerely, J-G. LAITHWAITE. R.H. Powell, Ksq., Admiralty, J. .. 1. —INDEXED The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited. _ f%? ^6, /•*&gt; 19 Moorgate, London. E.C.2 19th April, 1934. I Dear Air, Laithwaite, l.. Charting and Buoying I refer to my talk with you on Tuesday last the 17th instant and to the letter of the Government of India P.2.1778/34 (F.17-N/33) of the 6th March, 1934. Z The Company is of the opinion that the three second-hand second-class conical shape dumb Buoys, including Moorings, referred to in paragraph 4 of the said letter of the Government of India, would be suitable for the purposes of the Company, and I am to ask that these should be supplied from Basrah. 3 It is understood from paragraph 7 of the said letter (last sentence) that the work could be commenced without delay. \ There is, however, the question of the Light Buoy, which seems to be the key of the situation, and which does not appear to be available from reserve (paragraph 3 of the said letter). It is suggested by the Company that it might be possi ble for the Admiralty to lend the Company a Light Buoy during the time the Company takes to procure a Light Buoy of its own. Perhaps the Tender u Nearchus u has one which it could let the Company have for a time? OOPY SI jPY sent BY AIR MAO. OOPY SENT BY AIR MAIL.- 2 - 19th April, 1934. Would you be good enough to have an enquiry made of the Admiralty, and let me know? ^ &gt; I am instructed that the Company is agreeable to the annual cost of maintaining four Buoys (including cost for Light Buoy) at £280 per annum. It is assumed that maintenance in cludes raising, chipping and re-painting the Buoys (see para graph 6 of said letter). 7^ With regard to mooring the Buoys, I do not know whether it can be arranged to have the work of mooring fitted in with the regular schedule of the Light Tender - this point is referred to in paragraph 5 of said letter. The Company is naturally anxious to get all the work completed as soon as possible now so perhaps you could also find out something about this for our guidance? J.G.Laithwaite Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.'J'- . lighting and Buoying Mr.Ballantyne had now received instructions from the Company and a letter would follow. They were of opinion that the three secondhand second class d«nb buoys referred to in paragraph 4 of the government of India's express letter of 6th March, F. 17 -K/ 33 (copies circulated under P.Z.1778/34 of 20th March) would meet the Company's needs. The real difficulty was the provision of the light buoy. The Government of India had indicated in the letter in question that they had no light buoy or light float available. They had also emphasised that the completion of the whole scheme would depend on the date of the fixing of the light buoy. Could we assist in any way ? I sa id that if he would raise the matter in writing I would consult the Admiralty and see if they could help. Mr.Ballantyne expressed appreciation and added that no difficulty would arise on the expenditure as estimated in the Government of India's c anmunications.\ 51. :3AILi ,IH WEdC&amp;XM COUPaICY -ulMITZD.
