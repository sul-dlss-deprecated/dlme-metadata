The correspondence is mostly between Ibn Sa'ud, Sheikh Ahmad al-Jabir al-Sabah of Kuwait, the High Commissioner of Iraq, the Political Residency in Bushire, the Political Agencies in Bahrain and Kuwait, the Colonial Office, Foreign Office, and India Office, all in London, and the Government of India in Bengal.Two main subjects are discussed in the correspondence. The first is the dispute over customs duties between Ibn Sa'ud and the ruler of Kuwait, including the nature of the problem and British attempts to solve it. The second is the Nationality Certificates issued to Najdi subjects in Kuwait, by Ibn Sa'ud. The latter half of the file also contains correspondence and several lengthy memorandums regarding the tribes of the region, especially those of the Ikhwan, and recent movements and hostilities along the Kuwait, Iraq, and Transjordan borders with Najd.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ikhwan, military and religious brotherhood</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Hakim of Kuwait Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Tribes</topic></subject><subject><topic>Travel documents</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000216#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000216#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
