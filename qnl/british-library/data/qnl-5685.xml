These papers have come to me with the ex- haustive memoranda of the Departmental Officer and the Members of the Political Committee. It is quite unnecessary that I should add to this voluminous collection any recapitulation of the origin and causes of the difficulties in which we are involved. These causes are set forth in full detail in the papers adverted to; the question is, what is now to be done ? 1. As to maintaining the arrangement made by Lord Canning’s Government, or through its intercession, regarding the payment of a subsidy of 40,000 dollars to Muscat by Zanzibar. 2. The adjustment of the future relations be tween Zanzibar and Muscat, and Muscat and Persia. 3. The authority to which, in future, the Officers connected with these States or territories shall be subject. 4. The authority to which is to be entrusted the control of the Persian Gulf, and the means by which such control is to be effected. The first appears to me,—and I somewhat regret the fact,—no longer an open question. The Go vernment of India has decided, and the Secretary of State has approved the decision, to recognize Syud Salim as the hereditary successor of his father, Syud Thoweynee, and the de facto ruler of Muscat, without reference to the atrocious and unnatural deed of blood by which, unquestionably, he obtained his position. The Chiefs and his other subjects are said to have accepted him, and the Government of India has acknowledged him ; this . being the case, we must regard him, I fear, as entitled to all the rights and immunities of his murdered predecessor. We cannot now question the act which has been done by the Government of India, and approved by us. I cannot, however, but think that we should have stood higher in the estimation of the Chiefs of Oman, if we had hesi tated to recognize the succession of the parricide, as a matter of course, and permitted Syud Majid to make some other arrangement, with our approval, for Muscat. For the second point, I think we might suggest to the Government of India, to give full authority to the Governor in (Council at Bombay, to readjust the future relations between Zanzibar and Muscat, and Muscat and Persia, subject to the confirmation of the Home Government. For the third, I am disposed to think that, point No. 2 having been settled, the control of the future 9638 e.Q delations of these States should rest with the Foreign Office, to whom the Officers concerned should he subject, so long as the Persian embassy is with the Foreign Office. But, in reference to the fourth point, 1 am ol opinion that the Persian Embassy itself, in all affairs connected with Persia and the Gulf and the adjoining States, would be more advantageously placed under the India Office, and that there should be a separate small maritime service, as suggested bv the Government of India and Sir Bartle Frere, for the control of the Gulf, under the orders of the Government of Bombay.

The document gives the author's concise opinion on four matters: 1. Maintaining the arrangement made by Lord Canning's Government, or through its intercession, regarding the payment of a subsidy of 40,000 dollars to Muscat by Zanzibar; 2. The adjustment of the future relations between Zanzibar and Muscat, and Muscat and Persia; 3.
