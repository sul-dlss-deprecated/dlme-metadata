His Highness will doubtless understand this important point. (b) His Majesty's Government have heard with regret of the incident in which a certain A1 Baruk was in volved. 'They quite recognise His Highnesses right‘^&gt; / ? Vf^ to maintain law and order in his btate, but they con sider the treatment meted out to A1 barujst is quite un necessarily severe. (bee paragraph 1 of Captain de Gaury's latter 2 jo.C2-i3i of 19th March). flogging in itself, within certain humane limits, is a punish ment recognised by many Governments, but repeated floggings to obtain information such as were inflicted on Al Baruk is nothing short of torture. as a method of administration it is not practised by modern Kulers and such methods must not be employed again. (c) Apart from the treatment of Al Baruk, His Majesty’s Government have learnt with some anxiety of the events which led up to his arrest and which took the form of a popular movement against His Highness’s administration. His Majesty’s Government have no desire to give an opinion on the rights and wrongs of this movement, but that it indicated a definite and general discontent with His Highness’s rule is evident, and as His Highness will, of course, realise it is the business of the Huler to conduct his administration in such a way that general discontent did not arise. His Highness will apprec iate that since in these days popular and democratic movements exist in most countries all over the world, it is not surprising that one should now be starting at Koweit. Experience has shown that the best way to deal with such movements is not mere repression which cannot be continued indefinitely as the movement get stronger, but the maintenance of law and order combined with a sympathetic guidance of the movement into useful channels of/of activity. Hia Majesty* a Government feel that the risk of a repetition of the present unfortunate incident would he conaiderahle lessened if His Highness would ass ociate himself more both with his family and his people in his administration, and in giving this advice His Majesty*s Government take into account that the normal i practice of government amongst Arab peoples from time immemorial is for the latter to be associated in some form or atfoex with their Shaikh in the affairs of the State. His Majesty's Government would be glad to have the views j of His Highness as to this suggestion. (d) Finally His Mage sty's Government have in mind the desirability of appointing an Adviser to His Highness and though they do not intend suggesting this officially to I His Highness for the moment, they would be glad to have his views unofficially on this measure. Paragraph 5 . i think the above suggestion should be salutary and I would be grateful to know as soon as possible if it is approved. (d) conveys a veiled warning that if the Shaikh does not mend his administration we may have to mend it for him and this should, I think, have a good effect. 3d. T.C.

Yours sine©** 11'Tote by Sir Trenchard Fowls, dated 14th April, 1938. / I saw Captain de Saury on my way through Basra, vide paragraph 4 of my express letter ho. C/149 of 22nd Aarch (P.Z.2148), and discussed the matter with him. His views were as expressed in his express letter of 19th March, ho. C./l29 . 2. The seriousness of the situation in my opinion depends partly at any rate on its repercussions in adjoining countries, especially Iraq. In paragraph 4 of his letter xio. O/l31 Captain de G-aury reported that several persons in panic had left Kuwait for Iraq, and I imagined that the Iraqi Press, which as you know takes every opportunity of attacking Kuwait, 'would have taken this opportunity of a fresh onslaught. The 2 ^ could have attacked the Shaikh of Kuwait as a brutal and high-handed Dictator suppressing a popular movement, and - what would have affected us - could have represented him being supported, either actively or tacitly, by H.M.G., under whose protection he is. If such articles had appeared they would probably have been copied by the rest of the Arab Press further afield, and the European Press, or rather sections of it, e.g., the Italian, might have taken it up. Before our present detente with Italy the incident would have been welcomed by the Bari Broadcast. 3. I therefore asked Captain de G-aury to telegraph to .Mr. Weightman, repeating to India Office and Government of India any repercussions that might ensue in the Iraqi Press. He has not telegraphed and so I assume that, contrary to my expectation, the Iraqi Press has not taken advantage of the incident - why I don’t know. hor hasli© r^poitcd furth©!* on tlic incidsn't i'tssXf, so X s,ssuni6 that all is quiet. 4. I suggest however that a telegram, be sent to Mr. Weightman, repeated to Captain de Gaury, copy by air mail to Government of India, referring to my express letter Ko.149 of 22nd March, and asking (a) whether any articles on the incident have appeared in the Iraqi Press, (b) how does the situation now stand. When we receive a reply we can consider what action, if any, is required by His Majesty’s Government.Xi Note by Sir Trenchard Fowls, ^otli A)pri l. The repercussions outside Koweit have not been as extensive as I anticipated and the local situation is quiet, A copy of the article forwarded under Mr, Weightman’s printed letter ho.c/180 oi 29th March was harmless enough. In fact it seems to me that the Iraqi press have from their point of view missed a first rate opportunity of attacking ICoweit and indirectly His Majesty 1 s GovernmentJ jpt the same time the incident has attracted some publicity in the neighbouring country of Iraq and I do not think we ought to let is pass wiunout notice, if only to prevent a repetition. 3. I suggest, therefore, that I be authorised by His Majesty’s Government to approach the Sheikh orally on the following lines (a) So long as the internal administration or howeio is carried out on proper lines, His Majestp &gt;-&gt; Government have no desire whatever to interfeie in that administration. On the other hand, they cannot be indifferent to serious incidents occurring in that State since owing to their special relations with its Ruler, they are in some measure held responsible by the public opinion of other countries for the way in which such incidents are dealt with. (His Highness will doubtless understand this important point). (b) His Majesty’s Government have heard with regret of the incident in which a certain Al farrax was involved. They quite recognise His Highness’s right to maintain' law and order in his State, out they consider the treatment meted out to Al Baiiak i s/is quite unnecessarily severe, (Gee paragraph 1 or Captain de Gaury's letter No.C,131 of 19th March), Flogging in itself, within certain humane limits, is a punishment recognised by many Governments, but repeated floggings to obtain information such as were inflicted on Al Barrak is nothing short of torture. As a method of administration i'c is not pracoiseu b c y modern flulcm s and such methods must not be employed again.

My dear Sir Trenchard, ■Sheikh Abdulla as Salim cailea again today and brought me the attached note, a copy of the original agreement made between Sheikh iSimad and certain notables of Kuwait, whereby he had to form a council as a condition of his erection as Ruler. (See P*G#iS, Page 73, Para 3}. 2 ^ Sheikh Abdulla said that he felt that a British adviser was essential here. He would like to see, ilr.Belgrave, the adviser at Bahrein, here. ■ihy so many of the people wanted the British here was because they saw and acmired the condition of Bahrein, and were also attached, by commercial interests and tradition to British India. a . He, and all the people were with us. nil would be well in future, if only we would give them a lead and an idea of what we wanted. He repeated that an indecisive policy would be dangerous and that underground agitation was not lessening. 4 , oheiih .fodulln, I think, possibly foresees that the present agitation may turn not only against aheihh i-hmad but against the whole Hulihg family, and knowing that in Bahrein we have supports the duling family views that form of administration favourably. 5 It is true, that at the moment, surprising as it may seem, the British, in this small state, are, generally speaking, popular and being looked to for a lead.

As, however, he is far from being either sound or level-headed I feel it is essential to try to put some checic on his actions, and tne most suit able means towards this end is by the resurrection of the Council which the famous Mubarak used to have. If such a Council had been in existence during the last few years I think it unlikely that the Shaikh’s errors, seme of which, in connection with the Date Gardens, may prove very expensive to His Majesty’s Government, would have been com mitted. de Gaury informs me that the idea of a Council would certainly have public opinion in Kuwait behind it. 6. you will see from paragraph 8 of de Gaury’s letter that he is submitting later the comprehensive report on the administration of Kuwait asked for in your telegram $©.986, dated 24th May 1938, 7. de Gaury informs me that the Iraqi Press have recently commented on the brutal flogging of Al Barrak, as also on the fleeing of some panic stricken Kuwaitis to seek safety in Iraq territory.

Urn* He Ms forma a kind of aaoooiatlon for corruption In Justice^ oonalsting of himself, His Highness* Secretary, the Sunni lazi, the Director of the Munlsipsllty and a oertain All al**Mas f ad, a Court messenger and psllsmsn. Corruption In justioe is a chief cause of public resentisent against the present administration, as almost erery member of tbs public, in aome way or-another, is effected* Those who have not hmm dircic v:iy effected the^elves are in sympathy with soise friends or near relatives who have been unjustly dealt with. The most open and shamaleaa aspect of Justice, or rather injustice, In Kuwait i» that Shaikh Abdulla, or tlw q&amp;zIb, will give a certain decision in a certain ease -mo clay, and mill give a rovers® decision in another but exactly similar ease the next day, always having one side tu the scales heavily down in favour of tM party which paid a price, or rather the party which pays higher.

It would appear desirable for the Huler of such a snail state to take an active part in the administration of Justice himself, and It is a grievance that he does not do so* If he, with two elders of his family, formed an appeal court, it should have a beneficial effect* Until about 1985 it was the habit of the Ruler of Kuwait to take an active pert in the aamlatfitrcUon of Justice, and the Ruler sat daily for a short time, in a public place, when petitioners, who might have been prevented from approaching him, or obtaining Justice otherwise, could coma to him with their plaint*/n y&gt;f. ’/ CA v (O -wm&amp;nm i m m ml * f Bw oonfliot between those In favour of a liberal education and those in favour of teohnloal education tea not arisen tn Kuwait, m there is no advanced odueafelon, and vary few boys would bo fit fen? either* if offered. a. mwvfmlma as education goes in the Arabian I^eninaular* the standard is quite high.

According to a well informed Ku^iti the procedure of the election is as follows:- “The permanent president, Shaikh Abdulla al-Jsbir, the Town Administrate*, cousin and son-in-law of the present Puler, issues letters to the electorate, who send their replies on the day of election to three old and distinguished merchants, who are staunch supporters of the president. These with the Director of the Municipality open th© ballot box and read out the letters, and give their decision m to the mmm of thorn elected.

With regard to the Article 5 of the Declaration they assured me, by informal message, that nothing in it is to be taken as meaning that His Britannic Majesty’s Government is not be responsible for Kuwait’s foreign relations. They suggest that any clarification that may be thought necessary can be made in an exchange of letters. They would they say have preferred to consult le about the wording of this article, but speed was essential to their success, and therefore they were obliged to forgo sucha reference. X n accordance with Article 4 of the Declaration the Council have already issued public notices to say that, pending formation of an n peal Court, all persons who ;ir ish to appeal from the judgement of the Magistrate, may do so to the Council, which will temporarily act as a Court of Appeal. rj ^ x family meeting of the Subah is now sitting to place the administration of the Suhah estates on a sounder footing, arranging the shares to which each member should be entitled, and so on.

The Sheifch of Kuwait who has been extremely supine and who had in my absence allowed the Council to take over a large number of his arms reserve now informs me that the Council is getting too strong for him. '■^hey wish him to remove his private secretary formerly 'all in all', and against whom I think the Council has good reason to complain. They also wish to appoint the controller of the reserve or arms which they have acquired from him. It is of course most undesirable that they should do so ('the army as a political instrument') and the appointment should remain in *heikh f s hands, and as a matter of principle the Sheikh should if he wishes be able to retain the services of his unpopular secretary, although I think it inadvisable. (The Sheikh on this point alone seems determined) 2 , In the circumstances the Sheikh and Sheikh Abdulla Salim this morning asked me take what material and political measures I could for their support. The Sheikh said that he would willingly accept an Adviser, and he has written to me today formally appealing to His Majesty’s Government for assistance in his plight^ 5 Copy in post.He asked me to see the Council and I have agreed to do so in the Agency with the Sheikh this afternoon at 5.P.M. when I shall hear Council’ point of view. I shall tell them that I will not give them any answer until later. 4 . Please say if you agree that I must explain that &gt; (a) Sheikh must be left with right to appoint his private secretary and (b) the Commander of the main reserve-2- which latter position is tantamount to that of Commander-in- chief* (5) Both Sheikhs say that it is rather unlikely that there will be armed clash. The Sheikh has some Bedouin and a Palace reserve. (6) I hope that if you instruct me as above it will deter the Council from further attempt to undermine Sheikh’s position. (7) I think however it would be wise to be prepared to show material strength as well, I therefore propose that a sloop, and the armoured cars be ready to move if required but not before as I hope avoid such use and antagonism &amp; of the at present friendly Council. A bother is that I have no sure means of communication in case of trouble, and I request that a mobile wireless be sent immediately to be at the Agency. I regard th*=4s as important and urgent.Telegram Q, From Resident Bahrein To Political Kuwait. No. T/190 Dated 10th August 1938. Your telegram 255 August 9th. I shall await report regarding council point of view before reaching any conclusions. Meanwhile I do not think you should attempt use any influence in regard private secretary. Arms question is more complex. I appreciate your point, but presumably council's attitude is atleast partly dictated by motives of self defence and they seam to have some rights under article two (o) of the council charter. I should like your further views in the light of the above Para 2. I will arrange for sloop if necessary but would prefer to omit armoured cars unless required for protection of British subjects.Telegram From To No. Dated 0, Political Resident, Bahrein.

I told council that there must be no disturbances* and the Sheikh that I will give him answer in about two days. We might support the Sheikh in the matter of his secretary but say that if there is in future any complaint supported by evidence of intrigue by him against the council that we will not do so. we should also tell the Sheikh verbally (a) that there must be no repetition of this kind of thing (b) that he must in future help his council to work along right lines when necessary sitting with them (c) that we are acceding to his request for an Adviser whichit he has this morning confirmed in writing Id) that he must take steps improve his corps which he has over economized) and (e) that he must take over the reserves as agreed by the council. 6.

Reference my telegram No.257 Para 4. I was naturally inclined to support existing Ruler (at the risk of aligning oueselves with unpopularity) but to my mind the Sheikh has now given the final coup to his prestige. the dispute, in which he invoked our aid, he may give way to council but not abdicate - although how he intends to rule in that case I do not know. I t would be impossible for him and for us and I should think that finally he will make up his mind to go. Xf he does abdicate the possibility is that Abdulla will be acclaimed, although there are people who despise whole family. 4 # Xt should be unnecessary to be overbearing about arms and ammunition reserve as council have already agreed to their control by a nominee of Ruler, and have deference our views on defence. s .

Prom Resident Bahrein To Political Kuwait. Addressed Poltioal Agent Kuwait, Secretary of State for India and Government of India. My immediately preceding telegram(not repeated to Political Agent, Kuwait) describing situation there. To my m ind it is quite impossible to afford Sheikh support either moral or material in direct opposition his council for sole object of retainin g foreign intriguer as secretary. If Sheik h choos es this issue for trial strength with council he should recognise that he does so against our advice and with n o prospect of support ^ Please advice him accordingly. No political advantage can accrue to us by interference and we cannot afford lose able position we hold at present affair of this nature. 2 ^ s 0 far as proposal for Adviser is concerned, is this made with support of Council?.For obvious reasons we cannot take it up in present circumstances until council have indicated agreement in writing. 3&gt; x am asking Sloop to move up to direction of Kubba Island, prepared to go in to Kuwait if situation requires but it is of first importance to obviate any possible belief that it is sent for support of Sheikh's Secretary.! should not therefore ask for it to move unless there is prospect of outbreak involving danger to lives of British subjects. I shall only ask for armoured cars as a last resort. 4 . Please use your best endeavours make Sheikh see sense . He should have learnt by experience strength which is behindt the Council against unpopular secretary.

From India Office. % l ' \ \ \ 1 A i Addressed Resident Bahrein, repeated Political Agent Kuwait copy by post to India* Reference Resident’s telegram No.T/195 of August llth. If you have not already made suggested communication to Sheikh please defer action pending the receipt further telegram from here which it is hoped will reach you shortly Convey my full instrictions*SECRLT A1TD PERSOHAL. ..X e of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Gamp, Bahrain, 15th August 1938. By the time this reaches you, you will have tried out the India Office compromise, and I suppose there is an outside chance that it may work. I confess I am not optimistic since I am sure that if anything quite so simple had had a reasonable prospect of success you would have gone for it before you sent your first telegram. However there has been an interval for ' cooling - off ' , and perhaps that has had some effect. 2 . I do not, of course, know personalities in Kuwait, but ftarm information gleaned from recent reports it seems to me highly improbable that any genuine rapprochement can now occur between the Shaikh and the Council. ( Actually the Secretary row gave him a great chance, and if he had &amp;£t his course wisely he ought to have been able to take quite a lot of wind out of the Council's sails. However he failed to do so and proved once again his gift for making it impossible for us to help him adequately )• As I understand it our object isjto try to keep a fairly even ba,lance between the Shaikh a-nd his Council. At tne same time if we are to attempt to even things up a little at the moment ( the scales being well down on the Council's Captain G.S.H. de Gaury, M.C., Political Agent, KuwaitCouncil’s side ) the nature of the weightage to he used must he approved hy us. And it must he so selected that it does not present the Council with all the propaganda value and enable them to mobilise public opinion against both the Shaikh and ourselves. In this Secretary row the only possible point on the Shaikh’s side was the ' personal appointment ' aspect, and though that might appeal to us as reasonable enough, would it to anyone in Kuwait ? It was unfortunate I misunderstood the reference in your first telegram to 'Private Secretary' ( in recent correspondence the 'Private Secretary' has been Izzet Jaafar and Khan Bahadur Salah was the ' Secretary') but whichever it might be, is it strictly correct to regard him as purely a member of the Shaikh’s private entourage ? Both of them - and particularly the Persian have been, as I see it, very much political appointments for the purpose of dealing with public affairs. It seems to me that it would be just about as accurate to describe Coering or C-oebbels as members of Hitler’s personal entourage. But I should be grateful for your comments on this. 3 . The next point is this. I seem to remember that either Sir Trenchard or you told me that the Shaikh had considerable funds salted down in Syria or Jigypt in preparation for a flit at any time. If this is so thi-s idea of abdication is no new thing - it may happen any moment - and we need not be in such a fritter of anxieoy to prevent it. If,then, the Shaikh is a likely Suc,j.&amp;ex for Syria in any event ( barring unqualified support from3 us, which can scarcely he forthcoming ) v/ould it do us i any great harm if he went fairly soon ? Would it not he better to let him go before he has collected too much oil money - and sent it out of the country ? And if he is to go can we not acquire a little public merit out of it ? ^2. want a British Adviser in and I should have thought that we might stand a good chance of getting one in with everyone’s approval in Kuwait as the result of a change of Shaikhs following just such an affair as this . What do you think about this ? 4 # The final question is this. If there is a new Shaikh in the near future, who are the likely candidates and whom would you put your money on ? The part of your telegram Ho. 259 dated 11th August on this point was rather corrupt and X can only guess that your choice was Abdulla bin Salim. I suppose his G.I.E. means ttoci he is pretty thoroughly persona grata with us, though he seems to have had something of a reputation as an intriguer in the past. Is he the sort of man who could, in your opinion, (a) work in with but hold his end up against the Council Cb) be relied on not to embarrass us whenever we try to help him (c) be induced to accept a British Adviser ? I shall be most grateful for a reply by special messer er to Basrah and thence by air. I Have put off my departure for Karachi but X don't want to wait beyond SaturdaySaturday next if possible, and it would help a lot if I- could have your reply before then. As you will have inferred I am not hopeful about genuine and permanent results from this suggested compromise.Telegram Q No 1450 Dated 14th August 1938 From India Office To Political Kuwait Addressed to Political Resident, copy to Political Agent Kuwait.

Though it is possible that Secretary’s removal might be desirable in itself in view his unpopularity with council I am very doubtful as matter principle of wisdom recognizing any right on the part of council to dictate to **heihh on the question appointment a* to his personal entourage. I am futher concerned at Sheikh threatening abdication. This is a possibility which needs careful consideration in view serious consequences that may ensue and it seems undesirable that situation should develop in a way that may result in his abdication on this issue. to come to a compromise which will save Sheikh’s face while at the same time satisfying wishes council.Most satiSi.a®^ory Secretary’s removal and for Sheikh after a decent interval to dispense his services method endeavouring to effect this might be left to de Gaury. His main approach would few ofcourse have to be to Sheikh, and he might inform latter that while we appreciate his objection admitting any right to Council to interfere questions appointment kis personal staff if he would be well advised to make a change on his own initiative within a reasonably shortm period, if Council withdraw their demand for Secretary’s removal. Political Agent would then take such informal steps as are possible induce the Council to withdraw.

The 'cooling off' was admittedly more on Sheikh’s side than that of the Cou .oil. In view of the strength ot their o.m and public opinion they did well in keeping order aa long as they did. I am aur© that if the secretary had not left last night there would have been a serious disturbance today or tomorrow. 3 . /ith reference to Para 2, I agree that any genuine rapprochement between the Sheikh and Council now seems very for off, if not quite impossible. ‘ uite recently, inspite of all ny hints and suggestions, he was still taking them as if they were the enemies instead of his goverment. X agree with you entirely in your remark at top of -Page 2 ox your .letter and I think that 'the nature of the weightage' must be soon thought of and X make some suggestions below in this letter.

He can still livesurrounded by retainers, almost free, out of the produce of his flocks and reources in kind. Only today X heard from Harris, Manager of Ottoman Bank , Basra a periodic payment of £.1000/- by the Anglo-Iranlan Oil Company to the Sheikh’s account has been changed by the Sheikh’s instructions to the name of, he thought, Subah bib Ahmad Jabir, who is his son aged about eleven years. Harris promised to confirm this. It was a rather mysterious account which was apparently not in connection with the Kuwait Oil Company. Obviously too there are good many perquisites of office for a Ruling Sheikh, whatever the constitution. On the other hand the Sheikh told me that in accordance with the Couj.oii’s inaugural law he had promised that he would at the end of the year, when it is due, transfer the Kuwait Oil Company’s cheque about £.7000/, to the Council and all the main resources of the country will now go into the Council’s hand; so that he can’t be considered to be 'screwing” any longer. 8# xt seems to me that whoever is politically on the underside for the moment her© is in favour of a British Adviser. It is not so long ago since the present members of the Council were sending me messages to say that they wanted an Adviser to control the Sheikh. Now that they are in office I do not think they would favour one for a moment. It is not so much the advise they dread as his ’interference” and hundred percent efficiency. However I foresee that the time nay come when the Council will begin to fall out tiiaong themselves, and I dare say, although there are no signs of it at the moment, that an opposition outride the council may form and presumably will drift to tne Sheikh’s sit There may come a moment when the Council ask - or assistance In the interval, it is possible, out oi zeal and rawness, th y may be rather a nuisance, and without really meaning to do so may: raise serious issues , or by some hasty ordercut across or t'lm oil c once salons.

T. Peel if squire, H.C.# The India Office, London.4. I am afraid fcnat tilt use of tne designation Private Secretary* in early reports has tended to obscure tne real issue* X Bye elf read tftua to refer to Xasat Jaffar who had Mtnerto been described as the private Secretary while the ’•Secretary* was the Persian Khan Bahadur nulla Balth. the latter’s official title was ranged on tne creation of the Council* neither person, however, could properly fee regarded as merely a member of the Bhelkh’s personal entourage? both were directly concerned in the pre-existing administration? and indeed it is scarcely too much to say that nulla Saleh was. the Government* Thue this dispute was (and is), in actual tact, a struggle between the new sad old forms of admini strati can, and now that these two men have gone it must be our object to attest to build up some sort of co-operation between the Shaikh and his Council# This is clearly &amp; mosst difficult problem and personally I cannot altogether eliminate some feeling of regret that tne Shaikh has now, according to de Saury, completely put out of his mind any idea of abdica tion# (With the obvious successor, Shaikh Abdulla bin Salim, the problem would be infinitely simpler). 5, the situation then, in its essentials, retina un changed. The Shaikh continues, in spite of de Saury’s frequent attempts,to lead him to a more reasonable point of view, to regard the Council as w tne enemy*. He displays not the least inclination to co-operate with him, arid he expects, % by his request for a British Adviser, to enlist the aid and support of His Majesty’s Government against them. It is significant that he told de Gaury that he himself does not believe that the Council will willingly accept an Adviser. de Gaury /da O&amp;ury, too, is of the opinion, \4. th wnion 1 entirely concur, that any approacn to the Council on the question oi an AdTiser at this stage would oe a serious error in tactics, for the shales jaove is so ohviously designed, and will unquen11 onafcly he recognised in Kuwait, as an attempt to use the power of the British Govern merit to tor salt the Council. And incidentally de Saury and I hate little doubt that if he were to succeed he would lose no opportunity of shitting ail th© odium on to the shoulders of His Majesty*6 Government. On the other hand the Council, which after all is making some attempt to b^in to introduce reforms into the administration, could at the best only regard our advocacy of such an appointment at the moment as a clear indication of mistrust of their motives and abilities. In such circumstances no Adviser could adequately carry out his functions, and public opinion, reacting to the Council's resentment, must become increasingly hostile to His Majesty’s Government. 6 # it seems tome therefore that our first step must be to disabuse both parties «* and in particular the Shai&amp;h ** of any idea that we regard them as alternative and mutually repugnant manifestations of authority in Kuwait, or that we are likely to take sides in their disagreemei*ho progress can be made until the shaikh realises that His Majesty's Government recognise the Council ae an essential feature of the administration of Kuwait and, by implication, that they are not prepared to assist in a-jy ri&amp;h®eii%res it designed to destroy t^zass. On their side the council must understand that in spite of their ’♦Inaugural law* we regard the /the Shaikh as the symbol of authority in Kuwait# and tmt# as Sir Trench&amp;rd ^owle remarked in paragraph 10 of his demi- official letter Mo # 39d«3 of the 18th Juiy 1938# the Shaikh is still cfftotally responsible for Kuwait’s relations with His Majesty’s Govern ment. I propose therefore that the next step should be on the lines of paragraph 3 of Sir frenonard Fowle’s telegram Mo.275 of the 16th July 1938 , where he suggested that a message should be sent to the Shaikh on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, though in view of subsequent developments it is clearly necessary to revise the phrasing of the cQiUTtiunioation• iue tis &amp; rough idea of the kind of message I have in minds * X m directed oy His Majesty’s Government to inform four Highness that they have learnt with sat is tact i on of your establishing a Council. 1 understand that in taking th.i8 step four Highness has been actuated by a desire to associate the representatives oi ya-.4r people with your administration, snd tney trust that this admirable sentiment will be fully implemented in practice. They hope that there will be close and constant consultation between four Highness and tns members of your Council# and that your deliberations with them will be conducted in a spirit of mutual trust and confidence and will be distinguished by &amp; sincere desire to advance the beet interests of Kuwait by your co-operation. 4 «* -nig Majesty’s Government confidentially expect that the happy relations wit eh have so long subsisted between themselves said the Euler of Kuweit will be confirmed /'confirmed and strengtaensdi »nd in particular there .rtll be no diaturbanoe of existing arraugeiaeiita by which they undertake, in assrsamait nta the Ruler, to conduct the foreign affairs of Kuwait. Xt ie on this assumption that 1 am inatruotad to assure Your Highness of the continued intention of His eety’a Ooremment to preserye the integrity of Ku r. it against external aggression.* 7. fhia, it sill be seen, blandly ignores tne recent trouble since no particular object can oe serred oy reviving unpleasant memories. I fully realise that tne latter part of the suggested oummunication goes beyond tne strict latter of our treaty position, but it would be a pity to miss so excellent an opportunity of attaining the object set out in the correspondence leading up to your letter SO.J?.*.743»/36 of the 29th October 1936. X share de Saury’s opinion that His Highness is unlikely seriously to contest at such a juncture a written atatement of what is, after all, the practical poaitioiu 8. It ««*• to i« *f mm* tn&amp;t ocouBunication, whether written or verbal, be made to the members of the Council, fhe 'Inaugural law' arms mem with greater authority in respect of external affairs end dealings with foreigners generally than we can cast ortably acxn owl edge. The exact terms of this Taw need not be taken too seriously, particularly since it has not been communicated officially to the Political Agent, bftt it is, 1 suggest, essential to remove from the minds of the Council any impression that we might regard them as the sole repository of authority in Kuwait /Kuwai t # that we should Oe prepared to deal with them to the exolue 1 m of the bhaikh» or that we should tolerate their interference with foreign affairs or their assumption of sole authority in respect of the otner matters recited in article 3 of the law. de Gaury has aia*eady thrown out a few hints to the members of the Council on these lines* an d he informs me that they show no inclination to dispute hie state ment of the controlling power exercised by Hie Majesty's Government. At the present stage a formal pronouncement made with the authority of his Hapecty's Government (a) that we regard the ghaifch as the constitutional head of the State with whom our official relations win be maintained* (b) repeating in general terms the advice to the Shaikh in regard to consultation ana co-operation* aid ( q ) Stating in unequivocal terms our insistence on control of foreign affairs and dealings with foreigners generally* would excite no nostile reaction* and might well serve both to enhance the Shaikh's prestige and to create a more reason able balance between him and the Council. 9. Action on the above lines will at least serve to clear the air and to remove misunderstand! ng, but if it is to produce effective results it is important that it should be taken without delay, before Iraqi intrigue and influence is brought to bear on the members of the Council. 10. To revert now to the shaikh's formal request for a British Adviser. It seems to me that we Can at the moment only /12. / ? only ignore tnid 9 mo. tuat de Gaury ce instructed to reply* to any furtner eaquiri ea from tne snaildx fey saying tnat Hie Majesty*® Gonremment await tne development of a fuller measure of oo~operation between him and his Council aid a clearer indication that tae request represents a decision taken by *the Shaikh acting with his Council* before taey take the mattei* into consideration. It is oy no means improbable that the time will soon acme wnen tne Council will be ready to look much more favourably on such an appointiaei t. the surprising unanimity which actuates them and the whole- hearted public support which they enjoy at present can scarcely last for ever, ard as their difficulties increase so will their minds revert to the idea of a British Adviser - an idea which appealed so strongly to many of turn in pre- Oouncil days, before they themselves enjoyed the savour of authority# I doubt if it is necessary to argue the advantages of introducing a British Adviser sooner or later# and if this is accepted in principle it will no doubt be possible for de G&amp;ury # as time goes on# to help the idea take fresh root in the minds ©f the Council* 11 . X am afraid this letter is very long and contains little that ia immediately constructive, but it »@em&amp; to me that constructive development cannot occur until our own position is understood quite clearly am until the iineixch in particular realises that we cannot be lured into participation in his schemas to destroy the Council. It is this thought which has been most prominently in my mind during the last ten days.BY AIK M/iIL, D.O. No. 561 Pol it loci igeiK3y, K\m it. 3^nd AuguBt 19iB.

The voters assembled xbdcs publicly and three noteables, including Shaikh Ahmed bin Khamis, an influncial Mulla, rose and spoke to the assembly, telling them that they are free to vote for whomever they wished, and asked them in the name of Allah to vote for those persons whom they think would be the best to serve and safeguard the interests ff the public. Then white sheets of paper, numbered serially according to the serial number of each voter in the book of the Ooraittee ’ and inicialed by its President, to prevent double voting, were distributed to the voters, each of them wrote the names of 14 persons whom he wished to be the members of the Majlis. Then the sheets were collected, the votes counted and the successful candidates declared. A few of the unsuccessful candidates, who have themselves voted and received xscteMX some votes,raised an objection and wanted the elections to be held again, there were strong public , r feelings against them and some of them did not stir out in , public, and alfmost every wall in tmggxxtx important places of the town contained some writings against them, cursing them and * calling them traitors.

Note by Agency Interpreter! - I understand that a Dastoor is being prepared by the Majlis. It consists of a preface and five parts mostly derived from the Egyptian Constitution. The preface will contain the description of the flag of Kuwait, that Kuwait is uiie capital of t ie ^tate, that the State can not be devided in parts or territories. That all treaties and agreements with Great Britain will be respected and that Kuwait is under British protection. The live parts are about the equality of all Kuwaitis, the powers of the Majlis, the President, the Magistrates, the Quadhis etc, A clause is to be included empowering the Majlis to make amendments and alterations within a period of one year from the first publication of the Dastoor. It is said that this is to be included as a precaution in case His Majesty’s Government may object to some points or may make some suggestions calling for amendments. I also understand that the Majlis intends to adopt the Ottoman Majallah of Islamic law, which is now in force in Iraq and Syria, the Syrian edition is preferred as it has no additional complicated matter as the Iraqi edition. There will also be a Statute Book for forming new laws which are not included in the Shari 'at Law*P. Z. 5661/58 \ INDIA OFPICS 9 ‘ WHITEHALL, 24 th Aug List j 1958. My dear Baggallay ?

You will see that he sent a copy of it g I {fit. 1 to Peterson. .,• ' f r &gt; In his earlier telegram No.275 of the 16th July (see India Office letter No.P.Z.5035/38 of the 18th July) Fowle suggested the terms of a message which he might he authorised to send to the Sheikh on behalf of His Majesty’s Goveriment with reference to the new Council. We deferred action on this pending receipt of the report which Fowle had promised by post. This has now been received and throws light on the surprising development by which the Council has obtained so much control of the administration. In the li^it of the report, and after consultation with Sir T* Fowle, who passed through London on 5th August, we would now propose, if the Foreign Office agree, that the terms of the message to the Sheikh proposed in Bushire telegram Ho.275 of 16th July should be slightly modified as follows 1/ Baxter, Esq., Foreign Office,2. ,f ! am directed by His Majesty’s Government to infora Your Highness that they have noted with •r* interest Your Highness’s decision to establish a Council in Koweit.

We think, and Fowle agrees, that his reply to the Iraqi Government should not enter into details about these powers, which may in practice be considerably less than one might suppose from a reading of the document; in particular, for example, we understand that the Sheikh’s assent ?/ill still be necessary for all legislative and executive acts.

As regards the suggested reply to Bagdad, we feel that it might be a mi state not to give the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs a copy of the law governing the powers of the Council, if he should wish to have one. If the powers have already been correctly published in the Iraqi press, there can be no harm in giving a copy by way of confirmation; if they have been incorrectly published, it would be as well to let the Minister for Foreign A* 1 ail s have the authentic version* If therefore you have no objection, we will add a paragraph to our telegram to Houetoun-Boswall, saying that he may give a copy of the law to the Minister for Foreign Affaire, should the latter ask for one* Yours ever, (Scl. ) XACY BAGGAIJuAY 1*1* Peel, Psq*, f.C*—n Confidential D.O.No.c/591.

Peel’s letter was written before the occurrence of the recent crisis, but that affair did not of course alter the constitutional position in Kuwait resulting from the Shaikh’s acceptance of the »Law M defining the powers of the Council. I have not been able to find in Sir Trenchard Fowls’s report of 18th July, or in any of your reports prior or subsequent to it, any statement justifying the assumption in Peel’s letter, and as it is a matter of importance that His Majesty’s Government should be under no misapprehension regarding the actual constitutional position in Kuwait, I would be glad if you would let me have your views as to the correctness or otherwise of Peel’s assumption.

The state of parties, if such they can be called, in Kuwait is roughly as follows:- * Name si)The sheikh and immediate followers No* 500 &gt;) The President of the Council and immedte te followers 400 Berra rks * .termed, has since formation of Council, asked in writing for Bri tish tedviser and 'everything to be as in Bahrain'. termed, strongly in favour of British tedviser and control. )) The Subah family 20 members wifi their followers 1000 l) So far inarticulate Tribesmen and villagers,conservatively followers of Sheikh and ruling family, although no doubt pressed with reduction of their taxes by council 8000 i) The Council with their party and own clans 20000 f) The Shiahs, including Hasainis Baherana and FOWAOte 25000 Armed, in favour of Bri tish tedviser, or British control. Badly armed. No opinions termed, friendly to British but not since they are in power! Tesirous of any interference. Hardly any arms. Asking for British nationality and all inclined to British superior control. 3) Nejdis and non desoript 5000 partly armed, no opinions. Apart from local politics, the above seems to roe, in view of present threats of European war, interesting. In spite of contacts with Iraq and all the propaganda there has been from Italy and Palestine, it looks, at the moment anyway, as if fie Arabs here are not likely to be inimical. m I■HIMNote for the Hon’ble the Political Resi. dent Kuwait situation 1-10-38 . PREMISE , (a) The Council ha^ received no advice from His Majesty f s Government for three months^but thqr have I'eceived almcjst daily advice from the Mutassarif of Basra. (b) They came into being as an Opposition to the Sheikh, and therefore tend to remain in opposition to the Sheikh. Mr* (c) The Sheikh asked a British Adviser and for His A ' Majesty’s Government support against the Majlis. He received neither, in consequence he is ncwr after some futile efforts to break them, tending to encourage the Majlis to go against British influence which no doubt fits with the advice from Iraq, hoping to be (i) Popular with the Majlis if it lasts or (ii) Induce us to break the Majlis, throwing the odium on us. g # we have now got to the stage when the Majlis is 'corrupted'. Atleast half of tie population of Kuwait must be against them, forming themselves up the following heads (a) Sheikh, and the Subah family, and their followers which include the tribesmen. (b) Those officials who have been displaced by Majlis and their followers. (c) A number of notables whose interests are menaced by the interests of the members of the Majlis, such as wealthy banker Bin Bahar, and the prosperous contractor Yusuf-al-Ghanim. Former has had his concession, the Landing Company, cancelled. (d) Ten thousand or more Shias, (not all Persians or persons of Persian origin, as the Majlis try with the advice of Mutassarrif to make out)have in fear of the Majlis asked for British nationality (not Iranian nationality). They haw now been given cause to show that they are liable to be tyrannically treated^by the notices, posted by the Majlis in the bazaar saying that their property is liable to be confiscated, and ttey have no representative on the Council or Municipality. 3* Argument :- New that the Majlis is w corrupted M , it will only lead to a wrangle, in which they will seek to strengthen themselves more and more by bluff and demonstration, if we or the Sheikh try to include them to leave the path which they have already taken. I doubt, from what I hear, if they will accept any Shiah representation or leave foreign affairs to the Sheikh. 4. Conclusion . (a) The Sheikh who continually expresses his dissatisfaction with the Council, should dissolve the present Council if he wishes to do so, 'in order^obtain fairer representation from a larger electorate '(previous voters were 150 persons onlyj, and order new elections, under the management of Sheikh Abdulla Salim and officers to be appointed by the Sheikh, on an electoral scale to be decided by him. That some 20,000 Kuwaitis, a third of the ClXuV) (A-y do £v2L oL ^ CgaaATCJUuuUQ^ , ChuCQAJ^X^ eJlsi cJrlAKAQ , , C CdA. Out Ua-&gt;- Ou£ C+A- %cPr , Kuwait population has in fear of the Council asked for foreign nationality is sufficient cause for the Sheikh to order dissolution. Incidentally as one of the members of the Council is 'Emir' of the arras reserves, the Sheikh should appoint, a permanent successor, as soon as the Majlis is dissolved. This is important as it gives the Council far too much power having the arms under their control. (b) First step seems to be a frank, a very frank, talk with Sheikh. r L * ' ^ 1 7 LA i r% 1 ' ■ i J ■Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office.

P.s* 6062/38, dated the 30th September 1938, on the subject of recent developments at Kuwait. 2. 1 arrived here on the 4th from Bahrain and the Shaikh called on me at the Agency (d@ Gaury was of course present) accompanied by his cousin Abdullah al Balim, the Freeident of the Council. Khle ms a healtby innovation as previously the Sheikh, unlike the Eulers of the other Arab States of the Gulf, would call on me alone and keep his family and notables deliberately in the background. Accompanied by da Saury I then paid my return call on the Shaikh arid Abdullah al Salim. The conversation at these calls was confined to paoaing the time of day and remarks about the weather, which after being extremely unpleasant 'md taken a change for the better. 3. The next step was to get into fri endly relations with the Council and for this purpose at die Gaury f e sugges tion I proposed to the Shaikh that he should ask the Council to meet me for a cup of coffee in his palace. The Shaikh agreed to this and on the morning of the 6tn de Gaury and I met the Council &lt;*£&amp; each member of whom was then introduced to me. I naturally laid j^yaelf cut to be friendly, and thanked the member of the Council who rejoices in the title of / J. P. Gibson Ksquire, The India Office, London.- 2 - ©f 'Minister for ?ar M for having taken Young round when the matter was drawing up his defence schsae (see paragraph 7 of asr desiUoffiolal letter Ho.c/747, dated the Sth October 1938, to Peel), The Council reciprocated and a aost friendly atmosphere was the result. 4* The next step was to get down to business, first with ta© Shaikh am then with the Council. On the 8th the Shaikh came to the Agency and I gave him the letter mentioned in paragraph 3 of your letter under reference. The Shaikh appeared pleased with its contents and I enclose a translation of his reply. 5. At the same meeting I thought it would be both correct and advisable to inform him of the contents of the oral communi cation to the Council, a copy of which you enclosed. The Shaikh definitely approved of it from his point of view, especially paragraphs (o) and (d), and it was* arranged that I should see a deputation from the Council consisting of the i/resfcden %, Abdullah al Salim, and 3 or 4 members in company with the Bhaikh in order to deliver this message to them. On the morning of the Uth the Shaikh and Abdullah a l Salim with the .Deputation came to the Agency and 1 gave the Deputation the message which was well received by them, and in which they concurred. This was of course the most important point at issue. 6 6. In the last month or so the Council had addressed some communications to the Cuwait Oil Company direct. In itself this would not perhaps be very important, but I thought it worth while taking up with the Deputation. I explained that the /the company was a foreign concern anal further that the Conceaaion was in the name of the Shaikh. Correspondence therefore should be between the shaikh and the Company. The Ceyutat ion accepted this as a principle, but tried to argue that in routine matters of unimportance they should have the right of addressing the Company direct so as to save time. There was something in this but 1 did not think it wise as a matter of principle to concede the point. X explained therefore that it xrm not of course our intention to delay the work of the Company in any* way, and in course of time if experience showed that routine matters were held up by these having to go through the Shaikh, doubtless another method could be adopted. . 7* inch argument as there was at this meeting was of an ^ entirely friendly nature. In fact in the Shaikh’s view too friendly l He remarked later at a private meeting which I had with hie that my tone had been too mild with the Imputation, and that in future he hoped that X would ©peak to them more :1 roughly*. The Shaikh has all a weak man's urge for table thumping tactics, especially if these tactics are employed by somebody else on his behalf. He is still definitely, though more unobtrusively than previously, opposed to the Council, and would like nothing better than to drive m wedge between us and them. He would have been delighted, if X had been so foolish as to adopt a bullying attitude to the Council to have emphasised this later privately to the Council to our dis advantage. Our policy of course is, while maintaining a measure of balance between the Jhaxkh and the Council, to preserve our relations with the letter so that they regard us as friends not enemies and turn t o us for unofficial advice, the more so as we have /«■ have obtained a good start vith them (see paragraphs 10 and 11 of my demi-official letter Ho*590-S t dated the 18th July 1938). It is hardly necessary to say that in m future meetings with the council 1 did not tfue the Shaikh's advice. 8. To sum up. (f ) The written cei&amp;mmlent ion, referred to in your letter quoted above, has been given to the Shaikh and acknowledged by him with appreciation. (b) The oral communication has likewise been delivered to the Council and accepted by them without demur. (c) The Shaikh's stock which previous to my visit was somewhat too low has risen some points and at the same time the friendly atmosphere which existed previously between the Council ami ourselves has been confirmed. 9. de Caury was of course present at all meetings ami convers&amp;t ions and I have derived much benefit from his local knowledge and com-land of Arabic. It is of course a great advantage for a Political Agent to be able to conduct conversations and negotiations personally instead of through an interpreter. # I am sending a copy of this letter to Metcalfe and giving one to de Gaury• Yours sincerely, sd. ?.C.]?owle. ♦ sent under Printed letter Bo.(1/805 of the 19th October 1908,CONFIDENTIAL. ^ T °- G/807 of 1938.

Could you please refer to my demi-official letter ^o. C/B04, dated the 19th October 1933, on the subject of the Kuwait Council. 2. Another matter connected with the Council i® as follows, there are here a large number of individuals of the Chi*ah persuasion, probably as many as 13,000, the total population of ^u^aii t own being, say, 65,000: these figures are extremely rough as there hm never been anything like a Shaikh real census of ,&amp;aw&amp; it • In 1910, how ever ,2 b&amp;ra^ imd em enumeration made of the population of the town which showed a total of 33,000, of which 1000 were 'Persians% ( Tne Bedu tribes and the villages in Kuwait territory outside the town are Bunni}* 3. The above Shi 1 ah® can be divided into the following classes: (*0 aJAH&amp;I 1.e. Persians, numbers about 10,000. (b) HABAvlS. lumbers about 3000. Bhi’ahs from, the Has a Province of Saudi Arabia. These are the remnants of the old Persian conquest of the Arab Coast. (o&gt; / P. Gibson Require, The India Off ice, London.(c) BAHAH1A3. numbers about 3000. Shi*alls from Bahrain and the coasts of the lower middle section of the Persian Gulf* (d) TOfASRA* Itatfeers about 1000. ?hes e are Shi * ahs of those /ifabs who emigrated from Arabia into Persia, and thence back to Kuwait. (e) Ohi’aha of Iraqi origin, lumbers about 700. 4. All these Shi*ahs h&amp;ve lived contentedly in Kuwait up to within a few months ago, I.e. up to the formation of the council. Since then, however, they nave shown s l t m of discontent. The reason for this is presumably as follows, tinder the one-aaii r s &lt;ile of the Shaikh the Shi*aha were at ai^y rate no worse off th*n the Sunnis. Moreover the Shaikh*e State Secretary, himself a Persian Shi * ah by origin, gave them a way of access to the head of the State in case of grievances* With the coming of the Council however - an entirely Sunni body, on which the Shi * &amp;hs are not represented they feel that they are unlikely to get a square deal, though up to date they have indeed suffered no actual tyranny from the Council. This discontent culminated lately in applica tions being received by de laury, as Political Agent Kuwait, to the number of more tnan 4500 to become British subjects. The analysis of these figures is as followss Bahamas ... ... ... 983 Hasawis **. »*• ... 37 Iranians (in Kuwait leas than 10 y ear e) . *«• 1 ?0 Iranians (in Kuwait up to 120 years and all more than 10 years) .. 345? 4647 Thie /7./ -5. This figure includes .srives and children of the applicants but not their servants, male aixi female, which would bring the number up to perhaps 3000. Men this move became known to the council, they allowed themselves to become rattled ana, in spite of some good advice from de Oaury, issued a public notice to the effect that anyone applying for foreign nation ality would render himself liable to deportation. This increas ed the apprehensions of the Bhi'&amp;hs. 5. liven if we wanted to accede to these applications for British nationality we cannot do so under the rules governing the grant of British nationality to foreigners, which, amongst other stipulations, lay down that the applicant must have long residence in a British possession, de Gaury under my instructions has informed the applicants accordingly, through :5aid TUsuf Musawi, the Judge of the Ghi’an Religious Court, and the accepted head of the Rhi * ah coasaunity • 6. Though the Shi*ah question is an internal matter, nevertheless it may have external repercussions since so many of the Shi♦ aiis in question are Persians, or of recent Persian descent, and if they are hardly treated the Iranian Govern ment may make representations to us on their behalf. Further, f we are of course interested in trying to ensure that Kuwait, especially at the present time, continues without internal disturbances. This being so X thought it a® well to have a talk with the shaikh and the Council on the subject and on the 15th a meeting took places the Jiejlis was represented by their President and six members* X was accompanied by de G&amp;ury.til « -Iw# -Oda Ip :{&amp;%&amp;£%■&amp;&amp; tea® w^yim wfc-bvl&amp;ai ^jixAiai'i gi. , &amp;fitwS hl&amp;mw $&amp;£££ t*m mist* »t ■ ma $m# o$ omegni avom MM , ■. uq&amp;i's&amp;q qu &lt;sn$ b&amp;X$$m amoamti q$ myJfowmA$ y&amp;tif *ii$vq 9 - i i at m* -m boo% am a 1© •#lf#,jti -ooi -3 n tot tnicyiw ten Posits &amp;iiJ ot f*oi+cfi ■■' ■ - : - .. .. ;:■ . r i+c. * ^ , ; . • znp. • M- sit:' 'it, artoi smib^^o ,i $;;t fo rot mod j,joJ *0&amp;s{&amp; of ^ tacos oj b&amp;fiuzw ©w Ji aatF %iiUi'X9Vo&amp; a&amp;Iijn msU tamih os at foaxmc »% L-'hxqX fna tist ; w;,.u . t f- , \*si.^i i'' 1 C 1 t uj \C riX^fioi te- £X.Ji i 1J It- e-- fSi)fi3 ituBOiXwN^ m/ob s ^, e ^ &lt;5a ‘ / ; ^ a«#i| &gt;3 fti acv.&amp;ut : 9 a©I ?v - • • it‘.ujr.yot ri!,i%ci£ .ui « n $ ^mvc xtti r.&amp;i nacirpinjracfl I * .• u^.-r'-oc ^ s ' - •-&lt; sit io i?s5t?a fctnssoor;- oX-i xap ' ' : # § aa ^ aoAt3 aa-i Lmrw?7® »v»r; xi aa©I«;in»vea a4Mani‘i l € ^xe t 9a«iahr9^ ftoi^ap tti xtbandz miS It ~ ar * r *® mt mmm xm-xm &lt;&amp;$* u tam ,$m»m .JLMi®* ^ie:ix no ©s; co .,-i i.o i ^ d &gt;«a. .i*x s^-r Xaoa -it «t*p Ov ^niv'xX’ rtl &amp;k$at T&amp;$tu aaysjQc *$c c?&amp; ©w A RV ®' ;f£!t t ;*r;U •-snox Jiii + i ,f. r,.,^ ^ ^ -- ’ ; - - • •' X o- lelii J s iii*; . s^osa'C^-Uiei'-l-- 410 tam f **t*** *&amp; «« •• • - ^ i£;-: • ivin »h* dm* *U$ ** ***t#**i%** *m. aiX^ «/n Mai M Mm MU v- . .

I began by saying that the position rifch regard to external affairs had already been explained to the-a at our last meeting, but there were certain border line cases which might arise from time to time, and which though internal might have external repercussions. \i these it would be useful to have mutual discussions, during which I would like to give my personal and unofficial advice# Such &amp; case in point was the Bhi*ah agitation, on which for instance His Majesty’s Government might receive representa tions from the Iranian Government, and I asked what was the view of the Council on this matter. 8. ?h© Deputation had no clear views except beyond insisting that Kuwait was Arab territory, and that they wanted it kept as such, free from Persian intrigue and influence, they said that they could not possibly agree to the demands of the Shi * ahs, which had bean for (a) special Shi*ah schools (b) representation on the Council (c) representation on the Municipality Council. 9. I agreed that {a} was a request which the Kuwait Government need not grant if they were not disposed to do so, but I suggested that (b) and (c) might be worth consider ing. A single qhi ♦ ah represent at ivc on the Council could not affect the Council’s decisions, but would give the Shi’aha an opportunity of 'letting off steam', and X explained to them the inadtisability of *8itt ing on the safety valve.'* 10. The Deputation then repeated their views as given above /-5- above, arid said that in any caae the Shi * aha mr$ given a chance to vote at the election of the Council. This it true, but owing to the ay a ten of voting adopted they were not likely to succeed in having a candidate elected. 11. After some further discussion, in which 2 stressed that the responsibility for settling the Shi’ah question was in in any case theirs, the spokesman of the Deput&amp;tion, the new State Secretary, a cadaver our individual named Suleiman al At s ani , reverted to my simile, and exhibited an unexpected turn of mind by saying that they would prefer to keep the safety valve eloeed, but would, however, do all they could to reduce the head of steam by taking away the fuel l At this remark which caused some amusement I brought the discussion to a clone. 12. de Saury tells me that the Council also noid the view, which they could not of course express to me before the Shaikh, that this Persian or Shi’ah problem is a legacy from the administration of the Shaikh, whose Secretary had encouraged Persians to come here. 13. The above discussion I think did good as showing the Council that, though the responsibility for Keeping things quiet is tna .Shaikh’s and theirs, we are not entirely disinterested in the question, and I trust that the movement will now die down. Religious prejudice, however, is ®s you are aware not easy to control, and when complicated by the question of national origin, as in this case, it is always possible /- 6 - possible that therg may be a revival of the agitation* It ia lor this reason that I have described the situation at some length* * sending a copy of this letter to Metcalfe and giving one to de Gauxy.

This is &amp;ix to me good., fou will recollect that in regard to tne date gardens we intend handing over Hi 3 Majesty’s Covennnent ‘s compenBat ion in respect of tax 03 , not to the Shaikh, but to a family council. (c) The 'u-va. 11 revenues, e.g. from Oueto®« receipts etc., verc* formerly collected by the Shaikh who, fresa these, paid allowances to himself and the Suban family. This corresponds to whet in other countries is called the Privy Purse. The present arrangement is tnat tne Council collect tne revenues / l. 2* » H.T.Peel bs quire, The India Office, Xondon.revenues and pay tne allowauoes to tne fUiaiicn and the family. (d) (1) ?he most important feature of the KUvmit State finances is, however, tne revenue from oil, which may in the future assume considerable pro portions, \t Bahrain the present royalties on oil for the Sh&amp;iJch come, as you are a^ware, to about £ 250,000/- per annum, arid tne iU'mit field in the course oi the naxt few years i^xy well produce the same revenueo It was obviously of importance to us to Know what were the Ohailch’s intentions with regard, to tne disposal of this revenue, and X therefore raised tne question with nim* 1 was quite prepared for aim to say, in tne first instance, that ne was going to put the revenue in hi© pockett tne concession is of course between the Kuwait Oil Company and him, not between the Kuwait Oil Company and the council. If he had fcaKen this line I would nave argued, (as personally from myself not from His Maj esty ‘ s Government) that n@ would be well advised to follow the example of GnaiJcn Ha*ioaci at Bahrain and give two-thirds to tne htate (i.e* tne &gt;^unc 11), a nd *&lt;eep one— f hi rd To r his i J rivy fu ra e• Instead of this, however, as you will see from de Gaury* s Mote, the Cau Uh blandly informed me that he was handing over the whole of the December oil cheque to the Council, ae did not volunteer tne inforjaation as to wnetner ne nad made ahV’ arrangement witn tne Council aa to a 'd raw-C ock 4 from /-3- from taei&amp; on thin cneque (a® uaaer (c) afcove) * or w*xetiier ne iutended, to nan4 over future ciiequee jui^ toto in a Xi^e manner, and 1 did not tninic it wiu&amp; to afeic nim tneee question®. If X nad X aa afraid that ue would nave been quite eapaole of infoming tne lounoil that tne id out considered that hi® handing over the whole cheque to tim was unnecessary. (2) hay the ShaiiCh has thus given in to the Oouncil, and with every appearance of sat isfact ion, on this all important point, X realty do not Know. It seems to me obvious that his best tactics (but he is a very poor tactician) would nave been to nave made a firm stand on tne matter of the oil revenues, and to nave struck a fair bargain with the Council by offering to pay tne same proportion of the oil revenue as is done in the neighbouring State of Bahrain. If he had taken this line he would nave been on strong ground. (3) It may be that tne Shaikh thinks that the Council will at some time in tne not too distant future cease to exist, or will lose their power to such an extent that they will become mere figureheads, and that in either case he can avoid paying tnem any money all from the oil revenues. If this Is his idea then X think he iu definitely wrong. The Council, in .my opinion, will certainly continue and always with a certain amount of power, a M having received from him tne December Oil Cheque in /-4- in full, tney #111 fce in a strong position to insist on receiving future oil revenue® in lull.

The monthly supply from the Shaikh was usually rates bad qualityand the family merely resold it for what it would fetch. The Council changed this system which they could in any case hardly continue for reasons of convenience, and which the Subah family disliked, and issue instead a cash allowance calculated according to the cash value of the best quality of the supplies they had received hitherto from the Shaikh.

To The Political ilgeiTt; KUwait. Subject : Kuwait Administration. Uemorandum The following is the result of our discussions which we have had here towards assisting the Shaikh and his new Council in the administration of Kuwait. 2. One of the most important points is finance. Excluding oil, you informed me that the Customs does make up about three-quarters of the State’s income. The Customs administration at present is carried on by an official under the Shaikh, and could probably, in your opinion, be much improved. It would be well worth the State’s while, we think, for it to obtain the services of an expert Customs official to visit Kuwait for a short period, say a month, in order to reorganize the Customs administration, and put it on a modern footing. A Customs official from Bombay visited Muscat and Bahrain for this purpose some years ago, with extremely satisfactory results. The Customs receipts in each State, after inis reorganization scheme had been put into effect, increased considerably. The same results would doubtless come about at Kuwait. In order to assist the work of the Customs official the Council could do some spade work/work first in collecting figures of revenue and expenditure etc., say over the last five years, and any other details which they think might be useful for him. 3. I think therefore that we should try and get an official of the Imperial Customs Service from India to visit Kuwait. On your returnto Kuwait please make this proposal tentatively and verbally to the Shaikh and the Council, and let me know their reaction. If it is favourable I will approach the Government of India on the subject, letting His Majesty 1 s Government know that I am doing this. The deputation of the Customs officer will of course cost the State something, but will be well worth while. If as a result of the Customs officer’s visit the Customs receipts go up, as they should, the political as well as the financial effect should be good. The Council will associate the increased revenue of its State with the efforts of a British officer, and will therefore be all the more inclined to accept a British financial Adviser, which we think the State ought to have. As oil revenues come in, and the finances of the State become more com plicated, the State must have an Adviser of some sort from outside, and from our point of view it is essential that he should be a British official, and not for instance an Iraqi. The importance of the post of Financial Adviser lies in the fact that, since there are few subjects which are not connected with finance, either directly or indir ectly, whoever is app ointed will have considerable indirect influence in political, as well as financial, matters, and might/-3- mignt make for himself a position such as Belgrade holds at Bahrain. It is essential therefore that the Adviser should be of British nationality. v/hile we are arranging for cue Customs official we can also be looking about for a possible financial Adviser, and while I am on leave I will consult the Home Departments. 4. In addition therefore to making the proposal about the Customs expert to the Shaikh and the Council, you could also privately and personally sound Abdulla Salim on the question of an Adviser. As you informed me, before recent events he expressed to you his opinion that an Adviser, like Belgrave at Bahrain* would be an excellent thing.

I note that the Council are getting busy with reform in the Law courts and that they have invited a famous Nedji judge to come to Kuwait for employment. In addition to this they are also employing a retired Iraqi Police Officer to improve the internal administration of the Kuwait Police Force ./jo , 1 (vide your letter No.(*-368, dated the 18th November 1938). V ^ From these steps the council may proceed to procuring a full blown Adviser, perhaps from Iraq* This would be most undesirable from our point of view, but unless we had made a proposal of our own for an Adviser we should be on rather weak ground in opposing the Council’s choice. 1 3. You will remember that in connection with paragraphs 6 and 7 of India Office letter No #P.2.6062/38, dated the 30th September 1938, to me, I had intended taking up the question of an Adviser with the Shaikh and the Council when I was last at Kuwait. You were however of opinion that as the Adviser had been suggested by the Shaikh as a move against the Council, it would be better to leave the question alone for the present. Some time has elapsed since then and in view of the consideration!j I have put forward in paragraph 2 above I think v/e should now make a move* Unless therefore you see the strongest objections, in which case please send me a telegram, you should forthwith approach/- 2 - approach the Shaikh and the Council tentat and verb) informing them that should they require an Adviser we shall be glad to assist them to obtain one. In addition to a permanent Adviser you can also take up the question of a short visit of a temporary Customs expert. Please let me know as soon as possible the reactions of the Shaikh and the Council. Wvvw^ I ‘C-Please refer to your demi-official letter No. C-368, dated the'18th November 1938. I think it would have been better if before replying to the President of the Council you had referred to me.

In view however of the considerations in paragraph 2 of his letter No.657-S of the 1st December 1938, Sir Trenchard is of the opinion that you should now follow up your first approach with a letter to the Shaikh. This should be to the effect that the Resident has directed you to write /) to His Highness that should at any time the Kuwait State want an Adv iaer, whether permanent or temporary, he (the Res ident) will be ^ glad to assist the State in getting a suitable individual. You should go on to mention that in connection with a temporary Adviser, some years ago a Customs expert from India paid a visit of a few months to Muscat and Bahrain and suggested a scheme for the re-organisation of the local Customs administrations which had excellent results in increasing the revenue of these States. It might be that Kuwait would similarly benefit from a similar visit. 3.

                           majlismovement, was the formation of an elected administrative council, and on folio 118, the file contains the names and details of the composition of the first such council that was formed in July 1938. The correspondence is primarily between the Political Agency in Kuwait and the Political Residency in Bushire, but the file also contains a limited number of correspondence with Shaikh Ahmad (in Arabic accompanied by English translations).In addition to correspondence, the file also contains translations of circulars that were issued by the opposition movement, copies of agreements made between them and the ruler and a detailed report entitled 'Administration of Kuwait' that was prepared by the Political Agency (folios 99-120).The file also contains a large amount of translated news articles from the Iraqi press concerning events in Kuwait. These articles are from the following newspapers:
