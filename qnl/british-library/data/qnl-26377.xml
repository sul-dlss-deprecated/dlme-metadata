X SEEN POLITICAL COMMITTEE 8 FEB 19*9 SUBJECT. AFGHANISTAN. Visit of Air Officer Commanding in Chief, India,to Kabul on August 26th - 27th,1939. (11844) Wt.29201/P.295 2,000 9/39 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd. Gp.685 FOR USE BY DEPARTMENT ONLY. The suggestion for a visit to Kabul by the Air Officer Commanding was ■originally made by H.M. Minister in his telegram of July 14th at P. Z. 4369/39. The visit eventually took place on the 26th - 27th August and is described in the A.O.C’s Report flagged at P.Z. 6460/59. As remarked in the Foreign Office Minutes below, the discussions cannot be said to have been altogether satisfactory. Mohammad Ihsan*s three- year plan for the creation of an Air Force of 9 squadrons (i.e. about 100 planes) is obviously over-ambitions - the more so now in view of the fact that the amount of assistance we can give to Afghanistan in this sphere must/Minutes, 0 i,., V .*1 4 , N. 558 ^/b /97 ' prom In dia Ofi'ice WoJ P.Z. 6460/59 ated: 24th Oct: o9 D Received in Kegistry 65th Oct Central Asia 0 £ &lt; s U) i Z Ui £ 5 uj tn o h 0 z 1 h - o z IP Not altogether satisfactory. As regards Muhd. Hasan 1 s own air force programme, this is clearly over-ambitious and not properly thought out; and t iere was apparently no acknowledgment of the very considerable help we have already given in this matter. The same lacK of recognition of past help was noticeable in the Prime Minister f s remarks on the general political situation; and this was being said at a moment when the Prime Minister was refusing our offer of an Anglo-Afghan treaty designed to strengthen the international position of Afghanistan. His professions of aesire for closer cooperation etc. are all very vell; but the Afghans are altogether too grasping. (signed) D. Lascelles. Oct. 26. I agree. They are orientals; and Ihsan, in particular, is very oriental!

We were received formally by the Afghan Air Force and, after a short delay, drove straight to the Legation. Here we had a short conversation with the Minister, who is laid up with phlebitis and unable to leave his bed. He is otherwise able to transact business. 2:. My programme consisted of a talc at 11.30 with Ihsan, the Commandant of the Afghan Air Force, an d an inter view with the Prime Minister at 1600 hours. 3 0 A 'he meeting with Ihsan was attended by Flying u &gt;3 Officer Burt-Andrej*, and the talk covered a wide field. In addition to certain immediate necessities which Ihsan was anxious should be provided by India, and an increase in training commitments, he produced a H Three years* plan” for the creation of en air force of three fighter, three bomber and three reconnaissance squadrons, backed up by an embryo aircraft industry, ne realised that meant a formidable effort on the part of Afghanistan, and hinted that he would require a great deal of help from us. he complained of the lack of training in the existing air force and of a serious shortage of efficient personnel. His principal requests from us were:- (a) training for 70 airmen; (b) 24 new aircraft, possibly Hawker Henley type; and (c ) a lay-out for an aircraft factory capable of the manufacture of airframes in wood and metal, but not of engines. These would continue to be bought abroad. /I replied - JL v, 3URE IN INDIA l ' 0fiEIQN SECRETARY'S LETTER n ° r _QATE RECEIVED / -’ 9 17-10-.I939o _ r i*-. I replied that I would do 'ahat was possibla afa ^^gf^dg techmoa 1 training, but must emphasise our difficulties at the present moment in taking on so 1 argw_ a jfrLtc hg r ^ students* In further discussion, It transpired that the Air Force now depends directly from the King and is no longer administered by the War Office. On hearing this, i spoke strongly to Ihsan on the need for higher training, both technical and administrative, for his sernior officers. I pointed out that, if he was contemplatiing an air force of nine squadrons, the leaders would have to understand very clearly how to use this force. I then recommended that at least three sefnior officers a year should go to gngland to study at the Central Flying School, the School of Amy Co-operation, on H.Q. Staffs and at a technical unit, i also stressed the need for a separate budget for the Air Force. *his dicussion lasted till 13.ID hours, was very frank and friendly, but pointed clearly to the desire of the Afghan for further free training and cheap issues of material of a more modern nature than they had hitherto received. At 1600 hours, I arrived at the Foreien Office* accompanied by the Councillor to the Legation. We were received by the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister. After a very short exchange of polite phrases, the Prime Minister commoiced a long speech in Persian, which v/as subsequently translated into Snglish by the Foreign Minister, ^he gist of the speech was that, for a number of years, the Afghan Government had beai following a consistent policy of f ri end ship with Great Britain. ±‘he Prime Minister and his Minister in London had spoken to a ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S No- DATE 166 7 -- 9 ■ LETTER received 1 7-10- 1939 /number of■■■■■■■■ -3- to a number of important people, not ably iLord Eaa xTa.|, Mr. Anthony Men and Lord Zetland. In e(^ery&lt;Q|t^ th conversations had been friendly and had aroused great hopes that they would lead to concrete developments for the benefit of Afghanistan. Unfortunately, this has not been the case, and, up to the present, little or nothing has been done. He wished to point out that merely to be friends was of little advantage to either country. Afghanistan, though potentially a rich country, was undeveloped, and, in his view, a week friend or ally was more of a liability than an asset in war. Afghanistan's strategical position made it vital for her to be on friendly terms, m particular with the British adminiS' tration in India, ana generally with Great Britain. Afghanistan could do much to help Great Britain, both in relation to the remote threat of Russia and to the immediate difficulties on the Frontier. It seemed to him, therefore, to be in the interest of both countries that Great Britian should make an effort to enable Afghanistan to develop her resources and to become a strong and useful friend and ally. D, I replied that i was afraid I had neither the knowledge nor the qualifi ationa to discuss these questions of higher policy and would prefer to confine myself to what I had understood to be my mission - the examination of the present position of the Afghan Air Force and the making of recommendations for its improvement. I referred to my discussion of the morning with Ihsan, saying that i would do my utmost to help to meet the immediate requirements and would consider what could be done in regard to the Three-Year was interested to see that the Air F&lt;*r&lt;£6l$NadR m j NO. pAIL. wider the War Ministry, and strongly fra&amp;ommended tha^t /Commandant i ei'-i cim — .

JiMWiBWWBMIi - 4 - ' r*. 6460 This cT) 7 / Commandant should be given a separate budgel suggestion ms well received by the Prime ^xn^s uas&amp;d i he was also favourable to the development of 'tf/T communication and raateorological information with India, He continued, however, to keep the discussion on the higher plane, and I was forced to abandon my attempt to brinp* him back to a consideration of the immediate s—■ problem, 6, The infertiew lasted for two hours, ana can best oe summarised by saying that the Prime Minister insisted on a close mutual relationship between dreat Britian and Afghanistan; the need for immediate help to develop the latter's resources and to improve her military position, so that she would no longer be a liability but an asset; an indication that close co-operation and consultation to deal with the Hussian menace would be welcomed; ana that, in the utmost secrecy, the Afghans would combine with us j/ to keep the Frontier quiet. The Prime Minister developed this latter point by saying that he would be quite prepared to exchange xxixxxxxi information through the usual intelligence sources, snd that he woula exert what moral influence he could upon the relisgious leaders, such as the Faqir of Ipi, to prevent them making trouble. He emphasised, however, the fact th£, in *-'vni£ opinion, the continual era: ia is ir tribal territory were merely perpetuating tribal unrest and that w r e should endeavour to educate rather than destroy. I questioned him closely on this point, and he was unable - or unwilling -to be more precise than to say the problem would uxi ne/yer be solved until the tribesmen were made to understand by men of intelligence that there was no sense in continual war fare, When I suggested we might take the sons of leading maliks t and educate them for this- eS^&amp;at tljiese - mYTB FOREIGN SECRETARY’S LETTER No. DATE REC 16* 7- - 9 17 - 10 - 1939 rJf -b- boys would belong to one party, and inmediat0.4 0iQ ot ler parties would be set up in hostility against them. I gather he had in mind that Afghan influence in trioyriWry was not, in his opinion, harmful to us, and, if allowed to develop on the lines which he suggested, i.e, convincing the tribesmen that hostilities were a waste of time, his own interest in a quiet Frontier as well as ours would equally be served. He was most emphatic that nothing would persuade himself or his Government to attempt to acquire a dominating influence over the tribes, and that Afghan influence would only be used to obtain general 7. He did not appear to be unduly alarmed by the Gterraan-Soviet pact, to which he made only a passing reference; but he was fully aware of the importance, in a world war, of a peaceful tribal territory and a quiescent India to Great Britain - and, I think, hoped to profit therefrom. 8. His final remark was 'please convey to His n w\ » Excellency the Viceroy my assurance of the war L friendship which my Government bears to &amp; Great Britain. I know that tk this feeling is reciprocated, and I hope this happy situa tion will long continue.' 9. I left Kabul on the morning of 27th August, Sir John Ej^art remaining for his interview with the Prime Minister, which was to take place at 1100 hours on that date. He proposes to return today, 28th August. Sd/- P.B.Joubert. A.Q.C.-in.C. 28.8.39 H.E. the Ooranander-in-Chief. Copies to: Secy., External Affairs Dept. Colonel Henderson,G.S. Branch. Minister, Kabul.
