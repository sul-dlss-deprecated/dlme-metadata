M’s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum. Reference your Memorandum No. 325 of 1927 dated 22nd April, 1927, enclosing copy of a complaint from Messrs. Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, Ltd. ^ith regard to the ’vest side of Mespers premises, the refuse referred to is being dumped for the purpose of making a surface to the ne*v new road which is being built entirely in order to afford Mespers a direct passage on to the Sea Road. As the work of making the road proceeds this refuse will be used and covered with earth. The space on the west of Mespers is not entirely government property, being partly owned by private people. The government is no# endeavouring to fill in as much as possible, but the work is expensive and cannot possibly be done all atonce. Regarding the east side and Mespers frontage two large culvert arches are being installed opposite Mespers building. On the east side there is a largepage -2 large piece of water 'between Mespers and Gosaibi. A portion of this nearest to the town is privately owned, the rest is Government property. The Government cannot at present afford to pay a sum of A Rs. 20,000/- for filling in a piece of ground which is not required. It is the intention of the Government to sell this if a suitable price could be obtained. Major Holmes, an experienced engineer, who has advised the government on various public works has been consulted by me on the subject of draining the eastern space. In his opinion one culvert arch is required to drain the space, also a drain running from the mouth of a drain which comes out of the town to the culvert will make sufficient drainage. T^e wall of this drain will act as a boundary between MeXspers and government property. Major Holmes' opinion as an expert is that if more than one culvert is made there would be less current and the effect would be less satisfactory. Acting on this advice, it has been decided to install one culvert on the east side and two opnosite Mesuers. Mespers and Gosaibi will be asked to move their latrines which at present drain into the water and foul it. The two large pieces of water opposite the Baladia are drained each by a single culvert. The area is far greater than the pieces in question but the effect is perfectly satisfactory.■ page -3-. The Sea Wall Is a dry wall and the tide comes in through the wall every day and entirely covers the various hasins inside the road. The question of keeping clean the spaces inside the sea wall has been fully discussed 'by the municipality and a proposal has 'been made for the erection of public latrines at intervals along the outside of the road. It is hoped that Mespers will not find it necessary to make any further complaints on the subject of the town’s sanitation. ration Ltd e ,Bahrein, for information, with reference to their letter Max dated the 21st April 1927„ I enclose a plan of the place in nuestion.

M f s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to request your advice on the subject of wording the deeds for Mespers for the piece of water lying opposite to their frontage, inside the new Sea Road. This piece of water, which when filled in will be of considerable value, is being given to the Company by the State as was arranged after much discussion over a year ago. It is given partly to compensate the Company for being now unable^ owing to the Sea Road, to dry-dock their boats on the shore at the side of their premises. It may be remembered that Mespers strongly advocated the building of a swing bridge opposite their premises, to admit their boats, but the Government of Bahrain was unable to agree to this proposal. The proposal as it happens would have been a complete waste of money as an order hashas been made by the Munioipal Oounoil to the effect that all such pieces of water lying inside the sea wall are to be filled in within two years time. document for the ownership of the water, but Hr, Spence, agent of Mespers has requested that the Government should guarantee that the premises should never in the future be any more cut off from the open sea than they are at present, i.e., that no reclaiming of the sea should ever take place opposite to the Mespers 1 frontage. The Government of Bahrain has now no intention of allowing any reclaiming of the shore outside the Sea Hoad nor has anybody any right over the sea outside the Hoad, but in the distant future it is possible that reclamation work may be undertaken outside the Road, therefore I am doubtful as to the expfcliency of giving such a perpetual guarantee as is indicated in the enclosed draft which I have received from Mr. Snence.
