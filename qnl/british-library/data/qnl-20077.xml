U&gt; 35)' I 1 ^ I agi directed to refer to the correspondence ending with the letter No 94-S of 1929 daited the 2nd April from the Hon*hie the Political BesideDt in the Persian Gulf and enclosure, of which a Oopy was forwarded to His Majesty^ Secretary of State for India, on the subject of the finances of Luscat. 2. From the papers forwarded to His Majesty's Secretary of State with Foreign Secretary's letters Nos. 78-M and Sl-M dated the 27th September 192S and 17th April 1924 • # respectively, it will be seen that in 1924 a similar proposal to that now made by the Political Resident for the raising of the tariff was not adopted by the Government of India, though they implied their preparedness to entertain it in the last resort. Their reason was the anticipated difficulty with France and the United States of America in connection with the commercial treaties, guaranteeing the 5 per cent maximum rate, between those countries and Muscat-. ' 3. Muscat affairs have of late shown a tendency to deteriorate. The integrity of the state is admittedly of great importance in view of its position at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, and the recommendation, renewed as it is after mature^onsideration in view of the growing danger of dissolution with which the kingdom is faceci, seems now C a M- ^ for more careful review.lY r\ There sejias lit»t*le cioul)t ttiat* tlis present troulDle in Muscat is laxgely financial) and the Government ol* India concur with the Political Resident that the 'best hope of restoring the Sultans prestige and control lies in a permanent strengthening of his State finances. The causes ol their prGsent weakness are well analysed by the Political Agent. The principal causes are evidently permanent, and there is little prospect of an' ^^iunaided recorery in the normal ehh and flow of commercial prosperity. 5. The tarrif increase suggested as a remedy, namely Irom ^'/o to 7%% generally, and 15% on alcohol ana cigarettes, is slight, and if it were not for the international difficulty, there would seeni to 'be little room for hesitation in adopting it. The extant to which opposition from Prance and the United States of America is to 'be apprehenaed is a matter on which the Government of India are hardly competent to judge. They trust however that those difficulties will not oe found in^urmountahlei indeed there seems reason to hope that America at least ( though Prance m .y make soma difficulty on political grounds) will noi seriously object to a slight raising of the customs duty fixed over three- quarters of a century ago at a rate which « tbe light of modern tariffs, appears trivial. The financial interests of 'both countries in the proposal is 'beleived to be negligible. 6. If His Majesty's Governiiient agree, the Resident will he asked to approach the Sultan with a view to his formally requesting His Majesty's Government to approach the French and Americam Governments on his 'behalf in the matter.

From To The Becretaty to the Hon'ble the Politictil Resident in the Peroian Gulf, The Political A^ent, Muscat. Sir, With reference to your letter No. 46-C, dated the 5th April 1930. The Hon 1 ble the Political Resident is proceeding on ^our to-day and has directed xae to reply as follows. He sees no prim facie objection to the extension of the debt period mentioned in paragraph 4 of your letter , bat before e^pressin^ a definite opinion he would like to know why the Muscat State acts as a debt collecting agency on behalf of creditors against members of ihe ruling family? Has the system grown up gradually, and if so how . old is it? Some of the items in Ur Thomas's list are under the heading of court, which presumably means court decision^ but the greater majority of them are not so shown. The merchants are of course encouraged to go on lending money to the members of the ruling family, since the State collects their debts for them by cutting them out of the family allowances. Is there any reason why this system it should continue ? Would^/not decrease appreciably the undesirable activities of the money lenders if an announce ment were made that after the liquidation of the present debts of the ruling family, no more debts would be cut from their allowances, and that the debtors would have to seek their\Y' -hi -2- their relief direct frow their clebtjoro? 2. with regard to the general reduction of 15&gt; in all the ruling family allowances, the Political Resident, while recognising the urgent necessity of increasing the fUate revenue, is adverse at present to this measure, viiich would certainly be very unpopular with the Sultan. 3. With reference to the new one rupee stamp duty for Bills of Lading suggested by iir Thomas; as you make no mention of it in your letter the .^ol-tical Pesident preuumes you see no objection, and. on xhis assumption he agrees to it. 4. With regard to the Inland Post Service (paragraph 7 of your letter), suggested by ur Thomas. The Political Resident wishes me to ppint out that it is quite impossible for him to express an opinion dn this project on the information supplied by you and Mr 'liomas. The following points ooQur to him : (1) Between what places will ohe service run? (2) How will it be carried: car, camel, dhow, etc? (3) What will be the initial expenditure ? Staff, office, printing of stamps, etc. ? (4) What will be the recurring expenditure ? (5) How is the Ko. 2000 estimated revenue arrived at ? I have the honour to be. Sir.

I received Thomas 1 letter No. 25 of 22nd March the day before he left for Khasab whilst I was ill in bed. I did not therefore have the opportunity to discuss the matter fully with him as I would normally have done, and as the question appeared urgent, I did not feel justified in holding it up till his return. 3. The question of the debts of members of the ruling family was brought to my notice shortly after taking over the post. Khan Bahadur Soofi prepared a list of the debts for me, a copy of ^hich I gave to Colonel Prideaux Hiilst in Bushire. I w as also shown a notice ^hich had been issued on the subject, I think in 1920. This notice earned merchants that they would get no assistance in recovery of debts unless at the time the debt ^as incurred it ^as endorsed by the Council of Ministers. On questioning Thomas I gathered the Tali of Matrah had been weak about endors ing some documents but as it appeared to be only a question of time before these debts ^ere ^iped off, I did not proceed further ^ith the enquiry. 4. / I found that the same procedure existed in the case of the Muscat Infantry; the sepoys pay being subjected to similar deductions on behalf of the money lenders. I induced the Council of Ministers to issue a notice that the pay of these men ^as not liable to attachment and dre^ the attention of British subjects to theto the provisions of Section 60 of the C.P.C. where- upon the evil ceased, 5, My attention ^as next dra^n to the question in 1928 when Saiyid Abbas came to complain that all his allowance ^as going to creditors and he had no money to buy food with. Thomas was then on leave but I directed talker who was Acting Finance Minister that a moiety of such allowances should not be attachable by these money lenders. On his return from leave, Thomas came to me and complained about Walker^ action. I replied it was taken under my instructions. On this occasion Thomas* arguments seemed to be all in favour of the money lenders. I was somewhat surprised at the time but since Thomas has a habit occasionally of argu ing merely for the sake of argument I thought no more about it. 6. Unfortunately I have been unsuccessful so far in tracing the copy of the notice, referred to in para 3 above, in my records. Some days ago, I sent the Munshi around to the Tazara to see if they could find a copy in their records. The following day I called on Saiyid Said to discuss fJwadur affairs and during the course of conversation Saiyid Said volunteered the information that the Munshi had been around and he would try and find the notice in question. He said that in view of the notice merchants would not no^ advance money unless the document was endorsed by the Finance Minister; sometimes he did so and sometimes he did not. I there upon decided to investigate these debts further and called all the creditors who are British subjects and examinedI&amp;i vl IT examined their documents. , $ou&lt;^U 7. Although Saiyid*=« remark was not strictly A accurate, the result has been astonishing. Evidently 'besides being endorsed by the Ministers individually, documents have been endorsed officially by the Chief Kazi, Isa bin Saleh and by the Assistant Kazi, Mahomed bin Saleh, and such endorsements have been given freely as required. Debts have been collected by trie Treasury and paid to creditors whether the documents ^ere endor- sed or not. T^o of the documents have been endorsed by Thomas and by him alone. Most of the documents are of recent date. It is obvious that the object of the order has been flouted and the intended cure has been worse than the disease, since now a certain amount of respos*' ibility for incurring these debts rests on the Council of Ministers. 8. With a responsible British Officer as Finance Minister I naturally never imagined such a state of affairs was going on. It is obvious that Thomas has not been doing his job. I shall not be able to answer your letter No. 192-S fully until Thomas* return, but mean while I thought it best to inform you of the result of my investigations. T0 The Hon'ble Lt-Col.

The anticipated deficit for tne remaining montns of the year, due to circumstances entirely oeyond tne control of tne State, i.e. tne fall in tne collar, is us. 25,000 (para_2 of Mx. Thomas's letter). It would be inadvisable to carry out tne suggestion made m para 3 of tne letter under reference, (i.e. to levy Customs lozties payaole in dollars at tne pre vailing rupee rate of exchange) for tne reason given in i^r. Tnomas 1 letter para/TZ .

Thus if the date harvest, political conditions, etc., are normal the budget should balance on tne 51st of j-&gt;ecemDer. Tnough., as will oe seen, this did not Happen m 1^29. 4. To meet tne anticipated deficit aJT . Thomas originally made four proposals ( paraVTT of his letter)• proposals 1 and 2 have not been imposed for tne reasons given by j^r. .Thomas, witn wJaicn I concur. 5. proposal Z canno^t be expected to onng anytmng in this year, retails as to tms proposal are given in i^ajor kurpny 1 s letter ^o.lo-C of tne 3utn 1950 para 3 and 4. 1 recommend tnat sanction oe given to bring; this proposal into force in due course. 6. To Proposal 4 - as pointed out in your predecessor's £ letter xio. of tne 17th. April 1930 para 2 - the political Resident is averse. I venture to observe that personally I am entirely of the Resident's opinion. The measure of control already adopted v .'ith regard to tne Ruling family's debts (vide paraTX of i^r. Thomas' letter, and also correspondence ending v/itn my letter i^o.82-c of the 1st July 1930) nas already raised a protest from tne members of tne jpamily. The imposi tion of a 'cut' in tne Ruling family's allowances would oe very unpopular with all the family from bultan downwards, and mignt onng tne latter a step nearer ms long threatened abdication. 7. To meet tne anticipated deficit tnere are two courses open to us. One is to enforce proposals 1, 2 and 4 wmch will3. oring betvieen tjaed Rs.E^SbU per mensem^not^'itnstanding tne serious objections against tiiem. if tnese could be put into force witn effect from tne ist August, during the redaming five luonths of the year they would oring in Rs.14,250, Ihis would still leave a deficit of Hs.10,750 which would have to be raised by equally unpopular measures. 8. Tne otner course, as proposed by aj :, Thomas in his para , is not to put tnese proposals into force but to apply to the government of xndia for a progressive moratorium of six months for the remaining refund instalments { Ks.iii,745 half yearly} due on tneir loan to tne State of 6^ laichs. That is to say tne instalment due in December next will be paid m »june 1931, the one due on tne latter date will be paid in December 1931, and so fortn. i strongly recommend for tne resident's consideration that tnis moratorium be asiced for. it will oe noticed tnat, as jar. ihomas points out, the atate has been exemplary in paying up its instalments, and considering that the present financial stress in which the State finds itself is due to a cause - the fall of the dollar- quite outside its control, 1 do not tninJc it unreasonable to suggest that this small concession might be obtained from the Government of India. i have the honour to be.

Public works ^0 1^0° Anticipated savings Deficit 25000 Detailed comments on the above items are given in Appendix 1. Had the dollar exchange not fallen there would have been no deficit on the year's working. This deficit arises from Customs and zakat taxationhaving at present to be collected in dollars e.g. Sur and the Batinah coast . The political situation in both places militates against the tax collector insisting onon collection in rupees or en the rupee parity. Two dollars today have approximately the equivalent rupee value of one dollar this time last year. To demand two dollars this year j\rv u*v-i leUvc*. as is suggested, on a. package of dates ere one A was ieruandecl last year is in a tribal area where dollars circulate iv exclusively,,to cause discontent and possibly invite resistance Orv for naturally whoever pays Oustoms duties passes them A 'to the tribesman. Nor is the alternative of taking customs in kind a remedy. The reverse is the case for Customs Officials in tne se far flung territories are necessarily underpaid and therefore corruptahle :they have no necessary staff to handle collections in kind, and if they had its expense would defeat the ohject now sought. Moreover it is know$ 'by experience that leakage from collection in cash is less than that from collection in Kind. The assessment of goods for customs collections along wild Arah coasts is not a rigid system, and varies necessarily with localities. 'For instance the collection of Customs duties at all I from the Yal Sa f ad ports of Musana and Suwaiq. (Batinah) dateA from 1922 and then only when it was imposed 'by naval guns.

This is graphically shown Appendix 11. I would still request sanction for proposal (111) though it is too late to profit by it this year. The yield shown is conservative, IX As regards proposal IV I note disapproval of the Hon. Political Resident to this measure.

Sir, { jU 'jf y I hare the honour to infite a reference to my letter No # U2, dated loin Jannary 1930, forwarding for the information of the Goyernaent of India a copy of the Muscat State Budget for 1930. 2. In that letter 1 pointed out that the budget was an unsatisfactory one in as isuch as it depended on several items which were liable to fluctuations while it proTided no margin to Meet such fluctuations. In Tlew of the fact that 1 had ^ut recently assumed charge then and had at that time other pre-occupations I did not make any attempt at detailed criticism. 3. In April last however, lajor Murphy, the then Political Agent, brought to my notice that the fall in the value of the dollar was causing much apprehension to the Muscat State authorities and had entirely upset the equilil»rius of the Tiudget estimates? rv. -2- •stiaateBi retrenohaent in «xpenAiture was therefore neeessary 9 and lie eubjai'tted. certain proposa.ls &gt;)y Mr* Tkosas to reduce expenditure and to increase the rerenue to a certain extent. Correependence ensued regarding these propesed measures 'between the Pelitical Agent and myself and finally I aslced Major Fowle when he assumed charge to examine the whole position and to request the State authorities to submit refised liudget estimates showing the economies contemplated and the actual position of the Statet taking into aecount the depre ciation ef the dollar. This Major Fowls has done and I forward a copy of a letter addressed to him by u. c Finance Member of the Muscat State submitting rerised estimates. 4. la his original letter forwarded T#y Major Murphy regarding the anticipated deficit the iinaiice Minister submitted as a possible method of meeting the present srieis the measures mentioned in paragraph 7 of his letter. He now explains that measures No.l and 2 are no longer feasible owin^ to the general slump in trade the critical position of many or the lerci a s# The third proposal was that the State shoula introduce an internal postal serrioe; fair weather tracks are now being constructed in certain portions of the State and meter Tehieles are beginning to come in and I see no reason why the State should not introduce a simple Internal postal serrice if it is considered desirable. The proposal howeTer is not calculated to assist the present position since some initial expenditure will hare to be incurred and it will certainly be some timeQfcJ -5- time before a profit is shorn. 5. The Finance Minister^ fourth proposal was that a out of 10 or 15 per cent should lie made in the ruling family allowances# Family allowances are a vexed and delicate question throughout the Arali littoral; in Bahrain they amount to bo less than 50 per eent of the total rerenue of the State} in Muscat thsy amount to al»out one third including His Highness* oiril list* There is no doubt that any suggestion that they should )?e reduced would Tie strongly opposed by the Sultan aad might precipitate his al9dieation t which I hare hitherto endearoured to stare off if possible* Major Fowle shares wy apprehensions and is Tory averse from this measure at the present time* For some time past a system has Iseen in rogue in Musoat under which members of the ruling family obtained loans from merchants^ the repayment of which was guaranteed by the State from their allowances* Orders were passed some years ago that this system was to bs abolished, but these hare been more honoured in the breaeh than in the ohserranoe and the result is that the State now pays out to mer chants every month some 50 per eent of the family allowances. I considered this system was open to serious objection and asked the Finance member to take steps to stop it| as Mr.Thomas mentions in paragraph 9 of his letter, this measure has already evoked protests and 1 do not think it would be possible to go further at the present time. Thus it will be seen that none of the four proposals originally put forward Tiy the Finance member are feasible now.-4- After ecoBomleB amounting to Rs,29,600/- hare *6en effected the State is »till confronted with a deficit of R».25 f 000/- and until sanction is accorded to the increase of the custoaui tariff there are no means aTaiIal»le from the existing resources of the State of proriding this sum. As Mr* Thomas points out f the fall in the dollar exchange is due to causes outside the control of the State; it has affected countries with rastly greater resources than Muscat, notafely Persia, and the present position of this small principality is therefore, I think f deserring of sympathetic consider ation* The State hare therefore now ^een compelled to ask: the Croyernment of India to grant them a moratorium for six months in the repayment of the delit* The history of this loan was 'briefly summrised in Sir Lionel Haworth 1 s letter Ho.T.1-35/87, dated 27th Hoyem- her 1927 and in their letter No*D*3419-H, dated 29tk February 1928 the Goremment of India accorded their sanction to the proposal that the repayment ef the balance of the loan should he spread orer a period ef 5 years instead of 2k years, and under this arrangement the loan will he extinguished Igr the 1st of Jane 1932« If the present request of the State is sanctioned it will he extinguished hy December 1932. Though the time originally fixed for the repayment of the loan has had to lie extended twice already! X think it can fairly he contended that on the whole the State, haring regard to its Tery slender resources v has made erery possible effort to liquidate its liabilities* The balance now outstanding is not large and should the increase in the-5- the customs tariff be agreed to at an early Aate by the Powers concerned it will, I hope, not lie necsssary to ask for any further extension, and the additional funds thus obtained should enable the State to liquidate this loan on its due data.

Mr. Hedgcoc^s report reveals a serious state of affairs, S' and a different one to that presented in Mr» Thomas* letter L No.8/32/48 of 20th July 1^30, forwarded to you under my letter No.88—C of 21st July 1930» In the latter I naturally 'took Mr. Thomas 1 figures to he correct^ one of the main reasons of Muscat having a British Financial Adviser is that his reports, on which Government depend for their information as to the financial position of the State, should be reliable* It is obvious that the Political Agent cannot do the work of the Financial Adviser as well as his own. 3. Briefly-Mr. Thomas showed an anticipated deficit of Rs. 25,000 at the end of 1930 (vide para X of his letter quoted above), and stated that if the December instalment ( Rs.21,746 ) of the Government of India debt were postponed no deficit need appear. This postporment was accordingly asked for, and obtained, vide correspondence ending with your endorse-* ment No.508-8 of 19th September 1930. Mr. Hedgecock on the otherhand, who also allows for the postponement of the instal ment of the debt, shows that the outstandings on the 3lBt of December 1930 were Rs. 1,35,879 made up of deficits on the working 1930, and on the working of the previous 2 years . If( these figures do not include the balance of the Government of India loan amounting to Rs.77 &gt; 841.) In other words Mr. Thomas in working out the deficit for 1930 did not take into consideration the deficits of the two previous years^ nor apparently was his prognostication for the working of 1930 by itself# Measures to meet the deficits* 4* It is clear that immediate steps must be taken to meet the financial crisis. These steps can be broadly divided nto two partst (a) Economies in State Administration. (b) Raising of Bevenue. Mr. Hedgecock and myself are closely considering(a) and ^Ateroposals will be submitted as soon as possible. I have seen U p i IaM a■ the largest merchant creditor Khan Bahadur Nassib who is owed about Rs. 84 &gt; 000. He is prepared to wait for his money s in act there is no other course open to him • The other merchants H will also have to bi&lt;t their time . ^ c^Si) ii. An important proposition under (b) is that contained ;.n the letter from the Council quoted above. The Council, pending their consideration of the revised treaties with France and America, ask His Majesty^ Government for permission i.o increase the import tariff rate at an early date. This proposal has my support, and I venture to suggest that urgent . permission to that effect be asked for from Government. The proposal in principle is the same as was dealt with in cor*» ^ despondence ending with your telegram No.213 of 3rd March 1930 'v;ki ) '.o the Political Agent, Muscati and which was finally negatived .n that telegram. The main argument which led to the dropping of this proposal - i.e. that it might be more difficult to obtain later the consent of the Powers concerned to an in crease of tariff - Ao longer holds the same force. Both the rowers concerned, Prance and America have agreed in principle ''to the raising of the tariff. ( Vide letter from the French *oreign Office to the British Embassy, Paris, of 15th October*■ A 1 h S \Oln 1930, and correspondence 'between the United States State Department and the British Embassy, Washington, more partic ularly State Departments letter of May 23rd, June 16th, and June 11th 1930# The last named is particularly to the point. Tariff of 1Q^ &gt; 6» It will be noticed that the Council's application is for an increase up to 10% and 2.5%, instead of the and 15^ originally proposed. Mr. Hedgecock informs me that rather than ask a rate in the first place and then find it inadequate he would prefer to ask for the 10% increase» even though further examination might justify the imposition of a rate lower than this. In this connection I would draw attention to the statement of the Council that they are pre pared to be guided by the advice of the Political Resident. 7. If His Majesty^ Government concur in this proposal then it seems to me that the simplest way to meet the request of the Council would be, with reference to Article 6 of 1891 Treaty, to grant temporary and emergency permission for the tariff to be raised* But whatever may be the exact wording of the sanction it should in my opinion contain the following jstipulationsi (1) Permission to raise the tariff on imports to 10% on general merchandise, and 25% on cigarettes and jLlcohol, for Note* If^any reason it is considered inadvisable to grant permission twygrawt for the 10% and 25%p then the lower rate of 7^% and 15% could be granted. (2) It should be understood that no tariff increase should be made on goods brought in French and American vessels pending final agreement with these Powers. Note. This stipulation is contained in the Council^s own re-drafting of Article 6, 'subject to his treaty obligations to other foreign Powers', and is necessary in view of the Stated commitments to France and America. As it is only goods in French and American vessels to which such commitments apply, and as French and American vessels never visit Muscat, there seems no reason( why this stipulation should not be made* j Muscat State and United States - 8» Though I have not yet approached the Council as to the United States' proposal for most favoured nation treat- mentj vide my letter 5-0 of 6th January 1931 para 2,1 think it is extremely probable that the Council will have strong objections to this proposal^ which in their eyes may appear as a demand for 'something for nothing' * It is not unlikely that the Council will only be prepared to grant to the United States most favoured nation treats ment only as far as tariff duties are concerned # ( Any rights already held by the United States in their Treaty of 1833 would of course remain.) 9. It is necessary to consider whether the probability of the Council assuming this attitude should prevent Eis Majesty's Government from giving the permission outlined in paras 6 and 7 above# I aim not of opinion that it should* Having given this permission His Majesty*s Govern ment would be in the strong position of having made a generous gesture to a small, weak and struggling State* France&gt; having expressed her willingness in principle to the rise in tariff, and having already got equal rights with us in Kuscat by her existing Treaty of 1844 would no doubt be prepared to be equally generous* If United States stand out they will appear in the unenviable light of a big xtzmag ^ower pressing a small Power to get someting which the latter is not prepared to give* If finally either the Unitea States or Muscat give way, the situation resolves itself• If neither give way then goods borne in United States* vessels only pay 5^, and United States* vessels never come to Muscat# It is just possible that a United to otateg vessel might be chartered /trade with Oman and so take advantage of the lower rates, but this is extremely unlikely. 10. As far as our interests are concerned I have already expressed my views, vide my letter No. 86-0 of 15th July5* as to the effect on our position in Muscat if United States were to get full most favoured nation treatment from the Muscat State* I have the honour to be^ Sir, Your most obedient servant. c - Major, Political Agent &amp; H.B.lPs Consul, Muscat*To P,A. 3c 1 9 Consul, Muscat.

Rs 9,77,700 Expenditure at Rs 9,77,700 (which included two half- yearly instalments, each of Rs 21,750, of the G-ovx. of India loan,) The real positionwts less satisfactory than these figures indicate. There were on 31/12 /f9 undisclosed outstanding State liabilities to local merchants and others of approximately Rs 75,000; the exact amount cannot be ascertained, as under the existing system of accounts dates are not always inserted. These outstandings first began to accumulate in February 1928. In add!t I on, the sum of Rs 44,645 was due to officials and others on account of pay and allowances for December: the cash in hand to meet these claims amounted to Rs 31,290. The total net State liabilities on 31/12/29 were thus Rs 88,355 approx., exclusive of the Government of India loan. 2, a. T ie accounts as maintained by the Ministry of Finance ^ive, accordins to the figures presented to me, the results on last year's working as below: Receipts Rs 9,51,859 Expenditure. .9,52,000 Prima facie, the State just about managed to make ends meet last year. The account books, however, are no true guide to the actual position; the explanation is a surprising one, or would be if one's capacity for surprise were not already exhausted. Revenue paid in dollars and baizas is brought to account at the 'oCficial Treasury rate of exchange' (Rs 125 = ^loo). This bears no relation to the current rate of exchange', but is, in the words of my Treasury afficer, 'the rate which was in force when I took up my post two years ago'. Today's exchange has dropped to 08 ?100. The :a-,h balance on paper thus never corresponds1. with the actual cash in hand, a fact which does not disturb my Treasurer's equanimity, b, I have had a second set of figures worked out at tne average monthly current rate of exchange. These show: Receipts Rs 8,46,174 Expenditure..,. 8,44,204 The above figures give a more accurate idea of the sums actually received and spent, but they do not reveal that ths State's liabilities to local merchants and others had increased b, about Rs 41,577 during the course of the year, 3) Tne -tate s liaDilities on 31/12/30 were as under: (a) Due to local merchants etc. (for details see Appendix A) (b)1. Due to officials etc. as pay for December Rs 48,470 Cash in Khnd to meet December pay 29.168 [arrears of revenue are negligible) Net deficit under this head~197302 Rs 1,16,577 Total outstandings on 31/12/30 19,302 1,3^,879 I 4) Of the outstanding liabilities of Rs 1.16,577 mentioned dboveai, Rs 84,145/5/0 is owed to Khan Bahadur Nasib: for detai„3 Appendix B.

The draft budget for 1931 . as aubmitted to ^ on ^ roue^hly revised by myself, provides as under: Estimated recei ts R s 8,45,000 penditure 9.23.775 Deficit,. Rs 78,7753. b. Estimated receipts are based on last year's actuals. For further particulars see Appendix C. Estimated expenditure is also based on las^ year's actual expenditure, and will be found roughly to correspond to the sum of (a) cash actually expended (b) last year's deficit (c) Lhe second half-yearly instalment of the Govt of India loan, for which a postponement was secured last year. Fuller particulars are given in Appendix D, As 41 cheesecparing econoiaies' have been the order of the day for the past few years, it is difficult to see at a first glance how substantial savoys can be aade in expenditure. Adequate increases in revenue can only be achieved by imposing new taxation. An increase in the customs rate is under active consideration; this question will be made the subject of a separate report. 6) Working to the above budget, the financial position at the close of the present year will be: Deficit on the year's working (see para.5a aoove) Rs 75 775 Net outstanding liabilities as on 31/12/30 (see para.3) 1,35,879 Total deficit at end of 1931 Rs~ 2,14,654 The cibove figures do/l not include the balance of one Govt, of India loan, amounting to Rs 77,841. 7) It must oe emphasized that the system of accounts here make it impossible lo guarantee any of ohe figures. It may, however be safeiy assumed that the state of Muscat's finances is sub stantially as Siiown aoove. 8) I hope oy next week to put up tentative proposals for remedying matters.

' The Dollar Exchange. 1) As I find myself at variance with some of the views expressed 'by my predecessor on the question of the fall in the dollar exchange, I think it advisable to place on record where I differ from him, and my reasons for so differing. It will 'be sufficient to take two extracts from the correspond ence on the subject. 2) ' Had the dollar exchange not fallen there would have 'been no deficit on the year's working. This deficit arises from Customs and zakat taxation having at present to he collected in dollars, e.g.Sur and the Batinah coast. The political situation in 'both places militates against the tax collector insisting on collection in rupees or on the rupee parity. Two dollars to-day have approximately the rupee value of one dollar this time last year. To demand two dollars this year, as is suggested, on a packet of dates, for instance, where one dollar was demanded last year is in a tribal area where dollars circulate exclusively, to cause discontent and possibly to invite resistance, for naturally whoever pays customs duties passes them on to the tribesman.' (para III of No.032/48 of 20/7/30). In the first place, the argument contained in the latter half of this extract appears to me a specious one. If one dollar customs duty was demanded last year on a package of dates, the customs rate being 5^,the cost of the package works out at ^ 20. Total cost is thus ^ 20 plus duty - ^ 21 0 This year,owing to the fall in the dollar,the customs duty payable is stated to have risen to ^ 2, from which it can be calculated that the dollar value of the package of dates is ^ 40. But as, according to my predecessor, it would cause discontent and possibly armed resistance to demand &amp; 22. ^ 2 where ^ 1 was demanded last year, the duty remains at ^ U That is to say, the total cost to the merchant of a package of dates is 0 40 plus 0 1 customs duty ^ ^ 41. It seems to 'be imagined that though the merchant can pass on the increased dollar cost of the commodity, amounting to 0 20, an attempt to pass on the extra dollar of customs duty may cause the tribesman to resort to his rifle. The ahove extract was written as an argument against the Political Resident's proposal that customs should 'be levied at the prevailing rupee rate of exchange. The arguments are redundant, for the simple reason that the duty is, and has 'been for the past ten years at least,levied at that rate. The truth is that, the duty heing 'both in theory and in practice ( as I have ascertained) on an 'adjvaloreuT 'basis,the fall in the dollar exchange has had no direct effect on the customs receipts, and is 'by no means the primary cause of the deficit on the last year^ working. The decrease in customs revenue can in the main 'be attributed to Q.uite a different cause • the fall in world prices. 0) The second extract reads as under ••The interior currency in Oman 'being predominantly dollars,the apparent purchasing power of the country has fallen with the price of silver some 18% during the past three months. Whether or no this is the case the State itself with largely a rupee 'basis for its expenditure side must face losses on exchange' (No.25 of 22/o/o0) The purchasing power of the 'bulk of the inhabitants is made up,not only of silver dollars,hut also of exportable natural products. Of each tribesman it -can in general be said that this purchasing power is represented by so many sheep, camels, or date palms, and, if he resembles the Arab of other countries, a comparatively small amount of money. Hence the diminution of his purchasing power due to the fall in the3. the value of the dollar has 'been relatively small. The same may he said of the country as a whole. Oman uses two silver currencies,of which that represented 'by the rupee has remained constant; further, the drop in the dollar has 'been spread over many years, thus enabling merchants to adjust themselves to a rupee instead of a dollar standard, as many have done. Speaking generally,though individuals may have 'been hit,the country itself has escaped more lightly. There are even indic ations that the purchasing power of the country has improved, 'but these need not he discussed here. The contention that the State 'must face losses on eichange 1 * also needs qualification;^. The State, working on a rupee 'basis,can make and actually has made a useful profit through the fall in the dollar exchange. Part of the district staff is engaged and paid on a dollar 'basis; the actual sum involved is ^ 29,500 per annum. It has cost the State ahout half the number of rupees to pay these people this year, as compared with last year. Customs contribute 5t lakhs of a total revenue of 84 lakhs. These,'being on an ad valorem basis, do not result in any loss on exchange. A subsidy of nearly two lakhs, paid in rupees, similarly occasions no loss. The remaining items are all received in rupees,except zakat ( land revenue as distinct from export duty),part of which is paid in dollars. The amount being so small, the loss on exchange is comparatively insignificant. 4) Though unwilling to go so far as to state that the Treasury has definitely profited by the fall in the dollar exchange,! think that this fall can safely be classified as a minor,not a major calamity.0 (0 0 ^ a Telegram: From: To; Repeatel: Dated: R.

S »28 /l# Ministry of Finance, Muscat, 28th January 1931. To The Political Agent &amp; H.B.M'b Consul, Muscat. Government of India Loan . 1 ). Owing to the fall in world prices, the customs receipts which are Oman's chief source of income have suffered a severe diminution, with the result that the Treasury now finds itself in a position of acute embarrassment. Last year it only managed to pay one half-yearly instalment of the Government of India loan, and that 'by borrowing locally. This year the position is even worse. The State owes over a lakh of rupees to clamorous local merchants, cash in hand is so reduced that the pay of officials, soldiers and others cannot 'be met until nearly a month after it falls due, and the 'budget for the coming year shows a deficit. 2). The present position of the Government of India loan 'is shown in Appendix A» . It will be seen that Rs.77,841 remain to be paid in final settlement. If the Government of India insists on the repayment of this year , s two instalments, it will either accelerate the disruption of Oman, already too imminent for administrative comfort, or force the State of Muscat into the unfortunate position of declaring its inability to pay* 3). In order to obviate these alternatives, I have been authorized by the Council of Ministers to ask if you will take up the question with the Hon'ble the political Resident and request him kindly to obtain an extended moratorium from the Government of India. I would suggest2. /a si that the present outstandings of Rs»77,841 'be funded, and that the Muscat Governnent pay a fixed interest per annum on this sum, until such time as it is in a position to contemplate capital repayments# 4). The above suggestion is, at best, a palliative. In order that the State may emerge from its present condition of bankruptcy, more substantial assistance will be needed# I suggest that this should take the form of a iQamfrom the Government of India. The sum I have in mind is Rs.l,50,000. The purposes to which this loan would be put are considered in the following paragraphs# The financial position of the State is as under:- a). Due to Government of India Rs# 77,841 b). ' ' foreign creditors ' 9,951 c). 11 ,, local h 1,06,500 d). In addition, the State is so hampered by lack of ready money that it cannot introduce more effective measures for increasing the revenues, and thereby easing the financial situation# 6)» It is suggested that the proposed new loan should be employed as under (a) The conversion of the existing Government of India Ilimn. AS interest rates are now so much lower than they were when this Imh . was first granted, the Muscat Treasury would benefit by the proposed conversion. The sum required would in round figures be Rs.77,000# (b) Foreign creditors- Letters and telegrams are constantly being received from these, pressing for an early settlement of their outstanding accounts. The Looai-would enable such r creditors to be paid off at once. The sum required would be Rs.10,000. -\vP 3» (c) Local creditors* It might restore the Governments prestige if these people were similarly paid off, but this would only be done at the expense of converting an internal into an external loan# On the whole the effect would be more wholesome if these liabilities were steadily paid off from surplus revenue# A too ready repayment will tend to encourage the State again to borrow and the merchents again to lend* No part of the proposed loan would therefore be employed for repaying local creditors# (d) The State's financial recovery will be impeded if its attempts to economize and to put its ^revenue machinery on a more effective footing are handicapped by a completely empty Treasury.

The real difficulty in the wajr of drawing up an accurate budget is that the customs dues are on an M ad valorem* basis, and it is impossible t© whether prices have reached rock-bottom or will decline still further. There is therefore a large eleaeni of uncertainty in any estimates that may be framed. 4 •••; - 2 - 4 # The Government of India hare authorised the state to obtain an orerdraft of half a lakh from the Imperial Bank of India to meet immediate requirements. L .Hedgcock informed me that he did not think it would be necessary to obtain an oyerdraft just pt present, but the power to do so was very valuable# Hitherto the state had had frequently to have recourse for assistance to -'iian Bahadur Kasib for ready money, and this would free them from this necessity, and he considered it very much preferable to obtain a regular overdraft from a bank than to become indebted to a powerful local merchant. 5 # Orders have not been received as yet regarding the reduction of His Highness 1 allowance. His Highness has disappeared and no one knows where he is. He wrote to f&amp;d sayin, that he intended proceeding to Ceylon, but giving no address, and sayin^, that he would write again when he returned to India. His Highness deals with a French bank in Bombay, but his bank too do not know his address, ^e can therefore but wait until His Highness returns to Dehra Dun,in order to ^et in touch with him again. I would however request that early orders should be issued regarding the reduction of his allowance. rhe Financial Adviser hopes to bring about certain reductions in the family allowances with the co-operation of §cujL It will enormously strengthen the latter's hands if he can point out that the Sultan's allowance has also been reduced. 6 # Mr. Hedgcock anticipates that in view of the Sultan's prolonged absence, it will probably be necessary to increase allowance to some extent either directly or indirectly in the form of an entertaining allowance, ....3 allowance, but in any case if the reduction i have proposed is sanctioned promptly there will be a saving to the state of about Rs.40,000 this year. The tariff question will presumably take some time to settle and for the reasons stated above I consider it essential that the reduction in the Sultan's allowance should be effected without delay. I would therefore ask that separate orders should be issued regarding this. rf u / g regards debts due to local merchants referred to 11 paragraph 3 of my despatch referred to above r. iedgcocK considers that the sum due to Khan Bahadur Nasib will be capable of reduction. There is no doubt that the prices . wru ch supplies have been issued are in certain cases exorbitant, and it is hoped that it will be possible to reduce the Khan Bahadur * s bill from Rs.86,000 to about half a lakh. ^n any case he has amassed much wealth at the expense of the state, and there is no particular reason why he should not wait for his money till a more convenient time, if necessnry. q # 8 regards customs dues Mr. Hedgeock informs me that he is not in favour of a uniform tariff and considers that the duty on articles comprising the food of the poor should only be increased very slightly, while luxury articles might be taxed at higher rates with a maximum of 2S^ on alcoiol a: tobacco. He was anxious to obtain for the state full tariff autonomy and then to draw up a detailed tariff, ^ith t^i« view I am in agreement. i 9&gt; Jx, Hedgeock has already discovered many administra- tire anouelles in the state, of which I will only cite a fe.. examples. The 'Al Said' has a crew of 25, and it is only fair sized launch and could certainly be run by a much stbs . 11 er personnel. There is a prison in uttrah and another in Muscat, each with a certain n mber of watchmen, anu in ....-4- in each of them there are only about two priaonero. They could obTioueljr be combined. The state hae a dhow which is at present on the beach at Muscat. It has no crew but there is a who draws R b .38 a month for nominal conuaand and resides in Muttrahj there are many sinecures of a similar nature. The abolition of such posts would enable certain economies to be effected. Moreover the fertile district of Sohar only contributed Rs. 1,800 to the central treasury last ysar. The .&lt;ali ie a brother of His Highness and has adopted a contumacious attitude towards the ouncil. -here jS doubt that this area should produce a much larger revenue, even after the expenses of administration have been deducted. 10&gt; The chief expenditure however which Mr.Hedgoook has attacked is that of the Levy Corps. The levies are undoubtedly well paid, and the rates of pay drawn by them are high.compared with those, for instance, of the state askaris in Sur and outlying posts. I was given to understand that these rates had long been regarded as a grievance by tne State Council, and Mr. Hedgcock contemplate^ a drastic reduction in them. The matter had formed the subject of prolonged discussions between iir. Hedgcock and Cap ain Walker and the Political Agent, and I was informed on arrival that an agreement had been made between them under whioh a reduction of about R8.21,000 would be made in the expenditure on the Levy Corps. Captain talker, however, a agreed to this under the very strongest pressure, and because he iiad been told that the financial condition of the str was desperate, and he had placed on record that the proposed cut must detract from the content of the corpsj tht t it remained to be seen how it would affect dieciplineJ he anticipated that ••• mmf -5- to t a considerable number of men would cut their names and that though recruits would be found to replace ohem, tne staiiaard of physique, already poor, would sufler. 11 # The Levy Corps, as the Government of India are aware, have done extraordinarily good work of late; in addition to their normal duties they have made roads and proved a valuable asset to the state. Captain alker informed me that owm^ to the fact that they were well paid he could with conlxdence call on the Corps at the present time to do any kind of work and -hey would respond readily# He felt that the cut proposed was excessive and that there would no longer be the same spirit in the Corps. Taking these circumstances into consio erat i on - could not help feeling that Jr. Hedgcock after a very short experience in the state was proceeding a little precipitately and 1 therefore told the Council and him that, in my opinion, it would be preferable to make a smaller cut in :ht iirst instance. It was ultimately decided to reduce the sepoys 1 pay by only. Hs.2 and other ranks proportionately and to reduce the ol some of the non -military personnel of the Corps| at tht •ame time a sum of R b .6000 has been provided from the re -armament of the Corps. 'he net results of these measures is to effect r ■avin Lj of about Hg # 12 f 000. I think this is sufficient for the time being and that it would have been a pity to have gone further in the first instance. Captain .Valker informed me that he did not consider that these reductions would in any adversely affect the contentment or morale of the Jorps. my deapatcii dated tlie January 1931# I forwarded a review by Uedgcoolc of the financial posit i m of the state. In this review Mr. Hedgcock showed the liability of the state at Re, 1,35,000 and estimated a deficit on the current year 's working at Rs.78,000. As mentioned above it is hoped ...hoped to reduce the liabilities to merchants by some R b «30»000, and therefore the net outstanding liabilities should not amount to more than a lakh. As regards the current yea^s working, if the allowance paid to His Highness is reduced as recommended by me there will be a saving of about Ks«40,000: and a further saving will be effected in the cost of the Levy Corps of about Rs.12,000 making a total of Rs.52,000 and reducing this deficit to Rb # 26 # 000. If the state is granted tariff autonomy and if there is not much further fall in prices, Mr, Hedgoock anticipates that the enhanced customs dues will bring in an additional sum of about Ks.50,000. It is hoped also to oake some reduction in the family allowances, to obtain appreciably more revenue from Sohar and some increase of revenue from 3ur« it will be seen that these figures are based on various hypotheses, and it is almost impossible to draw up any accurate estimates but the combined effect of all these measures should be to convert a deficit of Rs.78,000 into a credit of about Hs.50,000. i-t is for this reason that I have stated that while the finances of the state do call for a drastic re-organization and prompt application of remedial measures and the situation is undoubtedly serious, yet in my opinion it is not desperate, and I hope it may be possible so to re-organise the finances that the State will be at any rate solvent if not prosperous* If a year hence a further fall in prices or other causes have prevented the budget being balanced the matter can be reconsidered* 13* Mr* Thomas has at length turned up at Bahrain having crossed the Ruba-al-Khali and travelled from Dofar to ^rtar* This is the first time I believe that this j oarney * * *journey has been done by a European, and it will doubtless have interesting results from a geographical point of riew. ./hatever may be 8aid 9 however, for Mr. ^0^8* journey - from the point of view of exploration and science, and though one cannot but feel some admiration for his endurance and (V courage - his journey could perfectly well have been poet- V' , poned until he had relinquished charge at luscett and handed over to his successor, and his action^ in proceeding without leave and leaving his successor to grapple with a new situation unaided is indefensible. Moreover there is not the least doubt that his administration of the finances has left much to be desired and that the greatest laxity hae been all owed to prevail. 14.

It was ^eu ^ralij/ appreciated taat. as Uie State vran in debt, and as its monthly income fell short of Gxpenc '.iture^ aoiue reductions in paj or staff would nave to be iaado. Retrenchjient was not i^de suiy ziore welcom® by being admitted as necessary; but w ;en it beoa ie clear to those likely to feel tne axe of econoiay that the Muscat Infantry was to be includec. in the pro^rathat re ductions were not to b- acie blindly or v ^iere they could Lioat easily I v. eflcctvst. # but ia accordance with a scale jrt a: ted to .i.cet the difftrent pi j irrc/je of the der&gt;art- si nts, I round the uiole .ta ot phei e cLar^ed, The roacl seeiaed open to a course of action I hi-xl not hitherto conteapiuted, na.ieiy an all-round cut in pay, including the allov .ances of the Hull ig Family. Peeling ^ v .ay ^-long this ro.id, I oa ^.e to the conclusion tnat ?/ith care and caution sucn a course would be possible, and that a pro^ra m of retrenchment, embracii'^ an ajil-round proportionate cut and tne abolition of non-essential osts, would enable tne budget to be 'oalanced by savings alone, thus leaving any increased revenues available for the liquidation of unt 3i oe 's fjMWctM* debts. The ^.udcesr, of this schene c,&lt; p ended, as I e ^phasi^-ed froa the outset, on my being able to obtain a fairly bubstantial reduction in tne highest paid braiich of the Ad inistration, namely the Muscat Infantry.A policy of retrencii^ent had an additional attraction. By this tine I had begun to realize that the proposed increase in the tariff ^ould not yield the results expected, for the following reasons: (a; There Trac no indication that the falling prices, which insulted in last year's revenue receipts falling short of estimate a by P.s J, 34,646 and of actual collections in tiie previous year by Rs 67,564, had yet rc achec'. their nadir. On the contrary, a-cording to the saali Chaaher of Cooaerce recently set up by the Council of Ministers at ay su-sestion, prices still show a tendency to drop; the fail m the price of rice, Oman 's '■y bl 8S RBt Item of i.nport, is partionlariy marked, i.e. September 1930.... Rs la per sack January 1931 r s B / la February 1931 .... Rs 6/3 « « The ^crease in i a8 t year 's customs ■' &lt; ceipts would have been much greater tajj ' lf the^drop in prices had begun at ginning of the year instead of in July, and (11) 1/ there had not been an abnormal in.fli6^) Finding the proapecte of increased revenues less and of substantial savings more hopeful than I had originally anticipated, I decided lo make the latter the main plank in my financial platform. In reaching this decision I was influenced by the fo^lowins considerations. (a) An all-round cut in pay would not only produce v aluable accessions to the treasury, but would secure thea sooner and with more certainty thaA the proposed raising of the customs tariff. (b) As mentioned earlier, the rate of pay of government - - in certain departments, employees was, on the high side. (c) The appreciable fall in the cost of living Justified a reduction of salaries, (d) Such a reduction was further justified by financial necessity. The State was in debt, for the last trtiree years its budgets had not balanced, and there was the additional danger that if the Sultan abdicated the Government of India might refuce, because of its own pecuniary difficulties, to continue the arms subsidy of one lakh p.a. ( e ) It was sounder policy to reduce the cost of govern ment than to take extra money from the tax-payers 1 pockets to pay for an unnecessarily expensive adminis tration; this was also the line of action preferred by the Council, (f) The savings now made would affect all future budgets, TJie anticipated savings were large enough Cods an adequate return for the time and labour spent in securir^ them, and for any odium incurred, but not so large as to produce real hardship or discontent, ^^ Last, and most important, time and circumstance were favourable, and so suitable an opportunity mi ^ht not occur a-'ain.The Levy budget was exaiained with the utmost care and diligence, and after full discussion a compromise vf'is reached which represented the minimum reduction which in m^ opinion iffould enable mo to put through the proposed retrenchinant scheme. The Stated military and financial experts, the Political A^ent and the Council of Ministers having ail agreed, the matter was forwarded to tne Hon 1 hie the Political Resident. It is, I believe, only within the last few months that the liusoat Infantry has be«n considered as the close concern Ox the Ooveniment ox' Indian it had pre-' viously been regarded as a domestic affair of the Muscat Govamment, .»;iich, as its revenue a and the danger from tne Imam decreased, ha^ by decrees reduced the numbers of/ the force fro^ 3u0 to 150. If ioi 3 . nuatoera and rates of ^ay ai-e henceforth uo be fixed ^y the Indiar. Government, the ability of tne St; te of Kuscat to balance itw^ budget is a^^fected. The ^ue ^tion has an important financial bearing, and it seema desirable that the matter should be carefully reviewed by both governments. As I under strand the .oeitxon, tne price the Brttiah Q-overnment agreed to p^y for the eu.pression of the slave and arms traffic - acx.a which caused the Sultana of fean pecuniary loss and weakened their authority - was is.; an ams subsidy of on^ laich per annum, and (b/ the defence of Liuscat and .iatran againat all comers. In 1013 the Government of India fulfilled ita obliGation - ^ under (b) by landing a battalion to defend Muscat and Juatrah against the Imam. On a treaty being made, the battalion was withdrawn, but until it was aeen how well€ Ik'' the terras would be honoured Its place was taken by the present Levy Corps, The State has hitherto .^et the clala ^h-at it should cooperate with the Government of India in its o n defence by spending one and a naif lakhs p.a. on this snail corps d 1 elite. i 1 or nine years tlie Icaam has scrupulously observed his treaty, even in areas where the State maintains no levy forces or where it exercises only a nominal control, as Sur. La pending bankruptcy now coia ^els the State to ^ t ask il the Muscat Infantry la^easential for the defence o' Muscat and Matrah. If it is, see (b) above, if it i nou, 3,u;&gt;idd one Council be oompelled|to aaintain a 'orce, m their opinion too highly paid and too numerous, enf the State against a danger which they consider for all practical purposes non-existent? I -ention this oint as on me falls the responsibility o; evolving a budget that -in balance.

Just iS the contentment of the IbO levies had to be con Idered, h .^d I to consider that of the other 700 e -Jloyees of thr State, To reduce these far lower paid e- iioyees at t ie sr ^e percentage rat 4 ) as the gjcz hl ^lily paid levies ould rob ny retrenoh ^aent prosraaiae of the one quality vfhich m-' £ it ;x)visible - that of equity.

He finally advised us to maKe a reduction of R.s« 12,000/-, but at the same time we agreed that if the financial position of our State requires more reduction «e should ask for a further reduction in the next summer for instance# 2, In conformity with the advice of the Resident we accept the budget estimate made by the Commandant but in view of the letter which was submitted to us by the Financial of iauscat State which is attached herewith we see that the financial position is more serious than v.e thought before at the time of the arrival of the Resident and under the circumstances we are obliged to ask for the iurther reduction which was promised to us beiore the time which was fixed previously# TT#E#h y • l • Finis try of finance, I'us cat, iiSth February 1931. To Ti'ie Jouncil of Ministers. Subject;- Budget 195x . A.C. i) The provisional budget submitted to your Honours shortly after niy arrival Aas as under: Estimated receipts xis ,a,45 ,000 11 expenditure 9,23,775 Deficit 78,775 The above figures represent the actual revenue and expenditure for i930, except that the expenditure for 1931 includes a second half-yearly instalment of the India loan. 2j Since that date it has been possible to examine the financial position much more closely. From statistics gradually collected during the ^ast t^yo months, a systematised budget has now been worked out. The totaJs for 1931 are; Estimated receipts Hs. 7,74,000 H expenditure 8,64,000 Deficit 90,JO0 Assuming that the usual two half-yearly instalments of the Government of India loan amounting to Rs.43,J00 are not jjaid this year, the deficit is Rs.47,00u. 3) Decreases in revenues are expected because of (a) Falling prices (Hice, Oman's chief import, was its. 12 in September last and is today H b .6/2) (b) Marked over-importation in 1930, which will be off-set by under-importation in 1931. (c) The fact that the big drop in prices in 1930 did not take place till July, thus affecting only the latter half of the year. These factors are already at wor^, as is shown by the actual revenue collections for the past two months. At the present rate, the decrease on last year's collections will be .vS. 1,10,000. Increases in revenue iia.y be expected from the enhancement of the customs tariff, but because of falling prices and other2. considerations these will not be nearly as high as originally estimated. Increases from 3ur will be cancelled by the cost 01 tixe operations# A -i -lowing lor all the aoove faciOx's* the estimated revenues for 1931 are Rs.7,74,000. 4) Expenditure will be less than in 1930 because of: (a) The proposed cut in Kis Highness , pay (b) A reduction in the Levy budget (c) Reductions in other departments. Allowaing for the above, the estimated experxditure for 1931 is ^s.&gt;-,64,000. 5) ffrom the above it will be seen that the State of Muscat is faced with an anticipated deficit oi As.47,000 on this year *s budget, without making any provision for the repayment of the oalance of the Government of Inaia loan (Hs.78,000) or of the State's debts to local and foreign creditors, amounting to about l^ laichs. 6) The only advice I can give Your Honours, ii you wish to have a budget that balances, is to ma^e a second cut in -he expenditure of all Government departments, over and above the reductions already mac-e or contemplated. od/- b.E.HedgcockVI f 0 ! / i D.O.lTo^ei-Cj; L- p.'—V si i^t ish Consulite &amp; political Agency }'USC£.t,the 11th March 1931. /7/&gt;/i/ . i|AL »E00jD| 'siuuo-r /• Reference your D*D»-lsFo»34--S of 31st Jiniury 1931* I have consulted Mr, Hedgcock and the following ere the various forms of revenue taken by the State (A) Customs Import dues, 5% ad valorem.

As, however, the interior is not under the effective administration of the State the latter take it on the goods when they enter the coastal towns, (whe^ther the tax is taken on animals is doubtful. This point is being further enquired into). Most of these goods »fe for export and so to this extent Oman Zakat is in a way an export due, but some are for the local consumption of the inhabitants of the town and coastal regions. 3. Perhaps by excise duty - which you mentioned - is meant poll tax. 4. The supposition of the Resident that the system of taxation I is not uniform throughout the Muscat .Territories is quite correct. In fact it so lacks uniformity that Mr. Hedgcock informs me that nobody seems to know exactly what the system is. The above, however, represents the main taxes. 7%c.

It ia however desirable to oive the Council a reasoned reply to their requests, but i^ impossible for me to do so on the iragmentary figii T ^3 that have been supplied to me piece-meal hitnerto, and some of the items I am quite at a loss to understand. fould you therefore kindly ask Kedgcock to let you have a revised budget, showing receipts and expenditure under major heads. In this budget the following economies should, of course, be taken into account: (a) reduction in the Sultan's pay (b) reduction in Levy budget (c} reduction in ruling family allowances cifiu other departments, if any. And account should also be taken oi increased income that may be expected from (a) Sohar; (b) Sur and (c) increase in the customs tariffi which it may be assumed will be sanctionel in the next two or three months.

In round figures the original budget bringing it down to about Rs.1,20,000.

Hedgcock is demanding a further saving of Rs.10,000, bringing the budget to Rs.1,11,000. Walker seems to me to be on very strong ground in the statement in paragraph 13 of your memorandum Ko.83 -v of the ^ r )th March 1931, in whicn he states that he has actually cut down the budget to the figure originally demanded by Hedgcock, although he has only effected a saving of Rs.11,000, but according to the above figures, he has actually effected a saving of about Rs..20,000.

As regards your recess, 1 am sending you by this mail a letter about the fAuscat finances in general and the Levy budget in particular# I think it should not take Hedgcock very long to produce the figures, but I do want you to examine them carefully as the fig res can, of course, be made to prove anything, and he m:y try to paint the position in unduly gloomy colours in order to strengthen the parti cular case which he is trying to prove. I should be glad therefore if you could examine these figures very carefully and send me a reasoned statement before you proceed on /■ recess.

While at licihi 1 cilecuttsea the mud cat (^ueotionb ({enprally with the foreign Hecretary though in the &amp;x absence of detailed figures 1 wa« not in a j^oeition to submit any concrete proposals. Mr Howell took tne view that a cut In men's pay was a serious natter and was inclined to think that had the proposal to re&lt;iu«e the pay of the men by ns. 2 been referred to the Uowrnntnt of India it ^uxd probably not have been sanctioned. however, as 1 had arranged the niatter locally, he did not propose to interfere, and generally he saw e^e to eye with rae in this matter, namely, that while we were quite ready to assist hed|;cock to the best of our ability by effecting every possible economy r in the leview, it was not a watter in which we should move too fust; ne agretra V j &gt;« cut already made was adequate for the tir*-being but that we were of course quite ready to consider the wattar further later on, if this economy proved inadequate. ^hile we felt the force of talker's argument that it was undesirable to Itave men serving alongcicve each other on different rates of pay, we felt it rai^ht ultiniately have to be fiacert as a reduction of pay in tht case of new en trant s Major 'r.C. w. ij 'owle, i.a., 'Political A|tent, Muscat, C/o he Pos twaster, Karachi.-2- entrants seemed to be the only feasible solution of the problem. In view of the faot that a large number of the men are away on furlough and the Commandant is normally on a two-months 1 recess, I recommended that no successor should be appointed to Walker for four months, and this was approved. This will effect a further saving of about Rs f 5 t 000 and therefore we shall have agreed to a saving amounting to Hs.17 ,000 against Rs.21,000 asked for by Hedgoock. He must admit therefore that we have met him very liberally. I consider that in the circumstances his resignation displays quite an unreasonable spirit, and a complete failure to recognise the support that he is receiving. On^ one point he seems to be under an Illusion: in his 'Levy Budget! precis of events' of which he sent me e. copy with his private letter,dated the 27th -larch 1931, he states that the sanctioned strength of the Corps is 150* this, as you know, is not the case. The sanctioned strength of the corps is about 240 and it has been reduced from that figure to the present strength without reference to the Government of India, and we feel that a halt should now be called} the State have always objected to the corps; the Sultan tried to get out of having a Levy corps when it first started, and naturally when they find the Financial Adviser determined to out down the corps as far as possible, they greet the proposal with enthusiasm. As regards the proposal for a loan. Hedgeock suggests that we should ^et sanction for it, but thet the Council may or may not accept it. You will, I am sure, realise that it is not for He^gcock to apply for a loan but for the Council; it is quite impossible for me to go up to the Oovernment of India and ask them to sanction the loan and then to bo told that the Council do^t want it, and I do not think the matter should have been submitted to me in this form. I think Heflgcock has shown himself temperamentally unfitunfit for the post of financial ACivieer at Jiuecax. he is inclined to rueh his fences and hie action in throwing in his hand because he haa not got exactly what he wanted, has impresaed me very unfavourably. 1 feel we want lor the pest scmeone with a more pliant mind and less a^greseiwe. % I do not think 'Iraq really is a very £&gt;000 training ground. An officer used to rigid administration carried on on regular British lines is naturally somewhat aghast at the less regular methods in vogue in MUBciat, but those of us who have served in Indian states realise that simpler and more L primitive or, if you like, more irregular methucis frequently work Just as will in practice. Alban has already acted as Political Agent at M uf cat , and alfto filled the combined posts of financial Adviser and Commandant of the Levy Corps, and I lub quite convinced that, he would be a great success there. He knows everyone in the place; is full of keenneae and zeal, and I think would run the place on tne right lines. I should mam very much like him to act in your absence provisionally as iTinancial Adviser ana then possibly when you went back to Muscat, he could stay on as financial Adviser and Commandant of the levies. r ihi&amp; wouxd be an ecoaonic arrangement for the state: he has already done the two jobs in Wingate's time and, I believe, could combine them again. . oince cralting the above I have jubt received your memorandum forwarding hedgcock's resignation. It e:a ises trie impression I had already formed: he has obviously lost his temper because he has not got exactly what he wants and is nuw sulking. we really cannot have a financial Adviser who XBoysmi complains to the Council aboutI tit about the attitude of what he calls the Government of India 9 actually aytelf, and I think the sooner he goes the better, I hrre Just received your private and personal tele gram of 23rd April. I see your point but I think the issue will have to be faced. ./e cannot have at Muscat as Financial Adviser an officer who informs the state that all their difficulties are due to the unsympathetic attitude of the British Government. I think you might let Hedgcock know the view taken in Delhi about any further reduction in the men's pay^ which I have given above. This will anyhow show him that it is not likely to be approved. If he goes, the matter is settled and all is well. If he reconsiders the matter, then I think there is nothing to be done but to advise the Council to accept his resignation. As long as he is there relations between the State aind the British Government are bound to be bad. He is ouviously sulking, and will make no effort to improve the Stated finances, since this will prove his case. It would be better to get rid of him and then t work gradually to undo the mischief he has done. As regards Alban I agree that while acting as Political Agent he should only advise, as you will see from a copy of my despatch to the Government of India which I am sending you. If you hold out to i&gt;aiyid Said the bait of being in executive charge of the finances f it may make him think better of keeping on Hedgcock. k /ml....ntUX that the psy of th. l.Tl.. shoald be r^ao.d, end he demanded from the Comoandant a reduction of Se.21,000 In the Leyy budget, but etlpulated further that the baele pay of the eepoy, whioh wae fixed at K b .30/- P« r 'fi'sem, muet be reduced by He.6/-, contending that othereiee he would be unable to oall on other deprrtmente to make eeerlfioee.

The reduction of expenditure during the current ^ar will amount to about Rs. 15,000, i.e. Rs. 10,000 permanent reduction and Rs. b # 000 owing to absence of Commandant.Copy forvrarded to the Political Agent, MUBcat, at Karachi, for information, reference his letter kg . 114-C, dated the 14th Aprtl 1931.

Sir, I hare the honour to invite attention to ny letter No.99-S f dated the 5th March 1931 t regarding the finances of the Muscat State. 2. In paragraph 12 I referred to the review by Mr. Hedgeock of the financial position in which he had estimated a deficit on the current year's working at Rs.78 t 000 and I expressed the opinion that if sanction was accorded to certain measures recommended by me • notably a reduction in His High ness* allowance and the grant of tariff autonomy to the state • the deficit of Rs.78,000 would be converted into a credit of about Rs. 50,000. I have now received iJr.Hedgeock* s revised budget and it would seem from that that the fitiures I gave were too optimistic. 3. In his revised budget of which I enclose a copy, Mr. Hedgcock estimates a deficit on the year's working of Rs.94,000 and this is after taking into consideration the savings that will accrue from the reduction sanctioned in the Sultan's allowance and from the economies recently effected in . • •n/ -2- in the Levy Corps budget* 4. The yrlnolpel reason for tiJ.s state of afflttrs is the unprcoedented fall in the oustoxos reoeipts* iAxriti^ the month of ^ebruazy they were down over b 9 10 9 000 as oioaparod with last year* s figures and i£r«ii&lt;*d 0 oock has estior^ted a total deor ass for the year of He.BO1000 under this one head, Another factor which has further aggravated the situation is the presence of large stocks in the hands of the merchants. Apparently, last year when pricee first bs^an to ^ase 9 the merchants 9 not suspecting a world drop in prices such as has oocurred 9 bought heavily in anticipation of a rise in prioes 9 ana they are mmm consequently now saddled with these surplus stocks of which they will h&amp;ve to dispose before placing fresh orders, -he figures now supplied by Mr. Hed^cock hare been obtained only with s good deal of difficultyt they only v ive totals under oach head and no expltmations of any differences from the previous figures are ^iven so that a proper scrutiny of them is inpossible. Thsy Are however necessarily based on various hypotheses which by their very nature are necessarily uncertain and 1 hops that by more careful organisation it will become possible materialiy to increase the custoias receipts and other sources of revenue and to effect still further economies in the administrative services. Nevertheless, it seems certain that on the year's working there will be at any rate a small deficit and it is cle^r that the &gt;tate is not in a position to pity off the instalment of the Government of India loan whio^. falls dus this ysar. The Council hsve therefore asked for a postponement of this year 9 s instalments of the 10fm 9 and I support their request.

As I have already explained in my letter No.202-S of the 22nd April 1931, matters have reached an impasse^and under present ccnditions it is unlikely that any further reforms will be introduced^ and for this reason I would ask for an early decision to the proposal contained in my letter referred to above that the resignation of Mr# Hedgcock should be accepted and that Captain Alban when he proceeds to Muscat should advise the state in fiiiancial matters.

Levy Budget . 2. The original Levy expenditure xor 1930 shown to the Political Resident during his visit to I'uscat was Rs.1,40,331. The cut of Rs. 12,000 which the political Resident agreed to would have brought the budget dov/n to Rs»l,2ti&gt;831» 1 r. Hedgcock, hov/ever, objected that one item of Rs.4,000 (deots) shown as expenditure in the Rs»l&gt;40,83i, was not actually expended anu. should be deducted iron the expen^i L.ure Dexore comparisons of reductions were made. This was accordingly done by Captain jalker and brought the expenditure down to Rs.1,36,831. Mr. Hedgcock also objected that a sum of Rs» 4^500 expended on the horses of the Ruling i'amily in 1930, was not a proper charge on the Levy, would not be included under Levy in 1931 (vide my letter Ko.S3~C oi th ^ ai ch 1931, para 3), and should likewise be deducted. This further deduction brought the actual expenditure for 1930 down to Rs.1,32,331 from which the cut of Rs .12,000 had to be made. 3. To effect this cut grants for rearmament were reduced by Captain v/alker. Further savings under e^^c iish*en* 12. rw were iaade ox the nature indicated in ^ara^ra^h. 5 of my J ^ r i fv letter quoted above, with the result that the 'budget ^ ^ &gt; submitted by Captain Walker (attached to my letter) came to Rs.1,21,321. This was accepted by Mr. Hedgcock. A further saving of Rs.1,417 on pay of followers and reduction of Levy horses and ^3.^,000 on men discharged and not to be . replaced until after the leave season has been effected by / 4/ ji/ Captain walker since the submission of the budget, reducing X the letter to Rs.1,18,^14. / 4. ffiX, Hedgcock in his letter of Ist February 1921 s .nt 4{. r- to the Political Resident under ray letter N0.27-C, dated CfK f-K- S I ■ \1!cithe 2nd February 1931, originally agreed to a total expenditure for 1921 of Rs. 1,21,000 (vide x -ara 12 of my letter already quoted), and the present Levy Budget (Rs.1,18,914) io less than this by Rs.1,086.

A [X/- 1 1 arcil 1 9 21, Mr. Hedgcock, however, now aska for a 16% of the average sum expended on the Levy during the last 2 years (Rs.1,22,920) which works out at about Rs.1,11,000/-. 5. From the budget of Rs.1,18,^14 can further be !( ' If, fs&lt;f.

'.That with days to prepare for the Id and d^ys to recover from its effects, all offices are closed from April 24th to I'.ay 5th. I have utilised the time to have private talks with various merchants- in particular on the subject of the possible effect 1 ^ of the proposed Tariff enhancement on trtde. Mabai is not the danger it once v/as a^ the landing charges there have recently been raised. All, however, fear a diversion of tr^de to Sur unless that port can be put under effective Customs control. The co-operation of H.B. i:'s tavy will thus benefit not only the ?uscat Treasury; it will safeguard the livelihood of the Fuscat and Katrah merchants of hom so many are British subjects. 2. Rice has fallen another six Annas per ^ack and sugar is expected to fall because of large imports of Russian sugar into Karachi. Revenues continue to fall, but the decrease might have been much more serious had it not been for the remarkably rapid growth of the dried fish export trade with Germany. So far this year 52,000 sacks (approximate value 2i lakhs) have been exported. This, in its turn, has lea a % loud wails or. the part of the r.atrah inhabitants at the appalling increase in 'fish stinks 1 '. I have looked into the possibility of converting B4/am into a purely fish ^ort, but lack of money at present forbids anything of a constructive nature.I v%i\0 ' i 'Hris ^.r-rr t S-SinSN't GOVERNMENT OE INDIA.

As regards reduction of eatabliBhment y I entirely agree with the riew expressed by talker that, if the leries are to retain any value at all as a fighting force, the minimum strength should be IbO, and this opinion is shared by Fowle and Alban* Once we get below this figure they really lose their entire Talue. 1 hare arranged with Alban that ai^y men cutting their names during the next four months s]mll not be replaced and at the end of that period the matter could be reconsidered and we shall know better how we stand, and it may be possible to replace them ty men on a lower rate of salary* This should permit of some further economy, but I would again state that in ny considered opinion it is not adrisable to reduce the leries to below 150* The real cause of the tfuscat troubles of course is the fall in commodity prices and the consequent drop in customs receipts. Hedgcock has so far only attempted to meet this by reduction of expenditure; it is the line of least resistance, but there is another method, and that is, to try and increase the revenue* The first thing is to get tariff autonomy for the State. X see you have Just sent a telegram home on the subject and I will try and hasten this matter when I get to London* The increased tariff should produce a substantial sua. The second means of increasing revenues is by tighter control of Sohar and Sur* The former province - a wealthy date garden district remitted to the Central Treasury last year Hs*1900 * an obviously ridiculous sum* It should produce very much more and Alban is going to see what can be done this year when the •*•3- the dates ripen* Sur should produce something more and iiaiyid 3aid Intends to go there himself personally this sun/aer while Alban has suggested haring a sumner oamp for the Leries there, as it has a much better climate than llusoat and a spell of about three or four weeks would probably do the men good; it would also support the authority of Saiyid &gt;aid and familiarise the people of Sur with the presence of a Muscat force in their midst* Finally, Fowle thinks that the allowances of the royal family are capable of considerable outs without creating difficulty for the State* Saiyid Said naturally refrained from these somewhat unpopular measures as long as the question of Hedgcock f 8 future was undecided 9 but Fowle discussed the matter with him before leaving Karachi, and he did not think there would be any particular difficulty about the matter* Of the four items I hare recapitulated the revised tariff and iiohAr should produce substantial sums, while Sur and the family allowances should assist though not to the same extent* I To sum ups Fowle and I both feel that Hedgeock has given the Leyy budget a wholly disproportionate Importance* He has ohosen to make it a test case and to fi^ht the battle on this issue* Some further reductions may be possible and the number of men could be reduced temporarily during the sumrjer by not filling the vacancies of men who cut their names and they could probably be ultimately replaced hy men on a lower rate of pay, but I do not think that the strength of the Lefy should be permanently reduced below 150* This however is not the only remedy for the present situation and we are of opinion that the revised tariff ****tariffs tighter control of foliar and Surt a-rid a out in -c family all0¥»nc68 would yield much batter ana largei results. Alban however hae been Instructed to eubmit a report on t t financial situation ae soon a» he gets to Muscat, to go into the question of the Levies andthen to explore the possibility of the different sources of revenue.
