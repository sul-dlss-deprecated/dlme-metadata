RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO DQIvilDIONS Kashmir The Kashmir situation dominated events during the month. At the outset hopes were raised that a settlement might be possible. At a meeting at Delhi on 27th and 28th November a formula had been discussed and it had been agreed to resume consideration of the matter at Lahore on 8th December. Thereafter however the chances of'an agreement receded. Sardar Baldev Singh,.Sardar Patel and Mr. Nehru all paid visits to Jammu and heard stories of alleged atrocities committed by the Moslems. Mr. Liaqat Ali Khan visited Rawalpindi, where he found the Azad Kashmir Government very reluctant, under the influence of their steadily improving military position in Kashmir, to consider any solution which did not provide for the establishment of an impartial administration in Kashmir and the withdrawal of the Indian troops. He also heard atrocity stories. 2. Consequently at the meeting at Lahore on 8th December a deadlock on Kashmir was reached. Both Dominions accepted the proposition that the tuture of the State should be settled by plebiscite as soon as the situation permitted. But the Pakistan Government were not prepared to appeal to the tribesmen to withdraw and the Moslem insurgents in Kashmir to stop fighting because they knew that they would not be obeyed unless an impartial administration v/as to be set up as a preliminary to a plebiscite and it was clear that Moslems in the State would be safe. The Government of India maintained their right, by virtue of Kashmir's accession to the Indian Dominion, to restore order and maintain it during the plebiscite. They were also reluctant to sacrifice Sheikh 3* The tension was much increased by the deterioration in the position of the Indian Forces in Kashmir. The onset of winter made / the- —received the Pakistan Governments reply to their note of 23rd December, they submitted their complaint to the Security Council* Financial Relations * At the meeting at Lahore on 8th December referred to above agreement was reached between the two Dominions on a number of important outstanding questions* Pakistan’s share of the cash balances of the old undivided Government of India on the date of partition was agreed at Hs,75 crores, instead of only Rs*20 crores. Pakistan's share of the uncovered debt was agreed at 17wfo, to be paid in Indian rupees in fifty annual payments of principal and interest* The value of all pensions in issue are to be capitalised and the liability shared in the ratio agreed for sharing the uncovered debt, Pakistan’s share of military stores is to be one third of the stocks held on 15th August. In addition to the sterling assets to be transferred to Pakistan under the Pakistan (Monetary System and Reserve Bank) Order, it was agreed that Pakistan should be allowed to buy additional blocked sterling up to a limit to be ascertained by an agreed formula. Agreement was also reached on the question of the treatment of property belonging to refugees. 7* Subsequently an Indian Delegation visited Karachi for preparatory talks with the Pakistan Government on sterling balance releases. It was agreed that a system of separate accounting for foreign exchange earnings and expenditure for the two Dominions should come into force on 1st January. 8. These agreements encouraged hope that, despite the deadlock on • Kashmir reached at the same meeting, a settlement on Kashmir also might follow, but these hopes were stilled when, at the subsequent meeting at Delhi on 21st and 22nd December, the Governnent of India made it clear that they were for the time being not prepared to implement the agreement of 8th December so far as it related to the transfer of Rs.55 erores cash balances until the Pakistan Government ceased helping the Moslem forces in Kashmir. /J unagadh4 ' /'N Junagadh In Junagadh the situation was more static, but some looting and arson of Muslin property took place and the Pakistan Government alleged that life was being made intolerable for Muslims in the hope that they would leave before the plebiscite which the Government of India propose to hold under the auspices of either a British or Parsec judge* The leader of the Provisional Government declared that any attempt by the Nawab or his heirs to return to the throne would be net by stiff resistance. At the end of the month the Governor General issued an ordinance vesting in the Administrator of Junagadh all the property standing in the name of the Nawab, including bank deposits and Government securities, the total amount of which was Rs.12,900,000. 1C• om.mma 1 311uatirn » There was little communal trouble during the month. few incidents -were reported from the Punjab, and the western part of the United Provinces. There was a recrudescence of stabbing in Leihi on loth-19th December and a more serious outbreak of stabbing and looting at Ajmer in Rajputana. On 16th December a curfew had to be imposed in Oawnpore where an unlawful demonstration had occurred after a speech by 'General' Mohan Singh .of the Indian National Army, On the evening of the 18th December serious communal rioting broke out in Hyderabad (Sind) (as a result of the stories carried there by Moslem refugees from the affair at Ajmer). Energetic steps were at once taken to bring the situation under control and total casualties are said to have been about 90 , of which 30 were fatal. B. INDIA H• Internal Political Situation . It was hoped that the Constituent Assembly would be able to consider the draft nev/ Constitution in January, The Government of India accepted the principle of the formation of Provinces on a linguistic basis, but stated that its implementation must v/ait until the administrative machinery was more' stable, A 3i week session of the Constituent Assembly sitting as / the* 5 . /N &lt; the Legislature considered over 20 official bills, passed the railway and general budgets and heard a number of important statements of Government policy on such subjects as Kashmir, Hyderabad, foreign affairs, refugees, de-control of foodstuffs, and the inter-Dorninion finaneial agreement• At the end of the month the Central Committee of the Communist 4 Party called for the establishment of 'a new democratic front composed of all Left parties, progressive elements in the Congress and Muslim League, workers, peasants, students, and middle class employees' • -Or. R*M« Lohia, a Socialist leader, characterised this move as an attempt to cover up the disruptive tactics which the Communists wished to employ. The Communist Party also proclaimed that all the political resolutions of the All India Congress Committee wore weak' and that it v/ould need the united efforts of all progressives to halt the present trend of appeasement of vested interests on the economic front* 13* Sarat Chandra Bose in Bengal renewed his agitation against the West Bengal Security Bill and made the Bill an issue to be fought by his new party, the Socialist Republican party, which is to 'carry out the political programme of Netaji' (Subash Chandra Bose). The Bill in question would confer special emergency powers on the Lxecutive for the preservation of public peace. It was violently opposed also by the Hindu Mahasabha, the Trades Union Congress and the extreme Left. 14* The Hindu Mahasabha and the Sikh leader Master Tara Singh both dissociated themselves frem the All Indian Congress Committee resolution on refugees and ridiculed the idea of any minorities returning to Pakistan. Hyderabad lb. A hand grenade was thrown at the Nizam on the 4th December as he was driving through Hyderabad City but he escaped unhurt. Talks between the Nizam’s Government and the State Congress Party failed. /and6 As /-V A and a new interim Ministry was appointed for one year under Mir Laik Ali consisting of 8 Muslims and 6 Hindus, including 6 nominated officials* Sardar Patel, Deputy Prime Minister of India, publicly expressed his dissatisiaction with its composition. The State Congress Party threatened a state-wide civil disobedience movement, including the non-payment of rent, and Congress Party adherents in the Dominion of India announced their support for this. The Covernment of India have however advised Provincial Governments to co-operate in maintaining lav/ and order and working the Standstill Agreement. lu. The Hyderabad Government promulgated an Ordinance banning the use ci the Indian Rupee within the State for cash transactions, with a view to making the Hyderabad State Bank a central bank of issue for the State. The Indian Ministry of States informed the Nizam*s Government that they regarded this as, prima 1 facie , a breach of the Standstill Agreement and asked for full details. Eastern States i/. On the 17th to 19th December Sardar Patel visited Cuttack and Nagpur. Following on this visit, it was announced that 39 small States of the Orissa and Chattisgarh Agencies had entered into agreements with the Dominion Government whereby, frem the 1st January 1948, the administration of these States will be conducted by the neighbouring Governments of Orissa and the Central Provinces respectively, on behalf 01 the Government of India. The Rulers have been guaranteed their personal rights and privileges, their dynastic succession and a fixed privy purse. e-xtcrnal Affairs . Palestine continued to receive a groat deal of publicity, and sympathy for the Arabs was v/hole-hearted, finding expression in criticism of the United States, of U.N.O. for its partition decision, and of the U.S.S.R. for its desire to fish in troubled v/aters. Condemnation of the South African Government's policy towards Indians in that country was very bitter, and the vote / on7 /s rs A on the matter in the United Nations Assembly was considered a moral victory for India, although a two-thirds majority was not obtained* 19* The opening of Ceylon's Dominion Parliament was greeted with optimism, but the status of Indians in Ceylon is to be taken up at the earliest opportunity. 20. pandit Nehru made a statement in the Legislature on India's foreign policy, in the course of which he emphasised the necessity for India to avoid big power entanglements. 21• Pood Policy . On 10th December a new food policy was announced by the Government of India, amounting to a progressive de-control of food grains. Rationing and controlled prices will disappear 'as soon as may be feasible' but de-control is to be backed by a main reserve central stock of 500 thousand tons of imported food grains. The skeleton of the food control organisation is to be retained in case this experiment should prove a failure, 22. Industries Conference . At an Industries Conference held in Delhi under the auspices of the Government of India, emphasis v/as laid on the grave economic condition of the country arising in large measure from the decline in industrial production caused by transport difficulties, labour troubles and shortages of raw materials. 23, Shipping . The Government of India’s proposals for the expansion of the mercantile marine are reported to have been accepted with certaii reservations by the Indian Shipping Companies, Import Control . Owing to continued shortage of foreign exchange, the main features of the present import control restrictions are to continue during January to June 1948, In addition open general licences for imports of certain goods from the sterling area have been cancelled and import licences for them are now reauired, CL PAKISTAN 25. Internal Political Situation . At the end of the month the Pakistan Cabinet was enlarged by the inclusion of Sir Mahommad /Zafrullah8 /N /•v A w ^afrullah -Khan as Foreign Minister. Mr. Liaqat Ali Khan rcQains Brine Minister and retains the Defence ] ortfolio. a6, Cahinet changes were runoured in the Provinces. In t.he West PunjcM, the Governnent had to meet with nuch criticise*, especially on account of the conditions in refugee canps there. In East Bengal, indignation arising fren a local breakdown of food rationing at Dacca tended to centre on the Prime Minister, as being responsible for the selection of the Cabinet. Rumours were current that a Cabinet night be formed under his mercurial opponent Mr, Fazlul Haq. League . Mr, H.S. Suhrawardy continued his campaign for the abolition of the existing Muslim League and its replacement in Pakistan oy a National League open to members of all communities. He was also reported to have welcomed Mr, G-andhi f s suggestion that Muslims in India should join the Congress, North West Frontier do. On 2/th December the withdrawal of Pakistan troops from has iris tan was complete . ' , Dav/n M commented — perhaps optimistically - 'the tribesmen have now voluntarily taken it upon themselves to defend the frontier oi Pakistan*'. In Baluchistan a scheme was put forward for an amalgamation of the area with the province of Sind, Quetta being made the permanent capital for the new Province, 29* External xM'fairs . As in India, the Palestine question attracted a great deal of attention and there was much talk of Pan-Islamistn and the solidarity of the Muslim countries, including Pakistan, with the Arab cause, 30. Sardar Najibullah Khan, the special rejifesentative of the King of Afghanistan reached Karachi for negotiations for the placing of Pakistan-Afghan relations on a formal basis. He expressed the desire of the Afghan Government for co-operation and gave an assurance that fundamental interests of the two countries could never conflict, Mr, Jinnah’s reply was confined to the hope that /matters9 A matters requiring immediate attention would soon be adjusted, Afghanistan appears to have rather far reaching ideas as to the status of the North West Frontier Province. 31. The Pakistan press, commenting on the Cabinet crisis in Iran, sympathised with the difficulties of a 'small country' in the face of insistent demands from a powerful neighbour. 32. Industries Conference . A meeting in Karachi called by the Pakistan Government set up machinery to consider measures for the development of industries e.g, cotton textiles and irrigation and hydro-electric schemes. The Minister of Commerce outlined the extent to which the Government proposed to own or control industry and sll £G es 'fc ec ''- participation of foreign capital, management and technical services in industrial projects. 33* Food situation . Normally, Pakistan has a surplus of fool; but, consequent upon the deterioration of the cold-weather crop in the West Punjab and the influx of refugees from India this surplus will not arise.this year. Even the surplus rice of West Punjab will be inadequate to meet the deficit in East Bengal. A Conference of representatives of India and Pakistan is to discuss outstanding food commitments between the two Dominions in New Delhi early in January. 34. Railway Rates . Increases of 22^ in the rates for goods and passengers, of 2Q^&gt; for parcels and luggage, and of 8-^3 for coal were announced to take effect from the 1st January, 1948. Certain commodities hitherto exempt from earlier increases in rates will continue to be exempt. The increases are attributed to the difficulty of Detaining coal and the higher costs of operation. The railways have operated at a heavy loss since August 13th, 35* Air Transport . Air Transport is to be left for the present to Xxrivate enterprise but will be regulated by the State. Only two operators will be licensed in respect of each of the routes to be flown and i£ is a foregone conclusion that the licences will be /granted10 , V A granted to Orient Airways and a newly formed Company called Pak-Air Limited* 36 . Cotton , In the 'Jest P’jnjab sales of cotton are greatly reduced and the price is about one-third of what would be considered normal. The problem is partly one of financing the ginning factories, and although this has been i^rtly met by the institution of a Pakistan Finance Corporation, the disruption of normal commercial and bankip channels due to the exodus of the Hindus, the shortage of coal and the loss of Hindu and Sikh technicians remain formidable difficulties, 37 . Jute . In i^ast Bengal the impiosition of duties on the export of raw jute was expected by the trade'to realise about Rs.2l crores during the remainder of the current financial year, but the announce ment of the duty greatly slowed down sales and the ultimate amount collected may therefore fall short of this estimate. As a reply to the Pakistan export duty, the Government of India declared the Dominion of Pakistan to be foreign territory for the purpose of levying Indian Customs duties on the export of raw jute and jute manufactures from India to Pakistan, The Pakistan Government are anxious to export as much raw jute as possible via Chittagong COPIES CIRCULATED</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000b0_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/6/401</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000b0</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/6/401</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 11/57 Political Situation in India &amp; Pakistan'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1948/1948</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-09-06T22:16:30</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (12 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 13; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains a report entitled 'Events in India and Pakistan during December 1947' that was sent from the Persian Gulf Residency in Bahrain to the Political Agencies in Bahrain, Kuwait and Muscat.
