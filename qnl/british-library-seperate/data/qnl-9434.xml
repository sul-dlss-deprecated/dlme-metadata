The oil wells concerned were in Bahrain, Qatar, and Kuwait.The file includes correspondence from the Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO); Commander-in-Chief, Middle East; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Petroleum Department; and the War Office. Correspondence dated 1943-44 includes plans by BAPCO to reopen plugged oil wells in Bahrain.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Oil wells</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Emergency Planning</topic></subject><subject><topic>War (concept)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000207#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000207#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
