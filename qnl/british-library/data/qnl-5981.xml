With Pickering being ill enjoy hands, date, and having to be shipped off home at the earliest possible^ i* bean quite impossible for me to leave Basra, and further, the weather has been, and still is, very rainy and unsettled, but I write to ask if, whan the weather is favourable and I can manage to get away, you could approach the shaikh and find out if he would view the opening of a branch of the bank in Kuwait with favour. in to see me that, for the next five years at least, tnere would be fairly heavy finance required for drilling purposes provided they do not find oil in workable quantities before that time, and it would appear to me that, provided there was good import and ejqport trade, a bank would be rather a blessing to the port. you would I should be much obliged if, when you find time,/give me your views in the matter.

The 7th February 1935. :.Iany thanks for your letter dated 30th January 1935 regarding the practicability of opening a branch of the 'astern Bank in Kuwait. 2 . Firstly let me say that ray wife and I will be delimited to put you and Mrs.Wilaon up any time after the 23rd February, but I fear not before, as we shall be having guests from Bushire from the 13th to the 20th, and our spare room acoomnodation is limited. Bo whenever you feel inclined and can manage a couple of days visit after that date just drop me a line and give me a day or two’s notice and you will be made welcome. 3. Now for the question of a Bank: I have never discussed with the Shaikh nor has he ever reised the question with me of a Bank for Kuwait, but there are obviously two courses open to us to find out his views on the subject:- Either (a) for me to see him, before you come down , sound him, and let you know the result; Or (b) wait for you to oorae down and you to call upon him and broach the question yourself without my ’’butting' in at all. 4. It is difficult say how tfie Bhaikh will react at present, but it is fairly cert? in there will be some, though not much, opposition from local vested interests. I do not think, however, this will be anything like as strong as the opposition I experienced when I helped to get your Branch fixed up in Bahrain some years ago, for Kuwaitis generally are much more in touch with Basra and the Bank life there than/2 - than the Bahrainis ever were in the old days - I think they have a better business complex. 5. ill© question of trade will, I fear, be the greatest stumbling block to your scheme, for although kuwait has quite a good import trade now practically no exports, save wool, ghi, and pearls exist. Of course if the K.G.C. once gets going properly, there will be lots of traae of every description and for everybody. „ m n 6 . faking everythig into consideration, I think perhaps the best course would be for you to come dosm here towards the end of February, and discuss the 'Ahole matter with me first. You could then decide on your next move. »ith kina regards from us both, &lt;^&lt; y , ^ /t~J &lt;ib jjiLJ Wm * / \i* ^ (l hr fci letters to be addressed TO V ^7 EASTERN BANK LIMITED telegraphic address EASTERTIDE n lUmk.Wtmitrt*, ORATED IN ENGLAND.

The only other competetor in the field is the Ottoman Bank, but they do not appear to have quite definitely come forward yet. 3. AS for the Kastern Bank, I til ink we can rule them out of the picture, for although Mr. Wilson, their Branch Manager in Basra sounded me on the subject at the end of January last, and got so far as to say he would come down and see me in February, he in a subsequent letter infonned me that his London Principals had definitelydefinitely abandoned for the present the idea of a Bank in Kuwait (vide also paragraphs 21 and 29 of Kuwait Intelligence Summary for 1935).

May I suggest that the consultation should be private, as the scheme is evidently only Butters 1 personal idea at the moment? We are telling Kna tchbull-Hugessen that as far as the probable attitude of the Persians is concerned, we are content to leave the matter to his discretion, but that you are consulting Fowle. sd.

When Mr. Kurfcgy jretired 1st Manager of the Ottoman Bang,came to Kuwait on 2 nd March, he quite rightly called on me and asked if he could look round Kuwait and see the Shaikh and various merchants, with a view to his principals desifting whether it was worth while thinking seriously of opening a branch of the Ottoman Bank at a later date. (to. Hammond and Mr. Pickering of the I perial Bank of Persia and Bastem Bank respectively had already done this). 3 . I told him, I saw no objection, provided he recognized that the last word always lay with His Majesty’s Government. 4. The Shaikh was out in the desert hunting when Mr.Kurkgy arrived, so the latter could do nothing. . As Mr. Kurkgy did not know when the Shaikh would return he wrote 5he wrote him a letter dated 4.5.1935 and left again for Basra without seeing the Shaikh. A few days after, the Shaikh explained in conversation with me, that the Ottoman Bank Directorate in Basra had aiquired fran him (through a certain Mr. Kurkgy) about the possibilities of opening a Bank at some future date in Kuwait. That he (the Shaikh) had written and told Mr. Kur&amp;fey, that he thought that the bank would find it quite worth their while to do so, and that he bad explained that should the bank eventually decide to open in Kuwait, he (the Shaikh) would be willing to promise that no other bank should compete with it for 10 to 15 years. This seemed to me harmless, and quite business like on the part of the Shaikh, so I did not think it worth whitBi mentioning anything to you until I saw a further advance on the part of the baik. 6 . You will notice that on Mr. Kurkgy’s return to Basra, the Official Manager of the Bank addressed his letter of 9th April 1935 to the Shaikh and sent copy to me under his letter of seme date. It was because I thought he was you then 'going a bit fast' that I decided to send^my Printed Letter Bo.C/108 of 12th April with enclosures. 7. On your impress Letter No. 356-3 of 30th April reaching me yesterday I saw the Shaikh and asked if he would let me have a copy of his letter dated 6 th March to Mr. Kurkgy and he readily agreed to do so. He quite frankly said that he had nothing to hide at all and that all he teid told the gentleman was that he would be very pleased to see his bank open provided his principals came forward in due course and proposed terms. Should he agree to these and should the bank agree to certain conditions he himself would put forward, then all would be well. . The Shaikh emphasized that Ihe road was open still 8/ : 3 for any nufeber of banks to ask him for a monopoly in Kuwait * 9. I may mention in passing that the Shaikh always keeps his private money with the Ottoman Bank Basra, and is on the b&lt;£st of terms with them. He has an account with the Eastern Bank also. The managers of both banks fairly often come to Kuwait and stay with the Bhaikh as his guests. 10. I enclose a translation of the Shaikh’s letter with this. 11. I myself do not see that the Shaikh has conmitted any particular indiscretion so far. (X Political Agent, KuwaitTRAN3IATIQN: of letter No.R-4/l954. Dated 1st Dhil Hujjah 1353. 6 th March 19 35.

' Ottoman Bank * My dear Fowls, Before you left Kuwait, 29th May on your last visit, you asked me to put the following two questions to the Shaikh verbally, and to report his reply by means of a demi offioial letter. Question (a) Did he (the Shaikh) consider that he was bound to give the Otto men Bank a monopoly, provided they agreed to his conditions. Question (b) If so, why did he not consult you, before writing to Mr. Kurkgy the letter he did. 2 . I now write to say that I discussed the point with Shaikh Ahmad on 8 th June last with the following result.- (i) la answer to question (a) the Shaikh replied with a very decided negative. His letter to the Bank he said, merely meant to convey that in the event of their deciding to come forward and make a firm propo sal to open a bank in Kuwait - then he was prepared to agree to open negotiations with them just in the same way as if they were an oil concern out for a concession; That he would then put forward his own terms which would include such varied matters as:- (a) Amount of Royalty or subsidy they should pay him. (b) Question of interest to be charged to him and the The Hobble Lieut-Colonel T.C.W. Fowle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I R E.0 2 and tli© public. (o) Question of coamiission to be charged on remittances to him and to public. (d) Question of misbehaviour of Bank employees and how this would be dealt with. (e) Question of 'Hawalas* etc. etc. and then in the event of their being able to agree with his terms, and he in the meantime had not changed his mind in favour of another Bank , that he would be willing to grant the Ottoman Bank a working monopoly for 10 to 15 years. (ii) The Shaikh further said that he was quite prepared to give an exactly similar letter to the one he wrote to Mr. Kurkgy,(a retired official of the Ottoman Bank Basra,) to any other Bank whatsoever, who t ho tight fit to approach him on the subject of opening a branch in Kuwait, and that the road was entirely open to the Eastern Bank, Imperial Bank of Persia, or any other English Bank such as Lloyds Bank to come fbrward and see him about the matter. (iii) Lastly, that as lie was anxious to see a Bank open ia Kuwait at all costs now that the K.O.C. was in being ? he trusted that if you or E.M. Govern ment had any other bank in mind which you wanted to assist, or preferred to the Ottoman Bank for Political reasons, you would treat the matter as an urgent one and get such bank or banks to come forward with all speed to talk business with him. The necessity of speed was of importance to him, as he could not wait too long on the convenience of other aspirants to the concession. 3 . As regards your question (b) para 1 above - the Shaikh quite frankly said that, as he was not bound by any treaty3 treaty or undertaking that he was aware of to consult H.M. Government in the mattBr of a bank, it had never occured to him to discuss this particular matter with me, before writing his perfectly normal and friendly letter to Mr. Kurkgy. But that out of personal regard fbr me, and wishing to convey to me that his views on Banks generally had today become quite n modern M , he had mentioned what he had done, a day or two after writing to Mr. Kurkgy. It should not be forgotten, he said, that until a short time ago Banks were anathema to Moslems like hizaself and his people, and one of his ideas in telling me of what he had done was to convey the fact that Kuwait was going right ahead, acd that the days were gone, when Arab States moved in 'blinkers*, and their rulers were thought incap able of thinking for themselves, or forming sound judge ments. 4. The Shaikh’s last words to me were 'Please tell my friend Colonel Fowl© that if he wants another Bank to get in before the Ottoman Bank does then for Heavens sake to get busy and porsuade it (or them) to come forward and talk business quickly, for I cannot wait for them to see if oil is found in Kuwait or not before they decide'. 5. I fear I have written a rather long letter, but I wanted to make the Shaikh’s reply and his point of view generally, clear. I feel quite certain from the very candid and friendly way in which he discussed the subject, that there was no intention whatsoever of trying to gak i go behind the back of, or upset H.M. Government. s He is very proud of the way he rules his State and consider that there are certain things which, as an independent Ruler (even though under our protection) he has a right to do without consulting us, obviously this question of a Bank- 4 - Bank is one of them. He was quite concerned to think that you had put a different construction on the matter to what he did, and could do no more than say, that the more banks that come along, and offered to open in Kuwait, the better he would be pleased, but that he must clearly reserre the right to make final selection, in consultation with us of course, as naturally the Bank that went out to meet his terms in the friendliest and most a coobhio dating spirit would be accepted.

Sir, This Bank, which has for very many years been established at Bagdad and Basrah, has in view the opening of a branch at Kuwait under the following circumstances. The Sheikh of Kuwait has urged this Bank to open an office at Kuwait and has premised his support; he has stated that, recognising the heavy initial expenses which starting such an office would entail, he would allow no other Bank to open an office there for a period of some years. Colonel Dickson, the British Agent at Kuwait, has informed Mr.F.J.Harris, who is in charge of our branches in Iraq, that as a prior step we should advise the British Political Resident at Bushire of our intentions, and that this should be done through the India Office. May we, therefore, ask you to be so good as to advise His Majesty’s Political Resident at Bushire that the India Office have no objection to the proposal that a Bank should commence business at Kuwait ?

Xhe Kuwait Oil company has worked without serious or, as far as I know, any difficulty in money ratters and I have disouased the matter with the IocjBL /eneral superintendent of the Kuwait Oil Company (now on leave) , who would have, I feel cure, informed me hi d there been any outstanding difficulty. He returns in a few days and X t &gt;hall aounc him privately and inform you if he ht.s anything different to say. The Company’s Accountant in private conversation a few days ago informed mo that when the Company had first come to Kuwait they enquired from the Eastern Bank if they were thinking of establishing a branch. The Bank (the Basra branch) replied that they were not Interested any lon:er. He had heard however from the Company’s General superintendent, now in ^oiidon, that the Bank had there recently approached the Company anc he understood that he, Hr.Scott, the General superintendent, thought that it ms unnecessary to hasten to accept a proposal as they had now established n adequate method of their own for temporary- 5 cwn for temporary porpoeas using local Arab bankers a Basra bank* 4 . The accounta.it had heard tiiat 24 ajor fioliaes was responsible for reopening the question tliin time by encourag ing the Eastern da ax in London to approach the Company* This is confirmed by the Uhoikh who informs me that he has Just received n letter from '-*&amp;joi* Holmes who says that he has . ^ranged everything with the Eastern ^ank to open a branch but that he (Holmes) is held up pending the shaikh’s authority in the matter* 5# /hile the approaching need for a bank cannot be gainsaid I feel that the Suite would do well to come to a careful arrangeiaant under the auspices of His Britannic Majesty’s Government and avoid Ik. sty commitments* 6. / fter nil even if oil is found aoon it may take the Company some years before production is reached and cone month© after Oil is founc bofora a marked increase in activity and personnel* 7. /ith regard to which bank is preferable for Kuwait the Honoux*able the Hesiaent has already made his observations. I would only add that perhaps (although I think it is rather unlikely in view of their nearest other branch being as far away as Karachi) that Lloyds Bank, with whom the HulerRuler has a rather .large account In I^ondon, xalght also be interested, at least to the degree of bringing the Astern Bank and other competitors up to scratch in the matter of conditions ana safeguards which may be proposed.COngTIMiTL-L . 3. .O.No.C- 3^ POUTICAL i.G 3iCY, KUWAIT.

With a view to considering the question they have enquired attitude of India Office and are being informed that if Shaikh comes to an arrangement vith them I would raise no objection and would probably not wish to attach any conditions except possibly in regard to nationality of Staff - a matter ^which might perhaps be raised by Shaikh himself. 3.

With reference to your paragraph 3 I venture to give it aa isy opinion that it is not desirable to leave entirely to the Shaikh the choice of a Bank without our indicating any preference. 3. In the first place a Bank is an important concern which can wield considerable influence and it seems to me most necessary that the Kuwait Bank should if possible be a British concern. 1 H r IV/ 4. In the second place His Majesty’s Government'' ' f (the Government of India concurring) have on various occasions (see for example India Office letter No.?.3.7'683/33 dated the 1 st February 1934 to the Foreign Office) emphasised the importance of maintaining our special position at Kuwait by tightenii^ up our control over the Shaikh. One obvious way of attaining this end is by 'the accumulation of sofell advantages' i.e* by seising every opportunity to increase our influence with the Ruler and generally strengthen otr position in his territory. On the other hand if on occasions such as this we refuse to give the Shaikh any lead whatsoever we must not be surprised if our influence over him /-2 &gt;f 0 him decreases and if our position at Kuwait io gradually undermined* authorised to inform the Shaikh that while His Majesty’s Government cannot dictate to him on t he subject (our Agreements with him only cover concessions re: Oil), they would definitely prefer a British Bank i.e. the Kaatern rather than a foreign i.e* the Ottoman established at Bahrain. This would in no way conflict with your paragraph 2 as if the shaikh in spite of our advice finally decides to choose the Ottoman Bank we can raise no objection. 6 . Yith regard to your paragraph 1 . I would add this to my message to the ShaiKh suggested in my immediately preceding paragraph. 7. Ottoman’s Bank *s statement that they have priority from the Shaikh - your paragraph 2.

We agree with Fowle that Britisn bank at Kuwait would be preferable to foreign ban*. On the other hand we deprecate tendering of formal advice to Shaikh on a subject regarding which we have no power or right to ensure that acvice is accepted. If Shaikh were to reject advice we could do nothing and such result would in our view weaken rather tsn strengthen our position in Kuwait. We suggest therefore that Resident when informing Shaikh in the sense of instruct ions conveyed in paragraph 1 of your' telegram acd that in his personal opinion such an arrangement would probably be more in the interests of Kuwait than granting of a monolopy for 15 years to a non-British bank. - FOREIGN■ii'iliiiin* 1 '- Telegram y^om Political Ktsideut, i^ushire.

KUWAIT BkWii. / / Only question which shaikh has asked so far is whether His majesty's Governmen t a pprove Eastern Bank. Only step necessary at present is for Fowle to.reply on the lines of paragraph 1 of my telegram of S^c November. There is no need at this stage to mention others, Ottoman or any amprofi table? Imperial? dank. If subsequently ohaikh receives and decides to consider other offers besides that of Pastern Bank a naif he should then ask His majesty’s Government for advice on relative merits definite proposals of His majesty’s Govermuent could then take consideration all relevant factors involved including nationality of applicants and inform Bhaikh what in their opinion would in the long run be in the best interests of Kuwait. advice of this Kind would, I presume, be most likely to be accepted and at the same time it would tend to increase His Majesty’s Government’s influence with Shaikh, fut occasion for giving it may not arise. I consider it would be undesirable to volunteer advice and it is moreover difficult zo give advice unless and turns competing offers are communicated to us by shaikh. -Retaxandum-note for the Hoi^ble the P.H Bank for Kuwait. The present position is that once more all three Banks, the Eastern, the Imperial Bank of Persia and the Ottoman are renewing their enquiries, /ill three are sendir^ representatives into Kuwait in the next month. The shaikh’s main condition:, as far as I can make out,are likely to be:- (a) The consent of His Britannic Majesty’s Government be obtained; (b) /i special rate of interest for himself and special person 1 facilities for transfers of his money; (c) An undertaking not to take up mortgages without obtaining his permission. He would like to have a Bank as he would gain personally and I believe that he favours the uttomen in his mind at the moment because he thinks being lers British and reputable it is likely to be more accoramodating to him personally. The Oil Company does not care one way or the othe at the moment and is inclined if anything to be against e Bank. A Bank would be stigmatized by (a) local religious and conservative Moslems, lb) the local bankers who are of course against the Bank as interfering with their ov/n operations, and (c) the local populace, who will be no doubt against the j3ank as soon as it sees that the Bank (which is apparently the main object of all these Banks in coming here) is putting the unoo &gt;ultr ’Note’ into circulation as against the hard silver which it would remove from the Gtate. In otherIn otiiar words the Oil Conpany is entirely neutral at the moioent, the Ohaikh would like the Bank for personal gain but us the populace are rather egt inst it would like to put the onus on the Hon’ble the Resident • If the shaikh cun say in his daily tiejlis, ,f The British are pressing i* to establish a Bank here”, he will be delighted.

F.M’s Political Agent, Kuwait. Sir, iVe have the honour to confirm our recent conversation regarding monetary and exchange conditions in Kuwait and wish to thank you for the enquiries that you have made in this connection. our first conversation on the llth May : - (1) The Kuwait Oil Co., have a hanking account with the Eastern Bank, Ltd., Basrah, the method hitherto employed of obtaining cash has been to sell Dinar cheques to an Arab merchant, Abdul Kerim Abul, who acts, we understand, as the Ruler*s Treasurer and Rent Collector. (2) Until 5/5/1937 we experienced no difficulty in obtaining rupee coin in this manner at rates of exchange approximating those ruling in Iraq, but on the date mentioned, we were informed that owing to the flooding of the Kuwait market with Dinars, a rate of Rs.13/1 per Dinar was the best Kuwait offer. At this time the Dinar/feupee rate in Basrah was Rs. 13/3/5. (3) On making enquiries of Abdulla Mulla Saleh we were informed that the causes of this unfavour able rate were : - (A) Heavy purchases by Iraq merchants of lamb skins for which payment was made in Dinars. (B) Seasonal requirements of Indian exchange to meet cost ©f rice and other Indian shipments arriving at this time of the year. We confirm the following points raised in• 2 - &amp; (4) In view of the alleged local market conditions we obtained from our hankers in Basrah, Bs. 20*000 worth of rupee drafts at the Basrah rate of exchange and these, Abdul Kerim Abul undertook to cash locally at \% commission. In this way a rate of exchange slightly better than the local offer was obtained. (5) After obtaining Rs.16,000 in coin we were informed by Abdul Kerim Abul*s son that ov/ing to export of rupees there were only 30,000 rupees available in the Town and there were no sellers. (Subsequently we have been able to cash our remaining drafts at no commission through Messrs. Gray Mackenzie Ltd.) (6) On receipt of this information we instituted enquiries which resulted in the allegation that about 750,000 rupees in silver had been exported during the yeax. (7) Other enquiries also elicited the fact that one of the biggest employers of labour amongst the local merchants was also having difficulty in obtaining rupee coin. (8) In view of the difficulty of the position and the possibility that it was being engineered by a small ring of local merchants, the matter was brought to your notice. From subsequent conversations we understood that resulting from your enquiries into the matter the following points have been made by the Euler or his representative (Abdulla Mulla Saleh) : - (1) That there is no actual shortage of rupee coin in the Town. (2) That the present position is a seasonal one due to slackness of business at this time of the year. Local merchants at this season not requiring to purchase either Dinars in Iraq or Bupee in India due to this cause. The position will in all probability rectify itself in the early autumn when the date crop comes on to the market. In view of the peculiar local conditions we are advising our London Office of the situation and recommending that steps be taken to make us independent of the local exchange market in case of necessity. We have the honour to be,i /&gt;^ Copy of letter :io.C-144 of 20th I.Iay l^h7 from Politi cal (/^ Agent, h await to the iiDn’ble the Political Resident, Bus hire.

On the 14th Hay Mr.Scott, .fields Manager of the Kuwait Oil Company informed me, during the course of a general discussion on oil matters, that he had experienced some difficulty in obtaining in Kuwait a sufficient number of rupees to pay the monthly salary bill of the Company’s employees for the month of ^pril. Kr.ocott went on to say that as a result of his enquiries he had learned that during the past yea * ' roximu tely 750,000 rupees had been exported from Kuwait with the result that there was now a serious shortage of rupees in the Town. ^ter my discussion with »*r. ^coto , x . n ti one d the rz o • matter at an in' erview with His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait.

Any further 'action which may be necessary such as his 'deportation if a non-Kuwaiti will necessarily 'be taken by the authority concerned, i.e. 'Kuwait Government or the Political Agent, Kuwait, 'within whose jurisdiction the individual falls'# I therefore wish a confirmation of your acceptance of the above terms.

The conditions as worded have the effect of excluding British subjects from any of the posts other then Manager. e should be glad to know precisely what manner of persons are intended to be covered by these clauses and why British subjects should be excluded, if this is intended.

The Bank as a matter of fact contemplated employing an Iraqi, and the object of the Shaikh’s condition in its present form was to ensure that the attorney should be a person, other than those mentioned aa exceptions in paragraph 2 above, falling under the jurisdiction of the Political Agent, e.g. an Indian (British subject or British protected person), but not e.g. an Iraqi. The attorney would not be required if a “European British subject were employed as Resident Manager at Kuwait, and there was no intention of excluding Indian British aubj ects.
