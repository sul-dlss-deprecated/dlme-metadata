The letter explains that he is unlikely to obtain the required sum from any other source.Also noted is that word has been received that William Rich at Bagdad [Baghdad] has been granting bills on Bengal at an extremely favourable rate; the Lieutenant is concerned that if true and permitted to continue, the rate of exchange offered at Bushire will be undermined.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023685574.0x000158#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
