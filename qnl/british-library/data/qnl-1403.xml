Political Departmext. From, COLONEL SIR W. L MEREWETHER, B. Commissioner in Sind. To, HIS EXCELLENCY THE RIGHT HOXORABLE SIR W. R. SEYMOUR V. FITZGERALD, G.C.S.I., Governor and President in Council, BOMBAY. Commissioner's Office, Camp the Tanda, 26th January 1870. Right Honorable Sir, Tn submitting- the accompanying copies of' Outlineofflhelat affairs from 1S.&gt;/ to 1801)' received from Colonel Phayre, Political Superintenttmit of Upper Smd, on which he appears to have devoted much care and labour, I have only considered it necessary to add marginal notes, where required, to the narrative part thereof, as the chief portion is on the records of Government, and will have already received full consideration. With regard to his concluding remarks, and the opinions he puts forth, they require somewhat closer reviewing, and more extended notice. \ 2. Colonel Phayre appears to attribute all the ills existing, or said to exist, m Khelat territory chiefly to what he terms the ' Khanazad' system of Government. It will be as well, therefore, in the first instance to have a clear exposition of what that consists of. It is not of recent establishment, as the correspondence now submitted, might lead to be inferred, but dates back from the earliest dates of Brahooee rule. The most prominent character in modern days—the Darogha Gool Mahomed—was in service in the time of the great Nusseer Khan, and was one of Mehrab Khan's most trusted and most faithful servants. The dislike to the British which he held to nearly the last days of his hfe, was due to the very strong feeling he had of the injustice done to his mister, Mehrab Khan. He went into exile with his masters son, N us seer Khan, just before Khelat was captured by the British in November 183.0 ; re turning with him when that young Prince was phiced on the throne by the British Government in 1810; and serving him to the best ef his abilities, and( 2 ) according to his light until the horrible tragedy, which is reported by Sir II. Greeii to have ended that young Prince's most promising career. Whether Gool Mahomed really caused poison to be administered to Kusseer Khan, because he was getting too wedded to British interests, will probably never be satisfactorily cleared up; but his well-known and deep-seated hatred to our power gives weight to the tale, and renders it probable that the events happen ed as told to Sir H. Green. 3. The other Khanazadees who surrounded Mehrab Khan were the fourSha- gasee's brothers, one of whom Noor Mahomed was killed by Mehrab Khans side in the breach ;it the storm of Klielat. The remaining three, Wullee Mahomed, Gookm Jan and Taj Mahomed, were given offices round Kusseer Khan on his ascending the throne. Of these, the only one living and holding power now is the Shagasee Wullee Mahomed, one of the most true and honest men in Beloochistan; staunchly faithful to his master, and at the same time most sin cere and earnest in his desire to, on all occasions, further and promote the wishes of the British Government. lie was selected Wuzzeer by His Highness the Khan, at Jacobabad in January 1858, in the presence of the Commissioner Sir Bartle Frere and the late General Jacob, who approved the selection ; and he was afterwards formally installed by the Khan at Gundava, in presence of all the Chiefs of Beloochistan. Sir Henry Green, who worked with him for many years afterwards, invariably stated that no better selection could possibly be made. L The present Khan, Meer Khodadad Khan was, on the death of his brother Meer Nusseer Khan hi June 18.57, elected ruler by the Chiefs of Beloochistan, the Puggree at the installation being tied on his head by the Chief of J a la wan, Sirdar Taj Mahomed. That the Darogah Gool Mahomed was exerting pernicious influence over the young Khan soon became apparent, and his causing the attack on the Sirdars in September 1857, undoubtedly promoted the unfortunate division which has ever since existed between the J\_ lan ail iGadin^ Chiefs of bis country. But that the Sirdars were not entirely free from blame then even is shown by Sir Bartle Frero in his letter Ko. 61, of 19th February 1858 ; writing about this attack as follows :— 'At that time, he (the Jam of Beyla) joined other Chiefs of influence (these bad come to Klielat under pretence of doing homage to the new Khan) who appear to have thought the occasion propitious for pressing claims upon a the Khan, some of which appear to have been reasonable and well founded, &lt;c while others were the reverse ; but they were urged in a manner which induced the Khan s advisers to resort to force, to dislodge the remonstrant &lt;c Chiefs from the garden near Khelat, where they were encamped. They ' retired to a short distance from the capital, and thence addressed petitions ' for redress to the British authorities, assembling at the same time their own ' followers with a view to enforce the Khan s attention to their claims.' 5. At the time of the above circumstances there was another counsellor at the side of the young Khan, not a Khanazada, but a Bunniah named( 3 ) Gungaram, who tliongh never apparently appointed, was virtually Wuzzeer, and who shared with the Darogah in undisguised enmity to the British Government. One general cause of complaint and dissatisfaction was the power usurped by this Bunniah. G. On Sir Henry Green, at the conclusion of the Persian war, rejoining lii.s appointment as Political Agent at Khelat in 1858, he found it necessary to exert Ins whole influence with the Khan, backed by the support of General Jacob and Sir Bartle Frere, to check the proceedings of these two men, and to obtain their removal from office. The Bunniah Gungaram was sent away to Sind by the Khan, but the Darogah remained at Khelat, though relieved from liis duties. He for some time continued to exercise some indirect influence over the Khan for evil, but it was much, if not entirely, nullified by the firm, and straightforward bearing of Sir Henry Green, who in a measure succeeded in making a friend of the JJarogah before death brought the latters trouble some career to an end. 7. It was hoped then that matters would run more smoothly, and that the divisions that had been caused might be settled favorably. Sir H, Green was able on occasions to report more favorably of the young Khan, but the unfortunately uncertain character of this young Prince, made still worse by his wretched rearing in the seclusion of the harem and immediate difficulties on his first entering public life, led to repeated contretemps. This capriciousness also, each time that it was shown, naturally increased the ill-feeling amongst the principal Sirdars, and on each recurrence of a difference the attitude assumed by the Chiefs becoming more objectionable, the breach could not but be widened in spite of all Sir H. Green's efforts to the contrary. That Officer reporting on 29th January 1863 writes thus in reference to this point:—' Much ' of the ill-feeling towards the Khan is doubtless caused by his capricious and ' unstable character, but his Chiefs by the unreasonableness of their demands &lt;f and insolence of their conduct towards him, render any permanent settlement ' of their differences most difficult; his power over them is slight, and although ' their lands are held by feudal tenure, any attempt made by His Highness to ' enforce even the extradition of a culprit leads to their banding together and ' defying his authority.' 8. This capriciousness was most unfortuitously displayed in one particu lar case of the grave insult passed by the Khan on Sirdar Taj Mahomed, the principal Chief of Jala wan, in the year before the above was written. The betrothal of the Khan to the daughter of Taj Mahomed had been formally executed before, but in a hasty moment he suddenly married the Sirdars sistei&gt;wido\v of his brother, the late Khan, and a determined enemy of her brother. This marriage was perfectly justifiable according to Brahooee law, but under the circumstances was a direct affront to the Sirdar. This act materially assisted in bringing about the revolution which caused the attack oh the Khan in 1803, and his deposition for the time,. At first Sir H. Green( 4 ) was favorably impressed with Taj Mahomed, but further aequamtance caused him to change his opinion, and after his death, he wrote of him ;—' One tiling is however beyond a doubt that a more desperate intriguer, or a greater ' traitor did not exist in any Native Court in Asia, and so long as he remained ' at large, llis Highness the Khan's position could never have been safe.'' J). It should be here pointed out that even during the late Khan's rergn, and incessantly from the commencement of that of the present one, there have been elements of disorder always at hand in the shape of the ambitious pro jects of Azatid Khan of Kharan and of the Jam of Beyla. Azaud Khan though once a dependant of Klielat is now a quasi independent Chief, some times owning allegiance to Kandahar, sometimes acknowledging the autho rity of Persia, lie was also father-in-law of the late Khan, Nusseer Khan, and after the accession of that Prince formed, and steadily followed out, the intention of obtaining the Khanate for himself. The Jam of Beyla, Meer Khan, is not a Brahooee, but belongs to a Sindee tribe. His father's sister however was married to Mehrab Khan, and he himself is married to a full sister of the late Khan, and half sister of the present one. He is a feudatory of the Khelat ruler holding the territory of Lus Beyla under the proviso, that when called on he should furnish a quota of horse and foot for the service of the Khan. 10. These two Chiefs are both well known aspirants to the Khanate^ and have been ever ready to take advantage of any quarrels between the Khan and lus nobles, to give their assistance to the latter in hopes of the destruction of the former, thereby furthering their own ends. And it is undoubtedly greatly owing to their intrigues and evil advice that the breach between the Khan and his principal Chiefs became greater and greater until it is now almost impossi ble to readjust on any ancient footing, 11. In March 1863, the Chiefs broke out into open rebellion ; the Khan was suddenly attacked in his Camp at Gundava and cut down by his own cousin, Shere Dil Klian, who was then put on the throne by the Chiefs. Khodadad Khan fled, and after some wanderings accompanied by Sirdar Moolla Mahomed Raisanee who then stood staunchly by him, he in Novem ber following took up his residence in Cutchee at Nusseerabad, close to the border of British territory. Here he remained until May 1864, when Shere Dil Khan having been assassinated by the Commandant of the body of troops used as personal guard by the Khans of Khelat, Khodadad Khan was recalled and reinstated Khan, mainly, it should be said through the support and good offices of Sirdar Moolla Mahomed Baisanee. Major (now Lieutenant Colonel) Malcolm Green, who was at the time Political Agent at Khelat, in reporting on this revolution, brought to notice 'the loyalty towards the British Govern- ' ment which has characterised the proceedings of all parties in Beloochistan,' and further that ' although the VI Article of the Treaty between the British ' Government and Khelat has been for some months suspended on the part of' the former, no instance has occurred or attempt made to use this fact as an ' excuse for departing from the original terms of the Treaty ; and by increasing ' the transit dues on merchandize passing through the country to India, to ' ia i sc the revenue to the same amount as it was previous to the Treaty bein'- entered into, and thus save the country from the state of bankrnptcv to which the late disturbances have almost reduced it.' This was written in January 18G4 and speaks highly for the good feeling generally entertained towards the British Government. 12. For nearly a year after Meer Khodadad's re-accession, affairs remain ed tolerably quiet, and His Highness was engaged trying to settle the affairs ol his countiy after the confusion of the previous year. But in March 1865 Sudars Moolia Mahomed Haisanee and Taj Mahomed Zehree made common cause, for what exact reason is not clearly shown, doubtless offence taken at some injurious act of the Khan, real or imagined, and attempted an insurrec tion in Cutchee against His Highness the Khan, having for its object the assassination of Meer Khodadad Khan, and putting his infant son on the throne, vide Captain Harrison's demi-official letter dated 27th May 18C9, submitted to Government under Memo : No. 361 of 7th June. The former was made prisoner, the latter fled to Kandahar. Taj Mahomed died at Khelat in confinement in August 1867. Sir Henry Green in reporting this said common bazaar report gave out that he had been poisoned, but as it is sel- ' dom a Chief of any note dies, either in Beloochistan or Affghanistan without such reports being spread, and as no enquiries that I have been able to ' make can P r0ve the truth of the report, I place little faith in it,' and again f from the time of the present Khan's elevation to the throne, I can state on ^ the besfc au thority, that not a single Chief of any description has been put to c&lt; death by his order, or by that of any of his people in authority, although few ' Princes have had the provocation he has had to put up with.' He further reported with regard to Moolla Mahomed, that from the time ' Sirdar Taj ^ a ^ 10me( l ^ as seemed and Sirdar Moolla Mahomed, had fled, the most perfect ^ tranquillity reigned throughout Beloochistan, which was only disturbed by ' the return of the latter Chief from Kandahar during last month*, with the * October 1867. intention of again creating an insurrection ; but no efforts that he could make gained him any sup- port beyond that of a few Chiefs of minor note, and the vigorous efforts of ' His Highness the Khan and his Officers after a few insignificant skirmishes, ^ resulting in the loss of a few men on either side, entirely quelled the attempt, ' and most of the principal offenders surrendered themselves with their wives '• and families to His Highness' Officers; while Sirdar Moolla Mahomed again ' fled with a few followers to the Murree hills, from whence he will doubtless soon find his position most inconvenient and sue for pardon.' hl In 1SG5 ' disturbances were recommenced by the Jam of Beyla m concert with Nooroodeen, the Chief of the Mingul tribe. Their forces were(• C ) met and defeated by those of His Highness, and the Jam and Xooroodeen were made prisoners, but pardoned some little time afterwards by the Khan, 14. In January 1868, a messenger came to Sir Henry Green from Moolla Mahomed llaisanee and the other Chiefs with him, requesting that Sir Henry Green would intercede in their behalf with their master. He very properly declined to interfere in any way, except at the request of His Highness the Khan, and then only on the condition that both sides should abide by his deci sion. They agreed to this, so also did His Highness the Khan, and the Sirdars were told to reside quietly at Seebee, a small province in the North East cvti&amp;r of C'.itehee belonging to Kandahar, where they would be unmolested until leisure admitted of their case being taken up. This happened on the 10th of April, when the Wuzzeer Shahgassee Wullee Mahomed and Sirdar Moolla Mahomed llaisanee both came to Jacobabad. Sir Henry Green after hearing the statements of both sides, made a temporary adjustment of the differences such as would prevent any renewal of hostilities, leaving a more permanent arrangement to be carried out the following cold season when His Highness should come down to the plains. 15. Sir Henry Green's departure from the Frontier in May 1868 pre vented his carrying out the latter part of his programme. Colonel Phayre succeeded him in August of that year, and shortly after his arrival in October was waited on by Mahomed Khan, the Wukkeel of His Highness the Khan, with letters from the latter ' to the effect that, in consequence of the great ' scarcity amounting to partial famine that now prevails in Cutehee from want ' of rain. His Highness had no intention of leaving Khelat this winter, ' unless particularly requested to do so, in which case he expressed his willing- ' ness to come into Cutchee at once for an interview. The cases of the prin- ' cipal Sarawan Chief, Sirdar Moolla Mahomed, and of many others referred to in Colonel Sir H. Green's last annual report will thus remain unsettled, &lt;c unless some steps are taken to bring them under His Highness the Khan's ' personal consideration.' In reference to this, I wrote to Colonel Phayre that ' I think under the present circumstances of the very great scarcity in ' Cutchee, it would be advisable not to press His Highness the Khan to de- ' scend into the plains this season. It would be not only putting him to very ' great inconvenience, but as he must bring a considerable number of people ' with him, it would only add to the existing distress. With regard to the ' oases of Moolla Mahomed llaisanee and the other Chiefs of Sarawan, I resret 7 o that nothing can be done for them at present, their business must stand over until an Officer is again appointed to Khelat.' The above will show that the Khan offered to come to Cutchee, if desired, and that his not doing so was ap proved of by me. 16. Th ere were other reasons also, and very strong ones, which were ^ . . , , allegred at the time, why he should not leave his \ ule Commissioners letter 0 No. 534, dated 23rd November capital. These were that the Jam of Beyla was 1S08. .... . , . . again plotting insurrection, and was communicating( ^ ) with the Sarawan Chiefs in Seebee with the view of getting them to join him. The latter wisely attended to the advice given them by Colonel Phayre, in which I entirely concurred, to keep quiet where they were, and leave the ques tion of their differences with His Highness to be settled according to the pro mise of Sir H. Green, when they could be discussed personally by the Frontier authorities with that Prince. The Jam of Beyla with Nooroodeen Mingul and others assembled their forces in Wudd in the end of December to press their claims on the Khan; Balooch Khan, nephew of Azaud Khan of Kharan, joined with 400 horse and 1,000 foot. Azaud Khan, who had returned from Kandahar wheie lie hdd been foi some time residing, announced his intention of joining the rebels. His Highness the Khan moved from Khelat with all his available forces and met the rebels in Bhagwana, some skirmishing took place, but negotiations were entered upon, and the Chiefs ultimately retired with their forces to their respective homes. They stated in letters to Moolla Mahomed Itaisanee, sent by that Sirdar to Colonel Phayre, that the Khan promised them what they asked, to be given in two months time, and on these assurances they went to their homes. Nothing however of this sort is mentioned by the Khan in letters from him to his Vukeel with Colonel Phayre, which were de- liveiod to that Officer, the outbreak was checked for a time, I believe, in consequence of Moolla Mahomed not having joined it, but it was clear the cessation of disturbances would be only temporary. 17. Captain Harrison was appointed Political Agent at Khelat under orders received by telegram from your Excellency in February 1869. After my visit to the Frontier Districts in that month, and March, Colonel Phayre with my concurrenca summoned Moolla Mahomed to Jacobabad. He arrived about the 16th March. Alia Dinna Khoord, another of the discontented nobles, was also present, and the two submitted the following statement of their griev ances, which were taken down by Captain Harrison and afterwards forwarded to me with a demi-official letter by Colonel Phayre :— Statement of Moolla Mahomed Raisanec. 'In former years, the Khan and his ancestors used to consult with his Sirdars, and act on their advice. We Sirdars between us held about half the ' territory, and the Khan from thecr own lands used to give us pay in the following proportions :— ^ Sirdar Moolla Mahomed Eupees 1,000 Sirdar laj Mahomed t aao ' Sirdar Nooroodeen .. ' i 'ooo ^ Sirdar Mahomed Khan...' 1,000 ' The minor chiefs used to get allowances at what rate I don't'remember.

Three years have elapsed since I clescribei. Mah0aie(1 ' ls 1,ct '' t ' left. The Khan confiscated all my property, about W. l, M. ' 700 camels and 80 mares.( 8 ) ' The Khan has just released my brother, Ilybut Khan, after a captivity of ' three years. He came with a message from the Khan's mother that if I did ' not come myself, ti send my son to make his salaam, and all my paternal &lt;£ estates would be then restored. 1 did not place any confidence in these pro- ' mises, and preferred that any thing that could be done for me should be done ' t hrough the English Government. I don't wish to be too profuse in my com- ' plaints, and will therefore briefly state what redress I think I am entitled ' to. ' 1st. The restoration of all my paternal estates. 2nd. Restoralion of property. ' 3rd. The grant of lands which the Khan gave me at Tehree Mushkab and Kalowa. ' 1th, Compensation for the death of the following people— ' Sirdar Taj Mahomed Jalawan. ' Kamal Khan Mahomed Ilussaino ka Sirdar. ' Hubeeb Khan Ptoostumzai. ' Eawut Khan Roostumzai, and his son Meeah Khan. &lt;c Mahomed Lehree and Mahomed Khanl/ehree. c&lt; 5th. The right of river water at Dadur. ' In conclusion, I would beg to state that we are discontented at the in- c ' fluence of Shagassee AVullee Mahomed, and that the revenue is devoted to ' keeping np mercenaries.''' Alia Dinna Khoords Statement. ' About five years ago, owing to a difference with Shagassee Wullee Ma- ' homed, I fell under the displeasure of the Khan. I hold my ancestral pro- ' perty, Murrow and Dusht, in Khorasan' [that is above the Bolan], ' as also ' one near Shawl, which I purchased for Ilupees 1,000 from Ashlum Khan ' Patau; also an estate in Mustoong purchased for Rupees 100. ' I claim in Cutchee the following lands which the Khan took from me ' when I left his service on account of the way he treated Sirdar Taj Mahomed:— ' Nowshera purchased by Wuderah Adam Khan Eungoolzye and my- ' self for Ks. 0,200; we drew the revenue from the land for live years. &lt;c Pour of us claim Bahooer, it having been presented to ns by the Khan. ' Wuddera Adam Khan Bungoolzye. ' Alia Dinna Khoord. &lt;e Svud Khan and Mahomed Shah Jchan&lt;?eer I-chree. * o ' We four were also allowed right of river water at Dadur.' 18. In addition to the above statement officially recorded, Moolla Maho med informed Colonel Phavre in the course of conversation that when the Khan was in exile in 1863, he wrote a declaration in a Koran to the following effect, dated Nusseerabad 9th October 1863 :—( 9 ) ' At this time I, Mecr Kliodadad Khan of Klielat Ahmedzye, swear upon ' this holy Koran, and declare to Sirdar Moolla Mahomed Raisanee, and his ' family, that you are free from hlame in the injury that has happened to ' me,* and that hy the favor of God you have done * This refers to his dethrone- n • i i* ment by shere Dil Khan. well Nothing of what has happened is on your w. L. M. t&lt; hecause I did not listen to your advice, and ' was separate from you. Now you must exert yourself for me with all your ' heart and life, and if you do so, the original lands which you have enjoyed Kullora, worth about in R 9 . ' in Kutchce and Kohistan shall be yours, and in good season 2,000 « addition to these, 1 srant you in perpetuity the Mushkab 4,000 or 5,000 „ ™ n i j o i i Sehree 2,( joo « towns of Kullora, Mushkab and Sehree; also R P. « j that the son of Naib Moolla Mahomed &lt;£ Hussein,and the son of Moolla Mahomed Ameen T ^the^young'nu^ee^Khan!^ &lt;$ (brother of Mahomed Hoossein) shall continue to W. L. M. u en j 0 y as much land as they have received in £&lt; Enam from the Government, and I agree to give them any service that ' may appear to you, Moolla Mahomed, to he proper. 4&lt; I also promise that I will not transact the Civil and Military business ' of the country without your consent and advice. ' Whoever is my enemy, is yours, and do you regard him as your enemy; ' and I will regard any enemy of yours to be my enemy. ' After writing the words of this oath, if you do not support me with ' your heart and life, you violate this Koran, and if I do not carry out the ' words of this oath, I shall violate it. O Seal of Khodadad Khan,' 19. In no official document does Moolla Mahomed say that the Khan broke this agreement, or that the lands given him were withdrawn until after he fled to Kandahar, and then the reason assigned by the Sirdar for ' leaving the Khan' was on account of the latter s treatment of .Sirdar Taj Mahomed. The lands were confiscated by the Khan because Moolla Mahomed projected a rebellion in concert with Taj Mahomed, having for its object the assassina tion of the Khan, and when detected fled to Kandahar. 20. In addition to the statements officially taken down from Moolla Mahomed and Alia Dinna Khoord, Colonel Phayre gathered from the former that the following were points which the Chiefs generally wished to settle with the KhanTor convenience my remarks are given opposite each point raised. ' 1st. They claim that the Kha- 1st. This has become more and nate shall be constituted, as to laws more difficult owing, in a great mea- ' and Government, as it was in the sure, to the unreasonable proceedings days of the first Nusseer Khan. of the principal Chiefs themselves,( 10 ) ' 2iid. They complain of the en- ' tertainment of a large body of mer- &lt;£ cenaries, who are fed from the pro- eeeds of lands and other sources of ' revenue of which they and their ' children are deprived.' ' 3rd. They claim compensation for the murder of Taj Mahomed, the Chief of Jalawan,' ' 4th. They object to the innova- ' tion of the Khan's appointing his ' own infant son as heir to the Chief- ' tainship of Jalawan, the appointment ' being by right and ancient privilege ' in the hands of the J alawan Sirdars ' themselves, subject to confirmation ' by the Khan; and that a son of the ' ruler is not eligible to the position ; ' and that such a measure cannot ' fail to perpetuate the present divided ' condition of the Khanate.' ' 5th. They claim the right of ap- ' pointing their own Wuzzeer, and ' want a change of ministry.' and the intrigues and designs of the ambitious ruler of Bevla and the Khan of Kharan. W. L. M. 2nd. This has become a necessary sequence of the Khan not having the feudal services of his Barons. The sources from which the mercenaries are paid have yet to be truly shown ; as, however, these Troops supply the place of the Barons and their retain ers, it might not be considered alto gether unjust if a portion of the revenues thcv received for feudal ser- vices were appropriated to the pay ment of their substitutes. W. L. M. 3rd. This is tantamount to de manding that their Khan should de clare himself,if not actually implicated in, responsible for the murder. W. L. M. 4th. This, if ever entertained by him, was a hasty and unwise act of the Khan, said to have been done in the beginning of March 1869. The death of the infant soon after settled the point however it was, and Captain Harrison in his demi-official dated 27th May (submitted to Government) reported ' the future Jalawan Chief ' is to be the next of kin, Taj Maho- ' med's cousin.' W. L. M. 5th. This was never the case. From the earliest times the Khans selected their own Wuzzeer, and nev er from among the nobles from some outside party. At first it was here ditary in the family of the Tajiks, a race well known in Affghan history, usurped for a while in the time of( 11 ) Mehrab Khan by a low born Ghil- zie, who was murdered and succeeded by Moolla Mahomed Hoossein, son ot the previous Tajik Minister, and who was removed in the reign of the young Nusseer Khan for treachery, and died in confinement. Gungaram, the Bun- niah, then acted as Wuzzeer for a short interval, after which the present Wuzzeer, the Shahgassee Wullee Ma homed, was appointed. W. L. M. cc Gth. They claim to have a voice Cth. This is fair enough and would ' as of old in the Civil and Military be assented to by the Khan, if the ' Councils of the Khanate.' Chiefs would be reasonable and not grasp at too much power. W. L. M. ' 7th. They say that the treaty of 7th. The treaty is undoubtedlv ' the British Government is with the with the Khan as responsible ruler of ' Khan as ruler of Beloochistan, as Beloochistan, and not merely as head ' the head of the Brahooee confederacy, of a confederacy. This is one of the ' not with the individual Khodadad unfortunate errors the Chiefs will per- ' Khan, who they say has become sist in.' ' their enemy by departing from the W. L. M. ' rules and laws of their confederacy.' 20. Having heard from Colonel Phayre on the 22nd March that Moolla M.ahomed purposed going to Beyla before proceeding to Khelat, I telegraphed as follows :—' It would be better if Moolla Mahomed Raisanee went direct to c Khelat and not by Beyla. He will learn nothing good there, and his visit- ' ing the Jam first will not tend to improve his position with the Khan. If c it can be so arranged, Moolla Mahomed should follow Captain Harrison c direct.' And again on the 25th idem ' I am still strongly of opinion ' Moolla Mahomed should not go to Beyla, his doing so would seem like a ' sanction from us of combination by nobles against the Khan. Moolla Ma- ' homed has behaved most wisely and excellently''' hitherto, it would be a pity ^ J ,, , . ' to lose him that position. They have undoubtedlv Alluding to his having re- . . ' mained quiet at Seebee and not ' much JUSt Cause of Complaint, but WC Cannot COlin- joining the Jam's rebellion in i ^ October 1868. tenance combination to extort concession from the W. L. M. j^han. Our advice to the Khan to act justly will not be wanting. If he fails to listen, we should then withdraw, and leave matters to take their course. The Khan knows what the result would be.' 21. It ended in Colonel Phayre, at the earnest request of the Sirdars, consenting to their going via Bhagwana to Khelat, their object being to have an interview with the Jalawan Sirdars there before they passed on. This also had better have been avoided, but before any steps could be adopted, the( 12 ) Sirdars had left Jacobabad, and proceeded on their way. Xo sooner however had they started than, disregarding Colonel Phayre's instructions, they pro ceeded straight to Beyla. After arrival there, the murderous attack on Sirdar Alladeena Koordand las sons took place, which the Sirdars hastened to declare was prompted by the Khan. My opinion of this assertion, and how it should be received by the British authorities on the Frontier, is given in my letter No. 2GG of 1st May 18(39, and quoted in Colonel Phayre's statement of events, so need not be re-stated. Conceiving that Colonel Phayre was attaching too much weight to the statement made to him by the disaffected Chiefs, and that he was unintentionally drifting into unsuitable interference on their behalf with the Khan, I warned him against such a course. To this he replied in his quoted letter of the l&lt;th of May, but has not given my reply thereto, dated Vth May which, though it was forwarded to your Excellency in my letter No. 35 of 5th June, it may be as well to re-produce here. It was to the fol- lowinof effect :— O 'In acknowledging the receipt, to day, of your letter of the 4th instant, ' I have the honor to observe that the whole tenor of your letter No. 703, of the 27th ultimo, seemed to convey that you were so impressed with the ' necessity of some more decided measures being adopted in behalf of the Sirdars ' of Beloochistan, in respect to their differences with their Sovereign, and that ' you were so disposed to consider we were bound to interfere more directly 44 for them than had hitherto been the case, that I felt it incumbent on me ' to point out to you that our relations with the Khan rested with him alone, ' and that we had no right to accept any of the assertions of his Chiefs as to how they considered the Treaty to bear, or what they reckoned their rights ' to be. We have only to deal with the Government for the time being, the ' mode of conducting that, abides with the head. e may endeavour indirectly &lt;£ to improve his position and benefit the country generally by proffering good ' advice, but it should be most carefully done, so that it may not be supposed that we are siding with those who are in opposition to the ruling power, or ' intending to interfere with the internal Government of the country. ' Every little act of ours is watched so closely by these people, and signi- ' ficance attached often in a way least intended, that it is of the first importance ' to be most guarded against any demonstration of a leaning one way or the ' other. I am therefore glad of your assurance that your views are not as ' I supposed, and certainly consider that in the present stage no further com- ' munications received from the Sirdars should be acted upon by you, the ' only reply to any that may occur being that the matter is in the hands of ' their Sovereign, the Khan, who would doubtless act in the best ' suited to the interest of his country generally, and with that justice which should guide all rulers.' 22. The events which occurred at and near Khelat in May, the very offensive attitude assumed by the Sirdars, and the liberal, moderate procedure of the Khan, are fully described in the accompaniments to my letter No. 431) -1( 13 ) of the 30tli June to your Excellency. Sirdar Moolla Mahomed Ralsanee obstinately rejecting the favorable conditions allowed him by the Khan, left abrubtly with the intention of going to Jacobabad, but Colonel Phayre hearing of his approach, very properly refused to allow him to enter that place. These matters were reported in the letters from Captain Harrison and Colonel Phayre r forwarded under my endorsement No. 414 of 22nd June 1869. I would call attention especially to Captain Harrison's remarks on Moolla Mahomed, and his proceedings as given in his letter No. 10 of the 10th June, quoted in extenso hereafter in para. 29. The Sirdar then passed on to Seebee, where he continued to reside till a short time back, when hearinof of the defeat and fliofht of the 7 O O Jam of Bey]a, he fled into the Murree hills, pretending that he did not consider himself safe at Seebee. Of the other Sarawan Sirdars, Alia Dinna Koord, Wudera Adam Khan, Bungoolzye, and the Raisanee, next in rank to Moolla Mahomed, separated from the Jam and showed themselves ready to take gratefully what the Khan would give them. Azaml Khan of Kharan was present in the Camp of the Chiefs, and did all in his power to bring on hostilities which he trusted would assist his plans. The Jam and Nooroodeen Mingul returned to their respective homes, but only to prepare for what they hoped would prove a more successful rising in the following cold season. Further corres pondence on the subject of procedure with respect to Khelat affairs took place with Colonel Phayre, which was forwarded under endorsement No. 416 of 22ncl June, and the course laid down by me for adoption was approved by your Excellency and the Government of India. 23. The Jam purposely kept one point of dispute between him and the Khan open, to work when it suited his purpose. This was the question of the ownership of the Kemal Khan property in Bhagwana. Captain Harrison's letters on this subject, with accompaniments, were forwarded to Government with my letter No. 757, of 13th November last. From the Jam's proceedings it was clear he intended to make one more most desperate effort to overthrow the Khan and his Government, and to spare no means of trying to induce others to join. Of the Khan's wise promptitude in this crisis, despatching his trusted Wuzzeer with forces on the 25th September ; of the latter s rapid advances to Wudd, taking the Minguls by surprise before they were ready for action ; of his subsequent defeat of the combined forces of the Jam and Nooroodeen Min gul, and final occupation of Beyla; as well as of the flight of the Jam into Sind, your Excellency has been informed. Since then, the Wuzzeer in a letter recently received, translation of which is appended, informs me of his having quieted the District of Lus, induced the people to return who had fled from Beyla and other places, in consequence of the Jam's followers having taken to plunder (on being deserted by their leader), and of his having been able to cause the restoration of a good deal of the plundered property, after which he was about to proceed to Mekran to re-inforce His Highness' Naib at Kedj, who was alarmed at reported aggressive movements from the Persian side. 24. Captain Harrison, thinking that his presence with the Khan during( 14 ) the above operations might possibly lead to complications which it was well to avoid, very judiciously took the opportunity of visiting the districts of Moos- tung and Shawl, and descended by the Bolan Pass into Cutchee, where or at Jacobabad he lias since remained. His reports on His Highness the Khan's proceedings and the Shagassee's movements, Nos. 42, 44 and 48 3 were forwarded to Government under No. 789 of the 27th November 1869. 25. The above completes the narrative of events down to the present time. I have endeavoured to treat on them as briefly as possible, and to avoid as much as I could repetitions of what appears in Colonel Phayre's statement, but in some places the latter has been unavoidable with a due regard to clear exposition of what has really passed. The Klianazada (' literally sons of the house') government which the Chiefs prominently bring forward in their com plaints as the main cause of the evils existing in the country—and this state ment Colonel Phayre appears fully to have accepted—has been shown to have existed long previous to the reign of the present Khan (who has the sole credit of the remaining portion of the evils); and a careful review of the events which have occured during that reign will point to the fact that the Ivhanazada admi nistration has, except for a very short time at the commencement, been con ducted in a far less objectionable manner, and by less objectionable people, than was the case before. The present Khan came to the throne in 185/. Ihe most powerful person at Khelat then, as before in the late Khan s reign, was Daroga Gool Mahomed, but through the manly and firm bearing of Major (new Sir Henry) Green, this man's evil designs were successfully defeated, and early in 1858 he was removed from the Councils of the Khan, dying not long after. Before his death even, his hitherto unrelenting hatred to everything British gave way before the uprightness of the English gentleman, for though -deprived of his former power, he expressed himself in friendly terms to Major Green. The next in influence and with equal dislike to us left to the new Khan by his predecessor, was not a Khanazada, but the Bunnia Gungaram, who had been employed as defacto Wuzzeer and Treasurer by the late Xusseer Khan, after the deposition of Moolla Mahomed Hoossein, whose treachery to his master had been exposed by General Jacob. Gungaram was removed from his post and the country after the interview of the Khan with Sir Bartle Frere and General Jacob, at Jacobabad in December 1857, on which occasion the Khan fixed his choice on Wullee Mahomed Shagassee as Wuzzeer, and his selection was fully approved by those two representatives of Government. For the character and conduct of Wullee Mahomed since then I cannot do better than to call attention to Sir Henry Green's last report, written in April 1868, before leaving the Frontier. Nothing could be higher than the terms in which that Officer spoke of the Shagassee, who had then served the present Khan as Wuzzeer faithfully and most ably for ten years. Having held charge of the Frontier during General Jacob's absence in 1856 and 1857, and again after his death from the beginning of 1859 to the middle ot 1862, during which time I had the best opportunities of judging of the character and conduct of the Shagassee, I can most fully endorse all that was said of him by( 13 ) Sir Henry Green, and would add my opinion that no Sovereign ever had a more trusty servant, or one who had the interests of his master and country more sincerely at heart. Besides the Shagassee, the only other Khanazadas holding offices about the Khan, are the two sons of the Daroga Gool Mahomed, but these have neither the talent, influence^ or venom of the old man, and may be said to take no prominent part in the administration. The real working is by His Highness the Khan and the Wuzzeer. 26. With regard to His Highness the Khan, the defects in his character have been repeatedly brought to the notice of Government, some of them are such as are particularly unfortunate in a Prince called on to rule over proud and headstrong nobles, and a wild race of people. Capricious and occasionally vindictive, as he has displayed himself to be, he has also shown that he could act with firmness and generosity, as was evinced in the several rebellions of the Jam of Beyla and the various outbreaks headed by Moola Mahomed Kaisanee. He met all these boldly and vigorouslyj defeating each attempt as it was made, and afterwards treating each with almost undue leniency. He twice pardoned the Jam of Beyla and his confederate Nooroodeen Mingul, and last spring of his own accord gave to Moola Mahomed Eaisanee most favorable terms, in spite of the hostile attitude assumed by that Sirdar and of his leaguing with the Khan's most inveterate enemies, the Jam of Beyla and Azaad Khan of Kharan. 27. On his first ascending the throne, the Khan was styled ' a lad of weak intellect.' The real fact is, little or nothing was known of him at that time, his existence had never before been officially notified, and confined strictly to the seclusion of the harem, he was not likely to have much chance of displaying intellect, or having any natural manly powers at all developed. The question of weak intellect may be dismissed, for he has since shown that, whatever may have been the first opinion formed, he has displayed on occasions much shrewdness and aptitude for public business. There can be no doubt, however, that his early education among only women and slaves had a most injurious effect on his character, while the reputation he came first on the public scene with, led others to suppose that a creature was given to them to be moulded to the will of the party having the greatest power in the State. Hence came the scramble for that power, which took place from the very first, between the Daroga with Gungaram, and the Chief Sirdars of the country. On the two former being removed, it was continued directly against the Khan himself by the Jam and Azaad Khan, and afterwards openly joined in by Taj Mahomed, the leading Chief of the Southern portion of Beloochistan, and Moolla Ma homed Baisanee, head of the Northern part. That the Khan failed to draw his Barons around and to him, and by his own conduct helped to increase the differences that had arisen between him and them, is indisputable, but it must be recollected at the same time that his position was an exceedingly difficult one, unusually so for even the head of the wild clans of Beloochistan, and some credit may be accorded to him that he has not entirely failed in all respects.( 1C ) In January 18G3, it was recorded ' much of the ill-feeling towards the Khan ' is doubtless caused by his capricious unstable character, but his Chiefs by ' the unreasonableness of their demands render any permanent settlement of tc their differences most difficult.' Such it was from the first, and such, owing to the infusibility of the materials, it has continued to the last. In one respect His Highness the Khan has never changed, and that it is his sincere desire to act to the best of his ability and power in accordance with the wishes of the British Government, and with the treaty made with his brother and continued with him. This has been proved in many ways and reported on many occasions* and being the main point with which we are concerned, he has received the support of the British Officers politically connected with him. 28. Of Moolla Mahomed Baisanee, the Chief, who Colonel Phayre still seems to think has been oppressively and unjustly treated, I can only say that like Sir Henry Green (and Colonel Phayre now) I had originally formed a hio-h opinion of him, and considered him quite as likely to prove the most stable pillar of the State. My first acquaintance with him was in the begin ning of 1854, when he accompanied the late Khan, Meer Nusseer Khan, to Jacobabad. He was then quite a young man, just passed 20, handsome, frank, and of most gentlemanly demeanour. The last time was in 1860, on his own estate in Cutchee, at Mittree near Dadur. The impression left then was still most favorable, but judging from recent events, it would appear that increase in years and the bad example of others have led to a great change for the worse in him, and to the entertainment of ambitious ideas and greed for power which was incompatible with his position as a noble and with his loyalty as a subject of the ruler of the Khelat State. Captain Harrison's demi-official and official reports on what occurred at Khelat in May last, show clearly how fully he was convinced by the facts adduced by the Khan and the Sirdars' own demeanour of the wrong course the latter was pressing, and of the mistaken view that had been entertained of his present character and designs. 29. I would here quote a portion of Captain Harrison's letter No. 9, of the 9th June last, which is not given in Colonel Phayre's statement, but which is of great importance when the character and action of Sirdar Moolla Maho med are being considered. Captain Harrison's local experience of 11 years' work on the Frontier of Upper Sind gives his opinion much weight. 'With reference to the 6th para, of letter No. 266 from the Com- ' missioner, it will be only necessary to allude to two or three statements ' of the Sirdars put forward by Sirdar Moolla Mahomed, and by comparing ' them with what actually occurred, a fair idea of their truthfulness or other- ' wise may be arrived at.' ' The chief statement is that they, the Sirdars, had not done any- ' thing to warrant the treatment they had received at the Khan's hands. ' That he was jealous of their power and influence, and that he was persuaded( 17 ) ' by Shagasseo Wulieo Mahomed that he would never have a strong Govem- ' ment until he drove them out of the country. ' Against this are the following facts :—Sirdar Moolla Mahorned, aided &lt;4 by Sirdar Taj Mah omed and other Chiefs, organised the rebellion in which the present Khan was wounded and had to fly for his life. Shere Dil Khan was then elected Khan in his place, and was tolerated so long 'as he had money and land to give away. These turbulent Sirdars then mur- dered him and reinstated Khodadad Khan, and virtually became the rulers of Beloochistan. 1 heir greed and oppressive acts at last roused the anger of the well disposed Sirdars, and they insisted on the Khan asserting his autho- rity. J he Sirdars Moolla Mahomed and Taj Mahomed then organised ' another conspiracy to murder His Highness, and place his infant son on ' the Khanate. This being discovered just in time, the Sirdars with the ex- ' ception of laj Mahomed managed to escape; subsequently Tuj Mahomed ' died in confinement. ' A second statement of Sirdar Moolla Mahomed's calculated to mislead ' is that, owing to his being exiled, 20,000 of his followers have also shared his fate and are in actual want. Ihe barawans are composed of several Inbes, of which the Shawanees ' and ll.iismees have atone time or another been the head. The late Nusseer Khan, for an act of rebellion on the part of the Shawanees, touk away taeir standard and gave it to the llaisanees. The total strength of this '■ latter Iribe is only about 200, of which number 1.30 are with Sirdar Moolla Mahomed. The rest of the Sarawans are loyally disposed, and His Highness taking into consideration the treacherous character of the llaisanee Chief, has once more elected the Shawanees as head of the Sarawans. 1 he Sirdars have talked rather freely regarding Taj Mahomed's mother ' being kept a prisoner by the Khan. Ihis is not the case ; she lives in a neighbouring village and constantly goes to call upon His Highness. She has no sympathy whatever with the Jam's party, and states that her son's ruin was entirely owing to the ' evil influence of Sirdar Moolla Mahomed. t rom the above, there can be no doubt of the utter want of truth in Sirdar Moolla Mahomed s statements, furthermore that thev were only made to bring the Khan into disrepute. His unparalleled treachery can only elicit ' one opinion, that any hardship or any privation he may have undergone is only what he deserved. As regards the minor Chiefs who have been in exile» they preferred conspiring with Moolla Mahomed against their Sovereign to remaining loyal and true, and have therefore no one but themselves to thank ' for the sufferings they may have endured during the past 3 or 4 years. Sirdar Moolla Mahomed's behaviour since I met him at Ba^hwana con- vinces me that his previous history has not been overdrawn or exaggerated,( ) and I look upon his having refused to take up his hereditary lands as a ' fortunate circumstance for the Khan and his country. ******* The latter part of this report will, I trust, show that the Sirdars were not exiled without very good reason, and that their character is not quite '• what (hey would wish people to believe.' Again, on the 10th June, Captain Harrison wrote :— ' I have the honor to report for your information that T have just received ' a letter from Sirdar Moolla Mahomed, stating that he is en route to Jacob- ' abad, with the view of giving you his version of the policy that has been ' followed in connection with himself and other Sirdars. ' I would most respectfully urge that the opinion of his character record- ed in my report was not written without due consideration and a perfect ' conviction ot its truth ; it may add to the strength of my present opinion to state that until recent events no one was more favorably impressed than ' myself with Sirdar Moolla Mahomed. This Sirdars character is dishonest and untruthful in the extreme, and I think the way he perverted your* * ' instructions will convince you that such is the case. Instead of using his ' influence to persuade the other Sirdars to meet me in a friendly spirit, it was ' at his instigation that the Jam marched an armed force to within a few miles of Khelat, and it was this Sirdar that told me in Durbar that if they ^ ; did not get what they wanted they would fight for it. ' It may perhaps be thought that the late trouble I have had with the f: Sirdars may have prejudiced me against Moolla Mahomed, such is not the ' case, and this Sirdar's character may be appreciated at its real value, when ' his late allies and confederates, Sirdar Alia Dinna Khoord, Wuderah Adum Khan and others, say, that they regret the day they allowed him to be their ' guide and counsellor. *' Sirdar Alia Dinna Khoord, who is by no means a scrupulous person, &lt;c stigmatises the Sirdar's having come with an armed force as a most disgrace- ' ful proceeding. ' I am most anxious to do the best I can for this country and so far soli- ' cit your support that when Sirdar Moolla Mahomed presents himsdf, you will let him know that instead of representing the true feelings of the Sir- ' dars and people in Eeloochistan, he is simply looked upon as a discontented exile with a few followers, and that as he has refused the fair and equitable ' terms that were offered to him by His Highness, he cannot possibly expect ' further aid or sympathy. I was aware three weeks ago that Sirdar Moolla Mahomed would be *' likely to pay you a visit. My Moonshee was discovered writing to the( 19 ) a Sirdars and advising them that if they did not get what they wanted, to ' report rne to you and the Commissioner in Sind, and that everything would ' then be made rhrht. O ' i s with this idea that some of them refused the Khan's terms.' Colonel Phayre very properly, and in accordance with the instructions con veyed to him in May, refused to see the Sirdar, and in positively declining either interview or further intercourse, added ' that I had fulfilled my promise when I first came to Jacobabad in continuation of Sir Henry Greens, that ' I would use my good offices with the Khan on his behalf, that he had de clined the Khans offer and therefore that I did not see what more could be ' done for him.' JO. Captain Harrison, in his annual report now being submitted, writes in further reference to Moolla Mahomed « His Highness, whilst occupied in ' punishing those who for years past had been trying to subvert his authority, was not forgetful of those who were anxious to return to their allegiance, fcudar Alia Uinna Khoord, and Sirdar Adum Khan W udhera went to Seebee Moolla Mahomed is with the ' after The ^ liad P arted the Jam, and gave as Beejiranee Murrees, and it has 'their reason that no one would believe they had baen reported from tne Boogtee « i i' • . . Hills that these Sirdars fled after ' been forgiven. His Highness hearinor this sent him. Enquiries will be made. &lt;( ii , i . R. P hayre . a written order sealed by him, stating that &lt;( they might return to their country and live amongst theii o\\ n people, and that if their conduct was such as met with his ap- ' proval, that he would look upon them as his Sirdars. The whole of the ' liaisanee Tribe sent Hybut Khan, the elder brother of their Sirdar Moolla ♦ His Highaes's Wukkeel at ' Mahomed ' to Nawab Mahomed Khan,* saying that Jacobabad. ^ ^ ^ they did not wish to join in any intrigues that might be got up against the Khan, and only ' wished to be allowed to remain quietly at Mittree. His Highness wrote ' two very kind letters to Hybut Khan, saying that he had no wish to inter- ' lere with them, and that no one should harm them so long as they adhered ' to their present good intentions. Dhectlv Sirdar Moolla Mahomed heard of the defeat of the Jam of • Head Quarters of the Mur- ' -^ e 3^ a ar,c ^ Sirdar Nooroodeen, he fled with six roe8 - w L M followers to Kahun 4&gt; (only one of whom was a Kaisanee). The rest of the Tribe elected to ' remain quietly at Mittree under Hybut Khan.' 31. The fears cxpiessed by Moolla Mahomed were, I am certain, quite unfounded, and given out merely as a reason for his going to the Murrees, and with the hope of enlisting their sympathies. The district of Seebee is foreign to Beloochistan, and belongs to Kandahar; the Khan would not therefore venture to molest the Sirdar there, even if he troubled himself about him at all now, which is very doubtful. There was another object which struck me( 22 ) 3.5. With regard to maintaining this force, the Khan is I conclude the best judge as to its necessity, and considering his life was once nearly taken, and he was violently deposed by the very Barons it is recommended he should call again to his side without any new power of control over them, it is not surprising that the Khan should desire to keep by him some support, in which lie has at all events some confidence. Exactly the same course of events that occurred in Beloochistan is now passing in Affghanistan. His Highness the Ameer finding it impossible to trust any longer to the doubtful support of his nobles, and their treacherous levies, is putting an end to the feudal system, and forming a regular paid army, and I hold we have no more right or reason to interfere with the proceedings of His Highness the Khan of Kelat in this way, than we have with His Highness the Ameer of Gabool. 36. Colonel Phayre, however, in spite of the views of Government com municated to him by order of your Excellency, last summer, and in spite of the clear evidence of the gross misconduct of the Chiefs of Beloochistan, which was laid before him by the Political Agent, Captain Harrison, still conceives that some further interference than has hitherto been exerted should be em ployed, and that the Chiefs being a grievously ill-nsed set of people, measures should be adopted to compel His Highness the Khan to treat them in a different manner. I need hardly say that I entirely differ with Colonel Phayre in his estimation of the state of affairs in Beloochistan, and particularly so in regard to the light in which he holds our relations with that State. It is not quite clear what course exactly he would pursue, but it would seem that his first move would be to address His Highness the Khan on the part cf Go vernment with a threat that, unless he behaved better to his nobles, and crave ^ O them the share of power in his kingdom, which they thought they should have, the British Officer at his Court would be withdrawn, and he would be left to his own devices. Colonel Phayre lays stress on this being the policy of Lord Elphinstone's Government in 1858, but that was only enunciated on a very adverse report on the Khan's personal character, and it was never considered requisite to carry it into effect. 37. It is scarcely necessary to point out that this would now be a style of interference totally opposed to the orders of Government, and unjust to His Highness the Khan himself, who has ever staunchly adhered to that part of the Treaty under which he bound himself ' to act in subordinate co-operation with ts the British Government, and to enter into no negotiation with other States '• without its consent,' and has steadily endeavoured, in spite of great difficul ties and most adverse circumstances, to carry out to the best of his ability and po\\er, the other terms of the ireaty. It would also be a very false move, for it would be setting ourselves in direct antagonism to the Khan. It would destroy his power for good as ruler of the country, and it would infallibly lead to greater dissensions than had ever occurred before, a scramble for power, ending in the country being parcelled out amongst a number of rival Chieftains, jealous of and hostile to each other, and ready to hand their services over to( 23 ) the highest bidder who looked for them. It was with such a result in view that I wrote as 1 did in January 1861, when it was proposed to withdraw the Political Officer from Khelat, 38. I will not take up your Excellency's time with further remarks on Colonel Phayre s proposal, but will now briefly allude to what I consider the exact state of affairs in Beloochistan, and the course I would recommend for adoption. 39. With regard to the former, there can be no question that the present position of His Highness the Khan is stronger now than it has ever been before. By his moderation and judgment displayed last May, aided by the good advice and countenance of the Politiccal Agent, he defeated the designs of the CDmbined assemblage of the few discontented Sarawan, and Jalawan Chiefs, with Azaad Khan, and their separation followed. He acted with suitable promptitude and energy when the Jam of Beyla again broke into open re bellion in September, and his forces defeating the Jam and his associates drove them from the country. AH the Chiefs of Beloochistan—with the exception of twelve, of which five arc of the same tribe—have given in their allegiance to him, and he has shown himself disposed to be lenient to the latter, in spite of their rebellious and ungrateful behaviour. At the same time he is most willino- and ready to act on judicious advice when offered to him, or given on his asking, thus proving that he has the desire at least to rule well. After the plan for subsidising the Murrees fell through, owing chiefly, I believe, to its too limited scope. His Highness caused excellent arrangements to be made, at considerable expense, for the protection of merchants traversing Cutchee, and though more than usual have passed down the Bolan this season, I have heard of no instance of outrage having been committed since these arrangements o o O were established. 40. As to the course that should be adopted for the future, there is no one who feels more than I do the value and necessity of having a strong and friendly power in Beloochistan, a country that covers so large a tract of our western frontier, and that is likely at any time to be of such vital importance to us. It is for that very reason that I would recommend that no change should be allowed in the policy hitherto followed towards the Khelat State, that the same instructions should be given to our Political Agent at that Court to abstain from all direct interference in the affairs of the internal Government of that country, though at the same time to be ever ready to give such advice to His Highness as will assist him in his endeavours to place his rule on a solid basis, and to give his moral support to all such acts of His Highness as may be conducive to that object. I would also recommend strongly that an early interview should take place between His Highness the Khan and Colonel Phayre, at such places as may be most suitable, with a view to a better understanding of the real state of affairs being arrived at, and at which Colonel Phayre would be able personally to explain to His Highness the present desires and wishes of Government.( 2t ) 41. On this occasion the question also of the future management of the Murree and Boogtee tribes might be fully discussed, and a sound plan in augurated, less liable to the fluctuations and mishaps that have attended those hitherto devised. The only injury to trade, and only jeopardy to the Punjaub Frontier, arises from from the restless and lawless habits of these two tribes, who reside in the Hills immediately adjacent to the Southern Punjaub line. A portion of both these tribes has been taken into the service of Government under the Officers on that Frontier, and since then plundering has in a measure, if not entirely, ceased. There is, however, one defect in this arrangement which I think should be remedied, as it is otherwise likely to prove troublesome/ • Uncivilised tribee like the an&lt;1 that i3 ' that 11 is can ' ied 0n di '' e0t with theSe Murrees and Boogtees are apt to tribes, who or® subiects of His Ilighness the IChan, consider that when they can , , . vx- i i i.- refer to different authorities, that and not through the Orhcer to wnom political relations the influence of one may be used •,! .1 . . . . j rri • • i. j . 1 l 4.^ u, counteract the policy of the with that Court are entrusted, ibis is apt to lead to :ST« the^fthe'^ciiie complications, which had better be avoided, and I officials being in strict accord, W ould therefore recommend that in whatever new hut the idea would nevertheless he entertainecy'as hasbeen late- plan is proposed &gt; the Punjaub arrangements should ]y exemplified.

M. placed of^ or attend to any suggestions offered. 42. Instructions were issued not long ago by His Excellency the Vice, roy for an expedition to go into the Hills north of the Sind, and west of the Punjaub, Frontier to examine and report on the country, as well as on certain propositions that had been suggested by the Punjaub Government. Colonel Phayre submitted a letter to me putting forth his ideas as to the best means of carrying out those propositions, to which I replied, and have now the honor of appending both letters for your Excellency's consideration. It will ho observed that I consider advancing our Frontier line into the Boogtee Hills a mistake. It would protect the Boogtees certainly,, who are now more tract able than they used to be, but it would have little or no effect on the Murrees, whose Hills lie beyond the Boogtees, and who are in reality the only people near us, who continue to follow freebooting habits. Occupying the Boogtee Hills would give nothing, while it would be placing our posts in a less favora ble position than they have at present. There is less objection to advancing a post from the Punjaub. Frontier into the Shum plain, if it was found desirable, as that would not be far in advance of the supports, and would be in a locality where the troops could readily act. 4.3. A simpler plan by far, one that would be less expensive, and one that would involve us in no new complications, would be that at the interview with His Highness the Khan, Colonel Phayre should be instructed to consult with him as to the best and surest means of inducing the Murrees and Boogtees,( 25 ) to give up plundering entirely, and that Colonel Phayre should then submit a project accordingly. As a basis to work upon, I would suggest that the plan, which has so far succeeded well onthePunjaub Frontier, should be taken, viz. that the principal Chiefs, and certain members of the Murree and Boogtee tribes should be taken into pay. This however should be done in the name of the Khan, and whatever money had to be paid to these tribes should be disbur sed through the Khan's Officers at Jacobabad, in presence of the Political Superintendent or his Assistant (should the Political Agent at Khelat not be there, as would probably be the case), the Chiefs coming in themselves, or depu ting suitable substitutes to receive their stipends each month. A certain number of each tribe should also always remain at Jacobabad to keep up communications, being occasionally relieved. The object of this is, that it would instil habits of regularity and order into these wild people, would give them a feeling of confi dence in the arrangement, and help gradually to civilise and improve them. All this, and the regular payment of hard cash distributed amongst these two tribes, would assist most materially (if it did not at once produce it) in bringino- about their pacification and settlement, which has ever been a matter of anxious desire and consideration. One long existing cause of difference between the British and Khelat Governments would be put an end to, and the trade traffic from and to Affghanistan would be free from all molestation, from the top of the Bolan Pass to the Sea. 44 To effect this, the following might be taken as a scale for guidance. The Boogtees have already some of their tribe employed in the service of Go vernment on the Sind and the Punjaub Erontier, the Murrees only on the latter I would propose that in addition to the above, Goolam Moortuza, Chief of the Boogtees, should receive Pts. 100 per mensem personal pay, and provide 2 Jemedars at Pts. 20 .... Es. 40 0 0 50 Sowars at „ 15 ... . 750 0 0 Total per mensem Us. 8.90 0 0 I he Murrees being now divided into two distinct bodies, residing respectively at Kahun and Kote Moondaie, and the breakdown of the late plan being owing chiefly to its having been carried out with only one branch, that at Kahun, I would recommend that a quota should be taken from each of these divisions, pt tl^e same strength and on the same principle as from Goolam Moortuza Boogtee. Thus to Guzzun Murree, Chief at Ivahun, personal allowance Rs. 100 0 0 2 Jemedars at Es. 20 „ 40 0 0 50 Sowars at „ 15 ;J 750 0 0 Total Ilupees. . 890 0 0( 20 ) To Kurreem Khan Murree, Cliief at Kotc Moondaie, personal allowance Ks. 100 0 0 2 Jemadars at Rs. 20 „ 40 0 0 50 Sowars at „ 15 „ 750 0 0 Total Eupees 890 0 0 Making a monthly total of Rs. 2,070 0 0 Annually 32,040 0 0 T take the rates of Us. 20 and 15, because those now prevail for Belooch Jemadars and Sowars on the Sind Frontier, and any difference would cause discontent. On the Punjab Frontier there are 20 Murrees and 20 13oogtees engaged, but at Us. 20 per mensem. These might be assimilated to the others, and by giving a slight increase and introducing the rank of Jemedar, discon tent would be avoided here too. They might be from the Murrees at Kahun, to which the Punjab is nearest, and not of Kota Moondaie. 1 Jemedar 20 0 0 30 Sowars at Us. 15 « 450 0 0 Total Us..... 470 0 0 From the Boogtees—• 1 Jemedar 20 0 0 30 Sowars at lis. 15 » 450 0 0 Total Rs 470 0 0 Total of both per mensem Hs. 940 0 0 Total per annum I &gt;lS * 11&gt;280 0 0 Add charges on the Sind Frontier. . „ 32,040 0 0 Es 43,320 0 0 or, given in round numbers^ Rupees 44,000 per annum. 4.3. Were the above arrangements approved and sanctioned, 1 am con fident that the best results will follow. There would be. peace on the Punjab Frontier, from Sind to Dera Ghazee Khan, and opportunity given for the resources of that part of the country being developed undisturbed. On the Western side of the Murree and Boogtee Hills the country would be freed from the harassing attacks of the hitherto inveterate marauders occupy ing those Hills ; while the trade-line down the Bolan Pass and across the plains of Cutchee into Sind would be free from molestation, and the British provinces to the South would largely benefit by the trade which would annually increase, and follow that line to the Sea.( 27 ) 40. I have before expressed my opinion that Rs. 50,000 per annum paid to Ilis Highness the Khan under the Treaty, in lieu of the higher duties formerly levied from merchants passing through his territory, does not re imburse that Sovereign for the loss he sustains in the reduction of the transit dues as collected under that Treaty. It should also be borne in mind that under the 5th Article in addition to the fixed duty. His Highness ' binds himself, ' his heir, and successors, to prevent all plundering or other outrage by his ' subjects, within or in the neighbourhood of British Territory ; to protect the ' passage of merchants to and fro between the British dominions and Affghan- ' istan, whether by way of Sind or by the seaports of Mekran ; and that to aid in the fulfilment of these obligations, the grant of Es. 50,000 was to be applied as well as to the other stipulation. 1 trust, therefore, I shall not be considered presumptuous or unreasonable in earnestly recommending that the further sum abovementioned of lis. 41^000 may be annually granted to aid the Khan in acting up to his engagements. Applied, as suggested, it will check cattle lifting and intertribal quarrels, for any party offending in either of these respects would have its subsidy withheld from it, until restitution and repara tion were made ; it would afford the protection to trade which does not exist now, or when it does, it is at such an outlay on the Khan's part that he is unable effectually to maintain it; and it would enable His Highness to turn his undivided attention to the consolidation of his power and the good Govern ment of his country, at a time too when affairs look more promising for his success in this respect than has ever been the case before. I have the honor to be, Right Honorable Sir, Your most obedient servant, W. L. MEREWETHER, Colonel, Commissioner in Sind.( 20 ) immediately I hoard of the flight, as the most likely thing the Sirdar had in view, and that was hearing an expeditionary trip was about to be made from the British Frontier into the Hills, and that the Murree Chiefs would be sum moned to meet it; he hoped through them to get an opportunity of being again received, and listened to by the British authorities. I at once cautioned. Colonel Phavre against this. Very recently the surmise has been shown not to have been incorrect, for I have heard from Captain Sandeman, Deputy Com missioner Dera Ghazee Khan, that he had received a communication from the Murree Chiefs, in which they asked permission to bring the Sirdar to him. I have informed Captain Sandeman by telegram that this should not be allowed, and that no communication should be held with the Sirdar. 32. I have entered at length into the facts relating to the Khan and Sirdar Moolla Mahomed, that the whole circumstances may be betore your Excellency without the necessity of reference to numerous documents. With reference to the other rebellious Chief, I need only repeat that the Jam is now with his son and ladles of his family an exile at Kurrachee, Sirdar Nooroodeen is said to have fled to Kandahar, but his younger brother is with the Jam. Alia Dinna Khoord and Wuddera Adum Khan Bungoolzye have been told they may return to their own lands, and probably have done so. To show the exact state of the present relations between Ills Highness the Khan and his Chiefs, J requested Colonel Phayre to obtain fram Captain Harrison lists showing those who were well and those who were ill-disposed towards His High ness. These lists are appended. From them it will appear that there are ol of the former to 12 of the latter, not counting the Murrees and Boogfcees, whose pesition is peculiar, and who have had little to do ever with the course of events going on at Khelat. Of the 1*2, six belong to the one Tribe of Minguls, who have for years past given themselves entirely over to the direction of the Jam of Boy la. 83. The last on the list is Azaud Khan of Kharan, the never-ceasln&lt;r 7 O fomenter of disturbances in Beloochistan for more than twenty years past. Finding his objects could not be obtained through the Jam and Moolla Maho med, he left them in June last and went back to Kandahar, where he endea voured to interest the Ameer, and Sirdar Shere AH Khan, Governor of Kan dahar, in his behalf. Captain Harrison reports—' a lengthy correspondence ' received on this subject between the Khelat and Affghanistan Governments. His Highness' replies were dignified and appropriate, viz : that he should ' be most happy to restore Azaud Khan the land that he hold for doing His ' Highness' service, when he chose to account to him for having plundered ' the Village of Punchgoor, and other aggressive acts.' 34. At the same time that the list of Sirdars was called for, T requested also that a report might be submitted on the numbers, composition, and beha viour of the force of mercenaries, so freelv abased by the discontented Sirdars, and so constantly referred to by Colonel Phayrc, but about which no precise information was given, or indeed anything beyond hearsay statements. Copy of Captain Harrison s report is appended, also of Colonel Piny re's forwarding letter.( 21 ) The numbers shown are :— Artillery Cavalry Body Guard Infantry Regiment of Infantry 78 200 400 800 Total 1,478 Colonel Phayre points to a farther body of Household Cavalry mounted on the Khan's horses, and styled the Khan's Umlah. The numbers of these are not given, but Colonel Phayre concludes they make up the 2,000, or 522 more. This could scarcely be, the Khan would hardly have at his disposal that number of horses. But whether it is so or not, is a matter of little impor tance to the general question, that it is unnecessary to delay over it. This force of' regulars' as it was called at first, consisted only of 400 in the time of Meer Nusseer Khan, the late Khan. He found such a body necessary, and probably judged so from what he had seen in his early youth of the advantages gained by our regular paid soldiery. His selection of material does not, from Sir Henry Green's account, appear to have been happy. The severe discipline however recommended by that Officer, and seen to have been put in force, may have had a good effect on even such a band of roughs. The 400 was increased since 1856 to nearly 4 times that number, for reasons which need no elaborate description, being simple, and the natural consequence of events described above. Cavalry and Artillery were added. Of the whole Captain Harrison speaks in more favorable terms than was said of the ancient 400, and I should be inclined to think justly, for if so much larger a body had not some approach to good order, and discipline, and were not made to behave decently, it must have fallen to pieces longer ere this, or been utterly destroyed, when ccattered about in small detachments amongst a population every male of which nearly bears arms. Colonel Phayre takes exception to the favorable report, and quotes an instance under his own knowledge of gross insolence on the part of a Captain, which he accepts as conclusive proof that the whole are bad. With regard to payment of these levies. Captain Harrison distinctly denies the statement brought forward by the discontented Chiefs, that it was made from confiscated lands. He says ' I am in a position to state that such ' is not the case, His Highness has sufficient revenue from his lands at ' Baghwana, Khelat, Mustoong, Cutchee, and other places, besides the transit ' dues to support his small force. The only Sirdaree lands estranged are « those of the Raisanee Chief, and I showed in my letter of the 10th June that ' His Highness was quite willing to restore them. The actual income of this ' Sirdar, taking everything into consideration, used to be about Rupees 0,000 ' per annum.' The monthly cost of His Highness the Khan's force is Rupees 9,583, or annually Rupees 1,14,996.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100024102474.0x000008_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>Mss Eur F126/22, ff 54-67</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024102474.0x000008</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>Mss Eur F126/22, ff 54-67</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Letter No.52 of 1870 from Colonel Sir William Lockyer Merewether, K.C.S.I. &amp; C.B., Commissioner's Office, Camp the Tanda to His Excellency The Right Honourable Sir William Robert Seymour Vesey Fitzgerald, G.C.S.I., Governor and President in Council, Bombay</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1870/1870</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-10-29T16:33:24</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>14 folios</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Letter regarding Colonel Robert Phayre's report 'outline of Khelat [Kalāt] affairs from 1857 to 1869' and providing comments on each of the points made by Colonel Phayre.Sir William Merewether's observations include explanations of terms used in the report; the influences around the young Khan of Khelat [Kalāt], Khodadad Khan; the difficulties caused by the Khan having been raised in seclusion by his mother; recent events in Khelat from 1857 onwards; grievances against the Khan by discontented nobles; attempts by the Jam of Beyla [Bela] to disrupt the Khan's government and rulership.The letter goes on to give Merewether and others opinions on the Khan's Wuzzeer Wullee Mahomed Shagassee and of Khodadad Khan himself; as well as the apparent change in temperament of Moolla Mahomed Raisanee; and the ongoing difficulties with Azaud [Azad] Khan od Kharan not only in Khelat but in Beloochistan [Baluchistan] in general.The letter also comments on the number of regular forces under the Khan's command; Captain Harrison's more favourable impressions of these forces and the arrangements for payment of these forces; as well as Merewether's disagreement with Colonel Phayre's opinion that the British Government should interfere in both these matters and that of the relations between the Khan and his Chiefs.The letter proceeds by making observations on the state of affairs in Beloochistan and why he advocates that their should be no change in policy towards Khelat state. Merewether also comments on recent proposals around the future management of the Murree and Boogtee tribes as well as his recommendation that Government relations with these tribes should not be handled directly but should go through the Political Agent at Khelat. The letter also outlines Colonel Phayre's proposals for the enacting of suggestions from the Punjaub Government on the protection of the frontier, and Merewether's disagreement with these proposals, giving reasons, and his alternative plan for taking these suggestions forward by using the local tribes to provide defensive forces for the frontier, along with details of costings for such a plan.The letter concludes by noting that the current sum of 50,000 rupees per annum which the British Government pays to the Khan under the terms of their treaty does not actually re-imburse him for the duties lost from leveies on merchants passing through his territory and that a further sum of 44,000 rupees per annum should be granted to aid the Khan in acting on his engagements in regards to cattle-lifting and intertribal quarrels.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024102474.0x000008#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
