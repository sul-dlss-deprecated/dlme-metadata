I am enclosing three copies of the proposed Concession Agreement which has been drawn up on the exact terms and conditions as that of December 2nd 1925, agreed by the Colonial Office in conference with representatives of The Eastern and General Syndic 8,*t e Limited.

From THE POLITICAL AGENT, BAHREIN. To iion T ble tue political in th e T exsian jlui f h li Utah ire... I have the honour to enclose in duplicate a communication I have received from Llajor Prank Holmes on behali oi the ^astern General Syndicate,together with two copies oi the proposed concession agreement. ihe j\uler of Bahrain is by Treaty precluded from entering into concessions for petroleum without the consent of his ajest/ f s Government ana this will, therefore,require a reference to them. The matter was discussea with you on your recent visit to Bahrain ana need not,therefore,be dealt with aflength. x may, however,say tnat I consider the State would oe foolish to part with a further area until they see the result of the bore hole now being made. If the bore is successful,the remaining area will naturally be of immense value ana the signing away^fthis potential asset ior the sum of Es* 10,000/- per year would appear most inadvisable. Further the additional concession would be a powerful bargaining counter should the State desire to amend the original concession in any way in the light of their experience. If no oil is found by the present bore the matter assumes a different aspect ana couid then be reconsidered in the light of inforration disclosed by deep boring. The Company have,ofcourse,still to select their lUu,J00 acres endana tnis area should,in itself,enable them to test thoroughly the potentialities of Bahrain.
