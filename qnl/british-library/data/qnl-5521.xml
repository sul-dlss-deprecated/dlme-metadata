In 1941, however, the landlord of the 3agh-i-3haikh refused to lease the buildings to us unless a substantial increase in the rental was made. I As no other suitable building was available in Shiraz the rent was increased to Rials 1,300/- ^er month as against the original rental of nials 1,000/- and a three year lease/was entered into with effect from 1st January 1941. This fact was not reported to the Government of India through an oversight but the extra expenditure incurred was found from within the sanctioned grant of Bushire Office Allowance. 2 . the Shiraz Since the summer of this year, however, owing to acti vities connected with the war, house rent in is gone up oy over 300^ and the landlord complain^ ed to my Secretary several times about the inadequacy of the rent. He also told some of his friends that he was not going to renew the lease after its expir/y on 31st December 1943. It was therefore thought that if negotiations for a fresh lease were left over to a date close to the expiry of the present lease we should have so negotiate under pressure and should either lose our lease or be obliged to pay an exorbitant rent. In fact we might # easily have had to pay Rials 4 ? 000/- per month. I.egotiasions were therefore entered into with the landlord for a fresh lease as a result of which the rent has been fixed at Rials 2,000/- per month with effect from the 1st November 1942. h fresh lease has accordingly been signed for the period ending 31st December 1945. ° hxtra expenditure incurred during the current financial year will be met from within my sanctioned budget grant out an additional grant of Rs.1,000/- for the next and subsequent financial years will be necessary. maaammmm.#’'■ K - and address— K 3406/1919Z2ilu E COPY ^ 12 .^ pc% Foreign Office: ~' not to any but to— “ The Under-Secretary of i tate.

November 19th,1939- Sir, With reference to your despatch No.3 (K 1020/1020/234) of the 2?th January 1938* regarding the office allowance assigned to this office, I have the honour to inform you that I have now concluded an agreement for the lease of a new consular rest-house and office and I enclose a translation of the contract which is valid for a period of one year from the 28th. October last with option of renewal on the same terms for two further periods of one year each* I have not yet been able to have the contract registered with the proper authorities owing to the absence of the landlord and the illness of his agent. 2* The rent for the present premises is the same as for the former house, namely four hundred and fifty rials a month. The garage however is not yet ready and until it is a sum of fity rials a month will be deducted from this amount. 3. As there is only one servant f s room in the new house it will be necessary to continue to provide the gatekeeper and his family with accommodation outside at a cost per month of fifty rials but owing to the present quarters being more compact than the former I expect to be able to economize this amount from the sum set aside for general maintenance* 4. I have inevitably incurred certain expenditure on moving in to the new house and rendering it habitable, the main items being (a) cartage and porterage/ His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, L 0 N D 0 N, S.W. 1Rials 36?. Rials 500 Rials 500. Rials 550* porterage three hundred and sixty seven rials, (h) fitting hand pump to well, which is the only water supply, five hundred rials, and (c) repairs to furniture and fitting wire netting to certain doors and windows approximately another five hundred rials. I trust I may have your approval for this expenditure which in view of the present necessity for economy has been kept as low as possible. 5* I would propose that Mr.Aratoon, the clerk in charge, be paid a sum of fifty rials a month for the period of eleven months during which this office has had no habitation, that is to say a total of five hundred and fifty rials, and I should be grateful if you would give your sanction for this expenditure also. During the whole of this time Mr.Apatoon has carried on the work of the office in a room in his own house and has stored several articles of office furniture and equipment there and all the stationery. 6. The rest of the furniture, archives and books, has been stored by the Imperial Bank of Iran in Isfahan free of charge* I have expressed to the local manager my appreciation of this courtesy but I feel it would be appropriate if a letter of thanks could also be addressed from the Foreign Office to the Bank^ head office in London. 7. Much of the furniture, which is maintained out of office allowance but v/hich consists of relics of unknown origin from the former Consulate General, was found to be superfluous. I accordingly sold what/what could not he made use of, together with the old tents which had not been used for fifteen years and were partly rat-eaten, and with the proceeds amountii^ Rials 3000. to some three thousand rials, I have provided the present house with china and glass (which I propose shall be reserved for the exclusive use of His Majesty’s Consul), leading lamps, new curtains and lampshades, and a sitting room carpet. I have also had several of the armchairs and settees re upholstered and made a quantity of minor replacements. A record of these transactions will be kept on file* A copy of the amended inventory is enclosed. 8. The new house is conveniently situated in the same avenue as the Governor’s private house,the Church Missionary Society’s hospital and the Irantours hotel. The accommodation consists of a sitting room with verandah, dining room, kitchen, double bedroom, single bedroom, office, bathroom, lavatory, servant’s room and store rooms. I enclose a copy of the tariff for visitors which I have revised in accordance with today’s prices. 9.

Paragraph 3 The Secretary of State will remember that the Royal Commission of Indian Expenditure reported as follows, (paragraph 242) **...We think that the charges of the mission and consulates should be evenly divided between the two countries. We think also that the British Foreign Office should not create or add to the Establishments and Services under its control without the consent of the Government of India and vice versa that the Government of India should not add to the Establishments and Services under their control without the consent of the Foreign Office. Lastly the charge as made up for division should be complete including outfits, pensions and all contingencies M My Lords suggest that subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of State for India, the numbers indicated in the foregoing extract should for the future be consistently applied but for the sake of simplicity Their Lordships for their part will be willing to agree that either party should be at liberty to incur fresh expenditure for salaries up to an amount not exceeding £100 per annum in the aggregate at any post under its control without previous reference to the other: and that previous concurrence need not be obtained for increases in contingencies (except as regards unusual items exceeding say £100 in each case), or in travelling. Each party would obtain the previous consent of the other for increased expenditure on Establishments under/under its control and each v/ould defray one half of the total additional expenditure (of v/hatever kind) incurred in any given year as compared with 1900. (Extract taken from Collection No. 239 Pile No. 3827/06; Prom Despatch No. 54(Political) dated 22nd May, 1908 from Secretary of State for India to the Governor-General. Paragraph 2. This expenditure exceeds the limit of £100 per year up to which fresh expenditure for salaries may he incurred at any post without previous reference to the Poreign Office and is moreover of a character which may possibly form a precedent for similar expenditure in other places. ( Extract taken from ) (Collection No. 215, Pile No. 763/08) Prom Government of India Despatch No. 194 of 1908, dated 3rd December 1908. Paragraph 6. With reference to para. 2 of Your Lordship*s Despatch, we understand that a project of new expenditure in Persia which is outside the marginally noted x limitations should be referred for Your Lordships previous sanction and we have arranged that this procedure should be followed in future. As regards fresh expenditure which falls within these limitations we have assumed from Your Lordshipte Political Despatch No. 5 dated 19th January 1906, that each case should be separately reported though previous sanction is not required. This entails some extra correspondence which is perhaps unnecessary in view of the fact that schedules of all possible expenditure are periodically submitted to the India Office and we will be glad to know whether we have correctly interpreted Your Lordship’s v/ishes3 in the matter. * (l) Fresh expenditure for salaries up to an amount not exceeding £100 per annum in the aggregate at one consulate. (2) Increased expenditure on contingencies except as regards an unusual item exceeding £ 100 , and (3) Increased expenditure on travel.

Under present conditions the rent hitherto paid for the Resthouse at Isfahan is a low one, and I think it was inevitable that the landlord should insist on an increase. The increase of Rials 1080 for which he asks is not very large, considering present conditions, and I trust that it will be possible to secure sanction for the renewal o^ the lease for one year from the 1st A.pril, 1938, at the rent now asked. I should be grateful if a reply might be sent to Mr.Watkinson*s despatch as soon as possible, since the landlord may come to regret his offer if rents continue to rise, 3.

Sir, With reference to Mr.Seymour’s despatch, No.282, of July 28 last, regarding the expenditure on the Consulate Office and Resthouse at Isfahan, I have the honour to report that it will not he possible to renew the lease of the present premises next year at the rental paid hitherto, namely four thousand three hundred and twenty rials per year. The adjoining premises, which were formerly offerred to His Majesty’s Government at a rental of six thousand rials per year are no*' occupied partly by the Anglo Iranian Oil Company on a one and a half year lease at a rental of six thousand two hundred and forty rials per year and partly by Herr Schunemann on a year lease at a rental of three thousand six hundred rials per year, a total of nine thousand eight hundred and forty rials per year, or over fifty per cent increase. A small new building, *hich the landlord has constructed on the street frontage between the Consulate Office and the Avenue Chahar Bagh, is let for three thousand eight hundred and forty rials per year. It consists of five rooms only. 2. Mr.Hovanessian originally asked for much more, but I have succeeded in securing his verbal agreement to accept a rental of five thousand four hundred rials per year/ His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Officeyear, which is a twenty five per cent in Rials ^0. Rials 1080. Rials 4200. Rials 4320. Rials 23,430. includes the garage for which the very low rent of one Hundred and twenty rials per year is now charged. 3. Rents have 'been soaring in Isfahan along with the general cost of living and I am satisfied that there is no likelihood whatever of my finding any other premises so centrally situated and well adapted in themselves at a lower rental than that now demanded. I have inspected various houses, none of which are suitable from any point of view. 4* l therefore beg to request sanction to renew the lease of the present premises as from April I next at the rental mentioned in paragraph 2. This will necessitate provision of an additional sum of one thousand and eighty rials in the office allowance as from April 1 next. 5. Through an unfortunate oversight in my despatch,No. 58, of April 19 last to His Majesty^ Minister at Tehran, the requirements for rent of premises for the current year are shown in paragrapn 8 to be four thousand two hundred rials. This does not include the charge for use of the garage, which brings the total yearly rental to four thousand three hundred and twenty rials, as stated in paragraph 17 of ray despatch. 6. The total expenditure for which His Majesty’s Minister asked sanction for the current financial year in paragraph 7 of his despatch under reference should be amended to read twenty three thousand four hundred and twenty rials.

I have requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to use their good offices in obtaining a postponement of the proposed demolition, but X fear that, owing to the fact that in Mr. Acting Consul uarell’s absence at Khorranshahr it has been impossible to make any strong protest locally, the representations made to the authorities in Tehran may have come too late to be effective. 2* Hr. Bareli has arranged for the house to be prepared for removal in case the representations made do fall. If, as now seems likely, demolition is proceeded with at once, arrangements will be made temporarily to store the furniture and archives with the Imperial Bank of Iran. The cyphers are already stored at the Bank, as I had the honour to confirm in my telegram No. 119 of the 6 th October, 1933. 3. As regards the future, X consiuer that a resthouso should, if possible, continue to be maintained at Isfahan, and I venture to hope that if satisfactory alternative accommodation can be found at a reasonable rental, sanction will be given for the lease of / new The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K.G., G.C.3.X., G.C.I.S., etc. , etc., etc., FOKSIGM OFFICK.new premises* 1 r.

As Your Lordship is aware, rents have risen sharply throughout Iran* and I fear that accommodation as good as that hitherto rented may possibly not be obtainable on the same terms as hitherto* aince, however, no appreciable eheo&amp; in the rise of rents is at present apparent, it seems that if new premises are to be obtained, the sooner it were done the better. 4. I am making enquiries regarding the terns of the cancellation of the present leasej Mr. 3ar« 11 thought it likely that the cancellation would date from the end of the month in which notice of demolition was given. So far as I as aware, however, no formal notice has yet been served on the landlord by the municipal authorities. I am also enquiring as to the possibility of obtaining compensation from the landlord, since the lease is valid until April next. But X fear it will not be possible to get anything. 5. I propose to bring to the notice of the Iranian Government the inconvenience which has been caused to His Majesty’s Government by the abrupt action of the Isfahan municipal authorities in this matter* I have the honour to be with the highest respect.

Sarell has had very little time to look round , 0) and it world not be fair to ask him to spend long in Isfahan after handing over to King at Shiraz, who is arriving later tnan was originally expected* Further, the rest-house is very little used during the winter ft j months, and no inconvenience is likely to be caused by its absence until, say, next April. The possibility of a rise in rents will be offset by the fact that about four months f rent will be saved. Rather than act now in a hurry, it therefore seems best to leave it to King to choose a house next year. We propose to ask the Imperial Bank of Iran to look out for any suitable houses which may come on the market in the interval. Yours ever, CHANCERY.

Please see the minutes at P.Z.1668/36 and P.Z.4115/36. 2.The Government of India agreed in May 1936 to the proposals of H.M.Minister, Tehran, that a house should be rented in Isfahan to provide office and living accommodation for H.M.Consul, Shiraz, during his periodical visits to that town, and to accommodate official and other travellers. A moiety of the cost involved,which was estimated at about Rials 23,600 (£380 per annum) for rent, etc. , and £120 per annum for subsistence and travelling allowances, was accepted as chargeable to Indian Revenues. The premises were leased,for one year in the first instance, on April 1st 1936 and the Foreign Office now propose that the arrangement should be continued. 3. In his report on the first year’s working of r‘ the scheme, H.M. Consul says that it has fully justified itself. The Minister agrees that it has proved a success and anticipates that the retention of the house will be justified for years to come. The scheme has not only proved satisfactory from the Consul’s point of view, but ^ some 30 visitors have made use of the rest house between August 1936 and April 1937, and an income of Rials 970 was derived from them. The actual expenditure during the first year showed a saving of Rials 2668 on the estimate. 4. During the current year a certain increase in expenditure is anticipated, partly upon the provision of furnishings and maintenance, and partly on account of an ruyolrtc increase in the cost of living bonusfto the Iranian staff but the total is still slightly less than that originally estimated for 1936. 5. There seems no reason to suppose that the Government of India will object to the continuance of the C063 Wt 9696/P 28 5000 4.37 10P scheme /scheme or to the acceptance of a moiety of the expenditure estimated for the current year, but it is proposed to ask their formal concurrence. 6.

Mr* Eden is approaching the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty*s Treasury for sanction to continue the existing arrangements at Isfahan, to accept the revised allowances proposed in paragraph 7 of His Majesty’s Minister’s despatch with effect from the 1st April last, for the continuance of the existing scheme for the payment of subsistence allowance to His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz during his visits to Isfahan on duty and for the charge to public funds of other reasonable miscellaneous expenditure including the cost of providing fire extinguishers. 3, I am to express the hope that Lord Zetland may be moved to obtain the concurrence of the Government of India in these proposals and their acceptance of a moiety of the charges involved.

The submission of this report to you has been delayed, as it was necessary to refer certain points back to Mr. Watkinson for further elucidation. 2. It will be seen that the total expenditure under the various headings of the estimate submitted in paragraph 6 of Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Huge 88 en , s despatch No. 17 of the 10th January, 1936, and including miscellaneous office expenditure, was Rials 20,932. There was a saving of rials 2,768 an the estimated expenditure (which was sanctioned in ^5 your despatch No. 100 (K 2238/1242/239) of the 3rd March, 1936). The saving was effected In rent and in gardener* s wages through taking a smaller house than that originally contemplated. In addition a sura of Rials 865.50 was spent on repairs, decorations, provision of necessary fittings etcetera. This item was by an oversight not included in the original estimate of expenditure. It was met in the year 1936A93? by drawing on the sum of Rials 1174 which was The Right Honourable Anthony Rden, M.O., M.P., etc*, etc*, etc., THE FORKION OFFICE*was available rrom the sale of furniture etcetera left behind by forn&gt;'r Consuls-Oeneral. Payments to public funds by visitors totalled Rials 970. In addition, a saving of Rials 200 a month to public funds will be effected during the period of about four months when the two Probationer Vice-Consuls stationed at Shirax are in residence at Isfahan, and therefore require no rent allowance. 3. As I had anticipated, Mr. V/atkinson has found it necessary to recommend increased expenditure in certain items during the current year. As you are aware, the cost of living Is rising rapidly in Iran, and it will be remembered that an increase of 15 in the bonus payable to the Iranian staff of His Majesty’s Legation has recently been sanctioned. I consider that the cost of living fully justified an increase in the salaries paid at Isfahan, and I should be grateful if sanction could be obtained for the payment of the increases proposed by Mr. Watkinson in paragraph 5 of his despatch, with effect from the 1st April Ixst. 4. Provision should be made in the authorised expenditure for the present year for the general maintenance of the house and its contents. The Representative of His Majesty’s Office of Works, who visited Isfahan in October,1936, has estimated the cost of maintenance at Rials 750 during the present year. This includes expenditure on the furniture and kitchen utensils. It will be remembered that in paragraph 4 of his despatch No * 263 , Qf the 25th May 1936, Mr. Butler suggested that the maintenance of the furniture should be undertaken by the Office of Works, but the proposal was not pursued in view of the objections raised by that Department (see the enclosure to your despatch No. 362 (K 9722/1242/234) of the 7th September, 1936* ) In the circumstances it appears that payment for the maintenance of furniture etcetera out of Foreign Office funds is the only practicable/practicable course. His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz already has a house to maintain there, while visitors already pay to public . funds as much as can be reasonably asked of them* The amount involved is very small* I trust therefore that it will be possible to obtain sanction for expenditure up to Rials 750 in the current year on decorations and upkeep of furniture, fittings etcetera* In return it would be understood that the furniture, fittings and cooking utensils, of which an inventory was enclosed in Mr. Butler’s despatch j o. 426 of the 17th September, 1956 and which were not paid for by His Majesty’s Government but left behind by former Consuls-General, should now become the property of His Majesty’s Government* 6 * Finally Mr. Watkinson recommends a small capital i'* expenditure on floor coverings and baths* The present floor coverings are worn out and extremely shabby, while the baths are very primitive tin tubs* The estimated cost of floor- coverings given in paragraph 15 of Mr* ^atkinson’s despatch was based on an error in measurement. He has now informed me that he estimates the cost of carpeting the four principal rooms with local H ziloos” to be Rials 1050* I concur in Mr. Watkinson's opinion that the proposed expenditure on floor coverings and baths is desirable, and I trust that it may be sanctioned. 6. There is one further item to which Mr. Watkinson does not refer in his despatch, but which has formed the subject of direct correspondence between him and your Department, namely fire-extinguishers (see your despatch to Mr. Watkinson No. 4 (K 4765/2991/234) of the 27th April.) Mr. Watkinson in his despatch in reply No. 13 of the 30th June stated that he did not wish extinguishers to be supplied, presumably because the expenditure at present authorised provides no funds tor this 7 ouPpose/purpose. I consider that it is important that extinguishers should be available at IsTahan and I should therefore be grateful ^ sanction could be given for the payment of the cost of three extinguishers, with spare charges, and of their transport to Isfahan. The total cost with transport should not exceed £10. If sanction is obtained, I should be grateful if the Office of Works could be requested to despatch the fire-extinguishers as soon as possible. 7. The total expenditure for which I would request sanction during the current financial year is therefore as follows: -CvU O’ )&gt; Clerk's salary 10,200 Rent 4,200 2 Ghulams’ wages 3,960 Part-time gardener 360 Clothing 800 Medical allowance 400 No-Ruz gratuities 1,150 Maintenance of house and fittings 750 Floor-coverings 1,050 Baths 440 23,310 together with ^easonab e expenditure on other necessary office and miscellaneous items, and with the cost of fire- extinguishers. This expenditure is slightly less than that sanctioned by your despatch No. 100 of the 5th March, 1 &gt;36. I fully share Mr. Watkinson’s opinion that the Consular office and Resthouse scheme has proved a success, and I think it should remain one. The scope and value of the information regarding Isfahan and district available in His Majesty’s Legation has increased appreciably in the past year. At the same time the existence of the office and Resthouse provides a valuable change for His Majesty's Consul at Shiraz and for Probationer Vice- Consuls/Consuls stationed at that place. Mr. Sarell and Mr. Cecil, who are spending the summer at Isfahan, have found better Persian teaclers there and have also found social intercourse with Persians easier. There seems every reason to expect that the maintenance of the Consular office and. Resthouse will be justified for many years, and I therefore trust that sanction may be obtained for the expenditure during the current year of the amount recommended in the preceding paragraphs. 8. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz No. 17. I have, etc., (3d.) H.J.8BYM0UR.British Consulate Office, Isfahan# April 19, 1937 Sir, With reference to your despatch No. 2 of the 23rd February last regarding the Consular office and resthouse at Isfahan, I have the honour to report as follows on the arrangements which have existed since April 1, 1936, when the present premises were leased. 2. The office has remained in charge of Mr. Aratoon, assisted by two ghulams, under the superintendence of the Consular officer in charge at Shiraz. During the twelve months ended March 31 last, 127 telegrams and letters were received and 133 despatched, as compared with 189 and 120 respectively during the previous twelve months. Fees collected and credited to His Majesty’s Government through the Shiraz quarterly account amounted to two hundred and Rials 218. eighteen rials in the year ended March 31, 1937. Expenditure during the same period amounted to rials as follows: salary of clerk rent of premises salaries of 2 ghulams salary of part-time gardener cost of clothing for 2 ghulams No rouz gratuities 10 , 200 .- 4,320.- 3,600. 360. 766.- 300.- miscellaneous office expenditure 1,101.40 20,647.40 postages His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, etc., etc., etc. , British Legation, TEHRAN*(O postals and telegrams Rials 20,647,40 284.60 20,932.- Rials 970. 3, The resthouse has accommodated thirty visitors since rules were drawn up and fixed charges instituted last August, Of these, five were members of the Legation staff, ten consular officers and their families, three members of the Indian Political service, and twelve others. The sum of nine hundred and seventy rials was credited to His Majesty 1 s Government from August to end of March in respect of resthouse charges. This would appear to Rials 1,300, indicate a possible yearly revenue of about one thousand three hundred rials. But during the current year I expect to be in residence for two months and the house is to be occupied for four months by the two Probationer Vice Consuls from Shiraz. In consequence, guests can probably only be taken in on a paying basis during the six months of the year. 4* Actual expenditure on repairs, painting and fitting up of rooms in the house up to the present has amounted Rials 855.5r\ to eight hundred and fifty five rials and fifty dinars. This included provision of straw blinds, door and window frames with wire netting and wire springs, and a large stove with piping; whitewashing and distempering of three living rooms and the kitchen; repairs to stoves and to the kitchen grate; and the washing of rugs and Rials 1,174. mats. Towards this, the sum of one thousand one hundred and seventy four rials was available from sale of effects at the former Consulate General, as reported in my predecessor* spredecessor’s Chancery Note No* 221 of April IS# 1936* Rials 318*50 A balance of three hundred and eighteen rials and fifty dinars remains in hand* This may cover the cost of distempering the remaining rooms and of sundry necessary small repairs. 5* There is no doubt in my mind that the retention both of the office and of the resthouse has fully justified itself, and that they should be maintained as at present* You have already submitted your views to the Secretary of State regarding the usefulness of the Consulate office in Isfahan and of regular visits being paid by the consular officer from Shiraz, with which I venture to express my agreement* As regards the resthouse, I think that its existence has been appreciated by all those who have stayed in it, thanks very largely to the services of Ramazan and his equipment* I therefore beg to submit the following proposals for the future* 6. The salaries at present paid to the staff were fixed some years ago* In the last three years the cost of living and of practically all necessaries of life in Isfahan has increased by I am aware that the work done by the clerk is none too onerous* The same applies to the gate-keeper, ghulam Abbas Beg* But they both devote their whole time to our service and they have both completed about twenty years of service* The other ghulam, Ramazan, has opportunities of earning money when employed in the reethouse and, when not so employed, he has been permitted to take outside employment* Had it not been so, he would long since have left us* It will not be possible for him to be employed outside so long as the Probationer Vice Consuls or myself are in residence here*'V here# I therefore would recommend that sanction he given for the payment of an increase of 10$ in the salary of both ghulams and that, in future, a No Rous gratuity of one month’s salary he paid to the clerk, Mr. Aratoon, as is the practice at Shiraz and as la paid to the rest of the staff here. X would also request that an allowance not Rials 100. to exceed one hundred rials per quarter he sanctioned to meet necessary medical expenses of the three memhers of the staff as is the usual practice at Consular posts in this country. Even so the total remuneration will he far helow that paid at Shiraz where the cost of living is slightly lower. 7. I would add that the amount paid to Ramazan under the resthouse rules for the use of his crockery linen and Rials 750. other services, has amounted to seven hundred and fifty rials in seven months, plus an occasional tip. He would have earned more outside the consulate. 8. Other expenditure, as approved hy the Foreign Office last year, should remain approximately the same. The estimated requirements are thus as follows.— salary of clerk 10,200 rials rent of premises 4,200 salaries of 2 ghulams 3,960 pay of part time gardener 360 clothing for 2 ghulams 800 medical allowance 400 No Rouz gratuities 1,160 21,070 9. An appreciahle saving in rent and gardener’s wages hashas been effected hy leasing a smaller house than was ^ originally contemplated* I am now satisfied that the smaller building is quite adequate* So f with the necessary small miscellaneous office expenses, in addition to the above requirements, the total expenditure for the current year should not exceed the sum of twenty three thousand Rials 23,600. six hundred rials estimated in Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessers despatch No* 17 to the Foreign Office of January 10, 1936, and sanctioned in Foreign Office despatch No* 100 (K 2238/1242/234) of March 5th, 1936. 10* There remains the question of the flagstaff, the coftt of arms plaque, and upkeep of the resthouse and of its contents for the future* 11. I propose immediately to erect a flagstaff in accordance with Mr* Loxley’e letter No* 65/83/36 of 4th November last to Mr. Oault, charging expenses to the office Rials 90* account, which will amount to ninety rials, including the cost of a ladder. A flag has been supplied from Shiraz. 12. As the Probationer Vice Consuls are to spend the summer here, it might be advisable to defer any action regarding the plaque, lest tutors or other visitors be frightened away* A simple brass plate with the words ’’British Consulate Office”, might serve the purpose equally well without the deterrent effect of a large official shield. A local estimate of the cost of such a plate, 12 in. x 9 in., Rials 50. is fifty rials. 13. The future upkeep of the resthouse was dealt with in Mr. Keif’s minute of the 23rd November, 1936. It would be most helpful if he could visit Isfahan once or twice a year, as he suggested, the more so if the expenditure of funds based on hie recommendations could be authorised or ifif he can provide some of the necessary materials. I am in agreement with hie estimate of requirements for the coming year, as followsi- decorations 200 rials new furniture and fittings 300 maintenance of existing furniture 200 replacement of kitchen utensils 50 14* It will he necessary to provide funds for these purposes and it is also highly desirable that the present bathroom appliances should be improved and that more adequate floor coverings be provided in the house* 15. The carpeting of two rooms per year with plain 'ziloos* as suggested by Mr* Keif, would cost at least Rials 1,600 fifteen hundred rials at present prices. 'Eiloos* sufficient to cover the largest bedroom, 56 ft. x 11 ft. were bought here by Mr. Summerhayes in 1935 at a cost of eight hundred Rials 825. and twenty five rials. The drawing room measures 56 ft. x 19 ft. Since then the cost has increased by 2S$ f being now fifty rials per shah man. If new carpeting could be provided for these rooms, there are sufficient remnants for the remainder of the house and offices. 16. In Mr. Reilly’s letter to me of February 24th last, Mo. 29/13/2?, he forwarded Mr. Keif’s estimate for provision of two large size baths with hot and cold water tanks. Two long copper baths could be installed at a cost of Rials 320. three hundred and twenty rials for each, and, though it could certainly be improved upon, the present method of carrying hot water from the kitchen is probably adequate, for in any case all cold water would have to be carried from there to fill the tanks if they existed in the bathroomsbathrooms* Cold water tanks could be supplied for about one hundred and twenty rials* I should therefore prefer to economise on the bathrooms and spend a little on replacing the unutterably shabby collection of floor coverings. 17* A new agreement has been signed with effect from April l t providing for the lease of the premises which we now occupy for one year at a monthly rental of three hundred and sixty rials, with first refusal for a similar period subsequently* The lease rent includes use of garage, for which we have hitherto paid separately, and supply of water for the garden* The landlord has recently replastered the exterior of the buildings where necessary and whitewashing is at present in progress* Provision is made for two new bathrooms to be available, with tiled floors and the necessary drainage, in the event of the landlord taking away the present bathrooms which he states to have been sold along with the adjoining property* 18* The landlord declines to agree to an option of renewal of the lease on similar conditions in respect of rent for a third year* No such provision was made in the previous lease* It is not without difficulty that he has been persuaded to accept the same rent for this year* The new agreement has been registered in the Sabt-i-Asnad office and it thus gives complete security of tenure, so that Mr. Aratoon’s periodical scares may now be safely ignored* 19* I have also looked into the question of resthouse charges to visitors as laid down in the Rules forwarded to His Majesty’s Consulate at Shiraz along with Mr. Butler’s despatch No* 15 of May 25, 1936. 20. The contribution by visitors to public funds appear to be adequate and, as mentioned above, it would sufficeRials 100. suffice for the maintenance and upkeep of the resthouee were the accoramoantion not required hy myself or by Probationer Vice Consuls during a large part of the year* SI* The charges which are paid to Ramazan, the ghulam, also seem to be satisfactory with the exception of payment for fires* I would recommend that charges under (b), (c) and (d) be amended as follows (b) 2* Stove during meals in the dining room. (H.B* There is no fireplace)* (a). Fires in the rooms other than the dining room:- Rials 1. (D fire in bedroom in morning rials 1 per hour Rials 1.

(IV) fire all day in any room •*..••• rials 8 22* As regards visits of more than a fortnight’s duration by myself or Probationers, I have arranged with Ramazan to receive one hundred rials per month for the use of his equipment, but not including bed or table linen. This naturally does not cover food, household stores, or service, for which a special arrangement must be made to suit each case. I have, etc. (Signed) A*K.

Rent for the furniture supplied for the private portions, i.e. portions which are not set apart for use as an office or for the reception of visitors is ordinarily payable and the Government of India regret that they do not see sufficient justification for a departure from the ordinary practice. The rate at which rent should bo recovered is under consideration but it will not exceed 12 per cent per annum on the' capital cost. * 3 o It is accordingly requested that the information called for in the memorandum from the Government of In-da. in th^ Foreign and Political Department No.F.189-A/'3&amp;, dated the 7th December 1936 may kindly be furnished as early as possible.Go~y of a memo randum No.649/26/37, dated Bushire, tho 6th A-'-ril 1937. from the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government cf India, New Delhi* Subj ect Rent for furniture supplied fer the summer headquarters at Shiraz* Reference Foreign and Political memorandum No.F.189- A/35, dated the 17th March 1937* 2, ..i ■ The buildings leased for tho recess of the political Resident comprise three small separate bungalows and half of another small bungalow - all in one compound. 3 # Last year the Officiating Resident spent 1 month in Shiraz, and the Secretary two periods of a fortnight ana a week. This was owing to the staff being short handed on account of there being no permanent Under Secretary. 4 , 4 Ls a result of the shortness of time spent in Shiraz combined with the dilatoriness of the Shiraz car r enters when released from personal supervision, ^nly a proportion of the furniture could be purchased, and this had to be movec round from house to house according to whether the officiating Resident was in occupation, or some other oflicer* 5. Until an opportunity can be taken to complete the purchase cf the furniture, it must necessarily remain in a state of flux as between house and house. In these circumstance it is not yet possible to distinguish between furniture supplied for the private portions of the bungalows and that supplied for offices and the reception of visitors. 6, For present purposes the distribution may be taken as approximately h?.lf and ha.lf, and a precise clia*ssification will be made when the position as regards the furniture has become static* 7, It is presumed that rent will only be charged for the period during which pjiy particular building is cccupicd.From - The Under Secreidry to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, To - The Hon t ble the* Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Memorandum No .F.l'89“A./35, Simla, the £7^ May 1937.

I agree that it is impossible to see why the foreign Office should link up the financial aspects of these two questions. There is, of course, a general connection between the two questions (which were treated together in the Government of India’s letter of 12th January at P.Z. 704/37), since the necessity for the Political Resident hiring quarters at Shiraz arises out of the fact that the Shiraz Residency is being taken over as a oerrnanent residence for the Shiraz A. Consul; but this can hardly affect in any way the liability of Imperial revenues to share recurrent Bushire expenditure. We might merely put the paper by, or possibly it might, if you agree, be worth our sending a demi- official letter to the foreign Office Consular Dept, expressing our inability to see why they should connect the two questions (■rT#In any furtfter communication on this subject, please quote No.K 2958/410/234. and address— not to anil person by name but to— “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. 1841 | . !957 i Foreign Office.

(K 13868/1242/234) BRITISH LEGATION, No.65/88/56 TEHRAN. 26th November, 1936. Dear Department, Your despatch No.362 (K 9722/1242/234) of the 7th September about the Isfahan Consulate Resthouse. 2. Keif has recently been to Isfahan and has now given us his report on the Resthouse. After reconsider ing the question of the maintenance of the furniture in the light of his observations, we feel that it would be better not to pursue the suggestion, made in paragraph 4 of our despatch No.263 of the 25th May, that the Office of Works should take over the furniture and maintain it. The sum involved is likely to be very small, and it seems unnecessary to complicate matters by bringing in the Office of Works. No expenditure is immediately necessary on the furniture etcetera and we would there fore suggest that a decision about the provision of funds for the maintenance of the furniture, floor coverings, etcetera should be postponed until the spring, when we shall be reporting on the first year’s working of the present arrangement, and will include proposals about the furniture among our other recommendations. 3. We are sending a copy of this letter to Shiraz. Yours ever, CHANCERY The Consular Department, The Foreign Office, LONDONCOPY (K 9722/1242/234) D.C.9/34442. Storey’s Gate, Westminster, S.W.l 27 August, 1936. Dear Scott I am sorry for the delay in replying to your official letter of the 6th July (K.6898/1242/234) regarding the Consular Rest House at Isfahan hut we are not at all happy about the suggestion that we should take over the household furniture and maintain it free of charge to the residents and we have, of course, no authority to do so. As you know it is a condition of the provision and upkeep of residential furniture by this Department for Consular staff that a rent should be paid of 7^$, and if a rent in this case is to be paid at all it would be better for some charge to be included in the tariff which could be accumulated to pay for subsequent upkeep - the fund for upkeep being started with the balance referred to of Rials 1174. I see, however, that a charge for this purpose is not looked upon with favour by Mr. Nevile Butler, but on the face of it some charge is properly payable for the use of the furniture as it is in the case of the domestic equipment, and such a charge should not I imagine increase the total charge unduly. We are prepared, of course, to assist you in assessing a charge if you will let us have particulars of the articles, their condition and their approximate value. Yours sincerely, (Signed) J.E.Winter David Scott, Esq., C.M.G., Foreign Office, Whitehall, S.W.lCOPY (K 11062/1242/234) British Legation, No. 426 (65/74/36) Gulhek. 17th September, 1936. Sir, With reference to my despatch No. 263 of the 25th May, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith an inventory of all the furniture and equipment in the Isfahan Consulate Resthouse which is at present the property neither of His Majesty^ Government nor of the ghulam Ramazan, and which I would suggest should now he taken over by the Office of Works. 2. It has been found necessary to carry out certain minor repairs and additions to the Resthouse, such as the provision of fly screens to the doors, and of sun-blinds on the verandahs. Some work on the decoration of the interior of the house is also now necessary, if it is to be in a fit state for His Majesty’s Consul to do some entertaining there on his visits to Isfahan: in particular ceilings and walls require doing up where electric light fittings have been removed. All this work, some of which was urgently necessary and none of which the landlord will carry out, can be covered by the sum of Rials 1174 in hand from the sale of furniture, and I have therefore ventured to authorise Mr. Gault to proceed with it forthwith. 3. It is hoped that Mr. Keif will be able to visit Isfahan in about a month’s time. His report should enable me to inform you of the annual amount likely to be required for the upkeep of the furniture and equipment and for any decoration The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., etc., etc., etc..

It will he observed that the ex-Ziegler house, the lease of which was proposed in Sir Hughe. Knatchbull- ’ugessen’s despatch No.17 of the 10th January, proved not to be available. Mr.Hoyland therefore leased a hodse next door, which is the property of the same landlord. The terms of the lease give His ajesty’s Government the option of moving into the other house should it fall vacant at any time. I have recently been informed that the tenant of the other house intends to vacate it shortly. If this is in fact the case, it will, thus be possible to obtain possession of it forthwith.-. it appears, however, that the present house is adequate for the purpose: in fact the oriental Secretary at this Legation, who knows both houses, considers that it is more suitable than the ex- iegler house, since it has more rooms. Further the rent of the present house is only Rials 350 (£4. 7. Gd) per month, as againsl Rials 500 (£6. 5. 0) and, by taking the smaller property, it has been possible to do without a full-time gardener. To move into the ex-Ziegler house now would thus involve an additional /annual The Right Honourable, Anthony Eden, m.C...P., etc., etc. , etc., The Foreign Office.annual expenditure of Rials 1800 for rent, and Rials 1940 for the wages and clothes of the gardener, making a total of Rials 3,740 (£46* 15, 0)# Mr. and rs. Hoyland went to considerable trouble to arrange the present house, and in all the circumstances, I consider that there is nothing to be gained by moving into the ex-Ziegler house. 3. I have given careful consideration to the arrangements which are nov necessary for the running of the Rest House, and I have the honour to enclose a copy of a despatch to the Acting British Gons 1 at Shiraz, embodying my conclusions. It will be observed that the proposed charges have been divided into three categories. This is necessary because all the linen, blankets, cutlery and crockery are the property of the ghul^m Ramazan, who will expect some payment for their use and to cover cost of replacements from all visitors, -hether on duty or not. I consider therefore that the charges in categories (b) and (c) should also be paid by officers on duty, who will presumably be in receipt of the usual subsistence allowance. 4. Finally, as pointed out by r.Koyland in paragraph 7 of his despatch, it is necessary to provide for the maintenance of the furniture, floor coverings etc., which are not ( overnment property. As stated in paragraph 4 of ir eginald 'oare's despatch No.427 of the 19th eptember 1934, the household furni ture in the former Consulate-General was not the property of His ajesty's Government. It was left by former Consuls-General for the use of their successors. Then the former Consulate^ eneral was vacated, some of this furniture, which was not orth keeping, was sold and the proceeds retained by His majesty’s Consul for use in the event of a Rest louse being established. After certain expenditure on cooking utensils and other household /equipmentequipment, the balance of this fund now amounts to Rials 1174 (£ 14,8.6d)• No inventory of the furniture and equipment is available here, but Mr^Aratoon is being instructed to prepare ^ one, and a copy will be forwarded to you as soon as possible. It is clearly necessary to provide for the upkeep of this non- Government property, without which the Uest House would be useless. To ma^e a further charge ear-marked for this purpose would increase the total charges unduly, and would at the same time involve somewhat complicated accounting. I consider that the simplest course would be for the whole of the furniture etc. , together with the balance of Rials 1174 from the sale of furni ture, to be taken over the the Office of norks,who in return would undertake the necessary upkeep. I would venture to suggest for your consideration that this course should be adopted. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Acting British Consul, Shiraz No.15. I have, etc. (Signed) NKVIL3 BUTLER.1 / Copy. No. 8. o Sir, A U. BritiBh Consulate, Shiraz, April 15th, 1936. I have the honour to submit a report upon my visit to Isfahan between March 20th and April 12th for the purpose of the removal of the consulate offices and » f rest-house rt to new quarters. 2) — My extended stay of 22 days at Isfahan was caused firstly by the difficulty in finding suitable accommodation and secondly by having had to wait for over two weeks before the only suitable house could be evacuated by a temporary tenant. The premises were eventually taken possession of on April 8th. 3) ~ The houee is situated at the river end of the chahar Bagh and is owned by the heirs of the late Carabet Hovanessian, represented by Mr. Levon C. Hovanessian. The agreement made by me provides for a lease of one year, with the option of renewal for a similar term, upon a monthly rental of Rials 350 payable in arrear. It is understood with the owners that we have the first refusal of the ex-Ziegler house, the lease of which expires in about a year, at a rental of Rials 500 per mensem. The owner will convert old stables with a door along side our present entrance on the Chahar Bagh to serve as a garage for one car. Nevile M. 4)- as the garden area in the present compound is small I have not engaged a gardener but have made arrangements with the gardener of the larger property adjacent (ex-Ziegler house) / to/ Butler, Esq. , C.V.O. , etc. , etc., etc* , His Majesty's Chargd d’Affaires, British Legation, Tehran.-I* Mnig to laaintain and water the grounus for the sum of Rials 30 per mensem* 5)~ The annual expenditure for the staff at Isfahan is at present as follows: Rent of premises Rials 4200 Balary of Cleric 10200 Salary of Gholam Ramazan 1800 Salary of Gholam-doorkeeper Abbas Beg 1800 Salary of the part-time gardener 360 Suits, say 600 No Ruz presents &amp; gratuities, aay 400 Total: Rials 19360 plus certain sundry office ex£&gt;enses. 6) - The cost of the move amounted to Rials 394* a sum which will he debited in my account current with the Foreign Office for the June Quarter 1936* 7) - A decision should now he taken fixing the sum to he charged officials using the 'rest-house' at Isfahan when not on duty and other recommended travellers. if these receipts are to he credited to the Foreign Office accounts (as provided for in Foreign Office despatch No. 100 (K 2238/1242/234) of the 6th March 1936 addressed to you) I do not see how maintenance and upkeep of the furniture, floor coverings, kitchen utensils, etc., is to he provided for. It should he noted that all the house linen, blankets, cutlery and crockery in the 'rest-house' are the property of the gholam Ramazan, to whom they wex^e givon frjjr Mr. consul General Bristow, and that he expects visitors to make a payment xor the use of this material, over and ahove the cost of catering for them. 8) - With reference to your despatches Nos. 8 and 9 of the 3rd instant, I consider that all the furniture in the offices and the house is now required in the present premises. 9) - During the move into the new quarters the services of'' the/the gholam Kamazan proved moat helpful. The arrangement of the residential part of the house, etc.# was made by my wife. I have, etc., (Signed) H.A.D. KOYLAHD. H.B.M, Consul.i dritieh Legation, 6^48/36) Tehran. Copies to F.O. 25th May, 1956. Sir, With reference to Mr. Holland 1 s despatch No.8 of the 15th April, I transmit to you herewith a copy of a despatch which I addressing to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs regarding the arrange ments made at Isfahan by Mr. Hoyland, and submitting a proposal for the maintenance of the non-Governraent furniture etc., in the Rest House. 2 . I have had under consideration the question of the charges to be paid by visitors to the Rest House, and of other necessary arrary ement s. I have reached the conclusion that the following rules should be observed. (a) Visitors may only use the Rest House with the written permission of either his Majesty’s Legation at Tehran, or His Majesty’s Consulate at Shiraz. Discretion must obviously be exercised in the grant of such permission, which must in any case be confined to british subjects of good standing. Whenever permission to use the Rest House is given, a brief telegram should be sent to His Majesty’s Legation or to His Majesty’s Consulate at Shiraz, as the case may be, stating the names of the authorised visitors and the length of their stay. (b) The charges paid by visitors should be in accordance with the enclosed list of rules. It should be noted that the chargee in categories (b) and (c) should be paid by officers on duty, other than His Majesty's Consul at Shiraz. A cooy Of His Majesty's Consulate, Shiraz. ! V ' \ of there r^-iles ahould be kept re dily available at Hie ^ajeety^ Conciliate and shown to all intending visitors. 3. You should now inform Mr. Aratoon that he should only admit visitors as provided in paragraph 2 (a) above. You sho Id furnish him with a copy of the enclosed rules, and should instruct him to ensure that they are hilly understood by Ramazan, and to post up a copy in a conspicuous position in the Rest House. It should be explained to Ramazan that the charges for meals have been fixed on the advice of ladies faxniliar with present conditions in Isfahan: It should also be made clear to him that the fixed payment of one toman per heaa per night made to him is intended to cover the coot of upkeep of equipment which is hi© property, and that he will oe expected to maintain it in good condition. You should explain that these charge© do not apply to visits by His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz, who should make his own arran; ements for food and service: nor to any visits by Probationer Vice-Consuls or others lasting longer than a fortnight, for which special arrangements will be made in each case. You should also inform Mr. Aratoon that if he or Ramazan wish to make any comments on the arrangements outlined : in this despatch, they should be submitted to you without delay Finally you should instruct ar. Aratoon to prepare as soon as possible a rough plan of the accommodation in the Rest House, and also a full inventory of all the contents of the house which are neither the property of His &amp;aje ty’s Government nor of the Ghulara Ramazan. You should forward copies of these to me as soon as possible. 4, The arrangement; laid down in thi. despatch must of I necessity be somewhat experimental, and may oi course be modified if necessary. You should not hesitate to inform me if at iiny time you consider any modification necessary. 5. You / ■naB9M5. You should take steps to ensure that this despatch is brought to the notice of successive j-ncumbents of your post. 6.

Some doubt is felt here as to whether the amount of Rs.31,234 is correct. 3. The cost of original construction in 1900-1903 is shown in the statement accompanying Government of India’s Despatch No.136 of 1903, dated 3rd September 1903, as Rs.37,068 plus Rs.6,237 (making Rs.43,305) plus establishment charges of Rs.7,160. The item of Rs.6,237 was not included in the amount claimed from the Foreign Office (see my predecessor’s Political Despatch No.75 of 29th July 1904), possibly because it was then thought to represent expenditure before 30th September 1900 and therefore wholly an Indian charge. It should apparently now be charged to His Majesty’s Government in full. 4. The establishment charges of Rs.7,160 were included in the claim made on the Foreign Office, and as the presentrpractice is to adjust such charges as part of the cost of major works, this amount should apparently be included now. 5. If conclusions suggested in paragraphs 3 &amp; 4 above are correct, the amount chargeable in respect of the original construction would become a moiety of Rs.37,0o8/2 Rs.37,068 + Rs.7,160 = Rs.22,114, plus Rs.6,237, or Rs.28,351, and the total amount payable by His Majesty 1 s Government Rs.37,932 instead of Rs.31,234. 6 . The cost of additions and improvements from 1919-20 to 1934-35 is shown in your Express Letter as Rs.10,228 to 1927-28, shared in moieties, and Rs.4,467 thereafter, borne entirely by the Government of India, and such evidence as canb e traced at this Office shows that these amounts are prime costs with no allowance for establishment charges. it has not been found possible to determine whether the Public 'vTorks Department in the Persian Gulf is actually responsible for minor works at Shiraz and if so to what extent, although a reference to a visit there by the Assistant Engineer appears in the Political Resident’s memorandum No.2240/28/37, dated 6 th October 1934, to the Foreign Department, but it appears desirable to investigate whether establishment charges connected with the capital works since 1919-20 have in fact been incurred, as these also should presumably be taken into account in calculating the Foreign Office liability.

J/ The point regarding departmental charges applies also to the expenditure incurred since 1927-28 which has heen 'borne entirely 'by India. since replying to the earlier reference, this Department has been able to trace certain Political Department papers relating to several of the items concerned which are listed in one of the enclosures to P.Z.9015/35 hereunder. They show fairly conclusively that the amounts are actual costs irrespective of establishment charges. At the same time papers regarding the principles governing the execution of public works in the Gulf have also come to light, vide P.2162/17, and these create a doubt as to the extent to which the Public Jj/orks^^Works establishment is concerned with minor worKs at Shiraz, which it will he observed is classified as an 'inaccessible post'. At the same time it is stated in P.Z.6868/34 that the Assistant Engineer had visited Shiraz in connection with a project then under discussion. In the circumstances this Department would prefer to reword para. 6 as follows: '6. The cost of additions and improvements from 1919-20 to 1934-35 is shown in your Express letter as Rs.10,228 to 1927-28, shared in moieties, and Rs.&lt;t,467 thereafter, borne entirely by the Government of India, and such evidence as can be traced at this Office shows that these amounts are prime costs with no allowance for establishment charges. It has not been found possible to determine whether the Public Works Department in the Persian Gulf is actually responsible for minor works at Shiraz and if so to what extent, although a reference to a visit there by the Assistant Engineer appears in the Political Resident’s memorandum Ho.2240/28/37 dated 6th October 1934, to the Foreign Department, but it appears desirable to investigate whether establishment charges connected with the capital works since 1919-20 have in fact been incurred, as these also should presumably be taken into account in calculating the Foreign Office liability'.

Minute Paper. 4424 5000 1/36 capital/ The Shiraz Residency buildings were originally constructed for the use of the Political Resident in the . Persian Gulf during his recess from Bushire in the summer months. The capital cost involved was Rs.43,305 (vide H.M.Consul and staffj and various temporary expedients have been resorted to when the Resident came up from Bushire to recess. The present position is that a property has been hired at a joint cost to Imperial and Indian revenues in undisturbed (P.Z.704/36). Prom the Foreign Office point of view, Shiraz now being regarded as a permanent post, any other drroiaion would be inconvenient. Accordingly a d.o. enquiry was made^ D.Scott of the Foreign Office last June as to the terns on which the G*of I. would be ready to hand over the house to H.M.G.(P.Z.4327/35), reference therein being made to the possible removal of the Bushire Residency to the other side of the Gulf, in which event Shiraz would become useless to the G.of 1. The G.of 1., in their reply dated 12th January, quite naturally stipulate that the question of transfer to the Shiraz post and the future of the Residency should be kept distinct. For the rest, the price of Rs.31,234 which they ask is based on the statement of capital expenditure at Shiraz Consulate buildings enclosed with the Political Residents express letter to the G.of I. dated 3rd November i 1935 (P.Z.9015/35). In 1930 the G.of I. decided (vide Foreign Secretary^ letter of the 13th March, No.F.36 a/ 30 at P.2104/30) not to charge H.M.G. with any part of the G.of I.»s letter of the 3rd September 1903 No.136). This cost was borne jointly by Imperial and Indian revenues (j)UttoO fvov* (vide R&gt;UlVrcA (AAbcfc The buildings have subsequently been used to house order to accommodate the Resident while leaving the Consul poMtruv*: capital expenditure on the Shiraz buildings; this decision to apply to expenses incurred during 1928/29 and subsequently. The amount which H.M.G. are now requested to pay is therefore made up of (a) a moiety of expenditure incurred up to 1927/28, and (b) the whole expenditure incurred since 1928/29, It is an accepted principle that the Government by which a particular post is maintained should bear wholly all new capital outlay and that only maintenance charges should be divisible inmoieties. It is not suggested that the transfer, if carried through, should alter the present basis of contribution from Imperial and Indian revenues towards Bushire expenditure generally. 2&gt;o -W SG.

Department. 3939 5000 7/35 The doubts you indicate about the omission by India of the establishment items of Rs.5560 and Rs.1600 (P.1296/03) from the reckoning of the total cost of original construction are in my opinion quite justifiable. ! The amounts were included as part of the expenditure on buildings when that was shared through the claim made on the Foreign Office in the letter of 24th October 19G3. I The present practice is -also to adjust establishment charges as part of the cost of major works, so that the Foreign Office are not likely to object now to the inclusion of t such charges, and Rs.7160 should be added to the figure of Rs.43,305. 2. India give an item of Rs.6237 now, as they did in 1903, as an addition to the basic figure of Rs.37068. That item was not included in the amount claimed from the j Foreign Office in the letter of 24th October 1903 (possibly it was omitted from the calculation because it was then thought to represent expenditure before 30th September 1900 and to have been in consequence Indian in incidence). India should know of this omission from the letter Political Ro.75 dated 29th July 1904. This sum of Rs.6237 therefore, should apparently be deducted from Rs.43,305 and inserted as an item recoverable in full. 3. The question of establishment charges also arises in connection with the figures for additions and improvements. So far as they can be analysed here, the amounts given represent the bare cost of works without |establishment charges, the Indian practice being to compile such charges, when incurred on minor works, in the yearly accounts of D and G expenditure as an addition under/under ’’Bushire” instead of against the Consulate concerned. 4. There is no figure for additions and improvements in the period 1903-04 to 1919-20. There are of course on record in your Department yearly accounts of D. &amp; C. expenditure, from which it might he possible to ascertain whether any omission has been made. 5. In view of the foregoing it seems desirable to consult the Government of India again before approaching the Foreign Office. 6. I might add that the treatment of the sum of Rs.6237 referred to in paragraph 2 seems to have some bearing on the composition of the basic figure of 1900 expenditure, which enters into each annual adjustment with the Foreign Office, but this may be ignored for the present. / /f .£. * Q~U- fry eu &lt; c/L. -&lt;c A .

As a result of the re-organisation of the Consular establishments in South West Persia that took place in 1933 it was decided that the Consulate General at Isfahan should he abolished and the Isfahan Consular district incorporated in that of Shiraz (P.Z. 82i+6/33). I The Isfahan Consular property was to be sold if and when ! suitable opportunity occurred^and in the event of its disposal it was decided that it would be necessary to rent a small rest house to accommodate the Consul on his periodic visits from Shiraz, (P.Z. 4837/33). It was decided, however, that India had not sufficient ground to raise a claim to share in the proceeds of the sale of the Isfahan Consular buildings (P.Z. 1135/34). The buildings were sold towards the end of last year ; realising tUals 158,890. The office block of the property is being retained pending new arrangements. It has, however, now become necessary to consider the lease °f u rest house and the total maximumyexpenditure anticipated leasing the house now offered at Isfahan together with local salaries and other reasonable office and miscellaneous expenses is Rials 23,600 (about £380). This sum is somewhat in excess of the £280 representing the approximate annual cost of keeping up the old Consulate General (see Sir R. Hoare’s despatch No. 24 of the 24th January 1933). In accordance with the usual practice of sharing diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia, it is suggested that we should accept our share of this expenditure. Unless, therefore, it is thought necessary to make reference to the Government of India we might inform the Foreign Office that v/e are prepared to meet a moiety of the charge involved.Draft Paper.

Sir I have the honour to refer to my despatch No.449 of the 18th October, 1935, reporting the sale of the Consulate-General property at Isfahan. 2 . As you are aware, the position at Isfahan is that possession of the office block of the property has been retained until the end of March. The services of the clerk, Mr.Aratoon, of the Gholam Ramzan, and of the door-keeper, Abbas Beg, have also been retained but can be dispensed with at any moment. If the office block is not vacated at the end of March, a penalty rent 150 . of Rials one hundred and fifty per month becomes payable. Thus by paying this small sum continued occupation for a limited period may be secured. But it will not be possible to retain the premises indefinitely, and it is therefore now necessary to consider whether alternative accommodation should be found for the Consular office and for a rest-house to be used by His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz when visiting Isfahan. most desirable that his visits to Isfahan should be regular and of some duration. It will be seen from Mr. Mallet’s despatch IRk 47 4 of the 1st November, 1955, that Isfahan is one of the very few provincial towns in this o • In general I am of the opinion that it is country The Right Honourable Anthony ^den, M.C., M.P., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Office.country which is not being ruined by the economic policy of the Iranian Government. The town gives an impression of vigorous economic life, and its prosperity should be further increased by the construction of the new road to Ahwaz. There should be good opportunities of fostering the sale of British products in the area, to which the presence of His Majesty r s Consul should contribute. Prom the strictly political point of view, Isfahan is potentially almost as important as Shiraz, for it fringes on the Bakhtiari area and is not far from that of the Kashgais. The Governor-General and all the Government officials there are more openly friendly than almost anyv/here else in the country, and I have reason to believe that they would welcome occasional visits from His Majesty's Consul, especially if it was clear that the object of his presence v/as to further trade relations. Further, the British colony in Isfahan is of some size. The town is the headquarters of the Church Missionary Society's activities in this country and the residence of the Bishop in Persia, and with the staff of the Stuart Memorial College (now known as the Dabiristan Adab) the British colony is more numerous than that of Shiraz. The presence of His Majesty's Consul would, 1 think, be much appreciated. Finally I would venture to express the opinion that it v/ould be easy to carry too far the policy of closing dov/n Consular posts in this country. I recognise of course that the volume of work at Isfahan, Hamadan and Resht is certainly insufficient to justify the retention oi salaried Consular officers at these posts. There will probaoly not oe sufficient purely consular work at Isiahan to make frequent visits by His Majesty's Consul necessary. Beit tne '•■ork at other Consular posts is scarcely greater, and the true justification6. justification of the maintenance of the present Consular establishment in this country is the fact that it is yet too early to he sure that the existing strong centralised regime will survive the death of the present Shah. I consider that it is important that His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz should he in close touch with the local authorities at Isfahan, and that he should he in a position to furnish this Legation: with regular and full reports on economic and political conditions in the Isfahan area. 4 . I am therefore of the opinion that it should he definitely considered to he part of the duties of His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz to pay regular visits to Isfahan, and not merely to visit Isfahan when some particular business demands his presence there. While it is difficult to lay down any fixed rule, I would suggest that these visits should amount in the aggregate to not much less than two months in each year. But if this is to be arranged, it will he necessary to provide a rest-house and a sxeleton office for the use of His Majesty’s Consul. 5. It will he remembered that the leasing of a rest-house was authorised in paragraph 3 of Sir John Simon s despatch No.48 (K 1096/5/234) of the 24th January, 1934. A house was in fact leased in August of that year, hut when the negotiations then in progress for the sale of the Consulate property failed, the lease was disposed of (see Sir R. Hoare’s despatch No.508 of the 17th November, 1934). The house in Question is now let, hut only on a short lease and to a tenant who is notoriously had at paying his rent, and the Manager of the Imperial Bank of Iran s Isiahan branch considers that there should he no difficulty in ootaining possession of the house.I Rials 20. £ 1 . £60 . £120. 6. I would therefore suggest that His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz should he authorised to take a lease of this house or of any other suitable house which may he available at a similar rent, to serve as a rest-house and office for his use when visiting Isfahan. I would, however, add that I consider that if this proposal is sanctioned, the consequent expenditure should not he limited to the sum estimated in paragraph 4 of Sir R. Hoare’s despatch No.24 of the 24th January, 1933. If Mr. Hovhanessian’s house is leased, it will he necessary, for the reasons stated in paragraph 8 of Mr. Hoyland's despatch No.27 of the 3rd September, 1934 (a copy of which was enclosed in Sir R. Hoare’s despatch No.427 of the 19th September, 1934) to engage a second gholam and a gardener. Further, I consider it desirable that the Shiraz Consulate Munshi should accompany His Majesty’s Consul, and this would involve the payment of his travelling expenses and of a subsistence allowance of Rials twenty per diem while in Isfahan. Finally, it is clearly essential that His Majesty’s Consul himself should be properly housed and in a position to do some entertaining at Isfahan without being appreciably out of pocket. The greater part of his expenditure at Shiraz will continue during his absence, and I consider therefore that no reduction in his Shiraz representation allowance should be made during his visits to Isfahan; and further, that he should draw one pound a day subsistence allowance during these visits, and should also be entitled to charge the travelling expenses and subsistence allowance of two servants from Shiraz. 1 would therefore suggest that subsistence allowance and travelling exoenses should be authorised up to a limit of sixty pounds each a year, making a total of one hundred and twenty pounds, instead£80. £380. instead of eighty pounds as previously estimated and that expenditure on rent and local salaries at Isfahan should be authorised as follows:- (a) Clerk. Rials 10,200. (b) Rent. about 6,500. (c) 2 Gholams. 3,600. (d) 1 Gardener. 1,800. (e) Suits. 900. (f) No-Ruz gratuities. 600. Total: Rials:23,600 making a total of about three hundred and eighty pounds. In addition there would be, as explained in Sir R. Hoare’s despatch No.103 of the 27th February, 1934, certain office and miscellaneous expenses. 7. When His Majesty’s Consul is not in residence I at the rest-house, it would be presumably available for the use of official and other travellers with the permission of \ His Majesty’s Legation or of His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz. Such travellers could be charged for the accommodation provided, and should be sufficiently numerous to ensure a small profit. The house might also be used by Probationer ,n null Vice-Consuls during their period of language study when they would otherwise be in receipt of rent allowances, and might perhaps also be let to language officers from the Indian Army. 8. The amount of receipts or of savings to public funds which might thus result is difficult to estimate and is in any case unlikely to reduce appreciably tne total expenditure. I realise that the estimate of expenditure made in paragraph 6 above exceeds by rather more than one hundred pounds the estimate made in 1932* I am, however, confident that it cannot be reduced if the desired object is to be attained, and I have every hope that it will be fully justified by results. The system suggested must in any case be something of an experiment, and I would suggestsuggest that it should be subject to review at the end of the first year. 9.

In view of the continued importance of the town of Isfahan, the Secretary of State is of opinion that His Majesty’s Minister is justified in his request that such visits should be made regularly and I am therefore to express the hope that Their Lordships may be moved to sanction the proposal that an expenditure of 23,600 rials per annum may be incurred in respect of rent, local salaries, uniforms and gratuities at Isfahan, together with other reasonable office and miscellaneous expenses* 3. His Majesty’s Consul will continue to draw his normal representation allowance during his absence from Shiraz on these visits, but as he has drawn attention to the fact that he has been out of pocket as a result of his previous visits to Isfahan, it is hoped that sympathetic consideration may be given The Secretary e \ to the Treasury\ * given to the request that he should be permitted to draw subsistence allowance at the rate of £1 a day for himself and should be entitled to charge the travelling expenses and subsistence of his munshi and two servants. 4.

To arrange some temporary accommodation for the Resident is the more necessary now that the G.of 1. have expressed their willingness on certain conditions to transfer the Residency building to H.M.G. For reasons of urgency it is proposed to deal with the question of recess separately from that of transfer. As regards the incidence of cost involved in renting these summer quarters for the Resident, the instance cited by the G.of I. (P.4936/29) refers to an occasion when it was anticipated that quarters would have to be hired for the Consul on account of the Resident coming to summer at the Residency building at Shiraz. The G.of 1., vide their - telegram of 1st September, 1929, agreed to bear a moiety of any rent involved, but since the Resident finally decided not to come to Shiraz that year the problem of sharing costs did not arise (see P.5725/29). In the present case the situation is reversed and it is the Resident who will require temporary accommodation and flird H.M.G. who asked to bear a moiety. For some years now the G.of I. have allowed the Consul to occupy the Residency for at least 10 months in the year free of rent, though expenses of maintenance have been shared between H.M.G. and the G.of I. Moreover, the Residency which was built precisely for housing the Resident during the summer months is still the property of the G.of 1.

Id) To meet the essential requirements indicated in (a) above, in the present circumstances by far the most economical and practical solution is to rent suitaole recess quarters. (e) Fortunately the best quarters, the Bagh-i-Shaikh, are now available for hire. They - the quarters • are not ideal# the Resident and his staff will not be nearly as comfortable as Residents and their staffs are in Indian summer quarters, but they are the best procurable. The rent for the Bagh is by no means high, and most fortunately the landlord does not insist on a long lease (paragraph 4 of Major Ryan*s report). In the event therefore of the move mentioned in the last sentence of (c) above the quarters would not be left on the Government of India’s hands, and 1 propose hiring the Bagh in the first instance for one year with effect from the 1st January 1936. (f) 'The quarters must of course be furnished and this can economically he done under the proposal contained in paragraph 7 of Major Ryan’s report. 3. I trust that Government will accord sanction to the proposal. AS Major Ryan points out in paragraph 9 of his report the matter is urgent. Major Ryan was delayed in hhiraz by sic inass and i have waited before addressing Government uhtil he returned and I was able to discuss the matter fully with him. I now hear f*om Consul, Shiraz, that the owner of the Bagh is becoming restive and pressing for a definite decision. I would be grateful therefore for a telegraphic reply. Sd. T.C.Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.7 1 inspected the old Telegraph garden, x&gt;»gh-i-Sheikh at- Shiraz on 3rd-5th December 1935* 2. The Bagh, which is conveniently situated near the British Consulate, contains five houses. One of these is occupied by a Persian telegraph official and one half of another house is similarly occupied by another Persian telegraph official. There remain 3|r houses which are offered to us at a rental of Rs.100/- per mensem. I append a rough drawing of the accommodation of these houses. 3. This is the only -bagh and these are the only houses which came to my notice as at all suitable for the purpose for which we require them* From an aesthetic point of view the Bagh is only second-rate, but having regard to our requirements, it is the best available, suitable, and the price is not exorbitant. 4. The rental of Ts.lCO/-* per mensem would be for one year with the option of renewal. The land lord, while willing to agree to a 3-years-or-longer lease, refuses to contemplate any reduction in the rental for the longer period. 5. . The rental would include the 3£ houses and a small plot of garden around each house. The Bagh as a whole would continue to be maintained by the landlord. The question of repairs is governed by local custom, which is broadly that the landlord, and minor repairs by major repairs are done by/the tenant. For instance, the clearing off snow of tne roofs and the rolling of the roofs after rain is the tenant f s responsibility; a repairs grant is therefore essential which should be not less than Ts.36o/- per annum. 6. A chaukidar would also have be employed to look after the houses in our absence, which including short periods when one or more houses might be vacant would mean in effect axl the year round. Bis pay at Ts«15/- per mensem would amount to Ts.iSO/- per annum.As regards furniture, it is fortunate that the bulk of our requirements can be obtained locally by purchase second hand from various British officials who either have recently left, or who are leaving shortly, A lump sum of Ts.1600/- plus an annual maintenance grant of Ts.40/- would, in my opinion, be the minimum, sum required for this purpose, 8, The rental asked includes what I am informed are adequate water rights, i.e, the use of water for the garden once a week. Water for household purposes is available from a well which should be adequate in any year but one ol exceptional drought. In such an event, we could no doubt have recourse to the Consulate wells near by* 9, The essence of the situation now is one of time. The landlord could probably find Persian tenants without difficulty^ Three of the houses are now lying untenanted and the landlord has with difficulty been persuaded by h,11. Consul to keep his offer open till the end of the year, naif of the remaining house will fall vacant in a couple of months when Lieut,Magan (the language officer) leaves. 10, To sura up, the total cost of the scheme for the first year is as follows:- 11* Bent 2s. 1200 Rs. 1846 - 3- Repairs grant 360 554 - 0 - Pay of caretaker iao 277 - 0 - Cost of furniture 1600 2461 - 4 - Purniture maintenance grant 40 61 - 9 - 1 'otal ffs* 3380 Hs. 5200/- Sor succeeding years this sum would be reduced by Is. 1600 , being the initial outlay on furniture.

Sir, With reference to my telegrams Nos 6, 7 and 9, I have the honour to submit a report upon the sale of the property of the ex-British Consulate General at Isfahan. Rials 160000 2) - The purchaser is Agha Hassan Sultani, a local tobacco merchant. The price paid by him was Rials One hundred and sixty thousand and the transfer was effected by me at the Isfahan Registration Department on September 26th. Your power of attorney was retained by the Registration Department, with the deed of the registration of the pro perty. The original ”qabaleh M was handed to Agha Sultani. 3) - The proceeds of the sale, less the sum of Rials Rials 1600 One thousand six hundred for brokerage, at one per centum, Rials 300 and a sum of Rials three hundred, being half of the fees payable to the registration department, were remitted to you by telegraphic transfer through the Imperial Bank of Rials 10 Iran on the same day, less Rials ten cost of the telegram, Rials 158090 leaving a net amount of Rials One hundred and fifty eight thousand and ninety payable to you (vide Bank statement transmitted herewith). Rials 900 4)- In addition to the purchase price, a further pay ment of Rials Nine hundred was obtained from Agha Sultani for the electric light fittings in the buildings and for the garden pump and hose. The hose was found to be of no value as the rubber had perished. I have the honour to transmit H.M.

It was eventually agreed with Agha Sultani that no brokerage was payable by me as I had not been approached on his behalf by any broker and in view of the fact that the preliminary negotiations for the sale had been carried out directly with him by Mirza Abul Path Napoleoni, the munshi of this Consulate. The offer by Kgha Sultani to purchase the property was in fact received through Mirza Abul Path Napoleoni and the negotiations for the sale were entrusted to him when I sent him to Isfahan for the purpose. In the circumstances I have the honour to apply that I may be authorised to pay over the above sum of Rials one thousand six hundred to Mirza Abul Path Napo leoni. 6 ) - The transfer fees payable to the Registration Department at the rate of Rials 3.13 per thousand, plus stamps, amounted to Rials 600.80 of which Rials Three hundred were refunded by me to Agha Sultani, under previous arrangement for the equal sharing of the transfer expenses. His receipt for this payment is transmitted herewith. 7)- I secured from Agha Sultani rent free possession . ( for six months of the block of office buildings to the right of the main entrance. A lease has been signed by us by which the buildings are rented to me for six months for a nominal rent of Rials 200, acknowledged to have been received by him.

The capital value of the Shiraz Consulate, as reported in paragraph 3 of my Express Letter No.1872, dated the 12th September 1935 was based on the annual Capital and Revenue Accounts of Non-Public works Buildings. There appears, however, to have been some mistake in assessing the capital value when these accounts were first compiled for the year 1923-24. The correct figures of capital expenditure, as obtained from the records of the Shiraz buildings, are shown in the accompanying statement. The total capital cost as detailed in the statement works out to Rs.58,000/-. 1 etT: INDIA l 3. It will be observed that the actual expenditure incurred from 30-9-1900 to May 1903 * was Rs. 43,305/-. It is not clear how the amount of Rs. 50,465/- mentioned in paragraph 2(a) of the Express Letter under reply has been arrived at.4 &lt;3£cT) In addition to the actual expenditure incurred on the itiems mentioned in paragraph 2 (b) of your letter, the capital expenditure incurred during the period from 1919-20 to 1927- 28 has been included in the statement, 5. With regard to paragraph 4 of your letter, the Italian architect measured the property and made a plan. The value of the garden was assessed at the rate per square unit for land adjacent to the Kiaban (or main boulevard of Shiraz), the value of the trees and water rights was added, the Consulate, Guest Homse, office block and other buildings were assessed at so much per square unit according to their materials and condition. This assessment, therefore, represents the intrinsic value of the property, but, as pointed out in paragraph 4 of my Express Letter lio.1872 of 12-9-35, there is no demand for house property in Shiraz and so Sale values are 30^ below intrinsic values.S d %zv STaTS^ENT showing capital expenditure on SHIRAZ CONSULATE BUILDINGS. * * * Year amount. riS • Remarks. 1. 1900-03 43,305 Vide Letter No.A/l/1541 dated 25-6-1903 frcm the Examiner.

As instructed in your despatch :jo. 446 (K;«551/329/£54) of the 4th September I enquired what price the Iranian Oovernaent would be prepared to give for the K&amp;madan consulate property and have now received a reply that they will offer Rials 200,000 about Rials two hundred thousand (two thousand three hundred £2,325. and twenty five pounds). 2. The enclosed copy of a report by Hr. Gault made after a visit to Hamaaan on October 23rd bears on this question. 3. I have reason to think that the Iranian Government Rials 300,000 would probably offer up to Rials three hundred thousand £3,488 (three thousand four hundred and eighty eight pounds) if pressed. His lia^esty’s Consul at Ahwaz when at Han ad an on recess derived this impression locally. Kven so, it seems a poor price for a property which cost His sty's Government £13,000 in the United Kingdom no less than thirteen thousand pounds. 4. I intend to make further enquiries regarding the proper price of the Consulate in present conditions and shall shortly have the honour to address a further despatch to you.

British Consulate, Shiraz. ^ September 2nd, 1935. Dear Chancery, When Bazalgette came up from Bushire last month for his n recess” he asked me for an estimate of the present day value of the Shiraz Consulate buildings and grounds. He told me in confidence that the valuation was required by the Government of India, in the consideration of a suggestion for the transfer of the property to the home Government as a solution of our difficulties. I enclose a copy of a letter I have addressed to Bazalgette (No. 447/10/2/16 of August 31st, 1935) giving him the valuation. You will see that the estimated cost of the purchase of the land to-day and for putting up the present accommodation is Rials 476750. The market value of the property, on this figure and on the basis of calculation in force, works out at Rials 322,000. My own remarks upon this price are contained in the last paragraph of the enclosure. If the transaction becomes possible I suggest that the visit here of the Representative of the Office of Works would be worth the expense. The reconditioning and modernising of the buildings is a matter which cannot be put off for long and it would be as well for the Office of Works to know the estimated cost. I fear however that it will be difficult to persuade the Office of Works to put down between £3500 and £4000 for another property in Iran, when they cannot get half this sum for that in Isfahan. The Chancery, British Legation, Tehran. Yours, etc., (Signed) H.A.D. HOYLaND.Copy ^47/10/2/16) British Consulate, Shiraz, August 31st, 1935. Dear Bazalgette, Bushire telegram No.749 of to-day and my reply by telegram No.440. Argenti, the local Italian builder, has produced his plan of the Shiraz Consulate property this morning, with his valuation as follows:- Ground: (7 peyman and 227 zars of land at rials 20 per zar) Rials 280000 House: (512 sq.metres at Rials 200) 102400 Offices: (178 sq. metres at Rials 100) 17800 Two guest rooms block 10000 Kitchen block 3500 Store and servants rooms near kitchen block 8400 Gate buildings : Stables, gatekeepers, &amp;C., rooms 9400 old stables (including garage) 6000 Washhouse, closet, #c. '2750 Property main walls 12500 Garden trees 4000 value of water rights (one fard) 20000 Total value for acquisition and building of property, at present. Rials 476750 Market value of property, on basis of current calculation for sales, based on current practice of deduction of 304 to 30j per cent Rials 321807 2). The price therefore to be demanded, if the property were to be thrown in the market in the ordinary way would be Rials 322000. I doubt very much however that anything approaching this price would be realised. There is no sale for land and buildings at present and Banks will not take them on mortgage. The large garden alongside our N.E. wall is mortgaged to’one of the Banks for Rials 82,000 and this value is .A. Bazalgette, Esquire, etc., etc. , etc. , British Consulate-General, Bushire.is considered much too high. The Government property at Isfahan, of about the same size as this place, with larger buildings, does not command Rials 180000 in the market today. Though the position with the Shiraz property is quite a different one, 1 have thought it as well to mention the above for your information. Yours sincerely, (Signed) H.A.D.

Your telegram no. 812-A of 3rd August 1935 Shiraz Consulate. 2. I regret delay in replying but wished to await return of the secretary (Captain Razalgette) whom I had sent to make enquiries at Shiraz. 3. The present capital value of the Shiraz Consulate is Bupees 52,9 56 -0 -0. 4. The present value is estimated by an Italian architect and builder of Shiraz to be Rials 476,750-0-0 er Rupees 69,700-0-0 (at the September official rate of exchange). This figure supposes a buyer to be in the market, but as for practical purposes no one is now in a position to buy such property, a sale value may be reckoned to be 30^ le ss. 5. captain Razalgette made enquiries about the possibility of buying a suitable house in place of the present one» but without success. There is, however, a suitable •’garden', the jalal-i-ia shkar on the north-east side of the Consulate which is mortgaged to the imperial Bank of Iran for Rials 82,000-0-0 (Rs. H»988-5-0 at September rate of exchange). The purchase of this garden was considered by sir Percy Cox in 1906, but he did not pursue the matter as the owner wanted a fancy price* The Bank expect to foreclose in February 19 36 and will probably sell the property. The garden is 6 peiman s. •.-2 pel man s (about 12150 square metres) in extent» (the Consulate garden ie 7 peimans, ) has a good water supply, and is well cult!rated and contains a number of good fruit trees. The existing house, however, is delapi dated, and would almost certainly require total rebuilding. The Assistant Engineer, Persian Gulf sub Division, who has enquired at Shiraz about rates, considers that a suitable house with similar accommodation to the existing Consulate (not including escort lines and stables), would cost approximately Rupees 4 0,000/- as the price of building materials i s high. 6. There is general agreement that some means of getting away at any rate for a tine from the Persian Gulf hot weather is essential. I would only add that, apart from the political Resident himself, I regard it as most important that trie secretary a other officers of the Residency should be able to get away for short periods in the hot weather. The difference that even ten days in the cool away from the decaying effect of the Gulf climate makes on health and efficiency is amazing.» cm) 2 / pjr \. ^ -a^ CONSULAR HOUSE AT SHIRAZ. I had a word with Colonel Fowle about this matter. He is rather in favour of marking time for the present. He has a good working arrangement with the Consul in regard to recess arrangements and he would be averse from stirring up any question in regard to Shiraz which might react on these arrangements. He has no A particular viev/s as to who should own the Consular House at Shiraz and he would see no particular objection to H.M.G. taking it over, as suggested in Mr. Scott’s letter of 13th June. 2. On the whole it seems doubtful whether it is worth doing any more about this unless and until the Foreign Office raise the question again. If they do we can send a reminder to the Government of India on the matter and we can, I think, be assured that so far as the Resident is concerned he would have no objection to any financial readjustment in regard to the Consular A House provided there is no interference with his amicable -with Mr. Hoyland in regard to recess arrangements.In rtply to your letter ( 2^4) of the 13th August 1935, on tho subject ox the Consular property at Hauiadan, I am directed by the first CoanalpBionor of Hie Majiux cy* s Worlte, etc., to state, for the information of Secretary Sir Samuel Hoar© that the Board are of opinion that, unleet there is a real proepeot that the poet will 5© reopened in the fairly near future, etepe should be t&amp;Jfcen to dispose of the property.

No.277 Sir, I have the honour to inform you that the Acting Rials 3.900 ( £48 ) Rials 2 t 520 i£31) Rials 560 (£Z) £86 Minister for Foreign Affairs recently enquired of me whether His Majesty’s Government were prepared to sell the Consulate property at Hamadan. I understand that the Iranian Government desire to purchase it as a residence for the Governor. 2. Provided that the Dranian Government are prepared to pay a reasonable price for the property, I do not see that we have any alternative but to dispose of it. It is at the moment unused for more than half the year except for four months in the summer when His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz and His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Mohammerah go there on recess, and for the quarterly visits paid by His Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah. Furthermore, apart from the cost of repairs, a certain annual outlay is entailed on the wages of a property agent who is paid Rials three thousand nine hundred (forty eight pounds) per annum, a care-taker-gardener who gets Rials two thousand five hundred and twenty (thirty one pounds), and under gardener who is employed during the summer only at a cost of Rials five hundred and sixty (seven pounds); total approximately eighty six pounds yearly. 3 . The Right Honourable Sir Samuel Hoare, Bart., G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Office.-JIM3. On the other hand, for reasons which I shall develop below, I am strongly averse to sacrificing the £12^)00 property at any price. It cost thirteen thousand pounds and in 1932, when there was question of leasing it and one or two offers were made to purchase, the best of the latter Rials 210,000 was for Rials two hundred and ten thousand (two thousand, £2,625 six hundred and twenty five pounds). This offer was refused and, while I do not know how much the Iranian Government are prepared to pay today, it seems to me unlikely that they would offer a sum which His Majesty’s Government would consider reasonable in view of their initial outlay on the property. 4. Moreover, apart from financial considerations there are, in my opinion, many reasons why it would be a pity to dispose of the property. It is true, as I have said, that it is at the moment little used; but I have for some while been considering whether it might not be possible to take greater advantage of it than has been done during the past few years and, having now had the opportunity of obtaining the views of His Majesty’s Consul at Kermanshah who, as you ere aware, is at present filling the post of Oriental Secretary at His Majesty’s Legation, and of Mr. • Keif, the Representative of the Office of Works who inspected the property on his way up here in April, I have reached the conclusion that, with the expenditure of relatively little more money, it would be possible to open the house permanently as a rest-house for members of the Legation and other Government servants. 5. The number of potential visitors is considerable. The courier regularly spends a night at Hamadan, both on his upward and on his downward journey, andand during the spring, summer and autumn there is a steady stream of travellers passing through, including members of the staff of His Majesty’s legation, His Majesty’s Consuls, official visitors from Baghdad and other guests coming to stay in the Legation. A calculation has been made which shows that during the past three months approximately forty persons have spent the night at His Majesty’s Consulate at Kermanshah, and this does not include any of the couriers who pass straight through. Many of these persons would also have spent a night at a Consulate rest-house at Hamadan. Kermanshah is approximately three hundred and seventy miles from here and, while some people cover the distance in one day, many prefer to break the journey at Hamadan, and more would do so were they not faced with the rather cheerless prospect of a night at the Hotel Alvand (formerly ”de Prance”.) 6 * There is already a certain amount of furniture in the house and it would be possible to supply most of the further needs of the place by bringing furniture and other household effects from His Majesty’s Consulate-General at Isfahan. We are hoping to dispose of the latter property at an early date and it would be an inexpensive matter to remove such things as would be required and send them to Homadan. Very little, if any, furniture would need to be purchased, though it would be necessary to equip the house with mattresses, blankets and linen, crockery, cutlery and kitchen utensils, etcetera. 7. Another essential would be to engage a whole time indoor servant. The present gardener-caretaker does his work satisfactorily, but he has neither the time nor the training to undertake housework. It would, of course, be necessary to engage a most reliable man, since he would not bebe under regular supervision, and his wages would come to not less than thirty pounds per annum. As against this a regular charge could be made of all persons spending the night at the Consulate (other than of His Majesty's Consular officers from Kermanshah, Ahwaz and Mohammerah), and it might thus be possible to recover most, if not all, of the additional expenditure. One proviso must, however, be added. The utility of a rest-house at Hamadan depends very largely on whether or not it is well run. I have no doubt that the number of potential visitors is sufficient to justify the experiment; but unless it is equipped to a reasonable standard of comfort, many travellers will nevertheless prefer to go to the hotel. In Isfahan, Government servants regularly stay at the Consulate-General because it is more comfortable than the hotel; the same can easily be made to apply at Hamadan, but it will be necessary to spend sufficient money at the outset and to engage a sufficiently good servant to make it attractive. 8. There is one further consideration. So far as can be foreseen, no circumstances are likely to arise in the measurably near future which will make it desirable to re-open a Consular post at Hamadan, but the house is such a good one and experience (for example, at Ahwaz) has shown how difficult it is to acquire suitable property in this country, that it would seem a mistake to dispose of even a property that was little used unless a really good price could be obtained therefor. 9. I would accordingly suggest that I be informed in due course of the minimum sum in sterling which His Majesty's Office of ’Works would be prepared to accept for the property; and that if the sum offered by the Iranian GovernmentGovernment proves to fall short of this minimum, I he authorised to submit figures showing the approximate cost of equipment and upkeep of the Consulate as a rest-house, together with an estimate of the returns that might he expected to accrue from payments hy travellers. I fully realise that no final decision can he taken as to the use of the property as a rest-house until such figures have heen prepared and considered; hut I have thought it well to refrain from entering into a mass of detail pending further developments in regard to a possible sale and pending a decision as to whether a proposal to create a rest-house at Hamadan would he sympathetically entertained in the event of no sale materialising. 10.

You are, of course, in a better position to say how the possible removal of the Residency would affect the position but I should imagine that the house would then become quite useless to the Government of India. as a permanent post and as it is one where no considerable Indian interests exist, we are inclined to the view that the best solution would be for us to take over the house (if Treasury and Office of Works will approve).

(K 5445/389/234) No.847/0-1/1 I ’ (BRITISH LEGATION, TEHRAN. 18th April, 1955. My dear David, Thanks for your letter of February 27th about Shiraz (K 1476/329/234). It is fortunate that the recess question is satisfactorily fixed up for next year, but I agree that we mustn’t leave it at that but must think of the future. 2. The difficulties are very great, but I do think it should be generally recognised that it is not fair to expect the regular Consular incumbent to turn out of his quarters annually for the Bushire staff. It is utterly anomalous, to ray mind, that the Levant Consul should be housed in a building belonging to the Government of India and I feel strongly that, if a permanent arrangement is to be made, it should be on the basis of the Consulate being taken over by His Majesty’s Government from the Government of India and the Government of India left to make their own recess arrangements for the Residency. They could rent a house in one of the gardens at Shiraz as was done with success some years ago. This seems a much more reasonable arrangement then exnecting the Consul to turn out every year, bag and baggage, from his permanent abode - which to my mind is so impracticable and unfair as to be literally absurd. But I suppose in practice there would be difficulty in reaching this solution of the question. D.J.M.D. Scott, Esquire, The Foreign Office. 3 .3. Failing that (which I strongly advocate) a self-contained guest house seems the next best plan and we should concentrate on making the present guest * house completely independent, or finding another one further off. I imagine that much of Hoyland’s trouble arises from the proximity of the guest house which must make privacy impossible (for all parties) besides entailing friction among the respective servants (which would be unbearable in hot weather). On the other hand, we here live in a compound at fairly close quarters and brawls and murders among the staff are, to say the least of it, exceptional: but then it is cooler here. 4. But I put these two solutions to you,viz: (a) His Majesty’s Government to take over the Consulate and leave the Government of India to make their own arrangements: (b) Make the guest-house really habitable, or find another one further off. 5. But in considering these solutions there are two other considerations, namely: (1) Do we know how long the Residency will continue at Bushire? The Eastern Department can tell you how this question is likely to be affected by political developments better than I can, but two years may bring changes within sight and it is no use building rest- houses for perspiring Residents who are miles away across the Gulf. Of course, there would be a Consul at Bushire in his place, but he might be easier to deal with. ( 2 ) Any arrangements whereby the Consul vacates his house when the recess takes place is based upon his being able to withdraw to Isfahan. But we here are coming roundround to the view that Isfahan should be closed altogether, and in that case he will have nowhere to go to. Moreover, even if he has, I think it hardly fair that he should be expected to bear all the move expenses entailed by an arrangement which causes him n©thing but inconvenience and to which he strongly objects. 6. I am afraid this is not a very helpful letter, but the whole position is so anomalous that I see nothing for it but some radical and fundamental re-arrangement and before that is made I think we should be certain about the permanence of the Residency at Bushire.

Sir, I have the honour to invite reference to my despatch No. 427 of September 19th last and to previous correspondence in regard to the proposed sale of His Majesty’s Consulate- General at Isfahan, and to report that the prospective purchaser, Haji Mirza Mohammed Taqi Khan, ’Ishraqi, has at the last moment refused to complete the transaction. 2. ’Ishraqi, who was originally acting on behalf of someone else, agreed to purchase the property on August 15th last and on that date handed to His Majesty’s Consul at Rials 30,000 Shiraz a cheque for Rials thirty thousand, as an instalment of the purchase money, the cheque being endorsed by him ’’payment on account of the full purchase money”. The transaction could not, however, be formally concluded at that time in the absence of the original deed of registration and Mr. Consul Hoyland therefore returned to Shiraz after having arranged to pay a further visit to Isfahan at the beginning of October for the purpose of completing the necessary formalities and transferring the property. Prior to his departure, however, he received a letter from ’Ishraqi, in which the latter, after stating that the principal on whose behalf he was acting had refused to complete the purchase and after recapitulating the details of a conversation which he had had with Mr. Hoyland, concluded by saying : ”our ’’conversation The Right Honourable Sir John Simon G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Office.C5) Tomans 18,500 195 Tomal^ 5,000 Tomans 18,000 1% Tomans 3,000 conversation ended here, i.e., that if during the course of ^another month I managed to find another buyer who would pay ’’Tomans eighteen thousand five hundred, I would sell it to ’’him after deducting one per cent and my Tomans three thousand ’’and that if in the meanwhile I fail to procure another buyer, ”1 will take the buildings at only Tomans eighteen thousand ’’that you agreed at the beginning you had a substantial buyer ’’for and after a deduction of one per cent and the Tomans three ’’thousand, the remaining amount to be paid when the Kabaleh is ’’written and the buildings transferred to the buyer”. 3. 'ffhen, however, Mr. Hoyland arrived once more in Isfahan at the beginning of October, ’Ishraqi sent messages that he was unwell but would call upon him when he had recovered It had been agreed that all formalities should be concluded by October 15th and Mr. Hoyland, who had informed ’Ishraqi in writing on October 8th that he was ready to complete the necessary details at any time, addressed two further letters to him on October 13th and 15th respectively calling upon him to complete the purchase. Since the latter in his replies continued to evade the point at issue, Mr. Hoyland finally transmitted to him through the Adliyeh a formal protest against his failure to complete the purchase by October 15th with a demand that he should do so forthwith. 4. To this ’Ishraqi replied by denying his liability and by claiming that the formalities had not been carried through, as arranged, by October 15th. He later called upon Mr. Hoyland and demanded the return of his deposit. Mr. Hoyland naturally replied that he could not return this sum without having first referred the whole matter to me and pointed out that, as he had now rented another house on the strength of his agreementagreement with 'Ishraqi and as various travelling and other expenses had been incurred in connection with the sale, it would have to be carefully considered whether a claim for compensation might not lie. 5. In the few days that have since elapsed Mr. Hoyland has not succeeded in finding another prospective purchaser, while enquiries made in Tehran have not yet produced any result* The present situation was therefore that f Ishraqi had refused to complete the purchase and that Mr. Hoyland still Rials 30,000 retained the instalment of Rials thirty thousand paid over to him in August. The latter also stood committed to his promise made in writing on August 24th last to lease Mr. Hovanessian f s house (formerly occupied by Messrs. Ziegler^ manager), for one year at a monthly rent of Rials four hundred Rials 450 and fifty, payable quarterly in advance, plus a certain sum for the upkeep of the garden, his whole annual liability being. Rials 6,500 however, well within the sum of Rials six thousand five hundred sanctioned in your despatch No. 48 (K 1096/5/234) of January 24th last. 6. I therefore consulted the Tehran lawyer Doctor Naficy regarding the validity of f Ishraqi f s agreement to purchase the Consulate-General. His opinion is as follows:- (a) 1 1shraqi* s letter (quoted in the second paragraph of this despatch) is a binding undertaking on his part to purchase the property for Rials 180,000, unless within the next month and a half he found another buyer for Rials 185,000. A suit could be brought against him to compel him to cbmplete the transaction with every hope of eventual success; (b) The payment of Rials 30,000 must be regarded as a payment made in advance and as part of the full purchase price, and therefore ’Ishraqi's undertaking to buy and Mr. Hoyland 1 s undertaking to sell are both quite definite; (c) If we do not bring a lawsuit to compel ^Ishraqi to conclude the transaction, the Rials 30,000 must be returned to him and not until then would Mr. Hoyland be considered free to dispose of the property to anyone else; (d)(d) If Mr. Hoyland continues to hold the sum in question and proceeds to try and dispose of the property to anyone else, f Ishraqi could bring an action for the recovery of the money plus his costs and even put an estoppel on the sale until the money was paid over to him; (e) If the Rials 30,000 are returned to f Ishraqi, Mr. Hoyland must obtain from him a document formally renouncing his claims; and (f) It would only have been possible for Mr. Hoyland to have retained the money and concluded a deal with another purchaser, if ’Ishraqi had stated in v/riting that he agreed to forfeit his deposit if he failed to conclude the transaction by a certain definite date. 7. Mr. Hoyland has now telegraphed that he has managed to arrange for the disposal of the balance of the one year’s lease of Mr. Hovanessian’s house by the payment of three months’ rent, which was payable in advance as from October 1st, and the wages of the gardener-caretaker, i.e. a total cost of Rials 1,650 Rials one thousand six hundred and fifty. This I have authorisied him to do, though I regret losing the opportunity of securing such a suitable property for the future rest-house. It was impossible, obviously, to avoid the payment for one quarter’s rent, etc., and Mr. Hovanessian could I think quite fairly have insisted on our continuing the tenancy for a full year. 8. As regards the Consulate-General I have carefully weighed the question whether it is desirable to go to law in order to force ’Ishraqi to complete the purchase and have reached the conclusion that we stand to gain nothing much by doing so even if successful* The lawsuit with subsequent appeals might well drag on for two or three years and even then there is the risk of it going against us and involving His Majesty’s Government in considerable costs. If a judgement were finally obtained against Ishraqi we might have great difficultydifficulty even then in extracting the money from him or his heirs (for he is old and infirm). Above all I consider it on general grounds undesirable that His Majesty’s Government or their officials should be involved in a suit in the Persian courts. Moreover during the whole period of the lawsuit we should be estopped from attempting to find an alternative purchaser of the property and the eventual Rials 1650 financial loss might well considerably exceed the one thousand six hundred and fifty Rials which ’Ishraqi’s misbehaviour has cost us. 9. Mr. Hoyland reported that there had been further enquiries from other sources about the possibility of purchasing the property but that no purchaser was likely to materialise as long as ’Ishrgqi’s deposit remained in our hands, as prospective buyers feared a last minute intervention by ’Ishraqi. 10. In all the circumstances it seemed therefore desirable to abandon the ides of attempting to compel ’Ishraqi to conclude the purchase and in order to make clear to other possible purchasers that there is no obstacle in their way I have authorised Mr. Hoyland to return to ’Ishraqi the Rials 30,000 thirty thousand rials advanced by him against a formal written renunciation of all claims by him. I have asked Mr. Hoyland, if he sees no objection, to attempt to induce ’Ishraqi to defray the expenses involved in the hiring of Rials 1,650 Mr. Hovanessian’s house, namely Rials one thousand six hundred and fifty, but I have but slender hopes of his succeeding in doing so. I regret therefore to inform you that this sum will in all probability have to be considered lost and I trust that you will approve my action and agree to Mr. Hoyland charging this sum in his accounts with the Foreign Office. I consider that no blame can attach to Mr. Hoyland for what has happened. Doctor Naficy’s opinion shows that Mr. Hoyland was quitequite justified in considering that the sale to f Ishraqi was effective. 11« ¥hile this draft was being drafted I received enquiries from another prospective buyer who at first seemed Rial^ 180.000 willing to purchase the property for Rials one hundred and Rials eighty thousand. He subsequently, however, reduced his offer 150.000 to Rials one hundred and fifty thousand on the ground that it was generally understood in Isfahan that the Municipality had decided to acquire some three thousand square metres out of the property for the purpose of constructing a new avenue along the water-course on the West side of the premises. No buyer of the property would ever get compensation from the Municipality for the loss of this land. It was explained to him that no reduction in the price of the property could possibly be entertained and it was further pointed out that the construction of a new avenue next to it would have the effect of enhancing its value. He remained, however, unmoved by these arguments and would not go further than to state that he would get in touch with the Legation again, should he change his mind. 12. I would observe that this rumour that the Municipality propose to acquire part of the garden was also maintained by ’Ishraqi as one of his reasons for withdrawing from his offer to purchase, and I fear that, so long as this threat exists, buyers will be very reluctant to commit themselves to taking the property at the original price. I am .assured that the property is in fact worth that sum and I therefore see no reason to reduce the price, but I can no longer feel optimistic about the prospects of an early sale. 13.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to my despatch No.5 dated Isfahan, May 28th, 1934, in paragraph 5 of which I stated that I was obtaining information with regard to the pay ment of brokerage upon the transfer of property in Isfahan. 2. I am reliably informed that the brokerage laid down by custom in Isfahan upon the sale of property is one per cent from the seller and one per cent from the buyer. The Isfahan! does not always pay the above sum and generally keeps the broker waiting for a considerable period, whilst occasionally the brokerage is ignored and a smaller sum, according to the work periormeu, given instead. In the case of His Majesty’s Government I feel certain that a claim for a larger amount than the one per cent would be lodged if the sale is made to parties who had employed brokers. All the brokers seen by me during my stay at Isfahan were informed that I had no authority % to make use of their services. I have, etc., (Signed) H.A.D. Hoyland. H.3.H. CONSUL. Sir Reginald H.

BRITISH LEGATION, Gulhek. 8 th « T une, 1934* Sir, With referance to your despatch No*48 (K 1096/6/234) of January 24th last, concerning tha prooosed sale of tha Consular property at Isfahan, I have the honour to inform you that several tentative enquiries have been received but that no definite offers have materialised at the price - Rials two hundred and twenty thousand - stipulated by His Majesty’s Government. Mirza Haidar Ali Imami, when it came to the ooint, only made an offer of Rials one hundred and eighty thousand for the property including electric lighting installation. A local merchant named Mirza Muhammad Hassan Razzaz offered five thousand rials increase on any offer made or to be made for the property. Even so, it is doubtful whether in the present stagnant conditions of trade, any offer is likely to reach even Rials one hundred and ninety thousand. 2. In the course of these tentative negotiations for sale, the question has arisen of brokerage in the event of actual sale. Most of the enquiries have come from professional brokers acting for principals remaining in the background, and His Majesty^ Consul at Shiraz, who has personally spent several days at Isfahan in the hope of selling the property, has asked for guidance upon this point ... The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, a. C. S. I., etc*, etc., etc. , The Foreign Office. EMCLOS Nc 26 FROM ? £ 28Jlll\|. 1354'3 . ... point. It appears that a small payment, presumably on a percentage basis (two per centum to three per centum) will, in accordance with local custom, be expected from His Majesty’s Government by the broker who effects a sale. His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz is, at present, ascertaining the exact local basis of calculation of such payments. In the meantime, I should be grateful for some indication of the views of His Majesty’s Government in the matter. 3, l have the honour, further, to enquire whether, in the event of it being impossible to find a buyer for the prooerty at Rials two hundred and twenty thousand, I might be authorised to conclude a sale at not less than Rials one hundred and eighty thousand* I have reason to believe thrt several of the tentative enquiries received might have developed into sales had the pric e been in the neighbourhood of Rials one hundred and eighty thousand to one hundred and ninety thousand. My reason for suggesting this reduction in the price to be asked is that up till aeotember next a very suitable property for a Consular rest-house in Isfahan is available at a rent of Rials six thousand, five hundred per annum. it is in many ways more desirable for its purpose than the existing Consulate-General. The property has been strongly recommended to me by Mr. Hoyland, and it would be a pity to miss the chance of securing it. 4. Finally, I would request authority to include in the price of sale the electric light wiring and switches now existing in the houses other fittings would be removed.6. I should h# grateful for an Indication of your Yievs as soon as it can conveniently be given, having regard to the circumstances explained in paragraph 3 and of the fact that Mr. Hoyland is likely to visit Isfahan sometime during the hot veather and could then conclude the deal, if authorised.

My dear Minister, I thank you for your letter - Personal - 370/0.15 of the 7th instant. 2) - You will have met Colonel Fowle 'before the receipt of this letter and he will have given you the result of our discussion of the !, recess problem” which is set out at length in the letter I have addressed to him to-day, copy herewith. I hooe it will meet with your approval. 3) - This seemed the only solution and it is 'but a temporary arrangement, for the summer of 1934. By next summer however the arrangements for the Shiraz cum Isfa han consular district should 'be in working order and, as you say, it may suit 'both the work and ourselves to move up to Isfahan for two months or so. I hone that our servant problems will also be solved by then too. 4) - Meanwhile I have shown the Political Resident round house and property and he has promised to send up his Works officer to look into matters with a view to obtaining funds for repairs. That is so much gained for me and my successors. I am sorry that you should have been given all this trouble and again thank you for your interest. Yours sincerely, H. A. D. Hoyland.British Consulate, SHIRAZ, Aoril 16th 1934. My dear Fcrwle, With reference to your desire to occupy the Shiraz Consulate house during part of the summer, as a recess for yourself and the members of your staff, I now give you a record of our conversation yesterday morning. 2)- You were kind enough to listen to, and I hope bear with, my views as hereunder, i. e. : a) - That I did not consider it necessary, at present at any rate, to spend two consecutive months at Isfahan but rather to put in this time there in two or three visits during the year and that it is quite probable that my wife would not always accompany me: b) - That at this stage my work here must inevitably suffer from an extended absence; c) - That it would be very unfair upon my wife to have to repack our belongings. She has just had all the work of a difficult move from Kermanshah and of the re- installation here: d) - That the house is in a dilapidated condition and that I am most anxious to get on with and oversee the most urgent repairs of re-roofing, painting, plastering, white washing, &amp;c. , and of any other necessary repairs which may be sanctioned, including the wiring for electric lighting: e) - That such a move, at this juncture, would raise serious and costly domestic problems, the transfer of the servants alone entailing expenditure which is not recover able and which I do not consider I should be called upon to ... Lt. Colonel T. C.W. Fowle C.B.E. , I.A. , etc. , etc. , etc. 25 ' |!:1&lt; 2 t juny . i nto bear. Servants at Shiraz are very indifferent and some of the present staff are no exception to the rule. The process of building up a suitable house staff is now in hand: f) - That I have expended and am still called upon to provide what I consider large sums for the improvement and upkeep of the gardens, which have received the barest attention only for some years and that some of the benefits I am looking forward to would be lost to me: g) - That though I feel that a consul is entitled to the provision of a whole time residence at the place of his annointment, I recognize your own claims upon this property and respect your desire to provide a place of recess for your staff from the climate of the Gulf. 3) - Matters are facilitated this summer by the absence of children amongst the staff for whom it is desired to provide a change. I have suggested therefore that you and the three officers (including Major and Mrs. Rooney) should accept my hospitality for the periods of from ten to fourteen days when it is proposed that you should each come to Shiraz. The two rooms in the guest house would be at your disposal and in your own case the spare room in the house also, so that you could use the rooms in the guest house as an office, &amp;c. 4) - If you preferred and provided that it could be managed, I would endeavour to make my visit to Isfahan coincide with your own arrival at Shiraz, so that the entire house (with the exceptions hereafter) would be at your disposal for a week or two. For I should in that • • •that case reserve for ourselves our present hed-dressing- hath rooms for any unforeseen event requiring my presence at Shiraz and in order to avoid much packing, ulus the small room serving as my study in which some of our belongings could he put away. 5) - As I said there would he no question of 'paying guests' hut an extra payment to those of the servants upon whom the extra work will he thrown and I am thinking particularly of the kitchen personnel, might he considered. 6) - This arrangement between us is, as you have stated, 'without prejudice' and I should like to state once again that I could not extend it to married persons, with children . ■7)- I thank you for your consideration of my side of the matter and for accepting my counter-prooosals.

In para graph 2 of that Express Letter the India Office asked for our views and those of the Resident on paragraph 4 of Foreign Office letter of 21st Deer. 1933. As you will remember Hoare in his Despatch No.24 of the 13th Jany. objected somewhat strongly to the proposed superintendence of the Gulf Consulates by the Political Resident. We asked for Fowle f s comments and the India Office subsequently suggested in their telegram No.448 of the 17th Feby. that Fowle should defer any further observations pending demi-official consultation with Hoare. The only subsequent correspondence seems to have been Fowle f s demi-official letter No.277-3. of the 3rd March 1934 addressed to Tehran of which a copy was sent to you under his endorsement Despatch No.278^3. of 1934. We are inclined to think here that occasional visits by the Consul-General to Consulates in Southern Persia might be of value, but are hardly worth while, if,as Hoare suggests^ they may induce the Persian Government to raise again the whole question of the Political- 2 - Political Resident remaining at Bushire.

SBCHSTs cm British Legation, Tehran. 13th January, 1934. Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No. 528 (K 11336/11/234) of Oecember 22nd last, enclosing correspondence on the subject of Consular jurisdiction in South Persia. 2 . I hare a vague recollection that while X was in 5ingland some mention was made to me of the possibility of His Majesty^ Consul at Shiraz visiting his sub-post at Isfahan during the summer to allow the Consul-General at 3ushire a few weeks in the relative coolness of iihiraz, and X think that I agreed that with tactful friendliness on both sides some such arrangement might work - But from the enclosed correspondence I form a quite different impression which is that Hie Majesty’s Consul will be retired to vacate Shiraz rt during the periods when the Political Resident at Bushire wishes to spend his summer recess at Shiraz*. During that time His Majesty’s Consul will enjoy the amenities of a ’’small rest house'’ at Isfahan. 2. Now I bell eve’’summer recess* to be on a rough average three months. If I am right, I cannot possibly concur in a proposal under which His Majesty’s Consul, a man of forty nine years of age, saay be required to leave his home for three months on end at dates to be fixed by a third party. And what would the Persians think? Moreover, I take it that *recess* implies the conduct of official correspondence and the presence of typists, cypher officers and some small percentage of the 33 souls who compose the total strength of the political /Residency. The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Office.Residency. It is quite clear to my mind that Mr. Hoyland would be fully entitled to object to the presence of these people in his house and garden. It was decided to abolish the Consulate# General at Isfahan and maintain a full Consulate at Shiraz because Shiraz a potentially important political centre. That being the case I hold with insistenoe that the utmost that His Majesty’s Consul can be asked to do is to place his house either for two short periods of about a fortnight «*£ at the beginning and end of the summer or for one rather longer period in the middle of the summer at the disposal of Colonel tfowle and hia family. I cannot possibly subscribe - and I do not believe that Colonei Fowle would advance the pretension - to any i^eory that His Majesty’s Consul in an important region of Persia is called upon regularly to vacate his post in order that His Majesty's Consul-General at Bushire may establish himself there for a few months. With regard to the 'recess' of the Political Resident, if it merely means a prolonged escape from the rigours of the summer, it is obvious that Isfahan is just as suitable as Shiraz especially as it can be regarded as certain that the Minister here will always entertain the hope that the Political Resident will pay him a visit at b i lug during the summer. But if I have more correctly interpreted the term as a continued performance of functions from a distance then I feel bound to enter a general caveat . Ij. til. Conaul-u.noral at Buahire removes himself to the interior of peraie for two or three month., the t'erslane with their pettjtfogging way. will probably take exception to signaturea 'for tho Conan 1-General'. Again, if oypher talegrass for the Pollti.al Resident whiah would of /neoeaaltynecessity be addressed to His Majesty's Gonsa1 at Shires (who tas absent at Isfahan) were accepted and obviously answered fro« Shiraz we may be quite certain, unless by some strange chance I had entirely tamed the Persian Government, that either locally, here or at Bushire the Persians would make things unpleasant* 6 * Much of the above applies to the ^superintendence* of the Gulf Consulates by the Political Resident* 7* Personally, I am so thoroughly aware of what centralisation can be made to mean that I doubt whether there is anything of substance in the 'co-ordination of lnformation ,&gt; and the 'submission of comprehensive reports** With all due regard for the Political Resident and with a slavish respect for the knowledge which I can no longer aspire to gain, I deprecate this co-ordination business* I do so for the simple reason that on the whole I wish to retain on Persian soil a potential uncrowned king of South Persia and therefore I wish our representative at Bushire to be as in the past s very senior offieial especially as it is now not proposed to create a Consulate-General in Khuzistan, in case something happens* 3. as you are aware the Persians have frequently in the past suggested that the Political Resident should not be 'earthed' in Persia* It is some time since they last said so and it is possible that if we let him lie low ae a most definitely Consul-General at Bushire we may succeed in deterr ing them from pressing for his translation* 9* To sum up - I cannot entertain the idea that one of His Majesty's Consuls be reduced to the rank of caretaker* 10 * I believe that if we wish to retain the Political Resident on Persian soil we shall prejudice our /proepeetsprospects of doing soif anything suggests to a hyperssnsitire Persian Government that he is sonsthing acre in Persia than a Consul-General• 11 * I am sending copies of this despatch to Ihe Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (Mo* 3$ and to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Mo* 6 )* I have the honour to be with the highest respect. Sir, Tour most obedient, humble servant, (Signed) R. H. HoareX I auet confeeB that we were somewhat ehaitea by your despatch ao. %4 of January 13th about the use of the consular house at Shiraz by the Political Resident ani his right to visit and discuss questions with consular officers in the Gulf area* ^e were under the impression that you saw eye to eye with ue 04 both these points. &lt; ’ As you know f our letter of 1 ecefeber ijlst (X 11386/11/434) to the India iff ice was written after consultation with you and, as a matter of fact, we thiiik your apprehensions on both points are unfounded. Bo far as Hoyland’s personal dignity and comfort are concerned I do not think any difficulties are likely to arise. You may remember that we discussed the proposed arrangements with him and he said he would be quite happy to Sir Reginald hoare, K.C.M.G.to fall in with th«u In fact ay impression was that he would not be at all sorry to move to Isfahan from time to time. As regards the effect on the Persians, we should have thought that there could be nothing belittling in Persian eyes in Hoyland*a recessing at Isfahan from time to time. After all, it is a bigger place than Shiras, and such local Persians as took an interest in the question would be aware that it was included in his consular district. In anjr case there is nothing, so far as we know, to show that the Political Ke&amp;ident would stay at Shiraz for as long as three months in the summer. Judging by past experience it seems likely that in some years he would not go there at all. As regards your fear that our present decision may undemine the position of the Political Resident on Persian soil, you must of course be the best judge; but in any case this is a point which interests the Government of India and the Resident himself no less then His Kaje&amp;ty's Government and it seems highly unlikely to us that Fowle, even if he did not know how you feel, would for a momentdo anything likely to arouse suspicion among the Persian ^authorities, by, for instance, making hie recess at Shira* or his visits elsewhere with ary pomp and circumstance. Tlie point here is, we think, that when the kesident goes out of his district, either to Shires for his recess or on his proposed visits to neighbouring consular officers for purposes of keeping in touch, he naturally goes, so to speak, 'incognito vis-a-vis of both the Persians and the consular officers and not on 'State* visits. i need hardly gay, however, that though we hope your apprehensions are unfounded we are anxious to do anything we can to ensure that our decisions have no evil effects. To this end we think that the best plan will be for you to get into touch semi-officially with Fowle aa soon as possible and endeavour to reach a satisfactory arrangement with him on both points, bearing in mind, as regards the house at Shiraz, that it belongs to the Government of India. do not anticipate that there will be any serious difficulty a.out doing so, and we trust that the prospects of a successful issue will not have been prejudiced by Fowle'sou Fowle *8 having already received a copy of your despatch! A minor problem to which you drew attention concerned the manner of addreasing the Political Resident at Shiraz. Could not coomunications be sent to “Colonel Fowle, c/o “British Consulate*', or simply to 'British Consulate'? tfe have just seen a copy of a telegram of February 6 th in which the Government of India ask the Resident if he has any observations to make on your despatch. We have suggested to the India )ffice that they should ask the Government of India to let the question rest for the present as we are endeavouring to reach a settlement through semi-official channels.

For the reasons given in paragraph 2 of your letter, we agree that the Government of India hat'no financial interest in the sale of the Ramadan property. As regards Isfahan, our feeling was that India*s contribution from 1860 to the date of the Welby Agreement towards the cost of the posts under the Foreign Office might be held to cover part of the cost of the original purchase of the consular building at Isfahan. But since the basis of our contribution is at this date so very difficult to estimate, we do not propose to advance any claim for a share in the proceeds if and when this property is sold.

B*W.1* 13th September, 1933* Sir, With reference to your Letter, K 8954/11/^34, dated the 30th ultiao, about the disposal of the Consular Buildings at Isfahan and Hamadan, I am directed by the First Comnlsaioner of His Majesty’s works, etc., to state, for the information of Becr€itfary, Sir John Si on, that the Board would prefer to sell the properties outright. The Treasury have approved the sale of the Isfahan building within the li-aits of 220,000 - 250,000 rials, and it would be well, in the Board’s opinion, to close with this offer at the earliest possible date. It is to be hoped, therefore, that the Government of India will be pressed to give an immediate decision as regards the proposal to close the poet. 2* As regards the Haaadan Vice Consulate, if it can be taken as aefinite that the property will never be required again for Consular purposes, it will be preferable to sell it rather thum to let it. The buildings and site cost approximately £13,000 and if anything like this figure could be obtained it would obviously be indefensible to retain the premises as a summer resort for the Consular Officers at Ahwas and Hoh&amp;amerah. 3 . The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign 01’flee, S.W.l3* The possibility of selling the building will no doubt be tu*en up with the International Sleeping Cur Company.

Foreign Office, London, S.W.l 21st December, 1933. Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to state, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, that he has given careful consideration to India Office letter PZ 4837/33 of October 3rd, regarding the questions connected with the consular posts at Isfahan, Shiraz and Ahwaz. 2. Sir John Simon notes that Sir Samuel Hoare has been able to agree to the abolition of His Majesty*s Consulate-General at Isfahan. There is, however, serious objection to the inclusion of any part of the Isfahan consular district in the district attached to Eis Majesty*s Consulate at Tehran, and,in these circumstances, the Isfahan and Shiraz consular districts will be combined, as originally proposed, and placed under the control of the consular officer at Shiraz, who will continue to hold the rank of full Consul, as at present. Sir John Simon considers that, even had it been possible to attach the Isfahan consular district to His Majesty*s Consulate at Tehran, it would not have been feasible to place the important Shiraz district under the control of an officer of the rank of Consular Agent. ::y • ( mail . 3 3 The Under-Secretary of State, India C3. So far as the use of the consular house at Shiraz is concerned, the Secretary of State considers that His Majesty*s Consul should arrange to absent himself at Isfahan during the periods when the Political Resident at Bushire wishes to spend his summer recess at Shiraz. He feels, however, that, at other times, the consul should have first call on the house and that the Political Resident should then be able to stay there only by arrangement with the consul. The Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury have already agreed that if the consular property at Isfahan is sold, a small rest-house may be rented there for His Majesty's Consul at Shiraz, on the assumption that this accommodation is intended primarily for the use of the consul when visiting Isfahan on official business. It is assumed that this sanction would cover the use of the rest-house by the consul when he went to Isfahan to make way for the Political Resident at Shiraz, but the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury have been invited to confirm this assumption. 4. With regard to the functions of the Political Resident at Bushire, Sir John Simon considers it highly desirable that the Resident should visit and discuss matters with consular officers in the region of the Persian Gulf, with a view to the co-ordination of information and the submission of comprehensive reports to His majesty's Minister at Tehran. in this connexion it is noted that Sir Samuel Hoare has agreed in his letter Ho. PZ 7266/33 of November 14th that a moiety of the cost involved in two annual visits of the Vice-Consul /atat Bushire to the Arab Coast should be borne by Indian revenues. Sir John Simon was under the impression that the Political Resident already undertook these duties, but it would, in any case, be possible for him to do so without any modification of the existing consular organisation in the region concerned, andjin these circumstances, it seems unnecessary to contemplate any change in the present arrangements regarding the superintendence of consular posts. 5. The Secretary of State regrets that Sir Samuel Hoare has been unable to agree to the proposal that His Majesty’s Consulate for Khuzistan should be raised to the status of Consulate-General, but he does not desire to press this proposal for the present. 6. As regards the future seat of His Majesty’s Consulate for Khuzistan, Sir John Simon is inclined to think that the Consulate should remain at Ahwaz. This point, however, will receive further consideration and will form the subject of a separate letter, which will be sent to the India Office in due course. 7. Copies of this letter are being sent to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and to Treasury.

I also have the honour to suggest that in any case no action should be taken until the future of the consular posts at Isfahan and Shiraz is definitely settled (see my despatch No. 421 of 26th August and my private letter of the same date to Mr. Walker).

(fo-X- 4o, -British gOlh: No&gt; 462, October 6th; Sir With reference to your despatch No. 359 of August 29th (K 3954/11/234) regarding the possible lease of the consular properties at Isfahan and Haaadan to the International Sleeping Car Company, I have the honour to report that while it might prove possible to secure the Insertion in the leases of a clause provid ing for free accommodation for Consular officers reeessing at Isfahan and Hamadan, such an arrangement would, I fear, be unlikely to prove satisfactory# 2. It must be remembered that hotels in Persia are not like hotels elsewhere. I do not doubt that the Company's hotels will be cleaner and better run that the existing ones, but I doubt very much whether they will prove to be fundamentally different from them in style and general features. For instance, they may be expected to follow the usual plan of having no public rooms, except possibly a rather depressing dining-room, the servants are almost certain to be inefficient and untidy and the food is not likely to rise above a certain mediocre and monotonous level. In visualising these 'hotels' as possible places of retreat for Consular officers stationed in hot or unhealthy posts, it is in fact necessary to picture an Indian dak bungalow rather than a first class European hotel. The truth lies of course between the two, but I can aver that the dak bungalow is the nearer to the truth of the two# 3# The new hotels will, no doubt, be quite comfortable and suitable for visits of a night or two, but in the climate and livin, conditions of Persia a higher standard of comfort and privacy is necessary The Right Honourable Sir John Simon G.C.3.I., etc.y tc«, etc., FOREIGN OFFICE.-2 p necessary for longer periods* 4 . in the case of Isfahan the provision of an office all the “^.year round would still he necessary and if the present property is disposed of I consider it would he more satisfactory to tahe a slightly larger house than would he necessary for the office aloie and let the Consul he quite independent during his periodical visits. 5. As for Hanadan, if the Consul had a fanily of any sise they would fill most of the hotel and I douht whether the Company would when it came to the point relish providing much accommodation for a number of weeks during the sukuaer. I also doubt whether many Consuls would wish to leave their own homes in order to stay in a Persian hotelt although I am convinced that it is in the interest of all officers stationed or to he stationed in Khuzistan that they should come to the plateau for a period during the worst of the summer. My conclusion is therefore that His Majesty's Government should either lease the Hamadan house unconditionally or retain it as a recess-house. 6. I also venture to draw attention to my recommendation that the Consulate property at Isfahan mightyhejised as a recess-house for officers from Bushirs (see my despatch Ho. 421 of 86th August)* , , , ~~ ' 7.

We must, I think, agree with the Foreign Office as regards Hamadan but we might be -\ able to make out a case to participate in the sale proceeds of Isfahan.^ ^ &lt;$ f 1 ' ' On the other hand since writing my note I find that paragraph 242 of^Final Report of the Welby Commission states that after 1860 the Government of India 'contributed £12,000 towards the Mission^leaving the consulates at the sole charge of Great Britain' so that the implication in the India Office memorandum on which my note was based that the Government of India made a general contribution towards the cost of Foreign Office posts in Persia may not be strictly accurate. This somewhat weakens our claim. Mr. Grist agreed that our claim was pretty weak; but did not see any harm in putting it to the Foreign Office if we thought it worth while. An offer of Rials 220,000 was received for Isfahan and on this basis our claim would amount to about £700 but other cases of a similar nature may arise and so the point of principle is perhaps worth clearing up. It might, I think, be claimed that India has a good moral claim to share in the proceeds of sale of a building constructed before the time of the Welby Commission in view of the disproportionate share borne on Indian revenues of D. and C. expenditure in those days. 4./J 2 . 4. 5, 6 .

It may be mentioned that there is now a suggestion that both the Hamadan and Isfahan buildings might be leased to the International Sleeping Car Company on a long lease for use as hotels so the sale of Isfahan may not come about after all.

Many thanks for your letter No.K.1028lAl/234 of 3rd October, 1933, about the disposal of the proceeds in the event of the sale of consular properties at Hamadan and Isfahan. which the Government of India to v/hom we are sending a copy of this correspondence may have to make v/e agree that we have no claim to a share in the proceeds if the Hamadan property is sold. 3. As regards Isfahan we note that the consular building was bought in 1896. It is true that at that time the G # of I. made no specific contribution to the cost of the Isfahan post but from 1860 to the date of the Welby Settlement India made a contribution (reduced to £7,000 in 1890) towards the cost of the posts under the Foreign Office besides paying exclusively for the cost of all posts on the Indian establishment. We observe that in paragraph 242 of the Final Report of the Welby Commission it is stated that after 1860 the consulates in question were left at the sole charge of Great 2 Subject to any comments 1925 5000 6.33 BritainBritain lout nevertheless the Indian contribution has usually been regarded as covering the consulates asjwell as the Legation and in this connection it is perhaps worth noting that the annual contribution of £12,000 made by India from 1860 to 1880, if intended to be applied only to the expenses of the Legation^ must have covered more than three quarters of the cost. 4. It seems to us therefore that the Government of India might claim to share in the proceeds of the sale of the Isfahan buildings in the same proportion as they contributed to the cost of Foreign Office expenditure in Persia in 1896. The only reliable figures which we can find for Foreign Office expenditure in Persia; about this time are those quoted in Vol.II Appendix No,65 of the Welby Report covering the three years 1893-4 to 1895-6, and it appears that something might have to be added to these on account of capital expenditure on buildings which is not apparently included. On this basis India’s share in the proceeds of the sale of Isfahan would amount to something approaching a third, but possibly the Foreign Office may be able to■ '( — ' Draft Paper. to find more comprehensive figures of Foreign Office expenditure in Persia from 1890 onwards. Department.3rd October, 1933 1933. (K 10281/11/234) ) n Allchin tells me that you rang him up on August 30th to ask what would hecome of the proceeds if we sold the consular properties at Hamadan and Isfahan. 2. We find that the purchase of the consular site at Hamadan was authorised in 1926 and that sanction was obtained for the building of the consular residence and office in 1927. In both cases therefore the expenditure was incurred after the decision had been taken to exclude capital expenditure on the consular establishment in Persia from the annual adjustment between the Treasury and the Government of India. It accordingly seems clear that, if the Hamadan property is sold, the Government of India will have no claim to share in the proceeds. 3. The consular building at Isfa’ s bought in G.E.

Moreover, the Welby Agreement, in fixing the contribution to be paid by the Government of India towards the expenditure on the Mission and Minor Consulates in Persia, did not take into account the price paid from Imperial revenues for the purchase of the building in 1896. In 1923 the Treasury sanctioned expenditure on the extension of the building at Isfahan but no charge was included against the Government of India for the capital expenditure on this account. It therefore seems that, if the Isfahan property is sold, the Government of India would not participate in the proceeds.^ \ r Ijetter Telegram from Register No. P. z. 4837/33. Political Department.

Please see the previous suhraission on P.Z.3206/3^ about consular reorganisation in South Western Persia, The proposals put forward on this subject by the Foreign Office are as follows:- (a) That the Consulate-General at Isfahan should be abolished, the property being retained on a care and maintenance basis, 3 or 4 visits being paid annually to it by the Consul at Shiraz, and Isfahan being incorporated in the Shiraz consular district (Shiraz rather than Isfahan being selected to survive as an independent consular post on the ground that it is more potentially active). (b) That the status of the Consular Officer at Ahwaz should be raised from Consul to Consul General, aKjVice-Consul being retained at Mohammerah. (c) A further point which arises in the same connection is whether, if the Foreign Office proposal is accepted, the consular headquarters of the area under consideration should be fixed at Mohammerah rather than at Ahwaz. 2. We have now had in detail the views on these proposals of Colonel and of the Government of India. The position is briefly as follows: (a) Abolition of the Consulate-General at Isfahan . This is accepted by all parties. (b) Arrangements to be made in respect of Isfahan and Shiraz . The Re sident agrees in the proposed reduction of Isfahan to a care and maintenance basis. ^ie suggests, however, the possibility of a further jeconoray, viz. the appointment at Shiraz in place of a Consul of a Consular Agent, who should be under the control of Bushire, Bushire and Shiraz in future to form/ 1712n 5000 3/33- 2 - form part of a single consular area. Isfahan in this event might he absorbed in the Tehran consular area. The Gove rnment of India, support the Resident’s view on the grounds of economy, but suggest that if for reasons not within their knowledge it proves impossible to amalgamate Isfahan and Tehran the proposals of the Foreign Office should be accepted, subject to an arrangement being made under which the Consul-General, Bushire will be free to recess in the consular house at Shiraz (which is, of course, the property of the Government of India.) (c) Future status of Ahwaz . Colonel Fowle is strongly opposed to the establishment of a Consulate- General at Ahwaz. His arguments are set out in paragraph 6 of his despatch of 21st June, No.691-3, on P.Z.4224. As pointed out by IVir. Walton in his note on P.Z.3206/33 below, there is probably on general grounds a good deal to be said for the Foreign Office proposal on this point. The Government of India strongly support the Resident’s view and indicate that they can see no justification for the additional expenditure from Indian revenues involved in an increase of the status of the post. On the question whether Mohammerah is a more suitable centre than Ahwaz for the headquarters of the Khuzistan consular district, Colonel Fowle is disposed to favour Moharrrnerah. The Government of India’s views are not very clear, the letter of 25th toy 1933 to which they refer in paragraph 4 of their air mail letter of 31st July on P.Z.4822 being irrelevant /^? Ul+j J 4 (d) The Resident makes in addition a fresh suggestion, viz. that the Consul-General, Bushire should be given some form of general superintendence on/1712b 5000 3/3.7 &amp; - 3 - Minute Paper. Department. on the lines indicated in paragraphs 7 and 8 of his ^ despatch No.691-3 of 21st June, on P.Z.4224. He has n&amp;de it clear in d.o. correspondence (see the note on P.Z.1457 flagged helow) that 'behind my suggestion for •superintendence* there lies no idea whatever for an •imperium in iniperio* under the aegis of the Consul- General Bushire. The latter officer is definitely under the orders of the Minister and such •superintendence* would not cut off the latter from direct contact with or from giving direct instructions to the other consular officers involved should he see fit to'. The Government of India support the Resident's view. 3. As regards point (a) above we might, I suggest, support the view of the Government of India, indicating that if the difficulties in amalgamating Isfahan and Tehran and in reducing Shiraz to a post held by a Consular Agent are insuperable we are then prepared to accept the Foreign Office proposals, subject to an understanding about the Shiraz house. There is reason to believe that the Foreign Office are likely to be amenable on this latter point and possibly to arrange that the Consul at Shiraz, if their proposal to retain a Consul at that post is accepted, shall arrange his visits to Isfahan so that the Shiraz house shall be vacant for use if desired by the Consul General during his summer recess. We may, in this connection, agree that every &gt; suitable opportunity should be taken to dispose of I the Isfahan property (see Foreign Office letter of i 27tb July on P.Z.4549/33 flagged), and that in the event/4 event of its disposal it will be necessary to rent a M if P” 1 small resthouse at Isfahan for the use of a Visiting Consular Officer. (This will he the case whether Isfahan is absorbed by Tehran or made subordinate to Shiraz, for in the former event visits three or four times a year by an officer of consular standing will presumably be no less necessary than in thelatter). . The house appears to be the property of the Foreign Office (as the Shiraz house is of the Government of India). Subject to confirmation of this assumption, (which is being checked) we should have no interest in the sale proceeds. 4. As regards the proposal to raise Ahwaz to a Consul ate-General, there is, as Mr. Walton points out In his minute on P.Z.3S06/33, considerable force in the Foreign Office arguments and Ido not think that they are altogether disposed of by the counter arguments adduced by the Resident and the Government of India. On the other hand, this is, as we know, a point on which the Resident feels strongly, and our general principle being to endeavour so far as possible to concentrate responsibility in the Gulf in his hands, we might, I think, at any rate in the first instance , support the proposals of Colonel Fowle and the Government of India. Ah additional reason for doing so, from our point of view, is that if we are obliged to move the Resident’s headquarters from Bushire, the Foreign Office are likely to urge strongly 4 that the Consul-General Ahwaz shall become responsible for Bushire and Bunder Abbas. In the interest of retaining the Resident as the chief coordinating authority in the Gulf and preserving for him some degree of close liaison and control in South Persia, we had hitherto been anxious to secure that k n fv©.Minute Paper. Department. that the Consuls at BushIre and Bunder Abhas should i &amp;-vent remain nominally independent tut in practice under the control of the Resident, to whom &lt;rk _ they would submit reports, etc., and ^staffed by officers of the Indian Political Department. The Foreign Office, not unnaturally, have consistently aimed at bringing the South Persian consulates so far as possible under Tehran, and the establishment of a Levant Consul General at Ahwaz or Mohammerah would make them still more reluctant than at present to agree to leave the Resident a foot in Persia in the event of his headquarters being moved to Bahrein. It should be noted that in any case the Government of India appear to take the view that they cannot properly be called on to meet the increased expenditure which would be involved in the establishment of a Consulate-General, having regard to the relatively small degree of Indian interest involved. I do not think that so long as the existing arrangement about the 50/50 division of Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia holds good, we can reasonably maintain this attitude, though the Government of India, in so far as they might have to share the cost, are of course entitled to take exception to the proposal as involving new expenditure vfoich they regard as uncalled for. It seems best, in writing to the Foreign Office, to make no reference to this suggestion and state our attitude in general terms. 1712n 5000 3/33 5. The relative advantages of Mohammerah and Ahwaz are not matters on which we are in a position : to express any very decided view. The letter to which/6 which the Government of India refer as stating their views (No. F.105-A/33 of 25th IViay, on P.Z.3376/33) merely records that they have no financial interest, since under the provisional arrangement regarding new capital expenditure, expenditure at Ahwaz (and the same -sb true of(Mohamerah) would fall wholly on |gri Imperial revenues. So far as the position of the Resident is concerned, a Levant Consul-General at Mohammerah, where he would he in direct contact with r the Coast and the Navy, would he more of a rival than at Ahwaz. But we cannot well take that point. 5. The question of the exercise of some general coordination hy the Consul-General, Bushire is one of importance to us as affecting the position of the Resident. It will he remembered that it was agreed I at an earlier stage (with the greatest reluctance on the part of the Foreign Office - whose abjections are fully shared hy the present Minister at Tehran) that should the Residency he moved from Persia it should he moved only on conditions which would make it possible for the Resident to keep in touch with the political affairs of the South Persian coast in the capacity of Visiting or Superintending Consul-General. Both this office and the Government of India felt strongly at the time that the importance of maintaining the Residen as coordinating officer in the Gulf was in any circunstances great, and might in the future he still greater, in view of the uncertainty as to what would happen in Persia in the event of the death or disappearance of the Shah, and a* agreement to the removal of the Residency from Persia was strictly contingent on the conditions in question. Jipart from this, affairs on one side of the Gulf have an intimate t connection with affairs on the other, and were the Resident to he wholly excluded from the South Persian coastMinute Paper. Department. coast he would inevitably to some extent he at a disadvantage. The naval authorities are understood to share the present Resident's view on this subject. It is just possible that as part of the treaty negotiations we may be able to secure the retention of the Residency at Bushire. The Persians appear to 1 attach little importance to the point; Sir R. Hoare at a recent meeting of the Middle Bast Sub-Committee expressed the view that, if the worst came to the worst, they were unlikely to press for its removal from Persia: and (while there is much to be said on general grounds for transfer to Bahrein) removal will cost probably £100,000. It may be that our best line with the Persians on this matter will be to insist on our conditions for the removal of the Residency, which are stated by the Minister to be very unacceptable to them, in the hope that we may be able to persuade them that the question is of little practical importance to them and, if they are unwilling to accept our conditions, might be allowed x to drop. In either event, however, there is a great deal to be said for giving the Resident or the Consul-General some degree of coordinating authority, subject, of course,.to such restrictions as might be necessary to safeguard the position of the Minister and of the Foreign Office. I suggest that for the moment we should support the proposal of the Resident and the Government of India. It can, if necessary, be further discussed interdepartmentally with the assistance of Colonel Fowle once we have expressed ourselves officially to the Foreign Office. i M cs^l 0 (\ r- 8 - 7* I attach a draft letter to the Foreign Office, j | Cl««A C ' I I , I have discassed this with Col. i'owle. He is i very keen on some measure of superintendence to be exercised at Bushire over the consulates in Southern Persia, for the sake of co-ordination of information and proposals. His reason is that to a large extent similar questions crop up in different parts of this area, and to some extent also the problems that arise affect noo only the Persian but also the iirab shore of the Gulf, and I versa . As Consul-General in Southern Persia and also Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, he is in the best position to co-ordinate all Gulf problems; the Persian Gulf, as Sir Hugh Biscoe also frequently pointed out, is to a large extent a single problem, and must be treated as a whole. If, however, the F.O. post at Ahwaz is elevated to a consulate-general (whether or not its seat is transferred to Mohammerah), it will make 'superintendence by Bushire over the new Consul-General obviously impracticable. For this reason Col. Fowle hopes that the elevation of the Ahwaz post will not go through. I fear, however, that it will be very difficult to dissuade the F.O. from their proposal to raise the status oi the Ahwaz post; the proposal is put forward in British interests, and the G. of I.'s express letter does not provide us with any useful arguments against it, since they confine themselves to pointing out that it is not required in Indian interests. We are hardly in a position to dispute the F.O. view that it is required in Bfitisfe interests (mainly/1712r 5000 3/33 Minute Paper. Department. (mainly the importance of the Anglo-Persian oilfields), and we are therefore reduced to the argument of economy; nor can we press the latter argument to the point which the G. of I. seem to have in mind - viz .. refusal to share the expenditure - since diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia is shared as a whole, and the question of reallocation of expenditure can only be taken up as a whole; if this question were tackled piecemeal it is very doubtful whether the G. of I. would come off best; the Indian Political Service is more costly than the F.O.

As regards the proposal that the post of Consul-General at Isfahan should be abolished, but that the consular property should be retained on a care and maintenance basis under the supervision of H.M. Consul at Shiraz, in whose present consular district the district of Isfahan would be incorporated, I am to say that the S/S agrees with the views expressed by the G.of I. in para.2 of their air mail letter of 31st July. In the interests of economy he wishes strongly to support the alternative suggestion originally put forward by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and accepted by the G.of I. that Isfahan should be incorporated in the Tehran consular district, Shiraz V\nA£? 1925 5000 G.33 being/being served by a Consular Agent of s the status of the present Pro-Consul control of the Consul-General Bushire. Should it for any reason prove impossible to amalgamate the Isfahan and Tehran consular districts, the S/S would however be prepared to r concur in the Ministers proposal to incorporate Isfahan in the Shiraz I consular district, subject to the understanding that arrangements are made to allow the Political Resident to use the Consulate at Shiraz as a residence during his summer recess, and he desires to support the suggestion made by the G f of I. that this might be arranged without inconvenience to the Consul, were it possible for that officer to make one of his visits to Isfahan coincide wit: the absence from Bushire of the Political Resident. I am to add that in either event the proposals in Foreign Office letter No, K.7203/11/234 of 27th July for the disposal of the property at Isfahan, and agrees that in the event of the disposal of the property it will be necessary to rent-a omall rasthouse- at Isfahan for the use of the Consular Officer (on the assumption that whether Isfahan is incorporated in there, who should come under the Sir s. Hoare would objection to the Tehran or in the Shiraz area threeJ? Draft Paper. Department. three or four visits a year hy an officer of consular rank will he desirable). 3. The S/S has given full weight to the arguments adduced hy the S/S for P.A. for raising the status of the Consul at Ahwaz to that of a Consul-General. He recognises the force of the arguments in question. But on a careful consideration of the position as a v\hole in the light of the views expressed hy the Political Resident and the G.of I. he is not satisfied that a case has been made out for the■proposed elevation of the status of this post, and regrets that, as at present advised, he is unable to support it. 4. Sir Samuel Hoare notes that the Political Resident is disposed to regard Mohammerah as a better centre for the Khuzistan consular district than Ahwaz, but does not desire to express any opinion on this point. 5. The s/3 in conclusion directs me to say that he wishes strongly to support the suggestion put forward by the Political Resident and the G.of I. that some measure of general superintendence over the various consular posts in South Persia and the Persian Gulf should he given to 1925 5000 6.33*■ ■-A the Consul-General, Bushirs* The s/3 has no desire to suggest such a measure of superintendence as would in any way impinge on the position of the Minister at Tehran and all that he has in view is that the Consul-General I Bushire should he given a status hy llJ 7 which he could visit and discuss nBtters with the consular officers r under his superintendence, and submit as occasion might necessitate suggestions to the Minister at Tehran and the G.of 1. for the coordination of effort over the whole of the area | of which the various consular districts involved are merely parts Even in ordinary circumstances such superintendence would, in the view of the 3/3 have distinct advantage, and the case for it would he very greatly strengthened in the event of material alteration of the position in Persia. If the S/S for F,A. is disposed to share the S/S’s view on this point, advantage might he taken of the presence in this country of ht.Col. Powle to discuss a possible basis for it. 6.

July 15th 1935 Sir, I have the honour to report that I have recently been ' approached hy the National Bank,, acting on behalf of Ur, Chaker, the near eastern Manager, of the International Sleeping Oar Company, with regard to the leasing of the Consular properties at Isfahan and Hamadan. 2. The Company desire to extend their system of motor services in Persia as a means of increasing traffic on the Taurus Express. For this purpose the provision of better hotels or rest-houses in certain towns is essential and in this the Company have the support of the National Bank, who are anxious to promote the tourist traffic of Persia generally. 3. Mr. Chaker was recently in Tehran and before his departure commissioned the National Bunk to arrange for the lease of suitable houses in Isfahan and Hamadan. He mentioned in partic ular the British Consular properties, which he had seen and thought very suitable. Mr. Chaker’s requirements are that the proprietor of any property eventually leased shall himself pay for the alterations that the Company require and recoup himself on the rent. The alterations would include the installation of modern sanitation and baths where these were lacking and some splitting-up of bed-rooms: nothing would be needed that would detract from the suitability of the property as a private residence in future. The lease would have to be for at least ten years. 4. The National Bank explained that if the proprietor lacked the necessary capital, they, the Bank, would assist by advancing money The Right Honourable Sir John Simon O.C.S.I., etc. , etc. , etc. , FOREIGN OFFICE.f &lt;/ money at the usual rate of Interest (8$ at present). But they presumed this would be unnecessary in the case of His Hajesty’s Government. 5. The Bank were informed that it was unlikely that His Majesty 1 s Government would wish to spend money on improving the houses at Isfahan and Homaden, and that in any case it would be desirable that they should first be told exactly how much money the company would require them to spend. It transpired, however, that the Company’s architect was resident in Baghdad and as a special journey for the purpose of drawing up exact plana would be expensive it was agreed that I should first report the general scheme to you and ask whether His Majesty’s were prepared to entertain it in principle. 6. The National Bank also asked what rent His Majesty’s Government would expect, but it was impossible to give them any exact information. In each case the rent would need to be calculated on a double basis; the original, or natural, rent, and interest and amortisation of capital outlay. 7. As regards Isfahan there is practically no standard of comparison, although I have heard from a private source that the National Bank would probably pay seventy tomans a month (I suppose this means for the property as improved). From the same source I learn that the property is considered locally to be worth about twenty five thousand to thirty thousand tomans, but wil! probably increase in value in the next few years if certain projected street widening improvements in the neighbourhood are carried out. 8. As regards Hamadan, the property was let furnished during the summer of 1932 for four months at three pounds a week, whilst a local merchant also once offered to lease the property for five years for nine hundred tomans or ninety pounds a year. The Company do not need any furniture. * 9•* ■mp 9. From what I may call the personal point of view of His Majesty’s legation, T should be exceedingly reluctant to lose the property at Hamadan, the use of which as a recess house lor the Consular Officers at Ahwaz and Mohammerah seems likely to have an almost revolutionary effect on the amenities of service at those two posts. The leasing of Isfahan would not matter greatly as I suppose it would always be possible to rent a smaller and possibly more convenient building instead. 10. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Acting British Consul, Kermanshah (No. 17), the British Consulate- General, Isfahan, at Shiraz (No. 16) and to His Majesty’s Consul, Ahwaz, (No. 6^).

Reorganisation of consular establishment in Persia* 2* The Govexnment of India welcome the proposal of His Majesty* s Minister, Tehran, to reduce the cost of Consular representation in South Persia and agree that the post of Consul General, Ispahan, should be abolished imaedlately, the Consular property being retained on a care and maintenance basis* They are also in y. agreement with His Majesty's Minister that some further reduction in the existing Consular establishment at Shiraz and Ispahan can be effected without impairing the essential fabric of British 1 Consular representation in South Persia upon the maintenance of which they laid stress in 1931* They do not however consider that the method of effecting this reduction which has been proposed by his Majesty*s Minister is altogether satisfactory and suggest as an alternative that Ispahan should be incorporated in the Consular district of Tehran, Shiraz being put in charge of a Consular Agent, of the status of the present pro-Consul, under the control of the Consul General at Bushire. This arrangement would (Su?w3£u*e)not only lend to greater savings than the scheme proposed by His Ifiaoesty*s Minister, since it would effect the abolition both of the Consul General at Ispahan and the Consul at Shiraz, but nould^also be more satisfactory in other nays* The Government of India consider it most desirable that the Consul General at Bushire should be able to escape from the heat of the persian Gulf for some time during the summer* Shiraz is conveniently dost to Bushire, has a suitable jek climate and possesses in the present Consulate a building originally constructed by the Government of India for the use of the Political Resident in the Gulf during his recess* The Consular Agent, who they propose should in future be in charge of Shiraz, would live in the town and the Consulate would thus be available for occupation by the Resident. Ttaile they consider that this proposal has much to commend it both as regards economy and administrative convenience the Government of India reco&amp;iise that there may be difficulties of which they are not at present aware, in the way of amalgamating the Ispahan and Tehran Consular districts* Should this be found, after investigation, to be the case, they would be prepared to concur in the Ministers proposal to incorporate Ispahan in the Shiraz Consular district provided that arrangements are made to allow the Consul General to use the Consulate at Shiraz as a residence during his summer recess* They observe that His Majesty 1 s Minister has proposed that the Consul in charge of the combined Shiraz-Ispahan district should visit Ispahan three or four times &amp; year and note that the Consul General there states in his letter of the Slat December 1932 that its climate is preferable to that of Shiraa during the summer months* It seems possible, therefore, that the Consul might find it convenient to make one of his visits to IspahanIspahan coincide with the Political Resident's absence from Bub hi re. 3» The Government of India have examined with tare the arguments adduced by His Majesty's Minister for raising the status of the Consul at &amp;)*waz to that of Consul General The most important of the factors which, in the Minister's opinion, require the presence in Ahwaz of a Consular Officer of higher rank than is now held by His Majesty's representative in Khuzistan are (a) the Jnglo-Persian Oil Coy; (»&gt;» the interests of His Majesty's Government and the Government of Iraq in the Shattel-«lrab; and (c) the politics of the Bakhtiarl and other tribesmen of Khuzistan» TELth regard to (a) the Government of India would obaerre that tinder the new agreement between the Anglo** Persian Oil Company and the Persian Government the number of Indian employees of the Company is likely to be considerably less in future than it has been in the past* As for (b) the interests of India in the Shatt-el-Arab are minute in comparison with those of Great Britain and Iraq, while with regard to (c) the Government of India desire to point out that a watch over the politics of the Bakhtiari, Lur and other tribesmen has been maintained by a Consul in the past with no apparent lack of success* In the opinion of the Gov eminent of India none of these factors could justify them in incurring the additional e 2 &lt;penditure which the proposal involves* They regret therefore that the? must adrtnw adhere to the views expressed by them in 1931 and are not in favour of the status of the post being raised* 4* The views of the Government of India on the proposal to transfer the headquarters of the Kfrazistan Consular districtdistrict fro© Ahvfez to Kohammerah were given In their Foreign and Politics!

In paragraphs 7 and S of his letter of the 21st June 1933 Colonel Fowle has urged the desirability of giving to the Consul General Bus hire some measure of superintendence over the various Consular posts in South Persia and the Persian Gulf. The Government of India agree with Colonel Fowle that some such control should be exercised by the Consul General and support his proposals. 6.

Mr. Aratoon has replied that His Majesty’s Government, if ever they wish to sell the property, will not take less than Rials two hundred and fifty thousand, hut at the urgent request of the would-be purchaser he has consented to report the offer to His Majesty’s Legation. 2. I am not aware of the basis of Mr. Aratoon’s quotation of the sum of Rials two hundred and fifty thousand, but tactically his reply was as good as any other. 3. Although this offer is an improvement on former offers, which were very low, and although the rate of exchange is temporarily favourable, there is still little to be gained by disposing of the property, and I should still prefer to retain it at any rate until the experiment of combining the posts of Isfahan and Shiraz has been in force for a year or two.

But there is no reason why higher authorities in the shape of the Government of India and the India Office - if they see fit - should not Mot the is and cross the t e 1 with greater emphasis on the following points: Consul-Generalship at Ispahan and create a new one at Ahwaz or Mohammerah, r 'his is a point which I thought it better to leave to the Government of India to maVe - if they want to. After all it is from their budget, not mine, that the 50-P0 basis of Consular and diplomatic representation in Persia with His Majesty’s Govrnraent has to be met. for the raising of the consular status of Khuzistan to a Consulate-General is to find a billet for the senior officers of the Levant Consular Service, but I could hardly nut it as baldly as this. above. A further economy would be to telescope the Ispahan and ^ehran Consulates - vide paragraph 4 of my personal and confidential letter of 15th February 1933 to r W.K.‘^raser- w ytler,M.C. # Metcalfe./ Officiating foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla.

The general ’superintendence’ I suggest for the Consul-General, Bushire, ie realljr Blight, but it does give some sort of eo-ordination in South Persia, and the Gulf generally, which - especially in times ofunrest - will, I am convinced, be a distinct advantage.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to Secretary of State’s frfC? telegram Ho. 1617, dated the 17th June 1933, regarding the prooosals contained in ^reign ffice letter ho.E 3791/11/234 of 31et Kay 1933 to the India Office. 2* Three questions would seem to he involved: A, The amalgamation of the Shiras and Ispahan Consulates. B, Vdiether the seat of the Khuzistan Consular Authority should he at Ahwaz or Mohammerah. C, Aether this Consular Authority should he a Consul or a Consul-General. 3. -Llth regard to A . Personally, I am of opinion that at Shirai a Consular Agent - of the status of the present Pro-Consul there, Khan Bahadur Abdul Ahad Wazir- sadeh - would he sufficient for this post where there is little work nowadays, and that this Consular Agent should come under the control of the Consul-General, Bush!re. If - as seems to he generally anticipated - the present regime/regime ’crashes' ^hrn the Shah dies, or falls from power, and a period of anarchy - or unrest - follows, which will probably be most felt in the southern districts, it will be advantageous to hove the Hhiraz-Bushire areas under a single Consular Authority# 4# ?rom another point of view, too, a Consular Agent at Shiraz would be suitable since he would live in the town and leave the Consulate free for the Consul-General’s summer recess, which is the purpose for which it was originally built. At present neither the Consul-General nor his staff have anywhere to recess to from the noisome summer climate of Bushire. It is essential that the Consul- General should have suitable summer quartern in which he can house himself, members of his staff as necessary, and some clerks, and such quarters can only be found in the present Consulate at Hhiraz. 5 * Mth regard to B. I no t e that Sir Reginald Hoare in hin despatch Ko .l61 _of 7th April 1933 to the 'Foreign Office, giving cover to a desnatch ho.14 of 27th March 1933 from His Majesty’s Con ail, Ahwaz,was Inclined to modify his views as to the desirability of Ahwaz over Hoharamerah. erson ally T think T 0 r the reasons given in Mr.Watkifcson’s ^esnatch that Mohamraerah is preferable to Ahwaz. nie arrangement suggested at the end of paragraph 2 of Mr. a+ nnson’s despatch would appear to be suitable and economical. r ’be Munshi suggested by Mr. W a tkinson might be given the rank of °ro-Consul, or Consular Agent# 6 * to C. Personally, I do not quite r,ee the Bec « B »ity of raising the rank of the Consular Authority/-3- Authority from Consul to that of Consul-General. ?»r many years past the Consular Officer in Khuzistan has had V. the rank of Consul, which has been sufficient to giro hi® the necessary authority vis a vis the Persian authorities and the Jtafclo-Persian Oil Company Limited, and I doubt Whether political conditions have now altered so much as to call for a change. ’’’here are, of course, the social arguments adduced by Sir Reginald Hoare in his despatch Ho.99 (Ho.44 to Government of India) of 11th March 1933, as ^ to the advantages in seniority and pay of our Consular Authority in Giuzistan having the rank of Consul-General, but as far as entertaining is concerned, the fact that the Consular Officer was a Consul-General, mi^rfc force on him vis a vis the higher employees of the Anglo-Persian Oil Comoeny Limited a more expensive standard of enter tainment than would perhaps be covered by his larger emoluments. As long as the Officer remains a Consul less, in this way, is I suppose expected of him. 7. With regard to the general question of Consular re present at ion in f^outh ’ersia, I cannot help feeling that advantage would be gained by the Consul-General, Bushire, exercising some measure of consular control over this area, the various Consular districts of which - Bandar Abbas, Bush!re itself, Bhiraz, and Khuzistan - are in various ways interdependent. This control until some years ago was exercised by the Consul-General’s exequatur covering these districts, and was found especially useful in t mes of unrest, such as Sir Reginald Hoare envisages may/4 may return with the death or fall from power of the present Shah - a view with which I entirely concur. There is no question of caking an extenaion of the Consul-General, Buahire’e exequatur from the Beraian Government - the latter would certainly refuse. A measure of consular control could, however, be introduced by putting the Consular Officer of the districts concerned under the ’’superintendence* of the Consul-General, Bushire. This, I believe, would confonn to ^Foreign Office practice; Tehran Legation, for instance, suggested that Bandar Abbas might so be placed under my superintendence - vide their Chancery letter ^o.BlT-ST (415 to foreign Office, 198 to Government of India) of 25th September 1932. Ho sanction, of course, would be required for this arrangement from the Persian Government. The measure of consular control under this ’superintendence* would naturally be considerably less than in the days when the Consul-General’s exequatur ran throughout South ’ersia. •^he Consular Officers of the districts concerned would, of course, remain, as now, under the direct control of the Minister, but as Superintending Consul-General I vould presumably have some sort of status for visiting and dis cussing matters with the Consular Officers concerned, and * for putting up to the Minister from time to time suggestions and opinions on the co-ordination of our efforts over the whole area In question. At present - as I understand the situation - my consular authority begins and ends with Bushire. 8 . A further argument in favour of giving the Consul- General, Bushlre, some such slight measure of consular superintendence is the fact that he is also Besident for the Ara V5- Ara”b Bide of the !?erBian Gulf. It is difficult to pl&amp;cr the tuo sides of the Gulf in water-tight compartments: events on one side - more than ever in these days - have repercussions on the other, and ^onld, I think, be convenient for the higher authorities in eh.’ an, ^imla, and London to have one officer on the spot who would be in a position, when need be, to present a picture of the Gulf as a whole, with its various needs and complications. Co-operation, for instance, with H*M*Sloops in the Gulf would be best secured - especially in times of unrest such as already envisaged, when the presence of sloops may be urgently required at various ports through one officer, *ho,in his Superintending Consular capacity, would be able - subject naturally to the instructions of the Minister - to take a view of the needs of the Persian side, and, in his capacity of Pesident, to take into account also the needs of the Arab coast.

The only housa in Ahwa*, in the occupation of the nglo 'er&amp;ian Oil Company,which in my opinion, is really suitable as tfa&lt;* residence of a senior Consular Officer, is that knovm as 'So.l Bungalow', situated in the centre of the to*n next to the site regard!n- which are in negotiation with Kadji vein. This house contains six bedrooms and adequate accomo dation for servants, and it is in a large old-establiehed garden, as it ie the only house at present available in Ahw*s offering the necessary facilities for the accomodation of senior officials of the Company and other guests who may be passing through, it is highly improbable that they would be willing to let it go. It has the additional convenience of being within a /short H. R.

According to a letter addressed to tay ,-rode- oessor by Mr. Cle-g, the Ahwa« Manager, in July 1930, 'tfo.l 'umcuio &lt;” 1 b le* 3e(5 from the fheikh of ohasnerah, th© ownership of this land baio : in dispute between the Sheikh and Hadji Mola. I tm told that this is still the position. 4. Th© only other promises in whioh similar accomodation mi^ht be available era tha hospital build in 'g at r ha^alieh, of *.hioh I occupy a portion. These consist of a gaunt and ugly building, known as M ??o.lS Bungalow*, containing some fourteen rooms, and a ssukli open stable in a separate enclosure, detoribed as an isolation w&amp;rd, which has been pluoed at my disposal for ub© ae a garage. This bungalow was built about two years ago end is said to be the be; t constructed building in the Anglo ersian Oil Company compound. Cuch garden a© exists is in its infancy and is barely worthy of the name. I am living in the quarters designed for the resident medical officer, ©ho was withdrawn from Ahwa^s lust suanier, consisting of about one third of th© building. Part of the remainder is used a© a diepene&amp;ry for employees of the Anglo Persian oil Company* 5. There is no,Apparent reason why the dispensary could not be housed in on® of the half do^en smaller bun;&amp;io**© which are at present empty. 6. a simple solution would be to persueda the Anglo Persian Gil Company to use this building to house their Ahwa.* Manager, thus uniting the whoi© staff at Khaaalieh. I should be most averse to putting forward any such suggestion to the Clenaral Manager at Abadan or3 to th&amp; pr*® 0 nt occupants of ’’No.l Bungfclo^ ', to v*hora I am personally indebted for many ^indnssoea and faci lities. But it is poaaible that ths matter might be oisousoed with the ;iesldant M&amp;n&amp;ger in Tehran. 7. An alternative to this is to negotiate for poseeeeion of ’’Ko.lS Bungalo-** 1 and ol the surrounding territory for ourselves. A roujb plan is attached from ahi‘h it will be aaea that the building is in the near vicinity of the Anglo eroinn Oil Company oil installations and native residential quarters. At present my only entrance is through the middle of the ^nglo perrisn Oil Company settlement. It might, how over, be |)Oesiole to make a separate entrance from the road to the Oilfields, which runfc along the last side of the /Chasalieh compound at a distance of some two hundred y&amp;rdn from*?!©*16 ^ung&amp;low^ Ufciess this could be done and the necessary ground obtained for a private entrance and for the planting of ffi^ny trees, the building would be quite unsuitable aa a permanent residence for His Majesty’s Consular Officer. 8. on the assumption that the Anglo Persian oil Company would sell at all, ground could probably be made available for building office© between 'So.lS Bungalow*' and the Oilfield© road. Kha-salieh is, however, two miles from Ahwttt, and there would be difficulty in providing for an office staff resident in the town, in addition to the obvious inconvenience of having the office situated at each a distance from the various loverncaent Departments. 9. I am not in a position to estimate the possible cost of the land without discussing the matter with the Anglo ?er6ian Oil Company, nor do I know whether their concession allows the&gt;n to dispose of it. The seme applies to the price likely to be asked for ,f Ko.l6 Bun alow'. I do not think that any structural alterations would be /necesBory4 neoassary to r«nd«r tha ^hola ©uitaule for r®aidantial purposse, but a proper garage and new stables souid have to be provided. These and office premises oouid possibly be erected at e oust not exceeding three thousand pounds. 10. I consider this solution a very poor alternative to building or acquiring independent accomodation quite apart from the agio Persian Oil Company. The Consular Officer would be definitely less well housed th&amp;n the senior local representative of the Anglo Persian Oil Coy. as 'Bungalow IS* 1 and its surx'oundings are totally unattractive, no matter ho* muoh reconstructions ^©re oari*i©d out, whereas 'No*! Bungalow' is an imposing*looking block pleasantly situated on the river bank and not without architectural pretensions. 11* As stated in ny telegram of thi© morning, I am of the opinion thet the most dignified procedure, if th© Persian Government will not take the necessary steps to ensure that wc acquire the 'Sheikh's site' from Hadji vein on suitable conditions, would be to buy or lease as a temporary measure the bungalow at Koh&amp;naaerah which was formerly used by the Resident Bireotor of the Anglo Persian Oil Company a® proposed in sir Aobcrt Clive's despatch fto. 568 of Kovember 16th, 19£9, to the oreign Office. I believe that this bungaio** might ©till be obtained. So othe; one in Kohammerah would be suitable residence for the Consul (or Con&amp;ul Oenerei) either via a vis the Anglo Persian Oil Company or having in view the accomodation already provided for the Vice Consul at that post. It would then be necessary merely to p^cd k terre in Ahwa*, a course to which X beg with ail deference to submit that there in no insuperable objection. 1&amp;. Mr. Trott inforraB me th&amp;t the Foreign Office here approved the purchase of area A of the 'Sheikh's5 site' only. I would joint, out th&amp;t, according to a telegram No.89, addressed to you by the eoretary of State on September 3rd last, the Offloe of orke considered that ^rea A nil&amp;ht be euffioient. It had not at that time oesn decided definitely that it must suffice. I can only add to the ar^ments put forward by you subsequently, urging the necessity for acquiring at least Area S, thet the whole site i© and hae for smny years been one of the principal latrines in Ahwas. If the whole area is not ta^en ofer and celled in this nuisance will ine?itabiy continue, and, as already pointed out, Area 3 and area 0 are so small that it i&amp; possible that Hadji Moin will not be able to dispose of them separately. They will then remain waste ground and a definite menace© to health. I have the honour to be $ir Your KiOst obedient humble Servant Sgd.

Hla Majesty's OoTermeat have for a any years 'been trying to acquire a site at Ahwas on which to build a residence for His Majesty* s Consul for Khusistan* The only really suitable site is that next to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company*a Ho. 1 Bungalow* commonly called the 'Sheikh*s site'. This site* originally regarded as the property of the former Sheikh of Mohammerah was In 1932 recognised by the Sheikh to be the property of Haji Muin-ut-Tuj jar. In the course of protracted negotiations in that year the Haji expressed his willingness to part with the site (which ia about 30 f 000 Kara in extent) to Mis Majesty*s Government for IS rials a sar. This offer was submitted to His Majesty's Government but it was not until January 1933 that arrangements could be made to authorise His Majesty's Minister to close with this offer* subject to the production of a satisfactory title. It was stipulated that the purchase must be effected before the end of the financial year 1932-1933 (March 31st. 1933). It had always been recognised that the question Of the title would require careful examination once the prineipl of the purchase was decided upon and in the event the time available before the end of the financial year proved too short for this examination to be completed. This was due mainly to the fact that the Haji for the first time expressed doubts as to whether he could by the terms of the concession on which he held the land (known ux&gt;4. as he Hasseri concession of 1889) part any portion oiit to foreigners* The Persian Oovemment were accordingly asked for a legal opinion ana, if the opinion confirned the Haji's iapreaaion* for a special exception to be Bade in farour of Hia Majesty's Goyerm&amp;ent* The Persian Qovemffient, in reply, stated that they were not satisfied as to the Haji's title and t ought that by rights the land belonged to the Crown* It as then suggested that they might arrange for the money to be paid into a suspense account for the benefit of whoever was ultimately adjudged the rightful owner* This suggestion was in the nature of a forlorn hope, for time was getting short and in order that the arrangement should be legal it would be necessary to obtain the consent of the Haji, which was unlikely to be forthcoming* There was m added complic ation in the fact that two sets of house foundations on the site had been built with money advanced by the Sheikh of Mohammerah in virtue of an ancient agreement with the Government of India and that the Sheikh might be considered to have a moral, if not a legal, interest in these foundations* In spite of constant pressure the Ministry of Finance did not reply until noon on March 30th (which was a Thursday) that if His Majesty's Legation paid £4000 into the Treasury before 1-o-clock (when the Treasury closed for the day and of course for the following Friday) the Persian Government would undertake to account for this money at the rate of 12i rials a aar for as much of the site as His Majesty’s Goveriiment acquired, the remainder being returned* Ifcey added that the Persian Government wanted some of the site for themselves and that in the opinion of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs 30,000 cars was too large for a Consulate* 10,000 zara would probably be sufficient* The Haji was said to have agreed to this arrangement* This was pjssibla, as the 'iaji’s son had been warned some days previously that-5. that if Hia Majesty^ Oorevxment could not aequlro the aita hy March 31 at they would probably bo unabla to accja iro it at all. With an hour in which to aake up hi a aind f Hi a Majesty* a Minister, talcing into consideration the increase in price, the uncertainty aa to the aaount of land which sight be offered, the possibility that this amount might be far too ssall and the whole transaction therefore nullified, the undesirability of allowing the Persian aovemment to dictate how large the Consulate should be, or of reducing still further a site the size of which, aa sanctioned by Hia Majesty*a Government, was already smaller than he had recommended and than was in hie Judgement required by local conditions, the fact that he had nothing in writing and no assurance that the Majl really consented, ana finally the fact that the possible claim of the Sheikh of Mohammerah had not been dia osed of, decided that the deposit of £4,000 in the Persian rreaaury in such circumstances would not constitute a sufficiently definite payment for budgetary purposes in the United Kingdom. The position at the present time (April 1933) la therefore that no provision exists in the budget of the current financial year (1933-34) for the purchase or construction of a residence for His Majesty's Consul at Ahwa* and that during the current year no arrangement can be made, or at any rate carried t rough, for the provision of auch a reaidenoa. In the meanwhile His Majesty’s Consul, whose predecessors have in the past occupied various unsuitable buildings in the town of Ahwaa, is housed by the courtesy and hospitality of the Anglo-Per elan Oil Company, in a part of the hospital In their compound out side the town. He ia unmarried. In- 4 * In th«»e circuaatanoes Hia ^ajeaty’a Minister has again considered a suggestion* often nade be!ore* that th# Consulate for Khuaistan Might be »OYed to Moha)a»erah* an office and a pied-k-terre only being retained at Ahwas* The nain advantage of having the Consul at Ahwas is that this is the provincial centre and the headquarters of the Governor-General and of all heads of departments# (including* it is believed# in future# the Cue to as Departaent) that it is on the railway and that it is nearer the producing areas of Masjid-i-Suleiaan and haft Khel and so possibly acre convenient for the British subjects living at those two places. In favour of Mohaiamerah are the fact that it is a pleasanter place to live in and that the Consul would be more in touch with the world - both the world of hia own district and the world represented by the navy and British officials in the Gulf and in Iraq. To have the two British Consular Officers in Khusiatan residing at the same post would also be more economical and administratively convenient. On the balance of these considerations* it is undoubt edly preferable that the Consul should live at Ahwas* if a suitable residence can be found or provided. But on the other hand the objections to his living at Mohaaaerah are not insuperable# taking into account the facility of communication# especially telsphonic communication# between Ahwas and Mohamm- erah at most times of the year. The necessity of providing an adequate residence# whether at Ahwas or Mohammerah# is increased by the fact that His Majesty’s Government are at present considering a proposal to raise the Khusistan post to a Consulate-General* a step which the importance of British interests in the district, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Minister# amply justifies. The change-5. chance would in iteelf he eai arguaent for a transfer to Hohajaaerah as senior Officers would undouhtedly find Mohaaaerah the aore attractive residential post. In 1929 Sir R. Clive discussed with Mr. Jacks the possibility of buying or leasing a bungalow belonging to the Anglo-Pereian Oil Conpany in Mohaaiaeraht and he understood that a bungalow formerly occupied by Mr. Jacks could be made available. His Majesty’s Minister would be glad to know whether this bungalow is still available, either for sale or lease, on the assumption that a suitable site cannot be acquired in Ahwaa (and there seems little hope of this now), that His Majesty’s Government approve of the Consul or Consul- General living in Mohammerah and that the necessary financial provision can be made in the next financial year (1954-1935).British Leg TEHRAN No. 161» I 3 .

The Sovernor aeneral has asked me on two occasions recently what are the intentions of His Majesty's tovermaent with regard to building a Consulate in Afewas. It might cause both surprise and annoyance if iJr*at were virtually closed and the Consulate established at Mohacsasrah. I beg to submit that the remedy for this lias with the Persian Government which has been requested to ae&amp;ist Hie Majeety'a Government to obtain a suitable site for building proper premises. I infer from your telsgr&amp;» Ho.8 of the 24th instant th^t such aceistance is not forthcoming. If that be so, I do not aee that the authorities need be considered any further, if other eonsideratlorns point to the establishment of the Consulate elsewhere. The knowledge that such was tn® intention of Hi £ Majesty's Government might, however, induce those authorities to m&amp;kt the neceeaai 4 ;/ arrangements• 4. Further arguments in favour of the retention of Ahw&amp;?, are that it is on the railway; that it is nearer to the oil-producing areas; and that it is not quite eo near m Mohammerah to Anglo Persian Oil Conp&amp;oy local head-quarters. 5. The recent centralisation in Tehran of railway administrative affairs render it no ionjer so essential to keep in touch with the local railway authorities, who have no e&amp;y in the placing of contracts. It is underetaod that any foreign enginoere who m&amp;y be engaged for construc tional work will be bsteed in future on Sftleh&amp;bad, gome hundred miles away from ,hwa^. 6. proximity of the Consulate to the oilfields is a alight oonveniano© to the Anglo Persian oil Company.The marriage warrant for the cictriot, however, la held at wohivramer&amp;h and the birth aad death register® have always been kept there.

Should, however, the An^lo iersian Oil Com any for reasone of their own prefer that the Consulate should remain in Ahwfc»&gt; # the knowledge of ita proposed removal might induce therr^ to hand over ‘’Ko.l Uungftlow H or to assist Hie :’.ajeety f a Government in some other way to acquire suitable premises. I should particularly recommend that this argument be used strongly if there is any question of building being undertaken at Ahwat, which the Company ia apparently at present unwilling to undertake. 8. I am not yet in a position to judge of the advantage or otherwise of avoiding domination by the Anglo Persian oi.*. Company at Mohammerah, except the undoubted financial advantage to one’s puree. At present the General Manager at Abadan finds it convenient to discuss many of his affuirs with the /ice Consul there, occasionally telephoning to Ahwa^i. No occasion h&amp;r as yet arisen when I hove been requested^intervene with the authorities here. It seems quite probable that it might be an advantage, if such interventions were ueoeaeury, to be in cioeer personal touch with Abadan than it ie possible to be in Ahwaa* It ie an undoubted fact that the general policy of the Company, which should be a matter of close interest to the Consular Officer at this post, ia pr&amp;cticuAiy a. /sealedsaaled book eo lou rb ho rooelne et /hvna^, and it appears to be the daliberate aim of the Company that it should be iso. 9. The arguments Tor ^.ohaiamer&amp;h vereue Afewaf may be divided into thor.e of a personal nature and tho&amp;e of an administrative character, in fthich I include financial conaideratione. There ean b© no doubt whatever that Mohammerah is in itself a more attractive poet for a eenior official, though the summer climate of hw&amp;n ie said to be slightly more endurable. In vie* of the most welcome Ham adan summer recess arrangement this is no longer a factor which need b© taken into account. 10. From the administrative point of view, closer touch with iuh&amp;tt-el-Ar&amp;b problems, with Iraq frontier affairs, and with the Kev&amp;l Division in the Persian aulf could be maintained were the Consulate at J-ohaamerah. It would also add to the general efficiency of the post, ee well as to its amenities, to be in closer touch with the outer world than is possible at Ahwas. 11. Although an office would have to be maintained in Ahw&amp;*&gt;, the outlay necessary to provide a satisfactory residence for a senior Consular Officer would almost certainly be less at ohammerah th&amp;n at Ahw&amp;e, where no existing building is available. In Uohammerah on the other hand sites with gardens do exist sad probably a house could ^ be purchased. la. I would not advocate that any change should be made in the present Consular arrangements in Khu^istan unless the status of the superintending post is to be changed and unless the project of building a suitable reeidenoe is still no further advanced when a decision ie reached on this point. But I consider it highly desirable to come to some provisional understanding with the ; ngio Persian Oil Company in cane a house is needed at Mohemmerah /eitherc 535 Minute Paper. Department. A 1212 5C00 9.32 Col. Fowle has suggested (in the private correspondence on the file) that, in view of the importance of co-ordinated consular control in the Gulf (especially in the event of disturbance or anarchy in Persia), the consular officers in the Gulf area, including Ahwaz, should be placed under the superintendence of the Consul-General at Bushire. The elevation of the post of Consul, Ahwaz, to Consul-General would, of course, make Col. Fowle 1 s suggestion impossible. It is improbable, however, that the F.O. would^ever agree to the Ahwaz Consulate being placed under the superintendence of Bushire; some other method of co-ordination will have to be found. It is even more improbable that the F.O. would allow the question of co-ordination to influence their view that the Ahwaz post should be raised to a consulate-general. Mr. Hoare’s despatch seems to me to make out a strong case for this step. The important British interests centred round Ahwaz and Moharrmerah are undeniable: they are primarily British (as distinct - from Indian) interests, and, v/hile they belong partly to the Gulf area, they extend also to the interior. We shall hardly want to resist the case for a consul- general at Ahwaz, but the first step is to obtain the views of the G. of I., who will no doubt consult the Political Resident, Bushire. The abolition of the Consulate-General at Ispahan is desirable on grounds of economy, but the proposal that Ispahan should be incorporated in the Ahwaz Consulate will cut across another suggestion of coi./ 1212 5C00 9.32Col. Fowle's, viz ., that the Consul at Shiraz should be replaced by a consular agent (this would enable the j Consul-General, Bushire, to use the house at Shiraz for recess). It may be worth while to explore further the possibility, suggested by Col. Fowle, of abolishing the consular posts at both Ispahan and Shiraz, placing Ispahan under Tehran, instead of under Shiraz, and appointing | a consular&lt;agent only at Shiraz.

It will be seen that Mr.Hoare proposes, firstly, that on the retirement of His Majesty’s Consul-General at Isfahan, who is now on leave pending retirement, the post of Consul-General at Isfahan should be abolished, but that the Consular property should be retained on a 'care and maintenance' basis, under the supervision of His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz, in whose Consular district the present Consular district of Isfahan would be incorporated; and, secondly, that the Consular post at Ahwaz should be raised to the status of a Consulate-General - the Consul-General being assisted in the supervision of his district by the Vice-Consul from the Indian Political Service at Mohammerah. 3. As regards the first proposal, His Majesty’s Office of Works have concurred in the retention of the Consular property at The Under-Secretary of State, India Office.

BY AIR WlAjJ-at Isfahan on the basis suggested by Mr.Hoare, but add that, in view of the poor condition of the buildings and the annual outlay necessary to keep them in repair, they would prefer to dispose of the property in whole or in part, should the prospects of sale improve at some future date. Apart from the saving which will be made on the salary and allowances of the Consul-General at Isfahan, if his post is abolished, it will be possible to dispense with the existing provision for a salaried vice-consul at the post and there will be a saving of office expenditure at Isfahan, as the expenditure will be approximately as shown in Mr.Hoare ? s despatch No.24 of the 24th January last. 4. With regard to the second proposal, i.e. for raising the status of the post at Ahwaz, the extra expenditure involved which will be the difference between the salary and allowances of a consul and those of a consul-general, will be far more than covered by the saving contemplated by the disappearance of the Consul-General’s post at Isfahan, and the economies resulting from the absorption of that district in the district of His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz. 5. Sir John Simon warmly supports both proposals, and, while he is aware that Sir Samuel Hoare and the Government of India have not hitherto been in favour of raising the status of the post at Ahwaz from a Consulate to a Consulate-General, he strongly endorses the arguments used in Mr.Hoare’s despatch on this subject and earnestly trusts that they will now meet with acceptance. The agreement of His Majesty’s Treasury is being sought, and I am to express the hope that, subject to TheirTheir Lordships’ concurrence, Sir Samuel Hoare ’will agree to the adoption of the proposals put forward hy His Majesty’s Minister, which will result in a saving of public funds. 6.

Novemher 18th, 1932. I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, a copy of a despatch addressed to me by His Majesty's Consul-General at Isfahan in which he makes formal application for leave in May 1933 pending his retirement from the Consular service and enquires as to the arrangements which will be made for the continuance of the Consular post at Isfahan after his departure. 2. I trust that Mr.Bristow's application for leave, which has already formed the subject of unofficial correspondence with your department, will receive your favourable consideration. 3. Mr.Bristow has just paid a visit to Tehran, under my instructions, in order to discuss the future of the Consular post. As a result of these discussions I am satisfied that the retention of a Consulate-General is unnecessary and that it will even be possible to dispense with the appointment of a separate Consular officer. Mr.Bristow has confirmed my impression that although there is a not inconsiderable amount of routine work the post does not provide sufficient work of a responsible kind to fill the time of an active officer. 4. I am on the other hand unwilling to recommend the complete abolition of the post, as I recognise the force of the argument frequently brought forward that if circumstances were to lead to a loosening of the control now exercised from the capital the appointment of Consuls to many posts where their presence is now superfluous might again become necessary. 5. The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Office.5. In these circumstances a suitable solution would be the 4 appointment of an honorary Consul and Mr-Bristow has during the last few weeks sounded with my approval Mr.Moir, of Ziegler and Company, as to his willingness to accept the appointment, perhaps on some arrangement by which he would occupy and maintain the Consular property- Unfortunately, the affairs of Ziegler and Company are at present in so uncertain a state that Mr.Moir has been reluctantly forced to decline on the ground that he cannot give any guarantee that he will continue to reside in Isfahan even for a year or twe. As there is no other British subject both suitable and available for the position, I have been forced to abandon this line of enquiry. 6. The solution which I accordingly recommend is that the Consular district of Isfahan should be incorporated in the Consular district of Shiraz, but that the Consular property at Isfahan should be retained on what I may call a 'care and maintenance' basis. The combined districts should afford adequate scope for the activities of a Consul, who would be expected to pay three or four visits to Isfahan a year, while the cost of two separate consular establishments would not be excessive. 7. In making this recommendation, I am to some extent influenced by the fact that the prosoects of disposing of the Isfahan property are very small. It stands in what has now ceased to be a good residential quarter and there are in any case few inhabitants of the town, whether Persian or foreign, who could afford in the present hard times to buy or maintain a property of this size. A further consideration is that the municipality may wish to take a portion of the property for the purpose of widening(46^) widening the lane on the west side. The cost of re-building ^ the wall on that side would be fairly high and while His Majesty’s Government might be able to obtain compensation from the municipal ity, it is certain that no one else would have the slightest chance of doing so. No one is consequently in the least likely to buy the property while threatened with this expense. 8. I have also considered the possibility of disposing of a portion of the property. At present the only way in which this could be done would be to divide it from north to south (i.e., vertically) into two narrow strips, retaining the old Consulate offices, the main entrance and the bulk of the garden in the one and the main building and the stables in the other. The cost of making a second entrance and building a partition wall would, however, probably swallow up most of the money derived from the sale and the result would in any case be two properties neither of any great utility or convenience. If however the anticipated street-widening takes place, it will be possible to make a direct entrance into the northern part of the property and enable the southern part, consisting of the present entrance, offices and stables to be disposed of separately: this cannot be done at present because the lane to be widened will not take motors. The widening of this lane may in fact enhance the value of the property, which is an additional reason for not trying to dispose of it at the present time. 9. I anticipate that if my suggestion is adopted it will be necessary to retain the services of the Armenian clerk, two ghulams and one or even two gardeners. The clerk will be required to keep a general eye upon the property, to receive and forward to the Consul at Shiraz such documents as visa applications and to assist in the payment of the numerous Indo-European Telegraph Department4^ Department pensions. The ghulams will l&gt;e required for messages and as gate-keepers and watchmen, and two gardeners will be indispensable if the water supply is to be properly supervised and the property is not to lose its amenities and in consequence such value as it possesses. It will, in addition, be necessary to make provision for upkeep of roofs, walls etcetera and to make the Consul at Shiraz a standing travelling allowance of say Forty Pounds a year. The total cost, including the travel ling allowance, should be well under Three Hundred Pounds a year and compared to the present cost of the Consulate-General of some Two Thousand Five Hundred Pounds a year, this figure is, I submit, very low for the advantages to be gained. 10. I should mention here that I advocate the incorporation of Isfahan with Shiraz rather than the incorporation of Shiraz with,Isfahan because Shiraz is not only the more remote post, but the centre of greater potential political activity. It has also upon the whole the better climate and the Consular residence io smaller and therefore more convenient for an officer below the rank of Consul-General. Its main drawback is that the foreign community is somewhat restricted compared to Isfahan. 11. If the amalgamation takes place it will no longer be possible, in view of the Persian regulations, to call the Isfahan property a ’’Consulate-General' or 'Consulate”. It will have to be regarded as a Consular rest-house and the clerk either as a private person with no official status or else as a clerk of the Shiraz Consulate on detached duty. The position will be practically the same as that at Bandar Abbas as described in my despatch No.360 of August 20th last. 12. I venture to draw your attention to paragraph 3 of Mr.Bristow’s despatch and to request that he may be authorised toto inform the staff at an early date that those of them whom it may be necessary to discharge on his departure will receive compassionate gratuities on the scale authorised for the staff at Hamadan in your despatch No.232 of April 13th 1932. 13. I am asking Mr.Bristow to furnish me with an exact estimate of maintaining the property on the basis I have suggested above, including a travelling allowance for the Consul sufficient to enable him to make four journeys a year to Isfahan. 14. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 235), The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire (No.200), His Majesty’s Consul-General at Isfahan (No.35) and to the Acting British Consul at Shiraz (No.19).

Sir, In accordance withMr.Gye’s letter to me of the 20th August 1931 (K 8281/82/234) and my reply thereto of the 7th September 1931, I have the honour to request that I may be allowed to proceed on leave of absence about the beginning of May 1933. 2* As, in accordance withMr.Gye f s above mentioned letter I shall not be returning to Isfahan, I should be grateful if I may be informed as soon as possible what arrangements it is proposed to make in respect of the Consulate-General after my departure. Should there be any question of diminishing the native staff, I am anxious that they should be given as long notice as possible to enable them to seek other employment. 3. I should add that the subordinate staff of my Consulate- General consists of an Armenian clerk, Persian munshi, six ghulams and two gardeners. The clerk has been in the employ of the Consulate-General some fifteen years and the munshi ten years. Of the ghulams, three have been employed over twenty years, the remaining three between four and seven years and the gardeners at least twelve years, so if it should be necessary to discharge any of these I sincerely trust I may be authorised to give them some compensation.

Sir, 0 tv In his despatch No.311 of June 13th, 1931, Sir Robert Clive recommended, a s part of a general scheme for the reorganisation of Consular establishments in Persia that the post at Ah^az should be raised from a Consulate to a Consulate-General. I now have the honour, in accordance with your instructions, to state my reasons for holding the view, which I have expressed from time to time in private correspondence, that this recommendation of my predecessor should be adopted as soon as circumstances permit. 2. I should like at the outset to make it clear that when I speak of Ahwaz, I have in mind the whole Consular district of Khuzistan and Lurestan for which the Consul at Ahwaz is responsible. Except that it is the provincial centre of Khuzistan, Ahwaz has little to recommend it and the British interests in the town itself are not important. But the British interests in Khuzistan and indirectly in the adjoining regions of Luresten and Bakhtiari are, on the contrary, of great importance: and I am prepared to state that with the exception of Sistan, Ahwaz is the most important Consular post in Persia. 3. The outstanding British interest is naturally the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The presence of this company, with large numbers of British employees, both European and Indian, gives rise to a great deal of routine work The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc. , etc. , etc. , The Foreign Office.work - for the Vice-Consul at Mohammerah in respect of the refineries at Abadan and for the Consul at Ahwaz in respect of the producing areas at Masjid-i-Suleiman and Haft Khel. The amount of routine work is not however of primary importance. It is the general defence of the company’s interests that matters and as this is a point upon which misconcention is apt to arise I may be pardoned if I express my views with some exactitude. 4. It is often said, and is quite true up to a point, that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, like the Imperial Bank of Persia, are able to look after themselves and have little need of assistance from His Majesty’s Consular Officers. The Company certainly maintain their own ’’political 11 services and, in addition to the Resident Director in Tehran, are represented in Ahwaz by an official directly resnonsible to the General Manager at Abadan. This official is in close touch with the Governor-General of the Province and conducts most of the Company’s business without any assistance from the Consul. This self-dependence does not as a rule outlive serious trouble or the threat of serious trouble; recent instances have been the impossible situation which arose out of the orders given by the Minister of Finance on the occasion of his visit to Abadan in 1928 and the communist disorders of 1929. But the self-dependence of the Company in normal times is not the real point. I can easily envisage a situation arising in which the defence of the company’s interests might, through the weakness of the Persian Government (following, for instance, upon the death of the Shah), or even the active hostility of that Government, devolve upon His Majesty’s Government, not necessarily in the military sense but in the sense that the company’s political machinery would have no material uron which to grip, and the steps necessarycg5 V necessary to ensure that whatever authority controlled the province allowed their work to continue would have to be taken by the Consul. In that event it would be essential, for the sake of the company as well as for the sake of His Majesty’s Government (whose interests, superficially at any rate, might not be exactly identical) that the local representative of His Majesty’s Minister should possess, in addition to the personal qualifications which may be looked for in all members of a selected body like the Levant Service, considerable experience and the authority that only years and senior rank can bestow. 5. Apart, however, from the possibilities of trouble, I consider that it is desirable that His Majesty’s Minister should have in the Consular Officer at Ahwaz a representative of sufficient standing, not only to provide him with an independent view of the day to day policy pursued by the company, but also to intervene effectively if this policy seems at any point to be open to objection. I do not mean by thio that the company have not a perfect right to manage their own affairs or that the Consul should exercise more than the moral suasion that Consuls exercise elsewhere in regard to their compatriots. But the General Manager of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (though the present one is a youngish man) is an official wielding a great deal of power and authority, and generally speaking a Consular Officer must be a Consul-General to deal with him on equal terms. The Resident Director can of course sometimes help, but his position vis-a-vis the General Manager is somewhat delicate and the Legation should always be chary of asking him to intervene. 6. In another and more personal way the presence of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company makes it desirable that the seniorsenior Consular officer in Khuzistan should have the rank of a Consul-General. Even in these days of reduced expenditure the General Manager at Abadan and many of his departmental subordinates maintain a style of living and a standard of hospitality which most Consular officers, even when adequately housed, would find it difficult to emulate. All that can be said is that the contrast would be less marked on the salary and allowances of a Consul-General than on those of a Consul. I do not wish it to be inferred that I am in favour of anyone, whether General Manager or Consul, maintaining a lavish scale of living in days like these. I also fully realise that in many countries Consuls cannot compete with local merchant princes and are not expected to do so. I nevertheless maintain that while it may not matter in the Western world, say at Marseilles or New York, whether His Majesty’s Consul-General maintains a style of living comparable with that of the richer citizens, it does matter very much in Persia if the local Consul is seen to maintain a style inferior to that of the heads of the local British or foreign community. This is unhappily the case in Khuzistan and I submit that to rectify it by appointing a Consul-General and providing him with a proper house is no extravagance but a measure of policy called forth by the necessity of investing the local representative of His Majesty’s Government with the prestige and authority requisite to the office he holds. 7. The second great British interest in, or rather adjoining, Khuzistan is the Shatt-el-Arab. On account of the Treaty of Alliance with ’Iraq, the maintenance of a Royal Air Force garrison in that country and the proximity of the air route to India, this waterway is a link of vital importance in our Imperial communications^The Persian aspirations in regard to this waterway are well-known and so long as these aspirations remain unsatisfied the possibility of trouble must always be envisaged. I do not myself think that this trouble is likely to be of a physical kind, except for relatively trivial incidents, but in other ways, political and administrative, the Persian Government can keep their claim alive. If on the other hand these aspirations are partially met by the suggested Conservancy Board, I anticipate recourse to the local authorities will constantly be necessary in order to ensure that its work proceeds unhampered and that the British member and his assistants receive the assistance and. privileges to which the wording of the Convention will presumably entitle them. Prom my knowledge of Persian officials I think it unlikely that the Persian member will prove an effective intermediary with his own countrymen and the duty will fall upon the Consular officer. In short, the Shatt-el-Arab is and is likely to remain the most important politico-geographical problem in Anglo-Persian relations and constant vigilance will be necessary to ensure that our rights, or to be more precise those of ’Iraq, are not whittled away and that Persian encroachments are dealt with as speedily and effectively as possible. For this reason again it is desirable that His Majesty’s Minister should have a local representative of considerable experience and seniority. 8. A third duty of the Consul at Ahwaz is to watch the politics of the Bakhtiari, Lur and Arab tribesmen of his district. This duty is admittedly not so important as it was, but may at any time become so again. In particular I am of the opinion that the Bakhtiari tour should be kept up as far as circumstances, vidilicet the suspicionssuspicions of the Persian Government, permit, all the more so as the Bakhtiari Khans, who are admittedly accessible in Tehran, are every year getting more and more out of touch with the tribesmen, with whom it would be necessary to deal direct were there any question of a return to anarchy. 9. Other factors which increase the importance of the Consular district are the presence of eight thousand subjects of the Sheikh of Bahrein and the building of the port of Bander Shahpur and the Trans-Persian railway, which, whether it is ever finished or not, cannot fail to add somewhat to the importance of Khuzistan as a trade route. I should not, however, regard these factors as sufficient to justify by themselves the promotion of the post to a Consulate- General. 10. I have not so far made any reference to the Vice- Consul at Mohammerah, who should, I agree, continue to be an officer of the Indian service. In the preceding paragraphs I have assumed, as is indeed already formally the case, that the Vice-Consul is the local representative of his superintending officer and that it is the latter who is ultimately responsible for the conduct of Consular business at Mohammerah and Abadan as well as in the rest of Khuzistan. I do not say this with any intention of belittling the importance of the Vice-Consul, but he must in the nature of things be a junior officer and this makes it all the more desirable that the superintending officer should be more senior. The Vice-Consul is, in a way, in even greater need of an increased allowance than the Consul, for Mohammerah is much more of a social centre than Ahwaz; but as he is of junior rank he should not, in my opinion, feel himself called upon to entertain on a larger scale than his personal inclination prompts. I know that such a preceptis not easy to practice at a post where visitors, official, naval, and others, are fairly frequent, but I revert to this point below. 11. I am primarily concerned with the importance of the work in the district, rather than with its volume, and so far as the volume is concerned it appears that at present two officers are sufficient. At first sight it seems unnecessary that the two officers should live at separate posts. Mohammerah must be maintained because of the shipping and other routine work, but I have often thought that administrative convenience and economy could both be secured if Ahwaz could be abolished. Those who are in the best position to judge have, however, so far advised me that this is impossible. It is essential to keep in close touch with the Governor-General and the heads of departments at Ahwaz, and this could not apparently be done satisfactorily from Mohamraerah, even though the journey is only three to four hours in a motor car and the telephonic communication excellent. So long as this telephone service (run by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company) is available, however, it greatly facilitates the superintendence of one office from the other, should either officer be ill or absent on tour or recess. There is there fore no reason why either officer should be tied to his office chair. 12. But even though Ahwaz must be retained, I consider that if a Consul-General is appointed he should be a fairly frequent visitor to Mohammerah and upon certain occasions, such as the visits of His Majesty’s ships, should be in a position to dispense his own hospitality. InIn this way he would not only relieve the junior otficer of some of the financial 'burden that such entertaining entails, 'but also maintain closer touch with the British naval authorities in the Gulf, and meet more of ^he visitors, distinguished and undistinguished, who come fairly frequently to Mohammerah and Abadan, but less frequently to Ahwaz. The obstacle to this is the lack of anywhere to dispense such hospitality, at any rate when the Vice-Consul is married and needs the whole of the not very extensive Vice-Consulate for himself. But when the financial situation is less severe I consider that a scheme should be devised to give the Consul-General a pied-a-terre of his own at Mohammerah. 13. It is of course essential that the future incumbent, whether he is a Consul-General or a Consul, should be adequately housed. I know that this is fully realised by His Majesty's Government who are prepared and anxious to proceed with the building of a house so soon as the legal difficulties attending the purchase of what seems to be the only available site can be surmounted here. I only mention the point here because the Consul is at present housed through what amounts to the charity of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and this is not a position which I consider it desirable should continue indefinitely. In the meanwhile I acknowledge with gratitude the permission accorded for the use of the Vice-Consulate at Hamadan as a summer recess house for the Consul at Ahwaz. This should do much to preserve the health of future officers, who, if my recommendation is accepted, may be expected to be somewhat older men that they have been in the past. 14. I realise that my prooosai will mean that the cost of the post at Ahwaz will be increased by the difference between the salary and allowances of a Consul and those of a Consul-GeneralConsul-General. I trust that what I have written will be considered sufficient to justify this expenditure, but even from the financial point of view I venture to draw attention to the fact that considerable savings will be made by the practical abolition of the Consulate-General at Isfahan which I have also recommended and that there is now no senior Consular post available for the Levant service in Persia. 16. I am sending copies of this despatch to the foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No.44), His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad (No.20), the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire (No.37), and to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz (No.19).

I have the honour in continuation of my despatch No. 484 of November 18th last to transmit, herewith, a copy of a despatch addressed to me by His Majesty’s Consul-General at Isfahan. 2. It will be observed from the figures furnished by Mr® Bristow that if it is decided to retain the present Consulate-General buildings for the combined Isfahan-Shiraz Consulates the approximate annual cost of upkeep will be Rials twenty thousand, two hundred and sixty plus forty pounds subsistence allowance and forty pounds travelling allowance for the Consul, making a total of approximately tv* r o hundred and eighty pounds. 3. If, on the other hand, it is decided to dispose of the present Consulate-General it is possible that some Rials two hundred thousand will be obtained by the sale which would bring in an interest of some one hundred pounds a year. 4. If the present buildings are sold it will become necessary to rent a small rest house for .the Consul, the annual upkeep of which will be approximately as follows (a) Clerk. Rials 10 , 200 . (b) Rent. about Rials 6,500. (c) Ghulam. Rials 1,800. (a) 3uits. Rials 300. (e) No-ruz gratuities. Rials 200 . Rials 19,000 plus eighty pounds as above, making a total of about two The Right Honourable Sir John oimon G* C. S. I., etc. etc. , etc. FOREIGN OFFICE. f£270 two hundred and seventy pounds. 5. It will he observed that the annual saving effected ^ if the present buildings were sold and a rest house leased £110. would be in the neighbourhood of one hundred and ten pounds £10. (i.e. , ten pounds on annual uokeep and one hundred pounds £100. for interest), but in the circumstances I am of the opinion that it would be wiser to forego this small saving which is, in any case, dependent on the sale of the buildings at a good price, and I would prefer to continue to maintain the present Consulate-General buildings, at any rate, until the new^ road, wliich it is understood is contemplated by the local authorities, is built at the back of the Consulate- General when it should be possible to sell half the buildings for a better price than they w^ould command at the moment. 6 .

Sir, With reference to your despatch No.354/6-11 of the 18th ultimo. , asking for details on various matters with regard to this Consulate General, I have the honour to report as follows 1. Re price the property might fetch in the market: I have been offered seventeen thousand tomans for it and could probably obtain tomans eighteen thousand, but I am informed that tomans twenty five thousand is about the minimum that it ought to fetch. I do not think there would be any advantage in trying to sell the property in two parts, as it would be difficult to divide and the cost of a dividing wall would be very high. 2. I beg leave to submit the following estimate for the annual budget needed to maintain the property on a 'Care and maintenance' basis Per annum rials. Armenian clerk 10,200.- Two ghulams 3,600.- Two winter and 2 summer suits for above and overcoat every 2 years 600.- Two gardeners 2,460. - No Rooz gratuities 400.- Repairs to roofs &amp;c. 3,000.- Rials 20,260.- In addition there would presumably be the allowance of £1 per diem for the Shiraz Consul when absent from his post with a possible limit of £10 each quarter (l suggest this in case the Consul should decide to spend some weeks here during the summer when the climate here is generally preferable His Britannic Majesty’s Minister etc. etc. etc. British Legation, Tehran.Rls Rls. 1200 Rls* 500 Rls. 600 ir*^ preferable to that of Shiraz) as well as his travelling allowance. If the Consul did not use his own car the cost of a car for the return journey would he probably between One hundred to one hundred and twenty tomans. Should it be decided to seel the property, it would probably be possible to find a suitable ’’rest house” for fifty to sixty tomans a month. Should a smaller house be obtained it would, I think, be possible to dispense with the services of one ghulam and the two gardeners. I have made enquiries but can find no suitable .Snglishman to occupy the house and I would therefore suggest that the Armenian clerk shall live on the premises as well as the two ghulams. The question of the archives will depend on the decision as to keeping or selling the house - meanwhile I am destroying all such as can be destroyed in accord ance with Chapter XVI Annexes 2 &amp; 3 of the Consular Instructions. I should be grateful if I may be informed of any decision which may be reached in regard to the future of this Cotosulate General as soon as possible. I have, etc. (Sd. ) Ernest Bristow. H.M.
