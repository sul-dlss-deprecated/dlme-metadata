As desired by you 1 wired to Delhi asking for a priority passage for Mr. McConnell on the Westbound service of Thursday October 15th. I also telegraphed to Mr. Bowlby asking him to arrange hotel accommodation from Friday October 16th ( I ascertain ed from Mr. Reynolds that the reference in your letter to Saturday October 17th was probably a mistake for Friday October 16th). 3. I have now heard from the Government of India regretting that it is impossible to give a priority air passage to Mr.McConnel on October 15th as the aircraft has already been fully booked up. I have also received a telegram from Baghdad saying that accommo dation has been reserved for Mr.McConnell from Friday October 16th at the Sindbad Hotel. 4. On the last occasion when a report was received from Delhi that an aircraft was fully booked up with priority passages, the plane, when it arrived at Bahrain, was found to have no less than four vacant seats. In spite of the reply which I have received from the Government of India I think it by no means unlikely that Mr.McConnell may still be able to secure a seat on Thursday’s plane.
