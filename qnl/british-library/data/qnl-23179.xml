This is not correct. The facts are as follows:- The house has a permanent installation of 4 light points, one,in each of the three large rooms, (two on the first landing and one on the 2nd floor), and one in the varandah. In addition to this an extra shoe is fitted in each of the three rooms which gives the house ordinarily altogether 7 light points for use. Although i have fitted up extra connections in the two varan- dahs flanking my bed-room on the 2nd floor, and another on the stair-case leading to it, these extra connections are so fitted up with separate plugs for each am that only one point at a time can be used on the shoe available in ray bed-room. From one of the two rooms downstairs one of the shoes in used for an extension of 4 lights on the ground floor, one in the kitchen and one in each of the three small rooms which are occasionally used. From the above it will be observed that I am using three extra light points than what is allowed with the permanent fittings in the house. I have occupied the house since November last and I have been using the same points as indicated above through-out the 7 months of ray resi dence. Furthermore, I would like to mention that ray current bills will testify to the fact that my consumption has been kept down to the minimum. My highest bill for any one month has been under Rs.10/-. The fusing of the main switch at 10 a.m. on the 30th May, cannot be attributed to overloading in ray house. In fact ray lights and fans were not in use at the time the incident occurred. I shall be glad if ys an inspection could be arranged in order that I may be cleared of the charge of overloading, and the current restored as early as possible.
