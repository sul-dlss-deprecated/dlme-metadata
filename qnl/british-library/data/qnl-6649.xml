SECRET. h'rom Secretary of State to \ iceroy, Army Department. \)th January 19.17. \ Secret. No. ‘&gt;431. South Persia. See telegram from Commander-in-Chief, fndia, to Chief of Imperial Geueral Staff, No. 203. War Cabinet have con sidered whole situation, and are of opinion that as operations round Shiraz have now assumed a distinctly military character, it will probably be necessary that Sykes’s force, including South Persian Rilles, should be replaced under Government of India and command exercised by a military officer appointed by you. War Cabinet therefore wish for an appreciation from you of the situation as likely to develop in next few months, and of the best means of dealing with it. In particular do you advise : — (1) Occupation from Bush ire of the plain country between Bushire and Daliki for at any rate some months on the understanding that troops are not to commit themselves to an advance into the hills. (2) Reinforcement of Shiraz from Lingah or Bunder Abbas ? (3) If so, what troops would be required in either case, and can you supply them ? Jf you can, what effect will this have on your other military commitments ? (4) To ensure proper co-ordination between forces at Shiraz and Bushire do you think it desirable that both forces should be under your control ? (5) What are your views as to Sykes’s position and functions under suggested arrangement ? (C) Have you any other suggestions ? It will, of course, be understood that in all questions of policy regarding Persia, Government of India will be guided by ilis Majesty’s Minister, Teheran, consulting him as well as me and keeping us fully informed. Please repeat to Teheran, Commander-in-Chief’s telegram 203, this telegram, and all subsequent telegrams on this subject emanating from you. From Viceroy, A rmy Department, 2lst January 1917. 940. Tour telegram of the 9th January, 3431. The concrete facts before us are (1) from all information it appears that Turks in vicinity of Baghdad will be materially strengthened at an early date, possibly by as much as four divisions ; (2) the unrest in Southern Persia may be ascribed to German and Turkish influence among the local tribesmen. From these two facts it is probable that enemy have not lost sight of their aim to push bodies of troops towards Afghanistan with a view to induce Amir to take sides against us. To accomplish their ambitions the Turks may intend (1) to endeavour to overwhelm Maude at Ivut-al-Amarah; (2) to await advent of floods and the hot weather to pin him to his present position with sufficient troops whilst utilising bulk of their forces for a movement through Persia, which in view of Russian menace to their communications, should the Turks advance rid Teheran, is likely to follow a south-eastern direction via Ispahan. Climatic conditions favour attack on Maude being undertaken during the cold weather; the movement through Persia is preferably a hot weather operation. The development of Shiraz situation must therefore depend on success or failure of plan as above outlined. Bo long as we maintain our present position on the Tigris enemy’s plans in Persia are impeded, their eastward move checked, and the arrival of organised enemy forces in South Persia improbable. The features of present situation at Shiraz appear to be: the attack on Kazerun was primarily directed against work of Governor Farman Farina who is known to be our friend The tribal forces engaged were robber bands instigated by German agent Wasmuss and unchecked by Soulet, but they apparently permit caravans and individuals to move up and down Bushire-Shiraz road on payment of tolls. ilS 367T force under the Commander-in-Chief in India who would nominate a experienced General Officer to exercise command and be the supreme Britn! authority under Field Service Regulations, Part 2, Chapter 3, Section 8 u to the borders of Baluchistan. His authority must be supreme in ah matters subject to instructions received from Government of India \\' instructions will be issued by Government of India under the orders /f Home Government, and after reference when necessary to the Minister nt Teheran, who will thus have opportunity of guiding policy to be followed He must be tree to act according to need of situation, in judging which L* will have the advice of his local Political Officers, and in matters beyond their competence that of Minister at Teheran.

War Cabinet have again had question under consideration, especially with relerence to the two above-mentioned telegrams. h rom such information as is in their possession they are not at present convinced that there is grave or imminent danger of any strong Turkish advance into the interior of Persia whereby situation in Pars would he seriously compromised in the near future. They realise, however, that it is desirable that the position of the South Persian Rifles at Shiraz should be rendered more secure. For this purpose the Government of India have been instructed to send immediately the reinforcements mentioned in the last paragraph of Viceroy’s telegram, which will number approximately 1,000 men together with the 10 officers and .03 Fmtish instructors, provided that 1 . b) kes desires and has asked for the latter for the trainintr of the South Persian Rifles. As regards the position of Sir P. Sykes, War Cabinet feel great hesitation in superseding him by a General of the active Army: in the first place he is an officer with very exceptional knowledge of Persia, he is persona yralissitna to the Governor-General of Furs and to Persians generally, while such a change would affect Sir P. Sykes’ personal position so injuriously that it is hardly likely that he would consent to remain as Chief Political Officer to the General in question ; and, secondly, such an appointment might, they feel, give to the South Persian Rifles, and. indeed, the whole situation, a military appearance, which might justly excite the suspicions of the Persian Government and constitute a perhaps inconvenient precedent for similar action elsewhere. The above might perhaps hold good were we to insist on the appointment of a General even nominally under Persian control. 1 should be glad to know your views upon preceding considerations. Note. —Similar telegram addressed by Foreign Office to Sir C. Marling, Tehran, as No. 35 of 29th January 1917. From Viceroy, Army Department, tSlh February 1917. {Repeated to Tehran.) 1765. Please see your telegram 3430 of 30th January, and Mailing s 13 of 31st January 1917, to Foreign Office, London. Whilst agreeing that there is at present no imminent danger of a hostile advance through Persia, we made our proposals with a view to safeguarding ourselves in the most efficient manner against the possibility of such a movement. At the same time, in your 3431. you stated that the War Cabinet were of opinion that operations around Shiraz had assumed a military character. We agree in this view, which is fully confirmed by current events. On the suggestion of the War Cabinet, we proposed the command being exercised by a military officer appointed by us who, in view of the responsibility involved, should undoubtedly hold General’s rank.We recognise Sykes political qualifications, and \vv consider that hr conducted his mission successfully up to the date of his arrival at Shiraz. But, having regard to present circumstances, we think that his military knowledge is not sufficient to enable us to roly upon him to deal adequately with the local military situation. We must add as regards organisation of the South Persian Rifles, which in our opinion is the most important factor in the maintenance of our position in Southern Persia, Sykes has shown a lack of organising capacity which prevents us from proposing his retention. We recognised that Sykes might not like the position of Chief Political Officer, and it was for this reason that we suggested (rough as his successor. We agree that Persian susceptibilities should be disturbed as little as possible, but we feel strongly that the necessities of the military position are paramount, and that we require a free hand to control this force for which we are now paying, and which is intended for the protection of Persian interests and the maintenance of Persian authority. As this force is dependent on India for reinforcements, supplies, and munitions, dual control seems to us unavoidable unless we also control its operations, and in our 940 of 20th January we emphasised the importance of avoiding anything in the nature of dual control. t i</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000164_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/C166</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000164</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/C166</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Telegrams Relating to the South Persia Rifles</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1917/1917</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-11-02T21:01:16</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (2 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at f 110, and terminates at f 111, as it is part of a larger physical volume; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.

It consists of the following telegrams:Secretary of State for India [Joseph Austen Chamberlain] to the Viceroy of India [Frederic John Napier Thesiger], 9 January 1917;Viceroy of India to the Secretary of State for India, 21 January 1917;Secretary of State for India to the Viceroy of India, 25 January 1917;Secretary of State for India to the Viceroy of India, 30 January 1917;Viceroy of India to the Secretary of State for India and repeated to the British Minister at Tehran [Sir Charles Murray Marling], 6 February 1917.The telegrams are primarily concerned with how and by whom the South Persian Rifles should be controlled. In his telegram of 9 January 1917, the Secretary of State for India informs the Viceroy that the War Cabinet, having concluded that operations around Shiraz have assumed a military character, is of the opinion that the forces commanded by Sir Percy Sykes, including the South Persian Rifles, should be placed under the control of the Government of India.The Viceroy, in his telegram dated 21 January 1917, advises that the force be placed under the control of the Commander-in-Chief in India, who would nominate an experienced General to exercise command. The Viceroy suggests that the Commander-in-Chief's authority would be subject to instructions received from the Government of India, under the orders of the Home Government (and after reference, when necessary, to the British Minister at Teheran [Tehran]).In the telegram dated 30 January 1917, the Secretary of State for India states that the War Cabinet is reluctant to supersede Sykes, on the grounds that he is an officer with exceptional knowledge of Persia. The Viceroy's telegram of 6 February 1917, whilst recognising Sykes's political qualifications, questions his military knowledge.Other, more immediate matters relating to the South Persian Rifles are also discussed, including co-ordination between forces at Shiraz and Bushire, and the reinforcement of Sykes's troops at Shiraz.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>South Persia Rifles</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>War Cabinet</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Percy Molesworth Sykes</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>First World War (1914-1918)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Armed forces</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000164#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
