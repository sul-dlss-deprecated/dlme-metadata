Fort William, the 24th March 1910. My Lord, We have the honour to address your Lordship on the subject of the emoluments of Captain M. F. White, lately Mobile Assistant to the Chief Quarantine Officer in the Persian Gulf. 2. The appointment of Mobile Assistant, at an annual cost of £560, was sanctioned in your Lordship’s telegram dated the 7th November 1907. Captain White was selected for the post, his emoluments being fixed at Rs. 500 a month pay, and a local allowance of Rs. 200 a month. 3. The emoluments of the appointment being thus restricted to Rs. 700 a month, the incumbent was not entitled to receive any further allowance which would have the effect of raising them above the fixed limit. Owing, however, to a misunderstanding, the pay of Rs. 500 a month was regarded both by Captain White and by the audit officer as the initial pay of an Agency Surgeon of the 2nd class, which rises according to rank and carries exchange compensation allowance; and accordingly, with effect from the date of ms appointment, Captain White drew exchange compensation allowance, an trom rt r the 1st February 1909 to the 13th June XOTTpay at the enhanced rate of Rs. 550 aTnonth, to which he would have been entitled in the ordinary line as a Captain of over five years’ service holding an appointment of Agency Surgeon of the 2nd class. The total sum thus overdrawn amounts to Rs. 709-3-5.* 4.

In reply I am to state that the Board are ad vised that although from the point of view of the protection of Persia itself against Plague, there would he more advantage in the Clayton apparatus be ing placed at Mohamrnerah than at Bushire, yet, in view of the considerations advanced in Mr. Marling's telegram of the 22nd instant, it seems to the Board advisable The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.advisable that the apparatus should, as suggests, be. placed at Bushire.

No.7 Commercial, dated June 22nd, 190s. I have received your telegram of the 13th instant. It has always been expected by the Council that the Clayton apparatus would be placed at Bushlre. I think, however, that, if the unsuitableness of other Persian ports were made clear to them, they might be Induced to agree to its being established at Mohammerah. Any proposal of the kind would, however, prob ably lead to a discussion of the question of a sen tinel station. If it is considered desirable that such discussion should be avoided. It would be ad visable that the apparatus should, at all events for the present, be placed at Bush ire: it might be dif ficult to control the course of discussion in view of the absence of the French President and the other French members of the Council. Should it be decided that the apparatus is to be sent to Mohammerah I should be glad if I might beso Informed at an early date In order that I may have time to prepare the Persian members.

Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. . . r . eferenc e to Foreign Department telegram No. S.—530, and British Minister at Tehran s telegram of 18th. Firstly, Williams supports recommendations for portable stove for Mobile Assistant. Secondly, as regards journey to Bombay, he thinks it would be preferable to await arrival of Mobile Assistant. Thirdly, as regards Bahrein, Prideaux and Williams consider that the present medical practitioner is fully competent to supervise stove work and. quarantine arrangements generally, and that appointment of another Assistant Surgeon to Bahrein is unnecessary and likely to cause friction. Although .present man is a native, he is ol superior class and his diplomas good, and it does not seem that in Bahrein the question of nationality is so important. Could not Assistant Surgeon designated for Bahrein be sent to Bushire, where he would constitute second Assistant Surgeon recommended in my telegram, dated 11th September, Shiraz, No. 42, in modification of Sanitary Council’s recommendations reported in Legation’s telegram of 6th September last, No. 116, which advised three Assistant Surgeons for Bushire ? Fourthly, Williams thinks that Bunder Abbas will prove most central spot for eventual head-quarters of Mobile Officer and presence of Indian Medical Service Officer there would also be convenient to us for other reasons, but this is a point which I think might be left to arrange direct with Sanitary Council. Fifthly, it seems likely that there will be considerable savings in expenditure as at present estimated. Pending receipt of views of Government of India on above, I am not repeating to Tehran.

I am. Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant,copy. Immediate. 3 A FOREIGN OFFICE, October 16th, 190?. Sir I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to state, for the information of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, that his attention has been from time to time called to the desirability of im proving the quarantine arrangements in the Persian Gulf. The special position held by this country in the Persian Gulf has recently been emphasized in connec tion v/ith the Anglo-Russian Agreements and Sir E.Grey agrees with the Secretary of State for India, with whom he has been in correspondence, that no effort should be spared to maintain the status* quo in those waters. Since the British authorities were intrusted by the Persian Government with the sanitary service in 1896 foreign shipping in the Gulf has increased, and His The Secretary to the Treasury.Hie Majesty's Minister at Tehran reports that frequent attempts have lately been made by the representatives of other Powers to influence the Sanitary Council at Tehran against a continuance of the existing system. He points out that a large measure of political and conmercial control naturally follows from the control of sanitary measures and that the Influence and prestige enjoyed by European doctors in Persia are hardly in ferior to those of Political Agents. In Sir C. Spring- Ice's opinion a general attack on the British Sanitary Service in the Gulf Ports is not unlikely in the near future, and an improvement in the efficiency of the service would be a powerful argument in favour of the maintenance of the present system. The outbreak of plague at Bahrein a few months ago brought into notice the deficiency in the disinfecting equipment of the southern ports, but it is out of the question to expect the Persian Government either to im- P ve the se.vice themselves or to pay for its improve ment at the hands of British medical officers. The only alternative therefore is that the service shouldbe strengthened end rendered more efficient at the joint expense of His Majesty's Government and the Government of India, unless the quarantine service of Persia is to pass into the hands of an International body on which British shipping Interests would be able to exercise an utterly inadequate influence and which would certainly be swayed by political motives rather than by legitimate considerations based on re quirements of public health. The Government of India are willing to bear half the cost of the requisite arrangements, provided that His Majesty's Government will defray the other half. As will be seen by reference to the accompanying copy of a letter from the India Office, the Government of India estimate that the cost of the most pressing requirements will amount to £2,250 initial cost and £1,101 recurring. This represents the minimum of what is necessary and Sir E. Grey trusts that in view of the important political considerations in volved Their Lordships will sanction half the total sum involved or £1,125 initial cost and £550.10.0 recurring&gt; recurring, being defrayed from Imperial funds and in cluded in the annual statement of the expenditure which is shared equally between the two Governments.

AUSTRIAN Delegate on Sanitary Council, after consulting German Minister, is sending proposal to his Government for establishment of International Sanitary Council at Bushire under presidency of British officer. He points out Behrein ought to have sanitary appliances at once (see p. 77 Faivres Report).

[ 29485 ] No. 1. (No. 177.) Sir, Gulahek, August 12 , 1907. WITH reference to my despatch No. 156 of the 16th ultimo, on the subject of the proposed improvements in the quarantine service in the Gulf, I have the honour to inform you that 1 called M. de Hartwig’s attention, in a private and friendly con versation, to the attitude adopted in the Committee of the Sanitary Council towards the proposal. I said that Dr. Schneider had pointed out that improvements were necessary, and that, as the Persian Government would be obviously unable to meet the necessary expenditure, the British Government, which was mainly interested in navigation in the Gulf, and whose officials were charged with the direction of sanitary measures, should itself provide the means for the proposed improvements. The Russian doctor, however, had taken a line which seemed to indicate that the proposals made were of a political character, and had himself suggested that the Belgian Customs officials should take a more active part in the Quarantine Administration. I added that the object of the British Government in giving a favourable consideration to Dr. Schneider’s proposals had nothing to do with politics, and that they desired to maintain the status quo in the Persian Gulf, a desire which I understood to be shared by M. Isvolsky. M. de Hartwig informed me that he was not conversant with the question, which he did not himself understand (the matter is, I believe, left in M. Passek’s hands). He entirely shared my desire that no question of a political nature should be raised in the Sanitary Council. As the outbreak of plague was now at an end, it would, he thought, be advisable to let the matter drop, and we accordingly agreed to instruct our Delegates not to raise the question in the Council. I spoke to the President, who informed me that the Special Committee had gone far beyond the very modest programme which he had himselt submitted, in concert with Dr. Williams, the Englishman charged with the supervision of quarantine in the Gulf; that he preferred not to bring the Report of the Committee before the Council, but Govi had approached Persian Government would provide the necessary funds; this, he said, they were unable to do. He therefore advised that a scheme of smaller scope should be drawn up. The matter was then dropped without any discussion, and without the Report of the Committee having been read. I understand from him and the French Minister that the Russian Minister has complained of his attitude as being “ too English. M. de Hartwig seemed to regard the proposals as designed to increase English influence in the Gulf, and to be unacceptable to Russia. Dr. Eriestmantel, the Austrian Delegate, pointed out to me that he was himself responsible for the extended programme of reforms. His object was to provide against the danger to Europe which would result as soon as railway communication between Anatolia and the Gulf was completed. He had been much struck by the violent anti-English tone of the communications of the Russian doctor, who imported political animus into the discussions which created a painful impression among h colleagues. He quite understood that the object of my Government in entertaining Dr. Schneider’s proposals had been purely philanthropic, but he agreed that for the present it would be perhaps better to allow the subject to drop. He suggested, however, that the British Government should provide stoves for Bunder Abbas and Mohammerah as well as for Bahrein, in which latter place they no doubt could do what they waute without fear of interferenc e.

Mr. Secretary Morley is aware from Sir C. Spring Rice's telegram of the 27th ultimo, that the Russian Minister at Tehran has denied that this step was taken with his knowledge and that he has promised that no similar incident shall occur in the future. Sir E. Grey is of opinion that, as His Majesty's Government Under Secretary of State India Office.h Government have already intimated to the Russian Gov- ernment that they propose themselves to make such im provements in the sanitary service as are indispensable It le inadvisable to allow the matter to drop as sug gested by Sir C. Spring Rice. Sir E. Grey considers that, so soon as the ques tion of the cost of these improvements has been settled in consultation with the Government of India, who have already been asked to furnish an estimate of the expenditure which will be necessary for the pur pose, it will be time to proceed gradually to intro duce those reforms which are indispensable with a view to deal with any outbreak of plague which may occur In the future.

President of Sanitary Council promises to send a model list of recommendations to Persian Government, which will take no action for want of funds. In view of strong Russian opposition and suspicion, he thinks matter had better be allowed to drop, especially as plague has now ceased and quarantine suppressed. I concur. We might eventually provide two stoves, but matter had better rest for the moment. (Addressed to Foreign Office ; sent to India, Bushire).The question or Introducing certain Improvements Into the quarantine arrangements in Southern Persia has been raised by the Sanitary Council at Tehran. His Majesty s Covernroent, to vifaom the control Oi these arrangements was confided by the request of the Persian Government,h&amp;ve been considering this question for some time past and propose themselves to make such improvements In the service as are Indis pensable to its greater efficiency. His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran reports that at a recent meeting of the Sanitary Council the Russian Doctor proposed that the Sanitary Service should be carried on In collaboration with the Customs administrationadministration. He also proposed that the French Doctor Oj. the Russian Consulate at Bushire should he appointed Inspector General of Quarantine. His Majesty's Government desire to point out to the Russian Government that they consider the present quarantine arrangements as one of their special interests in the Persian Gulf and a part of the status quo. Monsieur Izvolsky in an aide- memoire recently conmunicated to Sir A. Nicolson stated that the Russian Government do not deny the special interests of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf region. His Majesty's Government therefore trust that the Russian Government will send instruc tions to the Russian Doctor to refrain from opposingthe continuance of the present arrangements., should the question again come before the Council.
