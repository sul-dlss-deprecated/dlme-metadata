From G eneral S ir JOHN ECCLES NIXON, K.C.B., Commanding Force ' To T he CHIEF of the GENERAL STAFF, SIMLA. Sir, I have the honour to forward for the information of the Government of India, the accompanying despatches from Major-General C. I. Fry, regarding the fighting at Shaiba on the 12th April, and from Major-General C. J. Melliss, V.C., C.B., regarding the action at Shaiba on the 13th, followed by the defeat of the Turkish forces on the 14th at the battle of Barjisiyah. 2. The Shaiba garrison on the 11th April I9 I 5&gt; consisted of the troops named in the margin, the whole under the command of Major-General Fry. The defensive perimeter, in which this force was camped, extended over 3J miles. During the flood season from February to June, water, varying in depth from one to four feet, lies between Basrah and the further shore, and two methods of approach are in use across this lagoon, one by wading across 6 miles and landing 6th Division. 16th Brigade.

This latter line of approach passes through nearly 8 miles of water, and is traversed transversely by a creek too deep to wade. 3. I took over command of this Force on the 9th April at Basrah from Lieutenant-General Sir A. A. Barrett, K.C.B., K C.V.O., who was granted leave on the 10th by His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief owing to ill health. The same morning, about daybreak, a party of the horsemen reconnoitred close to Shaiba, but retired before our cavalry. S85oGSBa On the nth it was reported that the enemy's cavalry had occupied Barjisiyah wood, and that some 4,000 infantry were moving into'Shwebda ; later in the day Major-General Fry, who had succeeded to the command of the 6th Division, reported that he considered them to be the advanced guard of the enemy's main forces, and that a serious engagement was probable within the next day or two. I ordered the 30th Brigade, reinforced by the 30th Mountain Battery, under the command of Major-General Melliss, V.C., CB, to move lo Shaiba the following morning, and since he, as senior officer, would command all the forces there, I placed at his disposal the staff of the 6th Division and ordered them to proceed to Shaiba with him. 4. At about 7 30 a.m. on the 12th, General Fry reported that he was attack ed from the south in force, and at 11 -20 a.m. that he was confident of being able to resist all attacks but was unable to prevent the occupation of Old Basrah by the enemy. Meanwhile, General Melliss' Brigade, having marched from Makina Masus, commenced its crossing about 9 a.m. The water was high and the enemy disclosed guns and infantry near Old Basrah ; at about 10 a M. General Fry sent word to say that the enemy were in force betv/een Shaiba and Old Basrah, and that he could not spare more than two battalions to co-operate with General Melliss' Brigade. As, owing to the distance, I was unable to cover with guns the crossing of General Melliss' Brigade, and, moreover, as he could make no use in the water of the Mountain Battery which accompanied him, i ordered him to return after he had accomplished about one third of the journey, and to cross by 14 bellum ' by the second route. The boatmen refused to assist and only about 80 ' bellums' were available • therefore ordered men of the 20th Punjabis, who readily came forward to punt them. By about 4 p.m. General Melliss, accompanied by the Staff of' the 6th Dmsion and most of the 24th Punjabis, started and got successfully across to bhaiba that evening by about 10-30 p.m. During the return journey these . bellums were attacked by the enemy in some force. These were the only reinforcements which I found it possible to send bv the evening of the 14th. The enemy in 'bellums' were in considerable force in the lagoon on the route taken on the 13th, and it was therefore necessary to organise better protection for the next day in the shape of a special guard with mountain guns placed on ,, bellum ' rafts. This convoy got across on the 14th with gun ammunition and the remainder of the 24th Punjabis and the arranae- ments made would have allowed this convoy to be continued daily. s. The actions themselves are described by the Commanders, and I will now pass on to the part played by the Euphrates Blockade Flotilla, consisting of armed launches, small steamers and gun barges on which were mounted Two tJn' f-'n e !i 3 ' pr | NaVal guns ' one 5' B. L. and one tS-pr. IT, r. ^ ' under 'hf command of Lieutenant-Colonel R. P. M esworth, R.G.A., was enabled to do good service, aided as it was by the uaole assistance of Lieutenant A. G. Seymour, R.N., HMS ' Esoieele ' officers and men of the Royal Navy on this station • • sp egle, When the fighting commenced round Shaiba on the 12th. this Flotilla was operating off Nakhailah intercepting supplies, which were coming to the enemv across the water in 'mahailas' (country boats of from 30 to 80 tons burthen). Bariisivah^oif thf&gt; C °y lmancl!n g tf I e M B ' 0 L c, ! 1 a&lt; | e ' ha ving observed the action of J J c j | the ^th, approached Nakhailah early on the morning of the icrh chase an^pursuedThe' 1 'k ^ ^ in era' at ga^e a heavv tale on ill f n to . Rat ? w \ rfes t&gt;;oy.ng8 and capturing 4 large 'mahailas'; a neavy gale on the following day forced him to lie to. On the ly.h he reached Chubashiah but found it entirelv desertpd Thp enemy were seen retiring in scattered groups across the desert, and though he fired ...a few rounds at them, they offered no target. Ii would appear, from subsequent information, that, during their retreat, the enemy were harassed and robbed by their former allies, the Arabs, and that they fled across the desert in wi'd confu sion, scarcely halting until they reached Kamsieh, a distance of close on 90 miles from the scene of their defeat, so thoroughly disorganised were they. It is now known that Suleiman Askeri, the Turkish Commander, shot him self at Nakhailah after assembling his officers and denouncing the faithlessness of the Arabs, A lar.ge quantity of ammunition, both gun and rifle, was captured upon the battlefield at Barjisivah and subsequently at Nakhailah ; this was either brought in or destroyed on the spot. The total in round numbers amounts to some— 1,500 shell—4 , 5' / ; 15-pr. and Mountain gun. 400—: 00,000 rounds S. A. A, 3,000 hand grenades, some boxes of lyddite and a number of bnnbs, fuzes and primers. 6. I cannot speak too highly of the steadiness, spirit and pluck shown bv the troops in th^se actions, nor of the able manner in which they were handled by their Commanders. In the battle of Barjisiyah our troops had to attack over open ground a superior force of the enemy, skilfully entrenched and concealed, on a front of over 3 miles. The Turkish troops showed themselves well trained and exhibited teracity and courage ; while their musketry and machine gun fire were remarkably effective. In drivirg such an enemy from his position by a bayonet charge, after a steady advance in the face of a hot fire, the British force performed a feat of which any troops might be proud. 7. The races, from which the portion of the Southern Army engaged here are drawn, have shown, in the stiffest fight which has fallen to their lot for years, a steadfastness and gallantry worthy of all praise. Mahrattas,, Dekhani Mahomedans, men from Rajputana i Gujars and Mers have earned for themselves in these operations a proud renutaticn. They vied xuth their British comrades in this field, the Royal Artillery—the Norfolks—the Dorsets, in spirit and resolution, and have added lustre to their former traditions. 8. Major-General I'ry, under whose orders the defences of Shaiba had been organised, made a very successful defence against the enemy's constant attacks for the first 24 hours, during which the enemy suffered heavy losses and were everywhere repulsed. 9 I would specially bring to notice the services of Major-General C. J. Melliss, V. C., C. B., who ar once seized the opportunity of taking the offensive and, after driving the enemy from the vicinuy of Shaiba on the 13th April, followed up this success the next day by attacking the Turkish forces in the strong position to which they had retired. The determination and skill with which he handled his troops on the 14th April resulted in the complete defeat of the enemy after a very hard fought action, and I fully endorse his recommendation that Barjisiyah be commemorated as a battle honour for tne corps engaged. 10. I entirely agree with the recommendations made by Major-Generals Fry and Melliss in the Despatches I am now forwarding and I will only add remarks with regard to the following officers :— Brigadier-General W. S. Delamain, C. D. S. O.—This officer has con sistently distinguished himself in command of his Brigade throughout the cam- paign, and has shown marked ability as a Commander.4 Colonel R. N. Gamble, D S. O., General Staff Officer^ 6th Division, was Senior Officer to Major-General Meiliss, who speaks most warmly of the services he rendered throughout the hard-fought and successful operations of the 13th and i4th April. J would also add that his thorough knowledge of the locality; of the troops, and of earlier operations has been of the greatest assis tance to me. Lieutenant-Colonel E. Cleeve, Royal Field Artillery. —This officer has shown himself an exceptionally able Artillery Commander, who, until disabled by a wound on the 14th April, handled his guns, not only to the admiration of his own side, but also to that of the officer commanding the opposing artillery, That Turkish officer, when taken prisoner, particularly requested that he might be presented to the officer who had directed the fire of the British guns, as ( ur artillery fire, he said, had silenced the Turkish batteries in rapid succession in a way that he would not have considered possible. 11. In addition 1 wish to mention the following who prominently came to my notice, and who were not under the orders of either Major-General Fry or Major- General Meiliss. Major-General G. F. Gorringe, C. B., C. M. G , D. S. 0.—In addition to the command of his own Division, he ably commanded the local defence troops and also undertook the temporary organization of the Communicaiions and Base. His experience of river expeditions rendered him most valuable in arranging the despatch of troops and supplies across the lagoon between Basrah and Shaiba. Lieutenant-Colcnel R. P. Molesivorth, R. A., for some weeks commanded the Euphrates Blockade FlotiHa. which, with the aid of the Royal Navy, often under extremely arduous and hazardous conditions, did excellent service in stopping the enemy's supplies and harassing his retreat. Lieutenant- Colonel Molesworth has shown much enterprise and energy in these duties and also in reconnaissance work which has been most valuable. Captain C. A. Pogson, 1 ijth Mahrattas, has done very valuable intelli gence work in connection with the Euphrates Blockade and showed much enterprise and daring. He has probably undergone more continuous hardships than any other individual in the force. Lieutenant R, H. Deii?ng ) Royal Engineers. —On April 15th, the Euphrates Blockade guns drove two ' mahailas' (large country cargo boats) into the r&lt; eds. Lieutenant Dewing went in after them and destroyed them with ex plosives. Lieutenant Commander A. G. Sevmour, R. N. {M. M. S. Espzegle) — The guns and gun crews of the Royal Navy under this officer have contri buted largely to the success of the Euphrates Blockade, while his advice on Naval matters and constant support were most valuable to the Officer Com manding. Major {temperary Lieutenant-Colonel} L. H. Queripel, R. A., Deputy Director of Army Signals, Head Quarters, has shown energy and capability in meeting the sudden strain thrown on the signal service by the operations round Shaiba. Captain F, Booth, The King's Own {Royal Lancaster Regiment), No, 24 {Divisional Siyigat) Company,~W\s zeal and unremitting supervision successfully disposed of the heavy traffic that was unceasing between 12th and 16th April. 2' d-Lieutenat y McConville, The King's {Liverpool Regiment) No. 34 {Divis onal bxgnaL) Company, from 12th to i6th April never left his station day or night, doing very valuable work. No. 46, Serjeant A. Butcher, No. 34 [Divisional Signal Company), bet ween 12th and i6ih constantly helped the Signallers in their work besides directing traffic and supervising the repair of lines. His services were of the greatest use.Jemadar Marugesan, A r o. 34 {Divisional Signal) Company, made two brave attempts on i2th April to repair the Shaiba line, but on both occasions was recalled by the General Officer Commanding, 30th Brigade. Between that date and the 16th supervised his station with unremitting zeal. No. 370, Naik Sher Ali&gt; 20th Duke of Cambridge's Own Infantry {Brown* low's Punjabis) behaved with initiative and gallantry during the attack on a ' bellum ' convoy on night of the 12th-13th April. Colonel P, Hehir, Indian Medical Service, Acting Deputy Director of Medical Services, materially assisted the operations by the ability and untiring energy which he displayed in the working of the important department over which he at the time was presiding. Major H. A. Bransbury, Royal Army Medical Corps, commanded the sections of No. 19 Combined Clearing Hospital that carried out the evacuation of the wounded after Shaiba—attended himself to all cases (over j,ioo wounded including those of the enemy) as they arrived, displaying much initiative and resource. 4th Class Assistant Surgeon H. N. Murphy, Indian Subordinate Medical Department, was attached to No. 19 Combined Clearing Hospital during the evacuation of wounded from Shaiba—worked with untiring energy and marked intelligence, proving himself to be very capable and reliable, 12. Others of the Medical Service I consider worthy of commendation are Lieutenant-Colonel H. M. Adamson % Royal Army Medical Corps. —(Com manding No. 3. A., British General Hospital up to 21st April). Lieutenant-Colonel G. B. Irvine, Indian Medical 5m;^.—(Commanding No. 9 Indian General Hospital).— Lieutenant-Colonel D. J. Collins, Royal Army Medical —(Com manding No. 3 A., British General Hospital after 21st April). Lieutenant'Colonel F, J-. Paimer^ Royal Army Medical Corps. —(Surgical Specialist, No. 3 A., British General Hospital). Major H. R. Brown, Indian Medical Service, —(Commanding No. 19 Combined Clearing Hospital). Captan C. C, C, Shaw, Indian Medical Service. — (No. 19 Combined Clearing Hospital). Captain G. F. Graham^ Indian Medical Service. —(Medical Officer, 20th Duke of Cambridge's Own Infantry, Brownlow's Punjabis). ist Class Assistant Surgeon W, H. Brown, Indian Subordinate Medical Department, —(In charge of Dep6t of Medical Stores). 13. In conclusion I cannot fail to mention the great assistance I received from Major-General G. V. Kemball, C.B., D.S.O.—Major-General, General Staff, and Brigadier-General W. G. Hamilton, D. S. O., Deputy Adjutant and Quarter master-General, to whom I am much indebted for their able support; also to Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P, Z. Cox, K. C. I. E., C .S.I., the Chief Political Officer. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, JOHN NIXON, General, Commanding Indian Expeditionary Force a D smoGSB6 0 Report on the Operations at Shaiba on llth. and 12th April 1915, by Major-General C. I Fry, Indian Army, Commanding at Shaiba. SSfoGSB7 Report on the Operations at Shaiba on 11th and 12th April 1915. No. 1815 (Confidential), dated Dirhamij^ah, 2istjApril 1915. From— Major-general C. I. Fry, Commanding at Shaiba, To Major-General, General Staff, Indian Expeditionary Force ' D.' I have the honour to submit this report which deals with the first portion of the operations at Shaiba and covers the period during which I was in command of the garrison. ^ nc ^ cat j 0n of the advance of the Turkish forces from iNakhailah was a message received from my normal protective Cavalry recon- nth Ami ioi«; naissance at 7 a.m ., to the effect that Barjisiyah Wood and Shwebda were occupied by hostile cavalry and that further troops were advancing on the latter 7 A,M ' place from the north-west. The Protective Cavalry were reinforced by the 33rd Cavalry and at 9 A M. in ormation was received that a large body of the enemy's cavalry ad been located in Barjisiyah Wood, another body behind it, a large body oa.m. or Arabs to the north-west of Shwebda and a large column of regular in f 4i 000 men was advancing on Shwebda from the direction o Nakhailah. No guns could be distinguished and there were no signs of enemy in other directions. Except for the approach of the columns on Shwebda, the situation remained unchanged till about 3-30 p .m ., when our advanced patrols were 3-30 p.m. driven back by hostile cavalry. At 4 P.Ms, the 6th Cavalry Brigade under Brigadier-General H. Kennedy 4P . M . moved out, supported by a small mixed column always held in readiness for the occasion. The enemy, however, retired in to Bariisiyah Wood and by 7 P .M. all was quiet. 7 p. M . 3. My intelligence this evening pointed to an attack during the later portion of the night by a force of some. 12,000 Regulars (mostly Kurds). 12 Field Guns. 10,000 Tribesmen. The plan of attack was said to be— (a) An attack by the Turkish Regulars direct on the Fort. (b) Saiyid Yezdi and his following were to attack, from Ana's Tomb, the north of our position. (c) Ajaimi's Tribesmen on the south of Shaiba from Zubair. (d) Yusuf, with the u beni malick'*, from Old Basrah. All tents were struck and troops occupied their alarm posts. The distribution of the Garrison, which varied only slightly during the ensuing day, is given the sketch Map of Shaiba Defences.* 4. The expected attack was actually made at 5 a.m ., on 12th April ^nd turned out to be very much on the above plan. Heavy fire was opened on the Fort Section of the defences from the west and south-west iath Apfii 1515. just as it was becoming light, our two piquets in this direction making the enemy 5A,M • disclose themselves and retiring without loss. The enemy's advanced line reached to about 900 yards of the position and were then checked. At: 5*45 A M ' enemy's gun fire was opened on the Fort from 2 guns to the westward and these were engaged by our Field Artillery. s -^ a . ii . A determined advance of the Turkish Infantry was made at 6-10 a. m. supported by heavy rifle fire mainly against South Salient, but their attacking &lt; line was extended round the west of the Fort up to Kiln Post. 6-ioa . m . # Vide Map Nc. 1 in po:ket.8 6-3^ a. u. Large bodies of enemy's infantry were seen advancing over the horizon to the westward and masses were also seen occupying the ridge of hills immedi ately north of Old Basrah*. 7a.m. By y-A. M.the enemy were definitely repulsed and retired leaving small part ies in observation, who entrenched themselves about 1 ,700 yards from the west and south-west of our position. The attack against Cairn post was not very 8 a. m . determined and broke up about 8 a.m., considerable numbers, however, collecting in the tamarisk wood to the south of that post. 5. Hitherto on the northern face of the position all had been quiet and the 9 a.m . defences at Kiln Post and West Work had not been seriously engaged, but at 9 a. m. a large force of irregulars with 6 standards occupied North Mound and house,s in the vicinity. Here they remained all day and the subsequent night, making various attempts to advance on our position, but they were easily checked by rifle and machine gun fire. 6. Meanwhile further enemy's guns had opened on the position till it was estimated that they had two heavy 4*5', six Field and four Mountain guns dis persed mostly in pairs in an ai^extending from west to the south. Their heavy guns kept up a good and accurate fire but never exactly located our batteries, which were under cover, while their other guns did little harm, their shells in most cases bursting too high. Our artillery observing officers on Kiln Post located the flashes of the enemy's artillery and in most cases their detachments were driven off, and 6 guns were completely silenced—these guns were withdrawn in the middle of the day while the mirage rendered their position invisible. Two guns of 23rd Mountain Battery, which had been placed for the night immediately south of the Fort, were withdrawn about 11 a. m. without difficulty. 7. Preparations had been made for the despatch of a column of all arms towards Old Basrah to cover the landing of the 30th Brigade and a Mountain Battery, which were known to have left Basrah. This, however, was not put into effect as that force was recalled to Basrah. II. A. M, 2-15 p. m. 8. The enemy resumed their attack at 2-15 P.M., mainly directed as before on the Sou^h Salient, and to prevent them establishing themselves on the western portion of the Dorset position I sent J Battalion 2nd Norfolk Regiment from the reserve to occupy this place, replacing them in my General Reserve by a Battalion 2nd Dorset Regiment from 16th Brigade. 9. Up to this time nothing of note had occurred on the Eastern Defence work 2-30 p. m . bey 1 0nd A s ? 1 I ? ie sni P in g' b ut at 2-30 P. M. as the snipers had become troublesome to the Artillery observation post, Major Wheeler, 7th Lancers, volunteered to take his squadron and clear them. The movement was made at the gallop, but the original objective was covered by enemy's irregulars in a hidden position—these were ridden over and many lanced, while 'S ' Battery, Royal Horse Artillery, and machine guns repelled an attempted counter-attack by hostile horsemen. 1 he manoeuvre was very effective and the squadron was admirably led with great dash by Major Wheeler, who lost only one man and three horses wounded. (See Appendix C, page 15 ) 3p m. I0, 3 p ' M. the attack died away and sniping tactics were resorted to and soon afterwards about 3-25 p. m . further enemy's guns opened fire from a P • M • sou erl y direction, and at 4 p. m . the enemy's artillery appeared to be registering much 8 demag' 0113 ^ 0r ^ 0ns P 05 * 1 ^ 008 with percussion fuze without doing Kight arrangements, J '• For the ensuing night I reinforeed Cairn Post with a Double Company Inl k, a r try the southern P° rt 'on of East Work, their place being taken by men? w« 0 Ti ,y ' ,0t t h Li S ht Infantr y- The i Battalion, 2nd Norfolk Regi- ment, was withdrawn frr&gt;rr. • • 1 • • , » and thic r ^ ueneral UeIa main for £ Battalion from j6Lh Brigade portions'of Pirmpf mi w ' I, 7 was P lac ^ centrally between the two ' l! ! ,l Vorks - Durin g the earIier P art of the night the 24th Camp Ve ln be ^ ums ' fr' om Basrah and bivouacked near the Cavalry9 is. About 5 P. M. a distinct rearward movement was noticed in front of our 3 ^ north defensive line and fourteen big ' bellums ' were seen going off in a northerly direction filled with Arabs from North Mound vicinity. 13. At dusk a furious attack was made from the western extremity of Dorset position, supported by fire from south-west and west, heavy rifle and 6-45 p. m. machine gun fire being brought to bear on the South Salient and ground immediately east and west of the Fort, but they made no progress and the attack died away to intermittent firing. The machine gun in South Salient was out of action from 7 P. M. to 9 P. M. but was replaced by one from the 48th 7 P ' u ' Pioneers during this time, and the searchlight here too was put out of action by rifle fire 15 minutes after it had opened up. 14. Throughout the night intermittent firing, with occasional heavy bursts with machine gun fire, took place to cover bold attempts to cut our wire entangle ments, especially on South Salient w 7 here the enemy^ main efforts were concen trated, though these attacks extended to the north end of the Fort on our right and to Cairn Post on the left. The brunt of these attacks fell on the 48th Pioneers and 17th Company, 3rd Sappers and Miners, which units with ceaseless vigilance repelled every effort of the enemy. During the heavier periods of the attacks the star shell fired by Field and Mountain Artillery greatly assisted in the defence. The machine gun of the 2nd Norfolk Regiment at the southern extremity of South Salient did most excellent service throughout the day and-night in a very exposed position. The 120th Infantry and portion of the 1 10th Light Infantry in East Work and Cairn Post were less heavily engaged, but frequently repelled the efforts of wire cutters and were throughout alert for develop ments. 15. At 11 P .m. the enemy were heard digging off South Salient and a half mpm . Double Company 48th Pioneers was held in readiness to meet any penetration by the enemy, while I held 1 Double Company 2nd Norfolk Regiment ready for par ticular support in this direction. 16. The night thus passed with occasional lulls till 3-30 a.m ., when the final 13th April, attempt was made and small parties were seen close up to the entanglements (one party was heard to call out in Hindustani !&lt; Do not fire '). After this no further attacks were made and all became quiet. 17. From 4-30 a.m. Major-General Melliss, V.C , C.B., who had arrived 4.30A.M.| late the previous evening with the 6th Divisional Staff, took over command of the garrison, but not being ' au fait ' with the defence arrangements, had left the conduct of the operations for the night to me, and my report on subsequent operations has been submitted to him. 18. The casualties during this action were comparatively slight and were, approximately, British officers, wounded, 4; Rank and file killed 5, wounded 62. 19. The artillery expended some 1 ,495 shrapnel and *5 star shell during the above period of the action. to. The 6th Cavalry Brigade were not employed during the day except one squadron 7th Lancers and ' S' Battery, Royal Horse Artillery, under Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Sykes, Royal Horse Artillery, which did good work in co-operaiion with the Infantry and other Artillery; they however came in for many casualties among their horses as, unfortunately, their camp was situated directly behind the Fort Section of the defence and in line with the main hostile attacks. I wish to mention:— Major G. G. M, Wheeler, Jth Lancers, —For the gallant and admirable lead- x ing of his Squadron in the charge against a body of the enemy south of Piquet Works, who had been causing much annoyance to our artillery observation post, with a most successful and effective result. 21. The Artihery afforded, as has been my experience throughout the campaign, a magnificent support and their rapid location of the enemy's guns was followed by a slackening and in many cases a cessation of their fire. Lieute nant'Colonel E, iS. Clee've ) R.F.A., most efficiently directed the artillery during sseooSB10 the defence as my C. R. A. and I would also mention- Major E. V. Sarson, R.F.A. for their clever handling of their Major H. Broke Smith, R.F.A. / batteries and accuracy of fire in silenc- Major E. E. Edlmann, D.S.O., R.G.A. f ing the enemy's guns and repelling J his attack. 22. The 16th Infantry Brigade were not seriously engaged during the day or night and the General Officer Commanding has no recommendations to make. I would like however to pay tribute to Brigadier-General W. S. Delamain, C.B:, D.S.O., and his Brigade, who originally constructed the defences which the i8th Infantry Brigade were occupying. 23. I wish to bring forward to special notice the very gallant defence made by the 48th Pioneers and 17th Company, 3rd Sappers and Miners, who bore the brunt ot the enemy's attacks. All ranks behaved with great steadiness and their vigilance and good shooting repelled all attempts of the Turkish forces to break through the defences. This section of the defence was admir- ably commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel A. J. A'. Harward, 48th Pioneers. The following further names are brought forward for recognition N 0 ' 365 Naik Hukmi, 48th Pioneers, when at dawn No. 7 Piquet retired, refused to leave the piquet until the last man had got away safely under a heavy fire. N 0, 345 Mavildar Harchand, 48th Pioneers, commanded No. 7 Piquet and withdrew his men with skill and coolness so well that the enemy continued to fire into the piquet position after its evacua tion.

The 17th Company, 3rd Sappers and Miners (with 481 h Pioneers), with stood all the shocks of the Turkish attacks, being in occupation of the South Salient, with utmost coolness and steadiness and were ably commanded by Captain E. J. Lortng, R.E. I would mention— No. 31125 Sapper C. A, PVeL's, P.E., Searchlight Section, who did excellent work under heavy fire till his light was put out of action. Jemadar Mohammed Din, No. ij Company yd Sappers and Miners. — For his coolness under heavy fire and the able way in which he directed the fire of his men under trying circumstances in a particularly exposed part of the defences. 25. The 120th Rajputana Infantry under Major P. F. Pocock, though not very seriously attacked during the day, were frequently assailed at night in attempts of the enemy to cut their wire entanglement. They occupied a some what exposed position at Cairn Post and behaved very steadily and with great coolness. 26. The 2nd Norfolk Regiment and noth Light Infantry, excepting 1 Double Company of the latter under Lieutenant Colonel Britten, who were engaged during the night in repelling attempts on thtir obstacles, were not seriously engaged, though kept continually on the alert, especially at night, to meet developments. I mention^— Lieutenant H, S. Fnrehrothr, 2-Norfolk Regiment, for his skilful hand ling of the machine gun at South Salient until seriously wounded. No. 6502 Lance-C orpcral R. \l aller,-2 Norfolk Regiment, was in charge of the machine gun at South Salient after Lieutenant Farebrother was wounded and handled his gun exceedingly well and assisted largely in keeping off the attack when it was heaviest. 1 hough woundedj he still continued to direct the work of the gun throughout the night I2th-i3th. The action cf Lieutenant Farebrother and Lance Corporal Waller has also been brought to mv notice by L : eutenant-Colonel Harward, Commanding the Fort Section, in wMch this machine gun was employed in a very important and expcssd position He reports that the accuracy and intensity of the fire was remarkably gcod.'55 11 Double 37. cannot speak too highly of the behaviour of the Medical Department in all its ranks. There was no flinching during the bombardment and perfect steadiness, and their work was done in a most efficient manner under the able direction of Lieutenant-Colonel J. Hennessy, R.A.M.C. As I have already noted during this campaign, the Army Bearer Corps and Hospital Corps behaved excellently. I would particularly bring to notice the good work done by— Major T* G.Foster, R.A.M.C., and Captain R. K. Wright, I.M.S., No. 3 Field Ambulance, who were working in the Fort Section of the defence and most exposed to fire. 28. 34fh Divisional Signal Company. —I wish to specially notice the excellent work done by the 18th Brigade Section of this company. Through out the operations under report they were constantly engaged in the dual capa city of Brigade Signal Section and Divisional Signal Section, being the link between me and my whole force. They were consequently exceedingly hardwork- ed and got no rest. I cannot speak too highly of their work and they were ably commanded by Captain H. G. Morrell who was untiring in his exertions. I would also bring to favourable notice— No. 41 Serjeant F. Murphy for continuous hard work supervising both tele phone and visual signallings hio. 16 Corporal J.

Finally I wish to bring to special notice the good work done by my Staff Officers, Captain E. G. Dunn, Royal Irish Rifles, Brigade Major, and Captain W. F. C. Gilchrist, 52nd Sikhs (F.F.), Staff Captain. They have had on their shoulders the Staff work of the Shaiba Force and of the 18th Infantry Brigade up to the time of the arrival of the Divisional Headquarters on the night of 12th, and have carried out their duties with untiring zeal and efficiency, especi ally during the enemy's attack on the 12th, when their forethought and general good staff work were of the greatest assistance to me. I would also mention Major H. Smyth, Cheshire Regiment, Intelligence Officer, attached to my Staff. The information collected by this Officer was wonderfully accurate and was of the greatest assistance to me. I have the honour to be, S ir, Your obedient servant, C. I.

Headquarters 6th Division. Shaiba, 24th April /p/5. From The General Officer Commanding, Shaiba Force, To The Major-General, General Staff, Indian Expeditionary Force ' D Sir, I have the honour to submit reports on the operations of the Shaiba Force on 13th and i^h April 1915. I arrived at Shaiba by ' bellum ' convoy at 8-30 P. M. on the 12th April with the 24th Punjabis (less 1 Double Conpany) and 6th Divisional Staft, placed at my disposal by the Army Commander. A general all round night attack on the landward sides of the defensive perimeter was in progress at the lime of my anival. This attack was nowhere pressed home, but continued with varying intensity throughout the night of i2-i3th, the enemy endeavouring without success to cut the barbed wire entanglement at various points. As senior, I assumed command from Major-General C I. Fry that night, after making myself acquainted with the distribution and disposition of the troops. The night attack died away at 4 A. M. The Cavalry Prigade,* in pursuance of orders issued by Major-General Fry rsth April. on the afternoon of the 1 2th instant and approved by me that night, moved out at * ,, . s ' Ro 3 ,al H o rse 7 A. M. towards North Mound in order to clear our right flank and ascertain ^thu'nce s tne enemy s strength and dispositions to the north-west. The 104th Rifles ' 6th CawH,r y* (Lieutenant-Colonel Clery) followed as a support and were placed under the ^squ^olZeach orders of the Cavalry Brigadier. unit. The Cavalry, 7th Lancers leading, remainder following in support, on nearing North Mound came under a very heavy rifle fire from superior forces advancing from North Mound, the broken ground near House A*jand from House B f I f Vide large map No. The 7th Lancers, under Lieutenant-Colonel Cook, made a gallant charge IV 10 l)0cket ' on North Mound and vicinity and a large number of hostile Arabs were put to fiight. Trenches, however, immediately behind North Mound and House A were strongly held, and a hot fire was poured into the Cavalry ranks. A squad' ron ol the 7th l ancers most gdliantly led by Major Wheeler actually charged the mouna itself. Major Wheeler, closely supported by Jemadar Sudhan Singh, 7th Lancers, rode at the enemy^ standard planted on the mound and both were shot dead in their gallant attempt. The remaining squadrons of the 7th Lancers, under Lieutenant-Colonel Cook's command, made a gallant attempt to clear the enemy from the palm groves, but from good cover the enemy's fire at short range proved so effective that the 7th Lancers had to retire and Bri gadier-General Kennedy, realizing that the enemy in force were firmly established « and that his main body ( i6Lh and 33rd Cavalry) were exposed to a severe flank ing fire from entrenched infantry, decided not to press the attack and to withdraw his Brigade. I had previously instructed him verbally not to commit his Brigade at this phase of the action if serious opposition were encountered. This took place at 7-45 A. M. 1 he actions of the Cavalry Brigade were well supported by ' S n Battery, Royal Horse Artillery^ under Lieutenant-Colonel Sykes^ while the 104th Rifles^ SSCoGSB*7 • vide large map p OS t e( j j U st nortti of House C,* covered the retirement by a well sustained No. iv m pocket. accurate fire. 1 ordered the withdrawal to camp of this battalion on the retirement of the Cavalry. From Kiln Post, where I established my Headquarters, an excellent view of 'he whole of the terrain to the north of Shaiba is obtainable and large bodies of the enemy were visible advancing near North Mound and to the east of it. At 8-30 a. m. I ordered Brigadier-General Delamain, Commanding 16th Brigade, to move out from the defensive perimeter with 3 battalions' 2nd Dorsets, I04ih Rifles and 24th Punjabis) wiih Notth Mound as his first objective, cover ing liis advance with the concentrated fire of the 63rd and 76th Batteries, Royal Field Artillery, and 23rd Mountain Battery, whilst ' S ' Battery, Royal Horse Artillery, also co-operated. The concentrated fire of the guns and the engaging of successive enemy's targets was most skilfully controlled and directed by r be Divisional Artillery Commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Cleeve, whose valuable assistance throughout the operations of the i3ih I particularly desire to brmg to notice. The co-operation between Infantry and Artillery in the attack and indeed throughout the action of the 13th was most marked, and very largely contributed to the success of the operations. By 11 a.m. Brigadier-General Delamain was in occupation of North Mound and the enemy, many of whom had clun&lt;* to their trenches with great tenacity, were in full retreat to the northward*! Oyer 90 of his dead were found on North Mound itself. Meanwhile consistent sniping and desultory attacks were in progress to the west-south-west, and south of my perimeter, and troops, computed at 3 battalions, were visible to the south-west of the Brick Kiln and a considerable force to the westward. I now decided to continue the clearing movement against this unbroken enemv, and incidentally to capture two of their guns, which their teams owing to our accurate shell fire had been unable to remove. With this object I ordered the General Officer Commanding, 16th Brigade, to make a partial left wheel pivotting on North Mound, which was to be held to protect his right flank. I pushed a ^ Battalion npth Infantry (Lieutenant Colonel Chitty) to reinforce Brigadier-General Delamain's left and ordered Battalions of the 18th Brigade (2nd Norfolks, 2 Double Com panies 48th Pioneers) under Lieutenant-Colonel Peebles to prolong the line of the 16th Brigade to the left, co-operating with their advance. ^ The Cavalry Brigade were again moved forward and placed under Brigadier -General Delamain's orders to protect his right flank. Supported by a sustained and accurate shrapnel fire from our batteries, the enemy, though in considerable force in well constructed trenches, were unable to withstand the elan of our Infantrv. Many, surrendered and the two abandoned mountain guns were secured The Cavalry Br.gade on the right flank succeeded In gettmg home Into the now btoken enemy and accounting for more than ioo of them. By 2 .30 p. m the whole vicinity of the camp was clear of the enemv hut large numbers could st.ll be seen to the southward in direction of South Mound TfifhV H gUnS j been located - The General Officer Commanding' 6th Bngade reported at 2-35 p. m . that he was advancing on South Muond some 3 miles distant and hoped to capture these guns. I decided that at this late hour it was not desirable to undertake a trenpral engagement with the enenn's main forces with mv troops who had been under a ms continuously throughout the previous night and were in need of a I therefore Issued orders to break off the enoao-ement W a j ordered a general retirement to the Fort at 3 p. m . 00 y entirely undisturbed by hostile sniplngor the^fire. 8 ' t0 previous n 'S ht ' wa *0 sa sii(d ln »» 4e and Vo ^-&lt;53 r d Battery had only 5 gam. 18 Ffom personal observation shortly after dawn on 14th April 1915, from the . Re P ort on 0 P er ^ ,Ki!n Post, considerable bodies of the enemy were seen in the direction of South [gl's. 0 * 14tn ?rl Mound some 2-J miles south-west of Shaiba Fort, while the immediate vicinity of the fort was practically clear of the enemy. The exact whereabouts of the enemy's mVm force was uncertain. 4 0n the 12th April a large force had been reported to be at Old Basrah, while all reports pointed to the Barjisiyah Woods being strongly held, but it was evident that the enemy had been severely shaken by the action of the 13th Apri'. I decided therefore to continue the offensive without awaiting the arrival of the remainder of the 30th Brigade (2 battalions). These reinforcements' would, I was aware, be necessarily delayed by the difficulty of transport through the area which is inundated to a depth of from a to 4 feet and which extends for some 8 miles between Shaiba and Basrah. Moreover the necessary line of advance to Shaiba from Old Basrah had been, as I was aware, hitherto closed by the enemy, while reports of withdrawal from Barjisiyah Wood in a north-west direction rendered it desirable to advance without further delay. I therefore ordered the whole force (less 104th Rifles, 48 h Pioneers 3 field guns as Gamp Garrison) to start at 9 A M. to engage the enemy w ever found. Operation Orders were issued accordingly. 300 rounds rifle ammunition and «water pakhals were taken by the troops, who carried a havresack ratiDn, The troops moved off at 9-30 A.M. in preparatory formation for Artillery fire, the »6th Brigade, with the 23rd Mountain Battery, 22nd Company Sappers and Miners and 24th Punjabis attached, moving with their left directed on a point 300 yards to the west of South Mound, while the three Battalions of the 18th Brigade, with 17th Company Sappers and Miners, moved off on the left of the 16th Brigade, echeloned back, left refused. The Cavalry Brigade was moved wide on the right flank of the 16 th Brigade, detaching ^ Squadron to protect our extreme left flank, guns in rear of centre and Divisional Headquarters with the guns. The 16th Brigade were directed on South Mound, with 18th Brigade refused on my left, as I apprehended a possible attack from the direction of Old Basrah or Zubair. The advance on South Mound took place under ineffective long range rifle fire from the enemy's advanced troops—mostly mounted men who soon gave way before our advance, South Mound being occupied and Divisional Headquarters established there by 10-30 A.M. It now became apparent that the enemy's main force was in position in the vicinity of Barjisiyah Wood and that Old Basrah and Zubair were not strongly held. I accordingly ordered the left of the 16th Brigade to be directed some what north of the W'atch Tower while I ordered 2 battalions of the 18th Brigade (2nd Battalion, Norfolk Regiment, and 120th Rajputana Infantry) to pass from left to the right rear of the )6th Brigade and the remaining battalion of the 18th Brigade (110th Mahratta Light Infantry) to remain echeloned on left of 16th Brigade Whilst these movements were in progress I rode forward to where the Cavalry Brigade were in position on my right flank, engaged in dismounted fire action. From this point I endeavoured to make a reconnaissance of the enemy's position but owing to the mirage this proved extremely difficult. It was not possible to locate any of the enemy's trenches but I was able to determine that his right extended as far south as the high Watch Tower, but where his left rested I could not ascertain. On returning to Divisional Headquarters I therefore ordered General Delamain to direct the left of his advance on the Watch Tower and requested General Fry, Commanding 18th Brigade, to pass over his remaining battalion (f 10th Mahratta Light Infantry) to the right rear of his own Brigade. My plan of operations was to engage the enemy along his front extending from a point to the west of the W'atch Tower, while I drove back his left with the 18th Brigade and thereby threatened his line of retirement towards Nakhailah. I ordered my Cavalry Brigade to co-operate with this object, while giving the Brigadier a free hand to seijce any opportunity for vigorous action ^hjch might ofter.It sbon became evident th^it the enemy occupied a very extensive front of some 3^ miles and considerably overlapped cur line. Ihe 18th Brigade had to come up into line with and on the right of the 16th Brigade in order to engage the enemy along his front—the i 10th Infantry being my sole reserve. By 11-15 A.M. I discovered definitely that the enemy's line covered over 3 miles, extending from west of Watch Tower to the north end of Barjisiyah Wood (' Dry Wells' on map). The iSih Brigade having come into line with the 16th Brigade a general advance from South Mound was continued for a mile without incident. By 1 1 -30 A M. the two battalions in the front line of the 16th Brigade (2nd Battalion, Dorset Regiment and 24th Punjabis) became suddenly heavily engaged with the enemy in position at goo yards distance from the Dorsets and 6.0 from the Punjabis, while on the right the 18th Brigade were also fully engaged, the Norfolks and 120th Infantry coming under heavy rifle and machine gun tire from trenches some 400 yards to their front. The enemy's trenches were well sited and practically invisible from the front, while the glacis-like slope of the ground trending towards the Barjisiyah Woods aBorded them an ideal position for defence, and a large proportion of our casualties occurred at this stage. At 1 P.M. I ordered the 18th Brigade to advance direct on the gap in the trees near the north end of Barjisiyah Wood and the 16th Brigade to close the gao between the 2 Brigades—both to co-operate in the attack. Heavy firing now became general all along the line, the whole of our Artillery being engaged in dose support of the Infantry attack. At 11 -30 p.m. three casualties occurred m the Divisional Staff, my C. R. A., Lieutenant-Colonel Cleeve, being wounded and his successor Major Kdlnann being hu before he could take over his duties, while Captain Cardew, Assistant Director Army Signals, was also wound ed. At; this period the General Officer Commanding, 16th Briuade, ordered the 22nd Company Sappers and Miners to prolong the right of the 24th Punjabis, and •| battahon, 117th Mahrattas, to reinforce on the right of the Sappers and Miners, and with these reinforcements a further advance was effected in this part of the held. 1 he General Officer Commanding, 18th Brigade, now pushed forward ^ batta lion of Tioth Mahratta Light Infantry on the right of the 1 20!;h Infantry, holding the remaining wing of the 110th and'No. 17 Company, Sappers and'Miners in reserve, but owing to an enfilading fire from the right flank the advance of the iSih Brigade was checked. At 2-30 P.M. I called on the Cavalry Brigade for vigorous action to assist the forward movement of the 110th on the extreme right flank. The Cavalry assisted by dismounted rifle fire, while ' S ' Battery, Royal Horse Artillery, also co operated. At 3 0 P.M. the fight was practically stationary, the enemy clinging to his trenches with Qesptrate tenacity while the Cavalry reported their inability to press forward on the enemy's left flank owing to severe shell fire and the mud line The Artillery were supporting our Infantry attack to the utmost, but such support was extremely difficult to render owing to the mirage and the invisibility of the enemy's trenches. Our gunners did splendid work and I must mention one of many instances of it. The Norfolks were losing heavily and asked for further Artillery support. Lieutenant Gilpin, 63rd Battery, Royal Field Artillery went forward into the Norfolk firing line for observation of 'tire, and communication with his Battery Commander was maintained by Captain De Grey, Adjutant of the Norfolks, who from the firing line flag signalled back to the Battery the result or Lieutenant Gilpin s observations. Many were the gallant deeds of reso- lute course b y a|1 ranks on this day, but this appears a striking example of the right kind of Infantry and Artillery co-operation. The day was now waning and I told both Infantry Brigadiers that the enemy s position in advance of Barjisiyah Woods must be taken and that a aene- ral advance with the whole of the Artillery in ;close support must now be made. The troops responded most gallantly to tins fresh call, the 76th Battery in action0 20 close to the Watch Tower supporting the 16th Brigade, the 63rd Battery and 23rd Mountain Battery, the 18th Brigade. At 4 -15 p.m. the 2nd Battalion, Norfolks, and 120th Infantry under Colonel Peebles and Major Pocock respectively, dashed at the enemy's trenches with the bayonet, while the 1 loth, also under heavy fire, pressed unflinchingly forward on the right supported by ' S' Battery and dismounted Cavalry fire. Almost simultaneously part of the i5th Brigade consisting of the 2nd Battalion, Dorsets, 24th Punjabis, 119th Infantry (less 1 Double Company in reserve) and 1 Double Company, 117th Mahrattas, withdrawn from the left flank guard, made a general advance and by 5-0. p.m. the enemy abandoned the front trenches all along the line and fled, many surrendering. At 4-40 p.m . Operation Order No. 1* for retire- * vuepzge 29. ment to commence at 5-30 p.m. to Shaiba was issued. In the meantime at 4-0 P-M., in view of the necessary withdrawal before nightfall, the 48th Pioneers with all available Jaipur carts were ordered out from Shaiba. The Pioneers were directed to take up a rear guard position about South Mound to cover the retirement of the main body and the carts were also directed there to be ready to assist in the collection and evacuation of the wound ed. The arrangements for the collection and disposal of the large numbers of wounded were ably arranged for by Lieutenant-Colonel H. O. Bi Browne-Mason, Royal Army Medical Corps, Officiating Assistant Director of Medical Services. The retirement timed for 5-30 actually commenced at 6 -o p.m . owing to the difficulty of collection and removal of the wounded scattered over a wide area. Our withdrawal was entirely unmolested and the troops reached Shaiba with all wounded by 8-30 p.m. It is impossible to conceive a more exposed tract of ground than the plain devoid of cover over which our Infantry had to attack the Turkish trenches, cleverly concealed and sited. Our advance in the last 400 yards was down a glacis-like slope. It was on the crest of this slope that so many of our losses occurred. Splendid dash, combined with resolute courage, alone carried our men across that bullet swept glacis. It was a sheer dogged soldiers' fight and no words of mine can adequately express my admiration of the conduct of those gallant regiments who won through, viz., 2nd Battalion, Norfolks, 2nd Battalion, Dorsets, 24th Punjabis, 110th Mahratta Light Infantry, 119th Infantry, 117th Mahrattas, 120th Infantry, 17th and 22nd Companies of the 3rd Sappers and Miners. It is gratifying to record the fact that all the Indian troops engaged (24th Punjabis excepted) are old Bombay Presidency Regiments. They have proved on this occasion that they are worthy to stand shoulder to shoulder with the best troops that the Empire can produce and I trust that these Corps may be permit ted to inscribe the battle honour of ' Barjisiyah ' on their colours as a fitting tribute to their gallant conduct on this haKl-fought field.
