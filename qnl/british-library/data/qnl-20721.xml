I have the honour to forward herewith the Annual Administration Report of the Residency for the year 1936...dt) ( i ) REVIEW. ARAB SIDE. RETROSPECT, 1926—1936. The Arab side of the Persian Gulf has shown so many changes of late that it may be of interest to give a picture of it 10 years ago and as it is now. A decade ago there was no Air Route on the Arab side (Imperial Airways had just reached the Gulf but were operating along the Persian Coast), no oil had been discovered in that area, and the Naval Base for the Persian Gulf Division was at Henjam in Persian territorial waters. Iraq 'was still a Mandate under British control and there were no Kuwaiti-Iraqi problems of much importance. His Majesty King Abdul Aziz was still busy consolidating his conquest of the Hedjaz, and nearer home in Nejd was engaged in promoting the Akhwan movement and forming Akhwan colonies. Saudi Arabia in fact had little concern with the Arab Shaikh- doms of the Gulf. t , Nowadays the Imperial Airways route to India and beyond lies along the Arab Coast, and several overland routes from Europe to the East by air, tram and car, which have been opened up through the Middle Fast connect wUh the Persian Gulf. There is a large anfflour ^hing oilfield at Bahrain, others at Kuwait and Qatar which are being explored bv the Companies concerned, and still other potential fields on the Trucial Coast and in Muscat which are the subject of negotiations. In this connection he construction of a refinery by the Bahrain Petroleum Companv in Bah rain which will be in full operation before the end of 1937, is a matter of consideraWe importance since our present supply of oil from the Persian Gulf is in a foreign country, e.g., Iran. In ca^e of war, with Iran neutral the supply of oil from this source might be difficult, and with Iran hostile it might cease altogether, at any rate for a time. When the Bahrain refin ery is working, even under peace conditions the Sloops of the Persian Gulf IJivision will be able if it is so desired, to procure their oil at their base in Bahrain instead of from Abadan. Amongst other results of oil develop ment is a startling increase of foreign population at Bahrain, where a decade ago there were some dozen Europeans and where there are now something like 300 Europeans and Americans. It is a point of some importance that the concessions granted by the Shaikhs to the Oil Com panies contain a clause that preference, whenever technically possible should be given to British subjects. Many of these, includinn- British Indians, are actually employed at Bahrain (for present figures see Oil Interests 1936 below), and as the new oilfields develop, will be employed in increasing numbers. The Naval Base is now also at Bahrain with a subsi diary base at Khor Kuwai in Muscat territory. Iraq is an Independent State and many important Iraqi-Kuwaiti problems have arisen. King Abdul Aziz has consolidated his Saudi Kingdom, which has caused him to look towards the Gulf for further expansion. The discovery of oil in the Arab Shaikhdoms has increased his ambitions in this direction, and, in regard to the Trucial Shaikhdoms, whose frontiers with those of Saudi Arabia have never been delimitated, has given rise to long and complicated negotiations. At Kuwait there is the vexed question of the Saudi trade blockade, and with Bahrain until recently, when they were settled certain questions of transit dues on goods to Saudi Arabia. .h. srsSstrsTstt srsK?i i 10 *** '~ »hisb,., j.

Royal Navy. —As in previous years the Sloops of the Persian Gulf Division continued to do excellent work on the Arab Coast, and were as usual frequently called on to assist the Political Resident and Political Officers under him in making their tours. The Naval Base at Bahrain has now been completed and is a considerable improvement on the old yied a, terre at Henjam. The subsidiary base at Khor Kuwai has likewise been completed. During the months of October and November His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron, H. M. S. Norfolk, visit ed the Gulf. Aviation. —The aircraft of the Royal Air Force continued their useful work in connection with the Air Route, and the Resident and Political Officers under him were enabled from time to time to make tours in Royal Air Force machines, which proved a considerable convenience. The bi-weekly service of Imperial Airways was carried out with regu larity, though not with punctuality, during the year. On 29th August the Eastbound Imperial Airways Liner 'Horsa' forced landed in a desolate area on the Arabian mainland 40 miles from the coast. It was located by Royal Air Force aircraft, by whom the pas sengers were transported to Bahrain, The guarding of the machine until it could be flown to Bahrain a fortnight later was arranged by the Political Agent, Bahrain, through the Bahrain Government. In May the Air Navigation Regulations for civil aircraft made by the Rulers of Muscat, Bahrain and Kuwait were applied by King's Regula tion to persons to whom the Muscat, Bahrain and Kuwait Orders in Coun cil respectively apply. As in 1935, the Arab Air Route remained closed to private aviators. In spite of this on 4th October Mr. F. W. Rickett, the well-known oil con cession hunter of Abyssinian fame, made an unauthorised landing at Shar- jah in a private aeroplane. Instructions have been issued for the refusal to him in future of visas for Iran and the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. On the 30th November and 12th December the Westbound Liners of the K. L. M., which had not got special authorisation for landing at Bahrain, and had been driven by weather conditions off their course along the Persian coast and! were short of fuel, landed at Bahrain. They were permitted to refuel and proceed, but the K. L. M. were informed by His Majesty's Government that they should procure special authorisations for all their machines. The following facilities for the Civil Air Route were obtained during the year. In July permission was obtained from the Shaikh of Abu Dhavi for the erection of a self-tending beacon on Ilalul Island. In September permission for a similar facility on Sir Bu Na air Island was obtained from the Shaikh of Sharjah. An agreement for landing ground and connected facilities and for a seaplane anchorage was concluded in August with the Shaikh of Kalba. In November and December the Royal Air Force, under the auspices fhp Political Affent, Muscat, carried' out a successful reconnaissance of Sluarah and Kuria Muria Bays. The landing ground previously con- structed at Sauqrah Bay was made serviceable and an additional landing ground was constructed between Khor Ghanm and Murbat. This success ful result was all the more gratifying since, owing to the inaccessibility of( iii ) the area concerned, one of the most desolate on the Arabian Coast, and the fact that the local tribes, though nominally under Muscat, are in reality under no control whatever, the task was exceptionally difficult. Oil Interests. —After several years, during which Oil Companies dis played no interest in Muscat, in the year under review they began to turn their attention to this Sultanate. Petroleum Concessions Limited wished to open negotiations with the Sultan but owing to His Highness's prolonged absence in Dhofar, an outlying and inaccessible area of his dominions, this could not be done. In the meantime the Sultan approached the Standard Oil Company of California by sending them some samples of oil which he had found at Dhofar. His Highness was expected back in Muscat early in 1937 when Petroleum Concessions Limited hoped to commence negotia tions with him. In January the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company secured an oil option in respect of his territory from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. In July Major Frank Holmes on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Limited (who have acquired the local rights of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company) began negotiations with the Shaikh of Dibai for conversion of the Dibai option into a concession. These negotiations proceeded very slowly and by the end of the year a concession had not yet been obtained. Petroleum Concessions Limited under their optional rights sent a survey party into some of the Shaikhdoms. The importance of Petroleum Concessions Limited, which Company has the approval of His Majesty's Government, obtaining concessions on the Trucial Coast lies in the fact that the Standard Oil Company of California, who are already operating concessions in Bahrain and in Saudi Arabia on the mainland of Hasa opposite Bahrain, are extremely anxious to capture also the Trucial Coast. To this end, towards the end of the year this Com pany commenced various underground intrigues on the Trucial Coast by sending confidential emissaries with messages to the Shaikhs that they should refuse Petroleum Concessions Limited's offers and, when Petroleum Concessions Limited's options had expired, grant concessions to themselves. Measures were taken to counter these intrigues, but the situation at the close of the year still gave cause for anxiety. Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited continued their survey of Qatar and commenced drilling for water, which they had undertaken to perform for the Shaikh. At the end of the year no potable water had been found. The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited had an even more success ful year than during 1935 when 176,388 tons of crude oil were shipped from Bahrain. During the year under review 500,400 tons of crude oil and 9,200 tons of fuel oil were exported. The total personnel of the Company for the last two years is as follows : — The C aliform an Arabian Standard Oil Company continued their ope rations throughout the year in Hasa without any signal success. The Kuwait Oil Company continued drilling throughout the vear without striking oil. Kuwait. —The Shaikh of Kuwait's date gardens in Iraq. In spite of efforts on the part of the various authorities concerned nothing definite had resulted towards the solution of this difficult problem by the end of the vear. Americans .

Doubtless some smuggling continues, as it does across all frontiers all over the world, but there is no doubt that it has considerably decreased. Besides their Preventive Service on the fron tier it would seem that the Iraqi authorities might well take more stringent action in the various areas within their own territories {e.g., Basra, Suq ash Sheukh, etc.) for dealing with the organisers of the contraband trade, who are Iraqi merchants. .With regard to the Iraqi incursions. Hitherto investigation of such cases had been carried out by Iraqi officials only. The unsatisfactory and one-sided nature of such investigations is obvious, and towards the end of the year a definite improvement was made by inducing the Iraq G-overn- ment to associate with their officials the Political Agent, Kuwait (on behalf of His Majesty's Government, and of His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait), in a particular enquiry into a series of some eight cases. It is hoped that w T ith this as a precedent future enquiries will be conducted on similar lines. As in 1935, no reparation has been forthcoming from the Iraq Government for any incidents. The pearl season showed a slight improvement in catch and prices over last year. In January His Majesty King Abdul Aziz visited Kuwait and was much pleased with his reception by His Highness the Shaikh. The royal visit, however, made no difference to the severity of the Saudi blockade of exports from Kuwait into Saudi Arabia. In spite of prolonged negotia tions with the Saudi Government the blockade was in force at the close of the year. Bahrain. —The chief event of the year was the visit of His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin 'Isa A1 Khalifah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., the Ruler, to England. His Highness left Bahrain in June and returned in August. During his stay in London for a fortnight he was the guest of His Majesty's Government and was accorded an audience by His Majesty. The visit was a distinct success and His Highness returned exceptionally pleas ed with the warmth of his reception. There was a decrease in the year under review in the number of pearl ing boats that set out, the catch was smaller and the market in Bahrain duller than during the previous year. In December the Bahrain Government published an Arms Ordnance Proclamation for the regulation of the importation, exportation, posses sion. manufacture and licensing of arms. This was simultaneously applied by King's 'Regulation No. 3 of 1936 to persons to whom the Bahrain Order in Council applies. The somewhat complicated question of a Nationality Law for Bahrain was advanced to its final stages, and it was hoped that the Law would be promulgated early in 1937. Trucial Important developments in Aviation and Oil connect ed with this area have already been dealt with under these headings. Outside these subjects the chief event of the year was the recognition of Kalba as an independent Shaikhdom in treaty ^ relations with His Majesty's Government. This followed on the obtaining of air facilities at Kalba already referred to. . , ^ n Negotiations continued throughout the year with the Saudi Govern ment on the subject of the Trucial Coast-Saudi frontiers without a settle ment being reached. ., , . ^ • o ix * ™ \Tyccnt His Highness Saivid Said bin Taimur Sultan of Muscat and Oman, who had left Muscat in February 1935, for Dhofar, an outlying( V ) area of his Dominions out of touch with his capital, as noted in the last Review, was still absent at the end of 1936. This caused considerable in convenience as there were various matters of importance, both local and otherwise, e.g., Saudi-Omani frontiers, for discussion with him. The Political Agent, Muscat, had to pay two or three visits by Royal Air Force aircraft to Dhofar to see His Highness. PERSIAN SIDE. Bushire District. —The Iranian Authorities continued their work of establishing order in the districts of Tangistan, Dashti, Daliki and the Hinterland between Bushire and Lingah. The main motor routes, e.g., Bushire-Shiraz, remained safe, but a certain amount of brigandage conti nued in the outlying districts. Persian Navy. —The Iranian Navy continued its chief dtity of prevent ing smuggling by sea but effected no important captures. Unlike in 19d5, when no incidents occurred of Iranian sloops interfering with the dhows of the Arab Shaikhdoms, this year two cases of such interference occurred. These were reported to His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, who took them up with the Iranian Government. No satisfaction has been obtained in the first case, which was the holding up of, and firing on, a Kuwait dhow by an Iranian armed launch near Lingah. In the second case, where an Iran.an Customs launch seized oft Bandar Abbas an Omam dhow proceeding fmn Khasab to Dibai, the dhow, crew and passengers were subsequently released 1 but two rifles on board were retained. Relations with local Iranian These continued to be most friendly. T. C. FOWLE, Political 'Resident in the Persian GvJf. 46(C) ExAffairsDeptchapter 1.

Besides silver coins and gold ornaments which smugglers took out of the country, they took away Iranian currency notes for the purchase of their requirements of foreign exchange, as a result of which a quantity of Irani an currency notes collected on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf. The Iranian Government prohibited the importation of these into the country and took steps, throucrh the Banks, to collect all the silver currency which was in circulation. They met with little success, however, as most of the currency notes found their way back into the country. Govrenment measures for discouraging the smuggling of contraband goods. 1. Sugar Com/pany. —This Company which was formed last year conti nued selling loaf and crystal sugar for public consumption in Bushire and district. The Tangistanis, however, discontinued their purchases of sugar in May and the Sugar Company was unable to compete with smugglers who supplied the Tangistan market with these articles to the end of the year. 2. Tea Company. —On the 1st October, at the instance of the Governor, a Company was formed by the local merchants for the sale of Iranian Gov ernment monopoly tea. The capital of the Company was fixed at Rials 500,000 (£6,250), of which 25 per cent, was paid by the Sugar Company and the balance by those of the local merchants and traders who were for merly dealing in tea. The Company, however, was not supplied with tea up to the end of the year under reference. 3. Company for the sale of Piecegoods. —This Company which was formed last year remained inactive the whole year through as it was not supplied with any piecegoods up to the end of the year. 4. Monopolisation of Wheat supplies. —In September the Revenue De partment, Bushire, notified that the sale and purchase of wheat supplies had been made a Government monopoly and began buying wheat from the peasantry at the following prices :— Ist Class at Rials 130 per 315 kilos. (£1 125. 6d. per 6 cwts. 98 lbs.). 2nd Class at Rials 120 per 315 kilos. (£1 lOs. Od. per 6 cwts. 98 lbs.). 3rd Class at Rials 110 per 315 kilos. (£1 7^. (kZ, per 6 cwts. 98 .lbs.). 4th Class at Rials 100 per 315 kilos. (£1 55. Od. per 6 cwts. 98 lbs.) They classified the wheat as 1st and 2nd Class and sold it at Rials 145 (£1-16-3) and Rials 125 (£1-11-3) respectively per 315 kilos. 5. Monopolisation of Araq (local liquor). —On the 28th October the Revenue Department took possession of the available stocks of Araq and began selling it at Rials 6 {Ish. 6 d-) a bottle as against Rials 9 {\sh. 9d.) as sold previously by the Jews. 6. Monopolisation of Tobacco. —In the beginning of December the Revenue Department declared that the sale and purchase of tobacco had been made a Government monopoly and commenced buying tobacco from stockholders and opened two shops to sell the article at Rials 2-50 {7\d.) a lb. 7. Prohibition of the cultivation of Opium. —During the year under review 7 the Revenue Department posted a Notice in the Town and district that the cultivation of poppies for producing opium was prohibited and raised the banderole tax on opium making the price of a misqual (1/lGth oz.) of opium Rials 2 in order to make it prohibitive for opium smolccTs and opium eaters and so force them to abandon the habit.The measures taken by the Iranian authorities for the suppression of the smuggling of contraband goods helped to discourage the smuggling of sugar into Bushire town and certain parts of the district and perhaps in Lingah town. The smuggling of contraband goods, such as imitation silk, piecegoods, haberdashery and, in some instances, rifles and ammunition, was successfully carried out through the Iranian ports and the goods were taken to towns and cities in the interior via Farrashband and i ; irnzabad (78 and 105 miles respectively east of Bushire) and also through Laristan. The smugglers' caravans were protected by strong riflemen who in almost all instances defeated the Amnieh (Road Guards) and inflicted losses on them. Bv the end of the year the Amnieh had lost 20 men ^.nd they had, in one instance only, succeeded in killing 9 of the smugglers riflemen and wounding 2. In October it was decided, on account of their inefficiency and corruption, to take the duty of suppressing smuggling from the Amnieh authorities and to leave it in the hands of the Military authorities. The total amount of contraband goods seized by the officials of the Customs Preventive Department came to 1,438 packages of sugar, tea, tobacco, matches and sundries, and 6 smugglers' dhows, 13 smugglers and Rials 14,800 in Iranian currency notes. Roads and Communications. 1. Bnshire-Shiraz Road. —At the instance of His Excellency Amanul- lah Ardelan, the Governor of Bushire, this road was inspected by the Assistant to the Minister of Roads and m November a contract was given to the Deka Company to build the Bushire-Borazjan portion of it. 2. The installation of the wireless transmitting set which was brought to Bushire in May, 1935, was completed by a French engineer in the employ of the Iranian Government in June 1936 when an engineer of the Royal Dutch Air mail service (K. L. M.) found it to have been dangerously situ ated for aeroplanes landing at the airport. He made a protest and the set was removed to a spot H miles east of the aerodrome. In November 3 Iranian wireless officers arrived here and set zealously to work to carry out the installation of two wireless masts and complete the station—their aim being to prove the futility of the Iranian Government 's employing foreign engineers for the purpose. Another wireless set with an engineer was sent to J ask to complete a wireless station there. r 3 On the 15th July Captain Doulatshahi, an Iranian Aviation Officer, arrived here and commenced levelling the landing ground to make it suitable for Iranian aeroplanes, which it was said, would carry mails between Tehran -Isfahan -Shiraz-Bushire from the 21st March 1937 Iranian air postage stamps were brought and sold at the Post Office. In August two Trannn aeroplanes, each carrying an officer and a mechanic, arrived here on inspection duty and after seeing the landing ground went back to Tehran About the same time the Post Office. Bushire, published a Notice fn the local weekly the 'Khalij-i-Iran' intimating that an air mad senoce m the lQcai e , •• t d j n Iral , to carry mails, once a week between Tdir^lifan ShSnshfre and twice a week tetween Tehran-Hama- Tehran -lslanan . inauguration of the service, which was'JroSd to be promulgated later on. remained unknown to the end of 1116 Chamber of -Having found his first suggestion for build- - Tntor dhows to run between the Iranian ports unacceptable to the mg ten ^ Fxcellency the Governor, Bushire, moved a resolution in iperchancS ^ ce Bushire, to form a Steam Navigation Company the Ghamber of C^merce^the ^ offered . to invest Rials 000 (CIS 500) in this new Company. The activities of the Chamber nf (OTnnerce were confined to the formation of this Company ^ also nnVher namely a branch of the Company for the sale of Motor Vehicles, Tehran' at Bushire. None of these Companies, however, materialised by5 the end of the year. In fact the formation of the first Company was sup planted by another called the 'la'timadieh Weaving and Spinning ^ 011 j' panv, Bushire,' the formation of which Mr. Agar, Husain Aqa la tima , of the firm of Haji Ali Akbar Shirazi and Sons, Manchester, had suggested to the local merchants when he visited Bushire in July. The Governor a this time being Aqai Ahmad Sadri, and the merchants being more in iavour of this new Company than the Steamship Navigation Company, wliicn they could not control, obtained sanction from the Lential Governmeii; or the importation of a weaving and spinning plant and another tor d y ei ^S purposes. All these had been brought in by the end of December and the construction of a house, bought outside the town for installing the plan , was being accelerated. Education. —The local school examinations were held on the 1st March and 57 students sat for the examinations. The budget allotment of the Education Department, Bushire, was put up by Rials 200,000 (£2,500) and sanction was conveyed for the construction of two schools in Lmgah and Charbar at a cost of Rials 200,000 (£2,500). The Education Department, Bushire had made arrangements in the local schools at Bushire and the Iranian'ports for some 2,600 illiterates to be taught to read and write. They were instrumental in encouraging the discarding of the veil and in November introduced public speaking on ordinary educational subjects. They made some progress in collecting 5 per cent, out of the rent ot ^aq properties (religious endowment properties). Bushire Munici-pality.—The Municipal Council could not resume the work of levelling the town streets because of a deficit in its budget allot ment. It retained a staff of 70 persons to look after the sanitation and lighting of the town. It also retained ten beds for the lying-m ward of the poor of the town in the local infirmary, a local Doctor to look after the patients free of charge, a local Government school, a small asylum for a few lunatics and an isolated house for accommodating some 20 lepers. Only in June did the Council interest itself in market prices and fixed! the price of a pound of mutton at Cts. 70 instead of Cts. 80 previously. The Council received its budget allotment of Rials 25,000 a month, although irregularly. SECTION 4.. MILITARY AND MARINE. Army. —In January Brigadier-General Ibrahim Zand, the Officei Commanding the Army Division of lars, visited Bushire on inspection. The Recruiting Office, Bushire, re-opened with its members, viz., the Governor as President, a Doctor from the Iranian Navy, another from the Iranian Military Department, the Imam-i-Jumah, two local merchants and the Head of the Police Department. Its branches also re-opened in the districts. The names of youths who had attained military age weie notified, exemption papers of others were examined and some 200 jouths were sent from Bushire to Khorramshahr to join the Iranian Navy ana an equal number sent to the Military Barracks, Bushire. In Eebruary a plot of land was bought outside the town and the con struction of a Military Barracks, large enough for a regiment, proceeded with. The Military Authorities commandeered almost all the labourers available and at times they took away labourers from the gangs that were employed by Mr. Agar for the construction of his factory. Building mate rials also were commandeered making it difficult for the inhabitants as well as the Iranian Wireless Telegraph Authorities to complete their .Wireless Station. The strength of the Bushire Garrison remained at 600 under the command of Major Niknam who relieved Major Qotbi on the 23rd March. 46(C) ExAffa'rsD^pt,6 A^ l A ment 0 f T J lhes '—^ Military Authorities continued with re- T«r sev f er y ^ Collect arnis from the peasantry in Dashti, Dashtistan ana langistan.

As a result of these net nods 50 langistanis and Dashtis came into Bushire and complained bitterly against the Military Authorities and their methods of collecting arms, it was, however, often heard that the Tangistanis or the Dashtis smuggled arms and ammunition into their districts for themselves or their clients and malcontents.

During the first week of October an Italian construction engineer in the employ of the Iranian Government arrived here and began^buildin a foundation for a lighthouse at a soot on the coast 3 miles south of Bushire town. The construction of a small house, consisting of 3 rooms, was also begun at the same time. They were not completed by the end of the year. SECTION 5. AVIATION., 21 British aviators passed through Bushire during the year. French and Dutch. —The Air France maintained their weeklv service throughout the year. The Royal Dutch Air Lines continued their bi weekly service up to October when they began to fly direct between Basrah and J ask instead of visiting Bushire. Occasionally, however, one or two ot their aeroplanes landed at Bushire for passengers who had booked before hand. SECTION 6. POLITICAL SITUATION. During the year under review the Military Authorities in charge of Dashti, Dashtistan and Tangistan had a number of outlaws, with more or less large followings, to deal with. While the main Bushire-Shiraz route remained secure, off it a certain amount of brigandage went on in the way of raids on villages and caravans and encounters with Amnieh guards and Customs officials. By the end of the year some of the brigands had been accounted for while others remained at large. The discarding of the veil by women was rigorously taken up durino- the year by the local authorities acting under orders from Tehran, and various methods of pressure were brought to bear towards this end. Gene rally speaking the change has been accepted fairly philosophically. The women, at any rate the younger and more good-looking of thera, show no objection to exposing their faces. Some of the husbands object but mainly —it is said—on financial grounds. As long as their wives wore the all- enveloping chaddar little possibility of feminine competition in dress wag possible. With the abolition of the chaddar, however, this competition has now begun and to dress their wives costs husbands considerably more.SECTION 7., MANUMISSION.; During 1936 the following number of slaves was manumitted : — Bahrain Agency 7 Muscat Agency ......... ^ Sharjah Agency . , 7 C.

General state of Trade. —During 1936 the trade situation of Bushire gradually worsened and there are few if any signs which might encourage the belief that any marked improvement will take place in the near future. Formerly Jiushire merchants imported goods on their own account for local consumption but now that control of foreign exchange by the Grovernment and a higher Customs tariff have been added to other restrictive measures on their part merchants have practically given up the unequal struggle against such Governmental interference with private trade and have become mere forwarding agents for importers in the interior of the country. Con sequently the bulk of the goods landed at Bushire are simply in transit and extremely little merchandise remains for local consumption. This accounts for the paradox that the economic condition of Bushire and the Hinterland is deteriorating whilst the total volume of imports through the port of Bushire has increased in many lines. Bushire is thus much more of a channel for trade with the interior rather than a market in itself. There has been and still is great congestion in the Customs and every available foot of space is being utilised. Cases are piled one on top oi the other and the resultant chaos becomes progressively worse as every in coming steamer discharges its cargo. Extra space has been taken over by the Customs authorities in an endeavour to ease the situation but without visible result. The reason for this state of affairs is the great difficulty experienced by importers in obtaining foreign exchange from the Exchange Commission in Tehran in order to retire their accepted bills from the banks and thus clear their goods. The consequence of this lack of foreign ex change is to be seen in the accumulation of uncleared goods in the Customs. A contributory cause is the dearth of labourers to deal with cargo alreadv discharged due to disputes about wage rates. Owing to this state of affairs steamers are sometimes obliged to overcarry their cargo. Smuggling continues practically unchecked and results in considerable loss of revenue. It is a natural corollary of the fiscal policy of the Govern ment ana can only be eliminated by a change m that policy in the direction of reduced duties and abolition of the embargo on various imports. A law which came into force in July provided that smugglers should be tried by court-martial and the death penalty inflicted on armed smugglers who resisted arrest; lighter sentences would be given to those who surrendered. This law has, however, produced no deterrent effect. The sort of articles mostly smuggled into the country are tea, sugar, piecegoods, clothing, etc. The preventive agents themselves are said to connive actively at this traffic and to this fact must be ascribed the smugglers' comparative immunity t rom capture and punishment and the consequent thriving nature of the traffic. However, that may be, the availability of contraband eroods makes living conditions easier for the population than they otherwise would be and no doubt saves the people from being driven to complete despair.A new customs tariff was brought into force on the 21st May. Under this new tariff duties mostly based on weight superseded those of the old tariff which were on an ad valorem basis. Heavy increases of duty were imposed on many articles from abroad with smaller increases on foodstuffs. This resulted in a good deal of profiteering by local retailers who simply added the increased duties to the price of goods previously imported by them. No attempt was made by the local authorities to stop this practice. Additional monopolies created during the year were in respect of wheat, tea, motor cars, lorries and their spare parts. The creation of these Government monopolies on foodstuffs and other articles of necessity docs not mean cheaper living for the people as might reasonably be expect ed. On the contrary the cost of living continues to rise and discontent to grow. Tor instance tea formerly cost 15-50 rials per packet of 500 grammes whereas the price in December had risen to 20 rials per packet. Other commodity prices have also risen, such as fat for cooking the price of which in December was 35 rials per 'man' of 7-75 lbs. whereas the cost in January 1936 was 23-00 rials per man; meat which cost 7-20 rials per man in January 1936 was 8-25 rials per man in December and so on. Towards the end of the year a start was made on the erection in Bushire of a cotton weaving and spinning mill. This will provide sorely needed work for the people and tend to stop migration to other places which had already set in. The erecting work will demand about 1,500 labourers and the mill when in operation will ease the economic situation, by absorbing a considerable number of work people as operatives. Imports from the United Kingdom were on the whole well maintained during the year although the position can hardly be regarded with equani mity. Price continues to be the determining factor rather than quality and will continue to be so until some measure of prosperity returns to this region. A new opening for British trade in cheap ready-made clothing, footwear, haberdashery, etc., was given by the Government decree ordering the unveiling of women and their compulsory adoption of European cloth ing. Competition in these lines however is bound to be of the keenest and here again if they wish to secure a portion of this trade United Kingdom manufacturers must keep constantly before them the price question. Direct imports from India are declining. The only remaining import on a considerable scale from India is tea of which 31,094 cases were import ed through Bushire in 1936 compared with only 5,227 cases in the preced ing year. Tea imports from the Dutch East Indies were 2,035 cases in 1936 and only 76 cases in 1935; imports from Japan were 4,670 cases in 1936 as against 2,160 cases in the preceding year. These figures show that India supplies by far the largest proportion of tea imports into Iran but there is growing competition from Dutch and Japanese suppliers. The larjje increase in the imports of tea in 1936 was due to the laying in of heavy stocks by the Government under the newly created monopoly of this article. Japanese commercial penetration continues. Besides her well-known domination of the piecegoods market she is also making serious inroads into the trade of other countries in cement, crockery, tea, etc. She seems likely to maintain her trade position as long as buyers consider price and not quality. They will no doubt continue to do so until prosperity returns to this area and thus enable them to purchase higher grade goods. German trade has increased as a result of the Irano-German clearing agreement made towards the end of 1935. This is evidenced by the increas- iu y number of German steamers arriving from Europe. Germany supplies mostly ironware, machinery, haberdashery, dyes, etc., and seems likely to continue to increase her imports into Iran. Imports from the Soviet Union were for the most part sugar and matches. Of the former 122,867 bags of loaf susrar were imported direct from Odessa during the year compared with 49,832 in 1935. There was.9 however a large decrease in import of crystal sugar in 1936 as compared with 1935 the figures being 5,500 bags and 24,990 bags respectively. As regards matches 2,507 cases were imported in 1936 as against 3,623 cases in 1935. These articles represent practically the only imports from this source through the port of Bushire. Exports from Bushire were fairly good and did not show any appre ciable change compared with 1935 except as regards tobacco (1,764 bales) of which there was no export in 1935. Gum Tragacanth, skins, carpets, wheat and almonds were exported on a considerable scale but the export of these articles either has been or is shortly to be confined to monopoly companies. Private traders have thus lost their last source of profit as such and now act merely as forwarding agents. Foreign Exchange. —In January the exchange rate was 95-33 rials to the pound sterling and 7-15 rials for one rupee. In February it advanced to 101-50 rials and 7-66 rials per pound and rupee respectively. On March 1st, however, the Government suddenly introduced a law to control foreign exchange transactions under which the rial was arbitrarily stabilised at 80 to the pound sterling and 6 to the rupee. Only two banking institutions were authorised under this law to deal in foreign exchange, i.e., the Banque Melli Iran and the Imperial Bank of Iran. The object of this law was to restrict as much as possible imports of non-essentials from abroad by the device of withholding permits for the purchase of foreign exchange in res pect of all but approved goods. This control although most unpopular with all sections of the population was still in force at the end of the year. Shipping. —Shipping in the Persian Gulf has tended to increase. Besides the usual services maintained by the British India Steam Naviga tion Company a new comer appeared towards the end of the year namely the Java Silver Pacific Line which has inaugurated a monthly direct service be tween Batavia and the Gulf Ports. The German Hansa Line now runs a fortnightly service to the Gulf from Hamburg and one steamer in the opposite direction every three weeks instead of the monthly service hitherto maintained. The increase in this German service appears to be a result of the Irano-German trading agreement concluded in 1935. There are four Japanese steamship lines now operating in the Gulf, namely the Mitsui Bussan Kaisha, Yamashita Line, Osaka Shosen Kaisha; Nippon Yuscn Kaisha. Other steamship lines maintaining a service between European ports and the Gulf are the Strick and Ellerman and Bucknall Lines. Apart from these regular lines Italian and Greek steamers occasionally make their appearance. Attempts were made during the year to form a national steamship line for service between the Gulf ports and local merchants were urged to supply some of the capital required. The attempt however proved fruitless and the project seems to have been abandoned. Roads and Transport. —Transport rates by motor lorry from Bushire to Shiraz were 90 rials per kharvar (654 lbs.) in the spring, 60 rials per kharvar in the summer and again 90 rials in the autumn and winter. The difference in these rates is accounted for by the heavy going in winter. Camel transport between these two points averaged 45—50 rials during the year but the time taken is anything from 2—3 weeks. Owino; to lack of rain the Mashileh escaped the usual winter inunda tion and Bushire in consequence was not once cut off from the interior during the latter part of the year. This, however, was purely a matter of chance and Bushire cannot expect to be so fortunate every year. The authorities realise this and work is to begin in 1937 on the construction of an all-weather causeway across this low-lying strip of land to overcome this drawback. It is an urgently needed piere of work and it is to lie hoped that there will be no further procrastination in carrying it out,, 46(0) ExAffairsDepi10 Nil 200 cases to Dairen. 100 „ London. 100 ..

The only real road in Bushire, i.e., that leading out of the town to wards iSabzabad was under repair at the end of the year. The work is, however, of a superficial nature and only about half a dozen men with a hand-roller were employed on it. The road is already showing signs of breaking up again. There is still no internal air service connecting Bushire with inland towns such as Shiraz, Isfahan and Tehran. Opium Shipments. —The following shipments took place in 1936; they were all stated to be for legitimate consumption J anuary February March . April May June July July August September October November December December Total The cases are of a standard weight of 160 lbs- These shipments represent a decrease of about 50 per cent, compared with 1935. Roughly three-quarters of them went to the Far East. The average price per case was £115. The shrinkage in export appears to have been due to China preferring to obtain her supplies from Turkey at lower prices than those quoted bv Iran. Isevcrtheless the statistics show that about 75 per cent, of a dimi nished export went to the Far East in 1936 as compared with 1935 when the total shipments for legitimate consumption were 2658 oases of which only 500 cases or about 20 per cent, went to the Far East. It is estimated that there were about 850 cases of opium in stock in Bushire at the end of the year awaiting buyers. Rumours were current during the year that the Government were going to reduce or abolish altogether the export tax (£25 per case) in order to en courage exports. If the Government considered the question at all they apparently thought better of it because nothing had been done about the tax by the end of the year. So far as is known there were no shipments for illegitimate consump tion during the period under review. A ttitude of local population. —The local population remains quite pas sive in spite of their hard lot and there is no sign of unrest anywhere. Dis content is widespread but it has not assumed a vocal form. The people seem to be too steeped in oriental fatalism to exert themselves to bring about an improvement in their conditions of life. Even if they could temporarily throw off their inertia and organise a series of protests the ringleaders would be speedily 'liquidated' by the authorities who would not brook any such manifestations of popular discontent. This bein'- so it is extremely unlikely that such discontent will show itself in the form of riots or stieet demonstrations unless the people are goaded into action bv the authorities. How far the screw would have to be applied to produce such action is impossible to forecast. llth March 19S7. (Signed) FRAOT H.

I Class Assistant Surgeon, M. L. A. Steele, I.M.D., was in sub- charge throughout the year. Nothing of note occurred during the year. The weather throughout the year was average for the Persian Gulf. There were no epidemics.

S., Residency Surgeon.15 CHAPTER IL NOTE ON EVENTS IN MISHUN AND GACH QARAGHULI AREAS .DURING 1936. Geological and Seismic. —Consequent upon a decision to retest the Gach Qaraghuli area geological and seismic work was carried out during the spring in order to define the structure and choose drilling locations. .This work was completed by May and the final locations settled by the middle of the year.. Roads. —At the same time that geological work was proceeding work on reconditioning the road between Ganoweh and Gach Qaraghuli was put in hand to make it suitable for the modern heavy transport. In addition to this line of communications from the south, a road was constructed from Gach Qaraghuli through Gach-i-Pokak to the North-West to connect up with the Iranian Government road from Behbehan. This road was then extended beyond Behbehan to connect up with our operations in Pazanun thus giving through access to the Iranian railway running from Bandar Shapur to Ahwaz and to our headquarters in Masjid-i-Sulaiman. Buildings. —The old buildings that were in existence at Ganoweh and Gach Qaraghuli have been reconditioned and put into commission. In addition a considerable number of new living quarters have been built at Gach Qaraghuli to house the staff that it has been necessary to put into the area to carry out the drilling programme. A transit shed has been erected at Ganoweh. Stores, workshop and garage facilities have been extended and modernised at Gach Qaraghuli. Water-supply. —The old 2-inch line and small water pumps delivering water from the Zuhra river to Gach Qaraghuli were recommissioned and at the same time a larger line and pumps were installed to cope with the in creased demands of a modern rotary drilling campaign. Supplies. —A total of 5,500 tons of material have been moved into the area during the year by mechanical transport, of which 4,300 tons was transferred via Ganoweh and 1,200 tons via Pazanun and Behbehan. Wireless communications. —The wireless station at Ganoweh still ope rate for direction finding purposes as well as for ordinary traffic. The wireless station at Gach Qaraghuli at present operates on Morse only. It is intended to replace the existing plant by a duplex telephony set. Drilling. —An old gas well was cleaned out and brought on production to supply fuel for all purposes. An old oil well has been prepared for deepening. A new well has been drilled from surface and a depth of 1,200 feet has been reached. It is not known how deep we shall have to go to reach our objective. Staff- —The following staff is employed in the area:— European • 28 Clerical ........... 30 Artizans and labourers ........ 684 Contract labour ......... 748 Welfare.—No trouble of any sort was experienced with the local in habitants until 20th December when a car containing 3 European passen gers proceeding from Ganoweh to Gach Qaraghuli was shot at and one of the passengers was severely wounded in the head by gunshot fire. A bag gage car following was stopped and the luggage rifled.16 CHAPTER III. SUMMARY OF EVENTS AND CONDITIONS IN THE PROVINCE OF EARS, DURING THE YEAR 1936. General situation. —The situation has remained quiet and the Central Government has continued to extend its influence in the economic develop ment of the Province. Few visitors of importance have been seen in Shiraz during the year 1936. The Minister of Finance left early in January„ promising to consider measures for the improvement of agriculture, trade, communications, irrigation and the system of collection of taxes, and a new era of prosperity was to dawn in which air-mail, Government aid in all trading ventures, and the exploitation of the mineral wealth of the Pro vince would play their part. So far nothing has materialised of all this except for an order for two hundred carpets for use in Government offices in Tehran which rumour has it have not been paid for. The population of Ears is now said to exceed 400,000. Of these 200,000 are tribesmen, 80,000 settled in villages, and 120,000 in Shiraz. The population of the town has increased in the last few years as people arrive from outlying districts to seek for work. Much of the otherwise idle population has been set to work on the building of barracks and mili tary installation on which 50,000,000 rials are said to have been spent. In spite of the considerable wealth of numbers of the Shirazis, progress has been slow in those things which are held in account today in Iran. Tribal disturbances of former years have led to disfavour in the eyes of Government and consequent lack of attention and support. The visit of His Majesty the Shah to Shiraz, accompanied by the Vali- ahd was awaited from the summer up to the end of the year without great enthusiasm. The Army practised organised cheering in order that a suitably spontaneous welcome might be given to him. The Municipal authorities at one time showed feverish activity in the preparation of roads and beautification of the approaches to the town, but it was given out that no money was to be spent on decoration, doubtless to the great relief of shopkeepers and others on the route. As the Government enters more and more deeply into the everyday life of the people, the protection afforded from the attentions of former Gover nors or tribal leaders is outweighed by the nuisance of restrictions. The Shah is probablv held responsible for this and is feared accordingly, while respect due for his organising ability has been largely lost as it is felt that all the wealth of the country is being attracted to the Capital. The policy of industrial development is, however, realised to be of advantage to the Province of Ears which now has a lucrative outlet for production of cotton for the spinning mills of Isfahan and Shiraz and of beet for the sugar factory situated 25 miles to the north of Shiraz, which is now producing supplies for local use. The Qawam -ul-mulk's son married the Shah's younger daughter during the year. Though some of the Qawam's supporters hope for some advan tage from the union, it is regarded as an indication of Imperial designs on property in Ears. The Principal Provincial officials at present have connections in the highest quarters and little local sympathy. A new Governor-General ar rived early in the year, who is related to one ot the Shah s wives. His rousin is in charge of the Finance Department. The Director of the Mum- dtrilitv is a brother of one of the highest officials in the Ministry for Foreian Affairs. The General Officer in command of the troops, who wields the highest influence in the Province, has now held the post for several years. None of these officials has any personal interest in K-hiraz or in the Province.17 Foreign residents are still apt to be treated with suspicion by local offi cials, though an outward semblance of friendship is maintained. But offi cials in general and notables are prohibited from dealings with the Consu late. No incidents have occurred during the year in which foreign subjects were involved. The attempt at westernisation of the country has proceeded vigorously in Shiraz. Following on the imposition of European dress on dwellers in town and village, the unveiling of women has been accomplished almost universally and with surprising absence of disturbance. The 'chuddur'* is practically never seen in the streets of Shiraz now. Such women as object, mostly of the older generation, keep to their houses. Any opposi tion which there may have been seems to have died down. Early in the year receptions were given at which officials and members of guilds and trades paraded with their wives. Public baths and conveyances were closed to veiled women, but the example set by the womenfolk of the large garri son did much to effect the change amongst the civilian population. There are still a good many mullahs to be seen about in turban and abba but the number has been reduced. Their influence and prestige seems for the present to have disappeared with the transfer of many of their func tions to other administrative departments and the prohibition of public religious observances such as muharram processions and public prayers. The attention of the younger generation has been turned to athletics, football and other outdoor games. A Boy Scout troop, 700 strong, has been organised in Shiraz which received the visit of colleagues from Isfahan towards the close of the year. Military drill has been taught to the senior members of the High School by instructors from the local barracks. Tribal affairs. —Nothing of note has occurred during the year amongst the Qashgai or Khamseh tribes. At the end of the year there were rumours of restlessness amongst the Boir Ahmedi of Kuhgilu, who resent the activi ties of the authorities to settle the tribes in defined areas. Very little pro gress has been made as yet in actual settlement except at Tul-i-Khosrau where buildings have been put up as permanent dwellings for nomad settlers. The tribes are all controlled under military governors, but much migration still takes place at the usual seasons. The economic consequen ces of complete prohibition are doubtless realised. Road Guard services have been extended still more during the year and security exists on all the main roads, except for occasional incidents in remoter districts. The Qawam-ul-mulk has married his eldest son to a daughter of the Shah. It is believed that they may take up residence in Shiraz. The Qawam himself together with many of his near relatives and those of the late Saulet-ed-douleh continues to live in Tehran. The Qawam's munshi bashi, a wealthy man, who disappeared in 1935 and was given out to have been murdered or to have committed suicide, is believed to be in prison in Tehran. His house at Shiraz was taken over by the Governor-Geueral, for use as his headquarters. Local administration. —The five members of the Mejliss for Fars con tinue to be Mohammed Mehdi Nemazian (formerly Nemazi), Hadji Ghulam Hussein Malek, Mohammed Taqi Shankai Shirazi, Ahmed Kawami and Hadji Seyyed Abu Taleb Kazeruni. His Excellency Abul Fath Doulatshahi arrived early in the year as Governor -General of Fars, his predecessor having been appointed Minister of Communications. He was previously for many years Governor of Tehran. He is less popular in the Province and less energetic than his predecessor, while his personal debts and habits do not enhance the respect due to his position. Action has been taken against him in the Courts by his creditors and complaints against his grasping tendencies have gone to Tehran. He incurred unpopularity, the Shirazi being a lover of art, by 46(C) ExAffairsDeptordering the removal of the old Quran Gate at the entrance to Shiraz from Isfahan, which has been a well-known landmark for centuries. He has made many empty promises to the merchant community regarding the im provement of roads, joining up with the Trans-Iranian railway system, and the financing of agricultural schemes. Though a connection of the Kajar family, he is related to one of the Shah's wives and owes his position to rank and influence. Soon after his arrival, the Governor-General visit ed the Kazerun, Fasa and Lar districts. Since then he has never under taken another tour in the Province except for private amusement with his gun. Dealings between the Consulate and the Governorate-General have been confined throughout the year to routine matters and have been friendly. Apart from the Deputies mentioned above, no official visitors .of im portance came to Shiraz during the year. Members of the Government appear to have lost interest in Fars. Exceptions were Sar Lashkar Jehan- bani. Head of the Department of Industry, and Aqai Bayat, Head of the Department of Agriculture, who both visited the cotton factory at Shiraz and the sugar refinery at Merv Dashi in the Spring and toured the Pro vince. Most of the Provincial heads of departments on the other hand went to Tehran at some time or other during the year. Local officials have done little to attract the attention of the Consulate. Most of the Directors of Departments remained the same, the only changes being in the Police Department and in the Census Department. The Municipality all through the year has been under the direction of Aqa Soheily, brother of a high official in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs who has been mentioned as a possible future Iranian Minister in London. He appears to share the unpopularity of the Governor-General and for similar reasons. His dealings with the public leave much to be desired. The year 1936 saw a large slice cut through the middle of the Bazar-i-vekil as part of the scheme for carrying the Khiaban-i-Zand through from north to south of the town. After much demolition work was stopped for lack of further funds : so a large part of the Bazaar remains in ruins and is a collecting place for water and malarial mosquitos. The Khiaban has also been continued for some miles south of the town and several houses built—mostly for the use of military and civil officials. This is said to be the beginning of a through road to Ahwaz. The road from Isfahan has been widened at the entrance to Shiraz (to the discomfiture of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company which has had to modify its plans for erecting a new depot by 'arrangement' with the Director of the Municipality after prolonged negotiations), and the old Quran Gate, which was alleged to impede traffic, has been removed by dynamite, for it was found impracticable to transfer it piecemeal to another site, as had been intended. As the traffic is in any event stopped by the Police close to the site of the Gate, it is not appreciat ed why its removal was necessary. Its main crime seems to have been its antiquity. The thousand-year old quaran which it housed has been placed in the local Museum. An ornamental almond and fruit garden has been laid out near the site of the Gate. The Imperial Bank of Iran has had to postpone the erection of a new building as land bought for the purpose has been cut in two by the municipal road-making schemes. The road to the Tomb of Hafiz has been remade and work is in progress on a road to the Tomb of Sa'adi. The reconstruction of the entire enclo sure of the Tomb of Hafiz has been commenced and the Education Depart ment is building an expensive granite monument with a gallery of twenty columns. A large cemetery in the same neighbourhood is being laid out as a public garden, the headstones being used for making terraces. A site has been purchased in the town for a new Municipal Hospital. An Orphanage, arrangements for which were made by the late Governor- General, was opened during the year by the Municipality. Beggars are again on the increase.lO 1 The Chief of the Provincial Police was dismissed in the summer for corrupt practices along with the Chief of the J own Police. His successor died shortly after his arrival. The present Chief of Police is a courteous and pleasant individual, transferred from Hamadan. He is very interest ed in traffic control and exercises efficient control in the Bazaars. Burgla ries have been less prevalent during 1936 than in former years and the discipline of the Force seems to be good. The Finance Department has been in charge of a cousin of the Gover nor-General throughout the year. The visit of the Minister of Finance at the close of 1935 has had little effect in Fars, as few of his promises have been carried into effect. The Agricultural Taxes have been collected un remittingly all through the year. The Opium Monopoly Office has had a quiet year owing to partial failure of the crops and towards the end of the year it was announced that cultivation of opium poppies was to be stopped and cotton to be grown in its place under the direction of the Cotton Monopoly Company. No new Public Works have been put in hand during the year. One of the main avenues through Shiraz has been continued westwards as far as Masjid-i-badi to form the commencement of a through road to Ahwaz. When it was announced that the visit of the Shah was to be expected patch ing operations were begun on the Isfahan road. Various unmetalled roads were made in the Merv-Dasht plain to facilitate collection of beet toi the new sugar factory. Spasmodic work was done on the Shiraz-Bushire road. As machinery for the new factories is being brought into the country by Bushire to avoid the congestion of Khorremshahr, it will be necessary to keep the road in a better state of repair and possibly the problem of crossing the 'mashileh' may be tackled. But in the meanwhile the road is steadily deteriorating as is evidenced by the fact that the general rate of hire for motor transport from Bushire to Shiraz is double that on other roads in Iran. The road was inspected early in the year by the Director of the Road Department of the Ministry of Communications. Mechanical transport has been brought under stricter Government control during the year. Public omnibus ser vices have been maintained for most of the year between Bushire and Isfahan. m The Postal Services continued to function slowly but reasonably surely. An office was opened at Takht-i-Jamshid (Persepolis) in the summer. The long talked-of airmail service from Tehran seems to have been postponed indefinitely and the existing aerodrome after a considerable sum of money had been spent on its improvement was decided by a joint commission of military officers and officials from the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs to be unsuitable. Military opinion was against its use for any purpose in co-operation with civil authority. Telegraph services are reported to be very inadequate, largely through lack of staff. The Agricultural Department is now largely concerned with the ope rations of the new Government Companies for trade in cotton, skins, wheat, dried fruits, etc. The opium crop having been unsatisfactory and Govern ment having decided to limit production, large areas have^ been planted with cotton and wheat. The total area under cultivation in Fars is said to be about 600,000 hectares. Last year's crop of cotton amounted to 6 million kilogrammes, while 300,000 kilos of opium were produced. Gov ernment buyers did not take the whole stock of opium, but cotton found a ready market for the mills of Isfahan and Shiraz. Supplies of cotton for Russia are also required, as commitments have not been fulfilled. Increased quantities have been planted in the Kazerun and Abadeh areas. Cotton ginnins: plant has been installed at Kazerun and Mamessani, and is on order for Shiraz, Abadeh, Fasa and Jahrum. The Government Grain purchasing organisation bought supplies in the Province and it is said that it is to be sold back to buyers for private20 use at a lower price in order to assist in recovery from the dislocation conse quent on the huge loss of revenue from opium. Temporary grain stores holding 120,000 kharvars (about 34,000 tons) have been erected. They are believed to be half full. A credit of 1,300,000 rials, is reported to be avail able for the construction of Grain Silos by Russian engineers, as in other parts of the country. Rice growing has been prohibited in the district and attempts made with small success to grow cotton instead. Sufficient beetroot was produced locally to supply the wants of the refinery at Merv Dasht which started work in October. By the end of the year excellent sugar was on the market at a price slightly lower than import ed Russian sugar. There was talk of erecting a second factory at Fasa. Fruit trees in parts of the Province were reported in the Spring to be suffering from blight. Unusually cold weather was experienced early in December which will probably have affected the crop of oranges and citrous fruits. Government experts have reported favourably on projects for sinking artisans wells in connection with irrigation schemes. So far nothing has been done. At the end of the year a system of sanitary inspection of animals was approved for the whole of Iran. Cattle disease is very prevalent in Fars. There is nothing to report regarding judicial affairs, the Census De partment, nor the Registration Department. The Education Department has been busy under the Direction of an ex-Army Officer. The Shahpur Boys' High School has been extended and a new school opened at Kazarum. A School of Arts and Crafts with two German instructors was also started in Shiraz. Night classes for adults and weekly lectures have been insti tuted. On the whole there is a better standard of teachers today and pay has improved. A 'Museum of Education' was opened in the old 'Kolah Faranghi' building in the Citadel, which has been restored. Military affairs. —The 7th (Fars) Division, under Sartip Ibrahim Zandieh, has been increased to a total strength of over 10,000 men. More barracks have been under construction throughout Ahe year. The French Military Mission paid a visit to Fars in the Spring. It was rumoured that the Valiahd was to assume command in South Iran, probably with headquarters at Shiraz. A large new building for Military Headquarters has just been completed. The General Officer in Command has twice visit ed Bushire and the Gulf Ports during the year. In October the whole garrison was inspected by Sar Lashkar Murtaza Yazdah Panah. At the end of the year the General twice had to go to Ear in connection with trouble between the Amnieh and local tribes. He is an energetic and effi cient officer. The Amnieh have also been increased in numbers and new posts opened. They were inspected in the Summer by Sartip Ghulam Ali Zand, Officer in Command of Road Guards for Iran, who included the Gulf Ports in his itinerary. On the whole the force appears to be efficient and discipline is maintained, though there were various rumoured irregularities in the Ear district at the end of the year when an officer and several men were arrested for contraband operations. Unrest in Earistan and amongst the Boir Ahmedi tribes has necessi tated visits bv the General Officer in Command of the Fars Division and of the Officer in'Command of Amnieh. Eittle seems to have been done during the year by the various Military Governors to speed up settlement of the tribes. Building continues at Tul-i-Khosrau, but it will be difficult to persuade the Kugilu tribesmen to settle there in any numbers. Economic affairs.—The merchant class in general is dissatisfied with restrictions on trade and the intervention of Government as a trader. This particularly affects the export trade of Fars, which is passing into the21 hands of various Companies which monopolise trade. Exchange Control also has come into force under which the official buying rate for sterling was lixed at 80 rials to the pound and purchase of foreign currency could only be effected by Banks on behalf of the Exchange Control Commission in Tehran, while sales were only under Government permits issued by the Commission after long delay. This has had a detrimental effect on the foreign exchange turnover of Banks and it has seriously affected all import business Silver coinage has been out of circulation for most of the year. Owing to the restrictions on foreign trade, Banks report that current account depo sits have increased considerably. Some of the surplus has been invested in trading companies and industrial enterprises. No new taxes have been introduced during the year, but a new Customs Tariff contained several increases including charges on motor vehicles, im port and working of which has become a Government monopoly. This has not reduced the cost of services to the public, while both new and second hand cars have increased in price. Piecegoods, sugar and tea continue to be the principal imports. They are all handled by monopoly organisations controlled by the Government, in which local merchants have little share. Retailers of piecegoods expect shortly to be put out of business by the opening of shops by the Cotton Piecegoods Monopoly Company. Export of opium has been considerably restricted. Carpets were shipped freely by merchants until the end of the year when all transactions became a monopoly of the Carpet Monopoly Company. Gum tragacanth, almonds and dried fruits have also become the objects of monopolies during the year given to Central Companies m Tehran. Agricultural products in general are now controlled by interests centred in the Capital and most of the profits go there. The following Companies have been reported to have been formed dur ing the last two years to handle commodities of interest to the Shiraz trader :— Sherket-i-Tijareti (general import and export). Sherket-i-Sheker-wa-Cand (sugar and match import and trade, with a subsidiary organisation to handle tea, which is not yet in working order). Sherket-i-Panbeh (growing and export of cotton). Tasbit-i-Ghalleh (wheat growing and purchase). Sherket-i-Pust Narm (export of skins). Sherkat-i-Qumash (import and trade in cotton piecegoods). Sherket-i-Ketirah (export of gum tragacanth and gum arabic). Sherket-i-Khoshkbar (export of dried fruits, almonds, etc.). Sherket-i-Khollar (wine making and trade). Sherket-i-Khal (carpet trade). Sherket-i-Sadaret-i-Fars wa Banader (production and sale of native crafts, /silver, enamel, mosaic work, and hosiery). Most of the principal articles of trade are thus covered by these Com panies. They are not well-managed. Directors and Managers are permit- ted to engage in private trade. They are inclined to behave as though thev were above the Law and injured parties do not.dare to take the matter to the Courts. Large profits are admitted to be made by buying imported goods and holding them off the market. This seems a curious way of spend ing the tax-payers' money which goes to finance such concerns, the control exercised by the Government over these Companies and their policy is loose. Meanwhile all private trade is being throttled, taxes increase, the cost of 46(C) ErAffairsDopt22 living goes up steadily and there is little return to be seen locally except more and more barracks. Industrial development in Shiraz and the Province of Fars has already been mentioned.. The Cotton Spinning Mill at Shiraz, owned by the iars Manufacturing Company, has given very satisfactory results. A dividend of 8(i per cent, was paid on the year's working. Three shifts of operatives, each of 200, are working day and night. Hadji Mohammed Hassan Behbehani, the Managing Director, visited Tehran during the summer and obtained a Government permit for extension of the premises. The build ings have since been erected and it is intended to increase the plant to 10,000 spindles. The necessary exchange permit has been promised by the Ministry of Finance and the order for spinning machinery is probably to go to Piatt Brothers, of Oldham, who supplied the existing plant, and for diesel engines and electrical plant to Mirrlees and the General Electric Co. But some difficulty has arisen over the actual issue of the permits and the machinery cannot for the present be shipped. During the year, the same Company imported' German machinery which has been sold to the Shahriza Company at Isfahan. The second Spinning Mill at Shiraz, owned by the Brothers Dehkan who also own the Fars Electric Company, has installed German machinery which was ready for testing at the end of the year. Large stocks of raw cotton are ready for use. A permit to import British machinery was re fused by the Ministry of Finance. The Electric Power Station succeeded in giving an all-night service during the month of Ramadan. A second Mirrlees diesel motor is expect ed shortly which will improve the already fairly reliable town-lighting. The Merv-Dasht Sugar Refinery, near the Isfahan road some 25 miles north of Shiraz, which was opened in October 1935 commenced work a year later. Local beetroot has been used and by the end of the year sugar was placed on the market. It is of good quality. 40,000 tons of beet are said to be available, giving 18 per cent, of sugar, 7,200 tons of sugar have been produced at the rate of 35 tons per day. But production i6 said to cost 200 per cent, more than the European sugar, c. i. f. Bushire. British interests. —The Consulate was in charge of Mr. H. A. D. Hoy- land. M.B.E., until April 22, when he proceeded on leave prior to transfer handing over to Mr. W. H. Young, Acting Vice Consul. Mr. C. A. Gault arrived from Kermanshah in July and remained in charge until November 21. when Mr. A. E. Watkinson took over on transfer from Ahwaz. The Governor-General of Fars called on His Majesty's Consul on the occasion of the death of His Majesty King George V. Owing to Court Mourning no official celebration took place on the Birthday of His Majesty King Edward VIII. News of the abdication of King Edward in December was reported without comment in the local Press. The fla' was flown on December 14 on the occasion of the Birthday of His Majesty King George VI. During 1936, the Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Secretary to the Political Resident, and the Residency Surgeon, visited Shiraz on recess. Mr. Butler and Mr. Reilly, of His Majesty's Legation at Tehran, also visited Persepolis and Shiraz. His Majesty's Consul at Kerman also passed through Shiraz. Mr. R. F. G. Sarell and Mr. Robert Cecil, Probationer Vice-Consuls, arrived at Shiraz on December 31 to be attached to His Majesty's Consulate as language students. Mr. W. H. Young left for Tehran a few days later. Other British visitors during the year included Brigadier-General Prickett Lord Alington, the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf, the Tehran and Isfahan Managers for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co., and va rious geologists, together with Mr. Schofield, an industrialisation expert, who was touring Iran under the auspices of the Oil Company, members of23 the Church Missionary Society, and an archaeologist and an Indian profes sor. And a large party of students from London camped in the Consulate garden in September, as they were unable to appreciate the accommodation provided for them elsewhere by the local authorities who otherwise did all that could be desired to render their visit profitable and to facilitate their departure. A party of photographers employed by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co visited Persepolis and the Sugar Factory in December and was endea- vourincr to find camels and lorries in close juxtaposition m accordance with modern ideas of advertisement, and to satisfy certain recent Police regula tions. In addition to the above activities, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, sent a large geological expedition to make a survey of the whole area be tween Shiraz and Bandar Abbas and of the Ardakan area in the west of the Province, with a view to determining whether any portion of Pars is to be included in the final concession area. The Company also made arrange ments for the supply of oil in bulk from Bushire to the Sugar Refinery at Marv Dasht and installed large depots with petrol pumps at Kazerun and at Shiraz. It is reported that a motor road is to be made by the Company from Ganawah to Borazjan, which may render them independent of the present tracks over the ''mashileh'. The work of the Church Missionary Society's Hospital at Shiraz has continued successfully. Some difficulty with the Municipal Health Officer was settled by the Governor-General at the request of the Acting Consul. Bishop Thompson visited the district in September and inaugurated a church at Qalat, 25 miles to the north-west of Shiraz. The Pars Manufacturing Company's cotton mill has been mentioned elsewhere. Three English engineers employed there resigned early in the year, as payment of their salaries in accordance with their contract was not in accordance with the new fiscal regulations.. They were replaced by two other English engineers who accepted payment on different terms. Mr. Hussein Agar, of the firm of Hadji Ah Akbar and Sons of Manchester and founder of the tars Manufacturing Companv, was absent in Bushire at the end of the year supervising the erection of another factory, having resigned his post as Director of Govern ment Trading Companies. His son, Mr. Charles Agar, was technical manager of the Shiraz mill throughout the year. The British colony in the district of His Majesty's Consul at Shiraz numbered 123 at the end of the year. Half of these are at Isfahan and half at Shiraz. A considerable amount of the work of the Consulate con sisted in routine matters connected with Isfahan. His Majesty s Consul and the Acting Consul each paid long visits to Isfahan during the year., Arrangements were also made by the Consulate for the lease of houses, payment of rent, engagement of a gardener and guard, and supply of furni ture on behalf of the Honourable the Political Resident. Other activities included an exhaustive report on the production of gum tragacanth for the information of a Cambridge professor and the collection of sample^ of cotton from different parts of the districts for the Institute of Plant Indus try at Indore. Subscriptions were sent by the Acting Consul to the King George Jubilee Trust and- to the Earl Haig's Fund as the result of collections in Isfahan and in Shiraz. Foreign interests. —After the British community, the German colony is the most important in Shiraz. There are two families established for many yearp, one of whom owns a flour mill. The other one was foimerly land agent to the Qawam -ul-mulk. A German is in charge of the Wine Factory controlled by the Government and two Germans are employed at the School of Arts and Crafts under the Education Department. German mechanics are in charge of machinery at the Pars Electric Company's spinning mill24 J. here is an Austrian veterinary surgeon established in Shiraz. An Italian engineer is employed by the Municipality and by the Cotton Monopoly Company. American archaeologists under Professor Schmidt were at Persepolis in the winter of 1935-36, but work had not been resumed by the end of 1936. Ihe Bahrein Oil Company has been endeavouring to obtain houses in Shiraz for summer quarters for their American and European employees. Several Americans visited Shiraz during the summer. They have also been trying to make arrangements for supplies of fruit and other local produce to be shipped from Bushire. It seems unlikely that the difficulties of tran sport and of export regulations will be surmounted. Foreign visitors to the district during the year 1936 included the U. S. S. li. Ambassador and the Italian and Roumanian Ministers from Tehran : the German Minister at Baghdad : the members of the French Air Mission in Tehran and various archaeologists of American, French and Belgian nationality. Miscellaneous remarks. —Active work at Persepolis stopped in October and all the Americans departed, leaving a Russian photographer in charge. Mr. McCown was sent from Rey to be in residence in the event of the Shah's visit taking place, but left again at the end of the year. The Tombs of Darius (Naksh-i-Rustem) can now be reached by car on one of the tracks made for collecting beet. The Louvre Mission was working at Shahpur during part of the year. The maximum temperature recorded in 1936 was 98° in September, as compared with 98° in August of the previous year. The lowest temperature recorded in the winter of 1935-36 was 24°. In mid-December 1936 the ther mometer fell to 22° on several days. The cold was unusually early as well as extreme and some damage was reported to fruit trees, while many early seedlings perished. The rainfall for the winter season of 1935-36 was 4 inches less than in the preceding year. Prospects for the present season indicate even greater shortage of water. &gt; A. S. WATKINSON, His Britannic Majesty's Consul. J3ritish Consulate, Shiraz, January 28, 1937.25 CHAPTER IV. ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE KERMAN AND BANDAR ABBAS CONSULATES FOR THE YEAR 1936. (PART I.j Kerman. 1. Personnel. —Major C. H. Lincoln, O.B.E., returned from leave on the 26th March when he resumed charge of the Kerman and Bandar Abbas Consulates from Captain J. E. A. Bazalgette, the Acting Consul. Major Lincoln paid short visits, on duty, to Bandar Abbas and Shiraz in July and September respectively. 2. British interests. —(i) 20 British subjects were registered at the Consulate during the year. (ii) In September, three loaded motor lorries belonging to Indian dri vers, while passing through Kerman, were commandeered by the Military authorities for the purpose of transporting military stores to Khwash, but these were released when representations were made by the Consulate to the Governor-General. (iii) A quiet and informal tea party was given by His Majesty's Consul on the 23rd June, in commemoration of His Majesty the King's Birthday, to which all British Subjects were invited. Owing to Court mourning no invitations were sent to the local officials and foreigners. 3. Demise of His late Majesty King George V, —On the 25th January, the British community gathered at the Consulate to receive the condolence of the Iranian officials and other local people. His Excellency the Governor- General conveyed his condolence by letter in which he also mentioned his inability to call owing to his indisposition. The only official to attend was the Assistant Governor-General. Over 40 Iranians presented themselves on the occasion and several more would have come had they not been discouraged by the local authorities who went so far as to post three men of the Secret Police to pry round the Con sulate to note the names of those Iranians who attended the function. The same espionage work was noticed on the 26th January when a Special Memorial Service was held at St. Andrew's Church. 4. Imperial Bank of Iran and Trade in General. —Mr. R. C. Fergusson remained in charge of this institution until 22nd September when it closed down on account of the local difficulties arising out of the ever-growing barrier of exchange restrictions and import controls prevalent in the coun^ try. These two factors, coupled with the ever-increasing tendency of the Central Government to introduce as many monopolised Companies as possi ble, and to centralise them at the Capital, have practically killed the inde pendent and individual trading in the province, much to 'the dislike of the people. 5 Church Missionary Society.—(a) General—On his transfer to the Stuart Memorial College at Isfahan, Rev. R. Iliff, M.A., handed over his duties as Chaplain to Rev. M. T. Lord, on the 29th September. {h) Educational.—{i) Boys' School (Dahiristan-i-Jam). —The number or the students attending at the close of the year showed a slight increase over that of the last year. The Rev. R. Iliff, M.A., who was the popular Principal for nearly 8 years was transferred to the Stuart Memorial College, Isfahan in Sep- tember, much to the regret of all in the school. Mr. T. 1 K. Singh, a British Indtan Subject, arrived from Isfahan to assist Rev. M. T Lord who suc ceeded Rev. R. Iliff. 46(C) ExAffairsDept26 Games of all kinds still figure largely in the life of the school. A new feature of interest this year was the production of the play in English of Shakespeare's 'Merchant of Venice'. (ii) Girls' School. —Miss J. F. Woodroffe remained in charge of the school throughout the year under review. The number of girl students steadily increased. ;With the discarding of the veil, the school company of the Girl Guides has been revived. (c) Medical. —Dr. G. E. Dodson, L.R.C.P., M.R.C.S., D.T.M., re mained in charge of the hospital throughout the year. During the year under report the general health of Kerman has been good and no marked epidemics of disease occurred. The work of medical mission continued satisfactorily during the year with but one change in the European staff. There has been a marked in crease in the work all round. The Welfare work was in abeyance in the town after Miss llobinson went on furlough in April, and until Miss Stratton's return in October.. The welfare statistics therefore show a noticeable decline. {d) The Right Reverend Bishop W. J. Thompson, Bishop in Iran, visited Kerman twice during the year. 6. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Limited. —Aqayi Jalil Sohai re mained in charge throughout the year. Ihe business of the Company at Kerman continued to increase in the absence of any foreign competition. Another reason for the increase in question was that the supplies for the Eastern Iranian markets were imported at Kerman via Bandar Abbas, and then forwarded to Zahidan for distribution. Mr. E. Tevoit Ker, accompanied by Mr. G. N. T. Eergusson, who suc ceeded him as the Company's Manager for the Central Iranian Branch of the Company at Isfahan, inspected the Company's depots at Kerman, Bam and Sir]an during April. During the year, Mr. Cox succeeded Mr. lergus- son and was himself succeeded by Mr. Mitchell. Messrs. Cox and Mitchell paid a similar visit in November. A party of Anglo-Iranian Company's geologists from Bandar Abbas passed through Kerman on their way to Isfahan, on 22nd November. 7. Car-pet Trade, The following is a summary of the Kerman carpet and tribal rug trade, with approximate values, exported to United States of America and Europe during the year. The figures for the three preceding years are also shown. Ihe value has been expressed in thousands of Rials. 1933. 1934. 1935. 1936. Kerman carpets and rugs . . • 11,540 11,751 9,o45 9,704 Tribal rugs . ... 930 940 51 245 On the formation of the 'Shirkat-i-Sihami-i-Farsh (C arpet mono polised companv) at Kerman in June, a notice was given to all the indepen dent carpet dealers, most of whom are Europeans and represent the Euro- pean and American firms abroad, that they may continue in their private individual trade of this important industry until 20th March l.)37, after which all transactions would have to be conducted through the monopolised company. This state of affairs gave a stimulus to the transitory reviva of this industry so much so, that prices rose 100 per cent, towards the last quarter of the year. 8. Communications and security, {a) Communications.—Kqayi Sndri the Rais-i-Turuq, was transferred in the same capacity to bhiraz m April, handing over charge of his office to Aqayi Amiri who remained m office throughout the remainder of the year. The old roads were maintained throughout the year and traffic was normal. A portion of road between Hajiabad and Gakhum on the Kerman- Bandar Abbas road was washed away by heavy rain m the last week of27 March, impairing the traffic and mail service for about a week. No new alignments of roads worthy of note were opened during the year. The Kerman-Jiruft motor road is still in abeyance. (6) Security. —The security on all motor roads throughout the province was satisfactory, and no attacks on motor vehicles were reported. {c) Posts and Telegraphs. —No new post and telegraph offices were opened in the province during the year. The postal services maintained in Kermaii were the same as reported in the previous year. {d) Wireless. —The Wireless station remained closed throughout the year except for testing purposes once a week. (&lt;?) A viation. —No civil or military aeroplanes visited Kerman during the year, and the two aerodromes continued to remain uncared for. Local Government. 9. Condition of the country. —(i) Law and order were maintained satisfactorily throughout the year. (ii) Several Government inspectors of different departments visited Kerman. (iii) Aqayi Arbab Kaikhosrou Shahrokh, M.P., for the Zoroastrian community in Iran arrived at Kerman via Yezd on the 2nd June. The object ol his visit to the above places was to persuade his community to fall in with the views of the Government in discontinuing the almost obso lete method of disposing of their dead in the Towers of Silence which was considered non-hygienic. 10. //. /. AA. the Shah s Birthday. —The Acting Governor-General, on behalf of-the Municipality gave a soiree on the 14th March in the Governo- rate-General, in honour of the occasion. The invitation included, for the first time, the ladies, and required gentlemen to attend in frock coats, as a result ot which only 50 people of both sexes (including Europeans) at tended. His Britannic Majesty's Consul did not attend the function on account of court-mourning. 11. Local Officials and Departments. —His Excellency Aqayi Abul Hassan Peernia, the Governor-General, was summoned to Tehran in Febru ary and was suspended on arrival there, owing, it is said, to his slackness in enforcing orders about discarding the veils. He handed over charge of the Governorate-General to his assistant Aqayi Muhammad Mirza Arasteh. His Excellency Aqayi Amanullah Ardelan, late Governor of Gulf Ports, arrived on transfer from Bushire on 2nd June and assumed charge as Governor-General of the Kerman province. He is more active than his predecessor and many improvements in the town have been put into effect since his appointment. His relations with the Consulate throughout the year were most cordial and courteous. Finance and Revenue. —Aqayi Muhammad Taqi Beenish remained in charge as Provincial Director of Finance. The opium crop which was said to be extraordinarily good, suffered slight damage just before the harvesting season, nevertheless a quantity of about 700 Tabrizi maunds was delivered at the Finance Department for bonderollmg purposes. A similar quantitv is said to have been retained by the culitvators for smuggling purposes. Towards the close of the year the price of bonderolled opium which was Eials ] -25 per misqal of about 5 grammes was increased by 10 dinars in January, and by another 10 dinars in October, thus bringing the retail price to Kials 1-45 per misqal. The Finance Department notified the opium cultivators during the year that the Government intended to curtail the cultivation of opium in the province and to encourage the growing of cotton in its place. The scheme is considered to be detrimental to the prosperity of the province.28 Wheat and barley were monopolised by the Government with effect from the 23rd October and were placed under the supervision of the Finance Department. The price of wheat was fixed at Rials 200 per kharwar of 650 fbs., and that of barley at Kials 110. Rational Bank of Iran. —Monsieur Arsin Barkhurdarian was in charge throughout the year. A branch of the bank was opened in Rafsinjan and other branches are likely to be opened in Sirjan and Bam, the other two important towns of this province, in the near future. Police. —Yawar (Major) Abdul Hussein Mirza Jehangiri, was trans ferred to Shiraz in January and was succeeded by Yawar Hashim Mirza Daulatshahi who remained in office until August when he was appointed the Chief of Ceremonies of the Shrine of Imam Reza at Meshed. Pasyar TI (Lieutenant-Colonel) Seyed Habibullah Fatemi arrived at Kerman as Rais- i-Shahrabani in September and remained in the office to the end of the year. Justice. —Aqayi Fazlullah Ashteyani, the Acting Chief Judge of the Appellate Court and the Chief of the Judicial Administration, Kerman, was transferred to Kermanshah in May and was replaced by Aqayi Ghiyasi. Aqayi Khorshidi the Amini Sulh at Rafsinjan was suspended in August* on certain charges of corruption, and was succeeded by Aqayi Rejaai. Aqayi Sharifi and Aqayi Sadooqi, Public Prosecutor in the Court of First Instance and Chief Judge of the Small Cause Court, Kerman. respect ively were also suspended from service for similar reasons in November. The Court of First Instance at Zahidan was placed under the jurisdic tion of the Kerman Court with effect from June. Registration of the Property Department. —Aqayi Fateh 'Ali Housh- mand held the portfolio of this Department throughout the year. Post and Telegraph Department. —Aqayi Muhammad Mirza Afsar re mained in office until July when he proceeded on a month's leave to Tehran from where he was transferred in the same capacity to Mazenderan. lie was succeeded by Aqayi Obehee, the Director of the Telegraph Department of the Medjliss and assumed charge as Provincial Director of Posts and Telegraphs Kerman early in November. Aqayi Afsar, while at Kerman, surveyed the Jiruft district for the construction of a telegraph line and submitted his report to Tehran. The postal and telegraph services on the whole were satisfactory. Education. —Aqayi Mayal Tavisarkani held the charge of Educational Department, throughout the year. The Imperial Bank of Iran, Kerman's office, and their property which included the Manager's and Accountant's bungalows, were purchased by the Education Department for a sum of about Rials 220,000 (£2,750). The former was converted into the office of the Educational Department and the latter into a Government school. Evening classes for the compulsory education of adults were enforced in Kerman with effect from September. A mnieh. —Sarhang II Khawjuai held the post of Officer Commanding Amnieh Force (Road Guards) throughout the year. Customs. —Aqayi Olfat remained in charge of the Customs throughout the year. All carpets which are exported are examined and sealed in this branch here, so as to avoid a second inspection at the port of export. No other service beyond this is performed by this branch. Municipality. —Aqayi Arefi assumed charge of the Municipality from Aqayi Mansoori in April and remained in office for the rest of the vear. The Municipality on the whole was more active during the year and several improvements, including the reconstruction of the main artery road by a German Engineer, have been made.29 A scheme to build an almshouse to put a stop to street begging is under consideration. Aqayi Hashimi the Editor of the local paper 'Bidari' was elected President of the Municipal Committee in the new elections which took place in November. A griculture. —The wheat and barley crops during the year were fairly satisfactory. The cultivation of cotton was greatly encouraged by the authorities, in place of opium. The pistachio crop was more satisfactory than that of the last year, though the rates remained at the same level, viz.. Rials 2i to 24 for 6^ lbs. Locusts. —No swarms of locusts were seen in the province during the year. Sijil-i-A hwal (Census Department). —Aqayi Sam held the post of act ing Head of this Department throughout the year. 12. Local Politics. —There are practically no politics in this backward and isolated place—Kerman. The Kermanis have learnt the lesson to sub mit blindly to the will of those who represent the Government and compel them to abide by the new laws and ever-changing regulations. For in stance, although the bi-lateral arrangements of the Government in mono polising nearly the entire trade, and in restricting the foreign exchange, is much disliked by the people, yet they are compelled to invest a part of their capital in such monopolised companies, in which they have little or no confidence. The unveiling of women which came into effect in January was the most striking event of the year. Although the movement was carried out by public functions supposed to have been voluntarily organised by the public, yet, in truth. Government influence was behind it. The Military had orders to accord their full support to the Police in time of emergency. The power of the once-powerful Mullahs continues to decrease. The Muharram festivals which followed the unveiling movement pass ed off practically unnoticed. 13. Press. —There are nominally 4 weekly periodicals published in Kerman but only one of them appears with even a semblance of regularity. These papers subsist not so much by sales or genuine subscriptions, but by voluntary donations from the local personages, who often find it safer and advisable to pay an insurance premium against paper criticisms of their conduct.

A Shahrabam otticer who travelled by an autobus by this route to Bandar Abbas took 15 davs to do the journey. Trade and Commerce.—The trade of Bandar Abbas is decreasing. The majority of merchants are petty traders. The Government restrictions, and the number of monopolies created by the Gov ernment have brought trade to practically a stand still. Economic conditions.— Owing to scanty rainfall the crops suffered badlv and the harvest was very poor. Barley and wheat for local consump tion had to be imported from Dailum and Khuzistan.

Mines. —Iranian Mining Engineers and Inspectors from Tehran paid frequent visits to the Red Oxide mines at Hormuz Island during the year. The Customs Department has been working the Red Oxide mines. During the month of October Sulaiman Zadeh, a Mining Engineer, arrived from Tehran and started work in the salt mines on the Island. He also started the construction of a road from the salt mines to the beach in front of the Customs House for the transportation of salt. Plans have been submitted to Tehran for the erection of a Government building and store room on the Island. Two geologists und^r Mr. Abdaaleyan arrived from Tehran to proceed to Jask from where they would go to Lingah and Bustanah to survey the mines. Messrs. Martin Brothers of Tehran were granted the sole monopoly of sales of Hormuz Red Oxide in India and the East and shipped 3,000 tons of red oxide to Calcutta during the month of June.

ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE KUWAIT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1936, I.— T he P olitical A gency. PersonnBl. —(a) Lt.-Colonel H. R. P. Dickson, C.I.E., I.A., htld charge of the Agency from the 1st January to the 3rd February. Captain G. S. de Gaury, M.C., held charge from the 4th February until the end of the year. (b) Assistant Surgeon A. L. Greenway, M.R-C.S., L.R.C.P. (Lond.), was in medical charge of the Charitable Dispensary and performed the duties of Quarantine Officer throughout the year. II.—T he R uling F amily. His Excellency the Shaikh Sir Ahmad ibn Jabir as Subah has conti nued to be the Ruler of Kuwait, and administered the State during the year under review. His Excellency did not leave the Jtate. 2 Shaikh Abdulla as Salim (who has acted for the Ruler when he has been absent) onlv left the State for a short visit to Baghdad by private invitation in October. He contracted an illness in Baghdad which kept him confined to his house until the end of the year. 3. The obligation of His Majesty's Government towards the Shaikh of Kuwait in 1914 in guaranteeing freedom from taxation for his date gardens in Iraq remains, as reported last year, undischarged although offi cial correspondence on the subject continues. HI. T he P olitical A gent's relations with the S haikh. The relations between His Majesty's Political Agent and the Ruler liave continued to be correct throughout the year. IY.—L ocal I nterests. (a) Customs. —A full report on the imports and exports for the year will be found in the Kuwait Trade Report, a non-confidential publication. The Customs duty on exports was raised by { per cent, to permit of in creased expenditure by the State on education : the tola with another 2 per cent added at the end of the previous year comes now to 5 per cent. is increase, however, does not affect the imports into Kuwait by British sub- jects, duty on which continues to be at 4 per cent, ad valorem. Equitably, in view of this Imperial Preference has now been made applicable to goods exported by Kuwait to Empire countries. The Ruler has selected a site for a Customs-cum-Passport Control Post on the North frontier. ib) Municipality. —No remarkable changes in the township of Kuwait or its administration have taken place during the year. The Ruler continues, with excellent results, to forbid a local newspaper, cinemas theatres, alcoholic drink and gramophones in coffee shops. The heady wine of Western 'civilization' is thus being taken in sips not gulps, and only by the wealthier class, which is able to resort to Basra. lc) Education.—The Ruler has obtained as from the 10th November 1936 the services of four young Palestinian schoolmasters to teach English and improve the standard of education of those who will, it is hoped, be required as Clerks, Police, Customs Officials, mechanics, eta (The sons of the wealthier Kuwaitis have for long been going to Ahgarh University, Schools in Singapore and Bombay and the theological colleges of Hassa, Medina and al Mecca).36 The schoolmasters are all young, under 25 and the Palestinian authori ties had no observations to make on their past. The educational pro gramme is already much improved and football has been introduced. (d) Police. —The Ruler has selected suitable metal number badges for the Kuwait Watch, which is no doubt destined to be the basis of a future Police Force. {e) Bank for Kuwait. —The question of a suitable Bank for Kuwait has been among the subjects which have engaged the serious attention of the Ruler during the year under review. Nothing final has yet been decid ed. (/) Post Office. —The Ruler continued during the year under report to press the Political Agent for a Post Office under either his or the Politi cal Agent's influence unlike the Iraqi Post Office now here, which acknowl edges no control of anyone in the State. This has been the subject of cor respondence and progress towards a better arrangement has been made. in) Telephone System for Kuwait. —The question of a telephone instal lation for Kuwait was for the first time mooted during the year, ine Political Agent has put several British firms interested in touch with the Ruler, who is considering the matter. (h) Imperial Airways. —The services, two eastbound and two west bound by land machines, continued as in the last year. The percentage of non-landings to the whole number of passages across the territory was 'roughly 20 per cent., i.e., a proportion of 4: ] between landings and non-landings. No building or equipment has yet been pro vided by Imperial Airways on the landing ground except a small and simple fire apparatus in a box. Their agents for supply of petrol have built a small store. The local manager from Basra visited Kuwait at the end of the year and spoke of improvements in accommodation and air mail arrangements. He inspected the site of the seaplane anchorage. («) Boat Building and Pearl Diving —Boats- —A note on the number, tonnage, etc., of boats built during the year will be found in the Trade Report for 1935. The boat building industry has greatly improved and the yaras were kept busy throughout the year; many boats^ being ordered from elsewhere on the Arabian Coasts, where the leading Kuwait builders are gaining a very high reputation for sound building. Applications were received from as far away as Makalla and Karachi. Pearls. The pearl season showed a slight improvement in prices and in finds over last year, the former, it is believed, due to the expected Coro nation in England. The number of boats which set out for the pearling banks was 300, a larger number than last year and the same as in 1934. The largest pearl found this year, said to be worth £600 was collected by chance by fishermen off Kuwait in December. It was despatched to India by the first air mail. {j) The Pilgrimage to Mecca {Haj) from Kuwait. —The number of pil grims who left Kuwait this year was :— Kuwaitis by camel 193 Kuwaitis by sea ......... Nil Kuwaitis by car .......... 4 Iraqis by car through Kuwait—30, in 10 cars. Many Iraqi pilgrims now prefer the Kuwait route to that from Nejd via Hail. The Ruler has given orders which will ensure the Quarantine Building and Isolation Hospital being kept in good order. g\ 33 (I) The Radio- Radio sets from being rather rare have become common in Kuwait during the year, mostly Philips, and not British, as there is no such make as cheap and efficient as the foreign makes. Kadio news in Arabia and Arab music is received by Kuwaitis chief?v from Home and Cairo. Jerusalem has a shortened and for Arabs uninspir- iTsfenere' 8 pr0gramme and the '''lingual programme is disconcerting to ' Death of His late Majesty King George and Accessions of King Edward and King George VI. News of the death of the late King was received on the 21st January. Mother 6 RUler Sent a Inessage of s y m P ath y to King Edward and the Queen ■ . The b azaars were closed and the Europeans took care to mark in appro- pnate ways their sorrow^ On the accession of His Majesty Kin' Edward ^ J an K m S , JeSt y K,n S Geor &amp; e V] the Ruler sent telegrams express ing his humble duty, receiving to each a gracious reply. VI.—Condition of the Country. Law and order have remained unchanged. Security in the hinterland continues to be good. VII.—Foreign Relations. (a) Saudi Arabia. His Majesty the King of Saudi Arabia arrived in Kuwait on 29th January and stayed until 6th February making a private visit if private can be distinguished from official in such matters in this part of the World—to the Shaikh of Kuwait. He was accompanied by a number of his sons, notably the Emir Muham mad and the Emirs Khalid and Mansur. His total party numbered 673 travelling in 146 motor cars. Gifts were exchanged by the King and the Shaikh. The Shaikh in accordance with custom provided each of the party from the Royal visitors downwards with pocket money and new dresses and cloaks. 1 iguies which give an idea of the scale of the many presents are Present from Ibn Saud to the Subah family . . . 11 motor cars. Present from the Shaikh to the King's followers . . . 750 cloaks. His Majesty was without doubt much pleased with the visit and relations have been most cordial ever since, the two Rulers exchanging private letters every few weeks. 2. The Trade Blockade continues but it has been the subject of official correspondence and may be nearer solution. (&amp;) Iraq. 1. The Ruler reported a total of 12 incursions of which 11 were Iracj Police by land and 1 Iraq Customs officials by sea into Kuwait waters. No redress has been received. Newspaper attacks on Kuwait continued not ably in 'A1 Iraq' of 18th June, 'A1 Karkh' of the 22nd June, and 'Al Nas' of the 2nd July. WitTT the departure from the Iraqi scene of Yassin Pasha al Hashimi. the ea?-Turkish General Prime Minister in October, it is hoped that the campaign of calumny of Kuwait, which began with the publication in his party newspaper 'Al Ikha Al Watni' of 31st January 1934, of a warning to the Ruler of Kuwait to give way to his, Yassin's wishes or be damned, is ended.37 Since that date until his fall from power and flight there had been constant incursions by the Iraq Police. Propaganda against Kuwait had been continuous and had largely succeeded in its purpose of convincing a wide public of smuggling and gun-running by Kuwaitis and the Ruler. 2. On the 27th November, after the Iraq coup d'etat, it was intimated that stringent orders had been given to the Iraq Police not to cross the frontier and no incidents occurred afterwards. No newspaper attack was made between the advent of the new Cabinet and the end of the year. The cordiality of the new Iraqi Foreign Minister when he passed through Kuwait in November was very marked and rela tions now are likely to be happier. The only incident during the year occurred off Lingah on the 14th May 1936, when a Kuwaiti dhow bound for Kuwait from Zanzibar was shot at by an Iranian Customs launch and 3 of the crew wounded. Representations were made by the British Legation in Tehran to the Iranian authorities. No reply has been received. The widespread repercussion from the Palestine strike did not miss out Kuwait. Subscriptions were made but late in the day and the strike came to an end just before the amount collected was despatched. A most unfortunate impression has been given to the Arabs of North- East Arabia by the whole affair and feeling was growing very strong in the last few weeks of the strike. The summer heat and lack of desert water prevented any young warriors going off by camel but some according to reports were about to do so from the Northern Saudi Arab tribes when the halt came. Townsmen are outspoken in their dislike of British Policy in Palestine and regard the affair as not ended yet. The Kuwait Oil Company well at Bahra, North of Kuwait Bay, had reached 5,900 feet by the end of the year. Oil has not yet been reached. The personnel now numbers :— With the wives of some of the above, there were at the end of the year 13 European and American women in Kuwait territory—a record. The Company has established a camp of exploitation for their Seismic Party at Ma'adaniyat, South of Kuwait and has applied for a site on the water-front immediately west of Kuwait for development as a landing place. His Excellency Vice-Admiral the Honourable Sir Alexander R. M. Ramsay, K.C.V.O., C.B., D.S.O., Commander-in-ChieT, East Indies, visited Kuwait in his flagship H. M. S. 'Norfolk', from 14th to 16th Octo ber. He was accompanied by Captain V. S. Butler, D.S.O., Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf in H. M. S. 'Shoreham'. Other visits were paid by His Majesty's ships, sloops of the Persian Gulf Division during the year. 46(C) ExAffairsDept (c) Iran. '{d) Palestine.

Cases of motor accidents have to be dealt with almost daily. A section of police is stationed at the Bahram I etroleum Company s Camp by arrangement with the Companv and tins has been found to be very useful in dealing with cases at the Camp Although the Force is slightly larger than it was in 1935 it is rarely possi ble to collect more than forty men on parade. A regular course of musketry has been arranged and it is intended that every man in the force shall fire a course once during the year. The standard of firing is steadily improv ing. The health of the police is better and they are not getting malaria as frequently as m the past. Six non-commissioned officers and men are in India doing a course of training with the 10th Baluch Regiment. This is the second contingent which has been sent to India, as the first experi ment was veiy successful. The police head-dress was changed during the jear from the Arab aqal and kuffiah to turbans similar to those worn by troops in Egypt, the Sudan and the Somaliland. The turbans are more economical and more practical than the other head-dress. There has been an exceptionally small amount of crime during the year partly because there is less unemployment and partly because most of the notorious rogues are employed by the Bahrain Petroleum Company. Illi cit arak brewing has decreased and the use of methylated spirit mixed with eau de cologne has become popular especially with the women of the town.l/j 41 though methylated spirit is denaturalised and every effort made to suppress this form of evil. Partly owing to the amount of traffic on the roads at night there has been no cases of dacoity during the year. There has been no change in the organisation of the naturs who have carried out their duties satisfactorily under the various Amirs. A natur post has been opened at Budaiyah. 5. Local Affairs. —(i) On the night of the 15/16th December a serious &gt; fire broke out and destroyed the vegetable and wood markets. Almost the entire stock of firewood in Manamah was burnt. His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin 'Isa A1 Khalifah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Ruler of Bahrain, contributed Rs. 2,000 and the Bahrain Government Rs. 2,000 to the perma nent fund of the Manamah Municipality for fire relief victims to be allocat ed by the Council among the sufferers from this fire. (ii) A party of small boys, who were playing in a water channel at Shakhura village, chanced upon a concealed hoard of gold coins, which tumbled out of an hole in the bank on the site of an old house. A number of the coins were found to be Turkish coins of the time of Sultan 'Abdul Hamid bin Ahmad' (A. H. 1187). One coin was, however, a Venetian gold ducat of A. D, 1280—89, 6. The Bahrain Petroleum Company, Limited. —(i) Mr. G. jW. R. Smith acted as Chief Local Representative throughout the year. (ii) Mr. B. A. Skinner acted as Resident Manager throughout the year. (iii) Work on the Refinery proceeded apace during the year. The construction work was not, however, completed, as it had been hoped, by the end of the year., (iv) On the night of 18/19th April a small section of the temporary British personnel employed in connection with the construction of the Refi nery, who had for some time been giving trouble, started a real 'Rough House' in the course of which the Resident Manager, who had attempted to quiet the disturbance, was assaulted and several persons more or less badly hurt. The Political Agent's help was invoked by the Company. Special Constables were appointed and on one night when serious trouble appeared possible, a strong party of Bahrain Police, under the Commandant of Police (Mr. C. Dalrymple Belgrave), was stationed on the outskirts of the Camp until early the next morning. Four of the ringleaders were on the 25th April repatriated under Section 21 (1) of the Bahrain Order in Council. (v) 500,400 tons of crude oil and 9,200 tons of fuel oil were shipped rom Bahrain during the year in forty-one tankships of various nationali- ties (8 American 16 Norwegian, 6 British, 3 Danish, 5 Japanese, 2 Italian and 1 French), the total royalty due to the State amounted to Rs. 17,83,600.

MunicipcilitiBs —Mandmcih. —A large area of the swamp behind the Mission building, municipal property, was filled in with stone. Owing to the abnormal heavy rains the reclaimed area has become covered with water again. Crude oil is being used on stagnant water near the town and it is gene rally said that there are many less mosquitoes than there used to be. A number of roads have been widened and some new roads have been built such as one through Ras Rumman which joins the Manamah-Muhar- raq road, and a diversion of the Manamah-New Camp at the place where the new Direction Finding Wireless Station is being erected. Shaikh 'Abdullah bin 'isa acted as President of the Council for eight months during Shaikh Muhammad's absence from Bahrain. The original subsidy of Rs. 2,000 per month was paid to each of the Municipalities from 1st Muharram 1355. This payment had been reduced to Rs. 1,000 per month at the time when cuts were made in all departments. The Council decided to discontinue the method of employing a contrac tor to do the town cleaning and undertook the work itself. Muharraq.—ln Muharraq little has been done during the year except the normal town cleaning and some widening of roads and filling in of the creek at the Muharraq landing place. The municipality undertook a spe cial programme of work in Hedd which they have now completed. main street was widened to allow cars to reach almost to the end of the town, the large sewer in the middle of the town has been filled in with stone and mud, and is now used as a road, and a dispensary was opened in some buildings which were taken over by the Government for a debt. 10. Public Works. —Work on the following buildings, etcetera was carried out during the year : — (1) Manamah -Muharraq road completed except the parapet, up to the channel. (2) New Customs House. (3) Repairs to Fort including a barrack room and armoury. (4) Dispensaries at Naim and Bilad al-Qadim. (5) Two shops in Barrett Street. (6) Wall in front of the palace and interior repairs, (7) Usual repairs and upkeep of buildings. (8) Repairs on Budaiyah road. 11. Electric Department.—The. Electric Department made a slight profit after paying depreciation and all expenses and it is expected that there will be a larger profit in future years. The staff of the department are continually occupied in wiring more premises and the number of people who use electricity for lighting is steadily increasing but unfortunately the revenue does not increase in pro portion because there is a tendency to replace high powered lamps by cheap Japanese low power lamps. During the year a new ice plant was purchas ed by Manamah Municipality and installed in the power-house. During the year the Jufair Naval Base was connected with a load of 10 kilowatts and a printing press with a load of 3 kilowatts. A new telephone exchange was installed during the year and a day and night service was introduced at the same time. The Manamah ex- chan ^e^is now linked up with 114 lines including those of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. 12. Education. —All schools show an increased attendance. The public are still asking for more advanced education and especially instruc tion in English. The opening of small country schools at Budai'yah and43 at Kurzakhan is under consideration and a building at Budai yah has been acquired cheaply which will be used as a school. All the older boys from the Manamah, Muharraq and Hedd schools have left and obtained work with the Bahrain Petroleum Company. Dur- in &lt;iP the last two years over 150 boys from the schools have obtained employ ment mostly of a clerical nature at wages from Rs. 20—Rs 120 per month. This is in some ways satisfactory but it has depleted the schools of all boys who have learnt a few words of English and have a slight knowledge of arithmetic. These boys have left school and obtained work before complet ing their education and probably they will be no longer employed when the construction work ceases. In the girls' schools good progress has been made in sewing, embroi- derv and knitting. Number of schools in existence on Ist January 1936 Schools opened during the year Schools closed during the year Students on the rolls on 1st January 1936 Students on the rolls on 31st December 1936 , Number of teachers on Ist January 1936 Number of teachers on the 31st December 1936 7 1 1.184 1,063 35 40 1 3 Trade. —(i) Pearling Industry was a further decrease in the number of pearling boats.

V{sits of Arab Notables. —Nil. 24. Sa'udi Arabia. —At the conclusion of a visit to Hasa early in the year Ibn Sa'ud announced that a new tax 'Jihad Tax' was to be imposed on all people not eligible for military service. Increased taxes were also im posed on sugar, tea and tobacco and anything connected with smoking. Representations by the Amir of Hasa that the people were too poor to pay jihad tax met with no success and some 70,000 dollars were collected in spite of widespread discontent. Later in the year Hasa was exempted from further taxation under this head. Further efforts were made during the year to reorganize the various departments of the Hasa Provincial Gqv- ernment with a resultant frequent reshuffling of the heads of departments., In particular difficulties were experienced in appointing financial officials and Customs directors who are in the unfortunate position of having to provide Ibn Sa'ud with funds. Towards the end of the year it was reported that a new exaction amounting to 150,000 dollars was being extracted from the merchants of Hasa. About the same time it was also rumoured that His Majesty King Ibn Sa'ud had requested certain merchants, who had advanced the Sa'udi Government money against Customs duty on their importation of general merchandise, to forego 1/3 of their advances. The merchants are believ ed to have refused to agree to Ibn Sa'ud's request. 25. Qatar. —At the beginning of the year rumours were current' in Bahrain that there had been trouble in Doha between Shaikh 'Abdullah'47 bin Qasim A1 ThaDi and certain members of his family.

Shaikh Thani reported the incident to the Ruler of Doha but received no satisfaction.

He was given a friendly reception. 7. Shipping. —During 1936, fifty-five British steamers and three German steamers called at Dubai and Sharjah. 8. Medical. —Smallpox broke out in Epidemic form along the Trucial Coast in the month of December 1935. A vaccinator and a large quantity of vaccine were sent by air to the Trucial Coast from Bahrain and a large number of people were vaccinated in various towns of the Trucial Coast. The Medical Officer, Victoria Memorial Hospital, Bahrain, visited Dubai by air in January and during his stay at Dubai he vaccinated a number of people. Among the deaths from smallpox was Shaikh Humaid bin Shaikh Rashid bin Sultan, son of the Shaikh of Dibah. Mr. W. C. Janes, the former Staton Superintendent, Imperial Airways, at Sharjah, visited Dubai, Ajman, Hira and Khan at the request of the various Shaikhs in order to vaccinate the people. The epidemic abated and ultimately ceased towards the end of October. 9. Raids and Disturbances. —Some petty tribal raiding, camel steal ing and occasional crimes of violence occurred in various places near the Coast, but there were no serious disturbances. On 27th January 1936, an Indian, name unknown, travelling from Dibah to Has al Khaimah on a hired camel was murdered at a place called Alshaghi about 7 miles from Ras al Khaimah. Strong circumstantial evi dence pointed to the fact that the murderer was one 'Abdullah bin Salim bin Malkash of Shihuh, who is believed to have shot the Indian dead while he was performing his prayers. As the Shihuh tribe inhabit Muscat territory the Political Agent, Muscat approached the Muscat Government on the subject and asked what steps they proposed to take in order to deal with the murderer. The Muscat Government instructed the Shaikh of Shihuh tribe to surrender 'Abdullah bin Salim for trial. The Shaikh, however, refused to take action before he was proved guilty. Negotiations for the surrender of 'Abdullah bin Salim were still being carried on at the end of the year. Exhaustive enquiries throughout the year failed to elicit the name of the murdered Indian. 10.

(ii) Major Frank Holmes visited Sharjah in May in connection with oil negotiations with the other Trucial Chiefs. His visit met with little success. (iii) Major Holmes returned to Sharjah in September to resume nego tiations with the Shaikh of Dubai. Although the Concession was not actually signed, Major Holmes is reported to have paid the Shaikh of Dubai Rs- 30,000. (iv) The Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah also visited Sharjah in September in connection with the Concessions but nothing definite was decided. He realised that Concessions for the Southern Shaikhdoms were not being as eagerly sought for as those for the Northern Shaikhdoms of Dubai and Abu Dhabi. He therefore tried to bring about a combine and demanded a con solidated concession from Petroleum Concessions Limited. He appears to have succeeded with Sharjah but the Shaikh of Dubai realised that Dubai and Abu Dhabi would lose by this and so refused to have anything to do with the scheme. (v) The Geologists of Petroleum Concessions Limited explored Dubai and Abu Dhabi during the two last months of the year, but up to the end of the period under review no report was received. 46(0) ExAffaireDept.50 (2) American Interests. —In December one Ajib Khan (British Indian subject) visited the Trucial Coast in the interests of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. The Shaikhs are understood to have taken the line that they have granted options to Petroleum Concessions, Limited, and till those options expire they were not willing to negotiate with others. B. L. M. TOMLINSON, for Political Agent, Bahrain,51 CHAPiER VIII. ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE POLITICAL AGENCY, MUSCAT, FOR 1936. Part I., 1. (A) Agency Officials.— Political Agent. —Major R. P. Watts, I.A., throughout the year. Medical Officer. —Assistant Surgeon R. Easey, I.M.D., throughout the year. Treasury Officer. —Mr. Maqbul Husain Khan officiated as Treasury Officer, Muscat, from 1st January to 30th June, when he pro ceeded to Bush ire on being relieved by Mr. R. I. Barreto who held the post till the end of the year. (B) Agency in General. —A number of improvements were carried out to the Agency building during the year. The Agency Electric Plant functioned well without a single mishap throughout the 12 months. 2. Agency Hospital. —The total number of patients treated during the year was 7,991 of which 127 were 'in-patients' and 7,864 'out-patients' , . The daily average attendance was 51. The number shows 1,629 less patients than last year. This decrease was due to the filling in and draining of the notorious Muscat 'Pond' which was a prolific breeding ground for malarial mosquitoes. 524 operations were carried out during the year and one post-mortem examination was performed. No cases of poisoning were reported. Skin, eye and digestive system complaints continued to be the most prevalent. There was a moderately severe outbreak of mumps in Muscat and Matrah. One imported case of smallpox was treated in the Quarantine Station. Sporadic cases were reported from time to time from fishing villages of the Eatinah Coast. 3. Demise of His Majesty King George V. —The news of the lamented death of His late Majesty was received in Muscat on the morning of 21st January. The Agency flag and the State flag on the Fort were half-mast ed. On 22nd January at noon the State Battery fired a seventy-minute gun salute. All British subjects closed their shops and suspended business as a mark of respect. The Sultan's Representative accompanied by the lead ing Members of the Ruling family and the principal State officials paid! an official call of condolence on the Political Agent on 27th January. On the 28th January the occasion of the funeral of His late Majesty was observed by British subjects as a day of National mourning and all business was suspended in the towns of Muscat and Matrah. The Sultan's Representative also closed the State Offices as a mark of respect. A memo rial service was held on board H. M. S. 'Fowey' which was in the har bour. She fired a salute of seventy-minute guns at 1000 hours. 4. Political Affairs. —The chief feature of the political situation, which was otherwise calm and uneventful, was the absence of the Ruler throughout the year from the capital of the State. The whole of 1936 was spent by the Sultan in Dhofar a district in the extreme south of the State where he occupied himself chiefly in personal amusements. The normal and only reliable means of communication between Muscat and Dhofar is by sailing craft which may take ten days to three weeks for the single52 journey and for five months in the year during the monsoon period, com munication by sea is entirely cut off. The Official—a Member of the Rul ing Family—appointed by the Sultan to act as his representative in Muscat had been invested with restricted powers and the consequence of these con ditions was to make the conduct of official business exceedingly difficult and at times impossible. During the year the Political Agent had to proceed three times by air and once by sea to Dhofar to see the Sultan concerning important matters. Matters of lesser importance affecting the interests of His Majesty's Government and the Sultanate have been dealt with under appropriate headings in Part II of the Report. The Commercial Treaty between His Majesty's Government and the Sultan was renewed on 11th February. 5. Judicial. —Judicial matters form the subject of a separate report. 6. Trade. —Imports and exports during the year 1935-36 showed an improvement as will be seen from the following figures supplied by the local Customs Department. The imports show an increase of Rs. 2,24,119 which is due to increase in the imports of textiles, wheat flour, tea, spices, twist yarns and oils. Exports show an increase of Rs. 7,03,561, but this is due solely to the exports of Maria Theresa Dollars to the value of Rs. 7,86,042 and Specie and Silver Krans to the value of Rs. 1,12,400. Otherwise a decrease of exports of the usual commodities is shown compared with last year. Th ; s decrease in exports is shown by the following figures :— Dry dates 11,22,715 7,13,330 4,09,385 Wet Dates 2,64,373 2,37,084 57,289 Dried Fish 4,06,006 1,43,785 2,62,221 The decrease in the value of dates is due to the lower prices ruling than last year, while the shipment of dried fish heavily declined as a result partly of the Italo-Abyssinian war but chiefly on account of the refusal of the chief importer, Germany, to take any of this produce except on a barter basis which for Muscat has been found impracticable. At the close of the year large stocks of dried fish were on hand in the local ware houses and also in bond in Germany and if these cannot be disposed of,, severe losses will be suffered by the merchants concemed. As in the past year, the chief place as an importer of piecegoods is held by Japan who continues to strengthen her position in the market. A cheap brand of Japanese cement is making progress against the Indian (Porbunder) cement. 7. (A) Royal Navy. —Visits of H. M. Ships and Royal Air Force Machines to Muscat are detailed in Appendix 'A' to this Report. Last year the Sultan accorded permission for the establishment of a recreational station for the use of the personnel of H. M. Ships, on the small uninhabited island of Jazirat-al-Ghannm which is situated to the north of the Mussandum Peninsula and at the entrance to the Persian Gulf. The station was completed during the year and consists of a Canteen, Officers' Club, Power House, Store-house and Quarters for the Caretaker and Staff. (B) Royal Air Force. —A Royal Air Force reconnaissance with the co- nperation of H. M.'s Navy was carried out along the south-east coast of the Sultanate in October-November. The object of the expedition was to Imports . Exports . 1934-35. 1935-36. Increase. . 36,13,716 38,37,835 2,24,119 . 25,61,387 32,64,948 7,03,561 1934-35. 1935-36. Decrease.53 establish two or more emergency landing grounds on the Muscat Aden air route between Masireh Island and Murbat in the Province of Dhofar. This stretch of the coast is one of the most desolate and sparsely populated of any portion of the State, or in fact of any portion of Arabia. The few inhabitants to be met with belong to lawless tribes over whom the Sultan's authority is merely nominal. II. M. S. Deptford left Aluscat on October 16th having on board a Staff Officer from Air Headquarters 'Iraq, a Royal Engineer Officer-in- charge of Works and Building attached Royal Air Force, the Political Agent and a representative of the Muscat Government. A call was made at Marhut a small port on the mainland south-west of Masireh Island to embark the Sheikh of the Jenabeh tribe who is the paramount chief of the various tribes inhabiting the districts to be visited. The first place visited was at Khur Gharim in Sauqrah Bay where an emergency landing ground had been hastily constructed in 1934.' The sur face of the ground was levelled and cleared and the markings repaired. On completion of this work a reconnaissance for a new landing ground to tlie South was carried out and an excellent place was found in Kuria Muria Bay in the Shuwaimiyah District and at a distance of some 115 miles from Khur-Gharim. The surface of the ground was levelled and the usual markings constructed. After completing the work the expedition returned to Muscat having in addition to making two landing grounds at convenient intervals along this desolate coast established satisfactory relations with the local inhabit ants who wherever met showed themselves friendly. 8. Aviation, General —The annual special authorisation for aircraft to land and fly over Muscat and Oman required by the Civil Air Agreement entered into between His Majesty's Government and the Sultan in 1934 was renewed on 2nd January. The civil aerodrome at Gwadur continued to be used throughout the year by the bi-weekly East and West services maintained by Imperial Air ways, A number of private aircraft also landed here in the course of the year and a few machines of the Royal Air Force on their occasional flights between Iraq and India or vice versa. The emergency landing ground at Shinas was not used by any Imperial Airways machines. 9. Foreign Interests.—[a) The French Consulate remained closed throughout the year. At the request of the Consul for France, Bombay, a few repairs to the Consulate building were carried out by the Agency Overseer. (h) American interests remain in the hands of the Political Agent during the year. 10. Missionary Work. —The Missionary side of the activities of the American South Arabian Mission (The Dutch Reformed Church of the .United States of America) was carried out by the Revd. Mr. and Mrs. Pennings. They were relieved by the Revd. Mr. and Mrs. Dykstra in December. • TDr. P. W. Harrison continued throughout the year in charge of the Medical side of the Mission at their Hospital at Matrah. Dr. W. H. Storm who by special permission of the Sultan had set up a medical clinic for some 4 months in Dhofar returned in a sailing vessel on the 22nd March to Muscat and left for Bahrain on the 24th. Dr. (Miss) Hosman attached to the Zenana Mission Hospital at Mus cat spent the greater part of the year in touring the Batinah Coast treating the sick. During the summer months the entire staff of the Mission left Muscat on recess in India as usual. 46(C) ExAffairsDept,54 11. Slave Trade. —During the year 38 slaves applied for Manumission Certificates either for themselves or for their relatives or both. '25 slaves including children were manumitted during the year. Of the 38 applicants, 9 were Africans and the remainder Baluchis. 12. Weather and rainfall. —The rainfall for the year amounted to 7-00 inches of which no less than 4-60 inches fell on the 9th January in a few hours. According to local reports this has been the heaviest rainfall expe rienced for the last 30 years. On the 21st February a severe thunder storm accompanied with rain and wind of gale force took place. No serious damage was done either in Muscat or in Matrah but on the Batinah Coast several thousands of date trees were uprooted causing a considerable loss to cultivators. Another strong gale broke out on the night of 28/29th February dur ing which several sailing vessels were wrecked. Two 'Badans ' belonging to British Subjects were wrecked and 10 persons—passengers and crew— lost their lives outside Muscat harbour. The highest temperature recorded was 106 0° on 24th May and the lowest temperature was 60-7° on 19th January. ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE POLITICAL AGENCY, MUSCAT, FOR 1936. PlAivr II. 1. Ruling Family—{a) His Highness Saiyid Said bin Taimur. —The Sultan was absent in Dhofar throughout the year devoting most of his time to personal amusements. (b) Saiyid Nadir, the senior uncle of His Highness took no part in State affairs at any time during the year. He invariably, however, attends all official functions. (c) Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal, the favourite uncle of His Highness, re presented the Sultan throughout the year. On numerous occasions he show ed himself obstructive and troublesome in dealing with official matters, but this attitude was probably due more to an intense fear of incurring the Sultan's displeasure and the inevitable serious consequences thereof rather than any deliberate intention to be a hindrance. He paid two short visits to Dhofar in March and April respectively to see the Sultan. Both these visits were made in Royal Air Force machines. In June he proceeded to Sohar for the purpose of investigating the trouble which had arisen between the Riyayaseh, a tribe of Baluch origin domiciled in Oman and the Bani Omar tribe, over a land dispute. When the leaders of both parties were summoned, the Riyayaseh refused to ap pear and replied that they would only represent their case to the Sultan. {d) Saiyid Mahmud bin Muhammad bin Turki, a cousin of His High ness held the post of the Wali of Matrah throughout the year. (&lt;?) Saiyid Majid bin Taimur bin Faisal, a step-brother of His High ness was dismissed towards the end of the year from the post of the Wali of Burkah owing to his debauched and drunken life, misrule and ill-treat ment of people at Burkah. 2. V inantia] Adviser. The Director of Revenues, in the continued absence of the Sultan, remained practically in charge of financial affairs fu the otate throughout the year. Z State Finances.—Thz openinsj balance at the commencement of the year showed a cred.t of Rs. 3,75,335-9-0. This figure, C™ excludes e ts due by the State to local creditors which amount to Rs 71 974 Com pared with last year an increased credit of Rs, 1,01,902-7-0 is 'shown The financial position of the State appears satisfactory.55 4. Trade and General. —This subject has already been dealt in Part I of this Report. 5. Muscat and Matrah Improvement Scheme. —As mentioned in last year's report, the Political Agent at the request of the Sultan undertook the execution of certain measures for the improvement of the towns of Muscat and Matrah. During the period under review, the filling and draining of the noto rious Muscat 'Pond' a pestilential swampy area of about two acres and a prolific breeding ground for malarial mosquitoes were completed and a number of trees planted therein. The latest type fish and meat market and slaughter-houses well con structed of stone and ferro-concrete were completed in both the towns of Muscat and Matrah. The buildings were handed over to the State in August but up to the end of the year no attempt had been made to use them the curious reason given for which being that the Municipality in neither town had sufficient funds to keep them clean. The Sultan's return is awaited to make some suitable arrangement for this purpose. 6. Events in Oman. —Nothing of importance took place during the year. As reported last year, discontent continued to exist over the excessive assessment made for the purposes of taxation on dry dates sent to Sur for export to India. At the beginning of the year, it was reported that Sheikh Mohammad bin Abdullah, the Imam of Oman under pressure from the Hijriyin and Hardh tribes had written to His Highness at Dhofar requesting him to reduce the rate of Zakat at Sur to the level of other places in Oman, viz., 5 per cent, on the value of the dates exported, instead of dollars per load collected at the time. This rate amounted to over 20 per cent, of the ave rage value of the produce delivered at Sur. Under the terms of the treaty concluded between the Omanis and the Muscat Government in 1920 it was agreed that the duty on dates brought down from the Oman for export should not exceed 5 per cent, ad valorem. No satisfactory reply to this communication is said to have been received. As the Omanis saw that the Sultan was not taking any notice of their complaints, this year they refused to send any of their dry dates to Sur and were considering making an agreement with the Sheikh of the Bani-Bu-Ali tribe whose district is called Ja'lan near Sur to open a new port in his territory. At the same time Sheikh Hamad bin Sulaiman, son-in-law of •Sheikh Isa bin Salih, the right-hand man of the Imam of Oman visited Muscat in August to discuss the matter with the Sultan's Representative. The latter after consulting the Political Agent issued orders, in anticipa tion of the Sultan's approval, reducing the rate to | dollar per load or approximately 5 per cent, dd valorem. This action has settled a situation which at one time threatened to become serious. 7. General Communications. —No change took place in the establish ment of Cable and Wireless Limited. Modern high speed instruments have been installed in the Cable Office and the cables from Muscat to Karachi and Muscat to Bushire have been 'Duplexed'. As a result of these improvements a considerable increase in the speed of transmission of messages has been effected. 8. Muscat Infantry. —Captain A. C. Byard, British Army retired, was Commandant throughout the year. The discipline and general effi ciency of the Corps have been much improved under his controi. R. P.
