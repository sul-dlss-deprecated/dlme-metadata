Regarding a petit,ion presented to the Gov. of Bombay, by certain Bania Traders of Mascat praying for the revision of the 'Mascat order in Council' of 1867. I have good reason to believe that this petition is the outcome of the prosecution for contempt of Court institu^ ted by the British Consul, Major C.G. Ragan, against RuttonseePurshotum the chief Bania Trader of this Port, referred to in his letters No. 442 &amp; 445 dated 20th Sept&lt; 1899 to the adress of the Resident ^Persian Gulf, and General Superintendent Thagi and Dakoity Department. This prosecution YJas instituted against Ruttonsee in his capacity of Agent for Messrs. Malcolm and Co. the Arms Traders of Bushire for his refusal to pro duce a certain document for the inspection of the Court in a case rising out of the Arms Traffic, and the said Ruttonsee, who had summoned a pleader from Bombay to del end him, was convicted and sentenced to a fine of 200/- and 7 days simple imprisonment. He thereupon appealed to the Bombay High Court, with a view to getting the sentence quashed but his appeal was rejected on 6th. Dec. last, for want of Juris diction, hence the present memorial. It is signed by a few local Banias; none of the other numerous communities of British subjects E, G. Khojas Hindustanis have joined it , it cannot therefore be considered at all representative. Jith reference to the general grievance represented by the'altered state of things' set forth in clause 4. I may mention that Lieutenant H. R. Jellstead writing of Mascat in 18138, stated that the Bania community at that epoch consisted of about 1500 souls and in a lat er passage mentioned that the Mascat and Matra Cust- toms were then farmed for 165,000 Dollars. These items stand at almost identically the same figures now so that the views expressed in the clause of the memorial above mentioned are based on a misapprenhension of th€For the rest, I beg respectfully to point out that the community of British subjects which the Political Agent at Mascat has to control is composed chiefly of&amp;_ class more enterprising than scrupulous and the intro duction of technicality and the encouragement of liti gation and the attendant* 'pleader” in the Consular Court of this Agency is a wholly undesirable contin gency. Further I am of opinion that the evils and hardships suggested in the petition are altogether imaginary and hypothetical and have no foundation whatever 4&gt;n the annals of the court and that on the contrary the said 'Order in Council' has worked smoo thly and without hardship in the passed and is quite sufficient to meet the requirement of Mascat in the present.

December 7th 1900. Standing at the entrance the Bishop shall say to those gath ered to gether:- Dearly Beloved,we are taught in Holy Scripture that a peace ful and solemn burial is fitly granted to the bodies of those whose souls have entered into rest. Abraham was care ful to secure a burying place as his first and only possesio in the land which God had promised to his seed. Though Mo ses died alone his body was not left unburied but the Angels of God provided his sepulchre. But,above all,we Christians can never forget the burial of our blessed Lord. Though du ring His mortal life he had not where to lay His Head yet His burial was with honour. His body was laid in a new tomb by the loving hands of faithful disciples. We are following these examples when with all care and with due solemnity of rite we sepai'ate from common and profane uses the land in vrtiich the bodies of our brethren and sisters^ in Christ shall await the Resurrection. And since a desire has been expresse that the ground should be dedicated for the burial of oTLMfL 1 ofchristiM^Tand you have certified to us that it has been formally set apart by the Sultan of this place and given by him to be in perpetuity a Christian burying place - now we, Alfred George,by Divine permission Bishop of Lahore,do by virtue of our pastoral and episcopal office de- dare this land to be from hence forth.from all former and common uses and to be dedicated for ever to be the resting place of the bodies of our fellow Christians until they,with us ,be counted worthy of the blessedness of the Resurrection to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord Amen. ,o signify this dedication we will now walh round the ground to he set apart repeating alternately the verses ox Rsalm XC CXXXIX XXIII ThenThen standing in some convenient place the Bishop shall say:- The glorious Majesty of the Lord God be upon us. Prosper then the work of our hands upon us Oh prosper then our handi-work. Let us pray 0 God Who hast taught us in Thy holy Word that there is a dif ference between the spirit of a beast which goeth downwards to the earth and the spirit of a man which ascendeth up to God Who gave it; and likewise by the example of Thy faithful ser vants in all ages,hast taught us to assign peculiar places where the bodies of Thy saints may rest in peace and be preserv ed from all indignities while their souls are safely kept in the hands of their Redeemer,accept,we beseach Thee,this work this of ours in separating ,e portion of land to that good purpose. Vouchsafe we pray Thee to hallow and bless this cesoetery■ and to grant that they who are to be buried here may at the last day receive that blessing which Thy well-beloved Son shall then pronounce to all that love and fear Thee, saying,Come ye bles sed of My Father,receive the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. Grant this,we beseach Thee for Thine only Son,Jesus Christ’s sake. Amen. Hymn 1C5. THE BLESSING.
