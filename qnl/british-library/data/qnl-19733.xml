On receipt of Sheikh Buti' bin Suheil's letter announcing the death of Sheikh Maktoom, I wrote a letter of condolence to him and informed him that I would send him copies of the Treaties and Engagements which are binding upon him in order that he might study them and inform me of his readiness to abide by them. Copies of the Treaties were sent to him in due course and he has replied under date 9th May expressing his acceptance of them. His succession was unopposed, and I have in the meanwhile provisionally recognised him as Sheikh.No. of 190 From POLITICAL RESIDENT in the Persian Gulf, To SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT of INDIA in the FOREIGN DEPARTMENT.

Claar the Line At a private conference recently held at Da'bai hy Majlis consisting of merchants and cousins of Shaikh a cousin of Shaikh Saied was proclaimed as Shaikh. This man wrote to the Residency Agenc^ - that as Shaikh Saied had resigned he was now Shaikh. It has 'been ascertained that Shaikh Saied is still at (Dahai ?) and that in order to avoid trouble fee he XMgkt is desirous of support from British Government. It is believed that reasons for attempt to eject him are his general submission to the wishes of uhe British Government and his enforcement of pay ment of dehts. It is also understood that Shaikh Saied has the support of the majority of the popula tion, and of the Bedouins. Considering the num'b«r of persons and properties entitled to British pro tection in Dahai I submit that strongest support consistent with policy 'be afforded Shaikh Saied and that Commanding Officer should he authorised to in form Majlis through Residency Agent that ejection of the Ruling Shaikh would incur His Majesty f s Govt's strong disapproval with consequent serious effect on the trade of Dahai # Ahove refers to my telegram of the 15th April No 2024./£/&gt;!? $r Telwgram P » * ^ v Jh ^rom.

Priority Although policy is one of non-interference in internal affairs of Trucial Chiefs Grovernment would not 'be prepared to recognise new Shaikh coining forward in circumstances so unsatisfactory as those detailed in your telegram. Majlis may therefore he informed that G-overn- ment canrft recognise any change of this nature unless % and until effected 'by will of the people and that very serious view will 'be taken of af any disturbance affect ing British subjects. Shaikh riUKlot should 'be ahle to reassert his position if he really has majority 'behind him. Otherwise to holster him up would 'be against the policy of Government.

T 'beg to state that on 15th April 1929 when the Senior Naval Officer on hoard T { .! r . 3.

I therefore informed the Senior Naval Officer of tao said news j who sailed at once for T ^ahai. r is s ilp ancaoibd off the port; one hour passed 'but none of the Shaikh visited' the man of war. The Senior Naval 0^ icer ani m^sex: t fore landed. On our entering the creek we met with a jolly \ 'boat sent off to the man of war to intimate that Thai:: l Said was deposed and the said bhaibkh l ania was .• o. .i to - as Taief. The 3.N.O. and myself reached just opposite the house of Shaikh Mania, who visited and informed us that Shaikh Said has relinquished the charge of Shaikhship % himself and that he is now the Shaik ! o Dao.ii. T lei g is no harm, I said, we had better so to lhaikh 3aid.and hear tie deposition from his own tovi-ot; we all went to the house of Shaikh Said hin llaktum. The Interpreter to the S.N.O questioned Shaikh Said about what was expressed'by Shaikh Mania bin Has aid and he(Shaikh Said) replied that h has not deserted himseli from u le oiiaiichsnip and i -b i s still Shaikh himself. The S.N.O. will order the Government subjects, the B.I.rgents and other Foreign subjects to iI / out or Da'bai tiien the Shaikhdom will either 'be his or Shaikh Mania's 'because as lon^ as the G-overnment suojects are in the Town, he will not 'be ahle to take any action upon the Town. The S.N.O toll Shaikh Sail that he villi reoort to you and act according to instructions received from you, the 3.!T.0. and myself returned to the Man of 'ar. The S. &gt;T .0. and myself therefore^/exchansing views vr ith regard to Government as we^l as to Foreign subjects as i( disputes arise 'between Shaikh Said, lis cousins and 1 Bu-?.laseh, then the rxovernment and Foreign subjects shall sustain losses of souls and propertyr The 3.N.0 anticipated disturbance in the Town, so he wrote to the two Shaikhs to refrain from instigation until a reply is received from Yofi^u honour and whoever makes mischief shall 'be held responsible. I be^ to enclose herewith a copy of the two letters sent to the two Shaikhs. On receipt of letters by them respectively, f each of them refrained from quarreling against his friend. On the 17th ^pril the S.N.O intimated to me about Your honour's visit and I should inform the two Shaikhs accordingly. Myself and the Interpreter of the Man of ' f ar, therefore, went ashore, firstly we went to Shaikh 1T ania bin I^ashid and those with him and be^an to give the good advice and that they should make psss * peaoe with Shaikh S a ia bin 'aktum and that dispute and instiga tion between them is not advisable. Shaikh 7 ania replied tiiat he will think over the matter with Al.Bu Falaseh and there will be nothing but good. They therefore assembled and exchanged views amonj themselves and then decided to make peace with Shaikh Said. They sent the wise man Shaikh ruhammad bin ' imad Dalmuk to Shaikh Said in connection with the peace betwe ^r. him,.' his cousin and al Bu falaseh tribesmen. On 18th April 1929, there appeared in the house of Shaikh Muhammad bin hmad Dalmuk?' Shaikh Said and his brothers where Shaikh Mania and the said tribesmen and myself were also present. The effected a peace among themselves and the peace and security was restored in j the Town. Then Shaikh Said and Shaikh Mania # s brother named-' /' ilasiiar bin Bashid and some of -1 ^u Falaseh paid their respects .3 2H /o? the 3.N.0, entertained their agreement a'bout eachother and expressed thew^ratitude to the 3.N.O. ■■ml added that there vili ne ver occur displeasure of any sort between them, ''he n. rT .0 and myself returned to the man of war and s, lied 'or Ch:ir«;a.h. I 'be^ to state that as I understand this outrage on Shaikh oaid 'by ais cousins and tri'besraen, A1 Bu JTalaseti^was for the following reasons That Shaikh Said does not care for the protection s-F of his subjects, 3eni Yas, who live in the desert, ^he -vw-mir Bedouins iory plunder their camels and :ill the desert and when those 'Reduoins visit ^abai, he will nol? arrest and imprison them but supply them with provisions. 2. That a slave is in charge of the receipts of 'abai. 3. That if they have any calim against people of Trucial Oman Towns- he does not endeavour for their recovery. 4. Tie friendly relations of the Shaikh with the Residency '-enf if the latter reports to him a case of indebted Baluchi slave, he. arrests him at once and send* hin to the -^esideacy A^ent without questioning them on the subjeet but acts as he is asked by the -^sidency \^ent and in the circumstances there remains no Baluchi slave to serve them. present Dabai is at peace .nd security and disturbance is over.
