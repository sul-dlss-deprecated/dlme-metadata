Account of tour by Sir Basil Newton, H.M.Ambassador, Bagdad FOR USE BY DEPARTMENT ONLY. POL T» / COMMITTED Sir Basil Newton, H.M.Ambassador Bagdad.has written a most readable account of his recent visit to the Persian Gulf and has accompanied it : with a despatch to the Foreign Office i summarising his impressions and giving his comments. The tour v/hich was made by R.A.F. | plane as far as Muscat, returning by the Weekly Steamship Service to Bahrein j andthence by plane to Basra took 19 days. Sir Basil spent two days only in Muscat, his visit coinciding with the absence of H.H. the Sultan. It is with Muscat, however, that he deals mainly in his comments. Sir Basil was much impressed with the development of oil production along the Hasa Coast and in Bahrein. He foresees that the vast potential 0^ resources in the Arabian littoral and the Trucial Coast and the consequent development in communications and enrichment of these States^may lead to exploitations and foreign incursions. He speaks highly of the impressions he received of the prevailing tranquil : pro-British atmosphere, and comments that v/hereas in Koweit, Ba rein, and | the Trucial States we can by treaty control foreign activities, our100$* © &amp; J -'}S. n(L Sir B. Newton's despatch on his visit to the Arab shore of the Persian Gulf is of some interest. He pays a well deserved tribute to the pro-British atmosphere in the States on the southern shore of the Persian Gulf and Muscat (as compared with Iraq) which has resulted from the influence of our political officers and the policy pursued there during a long period. His suggestion regarding Muscat, however, — that it might be desirable to establish de jure the position which we enjoy de facto - is not very apposite. Whereas by treaties made with the other States they are more or less under our protection and in all cases we control their foreign relations, the status of Muscat is rather that of an independent ally. The Sultan, however, is amenable to our advice ana has shown no disposition to enter into political relations with other powers, and our own relations with him are quite satisfactory. Recently, for example, we concluded a new commercial and establishment treaty with him, and last December we concluded an agreement whereby in return for a subsidy and some arms he undertook for the period of the war to give us such facilities (naval and air) as we may require in his territory. Cn the other hand he is sensitive on the score of his juridical independence, and if we attempted to exchange the 'de facto' for a 'de jure' position, we might well lose the former without acquiring the latter. The/The Foreign Cffice do not intend to propose any action on Sir B. Newton’s suggestion, but as it might lead the Government of India into needless criticism and controversy we have given them a hint that it is unnecessary to take up the cudgels.

[E 1637/1637/91] Section CtfrC* Sir B. Newton to Viscount Halifax.—{Received April 12.) (No. 139.) My Lord, Bagdad, March 31, 1940. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith an account of the tour which I have just undertaken along the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.Q As I believe that I am the first ambassador from Bagdad to visit an area which is seldom seen by any official responsible to the Foreign Office, I have thought it worth while to describe my experiences in some detail. In this covering despatch I confine myself to certain impressions or observations of a general nature. The Great Potential Oil Resources of the Area. 2. First and foremost, it was brought home to me what an immense value this arid and sparsely populated country may possess as a source of oil. In particular, I was struck by what I saw and heard of developments on the little- known coast of Hasa between Koweit and Bahrein. Oil-fields here have only been brought into production within the last two years, but already the American company which thought it worth while to pay a high price for the concession is being well rewarded. Ten thousand barrels a day are being delivered from an oil-field at Dhahran to the neighbouring refinery on the Island of Bahrein, and up to 20,000 barrels are being piped 40 miles to the Port of Ras Tanura, a quantity which can be increased to 30,000 barrels when tankers and markets are available. Most of these wells are at a level of just over 4,000 feet, but a fortnight before my arrival a new well had been brought in at a depth of 10,000 feet in an area well to the north of Ras Tanura, where discovery work was in active progress. In the neutral zone, between Hasa, belonging to Saudi Arabia, and Koweit, where a good oil-field has been proved by a joint Anglo-American company, no concession has been granted, but the prospects for oil are believed to be good. 3. Turning south-east from Dhahran a small hut productive field has been brought into production in the Island of Bahrein by an American-owned company (registered in Canada), and on the neighbouring peninsula at Qatar oil has recently been struck by the Petroleum Development Company (Limited), which is another name for the international association known in Iraq as the Iraq Petroleum Company. The same group operating as Petroleum Concessions (Limited) has carried out preliminary investigations further south behind the Trucial Coast. Exploration is not being continued on account of the war or for reasons of oil policy, but I have heard that the indications were thought to justify further search when the time was ripe. The long range of low mountains extending from the southern head of the Persian Gulf down to Aden has hitherto, I understand, been hardly explored, and I could not help wondering whether these mountains would not also be found to contain oil in the foothills and perhaps other mineral wealth. The surface of this whole vast area, from Koweit to Muscat and beyond, is desiccated and for long stretches seemingly almost devoid of human, animal or vegetable life, but in the not very distant future its subsoil wealth may prove to be that of a second Texas or California. This is, of course, a mere speculation, but I feel that in considering British policy and interests in this region its vast potentialities should be kept well in mind. Maintenance of British Predominance. 4. A second and consequential impression was the importance of main taining our predominance and the tranquil pro-British atmosphere now- prevailing in an area which has long been remote from outside contacts except (M Not printed [5-34]with India, but can hardly remain so much longer. Its wealth, both proved and potential, must surely lead to its exploitation and to foreign incursions, the more so because access and communications are being made easy by air and motor transport and their risks reduced by portable wireless, while simultaneously climatic obstacles are being partially overcome by electric light, fans and refrigerators and, above all, by the provision of air-conditioning in offices, dwellings and even in field camps. The excellent political atmosphere to which I have referred is no doubt primarily due to the work of the Political Resident and the political agents who represent Indian and Imperial interests in the Persian Gulf and Oman. I only wish I could have learnt from Colonel Prior and from Mr. Weightman and Captain Hickinbotham, who were such extremely kind, hospitable and informative hosts to me at Bahrein and Muscat, how to bring about similar conditions in the restless Arab country of Iraq. 5. While my own impressions were casual and are, of course, subject to correction, it seemed to me that a principal means of creating and maintaining our satisfactory position must have been, and must remain, the exclusion of other foreigners. I am inclined to regret that in the case of Iraq we could not, when giving complete internal independence, have excluded foreign diplomatic representation in the same way as we did, in fact, reserve the right to object to the State employment of foreigners where British subjects were available. Perhaps Iraq was too big and too internationally-minded to allow another country to conduct its foreign relations. But so far as I understand our position on the Gulf, we are by treaty or other recognised instruments entitled to control foreign activities in Koweit, Bahrein and the seven Trucial States. Only in Muscat does our international position seem to be less secure. If this is so and safeguards for the future should he desirable, no doubt the authorities directly concerned will draw attention to the matter. 6. As, however, the Foreign Office is also concerned from the point of view of international relations and of the maintenance of British predominance all round the Arabian peninsula, I would suggest that some consideration should be given to this question in that department. For example, the Anglo-French declaration of 1862 can be of little importance now to France, and it may be that its existence could tie our own hands in making arrangements with the Sultan of a nature to prevent foreign intrigues and the growth of foreign influence. I believe that in 1912 it did hamper our efforts to suppress the arms traffic. While the British and French Governments seem by this instrument to have imposed a self-denying ordinance on themselves, other Governments ostensibly at least are left with a free hand. It requires no great stretch of the imagination to fear that this state of affairs might be exploited to our detriment by Italy, Russia, Germany, Japan which does an extensive trade here, or even by Turkey, Persia and America. Thanks to the Political Resident and the Political Agent at Muscat our position could hardly be better de facto. What 1 have in mind is that the excellence of our de facto relations should he used while the opportunity remains favourable to establish our position de jure, and thus guard against an uncertain future. The present Sultan of Muscat is strong, enlightened and pro-British, hut some future ruler might (cf. King Farduk of Egypt) find it difficult to resist the flattery and seductions of an unscrupulous foreign Government. The attempts to establish foreign influence which have been made in the past will doubtless recur unless the way can be blocked, and it may therefore be well to review the situation now in order that if any consolidation of our position de jure is, in fact, desirable, we may be ready to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by the war or by the subsequent peace settlement. As a sidelight on this aspect of Muscat I would mention a remark recently made to me by a resident from Aden, which, whether or not historically justified, at least serves to point my present moral. It was that after the last war, owing to war weariness and perhaps for more altruistic reasons, we declined to accept some offer or proposal made by a local ruler and thus missed an opportunity of strengthening our position in the Yemen. For what we hope will be value received we have, of course, since had to tie our hands by the Anglo-Italian Agreement of 1938. At Muscat we have often been threatened by the rivalry of foreign Governments in the past, notably of France and Russia in the “ nineties,” while as recently as 1938 the Italian Government contemplated sending a ship of war to visit that port. If these attempts were made when Muscat and Arabia were poor, what must we expect if they were to become rich.3 7. No doubt the problem is one of considerable delicacy. I heard that the Sultan of Muscat, like most Arab rulers, was jealous of encroachments on his independence, at any rate in outward appearance. Probably, however, in their inward hearts most Arabs are conscious that they cannot stand internationally alone and prefer to be associated with and protected by the British and Indian ^^Governments, whom they know to be territorially satisfied, and with whose officials they have had good relations for centuries, rather than to be exposed to the ambitions of predatory Powers. In any steps to safeguard Arab States against foreign political intrusions great tact will, of course, continue to be required, and I was struck by the informal and unobtrusive way in which British influence was now being kept paramount. It occurred to me that possibly at some stage the British Council might be able to assist, because if in the course of an evolution which may soon become rapid an educational void were created, it would certainh have to be filled by us if it were not to be filled by others. 8. The underlying policy, to be followed even if not too openly expressed, might perhaps still be summed up in words used by Lord Curzon. when speaking as Viceroy of India to the Trucial Chiefs in 1903, he said :— “ We have not destroyed your independence, but have preserved it. We are not now going to throw away this century of costly and triumphant enterprise; we shall not wipe out the most unselfish page in history. The peace of these waters must still be maintained; your independence will continue to be upheld; and the influence of the British Government must remain supreme.” The Royal Air Force. 9. A third outstanding impression was of the importance of the Royal Air Force in these areas. For over three centuries it has been the proud task of the Royal Navy and the Indian Navy to gain and maintain for His Majesty’s Govern ment and the Government of India a commanding position in the Persian Gulf in the face of great political and climatic difficulties. In this task the Royal Air Force can now co-operate, and it seemed to me particularly appropriate that the Royal Air Force should spread its protective wings over an area which has been well described as the Suez Canal of the air. A station is available at Bahrein and landing-grounds have been established at a large number of places from Koweit as far as Muscat and from there on to Aden. In Iraq, Transjordan, Palestine and Egypt the Royal Air Force are also in a strong position, so that it is clear that the Royal Air Force can and doubtless will play an important part in the maintenance of British predominance round the Arabian peninsula. 10. In addition to these three main impressions, it is perhaps worth while to mention here three minor matters. Smuggling. 11. On board the ship in which I travelled from Muscat to Bahrein my attention was drawn to the prevalence of smuggling from the Arabian coast. At the tiny town of Sharja, with a population of less than 10,000 inhabitants having a very low standard of living, no less than 15 tons of coffee were unloaded. At Dubai, only 8 miles away, with a population between 30,000 and 40,000, consignments of coffee, pepper, tea, &amp;c., were discharged up to a total of 150 tons. The steamer maintains a fortnightly service, which is doubtless supplemented by dhows, so that a strong presumption of smuggling was afforded, and nowhere did I hear any denial of this presumption. It was commonly believed that the smuggling took place chiefly over to the Persian side with the connivance of underpaid Iranian officials. I have not heard, however, that the Government of Iran have shown any disposition to hold us responsible, or even to make complaints such as have, I believe, been brought from time to time against Koweit by Iraq and Saudi Arabia. If smuggling does, in fact, exist on a considerable scale, its sudden suppression might, of course, inflict appreciable loss on a population which looked already very poor. A ttitude towards Iraq. 12. A matter of some interest to me was the attitude of the Arab States on the Gulf towards Iraq. Since Ibn Saud is ambitious and an immediateneighbour, it might have been inferred that the small independent States would look to Iraq for support against Saudi Arabia. I was told, on the contrary, that feelings towards Iraq range from indifference to dislike. Iraq, with its modern pretensions, its assertion of centralised government against its own local sheikhs, and its Effendi-ruling class at Bagdad, does not appeal to sheikhs, who still maintain a patriarchal form of government. Ibn Saud is the Arab leader whom* they respect, and against possible Saudi expansionist ambitions British protection is felt to be adequate. A ir-Cauditioning as an A id to Efficiency. 13. The value of air-conditioning in combating the disabling effects of extreme and prolonged heat was brought strongly to my notice. When I asked officials of the Bahrein Oil Company how their American and British staff had withstood the climate, I was informed that the incidence of sickness had at first been very high, but had been reduced to what was normal in America, chiefly, it was believed, by the installation of air-conditioning. On the Arabian mainland the American company had air-conditioned the quarters for all their American staff, not only at the principal camp at Dhahran, but even in the small portable cabin dwellings in use during construction work at Ras Tanura. At Abadan the general manager of the Anglo-Iranian refinery, which provides its staff with cheap facilities for the rent of air-cooling apparatus, told me that its installation was worth anything up to an extra two hours’ useful work a day during the summer. It is not only the wealthy oil companies who care for their staff in this way. At Fao similar apparatus has been installed on most of the dredgers for the British staff and been found to contribute a great deal to their well-being. Such assistance for British officials elsewhere may have to await the conclusion of the w T ar, but it will perhaps nevertheless, be helpful for those concerned to have the above evidence on record for the future. 14. In conclusion, I wish to record my gratitude to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and to the Political Agents. Mr. Weightman at Bahrein and Captain Hickinbotham at Muscat, without whose assistance my tour would not have been possible. Mr. Weightman and Captain Hickinbotham invited Mr. Man, who accompanied me, and myself to be their guests and could not have done more to make my tour as enjoyable as it was both interesting and, I believe, instructive. At Sharja on my outward and return journeys Captain Howes, the Assistant Political Agent temporarily stationed there, went out of his way to enable me to put the short time at my disposal to the best use. 15. I am particularly indebted to the Royal Air Force, to Air Vice-Marshal Smart, who made it possible for me to fly as far as Muscat, and to Wing Commander Thomson, who took Mr. Man and myself as passengers. Without the advantage of this swift initial flight, a tour would have taken so long, or have afforded so little time at the two places of chief importance, that it would hardly have been feasible. 16. I have sent copies of this despatch (without its lengthy enclosure) to the Political Resident at Bushire, the Air Officer Commanding at Habbaniya, His Majesty’s Ambassador at Cairo (for the information also of the Combined Middle East Intelligence Centre) and to His Majesty’s Ministers at Jedda and Tehran, to whom I have included the sections of my report headed “ Muscat,” “ Bahrein,” “ Dhahran and the Coast of Masa ' and “Ras Tanura, Safwa and Qatif.” 17.

It would have been iaposslole to accomplish a fraction of this programme in so short a period without the assistance of the aoyal Air Force by which we were able to fly the first i,500 miles to Liuscat, and to time this swift initial flight so us to give us two days there and then catch the weekly steamship service back as far aa cahrain. I'hatt-al-Arato on our way to Bahrain and on to sharja for the night. Very soon the small Persian port of .'horramshahr (better known by its former name of Mohamaerah) came into sight at the junction of the Korun kiver with the 8hatt~al~\rab. Almost immediately it was dwarfed by the neighbouring town of Abadan aome eight miles beyond, with its serried rows of masts and chimneys and gasometer-like oil tanks interspersed with the roofs of modern houses and native dwellings. There wss a touch of the dramatic in the realisation that hers to oe aeen from the air in ita full extent lay the greatest oil rvfin&amp;r? in the world, looking aa though a l*rge chun* of inauatrial England FLIGHT FHOk BA&amp;HA TO bHWA, 2. ¥* left Basra the morning of i arch 2nd to fly down the had/had bean aeereted between the Bhatt-al- rab and the Persian desert* ^fter a short pause the comparatively email eatabliehaent of Fao came into sight on tha right extremity of the Shatt-al- rab. n’rom there we altered course westwards to fly over the Island of fcubiyan which ia assuming an unexpected importance as constituting one bang of the Jhor ..bdulla giving access to Umm aar which may be the site of a future port both for iruq and -owclt. Bubi/im ia an expanse of mud flat which loose as though it might eaelly ainit below the water* 1 have been told however that in fact the height and extent of the island ia more lltcely to increase than diminish owing to the deposit of silt. 3 rom bubiyan we flew past * oweIt and along the Haas Coaat to Puharraq, the small northern iftl*nd of the Bahrain group. 1 obtained a fine bird’s-eye view of the whole coast from i oweit to itas Tanura and uharraq and was struck by its extraordinarily arid and desolate appearance aa far back ae I could see from a height of over 3,000 feet. . p»rt from a few very small towns, of which Jubail seemed to be the biggest, there was no sign of any human animal bird or vegetable life. This desolation is no doubt mainly du«e to lack of water, as the annual rainfall averages from five or six inches at Koweit, leas than two inches opposite Bahrain, throe inches at bhar^a, and four inches at uscat. ihe American company wnich ia developing tne oil resources of the Kasa coast ia also prospecting for water and there ia some hope of finding a fair supply of bracaish if not fresh water along this whole coast. *&amp;as vanura was conspicuous with ita row of oil tanks on a spit of sand, but the much larger native towns of Safwa and Ciatlf on the mainland opposite were almost concealed in the surrounding date plantations. 3. *,fter replenishing fuel at uhsrraq we flew over the peninsula of atar on a south-easterly course towards Yaa Island. Oil has recently been struck in ?atar by The Petroleum lievelopment Company. Catar looked most desolate and ita chiefI 0 not like Kutbft «taoK awsgf In th« middle of a remote desert but 1* at a port served by the British India 8tea* navigation Company. Shares la of some Importance as a centre for the ftoyal Air Force. On the night when we were tnere there were two Blenheims from Karachi and two fro* Shalba (near Baara; which had been out all day searching for the Ill-fated Hannibal which had disappeared between Jaak and Sharia on the previous day. Wo were lucky enough to find Captain Howoa the political Agent for the Truoial coast (a post which has been created for the duration of the present war) stationed at bharja and he very kindly took us for a snort trip by car. We visited a watch-tower In which five or eix picturesque eut-tbroata were ensconced about halfway up; they let theaaelvea down by a rope in order to greet ua and show us their ancient muakets which looked as dangerous for the marksman as for hit* mark. The whole scene was strangely remote from present-day reality elsewhere. In the Immediate vicinity hostilities were in progress with the neighbouring tiny t-hnikhdo® of Dubai. Shaikh ? an ft. a rebellious cousin of the halkh of mbal had taken refuge at Sharjaj his presence there was a source of suspicion and offence to the Shaikh of Dubai and had thus resulted in the present hostilities. It might have been prudent or at least tactful of Shaikh an ft. to seek refuge further afield, but his flight had been a very natural precaution since not many months ago certain other notables of Dubai who were believed by the Shaikh to have conspired against him had h*d their eyes put out. The whole trouble originated, if 1 understood the complicated story aright, in an unsuccessful attempt to establish an executive council and thus curtail the bhalkfe's powers, hostilities between Hbarjm and Dubai were proceeding in a leisurely fashion and had resulted in four casualties up to that date. The two towns did not seem to be much affected but communications between the® by land were interrupted and I was told/told tiint th« inoon^«nienc« resulting in tiu* and other way* we* maKing the conflict increasingly unpopular* In consequence of it I could not visit Dubai from Sharia and I refrained fro* calling on either of the two Sheikhs* S’earl im v fishing and a few ragged date plantations seemed to be the economic mainstays of these two little towns, but perhaps amugglime is also a considerable source of profit* Th«ir hinterlands which have not yet been delimited are extensive and may of course be found to contain oil* The population of Dharja was estimated by hhfin Bahlb Abdul ^assaq the local kesldoncy Agent, an ,urab, st between 6,000 and 10,000 and that of i/ubai at between 50,000 and 40,000* In the authoritative 'Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf* compiled by «,*u. orlaer, X* . *, in 1905 the v&gt;op\4ation of Sharja in 190£ was estimated at lo,000, and that of the whole ^haikhdom at 45,000 while the population of the town alone of Dubai was given as 10,000* FLIGHT FKOy SHbWA TO MUSCAT. 5* The following morning we flew almost directly eastwards some fifty miles over the desert to the Omnn hills crossing them at a pass whieh brought us to the coast at Fujairah* That# hills or mountains are described on maps as the Western and ;astam lajar cunt; ins but in the north at any rr te they did not aeem to be generally known under this or any other particular name. The hills at this point were low and comparatively narrow, and looked as though they could easily bo crossed by land. The flight hitherto hud betm entirely calm but on reaching the sea we suffered an unusually severe fall do vn an air-pocket and later on traversed rain storms which were the more unexpected since the annual total rainfall In kuscat varies from five dom to two inches* Flying alon* the so-called Hu tin ah Coast 1 was struck by its much more fertile# .© k - 6 - and populous appoaranca than tn© crucial and Haaa coasts though no doubt this was large1/ a natter of comparison with the extreme desolation seen from the air hitherto, i'here were a number of oases and small towns set in date plantations at comparatively short intervals along this coast. Its inhabitants live chiefly by cultivating dates and catching large quantities of fish for home consumption and for export as fish manure* Although black and white grapea grow in Muscat I did not hear of any association between them and the so-called Muscat grapes which are so famous in Europe. Hills or low mountains run parallel with the coast at a distance varying from thirty to fifty miles until they come right down to the sea at muscat. *e passed by the tiny independent thoikhdom of Fujairah and the equally tiny Trucial atate of JMalba where a *oyal Air Force landing ground was clearly visible. MUSCAT * he airport at Muscat lies behind the immediataly adjacent port of Matrah in a narrow valley which is none too suitable for fast-flying aircraft such as Blenheim*. ing- ommender Thomson made a perfect landing but had the rain persisted he might have thought it necessary to remain in the air until conditions improved or to return to Kalba or even harja, for which his reserves of petrol were ample. Captain Hickinbotham who is the Political Agent and also his lajesty’s Consul at '/usoat was good enough to meet us and take ue to the Consulate. This is a pleasant house on perhaps the bast site in Muscat, with views of the port and also westwards through another gap in the rocky hills by which the port is surrounded. Unfortunately the Bmltan, the only man who really counts in his dominions, was away in the south at £hofar. his chief Minister called on me at the Consulate and 1 returned ( the/the call escorted by Captain Hlekinboth»* an hour later to meet also the Minister of the Interior and one or two other notable* who constituted the acting executive In the absence of the Sultam The Sultan who Is still young has travelled In England and America 9 speafce good English, and la a man of enlightenment and determination and a complete autocrat. He Is pro-British and friendly with Captain Hiciclnbotham but jealous of his independence* for which reason he prefers to regard Captain Hiokinbotham as being British Consul rather than * olltical *'gent. Ills claims to be the spiritual as well as the temporal leader by right of succession are disputed and and there Is an Imam of Oman who is recognised by two of the principal chaiRhs in the interior. I was told however that the Imam, and the two Shaikhs who would probably quarrel if either tried to acquire the Sultanate for himself are showing a tendency to become more friendly with the Sultan who may be able to extend gradually the area in which his authority or at any rate his influence ie effective. The 'ultan however is obliged in many cosoh to the support of powerful tribal chiefs by gifts and money and has set aside a considerable portion of his British subsidy as an insurance against possible internal troubles in the future. I gathered that for lack of secure government the country on cither side of the mountains 9 of which the chief peak is the Jebel Akhdar (meaning the green mountain) 9 is hardly known to Europeans. One day therefore it may be found to be fertile or to contain mineral wealth, b. ^oth t uacat and ^atran arc very picturesquely situated in two small adjacent bays surrounded by rocky hills. On two of them guarding the entrance of muscat harbour are j ortugues* forts doting fro® the sixteenth century, borne of the cannon point outwards but most of thorn arc trained on the town. The mounting of one of the gunn which must have been imported much later by one of the Sultans bore the inscription M m«de by yohn *vt urges 9 '—H— St urge 8 9 Bowling, Yorit», in 1796*. another had on the barrel the capital letter C or a surrounded by the Garter, it was attributed to/date between 1760 ana 10^0. on the v^pper level of one of tha forte ie a prison where I saw a number of disconsolate prihonors with chains round their an*lea. The prison wae dark being lit only by windows in deep ewbra^uree but It seined clean and airy and the conditions were probably food ae could be expected In eueh a remote end medieval area. There were eorae British Indiana in the prison and the British Consul, that ia to say Captain Hlokinbotham, la allowed to visit it fit any time without notice, ae he did when showing it to me. This permission must be a considerable safeguard against abuses. 9* The following day Captain Hlcfcinbotham motored ua some sixty-five miles north-west alon* the Batinah coast to lunch with the Wall at Mueana. There was no proper road but the distance waa accomplished without much difficulty in about three hours. &gt;e passed through pleasant country flanked by the hills on the west and the sea on the east. It *aa flat and covered with acacia and low buahy acrub (not the camel thorn to which one is accustomed in Iraq) with a few trees of which one or two were good apecimena but moat were stunted. *y host informed me that some of this country Resembled parts of Bomaliland. There is however no big game and very little lesser game. There are some gaselle and a very few gray partridge which resemble amall ehukor. t Intervals we drove through pleasant date plantations watered by brackish wells from which the water la drawn by the primitive Indian and -&gt; ersian method of an ox walking down an incline to wind up a aauaage-shaped bucket. ’he effect is like that of a Heath jvobinson drawing and the efficiency correspondingly low. The all received us with a gu*rd of scratch—looking men armed with aoratch—looming muskets, its lived in a primitive fortress with mud walls of a type common also in iraq. *« mounted a kina of keep to a small room where he/A # a® he guye u» the usual Arab aeiil, the great feature of which consist* of sheep stuffed with riee and raisins cooked whole on a bed of rloe. In his youth the fall had accompanied i^ir Percy Cox on his above-mentioned expedition from Abu i/habi to the • oast of Oican* 10* The population of Muscat ia only about 5,000 and that of k&amp;trah 10 # 000. These two figures include about 1,500 British Indians who are under the jurisdiction of the i olitlcal Agent. The luropecm and American community numbers less than ten ineluding women and children. X understood that neither here nor elsewhere on the Arab side of t;.e i ersian Gulf was there any racial animosity between the various minorities, although the Kojae at Auecat and f^atr&amp;h were generally unpopular on account of certain characteristics. In uacat and i atrah there is a great mixture of races including many Baluchis and Africans from Zanzibar and the coaat of Africa, but in the country districts the population la mainly Arab with a Baluch admixture. The Agency radical Officer at Muscat, Dr. 0.t. Hynes, told me that the general physique and health of the inhabitants were poor and that they suffered from inbreeding and certain debilitating diseases. Neverthsleas the general aspect of Muscat and ^atrah and of the batinah coast was one of contentment ,and seclusion. Absorbed in their own small affairs the Inhabitants are remote from a troubled world and doubtless glad to be so. So long as British policy and strength can prevent undue intrusion they can remain happily aloof. 11. Owing to the development of communication by air and also to the establishment of a through railway route from laris to ;&gt;Agdad the l^ereien Gulf is now on • direct line of communication connecting Surope with Asia, Australia and New Zealand, its importance in this respect is likely to grow but Muscat and Omen remain off the beaten track. This territory is/isolated from the Saudi Arabian peninsula^by a range of arid and unexplored mountains/mountains and by th© Hub al doaart* with the result that its political and aconoaio relations are mainly with India. Schools remain primitive and it is to be hoped that when education is developed cure will be taken to adapt it to the real requirements of the country andaroid the mistakes committed elsewhere of giving unsuitable teaching bringing discontent and unhappiness in its train, an improvement in hygiene and health is probably the chief boon which modem education could confer. As regards foreign broadcasts f I was told at j us oat, as also y in the Persian Gulf, that the Xra^i pronunciation of Arabic is preferred to the Egyptian but that the question oi eclipsing the Arabic tranaraiscions from Geriuany is not of great importance since broadcasts from Great Britain and India are the only ones which carry weig t with the .rab listener. .t Bahrain I heard also that no credence has been placed on German statements since a foolish story was spread of britiah violence at ^oweit, when everyone in the Torsi an Gulf knew perfectly well that conditions at koveit had boon completely peaceful# Y0YAG8 FHOK MUSCAT TO MHUAIH VIA JASKf BANDAR ABBAS, SUAHJA, AKD DUBAI 18. On the afternoon of 3 &gt;»rch 5th kr. kan end T left Muscat in the British India 8.s.'Bmrpetm' which had brought from India s new military adviser to instruct the Aultan's levies, fcajor Fettyfer accompanied by his wife. A few hours Inter the ’’Barpeta passed over patches of oil which might in the Captain’s opinion have come from the ill-fated Hannibal lost in this area four days before. At Jank 1 could not land as the ship stopped two miles offshore and only remained a couple of hours, nor could 1 see anything of Bandar Abbas as we arrived at midnight. Gaafc is a very small place and like most of the towns on the kereian side of the Gulf is in a state of decay. There are one or two large/large and raakihuc&amp;le miilainga Incluciing a barracita, a cable station which was given a few ye^ra ago by the Jable and Wireless Comaunications Company to the - ersian Governaent, and the rest house used by the for their international air service. The coast between Jasa and bumuir Abbus ▲ooged very inhospitable with a fringe of sandy coast backed by arid and jtigged mountains, crossing the Gulf from Bandar Abus* to Sharja, we passed near the southern horn of the ctraits of Hormuz where the naval sloops usually keep station in the 5;hor &lt; uwai, a sheltered deep water inlot, from wnich they can see without being seen. On arrival back at CharJa the sea was at firtt sight too rough for unloading cargo. -’our Cuslia lady passengers had eventually to bo hoisted off in a rope basket by the ship’s crane into the lighter alongside. Che local sailors who came to take the cargo looked aa though they could scarcely have changed since the days of ^iindbau the bailor, or at any rate since last century *h&lt;*n this was w«ll named 'The ji irate Coast ’, .lad they carried knives between their teeth ** they climbed on board like momteyi, the illusion of an attack by pirates would have been complete, x was again prevented from seeing ^ubai, ae in order to make up time our ship discharged ner cargo during tnc night. The searchlights playing on the sails of the ohows as they came alongside out of the night, the scrimmaging of to sailors as they manoeuvred for position in the heaving sea, the variety of their costumes and racial types ranging from Arab to complete n^gro, crested a ghost-like picture of weird beauty. Bahrain/1»5« On Sunday, yarch wa arrivad oi'f feanaiaa which is the capital of the main ialand of Bahrain. Thic again is an open roadatoad where we had to anchor two or three miles offahore. Bahrain consists of s group of small islands of which the two principal are luharraq to the north and Bahrain Island itself which la far tha largest being some thirty miles in length with s maximum breadth of eleven miles. On uharraq Island is the airport used by the iioysl Air ^orce and by Imperial Airways both for land planes and flying-boats. The landing ground consisting of firm sand is one of the largest in the world; occasionally it la flooded by high tides. There la a considerable population of pearl fishers and other residents and the town of iuharraq is connected with Manama, the capital of buhrain, by a causeway. A gap has had to be left in the causeway to permit water traffic to pass if not also on account of the depth of the channel at that point and for tidal reasons. This gap is about to be closed by a swing bridge now under construction by Messrs. Holloway Brothers who have just completed two much larger bridges in Bagdad. 14. The population of Bahrain is about 125,000 of whom 1,600 are British Indians and some 6,000 or 9,000 are of Perelam origin. There ie a British community of about fifty including itr. 0.B. Belgrive who is British Adviser to the Sultan, an Inspector of Customs, two engineer*, a doctor and a lady doctor. In the camp of the Bahrain Oil Company there la an American and British staff of M)0. In accordance with an understanding when the concession was granted the American* are being gradually replaced by British subjects. There is also a British naval station. 1 was told that the nrabe, owing to their lasinesa and lack of constructive ability have lost the predominance/lb -13- predominance they originally held with the exception of the family of the Shaikh who ie achieving complete pre-eminenoc owing to the large increaee in hie revenues resulting from oil royalties. Mr. Hugh welghtman, the Folltloal ^gent, was good enough to call in hia launch to take us to stay with &amp;rs. Aelghtman and himself at the agency Jind ^onaulate. On the following day r. V eight man took me to pay my respects to L— highness the ohalkh at one of his palaces some miles away from the capital, where we were entertained to the usual vrab meal. 15. v# also visited the tombs which are one of the most intriguing features of ancient Bahrain. They consist of a aeries of large mounds, each one of which seems to constitute s kind of family mausoleum and to contain a number of graves some evidently for children. The graves face in different directions apparently haphazard, and the one I saw which was opened up for the first time in my presence was well a^de with smooth faced stones for the aides and bottom, the top being covered with large unhewn stones. Inside it very little was found, only a few small bones. About eighteen months ago in a similar mound the discovery was made of s low circular well- built wall about three feet in height forming a perfect circle. In the-eiiae* a ant a.., two trenches, over which there had perhaps been a platform. Intersected at the exact centre. There were no graves but the earth inside the circle was full of small bones from animals so that presumably this particular mound, the only one so far discovered of its Kind, had been s place of sacrifice. &amp;ome years ago a good deal of excavation was carried out by archaeologists but X understand that no explanation of these tombs has yet been found, me*reference to them in ancient records, although this extensive burial place must have been famous at some distant date. A similar burial place exists at Jebrin not far southwards on the mainland.-14- Kir 16. In the »fternoon 1 »aw &amp;n up-to-date ho^pitui mich is feeing completed in Manama. It is at present in charge of Dr. * c’iowell, a lady whose brother ie a surgeon in Bagdad. A new senior doctor is due to erriwe before lonp. 17* The next day I was uhown over the oil camp o the Bahrain Oil Company which i» regietored in Canada but ie purely American and owned by the Californian Arabia standard Oil Company, ^he American manager, i r. . Anderaon, and a British colleague, Mr. J.3. Blaclc, and the British doctor in charge of an up-to-date hospital, Dr. Kennedy, and other representatives of the company were most kind in showing us over the refinery and the hospital, modem laundry and other up-to-date features of the camp. The incidence of illness was at one time very high but had been, 1 was informed, brought bt^low what was normal elsewhere, partly by the installation of the modem sanitary laundry, but chiefly by the provision of air-conditioning. The oil wells are at two levels, a little over £,000 feet and a little over 4,000 feet respectively. Their life is estimated at a minimym of fifteen yeera and may prove to be from thirty to forty. The refinery treats 80,000 barrels a day from the Bahrain field and another 10,000 to 12,000 barrels a day shipped from the oil company operating on the mainland. 16. The refining process at Bahrain differs from that in operation at Abadan and Xhanaqin and produces a petroleum coke aa a by-product. This has not as yet been marketed and a dump of about 150,000 tons has been accumulated. It appears to be excellent fuel and it occurred to me that a market might be found in Iraq where ordinary coal is almost prohibitively expensive costing from f.6 to £6 a ton. 1 aa enquiring whether meanwhile some of it can be made available for consumption in the grates of diplomatic households in Bagdad including my own. Dhahran/T 15- DHAMRAN AKD THS COAST OF 19. On the following day Mr. Velghtata, Ur. 1 an and I crossed fro® Bahrain In a large motor launch lent by the Shaikh to see Company on the mainland* After rather a rough voyage of two hours we landed at *1 ivhobar f the small port for the main oil aamp at Dhahran located on an elevation about five miles distant, we were accompanied by Saiyid Abdul Asia al i uoaaibi who owns extensive date plantations on the mainland near Qatif and was acting as a kind of unofficial Baud! escort. His occasional attempts to obtain official recognition as a Saudi representative in Bahrain are not encouraged but his action in accompanying us on the present occasion was regarded as a civility to which r. Weightman saw no reason to object. At Al Khobar we were received by a guard of honour and various Saudi officials who were moat polite and friendly. Our hosta were the Californian Arabia Standard Oil Company and its most hospitable manager Ur. Floyd Ohliger* with whom I stayed for the night, informed me that but for his resistance my whole time would have been taken up at meals and other entertainments arranged for my benefit by the Saudi authorities. We spent the afternoon in seeing the oil camp and some of the oil wells. The houses are small but all are air-conditioned. The wells in this area were at the same depth as the Bahrain deep level wells, that is to say from 4,000 to 4,500 feet. ?e learnt however that within the last fortnight a well had butm brought in at 10 9 000 feet at .&gt;bu Hadria, an oilfield which is being developed towards the north. From ten to twelve thousand barrels were sent over daily from Al Khobar to the refinery at Bahrain and the remainder from Bhahran was piped to the port of Kas Tanura. The pipe-line is about forty miles in length and its capacity up to 50,000 barrels a day. The amount b^ing exported fr^m *a« Tenure did i an oilfield opened up by the Californian Arabia^Htandard Oil-16 not exceed *0,000 barrels a day and waa often much lees according to the tankers available. 1 understood that no decision has yet been reached as to whether the oil from the northern field would be piped to uas T&amp;nura or to soae nearer port ouch as . uball. SO. The road from Ohahran to Has Tanura has to follow a more circuitous route than the pipe-line and is some sixty miles in length. It is only an oiled track hut motor cars and except lorries can proceed at s good speed/at on or t^o places where there is loose sand which despite the employment of oversize desert balloon tyres la liable to be an obstacle. It is already possible to reach the northern oil camp from Dhahran neutral sone^to .oweit in another eight hours. roa hovelt to da#ra it is only three and a naif to four hours so that s practicable motor route is in process of evolution from hasra to Bahrain and beyond. The development of air transport may be equally practicable. Lancing grounds have been provided by nature at many places e.g. i.oweit, Bahrain and Jharja, and others in the interior may well exist or be capable^of easy construction and maintenance. Portable wireless outfits are another important aid in the conquest of the desert. Brackish vater adequate for cultivation and household purposes already exists at many points e.g. qatif and Kofuf and further supplies of brackish and even freah water will perhaps be discovered before long in response to the search which the American oil company is making. It lookfs therefore as though many of the difficulties which for centuries have kept the Saudi Arabian peninsula in Isolation may soon be overcome. &amp;ven that of the fear or dislike hitherto felt for alien visitors may soon diminish as the native inhabitants become accustomed to American oil prospectors and learn to appreciate the material benefits resulting from their operation. Americans are actively by car in about five hours engaged/engaged in the search for oil and their travels about the country for this purpose will presumably be encouraged in view of the sources of wealth which aay thereby be developed. The scale on which the o apany is working is shown by the fact that it employes some 300 to 400 Americana and 5,000 natives* j'oet of the latter are ^r ibs but they include Indiana and also Christian Chinese to whom the Saudi Arabian Government object less than to Indians* HAS TAHUJiA, CAFWA QATIF 21 . After spending the night at chahran, our hosts motored us to *as Tanura which lies on a spit of sand connected with the mainland by a strip ao narrow as almost to constitute a causeway. Come years ago the hope was entertained that J*aa Tanura ^ould develop into a port of some importance and a large custom house was then built. No development in fact occurred until the oil company went there. The bay between the spit on which Mas Tanura is situated and atlf can only be used by shallow draught vessels. The tankers tone their oil from a submarine pipe-line on the north-west side where the aneftorage i® deep and fairly well sheltered. The number of storage tanks was being increased and construction was in progress of a small refinery to meet the needs of b&amp;udi territory. The camp is on &amp; much smaller scale than that at bhahran but I noticed that the American engineers were housed in small portable cabin dwellings whi^h were all fitted with air-conditioning apparatus. ^ . On the return Journey we stopped in a date plantation for luneh at S&amp;fwa on the property of Saiyid Cuoeaibi our escort from Bahrain. Ssfwm lies a few miles to the north of catif. It is a good deal smaller but considered to be the beat part of the oasis. Warm springs of clear squamarine water well up at various points and supply plantations of dates extending from Ssfwa/A id- Lafwa to Qetlf nnd beyond* I was told that a similar and oven larger oasis exists at Hofuf in the southern part of Hass. (Hofuf is the naae given on the nap but la I was told only the chief town or village amongst a whole group containing a total population of from 100 # 000 to 200*000. *rabs commonly refer to this group not as Hofuf but as Hess so that as used by thorn the word Haes may mean either the whole province or this main centre of its population)* *fter enjoying a large Arab luncheon at 3afwa and seeing a little of the immediate s\irroundings which are unusually attractive on account of the pools of clear water and the d&amp;te groves, we continued our Journey on to Qatif wh^re we were entertained to coffee* tea and inoense by the Governor* Saiyid Huiaud* who received us with a motley guard of honour. An old native town struggled beyond mud wtills over a considerable area among the date plantations* Ancient and picturesque c.atif formed an interesting contrast with modern and efficient Dh&amp;hran. It has derived its population and prosperity from dates and pearls but for some years both these sources have been on the decline, ^rom jatlf we made our way back to Dhshran and thence to Al Khobar to rejoin the Shaikh’s launch. e wore seen off by the ^sudi Arabian authorities who could not have been more friendly or hospitable. Previously in Bagdad the Saudi Arabian Minister* while making no difficulty about a visit to the oil camp st Dhnhran* had suggested that there could hardly be anythin* which we could want t© see at *aa Tanura or atif. Any hesitation which this may h*ve betokened on his part was in no way reflected in our actual reception on the spot. Amongst the American hosts to whom we were particularly indebted for their hospitality and great kindness were kr* Floyd Chliger the punagtjr in charge and irs. Ohliger* Mr* award bkinner* j r. and Mre. C. Davis* Mr. a. Killer in charge of the construction of the has Tanura refinery and the Assistant Manager iar. G. Witherspoon. Pao/S3. The land plane serYlce was a day late at Bahrain and we had to wait till Saturday to return to &amp;a?ra« On the Sunday morning Sir Wohn lard toon ua to Fao in hia fast »otor launch which is capable of Baking the Journey in three houre. It was interesting to see again, from the water lerel this time, Khorraashahr on the Karun giver, and Abadan with its cranes and Jetties along the front of the Shatt where from eighty to ninety tankers call every month and, a few miles lower down at Khosrowbed, the t*o new Jetties recently built and a third under construction. On arrival at Fao I was shown ovt?r several of the dredgers, including one at work* I was told that they were very up-to-date which I could well believe and that a new dredger, one of the very latest type, was nearing the end of its journey out fro® home. I was very favourably impreseed by the accommodation provided for the staff which was better than what 1 have seen on most ocean-going steamers. Vhe ward-rooms were equipped with air-conditioning spparaUMi which, i was assured, functioned well and had made a great difference to the well-being of the staff, it is certainly desirable that everythin* should be done to maintain their comfort and efficiency as they have to work for long spells under trying conditions. Since the existing five dredgers can hardly ke*p pace with their work, each dredger is ofteq. in constant operation for two or three weeks at a time. 84. r-ir John Ward has also done a great de&amp;l bo provide comfortable conditions on land in the somewhat cramped area available at Fao. Buoying and lighting operotione in the Persian Gulf are conducted from there and I saw the lighting apparatus and the gas plant from which the beacons are supplied. A school for the native children, small play-grounds, nnd a hospital are all provided within the area reserved for Fao out■ I im (3 * of the surroundly date plantatlonB belonging to the Sh^lich of Kowelt.

Durinji Uie following morning Mr.PKttinacm and the vorka Manager Mr* H.Uigden showed me as much of the vast oil refinery as was possible in the time* to nine million tons a year of oil and spirit had been shipped, but I understood that the present r?ate was rather lower. A new refinery is likely to be built at Ma’shur close to Hundar ^hapur on the Khor lusa in the Persian Gulf, where there is excellent shelter, deep water and no drmger of silting. Although in grim surroundings Ma’shur will be conveniently situated for a new oilfield which is being opened up to the south of the two oilfields fro**! which supplies have chiefly been drawn hitherto.

A question of procedure of some importance arises on this, for the assumption on which we have always worked here has been that personal telegrams between yourself and myself (or whoever else may be holding our posts) ' would not be circulated outside the India Office, or used in any way officially or demi-officially with other Departments. And it is on that basis that in such telegrams we express ourselves a good deal more freely from this end than we should otherwise. I think it is important that there should be no misunderstanding on this point. The personal channel between us is a very useful one: but it would lose much of its present value if there was to be any risk of communications sent through it being seen by other departments of His Majesty's Government. In the present case, the fact that my telegram went to the Foreign 4 w Ofi ice and that its contents are now widely known in the -1^ nas crea ‘ted an embarrassing position for Prior.32 Pi \ 2. I think we are both in agreement on the merits of the main case but to round off correspondence I send copy of Uewton's original telegram of 2nd February. I ought, I think, to stress that Newton had previously visited Kuwait and called on the Shaikh without making any reference to the Resident, and I think you will agree with me that his intimation of his desire to visit the Gulf is a curiously drafted document and reads indeed rather as though Newton regarded himself as Prior's immediate superior. However we do not wish to pursue this matter further, but we are quite satisfied that there has been no misunderstanding on Prior's part. 3. We wholly share the India Office view that it is essential to maintain the position of the Political Resident as against the various persons in surrounding charges — Baghdad, Tehran, Jeddah, etc., and we wholly share also the view which has, I think, consistently been held by the Secretary of State that the post is one of really first class importance in an area vital to British interests. We are the more concerned in these circums tances to see that nothing is done or said which might in any way affect the Resident's position, or let adjoining/-adjoining authorities intrude into the Gulf. We have just heard in that connection from Prior that Newton has been telling him that he, Newton, was not satisfied about the position in Muscat, and that he hoped Prior would not mind his mentioning it in a report. It goes without saying that we should take the strongest exception here to any comment or criticism by the Ambassador in Baghdad on the affairs of the Arab Shore, and we should be bound to make that clear in a formal manner in the event r of Newton in fact making any comment of this nature. If it is the case that he contemplates doing so, it is a further argument for keeping the Ambassador, like the Minister, out of the Gulf so far as possible. R.T.

We entirely agree with all that you say and are telegraphing to Newton on the lines you suggest. I enclose a copy of the telegram herein. V/e will also write to Bullard at Tehran. There is no fixed rule about an Ambassador or Minister in one country consulting the Ambassador or Minister in another country before visiting that country. There is certainly never any question of obtaining formal concurrence. Except in obvious cases like a visit to the Riviera, he would probably let his colleague know of his intentions and take it for granted that if the colleague saw some special objection he would say so; and in certain other equally obvious cases, like visits wo ovvccii ua.jja.xi emu *xxj-na • xxc vwuu-LU utix'u i h ENCLOSURE IN AIR MAIL LETTER ma r cai’e uu ce/ R. i• Peel, iiiSq.j C»B»E.
