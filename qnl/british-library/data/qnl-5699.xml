Zanzibar Agency and Consulate Expenses. The Indian claim upon the Imperial Government on this account is made up of two sets of items which have no necessary connection with one another. First, we claim to be reimbursed one half of the payments which, since April 1873, have been made from the Bombay Treasury to the Sultan of Muscat on account of the annual subsidy of 40,000 crowns (= 8,500^,, at 4s. 3c?. a crown), payable to Muscat by the Sultan of Zanzibar. Second, we claim the refund of one half the actual expenses of the Consular Establishment at Zanzibar since the beginning of 1870, plus an annual charge for interest on the cost of the Consular buildings. Each branch of the claim requires to be considered on its own merits, and without reference to those of the other. Muscat Subsidy. Our claim on this account rests upon the corre spondence which passed with the Eoreign Office when the arrangements in regard to Sir B. Erere's mission to Zanzibar were under discussion in the autumn of 1872, and upon the proceedings of that gentleman acting as the Envoy of the Imperial, not of the Indian, Government. It is unnecessary to enter at length into the history of the subsidy payable by the ruler of Zanzibar to the ruler of Muscat. It is sufficient to say, that in 1861 Lord Canning, then Governor General of India, acting as arbitrator between Zanzibar and Muscat, awarded an annual payment of 40,000 crowns (8,500Z.) from the former to the latter. The regularity of the payment was in no way guaranteed by the Govern ment of India, and up to September 1866 they had no concern in the matter. It was then arranged that the subsidy should be paid through the medium of the Political Agent at Muscat, and be recovered from the Sultan of Zanzibar. This arrangement lasted until August 1868, when the Muscat throne was seized by Seyyid Azzan bin Ghez, who was regarded both by us and Zanzibar as a usurper, and not entitled to the subsidy. In Eebruary 1871, Seyyid Toorkee took possession of Muscat, and became Sultan. He was recognized by us in that character, but the old arrangement as to the subsidy was not resumed. Seyyid Toorkee was allowed to make fruitless appeals to Zanzibar for the periodical payments to which he was un doubtedly entitled under the award of 1861, which Zanzibar had no valid grounds for setting aside. The sum advanced by the Government of India to Muscat between 1866 and 1868 was Bs. 1,90,850, of which only Bs. 1,68,000 was recovered from Zanzibar. The balance of Bs.'22 5 850 was written 18727. I. 38. A-off as a bad debt in October 1872.* At that time, therefore, the Indian Government had entirely disconnected itself from all pecuniary responsibility in the matter. , i At this period the mission of Sir Bartle 1 rere ivas set on foot. It was purely an Imperial mea sure and had but one object,—the suppression of the East African Slave Trade. To effect this object treaties were necessary, not only with the Suitan of Zanzibar, but with the Sultan of Muscat, and other Arab chiefs on the littoral of the Gulf of Aden and the Persian GuM. It was recognized that, as a consideration for the concessions required from the two first named, it might be found necessary to, on the one hand, relieve Zanzibar of his liability to Muscat, and, on the other, to guarantee to Muscat the punctual payment of the subsidy which he had a right to receive from Zanzibar, with arrears. That this question of arrears would certainly be brought before Sir B. Erere by Muscat was clearly intimated to the Foreign Office by the Duke of Argyll, in a letter dated 28th October 1872. In an earlier letter, dated the 25th October, His Grace agreed to charge the revenues of India with one half the cost of Sir B. Prere's mission, i.e., of such expenses as salaries, travelling, &amp;c., and with a share of the cost of certain measures for the sup pression of the slave trade which might be a con sequence of it; but the expenditure on this head was expressly limited to &lt;c one half of the subsidy ' paid by Zanzibar to Muscat under the terms of ' Lord Canning's arbitration, should it be found ' necessary to relieve the ruler of Zanzibar from ' that subsidy, together with one half of the ' (territorial) permanent expenses of the Agency ' and Consulate ' at Zanzibar. What was anticipated would happen did happen, though not quite in the order expected. Sir B, Frere's negotiations at Zanzibar failed for the moment; the Sultan refused to sign the treaty offered him. The question therefore of relieving him of his liability to Muscat did not arise. But, on the other hand, the Sultan of Muscat at once met Sir B. Frere's wishes, and concluded a treaty in the terms desired by Her Majesty's Government. An immediate payment of one year's arrear of subsidy, out of the 2^ years claimed by Seyyid Toorkee as due from February 1871 to May 1873, was his reward. This payment amounted to* 40,000 crowns = 8,500/. He was further authorised to draw on the Political Agent at the end of three months for a further sum of 20,000 crowns = 4,250/., on account of the subsidy due for the first half of the year 1873-74, i.e., from 1st Februarv to 31st July 1873. On the Qth June 1878, the Government of India, in accordance with Sir B. Frere's recommendation, formally guaranteed to Seyyid Toorkee the payment of the subsidy of 40,000 crowns ' with arrears, from the date of His ' Highness' accession to the throne of Muscat in on AAA rUar T 18 71.' Of these arrears, amounting to 90,000 crowns, 40,000 had already been paid by * See Enclosure in Sir B. Frere's Despatch to Earl Granville, No. 65, of J873, p. 211, in printed collrction. ( 1 f \ y «8 Sir B. Erere; in August 1873 the Political Agent received orders from India to effect the necessary adjustment of the outstanding balance of 50,000 crowns = 10,625/. This was done, and the subsidy has ever since been paid regularly from the Bombay Treasury. I understand that the Foreign Office admit their responsibility for Sir B. Erere's acts, and their liability to refund one half of the 40,000 crowns ordered by him to be paid at once as arrears, as well as one half of the periodical payments which have since been made as the instalments have fallen due, reckoning from Pebruary 1873, but that they dis pute their liability to refund any part of the 50,000 crowns paid in August 1873 as balance of the arrears. This repudiation of liability is based upon the view, which is now for the first time put for ward, that this last-mentioned payment was an act, not of Sir B. Erere in his character as Envoy of the Imperial Government, but of the Indian Govern ment, acting ' proprio motu,' for reasons of its own. I submit that this pretension cannot be upheld for a moment, and is a quibble unworthy of one branch of the Government engaged in discussion with another. A reference to the documents is sufficient to make this clear. Let us first take Lord Granville's instructions to Sir B. Erere, under date 9th No vember 1872. After authorising Zanzibar being relieved of his liability to Muscat under the award of 1861, Lord Granville writes thus ' On the other hand, you are empowered, on similar conditions, 44 to give similar assurances to the ruler of Muscat ' that the amount to which he may be entitled ' under the aforesaid Award will be regularly paid ' to him from Her Majesty's Treasury at Bombay.'' Now, though the above paragraph does not in terms mention ' arrears,' the words in italics certainly cover them. That Sir B. Erere thought so is clear. 'Writing to Lord Granville on the 16th April 1873, he says,—' I told him (the Sultan of Muscat) I would lay the case of the subsidy ' before you and Lord Northbrook, and that, mean- ' time he might draw on the Eesident for one year ' of the arrears of subsidy now due, as he is in ' very urgent want of money, and there can be no ' question of Zanzibar's liability to pay.' In other words, there could be no question but that Seyyid Toorkee was ' entitled ' to the subsidy from the date of his accession in Eebruary 1871. Again, in a Memorandum dated the 3rd May 1873, Sir B. Erere, writing as ' Her Majesty's Special Envoy to Zanzibar and Muscat,' embodied his views in reference to the settlement of the subsidy question so far as regarded Muscat. Only one paragraph need be quoted at present, as follows :—' F would submit, for the consideration ' of His Excellency the Viceroy, that the Govern- ' ment of India should assure His Highness, by an ' autograph letter from His Excellency the Viceroy, ' that the Zanzibar subsidy will be regularly paid, ' with all arrears, from the Bombay Treasury to4 ' His Highness' Agent in Bombay, as ^ long as His tc Highness abstains from all aggressions Qn ^an- « zibar, and observes the obligations he and his ' predecessors have entered into regarding the &lt;{ suppression of the Slave trade. ^s Memo randum was sent simultaneously to the Govern ments of India and Bombay and to Her Majesty s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. The terms of the covering letter to the Government of India are decisive as to the responsibility of the Envoy for the subsequent action of that Government, an as to the responsibility of the Imperial Governmen for the act of their agent. Thus wrote Sir B. Prere from Mahableshwur, on the 2tid May 1873 « would submit, for the consideration of Your hx- ' cellency, that a decision on the course to be &lt;£ taken by Her Majesty's Government regarding ' the Muscat subsidy due from Zanzibar should be ' arrived at with as little delay as possible, and ' that, if Your Excellency approves of the views I ' have taken, they should he at once acted on^ so ' far as relates to an immediate assurance of pay- it ment of all arrears to the Sultan of Muscat, ' whose administration, I have reason to believe, is ' seriously embarrassed by want of funds.' In little more than a month, the Government of India, on the 9th June 1873, desired the Political Agent at Muscat to inform Seyyid Toorkee, as follows:—'It affords the Viceroy and Governor ' General in Council much satisfaction to guarantee ' to His Highness the payment of the Zanzibar ' subsidy of 40,000 crowns, with arrears from the ' date of His Highness' accession to the throne of ' Muscat in February 1871, and to assure His ' Highness that so long as he continues faithfully ' to fulfil his treaty engagements and manifest his ' friendship towards the British Government, the tc subsidy of 40,000 crowns will be paid to him ' annually during his rule.' The balance of arrears was accordingly paid over in August 1873. This is the payment which the Committee is now asked to regard as an ' unauthorised act ' on the part of the Government of India, which may be disallowed by the Imperial Government!! The Government of India lost no time in re porting their proceedings to the Secretary of State in Political letter, dated 9th June 1873. In doing so, they wrote : * * * ' We understand that if any &lt;£ portion of the sums now, or hereafter, advanced to ' Seyyid Toorkee on account of the subsidy be not ' eventually recovered from Zanzibar, the half of ' such unrecovered advances will be repaid to us by ' Her Majesty's Imperial Government.' A copy of this letter was sent on to the Foreign Office on the 29th July 1873, but elicited no remonstrance or remark of any kind, although it contained the paragraph quoted opposite,* which ^as added by the Duke of Argyll himself to the departmental draft. The reference to the possibility of recovery of the advances from Zanzibar requires explanaion. 'Treasuries. In his Memorandum of the 3rd May 1873, Sir * ** His Grace, however, does not con sider this as a matter of doubt, under standing it to have been decided from the first, that the expenses referred to would be shared between the Imperial and Indian I mo anT»ioa 'B. Fieie lecorded his opinion that the subsidy ad vanced to Muscat ' should be punctually and ' peremptorily recovered from Zanzibar.' But this was written on the supposition that the Sultan would maintain his recalcitrant attitude. How ever, on the 5th June 1873, he signed the required treaty. There is nothing in this instrument which precludes Her Majesty's Government from calling upon him to fulfil his obligations to Muscat; but, as a matter of fact, they have not thought fit to do so, and it is understood have no such intention. It may be asked why did not Sir B. Erere, when at Muscat, himself give the Sultan the assurance which His Highness subsequently received from Lord jSTorthbrook. Let Sir B. Frere answer in the words of his Memorandum of the 3rd May 1873:— It would have been within the letter of my in- ' structions to have given His Highness at once a distinct assurance that the subsidy would be ' regularly paid to him from Her Majesty's Trea- c sury at Bombay, but I thought the assurance c would come with more effect from His Excellency ' the Viceroy, and I wished to comply with the obvious wish of His Highness that the two ques- ' tion of Slave trade and subsidy should be kept ' clearly distinct and separate.' I submit that no further argument is necessary on this head of the discussion, but that the right of the Indian Government to be reimbursed a moiety of the total sum advanced by them to Muscat since February 1871 is clear, and that the objection now set up to a portion of the sum, paid as arrears, can only be characterized as ' frivolous and vexatious.' The appended statement shows, approximately, the amount which will be due to India at the close of the current financial year, stated in rupees, con verted into sterling at the official rate of exchange for successive years, viz.:— Date, and Nature of Payment.

R6 If the amount be reckoned in Crowns, at the rate of 40,000 crowns = 8,500*., the charge on the Imperial Treasury will be somewhat greater, viz., 25,500*. But the account appears in Rupees m Indian books, and should therefore, I think, be so passed on to the Foreign Office. Expenses of the Agency and Consulate General at Zanzibar. The origin of this branch of our claim is fully explained in the memorandum prepared by Mr. Wollaston in December 1874 whiqh is in the hands of the Committee, and need not be recapitulated. I understand that the principle of the Imperial liability, which has never been disputed by the Foreign Office, is now at last admitted even by the Treasury, and that the points which the Committee has to consider are, (1), the date from which the Imperial liability should commence, and (2), certain points of detail in regard to the cost of the existing establishment. In reference to the first point, we have always claimed to be relieved of one half of the Zanzibar expenses from the date on which the Departmental Committee of 1869, composed of representatives of this Office, the Foreign and Colonial Offices, the Admiralty, and the Treasury, reported that it would be an equitable arrangement that the charges of the Agency and its dependencies should be equally shared between the Imperial and Indian exchequers. This date was the 24th January 1870. The Foreign Office, I believe, while admitting our moral claim to be relieved from that date, have suggested that, inasmuch as the Treasury have persistently refused to admit any Imperial liability on this account, our claim cannot be substantiated, and that the earliest date from which such liability need now be admitted is No vember 1872, when it was formally recognized that the maintenance of the Zanzibar establishment would be essential for the carrying out of the measures for the suppression of the Slave trade which Sir B. Frere was commissioned to initiate. That is to say, now that the principle of our claim can no longer be disputed, and the long delayed day of reckoning has come, we are to be fined something like 8,000*. as a penalty for a delay for which the other party to the dispute was alone responsible. It should be borne in mind that our right does not rest merely on the Report of the Committee of 1869, but upon the Report of a Select Committee of the House of Commons, dated 4th August 1871, long prior to Sir B. Frere's mission. It may be further observed that the duties of the Zanzibar establishment in connection with the Slave trade may be presumed to have been not less onerous between 1870 and 1873, when the traffic was in full blast, than they have been since that date and the suppression of the trade. On this point, Lord Granville's Letter to the Treasury dated 29th Au just*7 ' ■: ■ y : V:.- Salary of Political Agp:nt .—India Office, 1 ,980/.; Foreign Office, 1,680/.

Argument, however, is really not required to show the inequitable character of the foreign Office suggestion. As regards the details of the existing establish ment, to which the Foreign Office object, a few words are necessary. In December 1874 we sent in to the Foreign Office an estimate of the cost of the Consulate for 1875-76 (afterwards amended), amounting to 6,941^. This exceeded the amount of their estimate submitted to the Treasury by 1,861?. The chief points of difference were as follows:— We put down Dr. Kirk's actual salary as a 1st Class Political Agent in the 4th Class of Political appointments under the Government of India, plm ' the local allowance attached to the appointment of Agent at Zanzibar. He might have been replaced by an officer of inferior rank; but his own salary could not be reduced. The Eoreign Office do not provide for this appoint ment, the idea being that the duty should be done by the Civil Surgeon. This idea may or may not be practicable. Until it is carried out, the Assistant actually employed, on the recommendation of Sir B. Frere, must be paid. Sir B. Prere originally proposed an expenditure of 2,044^. on this account for an establishment on the following scale, viz., 2 at 8^. a day; 8 at 6«. a day; 16 at Ss. a day. The Political Agent after wards recommended a revised scale of establishment costing 1,600/., as follows:—8 at 6s. a day; 16 at 35. a day. This last is the scale adopted in our estimate. If the full staff has not been, in practice, employed, the expenditure will, of course, fall short of the estimate. We proposed to charge the Poreign Office with 400/. on this account. They have not included it in their estimate, or noticed it in any way. I am inclined to think it is a charge which will not occur, as an officer on leave draws only a portion of his pay, the balance going to his locum tenens. In any case, it will not be an annual charge. We' estimate the share of the Imperial Govern ment at 225/.,—the Foreign Office at only 120/. Our estimate is based on the cost of all the build ings, old and new; the Foreign Office take the cost of the new buildings only. Any further observations in regard to these and other details are unnecessary. We do not claim from the Imperial Government an arbitrary amount, but merely the refund of one half of our actual ex penditure. Details of that expenditure can no doubt be rendered up to March 1876, with very little delay, though the probable disbursements for the current year can, of course, only be estimated. The items included in the various Statements sent in to the Foreign Office make up a claim on this branch of the account of 14,663/.* ; this sum will be increased by the end of the current financialyear to 18,474/. These figures will, no doubt, require to be modified, as most of the items should, in the first instance, have been stated m Kupees, and then converted into sterling at various rates ot But, taking the figures as they stand, our claim is as follows :— „ J: &gt; ' . • • On account of the subsidy to Slst March 1877 - - - 24,300 , On account of Agency and Consulate - - - 18,474i £42,774. Having regard to the many years during which we have been kept out of our money, we have a right to expect that provision will be made in the Par liamentary Estimates for the payment to us of a sum not far short of that mentioned above, subject to future adjustment. There seems to be an inclination on the part of the Foreign Office to make a settlement, even at this late day, of our just claims on account of the past, in some way conditional on our agreeing to pay a share of much more expensive establishments at Zanzibar and on the African coast in the future. I submit that this is altogether unreasonable, and that no bargain of the kind should be considered. When a satisfactory settlement of the question referred to the Special Committee has been attained, the future of the Zanzibar Establishment may, perhaps, be a proper subject for discussion. In that case, it may be worthy of consideration whether the appointments, in all grades, to the Con sulate should not be transferred to the Foreign Office, who now have the control, that Office bearing the first expense of the establishment, and recovering from us such a proportion as may be agreed upon, which should in no case exceed the amount which we may have to pay for the current year, 1876-77. I must apologise for the many deficiencies of this Memorandum which has been written in haste, without opportunity of revision. A. W. M.
