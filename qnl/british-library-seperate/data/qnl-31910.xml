The map indicates settlements, hydrology, and boundaries, and provides some indication of relief.The map features printed territorial lines, which are described in a table of reference. These lines, which have been highlighted with coloured ink, represent boundaries delimited in 1903-1905 and 1913.Additional lines drawn in coloured ink and crayon represent prospective boundaries for eastern and south-eastern Saudi Arabia, and date from the early 1930s approximately. The outermost line, in red ink, is (as indicated by a handwritten note) an approximation of the Saudi Government's interpretation of its country's eastern and south-eastern boundary.</abstract><typeOfResource>cartographic</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Map</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100049623112.0x000006#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
