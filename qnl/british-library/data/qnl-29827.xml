Copy of letter from the Governor’s Office, Aden, to Secretary of State for the Colonies, London, No. Confidential (2), dated the 16th June 1937. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your confidential despatch of the 24th Mav 1937 regarding the succession to the Sultan Sate of Mukalla, and to state that I shall discuss the matter with His Highness Sultan Salih, on his return to Aden, in the manner that you indicate. I do not yet know the date of his arrival, but I understand that it will be during the month o- July. 2. In the meantime Sultan Muhammad bin ’ LTmar, son of the late Sultan ’ Umar and claimant under the Will of Sultan Awadh to the Sultanate of Mukalla, has arrived and is remaining here temporarily to press his case. He has not yet stated it fully but I have no doubt that he will base it not onlv on the Will of Sultan Awadh but also on the Agreement made between his^father, the late Sultan ’ Umar, and the present Sultan at Hyderabad m Trdia on 24th June 1922, to which he has already referred m a recent letter to me Copies of this agreement and of the Will of Sultan Awadh were sent to your predecessor as accompaniments to Major-General Scott s despatch No. 3 67, dated the 16th May 1923. For convenience I propose to send you fresh copies of both the documents. a , 3. It will be seen that the Agreement of 1922, to which thejresent Sultan appended h ^ s ^“^ u gC h s n 0 / ss a '^opcsef irjustify his’intention to dishonour it g It wdl be obLv^d that although General Scott “P^ed of Ms despatch of 16th May 1923 that the Agreement should be recognise 59 C) ExAfijursDe^t : j»j ,M DIA PC , ... , .:tary !

No reference to the agreement was made in this communication. ^ 4 As I have previously indicated the hands of His Majesty’s Govern ment appear to me to be perfectly free in this matter, except in so far as they may consider it politically expedient to press any particular course of action. I shall therefore await Sultan Salih s explanation of his proposals and of his reasons for them, as directed by you. 5. In the meantime I do not propose to enter into a discussion with Sultan Muhammad bin ’ Umar as to the rights and wrongs of this dispute, but to limit myself to taking note of any points that he may wish to put forward.

For the geological exploration of the Trucial Shaikhdoms, which we hope to continue in the forthcoming season, the Company will be using the same geologist in charge of the party as before, Mr. T. F.

Note by Sir R. Bullard respecting King Ibn Saud and the Italians. When I was at Riyadh Ibn Saud seemed to be more concerned than ever about the Italians. He referred to M. Mussolini slightingly as the “ Sword of Islam,” but spoke with apprehension about his disposition to interfere in the affairs of other countries-now Abyssinia, now Spam or the Red Sea. He said that according to news from the Yemen the Italians we showing great activity in the Red Sea and had recently lande f ] ™ e ? &gt; °' 1 h ‘ j Island aSd its neighbour. I reminded the King of what Mr Rendel had said to him about the Italians and the Red Sea during is vi Italian he was only half reassured. I promised to keep him mformed of any Ita,han move in the Red Sea of which we might become aware The King said that only two or three nights before, the Italian wireless had again referred to t close interest taken by M. Mussolini in Moslem v H t ? ie q '°h a Klan amusement the neat rebuke administered to . ' | ' t sa ; f j that in his when M. Mussolini claimed to be the protector °f f“ a r ago opinion the Italian propaganda was dangerou . _ ^ immediately that the Grand Mufti of Palestine had accepted ana i was asked the Mufti whether the story was true ^e “uftasaM^m ^ ^ ^ baseless, and that he would tell I bn an assured Ibn Saud that ho pilgrimage.

Ibn baud s that if he took anything from the Italians they “f aid return In order to elicit his opinions I played devils advocato. i that His Majesty’s Government were offering a stock of arms at a |ow price would they want something in exchange ? No, said Ibn Saud , the into of Saudi Arabia and Great Britain were identical. And would not the Italians allege that their interests were identical with his . Ibn baud r dicated that he didn’t care what the Italians said. W hen all was sai , he declared, the British were the best people. They were better than the Italians, better than the Turks—better than the Arabs. He would even have preferred, from a purely Saudi point of view, that His Majesty s Government should retain the mandate over Iraq. With the Biitisn as his’ neighbours he felt safe. As an Arab and a Moslem he must sympathise with the advance towards Arab independence, but the independence of Iraq had created a situation which he viev/ed with grave anxiety. And now the British were going to give up their responsibility for Transjordan ! (42) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter No. P. Z. 5580/37, dated the 23rd August 1937. Received on 11th September 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 34, dated the 26th August 1937. Letter from British Legation, Jedda, to India Office, No, 115 (E, 3720/ 1022/25), dated the 15th June 1937, received 6th July 1937. I have the honour to report the promulgation by the authorities of two measures which appear to be part of the “ Back to Religion ” campaign about which I reported in my despatch No. 91 dated the 8th Slay. 2. The first is an order which was issued by town crier, forbidding all Moslems to shave their beards. The penalty for infringement of this regula tion is a fine of 7 riyals. Any barber who shaves the beard of a Moslem is also liable to a fine. It was understood from the beginning that the em ployees of foreign missions in Jedda would not be interfered with in this respect, but a messenger attached to the California Arabian Standard Oil Company has been fined for a breach of the regulation. It is understood that a considerable sum in fines has been collected in Mecca, but that on at least one occasion the authorities were disappointed by a Javanese who after being kept in prison and under observation for several days, was still without the rudiments of a beard and had to be discharged unpunished. 3 Most Javanese, in fact, sometimes through natural inability but often from choice do not wear beards, and the Netherlands Charge d’Affaires who is himself a Javanese, recently visited Mecca to investigate this question He was assured hy the authorities that if any foreigners had been nnoished M w- l ? rds r t« ula J tlon 11 was through a misunderstanding and that if LdY^bfe: m hTh h ad a onlf t^ 0f J he -g^tiont a Athe- reeHfi A • a • ■ ly tomform the authorities to have the mistake 'ty apphed toTMoskms 6 f^Ta ^ ^ ^ which that cannot be proved I ma7 sat St no c b A™’' S' P Ut in writin § British subject has been called upon to com/Ty wk tTe regultion! 1616 ^ of a measure which 'has 1 beekallowed trA ll' Ut 7 *?. erel y the re-enactment official hostility to .havfng rsaMto be du &amp; to Tbn W' The ° f discovery of a Saudi youth movement and to 1 11 s a ™°yanee at the adherents not to be modernising toads V leam t0 teaeh its ~ ‘ n to ” h *■“56 children in Mecca had dolls to play with, toy rabbits, and the like. It is true that it is unlawful, according to a well-known Moslem authority, for any Moslem to have an image in his house ; but, according to the same authority Mahomet cursed all painters of men or animals, yet photography is allowed in the Hejaz. Ibn Saud allows himself to be photographed, and this year a cinema film of the pilgrimage was taken and afterwards shown in Egypt, which could hardly have been taken without the King’s consent. But per haps there is some distinction in the Wahabi tenets between figures in the round and in the flat, which enables the latter to be classed as harmless, or perhaps photographs can be attributed to light and therefore to Allah. 6. There is yet another measure which I hear is to be applied during the forthcoming pilgrim season, though it has not been announced in public. All women pilgrims are to wear complete wrappings such as the Hejaz women wear. Of late years some women pilgrims have been wearing the pre-war Turkish dress (black) of cape, close-fitting hood, and thinnish veil, but this is no longer to be considered adequate. It is not known what action will be taken against recalcitrants, still more against any women who are rash enough to follow the example of those Egyptian ladies who, I am assured, some times appeared unveiled even in the courtyard of the Mecca mosque this last season. 7. Copies of this despatch are being sent to Cairo, Bagdad and Jerusalem. (43) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter No. P. Z.-5506/37, dated the 20th August 1937.

Letter from British Legation, Jedda, to India Office London, No. 133 (1137/249/8), dated the 3kd August 1937. Aq T have already had the honour to report in my telegram No. 69 of A„mit Lt the Amir laud, accompanied by his brother the Amir Muhammad, Ihelkh Yu A YlZ and his suite, returned to Jedda on the 1st Augusts 2 On the previous evening a printed notice was received by me at a late hour, setting forth the programme of reception; the ship was due to arrive abiut 8 a m. His Royal Highness would be received at the Customs ouav where the diplomatic corps would be looked after by a certain Jamil Davud of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and so forth. I am informed by some of mv colleagues that this was the first occasion on which such a printed notice has-been circulated; but I was evidently fortunate in receiving it the previous evening, as most of the corps diplomatique did not receive it till the morning of the reception. 3. Mr. Gault and I arrived at the Customs building at 8 A. M. and found a large airy shed, elaborately carpeted and provided with chairs. A broad central passage between two blocks of chairs led up to the seat of honour, behind which were about thirty other seats. The Chief of Customs greeted us, and Jamil Davud informed me of my serial number in the diplomatic order of precedence. The diplomatic corps were given seats on one side of the central passage, the other side being reserved for great personages such as the Guardian of the Keys of the Kaaba, the Director of Education, the Censor of Morals, and many other persons of note, almost all of whom had come to Jedda the previous day. 4. The Amir Feisal arrived soon after 8 a.m. and greeted the diplomatic corps, the introductions being made by Jamil Davud. The Amir sat first in the chair of honour, the chairs behind him being allotted to about thirty members of the Royal family ; I was told that most, but not all, of them were the offspring of King Abdul Aziz. The weather was sultry, and though the customs shed has been well designed to catch any sea breeze which may be blowing, the diplomatic corps, as well as some of the Arabs, seemed glad to repose in their comfortable chairs and wait for the arrival of the Heir Appa rent. Four aeroplanes circled round at intervals. The crowd included many picturesque types of Arab ; merchants with their old-fashioned Hejazi hats, young students, fierce soldiers with rifles and full bandoliers, and grave m nj- tahicis from the Holy places all rubbed shoulders, making a many-coloured throng. - . . o ^ 5. At about 9-15 a.m. the Amir Saud and his companions arrived at the quay and were escorted to the shed. The Amir Feisal and the other royal personages having greeted the two Amirs very affectionately, all the other Arabs thronged around to salute them, with kisses on the face, or on the with’rrrph'iwnt^ 1111 A a v!’ S ’ acc ” din g to rank - The Amir Saud behaved /nd spirit!. d g ty d 0harm ’ and a PP eared to me to be in excellent health Davud Th The r'T P resented b y the Amir Feisal and Jamil the chair of hotZ /T* “with each. He then took his seat on of u 1 which the Amir Feisal had vacated, and various addresses ol felicitation were read or recited tn « 4 . luius ^cmresses come, which contained a reference to thp aon'rl a ^ ress ^ wel-* Scotland ; the speaker’s congratulation^L th^p”* had taken P lace in a burst of applause. The court noet then cam b ince R ba PPy escape evokedit before every line. The perspiration poured off his nose and out of his beard as h3 worked himself into paroxyms of loyalty, but the drops did not obliterate the writing and he let the audience have ''the full benefit of every word. The heat was not the only thing he had to contend with ; aeroplanes swooping down over the shed with a deafening roar, just missing the roof, drowned his voice ; bursts of clapping in the middle of elegant lines spoiled the effect of the final vowel; but he was determined to let us have it all, and repeated, sometimes three times, those parts of the poem which he thought had not been properly heard. After him a little boy, with a squeaky voice, repeated, from memory this time, a long poem of welcome from the school boys of Jedda ; and then an older boy gave us another eloquent address of welcome, ending by a series of what might be called antiphonal responses from his comrades in the assembly. An aged poet from Medina also read a poem, full of eloquence but without so much of the fire which had distinguish ed the previous speakers. 7. The ceremony was now drawing to its close. The Amir Saud address ed a few words to the Diplomatic corps, thanking them for their attendance* and I believe that the dean of the Diplomatic corps, Monsieur Hakim off, the Soviet Minister, replied shortly in suitable terms. The Amir then rose and shook hands with all the members of the Diplomatic Corps in their order of precedence ; and I was able to offer him congratulations in Arabic. He, in reply, said what an excellent time he had passed in the United Kingdom and asked me again to thank all who had been so kind to him. We were then able to depart, and to take off the collars and ties which are so seldom worn here, and which aggravate the unpleasantness of living in a moist heat which has not gone much below 90 degrees Fahrenheit for several days and nights. 8. As we drove back through arches decorated with green and white Mr. Gault told me that he had heard from a member of the French Legation that a demonstration against the Palestine Report had been staged for just after the ceremony of greeting. Nothing of the sort happened, however. 9 I was much impressed bv the dignified appearance and bearing of the Amir Sand. It also appeared''that everyone was very pleased to see him back ; old inhabitants of Jedda say . that all these ceremonies are engineered and ordered by the government; but it really did appear that the people who attended the reception were genuinely glad to see the Heir Apparent returm Much dancing and jollity has been arranged m the streets of Jedda during the past few days ; perhaps Arabs are used to dancing round fires m a moist heat of 90 degrees ; but it seemed to me that everyone was really quite phas ed. 10 At 3 P.M. that afternoon X was received by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

W. Seager, the Frontier Officer, who returned to Aden from San’a on August 6th last after a month’s stay in the Yemen. Enclosure to S. No. (55). Memorandum by Captain B. W. Seageb, the Frontier Officer, dated the 20th July 1937. During my stay in San’a this month I find that I have not collected very much fresh data to amplify my reports submitted towards the end of 1936. The following represents the results of my observations and the information imparted to me by the various personalities I have met in this town and on my way to and from the Yemen. 2. General .—The question of the succession to the Imamate still interests all classes. The Crown Prince’s stock is rising and I begin to have very little doubt that he will succeed his father in the first instance. Apart from theWazirs, he seems to fear the rivalry of his brother Ali most of all. The latter is still in prison and will remain there if the Crown Prince has his way though he would prefer to see him dead. It is reliably reported that an attempt was actually made to poison him recently. Doctor Petrie was called in to attend him and told me that he had treated him for dysentery in the first instance but that he reacted too early to this treatment which led him to believe that his internal disorders w^ere not due to disease but probably to poison. He is kept shackled and in chains and although permission was sought to get these removed while he w T as ill, the King would not hear of it. I have met Ali twice in the past. He is a pleasant young man and popular with all. He is said to have a following wdio would risk a lot to get him out of prison but I fancy he will be lucky to emerge alive unless the Crown Prince has his wings clipped. 3. The Crown Prince has mended his ways slightly but his natural indo lence coupled with his extreme harshness and cruelty still make him an un- popular figure.^ He is greatly feared and this may stand him in good stead after his father s death as the electoral body will probably prefer to nominate him rather than incur his wrath. there 4 'is I no el r 1 |nnh h tv, tl i il v, kS t he is \ euttin g a fine figure in the public eye and there s no doubt that he tries to star himself into greater activity : but in mentality he combines the graces of an impulsive blundering with the Zt for r fnT mble r e% ° f an ° riental deS P ot of ^ good °W ordered that hJwas to j- anC r’ + 6 13 ^P risone d a soldier for desertion and fcrtwfwretehTana/ed 6 to ZZwe.AdhYriZ bf ^ ^ U ' f the sentries.

He is m full possession of his faculties and still attends to the minutest affairs of State. It would be useful to cite an example of this. During nudiGiice on July 17th. last we were interrupted, by the entrance of the Prime Minister who sought authority to order an official car from the State garage for the King s 13th son. This authority was granted and he was told to address a note in this sense to the Director of Motor Trans port. The King suspended our audience while he watched Qadhi Abdullah draft the note : when it was completed he was shown the draft which he slightly amended, initialled, and, as is usual in this country, throw on to the floor for action. 7. The Wazir family are still an element to be considered in the matter of the succession but as the Crown Prince increases his influence and makes his position felt in the Zeidi highlands—and there is no doubt that he is doing so—so much must the Wazir star wane. Seyyid Ali ibn El Wazir, the Go vernor of Taiz district has not been in the Zeidi highlands for 14 years and is naturally out of touch with the highlander whose memory is always short one. Seyyid Abdullah ibn El Wazir, Governor of Hodeidah, in his turn spends most of his time in the Tihama and also lacks contact with the Zeidi element who prefer faces and deeds, however unwelcome, to memories and past exploits. Seyyid Muhammad ibn El Wazir, Governor of Dhamar, is a fine looking Governor but little political importance can be attached to him. I believe the Wazirs fancy that they have much more influence with the Shafei tribes than they actually do in fact. The Governor of Taiz, for instance, once told me that he was perfectly well assured of his Shafeis 5 loyalty but I begin to doubt it now. In any event when the present King dies I do not doubt that the Yemeni Shafei tribes on the Taiz border will be restive and give us trouble whether or not the present Governor of Taiz directs their movements into deliberate aggression against our tribesmen. 8. Italian Activities in the Yemen .—I have no fresh information to re port regarding Italian activities in this country. Doctor E. Dubbiosi, the Organising head of Italian activities in this country, returned from leave only Tree days ago. During his absence, Doctor Ferri, who left the country tbout a month ago, and Doctor Cicconi, an alleged high jumper of interna- ional repute some years ago, who was in private practice at Trinidad two rears ago, acted for him. In this interim period they appear to have been 'Ontent to act merely as paymasters to their agents in this country, it is mfortunate that I must leave San’a shortly as Doctor Dubbiosi has doubtless irrived with fresh instructions and it would have been interesting to observe vhether any new form of renewed activities were envisaged. q Doctor Cieconi, who speaks English quite well, told Petrie that he anticipates trouble with Dubbiosi as the latter is a reserved taciturn creature opposed to Iny form of social activity; and Cicconi is a man about town who likes his innocent little parties and recreations. 10. The Italian colony in the Yemen now numbers eleven sou s. cy are :— (a) Doctor E. Dubbiosi . (b) Doctor Cicconi . ■ (c) Signor Kiccuci and wife (d) Signor Clementi and wife . (e) Signor Chapressi » (/) Signor Fausto • a (g) Signor Nevio Gione . • (h) Signor Murucci f Italian doctor in the Yemen, an Surgeon San’a. . 5 to Doctor Dubbiosi and undoubtedly his dit hand man in political work. On s rhority I have it that he has nothing to do th the medical work. He lives in one o± b most secluded parts in San’a m a house lich would be an ideal centre for the visits agents. He is a native of Florence where 3 fomily own vineyards. In age he is abo , speaks Arabic and indifferent French. ,s worked for years in Mogadiscio, irs.

They all fear that circumstances may arise there which will start a general war. 13. Personalities.—{a) Seif El Islam Hussein .—I have heard no talk in this country of this son’s chances for the Imamate although he cannot be ruled out as a candidate. The King considers him to be his most learned and pious son and I understand that this pillar of purity does all he can to foster his father’s belief. The Crown Prince does not seem to have his kmle into him, at present anyhow, and this in itself indicates that he considers him no rival: an intrigue to get him into trouble on his return from London or an attempt to poison him would be a healthy sign and show that his stock was rising. Hussein would he acceptable to the Wazirs and this should be borne in mind. He saw quite a lot of them on his way to Europe via Hodeida and Taiz, and, as he cannot help intriguing, it would not be a far-fetched guess to assume that the future was discussed in detail. In the course of a conversation I had with Raghib a few days ago I sought to sound him about Hussein’s stay in London. He was vague and said that the King himself had only heard three times from him by telegraph. He assured me categorically that no instructions had been given him or tele graphed to him regarding the making of representations in London in any matter or matters other than that of the Palestinians. This is interesting. It is true that the King has his own peculiar little ways of usurping his Foreign Minister’s functions without consulting him but I should be much surprised if he had instructed his son to make any representations in a foreign capital without Raghib’s knowledge. I must aver that on receipt of a recent Foreign Office despatch concerning Hussein’s talks at the Foreign Office I was sur prised to note that he had touched on the question of British representation in the Yemen. I assumed at once that he had acted on his own initiative, and, if Raghib is to be believed, my assumption was correct. ma tter of the selection of the Yemeni Coronation Mission, Raghib told me that m the first instance he had been commanded to head the Corona- natien Mission and he had accepted with alacrity. Later the King decided that a son of his should head the Mission and that Raghib should proceed as second delegate. When Raghib heard that the son was to be Seif El Islam n — ifv, na e ^teatest difficulty, to back out on the grounds PaatebTw V1 SU m i a d : adlock 7r reached apparently that the King told gh b that lf he dld not proceed he would send no Mission : but as the Aden68 Government had already been informed in writing that a Mission would pro ceed, Hussein was eventually instructed to leave without the Foreign Mmis- . r - The latter told me that he had suffered at Hussein’s hands in the past in the matter of his arrogance and autocratic behaviour. I could not help remarking that I had only met this princeling in 1937 and that I could amee taat he was arrogant and autocratic. At my audience with the King on July 17th last he asked me after his “ boy Hussein ”. I replied that when I last saw him he appeared to be in rude health. It appears that he has informed his father that he is suffering from anaemia and that he is consultino- specialists in London. (b) Qadhi Abdullah El Amri. —The Prime Minister is as powerful as ever and is still the King’s most trusted adviser. He is much disturbed about the succession and constantly prays for the King’s long life. In this he is sincere as his own future is very uncertain after King Yahya’s death. In his reference to the Crown Prince he is careful not to criticise him but prays that Allah may guide him and equip him for rulership which implies that at present he is no fit person to rule ; this is the general view and I share it. The Prime Minister is quite certain in his own mind that the Crown Prince will succeed in the first instance and makes no secret about it. Qadhi Abdullah’s relations with Raghib have worsened—if that were possible—and though outwardly they are the best of friends their one desire is to oust the other. Qadhi Abdullah is more charitable than Raghib and merely refers to him as a tiresome old man. (c) Qadhi Muhammad Raghib Bey. —During my stay here this month I have noticed that Raghib, like the King, has aged considerably since October 1936. He finds it more difficult to grasp matters of detail and sometimes has to repeat words to himself before they sink in. He is, I think, over 70 years of age and his thirteen years in this capital without change have worn him down. At the moment he and the Prime Minister are engaged in under ground warfare to such an extent that Raghib is obsessed with it. The vast amount of intrigue in this town and the sinister interpretations attributed to the most innocent acts sometimes lead me to wonder whether I have stumbled on a vast mental institution. It surpasses the bounds of all normal human understanding. As part of my time here is spent listening patiently to stories about the sinister machinations of this person and that, I have to hear a donkey bray or a dog bark before I am brought back to a sense of reality. Raghib suffers from this form of hysteria to a marked extent. I am quite convinced that he would do anything and sacrifice every thing to get out of this country at the earliest opportunity. His relations with all Yemenis are most unhappy but the King will not let him go even if he spurns him and treats him abominably at times. In spite of this, how ever, I believe that he is secretly flattered by the King’s refusal to release him ’and I do not doubt that this alone makes life endurable to him. (d) Seyyid Abdullah ibn El Wazir.—TAiQ Governor of Hodeida still seems to carry his anti-Christian bias to an extreme. He has recently much embarrassed our political clerk in Hodeida and told him quite openly that he would be as difficult and as uncompromising as he could with any person who served the Christians. Mr. Salih Jafar deserves commendation for his tact and self-possession as his patience has been sorely tried. Seyyid Abdullah for all his outward show of dignity and grandeur is a chicken-hearted posewr. I am quite sure that, like his cousin in Taiz, he is piqued at the Aden Govern- ment’s apparent disregard of the importance of the Wazirs while he knows that we want no quarrel with the Yemeni Government and its officials. In the circumstances he feels that he is safe enough to vent his spleen on and derive malicious pleasure in baiting Mr. Salih Jafar who is wise enough to remain unruffled. It is clear that he is acting deliberately and for a set pur pose and his anti-Christian pose serves the object m view Like his cousin in Taiz, but in a different manner, I think he strives to make it emerge Wazirs can be a nuisance if they are not placated. Seyyid Abdullah met his cousin, the Governor of Taiz in Apnl last These two had not met for fifteen years or more and it is “Atw this meet- that they discussed future Waziri P ollc y“P^the most corfflafand ing it was reported that their relations had not been of the most cordial ana I suppose that this has now been remedied. 59(C) ExAffai/dDfepfi(56) Enclosure in Colonial Office letter No. P.

I have heard little or nothing on my present visit regarding Seyyid Abdullah’s bid for the Imamate. His relations with the Crown Prince are as bad as ever and I do not think that there is any chance of improvement. The Crown Prince is well aware of the Wazir’s aspirations and his watch on them is relentless as it is menacing. (e) Seyyid Ali ibn el TFazir.—The Governor of Taiz requested me to return via Taiz on my way back to Aden as he wanted to speak to me con fidentially. This I promised to do. (As the overland route was flooded I could not return via Taiz.) 14. The Army.—It is reliably reported that the King is endeavouring to introduce a system of conscription in this country. His idea is to institute a period of four months with the colours and that on the expiry of this period the trained reservists will be released but not before fresh batches arrive in San’a to replace them. So far the experiment has not proved successful as only about 1,600 tribesmen have been enrolled. I understand the tribes are suspicious and fear that once their tribesmen have been enrolled they will not be released. The powerful Hashid tribe has so far stood out against any form of conscription and the King is negotiat ing with them now. 15. For the training of the conscripts the King has engaged the services of Hassan Tahsin Pasha who claims to have been G. O. C. of the Hejazi troops in Jedda during the Saudi-Hejazi war. The Pasha called on me during my present visit. He claims to have been a divisional commander in the Turkish Army during the war and says he is 58 years of age. He is either older than he claims to be or was not a divisional commander during the Great War. In any event he is full of enthusiasm about his task and states that he has excellent material in the Zeidi tribesmen for whom the conscription system has been introduced. I did not like to damp his ardour but I fear he has a heart breaking task.70 Enclosure to S. No. (56). Record of Mr. Salih Jafar’s conversations with certain Yemeni OFFICIALS ON HIS RETURN JOURNEY TO HODElDA FROM ADEN (AUGUST 6 th—9th). V ® n , his . return j° OTne y t° Hodeida Mr. Salih Jafar visited Seyvid AH ibn El VV azir, Governor-General of the Taiz district. Seyyid Ali told Mr. Salih Jafar that an Italian Mission, headed by the Governor of Asmara, was expected to proceed to the Yemen in September in order to open pouvpcLTlcfs for the renewal of the Italo-Yemeni treaty. Syyid Ali remarked that the Mission was expected to ask for concessions in the Yemen. 2. At Haiss in the Yemeni Tihama Mr. Salih Jafar had talks with Sheikh Ali Muhammad Noman (a non-Zeidi) the Amil (Governor) of Haiss. Sheikh Ali told Mr. Salih Jafar that Seyyid Ali ibn El Wazir (the Governor General of the Taiz district) was a bitter enemy of the Noman family. He added that a complaint had been lodged by the family of the late Ali Pasha of Udain against Seyyid Ali for the misappropriation of about two-thirds of their property valued at about 100,000 dollars ; and that a letter from Seyyid Ali to his San’a agent had been intercepted and was now in the hands of Sheikh Abdul Wahab Noman (the uncle of the Haiss Amil) in which the true facts of the Ali Pasha case were revealed. The intercepted letter also contained statements derogatory to the Yemeni Government. Sheikh Ali said that this letter was to be handed to Seif El Islam Ahmed, the Crown Prince, in San’a. Mr. Salih Jafar was further informed that Seif El Islam Ahmed had recently required the personal attendance in San’a of Seyyid Ali to answer the charges brought against him by the Ali Pasha family but that the King had not allowed the issue of the summons. This had much upset the Crown Prince. According to Sheikh Ali Muhammad Noman, the Governor General of Taiz is disliked by the Shafei tribesmen in the Taiz district. 3. Mr. Salih Jafar arrived at Zabid in the Yemeni Tihama on the even ing of August 8th and stayed the night as the guest of Sheikh Ali ibn Hamud of Kaukaban the Amil (Governor) of Zabid who is one of the many claimants to the Imamate. He informed Mr. Salih Jafar that when he had left San’a he had been given a document (apparently that reported in paragraph 6479 of the Aden Political Intelligence Summary) and was asked not only to sign it but also to obtain the signatures of the leading personalities in the Zeidi highlands and in the Tihama in which the signatories signified their willing ness to the proclamation of Seif El Islam Ahmed as Crown Prince and as King after the death of King Yahya. Seyyid Ali said that he had succeeded in collecting the signatures of all the parties concerned (? including that of the Wazirs). o -r 4. Seyyid Ali remarked that if after the death of King Yahya, Seif El Islam' Ahmed failed as a ruler and the Yemen decided to have a King (and thus abolished the Imamate) Seyyid Ali ibn El Wazir (Governor General o the Taiz district) would, in his opinion, have the majority of the people be hind him • but that in the event of the continuance of the Imamate, Seyyid Abdullah ibn El Wazir (cousin of Seyyid Ah ibn El Wazir) the Governor of Hodeida or another personality (meaning himself) might well be elected. 5 Sewid Ali concluded his conversation by saying that he hoped that the British 7 Government would stop foreign interference in the Yemen and help to maintain its independence.

M. the King has read Mr. Eden’s reply to the royal message which I communicated to you on the 19th Jumad-ath-Thani 1356 (August 26th 1937), and I have to say that H. M. the King wishes to make it clear to the British Government that Sheikh Kamil el Qassab left here convinced that there would be no need to convene a general Arab conference as he had pre viously intended: but owing to a delay which resulted in his not arriving in Syria at the time which he had originally fixed for his return, persons who were desirous of holding the conference had without delay issued invitations for the 8th day of September : and that persons from Iraq who shared their interest in the conference had already agreed to convene the conference. The conveners of the conference have therefore apologised to us saying that though they approved of our idea, and wished to comply with our desire, the arrangements which were made had already progressed so far that it would have been impolitic to change them entirely. They were therefore content to make as few arrangements as possible. (58) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter No. P. Z. 6601/37, dated the 6th October 1937. Received on 30th October 1937 with Political Secretary' 1 s letter No. 41, dated the 14th October 1937. (Notes by G. W. Rendel, dated the 29th September 1937.) ... 'J.' /'' 1 ’ the Counsellor of the Italian Embassy, raised this question i; ■ &lt;- ,l l /, e ' 1 em er He said that he had at first thought of ffid not w;sh O ffirl 1 •?? the sub J ect &gt; bu t that the Italian Government advance of the oroo N * con “^tion to be made at this stage in authorised to exoFio th! .

He had, however, been suggested that ncrlinos t// T le T s V 1 a preliminary and informal way, and he forus to have Tn iZed re *^ WDuld ba f°r him to do this orally and ioi us TO nave an agreed record of the conversation. 2. I replied that this seemed to me onpn . i • a i record would be an even more formal P » 2 ? °. b .l ee * lons - An a S reed written note and would need verv ear/f n nd c . ommittm g document than a I should be very glad to hear imftl,,' ' i' v working out. I added that while was really much advanatge in di^eulinZtffi. t0 Z 1 do ' bted wh, ; ther there 6 iscussmg the matter further until we knewrather more about what was likely to happen over the proposed general con versations m Rome, If these conversations took place, it might be conve nient, just before they started, to have a talk about the present question ; but if they were for any reason delayed, I doubted whether much would be gained by a preliminary discussion at this end of this particular question in isolation. 3. Signor Crolla then said that he thought perhaps the best thing to do would be to show me the draft of an informal communication which he had prepared, stating the Italian point of view. This was a kind of aide memoire, in Italian only, which he said he could not leave with me but which he would like me to read. 4. I went through this document with him. Its main thesis was that the Rome Understanding of 1927 applied not only to the Red Sea area but to Southern Arabia as a whole. It represented that it was an essential prin- eiple of the Rome Understanding that the status quo existing at the time of its signature should not be modified except by agreement and in consulta tion with the Italian Government. The Italian Government at that time had known nothing of our claims over what we now called the northern and eastern areas of the Aden Protectorate, i.e. the Hadramaut, Shehr, Mokalla, etc., and they could only regard our new “ forward ” policy in this area— which in their view had the effect of adding some 40,000 square miles to the Aden Protectorate—as an annexation of territory in violation of the Rome Understanding. This contention was supported in the draft by a number of extremely flimsy arguments, several of which I was able to controvert immediately, though Signor Crolla naturally professed not to be convinced. The draft aide memoire was accompanied by a draft annex giving specific instances of our alleged forward policy. 5. I told Signor Crolla that it was obvious from the text of the Rome Understanding itself that that Understanding was not intended to refer to any of the areas in Arabia which were under our protection. Had it been intended to deal with this part of Arabia those areas would, of course, have been mentioned. But there was no mention even of the Aden Protectorate in the agreement, although the existence of the Protectorate and our interest in it was of course well known and generally accepted at the time. I presum ed that the Italian Government were not trying to challenge our position at Aden, although the argument developed in Signor Crolla’s draft could be read as an attempt to do so. 6. Signor Crolla admitted that the Rome Understanding could not be regarded as in any way interfering with our rights in the Aden Protectorate, but he repeated that the Protectorate, as then understood by the Italian Government, was a much smaller area than what we now claimed, and again urged in support of this contention, that it had always been so shown on ail published maps etc. Seeing an atlas on my table, he suggested t h at « e should look it up in proof of his contention. The atlas was Suieler s Hanct- atlas 1921 edition, and contained an excellent map of Arabia, on win , Simior Crolla s discomfiture, practically the whole of the southern coast of Arabia turned out to be marked red, as a British possession. (This - piece of luck, for I fear that Signor Crolla is on stronger g^^U^dfica- onlar noint even than he thinks, since there are many old official puhlica tions—including I believe, India Office and Colonial Office lists—-describing ^he Protectorate as a very much smaller area than what we now claim Sffinor Crolla again emphasised that what the Italians complained o was n the Aden Protectorate but what he described as our attempt to extenl the boundaries of the ^ 50 ° miles to the east and for a great distance into the hmterla . 7. I explained to Signor Crolla ^ ‘here^a^ in the political situation. Our spher , iqiq There had never been bounded by the Anglo-Turkish boundaries of 19^ the slightest question of our extending our mflue^ b^y ^ ^ ^ which had been our sphere since long ® ^ south eastern corner of always claimed special rights.

Arabia ” were obviously only loo y ^ t h a t we claimed no rights The Rome Understanding did f r f p Xe rcis e a form of protectorate over in Arabia. We had always clam Trucial coast and at Bahrein a number of Arabian states, es P ccl Uui r a mau t as part of the Aden Protec- and Koweit. Our rights over the Hadramaut, as parr o torate, were of precisely the same character. 9 Finallv SUnor Crolla said that he had been instructed to suggest that ernments ” ^s ^IZ^lvlrZZntiTe Rom^Understanding on this in the Hadramaut, pending the clarification of the issue. 10 I replied to this that I would note what he had said but that I did not see how we could possibly accede to this request since we regarded the measures in question as a purely internal matter affecting the administration of territory under British protection, and not affected by the Rome Under standing in any way. The territorial status quo in Arabia was not affected. t . 11. Eventually, it was agreed that Signor Crolla should write me a private letter embodying, with some slight modifications, the text of the draft aide memoire he had shown me. He showed some reluctance to do this, but I thought it best to ask him to put what he had said in writing as we may as well know the worst, and it may be useful to have the Italian arguments in their own words, in order that we may begin considering the best way of answering them. 12. I think we can only await Signor Crolla’s letter, but it looks as though the Italians were working up a somewhat tiresome case about this, and as though we might have a good deal of trouble with them before we have- done. Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated the 7th October 1937. Received on 30th October 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 41, dated the 14th October 1937. Notes by G. W. Rend el, dated the 27th September 1937. Copy No. E. 5648/306/91. Signoi Ci oil a, the Counsellor of the Italian Embassy, told me this after noon that he had been instructed to ascertain whether we were yet in a posi- tl .' 11 f ep ]y , to tfe representations he had made to Mr. Baggallay in August Ut'V U'r 6 0f n the Brltish ClviI Administrator in Kamaran. He repeated that the Italian Government had been disturbed to see that the “ regente ” *’ ’ 1 , ' : '| &lt; i’' ara ' t |'’ e s , tatl0n now described as Civil Administrator. This seemed to imply a degree of authority—and indeed a claim to sovereignty— “no m Euronean P 6 P ? OV ® on pd down in the Rome Understanding that Italhn Go™rnnfnT e h r U r t stab!lsh ^ Kamaran ”, and the tered G ° Vemment hoped that we ^uld take steps to have this title al- a misapprehension. 1 ^hL^w^hadTeef 116 l taliai } Govern ment were under observing our undertaWngUC^mUv^ lfoU SCrUpU 0US “ we had, as he knew, alwavs carried U rn 7 k d f soverei gnty m Kamaran, tion in the island. &amp;we were “^03^ °f administra- responsible for the quarantine station74 as the great majority of pilgrims were British subjects, it was obviouslv necessary to make sure that the rest of the island was reasonably weS manalf ed, and this involved a certain degree of administration, policeing, etc But we exercised these functions in precisely the same provisionally as we managed the quarantine station, and there was absolutely no question of their involving any sort of claim to sovereignty. Indeed, I had good reason to know that we had carefully refrained on many occasions from taking action e.gr. embarking on any development of the island—which might hare looked as though we were trying to peg out a claim or dig ourselves in. 3. As regards the title of Civil Administrator, this title had been used ever since we had been in the island, and certainly long before the time of the Rome Conversations. I confirmed, through Mr. Grey of the Library, that as long ago as May, 1926, the British official responsible for the administra tion of the island was officially known as the Civil Administrator. 4. The point I emphasised to Signor Crolla was that there had been no change at all since the time of the Rome Conversations, and that nothing whatever had been done to alter the status of the island. 5. Signor Crolla seemed slightly shaken by this explanation, which he promised to report to his Government, GlPl) — 59(C) EsAffairsDopt—32 - 17-8-38 --25,120 (Received on 15th August 1937, with Political Secretary’s letter No ‘&gt;30 dated 29th July 1937.) ' ’ possible to_ obtain any definite or circumstantial reports regarding these inci dents, but in view of the persistence of the rumours, it seemed desirable that investigations should be conducted as to their accuracy. 2. On the 18th of June therefore I sent the Second Political Officer, Captain the Honourable R. A. B. Hamilton, to the Subeihi country, and between that date and June the 25th, he visited five different centres in the area concerned while a dhow acting under his orders visited Perim and Sheikh Sa ’id. 3. As a result of his investigation, Captain Hamilton has come to the con clusion that within the last two months the Italians have turned their attention to the deep anchorage that lies to the west of Ras al Ara on the coast between Aden ami Perim. He further thinks that they have established some sort of communi cation with the shore ; there were repeated references by the local Arabs to “ a white-painted steamer ’ ’ which had approached the land, and to a vessel described as a submarine that had been seen on several occasions near the shore. 4. It seems possible that the Italians may have explored, in submarines, the Ras-al-Ara anchorage ; and it is averred that during the last tw T o months Italian submarines have frequently been seen between Ras-al-Ara and Bir Saqeiya. Finally, it is reported that Italian agents have visited Saqeiya and another village in the vicinity and have lectured the people on the weakness of Britain and the strength of Italy. 5. You will, no doubt, appreciate the extreme difficulty of establishing the truth or falsehood of such reports ; for naturally, as soon as it is known that investigations to that end are being made, it is hard to find anyone who will admit to any knowledge which might connect him with the subversive activities of a foreign power. But, while I am satisfied that no “ gun-running ”, or distri bution of money on a large scale has recently taken place within the Protecto rate, I am nevertheless forced to the conclusion that Italian agents have, of late, been active in the Subeihi country. 6. This attempt to introduce Italian influence into the Arabian mainland adjacent to Sheikh Said would be in keeping with the suspected Italian design of securing control of both coasts of the southern Red Sea, and of thereby gaining command of the Straits of Bab-el-Mandab, in the furtherance of which project Italy is believed recently to have fortified Dumeira and Rsheita on the African shore opposite Perim. 7. At this stage I desire merely to acquaint you with the situation as it has presented itself to me, and to state that I am considering’ what steps should be taken locally to counteract these activities. At present, I am examining the possibility of adopting two complementary measures ; the establishment m the Subeihi country of posts from which reliable information could be collected and reported and the urging of His Highness the Sultan of Lahej to take a more active interest in a thorough surveillance of the Subeihi country. 8. I propose shortly to submit to you a further report with my recoin mendations for dealing with the situation. I Enclosure 1 to Serial No. (65). 1937. of a letter addressed to me by H.

On the other hand, the visit of a Sloop to such waters would be a normal occurrence and likely to pass unnoticed. The landing of Italians on various Islands in the Red Sea has been con stantly reported, and with one exception only these reports have proved entirely false. I do understand, however, that some Italians have been prospecting for oil in the Sarafan and other Islands, and I have even heard it rumoured that they have asked permission to prospect in Kamaran Island and its vicinity. I am not, however, so seriously concerned about the above information, as I am of the fact that Italians have engaged a large number of Yemeni subjects during the last year for service in Eritrea as labourers, or possibly even, accord ing to some reports, as soldiers. Apparently the Italians send these labourers back to Hodeida periodically,, with ample sums of money, and engage others in their place. It is surely unreasonable to engage labourers for such short periods, if efficient labour is what the Italians require ; on the other hand, if their inten tion is to influence the natives of the Yemen for other purposes, this is precisely the action needed. In any case the Italians appear to find plenty of money to pay them. The Political aspect of this matter is hardly within my province, but should my premise be correct, and the process of educational propaganda continue. I mel that under certain conditions an Italian Yemen would be easy to bring about. J &amp; I have no doubt that in that case the balance might be rectified by the oppo sition ot Saudi Arabia.

Enclosure 3 to Serial No. (65). Letter from Governor, Aden, to His Excellency the Naval Commander-in- Chief, East Indies Station, Colombo, No. C.-689, dated the 19th June 1937. I have the honour to refer to Your Excellency’s secret and personal letter No. E.I.-3464 [Enclosure 2 io Serial No. (65)], dated 5th June 1937, and to thank you for the assistance that you offer in the use of Red Sea Sloops in dealing with the developments of the situation in southern Red Sea and in the neighbourhood of Aden. There is no doubt that the Italians are endeavouring to forward their interests in the Yemen by every means available short of direct and open inter vention. Their propaganda work in the Yemen, and especially in the coastal Tihama, is increasingly active, and the frequent rumours of their occupation of islands in the Red Sea are a sign of the general apprehension that prevails. The engagement of Yemenis as labourers and sometimes as soldiers, to which you refer, is one of the methods that they adopt to increase their influence. LTnfcrtunately it is not within our power to stop it. The recruitment of Arabs from southern Arabia for Italian Colonial Force is a practice of long standing which commenced before the Great War and has continued at intervals since that time. It has been increased since the autumn of 1935 owing firstly to the Abyssinian war and more recently to the need for labour for carrying out the extensive works of development that Italy is undertaking at Massawa, Assab and other places in her East African possessions. The Italians offer good wages which appeal to the inhabitants of poor countries such as the Yemen and also the Aden Protectorate. Arabs coming back from Italian employment frequently bring stories of ill-treatment, but they are generally prepared to undergo this for the sake of their financial gain. Incidentally a good deal of the money that they bring with them is smuggled, as the Italian authorities have forbidden the export of lire. 2. I do not think that the short periods for which the labourers work are- altogether the result of Italian design. It is customary for such labourers to work for a comparatively short time and to return to their families with the money earned, and in this respect the Italians allow them to follow their incli nations The Yemen is an independent State, and it is not possible for us 10 prevent this labour recruitment, nor would it in any way add to British popu- laritv in southern Arabia if we were to debar its people from taking advantage of an opportunitv of making money. It is this desire to make money that is the dominating motive with these people and although the Itahans no doubt ^n t extend their influence through them, the reports that they bnn &amp; a e y means always favourable. 8 We have recenly had reports of the appearance of vessels, suspected of being Itellan ( &gt;f£ Uxe /oast immediately to the east of * b en limits of the Aden Protectorate.

DATED THE Speaking of Palestine today Ibn Saud spoke with anxiety of his own situation. He had always considered the maintenance of position of His y njes y s Government as essential to his own and Zionism had brought them in.o great peril. He spoke of Italy with his usual fear and distrust. I notice tnat whereas in March the waving of the sword of Islam by Mussolini amused inn, he said today that it was astounding to what extent Mussolini in spite of ms. well-known ill-treatment of Arabs in Libya had been accepted by Arabs as their champion. _2. That Ibn Saud should worry about his own fate in case of collapse of His Majesty’s Government is an indication that he would not help to embarrass them (except as I think in case of difficulties of war when prizes that could be offered him would be very tempting) but it is also proof that his fears for effect of Palestine policy on His Maj’esty’s Government are genuine.

It is therefore advisable for intending travellers to obtain the permission of this Residency before visiting places in the interior. This is all the more important when the traveller is accompanied by a party from a Foreign Government. It has been reported that you wish to visit Markha on your return journey.

No. (1). Telegram from Acting Resident, Aden, to Mr. Philby, Mdkalla, No. C/1447, dated 7th September 1936. I have been instructed by His Majesty’s Government to request you to withdraw your Sa’udi armed party from the Aden Protectorate as soon as possible and to inform you that it would have been preferable for you to have informed British authorities of your intention to visit protectorate before your visit took place. Reference your signal of 2nd September. I appreciate that necessity took you into the Hadhramaut but as far as I am aware necessity did not take you and your Sa’udi armed party to Shabwa which is definitely within the Aden Protectorate. Further the Ahl Karab who roam the vicinity of Shabwa and whose Chief lives there are nominally vassals of the Upper Aulaqi Sultan (Handbook of Arabia). The recognised Northern boundary of the Aden Protectorate from near Dhala North eastwards is indicated by a N. E. line and is as you state undemarcated and to a great extent unexplored and the political status of territory South of this line which includes Shabwa is not a matter for discussion as it is de facto under the protection of His Ma jesty’s Government. The Bal Harith tribe N. E. of Beihan A1 Qasab are under the Sharif of Beihan who is a treaty Chief, and I must request you with your Sa’udi armed party not to enter Beihan territory including that of the Bal Harith unless traverse across a portion of the latter is necessary for topographical reasons, and should you desire to visit Beihan yourself unaccompanied by armed Sa’udis to inform me before you leave Mukalla. Your spare parts should leave Aden tomorrow. Enclosure 8 to S. No. (1). Cypher telegram from the Resident, Aden, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, No. 71, dated 9th September 1936. (Repeated to Jedda.) Following reference Philby from reliable Hadhramaut sources. Philby told Hadhramaut notables of Ibn Saud’s intention of constructing motor road from Mecca to Hadhramaut. 300 men with Phdby distributed bet ween Reidatasseiar and Alabr constructing houses. As far as is known both of these places are well within Hadhramaut (please refer to Reilly s tele gram of the 19th March). If these reports true Philby s assurance to me contained in telegram that his journey had no official character appears to be inaccurate. I sent telegram to Philby yesterday on hnes of your un numbered telegram of 1st September. Enclosure 9 to S. No. (1). Letter from the Acting Resident, Aden, to the Secretary or State L for the Colonies, No. 492, dated 30th September 1936. I have the honour to refer you to the correspondence ending with my Secret despatch No. 432 of 9th September, 1936 in connection with the re cent activities of Mr. Philby in the Aden Protectorate. 2. I returned yesterday from a visit by air to Mukalla and the rantable interference.4. I found that Mr ?o aiert CweU t p' of Sa’udi Govemment at every opp * ^ come under the rule of Ibn Sa’ud. of the Hadhramaut would fare w the Western boundary of the Hadh- Mr. Philby declared the country » w hich would soon be taken ramaut and Najran to be a N^man^ ^ ^ ^ of whioh Shab over by Ibn Sa ud.

I have no reason to doubt the truth of the statements made to me which were given by responsible and reliable persons. &lt;&gt; Mr Philby also spread abroad that Ibn Sa’ud “ intended to make a At ™fnr traffic from Mecca to the Hadhramaut ”, as already reported. Tha/rnot the opportunity in this despatch to comment on the advantages of such a road befng constructed. But were such a scheme to be considered it would be a matte? for His Majesty’s Government to discuss with the Sa udi Government, and for Mr. Philby to proclaim that Ibn Sa ud ‘‘intends to make the road, as if the country immediately to the West of the Hadhra- maut was Sa’udi territory and not part of the Aden Protectorate, is gross impertinence. 6. I do not think that much attention was paid to Mr. Philby’s Sa’udi nronaganda by those who really count in the Hadhramaut and Qu aiti terri tory and possibly the visit of the Air Officer Commanding and myself with five aircraft immediately after Mr. Philby’s visit counteracted to a certain extent its effects. But there is always a faction in most communities who are anti-Government and an easy prey for foreign intriguers and the Hadhramaut is no exception, added to which there is an Irshadi element which has for some years been trying to overthrow the influence of the Seiyids of the Hadhramaut and to spread the tenets of the Wahabi faith. I, there fore, take a serious view of the diffusion of any determined Sa’udi propaganda in the Hadhramaut such as that in which Mr. Philby has recently been engaged. 7. I am not in a position to give an opinion as to whether Mr. Philby’s recent activities had the support of Ibn Sa’ud. Mr. Hope Gill, who has known both for some years, thinks not. Possibly Mr. Philby’s apparent desire to cover the whole of Arabia in the course of his travels and to try to be the first European to cross an unexplored route or to visit a town of historical interest (in this case—Shabwa) may have furnished the real reason for his recent journey, and that, being such an ardent admirer of Ibn Sa’ud, he could not resist the temptation to proclaim aloud the virtues of his hero, but, in view of the conversations now being conducted by His Majesty’s Government with the Sa’udi Government over the boundaries of Sa’udi Arabia, and of Ibn Sand’s tendency to claim more than His Majesty’s Government is willing to cede, it is quite likely that Mr. Philby’s intrigue may have had the unofficial, if not the official, support of the King, and that it was financed by the latter {vide last paragraph of Boyal Air Force report enclosed). In any case, as Mr. Philby is the protege of Ibn Sa’ud, I assume that His Majesty s Government will take up this matter with the Sa’udi Govern* ment and address a strong protest. Mr.. Philby still calls himself an Englishman and I under- iat kf m re ^ipt of a pension from the Government of India.

It is reported by Sheikh Omer Baobeid, a well-known merchant in Aden, who arrived from his country (Shibam) last week, that El Haj Abdulla Philhy stayed many days at Shibam and told the people there that the object of his visit was to open a motor road from Nejran to the Hadhramaut and to encourage the trade in Ford cars, as he is a Ford Agent in Hejaz. nardE* ,r Mkpti He praised highly Ibn Saud, Abdul Aziz, and advised the Aqils and Sheikhs to proceed to Hejaz and to conclude a treaty with Abdul Aziz, as the latter is willing to accept this and will do his best to please them in everything. 3d to maid ady reporttl ie advait^ be conil® iththeSa’ii d “inteii| : ftheHadk otectorate, i In the Hadhramaut most of the people were astonished to hear this and replied that their country was under British protection. He told them it was wrong to say that, as the Hadhramaut is an independent country and they had a lot to gain by concluding a treaty with Ibn Saud. He also said that from Nejran to the border of the Hadhramaut all the tribes agreed to be under Saudi protection. He tried to convince the Hadhramant people of the generosity of Ibn Saud and advised them to take this chance and to accompany him back to Hejaz. He spoke ill of the British Government’s policy and indicted the British for their cruelty towards the Arabs of Palestine. He used his radio daily whilst there and allowed anyone who wished to hear it.

It is said that last year some of the Aqils of the Hadhramaut visited Ibn Saud and returned to their country praising the Sultan’s generosity. Three of the head Sheikhs of the well-known Hadhramaut tribe of Saar, accompanied Philby to Hejaz to visit the Saudi Sultan. Philhy had with him three Ford cars (two lorries and a four-seater). He came to the Hadhramaut with the small car and one lorry; the second lorry was kept at Shubwa. He was very modest and generous and the Hadhramaut people liked him very much. Enclosure 11 to S.

We gathered from his conversations with us that P n ? • hlv praises the Sa’udi Government in a way which signifies a spirit • J propaganda in their favour. Ti was clear from information received from the persons with whom he i ^ interviews both at Mukalla and Hadhramaut, that he had spread pro- had favour 0 f the Sa’udi Government.

The visits of armed missions to the Hadhramaut without previous information or per- mission are not appreciated. We should like to bring to your notice that the Irshadiyan Community in the Hadhramaut and Java may have some connection with the Sa’udi Government. There are in this community many of the Ahl Kathir. Per haps even the Irshadiyan Community might have had a hand in the arrival of Sheikh Abdullah Philby to the Hadhramaut for at the very time in which Sheikh Abdullah Philby came to the Hadhramaut, there appeared from the Kathiri Irshaid Community a notification both on the coast and in the in terior of the Hadhramaut containing a clear call to the people to join the Flag of the Sa’udi Government. You will find herewith a copy of the notifica tion attached to this letter for your perusal. The issue of such a notification necessitates the watching of the activities of the Kathiri Community at Java. We request you kindly to think carefully over this matter. We shall watch those around us in our part. Enclosure 12 to S. No. (1). Letter from the Acting Resident, Aden, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, No. 521, dated 21st October 1936.

We write this to inform you, oh friend, that a European with Sa’udi soldiers arrived at Shabwa some time back. We thought that they were mere travellers but they prolonged their stay at Shabwa. On 14th Rajab (30th September 1936) they arrived at Wadi Hammam with the intention of entering Markha but they were not allowed to do so by the Nasiyi tribe and therefore they returned to Shabwa which is situated on the trade route through which our merchandise passes to Hadhramaut. We are afraid that our subjects and caravans proceeding to Hadhramaut may be harmed. We request Government kindly to inform us whether the Sa’udi Govern ment have been given any authority over the Hadhrami interior. As far as we ’Aulaqis are concerned, we do not wish them to enter our country at all because we are already in treaty relations with the British Government and do not wish to enter into any engagement with any other Foreign Govern ments we are maintaining our friendly relations with the British Government. We request the British Government to reply to us on this subject as soon as possible. Enclosure 14 to S. No. (1).

Letter from the Acting Resident, Aden, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, No. 544, dated 4th November 1936. I have the honour to submit a copy ot a letter received, irom tiie lying of the Yemen on the subject of Mr. Philby’s recent journey to the Hadhramaut in the course of which it now appears that he travelled without leave through Yemeni territory. 2. Captain Seager, who has now returned to Aden from his visit to San’a reports that the King has been both offended and alarmed by Mr. Philby’s passage through his country. It is well known that the King has the strongest objection to the entry of any foreigners into any part of the Yemen without his previous knowledge and permission, and this Residency is always careful to respect his wishes in this respect. Mr. Philby’s arrival within Yemeni borders without authority having been obtained or even sought is therefore both an affront to the Yemeni Government and an embarrassment to the Aden Residency, through which the visists of British subjects to the Yemen are usually arranged. His inconsiderate and discourteous action has become a more serious offence through the fact that he was accompanied by an armed party and that he appears to have indulged in propaganda unfriendly to Yemeni interests. These circumstances suggest a challenge on his part to Yemeni Sovereignty over the districts mentioned in the King’s letter to me. 3. The districts in question are A1 Jof and Marib. These have been m emem occupation since 1926 and 1927 respectively. They lie to the south of the Saudi-Yemeni frontier established by the Treaty of Talf in 1934 and are well to the north of the boundary J the Aden Protectorate S tiuTw, the n ef ° re t be '! 0 Ta j ld reason to question the Yemeni claim to them sood AiSo years ’ and itis Prejudicial to by a British^ubieot and ef T 8 claim shoilld a PP ear to be disputed of the British Government and who is^tm^rded^^^i 11 SerViCe pying a quasi-representative position in sludi^AmbTa^ “ ° CCU ' Septtbrt^tnllunate^cZTT'Vb 0 !? 0 ' “ his '. des P at &lt;* 30th and the Hadhramaut and of bL *r ^hilby s incursion into Shabwa years been accepted by His Maiestv’T^m^^ tlie + llne T* 1 ! 011 has for Inan y boundary of the Aden Profeofmil ^ Government as being the northern possible-for His Ma^es^’s'Govermnent^tn ’ a , nd I ^ that it will be manner in respect of both the Yempn Q i4-i lndl A C ^ te m solne unmistakable wholly condeL Mr. PhilVs^LTo^^ that the ^Enclosure 18 to S.

From His Majesty the Imam Yahya bin Muhammad Hamid-ud-Din, to His Excellency Sir Bernard Beilly, K.C.M.G., C.I.E., O.B.E., Kesident, etc. We extend to your Excellency our respects. We beg to call your kind attention to an incident which we regret to report to Your Excellency and which has happened during your absence from Aden on leave. This incident has caused all kinds of doubt and un easiness in all parts of the country and a great deal of surprise and amaze ment due to our ignorance of its reason. Mr. Philby, wl o has chosen to reside in the Hejaz for some years, claimed in the month of July last to be the representative of Great Britain and thus earned for himself the immunities and privileges accorded to Political Re presentation. He brought a group of armed men and, with them, crossed the Yemini Boundary in cars near Najran and came down to the Hadhramaut where he told them (the Hadhramis) different stories. He claimed that he would construct a motorcar road between the Hejaz and the Hadhramaut and that he would erect in some places stations and buildings. We have heard from certain people that Mr. Philby encouraged our people to take aggressive measures against the Yemeni Government and its territories. He entered Marib and Jof and said different things. Mr. Philby is a British sub ject and is still under British protection. His entrance into our country with armed men without permission violates international regulations as does his wandering about within our country and the making of declarations against our Government. His strange conduct has excited our people and we are sure that Great Britain never permits or encourages any such unwarranted behaviour. We therefore earnestly beg Your Excellency to request your Govern- ment who is aware of every single thing that happens, to inquire carefully into the matter and to be good enough to inform us of the real reason for this strange incident. We also request the British Government to inflict a suitable punishment on Mr. Philby and to assure the non-repetition of such an incident in the future. In conclusion we extend our respect and wishes for your good health. Enclosure 19 to S. No. (1).

Mr. Ormsby Gore further con- Sders that the circumstances justify a strong protest being made to the Saudi Government, and I am accordingly to request that, if Mr Eden sees no ob- iection His Majesty’s Representative at Jedda be instructed to make repre- sentations on the following lines:— (1) His Majesty’s Government consider that it was in any circumstances impolitic and discourteous on the part of Mr. Philby to enter the Aden Pro tectorate accompanied by Saudi personnel without first informing the Re sident at Aden and seeking permission, and that in the present case, in which the Saudi party which accompanied him was armed, his action was quite unwarrantable/ In spite of the Acting Resident's request that he should withdraw his party, he deliberately attempted to penetrate further into the Protectorate. (2) It is apparent that Mr. Philby, in the course of his journeys in the Protectorate sought to convince the people of the advantages which would accrue to them if they were to come under the rule of the Saudi Government, and even suggested that the Saudi Government would be prepared to render assistance to them if it were asked for. He generally gave the impression that parts of the Protectorate were a “ No Man’s Land ” which would one day be absorbed into the Saudi Kingdom. In his statements concerning the designs of the Wahabi King to construct a motor road from Mecca to the Hadhramaut, he appears to have ignored the fact that before any such work were undertaken it would first be necessary to consult the British Govern ment, since a large part of the territory through which the road would pass is under the protection of His Majesty. (3) It is clear that Mr. Philby’s visits to certain of the local Sheikhs were unsolicited and that his activities in their territories were regarded by them as being an unwarrantable interference in their local affairs. More over, the statements which he made appear to have given rise to a feeling of apprehension amongst certain of the local Sheikhs that some arrangement or the control of this area might have been reached, unknown to them, bet- 1 t alest - v 8 Government and the Saudi Government. It appears that this lee,ing was shared by the King of the Yemen. In view of the en- S - e J 'JP ressl011 created by Mr. Philby it was found necessary to insert ‘tic™ the issue of the Protectorate Gazette for October to the effect that no permission of any sort was accorded to Mr. Philby for his journey into the Protectorate and that His Majesty’s Government lent no countenance whatever to the statements he was reported to have made ther e : Philbv and 8 thefts f e&lt;d the attitude adopted by Mr. aron^a/md v': ^ Proteiorato Government and the Saudi Government! 118 between His Ma i esty 3{Received on 23rd January 1931 with Political Secretary's letter No. 1. dated 7 th January 1937).

With reference to your telegram No. 93 of the 17th September, enquiring whether any light can be thrown from Jedda upon the activities of Mr. Philby in the Hadhramaut, I have the honour to report that no information of any kind has come to the notice of the Legation, from local sources, save that since the receipt of your telegram under reference enquiries made from Mr. Philby’s firm of Sharqieh Ltd. have elicited the fact that they have recently received a letter from Mokalla in which Mr. Philby stated his intention of returning to the Hejaz via Najran. I consider it unlikely that the clerk in charge of Sharqieh Ltd. knows anything more than the bare facts of his employer’s movements. 2. It will be observed from paragraph 196 of Jedda Report for May last, that Mr. Philby was reticent about his plans, before departure on this journey but that Sir Andrew Ryan derived the impression that the undertaking was one of Mr. Philby’s periodical journeys of exploration. 3.

With reference to Mr. Calvert’s Confidential despatch No. 239 of the 5th September last, I have the honour to report that the Italian Legation has recently distributed locally further copies of. the Barid-al-Barqa, the newspaper in Arabic published at Benghazi. Copies dated 16th and 24th August and the 8th September have come to my notice. 2. Much of the news contained in these three issues is not worth report- in' in* detail. In that of the 6th September, however, is a leading article en titled : “ Pacific Policy of Italy : Renewal of Freindship between Italy and the Yemen,” in which a reference is made to the extension of the treaty of 1926, between the two countries, for a further period of one year (until November 1937). This is claimed as proof of the friendly disposition of the Fascist State towards Arab countries generally, with whom Italy desires to promote economic relations based on respect for their institutions and for their inviolability. The article alludes to the circulation m the press m some Arab countries of reports that Italy intended to attack the Yemen, and de clares it superfluous to publish further denials of such reports (which it attri butes to ^specified foreign sources), in view of the Duce s pronouncement that Italy will now confine her activities to the peaceful development Ethiopia. 3 I am sending copies of this despatch to Cairo, Addis Ababa and A en.IRmived on 9th January 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 52, dated 24th December 1936.)

He, however, embarked upon a long statement on foreign affairs 4ich, he said, he had been charged to make by His Majesty King Abdul Aziz. He spoke very carefully, hesitating from time to time, as though to recall Ibn Sand’s exact words. The statement, however was so clearly, in its more important parts, only a repetition of many statements made to the Legation during the Ethiopian dispute, that it has been possible to cut down to a page or so the summary which I attach to the present despatch. 2. In reply, I said that Sheikh Yusuf must not expect a detailed answer. I was new to the post, and I had not been warned wdiat he proposed to talk about. (I might have reminded him that when he asked for a meeting I had enquired whether he wished to speak of anything of great importance, so that I might be prepared, and that he had waved this aside.) As to Palestine, I was happy to say that, when I was received by Mr. Eden after my appoint ment, he authorised me to convey to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz his personal thanks for the help offered in connexion with the Palestine dispute. On all other points except one my remarks were purely conventional. The exception was Italy, though even on this point I confined myself to genera lities. I said that it was clearly impossible for me to go beyond statements made to the Saudi Government by Sir Andrew Ryan, acting on instructions from His Majesty’s Government. For myself, I would suggest that the Saudi Government should take a long view and not think only of the Ethiopian question, which had been complicated by the fact that the whole world was trying to find a solution by hitherto untried methods. The Saudi attitude towards the Italian offer of money and arms was presumably prompted by a desire to maintain their independence, an aim which must have the fullest sympathy of His Majesty’s Government. His Majesty would do well to look again at the Rome understanding of 1927. It was not usual to give such assurances as the Saudi Arab Government had wished to receive. What would happen would depend on world affairs, on a host of circumstances. The King had at least one solid fact to go upon—the long experience of His Majes ty s Government to which Sheikh Yusuf had referred with appreciation. I stated that what Sheikh Yusuf had said would be reported to the Foreign Office, and I concluded with suitable thanks for the assurances of friendship, and with similar assurances on our own part. t m = C n to 6 meetin S 7^ ch 1 have described, I have read with great re u 1Ilg J° the attem Pt made by Ibn Sand a few would assist him iY' h 0 ™!/! i' S S *' 0 verriment assurances that they see wliatllmSm, eY^s^ be * hr ® aten ?4 by the Italians.

Bnef Summary of a Statement made by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to His Majesty's Minister on October 5, 1936. u tv with His Majesty’s Government had long been the basis of Ibn baud s foreign policy. He had been in relations with them since the early days of his career and was grateful for their support. In particular, he was grateful for the help they gave him at a moment when the Turks were about to attack him. They asked the Turks to give them a few months’ notice before the beginning of hostilities, so that British subjects and their property might be removed from Nejd, and, in the interval, he was able to come to terms with the Turks. Ibn Saud now saw danger in three quarters : near, farther off, and remote, viz., Italy, Turkey and Germany. (N.B.—Germany was not mentioned again.) The Italians had been the last to recognise Saudi Arabia, and their conduct in regard to Asir and the Yemen had been very suspicious, but at the time of the Ethiopian dispute there had been a complete revolu tion in their policy towards Saudi-Arabia. Italy had recently wished to give Ibn Saud arms and munitions to the value of perhaps £1 million. He had not wanted to accept, but, to avoid giving offence, he had accepted a few aeroplanes. He had informed Sir Andrew Ryan, and had asked whether His Majesty’s Government could give him assurances. He regretted that they had not been able to do more than refer him to the Rome understanding of 1927. The Turks were ancient enemies of the Arabs, and resented the rise to Independence and importance of people whom they regarded as savages. It was fear of the Turks that had impelled him to initiate the[negotiations that had ended with the treaty with Iraq. (Here Sheikh Yusuf Yasin made a brief but very cordial reference to Iraq.) Difficulties with Transjordan arose from time to time (Sheikh Yusuf hinted that these were due to the incurable levity of character of the Amir Abdullah) but Ibn Saud did not want trouble there. He had always been conciliatory, and he trusted that with the help of His Majesty’s Government such difficulties as arose would always be settled satisfactorily. As to Syria, Ibn Saud had made a point of keeping on good terms with the French. In regard to Palestine, Ibn Saud had no other aim than to see peace re-estab lished between two parties, both of whom were his friends. The statement ended with conventional but strong assurances of friend ship. (9) {Received on 30th January 1937 with Political Secretary's Utter No. 2, dated v 14th January 1937.)

The question however calls for examination, and I am studying it. Trade. 4.

With reference to Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch No. 156 (1447/132/14) dated 26th May 1933, regarding the distribution of wireless stations in Saudi Arabia, and to subsequent despatches on the same subject ending with Mr. Calvert’s No. 210 (1734/157/9), dated 22nd July 1933, I have the honour to inform you that according to a report published in the “ Saut al Hejaz ” on November 17th, two new wireless stations which are entirely unaffected by atmospherics have been erected at Riyadh and Abha. The report adds that the Saudi Government are endeavouring to obtain a number of other sets of this type for erection in various places. 2 2. The only other information on this point that I have been able to obtain has been furnished by representative of the firm of Sharqieh Ltd., who state that Messrs. Marconi did not supply these new sets. They also gave a piece of information which was new to the Legation, viz., that a German interested in wireless installation visited Jedda last spring and is believed to have ffisposed of at least one set here—a set mainly designed for reception but able to transmit up to short distances useful for local purposes’.17 A^'^ 0m , the 19 ?? des P atch quoted above it will be seen that whereas Abha had only an old Telefunken set, there was at Riyadh a new Marconi station of six kilowatts. 4.

(H) {Received on 8th February 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 3, dated 21st January 1937.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 18th January 1937. Letter from the Residency, Cairo, to the Right Hon’ble Anthony Eden, No. 1385, dated 18th December 1936. Since my despatch No. 1383 of December 17th was written, I have re ceived your despatch No. 1155 (E 7344/2617/91) enclosing a record of a con versation between the Saudi Minister in London and Mr. Rendel on November 23rd. 2. I have read this report with especial interest seeing that it very much bears out the train of ideas elaborated in my despatch under reference. The information in King Ibn Saud’s possession clearly confirms what we have heard from other independent sources, namely an intensification of Italian intrigue in the Yemen. 3. I have never disguised the extreme gravity with which I view the situa tion that is apparently now developing. At great pains we have been elabo rating with Egypt arrangements for the safeguarding of the Suez Canal as an essential link in our Imperial Communications. I trust I am in error in fearing that those communications risk being blocked by Italy at the other (southern) end of the Red Sea. 4. Viewed from that angle, the present overture of King Ibn Saud through his Minister as recorded in Mr. Rendel s note strikes me as being of the highest potential importance : and I most earnestly trust that it be not lightly turned down or ignored. Ibn Saud, who is a particularly powerful character and the dominant factor in Arab politics to-day, is doubtless acting mainly through motives of self-interest: so indeed are we. But it seems to me clear from what the Saudi Minister said that Ibn Saud fears that the Italians, having gained the domination—if not indeed the annexation of the Yemen will next turn their attention to the neighbouring Hedjaz and other contiguous Saudi territory. Clearly it is one thing to have the Imam as a neighbour: it is quite another to have the Italians. . _ 5 T have long felt convinced that we are approaching the parting o the ways with Itlly, who, having annexed Abyssinia was certain sooner or later— and probably sooner than later—to try and do the same thing or later ana jj j Yemen.

Enclosure 1 to ^4 cIctz 17 Although the now famous Maffey Report found there was little to fear from an occupation of Abyssinia by Italy the view of Europeans Arabs and Somalis in the Red Sea area appears to be that the conflict between Italy and Great Britain is all but certain to break out within the next few years They only differ on the subject of time : when it will become impossi- ble for Great Britain to acquiesce further in their lines of communications to Egypt and the Eastern Mediterranean and their territories in Africa and Arabia being threatened by the Black Army of Italy. In 1935 Italy pre pared for a war against the Abyssinians, they say ; in 1939 or 1940 she will prepare for a war against British territories, possibly when Britain is already engaged in the Far East or in Europe. 18. Points of interest which arose in conversations may be summarised as follows :— (a) Although the King of the Yemen is anti-Italian, he is old, His Prime Minister is strongly pro-Italian and the King’s son is being educated at Asmara by the Italians. (b) A great deal of pro-Italian propaganda is going on in the Yemen and considerable sums of money are being spent by the Italians in this territory. (c) Two Battalions of Yemen troops have been formed as part of the Italian Army of Abyssinia. (d) A number of Somali Battalions are also being formed. Recruits are being paid 300 lira a month. It is reported that this pay is attracting even British Somali seamen: out of 45 told recently to report only 2 came forward. (e) Imports into Abyssinia are being confined to Italian products and manufactures. British goods are being refused entry. The economic position of Italy and her Colonies makes such action necessary. (f) The Italian troops are discontented and the majority are to be repatriated. The future Italian Army in Abyssinia is to con sist of 40,000 Italian and 160,000 black troops. With this Army it is not thought that Italy will find it difficult to sub* jugate the country. Their 4 frightfulness ’ against the black population is likely, as in Libya, to have the desired effect. (g) Grc ^t Britain has ‘lost face’ greatly in the whole native area r j r Rust Africa and Arabia. The people are not interested m what is said, but in what happens, and Italy has seized Abyssinia despite the opposition of Great Britain.it would be a struggle for lines of communication, and that should the de fences of Aden, and the forces stationed there during the recent emergency represent the strength we considered adequate to safeguard our lines of com munication, then there was a great surprise in store ior us. The present state of the defences of Aden—* * * * virtually invite attack. The six 3-inch H. A. guns would have been little if any deterrent, and the air forces, owing to their lack of speed and endurance, could only have been used for night bombing of the nearest objectives. * * * * (13) (Received on 20th February 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 5, dated 4th February 1937.) Enclosure in Eoreign Office covering letter dated 29th January 1937. Letter from the British Legation, Jedda, to the Right Hon’ble An thony Eden, No. 330, dated 29th December 1936. I had the honour to receive your views on Mr. Philby’s entry into the Aden Protectorate, in your telegram No. 135, dated December 5th. I should have preferred to dispose of the matter by another conversation with Fuad Bey, but by then he had left for Riyadh for a stay which might extend to seve ral weeks, and I therefore wrote to the Amir Feysal the letter [S. No. (6)] of which a copy was sent to you under No. 319 on December 8th. The reply of December 21st, which was forwarded in translation under No. 329 of De cember 22nd, was not satisfactory. The Saudi authorities continued to de fend themselves, which was not necessary, as their disclaimer had been accept ed On the other hand they put forward what was obviously a defence sunnlied by Mr. Philby, including the irrelevance about the vagueness ot the frontier and the impertinence about his readiness to show his Bn is i oassport had there been any frontier authorities to show it to. And they assumed as the King of the Yemen assumed when complaining of a similar incursion by Mr. Philby into the Yemen (this was reported fo Coiomal Office in Aden despatch No. 544, dated November 7th) that as a British subject Mr Philby ought to be punished by His Majesty’s Government if he had com mitted any offence against the laws and regulations of the Aden Protectorate Twas about to reply 8 to this letter when Fuad Bey returned to Jedda and I “* BeXT—h.“Std • h,ri in ,h, i - r wt* srsarsi at Shabwa with the bar i info the Hadhramaut for spares : the broke down Mr. Pliilby had hilil g dm ; ss ; on did not cover Shabwa, Aden authorities admitted that; but this ^^flnforming the authorities which no necessity compelled hi Fuad asked with what appeared to beforehand of ^ df re l° , do F°- ““f ^ the HXamant, I suspect be real surprise whether Sha w Fuad was called upon to concoct that what had happened was th&gt;s.

Sanrli rinvornment tha m his See* bTof our Yaking itYearto thTsaudi Government that his action might have brought them under the suspicion of committing a serious diplo- matic impropriety. He had obtained an armed “ escort from the Saudi authorities for the purpose of topographical work m Najran. The results of this work would be interesting to him as an explorer, but they would also be of great use to the Saudi Government, and Mr. Philby was in a way acting as their employee. (Fuad Bey did not object to this statement, but on the contrary nodded assent.) In any case, I went on, the “ escort ” was provided for this specific purpose, but Mr. Philby, carefully concealing his intention both from the Saudi Government and from the British autho rities, used it for a quite different purpose, viz., to enter the Aden Protectorate two hundred miles away. In fact, Mr. Philby had played a nasty trick upon the Saudi authorities and we expected them to make this quite clear to him. 4. Fuad Bey took no exception to anything in my statement, which I said I mu*if follow up with a letter ( a copy of this letter is enclosed) to make the point about Shabwa quite clear. He did not say that any action would be taken, but Ibn Saud will not be pleased at the dust which Mr. Philby has raised at this moment, when he is on his best behaviour towards His Majesty’s Government. If he had an inkling beforehand of what was in Mr. Philby’s mind he cannot have reaslied what it would involve. On the other hand as an oriental he cannot feel called upon to be very harsh with a man who is a British subject and in receipt of a pension from British sources and whom, in his opinion, we could punish ourselves if we wished. More over he cannot fail to be flattered if Mr. Philby tells him, as he doubtless will, that Ibn Saud s name and escort were sufficient to ensure safe entry into a town which it is difficult to enter from the direction of the territory of which the British claim that it forms part. But Ibn Saud has now no doubt about our attitude in regard to the Aden boundary, and he will not lightly let M YT e r? t n f c , ort ” a § ain - 1 felt that the best line to take was that Mr. Philby had abused the confidence placed in him by Ibn Saud This se?ronov^ifv to eVen / P Trh t0 Philb y himself ’ w bo y seems to have a sense ol loyalty towards Ibn Saud such as he does not feel towards His that W ° ,,!d inV0lve an admissfon tha tew m me wrong, and Mr. Philby is never in the wrong. which Mr W1 phiIb y fa may givY '’f foreYeettheY-iY ^ e P ort an y ex P la n ation Prometheus brine™ ™ T&lt; T ese e that he will dramatise himself as a with His Majesty’s GOTernment in tt™ 0 t 0S ft knowl f d g e from Shabwa the vulture with no other business in' lif f w ZeUS ’i and H ’ M ' Minist er as suffering liver, already deeply pitted from ^ Mr ’ .

Letter erom Foreign Oeeice, London, to Sir Miles Lampson, Cairo, No. 81, dated 25th January 1937. I have read with interest Your Excellency’s Secret despatch No. 1385 (820/4/36) of the 18th December [S. No. (11)], regarding the question of Italian activities in the Yemen. I am fully alive to the most disquieting features of the situation discussed in your despatch and the question of the policy of His Majesty’s Government in this matter is forming the subject of consi deration in the Middle East Official Sub-Committee of the Committee of Im perial Defence. 2. In the meantime, while I do not wish to minimise the dangers of the position, there are certain considerations which suggest that the Itahan Gov ernment may not be so firmly determined on a policy of intensive penetration in the Yemen as has sometimes been suggested. I shall welcome an early expression of your views on the following considerations. 3. In the first place, as you are aware, the Italian Government have vir tually* undertaken in the Rome understanding with His Majesty’s Govern ment of 1927 not to establish themselves at any point on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. I realise that it would be unwise to place too much reliance on such an undertaking on the part of the Italian Government but it should be noted that it is accompanied by a corresponding virtual undertaking on the part of His Majesty’s Government that they also will not establish them selves on any point of the Arabian coast of the Red Sea; and that the Italian Government have in the past shown that they attach great importance to this undertaking to which they have frequently appealed. The view has more than once been expressed that one of the many motives inspiring Itahan policy to-day is a fear that His Majesty’s Government may themselves be aim ing at some extension of their territorial or political influence m Arabia. Such a fear is unfounded, but to the Italian mind it may appear to possess some reality, and it cannot, therefore, be entirely exchided m considering Ita- Uan policy in this area. The Italians no doubt realise that if they were to violate the Rome understanding of 1927 they would thereby Government from any obligation under that understanding. . i ^ v enable His Majesty’s Government to occupy any area they desired in the V emen 55(C) ExAffairsDeptcm nr the hinterland in the neighbourhood such as, for example, Sheikh Said or *h ^ British control nf the Aden Protectorate frontier ne ^ Maje3t , y s Govern- 3t be welcomed). with King Ibn Saud ment in entering into closer . in all d officers of the Italian i.

Personal letter trom Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mecca, hated 21st Decembeb 1936. With reference to Your Excellency’s personal of December 8th, 1936, I have the honour to inform you that I am gi ad _ learn that the British Government were pleased with the assurance given y the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the (nature of the) de parture from Najran by Mr. Philby. The information given to y°u by the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs explains the attitude of the Dovern ment of H. M. the King on this question. It has been a cause of regret to the Government of H. M. the King that the matter should have left any consequences (literally. tJ j* is ' and that an importance which it does not in fact possess_ should oe attributed to it. Your Excellency may be assured that, in remote, deserts it is very difficult to distinguish the actual frontiers if they are not fixed and known, just as it is difficult to comply with the special arrangements concerning the crossing of the frontiers particularly when there are no special officials for such purpose. Moreover, as the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs has already explained to you, the Government of H. M. .the King had no knowledge of the intention of Mr. Philby to go to the Hadhramaut. It was therefore impossible for the necessary application to be made for per mission for him to go there. I have moreover learnt that when Mr. Philby was asked by the responsible authorities in the Hadhramaut why he had gone there in such manner he replied that he held a British passport and that he was prepared to produce it to the frontier officials had there been any. I have also learnt that Mr. Philby has explained to the responsible authorities in the Hadhramaut the reasons for his going there and that he was not entrusted with any mission by the Government of H. M. the King and that he only went into the Hadhramaut because he had to get his cars repaired and to obtain some articles which he needed. It appears that they were satisfied with bis explanations and afforded him the required assistance. Had it not been so, it would have been their concern, and within their power to take the measures they thought proper against him.23 In any case I think the importance attached to the journey of Mr. Philby and the impression it caused or might have caused have been much exaggera ted especially if we take into consideration the fact that his journey was not made by order of the Government nor with their permission. As to the armed persons said to have accompanied Mr. Philby, they were merely such guides, guards and servants as escort every one who travels in the desert to protect and assist the traveller and to supply him with his requirements. Consequently I hope that the explanation which I have given will serve to remove suspicion (literally “ what has come into the minds ”) and to assure of the good intentions of the Government of H. M. the King. ( 16 ) {Received on 13th March 1937 with Political Secretary's letter No. 8 , dated 25th February 1937.) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 22nd February 1937.

Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 16th February 1937. Letter from Foreign Office, London, to Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, No. E. 7835/2617/91, dated 15th February 1937. With reference to Conclusion (e) of the 48th meeting of the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, held on the 14th December 1936, by which the Colonial Office and the Foreign Office are invited to pursue the question of British Consular representation in the Yemen, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to state that, as the result of a eareful examination of this proposal in the Foreign Office, a number of serious objections have become apparent. 2. In the first place, were the King of the Yemen to admit British Consular representation he would not be able to refuse the same treatment to the Italian Government. It seems more than probable that the result would be a race in which each Government would strive to outstrip the other in the size and influence of its Consular establishments, and that His Majesty’s Government would either have to meet the expense involved in maintaining a more im posing establishment than the Italian Government or stand by and see the Italian Government acquire precisely that position which it is desired to pre vent them from acquiring. 3. But in any case the recent refusal of the Imam as reported by His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad in his despatch No. 616 of the 31st December last (a copy of which was sent to you in the Foreign Office letter E-362/34/93 of the 4th February), to consent to the establishment of an Iraqi Diplomatic Mission either at Hodeida or Sanaa suggests that it is most unlikely that he would agree to the establishment in his country of British Consular offices. Even if he were to give his consent, it would probably be long before a Consul, on whose doings a fierce light would from the start be directed, could live down the suspicion with which he would be regarded and evolve an alternative system of intelligence and reporting of equal efficiency to that by means of which the Residency at Aden at present obtains information regarding events in the Yemen. 4 In the second place the establishment of Consular representation in the Yemen presents difficulties from an administrative point of view, since the climate and living conditions are such that special conditions of service 5&amp;(G) ExAffairsDept,26 would be necessary whUe the fact that ^'ThVsatXtfry 0 peXlte ^nt^StTut^SX 0 oSVould have to carry out if the post were to have any vaiue at an ergons Lord Halifax considers that it would in preset dr^Sanfes, be preferable not to pursue the suggestion further and would be glad to learn whether Mr. Ormsby Gore is m agreement with this view. . 6.

Letter FRom Foreign Office, London, to the Right Hon’ble Sir Eric Drummond, Rome, No. 182, dated 24th February 1937. The Counsellor of the Italian Embassy called here on the 3rd February in order to discuss Anglo-Italian relations in the Red Sea area. He said that the Italian Government had been rendered uneasy at the recent journeys of Captain Seager (the British frontier officer on the Aden-Yemeni frontier) from Aden to Sana’a, and of Mr. Philby to the Hadhramaut. Signor Crolla seemed rather confused about these journeys and at times spoke of Mr. Philby’s journeys to the coast of the Persian Gulf where, as was explained to him Mr. Philby had not been for many years. But it appeared that the reference to these journeys was merely intended to introduce the subject, and that the real object of his visit was to say that Italy relied entirely on and held firmly to the Rome understanding of 1927, and to express the hope that His Majesty’s Government themselves were prepared to continue equally to base themselves on that instrument. -iv/r • ^ r0 ^ a was told in reply that it must be self-evident that His Majesty s Government could have no ambitions in the Arabian peninsula and and no wish to increase their responsibilities by adopting any kind of forward pohey beyond the areas already under their sovereignty or protection Their £’ s «o Government must know, was the maintenance of the Captain Seafer was, irXTalLn^OTCTnX^were^ware^he'B^t^h'f 116 ' 1 ’ no rej»e£itetives in^he^mmi^but the^fact that th^h^d 8 b over ninmit with that country naturally led to the necessitv fo^ ^ a Common f rontier - questions of common interest In fit a a ^ or ^cussing various frontier natural that Captain Seager should go to seemed entirel y ordinary course of his work as a fronfiAr Am n&amp; ^ fr0m time to time ’ in tlie with the Yemeni officials.

It was no doubt unnecessary to attach excessive importance to such remarks, but this kind of talk had unquestionably created a great deal of uneasiness in certain quarters. 5. Signor Crolla said that any such uneasiness was entirely unjustified Italy had her hands more than full in Abyssinia, and the last thing she wanted was an Arabian adventure. In any ease, her policy was to adhere firmly to the undertakings of the Rome understanding of 1927, and he wished to give a formal and categorical assurance to this effect. The Italian Government for their part had, he repeated, certainly felt some uneasiness at Captain Seager’s journey. There had been reports to the effect that he had discussed with the Imam the possible cession or lease of certain points on the Red Sea Coast. These rumours, though they were unconfirmed, had given rise to much sus picion as to the attitude of His Majesty’s Government. Signor Crolla was told that these stories were entirely ridiculous. It was just as much to the interest of His Majesty’s Government as to that of Italy to adhere strictly to the undertakings contained in the Rome understanding. The last thing which His Majesty’s Government could have contemplated was to have attempted, in violation of those undertakings, to obtain any cession or lease of This sort from the Imam, even if there had been any prospect of the Imam considering such suggestions. In any case, Signor Crolla could regard what was being said to him as a formal assurance that nothing of the sort had ever been contemplated, and that such action would be entirely contrary to the basic principles of the policy of His Majesty’s Government in Arabia, which were the strict maintenance of the independence and integrity of the two Arabian States, that is to say of Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. Signor Crolla, after expressing appreciation of this assurance, said that he felt that the detente in Anglo-Italian relations ought to be extended to the middle East as well, and that he would like to see the Rome understanding of 1927 developed. He was given no encouragement to pursue this line, but he went on to explain that the Italian Government attached importance to the observance of the provisions in the Rome understanding for Anglo-Italian consultation. 6.

Letter from Minister, Jedda, to Foreign Office, No. 27, dated 22nd March 1937. Jedda, February 28,1937, In accordance with, the instructions conveyed in the last paragraph of your telegram No. 135, dated the 5th December, regarding Mr. Philby’s expedition into the Aden Protectorate, X had the honour to send you, in my telegram No. 9 of the 22nd February, an outline of Mr. Philby’s attitude. I now transmit a full summary of statements which he made to me in the course of a conversation on the 18th February. The collapse of his motor transport and, later, heavy floods delayed his return so long that he had only a few hours in Jedda before leaving for Mecca for the pilgrimage, but during that short time he called at the Legation and he talked freely about his journey. 2. As I anticipated, Mr. Philby was in his most heroic prometheus mood. Indeed, he was even more difficult than I had expected, for to his desire to bring the light of science to mankind is now added a quite ferocious intention to expose the alleged duplicity of His Majesty’s Government towards the Arabs of the peninsula. He asserts that the second part of this programme was added only under the provocation which he considers he received from the Aden authorities. I did not enter upon a discussion of the pledges given or alleged to have been given in respect of Arab independence. I had never studied the McMahon correspondence closely from the point of view of the Arabian peninsula, and, in any case, it would be unwise to treat Mr. Philby as the protagonist of the Arab claims. Moreover, I had in hand the less ne bulous argument that Shabwa lay outside the extreme limits ever claimed by the Saudi Government. Mr. Philby’s attitude towards that fact is shown in paragraph 6 of the enclosed record. He professes to demand independence for the Arabs in the Arabian peninsula without regard to the Saudi demands, of which he, however, claimed to be fully aware. He informed me that he had on his maps the two proposed frontiers in the south, the British and the gaudi In that case, he was aware before he set out for Shabwa that it lay beyond the limits claimed by the Saudi Government. • ^ r ' Philby is unable to see that he treated Ibn Saud badly in obtain- f ° r ^°P£F a P hlcal work and exploration in Saudi Arabia and As to thp n Ai?° Wn t0 enter te][T itory outside Saudi Arabia, on territorv win 0^ltl ? s, ke regards their claim to Shabwa as a trespass of Arab inderuwl WaS . aka nd°ned by His Majesty’s Government in favour pondence His MaW?

Mr. Philby’s claim that fm was on all fours with that of Mr p 1 J 0 P ok rical point of view his expedition that Mr. Thomas was at the time bVlh''' T J loma s is unfounded.

Mr. Philbv would nrr.hnlj 1 fi°™ His Majesty’s no authority to agree to the blue line which took no ^ sa y that the Turks had the hands of IbnSaud, but hedc^’fr hmr defe , at at mitted that His Majesty’s Government saved him from bei ng crushTby 7 the' Yusnf V a . dn ; ls T slon was made in the message transmitted through Sheikh But in Y WhlC m 1 m “i? des P atch 283, dated the 11th October But in any case, Mr. Philby could not be expected to forgo an opportunitv to use Mr. Thomas as a stick with which to beat His Majelty’s Government! 5. The statements recorded in paragraph 5 of the enclosure left little doubt in my mind that Mr. Philby did enter the territory of the King of the Yemen, and since he cannot accuse the King of encroaching on Arab territory he will have to find another excuse for the encroachment which the KiW nghtly resented. But he will probably think the purity of his intention! sumcient excuse. 6. Mr. Philby does not seem to have entered the band of territory lying between the proposed British and Saudi hues, but he may have gathered some information about it. In recent discussions with Fuad Bey I have claimed it for Aden and Oman on the ground that the four wells in it which are shown on our maps, viz., Sanau and Thamut in the Hadhramaut hinterland and Shisur and Tadhau in the hinterland of Oman, are not on Fuad Bey’s list of Murra wells, have never been claimed by the Saudi Government by name, and, ac cording to the information in Thomas’s Arabia Felix, lie to the south of the Rub-al-Khali and in the steppe country which rises from the rim of the desert to the crests of the coastal range and are frequented almost exclusively by tribes to whom Ibn Saud lays no claim. It is unlikely that Mr. Philby has collected any better information on this point than Bertram Thomas, who passed through the territory in question and halted at Shisur, but he may make it more difficult for Ibn Saud to renounce his claim by representing the tribes thereabouts as entirely beyond the control of the authorities in the coastal States, but ready and willing to submit to Ibn Saud. Ibn Saud is so much more a statesman than Mr. Philby that I am hopeful that nothing Mr. Philby can say will influence him in this matter, the more so as, having repudiated responsibility for the expedition, he can hardly quote the results to his own advantage. I am more anxious lest the appearance of the promised attack on His Majesty’s Government in Mr. Philby’s next book should drag the question of the smaller Arab States in the Arabian peninsula into the vortex of controversy about the McMahon correspondence. 7. I do not propose to engage in a dispute on pan-Arab politics with Mr. Philby, nor to continue the discussion about his visit to Shabwa. The views of His Majesty’s Government have been conveyed to the Saudi Govern ment, and Mr. Philby has also been informed of those views, and the matter had better, I suggest, be left there. 8. I am sending copies of this despatch and its enclosure to Aden, Cairo Jerusalem, Bagdad and Bushire. Enclosure to letter No. 27, dated the 22nd March 1937. Summary of Statements made by Mr. Philby about his Expedition to Shabwa and beyond, in the course of a Conversation which he had with His Majesty s Minister on February 18, 1937. It was quite true that Ibn Saud had nothing to do with the expedition beyond instructing all local officials to assist him. Mr. Philby had defrayed all the expenses himself (and they had turned out to be much heavier an he had expected), though he had financed himself by drawing on Saudi trea- suries, where they existed, and refunding the advances through his firm 55(C) ExAffairsDept.30 , . x p ^ imirnev was purely scientific, and lie had, in in Jedda.

Hi? 1 ^ it right in claiming that, apart from the w e dwmaut ht'journey“y m unexplored, undemarcated territory. To daini Shabwa and those parts for the Aden Protectorate was fantastic, for no nrotection was afforded. Nor could the Aden authorities claim the virtue of Cving the people thereabouts to manage their own affairs for they bombed Vh»m The Aden attitude towards Shabwa was exactly like that of the Italians towards Walwal at the beginning of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, and British policy was no more honest than that of Italy had been. The British were trying to expand at the expense of the Arabs. 4 His policy remained what it had always been, viz., to try to obtain for the Arabs what they were promised early in the Great War. He had chal lenged His Majesty’s Government to publish the promises made then (the McMahon correspondence), but with their habitual cowardice they had re fused There were plenty of copies in Arabic to be had, but the English correspondence ought to be published. He would tell His Majesty’s Minister a “ secret he used to possess copies of the correspondence m English, given to him by T. E. Lawrence, but they were stolen from him by a clerk of his in Jedda. 5. He was interested to hear (for the first time) that the King of the Yemen had protested to Ibn gaud, alleging that the expedition had entered Yemen territory at Jauf and Marib. He wondered how the King had heard about it. In point of fact, he had not gone to Marib, but had taken photo graphs and bearings from a height from which it was visible. (Mr. Philby evaded, or at least did not answer, the question whether the height in question was in Yemen territory.) 6. No, it was not quite correct to say that he was asking for more for Ibn Sand than Ibn Saud was asking for himself, though it was near the truth. What he wanted was the establishment of the promised Arab independence in the Arab Peninsula and the elimination of any foreign rule which conflicted with the promises. Mr. Philby claimed to know all about the British and Saudi proposals for the southern frontier of Saudi Arabia and to have the two lines marked on maps in bis possession. When His Majesty’s Minister said that in that case he must have known that Shabwa lay well to the south of the proposed Saudi line, he said that the position of Shabwa on the map was a long way out, but he did not deny that Shabwa was even farther to the south than the map shows, and therefore at a greater distance from the extreme limits claimed, by Ibn Saud than appeared from the map.Letter from the British Embassy, Cairo, to the Eight Hon’ble Anthony Eden, No. 420, dated the 2nd April 1937. I have read with much interest the record, contained in your desnatch No. 182 (E. 784/27/91) of February 24th [S. No. (19)] to Rome, of a discussion at the Foreign Office with the Counsellor of the Italian Embassy on Feb ruary 3rd regarding Anglo-Italian relations in the Red Sea area. 2. I note that according to paragraph 5 of that despatch Signor Crolla was informed that the basic principle of the policy of His Majesty’s Govern ment in Arabia was the strict maintenance of the independence and integrity of Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. I have assumed that what was intended was the maintenance of the independence and integrity of these states as against a European power and that the statement made to Signor Crolla was in fact nothing more than a confirmation of Clause 3 of the Rome Under standing of 1927. I raise the point merely for the purpose of elucidation since the sentence in question is capable of the meaning that His Majesty’s Government are prepared to maintain the independence and integrity of the two Arab states in question as against each other—an attitude which would involve a departure from the principle underlying Clause 3 of the Rome Understanding. 3. I am sending a copy of this espatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda. Enclosure 1 to S. No. (22).

I have the honour to submit a few remarks on the financial situation of bn Saud and its effect upon policy. r _ a 2.

The committee m charge of tms p32 eone so far as to publish in the Saut-al-Hejaz newspaper an appeal to Moslems written in 1U spelt English, and to advertise forrnlgnms to take home as “ A Present from Medina . Other objects tor which subs- oriptions are invited are the sacred well of Zamzam the Wazmya water scheme for Jedda, the First Aid Society, the Charitable Society, the Asylum for Orphans and the Aged, and so on. The pilgrim guides are required to press these schemes upon the attention of their pilgrims, and for the Aviation Society the guides are under moral compulsion to buy books of 1 nyal tickets proportioned to the number and supposed wealth of their pilgrims, and are left to pass them on to the pilgrims if they can or to bear the loss themselves. Pilgrims have been subjected to pressure on behalf of these various schemes, but no complaints have been received from British pilgrims. . It is accepted that a pilgrim should distribute what he can in charity while he is in the Hejaz, and if there were no societies appealing for his money, it might go to individual beneficiaries or be extorted under various pretexts by the guides, 3. It is easy to deride the thirst for money which underlies these appeals, and the latest Jedda report contrasts the requests for charity with Ibn Baud’s alleged expenditure of over £600 for walnuts and pistachio nuts for his last hunting trip. But it is impossible not to feel some sympathy for him. His personal expenditure is doubtless wasteful in some ways, and it seems hard on a poor country to have to support a royal family, which includes twenty- five princes and a corresponding number of princesses and queens, but there is no reason to think that any economy that would be compatible with the King’s position and oriental methods of accountancy would make a great difference to the budget. 4. The word “ budget ” is only used by convention, for it is porbable tha the Saudi budget exists largely in the head of the able Nejdi, who is Ibn Saud’ Minister of Finance. Income is irregular and incalculable, and expenditur spasmodic. If the King wants money suddenly for some purpose the Ministe of Finance must produce it somehow, and there are demands from the Amir Sand and Faisal also to be met, and the simplest way to meet essential expen diture is to leave for some future time the payment for services rendered o goods supplied. All Saudi officials, except those who are in position to loo! after themselves, are permanently in arrears with their pay for periods ex ending at times to half a year. Many foreign chauffeurs, employed for th State cars, have been glad to recover, before leaving, a third or a quarte oi arrears of pay extending back sometimes for two or three years.

It is true that the prospectors have not been at work long, and it must also be remembered that an American company found oil at Bahrein where the Shell Company had given up the search, but the reports from the com pany’s experienced geologists, who seem to have covered most of the ground, have left the Jedda manager very gloomy. Two other possible sources of wealth can be foreseen at present: that oil will be found in the Rub’-al- Khali, and that somewhere in such parts of Arabia as are not included in the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate’s concession gold or some other valuable mineral will be found in quantities and in conditions that will repay the work ing. There can be little in the commercial schemes which are discussed in the Mecca press from time to time. It is not by selling to pilgrims small boxes of Medina dates that the Saudi budget will be made to meet at the back, nor by curing rather less badly the few skins the country has to export. Several grandiose schemes, which in succession raised Saudi hopes, have come to nothing. The chief of these were the Jedda-Mecca Railway, the Saudi State Bank, which the ex-Khedive was supposed to be prepared to establish, and the loan of half a million or so which the Saudi Government hoped they could raise in England on rather vague security. 6 For the present, then, the Saudi Government are living on the pil- grimage revenues supplemented by windfalls, such as advances m respect of the various concessions, the purchase by the Italian Government of an unknown number of camels at absurdly high prices, and consignments of arms petrol, &amp;c., for which they have never paid. Thus, windfalls apart, Saudi Arabia is dependent upon a source of revenue on which noteven the Heiaz alone had to Uve before the war, for there seems to be no doubt that the Ottoman Government put into the Hejaz, in the way o subsidies and m over- s ss&amp;s&amp;sz Tto fluctuations of *' i'lil In 1»27 ,0 you. rhe total »'”™““ f f ' f “, to T h.

Running down the coast are various insignificant people whose only purpose in life seems to be to bar Ib n Saud from the sea, from any oil that may be discovered there, and from any pickings that might be got out of Imperial Airways. Finally, there is Bahrein, which used to belong to Ibn Saud’s ancestors but now stands more or less on its own feet, and which, moreover, has an oil well gushing away as if i n mockery of the miserable seepings in the wells which have been bored in Rasa And in all these territories His Majesty’s Government have “interests’*’ which prevent their being absorbed, as much to their own as to the general advantage, in Saudi Arabia. Such is the picture which Ibn Saud may be expected to paint to himself. 8. In these circumstances it is reasonable to suppose that although Ibn Saud seems to have decided that on the whole His Majesty’s Government are to be preferred to the Italians as freinds, the recognition of our interests in Arabia puts a great strain upon a monarch who is not only ambitious but probably insolvent too. It might be argued that the poorer Ibn Saud is the less likely he is to engage in a policy of adventure, but my own opinion is that on the whole a more generous view is justified, viz., that anything that in creases his legitimate revenue is to be welcomed by His Majesty’s Govern' ment, and any expenditure that might embarrass his finances is to be depre' cated. To increase his revenue is not in our power, for without giving pil grims money, as the Italians have done this year for propaganda purposes' we can hardly do more to facilitate the accomplishment of the pilgrimage bv British pilgrims than is done already. We can, however, apply the second principle to any scheme which comes up for consideration.

At our request the third dinner was cancelled, but it was re placed by a tea-party, which was attended by the King. The nersonnl character of the party was, however, emphasised by the presence of Mrs Rendel. The King made a very rare exception to his rule not to receive Kuropean ladies, and had her placed in the seat of honour on his right. 4. Not only did we endeavour to avoid some of the external sions of an official visit, but Mr. Rendel was carfeful to explain, both at the beginning of his visit to Jedda and also jnst before his departure, that his journey was personal and private. It was undertaken, he explained, in response to the generous invitation of His Highness the Amir Saud. Nevertheless, he had taken the opportunity to study carefully on the spot various matters affect ing Anglo-Saudi relations, in particular the Qatar boundary, and he would be glad if he could assist in arriving at a settlement of this or of any other outstanding question. 5. At my urgent request Mr. Rendel took the leading part whenever there was a question of explaining the point of view of His Majesty’s Govern ment on matters of importance. This was not only reasonable in that he was merely going again over ground covered on many occasions with the Saudi representative in London, but there was the even more cogent reason that Ibn Saud would certainly expect to hear the views of an official of the Foreign Office who, to his knowledge, had dealt with Saudi affairs for many years. I venture to believe that Mr. Rendel’s visit and the conversations to which it gave rise have been of the greatest value, and will have helped to launch my personal relations with His Majesty under the happiest auspices. Cer tainly nothing could have been more cordial, friendly and familiar than the King’s words and manner, which never changed, however delicate the point under discussion, and it was interesting to learn from my new Italian col league, with our interviews fresh in my mind, that he had found the King extremely guarded, and concluded that he was an extremely clever fellow, who would never commit himself. 6. I am fully conscious of the danger that excessive cordiality at the beginning of an acquaintance may lead to disappointment later on. As I informed the Foreign Office in personal letters soon after my arrival, I found that the King regarded me, on the strength of quite normal official letters written by me to King Hussein in 1923-25 and discovered in the Shereefian archives after the fall of Jedda, as a partisan of Ibn Saud s, and I regretted this assumption, since the oriental builds far too much upon personalities and the King might expect to gain impossible favours from His Majesty s Government through my efforts and might afterwards be more dissatisfied at failure than if he had never entertained any hope of success. Similarly there is the danger that he may build too much upon Mr. Rendel s visit, and may hope to influence His Majesty’s Government in mattes where it is not possible for them to make concessions or grant favours. Rut it is sufficientOA • ■ ,1 on the whole I am sure that the cordial eonver- to keep this danger in mind. 0“ * sions have been o very gr Rendel’s visit were these:— ^ 7 The subiects discussed during m TTT rr (1) With Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba (а) Qatar frontier.

Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 30th April 1937. Letter from Minister, Jedda, to Foreign Office, No. 41, dated the 12th April 1937, Jedda, March 23, 1937. In my despatch No. 40, dated the 23rd March, I reported that during Mr. Renders short stay in Jedda, from the 17th to 22nd March, we had several interviews with His Majesty King Abdul Aziz. I now have the honour to enclose a summary of these conversations. The conversations themselves and unavoidable hospitality occupied most of the time during the last two and half days, so that there was not time to make a complete record before Mr. Rendel’s departure. 2. It might have been more satisfactory to divide the record up into portions according to the various subjects discussed, and to send each portion separately with a covering despatch, but there is not time to do this before the bag goes, and in any case the subjects overlap a good deal. Where com ment seems to be called for I hope to send it by the following bag, and the question of Palestine, at any rate, requires a telegram. 3. In two or three places I have inserted material which may appear to be remote from present-day politics, e.g., references to Ibn Saud’s relations with the Sherif (later King) Hussein and to his dealings with British officials in the Persian Gulf before the war. I think these references are relevant as showing that the mind of the King is always rovinu back to the times when, as he thinks, he deserved well of His Majesty’s Government and reflecting that he has got ^ , 1 am not sa ying, at the moment, that any bitterness that i bn Saud feels on this score is justified but only that it exists.

Between the return of Fuad Bev towards the end of November and his hurried and surprising denarture on leave a few days before Mr. Rendel was due to arrive, I have had occasional interviews—sometimes at tiresomely long intervals—with Fuad Bey, whom there is reason to think that the King does not entirely trust, and who I tbink has misled me on one or two occasions. 5. I may mention that during the course of the conversations reported in t?- e 0S1 o 6 ^ w i ce sa id that he hoped I would pay him a visit at Kiyadh. For many reasons such a visit is not to be undertaken lightly, but it may be useful to have the invitation in hand if matters of importance have to be dealt with and no satisfaction can be obtained here during the long interval between two successive annual visits of the King to Jedda, the only place in Saudi Arabia where a foreign representative is allowed to reside. 6.

Becord of conversations in the course of interviews granted by His Majesty King Abdul Aziz to Sir Reader Bullard and Mr. Rendel on March 20, 21 and 22, 1937. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba were present throughout, and the Amir Feisal appeared on two occasions. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba and Sir Reader Bullard interpreted. First Interview, March 20. The King began by laying down the pirnciples which governed his life : {1) his religion, (2) his determination to keep his name above reproach, and (3) devotion to his religion and to the interests of his subjects. He was a self-made man, having started with nothing in the world, and provided that he stuck to his principles he was prepared to go back to nothing. Times were changing, the pristine honesty of the world was declining, but he would never pursue a crooked path. He believed in consulting everyone, but no one could lead him by the nose. He would always speak to His Majesty’s Government frankly and sincerely. All sorts of stories were afloat about his subservience to the Italians, but he could assure His Majesty’s Government that they were nonsense. Mr. Rendel said how much the King s frankness was appreciated by members of the Government in Great Britain, and Sir Reader Bullard said that he was sure that the King was never suspected by His Majesty’s Government of subservience to Italy, and that His Majesty s Government knew that his policy was directed to what was their object as well as his, viz., the maintenance of the independence of Saudi Arabia. 2. Ibn Saud said that he was a Moslem first of all, but he believed that o all the European Powers the one with whom it was to the advantage oi the Arabs everywhere to be on good terms was Great Britain. After some talk on these lines Sir Reader Bullard took the opportunity to convey the thanks of His Majesty’s Government for the advice which the King had given to the Mufti of Jerusalem when the mufti appealed for his help recently (Foreign Office telegram No. 12 of the 1st March). The King expressed pleasure at mark of annreciation of his efforts and repeated what he had said to the 'he\ad X S Td Z 0 to co-operate with the British in — and to await the result of the Royal Commission), and he said that h- had 65(C) ExAffaireDeptwjt!;'- wv;- W^H*':''';. r«w:- O Q i . . be made an instrument for Italian also warned the mufti no o e wa nted the whole “ bundle of Arab intrigues.

If they were free they would the King gave ns a copy), t&gt; ppk an d Ahmad, and the Imam too if he revolt and sweep away both Kaghib ana Anmau, opposed this popular movement. . , , ... 4 To this enuuirv from Sayyid Husain, Ibn Sand said he had repUed that, as for himself, hJproposed to observe Yd‘withdrawn 0^6“^ hi and non-intervention in Yemen affairs. He had withdrawn once wiiemhe might have occupied the Yemen, and he did not propose to reverse that policy. If there should be trouble in the Yemen, the most he could do would be to consult other Arab countries if asked by both sides to try to make peace, and to see what could be done to give effect to the request. As to Great Britain and Italy, Ibn Saud had told Husain about the Home understanding of 1927, and had said that both the British and the Italians had assured him. that it was their firm desire that the independence of the Yemen should be maintained. In conclusion, Ibn Saud declared vehemently that there must be an outbreak in the Yemen—perhaps before the death of the Imam. In that event, what would the Italians do and what would be the attitude ot His Majesty’s Government ? 5. Mr. Rendel replied that His Majesty’s Government fully appreciated the dangers of the situation in the Yemen. There was no doubt that the Italians had been, and still are, intriguing actively in that country and would be very ready to fish in the waters they had helped to trouble. But while the internal situation was perhaps more dangerous than it had been, he was inclined, for the following reasons and speaking purely personally, to doubt whether the Italian danger was now quite as acute as it had been a year ago.. In the Rome understanding of 1927 His Majesty’s Government had made it quite clear, and the Italians had formally recognised, that His Majesty’s Government regarded it as “ a vital imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea. ” {At this point Sir Reader Bullard gave King Ibn Saud, for convenience of reference, a copy of an Arabic translation of the relevent text, w T hich had already been com municated to His Majesty by Sir Andrew Ray an.) There was, of course, no reason to trust any Italian promises as such, but if was obvious that, in T- iew of the terms of the Rome understanding, any attempt by Italy to estab lish herself in the T emen would be a direct challenge to His Majesty’s Gov ernment. No doubt Italian hot heads, possibly Italian local officials, cherish- e esigns on the Y emen. But Italian policy ’would be directed from Rome, and present mdicatons suggested that for European reasons, and in view of ^R 1S ?r- re ^ I ^ ai ^ e ? t ’ was not now anxious to embark on any conflict .• 18 jhi es y Government, but was rather seeking to establish better Thn Wl E Tu lf thlS Vi ? w should P rove mistaken, he did not think King p!'T lb f rl0 ' al y disturbed by ItaUan activities in the Yemen, alv develn™S In Were closel y Parallel, and it was difficult to see how threaten British inTereL ^ COuld fail Ibn Sand wrmiri • ' StS ’ 80 t ^ t ^ le P r °P a Pffity was that, m any such event, ibn baud would, m any case, find Great Britain at his side. At a later finterview the opportunity was taken to mention that the --Italians themselves seemed anxious to keep the Rome understanding alive, and apparently feared a forward policy on the part of His Majesty’s Government (see Foreign Office despatch to Jedda, No. 182 of the 24th February). 6. Mr. Rendel added that he understood (from Sheikh Hafiz Wahba) that His Majesty wished to know the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards his suggestion for an exchange of information about the Yemen, &amp;c. Mr. Rendel saw no reason why this should not be possible. His Majesty’s Government would be glad to pass on to Ibn Saud any information of interest which they could properly communicate to him, though in doing this they would, of course, be assuming that Ibn Saud was satisfied that there would be no risk of leakage at the Saudi end. 7. Ibn Saud then turned to Iraq. He had good information, for people wrote to him from all parts of the Arab world and he had seen many Iraqi pilgrims, and the reports all tallied with each other. Everyone was suspicious of the new Iraqi Government and regarded it as not Arab. There had been much to be said against Yasin-al-Hashimi, who had even gone so far as to ask Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to tell Ibn Saud to beware of the British Govern ment, but at least his policy was an Arab policy. To the policy of the present Iraqi Government there were two objections : it was communistic, and it was under Turkish influence. The Turks had begun by trying to get possession of the Sanjak of Alexandretta, and their next aim would be to ac quire Mosul. 8. Mr. Rendel said that the title of Communist was sometimes misapplied to any one who favoured economic social reform. He understood that such reforms were long overdue in Iraq, where there was much extreme poverty, and it was possible that Hikmet Suleiman’s legislation was necessary, and was not imposed in any spirit of communism. . It might be well, therefore, to reserve judgment on this point until the Amir Saud and Sheikh Hafiz W ahba should have seen the situation for themselves during their impending visit to Bagdad. (Here Ibn Saud said that Hikmet Suleiman did not care a rap for the poor or for anyone.) As to Turkish influence, Mr. Rendel believed that, while the maker of the military coup d'Etat, Bakr Sidqi, and some of his military associates, might be described as pro-Turkish, Hikmet Suleiman showed signs of wanting to shake himself free of military influence, and the longer he could maintain his Government, the more hope there was that he would become less dependent on the army’s support. As to the attitude ot the Turkish Government, a year ago Mr. Rendel would have scouted the sug- themselves 'much 'isolated atGeneva and had'retreated from the extreme position 1they had taken up. The fact that the Turks had recenred so marked a check over Alexandretta ought, he felt, to make them much less likely to put forward any other similar claims in future. Second Interview, March 21. 9. Ibn Saud said that he wanted to make some remarks under four heads :— (1) His relations with His Majesty’s Government. (2) The Arabs in General. (3) Palestine. (4) The future. The interview went on for Sonstith^ifMajest/s Governmen^fronithe^moment when he first ' ' them through the Politica Agent at Bahrein and suggested ^ interests demanded that the T ' rk ® , reoeiv ed an assurance that His selves strongly in the Arabian Penmsu , « approach him either by St , £S'h“tt W0 H. d ^ s.««40 , ! u.r xxn+li which he had offered to help the Sherif the war, recalled the Royalty with ^ ^ the « g uar antees ” which he had Nothing whatever had come of these the war, recalled the Aoy ^ Tooke of the “ guarantees ” which he had Hussein against the Turk , Nothing whatever had come of these received froin Sir P( f c y i.o^’been promised “ all sorts of things. ” He “ guarantee,,’ though n His Maj e st y’s Government by communicating had assisted the Arao J hi h he re ceived from the Turks as an to them the written and oral otiers wnix^ Hussein _ offers which he refused&gt; inducement to him to ] ^ a „ g a inst the British because they were his alleging that he could t g cage ^ he could not join ^ neighbours on the Gull, ana saving . ^ d Hig Ma j t , Turks w hen they were slaughtering ^ ^ ^ Government that h thig^offer. He told Hussein that the resources in money and arms which were supplied by the British were being wasted through being dealt out to the various sheikhs according to the number of followers tlmy said they had, and asked that if he sent his son and some men to he P they should only be given arms for themselves and food to eat and Hussein had replied that Ibn Saud must be either mad or drunk. Ibn Sand thereupon informed the British Government that he must lay down two con- ditions P ; that he would not recognise Hussein as King of the Arabs, though he did not object to his being King of the Hejaz, and that when the war was over His Majesty’s Government should allow him to settle his own scores with Hussein. He had always Ustened to the advice of His Majesty s Government even to his own hurt. On more than one occasion he had fallen out with his chief supporters, the Ikhwan, for that reason, e.g., when he retook Turaba which the Sherifians had unjustly occupied, and His Majesty’s Government asked him not to go any further ; when he refrained at the request cf His Majesty’s Government from taking Aqaba, where the ex-King Hussein was staying, and Maan ; and when he listened to the mediation of the British agent at Jedda and ensured the peaceful occupation of the city to the disappoint ment of some of his followers. For all this loyal support, and after all the promises made to him, what had he got ? Nothing whatever. On the contrary ! 10. He would put his complaints under three heads :— (a) His Majesty’s Government had not given him the help he needed. (b) Their boundary policy was always squeezing him in. (c) By their Gulf policy they tried to make him dependent commercially on Koweit and Bahrein. Whereas a friend in need of help looked to a more powerful friend to assist him, he had had no help from His Majesty’s Government. Look what His Majesty’s Government had done for Egypt and Iraq ! Those countries might be richer than Saudi Arabia, but Saudi Arabia could, in his opinion, be more useful than either to His Majesty’s Government. ex P ress i n g great interest in the valuable historical survey which the King had given, but pointing out that what we had to adopt as a ,)asis was the facts of to-day, Mr. Rendel suggested that one difficulty was that, W ^^ c( l untl J ies like Egypt and Iraq, which contained rich natural resources, could be developed by commercial enterprises which would earn their own kj?

Nevertheless, if His Majesty would make specific suggestions, they would be examined most carefully and sympathetically. nr l 2 ' ,' as a § ain referred to at a later meeting the same day. Mr. Rendel repeated his warning about the peculiar difficulties created by the pre-occupation of His Majesty s Government with their scheme of rearmament and spoke of the necessity for co-ordination of skilled men with suitable machines if time and money spent on training and equipment were not to be wasted, and of the possibility that Saudi Arabia, having a very small urban population among which to find men with a suitable preliminary trainin 0, in mechanical work, &amp;c., might find it more difficult than, e.g., Egypt, to pro duce suitable candidates for aviation work. Sir Reader Bullard suggested that, whereas it might suit the Italians to undertake the training of any number of Saudis because of the political effect it might be expected to have, His Majesty’s Government would be reluctant to embark on any scheme that would not have a reasonable chance of success. He also asked .the King what His Majesty thought would be the effect upon the Italians of any close rela tionship between His Majesty’s Government and Saudi Arabia in matters of aviation. Was there any reason to think that this might encourage them to seek to extend their influence elsewhere, e.g., in the Yemen ? It was true that the Italians had themseVes wished to identify themselves closely with Saudi Arabia in aviation affairs, but how far was that merely a phase of the war with Ethiopia and their hostility to His Majesty’s Government on that point ? The King said that the Italians still wished to be allowed to develop Saudi aviation, and implied that he didn’t care what they thought. He added bitterly that the pilots trained in Italy were no good. At one point in the conversation the King said that if Iraq shook itself free of Turkish influence he would not mind having some Iraqis to help in aviation later on. 13. It was arranged that Sheikh Yusuf Yasin should prepare for His Majesty’s Minister a note of the Saudi requirements in aviation matters. This note, Ibn Sand was assured, would receive the most careful attention. Third Interview, March 21. 14. The King said that he wanted to speak about his future in relation to His Majesty’s Government. He began with a long and rather pointless account of the negotiations for the Saudi-Iraq Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. In so far as it has a point it was intended to show the Iraqis as rather slippery customers. At Riyadh, said the King, Naji-al-Asil suggested to Ibn Saud that Iraq should deal with His Majesty’s Government in the matter of Palestine on behalf of Ibn Saud, and that Ibn Saud should deal with the Imam about his adhesion to the Saudi-Iraq Treaty. Ibn Saud had expressed surprise at this request, and had said that both States must act too-ether in both matters. He spoke of what appeared to be a similar attempt to side-track him in the matter of securing the adhesion of the Imam to the^treaty. He then spoke of the surprise he had felt at the Iraqis wanting to insert in^the treaty a reference to the League of Nations, of which Saudi Arabia was not a member, and added that the Imam would never consent to anXng in which there was a reference to the League Mr. Rendel S Afnh that members of the League could not assume any obligation which the part of Iraq. of d the League , and that consequently neither Saudi Arabia nohhe Yemen would be affected by such a reservation on the ^The King then said that he had often been asked ^ether *he Arab states of the Persian Gulf could not adhere to the Saudi-Iiaq ireaty 6o-CJ ExAfEahsPeptf • r 'W r ' ™ if f * * llpainff +.]io unimportance of such States, hut had fended off such enquiries, au&lt;^ 6 of H . g Ma j esty &gt; s Government.

Mr. Rendel repeated 16. This subject led to th q sbeikh Yusuf Yasin on the 19th March, the argumente wfoch he used had made great concessions in this saying that His Majesty b ^ hoi dins firmly to his original demand.

It was 'hat he had recognised the treaties between the coastal rulers and His Maiestv’s Government in the Hadda Agreement, O but on the question of the boundaries there was a limit beyond which he could not go. The boundary of Qatar was well known to be Araik, winch was m the nufud. 17 The maps which were at hand were examined, but Araik was not marked on them. 1 Sir Reader Bullard said that he had seen a map on which, unless his memory was at fault, Araik was shown to the south of Jabal aksh. In that case there would no longer be any disagreement on that point. 18. As to Khor-el-Odied, Ibn Saud said that, in claiming it for Saud Arabia, he was thinking of the interests of His Majesty’s Government as much as of his own, for no one but himself could keep order there. W hen crimes were committed there it was to him that the people applieo ior redress. 19. The King seemed very anxious to pass on to another subject. It appeared at first that he was wanting to evade the boundary question, hut when the other subject came to be broached it was found to be a question of capital importance. What, the King asked, would happen to him in the case of war ? Suppose war began in Europe, or in the Yemen or anywhere t Could not His Majesty’s Government make some treaty or some other lesser undertaking with him ? It could be secret if they wished. 20. Mr. Rendel said that any such undertaking, and more especially any kind of secret guarantee, was precluded by the British constitutional system, which would in any case make its eventual fulfilment uncertain. Sir R. Bullard added that His Majesty’s Government were obliged, as members of the League of Nations, to register all treaties with the League. Mr. Rendel then went on to say, as he had said the previous day, that he could hardly imagine any occasion on which a threat to Saudi Arabia would not be a threat to His Majesty’s Government, and added that this community of interests was a stronger bond than many a treaty. We had given too many promises in the past, under pressure of war in particular, and could not give one in this case. Sir Reader Bullard reminded the King once more of the terms of the Rome Agreement of 1927. His Majesty’s Government had recorded in writing that they regarded it as a “ vital imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Bed ea . ie King seemed to derive comfort from this conversation. Fourth Interview, March 22 . 21. The King said that in this the last conversation before Mr. Rendel s departure he wished to speak about Palestine. The Arabs we re now really ( T ) This reference should be to Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda.43 alarmed by the Zionist policy. They feared that a Jewish Government would be established in Palestine and would include Transjordan in its scope, and they were even beginning to fear that there might be designs on Medina itself, the burial-place of the Prophet Mahomed. Some of these fears might be exaggerated, and due to irresponsible talk by individual Jews, but there was also genuine ground for apprehension, and he himself was very anxious about the question. Great Britain was powerful and could crush the Arab opposi tion, but he feared that there might be dangerous repercussions in other Moslem countries in which His Majesty’s Government had special interests, e.g., Egypt, Iraq and India. There were many enemies watching for an opportunity to injure Great Britain. The chief of these was, of course, Italy. The attempt that Italy was making to win recognition as the friend of Moslems in general and of the Arabs in particular was well known. The Italians had used the pilgrimage for propaganda purposes, and had done their best to induce him to speak in praise of their pro-Moslem policy. He had resisted this attempt, and he had no belief whatever in Italian professions, for he knew what had happened in Tripoli and in Abyssinia, but there was a real danger from the Italians, nevertheless, if the troubles in Palestine should flare up again. Nor were the Turks inactive. They had many agents in Palestine, who never failed to rub it into the Arabs that the result of their revolt against the Turks was subordination to the Jews. The Zionist policy, as it was being carried out at present, was contrary to British interests, and that was one reason why he was against it. As a Moslem and an Arab he naturally sympathised with the Arabs of Palestine. He had suppressed these personal feelings hitherto out of friendship for His Majesty’s Govern ment, and he could always suppress his feelings if policy required it. But the Zionist policy was not even in the interests of Great Britain. Moreover, His Majesty’s Government must realise that he stood alone, and that he had to think of his position in a Moslem world where he was the butt of much criticism, and where many of his co-religionists would not even admit that he was a Moslem. He felt that he had come to the end of what he could do in the matter of Palestime. 22. His Majesty was assured that his views would be communicated to His Majesty’s Government without delay. 23. Ibn Saud said that he had one last question. Suppose that there was trouble in the Yemen and the Italians asked him about it, as they might very well do ; what should he say ? Should he reply to this effect /i:.i fn interfere in the internal affairs of the Yemen, vention. Mr. Eendel said that this reply seemed to meet the circumstances exactly ( 26 ) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 30th April 1937.

Summary of the Contents of an Open Letter addressed to the Imam Yahya and signed “ The Loyal Tongue of the Nation ”. The Imam’s rule has been partly good and partly bad, but his piety has caused and still causes, his people to overlook the bad things and to be loyal to him’and to his house. However, times are changing and men with them, so he would be well advised to listen to franlky uttered counsels. He wishes his son Ahmad to succeed him. Such a succession would be disastrous, for Ahmad is incapable of governing ; in such an event the people would be dissatisfied, and, on the death of the Imam Yahya, they would rise in armed revolt. The agreements entered into with England and Italy, with a view to strengthening Ahmad’s position, would prove valueless. The writer then advises the Imam as follows :— (1) To consult the Amirs, Ministers and officials as to the man they consider a suitable successor to the Imamate. It does not follow, of course, that they will speak their minds freely. (2) To proclaim A1 Husain as his successor and initiate him, in the Imam’s lifetime, into the work of government with the assist ance of a council of notables. Among the members of such a council should be two Moslem leaders or upright men from Syria, Egypt or Iraq. This would be welcome to the people who consider A1 Husain an honest and pious man, and would mean the frustration of foreign designs. (3) To persuade Ahmad to surrender his rights for the common weal and recompense him by giving him the Amirate of Hejah, with the revenues thereof, on condition that he takes his orders from ; the capital, (4) To promote unity among his sons and send some of them to Egypt to be educated at A1 Azhar or some other institution, under the supervision of tutors appointed by him and by the Egyptian Government.

In the inter view I had in haste with your Excellency at your house just before noon on Tuesday the 10th Muharram (22nd March, 1937), I explained to you that 1 did not believe that His Majesty the King, in his conversation to which you referred meant A1 Ureyq but Dukhan. There was a slip of the tongue. After I left vour Excellency I enquired of His Majesty concerning the actual fact, and His Majesty stated that he did not intend that place, which is south o Naksh but the one which is south of Dukhan, which makes Naksh within the Saudi ’ Arab Kingdom.

Italy owing to her conquest of Aby. ssinia, occupied a more important position m the Red Sea area and her interest were more deeply engaged and more widely extended there than they had been before. All that occurred in Arabia was thus of importance to her, and she had become, so to speak, much more “ sensitive ” in this area than in past The Italian Government had therefore been disturbed by certain recent developments which suggested that His Majesty’s Government might be adopting a more forward policy. 2. Signor Crolla began by alluding to the recent arrival at Jedda of two British aircraft, apparently to bring documents to Sir R. Bullard, and to Sir R. Bullard’s immediately subsequent departure for Riyadh to interview Ibn Saud. He had a long complicated story about reports current in Jedda as to the objects of this visit, which had made the Italian Government very un easy. Ajiparently realising that this was hardly a sufficient ground for the uneasiness which he had been instructed to express to me, he went on to say- alleging, however, that he did so entirely on his own initiative—that he had read in the “ Daily Herald ” about a month ago that we were extending our authority and influence north of the Hadhramaut, apparently with a view to establishing ourselves in the hinterland behind the Yemen. His explanations were confused and confusing, but he seemed anxious to suggest that His Majesty’s Government were now adopting a much more forward policy in Arabia, and that Italy, in view of her increased interest in East Africa, could not remain unaffected or indifferent. ' 3. I began by telling Signor Crolla that it seemed to me increasingly difficult to deal with these constant unjustified suspicions on the part of the Italian Government, in view of the background of hostility and supicion which was being created by the perpetual attacks launched against every- mng we did by the Italian press. Hardly a day passed when I did not read in my telegrams of some new and utterly unjustified misrepresentation or our policy and motives in Italian newspapers. This was not my immediate concern, ut it made it much more difficult to clear up local questions such as nglo-itahan relations in Arabia and the Middle East, when one knew that ft ° r ? d would be distorted and used against us in Rome, ne espair of ever getting anything properly straightened out. firmlv to tlip to 'R ldS J \ r T ab j a '’ b c °old tell him at once categorically that we held tached arcft^ Y nd erstanding of 1927 [F. 427 (11) N/26] and that we at- down fifth it TTiff a f ntc , to integral maintenance.

We had meticulously observed our own part of this Understanding, even to the extent of holding aloof in cases where we might have obtained a dominant position for ourselves in matters connected with Saudi Arabia. X hoped that the Italian Government would be equally scrupulous in keeping to their part of the Understanding, but I felt bound to say that the words and actions of certain Italians had done much to lend colour to the doubts which were felt in certain quarters here as to the ultimate intentions of Italy in regard to the Yemen. Our own policy was, however, perfectly clear and simple. We desired to see the independent Arab States remain independent and strong. We had no desire whatever to extend our influence beyond those limited spheres in Arabia in which we were legally entitled to exercise it, and any rumours to the contrary were merely malicious inventions. 5. As regards the particular cases to which Signor Crolla had alluded* I could tell him quite frankly what had been the object of Sir R. Bullard’s journey. As Signor Crolla knew, we were faced with an extremely difficult problem in Palestine resulting from our conflicting obligations. The Royal Commission had now produced a Report and recomendations, which might well arouse strong feelings on both sides. We had felt it essential to ensure that the Commission’s Report and recommendations should be clearly under stood by the leading personalities in the Arab world, and that there should be no risk of unnecessary misunderstanding owing to incomplete or inaccurate information. We had therefore decided to send Sir R. Bullard to Riyadh to explain the Report and recommendations of the Commission and the con clusions of His Majesty’s Government thereon frankly and accurately to King Ibn Saud the day before those documents were published in this country. This had involved Sir R. Bullard reaching Riyadh with the Report and con clusions of His Majesty’s Government not later than July 6th, and, seeing that the Report had not been in our hands until the evening of June 22nd, it had not been physically possible to arrange this without sending the necessary documents to him by air. I had myself been responsible for the proposal, to send the two aircraft to Jedda, and had only hit upon this way of sending the papers to Sir R. Bullard after I had found that all the other methods of com munication would have been too slow. It was quite possible that Sir B. Bullard might take the opportunity of his visit to Riyadh to discuss any other outstanding matters with the King, hut the object of his 3 ourne y wa ' ly simple and straightforward, and it was absurd to read deep ulterior pol cal motives into it, or to represent it as implying any change of policy on our part. , a As regards what Signor Crolla had said about our adopting a forward policy hf the Wnterland 0/the Hadhramaot and extending our authonty round to the back of the Yemen, this was equally off the rails. There had Wn no ouestion whatever of our extending our authority m this area.

They were for the time being more or less m abeyance, and as for as we ourselves were concerned, the area which was of most im- nortance to us was the coastal belt. But, however this might be the fact remained that legally the whole area to the east and south -east of the blue and violet lines fell within our sphere of influence, and was internationally under Tr protection with the exception of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman which was an independent State. Our actions in this area therefore could not possibly be regarded as involving any new policy or any departure Irom the spirit of the Rome Agreement. 8. I told Signor Crolla that I had given him this full and frank expla nation, as I wished to clear up any risk of misunderstanding and to try to convince him that our policy had not changed, and that we still held firmly to the principle of the Rome Understanding that no European Power should establish itself in independent Arabian territory. But I felt bound to add that the Rome Understanding really seemed hardly applicable to this area, since that Understading specifically referred to the Red Sea and to the Arabian Red Sea coast. The areas under our protection to the south-east and east of the violet and blue lines, which had nothing whatever to do with the Red Sea, therefore hardly seemed to come into the picture. 9. Signor Crolla replied that the Italian Government felt that the Rome Understanding of 1927 ought not to be applied in too narrow or local a spirit. In their view, it was important that there should he a clear understanding about British and Italian interests to cover the whole of Arabia and the Middle East. I asked Signor Crolla whether he meant by this—as he had at one moment seemed to imply—that the Italian Government wanted the Rome Understanding extended or amplified. I was unable to get a definite reply from him to this question, but he continued to say that it ought to be interpreted in the widest possible spirit. 10. Signor Crolla was not- easy to follow, as he wrapped his ideas up in complicated language with a mass of allusions and implications, from which he showed great agility in retreating whenever I tried to hold him down on any particular point. My first impression was that he was trying to re- presen )a we had violated the Rome Understanding and that Italy might therefore regard herself as free to adopt a forward policy. He did indeed ° n ®. “°“ lent hmt at something of the kind. When he reahsed, however, how strong our case was for saying that we had serupuioulsy observed the51 Rome Understanding ourselves, he rather changed his ground and began somewhat petulantly, to insist on how unjustified our suspicions were of Italian designs on the Yemen j he had assured me over and over again, and particularly on February 3rd, in the most categorical terms that Italy’ had no intention whatever of adopting a forward policy in the Yemen or of violat ing the Rome Understanding. It seemed to him that, if it was a question of unjustified suspicions, our suspicions of Italy were more unjustified and seemed harder to allay than the suspicions which the Italians had entertained against us. I did not pursue this subject further, beyond making it clear that the Italians themselves had done much to shake our own confidence in them. The interview was, however, entirely friendly. 11. At more than one stage in the discussion I made it quite clear that His Majesty’s Government still attached very serious importance indeed to the principle enshrined in the Rome Understanding that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. But in the absence of a final decision of the question whether some public state ment should be made on this point— a question which is still under consi deration—I avoided making any new statement about it which could commit us further than we are committed already.

Persico and the King. I do not think i necessary to send you a full record of my conversation with Sheikh Yusuf ut I may supplement my telegram by mentioning three points of some importance which I omitted from it, as follows (a) My Italian colleague, according to Sheikh Yusuf, began his statement to the King by thanking him for having observed neutrality m the Italo-Abyssinian war and for not having taken part m sanctions. The King replied that he had adopted his attitude for the sake of friendship with all con cerned. (&amp;) M, Persico stressed the friendly dispositions of his Government towards the Arab nations and their readiness to give any required assurances in this respect. (c) At the end of the private conversation, in which the sheikh en gaged me after he had carried cut his instructions to inform me of what had passed at Ashaira, he threw out a question regarding reports that His Majesty’s Government might with draw from the League of Nations and regarding the conse quences of such a step, if it were taken. 2. I did not comment on (a) or (b) above. As regards (c), I took the general line that I knew of no pronouncement by any responsible person which could lend support to the reports in question; that many people, it was true, thought that the League should be reorganised to make it more useful; but that, whatever happened (and no one could foresee what would happen), it would astonish me greatly, if Great Britain abandoned or des paired of the League. 1 adduced various considerations in support of my opinion, making it clear, of course, that I was only expressing my private views as between two friends, in accordance with Sheikh Yusuf’s request. 3. Mr. Philby, who was at Ashaira during M. Persico’s visit, spent the evening at my house on the 13th May. His account of the audience, based on what he had heard from his friends, and possibly from the King himself, was generally similar to that given me by Sheikh Yusuf, though not so complete and more loosely put together. Fie was even more outspoken than the sheikh about the perturbation caused in the King’s mind by the outcome of the Italo-Abyssinian war. The reason for the King’s reaction was, he said, his concern for British prestige. I could not get him to say definitely why the maintenance of that prestige should interest the King so greatly, but the implications of his language were clearly these: Keliance on Great Britain was the corner-stone of Ibn Saud’s policy. Great Britain had failed to oppose a successful resistance to Italy m the case of Abyssinia and had in fact, let that country down. How, then could the King have confidence in the will or ability of His Majesty s Government to resist Italian ambitions in the Red Sea? Like Sheikh Yusuf Mr P hll by s poke mrticularlv of the Y r emen, saying that, when referring to the intended negotiations between Italy and the Yemen, my Italian colleague had spoken of a 'strengthening” of the relations between the two countries. 4 Mr Philby is as you are aware, not in the innermost secrets of Ibn SautL and his language is very apt to be coloured ^ ^l^MaVTaUhfuUy Nevertheless, I think that what he told me o^^ represents Ibn Saud s present outloo_ ompre i 1 ension of them, much less 889(8) F&lt;kPD Ju.35 i in Abyssinia, and has seen in bv moral force.

July the sound of gun-fire ( I gathered) had been heard at Jubail though it was not very distmc • days later a similar sound was heard about half an hour before sunset, u this time it was very much nearer. Tbn Saud had instructed him, Sheykh Yusuf said, to enquire whether there was any special reason for the gunfire, as for example were smugglers being pursued. In answer to my query, he said that there was no sugges tion that Saudi territorial waters had been entered. He merely asked whe ther there as a reason for the firing and added that the Amir of Jubail was a new man in the post. I promised that I would make enquiries, and said that from my knowledge of sloops in the Red Sea it might possibly be soifie form of gunnery or firing practice.

I have the honour to refer to Colonial Office Secret despatch of July 2nd, 1936 [Enclo. to S. No. (52)], regarding the possibly increasing danger of Italy embarking on some new adventure in the Yemen and connected matter. 2 .. I shall endeavour to have a closer watch kept on the situation in South-West Arabia and I shall communicate with you by telegram should I see any signs of increasing Italian activities. I have instructed Captain Seager, the Frontier Officer, to make a special study of this subject when he next visits the Yemen and in this connection I should like to draw you atten tion to certain points which have occurred to me wliich are relevant to the subject under reference. 3. Our present information tends to show that any Italian activities in the Yemen, which may have underhand motives, are of a nature designed tu avoid detection even to the closest observer as it is well-known that the pre sent ruling monarch would deal harshly and summarily with any foreigners or foreign organisations whose activities were aimed at undermining his authority to the detriment of his State and the future inviolability of his Kingdom. There is reason, therefore, to believe that Italian methods and practices in the Yemen, to which His Majesty’s Government might take ex ception in certain circumstances, are confined to subterrajiean and secret channels which amount in effect to a form of ‘peaceful’ penetration and in filtration brought about, as far as one can judge, by extensive bribery of the ughest officials. There is, of course, an ostentatiousJand superficial side to eir activities and this Captain Seager will no doubt report upon in due course. He is now drafting a memorandum on Italian activities in the emen which is based on the somewhat meagre information at present in our possession. This I hope to be able to forward to you shortly, together with a military report on Yemeni war resources. v “h way to discover secret Italian activities in ^ Wel1 take such root as to present a startling fait accompli m a few years time or following the present Kind’s death-is to man y y eais &gt; proved himself to be worthy of trust.

He reported to the Amil of Taif that he had been summoned at Assab (on the day of the full moon) by the Governor of Assab. Others present were other Nakhodas, Yemeni merchants and labourers. The Governor made the following statement: — “Please inform your Amils (local Governors) that the Italian Gov ernment now exercise sovereignty (sic) over all Yemeni ports from Sheikh Said to Jeizan.” The Italian Governor apparently wanted the news to spread quickly as he asked his listeners to convey the information “abroad 55 as soon as pos sible. Informant who seems to be genuine adds :— “We all know that it is Italian propaganda and that the statement is only given to frighten the Yemeni Government and to annoy the British Government, but we know that the Italian Gov ernment is bribing all Yemeni officials from high Ministers down to Amils the same way as they did with the local Chiefs in Abyssinia. 55 Forwarded wiThout comments.

The W^ir was most eager to hear news of events in Abyssinia and wished paiticularly to know if it was true that the British Legation Guard had been withdrawn from Addis Ababa. Apparently there had been a persistent rumour in the Yemen to this effect. He showed a great interest in and knowledge of the general poli tical situation in Europe, and was keen to know in what form the League of Nations—of which thp Yemeni have no great opinion—could be made more effective.

The road of which mention is made in the despatch under reference, was completed in June and is reported to be a very serviceable affair for most season of the year over most of its length. A useful report on the major part of the road was drawn up by a member of the Legation shortly before the work was completed. Otherwise, the main interest m regard to the Mahd-adh-Dhahab centres round the problem of water._ For some time drilling for water has been in progress and hap been in the hands of American drillers, using American drilling machines. Progress has been slow and little or no water has been found. More recently, the Jedda manager of the syndicate relates, the London office, becoming impatient at the apparent lack of success, despatched two British drillers to this country, with British drilling machinery. The latter had just arrived when Mr. Dunckley spoke on the subject, but the two drillers had been here a week or two longer and had already considerably improved on the efforts of the Americans. Water, however, is still to seek, and the matter is apparently a serious one, for, in the words of Mr. Dunckley : “No water, no mine.” The syndicate, he added, were prepared to drill to a depth of 2,000 feet, whereas at the moment they have not gone deeper than 100 feet., 5. I observe from Mr. Rendel’s letter of the 7th May last to Sir Andrew Ryan that a concern named the Mining Trust (Limited) now holds a controlling interest in the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited), and assume that, since the flotation of the syndicate, the component interests concerned (as given in the enclosure to Foreign Office printed despatch No. 313 of the 14th August, 1934) have changed somewhat. In this connexion, I was recently struck by a statement made by the Jedda manager of the syndicate that the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate was owned by the American Smelting Company, “lock, stock and barrel.” 6^. In Jedda work on the terminal compound has progressed very considerably, but the various premises are not yet at a stage when they can ; )e occupied by the staff. No signs of work on a jetty are apparent, but a landing ground for the syndicate’s aeroplane has been established in the immediate vicinity of the compound. Mr. K. S.

I understand that Mr. Laycock will be arriving in Jedda towards the end of May and he would be grateful for any assistance that you could properly give him. (69) L.ETTER FROM THE PETROLEUM DEPARTMENT (MlNES DEPARTMENT), DEAN Stanley Street, Millbank, London, S. W. 1, to the Colonial Office, No. P. D. -236/16, dated the 18th July, 1936. Reverting to my letter of the 6th May and your reply of the 29th May, No. 78026/36, about the attitude to be adopted to the proposal of Petroleum Concessions Limited to apply for an oil concession in the Yemen, I think you will be interested to see the attached copy of an official letter from the Admiralty to the Foreign Office, which probably you have not seen, regard ing a similar attempt which has been made “by the Company to obtain an oil concession from the Saudi Arabian Government over the Western coastal areas in the Red Sea. You will see that the Admiralty attach importance to preventing Italian interests from entering into competition for this concession. I should explain that at a comparatively late stage in the negotiations the Italian Minister at Jedda intervened to request the Saudi Arabian Govern ment to defer the grant of a concession until Italian interests had had time to come forward. In this connection the Saudi Minister of Finance enquired about the standing of Petroleum Concessions Limited, vis-a-vis H. M. Government, and was informed by H. M. Representative that H. M. Government fully support the Company. We have just heard that the Company have secured the concession. I think the above has a rather important bearing on the question of the line to be adopted in regard to the Company’s project m the Yemen. When the Italians find they have failed in Saudi Arabia it is possible they may try elsewhere in this neighbourhood and I would be glad it you cou consider again the possibility of doing something in the Yemen to SU PP/^^ the only substantial British interest which is available. In view ot tne terms of your letter of the 13th May to Reilly he wj! hardly feel that ought to go out of his way to help. What I suggest is that Re^Uy might now be told that we are anxious to see Petroleum Concessions Limited g the concession they are seeking ancT ask him to consider whe y S can be done to assist. I am sending copy of this letter to Rendel. 889{S) F&amp;PD47 'atimttiatty to the Foreign Office, No. M.-03230/36, LettE r from the Admiralty^ th ^ ^ im • i„ ttpr No E.-3797/1283/25 of the 25th With reference to your printed^^^^^^ H ^ Eepresenta _ June, and subsequent te ^ P g di Arabian Red Sea Oil Concession, I tive at Jedda, COIlcerI11 T ^ d Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint am commanded by My Lord 8 Conmi mo ^ for Fore n Afiairs! tiat E; ?,'2■“&gt;“ “''•••“'• 8 “ competition for this concession.

Letter from the Colonial Office to the Foreign Office, No. 78026/ 36, DATED the 22nd August 1936. I understand that you received a copy of Starling’s letter to me of the 18th July on the subject of the application of Petroleum Concessions Limited for an oil concession in the Yemen. There are obvious difficulties in affording any active support to the company; and before I discuss the matter with Reilly I should be glad to know what line you woulcf like us to take. 3 Letter from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office, No. (E.-4590/| 260/91), dated the 28th August 1936. Will you please refer to Starling’s letter No. 236/16 of 18th July, to you and connected correspondence about the attitude to be adopted to the proposal of Petroleum Concessions Limited to apply for an oil concession in the Yemen. 2. We have been recently reconsidering the attitude to be adopted towards Petroleum Concessions Limited in their quest for oil concessions in the Red Sea area in the light of growing evidence of Italian designs and aims in that region. As a result we are wondering whether as regards the Yemen our attitude towards Petroleum Concessions Limited may not perhaps have been hitherto a little too rigid, particularly as when they were seeking a concession in Saudi Arabia we went so far as to assure the Saudi Arabian Government that His Majesty’s Government fully supported them. We cannot of course identify ourselves with any parti cular company to the prejudice of other British or quasi-British concerns or press the Imam to grant a concession to any particular company. Nor can we well take part in the actual negotiations for the concession. Further more, the absence of direct diplomatic representation in the Yemen makes it difficult to extend to the Company the ordinary facilities which we should extend, in a normal country, to a British Company which had our confidence. At the same time there may well be ways and means by which the Resident at Aden could indirectly facilitate the company’s task; and it is clearly in the interests of His Majesty’s Government that Petroleum Concessions Limited which, although an international concern, is nominally a British Company with an important British element, should obtain any concession which the Government of the Yemen may be willing to grant, rather than that such a concession should go to the Italians. Moreover we are inclined to doubt whether the appointment of Major Holmes as the Company s mouthpiece in the Yemen should be allowed to affect the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the Company s activities for it must be remembered that he is being given every facility bv ne Persian Gulf Authorities in his search for concessions in Bahrain and on the Trucial Coast. P48 “SA&amp;5W ES« -p . , „ ' Reilly that His Majesty s Government would like to see Petroleum Concessions Limited get the concession in preference to anv Italian concern and that within the limitations described above he should erefore facilitate the company s task in any way he properly can It could of course be pointed out to Sir B. Reilly that it would not be proper tor mm to take any direct part in the negotiations or to urge the grant of a concession to the Company. 4. Since this letter was drafted I have received your letter No. 78026/ 36 of 22nd August to Rendel (who is on leave) asking for our views on this subject, which I think are clearly set forth above. 5. I am sending a copy of this letter to Starling. Letter from Petroleum Concessions Limitep, City-Gate House; Pinabury Square, London, E. C.-2, to the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies, Colonial Office, Whitehall, S. W.-l, No. P. C.-41/92, dated the 3rd September 1936. In continuation of our letter of March ,23rd, 1936, upon which your letter No. 78026/36, dated April 23rd, furnished certain comments, we have now to report that, as suggested in our letter, Major Holmes has addressed His Majesty the Imam, offering his services in the direction of exploring the oil resources of the Yemen, and asking for an audience. He received a reply from the Imam about a month ago, a translation of which is passed to you herewith. Major Holmes has, owing to preoccupations in the Persian Gulf, not been able to visit Aden as he had hoped'. His letter to the Imam was, however, communicated through the Chief Commissioner. The Company has not, at the moment, developed any further plans for approaching the Government of the Yemen, but should it do so we will communicate them to you in due course. Translation cf a letter from the Imam of the Yemen to Major Holmes, dated the 2nd Day of Rabi al Thani, 1355. In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful; to his Honour, the respected Major Holmes.

In an interview published in the “Journal de Tdheran ot 21st August, Seyed Muhammed Zubara, after smtabiy flatte g ^ to the progress of Iran and to the personality of the fWhistori- Valiahad, by both of whom he has received, went on to refer to s^ cal friendship between Iran and the Yemen. He said that he P ^ this friendship would shortly be further strengthened by e Yemeni Princes, possibly of sons of the Imam, and that he thoug T n that Yemen student would soon be sent to study ah the University o v He added that this extension of relations^ between . tne and Iran necessitated the creation of a Yemeni Diplomatic Missi Tehran and the appointment of an Iranian representative to Sanaa. 3. Whether Seyed Muhammed Zubara’s statements are of an Y ance remains to be seen. In any case, Monsieur Motamedy, now j the Near Eastern Department of the Ministry of Poreign Affairs, re .. . j informed a member of my staff that the present visit was of no po ^ importance, and this is borne out by the fact that, though a ^ inI ^fg a ^ rS) given to the distinguished visitor by the Ministry of Poreign ’ Monsieur Motamedy, who was on holiday within easy reach 0 'L J , e ec [y did not, bother to return to the capital to attend it. Monsieur Mo a s thought that Seved Muharamed Zubara’s visit was largelv t° be exp by the fact that he was a Shiah, and he has in fact now left Tehran to a pilgrimage to Meshed.4. According to the 'Journal de Teheran”, Seyed Muhammad Zubara will return to his country by way of Iraq, Syria and Egypt. 5.

C.) called on me yesterday morning for a general talk about his recent negotia tions with the Saudi Government. Beyond giving me a good deal of the local background— e.g., the friendly reception he had received at Taif, the agreeableness of the climate of Taif, the general manner in which the negotiations were conducted, some sidelights on the personalities con cerned, and rather a gruesome account of M. Biraud’s last illness—Major Longrigg did not tell me much that we did not already know. 2. He produced the attached sketch map of the concession, but agreed that it did not go much further than the text, since in the north and south the concession is bounded by the northern* and southern frontiers of Saudi Arabia, while inland it is bounded generally by a line running 100 miles from the coast; but the precise method of interpreting that definition or drawing the line has been left over for subsequent discussion if and when oil is found in the neighbourhood of the boundary. The sketch map throws no light on this point. 3. Major Longrigg, said that the Company intended to do its best to develop the concession, since the payments to the Saudi Government were steeply graded, and it would not pay the Company merely to put the concession into cold storage. He agreed that oil experts were often un reliable and mistaken, but he thought that there was a distinct probability of oil being found, particularly in the southern area. The Saudis had apparently been anxious that the Company should take on the Wadi Sirhan as well, but the Company had come to the conclusion that the prospects of oil were too remote in that area to justify them in extending the concession to include it. Up to Mudawara.. t me more favourably than I had 4 , seemf afo thft he speaks Arabic fluently and carried on hi s expected. It seems a language.

Your letter of the 7th September (E.-5523/2617/91), on the subject of Italian designs on the Yemen. You have no doubt by now seen our despatch No. 950 (203/1/36) of the 29th August [S. No. (81)] on this subject. There is really not a great deal which we can add to the information contained in that despatch. At various times since the conclusion of the Italo-Yemenite Treaty in 1926, there have been rumours that Italy was casting an acquisitive eye on the Yemen, but at the same time and up till last year, the Italian authorities showed a desire to allay these suspicions as far as possible. We ought not, however, to forget the speech which Signor Mussolini made to the Quinquennial Fascist Assembly in 1934. In this speech, to which we drew your special attention in our despatch No. 950, and which formed the subject of the Embassy’s despatch No. 245 (189/2/34) of the 19th March, 1934, he said that “Italy’s historical objectives have two names: Asia and Africa. South and east are the cardinal points which should stimulate the interest and determination of Italians. Northwards there is little or nothing to be done; nor is there more to be done westwards, neither in Europe nor beyond the ocean. These objectives of ours have their justification in geography and in history. Of all the great western Powers of Europe the nearest to Africa and to Asia is Italy. A few hours by sea, fewer still by air, suffice to join Italy to Africa and Asia. Let no one misunderstand the scope of this secular task which I assign to this and future Italian generations. It is not a matter of territorial con quests, and let this be understood by all near and far alike, but of a natural expansion which should lead to coliaboration between Italy and the peoples of Africa, between Italy and the nations of the Near and Middle East. As an assurance of peaceful intentions Signor Mussolini’s declaration has of course proved valueless in the event, but it is perhaps of some interest as an open indication, if one were needed, of Italian aspirations in the Near and Middle East. There can be no real doubt that Italy desires to increase her influence in that part of the world and there is every reason to suppose that she would be glad enough to establish a footing on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea if a favourable opportunity offered. All this however does not mean that Signor Mussolini has already prepared plans for an’early advance against the Yemen. On the contrary we believe P that while there are no doubt not a few Italians—and some of them oerhaps in high places—who are casting covetous glances at the Arabian shores of themed Sea, no serious authority contemplates any 811(S) F&amp;PD65 forward action in that area for the moment. Italy has trouble enough on particularly in the economic and financial spheres, and 0 f co'ur^e Abyssinia has still to be digested; indeed, the greater part of that country has not yet even been swallowed. Ttalv’s foreign policy is essentially opportunist and I therefore hesi- 1 to vVnt, re any prophecy as to future trends. My own personal view ; tW Ttalv will quietly but determinedly make a drive during the next few fears It undermining our influence in the Arab and Moslem world; so we must be prepared for intrigue of every sort. But I doubt whether they will “strike” just yet. They are more likely to concen rate on prepar- ino - the ground, perhaps in the hope that they may e\entually be able to get ■what they want without having to f ‘strike at all. ( 81 ) Letter from the British Embassy, Rome, to the Foreign Office, No. 950, dated THE 29th August 1936. I have the honour to inform you that, according to a recent Stefani communiqud, the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce between Italy and the Yemen dated the 2nd September, 1926, the text of which was enclosed in Mr. (now Sir Charles) Wingfield’s despatch from this Embassy, No. 846 of the 4th October, 1926, has been extended until November 1937 by an exchange of notes between the two Governments. I shall not fail to supply you with the text of these notes as soon as they are published in the Official \Oazette. 2. The extension of this treaty has been the occasion of considerable comment in the press here. An article in the Popolo di Roma recalls that the important points established by the treaty were the declaration by the Government of the Yemen of their willingness to import technical material from Italy and to admit Italian experts into the country to assist in its economic development, and the declaration by the Italian Government of their willingness to grant facilities in this sense. When the treaty was concluded (continues the writer of the article) a number of Arab journals expressed the fear that Italy was planning to turn the Yemen into a zone of exclusive Italian influence and that the provisions of the treaty were not compatible with the full independence of that country. The ten years which have lapsed since the treaty was signed have been sufficient to explode this myth. Not only does the agreement not impinge in any way on the liberty of action of the Yemen Government, who are not obliged by it to accept Italian materials or experts against their wishes and whose i er y to purchase in whatever market they wish is expressly reserved, but a y s po icy since the signature has given rise to no suspicions that she has any^ other designs in the country than those compatible with true friend- nf fui' f In f n artlcle m tIle . Messaggero it is stated that the prolongation j i ^* ea / ^responds with the plans of the Italian Government for the the PAQiprl! anC i. maiI l ten ^ Ilce peaceful relations with the countries on commerrinl ^ Sea, where there exists a long tradition of Italv Ts dL^^F and of custom and religion with Ethiopia. “bon-voiqirmcrp’ ,me ’• ^ Y r ^ er this article, through relations of means in her^nmx^ 1 * 11 ^ 11 ^ t ^ lese States, to contribute by all the on their indenend^r ° P ro § ress an( i civilisation.

Kecent events give his words a peculiar significance. 4. Thus it will be seen that the renewal of the treaty between Italy and the Yemen has been made the occasion for a number of inspired articles illustrating the role of patron and friend which Italy aspires to play and which she believes she has already begun to play in the Near East. Colla boration with the Arab races, as the Giornale d*Italia observes, is to be developed to the mutual advantage of both parties. The conquest of Thiopia, it is said, has been a great step in this direction, for opposite tne Arab littoral now lies, not the amorphous dynasty of Abyssinia, but the Italian Empire with its harbours and roadsteads open to the exchange both of goods and of ideas. Nevertheless Italy does not, it is maintained, cherish designs on the liberty of the Arab States. On the contrary, their independence and their friendship are cardinal points in her policy. 5. These comments are doubtless designed to impress foreign (and in particular Arabian) as much as Italian opinion with the value of friend ship with the newly-founded Italian Empire and with the innocuousness of Itaian policy so far as the eastern shores of the Red Sea are concerned. Time alone can show the extent to which these professions will be trans lated into practice. 6. I have sent a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s representative at Jedda. Copy. (E.-5052/4552/25). ( 82 ) Enclosure in Foreign Office. Covering letter dated 16th October 1936. Lord Castle Stewart called upon me by appointment on August 5th bringing with him Mr. K. S. Twitchell the American who is managing the affairs of the Saudi-Arabian Mining Syndicate Limited. I had under stood that Mr. Twitchell had certain definite information which he wanted an opportunity of giving us but when the interview started it appeared that he was simply prepared to answer any question which I liked to ask him about general conditions in Saudi-Arabia. We had a certain amount of desultory conversation about the progress which the Mining Syndicate was making but, beyond the fact that the Syndicate found all the Saudi- Arabian authorities well disposed, with the possible exception of Yusuf Yasin, and that, apart from a regrettable tendency on the part of the local population to put boulders in the paths of motor cars, they had no particular difficulties, nothing much emerged. The Syndicate are apparently well satisfied with their progress and hope the mining will prove valuable. It soon became apparent that what Lord Castle Stewart and Mr. Twitchell really wanted to talk about was Italian influence in Saudi-Arabia. They were both rather disturbed by the efforts which the Italian Minister was making to impress the Saudi Government and by the possible consequences of the recent gift of aeroplanes, from the Italian Government to the Saudi .Government. Mr. Twitchell volunteered the opinion that the Saudis were deeply suspicious of the Italians and were not likely to facilitate the task of Italian penetration but he evidently thought that in practice it might be difficult to resist such penetration. In his view the United States and Great Britain were the only countries whom the Saudis were likely to trust. The United States though quite mterstedLetter from the British Legation, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 267, dated 12th September 1936. I have the honour to refer to your printed despatch No. 215 of the 20th August transmitting the record of Mr. Sterndale-Bennett’s interview with Lord Castle Stewart and Mr. K. S. Twitchell of the 5th August, ana in accordance with your instructinons to furnish my observations on the various questions touched on during the conversation. 2. It is interesting to observe that the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate's London officials were apparently welLsatisfied with the pro gress made so faT in this country and that they had hitherto encountered no serious difficulties. The claim that the prospects at Wejh are en couraging is made here with some confidence, but as regards the Mahd- ad-Dhahab I have for some time derived the impression from certain members of the Syndicate’s personnel that the future of these workings depends entirely on whether an adequate water supply can be assured, that the London Board regard the question as one of great importance von id appear from the fa^r that since I reported on this subject in despatch No. 225 of the 28th July last [S. No. (67)], they have sent out, (Signed) J. C. STERNDALE BENNETT. The 10th August 1936. , a -mPTipan companies in Saudi-Arabia were not likely in the operation of American co p ^ to gee Hig Maj / to take any active steps and he f^his ^ SaJldi _ Arabia . ^ ^ Government increasing th eed ^ jf probab ly would not do to give any and Lord Castle btewa g Saudis and they disclaimed any suggestion appearance of runn j? ment should enter into competition with the that His Majesty s senting aeroplanes to the Saudis. What Italians and the F w | s that the Italians might at some futu're^sSge t^ t'o g ' hole! of the landing grounds which the Saudi- 'Arabian hf'nin y Syndicate is making for its own use within its concession Arabian Mini y ^ ^ would bg well worth whll for Hls Majesty’s area. They s“gg whether the Saudis could not be attracted to this Government to co facilities for training air pilots in the United HSTl said that I thought there might be difficulties about this as His Majesty’s Government’s own hands were pretty full at present with air force expansion. However. I said that we would certainly consider whether anything on the lines suggested was feasible. Lord Castle Stewart said that the company had met with a certain amount of difficulty from the health point of view. A number of their employees had suffered from undefined illnesses and one or two had d,ed. The company were therefore taking steps to engage the services of an expert from the London School of Tropical Medicine to make a special study which would last for some months. They would propose to present the results of this study to the Saudi Government and it occurred to Lord Castle Stewart that one way of extending our influence would be m the field of medicine in Saudi Arabia. He seemed to have some idea of estab lishing a permanent medical adviser to the company who would also give the benefit of his advice to the Saudi authorities. I said that the idea of communicating to the Saudi Government the results of any expert investi gation which the company might undertake seemed to me a useful one. As to the establishment of any permanent medical advisers I advised Lord Castle Stewart to keep in the closest touch with His Majesty s Legation at Jedda in view of the difficulties which the Saudis seemed in clined to place in the way of foreign practitioners at the moment. I advised him to look very closely into the regulations which had recently been issued in regard to medical practitioners and foreign dispensaries anrl tn makA nnitp, sure of keening within the law of such regulations.abia )r His fsintkti ifis aboatt pres ^tainlyi t will a? or two lal e ieas 36 )ccurreiti would ki ime ideals ) would i: 1 that ties I at this somewhat unpleasant season of the year ? two water specialists of different qualifications, one a Swedish geo-physicist (at a salary of £300 a month) and the other a British waterdiviner. The latter has now left .. .. ^ agaSin for the United Kingdom and I have recently heard that both experts ' ll 1011 til have pronounced unfavourably on the prospects' of finding water at the Mahd. This, if true (for it is as yet unconfirmed), might well dissipate dreams of an Eldorado in that particular area. 3. As regard Italian influence in Saudi Arabia, Mr. Twitched’s opinion that the Saudis were deeply suspicious of the Italians is of con siderable interest. For my own part, I am impressed by the volume and unanimity of reports current in Jedda that the Italian Legation here is au mieux with the Saudi authorities, as I have reported in my despatch No. 259 of the 5th September, but I am unable to dismiss from my mind the impression created by Sheykh Yusuf Yasin, only two months ago, when he spoke to me, with a sincerity 1 found difficult to question, of his Government’s resolve not to grant the oil concession for the Earsan Islands to the Italians. The Saudi Government at that time resisted the pressure that was brought to bear on them here by the Italian Minister, a resistance which might well have caused them some embarrassment as they had not long before accepted at the hands of the Italians, the gift of three aeroplanes. Perhaps the fact that, as far as I am aware, the remaining three aeroplanes have not yet arrived, may be attributed to Italian dis appointment over the oil concession. I therefore am inclined to share Mr. TwiteheH’s opinion. I would certainly agree with the view that it would be impolitic to enter into any competition with the Italians for the favours of King Abdul Aziz, either in the supply of aeroplanes gratis or in the training of Saudi pilots. 4. It is somewhat difficult to express an opinion on the fears of Syndicate that Italians might at some future stage attempt to get hold of their landing-grounds. These, I understand, are now fairly numerous and have been established at Jedda, Mahd-ad-Dhahab, Wejh, Yaiibu, Dhiba and Taif, by special arrangement with the Saudi Government trom whom they are leased. It does not appear that at Jedda, at least there is any such menace, for the Saudi authorities, with, i^ is believed, Italian advice are now engaged in laying out a large landing ground north-east of Jedda in the vicinity of the Government’s Kandara villa, which, reports is also to be brought into use for the pilots and other personnel. If it y is true as reported in Jedda Report for June, paragraph 207 that the Eli; dnas s »y ix ssrsat* xiss.KT.ri—ast - - Government at that place. , whilst on his way to the Ma .

Here, however there would be less of the element of competition as between a commerce company and a Legation, than there would be m [he case of the gift of aeroplanes Moreover, there would be less opposition, I believe, on the part of 'the Saudi authorities to a non-Government dispensary or medical institution of the sort than to those conducted m this country under the auspices of foreign governments. There would, too, be no question of then- operations extending to Mecca. I should, therefore, on the wholebe favourably disposed towards a proposal of this nature, viz., the establish ment of a permanent medical staff here, more particularly as Jedda is badly off in its resources for medical treatment at present, and may be even more so before long, with Petroleum Concessions Ltd. bringing anew influx of Euroeans to this country.

That the distribution has been lavish would appear from the fact that my Indian vice-consul obtained six copies of each without any apparent difficulty. Apart from a totally incorrect report of 7,000 British casualties on the North-West Frontier of India (a report also broadcast recently from the Italian wireless station at Bari, causing some concern for a time amongst Indians resident here), the contents of these newspapers do not appear to be open to serious objection, their principal features being items of news of the progress of the Italian subjugation of Ethiopia; the reproduc tion of an article from the Egyptian Kowab-ash-Sharq on Italian Islamic policy, and referring in particular to the announcement by the Italian authorities that the Arabic language would be used in the courts of law at Harrar; and a number of photographs of Islamic institutions in Italian North Africa. 2. The dissemination in this way of Italian news, of a propagandist nature, is further proof of the interest now manifested by that country in Arabian affairs, an interest which my Italian colleague was said to have stressed, in referring to the friendly dispositions of his Government towards Arab nations, during his audience with Ibn Saud on the 10th May last, reported by Sir Andrew Ryan in his confidential despatch No. 146 of the 17th May. 3. Brief reference was made in Jedda report for August (paragraphs 263 and 286) to the unusual crop of rumours to which the visit of Amir Feisal to Jedda on the 14th August gave rise. In all of these the Italians figured prominently, and in a favourable light. Three more aeroplanes were to arrive here, it was said, during the Amir’s visit; they were to be brought by an Italian man-of-war; and a high Italian personage was to accompany them presumably to hand over to the Saudi Arab Governmen , though some reports went so far as to state that he was to superse Signor Persico (who has remained here this summer) as Italian Minister. Th g e^ rumours of course, died a natural death, but the impression m Jedda. is I think, general that the Italians are, for the present at least, on the most cordial terms with the Saudi authorities. Incidentally, the • •nai Italian offer of aeroplanes was of six machines, of which three onll so far as is known hL been delivered. Three more, therefore, may’be said to be overdue, and rumour is again busy, at the time of writing, Tjrnrffipsving their imminent arrival. . , , P P 4.

Then the Italian experiment has come to the end oi the first stage and it may be that the Italians are either reluctant to continue because of the poor equality of the students, or will not ^o on with it unless they receive some proof of Saudi friendship which Ibn^Saud is reluctant to supply. (In this connection I may mention that the “Saut-ul-Hejaz” of October 20th, published for the first time pieces of Italian propaganda taken from one of the Arabic newspapers distributed in Jedda by the Italian Legation). Or it may be that the relative success attained by the Iraq Air Force under British tuition has attracted Saudi attention : indeed, the commandant of the Saudi forces at Jedda recently praised the Iraq Air Force very highly in conversation with a member of the staff of the Legation . Or perhaps Sheykh Yusuf is courting a refusal so that we may be stopped from criticising Italian penetration in Saudi military affairs, 5. Whatever the motives behind the request, I do not suppose that it will appeal to His Majesty’s Government. It is unlikely that Saudi Arabia could produce five, still less ten to fifteen, young men every year who would make competent air pilots. It is possible that a few young men of good Nejdi origin could be found who, if they were put through a long complete course, would make creditable pilots, but I much doubt whether Saudi Arabia will be able for many years to come to provide men for a considerable air force, particularly the mechanics and other skilled artisans who would be required. I fear that the Saudi authorities are inclined to regard an airforce as chiefly a matter of pilots, and aeroplanes as being rather like gramophones whose handles anyone can be taught to turn. R T notice that in the conversation which the Air Officer Commanding, MidSe East had with Fuad Bey Hamza on the 23rd April (reported m a , . . tn |i. 0 a i r Ministry of which a copy was sent to Jedda in Foreign Office defpat* No. 130, dated the 14th May), he suggested tha.t The Saudi Government should send some young men to England or Egypt the feaum urove .

After my arrival my Government have begun to contemplate sending missions for education to be trained m aviation abroad so I found it better to write to you this private letter asking for your assistance in approaching the British Government with a view to finding out whether they would agree to accept training such missions in their schools. The Mission which will be sent shall not exceed ten to fifteen persons a year and it will be annually year after year. I therefore shall be glad if you will be good enough to enquire about the necessary terms and the help which the students may expect to get from the British Government in their training and the yearly expenses for each person. The purpose of such missions is to learn civil ; and military aviation. I I shall be grateful to Your Excellency if you would be good enough to furnish me with this information in the earliest possible convenience. Letter from Sir R. W.

I hasten to reply to your letter of 2nd Sha’bai (October 18th) which reached me yesterday and to express my thanks for the kind message from His Majesty the King which had the honour to receive by that means. I am reporting to His Majesty’s Government by telegraph your private suggestion about the training of Saudi students in aviation in England, and will communicate their reply to you as soon as it is received. I hope that there is no need to assure you with what sympathy His Majesty’s Government must regard the desire of the Saudi Arab Government to secure technical training for their young men so that they may take part m the development and defence of their country. Nevertheless I feel that 1 ought to remind you that at the present moment His Majesty’s Govern- ment are engaged m the reorganisation and wide extension of the British . ir * orce, and that according to my personal information, this task ?, a u d , energl “ of the aviation authorities fully that they training nf'nU^ 0 ' 11 *^ 0 P rovl . de for Sau di students the facilities which the hnensfve In .if S and , al T r0 , raftm en requires.

With reference to Foreign Office letter No. E.-6711/90/25 of 28th October enclosing for the observations of the Air Council, a copy of tele- gram No. 118 of October 25th from His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda regarding the desire of the Saudi Arabian Government to send a certain number ot Saudi subjects to this country for training in civil and military aviation, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to transmit to you the accompanying copy of a despatch which he has now received from Sir Header Bullard on this subject.^ 2. Mr. Eden appreciate the arguments advanced by Sir Reader Bullard againstySheikh Yusuf Yasin’s proposal, but he considers that the case for giving it sympathetic consideration is nevertheless a strong one. it may well be that the ordinary rather backward Arab from Saudi Arabia is unlikely to make a first class pilot. But the Iraqis have been able to produce a reasonably efficient air force under British guidance in a com paratively short space of time, and both Arabs and Egyptians have shown reasonable capacity to become good motor mechanics. In these circum stances the possibility of training Saudi Arabs to become adequate air pilots and mechanics should in Mr. Eden’s opinion not be ruled out except after full consideration. 3. Moreover, if His Majesty’s Government stand aside in this question and refuse to give the Saudi Arabian Government any assistance in res ponse to the present proposal a clear field will be left for other countries, who are prepared to incur considerable expenditure with a view to estab lishing their position and prestige in the Arabian Peninsula. Were His Majesty’s Govt, to adopt a policy which might be regarded as driving the Saudi Arabs into the hands of the Italians, for example, Italy might eventually obtain a privileged position in air matters in Arabia and thereby secure facilities for the establishment of an air route under Italian control from the Red Sea to the Persian Gulf or from Egypt through Arabia to the Yemen. The Italians are extremely anxious to establish air bases on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea and in Arabia itself, and anything tending to make aviation in Arabia more exclusively dependent on Italy than it already is would go far to facilitate this object. Mr. Eden hopes that full weight will be given to this consideration. 4 Mr Eden is aware that the Saudi Arabian Government do not dispose of sufficient funds to be able to pay large sums for the training of their pilots, and that cases have occurred in the past where great diffi culty has been experienced in collecting money due from the Saudi Arabian Government to His Majesty’s Government. . But . th ® X Arfbfa haJffir- Saudi Government of oil and mining concessions in Saudi Arabia has tur nished them with somewhat greater resources than they disposed of in the past and “f they are indeed anxious to develop their aviation they may be prepared to ear mark part of the resources now available for this be preparea to eai f it is for consideration whether the pa i Hrai a and am issues involved may not be of sufficient importance to ffisUfv 'a contribution by His Majesty’s Government for the purpose of facilitating compliance with the present Saudi Arabian proposals. inedinat such mil t exceed ti ear, Ida ut the m from the I; for EDDA, TO Si rthelessl® Majest) r ’ s ; sioDpf^' rmatioBi ;ies facilities ninr' w °ii. *tw: tfiite ''' B, “' 1 6 I am to request that Mr. Eden may be furnished with the views of the Air Council on the whole question at an early date. i • f tr. flip Trpasurv and India Office. 7.

Sir Andrew Ryan received nw than one proof that Mr. Philby was not in the inner councils of Ibn Sand, and it may be that Mr. Philby does not know that Ibn Saud s extreme claims on the southern frontier, as put forward during the recent discus sions do not include “all the tribes between Na]ran and the Hadhramant , still less any tribes or areas within the Hadhramaut. . I cannot believe that Ibn Saud, while in the middle of negotiations on this point, would even desire still less authorise Mr. Philby to make the wild statements that are now attributed to him. If the Qatar affair is mentioned as an argument on the other side, I would point out that Ibn Saud from the beginning advanced claims in respect of Qatar such as he has never put forward during the discussions about the south-western frontier. Had I had the opportu nity I should have spoken of Mr. Philby’s activities to some representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but the nearest, of any importance, is at Hail. I do not wish to deal with the case in writing, if it can be avoid ed, as that would enhance Mr. Philby’s importance, to his great ^dstac- tion, and would be more apt than in conversation to give the Saudi Arao Government the impression that we believed him to be acting under tneir instructions or at least with their connivance. I have usually found Arabs quick to diagnose Mr. Philby as obstinately wrong-headed, and if 1 see Fuad Hamza or Yusuf Yasin it should be easy to refer to his wild state ments in the Hadhramaut as obviously irresponsible though nevertheless liable to create a regrettable impression on people under British protection and to mar the good relations between Saudi Arabia and His Majestys Government, and to elicit a repudiation. I have no doubt that Mr. Phub} will express his views freely when I see him on his reurn, and what n® says may serve as a guide to action. It is unfortunate that his return journey is taking so long, and that the responsible Saudi officials are scattered over the Near East, but I think that to delay is better than totaK up the question in writing before I l^ave seen either Mr. Philby or some Saudi official with whom the matter can be discussed in a friendly In coming to this conclusion I have not overlooked the fact that Mr. Fi 11 « must have travelled with a considerable escort presumably provided by rn Saudi authorities, and that his talk of establishing a motor road gi ves 1 journey something of an official character. 3. If you wish a written protest to be made in any case you will doubt less give me instructions by telegraph. And anyhow, if I remain cu from personal contact with the Saudi Foreign Affairs officials for a cons deiable time longer, I may be forced to take up the matter in writing un geneial considerations seem to be strongly against that course.66 whosei, ex P\ am Philby’s activities further south.

Mr. Fearns went on to say that • rs to Wi he thought Mr. Philby’s stay in Najran (and possibly the whole trip through r Ryani: to the Hadhramaut) was not unconnected with the search for ancient re- ouncilsol! mains.

This propaganda had been » p'” 1 '' Mr. Soviet Union, Germany and Turkey. meant very ^ nn mv pmqq-auestioning the Minister as to precisely what all this nt ft t “ned outlhat what it all boiled down to was that Ibn Saud was uneasy about Italian propaganda in Arabia in general and about r- 1: “ SnHons in the Yemen in particular. Ibn Saud explained that { * “ agent we acUve % Yemen where they were by bribes and propaganda, undermining the influence of the Imam. This might lead to the fall of the Imam or in any case to the deyelopmeut of in extremely dangerous situation if the Imam should for any reason dis- appear' Ibn Saud was anxious, if possible, to come to some understanding with His Majesty’s Government about the situation. 5 I waited until the whole of this document had been explained before replying I then began by repeating, what I had often said before, that His Majesty’s Government fully appreciated and reciprocated Ibn Sand’s friendly feelings towards them, and appreciated in particular the way in which he wished to avoid any conflict of policy with them and from time to time consulted them on political questions with this object m view. There was certainly no reason why Ibn Saud should not continue to keep in touch with His Majesty’s Government on questions of policy, and His Majesty’s Government would always be glad to answer any questions he might ask them, whenever it was possible for them to do so. 6. As regards anti-British propaganda, the four countries which Ik Saud had named as being responsible for it were in rather different cate gories. I was surprised to hear the Turks mentioned, as our relations with Turkey had recently been particularly friendly. At this the Minister explained that Ibn Saud was no doubt thinking of the past. I said that if this was so, it was no good raking it up, but that I found it rather difficult to believe that the Turks were really carrying on any anti-British propa ganda now. As regards Germany, she was of course keenly trying to deve lop and expand her commerce in the Middle East; while Soviet Russia was, by the nature of things, bound to carry on propaganda everywhere in favour of her political ideas; but it would be useful to know whether Ibn Saud had any special cases in mind. Ip. reply to this, the Minister admitted that the only propaganda about which Ibn Saud was seriously worried was that of Italy. He did not seem inclined to follow up any of the other sugges tions, which may have been mere window-dressing. 7. I said that it was of course well-known that Italy had been carrying on a great deal of active propaganda all through the Middle East. We were well aware that this had often been violently anti-British— e.g., the broadcasts from Bari, etc., which were well known. Moreover it was clear that a good deal of Italian money had at one time or another been spent in such propaganda activities. In so far as they might be carried on in Saudi Arabia itself, only King Ibn Saud himself could deal with them. As regards such activities elsewhere, it would be useful to know whether Ibn Saud could give us any further details, and whether he had any definite suggestions to make. 8. The Minister replied that Ibn Sand had no definite proposals, but merely wished to bring the facts to our attention, particularly with regard to Italian intrigues in the Yemen. As regards Italian intrigues in Saudi Arabia, he would be very grateful for any information we could give him. I said that this might be difficult, since one might know that propaganda w as going on and money being spent, when it was nevertheless not possible to quote chapter and yerse. With regard to Ibn Saud’s suggestion that we should reach some understanding with Ibn Saud with regard to possible ta lan activities m the Yemen, I explained that the position was that His * s ~Y' )ve . rn P ient d esir ed to see Saudi Arabia strong and independent, and to see the independence of the Yemen equally maintained. This prin ciple underlay the Anglo-Italian Understanding of 1927, the substance of63 which had already been communeiated to Ibn Saud, by which Great Britain and Italy recognised their mutual interest in seeing the independence of the Arab kingdoms maintained, and mutually renounced any intention of establishing themselves on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. Italy was thus bound by an understanding with His Majesty’s Government not to establish herself in the Yemen, and she would hardly be likely to violate that understanding unless as part of some major dispute, which would turn not on local Arabian but on major European political issues. What ever one might thing of the value of Italian promises—regarding which one might well be sceptical—there could clearly be no question of His Majesty’s Government reaching an understanding with Ibn Saud which would be based on the assumption that a friendly European Power was about to vio late and undertaking which it had assumed towards this country. 9. The Minister, after some conversation in Arabic with M. Zada, replied that Ibn Saud did not mean an understanding of this kind, but that be merely wished His Majesty’s Government to know that they could rely on him to support them in the event of Italy attempting any adventure in the YYmen in violation of her undertakings. I said that I would record what the Minister had said and submit it for consideration, but I made it clear that, while we fully appreciated Ibn Saud’s attitude towards us and the dangers of the situation in the Yemen, we could not proceed on any assumption that Italy would disregard the Rome Understanding. 10. The Minister then reverted to the question of Italian propaganda in Iraq, but admitted that King Ibn Saud had nothing to go on and was merely puzzled and disturbed by what had recently happened in that country. H Tp e upshot of a long and somewhat confusing conversation seemed to be that' Ibn Saud wished for some kind of assurance that we did not regard him as a nuisance; wished to warn us of Italian activities in the Yemen and of the danger threatening from that quarter, which would be greater to him even than to us; and seemed to hope to obtain from us some kind of undertaking to join with him in resisting any Italian attack on the Yemen, a suggestion which the Minister abandoned as soon as I indicated some ot the obvious objections to it.

With further reference to your letter (E. 1133/205/25) of the 7th of Mnv on the subject of the Hejaz Railway, I now enclose a copy of a i 7 * n ^oforl 19th Mav 1936 from the High Commissioner containing his obseSot on he cSsfons reached by tie Haifa conference, consider^ Gon of which in the Colonial Office has had to be postponed on account of many more urgent preoccupations. . , . „ .

Since there is a consi- woiild P' 0Vld ® Sl j h Palestine and Trans-Jordan sections, those Govern, derable loss they have already done their share in pect of the Ra ^ ^ in There seems to be little likelihood of either Palestine Una or Trans Jordan contributing anything towards the scheme save that Trans-Jordan might undertake some responsibility i n respect' of the small section in its own territory, if the whole scheme were adcpted^een^ ^ ^ equa ii y unlikely that the Saudi Government will find the money at the present time. There appears to be no chance that the line will be a paying proposition, and one can hardly see the Saudi Gov ernment, which is notoriously short of money, providing £150,000 on which they would get no return. The unattractive commercial possibilities in turn seem to make it most unlikely that any private syndicate would undertake the work. It therefore appears that the only possible way of raising the mooey is that His Majesty’s Government should provide it. They certainly could not justifiably provide it on the grounds of the scheme’s commercial attrac tions, but it is conceivable that it might be possible to justify the expendi ture on political grounds. The Railway was destroyed during the Great War and it might be argued that, having regard to the history of its destruction and to its general interest to the Moslem world, and as a gesture to the Moslem world, His Majesty’s Government should undertake to repair it. Such a gesture might have considerable advantages at the present time. It would show the Arabs that we are very much interested in their welfare and it might be a means of counteracting the spread of Italian influence in that area. It may finally be worth consideration, whether the Railway could be regarded as of possible strategic value to His Majesty’s Government. In the event of a war with Italy, if Saudi Arabia threw in their lot with us, it might conceivably be a link in an alternative route to the Suez Canal. Do you think in the circumstances that there is a case on general political grounds for His Majesty’s Government undertaking to pay the cost of re pairing the Railway? If you think that there is a case, the next step would presumably be to bring the Treasury into consultation on the matter. If, on the other hand, you consider that there is no case, it is probably a waste of time to pursue the matter further as it seems extremely unlikely that apy other source will assist to a sufficient extent to enable the money to be raised. The Railway has remained derelict for the last fifteen years without causing any great disturbance in the Moslem world and presumably it can remain derelict for a further period without any un toward results. As time goes on, the need for the Railway will probably ^ecome steadily less, since pilgrims will tend to go to Mecca more and more by motor routes.

Consequently I can* not suppose that His Majesty’s Government, or indeed anyVlie/source, would be willing to provide a sum of nearly £P. 200,000 for the repair of a line which could be expected to earn so inadequate a return. And if restoration of the railway has any value commercially it is almost exclu sively as a means to develop the northern Hejaz and to revive Medina, and to that extent any financial liability should rest entirely on the Saudi Government. 4. I need hardly say that I should be very glad if an agreed means could be found for the provision of the required capital. Apart from the incidental benefits which might be expected to accrue to Palestine and Trans-Jordan, as explained in my despatch Confidential B of the 14th June, 1934, I think that an agreement leading to the restoration of the line would favourably affect the political relations between His Majesty’s Govern ment and King Ibn Saud. But His Majesty’s Government are better able than I to judge what weight should be given to this consideration. (91) Letter from the Colonial Office, to the Resident at Aden, dated 7th December 1936.

Under the Treaty of Sana’a, on which the treaty relations of His Majesty’s Government with the Government of the Yemen are based, Hia Majesty’s Government have recognised the complete and absolute indepen dence of the King of the Yemen, who consequently is free to enact any internal legislation he may wish. There is nothing in that Treaty to pre vent him from imposing restrictive legislation on British subjects m the matter of their ownership of real property in his country, provided all foreigners are treated in the same way. 3 1 am unaware of the legal position of foreigners in the Yemen in the matter of the ownership of such property prior to the notification from the Kinn of the Yemen to the Governor of Hodeida enclosed m the despatch under reference I am advised, however, that it would be contrary to international law that British subjects and protected persons should suffer nlrunfarv losX reason of the application of a law compelling them to rfisnose of real properties which they have acquired with the permission tZth the toleration of the Government at that time exercising authority. d Tu this case therefore, I am of the opinion that British subjects and British sass-*-. “ fir prop® * 830(S) F&amp;rD7 - a r,t nf tHe operation of the Order or at any rate a oronerty.

With reference to my despatch No. 66 of February 6th, on the subject treaty of ailiance between raq^ ^ d the A dv i se r to the Ministry ^rirrim that wThin the last few days Shaikh Yusuf Yasin braised with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the three following questions. (1) The delimitation of the Iraqi-Saudi Arabia frontier. (2) The abolition of the neutral zone at Tawal. (3) The conclusion of a new extradition agreement between the two countries. 2. None of these questions appears to involve any important Bnt^ interest except possibly that of the delimitation o f-u ' an( l Saudi stand from Mr Edmonds that it is possible that the Iraqi and ^au Governments will agree, that if inaccuracies are discovered in the gwg ^ phical coordinates given to any wells, ^i 11 ^ 0 ^ com- the frontier described in the first protocol of Uqair, the del . ^ mission which the Saudi Government have suggested s o ^ c0 _ shall be guided in their work by the actual places rather . ^ pn ordinates assigned to them.

This proposal is being examined by the Iraqi Government, buc as at present the only im portant feature of this territory is the watering places used by the bedouin tribes of Nejd and Iraq, it does not appear that His Majesty’s Govern ment need be concerned as to the manner in which it is dealt with by the two limitrophe governments. 6. As regards extradition, Mr. Edmonds tells me that he understands that the Saudi Arab Government are asking for an agreement considerably wider in scope than that signed at Mecca in April 1931. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda and to His Majesty’s Consul-General at Beirut. Letter from the Foreign Office, to H. M.’s Ambassador, Bagdad, No. E. 981/52/25, dated the 11th March 1936. Tou may like to have a private word of explanation about our attitude towards the question of the frontier between Saudi Arabia and Iraq, as developed in your official despatch No. 89 (17/25/36) of the 17th February. 2. I should explain in the first place that we have long been familiar with the discrepancy between the true position of the summit of the Jebel Anaiza as now surveyed on the ground and the geographical description of it i.e., the approximate intersection of latitude 32 North with longitude 39 East given in the Protocol of Uqair—a geographical description which is repro duced by itself in the Hadda Agreement. In our view there is no doubt what ever that the true summit of the Jebel Anaiza as now surveyed must be regard ed as the terminal point of the frontier, since the geographical co-ordinates are quoted in the protocol of Uqair merely as a supplementary or explanatory, and not as a substantive, definition. Indeed they are only mentioned as giving the approximate position. g q'pg point is of considerable importance to us in connexion with tho qector of the Transjordan-Saudi frontier laid down in the Hadda Agree- inent. The negotiators of that Agreement plotted the frontier on the 1918 edition of the one in a million War Office international map, and, as Jp nlotted and shown on that map, the frontier is a more or less reasonable one It now turns out however that the physical features are m fact wrondv shown on that map in relation to the geographical coordinates ■nritv, c the result that if the frontier were plotted on the giound or on a 7ev/sed map purefy in the light of the geographical coordinates quo ed in t hi Wndda P Agreement for purposes of definition, a new and most un- the Hadda ^g ie rA i n tion to the physical features would result. We satisfactory frontier in region to ^ closely as possible are satisfied here ‘ ^ . UfA J relation to the ■physical features as shown the line drawn on the quoted in the Hadda on that map, and that the F where they do not correspond to /Agreement should therefore be d g . rt G f t pj s view, however, line. Our tSLlfT the Transjordan-Saudi is the fact that the Nort a North-Western terminal of the Iraqi - frontier must correspond with tbe^ North ^es of ^ d o f'llq air^whic^ defines the latter termmal that ^ point® m en- of the frontier will follow.73 ' 4 All this of course is rather outside your immediate sphere, butf Vhnnlht it might be useful to you to know that the establishment of the North Western terminal of the Saudi-Ira qi frontier at the true summit of the Jebel Anaiza and not at the geogi aphical point mentioned nq a suDolementary definition in the Protocol of Uqair will be very definitely to our advantage/and very helpful to us m our negotiations with the Saudi Government about the Transjordan frontier. 5 As regards the neutral zone, the matter seems to be entirely one for the Saudis and Iraqis to settle between themselves, but our experience here generally speaking, has been that neutial zones are an unmitigated nuisance and that if they could be got rid of the situation is likely to be considerably simplified. They have in particular given us a great deal of trouble in connexion with recent negotiations for oil concessions in Arabia. 6. As regards extradition I was under the impression that the settle ment arrived at in Mecca in April, 1931, had been found to offer a very satisfactory solution of existing difficulties. I am not sure whether w e are called upon to advise further in regard to it, but the Treaty Depart ment generally have rather strong views on extradition questions, and if you are in any doubt therefore you may like to send us a separate despatch on the point. Letter from the British Embassy, Baghdad, to the Foreign Office, No. 17/27/36, dated the 20th February 1936. With reference to my despatch No. 89 of February 17th, about tbe Iraqi Government’s negotiations with Saudi Araoia, I enclose a copy of a note prepared by Edmonds for his minister on tne Iraqi—Saudi Arabia boundary and the neutral zone. In his covering letter Edmonds writes that he thinks that the Saudi proposals for the bisection of the neutral zone and the demarcation of the frontiers are not likely to be pressed, but that importance is attached by the Saudi delegation to the Dahamshah dispute and to the amendment of the extradition agreement. Both of these are hardy annuals carefully cul tivated by Ibn Saud. They are, however, solely the concern of the Iraqi and Saudi Governments and I need not bother you with details. I learn from Yassin Pasha that the revival of these stale and antiquated differences has rather overcast the dawn of a new Arabian brotherhood which some optimists saw on the horizon and, in consequence, the treaty of alliance is being extensively redrafted. I gather that Yassin has done some plain speaking to Yusuf Yasiu and has told him franklv that Saudi Arabia clearly cannot help Iraq effectively m any circumstances until she becomes more civilised and that, on the other hand, he must not imagine that Iraq will allow herself to be drawn willy- nilly into any complications m which King Abdul Aziz may become involved with states either members or non-members of the League. Yusuf Yasin apparently asked what Iraq would do if Saudi Arabia were to go to war with Great Britain; Yassin just told him not to be silly. SAUDI IRAQ NEGOTIATIONS: NOTE NO. 4. The Boundary. 1. Shaikh Yusuf A1 Yasin has proposed : \d) that the Neutral Zone shall be divided between the two States; (0 that the boundary shall be demarcated. 2. The relevant article in the Treaty of Muhammara reads as follows According to Article 1 (a) the Muntafiq, Dhafir and Amarat tribes belong to Iraq, similarly the Shammar Neid belong to «• ine wells and lands used from old times by the Iraq tribes74 at ' llca l poii ^^ioiiswj 5S , kt 0 !s are ai tuatioii i ' r en ns a rl ess ioii lit | n ot sureii separate fe the Eo®i Ry 1936, raary llih.

The characteristic feature of this description is that the boundary line is made to run m a series of straight lines between points named on the^ap which are for the most part groups of wells. F ’ 4. With regard to proposal (a) my observations are as follows The neutral zone is a lozenge shaped area containing a large number of wells known as Tiw al adh Dhafir, i.e., the deep wells of the Dhafir. In fact the Dhafir claim them all, even Al Uqubba, the well at the southern obtuse angle. The lozenge is not perfect and a straight line ioining the eastern and western acute angles would leave the greater area and the majority of the wells on the Saudi side, indeed most of the wells are situated m the southern obtuse angle. The proposal is definitely unfavourable to Iraq, would complicate the watering problems of the Dhafir and, in my opinion, should be rejected. It would however be desirable to define by agreement the method of adminis tration of the neutral zone. 5. The advisability or otherwise of demarcating the boundary was considered in 1927; at that time the verdict was that a demarcation would be unfavourable to Iraq for the following reasons:— (a) The traditional southern boundary of the Amarat, viz., the watershed dividing the Wadis draining northwards (known as the Widyan) from the wadis draining to the Wadi Sirhan lay considerably to the south of the line defined in the Uqair Protocol (e.g., the source of the Wadi Arar is in fact 100 miles south-west of Judaidat al Arar), and the watershed was at that time being observed as a status quo line; (b) The frontier from Qasr Uthaimin to the terminal point at Jabal Anaz was described in the Protocol as a straight line; but the description included mention of certain other points which appeared in the map then used (War Office I. M. 1917-18) to be situated on the straight line but, in the light of more recent information, were known to be really situated all to the north of the straight line between the terminal points. The boundary line would therefore follow not a single straight line but a series of straight lines running well to the north of it, i.e., even more unfavourable to Iraq. 5. It appears to me that these objections have today lost their force since:— (a) The Saudi agents are now aware of the places named in the Protocol and are working up to them; there is thus no status quo as distinct from the legal boundary; and Cb) Objection (b) was always theoretical rather than practical, since both the tribes and the agents of the two Governments know the places named by their situation on the ground, and not m terms of geographical co-ordinates.75 , t „ rAwrnments are anxious to remove all outstanding 6 .

Yusuf Yasin informed me yesterday confidentially and again under instruc tions of the King, that Italian Government had recently offered to give Saudi Arabian Government six aeroplanes, three for training purposes and three for civil use. The offer had been accepted in accordance with general policy of preserving the appearance of friendly relations with Italy but the King’s fundamental policy of friendship with His Majesty’s Government remained unalterable. I said that your last expression of views regarding transactions with Italy was not fresh in my memory but that I thought general view of His Majesty’s Government in this Case would be that while the matter was one for the judgment 0 the Saudi Arabian Government, the Italian offer should be regarded with caution m view of the pbssibility of political or other ulterior motives. i i &gt; a J USuf 7 a f n declare &lt;i the utmost caution had been used ; the Italian Charge f . ai f. es a d assured him that the sole motive was interest in the development ^ ^ C01 i nt /y T t0 which the Italian Government had collaborated by this in writing? t0 Ital y hist year.

It was reconstituted ae fmm March 24tl, by a decree issued three days earlier and published on March orT T have adverted in another connexion to the inclusion m the new Cornell of Abdur Kauf As-Sabban, formerly one of the most active conspirators abroad fo-ainst Ibn Saud. The point to which I now have to draw attention is that the decree prescribed that the new session shall last or one year Tins would appear on the face of it to involve a constitutional change from the system of two year sessions. 3 What is more important is that in a speech by the King on the opening of the new session, he said that he had ordered the preparation, during the new session of the Legislative Council, of a regulation providing for an annual meeting of representatives of every district of the Kingdom at pilgrimage time in order to strength the bonds between the people and the Government. At a later meeting the Council adopted an address to His Majesty, which has been published with a good deal of other matter relating to the Council and its past and future activities. The most interesting document is the portion of the Amir Feysal’s speech, when the address was being considered, in which he deaf with the proposal for an annual national assembly. He . explained that the representatives would meet for one month on the occasion of each annual pilgrimage. He justified the shortness of this period by referring to t e inconvenience which would be entailed, if representatives from remote places were required to absent themselves far longer from their homes and to the inability of the Government to hear the strain of heavy expenditure. He added, however, that at the end of the month’s session, a permanent body would_ he set up (a sort of committee of the Assembly apparently) to consider the views etc., expressed by the Assembly. 4. It remains to be seen what, if anything, will come of this project, h recalls the abortive experiment described in correspondence ending with icy despatch No. 279 of July 19th, 1931. On that occasion the “National Conference’ was composed of representatives of the Hejaz towns only. It was intended io he annual but the urban representatives were somewhat fractious and the Conference was never re-assembled. 5. I may mention in this connexion another speech made by the King’ at a banquet m Mecca on April 14th. It consisted largely of religious exhortations, nii it ret erred to his desire for greater direct contact with his people, so tha he might know their desires and that they should know of his proceedings and l-l/'l 1 | 011S ; . 1 | lls object he declared his intention of receiving any one ^ 0 : V ; • A . s aua inat should know ol Ms proceeding J! * l 1 ] 011S ; ^ ith this object he declared his intention of receiving any one ^ 0 0 rv m ^ e ^ ween 8 and 9 p.m. in the evening and stated that in Jj 18 rbo^D.1 f A Ce Tf y +y° uld i rece!ve visitors in his place at Mecca or Taigas the some sctiob 6 f - S g hen ; e sh(ra M come into practical effect, it would be ■ t e KhA IbS ext “ t0 the of the traditional system in Nejd, whete the King receives tribal personages snd the like very freely. r(49) (Received on 4th.

M.’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 137 dated the 8th May 1936. With reference to my telegram No. 57 of April 30th : [Serial No. (40)] and previous correspondence relative to the relations of Italy and Saudi Arabia, I have the honour to state that on May 7th Sheykh Yusuf Yasin informed me that Ibn Sand had consented to receive my Italian colleague at Ashaira, where His Majesty has been living in camp for the last two or three weeks. The King had tried to excuse himself but had agreed to the visit after M. Persico had repeated his request four times, stressing the infrequency of His Majesty’s visits to Jedda and, finally, the danger of an unfavourable impression in Rome, if his wish were not gratified. He had explained that his sole object was to pay his respects. Sheykh Yusuf thought that this was true but promised to inform me, if anything more important came of the visit. 2. I said that I did not think that the action of the King in agreeing to receive the Italian representative would be misunderstood. It is quite true that the King has been very little in Jedda during the last year and that M. Persico has had no opportunity of meeting him during that period as he was absent for both the King’s visits on February 25th-26th and from March 26th to April 2nd. It is therefore, not unnatural that he should wish to make sure of seeing His Majesty before the latter proceeds to Nejd. It may be difficult for either to keep off such subjects as the training of Saudi aviators in Italy, the Italian offer of aircraft and perhaps the proceedings of the now discredited Signor Odello or to ignore completely the recent Italian successes in Abyssinia. It is indeed unlikely that my Italian colleague, who has probably acted on instructions from Rome, intends to undertake the somewhat laborious journey to Ashaira merely to say How do you do ? On the other hand I see no present reason to suspect a definite object on either side of major political importance. For one thing Sheykh Yusuf said that he himself would not go to Ashaira tor the visit though a subordinate member of the staff of his Ministry would be m attendance. . . J ' H 4 3. I do not consider Sheykh Yusuf’s information important enough to telegraph, unless any further developments should appear to invest the matter with greater significance. . . , , . . , , 4.

With reference to the _ despatch No. 332, addressed to your predecessor on August 1st last by His Majesty s Minister at Tehran, relative to Iranian represen- tation abroad, I have the honour to state that on January 7th the late Iranian Minister here, Mahonamed Ali Khan Mogaddam, sent to my foreign colleao-ues here and myself letters expressing his regret that, having been appointed to the Iranian Legation for the Balkan States, he could not take leave of us m person. He informed us also of the prospective arrival of his successor “ Son Excellence,' Rad” . 2. The late Minister’s letter terminates a very anomalous situation in Jedda. He left for Syria last May, without notifying the fact officially to his colleagues, having had, it would appear some arrangments with his Government which enabled him to regard the Lebanon as in some sense a suburb of this city to which he could retire without going on leave. It subsequently became known that the Iranian Legation here was to be combined with that ‘in Cario and that Mohammed Ali Khan had been transferred to the Balkans but we remained for many months without official knowledge of these changes, 3. The Iranian Minister in Cairo, M. Soltan Ahmed Khan Rad, arrived in the roads of Jedda on February 2nd and landed here to-day to take up his additional post as Minister here.

His Majesty received most of the members of the diplomatic body in the forenoon of February 25th but departed from his usual custom of givin« successive audiences to the various heads of missions on his arrival in Jedda. He had to receive the credentials of no less than three new Ministers later in the day and saved tune by receiving the other representatives all together, plus one of the new Ministers, M. Maigret, who was already Charge d’Alfaires. In these circumstances the audience was even more formal than usual. The King appeared to be in good health and spirits. &amp; 4. lam reporting separately on the presentation of their credentials by the new Ministers of the U. S. S. R., Iran and France. By 5 p.m. they had been to see the King and were qualified to attend a reception of all the foreign representatives by the Heir Apparent in the afternoon. On this occasion the proceedings were equally formal but uniform was not worn except by M. Maigret, who had probably had no time to change. It is noteworthy, as a sign of the enhanced position of the Amir Saud, that he held this reception, not in the King’s Palace, but in another house frequently used for ceremonies. 5. On the morning of February 26th I visited the King to present Mr. Maxwell Darling, whose visit to Arabia in connexion with locust research has been the sub ject of other correspondence. His Majesty discoursed in the liveliest possible manner about locusts. He was greatly imbued with the traditional Islamic theory that these insects originate in the interior of a particular kind of fish, which apparently spews them forth on to an inland or islands, whence they fly over the sea to innocent countries like Arabia. I understand from Mr. Philby that this rests on some tradition of the Prophet, not binding (fortunately for Mr. Philby) as an article of faith, but generally accepted by true believers. The King could therefore not be expected to discard it, but he paid a passing tribute to the value of modern scientific research. 6. The King made no reference to any questions outstanding between Great Britain and Saudi Arabia. Fuad Bey had suggested that I might like to stay on after Mr. Darling’s audience to talk business. His Majesty, however, made no effort to detain me and I myself was glad to retire, as I had not received your final instructions on the major questions and had decided not to follow up at present my request for an audience to discuss the question of the Government of India dispensaries. Moreover the Soviet and Iranian Ministers were waiting to be received in private audience. 7. The King returned to Mecca on the afternoon of February 26th. Th 01 ® were no festivities during his stay. I had by way of precaution warned uac Bey that, while I could attend a formal audience to pay respects, I should be pre vented by Court mourning from attending anything m the nature of a social functions. . . 8 Great precautions have been taken in Mecca for some time past to unit the number of possible undesirables during the of discOTiraghig taken have been harsh.

His diplomatic experience outside Iran seems to have been small. He served in the Persian Embassy m Constantinople for a couple of years not long before the Great War but has spent most of his official life at home under variouf departments of the Iranian Government including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, under which he served as Karguzar m the provinces and the Ministry of Justice. He had been President of a section of the Court of Cassation for six or seven years before he was appointed to Cairo about two years ago. He speaks French fairly well and appears to have a good knowledge of Arabic besides a knowledge of Turkish which I have not tested, 3. M. Rad has no intention of spending much of his time in this country. He told me on February 10 th that he might not even leave a secretary here on his return to Egypt but simply close the Legation in Jedda, which serves no useful purpose except to a small extent round about pilgrimage time. 4 .

Although this memorandum includes certain information which has already been reported to your Department, it adds a good deal that has come to the knowledge of the Legation since the date of the c espatc under reference and gives a useful comprehensive picture of what has a come tie most important industrial enterprise in the west of Saudi Arabia. I therefore enclose a copy of it. RnJV!

Memorandum respecting the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate [Limited) Mining Concession, dated the 11th January 1936. (a) Areas being worked, or about to be worked [or prospected in the near future). The operations of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate commenced in March 1935 at the Mahd-adh-Dhahab (position according to latest estimates at 23 degrees 30 minutes north by 41 degrees east) and near Yanbu The latter workings, where Mr. Shanks was engaged, were abandoned in the early summer, but the former have continued and have been developed with considerable prospects of success. Under the terms of the original concession reported to the Foreign Office by Sir Andrew Kyan’s despatch No. 56 of the 24th February 1935 [Serial No. (31) in File No. 1-N./35}], by which areas which it is desired to prospect further should be designated within one year, and areas for exploitation must be fixed and subsidiary exploitation companies formed within two years of the date of the concession, it is becoming a matter of urgency to determine the areas which can be worked profit ably. Mr. Shanks has been away prospecting for the past two months or more (he returned on the 21st December, 1935), but had not had much success. His pros pecting trip is believed to have taken him in an easterly and north-easterly direc tion, well into Nejd, almost but not quite as far as the Jebel Hilit (see below). At the end of 1935 arrangements were stated to be under way for four separate prospecting parties to go out into the concessionary area, the districts to be ex plored being, it is said, Yanbu’ (in spite of previous failure in that neighbourhood). Wejh and two others not at present definitely known. M. Van de Poll left for Wejh about the end of December in this connexion. (b) Facts known as regards handing over the Mahd to an Exploitation Company. The little we know on this subject may be summarised as follows. The first mention I believe, was by a member of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate to a member’of the Legation early in August, 1935. This was reported to the Foreign Office in our despatch No. 227 of the 6th August, 1935 [Serial No (57) in File No. 1-N./351. Towards the end of October, 1935, another member of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate stated that the syndicate had given “ the new company one square mile to survey, a conversation which was reported m our despatch JNo. o39 of the 28th November, 1935 [Serial No. (10)], paragraph 5. It is difficult to determine from these brief references whether the Mahd itself is to be turned over to the subsidiary (it seems most probable), or wnether an adja cent area is being made over to it, or both. (c) Facts known or surmised regarding Difficulties with the Saudi Arab Govern- v J ment. Difficulties are believed to have arisen with the Saudi ^ G ?™™ d “ries over the definition of the boundaries^ the original con^ssm^ Th b ^ iCS-cUVa. 12 thnMmm.

No. 59 of February 28th [Enclosure to Serial No. (20)] relative to the recent proceedings of Ibn Saud, I have the honour to state that the King would appear to have taken part in the pilgrimage normally, except that unusual police precautions were taken to obviate the possibility of his being attacked in the same way as last year. 2. The King gave his usual dinner to notable pilgrims on February 29th and delivered his usual speech. To judge by the report published in the Umm-al-Qura, the speech presented few features of interest. It abounded in the cust mary commendations of Islam. His Majesty reproached Moslems with saying much and doing little. Jews and Christians, he observed, were in the habit of not acting in accordance with their professions. Moslems should not follow their example. He adjured all Moslems and in particular Arabs to bethink themselves, to return to the right path and to be united. Many of his co-religionists, he went on, held that the reason why Moslems were backward was that they did not follow the ways of civilisation. This was an error, because Islam did not prevent its adherents from adopting anything useful, provided it did not touch their faith. He urged fidelity to religious duties, the most important of which was the performance of the pil grimage. 3. The same issue of the paper quoted elsewhere an utterance of the King at the banquet, which does not appear in the main report of his speech. This referred to the closeness of the relations between the peoples of Nejd and Iraq which were of old standing. He spoke of the Nejdi origin of many inhabitants of Iraq. Iraq and its people°were, he said, dear to him and to all his subjects. Their progress brought pleasure to his heart and he wished them advancement and success, t his passage may have some political significance in connexion with the present negotia- Sons between tie two countries, which, as you know, were suspended for the pilgrimage and the ensuing festival. 4 The King was not so absorbed in his religious duties at pilgrimage time as to be indifferent to developments abroad. Fuad Bey Hamza surprised me by rinskis me up on the first day of the festival to enquire about a report that the &gt;i ng b v ,1 wav or other, which I did not quite grasp, made a move for Negus, had, in s 7 h j k 0 f the appeal to both combatants by the peace.

Princess Khadija had already arranged to proceed to Medioa e« route for Egypt by air and left Jedda on or about March 12th in an aeroplane, which had been sent from Cairo. 4 It is also worth recording that a start has been made this year with the use of aircraft for the pilgrimage. No general air service from Egypt was organised but, apart from the Princess Khadija’s aeroplane, three other small machines belong- ing to Misr Airwork arrived in Jedda from Cairo with a party of pilgrims, understand that four had started and that the party included two cadets oi the. Egyptian Royal family but one of the machines, and I believe one of the young princes, got into difficulties at one or more places on the coastal route in the Northern Hejaz and failed to arrive in Jedda., 5.

[Enclosure to Serial No. (26)]- Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 74 (586/244/4), dated the 29th March 1936. With reference to my despatch No, 355 of December 14th last [Serial No. (11)], I have the honour to state that the Saudi Arab Government have now rewarded the three principal eae-conspirators, who returned to this country last year under the “ amnesty ” proclaimed in January 1935, by giving them the following appoint ments :— (a) Seyyid Tahir Ad-Dabbagh to be Director of Education; (b) Sheykh Abdur-Rauf Sabban to be a member of the Legislative Council, as reorganised for its new two years’ session beginning March 24th 1936 ; (c) Major Muhammad Sadiq to be Assistant Director of Awqaf. 2. These three gentlemen had already been treated with marked consideration, e.g., the first two were among the guests at the banquet presided over by the Amir Eeyzal and attended by all the foreign representatives here on the evening of Jan uary 8th, the King’s Accession Day. Muhammad Sadiq was omitted from the banquet, possibly for some political reason, but he too seems to be favourably re garded in certain high Saudi circles. He did not come so much to the attention of His Majesty’s Government as various other conspirators, when the Saudi Govern ment were raging against them in and about 1932, but he has some importance in this country, as he commanded for a time the forces which defended Jedda for the Hashimites at the time of the Saudi invasion of the Hejaz. 3. I take the oportunity of correcting a misapprehension, under which I have laboured for some time regarding the Directorate of Education and which I may have conveyed to others. I was under the impression that the Saudi Minister in London was still theoretically Director General of Education and that the late working hand of the Department, another Egyptian named Ibrahim Shura, was Director. Fuad Bey tells me that Sheykh Hafiz Wahba vacated the department on his appointment to London but that it was not filled. Ibrahim Shura, the Director of the “ Saud Institute ” in Mecca, was made acting director. He has now reverted to his post at the Saudi Institute on the appointment of Ad-Dabbagh to the substantive post of Director of Education. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to Baghdad, Aden, Trans-Jordan and the Government of India. I have the honour to be with the highest respect.

The main elements in the pre-war Turkish currency wem the Turkish gold pound, similar in fineness to, but about -9 per cent of the wesht of the Enllish sovereign; and the famous silver com called the Mejidie whkh ’though it had depreciated somewhat, stood for many years in a fixed relation to gold The Turkish gold pound was divided theoretically into 100 gold piastres although the gold piastre did not exist as a com. It ensued from this that the English gold pound was worth 110 gold piastres. The meyidie and its sub divisions which included a current silver piastre, had various values according to the uses to which it was put but for official puiposes it was reckoned at about 102 Piastres to the Turkish gold pound and about 112 piastres to the English gold pound. The market rate was lower. I quote these figures from memory but they are sufficiently accurate for my present purpose. 3. The Saudi regulations of 1928 substituted for the mejidie and its.sub divisions Saudi silver riyals of exctly the same size, weight and silver content and established the legal parity, already mentioned, of ten riyals to the English gold pound, which had more or less superseded the Turkish gold pound. By an adapta tion of the old Turkish rates for gold, they provided that the English gold pound and the riyal respectively should be divided into 110 and 11 theoretical piastres called “ miri ”, which corresponded to the Turkish “ gold piastres ’ and into 220 and 22 current piastres, which came to be known as Saudi. 4. From 1931 to 1934 the Saudi riyal fluctuated greatly, the general tendency being in the direction of depreciation, subject to seasonal variations in the opposite sense. Last year, however, the n?/a/, while still well below its legal value in terms of gold, showed a tendency to appreciate. There appeared to be a shortage of silver currency and early in the autumn the Saudi Government cast about for means ot remedying the situation. They had already begun to import large quantities ot Indian rupees, mainly for use in Nejd, where the Saudi riyal had never been popular and had never ousted the Maria Theresa dollar. They also contemplated a new issue of silver riyals, a project which has formed the subject of correspondence ending with my Chancery’s letter to the Eastern Department of February 1st last. I may add that after that letter was written, I had reason to suppose that the new riyals were to be similar, except for the Saudi superscription, to the Indian rupee, that the quantity ordered, including presumably silver sub-divisions, was riyak 1,000,000 ; and that the parity of the new riyals would be fixed at Riyals 20 to the gold pound. One informant suggested to me that the existing riyals would lie withdrawn and that the new issue would suffice for all requirements, a thing which I find it difficult to believe unless the rupees from India are used to eke out the official currency not only in Nejd but in the Hejaz. . c f' the issue of the new riyals, of which I have heard nothing furth'J) • 10 c11 yt Mimstr y °t h inance has sprung a fresh surprise on the public by pubhsi mg on March 23rd a notice, which I enclose in translation. Its main effects appear to be to establish a new legal parity of the existing riyal at the rate of 20 to the gold pqun or t e purpose of transactions with the Government; to abolish the nun piastre ; to readjust the relation between gaudi piastres and the other elements m he currency by calculating the gold pound at 220 Saudi piastres, the riyal at 118 pi stres and the nickel piastre at half a Saudi ^ payments to the Government hitherto fixed in miri pilstrefshall he r ° Vld m ^ S aid, piastres to double the number of miri piastres shown in the tariffs the English gold nound remains the Wk ^ , ms ’ e tc- thus H 1936, ' ct ^lafe ^WofJn oftliegli °l ( i pomit the Dijih Scialparitjdi riyal is officially de-valued to a rate approximating tVihat ktwMch it h ? nf ng though with variations, in the market ' h h ^ had fallen &gt; 6.

Maigret plays no important role here. He is a fairly well-informed observer of events but he has not v,sited France for some years and continues to give the impression of having little pu l with the French Government. He has a much greater connexion with Syria and the French authorities there. He has vague leanings towards Islam and is, I think, on the best of terms with King Abdul Aziz and the Saudi Government but even with them he does not apper to carry much weight. I believe that the creation of a Legation and M. Maigret’s promotion are more than anything else the realisation ot his own moderate ambitions and would have taken place sooner but for financial consideration in Paris.

According to the local press there were ten young men in the party of whom four have been sent to the training college for rural school teachers, five to ele mentary schools and one to an intermediate school. 3. Six of them are said to be paying their own expenses, but the others have scholarships provided by the Government of the Yaman. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda and to the Pohtical Resident at Aden.

His Majesty s Minister at Jedda presents his compliments to His Excellency the Viceroy of India (Fore:gn and Political Department), and has the honour to transmit to him, a copy oi v^espatch to the toreign Office, No. 118, dated the 25th April 1936, concerning a member of the Idrisi family, one Seyyid al Arab. Enclosure to Serial No. (31). Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda oe the Foreign Office, No. 118 (765/577/15), dated the 25th April 1936. Yon will remember that at the close of the Saudi Yeman war of 1934, Ibn Sand secured the surrender of Seyyid Hasan Al Idrisi and two other important members of the family Abdul-Wahhab and Abdul-AAz, the latter of whom died last year. A rumour recently reached me that another member of the Idrisi family described by my imformant as “ Seyyid Al-Arab ”, had arrived in Jeddah last February and had been taken to Mecca, where the others are allowed to reside after the Italian Legation here had obtained guarantees for his being well-treated. 2. I was inclined, if there was anything in the story at all, to identify the person in question with Seyyid Mohamad-Al-Arabi, son of Abdul-al, son of the original Ahmed-Al-Idrisi, i.e., one of that branch of the family which is associated principally with the Sadan and Egypt. This man’s submission to Ibn Sand would be of some little importance, as he was one of the Asiri delegation who came to Mecca in October 1930 in connexion with the arrangements for the absorption of Asir into the Ibn Sand’s dominions but was afterwards concerned in the revolt of Seyyid Hasan in November-December 1932. It was understood that, after the coilapse of the rebellion, he went with a nephew of his to Massawa which might account for the alleged Italian interest in him. 3. I took an apportunity to-day of asking Shaykh Yusuf Yasin whether Seyyid Al Arabi had arrived in Mecca. He replied that he had, he thought, been there for a year or so ; any how he had seen him there before he himself left for Riyadh last November. In view of this information, which I have no reason to doubt, it now seems to me probable that my previous informant’s sources were confusing two things, viz., the presence of Al Arabi in Mecca sometime ago and the more recent arrival from Jizan of certain other persons, whom I cannot indentify but who are said to have been landed in Jedda in conditions of some secrecy and conveyed to Mecca. Conflicting rumours have reached me regarding the composition oi this party and the reasons for their being sent here. I am not, however, pursuing this matter, as my object has merely been to locate Al-Arabi for the reason given m the preceding paragraph. 4 I am sending copies of this despatch to his Majesty’s High Commissioner for Egypt Cairo, His Excellency the Governor General of the Sudan, Khartoum, His Majesty’s Chief Commissioner at Aden and to the Government of India m the Foreign and Political Department at New Delhi.

I promised, however, as he attached importance to the principle, though not to the amount involved, to ascertain your views generally, and with special reference to the question whether immunity from the double payment could be claimed in virtue of any recognised practice in cases where a ship lying in a port has occasion to leave it temporarily for a point of the high seas in the vicinity. 5. I at first thought of discussing the matter informally with the Saudi Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs before reporting, it. On finding that the distinction made by the authorities could be plausibly explained as in paragraph 3 above, I decided that I might do more harm than good by approaching Faud Bey. I shall be grateful for an expression of your views on the whole subject. (34) {Received on 16ih May 1936, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 18, dated the 30th April 1936.)

With reference to my despatch No. 57 of February 28th, I have the honour to state that M. Maigret, the French Minister here, is to proceed^ again to Sana on April 16th in the French warship Bougainville, which arrived in Jedda on April 11th, in order to sign the Treaty of Friendship which has been the subject of negotiation for some time past between the French and the Yemeni Govern ments, 2. M. Maigret told me to-day that he had practically completed the negotia tions during his last visit to San’a. At the last moment, however, the Yemeni Minister for Foreign Affairs dropped out of the negotiations for some reason (probably, I think, illness), and the King of the Yemen had appointed another adviser to take his place. This gentleman, wishing to show zeal, took exception to certain phrases, and the negotiations could not be completed. The French Government had now agreed to the amendments desired by the Yemeni Govern* ment and there was no further obstacle to the conclusion of the Treaty. 3. M. Maigret described the Treaty as being a simple and rather anodyne instrument, but I gathered that it contains certain commercial provisions. The most important point outstanding when my French colleague last left the Yemen was apparently the wording of the most-favoured-nation clause. The Yemeni negotiator thought that the definition might be too general, if it provided for most-favoured-nation treatment 4 4 in other matters” as well as in commercial matters. I understood from M. Maigret that the offending words had been either deleted or modified sufficiently to satisfy the Yemeni Government. 4 I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Chief Commissioner at Aden. ) Bsr32ED—25—27.646-^G Jl&gt;SCONFIDENTIAL.

Doubtless you will appreciate the fact, that I prefer to secure an appointment entirely through my own efforts, and would not dream of ap proaching friends for this purpose. If the Foreign Office can assist me in this matter, either officially or otherwise, believe me I should indeed be grateful. Thanking you in advance for your extreme courtesy, and assuring you dear Sir, that an answer whether in the negative or affirmative, will indeed be more than appreciated.

Enclosure in Foreign Office, covering letter, dated 22nd January 1936. Note on Monsieur Khakimov’s 'previous career in Jedda. Kerim Khakimov arrived in Jedda on the 6th August 1924. He is a Tartar from Ufa and a Moslem. He was described by Mr. Consul Bullard as very young for the post (about 31 or 32) but clever and an enthusiastic Communist. He spoke Persian very well, besides Russian, Turkish and Turki and was rapidly learning Arabic and French. After a period of inaction he seems to have indulged in violent anti- British propaganda and lost no opportunity of preaching the mission of the Soviet Union to liberate the East. His activities caused some concern to the authorities in Egypt and the Sudan and His Majesty’s High Com missioner in Cairo suggested that it might be advisable to approach Ibn Baud with a view to the suppression of the Soviet Agency. _ The Acting British Agent however, expressed the view that M. Khakimov s propa- ganda was ineffective, that his drunkenness and general behaviour were such as to warn off all but the most stupid and that it would therefore be inadvisable to act on the High Commissioner’s suggestion. M. Khakimov left Jedda on leave in October 1927. In reporting ms denarture Mr. Consul Stonehewer-Bird stated that it was unlikely that he wmdd return He was unfit to stand the climate and was unable to do anything in moderation.

Letter from H. M.’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 277, DATED THE 8TH OCTOBER 1935. With reference to my despatch No. 227 of the 6th August last [S.

T. P. Darken and D. L. Gibbs &lt; and six Swedes, the latter having engaged, as expert diamond drillers. He informed me shortly after his arrival, that he expects two Americans to join him. within the next few days, and hoped that his machinery would not be long in arriving., 2. Mr. Twitched and his party have taken up their quarters in a house in the “Legation quarter’’ of the town, which he leased just before leaving here last July. He intends to make the premises his head office in this country. 3.

M.’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No^ 344 (2881/147/29), dated the 30th November 1935. In my despatch No. 370 (3200/61/34), of the 11th December, 1934 rs. No. (11)], I had the honour to submit a brief review of the general financial and economic situation in Saudi Arabia. I now propose, after an interval of almost twelve months, to attempt a similar appreciation, necessarily as brief and perhaps as fragmentary as in previous years, in view of the absence of reliable statistics and the lack of authoritative sources of information. 2. Whilst during the previous twelve months, Saudi finances were heavily engaged in meeting and satisfying the demands of the Saudi- Yemen war and its settlement, the period under review may be held to have witnessed the liquidation of the immediate legacies of the conflict and a renewal of the activities of the Minister of Finance, now less pre-occupied with the duties of his second office of Deputy Minister of Defence, to find fresh sources of revenue to repair the seriously deplenished financial re sources of the state. 3. Some relief was afforded early in the year by a further increase in the nmrpber of foreign pilgrims performing the ,Hajj in 1935. Not only did this figure increase from 25,291 in 1934 to 33,898 but an exceptional number of distinguished personages and well-to-do pilgrims visited the Hejaz this year, a matter of some point when the general level of wealth amongst incoming pilgrims has fallen so markedly in these lean years. The beneficent effects of the increase brought comfort to all classes in the Fle.jaz, but complaints were not wanting that the Government had appro priated to themselves the lion’s share of the pilgrimage harvest, and dis tress, even amongst merchants, motor-car proprietors and pilgrim-guides, all of whom might have been expected to have benefitted most by a larger pilgrimage, was only partially alleviated. Certain foreign companies in Jedda, however, had a more satisfactory year,, upon completing their accounts after the Hajj, both Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey &amp; Co. (Sudan) Ltd. and Messrs. Sharcpeh, Ltd., being able to record some improvement, the latter having achieved a reasonably good profit albeit, according to Mr. Philby. a 1 - paper' ’' one. j 4. Customs receipts form the other main item of Saudi revenue, and during the twelve months under review, these, although no official figures are available, may be expected to have risen in sympathy with the increase in the numbers of pilgrims. Other sources of revenue are of subordinate importance; concessions have not yet commenced to yield steady revenue for operations by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company for the pro duction of oil in Hasa though promising, have not yet been completely suc cessful, and gold-mining operations by the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndi cate upon which I have reported separately, have not yet reached the pro duction stage, though here also there are believed to be grounds for opti mism. As statistics of any description are, in the absence of official figures Df some interest I give for what they are worth estimates, given in53 Egyptian newspaper “A1 Mnqattani’ 5 and reproduced m the “Oriente Moderno of May, 1935, of the revenues of the Hejaz for “this •year ,, - (presuinably a period ending after the 1935 pilgrimage).; £300,000 gold—from pilgrimage. £2003)00 gold—from Customs receipts. £100.000 gold—from other sources. £600,000 Total. | - ; : 5. General trading conditions may be said to-have shown some impro vement during the period under review. Chiefly owing to the larger pil grimage there have been increased clearances through Customs and a some what better tone in the market. This unfortunately does not mean that conditions can be described as satisfactory, but the tendency is encouraging. Protests were again evoked during the year by the practice of the Gov ernment of importing goods, particularly ride, through one importing firm, Messrs, llaji Abdullah Alireza &amp; Co., to the detriment of others, with the result that some small redistribution of favours was effected to soothe the malcontents. The system adopted by the Saudi Arab Govern ment of settling their local indebtedness by allowing rebates of Customs dues on goods imported was maintained through the year, although in its early months the Government appeared disposed to abandon it. Adverse comment, and perhaps a realisation of the convenience of the system to the authorities themselves, led to a continuance of this practice. Prom one source it is gathered that the total number of packages to enter through the port of Jedda during the past 12 months was 620,000, of which some 120,000 were for the Saudi Arab Government or foreign diplomatic mis sions, and hence duty free. 6. Exports continued to be negligible (they were estimated m March last, for the previous twelve months at about eight thousand pounds gold), but mav be expected during recent days to have received a fillip from the reported purchase of camels from this country by the Italians for purposes connected with the war in Abyssinia, a subject on which separate reports have been submitted. About one thousand camels are said to have been shipped from Yanbu’, though confirmation is still awaited, and the price paid is generally believed to be in the neighbourhood of £15 gold per camel. 7 The visible adverse balance of trade is therefore heavy and has been estimated locally by a confidential but well-informed source | 8 about £1,261,000 gold for the year 1351 A. H. and £981,000 gold for 135- A. H. ’ 8.

Haji Abdullah Alireza, for 'the account of the Saudi Arab Gov ernment, between May and November inclusive, of Rupees 1,630,000; and a further consignment of Rupees 400,000 is shortly expected. The reason advanced is that the Rupee is a more convenient coin for use in Nejd than the Maria Theresa dollar, and a more popular one with Ihe tribes than the Saudi riyal. 12. Generally, therefore, it may be said that the tendency to improve ment. was maintained throughout the year. Prices of foodstuffs have fluc tuated, in the autumn, under the influences of the uncertainty created ,by the Italo-Abyssinian situation, but the Government took certain steps to restore the position and it is claimed, though with doubtful accuracy, that prices have on the whole returned to normal. Distress is still unfortunately all too prevalent, especially in the city of Medina, but has again been mitigated by charity from a variety of foreign sources. 13.

The Resident has ascertained that the King of the Yemen has im posed restrictions on the emigration of Jews from the Yemen to Palestine through Aden and by any other route. 3. The Resident states that the Yemeni Government had previously discouraged emigration to Palestine by the confiscation of property in the Yemen belonging to the emigrants, but no penalties were inflicted on their relatives who remained in the Yemen. When it was realised that the majority of the Yemeni Jews who left for Aden were bound for Palestine the Yemeni authorities decided to prevent the emigration of Jews to any foreign place, and new restrictions were made some months ago to effect this purpose. 4. If a Jew now wishes to leave the Yemen to do business in Aden or elsewhere he is required to produce a surety for his return witout which he is not allowed to proceed. Certain restrictions have also been imposed on the movements of Jews from place to place in the interior of the Yemen.

Enclosure 1 to S. No. (52). (Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 9th August 1935.) Minute.\ Lord Castlestewart called this morning. Mr. Ward was also present at the interview. . ‘ ,, a After o-iving me the necessary particulars regarding his Syndicates concession, Lord' Castlestewart began by explaining that the Saudi Govern- ment had asked the Syndicate for a loan of one million silver rivals to be minted bv the Syndicate. His views on this point and the enquiries he made in connexion with it are recorded^ in the attached draft telegram, which I agreed to send, at the Syndicate s expense. Lord Castlestewart then discussed the general position. The gist of his enquiries was verv much as we had expected, his main point being an enquiry whether His Majesty’s Government might not think it worth their while to give some kind of financial assistance to Saudi Arabia, wi a view to maintaining the present regime in power, since, if they did not cio so, other countries such as Italy might well take the opportunity of getting a finger in the pie and might then, if Ibn Sand’s regime should eventually collapse, find an excuse for political intervention in Arabia more parti cularly as the mining concessions which his Syndicate had obtained weie certainly of verv considerable value. Lord Castlestewart^ also wished o know whether there might not be some possibility of securing the appoint ment of a British Financial Adviser, or of getting some arrangement with Saudi Arabia by which the Saudi customs receipts should be assigned as security for a loan. He asked for any general information we could gwe him. I told Lord Castlestewart that we were on excellent terms with San i Arabia and had, generally speaking, a high opinion of King Ibn baud, who had done a great deal for his country and was much more direc his methods and satisfactory to deal with than the great majority oi niers in the East. At the same time, the country was organised on an extreme y primitive basis and was exceedingly poor. It had no real budget and live very much from hand to mouth, chiefly on the pilgrimage and on grazing taxes, the collection of which was farmed out to local governors. I ^ not hazard any prophecy as to what might happen on the death of Ling Ibn Sand 1 , particularly as he had comparatively few reliable officials, bd Saudi Arabia was in definite treaty relations with a large number of coun tries and with all her neighbours, and I doubted whether there was any real danger of any European Power attempting adventures there in the circum stances. Like other countries in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia was intensely nationalist and jealous of her independence, and it was most im probable that Ibn Sand would consent in any circumstances whatever o assign any revenues as security for a foreign loan. The assignment oirevenues for foreign loans was generally regarded iVia i? . , UZK&amp;!z£2i£X£ ence. This applied also to some extent to the suggestion for a Financial Adviser It was most unlikely that Bn Saud would! accept a foreign Financial Adviser with any real powers. As to the attitude of His Majesty s Government, it was their policy to keep on good terms with Saudi Arabia and to do what they could to help Bn Saud when occasion arose But: I could say quite definitely that the Treasury would never look at any thing like financial assistance. If there was to be any question of financial assistance, it must therefore, be on a purely commercial basis and it was for the private interests concerned to decide whether it was worth their while to run the obviously serious financial risks involved. Nor would it help Ibn Saud to maintain his position if he had to rely on oui, or on any other foreign assistance. We had some further conversation on the above lines, and I think Lord Castlestewart realised that we could not commit ourselves in any way or give him any kind of lead. Indeed, I doubt whether he really expected us to do so. Meanwhile, I promised to send off the attached telegram and told Lord Castelstewart that the department would let him hear further (as I hoped myself to be away on leave), as soon as we received Mr. Calvert’s reply.

Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to His Excel lency the High Commissioner for Palestine, No. 861/282/9 d\ted the 4th April 1935. 1 ’ With reference to my despatch No. 819/282/5 of March 29th last, re garding the remarks about Palestine, which Ibn Saud made during an interview granted to journalists after the recent attempt on his life I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that my attention has been drawn to the fact that a pamphlet, produced by the Association for the protection of “A1 Masjid-ul-Aqsa” and the Holy Places in Jerusalem and dated the 15th Hhu 1 Qa da, 1353 (February 19th), has been distributed in Mecca during the pilgrimage. I presume that this pamphlet has already been brought to Your Excellency’s notice but it may be useful to indicate the general nature of its contents, if only for purposes of identification. 2. The pamphlet begins, after the usual invocation, with a glorifica tion of the Mosque of Omar and declares that the Arabs of Palestine, who have been appointed by God as guardians of this shrine, feel it their duty to appeal to the Moslems of the whole world and warn them of the danger to the sanctuary and the country from the Jews. The latter, having been promised a national home in Palestine, have openly proclaimed their inten tion of seizing the Mosque of Omar, which they allege is “the Jewish temple’ ’. 3. Then follow various pronouncements by the Jewish leaders and instances of propaganda by newspaper and by picture. The growing menace to the Arabs of the acquisition of land by Jews, the increase of the Jewish population and the steady flow of immigrants from all parts ot the world is emphasised. 4 The Moslem counter-efforts are related, including a large meeting in the Mosque of Omar which resulted in the issue of a “Fatwa forbidding the sale of land to Jews and' enjoining the boycott of all who participate in such sales. This “Fatwa” was confirmed by Ulama m Egypt, Iraq, India Morocco and other countries. s’. The pamphlet ends with an appeal foi general Moslem co-operation StabHshment^of'a^Jewish stTte in M^^hrCbs^a^tine mosque and to loly^Td 'thmrObject will, with the help of God, be achieved. ^ ^ of this d e S patch to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs., Piincipal (54) f ' ,7 ' Y/fh Member 1935 with Political Secretary’s letter No. 35, icetved on 14th September^ ^ Augmt le35 ) in Fomign 0««. covering »*, »»» Office to Lord Castlestewart, No. P, % - ITER FROM THE 13tH AUGUST 1935. In Mr. Rondel’s absence on leav^ I wnte ^^y^kgrU which o of silver riyals.42 9 Mr Calvert thinks that there must be in fact a shortage of silver minate and he quotes as evidence of this the importation by the Saudi Government of 400,000 Indian rupees last May, and further importations of silver rupees which have apparently taken place since then. o Mr ralvei t reports that there has been keen appreciation of the .silver rival recently. As you know, the Saudi Government attempted at one timeto maintain an artificial rate of 10 rivals to one gold pound, but the rate steadily depreciated, until at the end of 1933 it was over 24 rivals to the gold pound: The following figures show, however, the appreciation which has taken place this year in the selling rates of exchange for rivals to the gold pound! { 1st April—Riyals 21. 1st May—Riyals 20^. 1st June—Riyals 20. 30th June—Rivals 17, 18. 4. In terms of Egyptian pounds the riyal rate apparently rose after the Pilgrimage to 11, and then fox one day to 8£, falling subsequently to jlO rivals 8 piastres, and then steadying to 10 riyals, 1 piastre at the end of July where it still remains. This is the more remarkable as the rate normally falls after the Pilgrimage below the usual figure of 14-15 riyals to the Eygptian pound. 5. When attention was first drawn to the steady appreciation in the vaule of riyals, observers were uncertain as to the exact cause behind it, but it now 'looks as though the main influence might in fact be a shortage of silver coinage. Mr. Calvert reports, however, that the reasons for this shortage are obscure. He has not heard any stories of the export of silver coinage and he finds it difficult to believe rumours of hoarding of coinage for sale at a profit during the next pilgrimage. The rates for Saudi cur rency normally rise when the pilgrimage season begins, but do not generally do so for other reasons before then. 6. As Mr. Rendel mentioned in the course of your interview with him on 7th August, we are obliged by our standing instructions to ask you to be so good as to refund the cost of the telegram despatched at your request to Jedda, and of the reply thereto, and our Finance Department will in due course send you the customary official request for repayment.

The extensive workings and the large area covered by ruined build- ino-s show that a great number of workmen were employed in those times. Mr. Twitched is now seeking to prove that the workings were not exhausted of their gold, but were abandoned either through the lack of engineering equipment and the knowledge how to mine deeper, or through the failure of the water-supply or from political reasons. 6. Mr. Twitched has been working at this mine himself and says he is very gratified with the results so far obtained in the mining of gold. There' are, I believe, also subsidiary metals. _ He foreshadowed early developments and hoped to start diamond drilling, the machinery for which was on its way. Mr. Twitched is, however, faced with many pro blems. I am not competent to judge the scheme from a technical mining point of view, but engineering problems may well be small compared with other factors such as the supply of water and communications with Medina and the coast. 7. Mr. Twitched confessed to me in conversation that the water supply was indeed a problem and said it might be necessary to sink a well. At present water is found in the surrounding-districts at Maden (3 kilom.), Jiraisiya (10 kilom.), and Suwaijiya (50 kilom.), while at the mine itself Mi. Twitched has discovered a shaft containing water, estimated at about 7,000 gallons, which he intends to reserve for use in connexion with the diamond drilling. 8. With his usual energy and with Mr. van de Pod’s local knowledge in support, Mr. Twitched has set to work to solve the problem of communi cations. Mahd-adh-Dhahab lies, as the crow flies, some 100 miles from Medina and 240 from Jedda. The original plan was to use Yanbu as a base, being only 200 miles from the mine, but during these four months the road has been found very difficult. Non-Moslems have to leave the beaten track from Yanbu to Medina and circle the forbidden area to the north, making the road distance about 315 miles, and mostly over abomi nable ground of Harat lava, where in the winter the trucks were once or twice held up by rain floods. This combined with the abandonment of the workings at Yanbu-an-Nakhl have induced the syndicate to consider the possibility of a load from Jedda, which will be a little longer than the Yanbu road, and which would give the advantages of quicker external communication through the larger port. They are accordingly now occu pied m prospecting three alternate routes:—' (1) Jedda-Asfan-Al Birka-Mahd-adh-Dhahab. (2) Jedda-Rabigh-Madh-adh-Dhahab.

As you are aware Ibn Saud makes it his annual practice to give a great banquet in Mecca for notable pilgrims of all nations just before the Pilgrimage. I find that I sent no separate report on this event last year but I included some account of it in my despatch No. 88 of March 31st, 1934, on the Saudi Yemen situation. This year the occasion merits separate treatment. 2. This year’s pilgrimage has brought to the Hejaz an unusually large number of Moslems of high standing and a good many politicians of less note but of some importance in their own countries. The former have included cr-King Amanullah of Afghanistan ; His Highness the Nawa.b of Bahawalpur ; the chief Begum of His Exalted Highness the Nizam ot Hyderabad, with Sii Nizamat Jung in attendance ; another Begum of the ^Hyderabad family ; tne Glawi from Morocco ; Abdullah Ibn Wazir, the Governor of Hudayda, who was here last year as Yemeni delegate at the peace negotiations ; Nawa'b Sir f mar Hayat Khan, honorary A.-D.-C. to His Majesty the King ; and a brother of the Sheykh of Dibai. 3. Most of the male personages just mentioned were among the five hundred guests or so, whom the King entertained on the evening of March 12th As tlie King had arrived only on March 10th, the arrangements were made hurriedly. Among the absentees were the Nawab of Bahawalpur, who pleaded il ness, an Sir Umar Hayat Khan, the reasons! for whose non-appearance I do not know The Nawab may have been worried about questions of precedence but members of his suite attended the dinner. The King had er-King Amanullah on his ng , with Sayyid Hasan A1 Idrisi and, I believe, the Glawi beyond. The second place of honour on his left was given very significantly to Abdullah At W azir. 4 The King’s principal speech was reproduced, as usual m the Umm-ab Qura probably fn an edited version The published version- md worth sub- mitting to you in full but. a few points may be noted. began with ms customary exhortations and insistence on the importance of close adherence t Modem tenets, especially the doctrine the Unity He and were Bedmns, possessing nought except the blessing of God and des g P and re f e r- Arabs and Moslems.

If they respected themselves, co-operatel ancf followed the right path they would succeed. 5 Bat-Kino- Amanullah delivered a speech which wps also reported in the TTmmal-Oura but in a very anodyne form. _ The published version contains no mentimi of his two principal points m trying to make which he dropped t,vo bricks He urged the desirability of general Moslem conferences a pilgnmage time and boggled when his remarks were coldly received. Yon will remember hat Ibn Sand convened such a conference in 192? and has never repeated the mnharrassim- experiment. Amanullah Khan’s other point was that traffic in s ave was ah wrong and should he abolished in Saudi Arabia. The moment was clearly ill-chosen for the expression of this sentiment, so admirable m itself, and means were found lo silence the orator. 6 There were I understand numerous other speeches including one by a speaker whom 1 have not identified, who applauded' the present regime in Afghanistan. The only orators named in the official report, besides the King and Amanuliah Khan were Muhammad A1 Ghuneyim A1 Taftazani and a certain Muhammad Sadiq al Mujahid. The letter I take to be the adversary of Ibn Sand on whom His Majesty’s Government have long had their eye but who recently returned to this country mider the terms of the recent so-called amnesty. Al Taftazani belongs to a family df some Religious consequence in Egypt, who claim descent from the Prophet. His importance lies in the fact that in the past he has been a violent critic of Ibn Sand, especially, if I remember rightly, but I have not verified this, at the time of the Idrisi revolt in Asir in 1932. He is understood to have praised the King highly in his speech at the dinner. The sincerity of these conversions may be doubted, but the lip-service of such former enemies shows how greatly the events of last year ,have enhanced Ibn Baud’s credit in outer Moslem and Arab circles. 7 . I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India, Aden and Cairo. I have the honour to be with the highest respect. (28) MEMORANDUM.

With reference to my despatch No. 4 of the 7th January [Serial No. (24)], I have the honour to state that the text of the agreement between the Saudi Gov ernment and the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited) was published in the Umm-al-Qura of the 15th February, together with a Royal decree dated the 12th February sanctioning the agreement. It may 1 be assumed that the syndicate had already ratified it. 2 The agreement is a fairly lengthy document, and T consider it unnecessary to trouble von with all the details. I enclose a synopsis showing the principal conditions.' In the absence of the annexed map it is difficult to trace the exact boundaries of the assigned area on the south and east, but a very fair idea of them can be formed with the aid of the ordinary maps and the Handbook for Arnhin You will observe that the northern boundary is the de facto tiontiei between the Hejaz and Transjordan, starting from “ Point E ”, the position of which is defined as in the Hadda Agreement. n Mr Twiteh.'H dulv visited Egypt and Syria as foreshadowed m my desnatch under reference'and travelled as far east as Rutha, whence he went to see the alleged gold mine at Gaara.

Letter from the Resident, Aden, to the Colonial Office, No. 45, dated the 13th February 1935. I have the honour to refer to your confidential despatch of the 9th January 1935 [Serial No. (7)], regarding certain restrictions alleged to have been imposed by the King of the Yemen on his Jewish subjects, who wish to leave for Aden or elsewhere. I am making enquiries on this subject, and shall communicate the result to you in due course. 2. As regards paragraph 2 of the despatch under reference, I enclose, for your information, a copy of this office despatch No. C.-641 of the 18th July 1934 to the Director, Department of Immigration, Palestine. It will be seen that the restriction imposed is aimed at preventing an influx of indigent Yemeni Jews into the Aden Settlement as they constitute a possible menace to public health owing to overcrowding. 3 . Before the restriction was imposed I consulted Mr. Selim Menahem Messa, Head of the J ewish Community in Aden, who was in favour of restriction. 4. No restrictions have been imposed on the entry into Aden of, Jews of sufficient means, and careful arrangements have been made to ensure that no legitimate traders are hindered in any way. The system whereby the Yemeni Jewish population in Aden is' kept in the neighbourhood of 500 is, at present, working satisfactorily. Inclosure 1 to Serial No., (33). ,etter from the Chief Commissioner, Aden, to the Director, Department of Immigration, Palestine, No. C.-641, dated the 18th July 19H. I have the honour to state that Yemeni Jews numbering about 890 have rrived in Aden, and 640 during the past few months are still awaiting emigia- on to Palestine. Most of these families are indigent. As the limited natation a^ our disposal has been overcrowded to the danger of the genC|a ealth of the public, I am unable to permit further immigration into the . x en U56FD29 Under cover of onr letter No. 37976|34 of the 9th January, we sent vou a copy of our despatch to the Resident at Aden [Serial No. (7)], regardin''' the alleged, persecution of Jews in the Yemen, and I now enclose for your informa tion a copy of an interim reply [Serial No. (33) ], from Sir Bernard Reilly on the subject. Subject to your concurrence we are disposed to think that it would be better not to say anything further to Colonel Wedgwood until we have learned the result of the Resident’s enquiries. The information in paragraphs 2 to 4 of the despatch regarding the restric tions placed on the entry of Yemeni Jews into Aden is meant for our information only. We do not propose to mention the matter to the Joint Foreign Committee unless they themselves raise the question. Enclosure 3 to Serial No. (33).

I presume that foreign nationals residing in the Yemen and their children born in the Yemen do not lose their foreign nationality save by their own act, in the absence of specific Yemeni law in that respect. This question has, as far as I know, never been tested. (c) The Imam appears to be reluctant to allow his Jewish subjects to emigrate. _ If the prospective emigrant is poor and owns no pro perty he is obliged to provide a surety against his return ; if he owns property he must transfer it to administration by the Imam and can recover it on his return to the country. There*is a special department in San’a for the administration of such trust estates. (d) The Jewish subjects of the Imam between the ages of 13 aiid 60, and male, pay a poll tax annually. The tax is assessed in three grades, of M. T. dollars 4, 2 or 1, in accordance with the financial status of the^ tax-payer. No other direct tax is levied on Jews. Customs, duties are levied irrespective of race or creed. (e) There is a Rabbinical Court in San’a with jurisdiction in disputes between Jews, but such cases may also be heard by a Moslem Qadhi specially appointed for the purpose. “ Mixed ” cases go to the Shar’ia Court, where however (I am informed) Jewish evidence against a Moslem is not accepted. (/) Jews in the Yemen are permitted to manufacture and consume “ arak ” and wine in Jewish quarters, but are prohibited from selling or distributing such liquor to Moslems. (In this connection cf. Aden Political Intelligence Summary, paragraph 1858.) (g) Jewish children, having no parents or other relations and no means of support, are collected and absorbed into the Moslem Orphanage in San’a where they grow up as Moslems without distinction from their fellow orphans. I do not know the method of their conversion nor at what stage it is effected. And although there was at one time a good deal of talk about it in Jewish circles here, I do not think that ,the system, objectionable as it must be to Jewish susceptibilities, has been accompanied by undue compulsion or deliberate disregard of evidence. (Ji) Jews in the Yemen are subject to certain traditional disabilities 1 elat ing to the wearing of silken garments (except on holidays in their own quarters) ; the riding of horses, or of mules and asses except on journeys, and then only sideways ; and to behaviour when pass ing or accompanying Moslems. I am under the general impression that the life of Jews in the Yemen, vhile it is subject to many disabilities and prohibitions, which, however repugnant to the more enlightened of them and to western ideas, have long been established b7 tradition Sid custom, is not unhappy and need not ^ ™ = erou S . The present Imam is tolerant to them and lends a ready ear to their complaints. Crown Prince ’’ Seif A1 Islam Ahmed, may be less so when he succeeds, but they have friends among the other Princes. Most of the foregoing is irrelevant to yqur question, and much o it ma\ k old news, but I send it to you for what it is worth.Enclosure 5 to Serial No. (33).

With reference to Sir A. Ryan’s despatch No. 75 of March llth, 1935, relative to Saucf-Egyptian relations, I have the honour to report that the Saudi Arab Agent in Cairo (Sheikh Fawzan El Sabek) has recently been included in the list of persons receiving customs franchise in Egypt and authorised to obtain supplies of duty free petrol. These concessions, which have been the subject of official correspondence between the Saudi-Arab Agency and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, explain the article in the “ Saut-al-Hejaz ” news paper quoted by Sir A. Ryan, but they do not, of course, connote the full recogni tion suggested by the Egyptian journalist. 2 . 1 am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister, Jeddah.

M.’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 80, dated the 18th March 1935. With reference to my despatch No. 56 of the 24th February [Serial No. (31)], relative to the concession recently granted by the Saudi Government to the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited), I have the honour to state that the Royal decree sanctioning the concession referred to an agreement and contract as having been sigrred by the Minister of Finance and the representative of the syndicate. It now appears that these were two separate instruments as, after the agreement summarised in the enclosure to my despatch under reference had been published, the Umm-al-Qura proceeded to publish, in instalments, an even lengthier document described as a contract concluded on the same date as tlie mam agreement. 2 . Although the further document is described as above, it is clear from internal evidence that it is a form of mining lease for fifty-eight years, in respect o areas to be finally selected for definite mining operations in accordance with r 1 !? .V+i e mam a g re 9 me nt. The procedure contemplated would appear to ufvi e Government will lease these areas to the syndicate on the conditions rf«m 5 c 0 7 n 111 contract ”, and that the syndicate will form subsidiary com- f ri II 0 )' 01 c ^ ie ^dividual properties. As the general conditions are stated u nSi^nrnnt, I do not think it necessary to report at length on the mi f . ’ e, detailed stipulations of which appear to follow normal lines- the following points, however, may be noted : (a) Ihe Government are to receive during the period of the lease a rent of p P er eddan of the leased area plus the excess, if any, of 5 per cent, of the product of the mine over the rental so fixed. rrh I 3 li al ? rran g en f nt for payment of customs duty on imported the period c7 the lease ° f 10 P6r Cent WiU 0pera ‘ e tllr0US10U(c) The Government are not only to receive eratit? 1 -nor ^ i-l capital of the eventual subsidiary companies, fully paid'up but*they are to have the right to nominate a director to serve on the’ board of -40^^’ the t0tal member ^ lll P of which shall not exceed six 3 I am sending copies of this despatch to the Principal Secretary of Ship tbf f AffairS m Overseas Trad^ an^nL Lceneucy the High Commissioner for Transjordan at Jerusalem. ‘ • (36) Memorandum from His Majesty's Minister at Jedda, No. 64 (1097i282ll91 datfo SOtii ^AprilH^S tkansmitting Foreign Office despatch No. 128 of Enclosure to Serial No. (36).

Siace writing my despatch No. 861128219 of April 4th, to the High Commis sioner for Palestine, a copy of which was enclosed in my printed despatch No. 106 of the same date to the Foreign Office, I have received from the Deputy Inspector General of the C. I. D., Jerusalem, an English version of a long memo randum in Arabic regarding the alleged machinations of the Jews in Palestine, with a request for information as to its circulation here and its probable effects in Moslem circles. In my reply to the Deputy Inspector General, sent under flying seal via the High Commissioner, I drew his attention to the despatch referred to above and said that the Arabic pamphlet circulated in Mecca appeared to be a shorter version of that which had come to his notice in Palestine. 2 . After I had written to the Deputy Inspector General I had brought to my notice a large collection of other pamphlets in Arabic, which would appear to have been circulated in Mecca this year. I am unable to forward the texts of these but the following list of titles may be of interest :— ( 1 ) The Statutes, etc., of the Moslem Congress, published in Jerusalem, 19 pages, no date. (2) The decisions of the Congress held in 1931, published in Jerusalem, 27 pages, no date. (3) Proclamation to all our Moslem brethren, published in Jerusalem, 1347 (1928), 11 pages.

(9) The Black-Red Atrocities or Civilization by fire and sword, published in Damascus in 1931, 115 pages. 3 . Although several of these publications are not new, it is significant that all or most of them appear to have been brought to the Hejaz this year for distribution to pilgrims. In this connexion I would refer to the accouifl guei t mv despatch No. 114 of April 13th, of my conversation with I uad Bey Hamza on the exploitation of the pilgrimage for purposes of political propaganda am o Fuad Bey’s reaction to my remarks. 4 Further efforts have been made to obtain a copy of the 'alleged Lnra u version of the anti-Jewish pamphlet, which I mentioned m my conversation with (7) (8)33 ’ , v. ,v, C iiPnP«Rful and I am inclined to accept Fuad Bev’s 'i'„ ri ss56rrs»v a »- ’ statement ’ _ . f ^ eg p a tch to His Excellency the Viceroy of r lia For“4 e and PolUical Department and to His Excellency the High Com- missioner tor Palestine at Jerusalem.

You may be glad to know that the Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, the Saudi Arabian Minister in London, intends to spend about a week in Baghdad on his way to Saudi Arabia on leave. We cannot say exactly when he will be in Baghdad, but he told Rendel lie was leaving London on the 3rd December and would travel via Palestine to Baghdad, leaving Alexandria by rail on the 24th December. From Baghdad he is going to Koweit, where he hopes to see Colonel Dickson, and from Koweit he will go to Riyadh. (Copy sent to India, Bushire and Koweit.)

The tone of the Saudi note, it will be observed, is stiff and a definite under stand irg regarding incidents of this nature is regarded by the Saudi Arab Govern ment as essential. That some hardening in their attitude was to be expected was foreshadowed by Sir Andrew Ryan in his despatch No. 206 of the 3 rd July last [endorsement to Serial No. ( 6 ) in File No. 7 -N/ 34 )] and in an instance of this sort, ^® ns ^ era ^ ) ^ e de lay supervened before the incident was brought to the notice of H.

Arrived and anchored at 1030 on 22 nd October. The Commanding Officer called on the Wazir, Salem Ahmed Alkoati, His Highness the Sultan having sailed for India some ten days previously. The Wazir, who has only held the post for nine months (i.e., subsequent to the last visit of a Red Sea Sloop in January 1934), is dull and unprepossessing in comparison with his predecessor. He returned the visit at 1530 on the same day, and was accorded a salute of 11 guns on his departure. 14. Business in the town appears to be flourishing ; the bazaar is full and active, while the inhabitants present a remarkably cheerful and well-fed appear ance, the latter in marked contrast to that observed in most South Arabian ports. It is understood tha ! ; the construction of the motor road to the Hadramaut, referred to in previous Reports of Proceedings, has made little, if any, progress in the mountain districts. 15. On the 23rd I visited the English School, by the invitation of the Indian Schoolmaster, Ibrahim Soogan, who for many years had taught in the Danish Mission School in The Crater, Aden. The school, which was established some 6 months ago by the Sultan, is row attended three times weekly by about 60 boys, ranging in age from 8 to 16 years, of whom a third are Indians. After the inspection of the Guard of Boy Scouts, an Address of Welcome w as read by the senior student, and was followed by a demonstration of the principal subjects of instruction. Proceedings terminated by the singing, with much zest, of the National Anthem, first in English and then in Arabic. In a short speech I congratulated the Schoolmaster and his pupils on the results achieved in so short a time, and laid emphasis on the great value and universal appeal of the Boy Scouts’ Movement. In the evening the Schoolmaster and nine of the senior Scouts came on board and were shown round the ship. 16. It had been arranged with the Chief C mmissioner that a short visit should be paid to Bal Haf while on passage to Aden (Bir Ali was not included, as the Sheikk is at present in bad odour), but on the receipt of instructions (Admiralty message timed 1416/20) that Their Lordships were to be kept informed of the details of the reception ceremonies proposed for the forthcoming visit of His Majesty the King of Italy to Aden, it became necessary to allow a larger margin of time for consult ing the Chief Commissioner and transmitting the required intelligence. With his concurrence, Bal Haf was therefore omitted from the programme, and &lt;£ Pen* zance ” sailed at 0415 on the 24th for Aden direct, arriving at 0700 on the following day. (Extract.)

The forthcoming visit of H. M T.e King of Italy was immediately dis cs^ with the Chief Commissioner, when it was found that some uncertainty prevailed as to the poacy whi h should be adopted for his reception. On the one hand a telegram from the Secretary of State for India 1 N 0 2455— the equivalent of A miralty message timed 1416/20) indicated the pleasured His Britannic Majesty to be that full honours and compliments should be rendered whether His Majesty was travelling incognito or otherwise, provided that his Standard was flying, while a further message v No. 2484) stated that such would be the case. On the other hand, the Italian Consul had received information that the Stand' ard would not be flown, and that His Majesty desired to land privately. He wa» therefore requested to obtain confirmation of this fact, pointing out that it was at variance with the information received from London,, and to st te that should the Standard not be flown, no royal honours would be accorded (“ Penzance’s ” message timed 2132/25.) 18. On the following day (26th) the Secretary of State informed the Chief Commissioner (telegram No. 2521) that no notification had been received of any change in the King’s plans. Further passages in the message were taken to indicate that the intimation that the Standard would be flown had originated from His Majesty and had been accompanied by a personal letter of thanks to His Britannic Majesty. This message was followed and reinforced on 27th by a further one (No. 2537), stating that information from His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy at Rome was to the effect that Italian officials stated that it was His Majesty’s invariable practice to fly his Standard, and that, in their opinion, the Italian Consul had been misin formed. It was conside ed by the Embassy that Italian wishes would be met by the reception of His Majesty with a gun salute, and that, as he wished his visit to he private, he should be spared all unnecessary ceremony ashore, other than the parading of a Guard of Honour. On the same day, however, the Consul obtained a positive statement from the Royal Yacht that the Standard would not be flown. As this was in answer to the enquiries referred to in paragraph 17, it was held to constitute a clear indication that His Majesty did not desire to be received with any ceremony, and the Consul was therefore asked to state that in deference to these wishes honours would not be rendered. The main situation thus appeared to be clear, and was reported in my message timed 1237/27. 19. A minor complication, however, arose from the fact that at a Residency Meeting that evening (27th) the Consul announced that the escorting cruiser “ Gorizia ” was flying the flag of Admiral of Division Conte Luigi Miragha In the absence of the Royal Standard it appeared to me evident that lus Hag should, be saluted by “ Penzance ”, although the presence of His Majesty, admittedl&gt; in a private capacity, made such a procedure appear somew a i 0 8 ' ca ^ what I take to be the strict interpretation of the situation mz., that in the absence of the Standard, His Majesty was not, from a ceremonial aspect, present yacht, was constantly borne in mind. The Consul was therefore asked to ascertain the wishes of the^ Rear Admiral as regards the marks of respect to be paid to him and I repor e message timed 0107/28, receiving in reply Admiralty message 135 / . 20 . On the evening of the 28th I was summoned to a f Residency at which the Chief Commissioner quoted ree 2554). These ed during that day from the Secretary of State (Nos. 2 ’ ^ j would not p e were to the effect that the earlier reports that the f^kBritannic Majesty’s flown has caused considerable surprise in London an a • • a personal inter- Embassy at Rome had notified that the Master o ere ™ n ’ pq s Standard and view, had again emphasised that His Majesty invariably flew Ks ^ d . would expect gun salutes, and, if he landed, a Guard of Honour, non ing that his visit was of a private nature. MS89FD6 21. Influenced by these repeated expressions of the opinions held by London and Rome as to His Majesty’s wishes, and taking into account the complication referred to in paragraph 19 (particularly as regards its effect on the large native population of Aden who, being unable to appreciate the circumstances of an un official visit, would regard the omission of Royal Honours as most unusual), it was decided that full compliments should be paid, it being held that in the un usual circumstances of a Sovereign paying a visit to a foreign military port of a status such as that of Aden, without flying his Standard although under naval escort, an excess of ceremony was to be preferred to a deficiency. In his advance message of welcome which he sent that evening, Sir Bernard Reilly therefore stated his desire to render the usual honours on the arrival of the Yacht, unless the King desired to the contrary, to which His Majesty replied with an expression of thanks. Apart from the fact that it was evidently impossible for His Majesty’s Ship under my command not to fire a Royal Salute when the military forces were render ing this honour, but instead to salute the flag of the Rear Admiral, I myself con curred in the decision recorded above. The rendering of other naval honours, in my opinion, followed as a necessary corollary, and arrangements were therefore made to dress ship, man ship, and cheer. It will be appreciated that these decisions taken only a few hours before the expected arrival of His Majesty could not under the circumstances be submitted to Their Lordships for prior approval. Monday, 29th October. 22 . H. M. S. “ Penzance ”, the military signal stations and merchant vessels in port dressed ship overall at 0800. On approaching the Fairway Buoy “ Gorizia ” saluted the Country, which was returned by the Marbut Battery. The Royal Yacht “ Savoia ”, followed by “ Gorizia ” entered the Inner Harbour at 1330, when a Royal Salute, synchronised by Y/S signals, was fired by “ Penzance ” and the shore battery. On the near approach of “ Savoia ”, “ Penzance ” manned ship, rendered military honours and cheered ship. Savoia proceeded to No. 4 buoy, head west, and was thus in close proxi mity to “ Penzance ” (No. 2 buoy, head east), while “ Gorizia ” proceeded to No. 2 fuelling berth, military honours being paid by “ Penzance ” as she passed. The Royal Standard was not flying, neither was it hoisted at any time through- out the visit. As far as could be seen, no marks fof respect were rendered by Gorizia when passing the Yacht, ^either on entering harbour or on departure. n The Chief Commissioner, flying his Flag and accompanied by Group Captain C. F. A. Portal, D. S. 0. M. C. (Officer Commanding British Forces), proceeded at once on board “ Savoia ” to offer his respects and welcome to His Majesty. r xr iv/r ^ lr Bernard Reilly, the Group Captain, Lieutenant-Colonel, * rr McAje od (Commanding British Troops) and the Aide de Camp had the honour o inmg with His Majesty; these invitations had been issued by the Consul. , 2 y Be fore tie operation of securing was completed the Officer of the Guard from Uorizia called on me (having passed “ Penzance’s ” Officer of the Guard between the two ships) and presented a request from Rear Ad mi ral Conte Luigi Miraglia that in view of the short duration of the stay I should refrain from call- mg on him. 25.

Here His mIj Ay displayed his remarkable memory when on being informed of the regiments in Affich certain members of the staff had fought during the Great War, he recalled in many instances the names of the Commanding Officers. J The Settlements Gardens at Sheikh Othman were then inspected, after which the procession returned to the Residency. Here a number of other officers and officials, among them myself, had the honour of being presented to His Majesty with each of whom he found time to have a short conversation. His Maiesty speaks excellent English. * J ' After light refreshments His Majesty re-embarked, the Guard of Honour being now provided by the Aden Levies. 9 A Royal Salute was again fired by the field battery. “ Penzance’s ” guard paraded, and on this occasion it appeared that a Guard was also mounted in “ Gorizia ”, although elsewhere the work of the ship proceed ed without apparent interruption. 28. “ Gorizia ” proceeded to sea at 1130, followed by “ Savoia ” at 1210 . As the Yacht passed £ ‘ Penzance ” the same honours were rendered as on her arrival, and as she reached the entrance to the Inner Harbour, Royal Salutes were bred by the ship and Marbut battery. 29. The Chief Commissioner informs me that from his bearing and general demeanour throughout the visit he is confident that His Majesty was genuinely pleased with the arrangements made for his reception; this opinion was fully confirmed by subsequent reports from the Consul, to whom His Majesty and lead ing members of Lis entourage had expressed their complete satisfaction. Sir Bernard has since received a telegram from London, expressing His Majesty’s Government’s approval of the arrangements made, and congratulating him on his tactful handling of the situation.

With reference to my despatch No. 360 of the 12 th December 1933 [Serial JNo. (12) in F. No. 17-N./34], relative to the visit to this country by air of an Egyptian commercial and financial mission headed by Muhammad Talaat Harp as a, have the honour to inform you that on the 22nd November a similar mission arrived from Egypt by aeroplane, almost a year since the first visit was made. e mem hers of the mission this year are Midhat Yeghen Pasha, chairman o^ direc of the Banque Misr ; Muhammad Talaat Harb Pasha, deputy chairman o p n ^ , of the Banque Misr and Egyptian Senator ; Fuad Bey Sultan and ^ • Barakat, members of the board of directors of P*J n( l ue ^ isr -p of the manager of Misr Airwork, S.A.E. ; and Muhammad-al-Masin e y&gt; h* £ stronger Egyptian Steam Navigation Company.

Short halts were made this year at Tor, Wejh and Yanbu The pilots are Mr. G. S. Brown (flight-lieutenant R. A. F. Reserve) and Ismail Effendi Sidky. 3 Talaat Pasha, who called on His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires the day after his arrival, left with his associates for Mecca by car on the 25th November. He is expected to leave here on the 28th November by air for Yanbu, whence he will visit Marlmfl hv car. and return to Egvpt by air on the 1 st December. 4 . I hope to be in a position to report more fully in due course on the objects of this second visit to the Hejaz. Generally, I think, it maybe assumed that the mission will interest itself, as last year, in makir g arrangements for the reception of Egyptian phgrims coming to this country by the Egyptian steamers Zomzam and Nil, and in taking further steps to establish here branches of the Barque Misr. 5 . The mission do not appear to be the guests of the Saudi Government this vear, and whilst in Jedda have been accommodated in the new premises taken by the Banque Misr during the past year, which were originally intended, it is believed, for the Soviet Legation. Generally, it may be said that less publicity has been given to this visit than to its counterpart of last year ; I have still to hear of the broadcast distribution of piece-goods, etc., of Egyptian manufacture, whilst this year the aeroplanes have not been activly engaged in treating the Jedda popu lace to joy-rides. 6 . I was informed by my Egyptian colleague, some time before the arrival of the mission, that Talaat Harb Pasha had requested permission of the Saudi authorities to be allowed to fly to Riyadh to meet the King. I understand that the Saudis have been unable to accede to this request. 7 .

With reference to my despath No. 349 of the 27th November last [Serial No. ( 6 )] relative to the Egyptian commercial and financial mission to this country, I have the honour to report that Talaat Harb Pasha, Midhat Yaghen Pasha and party (with the exception of Kem.al Bey Alui, who left the same day for Egypt by Khedivial mail steamer) left for Yanbu by air on the 28th November and after visiting Medina by car resumed their return journey to Egypt on the last December. 2 . Talaat Pasha’s visit this year is shorter than was expected and only two whole days were put in at Mecca. By some this is thought to be due to his dis satisfaction at being refused permission to fly to Riyadh to see the King. His donations to schools and hospitals were on a modest scale, according to report, but free distribution as charity of piece-goods and other Egyptian manufactures, which had not taken place when I wrote my despatch under reference, was subsequently undertaken on behalf of the Egyptian mission by the Jedda municipality on the 4th December. 3. I learn that Talaat Pasha was primarily interested in arranging with the Saudi authorities for further facilities this year for Egyptian pilgrims. The ship- mg agents will continue to be Messrs. Haji Abdullah Ali Reza and Co., according to their own account, and financial arrangements, which are said to include the perception of Saudi pilgrim dues from, the individual pilgrims by Banque Misr and payment to the Saudi Arab Government in a lump sum., will be handled by Banque Misr or separately appointed agents here. Two large motor-launches, to seat 100 passengers each, are to be brought here by Banque Misr in order to facilitate the transport of pilgrims from the outer anchorage in the heavy seas.

Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated the 8th January 1935. Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, JNo. 346, DATED THE 26TH NOVEMBER 1934. With reference to your despatch No. 394(E.-6322/2429/25) of the 2nd Novem ber, relative to the interest evinced by the Italian Government in the recent visit to London ot Fuad Bey Hamza, I have the honour to inform you that in the course of a conversation on the 8th November my Italian colleague, Signor Persico, made a somewhat vague allusion to our interests on the Arabian shores of the Persian Gulf and asked me whether it was true that a conference was to be held shortly over there. He continued interrogatively and with an air of ingenuous innocence. “ Those parts are now very important, are they not ” ? As his reference to the matter vas rather casual I was able to reply evasively and he did not pursue the subject. 2. Signor Persico is still fairly new to this post and from the few an unimpor tant conversations I have bad with him since his return from Europe gives me the impression of being only superficially acquainted with questions to which he has, always spontaneously, referred. For example, he has twice adverted to the ques tion &amp;i meeting between Ibn Saud and Amir Abdullah of Trans-Jordan, professing to have seen passing references to this subject in the press of neighbouring countries. The second occasion he mentioned this matter was during the conversation of the 8th November, when I felt myself able to reply somewhat more explicitly that there was no immediate prospect of a meeting. 3. When Signor Persico left Jedda on leave of absence on the 8th July last he travelled to Port Sudan in the same Khedivial Mail steamer as Fuad Bey Hamza and I believe they continued their journey together by an Italian steamer as far as Suez. He has since avowed that he had frequent opportunities for conversation with Fuad Bey, and his present curiosity in regard to Saudi Arab affairs in the Persian Gulf may have its origin in that association during the voyage, or on the other hand, may perhaps have received a stimulus from reports of Signor Fracassi’s conversations at the Foreign Office, which could have reached him here by the 8th November. 4.

I have the honour to inform you that my French colleague, M. Roger Maigret, wfm, as you are aware, is Charge d’Affaires en titre of the French consulate here,informed me in the course of conversation yesterday that his Government now proposed to raise their mission in Saudi Arabia to the status of a Legation. Budget ary provision had been made, and he expected, the change to date from the 1st % January next. He stated, in answer to my enquiry, that the head of the post would hold the rank of Minister, and that he would remain on in that capacity. On my congratulating him, he explained that although he understood privately that his appointment had been contemplated by his Ministry in any case, yet Fuad Bey Hamza had interested himself with the French Government to secure his selection. The elevation of the French representation here, and the appointment of M. Maigret, may well have been, although the latter did not say so, amongst the questions dis cussed with the French Government by Fuad Bey Hamza during his recent visit to Europe. 2. M. Maigret, who, as is his wont, has remained virtually invisible during the summer, is again becoming locomotive, as he proposes to leave Jedda within a few days for a three weeks’ visit to the Yemen. Upon his return from Sana, he hopes, before the Haj, to pay a brief visit to Syria to meet the High Commissioner there. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Chief Commissioner at Aden and His Majesty’s consul-general at Beirut.

Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 370, dated the 11th December 1934. Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—(Received December 31.) I have the honour to refer to my despatch No. 351 of the 5 th December 1933 [Serial No. ( 6 ) in F. No. 17-N./34], in which I ventured to submit a short review of the general financial situation in this country. I again propose to attempt, with the modest material available in a country where statistics of any value are unknown, an appreciation of the general financial and economic condition of Saudi Arabia at the present time. 2 . Since the despatch under reference was written, the intervening months have witnessed little real alleviation of the financial difficulties with which Ibn Sand was then finding himself increasingly confronted. The principal drain on his resources, due to the long-drawn struggle with the Yemen, the necessity of pro- vidrng for an army in the field and at the same time of cementing the loyalty of tnbal leaders in Nejd by subsidies and supplies in kind, can scarcely have di minished until the operations came to a successful conclusion and the troops returned to their own country during July and August. Even then demobilisation involved the grant of gratuities in rials and in kind to each individual soldier, a process which began at Taif upon the immediate return of the troops and continued at Kiyadh until mid-November. Mr. Philby estimates the cost to Ibn Saud of these gratuities alone to be in the neighbourhood of £100,000 gold. Thus the whole period under review has been one of abnormal military expenditure, in prosecuting e war an , aJ its conclusion, in paying in hard cash a handsome insurance pre mium against tribal discontent at a lootless victory. rv ^ not unnaturally be asked where are the resources upon which the King could draw so liberally. Mr. Philby is convinced that the explanation lies in the receipt of a war indemnity from the Imam of the Yemen.

The revenue, which in the despatch under reference Was represented as exiguous, has probably shown some improvement, but not of a nature to offset expenditure the pilgrimage of 1934 exceeded 25,000, in comparison with 20,000 of the year before and pilgrim dues to the Government and activity in the bazaars were stimulated m proportion. The prospects for the forthcoming pilgrimage are still conjectural, but it may not be excessive optimism to expect a slight increase again m 1935. The remarks m last year s report in regard to the generail level of poverty of latter-day pilgrims still apply, although the efforts of Talaat Harb Pasha, upon whose activities I have reported elsewhere, are directed towards in ducing Egyptians of the wealthier sort to perform the Haj. 6. Customs receipts are still one of the several unkown factors in Saudi Arabia's economic equation. One might perhaps hazard the opinion that there has this year been a slight improvement. The small increase in the pilgrimage and the partial liquidation of old stocks of goods in the hands of local merchants must have exerted a favourable influence. Receipts, however, are mortgaged as has been now the practice for some years by the system of drafts to which a reference was made in the despatch under reference. 7. The Saudi Government’s revenue has been augmented this year, it is stated, by the receipt during the early summer of £20,000 gold from the Standard Oil Company of California, a sum believed to represent the second instalment of the initial loan promised by the company under the terms of their Hasa oil con cession. A further loan, said to be very small, is reported to have been obtained in November from Talaat Harb Pasha, and is thought probably to be secured on Saudi pilgrim, dues, which will be paid by Egyptians during the forthcoming Haj. Mr. Philby, at any rate, was made happy by being paid “ £ 2,000 or £3,000,” half in cash and half in a draft on Messrs. Haji Abdullah All Ridha and Co., confidential agents and importers to the Saudi authorities, not in respect, I understand, of out standing debts, but to finance the import of motor vehicles in accordance with his concession. 8 . Indeed, the position of the Saudi Government in regard to both their internal and foreign obligations is as unsatisfactory as ever. Certainly no attempt has been made during the year under review to meet the long outstanding debts due to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, and Ibn Saud appears unlikely to manifest any great readiness to do so in the near future. 9 . The Minister of Finance has continued to pursue a policy of rigid economy in Government expenditure, although* the opinion has been heard that money, or day to day requirements of an essential nature, is not so tight as was the case a year ago. Official salaries are still seriously in arrear and for more than tiie nrst six months of the Arabic year 1353 (until the end of October) Government servants had received a bare two months’ salary, and that at the par la ea 110 piastres miri gold (£1 gold), whereas the current rate for rials had fluctuated between 24 and 22 rials to the gold pound. 10. Saudi currency during the year has remained relativ^ steady and did not show any marked tendency to depreciate after the last pto«e “ 1 m mv desnatch under reference. The rial rate varied with m the limits indicate above, and at the time of Writing is 22, betraying again the customary apprecia ion which marks the arrival of pilgrims from abroad. 11 The general tone of trade in theHejaz is stated to be somewhat healthier, the manager (ff the Dutch banking concern here, the chappij, stating that during the past year t ere a hd bills. This applied and much less reluctance on the part o mere un s ~ ^ following figures particularly to the past six months. I am m e e irnnorts and exports for compiled by himself and, he insists, very tentative, of the imports and p the Arabic years 1351 and 1352 : Imports Exports 1351. £ sterling. . 2,028,000 1352. £ sterling. 1,657,850 150,685 iportant commodities, showed an m- Piece-goods and flour, amongst the more second year. The number crease in 1352 over 1351, most others falling away m the seco yof different headings of comoaodities imported was only 108 in 1352 as compared with 149 in 1351. These figures, partial and approximate though they may be and although they relate, except for the last part of 1352, to the years prior to the period covered by this survey, are nevertheless of some interest. 12. The picture drawn in the foregoing paragraphs may indicate a far from satisfactory condition, but it is not one of wholly unrelieved gloom. Whilst tin r e is still considerable and serious destitution amongst the poorer classes, which the di daibution of food and clothing by Ibn Saud and the charity of the well-disposed do little to alleviate, the cost of living is not appreciably higher to the Hejazi. Rents, on the other hand, have fallen considerably in Mecca and Jedda, and, in the latter town, building of new houses, in itself not a symptom of economic depression, is going on on all hands. Rains in the Hejaz have been plentiful everywhere during the autumn, and reports are satisfactory from many parts of Nejd. Ibn Saud therefore is issuing, it is announced, seed to cultivators and a good harvest in due course will do much to repair the ravages of past privations. 13.

I was interested to see that in the Kuwait Intelligence Summary No. 1 of 1935, paragraph 6(d) confirmed Philby’s opinion given in paragraph 300 of Jedda Report for December 1934 that Ibn Saud was incurring some unpopularity by wasting his time hunting instead of attending to business. 2. Paragraph 6 (g) also confirmed the statement in the same paragraph of tlie Report that the rumours of jealousy between Faisal and Saud were at least ex aggerated. P ara gTaph 6(A), however, if correct, indicates that there is a serious rift m the Saudian lute between Ibn Saud and his brother, Mohammad, and this is possible as being more or less in the nature of things amongst Arabs. On the Arab coast of the Gulf, for instance, where enmity exists in a Shaikhly family, more of ten than not it is at its acutest betwen the Ruler and one of his brothers.

Mr. Saleh Jaffer (British Political Clerk) and the new Port Ofncer (emroyal barber) called to welcome the ship. 7. The weather being unsuitable for the use of ship’s boats, I landed on the morning of the 7tli m the harbour launch at the celebrated Iron Ladder, now tempo rarily rejuvenated by the addition of another ladder of slightly stouter build, and was received at the shore end of the pier by a Guard of Honour and a large crowd. Driving to the Palace in the courtyard of which another Guard was parad ed, I was shown into the presence of the Amir, Seyyid Abdullah al Wazir, who received me with much friendliness and every appearance of genuine pleasure. This w r as the first occasion on which I had met His Excellency, as Penzance had sailed for Malta before he assumed command of the town in early July. His Excellency begged to be excused from returning my call in person, as he was carry ing out a preliminary fast in preparation for the more serious business of Ramadan, and feared the effects of the prolonged boat passage to and from the ship under the prevailing weather conditions. These were, indeed such that I readily agreed and suggested that, in the interests of his deputies, the return ceremony should in any case be deferred until the weather moderated. 8. A gift to the ship of 2 sheep, beef, 30 dozen bananas, 30 dozen eggs, 10 bags of cojfee, vegetables and fruit was received from the Amir during the after noon, to whom a return present of tinned fruit was sent, accompanied by a suitable letter of thanks. 9. Officers landed in the afternoon for tennis. The improved standard of play among the habitues, a new box of balls and a locally constructed net of striking colour bore witness to the continued popularity of the game, which is such that even the re-surfacing of the court itself is seriously mooted. *********** 13. The Amir appears to be taking at least some steps to develop the town ; the seawall has been built up and the foreshore cleared of much accumulated rubbish, while a small icemaking plant, purchased second hand at Port budan, has been installed but is not yet in working order. The bann on the importa tion of gramophones and alcoholic drinks has, however, been re-imposed with renewed severity. The foreign communitv has changed but little. The Italian Doctor T-azzi maintains a clinic in the erstwhile Government store near the seafiont, at which free medical attention is dispensed The Italian Agent Jamecili is still in the town, but the French Vice Consul, in a state of extreme decrepitude, has retired to his home at Beirut. 14 With regards to the Petroleum dispute with the Sa’uid Government m June last (PenzaSce’s No. 0/59 of 25th June 1934) (F. 31LN./34) it was ascertained from the representative of Messrs.

With reference to my despatch No. 300 of the 2nd October last [ Serial No. (95) in File No. 17-N./34] reporting the appointment of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, Minister of Finance, to be Deputy Minister of Defence, I have the honour to trans mit to you herewith the translations of two announcements by the latter Ministry regarding the small “ regular ’’army maintained by Ibn Saud, which appeared in the Saut-al-Hejaz of the 26th November. The first relates to enlistment in the ranks and contains the conditions and terms of service, whilst the second announces the establishment, as from the 16th January, 1935, of a military school at Mecca, where candidates for commissioned rank are to pursue a three years’ course of training. 2. This evidence of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman’s determination to strengthen and improve the present standing army of Saudi Arabia is of considerable interest. The development may be the fruit of experience gained during the war with the Yemen, though I am unable to believe that the Saudi regular forces are to be largely increased. The tribes, and notably the Ikhwan will always be Ibn Saud’s most effective and least expensive military weapon. Enclosure 1 in No. 1.

Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated the 6th February 1935. No. 1, Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d s Affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 366, Hated the 10th December 1934. Relations between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, since the recent dispute, have to all appearances pursued an uneventful course and have ceased to occupy the forefront of public attention locally. Nevertheless reports, vague but persistent, have not been wanting that all is still not well in the Yemen. Frontier difficulties are hinted at, and perhaps somewhat exaggerated stories are current of the restiveness of the Seif-ul-Islam Ahmad, said to be under arms still at Sada and chafing under the restrictions imposed by his father the Imam. 2. I have been disposed to attach little importance to these rumours, and it is perhaps unnecessary to treat them seriously. My French colleague, M. Maigret, spoke to me yesterday, however, on this subject, and whilst admitting that his own information was indefinite, expressed the opinion that there undoubtedly did exist trouble it was, at present, difficult to diagnose. He hoped to leave Jedda shortly on a three weeks’ visit to Sana, and expected to be able to arrive at a more accurate appreciation of the situation in the Yemen during that time. 3. The unrest may be of purely internal significance, and may be a natural reaction after the Imam’s ill-success in the late war with Saudi Arabia. The press of both countries have, however, not entirely allayed misgivings recently by protesting with vigour that the two countries are now on the most friendly terms, and denying with emphasis the “ false reports ” put about by interested persons to the contrary. The Umm-al-Qura of the 23rd November quoted an article from the Sana newspaper the Iman in which reports of the concentration of troops on the Saudi-Yemen frontier were categorically denied. Peace and tranquility prevailed ; conditions had returned to normal; and concord reigned between the “ two Moslem sects ” (presumably the Zeidi and Shafi sects of the Yemen). From the Hejazi press, the Iman continued, it was understood that a similarly fortunate situation existed in this country. The Umm-al-Qura delightedly welcomed the article with lengthy variations on the themes of Arab brotherhood, the Treaty of Taif and the wiles of unscrupulous mischief-makers inspired by hatre and jealousy of the Arabs and of Islam. I do not propose to transmit to you a translation of this article. 4. It mav not be out of olace here to inform you, in regard to the Saudi-Yemenmi i 18 an average of 40,000 Maria Theresa dollars a day, or an approximate total over the whole period of about £100,000 gold. Where has this money come from if not from the Imam ? £100,000 would probably be the amount of the indemnity. I still feel unable to share Mr. Philby s conviction^ and I find that the French Charge d’Affaires, to whom Mr. Philby has spoken in a similar strain, is equally sceptical. M. Maigret considered that Ibn Saud, to content the tribes disappointed of loot in the war, has probably had to make serious inroads on the Royal Treasury, and expressed his belief, from his personal knowledge of the Imam s character, that the latter would have continued the war, by no means lost to him after the fall of Hudeida, rather than have parted with so considerable a sum of money. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty s Ambassador at Rome and His Majesty’s Chief Commissioner at Aden.

I enclose a copy of a letter from Princess Fatma Haider (nee Miss Dunn), the wife of Sherif Ali Haider, which has been sent to the Prince of Wales, and which has been passed on to us by the Prince’s Private Secretary. The Sherif, as perhaps you know, used formerly to live in Constantinople. He worked in with the Young Turks and was at one time Minister of Evkaf. He was appointed Brand Sherif to supersede King Hussein in or about 1917, and was, in general, run by the Turks as an opposition candidate for that post when the Hashimite family had gone over to the Allies. Naturally however he was unable to take possession of his post. Early in 1926 he tried to obtain the support of His Majesty’s Government m obtaining the post of Regent or Governor of the Hejaz under King Ibn Saud.

Letter from the Foreign Office, to the Secretary to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, No. E. 498/498/35, dated the 12th February 1935. I am sorry that there has been some delay in replying to your letter of the 22nd January enclosing a letter from the Princess Fatma Haider to the Prince of Wales, but it has been necessary to consult our own archives on certain points connected with the Sherif Ali Haider and also to ask the India Office whether they had any observations to offer on the Princess’s letter from the Moslem point of view. It may be useful for you in the first place to have a brief account of the Sherif. He belongs to an ancient family of the Hejaz, which claims descent from Mahmot and members of which have frequently in the past held the office of Grand Sherif of Mecca, a position of varying political power but of great religious prestige through out the Mohammedan world. Sherif Ali Haider, used formerly to live at Con stantinople, where he worked in with the 4 Young Turks ’ and was at one time a Turkish Cabinet Minister. In or about 1917 he was appointed Grand Sheriff of Mecca by the Ottoman Government, to supersede King Hussein, who had gone over to the Allies. He was, however, naturally unable to take up his post in the Hejaz, which was in revolt against the Turks. Early in 1926 he tried to obtain British support, in obtaining the post of Regent or Governor of the Hejaz under King Ibn Saud, who had by that time driven King Hussein’s family out of Arabia but His Majesty’s Government were unwilling to intervene in a politico-religious question of this kind : he appears to have been, and certainly claimed to be, on fairly friendly terms with Ibn Saud, although, when he attempted in 1926 to pay a visit to the Hejaz, Ibn Saud politely requested him not to do so. We have no knowledge of any subsidy or promise of a subsidy to him from Ibn Saud, apart from the complaint contained in Princess Fatma’s letter. W r e have referred this point to Sir Andrew Ryan at Jedda, who has some personal knowledge of the family : it need not, how ever, affect the question of the reply to be returned to the Princess. Since U26 the Sherif has lived at Beirut with his English (or Irish) wife (nee Dunn) whom he married at Constantinople. He has several sons, the eldest of whom is married to a daughter of the eac-Sultan of Turkey, while another studied at St. Andrew s University. We have nothing against the Sherif, who, so far as we know, is a respectable person and is genuinely in reduced circumstances. On the other an , we ave n political reason for wishing to assist him, and in fact any assistance w ic construed as in any way coming from a British official source mig - P r ® e jt , mng. The India Office have no comments to offer from their pom ® vie ; . ’ therefore, His Royal Highness is personally disposed to assist the Sherd i ^tiy, we cm only suggest that a regretful reply in the negatrve si Primess Fatma’s request.r . 20 . ■ (19) (Received on 16th March 1935, with Political Secrelautfs Utter No. 9, dated SStk v February Woo.)

I have been instructed to take the necessary steps to obtain the certificate of the Stipendiary Magistrate under the Aliens Order, 1920, with respect to certain Arab seamen who have been in receipt of relief, with a view to the men being deported. Some of the Arabs claim that they were born in Aden, and, hence, although they are registered as Aliens, some question may arise in the course of the proceed ings as to whether they are not British Subjects. I am aware, of course, that the onus is entirely upon the alleged Aliens to show that they are British Subjects, but for the purpose of the proceedings I am desirous of having an authoritative statement as to the status of the various parts of the Aden territory. The position, so far as I can gather, would seem to be that the town of Aden itself, together with Perim, form for legal purposes part of British India and are part of the British Dominions, while there is a considerable territory in addition which is merely a British Protectorate. If this is correct a person born either in the town of Aden or Perim is a British Subject, while one born in the Protectorate is an Alien.

I have the honour to refer to my confidential despatch No. 204, of the 2nd July last [Serial No. (78) in File No. 17-N/34] relative to the activities of Mr. K. S. Twitehell, representative of the Saudi Arabia Mining Syndicate (limited), and to Jedda report for December 1934 (on File No. 72 -N/ 34 )|para- graph 304 and preceding reports, where the varying fortunes of Mr. Twitched, (ngaged over a period of some six months in negotiating with the Saudi Arab Government a concession to exploit minerals in. this country, have been periodi cally recorded. The successful conclusion of these negotiations was noticed in th e repor t under reference and was announced in th e Mecca Umm-al-Qura of the 28th Decem.ber in a short article which described the concession, signed on the 23rd Decem.ber 1934, as one for the exploitation of the gold and other mineral resources of the country, with the exception of oil and other liquids, over a res tricted area. The agreement, the article stated, would shortly be ratified, and thereafter the text would be published. 2. Pending the publication of the text of the concession, the following parti culars, part y disclosed in conversation by Mr. Twitchell himself, and partly reced ed from other sources, are of interest: (a) The Government are to be assigned la per cent, of the shares in any companies to be formed to work particular concessions, a provision which it is gathered, proved unplat able to Mr. Twitchell, who favours the assignment of 15 per cent, of the initial nominal capital rather than 15 per cent, of shares actually issued, as and when issued, a point on. which he found nim- self obliged to yield. Mr. Twitchell stated that he successfully resisted the desire of the Saudi Government to participate, to the extent of 15 per cent, of the shaies. Pr 0 r e tel (o) bitoms duty IS to be pa.d at a fl^ire of 10 etc., imported, (rf) The area finally agreed on under the concession t rougUy'^ whole of hhe Heiaz and Asir as far south as RirV nri+h ’ ,r u s n v &gt; the seryed areas, notably about the Holy Cities. ThiL general descr^tin wasgfve^ by Mr. Philby, who sard that the area first approved by the King extended fsTr as meridian 44 degrees thus including a considerable slice of Nejd. but that it was later decided to set the eastern limits much more to the west. Mr Twitchel X d!d not allude m any detail to this point, expressed himself generally as quite safe fied with the area actually allotted, (e) The agreement, according to Mr Twitchell must be ratified by the syndicate, after which it will be published. 3 It is gathered that Mr. Twitchell is to be joined by M. Van de Poll, the D itch Moslem who has for some years resided in this country, where formerly he had commercial interests in work connected with the concession, although presum ably m some non-techmcal capacity. Mr. Twitchell left Jedda for Egypt and Syria on the 26th December and is understood to be actively engaged in making; arrangements for prospecting, and, if a report from Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey &amp; Co that a large consignment of pit-props has been ordered tnrough them by Mr Twitchell is to be believed, for early mining operations as well. 4.

As you know, there is considerable activity in speculative gold mining shares at present owing to the price of gold. The big and first-class gold mining companies frequently take a share in these speculative companies, but usually are at pains to keep their own name out of the business. Enclo. 2 to S. No. (78).

It transpired that a friend of his named Hussain al Awayni (Aoueini), now resident in Haifa, desired “to open a shop” and received permission to take up permanent residence in Palestine. Sheykh Yusut therefore invoked my assistance in getting this permission accorded to his friend. i • I pointed out that, as he was well aware, the regulations governing per manent residence in Palestine were strict, but promised to do with I could to please him.

As the majority of them owed money in Loheiya, he (Wazir) would be very grateful if they could be ordered to leave Kamaran forthwith. 8. Dr. Chohan caused an immediate census to be taken, which re vealed the fact that there wfts no less than 16 men and 172 women and children front Loheiya and 20—25 women and children from Khoba still remaining in Kamaran. They were dispersed in small groups throughout the native village, unknown evidently, to the Administrator, Captain Wickham, who had reported Kamaran clear of refugees some weeks previously. 9. An immediate announcement was made by town crier that they wouldl all have to leave within 48 hours, and in spite of arguments, protests and excuses, the sergeant of police was able to report that they were all 5Majesty’s 1 afloat and clear of Kamaran Harbour at the expiration of this period, viz., secretary’s It n0 on on 14th August.

The blade was inscribed, in English on one side and in Arabic on the other :— “From His Majesty King George V of England to His Majesty the Imam Yahya Bin Mohamed Hamid-ud-Din, King of the Yemen. lieutenant Colonel Lake kindly allowed this beautiful object to be displayed on the Quarterdeck, where it was greatly admired by all.

With reference to my despatch No. 286 (2620/115/13) of the 18th September, in which I briefly reported Ibn Sa’ud’s return to Riyadh from Taif, 1 have the honour to inform you that although the King’s movements convey the impression that the general situation in this country give no cause for disquietude. I have recently received reports from two sources which would suggest that Ibn Sa’ud’s triumphant assertion of power in his recen struggle with the Yemen has not altogether overawed certain disaffecte elements within his own country. 2. Discontent is said to exist in the Jauf and Teima areas and forces are being sent there to stabilise the situation. My Indian Vice-Consul has just returned from a visit of several weeks to Medina and reports that re cruiting is being unobstrusively carried on in the town, the troops being destined for service in those northern districts.

Political R si- dent, Persian Gulf, to J. G. Laithwaite, Esq., India Office, No. 1029-S./34, dated the 7th November 1934. When I was at home on leave recently I expressed the view m casual conversation to the India Office, and I think also ito the Foreign Office, that in spite of Ibn Baud’s ostensible victory in the Yemen war his—Ibn baud s- stock had probably gone down amongst the Arabs of .the. Persian uili. The reasons I gave were that when Ibn Saud mad'e his victorious invasion of Yemen territory as far, down as, and including, Hodeidah, there was much talk, not only in the Arab but in the English Press, of how he was going to follow up these initial successes: capture Sana, install his son Feisal as Yiceroy of the Yemen, exact enormous indemnity from the Imam Yahya, and so forth, and that the final result fell far short of these expectations. “The good old rule, the ancient plan, That he shall fake who has the power, And he shall hold who can”, 2. I fuijther expressed the opinion that the net result of the campaign in Arab eyes was that while Ibn Saud had secured Nejran, he had evacuated the whole of the Yemen coast-line, including Hodeidah, without extracting a penny of indemnity from the enemy That the average Arab’s idea of statesmanship was ;—- and that he would refuse to believe that Ibn Saud would have given such easy terms to the Imam if he had been strong enough to impose severer, ones. 3. During an interview which I had with the Shaikh of Kuwait when I passed through there recently on my way out, he touched on the question of the Saudi-Yemen war, and said definitely that Ibn Saud’s prestige had gone down on the Arab Coast of the Gulf as a result of that campaign. I enclose for ready reference an extract from a recent Kuwait Intelligence Summary, which is to the same effect.

Bin Baud and Yemen Campaign.—(a) Since the writer returned from leave, he has found many opportunities of discussing past Yemen events with a number of Bedouin trans-border Chiefs, as well as with the Shaikh of Kuwait and notables of the Town. On all sides ha has been told that Bin Saud has definitely lost much “prestige” as a result of the war. Everywhere the belief is very strong that had Bin Saud been strong enough, nothing in the world would have prevented him from over-running or crushing Yahya- He, however, found himself in imminent danger after his seizure of Hodeida, of being surrounded and his armies destroyed, so he wisely obeyed the instincts of self-preservation and made the peace he did. Yahya was also satisfied, being an old man and without aggressive ideas—for had he not won the moral victory and forced Bin Saud 'to with draw, without so much as surrendering an inch of Yemen territory, or paying a rial by way of indemnity? (&amp;) The barren Nejran after all was no gain to Bin Saud, but has merely been given ito her own people, the Yam tribe, who are blood brothers of the Hurra and Ajman tribes. * * * * * (95) (Received on 2J^th November 1934, with Political Secretary’s letter No. '45, dated the 8th November 1934) j Letter from H.

I have the honour to inform you that the Mecca newspaper the Saut- al-Kijaz announced in its issue of the 24th September the appointment by Ibn Saud of his Minister of Finance, Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman-al-Ham- dan. .to be Deputy Minister of Defence, an office he is to occupy in addition to his present one. As you are aware, the Minister of Finance has for some time, and notably during the recent conflict with the Yemen, effectively performed the functions of Minister of War. 2. The same communique also announces the appointment of Sayyid Saleh Shata (Personalities Report, No. 85) and Sheikh Khalid Abul Walid- al-Qarqani (Personalities Report, No. 57) as members of the permanent committee of the Council of Ministers. 3.

I find at present little in the general situation to justify a more formal report, but there are one or two matters which appear to call for mention though perhaps inappropriate to a despatch. Amir Feysal left (with Sheykh’ Abdullah Suleyman) for Riyadh yester day evening, a visit which has been impending, according to report, for some time. It was said he was awaiting the arrival of Talaat Pasha Harb by air from Egypt, but the Pasha has failed to appear, (though tents were erected and the landing ground prepared several days ago) and is now said to be due aboujt the 22nd November. Feysal is reported to have been summoned to Riyadh by his father in connexion, the know-alls here would have us believe, with certain differen ces which have been making themselves felt between Feysal and Saud. Jealousy between these two brothers is, I believe, an old story but is said to have grown considerably sharper of late. As I have generally indicated in the Jedda Report for October the reasons given are numerous. Saud is said to be sore that Feysal should have got the lion’s share of the kudos out of the late war with the Yemen- He is jealous, too, of Feysal’s growing popularity in the Hejaz where the latter’s more easy-going and pleasure- loving temperament suits the public taste more than the Nejdi religious intolerance to which they have been accustomed. Saud may, moreover, have an eye on the possibility of the demise (or abdication) of the King and may distrust the presence of his younger brother, gradually establishing himself more securely in the saddle, in the Hejaz, the chief source of the wealth of Saudi Arabia. He may, also, imagine Feysal’s relations, as Minister for Foreign Affairs and after his journeys abroad, with foreign powers to be specially intimate; and probably has little use for Fuad Hamza and may suspect the tour of European capitals upon which he has recently been engaged. Feysal, I believe, has denied the report that he goes to Riyadh to be married, and confided to his intimate friend, Suleyman Gabil, recently that he was thoroughly fed up. I must apologise for retailing so much gossip, but it is, I feel, interest ing and should, I think, be recorded. For the rest, there is nothing fresh to report about the situation at Teima; and Fuad Hamza has still to arrive back frpm his tour (though I gather from a recent despatch from Baghdad that he might go over there first).

If this supposition be correct, I am directed to point out that patrols of this nature along this track have been carried out as a matter of routine for the past three years and that the car track on which Shaib Thaniyya Tarais is situated is not in Saudi Arabia but is in Transjordan territory.

Conversation between our Special Correspondent and Fuad Bey Hamza. Q. Will your Excellency tell me in detail what was the aim in present circumstances of your visit to the European capitals ? A . I went to Europe on a private visit to take a rest, but I also took the opportunity of meeting the men of Italy, France and Great Britain of discussing with them questions of interest to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz, and of solving some of the outstanding problems. F visited Italy and met Signor Mussolini. This visit served to confirm the good relations existing between the Italian and Arabian Governments. I visited the French capital and met the men of its Government and spoke to that experienced politician, the late M. Barthou, whose death was a great loss to the French nation. He was an energetic man, and he wisely steered French policy in the stormy sea of politics. I visited the English, capital and met the Hon’ble Sir John Simon, the Foreign Minister, and other men of the British Government. I am glad to be able jto declare that we succeeded in overcoming many difficulties and in coming to an understanding about many questions which are ot interest to the Arab Saudi and the British Governments. Q. Heiaz being one of the Governments jthat inaugurated the League of Nations, is it the intention of His Majesty to use that right, having neglected so far to claim it 1 A . Hejaz, which was one of the Governments which founded the League of Nations, was then an independent country by itself. Now i is no 6-3[C) F&amp;PDQ' But the Government of His Majesty Abdul Aziz has inherited the Hejaz Kingdom! A. If we had inherited that, we should have inherited also some other things which are not in our interest. So is it better not to have inherited anything. Q. Then is it not the intention of the Government of His Majesty to enter the League of Nations ? A - It is possible that this question is now under discussion. Q. What about the negotiations concerning the Hejaz Railway? A. Negotiations on that subject are taking place between the Arabian, Trench and English Governments. Probably a conference will be held shortly to take a final decision about this railway. Q Is it not to the interest of Hejaz, Syria and the Moslem world to have the line between Maan and Medina repaired and put into action, and leave other questions to be discussed later ? A. Among other questions considered during the negotiations, which took place a long time ago, was the repairing of the line between Maan and Medina. One of the subjects to be discussed by the conference is the way for securing the necessary funds for repairing this part of the line.

I have the honour to refer to your despatch No. 1,_ dated 4th January 1933, in which you authorised the payment to His Highness the Suit an oi Sbehr and Mukalla of the arrears of his stipend for a period of three years only from Isjt April 1930 to 31st March 1933. The Sultan has been informed of your decision, but he has not yet drawn the amount which you have sanctioned. 2. In your despatch under reference you anticipated ^ difficulty might be experienced in resisting payment of the ? ° T , obligations, have accrued in the event of the Sultan invoking hi y § e This difficulty has now arisen, as the Sultan has .5 ddr ®* s n ed of a l e - s te Q r es ti “ n on the 27th February in which he asks for r ^^Xthe ternJ of his on the ground that he is entitled to the tun ar fWp no stioula- Treaty of 1882 with the British Government, m w deprived tipn that he is bound to draw his stipend annually, or that he will be deprived76 of it if he fails to do so. He further represents that his stipend was allowed to fall into arrears because of its small annual amount, that his predecessor Sultan Ghaleb was permitted to draw arrears accumulated for a f ar ge number of years, and that neither his predecessor nor he himself was warned that arrears would in future be forfeited. 3. All the Chiefs of the Aden Protectorate, including His Highness the Sultan of Shehr and Mukalla, have now been told that their stipend must be drawn punctually or not at all, but I consider that there is a good deal of force in the Sultan’s contention that a retrospective insistence of this con dition in contradiction of a comparatively recent precedent and without previous intimation of its adoption is opposed to the spirit, if not to the letter, of his Treaty. The existence of the Aden Protectorate is based on mutual obligation established by treaties between His Majesty’s Government and the local Chiefs, and a scruplous observation of the conditions of these treaties is essential to the maintenance of our relationship with them. I feel very strongly Jthat there should never be any doubt that obligations under the treaties will be fully honoured, and I consider that in a case of some uncertainty, such as the present one, it is better to accept rather than to repudiate a claim for which there appears to be a good though perhaps not a conclusive case. For this reason I venture to recommend a considera tion of the orders conveyed to me in your despatch of the 4th January 1933, and the payment of the arrears of stipend due to the Sultan of Shehr and Mukalla in full from 1st October 1917. 4. I base my request primarily on a point of principle, but I desire to add a plea for generous treatment in this case on account of the consistently loyal and helpful attitude of the Mukalla authorities in all matters in which their co-operation or assistance is desired by the Aden Residency. This has been notably evident in connection with landing grounds and other facilities for the Royal Air Force in Mukalla territory and its neighbourhood. Mukalla is the most important place and the pivot of our policy in the eastern part of the Protectorate, but its Sultan nevertheless receives one of the smallest of the stipends paid to Protectorate Chiefs, and he is never given money presents such as are often bestowed upon others in the Pro tectorate. The amount of his stipend—Rs. 60 a month—is, in fact, so low that it can be regarded as little more than a token of the mutual rela tionship between him and His Majesty’s Government; and, as such, I con sider that it ought not to be allowed to lapse, even temporarily, in a case such as the one which I now submit for your reconsideration.

The legal position under the Treaty of 1882 has been examined, and 1 am advised that as the Treaty provides for a personal payment to the Sultan or other person in possession of the territory in question, in consi deration of his personal fulfilment of the obligations imposed on him by Articles 1 and 3, the Sultan could reasonably claim arrears of stipend which accrued during his own reign; but not arrears which his predecessor had waived or been unable to secure. , 3. In these circumstances the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury agree that the Sultan should be paid the arrears of stipend which have accrued since his accession in June 1922 amounting to approximately £675, but they are unable to sanction payment of arrears prior to that date. I am accordingly to convey to you my sanction for the issue to the Sultan of the arrears of the stipend from the date of his assumption of Chieftainship in June 1922. 4. In order to prevent any accumulation of arrears of stipends in future, I consider that all stipends should be paid automatically each year without awaiting applications from the stipendiary chiefs. By this method the strict obligations of Government to the Chiefs will be discharged and the accumulation of arrears will be prevented. Uuless you see any objection I have to request that you will arrange for this procedure to be adopted in future. ■ , !

A letter from the Imam was recently received by the Resident reporting the flight over Sana’a on 7th March of two European aeroplanes. The Imam thought that they were British, and was evidently much perturbed and he invoked the principles of International Law. The Resident replied immediately assuring the Imam that the machines had not gone from Aden or the Aden Protectorate, and promising to make enquiries. A reply has been received from the Imam thanking the Resident and accepting his assurance. It appears that a French civilian aeroplane flew from Jibuti over San’a on the date mentioned. * * # # # # # (57) (Received on 2nd June, 1934, with Politicial Secretary’s letter No. 20, dated the 17th MaV, 1934.

We passed to the Treasury for observations your confidential despatch hm. 76(737|124|18) of the 20th March, about Ydlibi’s Bank scheme. The reply that they have up to the present no information about this scheme nor any indica tion that it is to be supported by a British Bank. They point out that it is more than doubtful whether we should be able or willing to do anything to encourage the formation of a note-issuing Bank in Saudi, Arabia, even if it were to be handled by people whose integrity was entirely above suspicion. The conditions which would permit of a Central Bank being set up seem to be a very long way indeed from being fulfilled in Saudi Arabia, and if the project is ever realized it will, in the opinion of the Treasury, have to be by stages. 2. They find some difficulty in giving a. detailed written opinion on a case such as that of Ydlibi’s scheme, but they add that they would be very glad to ha\e the opportunity to talk it over with you when next you are in England. 2. On a subsidiary point I may add that we too are mystified by Ydlibi s reference to arrangements in Iraq. Apparently at one time during las Iraqi Government had a vague idea of creating a State Bank but we ave i a no more about it. . ^ I«296FD Ift | •ftk-iA mi&amp;ev ? Uiitr- Jiy (±r.'

R. Bailey in the Yemen and Aden, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to request you to inform Secretary Sir Phillip Cunliffe-Lister that he would see no objection to a proposal to endorse Mr. Bailey’s passport as “ not valid for Aden, the Aden Protectorate or the Yemen 2. The Passport Office have been in communication with the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited who have furnished them with Mr. Bailey’s last known address in this country and have stated that he is no longer officially connected with the syndicate. If Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister so desires, a letter can he addressed to Mr. Bailey by the Passport Office requesting him to send them his passport, which is described as passport No. COS issued at Calcutta in 1928. On receipt, it would be endorsed in the sense suggested. If Mr. Bailey cannot be traced in this country, the Passport Office can issue a circular to His Majesty’s Consular and Passport Control Officers instructing them to make the necessary endorsement on Mr. Bailey’s passport, if it should come into their hands. 3. It should be realised, however, that, even if Mr. Bailey’s passport is endorsed in the manner suggested, the action proposed will not necessarily pre vent his entering Aden or the Yemen. So far as Aden is concerned, it may perhaps deter Mr. Bailey from making further visits, since he will be liable to expulsion if he is found there. On the other hand, if in spite of the action taken by the Passport Office, it proves impossible to secure Mr. Bailey’s passport for the proposed endorsement and he finds his way back to Aden, the Aden authorities have power to make the necessary entry upon it. With regard to the Yemen, His Majesty’s Government will have done all in their power to prevent his entering that country, and if by chance he should succeed in doing so, the Yemeni author ities are, of course, entitled to expel him. The Resident at Aden will presumably, if he sees fit, inform the Yemeni authorities of the action taken by His Majesty’s Government in this matter. 4. Sir John Simon will be glad to be informed whether Sir Philip Cunliffe- Lister desires action to be taken by the Passport Office in the sense outlined iu paragraph 2 above.

Very many thanks for your letter of May 22nd about Mr. K. S. Twitched s activities in prospecting for gold in Arabia. 1 recollect quite distinctly the earlier secret information regarding the matter. 2. Apart from this, the only information which I have about Twitchell’s pre sent activities here is that I believe he is addressing a small meeting of m Central Asian Society, to be held in their offices in Grosvenor Street, but as 1 have' lost the ticket, I fear that I cannot state on what date this meeting is to take place Probably, however, some member of your Department belongs to the ei y ra Asian Society and either attended the meeting, or will know when it is to taka place. 3.

There were, indeed, indications that the so-called mine had been ‘ salted ’ 4 On the other hand we have a certain amount of information about gold miniog on the other side of the Red Sea, near Port Sudan. As long ago as May 1931 Turner (then Commercial Secretary to the Residency) wrote to me to the -4- y-x I I -v'» 4 +/y/Yi • following effect 5. Mr. A, Beeby Thompson, who had advised the Egyptian Government about oil, and the Sudan Government about water, told Turner that lie firmly believed there were really great possibilities about gold mining in various dis tricts between the Nile and the Red Sea. In the past the main practical difficulty in working these deposits was a shortage of water. Nowadays, with motor trans port, the question of water had become much simplified. Many of the workings which are marked as “ ancient sold workings ” in the general economic, atlackp ancient gold workings ” in the general economic atlas of Egypt presented to the International Geographical Congress at Cambridge i 1923 hv the Kiae* of Eewnt have, in ancient times, merely been seratehpd 1928 by the King of Egypt have, m ancient times, merely been scratched. Beeby Thompson believed that, with up-to-date mining machinery, good results could he obtained. 6. We have also a note which shows that a gold mine exists at Gebeit which, as you know, is not far from Port Sudan. A new cyanide plant was installed there in the autumn of 1933 and was supposed to be ready by March, 1934. In the autumn of 1933 one of five stamp batteries was already in operation and pro ducing about £2,000 worth of gold per month. There are also records of other small mines in the same neighbourhood. 7. To sum up,lhere is a good deal of evidence that gold does exist on the west coast of the Red Sea, hut there is no evidence whatever of heavy mineralisation in Arabia. Judging, however, from our experience in Western Abyssinia, the present high price of gold may very well tempt some of the bigger and entirely respectable gold mining companies, probably through an intermediary, to take some interest in Twitchell’s venture since there is a market for the shares—if nothing else—of these low-grade gold properties at present. 8. As soon as I hear anything further of any personalities concerned with the scheme, I will not fail to let yon know.

He replied cheerfully that it contained all they needed to work on. I did not pursue the subject and we went on to talk about oil, in lines which I reported at the time* As regards the ’Iraqi analogy, I kook Ydlibi to be referring to the ’Irak ■Currency Board and not to any bank. After my interview with him, I turned up page-128 of the general Report on ’Iraq for 1920-31 and page 26 of the Re port for Janmrry- —October, 1932. I gathered from those reports that the ’Iraqi Government contemplated in 1927 a State Bank, with a monopoly of note issue, but that this scheme was- abandoned in favour of the present Currency Board.

The steamers themselves are said to have been bought from or through, a certain Haji Khalil Tabbara, described as the pilgrim agent of Messrs. Gellatlv. Haukey &amp; Co. (Sudan), Ltd. of Beirut. 3. It is clear that the new company, while ostensibly a private concern, is in fact primarily a Government enterprise, representing the first attempt of the Saudi Government to enter the realms'of coninrsrcia. navigation. Indeed Slieykh Yusuf Yasin, while stressing the commercial character of the Company in con versation with me a few days ago, said that the Government had undertaken to guarantee any loss on working*. The Government may be encouragod^ in this venture by the success of the motor-car companies, which form a parallel instance 5 of semi private, Government-controlled concerns and which v ere originally in tended for Government transport but now carry-the bulk of the pilgrim-traffic; within the country. 4. It may be recalled in this connexion that in the latter part of King Hussein’s reign, the Hashimite Government acquired at least four small vessels of this type and employed them either for coastal- work or for transport of pilgrims, whom they sometimes forced to travel by them. Two or three of these vessels were attached in Egypt, I believe by order of a court, in satis faction of claims against them and efforts made by the Saudi Government to retrieve them after the fall of Jedda were unsuccessful.

With reference to your telegrams Nos. 9 and 10 of the 21st June (Enclo sures 1 and 2, ante), 1 have the honour to enclose a copy of a note (Enlcosure 3, ante) which 1 have addressed to the Saudi Government regarding the landing of R. A. F. Victoria aeroplane at Jubail on that date. I assumed for the purposes of my note that the landing was the involuntary result of inadvertence. 2. T take this opportunity of drawing attention to a statement in paragraph 26 of the Intelligence Report of the Political Agent, Bahrain for May 1st to 15th (F. No. 53-N.j34), that one of the flying boats employed in the recent reconnais sance of Qatar landed at Jinnah Island on or just after the 11th May. I presume that as I was not notified by telegraph of this landing, the flying boat did not actually enter Saudi territorial waters. In view, however, of the importance attached in the standing instructions to doing everything possible to obviate protests by the Saudi Government, I suggest for the consideration of the Air Officer Commanding that it might loe well to advise me of causes in which it as been necessary to land in the, immediate vicinity of Saudi territory, in order to enable me to meet, at once any Saudi: criticism. 3. I am sending a copy of this despatch to H. M. Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to whom I have already sent copies of Your Excellency’s telegrams under reference and of the enclosure of this despatch. (73) (Received on 25lh August 1934, with Political Secretary’s letter, No. 32, dated the 9th August 1934.) Enclosure in Foreign Office, covering letter, dated 3rd August 1934. Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 147?, dated the 14th May 1934. With reference to paragraph 9 of my despatch No. 133 of the 23th April, I have the honour to enclose herewith one copy of the Saudi Green Book, whhh was published in its complete form on the 29th April. It runs, as you will see, to over 200 pages of close print, and I cannot hope to forward a translation. I enclose a summary of the contents of the book. The plan of the principal chap ters is to nrovido a certain amount of explanation and comment in addition to the numbered documents which form the major portion. Numerous as these docu ments are they certainly do not contain anything like all the correspondence which has passed since 1927. I will give you one instance which is of present importance. On the 8th May Fuad first spoke to me of the possibility of peace on the basis of compliance by the Imam with Ibn Saud’s demands as formulated at the outset of the present hostilities, subject to certain “ guarantees,’^ which seemed io be of a formidable character, as they were to include a rectification of frontiers and an indemnity. I suggested, in a general way, to Fuad Bey Hi at, as the King had nersistently repeated his demands in their original form, it might be somewhat difficult to recede from the position that compliance with them was the only condition of peace. Fuad Bey gently reminded mo that a treaty of friendship had also to be concluded and said that any question oftesty’s Am' am ie 21 st Jk madvertew, dement iipit! nforMailsti IthMay, Ipi ie ^' r, l possible tub ideratifflofl. territory, ii si incipal Swlsf siditii ktkrji)' !rd August® jign 13 offte# li Green p : ; 50 added that a tele- u,, LPiSS^SShSifm'S'SfJff; 'Vr;“~ t r, ”'w&gt; tin; J.ansi, tt.e exact nature ot whiS hi ton5 b in Ib “ Sa ' U a “ d enclose a rough translation of this agreemeiit hut T u:i;iect ot speculation.

The title ^ Imam ” has become so closely associated in European language with the Imam Yahya that it may not be out of place to remind vo2 that it is borne equally by ibn Sand as Imam of the Wahabis and by the Id'risi as the religious head of lus own adherents. It has often, in the past been applied to them foul court, with results that are nowadays somewhat confusing. rl , 4 ; kT 11 bo . seen from . tlle enclosed translation that the first Saudi-Idrisi Ireaty did not m any precise sense establish frontiers. What it did was to lake account of the ancestral claims of Ibn Sand, founded on the early expan sion ol \\ahabi and the more recent expansion of the Idrisi, whose pretensions, it not his actual occupation, extended to areas far greater than his dominion in the Tihama of A sir. The effect of the agreement was to partition the total area which both might claim, but much more with reference to tribes and their ranges than to geographical features. I need not pursue the analysis further at present. 1 'would point out, however, that, unless a treaty in modern form between Ibn Baud and the Imam Yahya relegates all past arrangements to limbo, the agreement of 1920 may still have importance in connexion with the compli cated question of Ibn Sand’s titles. 5. Next in interest is the account given of the negotiations between Ibn Sand and the Imam Yahya in 1927-28 and the settlement of the Arwa question in 1931. The story of the tw r o missions which Ibn Sand sent to Sana in 1927 and the Yemeni missions which came to Mecca in 1928 becomes much clearer than it has hitherto been. The telegrams between the Imam and Tbn Sand which produced the latter’s award giving Arwa to the Imam are still of interest. The most important points are perhaps the following :— {a) When the first Saudi mission went to Sana they were confronted with a Yemeni claim to the whole of A sir, as having always been Yemeni, despite Idrisi occupation. The Saudi mission counterclaimed the whole country as far as Mokha and Zehid and inland to Bajil, as having been Idrisi, and denied all Yemeni claims in A sir. It is not astonishing that no agreement was reached. (5) Chapter III contains proces-verbaux of meetings held during the vi-it of the second Saudi mission to Sana. If trustworthy, they hear out the recent Saudi contention that an oral agreement of sorts was reached in the course of two meetings, as stated in Mr. Zada’s letter to Mr. Rendel of the 28th July, 1933. It is less important to try to ascertain the effect of that agreement, roue of the versions of which quite agree in terms, than to record the fact that it was clearly a status quo arrangement only. The best of several proofs of this is that, when sending his own mission immediately afterwards to Mecca, the Imam wrote a letter to Ibn Sand In which he described his object as being to convince the King of his claim to “ what is in the hands of the Idrisi...... too'pther with ell that is counted as of Khaulan-bin-Amr and Hamdan-bm- Zeyd.” This, I think, can be taken as a restatement of his demands ot the pi e- viems year, though it is difficult to estimate 1 the territorial scope of ceman^s in regard to the interior, defined 'with reference to the names of tribal arcesov. (a) The Imam’s mission to Mecca accomplished absolutely nothing ayd though the status quo went on it might well he argued that whatever ya r 1 -\ _ had was impaired or destroyed bv the failure of the negotiatiors m re corrs, °f which it was more or less defined. The Imam does not, hovm er, seei have taken this line. He hided his time until he advanced to Arwa.51 ( r i\ - rhe Arwa incident led to a fresh meeting of delegations As you are W ^ / a A^rUook over territorial quesnons and the Imain iett tne mX r«i a^tr Saud. The King’s telegram of the 22nd ita^ l He m December, ml), giving his awam, is precise only m tne phrase : •^1 sly that i abandon Jebel Arwa to your Honour It is, however clear from the corrosr.ondnce that other specific areas had been discussed mcludmg IhatVi the Beni Malik and Jebel Fifa, and the Imam m his reply ot tne 2;th ■Roiab 1350 (the 8th December, 1931), said that he had instructed Ins delegates not'to' pursue the question of that particular area. This goes ar to justify Dm Sand’s resentment at the Imam’s recent interference m the area in ques tion but the correspondence is in other respects ambiguous. Tne editor o ” (lieen Book setuns hardly justified m stating that the Imam’s telegram constitutes a complete recognition of the frontier by the Imam, subject only to T m ,.ost of consideration of a proposal ot his m regard to two named tabes. From a European point of view the upshot of the Arwa dispute can only be re garded as obscure/except as regards Arwa itself and perhaps the Bern Malik- Fii’a area. (e) Immediately after the settlement of the Arwa question, the delegates s ioned a Treaty of Friendship, &amp;c., dated the 15th December, 1931. It was noted at!be time that this treaty made no reference to frontiers It has always been doubtful whether the Imam regarded it as a treaty at all, although the baudi Government stated later that it had been ratified by an exchange of telegram jt n ow appears from the texts of these as published m the Green Book that Ibn Baud’s telegram expressed a straightforward approval of what his delegates lad agreed to, but the Imam’s telegram could be read eitner as an approval or a* a postponement pending further discussion. On the face of it, it looks line an approval, but he asked the King to send his delegates again to discuss out standing minor points. 6 Chapters VI to XIII relate to the most recent phase beginning about the end of August 1932, when, after delay due to various causes, including the Ibn Rif a da revolt, the King again turned his attention seriously to bis rela tions with the Imam. I have not had the whole of these chapters translated, as you are familiar with the main course of events and the result of all the nego tiations, including the King’s suggestion for a sort of alliance, has been negatived so far as any agreements of permanent effect are concerned. 7. I have not yet had time to study Chapter XIV, which deals with the Yam and with Najrau. The divergence of views regarding these has been so complete and both parties are, to my mind, on such weak ground that I do not expect the documents to prove of much use either way, but, if I find them to be of sufficient interest, I will submit a further report on them at leisure. 8. The Imam Yahya is a master of obscure language. Ibn Sand is more capable of precision, but can be equally obscure on occasion. They both, as you know, overlay most of what thev say with blankets of pious verbiage. I trust, therefore, that you mil make allowance for the imperfection of this despatch, which I have prepared at a time of great pressure from rough translations ot highly peculiar texts. T have endeavoured to isolate the points which seem to have most hearing on the present dispute, in case the recent happy turn of events should result in a rational general settlement free from the ambiguities ot the past, 9. In this connexion I would revert to my despatch No. 1 of the 2nd January relative to the possibility of a Saudi claim to Hudevda and connected mattery In that despatch I expressed the view that a study of historical events since lo t - might he a useful contribution to an examination of the claims and counter-claims of the two rulers. I have found that to he really useful such a study, should go much further hack, and, while I have collected a good deal of material, I h^ e found it Quite impossible to complete and collate it. The most I can hope to do is to produce at some future time a paper of some historical interest, even though a settlement between Ibn Sand and the Imam should deprive it ot practical utility. 10. In the meanwhile the facts which I have collected are of use in sliapum mv own views. If I were revising mv despatch No. 1 of 2nd January, I slimm amend it in various particulars. I should not, however, alter my view tlun Ibn Baud has a good case for claiming both ports of A sir : that he would have a vorv r&gt;oor case for claiming as against the Imam, on historical or local grovnes. the littoral beyond a point somewhere not far south of the Wadi Tashar ; an52 that neither he nor the Imam has anv stfonD’ nlnim at * • local tribes. As regards Hudeyda, I find myself supDorterl bv^Ti^ 8 agail ^ t t . lie than Ibn Sand himself, -who, in the conversation feported^n Sir ^“ n despatch of the 16th July, 1928 to the Colonial Office eald : ‘‘ That h ^uld clear right“r “ P ° SSeSS10n ° f Hude y da ‘ to which he recognised the InWs , T . sending a,pies of this despatch and the English enclosures to His Majesty s Ambassador at Rome and the Chief Commissioner at Aden * Enclosure 1 in No. 1.

Ls296FD53 Mav it be known to Mm who sees and reads this that when the Imam Abdul Aziz'bfn-Ahdurrahman-al-Feysal, may God protect Mm, ordered us to go to the Imam Mnhammad-bin-Ali-bin-Idris to conclude an agreement of particular Mamie brotherhood and to bring about union m the religion of God and His Pronhet and to invite people to collaborate in good deeds and piousness, to cause good manners to be carried ont and evils prohibited, to strive m the Course of the Cause of God and to endeavour to unite the hands against the enemies of the religion When we approached the above-mentioned Imam he was glad and nleased to hear it. He liked it and he was keen about collaboration in working for the welfare. It was, therefore, decided by ns and him to have an agreement of brotherhood concluded between the two above-mentioned Imams on the above- mentioned lilies. Whereas there were in the kingdom (? territory) of the Imam Muhaimnad-bin-Ali tribes and cities in Yemen of those which were in the past belonging to A1 Sand, the Imam Abdul Aziz has left them for him because of his desire for the welfare and collaboration in the same and his good behaviour. It is therefore, necessary, to specify the tribes and to distinguish them in order that each one of them may undertake the duties commanded by God in respect of the subjects under him. ‘ So the tribes of all Yam, Wadaa and those which belong to them of Beni Jamaa, Sahar, Sharif, Qahtan, Rufeyda and Ubeyda, including Beni Bishr, Beni Talq, Shahran, Beni Shehr, Ghamid, Asir Ghamid, and all “ Qadha ” (province) of Mahayel, including Beni Thua, people of Bareq and Tarqash, people of Ar Rish, and others wdio belong to them, and all the tribes of Hali mentioned are all under the Imam Abdul Aziz. Those belonging to the Imam Muhammad-bin-Ali-al-Idrisi are Tihama, except what is mentioned above, and other belongings in his possession. Rijal-al-Ma of Asir is his own property. Neither party should interfere in affairs of the subjects of the other party. The tribes of the Surat, Tihama, Yam and others mentioned above as belonging to Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdurrahman cover the villages and the Bedouins in mountains and plain lands. They have to advise and collaborate with each other, and to exert their endeavours in performing their duties commanded by God as to what is necessary for the religion of Islam and in respect of their subjects. This has been issued, written and declared by us, the representa tives of the Imam, as we are acting on his behalf, and by the Imam Muhammad- bin-Ali-bin-Idris, in his presence and under his signature. This agreement and covenant has been given by us and him. He wdio goes back on his word will be violating his own promise. May God grant us success. Prayers and peace of God may be upon Muhammad, his relatives and friends. 16th Dhnl Hijja, 1388 (31st August, 1920). (Seal.) MUHAMMAD-BIN-ALI-BIN-IDRIS.

On arrival, a native, who stated he was the “ harbour master ” came off and said they had not been notified of our visit (actually the' letter announcing our arrival was brought to us from Mukalla) and that His Highness the Sultan was in the hills. ^ I accordingly arranged to meet the Sultan ashore at lb-00 that afternoon, which was done. 40. The. Sultan had nothing to report and had not been visited bv any other warships or merchant ships. I particularly asked him if any Italians had visited Socotra, which he said was not so. I did this as, at Aden I was told that sometime ago Italians from Somaliland had been there and were thought to be surveying. The Sultan and his following are of a level of civili sation similar to the Sheik at Sharjah. The usual courtesies were exchanged in the Audience House, at which I was received with a series of detonations on arrival by the guard firing their rifles. I asked the Sultan if he would like to visit the ship but he excused himself as it was getting late. 41. After giving a searchlight display, the ship left for Lamu at 20-10. Just prior to leaving, His Highness the Sultan sent off a present of two live sheep, for which I returned a present of tea, sweets and cigarettes. I also gave the “ harbour master ” a small present in reply to his request for “ bac Sheesh ”, the only word of practical value he seemed to know. I took a letter for the Sultan for transmission to Aden. (75) Memorandum from the Foreign Office, No. E.-5102|2429|25, dated the 11th August 1934.

With reference to Mr. Hope Gill’s despatch No. 213 of the 18th May, 1932, relative to the constitution of this country, I have the honour to state that the Umm-al-Qura of the 22nd June published a “ High Decree ” sanctioning a re organisation of the Ministry of the Interior. I enclose herewith a translation of the first three articles of this measure, the remainder of which deals merely with consequential details of merely transitory importance. 2. The Regulation of the Council of Ministers of the 19th Sha’aban 1350 [Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (1) in File No. 132-N.I32], to which reference is made in the second article of the measure, is doubtless that which formed the enclosure to Mr. Hope Gill’s despatch No. 118 of the 5th March 1932, and the departments formerly attached to the Ministry of the Interior would appear to be those specified in Article 17 of that measure. This regulation has, however, so far as I am aware, never previously borne this particular date. Mr. Hope Gill’s attempts to ascertain its date, as recorded in the note No. 1518|256jl0 addressed by Jedda Chancery to the Eastern Department on the 25th May 1932 succeeding merely in attaching to the measure its date of publication, the 15th January 1932. 3. As you are aware from previous correspondence the Amir Feysal holds permanently the post of President of the Council and Minister of the Interior as well as that of Minister for Foreign Affairs. The sole object of the new decree would appear to be to simplify a system of administration, wdiich turns so largely on his personal position and perhaps to make it working more economical by reducing personnel.

It may interest you to have a fuller account of this episode. 2. As reported in Mr. Calvert’s despatch No. 359 of the 12th December fSerial No. (13)], M. Maigret and Fuad Bey started on the 11th December, two days before my own return to Jedda. Thev reached Riyadh on the morning the 15th December and left again on the 1.8th December, getting back to Jedda and Mecca respectively on the 21st December. 3. M. Maigret lay very low, as his custom is, until the 27th December. On that dav a telephone message from me asking whether he had returned elicite the offer of a visit. When he came, he first gave me some interesting general impressions. He contrasted Sana, a place where one merely got bac o ie Middle Ages, with Riyadh, which might be a Babylonian city of 5,000 or 6,000 years ago all sun-dried bricks and silence, in a setting of illimitable desei . 4. T observed presently that M. Maigret’s journey had been the subject of much comment. In order to draw him out, I cited, hal -jes mg y, that a Saudi prince was to sit on the Syrian throne, tha _ ^ego ia i g the Hejaz Railway were in progress, or that France was intervening m the q rel between Ibn Sand and the Imam Yahya. 5. M. Maigret endorsed my own sceptical comments s “ and proceeded to tell me, with an air of great fra nlaces. He had a the whole truth. He had a passion for visiting on ,-o - • 1 pru (Government great sympathy for this country. He !Dtended to w n e a . invitation of had authorised him to go to Riyadh, and he ha oon , European Ibn Sand. He had undoubtedly talked politics with the King, b J ^ politics.

Maigret’s adventure. I trotted out the same three rumours, with much the same comments as before, and added a vague reference to suggestions that the French Government might be prepared to give some kind of material assistance to Ibn Sand. Fuad Bev expatiated on M. Maigret’s love of travel, his desire to write a book and his great friendliness towards this country and Islam. He dealt systematically with my collection of rumours. There was no present question, he said, of a Saudi candidature for the Syrian Throne. There could be no such question so long as the French were committed to a policy in Syria which turned out cm its having a republican constitution, and any modification of which would raise complicated questions, among them that of securing the assent of the League of Nations. If the Saudi Government reopened the question of the Hejaz Railway, as they had it in their minds to do, they would approach His Majesty’s Government in the first instance. All that had happened so far was that his own replies to interviewers in Euypt had had a repercussion in Syria, where he had been asked many ques- tions^and been led to engage in very general conversations of an informal kind. He dismissed more briefly any idea of French intervention in the quarrel with the Imam. 8. Fuad Bey went on to say that there was, none the less, a business side to M Maigret’s journey. After obtaining my promise that wdiat he was about to say would be regarded as highly confidential, he explained that when he was in Paris with the Amir Feisal in the spring of last year, certain questions had been broached. Conditions in Paris made it impossible to pursue them at that time. The French had tried later to communicate with him at The Hague and Berlin, but he was already in Moscow when they got into touch with him. Skipping a long interval, he said that eventually the French Government had charged M. ^Maigret to communicate their vie^vs on the desiderata put forward by the Saudi mission last year. They related to war material, a loan and a mission to help with military organisation and the Saudi air force. It had been decided to invite M. Maigret to convey the French reply to the King at Riyadh. 9. Fuad Bey was much less precise as to the messages which my French colleague had brought. His language generally, rather than any definite state ment, implied that the negotiations were approaching a happy dose. As I have stated in my telegram under reference, he mentioned financiers, and not the French Government, as the providers of the prospective loan, and he said that the mission, though recruited under the auspices of the French Government, would be of a civilian character. 10. Fuad Bey assured me more than once that these dealings with the French implied no departure from his Government’s policy of friendship with His Majesty’s Government. He reminded me lightly and amiably of their failure to obtain from British sources the help they needed. I said that we could not criticise the action of the Saudi Government in cultivating French friendship, and begged him to believe that my desire for information v T as inspired by interest and not by jealousy. I did not comment otherwise on his statement, except for a passing remark, when he mentioned the proposed military mission, that I thought the Saudi Government had been looking to Turkey about a year ago for this kind of assistance. Fuad Bey replied, with a slight and perhaps unintentional lapse from strict accuracy, that there had only been a question of sending young men to be trained in that country. 11. Assuming Fuad Bey’s explanation to have been generally in accordance with the facts, and he was not only more precise but also more convincing than my French colleague, it remains to be seen what advantages the French Governmen expect in return for their benevolence. I have no means of obtaining information on this subject. My general view is that there will be little reason for perturba tion, even if the negotiations do in fact produce concrete results. Despite my regard and admiration for Ibn Saud, I have still to discover that, in his dealing 8 with European Povoers or commercial interests, he ever gives much that is solid or of durable value for what he receives. 1 have never thought, for instance, mat a Power providing an air force can hope for much of a “ cinch ” on the air ot ^am Arabia. 12. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s representatho in Paris and His Majesty’s consular officers at Beirut and Damascus,17 (23) (Received on 10th March 1934 with Political Secretary’s letter No 8 dated the 22yd February 1934 .) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 19th February 1934. Letter from H. M/s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 16 (172112413), DATED THE 23rd JANUARY 1934. With reference to my telegram No. 2, saving of January 11 [Serial No. (8)], yiave the honour to state that on January 22, Mr. Philby related to me in confidence a conversation he had recently had with Abdul-Hamid Bey Shedid about his new proposals for the creation of a State Bank in this country. Shedid stated that he was now representing J. S. Bartho lomew and Company, affirm with an address in (!) Berkeley Square, who had formed a company under the name of the Hejaz Development Company, with a small capital of which £15,000 was paid up. The registration of this company was so recent that Shedid had only heard by telegraph after his arrival here on January 9 that the formalities had actually been completed. He gave the names of certain directors, but as Mr. Philby was not sure of these and as we could not identify two knightly names, which he thought he remembered, I refrain from reproducing them. Indeed I would ask you to regard all the details in this despatch as being open to doubt, as I write from memory of what Mr. Philby told me from his own memory of a conversation. 2 The promoters hoped, according to Shedid, to interest considerable per sons In London, like Viscount Goschen (Westminster Bank), Lord Gleneonner, ffir E Mountain (presumably the insurance magnate) and a Mr. Brown of Andrew Weir and Company. Fie did not, however, represent their support as assured. 3 The scheme propounded by Shedid was to create a Bank on the same lines those nroiected, when he was'acting or professing to act for the e^-Khechve ost year with the exception that the loan of £200,000 gold was to be paid m two rmJs i e £50 000 when the concession was granted and the balance at some later V. ’ mb’ o- r ’ 0 im sought in return various concessions including the construc tion of a port at Jedda, the reconditioning of the railway to Medina, road-builc- jng an d any other industrial objects which might be available, e.g., gold-mming. 4 Mr Philby is one of those who were deceived by Shedid last year and were disappointed of the hopes to which he gave rise His present attitude tlnueforT^i^oneof interest combined with much scepticism. He said he had theretore is^ ^ WO nder, if on this occasion he found the Saudi told Shedid that he coma | Ms credentials before they entertained Government anxious to be assuieu attractive enough. He when Sliedid asked whether he, Mr. Philby, himself believed in him. i 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade and to the Acting High Commissioner at Ca .

Enclosure in Foreign Office, covering letter, dated 22nd February 1934. Letter from H. M.'s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 20 (189|106|3), bated the 25th January 1934. Mv attention has been drawn to the desirability of elucidating the facts con- nected with the alleged murder of certain Su’udi state prisoners, induing Ibn Hithlain and Ibn Lami, in view of the rumours reproduced in recent Kuwait In telligence Summaries, notably that for October. As you are aware, I have no means whatsoever of investigating such a matter here but when Mr. Calvert drew mv attention to the reports on my return from leave, I agreed with him that they deserved careful attention. I may say, however, with great deference to Colonel Dickson’s greater knowledge of Arabian life, that I thought it un like] v that Ibn Sa’ud would break his word in a matter of this kind and equally unlikely that he would challenge the hostility of important sections of the Ajinan, Mutair and Ateyba tribes at a time when he was so deeply embroiled in his difficulties with the Imam Yahya. 9 l n these circumstances, I decided to put a straight question to Fuad Bey Hamza as soon as I could do so orally. P told him on December 29th, that, while I did not normally attach importance to such rumours, those regarding the three prisoners in question were so positive and so persistent as to suggest malicious invention or distortion of something that had happened. I whs not myself, I said, ready to believe that the King would authorise the execution of men whose lives he had pledged himself to respect. On the con- trarv I was concerned, as a friend, for His Majesty’s credit and prefered to inquire at once in that capacity rather than await instructions to investigate the matter as being one of legitimate interest to His Majesty’s Government. 3. Fuad Bey reminded me, quite justly, that the King’s pledge did not applv to Ibn Humaid (Sultan ibn Bujad) whose name I had mentioned with the others. He begged me to believe that the King was incapable of breaking his promise but he undertook to inquire into the facts. On January 19th he con veyed to me the King’s assurance that Ibn Lami and Ibn Hithlain were alive, and told me in reply to an inquiry, which I expressly put as a matter ot curiosity, that Ibn Bujad was also alive. Having received in the meantime Colonel Dickson’s report for December, which cast doubt on the original murder story, I said to Fuad Bey that I now had reason to believe, that the three Shevkhs had been removed to Hofuf and thought that this might have given rise to the first reports. Fuad Bey promised to inquire further. On January 24th, when I reverted to the matter, he renewed the King’s asurrance that the men’were alive but said that His Majesty begged to be excused, for reasons of internal policy, from disclosing their whereabouts. 4. I do not feel that I can pursue the matter further, unless you consider that the precise nature of the treatment of Ibn Hithlain and. Ibn Lami is a matter of such moment to His Majesty’s Government as to justify them m c . a11 ' nig the King to account for his harshness, on the strength of rumours, wine, however probable, cannot be proved. Such action might outrage him so grea y as to produce a definite coolness between him and His Majesty’s Governmen. I am not myself in favour of it and I do not think it would in any w T ay he p _ two Sheykhs. I cannot doubt the King’s formal assurance that they are a_ I have little doubt that they have been in fact removed to Hofuf and I oe Ibn Jiluwi, the Governor of Hasa, to be a cruel gaoler, but I do nut thin even Ibn Jiluwi would murder these men in defiance of . the King in opinion, what I have already done wall at least suffice to remind Ibn M ua His Majesty’s Government are not indifferent to the fate of Ibn Hithlain Ibn Lami. t , 5. I took an opportunity in the course of my conversations with a Bey Hamza of suggesting that the King might well, after this lapse o ^ er g relax his severity and treat these prisoners in the same way as ™ aT1 ^ ^ who are kept under a sort of open arrest at Riyadh. I cannot be sti , Fuad Bey would pass this on to the King, but I think the best hepeimy ^ unfortunate men is that, when his present troubles are ended, Ibn relent somewhat. He has already shown signs of anxiety to disarmamong the Ajman and Mutair. As for n™ nr •, „ taneously that appeals had been made f n Fl 1 , ? d Be y told me spon- been successful. He added that Ibn HummVl on t hls behalf ba t had not rather a ample soul.

Half the mil was paid at the time bnt half remained outstanding. The figures given then and now do not quite tally but Mr. Philby confirms Sir M.

I gather p a r nri 811 ^ 3 lerS were a consortium of Polish arms factories, in which the i olish Government are interested. They have tried more than once to get paid, always without success. Y According to Mr. Philby, the Sa ’udi Government are now desirous of obtaining a very large quantity of arms and ammunition from the same group. nT e ^! d , me a fcw T days ago in one of our usual confidential conversations that M. \\ ilniewczyc had taken away with him for submission to his principals a pro posal that, in consideration of receiving £7,000 or £8,000 as a payment on account or the old debt, the Poles should supply further arms, etc., to the value of £100,000. The aggregate of this new debt and the balance of the old would then oe paid off in instalments by means of irrevocable drafts on customs. I gather Horn earlier conversations with Mr. Philby that there may also be a question of reorganising the Government workshop at Mecca but he has not recently men tioned this. I also gather that Sharqieh Limited would come into the business m some way, presumably as agents. 5- I cannot be certain whether the above second or third hand account of w hat is proposed is accurate. Personally I think that the Poles would be fools to embark on so risky a transaction but much would depend on the nature of the drafts on customs, if they took the shape of orders to pay periodical sums out of current revenue, the business, though still risky, might be worth considering.

I am somewhat disquieted, however, to learn that the Department has doubts as to the confidence which would be inspired in financial circles bv the persons named in the second sentence of my telegram No. 13 of January 25. I fear that I myself regarded those persons as.being_of unquestionable standing in the business world and that in my conversations with Sheykh ’Abdullah Suleyman, I urged the importance of making sure that the Corporation had really got their backing rather than the importance ot investi gating their titles to confidence. 4. Mr Philby mentioned one point of interest, which I gather he had learnt Saudi circles. . This was that Sheykh Hafiz Wahba had been m touch with Mr. Beckett, who is, I understand, the Chairman of the Westminster Bank. 5. ’Abdul Hamid Bey Shedid left Jedda on February 21.

No dhows were met. At this time of the year, due to weather conditions dhow traffic practically ceases in the Southern end of the Red Sea except for coastal trade inside the reefs. Trade in dates from the Persian Gulf, which is considerable, has only just commenced and cargoes are conveyed in larger dhows than are usualy en countered in this locality. 5.

He was, however, able to join the Mission later, flying’to Kamaran, thence by dhow to the Mainland and motor car to Sana. 12. A portable R. A. F.

It had also been hoped to obtain permission from the Iman for aeroplanes to land at Sana and thus maintain more direct touch, but this was retused. 13 The Resident arranged to leave for Sana at 07-00 on the following morn ing, stopping for one night on the way. The road has recently been unproved and the journey can actually be done in a day. The negotiations were ex P , to take until towards the end of January it was not thought that much wo be accomplished until after expiration of Ramadan 16th January. Proceeded at noon on 17th December, information having been received that the Mission had started their journey according to plan—-a creditable tea an Arab country on the part of the Transport Officer.

Aden .—On arrival at Aden on 19th January, news was received that pro bable date of embarkation of the Sana Mission would be 21 th January, whic i necessitated the proposed cruise to Socotra and Kishn being cancelled. Later the date was further postponed to 3rd February and it was possible to cany out a modified cruise as far as Mukalla.From information received, it is believed that the treaty negotiations with the Iman have been entirely successful and Colonel Reilly is only waiting for evacuation of Protectorate Territory by the Iman’s followers before signing the treaty. The evacuation is going forward though more slowly than was expected. An amusing report was received at the Residency from the Political Clerk (Arab) at Hodenla, announcing that on successful completion of the negotiations the Iman ordered his band to play “ all day ” outside Colonel Reilly’s house “ much to the inconvenience of the Russian and Italian Consul who lived next door.” He did not express Colonel Reilly’s views, but these may be left to the imagination. * #****♦# 9. Mukalla. —Proceeded for Mukalla early on 26th January, carrying out six monthly full power trial a. m. and arriving the following day in a mild sand storm. His Highness the Sultan of Shihr and Mukalla was in residence but in disposed and suffering from a cold. He sent his Wazir, Seyyid Bubakar Husein to present his compliments with a request that calls should be dispensed with and invited the Commanding Officer and two Officers to tea. The Sultan is partially of Indian descent and has estates in Hyderabad where he spends most of his time. He is a large unhealthy looking individual reputed to take little interest in improving Mukalla while converting most of the revenue to his own use and is naturally unpopular with his subjects. ******** 13. Political Situation. — Saudi-Arabia-Yemen. Further conference of Saudi-Arabian (headed by Fuad) and Yemeni delegates is probable and should take place about middle of February. While outbreak of hostilities at any moment is feared by the Saudi Government, con fidence in a peaceful solution is expressed by the Iman’s Ministers. Owing to suspicious attitude of Yemenis, Saudi troops have advanced to Samta in Asir and have fortified mountain posts. Military preparations are continuing on both sides.

With reference to my despatch No. 56 of February 27 [Serial No. (33) j, I have the honour to state that I had occasion to call on the Saudi Minister of Finance on March 11 and took the opportunity of speaking to him further about the Hejaz Development Corporation/Ltd. I said that the further informa tion 1 had received since onr last interview added little that was material to what I had then told him, but that it certainly confirmed the view that the com position of the Corporation was not such as to inspire much confidence. I then explained that the registration of a company in England was a mere formality, by which any group of persons could invest themselves with a corporate exist ence, and meant nothing more. 2. Sheykh ’Abdullah Suleyman said that the Government had not wished to leave the telegram, which he had shown me on February 11, unanswered. They had, therefore, expressed readiness to receive proposals from any properly authorised person. ’Abdul Hamid Bey Shedid had not been able to get any thing definite from the Corporation before he left Jedda, but had since telegraphed that they were sending a representative who was expected lo arrive in Egypt on March 12 or 13. The Saudi Government had not replied to this telegram. 3. The Minister of Finance mentioned that, apart from their information from His Majesty’s Government, the Saudi Government had had anfavouiable accounts of the persons concerned in the Corporation from ^ ier 3 ? 1 } rces ' A; gave me the impression of being quite wary. I gather from 1 i. hi w, w 0 doubtless one of the other sources mentioned in the fiist sen eioe o ls j - na ' graph, if not the only one, that the reason for not answering the latest ele. ram from ’Abdul Hamid Shedid is that the Government do not ccmsidei Aat - complies with the terms on which they had expressed rear mess (■ posals.

The earlier ulrt of tne conversation related to oil concessions and 1 have reported separately wnat Mr. Ydlibi said to me on that subject. o -i i iave embodied in the enclosed record a few general observations of my own'' 1 mav add here that Mr. Ydlibi impressed me very unfavourably at this, meeting* with him. I should say that the Saudi Government, ignorant 'hhe; a” Ot the intricacies of finance, would find it very difficult to control tne operations of gentlemen so astute as Mr. Ydlibi himself and his local repre sentative Mr. ’Aw?yni. They might find it far from easy to limit the volume of the note issue and they would almost certainly be incapable ot coping with the mysteries of foreign exchanges. 3' I do not feel competent to express any view of the feasibility of the pro- Wt in itself I do not know for instance enough of the arrangements m force in Iraq to judge whether the anlogy suggested by Mr. Ydkbi is sound and whe ther it would be practical to combine ordinary banking with the tunctions of a currency board. 1 am also puzzled as to what working capital would be aval able for the banking business, if the whole of the subscribed capital were immobilised to secure the note issue. Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (47). Memorandum by Sir Andrew Ryan, dated the 19th March 1934. After speaking about other matters, separately recorded, Mr. ’Abdul Ghani Ydlibi explained to Mr. Furlonge and myself on March 17 the hank scheme which he said he was propounding to the Saudi ijovernment. The scheme is to create a Rank with, a capital of £1,000,000 sterling. The Saudi Government would put up half of this (or £550,000, Mr. Ydlibi threw m) and a British bank the other half. This capital would be applied to the purchase of British War Loan, to be deposited in the Bank of England. The Bank would issue notes on a sterling basis, which would be the only currency in this country—- apparently a forced currency. Such notes would be issued up to the hunt ot the capital ; not beyond. All Government receipts would be paid into the Bank and it would conduct all transactions in foreign currencies. I asked (a) whether Mr. Ydlibi had reason to think that the Saudi Govern ment could put up the proposed share of the capital ; and (b) whether he was assured of the support of a bank in Great Britain as regards the other half. As regards (a) Mr. Ydlibi said that the Government would doubtless have to make its contribution hv stages. Mr. Furlonge understood him to sav that if they could not find all or some of the money, ttm British partners would lend it to them at interest, an important point which I missed. As regards (b) Mr. Ydlibi said that he had not yet enlisted the support, but he anticipated no difficulty. The business would be perfectly secure, as the capital would be held by the Bank of England. I tried to elucidate the position .which would be created as regards general banking. Mr. Ydlibi clearly contemplated that the Bank would have a monopoly of all banking and foreign exchange business. He was less clear as to whether this would result from the attractions it would offer or from the establishmen of a legal monopoly. I suggested that in the latter contingencv, it would require a very strong financial police to enforce the monopoly and that it would mean ousting two established interests, viz., the Dutch Bank and Messrs. Leila y Hankey and Company, a British concern. - u i ' J ^ V^J Mr. Ydlibi said that the Saudi Government would gain (a) by having a stable and secure monetary svstem on a sterling basis and (b) bv receiving a half R * r of the profils of the Bank. He said that the scheme was similar to tbM \v had been adopted in ’Iraq and which had vielded a profit of some £100,W 1932 ‘ . I asked whether the Saudi Government were to get a loan. He rmhiM a definite negative and said that he had made this quite clear to the Saudi ernment. Mr. Ydlibi said that the Minister of Finance had approved the soheme. ^ seemed to hope that this, like his oil concession, might go through be o leaves Jedda on March 21.refr^from ^ ^ I ment would m present circumstances jump at any scheme 1 t 1 lle /q .

A present to the Ship of bullocks, sheep, poultry, coffee, fruit and vege tables was sent off by the Yemeni Government. Space in the cold storage did not, hov/ever, allow of the retention of the bullocks, which in bovine ignorance of the narrowness of their escape, were therefore returned to the shore, accom panied by a suitable letter of explanation and thanks, composed by the Mission Interpreter. The sheep, less bulky, and hence less fortunate, were slaughtered in the dhow by a Somali Stoker. 16. The work and achievements of the Mission have formed the subject of a separate Report In one matter only do they appear to have met with refusal, when a tentative proposal for the establishment of a Landing Ground though not on the San’A plateau—was put forward. This proposal was strongly discouraged by Qadhi Mahummad Bey (Minister for Foreign Affairs), who explained the Imam’s great aversion to this form of “ exploitation ”, adding that he had previously refused similar requests from the Italian authorities roi Ah taci- lities at Medi and Saliff (on the mainland, opposite to Ivamaian Island).Men 2% H . M . S . Penzance arrived at Aden at 0900 on 17th February. No dhow traffic had been observed south of Kamaran. Colonel « - rr^B^rte Marbut 'Battery 6 approaclied the'anchorage, and an escort of one Flight from No. 8 Squadron flew ^’'on^honng, the Acting Resident (Lieut.Colonel H M Wightwick), the Officer Commanding' the British I orces (Group Captain 0.

Anti-Slavery Operations. 21 At 1615 of the 21st, the following telegram from the Go\ eminent Agent, Perim, was passed to Penzance by the Chief Commissioner— Please inform H. M. S. Penzance report received that 3 slaves awaiting shipment at Jebel Siyan by dhow Fateh el Khair, nacoda Abdul Razack. or dhow owned by Sheikh Admed Anban of Sheikh Seyd. Embarking probably to-night. (Time of origin not stated.) Jebel Siyan (or Ras Siyan) is situated on the French Somaliland coast, 12 miles S. S. W. from Perim and 100 miles from Aden. 05 Although it was clear that the ship could not arrive in the vicinity of Perim until early on the following morning, it was decided to proceed to sea with all despatch (4|5th power), and the ship sailed at 2015, working up to H.a knots. This decision was based on the following facts : (a) No such positive information of slaving activities has been received in Penzance— nor, as far as. is known, m any other sloop—tor some years. fS {l) The name of the dhow and the persons quoted already figured on a “ suspect ” list in the ship. (c) The possibility existed that the dhow might be delayed in sailing until late at night, or might decide to remain at anchor off the Air coast until after moonset (0045). (d) Although fresh and favourable winds for the passage t’nnn th African coast are to he expected at this season, the possibility lighter winds and consequently of a slower passage could not ignored. 2C&gt;. The ship was darkened, and at 0300 passed through the small Steal, when the armed motor boat, was lowered in the lee of Perim Island am meneed a north-and-south patrol outside the limits of territorial waters in i approaches to Sheikh Seyd. Meanwhile Penzance proceeded to the north' , at 3!5th power until north of Dubab—a suspected landing place for slave tea m —when a sweep was made to the west and south. Nothing, however was ed, and the motor boat, which also had drawn blank, was picked up at uoau o 22nd. 27. The ship then entered Perim at 0730 to enable the Commanding to discuss the situation with the Government Agent, but immediately ^ anchoring a dhow, known to be similar to the Fath el Khair, was si* seaward/making to the east. The ship at once proceeded to sea, and the ing boat examined her, but much to the disappointment of all conceme , papers and a thorough search proved her innocence. 28. On return to harbour, Mr. Bavey stated that his informant was a tins^ worthy native of Suqiya (a village in the Protectorate) who, althougumary, the: ?■„ 5 ffe aiil|i&gt; Wed by || further Get.; uistratio^j rat 3 slaves 5iL' hair, naeii; ,ri of Sheitii not stated)' Somaliland c« ,ve in the K ed to prod i i working fir elayed nchor 35 conveyed reliable information on other subjects on previous occasions, had not before given any riave trade intelligence. It further transpired that the sus pected dhow had been m Penn, during the previous dav (21st), and'that aIt f vcn fl cl£ ' e °? 1 tha morning, she had in fact Remained in harbour until bGOO on the 22nd, when she had sailed, presumably for Ras giyan. Al though it was evidently possible that the presence of Penzance had become known to the nacoda, the chances to the contrary were felt to be sufficient to render desirable another night patrol, 29, After passing the day in harbour, the armed motor boat was accordingly directed to watch an area in the centre of the Small Strait (width about one mile) from 2200, while Penzance at the same time proceeded to patrol on a line east-west across the Large Strait, The S, S, E. wind, which had been Tight throughout the day, died away to light airs during the night, and by 0100 on the following morning (23rd), it became clear that, even should the wind subsequently freshen, the dhow could not make the passage under cover of darkness, and might therefore be counted upon to remain in harbour. The patrols were therefore abandoned, and the ship anchored off Perim until daylight. During the early morning a light northerly breeze sprang up, which, coupled with the fact that the ship’s presence in the vicinity was by now thoroughly advertised, destroyed any further prospects of success ; Penzance therefore pro ceeded at 0600 to Aden, arriving at 1600, 30. It is a curious coincidence that the information leading to these opera tions should have been received within a few hours of the despatch of Penzance’s submission referred to in paragraph 16, in which, in connection with the nego tiations with the Imam, it was stated thatmo recent evidence as to the continua tion of the Slave Trade r tcTTemem ports had come to the knowledge of Red Sea Sloops. In view of the Imam’s promised support in the suppression of this traffic, it now becomes increasingly important to produce proofs positive that the: Trade still exists, if only on a much reduced scale, in order that pressure may be applied to him through diplomatic channels to make good his undertakings. * # * * * , .&gt; ■ Djibouti, 35.

The approach to Jedda was made without difficulty and the ship anchored in the Inner Anchorage at 1100 on 18th November. The flag of the country was saluted with 21 guns, which was returned promptly by the shore Battery. 9. Colonel Hamdi Bey called and presented the compliments of the country. This officer fought in the Great War as a Lieutenant in the Turkish Army, and is now the Director of Military Training for the whole Kingdom of Sa’udi- Arabia. Though pleasant personally, it is difficult to imagine that he fills this important post with much zeal or ability. His predecessor, a more efficient German-trained officer, was dismissed for corruption. 10. In the afternoon the Commanding Officer, accompanied by Mr. B. W. Seager (British pro-Consul) called on Sheikh ’Ali Taha and Sheikh ’Ali A1 Amari, respectively the Acting and Assistant Governors of Jedda in the absence of Sheikh Abdul Aziz ibn Mu’Ammar, who was engaged at Mecca in a matri monial venture. ’Ali Taha is a Hedjazi who has spent 25 years in Civil Service, firstly under the Turks, then under the Hashimite dynasty, and! finally under the present Wahabbi regime. His colleague is a Nedji. The call of Colonel Hamdi Bey was then returned at the ^-Turkish barracks at the outskirts of the town. The building appeared to be scarcely occupied , 2 armoured cars were observed in the central courtyard, but were evidently m a state of complete neglect. 11. The two Governors returned the Commanding Officer’s call on Monday, 20th November, and were accorded a salute of 13 guns on their departure. Accompanied by the Maypr of Jedda (Sheikh Ali Salami) and Mr. Seager they lunched with the Commanding Officer on 22nd November. 12. Mr. K. S. Twitchell, the American Mining engineer, was. m Jedda, having recently returned from El Hasa, where he had been assisting e Standard Oil Company of California in their prospecting operations whicli terminated in the grant of an oil concession by the Sau dian. ■ Mr. Twitched made the journey across Arabia by car and lorry m ^jen da. s, and since Mr. Philby has now embraced Islam, it is probable that he is the only living Christian who has performed this feat. 13. As recently foreshadowed elsewhere, the affairs of Mr H ^ b.y'X and his Sharqieh Company are by no means flourishing, and it seem, tat ^ terms of his concession for the importation of Ford cais ai tourney to m-oving financially unsound.

With Saudi finances till further depleted by the war-preparations, the scale of which is easily the greatest yet made, the prospects of Ibn Sand being able to afford the heavy and continuous expense of employing competent pilots and ground staff, and of his embarking upon the essential refitting of his present machines nnd the ground organisation necessary for any extensive flying are receding further and further into the future. The prospects of his buying new machines seem even more remote, however, tempting the opportunity thus to steal a march on the Imam, unless the realisation of a State bank project shonld bring with it a substantial loan or credit arrangements. The advent of a financier will, in any event, be awaited with no little interest in this country. 6.

Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 19th January 1934. Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 332, dated the 5th December 1933. Talaat Pasha Harb, wdiose anticipated visit to this country by air^ was reported in my despatch No. 338, Confidential, of the 22nd November [Serial No. (4)], duly arrived in Jedda on the 3rd December, accompanied by three others associated with him in this mission. He w r as met on the landing-grouna close to the town, which for the previous two days had been the scene of con siderable activity, by the Amir of Jedda, a posse of local notables and a large concourse of the inhabitants. He had left Egypt on the 2nd December and hah spent the night at Tor, where he had taken the opportunity of inspecting the quarantine station. He had resumed his journey on the 3rd, had descended at Wejh, where a stay of some little time was made, and at Yanbu, where a short stay was necessarv for the purpose of refuelling. His pilot was Mr. Gr. J Mahony, of Misr-Airwork, S. A. E. 2. It is still early to learn more than I wms able to report in my despatch under reference as to the objects of his visit and the measure of success he i likelv to achieve. I understand from my Egyptian colleague that Talaat Pas a is pleased wfith his reception by the Saudi authorities. Sheikh Abdulla Suleiman, the Minister of Finance, has been in Jedda during the past two days, and I learn that conversations have been proceeding at the Ivandara PMace, where the members of the mission are being entertained as the guests of t Saudi Government. 3. Talaat Pasha, whom I met for a short time to-day, informed ra? that he proposed to leave for Mecca by car to-morrow and expected to return m twothree days’ time.

It is pleasant to observe this pious practice, oue of the five obligations of the true Moslem, going so happily hand in hand with, and sanctifying, a more material commercial purpose. I hope to he in a position to report further on this matter m due course. ! ; f 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 17th January 1934. Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 351, dated the 5th December, 1933. In my telegram No. 197 of the 15th November, I had the honour to indicate certain aspects of the local financial situation which might have a bearing on the Saudi attitude towards repayment of their debts. I submit herewith a somewhat fuller review of the situation. 2. All indications are that the Saudi Government are making the most determined efforts to reduce expenditure to a minimum and to lose no chance of augmenting their income, in order to leave themselves the widest possible margin for the heavy expenditure entailed by the military preparations^ now being undertaking. The latter are, of course, on a scale unparalleled . in tne history of this country, for tribal contingents from every quarter of Arabia have now been sent south, together with all available munitions, including even such items as a battery of field-guns from Medina brought in by the Turks before the Great War. The tribesmen receive little or no actual pay, hut need equip ment, food and transnort ; a recent Mecca estimate nut the present expenditure under this head at £5,000 a day. The figure is doubtless exaggerated and will he reduced in any case once the army has been transported to the required area, hut even a tenth of this figure would be a sufficient drain on the baud 1 ! income. To minimise it, the Government have recently taken to thorns on os rmpor mg such necessaries as paraffin, rice and sugar through certain olo. om rus e oca firms such as Haji Zeinal Ali Ridha, with whom tb« M-msrtr of Finance has been in relations since his Bombay days. This practice has hi - 0t hard. ! 3. The revenue has diminished almost to vanishin* aware, the bulk of it is derived from two sources,_m V 1 , nij on 0 f the The mkwimage of 1933, 20,000, was the worst since did tw fit-tie if anv. Saudi regime, and the nrospeets for pilgrim ships have arrived improvement can be looked tor.. Ab P resent l ; J A • 1o , ri - TT1 a aT1( q hookings from the Straits and Java, hearing exiguous _ nf 1T ;ioHms is moreover are reported poor. The decline in the average Vc . tendency noticeable. Better-class and rich pilgrims are hecora ^ peasants, who seems to he more and more for the pilgrimage _ pilgrimage in the cheapest bring with them the minimum sum necessary to do the pilgrimage m Lc49FDmjgmpaaEH—wnw , „ mi • -^-ces the total of their purchasing power and with it that of “pke^rs ^olher classes of Hejazi who live by them. d The decline in customs receipts cannot be measured for no statistics are o^ilahle but must be considerable. The decreased number of pilgrims, the available bi numbers, the decline in the purchasing power of the S 'S^e^ive increase of customs dues last May (see Jedda despatch No 154) and the heavy stocks still held by local merchants as a legacy from the last eivliteen months, have all contributed to the reliction of imports. Figures 1 t^Wed nrivatelv bv the Director of Customs are remarkable ; during the u° n ntbt montbs of the .mrrent Arabic year (April to November 1933) the number’of packages imported through Jedda was 9,847, as compared with 48,735 during a similar period last year. 5 Customs receipts are in any case heavily mortgaged by the system of drafts Which the Saudi Government have adopted to an increasing extent m the last two years as a means of satisfying creditors without paying them. Fuad Dev Hamza told me on the Jst December that no such drafts had been issued since the beginning of the current Arabic year My information suggests that Gils statement is not entirely accurate, and that certain favoured creditors nota'blv the importing firm mentioned in paragraph 2, have, m effect, received such drafts ; and that, moreover, these new drafts are “ 100 per cent.” cues ' C allowing the importer to admit goods free of all duty until the amount of the draft is paid off, instead of the “ 25 per cent ” once formerly issued which merely entitle him to write-off one-quarter of the amount of duty ou each consignment while paying the remaining three-quarters m cash. In any case, the total of the drafts issued previous to this Arabic year and still unredeemed must be verv large. The Soviets are stated to hold such drafts in respect of their 1931, importation of kerosene and benzine, but to be holding them, until such lime as they can import with less certainty of loss. fi All Government revenue is collected—one might say snatched—at the earliest moment and remitted to Riyadh. Forced loans on merchants, which were such a feature of the autumn of 1931, have not been m evidence, principally because of the lack of merchants rich enough to afford them, though this method was recently resorted to to pay Mr. Philby for a consignment of tyres^A tendency to impose new taxes, for example, on motor launches and on water- carts, is, however, noticeable. 7. Meantime other Government expenditure is cut down to the barest minimum. Official salaries are even more in arrear than usual ; for many montns emplovees were being paid on the principle “ one-third cash, one-bird kmd, one-third carried forward,” but even this now been modified to « 11 ca ™; Bribing is consequently even easier, cheaper and more prevalent than betore. Money is refused for all kinds of necessary and even profitable expenditure M condenser engineer laments the lack of essential spares, and the piping necessar to supply Jedda with good water is not forthcoming. Even confin enc allowances for Government offices have of late been held up. Redemption debt, in such an atmosphere, seems the height of improbability. 8. The currency position reflects the general situation : the Saudi rial, which a year ago stood at 18J to the £ gold and two years ago at 1 (b is fluctuating round 26. The value of its silver content is understood to b 30 and, while at the moment it is showing a slight tendency to nse ’ as , \ each year before the -pilgrimage on account of the demand for it createa arrival of pilgrims, the general opinion is that, after the pilgrimage, u depreciate to nearly 30. 9. Despite the catalogue of depression in the preceding paragraphs, is some reason to believe that the regime is in reality far from bauhrup _ _ that its protestations of poverty are the result of Semitic cumrhty ami ^ of disbursement, far more than of actual lack of money. The Mm ^ Finance has been noticed to be far less worried than he might be exp e( v and the Koval Family still seem able to afford luxury cars. The money, ^ it is agreed, is not, in the Hejaz, but where it has been remitted so stea y so long by the faithful Minister of Finance—Riyadh. 10.

With reference to my despatch No. 285 of the 9th September regarding* the Jedda water supply, I have the honour to report that the day of cheap and plenti ful water for Jedda now seems as far off as ever. 2. Sheikh Muhammad Dehlavi and the Waziria Committee are still at work at Waziria extending the old Turkish conduit farther back into the foothills in order to increase the head of water, which seeps into it from the subsoil, and a satisfactory flow of water into the town continues. They have, however, done nothing towards the renewal of the conduit near the town ; and it has now been established that the pipes in this portion, besides being rotten, are so full of the accumulated tilth of ages that the water, which is reasonably pure at source, on arrival in the town contains almost every imaginable type of germ. Europeans here consequently^ eschew it, and even the native population, which is usually influenced by considerations of price a great deal more than by those of hygiene, fights shy. J 3. It is estimated that an expenditure of £5,000 would suffice to repair the whole conduit, renewing the piping wdiere necessarv, and thus relieve ^ Jedda of any future ^anxiety as regards water. The water runs from these wells to the town by giavityq^and no pumping apparatus, not even the now* derelict windniill pump intioducea by Mr. Twitchell, is needed. An enterprising municipalitywould whole-heartedly support the scheme. But the Waziria Committee is lethargic. The all-powerful Minister of Finance is believed to be hostile to the scheme because its fruition would necessitate the closing down of the condensers which at present supply the town and would thus deprive him of one small but certain source of revenue. The local merchants on the committee are far too much m awe of him to act effectively. Whilst, therefore, the yield of certain municipal taxes has been voted for furthering the scheme and there is some talk of a future levy on pilgrims, no efforts are being made to raise on adequate sum for the pui pose, and the labours of the well-meaning Dehlavi seem doomed to be stifled through lack of funds. 4. 1 am sending a copy of this despatch to the Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Department of Overseas Trade.

With reference to my despatch No. 332 of the 5th instant [Serial No. (5)], relative to the visit of an Egyptian commercial and financial mission, under the leadership of Talaat Pasha Narb, to this country, I have the honour to report that the members of the mission left by air for Yenbu on the morning of the 10th December, intending to journey by car thence to Medina and, returning the second day, to resume their flight to Egypt. 2. The programme followed whilst they were in this country conformed closely to that reported in my despatch under reference. Talaat Pasha Narb left Jedda bv car on the 6th December for Mecca, where he was entertained by Amir Feisal,' Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman and Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Muhammad-el- Fadhl, and returned on the 8th, when he dined with Mr. and Mrs. Philby. 3. The results of the visit, in so far as they are known, or partially known, may be stated under the following heads :— {a) Banque Misr. —I am informed by the manager of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited), that his firm have been given, for the time being, the agency of the Banque Misr as regards its purelv banking business. Mr. Warner expressed the opinion, how ever, that it would not be long before the Banque Misr established a branch of their own in this country. (b) Local Representation for Pilgrim It is understood that this has been given to the local firm of Messrs. Hap Abdullah Ah Ridha. It was stated on the 8th December that, although no written agree ment had at the time been signed, yet Talaat Pasha harb had definitely promised the representation of this shipping interest to the local firm. Mr. Warner, in this connexion, stated that his n m had been given the handling of the money of Egyptian pilgrims, probably qua agents of the Banque Misr.

With reference to my despatch No. 325 of the 31st October and to my teleeram No 210 of the 10th December, relative to the visit of M Roger Maigret, French Charge d’Affaires, to Ibn Sand at Riyadh, I have the honour to report that, as foreshadowed in my telegram under reference, my French colleagiie, who arrived back from leave on the 3rd December left for Riyadh yesterday m a car provided by the Government in company with Haji Hamdi, the 1 rench-Algenan Vice-Consul and Fuad Bey Hamza. In my interview with the atter on the 10th December, he admitted that M. Maigret’s visit would not be of a purely personal and private nature as I was informed on the 2(th October by Sheikh Abdullah Suleyman. Conversations would take place_ on matters of no great importance except to the countries concerned, vis., S^ria and Saudi Aiabia, and would relate to trade and commercial questions affecting the two countries. Fuad Bey remarked that he expected to be absent in Nejd for about two weeks, but that on his return he hoped to be in a position to give Sir Andrew Ryan more information in regard to the objects of this visit. He also observed that M. Maigret w T as “ opening the door ” of Nejd to other visitors. 2. 1 understand that M. Maigret’s projected visit was known in Syria at the latest early in November, as the Indian vice-consul of this Legation, passing through Damascus about that time on his return from leave in Istanbul, found rumour very busy with the news. It was stated in some quarters, that France was ready to lend countenance to Ibn Sand in his present political difficulties, and the wildest conjectures were current according to wdiich Italy and France were the “ backers ” of the Imam and Ibn Saud respectively in the present dispute, Great Britain, for once, being omitted from the picture. 3. It wmdd be of great interest to learn in due course from His Majesty’s consular officers at Beirut and Damascus, to whom I am sending a copy of this despatch, whether any light, independent of the perhaps somewhat refracted information promised by Fuad Bey Hamza, can be thrown from Syria upon the imvard reasons for this visit. Can there be among these matters of mutual commercial interest to the two countries the rather batfling problem of the market for thrones in Svria ?

In the evening a reception was given at the Sa ’udi Arabian Legation which was attended by the Diplomatic and Consular Corps, the leading Iraqi Ministers and officials and senior British officials and their wives. The Sa’udi Charge d’Affaires, Sheikh Ibrahim al Muammer, received his guests with kindly courtesy and was evidently gratified by the cordial congratulations which he received from all present. 3. The occasion w r as marked in the press by the publication of II. M. ’s photograph and of laudatory leading articles praising his achievements^. The Nationalist newspapers, such as “ Al Istiqlal ” and “ Al Uqab ’’, rejoiced in him as the ruler of the one Arab country free from foreign domination, and heralded him as the keystone of the arch of theTonged-for Arab liberation and unity. The Government organ, “ Al Tariq ”, struck a soberer and less tendeneious note and was satisfied merely to indulge in neighbourly rejoicings with the people of Sa’udi Arabia on this happy occasion and to exhort the Governments of both countries to do their utmost to develop the common in terests of the two kindred nations. 4. Making due allowance for the irresponsibility of journalists, I think it may still safely be said that Ibn Sa’ud is a popular figure in this country and that the people have never shared or taken any live interest m the Hasimi e feud with the House of Sa’ud. Most Iraqis respect Ibn Sa’ud for his personal achievements and for the honour which he has brought to the Arab race. 1 le12 shortcoming’s of his administration of the Hejaz are however, fully appreciated by educated classes and they have no desire that he should extend his rule to this country. 5.

Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter No. E.-717|717|25, dated 6th February 1934. Lette from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 6 (98|23|3), dated the 12th January 1934. With reference to previous correspondence ending with my despatch No. 172 (1611|134|20) of the 5th June last, relative to the constitutional evolution of this country, 1 have the honour to state that the Umm-al-Qura of January 5th con tained a short article on the subject of reports in the Egyptian press, of which I have no other knowledge, to the effect that Ibn Sa’ud proposed to separate certain part of his dominions, like the Hejaz and to place them “ under the supervision of one of the neutral Sherifs ”, the first of whom would be one of those living at Beirut. The Umm-al-Qura states that, as a result of inquiries in high official circles, it is authorized to deny this report categorically. The officials consulted pointed out the impossibility of any suggestion that the King' would do anything to destroy the unity, which he has striven for thirty years to create. 2. I have thought it worth while to draw your attention to this curious report and the emphatic contradiction with which it has been met. You will remember that^early in 1926, Sherif Ali Hayder, the head of the principal branch of the Dhawi Zeyd, sought the assistance of His Majesty’s Government in securing the position of Begent or Governor of the Hejaz under Ibn Sa’ud and that at a rather earlier stage in the Sa’udi conquest of the Hejaz, it was suggest ed that Sherif Sharaf Adnan Pasha might be set up by the Ibn Sa ’ud as ruler of the Hejaz. Little has since been heard of the ambitions of Sherif Ali Haydar and his sons Sharaf Adnan, who entered the employment of Ibn Sa’ud, has sunk into obscurity in Mecca. WTiatever his relations with these people, it is to my mind almost inconceivable that he should willingly place any of the Sherifian family in any position of ^si-independent authority. 3. 1 had already drafted the first two paragraphs of this despatch, when I received a copy, kindly sent to me by Sir H. Satow of his despatch to the Foreign Office No. 119 of December 16th, regarding the Sherif Ali Haydar and bis son Abdul Majid. It looks as though that family were letting off a little flight of ballons d’essai. The ambitions of the son, who is or was married to a daughter of his namesake the last Turkish Caliph, are no new thing. He used io ventilate them freely at the Embassy in Constantinople during the period following the Armistice with Turkey. I was on terms of friendship with both fathei and son at that time, but have had no recent communication with thenu except that Sherif Abdul Majid sent me U Christmas card soon after my arrival hcie. I acknowledged as briefly as politeness would permit. 4.

However, the Hejaz Government had made a proposal by which a part or total payment of the £30,000 would be made pro vided the Polish group in question would supply the Hejaz Government with further arms and ammunition, smaller in quantity than the previous order. 2. Monsieur Benis enquired whether we would have any objection to the conclusion of an agreement on the above lines. He was reminded that the Resi dency was not responsible for Hejaz affairs which were within your competence. He said that he understood that this was the case, but that, as there was no Polish representative at Jedda and as he had to make some sort of report to his Government, he was anxious to ascertain, if possible, our views beforehand. The Oriental Secretary thanked 1dm for his courtesy and, while reaffirming that Hejaz matters 'were not within the competence of the Residency, expressed the private opinion that the proposed transaction was a business one on which we were not called to express an opinion. 3. To-day Monsieur Benis rang up the Oriental Secretary and informed that Monsieur Wilniewczyc had just arrived from Jedda and was verv pessimist ic at the possibility of getting anything at all out of the Hejaz Government. Pie was, however, submitting to his principals the proposals made by the Hejaz Government on the lines indicated in paragraph 1 above. Pie seemed to think, hcwever, that there was not much chance of the deal being concluded. (19) {Received on 3rd March 1934, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 7, dated 15th February 1934.)

Your telegram No. 15 [Serial No. (19)]. This reached me this morning. Last evening Minister of Finance called personally and showed me telegram from Corporation confirming what Saudi Government had been told by Shadid and Saudi Minister in London. Telegram stated definitely that Corporation had been registered and was prepared to send delegates in February to discuss bank affair and concessions for public works, etc., if Saudi Government were agree- able. I understood from Minister of Finance that Minister in London had merely interviewed certain interested parties. Shadid had apparently conveyed to Minister of Finance impression that persons named in second sentence of my telegram No. 13 [Serial No. (15)], were actually participating in Corpora tion.

He has had several bouts of illness during the spring, and this has been the immediate cause of his leaving for good. It must be attributed in part, however to the hopelessness of his position in the Administration here. I do not think that he has at any time been allowed «o do more than write academic reports and it has been increasingly evident of late that he could play no effective role’in a department dominated by the personality and methods of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman. 4. Things were not improved by M. van Leeuwen’s condemnation of the National Bank scheme (F. 85-N.|33) projected by the ex-Khedive and his asso ciates. By the time this was launched he had lost patience to such an extent that he abandoned his previous attitude of discretion and expressed his adverse opinion to outsiders like myself. Saudi circles were very ready to think that his hostility to the scheme was due to apprehension lest it should damage the posi tion of the Netherlands Trading Society, which is, as you know, the only orga nised bank here and in which he was formerly employed. The suspicion may have been increased by the fact that, for reasons of health, he had gone to stay indefinitely with the Netherlands Charge d’Affaires. 5. It was to be foreseen that no adviser could reorganise the finances of this country in a year, least of all in a year so inauspicious as one beginning in April 1932, when they were already in a desperate condition and the whole world as well was in a mess. It is, however, lamentable that M. van Leeuwen, of whose capacity I cannot judge, but who was an honest and industrious man, should not have had a chance of doing anything at all. He had no axe to grind, and I do not think that the Netherlands authorities made any attempt to use him l or their own purposes. The Dutch Charge d’Affaires has assured me that since he presented M. van Leeuwen to the King he has scrupulously refrained from meddling in his affairs, and has not seen his reports. I believe this to be true, and I shall be all the sorrier for M. Adriaanse if, as is possible^ he has to concern himself with the final settlement of account between the Saudi Lovernment and their late adviser.

I have the honour to refer to your despatch No. 212, of the 26th of October 1932, regarding the stipend issuable to His Highness {Sultan ’Omar bin ’Awadh and, in reply, to inform yon that I have caused your proposal to pay this Chief the arrears of stipend which have accrued since the 1st April 1927, to be referred to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury for consideration. Their Lord ships have now replied that they do not feel able to authorise the issue of six years arrears of stipend in this case and have expressed the view that payment of arrears for a period of three years would be a reasonable limit of concession. I agree with this view although I recognise that some difficulty might be ex perienced in resisting payment of the whole of the arrears which have accrued, in the event of the Sultan invoking his Treaty obligations. I accordingly how convey to you my formal sanction to payment to the Sultan of arrears of stipend for a period of three years from the 1st of April 1930, to the 31st of March^ 1933 inclusive, and, provided you see no objection, payment should, if possible, be made before the 31st of March 1933, in order to permit of the charge falling against the provision for stipends for the current financial year, which, it is anticipated will be sufficient to meet this small unforeseen liability. The esti mate for stipends for 1933134 will accordingly be reduced by the figure of S324 understood to be included therein in respect of the six years arrears which you recommended should be paid in this case. 2. As regards paragraph 5 of your despatch, I have to inform you that I agree that the practice of allowing stipends to accumulate foi a long period should be discouraged and I accordingly approve your proposal that, in future, a limit of one year should be imposed as the maximum time for whicn arrears may be claimed. _ Enclosure 1 to Serial No. (35). -lETTER FROM THE RESIDENT, AdEN, TO THE COLONIAL OFFICE, No, 150, DATED THE 28th June 1933.

I had discussions at first with General Scott and General Steward that it is below my position to receive sixty dollars monthly as a stipend amount, and according to my request to increase the same at least up to rupees one thousand monthly I was assured that they wall try their best to increase the amount. The matter was referred to His Majesty’s Government and I w T as keenly waiting for the favourable decision of the same and hence I did not claim the arrears of stipend of the usual amount of all these years. Then finally I had discussions with Colonel Lake for the arrears. Under the above circumstances I request your honour to refer the above matter again to His Majesty’s Government that the amount of the stipend should be increased to Rupees one! thousand monthlv, and if the above request is not granted my stipend arrears from October 1918 up to October 1933, should be granted because I did not claim the arrears only thinking that the matter was under discussion and so my claim for the amount of the arrears of all these years should not be debarred at all. I herewith return the draft No. 71 [104, dated 25th March 1933, for fhe amount of Rs. 2,100 with a request to send me the draft of the full amount of nil these years as mentioned above.

Many thanks for your Secret letter (243|4|33) of June 19th [Enclosure to Serial No. (33)]. I cannot connect your information’s story about the German Minister in Baghdad with anything of which I have knowledge here. You will have seen from my monthly reports that there has been much hatching of financial and economic schemes but this is a new one on me. I do not quite know what the security of the Port of Jedda means. One of the few good assignable securities here would be the heavy quarantine dues collected from all pilgrims and other travellers by sea. It is easy money for the Government as the shipping companies include the dues in the cost of the tickets, but the Government have shown no readiness to assign any revenue, whether customs or quarantine dues or other to the service of a loan. As for an unsecured loan, there are philanthropists like the err-Khedive of Egypt, etc., who seem ready to produce or promise money without obvious inducement ; but I doubt whether they include Germans. The German trading Consul here told me last year that, when the Sa’udi mission tried to get money in various capitals, Berlin was one ; and he laughed. He is now away for an indefinite period. All the same, if you hear anything more on the subject it would interest me to have it. I am sending a copy of this to Rendel.

Enclosure in Colonial Office covering letter, No. 18113133, dated 20th September 1933. Note by Capt. J. B. Glubb on a conversation in which he took part on leaving Amman ; the note is self-explanatory. Note by Captain Glubb on a conversation with the Amir Shalcir. On 24th August, just as I was about to start for England on leave, I received a message from the Amir Shakir, stating that ho wished to visit me to say good bye. He arrived a few minutes later. He began at once by saving tlyt he was personally in little anxiety at the presence of Ibn Sand in the Hejaz. ibn Sand was a bedouin, ruling unstable bedouins, and he (Shakir) was really not greatly perturbed whether Ibn Sand remained ten years or tvmnty vears in the Hejaz, because he was perfectly certain that the Saudis could not rule the Hejaz per manently.^ Their fall was simply a matter of time, and then the Sherifs woul return. The Sherifs had very deep rooted loyalties and associations iapossible for Xbn Saud^em^raS^tooTerThrowthl fheiii?

The very name of Asir was now anathema m Nejd, and it would be difficult to raise any kind 7a force m hejd, if fresh hostilities were now to break out in that area. tt • H ‘ S H i^ n r, “X s ?y that the She rifs had great influence in the Hejaz, and that lie himself had recently received letters from the Southern Hejaz and Asir. He had letters from one whose name I think he said was Ibn Abda and trom the Zeramq and other tribesmen of the Red Sea littoral of Asir These people had remained neutral in the Idris v. Ibn Sand rebellion. Many of them wiote to him now to ask his advice. They said that they were not Greatly concerned whether Ibn Sand retained the rule of the country or not,' but the first thing which they wanted to know was whether there was any chance of a return of the Sherifs. If Shakir could promise tlrnm any support, such as that of the British, which gave any hopes of success, the)' would be ready to declare for the Sherifs. Failing this, they would he obliged to choose the next best from amongst the other competing rulers.^ The Amir mentioned the names of several tribes, but as I was not familiar with them, I cannot recollect them for certain, except the Beni Shahi’ and the Zeraniq. His Highness continued that he was unable, of course, to answer these letters or take any action in any matters of this nature, owing to the attitude of the British and their ever ready suspicions that he was intriguing against Ibn Sand. But at any rate, he pointed out, both Tbn Sand and the Sherifs were allies of the British, whereas the Imam Yahya most emphatically was not. The inter ference of the British had prevented the Sherifs replacing Ibn Sand in the Hejaz, with the result that Ibn Sand’s obvious weakness was now tempting the Imam Yahya to take the offensive. It really looked as if Ibn Sand would soon collapse. The British did not offer him active support, hut merely limited their help to preventing the Sherifs from over-throwing him. It seemed probable that the result would he that the Imam Yahya, over whom the British had no control would step in and take the Hejaz himself, to the exclusion of all Great Britain’s allies. If the Sherifs were to recover the Holy Cities, His Highness continued, they could easily come to an agreement with Ibn Sand, who would remain the ruler of Nejd. This was the natural arrangement, only upset by the insanity of King Husain. But suiy arrangement would he better than allowing the Imam Yahya to come in. His Highness then said that he had intended to speak to me on this subject for a considerable time, as also to Mr. Kirkhride, the acting British Resident, hut that he had hesitated and procrastinated until he heard that I was about to leave, when he made up his mind to speak immediately. He hoped that I would have an opportunity in London to make known what he had said, to His Majesty’s Government. He had intended also to tell Mr. Kirkbride. Should he do so, or would I be seeing Mr. Kirkbride f 1 replied that I had already said good bye to Mr. Kirkhride, and had not time to see him again, as my car was at the doer and I was catching Imperial Airways. I promised, however, to submit the gist of what he had said, to the Colonial Office in London. He then remarked “ It is obvious now, that Feisal is the only man in the Sherifian family who can do a job of work I enquired whether King Feisal’s views agreed with those which His Ligh ness had just expressed to me. He replied emphatically that their views wsre absolutely identical. I said that, in that case it seemed probable that King Feisal would already have explained them to His Majesty’s Governraen ^ as it had just returned from Europe. His Highness replied that he did not im() Vv if the King had done so or not, though he believed that His Majesty had no secre from hisi friends the English (!!!).l His Highness then took his leave, again assuring me of the vital importance) of keeping the Imam Yahya out of the Hejaz at all costs, adding that the Imam was now immensely powerful, that he had invited all the Yemen under his un disputed sway, and that, if he completed the conquest of Nejran, he would be within striking distance of Riyadh itself, in addition to being able to threaten the Hejaz through Asir. 1 hope that I will not be thought to have acted irregularly in submitting direct to the Colonial Office, a report on a conversation which occurred before I left Amman. As stated above, however, the Amir Shakir made these statements in a visit ostensibly made to say goodbye, when my car and luggage was at the door. I could not possibly have committed it to paper, without missing the Imperial Airways machine, on which my passage was already booked and paid for. I presume that copies of this note will be forwarded to Jerusalem and Amman, with this explanation as to the method of its submission.

Memorandum respecting Petroleum in Arabia (as revised by Petroleum DeparU ment .— (Received in Foreign Office, August 11 , 1933.) (A)— Petroleum Prospects of Arabia. (1) LITTORAL Region of the Hejaz. —Petroliferous deposits and seepage have long been known to exist in this area. Interest in it was stimulated by Mr. TwitchelPs survey in 1931 in the coastal region north of Jedda, hut this area seems to have dropped into the background of late. In a report furnished by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to the Petroleum Department in 1932, it was pointed out that the general structure of the Red Sea is known geologically as a “ Rift Valley, ’ ’ that is, a sunken valley bounded on either side by rift faults. The prospects of finding oil in commercial quantity are considered to be remote, though not entirely non-existent, and even after a complete survey, “ Rift Valley conditions are such that any test drilling would be very speculative. (2) Hasa and Koweit Neutral Zone. —It has been thought for many years that this region might produce oil. The idea that it may be underlain by rocks of the same geological age as those of the Iraq and Persian oil-fields, and that potential oil structures might exist extending from Koweit to Qatar inclusive, has been encouraged by the striking of oil in quantity in Bahrein in 1932. (3) 77?e Farson Islands and Asir. —Interest in these islands andior the mainland of Asir, from the point of view of petroleum potentialities, seems to date from before the Great War. Operations were actually started on one of the islands by the Red Sea Petroleum Company, a subsidiary of the Shell Group, in 1926 or early in 1927, but drilling operations were subsequently abandoned as unsuccessful. As to Asir, see (D) (2). (4) Mokalla. —In 1928-29 the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company (Shell Group) carried out investigations, and reached the conclusion that the petroleum prospects were quite unfavourable. (5) Muscat .-—The Anglo-Persian Oil Company abandoned this area as un favourable in 1925-26. (B)— Interested or Potentially Interested Companies. (1) The Iraq Petroleum Company. —The Turkish Petroleum Company (now the Iraq Petroleum Company) was formed in 1912, when the Deutsche Bank became associated with the National Bank of Turkey and the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company (Royal Dutch Shell Group), in order to press certain c l a ^ in 5 to oil rights in Baghdad and Mosul, including those attached to the Baghdad Railway Concession. The chief rival of the new company at that time was the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which had for some time been in negotiation with the Turkish Government. In 1914 an agreement was entered into providing for the reconstitution of the Turkish Petroleum Company, from which the National Bank of Turkey withdrew, the new participants being the Angm- Persian Oil Company, 50 per cent. ; the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company ancthe Deutsche Bank, 25 per cent each Tk;* i. t three groups should give undertakings not to b&lt;f interested 1 - pr , &lt; l vlded . 1,1 at t,ll! in the production of oil in the Ottoman Erani re n S dlr f indirectly Egypt, Koweit and the Transferred Territories os , ie /, ind (excluding Petroleum Company. This agreemtr w Ts Tned by the BridS ^ Urkish Governments, and by the groups concerned. As the Turkish PeSenm'r' 661 ™ 1111 was then predominantly British, this arrangement had the effect of souring The whole of this area to interests which were predominantly British After the war American and French interests were admitted into the Iraq Petroled Company and the arrangement as regards non-competition between the cto,Z WaS COnfi ™ ed “ an agreement^etween vrouTs w P ith w-hich the BHt?T)f 8 p T Wa f a priVate a S reem ent between the groups witp AUucn tlie Bntish Government was not associated. Under this agreement a line was drawn round Arabia, Palestine and Asia Minor which excluded the feultanate of Koweit and the Farsan Islands, hut included Bahrein and an area was thus defined within which the various groups constituting the Iraq Petroleum Company agreed that they would not seek for or obtain oil concessions otherwise than through the Iraq Petroleum Company or its nominee! r adndaslon of French and American interests the share capital of the Iraq Petroleum Company was distributed as follows Anglo-Persian Oil Company Royal Dutch Shell .. French Group American Group C 1 ) .. C. S. Gulbenkian Percentage. . 23.75 23,75 . 23.75 . 23.75 . 5.00 100.00 As the Royal Dutch Shell is 60 per cent. Dutch and 40 per cent. British, the British shareholding in the company now only represents about 33f per cent. The Iraq Petroleum Company is still technically a British company, as in article 32 of its convention with the Government of Iraq the company must be and remain a British company, registered in Great Britain, and the chairman must at all times be a British subject. But the position is different from a British point of view, from that which formerly obtained when the company was British in fact as 'well as in name. Apart from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Burmah Oil Company, there are no really large oil companies which are entirely British, and which could compete with the big groups represented on the Iraq Petroleum Company. The Burmah Oil Company has never been inclined to undertake exploration work outside India. There may, however, be some instances where the Iraq Petroleum Company is not prepared to seek concessions in the reserved area, and where the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, either by itself or in association with one or more of the other groups, may be allowed to acquire concessions. (2) British Oil Development Company and Mosul Oil-fields (Limited ).—On the 20th April 1932, the Iraq Government granted an oil concession to the British Oil Development Company (Limited) over the western portion of Iraq. The concession is for a period of seventy-five years and covers an area of about 40,000 square miles, comprising all Iraq lands situated west of the River Tigris and north of the thirty-third parallel of latitude. A special law confirming the British Oil Development Concession was passed and published in the Official Gazette on the 29th May 1932. This is reckoned as the date of . the commencement of the concession. The company must be and remain a Bntish company registered in Great Britain, and the chairman must be a British subject. There is, however, a large foreign interest in the company. The Bntisli Oil O) In 1932 the American shareholding in the American group (Near East Development Cor poration) was held in the following proportions :— Lc571FD Standard Oil Company of New Jersey .. Standard Oil Company of New York (now the Socony- Vacuum Company) Gulf Oil Corporation of Pennsylvania .. Percentage. ,. 41 § . 411 ,. 161i, T I ' 1 11 t Development Company, was first registered in 1928 with a nominal capital of £82,500, the original directors being Sir Jiidward Manville (chairman) Sir Edward Mountain (chairman of the Eagle Star and British Dominions Insurance Company) (Sir E. Mountain subsequently became chairman of the British Oil Development Company), the late Admiral Lord Wester Wemyss W. R. Brown (representing Lord luverforth), General Sir A. Mola (Italy), three representatives of the Italian Azienda Generale Italiana Petroli, and E. C. Simmons (solicitor). At some stage, but when it actually occurred is not clear from the information available, German and Franco-Swiss interests were also included. The capital in 1931 was stated to be held in the following proportions British Italian German Franco-Swiss Percentage. 52 24 12 12 100 In December 1932 a new company was formed, known as “ Mosul Oil-fields (Limited), ” to acquire the shares in the British Oil Development Company and to carry on its operations. The company had a nominal capital of £1 millon in £1 shares. In March 1933 the board of this company was re constructed, and the Foreign Office informed by the company that the directorate was as follows :— Viscount Goschen (chairman). Other British directors (5) : Sir Edward Mountain (deputy chairman), the late Admiral Lord Wester Wemyss, Lord Glenconner (director of Hambro’s Bank), W. R. Brown (director of British Union Oil Company), and Sir Alwnn Dickinson (formerly the represen tative of the British Government on the British Phosphate Com mission) as managing director. Italian directors (3) : Professor. Alessandro Martelli, Gr. Uff. Amaldo Petretti, and Gr. Uff. Vittorio Amoretti (Azienda Generale Italiana Petroli). German directors (2) : Herr Thomas Brown and Herr M. Hirschfeld. French director (1) : M. Paul Girod. •*: fraq Government director (1) : Jafar Pasha-el-Askeri, a total of thirteen. The company is not known to be at present interested in Saudi Arabia. (3) The Anglo-Persian Oil Company (A.P.O.C .).—See at (1) above as to A.P.O.C.’s participation in the I.P.C. and the restrictions imposed thereby. The A.P.O.C. has, however, in addition to its main concession in Persia, which has been confirmed by a revised agreement with the Persian Government, dated the. 29th April, 1933, a separate interest also in Iraq, where, through its sub sidiary, the Khaniqin Oil Company, it has a concession in the “ Transferred Territories ” under agreements with the Iraq Government on the 30th August, 1925, and the 24th May, 1926. It also has freedom of action in Koweit, where it is competing fbr a concession with the Eastern and General Syndicate, representing the Gulf Oil Corporation. , (4) The Eastern and General Syndicate.—This is a BritisK company registered in August 1920 with a nominal capital of £125,300. The chairman and managing director is E. W. Janson, and the other directors are F. W. Gamble, H. .T. Adams and P. C. Tarbutt. It has, at various times, acquired concessions.in Bahrein and Arabia, but has never carried out any really effec tive work, its sole, object being apparently to obtain concessions and traffic, in them to other parties. The company at one time apnroached the Anglo-Persian without success, and in 1927 and 1929 transferred its interests to the Eastern Gulf Oil Corporation of H. S. A. [see under (5 below)].

Eventually how ever this concession was taken over by the Standard Oil of California, presuml ably because the Gulf as a member of the I. P. C„ could not hold it.

P. C. cu ^ Standuird Oil Company of California—Mtev the break-up of the ptandard Oil Group m 1912, many members of the group became independent including the above company. This company is one of the largest oil companies in me United states, and is a complete unit, being engaged in producing re fining, transporting and marketing crude oil and refined products. ’The company is engaged in production in eight States in the United States, and has oil properties in Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela. The Standard Oil Company of California and the Gulf are independent of each other, although there is a general impression that the various Standard Oil Companies still have some community of interest and are prepared to co-operate in matters of general policy. At times, however, there has been keen competition between them. As pointed out above, the Standard Oil Company of California holds the Bahrein Concession, which it operates through the Bahrein Petro leum Company, a Canadian Corporation. It has also just secured from Ibn Sand an oil concession in Hasa, full particulars of which are not yet available. (C )—Past Concessions affecting Saudi Arabia. (1) Northern Hejaz .—It is possible that certain concessionary rights were granted in Turkish times, but this subject has not been explored in the Lega tion. There was talk of a concession under the Hashimite regime and Mr. Philby was one of those interested, hut there is no evidence of a Hashimite concession having been granted. Any interest of Mr. Philby’s is presumably identical with that of Midian (Limited), an inactive but still going concern, closely allied with Sharquieh (Limited). (2) Jedda (Hejaz, West Coast of Arabia).—Two American engineers (Twitchell and Crane) carried out investigations for oil in 1931. The Petro leum Department brought the matter to the notice of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who replied that the geological prospects in this area were not regarded as favourable [see under paragraph (A) (1)]. (3) Muscat .—The Anglo-Persian Oil Company obtained a concession in 1925 to prospect for oil for a period of two years with the right to a mining lease, but this concession has now lapsed. (4) Mokalla.—ThQ Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company started negotiations for a concession in 1928-29, but the matter was not proceeded with as they reached the conclusion that the prospects of discovering petroleum were quite favourable. (5) Horn—The Anglo-Persian Oil Company applied, probably for ospecting rights only, to Ibn Sand in 1921. The E.G.S came into the field ;er P At fte beginning of 1923 Major Holmes submitted a draft c o noe ^ion Sir P Cox. In March 1923, the latter, acting under instructions from home ggested to Ibn Sand that he should decide nothmg mitiPlie had tad an portunity of considering an offer by A y°y'l, who “ H ‘ s „S“l 7 ^ r fer the mt considered to have a prior claim.

Be that as it may, E.G.S. It the emission, and on the 6th May 1923 IbnSaud granted an oil «,nce S si&lt;m fine uding the Qatit and Jubail areas) to the Eastern and General Syndicate. Maior Holmes gave an undertaking not o sell part ol the concession to the a POP and ffis Maiestv’s Government thought ot trying to induce Ibn Sand to cancel this restriS.but the proposal was abandoned in May 1924. Thus the A.P.O.C. were left out in the cold. tup final terms of the concession to E.G.S. are not known, but there are indiluons It i“ ollowed the draft which had been submitted to Sir P. Cox.. That draft, and probably the actual concession, included mter aha, provision for the following (a) Lapse of the concession if E.G.S. should fail to start operations in a specified manner within nine months. (h) Government right to cancel the concession after any continuous V cessation of operations for more than twenty months. (c) Payment of £3,000 a year for “special protection ” in half-yearly payments to begin sixty days after date. {d) Payment of £6,000 under pain of nullity of the concession, sixty days after date. (e) Arbitration in the event of any dispute. It is not clear what, if anything, E.G.S. did to implement the undertaking do start operations. It is known that on the 26th April, two geologists of theirs left Koweit to make a preliminary survey in “ Ne^d, Koweit heutral Zone and Hasa,” but it is not known to what this led. Anyhow, Major Holmes was in difficulties with Ibn Sand in October 1925, because, according to Bushire telegram to the Colonial Office of the 31st October, (a) Ibn Sand had refused to alter a clerical error of date, and (b) E.G.S. would advance no more money. There was also apparently difficulty in obtaining financial support m London owing to the non-existence of British diplomatic representation at Nejd. It was probably at this time or a little later that E.G.S ; and Major Holmes, estranged Ibn Sand by refusing a payment which he claimed. There is no evidence that Ihn Sand formally cancelled the concession at this juncture. When, however, E.G.S. entered into an agreement with the Gull Company on the 30th November, 1927, in regard to this, the Neutral Zone -Concession and the hoped-for concession in Koweit, they admitted that both the former were “ at least subject to forfeiture and cancellation, if not actually null and void.” The negotiations which led to the grant of a concession in Hasa to the Standard Oil of California are understood to have been conducted by tnai company directly, and not through the intervention of the E.G.S. (6) Koweit Neutral Zone.—On the 17th May, 1924, an oil concession is alleged to have been granted jointly by Ihn Sand and the Sheikh of Koweit o the E.G.S. The E.G.S., by an agreement of the 30th November, 19m, trans ferred any rights which it might possess or acquire or which could l:)e r ®‘ instated in Hasa or the Neutral Zone as well as in Koweit to the Eastern Gu Oil Company. The history of the concession is somewhat obscure. A recen Colonial Office memorandum concludes from a review of the known facts t e “ impression . . : that Iban Sand did actually grant the concession on his own without the consent of the Sheikh of Koweit.” As against tins, E.G.S. definitely claimed to have got the concession from both, and it seem hardly likely that they would have committed themselves to this statement i it were untrue, in their definite legal agreement with the Gulf Company ot tne 30th November, 1927, as they certainly did. In any r case, however, the g r . 0111 l 3 for considering this concession to have lapsed are even stronger than in t e case of the Hasa Concession. E.G.S. not only admitted in the agreement ^ Gulf that it was like the other “ at least subject to forefeiture,” ^ , bu -, stated in a letter to the Colonial Office of the 19th December, 1928 that it na “ never been made operative.” The Sheikh of Koweit’s account of this concession is given in a re J® n j despatch from the Political Agent dated the 6th Julv, 1933, which states t a the Political Resident had an interview with the Sheikh and discussed t^art op{ra(-;. i after aHm atymois, teetioii”a^ ilemeiit tkik jd, KoweitM row, Major Sik !, accorliglil: k Said tai iffe ranee no«' icial support ilk •esentationatSf j.S. andiirt' claimed, matter. The Sheikh s recolleetion was that Ibn Sand gave the Hasa Conces sion proper to Major Holmes in the spring of 1923, its chief clause being that unless Major Holmes started work within three years the concession would lapse. Ibn Sand wrote m the summer of 1923 and sent the Sheikh a draft joint concession m respect of the Kowiet Neutral Zone, which he wished to fr 6 m y ta ,' ,0 r ® olmes s company, the E.G.S., and asking the Sheikh to sign it. His Majesty's Government informed the Sheikh that he could sign the joint concession. The concession was actually signed in April 1924, and consisted of only four pages, and it was duly sent on to Ibn Sand. About a vear after wards Major Holmes had a disagreement with Ibn Saud, who' informed Major Holmes that the joint Neutral Zone Concession was there and then can celled. Ever since the Sheikh of Kowiet has assumed the joint concession to be a dead letter, that is to say, from about April 1925. The Sheikh of Koweit has been unable to ascertain whether Ibn Sand has included the Neutral Zone in the Hasa Concession recently granted to the Standard Oil Company of California. (7) ForTSdn Islands, now also a pant of Saudi Avabia. —E.Gl.S. would appear to have obtained some sort of a concession for the Farsans (and possibly the mainland of Asir) from Hasan-al-Idrisi in 1926. It is not clear what became of this concession, if the grant was complete, but it was superseded by a con cession for the Farsans given by the Idrisi on the 25th September, 1926, to a Mr. Cooper, who marketed it to the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company (Royal Dutch Shell Group). The latter formed the Red Sea Petroleum Company’to work it.. This company started operations of some importance at Zifaf Island. The Idrisi, acting, it was thought at the time, under Italian influence, hut more probably under that of Iban Saud, made difficulties in the summer of 1927. After abortive efforts by the company to overcome them, Ibn Sand came for ward ostensibly in the role of honest broker between the Idrisi, now his vassal and the company. A conference held at Wizan in December 1927 under his auspices between the representatives of the company and the Idrisi was again abortive. Ibn Saud eventually intimated “ a decision in the question of the dispute which we were asked to settle between the Red Sea Petroleum Company and the Idrisi Government ” to the effect that a new concession should be drawn up and that in the meantime it would he undesirable to accede to a request which the company had put forward for permission to transfer their operations from Zifaf to Great Farsan. He suggested that the company should send a representative to Jedda to negotiate the revised concession. On his persisting in this attitude the company decided to withdraw from the islands and in September 1928 they removed all material under the auspices of H.M.S. Dahlia. It must be assumed that this terminated any rights under the Cooper Concession. The Shell Company has recently stated that it is not interested to reopen operations in the Farsan Islands. (D )—Present Position. Whatever view might possibly be held as to the legal position in regard to past concessions, it is quite certain that Ibn Saud believes himself to be quit of all of them and he is' probably right. The position in regard to the various areas may be summed up as follows :— (1) Northern Heins.—Midian (Limited), closely associated with Sharqieh (Limited) or some other concern, may have had rights in this area, .but there is no reason to think that they survive. No one seems to be actively interested at present. (2) Asir .—Ibn Sand in June 1933 intimated that he would he prepared to consider offers for a concession from British companies. The matter was referred by the Petroleum Department to the I.P.C. within whose sphere of in fluence Asir fell and who were the only company with any British interests who were likely to be prepared to consider the .matter. The I.P.C. have intimated that they are prepared to send out geologists to make an examination it they can secure the necessary rights without payment during the explora ory pern (3) Hasm—After some competition between the Iraq Petroleum Companv (who sent a representative out to negotiate m 1933) and the Standard 0 Company of California, a concession was ultimately panted o e ^ • is understood from information obtained from the I.P.C. that the concess was siamed on the 29th May, 1933, the terms being an initial payment of £«&gt;0,UUJ (gold)' and a further deferred payment of £20,000 (gold) with a royalty at 5. per ton.46 (4) Qatar. —The A.P.O.C., acting on their own initiative hut with the object of transfer to the I.P.C. secured an exclusive option from the Sheikh to cariy out geological investigations for a period of two years with the right to apply for a concession vuthin that period. A draft concession approved by the I.P.C. has recently been submitted by the A.P.O.C. to the Sheikh. (5) Koweit Neutral The present position in regard to this area i 0 not clear. It may be true that Major Holmes’s primary object in coming to Jedda in April 1933 was to obtain Ibn Saud’s consent to a regrant, so far as the Saudi Government are concerned, of a concession for this area. But it may also be the case that so far as Ibn Sand is concerned, he has included the Neutral Zone with the Hasa Concession. This position is at present under consideration by His Majesty’s Government. (6) Farsan Islands. —There has been no. activity since 1928 and both the Shell and the Anglo-Persian have recently informed the Petroleum Depart ment that they are not interested any longer in obtaining a concession over these islands.

Twitchell in regard to the Jedda water supply, I have the honour to report that water has again been brought to Jedda from the wells at Waziriya, and the event was ceremonially inaugurated on the 26th August in the presence of the Minister of Finance, local notables, and a large gathering of townspeople. As the result of the discovery of a fresh spring, to the south-east of the wells themselves, w r ork has been in progress for some months past, under the direction of Sheikh Muhammad Dehlavi and experts of the Mecca water supply of Aiu iZubeyda. The water has been led through the old pipes, put down in Turkish times, and now falls into the Idarus reservoir, situated on the outskirts of one of the poorer quarters of the town. The present rate of flow, according to Mr. Twitchell, who still shows active interest in this undertaking, is 40 gallons per minute, and this, he says, it wull shortly be possible to increase to as much as three times that amount on the completion of work on a second conduit which runs alongside the first, but wdiich is not yet connected over its entire length. 2. Mr. Twitchell points out that here there is an ample and cheap water supply sufficient for the needs of the towm, wdiose present rate of consumption he places at 38 gallons per minute. Although other local experts would estimate the local rate of consumption at probably not- more than 24 gallons per minute, it may be conceded that the new 7 source of supply is more than sufficient, is cheap (for it costs nothing at the Idarus reservoir), and at present is reasonably safe at source. The Indian Medical Officer attached to this Legation recently conducted an analysis of the water, chemically and bacteriologically, and pronounced it to be fit for consumption. The total water consumption of Jedda, therefore, may be expected to increase, particularly as the poorer classes are able to draw as much as they require for the mere trouble of carrying it away. 3. From past.experience, however, considerable doubt is expressed as to the prospects of AA aziriya water becoming a permanent factor in the town’s water supply. The doubt is not diminished by reports that, although from Waziriva to Has Qaim (a .place 5 kilom. from Jedda) the conduit has been cemented and is at present fairly sound, over the remaining distance the nipes are old and rotten and require constant care to prevent leakage. Sheikh Muhammad Dehlavi has unsuccessfully approached the Jedda municipality in an endeavour to get the pipe-line thoroughly repaired, and has now placed the matter before Ibn Sand, stating his pieferonce for a cement conduit over iron piping’.4.

State Bank. Mr. Philby spoke of the breach between the e^r-Khedive and Shadid of whom he (Mr. Philby) now has a very poor opinion, though he was °'reatlv impressed by him in Jedda. He considered it clear that Shadid had misrepre sented to the Saudi Government in the spring his position vis-a-vis of the ex- Khedive, from whom he pretended to have received full powers to treat and conclude an agreement. After getting the contract, he had avoided meeting Abbas Hilmi. He had embarrassed the latter more particularly by getting the Saudi Government to make out drafts in his own (Shadid’s) favour to cover their share in certain expenses and by evading a request from the e^-Khedive to hand them over. The amount was not great but it was a dirty business, as Abbas Hilmi was morally responsible to the Saudi Government. According to Mr. Philby the ea;-Khedive, with whom and whose entourage he has been in touch, wants to behave honourably, but is not keen on the bank affair, which would only attract him, if he could get British financial backing. Everybody con cerned appears to consider that Shadid’s arrangement with the Saudi Govern ment was impossible. Mr. Philby has outlined in the Khedivial circle (apparently without any mandate from the Saudi Government) his ideas of a workable contract, providing for a much smaller capital and a loan of say, £stg.l00,000 instead of one of £gold 200,000. This record of a friendly conversation over the tea-table may not be exact in every particular, but it represents with sufficient accuracy the main lines of what Mr. Philby told me.

Mr. Philby expressed disappointment that, the Saudi Government alleging their preoccupation with the Yemeni danger 1 , seemed indis posed to use any part of the money received from Standard Oil of California to effect part payment of their debts, the outstanding balance of which he estimates at something like £150,000 gold, including the debts in which he is interested (Marconi, Standard Oil of New York, Sharqieh,48 T • •+ o-nrl T think Ford) which he now puts at ahont £50,000 gold. He said ft™ h had' Jot the interest on all these debts between £2,000 and *8,000-* statement 8 which does not quite agree with what he told me sometime ago in r a/m He had no idea what the Saudi Governmentiwould do when the present 1 Sorium expires in November next.

On the same day the Acting Commissioner called, on the Commanding Officer in connection with suspicions of being engaged in the. smuggling ol Opium which were entertained by the Police against the Official mterpre ei. The matter was fully investigated and the accusations proved do be based on a case of mistaken identity. The incident, however, served a useful purpose in impressing on the new Ship’s Company the gravity with which the Drug ira is regarded. 9. In this connection the campaigns of Russel Pasha in Egypt have now rendered the importation of drugs through the northern ports and on the no coast and across the western and eastern frontiers a far more risky undertaKi g than formerly, with the result that the Egyptian authorities have iiatura turned their eyes'towards the Sudanese frontier as being the obvious alterna for the development of new smuggling activities. This in turn has resiute an even closer surveillance in Port Sudan, but although it is understood tna evidence has been found of an extensive entrepot trade, the opium traffic tor o ^ consumption has been proved to be on a considerably larger scale than originally suspected. Practice Areas., 16. Port Sudan.—On account of reports from the British Legation at Jedda of increasing tension between Sandi-Arabia and the Yemen on the ’Asir frontier, it was decided to sail one day in advance of programme, in order to call at Kamaran for further intelligence. The ship sailed accordingly at 17-00 on 19th September, and arrived at Kamaran at 12-30 on 21st. 17. Kamaran. The Administrator, Captain Wickham at once came on board, but had no further news to communicate. He felt certain that had hostilities commenced in the coastal area they would have come quickly to his knowledge from refugees, who in the prevailing northerly wind would soon have arrived from the Jizan-Medi district. Proceeded for Perim at 17-00 on the same day. 18. Perim .—Arrived at Perim 09-30 on 22nd September, 22. On the morning of the 25th the Sheikh (or ’Aqil) of Bir Suqaiya (a coastal village 13 miles North-east of Perim) called on the Commanding Officer to present a petition to the Chief Commissioner, Aden, in connection with the recent disturbances in that area. These events, in brief, consisted of raids and demands for the payment of taxes by Imamic troops and tribes into villages in the south-west extremity of the Protectorate.

Weighed and proceeded at 06-00, and boarded two dhows—the first encountered during the period of the patrol—in the approaches to the entrance to Perim Small Strait. This scarcity of dhow traffic is attributable mainly to the tension existing between the Yemen and Saudi-Arabia, though trade in general is poor. 30. Passing through the Small Strait the ship anchored at 09-00 on 28th off Suqaiya 31. The Commanding Officer and Interpreter at once landed, and were received with great cordiality by the Sheikh, who had only just ariived back from Perim (paragraph 22), and villagers. No further developments had occurred in the district during his absence. A copy oi my further Report to the Chief Commissioner, Aden, is shown m Appendix II. ; * 34.

It appears that he came to Perim on Saturday last with the intention of seeking an interview with Mr. Sinclair, but was recommended instead to call on me. 2. I interrogated the ’Aqil with the object of elucidating his complaints, and gathered the following information :— (a) A small force of Yemeni troops at Sheik-Said forbid the passage of traffic from the Protectorate to Perim through that port. The ’Aqil had on this occasion made the entire journey by sea. (b) Since the visit of Lieutenant Hamilton to Suqaiya (about 14th instant) an armed Yemeni soldier appeared and demanded arrears of tax, in compliance with which 50 MT dollars were accordingly paid. (c) Five days ago, a further demand was made for camel and goat tax, but there being no money in the exchequer the envoy was told that payment must be deferred. 3. I could see nothing to be gained by visiting Suqaiya in the ship, and therefore told the ’Aqil that my programme would not permit of this deviation. If weather conditions permit, I propose to visit Suqaiya for a few hours on Thursday 28th September, while on passage to Aden. Enclosure 4 to Serial No. (49). APPENDIX NO. IT. Enclosure to II. M.

Telegram from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the London Foreign Office, No. 182, dated the 27th October 1933. Jedda despatch No. 394, September 20th, 1932. I saw Minister of Finance this afternoon at his request when he gave me a verbal message from Ibn Sand through Amir Feisal to the effect that Maigret who returns from leave to-morrow recently met Fuad in Syria and requested permission to pay a personal visit to Nejd upon his return to Jedda. Fuad has now secured Hm Sand’s consent and Maigret will proceed I understand imme diately thence here. Fuad will await him in Riyadh and will return with him to Hejaz. Minister of Finance emphasized that visit was purely private and would be short and gave as reason that Maigret merely wished to see the country. He would meet the King either in Riyadh or in the neighbourhood. Abdullah Sulaiman added that should anything pass during visit other than private nature Fuad would inform me of it at our next meeting. I am at a loss to understand true (grp- undec.) of this strange departure from what has always been assumed would be the King’s attitude towards foreign representatives who desired to visit Nejd. It is difficult to accept pro testations as to private nature of visit at their face value and it is more than likely that other interpretations will be placed on the visit when the news becomes public property.

In paragraph 32 of the Jedda Keport for March (File No. 81-N/33), enclosed in my despatch No. 102 of April 7,1 mentioned that Ibn Sa’ud had given a dinner to notable pilgrims on the evening of March 31. As you are aware, this is now a regular feature of each year’s pilgrimage season. On the present occasion, the King entertained some hundreds of guests of various nationalities, including several Indians. I understand from my Indian Vice-Consul that the attention shown both to Shia and to Indian pilgrims has been a feature of this year’s pilgrimage. In the case of the Indians the King and the Minister of Finance, who is largely responsible for dispensing such attention had the advantage of the presence of Jemal Pasha Ghazzi, who has been conducting since last year an intensive pro- pilgrimage campaign in India and was able to make play with the intimacy he had established there with various participents in this year’s Haj. 2. It is the King’s custom to speak at great length at these annual banquets. The published version of his address on the present occasion occupied a page and a half of the Umm-al-Qura of April 6. I enclose a short summary prepared in the Legition. 3. The King preached from his usual text, the need for unity in Islam but he seems to have restrained almost entirely the tendency which he has sometimes shown in the past to give offence by his utterances regarding people who do not share his views. I understand that the published version of his speech represents the original pretty accurately, although the actual language used in cer am pas sages may have been more emphatic. I have heard only one definite sugges ion }f any important omission. According to my Persian colleague t e £ ave 3ne of the reasons whv he could not aspire to the Caliphate the ac a so many Moslem countries are' under alien denomination He is said to have the number Egypt as being under the thumb of Great Bn am. ® r . ^.joiit this, it cannot have been pleasing to all his Egyptian earer , g &amp; gratify some of them. 4.

Summary of the Speech delivered hy His Majesty King c Abdul Aziz ibn Sa’ud at the banquet given on the 31st March 1033 at the Royal Palace at Mecca. As nublished in the Mecca Umm-al-Qura No. 434 of the 11th Dhu’l Hijja 1351 1 (April 6, 1933). The Arab people, His Majesty said, enjoy one great blessing from God in the teachings of the Prophet, which have descended on them like the fertilizing rain on the earth and have been the means by which they have spread their influence over vast territories. All Muslims were indebted to that great Teacher for the good that they had ; and if they would but adhere to the commands of God, as given in the Quran and the sacred writings, they would be successful and united, but if they set aside these commands they would become separated and degraded. And this, the King went on, is what is happening now; and he drew a picture of the sad condition of the Muslim world in general and the Arab people in particular at the present time. Some people imagine, he said, that the only remedy for this state is for Muslims to adopt European civilisation ; but this was not true, for the teachings of the Quran guarantee prosperity, unity and happiness to those who follow them, because they make no differentiation between King and commoner, save in respect of piety alone. Nor were foreigners alone to blame for all the calamities which had overtaken Islam, for amongst Muslims themselves they found some who were misguided and who were willing to aid them to work against Islam. “ I am the Herald of Islam ”, the King concluded. He was an Arab Muslim who served Islam and who worked for the spread of Islam and for Muslim unity ; and he was prepared to sacrifice himself and his family in the defence of Islam. He did not aim to be a chief of earth ; of greatest importance to him was to make God’s word supreme, and in pursuit of this he cared for no difficulties. Many had opposed him since he first put forward this aim but had been vanquished. What did they want of him ? His actions were clear ; he followed the Way. It had been said that he claimed to be Khalif over all Islam. He made no s;ach claim. A Khalif must enforce the commands of the Islamic religion over the whole world of Islam, and this was possible in the time of the Khalifat ; but was there a man who could so do at the present time ? It was clearly impossible and all he himself desired was unity and co-operation among Muslims. Behind him were more than 400,000 warriors ; if he wept they wept; if he re joiced they rejoiced and if he ecommanded they obeyed his commands. These were the Troops of Unity, the brethren of all who obeyed God, ready to fight for God and expecting nothing from it except to satisfy God ; and this was the force destined to confirm the Religious Law and Islam throughout the territories over which he ruled.

Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 149 (1330/28/38), dated the 15th May 1633. I have dealt in recent reports with two separate but inter-related subjects connected with the financial situation in this country, viz., {a) The proposed estab lishment of a National Bank under the auspices of the ex-Khedive (see correspon dence ending with my despatch No. 101 of April 5th); and (5) The position in regard to the payment of the Sa’udi Government’s debts, with special reference to debts in which His Majesty’s Government have a direct interest and to the use of drafts on customs to pay commercial debts (see correspondence ending with my despatch No. 123 of April 21st). 2. Both of these subjects have been brought into the lime-light as a more particularly of the article by Mr. Philby in the Times of April 26th. bo mr as official circles in the Hejaz are concerned, silence had for some time brooded over the Bank proposal. They have, I think, been a little perturbed at receiving no 4,f^' news as to the progress made by ‘Abdul Hamid Shedid since he left on April lOtiiwith his concession in his pocket and, I am now assured a small sum of cash down f™: “ uses This has doubtless madelbn Sa’ud and his entourage all the more sensitive regarding two misconstructions alleged to have been placed on Mr Philby’s article in the translation published by the Auram newspaper of Cairo. The A/mm version had according to people here, laid the Sa udi Government open to the accusations of having sold themselves to a group intending to create not a State Bank as Mr. Philby called it, but an international bank and of having mortgaged their customs revenue. Both accusations were repudiated in a long and indignent leading article in the Umm-al-Qura of May 12th and the second was categorically denied in an official communique of May 11th, published in the same issue of the Umm-al Qura. I enclose a translation of the communique. The Umm-al-Qura also published a letter from Mr. Philby correcting the misconstruc tions placed on his article. 3. The Umm-al-Qura leader is not worth reproducing as it is mostly diatribe- The most interesting points in it are the stress laid on the importance of the distinc tion between a state bank and an international bank, an explanation of the methods hitherto used to pay off debts and the use of drafts on customs in that connexion and a rather weaker attempt to rebut the suggestion that the adoption of the Bank proposal means countenancing usury. It is claimed that the Government have paid off more than half their debts in the last two years and the hope is expressed that, if some of the economic projects now in view materialise, the remainder will be settled shortly. 4. All this may amount to little more than a passing storm in a teacup hut I have though it worth recording as a sidelight on a curiously uncertain situation in regard to the proposed bank and the hopes that hang so largely, though not exclu sively, on the prospect of its being started. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to the Department of Overseas Trade, the Government of India, His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Egypt and to the High Commissioner for Transjordan. Enclosure 3 to Serial No. (18). Extract from the “ Umm-al-Qura ” of May 12th, 1933. Official Communique, dated 16th Muharram 1352 (11th May 1933). It has been rumoured by some people abroad that the Government have put in pledge their Customs Department in discharge of certain loans. The Govern ment confirm what they have already promulgated that they had not contracted any loan whatsoever and that they had not mortgaged the revenue of the Customs at all.

I am directed by Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister to transmit to you, to he laid before Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, a copy of a despatch from the Resident at Aden regarding the succession to the Sultanate of Lahej. 2. Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister agrees with the Resident’s views as to the atti tude which he should adopt in the matter, and, subject to Sir Samuel Hoare's concurrence, he proposes to approve the course of action suggested in paragraph 13 of the Resident’s despatch. 3. A similar letter is being sent to the Foreign Office and Air Ministry. Enclosure to Serial No. (19). Despatch from the Resident, Aden, to the Colonial Office, No. 65, dated the 22nd March 1933. I have the honour to refer to the recent political events in Lahej in connection with the succession to the Sultanate, that have been reported briefly in Politica Intelligence Summary, paragraph 2260, et seq. (File No. 26-N/33J.15 2. For very many years the custom in regard to the succession to the Sultanate of Lahej has been that af^er the death of the reigning Sultan his successor is elected by certain tribal Aqils and Qadtds, who are entitled to do so. The election is then , reported to the Resident, and the new Sultan is accorded official recognition unless there are very cogent reasons to withhold it. The customary procedure thus briefly outlined is common to the whole Protectorate. 3. There are five branches of the family of the Sultan of Lahej, in two of which (the Ali Muhsin and the Fadhl Muhsin)the succession has been confined with fairly regular alternation, since the death of the common ancestor, Sultan Muhsin Fadhl, in 1847. 4. On the acceesion of the present Sultan, His Highness Sir Abdul Karim bin Fadhl Ali Muhsin, in 1915, the heads of the Fadhl Muhsin refused to recognise him. In 1919 a rapproachment was brought about between this dissident element and His Highness, but the animosity still smouldered, and in 1930 it broke out in the form of a conspiracy, instigated by these persons during the absence of His Highness in India, to remove him and to arrange the succession of a member of the Fadhl Muhsin branch. The conspiracy was discovered ; and, on his return from India, the Sultan took such action against the ringleaders as he hoped would put an end to overt opposition to his authority. 5. In consequence of this incident His Highness made tentative proposals to the Residency that he should ensure continuity in the succession by proclaiming his eldest son, Sultan Fahdl bin Abdul Karim as heir-apparent. My predecessor advised him not to do so and the matter appeared to have dropped. 6. On the 12th February of this year, however, His Highness informed me that at the instance of the electors, and with his permission, an election had been held, that his eldest son Sultan Fadhl bin Abdul Karim had been unanimously elected as his successor, and that he had accordingly nominated him as such. 7. His Highness had caused or allowed these steps to be taken without prior reference to the Residency, and I was about to express my objections to this proce dure when the report was received of the attempted assassination of Sultan Fadhl at the hands or at the instigation of the leaders of the Fadhl Mohsin branch {vide Political Intelligence Summary, paragraph 2260, et seq). This new circumstances made it impolitic for me to advise His Highness to retract his recognition of Sultan Fadhl his successor, for the reason that His Highness’s acquiescence in my request might seem to be a concession to violence ; and I therefore considered it advisable to confine myself at the moment to asking His Highness for an explanation of the reasons that had prompted him in departing from the customary practice in regard to the succession. * 8. In reply His Highness explained that his action was designed to guard against the strife and dissension that are the usual consequences of disputes regarding the succession on the death of a tribal Chief. He. argued that the Sultanate of Lahej has come to be recognised as the centre of arbitration between tribal Chiefs over a wide area, and that it is therefore particularly necessary that continuous security and order should be ensured in it; and he pointed out that continuance of the custom hitherto existing in regard to the succession tended towards multiplicity of claimants and complexity of issue. He further contended that the electors, who are the custodians of custom, had themselves initiated the proposal of an election during his life-time, and that he had acceded to their wishes in the best interests o his State. 9. I have told His Highness that I am reporting what has occurred and the explanation that he has given me to His Majesty s Government. 10. A settlement of the succession during the life-time of the present Sultan will have considerable advantages if it is loyally observed w en is ' Since 1918 and especially during the past five years the Sultanate of Lahej has assumed an immportance unknown before the Great M ai, pnncipa y 11 personality of the present Sultan and to his advisers and assis an ^. . branch of the family. And the very close contact that has been es ^ abl ?^ e ^ f b ^ ral His Highness and the Residency in the consideration o a major m , importance in the Protectorate render continuity of succession ( q of policy), at Lahej, very desirable. MC364FD16 11 In view, however, of the uncertainty that must, in the nature of Arab tribal polity, still exist as to the actual accession of an heir-apparent on the death of a ru ling Chief, I consider that official recognition of a pre-elected successor would seldom be effective, and ought not to be accorded. 12. While, therefore, I am sympathetic towards the efforts of the Sultan of Lahei to protect the admirable results of his organisation and industry in Lahej from disintegration at the hands of a less able, and possibly hostile, successor who might be elected from another branch of the family, after his death, I do not recommend any departure, on our part, from the existing procedure in regard to succession. 13. I propose, therefore, subject to your approval, to limit myself to informing His Highness that the election has been noted, but that formal recognistion of his successor must be deferred until the latter s actual accession to the Sultanate j and I intend to avoid the use of any expression that would imply a guarantee by His Majesty ’s Government of the arrangement that has been made.

I am sending copies of the enclosed revised draft to Parkinson at the Colonial Office, and, at his suggestion, to Peirse at the Air Ministry, with the necessary explanations.is an extremely vague one, which, has been Enclosure to Serial No. (22). Attitude of His Majesty's Government towards the question of Arab Unity. 1. The phrase “ Arab Unity used in many different senses. 2. It is generally most in evidence on such occasions as Arab or Moslem congresses, and was freely bandied about during the Moslem Congress at Jeruselem in the autumn of 1931. On such occasions it is generally used extremely loosely as a popular rallying cry against either “ Western Imnerial- ism ” or the Zionist movement; but in actual fact it seldom mnounts to much more than a rather undigested idea of co-operation between Arabic- speaking people in matters of education and propaganda, but to some extent also in such politico-religious questions as that of the Hejaz railway, the future of the Holy Places, etc. Arab unity in this sense is something rather akin to pan- Arabism, and appears to have no more practical significance than the rather shadowy pan-Islamic movement, of which so much was heard some ten or twenty years ago. 3. From the political and practical point of view, “ Arab unity ” should mean the union, either in a single State or in a confederation of autonomous States, of all former Ottoman territories, south of present-day Turkey, which have a predomi nantly Arab population. This would to some extent limit the application of the idea to the north-western half of Arabia— i.e., to the Arabic speaking territo ries north-west of a line drawn from the middle of the Persian Gulf to the southern end of the Red Sea. It is in fact only to this area that the idea can be regarded as properly applicable, and it is therefore mainly from this point of view that the question is discussed in the present memorandum. But attempts may well be made to extend the idea of Arab unity to the Persian Gulf states and south-eastern Arabia. It is thus not possible to consider the problem without touching on its possible relation to these areas also. 4. The idea of Arab unity, as applied to the former Ottoman territories, i.e., to the Arabic speaking areas north-west of the line mentioned in the preceding paragraph, was the ultimate aim of the Arab Revolt during the War, and was the ideal for which the Hashimites, under Hussein and Colonel Lawrence, strove during the war and armistice periods. There is no doubt that the remaining members of the Hashimite family—Faisal, Ali and Abdullah have never aban doned this dream, although subsequent developments have rendered it wholly impracticable. 5. The most important of these subsequent developments, from the purely Arabian point of view, has been the rise to power of Ibn Saud, and his conquest of the greater part of the Arabian peninsula, including the former Kingdom of the Hejaz. The dynastic rivalry between the Hashimites and the Saudis renders it almost inconceivable that there could be any close or organic combi nation between the territories respectively ruled by them. It is true that^King Feisal of Iraq has come to terms with King Ibn Saud and is now in friendiy re lations with Saudi Arabia, and that we are working hard with at last a fail hope of success—to secure a similar ra'p'prohment between Ibn Saud and the Amir Abdullah of Transjordan. But the rivalry between the two family systems is still a basic factor in the situation, and unless one group were virtually to disappear, there seems no prospect whatever of any effective combination o tie territories at present ruled by Ibn Saud (i.e., the greater part of the Arabian peninsula, including the former kingdom of the Hejaz), with those at present rmet by the Hashimites, (i.e., the independent Kingdom of Iraq and the mandated territory of Transjordan). While the Arabs are themselves divided into these two great groups, any talk of Arab political unity in the viaer sense mms illusory. 6. It would, moreover, be impossible for His Majesty’s Government to either of these groups against the other, since they are oun J A tionstoboth. Apart from the support which the Hashmiites g a st cause during the Great War, King Feisal and the Amir u p* f [p p s shown themselves to be well-disposed towards His Majes y s ^ Amir hot necessary to enter into details, but two recent cases mSgSSSBBBBBBBBMH &amp; acn*Hra*«w'«■!&gt;/•»! Mi«.'iU!Uiu.J.J iTf l-S^Saw* iFftbv 18 Abdullah has by his co-operation, materially assisted His Majesty’s Government are the Druse rebellion of 1925, and the Pelestine disturbances of 1929. More over His Majesty’s Government are bound to King Feisal of Iraq by the Anglo- Iraqi Treaty of Alliance of 1930, and have a special responsibility to support the Amir Abdullah’s regime which has been set up in Transjordan under their direct protection as mandatory. On the other hand His Majesty’s Government are bound by special ties to King Ibn Saud in Saudi Arabia. They have main tained friendly and indeed cordial relations with Ibn Saud ever since the conclusion of the Treaty of Jedda in 1927. King Ibn Saud has not only main tained and developed these friendly relations but has proved himself capable of establishing and maintaining a stable and ordered Government in Arabia. It is moreover important for His Majesty’s Government with their great Moslem interests in India and elsewhere, to remain on friendly terms with the ruler of the Holy Places of Islam. In these circumstances all that His Majesty’s Government can do is to attempt to hold the balance evenly between the Hashimites on the one hand and the Saudis on the other, and, while doing all in their power to pro mote friendly relations between the two, to refrain from any action which might lead to the predominance in Arabia of either house at the expense of the other. 7. Apart from this major difficulty, there are also other elements in Arabia proper which are unlikely to be capable of combination in any unified system. The most important of these are the independent kingdom of the Yemen, whose ruler is short-sighted and quarrelsomy and on uncertain terms both with Ibn Suad and King Feisal, though he ostensibly has treaties of friendship with both ; and the various minor Arabian rulers, such as the Sheikhs of Koweit, Bahrain, Qatar and the Trucial Coast, who are extremely jealous of each other and of their own independence, and have never shown any sign of capacity for political co-operation. The Sultanate of Muscat and Oman and the Aden Protectorate need not for the moment be considered in this connexion. On the other hand if the protagonists of the political ideas of “ Arab unity ” were ever to succeed in translating their ideal into practice, it is probable that they would exercise strong pressure on the Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf and of Southern Arabia, and on the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, to join in furthering their aim. Such Sheikhdoms as Koweit and Bahrain are in close touch with Iraq and Saudi Arabia, both commercially and politically. Moreover, all these States, including Muscat, maintain a fairly close link with Saudi Arabia through the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, which is attended by many members of their ruling families. The pilgrimage offers exceptional opportuni ties not only for religious and cultural, but also for political, propaganda; and if Mecca were at any time to become a political centre of a united Arabia, or of a great Arabian confederation, it is possible that the political ideal for which it would stand might exercise a considerable attraction over the Arab rulers of the South Arabian and the Persian Gulf States and stimulate them to a greater desire to co-operate with the leading States of Western Arabia at any rate from the negative point of view of combatting western political and cultural influence in the Middle East. 8. As regards the minor Arab States of the Persian Gulf, an im portant consideration is the fact that, save in the case of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman (where, however, we exercise a dominating influ ence), the foreign relations of the rulers concerned are by treaty exclusively 7 conduct ed by His Majesty s Government and that His Majesty’s Government are bound by a series of treaties to give these States varying degree of protection against foreign aggression and to assist them to maintain their independence. Apart from -these treaty obligations, it is a basic principle of the policy of His Majesty’s Govern ment in the Middle East that these states should not be absorbed by any of their powerful neighbours, but should remain as far as possible independent units under effective British control. The development of inter-imperial air comunications, both civil and military, has, in the last few years, given this well-established prin ciple a new importance. In the case of Koweit, both King Feisal of Iraq and King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia have at various times shown signs of wishing to acquire a hoid ovei ulns territory 7 , which would be a useful acquisition to either. Both on treaty grounds, however, and on grounds of imperial policy, it is important to us that Kow eit should not be absorbed by either Saudi Arabia or Iraq. Similarly as re gains Bahrain, apart from our treaty obligations to protect the Sheikh againstaggression, it would be definitely against British interests that the islands should be' absorbed by either Saudi Arabia or Persia. King Ibn Saud has already, by Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, specifically recognised the special relations of His Majesty’s Government with the Arab States of the Persian Gulf and is not likely therefore to seek to annex Bahrain. Meanwhile it is one of our main objects in our negotiations with Persia to obtain a similar recognition by Persia of our special relations with Bahrain, etc., and the abandonment of the antiquated Persian claims both to Bahrain and to certain other Arab islands in the Gulf. In these circums tances it would clearly to impossible for His Majesty’s Government to acquiesce in the incorporation of any of the smaller independent Arab States whether in the Persian Gulf or in Southern Arabia in a wider Arabian political combination. 9. Meanwhile in the north and west any project for Arab unity in any practical sense of the word must come into conflict with the mandatory system in the French Levant States and in Palestine, with all that that system implies. The French, even if they were prepared to agree, on certain conditions, to the emancipation of the State of Syria proper, have made it clear that they have no intention of relin quishing their hold on the predominantly Christian State of the Lebanon, or, for the present at any rate, on the curious non-Arab enclave of the Jebel Druse. His Majesty’s Government are equally precluded from allowing Palestine to be absorbed in any way in any kind of predominantly Arab union, if only in view of their deep commitment to the policy of the Jewish national home, quite apart from their obligations to the other non-Arab or non-Moslem Communities and interests in Palestine proper. 10. From the point of view of practical politics, therefore, the question of Arab unity resolves itself into the possibility of some kind of combination, providing for the inclusion of indigenous non-Arab elements such as the Assyrians, Kurds, etc., between Iraq, Transjordan and the State of Syria. 11. As regards Transjordan, the union or combination of which with I ra T would at first sight seem easiest, since Transjordan is at present a purely Arab State and since its ruler is the brother of King Faisel, an initial difficulty is presented bv the fact that Transjordan is covered by the mandate for Palestine, of which it technically forms on integral part. It would therefore be necessary before any effective combination between Transjordan and Iraq could , b « the His Majesty’s Government should arrange for the release of Transjordan x ^ mandate Transjordan does not, however, at present appear to fulfil any of t “Sons which have been laid down by the League of dtj tofome release of a territory from the mandatory regime. , f ib e r atffin extent fulfil these conditions a factor which might a Jetish from the mandate is the possibility that there may at no b ® a settlement in Transjordan. While there can b \ n ^f thelstabllhmf Xof jordan the articles of the Palestine mandate which e ^ ab T “ 0 “dan the Jewish national home, the existence of a Jewish minority “ would certainly increase the difficulties in the way of bringing the mandatoiy regime in that territory to an end. • , 12. As regards the State of Syria, there is no doubt 1 al of Iraj! contemplating the possibility of its emancipation, an t^^ are g congidering the and Arab nationalists generally, both m ra 'l V ' , t j e rulership of a single possibility of a union of Syria and Iraq, perhaps ^der «ie ^ulem p individual. There are, however, various difficulties and objections to P J 13. In the first place, the French is probable that the completely. Even if Syria were to be released bom the ^ ^t ^ 0 P n the lines 0 f the mandate would be replaced by a Franco- 3’ ni ' | cliat the Syrian portion of Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930. The position ^“ 0 ™ of a republic or of a monar- the new State, or confederation, whe er 1 ma ; n under predominantly French chy, would be bound to France, and ^MTportffin would be bound to this political and cultural influence ^ j 11 1 aqn wou ld remain under predominantly country under the Anglo-IraqiGeatyo a situation of international rivalry British influence. This might well lead ^ a which would produce serious interna iona ^ ^ development than Iraq 14. Again, Syria is at present ^ larger and more flourishing. Although its people are perhaps less vvr. , ce(i Jn any oase , it is a far mor e and its culture and civilisation are moi MC364FD20 agreeable country to live in. It is probable, therefore, that Iraqis would be increas ingly attracted to the Syrian towns of Damascus and Aleppo, and thus perhaps also to the even more definitely French district of the Lebanon or town of Beirut, and that Syrian—and thus French—influence would tend to establish itself increas ingly in Iraq proper. The capital of the new State might even be moved to Damascus which is an infinitely pleasanter town than Bagdad, and as a result Franco-Syrian influence might spread eastwards until the whole character of Iraq and of the politi cal relationship between His Majesty’s Government and that country might be transformed. It is clear that the immediate interests of His Majesty’s Government, particularly in regard to the safety of inter-imperial communications, which have been so carefully protected by the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930, would suffer serious injury as the result of such a development. 15. The questions dealt with in paragraphs Nos. 12, 13 and 14 above were considered by the Ministerial Middle East sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on November 17th, 1931, and the relevant conclusions then reached ran as follows :— (1) That the outcome most likely to be to the advantage of His Majesty’s Government would be the constitution of Syria as a republic with a Syrian as President; (2) That for a single individual to hold the crowns both of Syria and Iraq would be most undesirable, and would, in ay case, be likely to prove unworkable ; (3) That any attempt by King Feisal to transfer his crown from Iraq to Syria would be contrary to British interests. 16. Even were all these immediate dynastic and political obstacles to be surmounted, it is very doubtful whether real Arab unity could ever be achieved even between the major States such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq, etc., if only for purely geographical reasons. In actual fact, notwithstanding its apparent homogeneity and compactness, there is no geographical unity in Arabia. The northren countries, such as Iraq, Syria, Palstine and Transjordan, all differ widely from each other in configuration, soil, climante and general character. Southern Arabia, although it appears to possess a certain unity from a first glance at the map, can really more accurately be described as an archipelago of human settlements in a sea of desert, inhabited by tribes who are driven by the exigencies of desert life into becom ing, as it were, land pirates ceaselessly preying on each other. Any idea of unity or confederation based on the ordinary European conceptions which such words suggest is quite inapplicable to an area of this type. 17. But from the point of view of general international co-operation and under standing, of cultural development, and of economic prosperity, His Majestys’ Government can naturally only view with sympathy any movement which tends to bring the peoples of the Arabian countries into closer and more friendly relations with each other, provided, of course, that it is not incompatible with their special treaty relations and responsibilities towards certain of the States concerned. They have indeed alwmys done whatever has been possible to this end. The improvement of the last few years in relations between Iraq and Saudi Arabia has been mainly due to the efforts of His Majesty s Government, who brought about the reconciliation bet ween King Feisal and King Ibn Saud on in board H. M. S. “ Lupin ” in February 1930, His Majesty s Government are now actively engaged in trying to bring about a similar improvement in relations between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan, and that these may lead to the conclusion of a treaty settlement, including treaties of friendship and bon visinage, between King Ibn Saud and the Amir Abdullah, corresponding to the treaty settlement concluded between Saudi Arabia and Iraq in April 1931. His Majesty s Government have moreover always sought to further the close co-operation of the Arab countries in economic matters, and have suceeded m securing fqi Iraq and Transjordan, by suitable provisions in the relevant instru- 1 ^ len , s ’ ^ ie ri 8’hl 1°. accord specially favourable tariff treatment to neighbouring Arab States, notwithstanding their most-favoured-nation obligations to other countries. ° n k^ould the question of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards ie problem of Arab unity be raised in the course of King Feisal’s impending visit to this country, it is submitted that it should be explained that the general attitudet‘S sl . ih *5 S&lt; 'rifc rkn Mi from eatli li lentska^ tlifeiil® njk 21 of His Majesty’s Government will be one of friendly sympathy towards any cons tructive proposals for peaceful co-opertion and for the development of close and friendly relations among the leading states of Arabia ; King Feisal could be left to • explain in greater detail exactly what he has in mind ; but, since it is not possible for His Majesty’s Government, for the reasons explained above, and especially in paragraphs 6, 8 and 15, to support any policy designed to bring about the political unification of Arabia, it seems desirable that any suitable opportunity should be taken to discourage King Feisal from identifying himself with, or committing himself to, such a project. Such discouragement might, for instance, take the form of advising His Majesty, as Sir Francis Humphrys has already done, that he can best serve the Arab cause by concentrating his energies on the peaceful development of his own country’s resources and institutions, so that, the Government of Iraq may serve as a model and a source of encouragement to other Arab states. 19. In any case Sir Francis Humphrys has suggested that it would be well to do whatever may be possible to discourage King Feisal from holding a Pan Arab Congress in Bagdad, as it has been proposed that he should do this autumn. While the arguments which may be used with King Feisal against the holding of a Congress must necessarily depend to some extent on the course which the discussion of this aspect of the question with him may take, the following considerations might perhaps usefully be brought to His Majesty’s notice. 20. In the first place is it clear that none of the causes which King Feisal may be presumed to have most at heart—e.#., the consolidation and international standing of Iraq or the future prospects of the Hashimite family in general—are likely to be furthered by the holding of an Arab or Moslem Congress either in Bagdad or elsewhere at the present time. The proceedings of the Congress, for which King Feisal could not escape a considerable measure of responsibility, could hardly fail to produce an adverse reaction at least on the French, and therefore not only prove internationally embarrassing but also render relations between Iraq and Syria mor6 difficult. The opportunity of the Congress would moreover .almost certainly be taken to raise in an acutely controversial form such embarrassing questions for the Hashimite family as that of the Amir Abdullah s attitude towaids the Jewish Settlement in Transjordan, his relations, both now and in the recent past, with King Ibn Sand, and his attitude towards certain Arab parties m Palestine itself. Moreover, the Congress would almost certainly, as in the case of the Jerusalem Congress of 1931, give an opportunity to zealots or mischief makers to make anti- foreign speeches which would lead to bitter resentment m foreign countries with Moslem interests, such as France and Italy ; it would offer a favourable opportunity for anti-Hashimite propaganda intrigue, and would inevitably tend to intensity e existing divisions in Arab opinion rather than to bring about a spirit of friendly an effective co-operation among Arab peoples. Some of these arguments h^ve alie y been used orally with King Feisal by Sir Francis Humphrys last F .^ a ^ and and King Feisal then stated, that be was most anxious to avoid d° in g ^ which might have the effect of antagonising his neighbours or cause annoy n or embarrassment to His Majesty’s Government. lere 18 re ., , r* r s however, that His Majesty has not yet comp etely abandoned ^ and it is very desirable from every point of view that he should now be strongly urged to make up his mind against its being held a a ( 23 ) Memorandum No. 52/1550/1427/2, dated the 2nd June 1933.

Sheykh Abdullah Suleyman demurred to this, but indicated that he was prepared to agree to a reference of disputes to arbitration, when anyone, English or otherwise, might be selected as one of the arbitrators. 3. Sheykh Muhammad Ibrahim Jawan Bakhsh appeared satisfied with his conversation with the Minister of Finance and subsequently addressed to him a letter embodying his terms for the grant of the concession. I enclose a translation of this letter. 4. The present electrical equipment of Mecca consists of some ten or twelve separate plants, of which the most important are the one supplying the Haram, one in the King’s Palace, three in palaces of Amir Faisal and one or two in Govern ment buildings, the house of the Minister of Finance and possibly other members of the Royal Family. 5.

Believing this election to have been in order, I have accorded recognition to Sheikh Muhsin bin Ali Nashir and authorised the payment to him of the stipend previously enjoyed by his late brother, in accordance with the authority contained in Colonial Office despatch No. 22, dated 30th May 1929.

In paragraph 5 of my despatch No. 23 of the 17th January, I stated that so far as I could make out, the frontier between Azir and the Yemen appeared to abut on the sea at the mouth of the Wadi Tashar and to run iman ^ c 1 t which I proceeded to indicate. On re-reading the relevant papers n a probably too guarded as regards the terminal on the sea. uncertain whether the frontier has been agreed as regards its 1 § - ed certain that it has not been delimited, the Saudi official commu q P ^ on the 6th January and forwarded with my prmted despa c • c } a i me d January, speaks definitely of the Wadi Tashar, to vhic e therefore to have advanced, as being the furthest district on the coast. It may the: MC364FD'■ |f i ri p ; | | OTiV' 1 24 be assumed that the mouth of the Wadi in question is the boundary point in the eyes of the Saudi Government and the Government of the Y emeu probably take the same view. 2 I think it worth while to draw attention to this point, even though it is unlikely to have escaped you, as it may be important for naval purposes to have a definite indication of the coastal point at which Saudi Arabia ends and the Yemen begins In this connexion I may add that I now learn privately from the com manding officer of H. M. S. Penzance that the Island of Ashik, which I mentioned in paragraph 5 of the enclosure in my despatch No. 104 of the 9th April regarding naval visits to the Farsan Islands, &amp;c., lies off the coast 30 miles south of Jizan, 11 miles north-north-west of Medi and about 2 miles south of the mouth of the Wadi Tashar. 3.

Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 118, dated the 16th April 1933. No. 1. With reference to paragraph 32 of the Jedda report enclosed in my despatch No. 102 of the 7th April (F. 81-N./33), I have the honour to state that Ibn. Sa’ud arrived in Jedda early yesterday and gave the usual series of formal audiences to the heads of foreign missions in the forenoon. He is staying at a large house which has recently been built by the Minister of Finance about a mile outside the town. It is already rumoured that the so-called “ Green Palace ” is to be turned into a hotel. • Be this as it may, it is interesting to note the tightening of the con nexion between His Majesty and Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, who spends but little time in Jedda and may have built his new house partly with a view to his master’s convenience. 2. I found the King affable, but he did not appear to be in the same good form as when I last saw him at the end of last August; I cannot say that he looked ill, but he gave the impression of suffering from nervous worry. He seemed distrait, and I had to initiate almost every subject of conversation. The nature of the audience required that the topics should be general. We discoursed of our respective states of health, the excellent rains that have fallen in Nejd, the virtues of water and the broader aspects of the recent pilgrimage. The most striking feature of this last part of the conversation was the King’s eagerness to assure me of his readiness to entertain suggestions for the betterment of pilgrimage condi tions. He repeated this assurance at least twice. 3. Mr. Furlonge, who was with me, agrees generally with my impression of the King’s physical state. He had not seen His Majesty for nearly two years and would not like to express himself too confidently, but he thought that Ibn Sa’ud presented the appearance of having aged considerably. 4. The King’s plans appear to be uncertain. If I should have any conversa tion with him of an important nature during his stay in Jedda, I will report sepa rately. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad, to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Transjordan, to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and to His Majesty’s Chief Commis sioner at Aden.

Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter No. E. 2990/2990/25, dated 19th June 1933. Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 139- (1328/398/2), dated the 15th May 1933. In paragraph 18 of the Jedda Report for January to March 1932 (F. 139-N./32), Mr. Hope Gill mentioned a Sa’udi Commercial Code, the serial publication of which had been completed during that period. On my return to Jedda at the end of May 1 found awaiting me a portly volume containing a rough manuscript transla tion of this enormous document, which took up much space in successive numbers of the Umm-al-Qura newspaper from August 7th, 1931 to February 26th, 1932 inclusive. The vicissitudes of the remainder of the year made it impossible for me to give attention to it. Now that the storms of rebellion had died down, I owe it to the industry of my translators, if for no other reason, to give some brief account of so considerable an addition to the modern legislation of this country. It will be very brief indeed, as the code is a mere white elephant at present. It would be useless labour to check the translation, to have it typed and to study it closely. 2. The code is not one which the ordinary religious courts of this country would ever dream of applying. It is designed solely for the purpose of tribunals of the type known as Majlis-at-Tujar or Council of Merchants. Only one such court exists at present. It has its being in Jedda but I understand that its juris diction in commercial cases is supposed to extend to Mecca. Bo far as I know it is a very inept body but one seldom hears it mentioned at all, never, in my ex perience, in connexion with any important commercial suit. 3. The code provided for the use of this non-professional tribunal consists of four parts. Part I (Articles 1 to 149) deals with commerce on land and contains chapters dealing with the usual matters, including companies, agency, bills of exchange and insolvency. Part II (Articles 150 to 431) deals with maritime commerce and comprises, among others, chapters on the ownership of ships, seamen, bills of lading, freight and charter-party, passages, hypothecation of ships, etc., marine insurance and average. Part III (Articles 432 to 533) is devoted to the organisation and procedure of the Majlis-at-Tujar. Part IY (Articles 534 to 622) contains schedules of fees for various proceedings. Article 62o makes lie cot e operative from the date of publication, presumably the date of the last instalment, as the code is not otherwise dated. The last Article, 624, charges lie iceroy with the execution of its provisions, a clause which indicates that, even m prmcip e, the code was intended only to apply to the Hejaz, which at the time had not yet been merged in a unified Sa’udi Arabia. 4. I learn from Fuad Bey Hamza, who was probably the principal author of the code, that it was based mainly on the old Ottoman codes see 'loung. Corps de Droit Ottoman, Volume VII, page 55 «.). So far as I J u ^; . • hurried glance I should say that in the case o. Par s an ni, man f! 0( i e had been done very freely, whereas Part II seems o o | r ^ n0 of Maritime Commerce more closely. I confess, owever, time to study the Sa’udi text in detail. 5.

Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (29). Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 182 (1702/199/10), dated the 14th June 1933. With reference to my despatch No. 119 of April 18,1 have the honour to state that Ibn Sa’ud again came to Jedda early on June 10, in anticipation of an early departure for Riyadh. He gave his usual series of formal audiences to heads of foreign missions that morning, beginning with me, as the Soviet Minister was in Mecca. His Majesty appeared to be in good form and was as affable as usual, I presented Mr. Calvert. 2. Following on general conversation of the usual anodyne character, the King observed that the autumn was his busy time in Nejd, as it was there that the leading people flocked about him, each expecting the personal attention of the sovereign. He went on to say that within a year to two his son Sa’ad might be trained enough to relieve him of this burden. I took the opportunity of con gratulating His Majesty in person on the action he had so wisely taken to provide for the future of the throne. The King, in thanking me, stressed the fact that he had not taken the initiative but yielded to the appeals of his people. 3. The King’s remark about the Amir Sa’ud derives some significance from a report which reached me on June 3, in a form too uncertain to be worth reporting at the time that the King was contemplating abdication and was only waiting for tne return of the mission he had sent to the V emen, Without wishing to exaggerate the probability of such an event at some not too distant date, I think that it should he borne in mind as a possibility. To a European it may seem unlikely that a man of 53 with Ibn Sa’ud’s past should contemplate such a step at the height of his achievement. I am not sure, however, that it would be alien to his character to retire in favour of the son, whom he has so spectacularly installed as Heir Apparent, hoping perhaps to guide the steps of his successor during the remainder of his own life. It is nearly three years since Fuad Bey spoke to me of the King’s desire to reduce his burden of responsibility and “ to reign rather than to rule ”,27 fISR ffilSldk ;es ible as • d indi0ati01 f of a slow mOTe - of old.

I sought a further audience with the King on June 11, to discuss business I will report what passed separately m connexion with the subjects I raised in own 11 aS ^ ^ necessar y to rec °rd it. The King broached no subject of his 6 Ibn Sa’ud returned t 0 Mecca late on June 12. During his short stay His Majesty gave a great deal of time to Captain H. C. Armstrong, who is writing his biography and whom he consented, as a result of correspondence through the Sa udi minster m London, to receive in Jedda. Captain Armstrong arrived on June 7. He had a general conversation with the King on June 10, and had four further audiences on June 11 and 12 of an average duration of some two hours each. The King has been most forthcoming and both parties appear to be exceedingly pleased^with each other. I have avoided any appearance of promoting Captain Armstrong’s enterprise but he is staying with my wife and me on the g trength of old friendship. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Excellency the Viceroy of India (Foreign and Political Department), His Majesty’s Ambassador^at Baghdad, His Majesty’s High Commissioners at Jerusalem and Cairo, the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, and to His Majesty’s Chief Com- ihissioner at Aden. ( 30 ) (Received on 22nd July 1933, with Political Secretary's letter No. 27, dated the 6th July 1933.) Letteb from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 110, DATED THE 16TH May 1933. No. 1. In paragraph 32 of the Jedda report for March (F. 81-N./33), enclosed in my despatch No. 102 of the 7th April, I mentioned that Ibn Sa’ud had given a dinner to notable pilgrims on the evening of the 31st March. As you are aware, this is now a regular feature of each year’s pilgrimage season. On the present occasion, the King entertained some hundreds of guests of various nationalities, including several Indians. I understand from my Indian Vice-Consul that the attention shown both to Shia and to Indian pilgrims has been a feature of this year’s pilgrimage. In the case of the Indians the King and the Minister of Finance, who is largely responsible for dispensing such attention, had the advantage of the presence of Jemal Pasha Ghazzi, who has been conducting since last year an intensive pro-pilgrimage campaign in India and was able to make play with the intimacy he had established there with various participants in this year’s Haj. 2. It is the King’s custom to speak at great length at these annual banquets. The published version of his address on the present occasion occupied a page and a half of the Umm-al-Qura of the 6th April. I enclose a short summary prepared in the Legation.3. The King preached from his usual text, the need for unity in Islam, but he seems to have restrained almost entirely the tendency which he has sometimes shown in the past to give offence by his utterances regarding people who do not share his views. I understand that the published version of his speech represents the original pretty accurately, although the actual language used in certain passages may have been more emphatic. I have heard only one definite suggestion of any important omission. According to my Persian colleagues the King gave as one of the reasons why he could not aspire to the Caliphate the fact that so many Muslim countries are under alien denomination. He is said to have included in the number Egypt as being under the thumb of Great Britain. If he really said this, it cannot have been pleasing to all his Egyptian hearers, though it might gratify some of them. 4.

(As published in Umm-al-Qura, April 6, 1933.) • P e opJe, His Majesty said, enjoy one great blessing from God m the teachings of the Prophet, which have descended on them like the fertilising rgm on the earth, and have been the means by which they have spread their influence over vast territories. All Moslems were indebted to that great Teacher for the good that they had ; and if they would but adhere to the commands of and’ufoteTTufoif th T ^ SaCred WritingS ’ ^ would be successful and degraded.

As visit tvas planned eonsider- able time ago and no objection was raised, His Majesty’s Government entirely agree that cancellation or even postponement should be 1 avoided Besides if objection were raised at a time when Ibn Sand is in trouble with rebellion and at least there is ground for suspicion of Hashmite connivance, it would only help to justify too worst suspicions and might lead to serious complications in future. Moreover, in view of reported plot for assassination of Emir, it wOWId suggest that Iraq Authorities could not guarantee safety of distinguished visitor. General effect on relations between Iraq and Bejaz-Nejd would be deplorable and this would be particularly unfortunate oil eve of Iraq’s com plete emancipation. + I therefore hope yon will succeed in inducing King and Iraq Government both to agree to projected visit and also to ensuring that Emir meets with adequate reception. This refers to your telegram 228 of June 23rd and Jedda telegram 122 to yon and 97 to Foreign Office.

In view of the circumstances of my recent absence: it may be worth while to give a short account of certain matters connected with my return. ^ 2. I reached Jedda in H.M.S. “ Hastings ” on the morning of May 30. I was met on board by Hamdi Bey, the Director General of Military Organization, who had been sent from Mecca to present the King’s compliments and who was accompanied by a junior officer. I was welcomed at the quay bv the Governor of Jedda in person, attended by all the principal local officials holding subordinate posts. o. As this was my first landing in Jedda from a warship since my first ai ii\al, 1 cannot be ceitain that the sending of Hamdi Bey to meet me was in Ihe nature ol an extra courtesy 7 but I got the impression that the Hejazi Gov ernment veie anxious to show the maximum of politeness on this particular occasion Hi order to show my appreciation, I made the official announcement . nr | 1 ,.? 1 . ore formal. _ I enclose a copy’- of my note to the Ministry ot I oieign Allans and a translation of the Acting Minister’s acknowledgment. • ^ ie bhh Ausuf A asin arrived in Jedda on the evening of June 2. Ho visited me the next morning and expressed in the most cordial terms the King’s satisfaction and his own at my return in good health. He went on to congra tulate me on the anniversary of King George’s Birthday and delivered the message embodied m my telegram No. 64 of June 3. 6 5. Sheykh Yusuf Yasin came again in the afternoon to the reception held by my wife and myself to celebrate His Majesty’s Birthday. The gathering of Lmopeans, local notables Indian, etc., was a large one for Jedcla and both bheykh A usul and the Governor were full of friendliness. 6. I am afraid that Sheykh Yusuf Yasin’s journey from Taif to Jedda was undertakeii primarily wift the object of pressing me in connection with the Ibn Rifada incident which so unfortunately came to a head just before my h fm n. J t is nevertheless gratifying to have evidence of so strong a desire on the part of Ibn Sa ud and his Government to treat the episode arising out of he Bakhit case as dead and buried, at any rate for the time being. I think duit their general attitude has been a good deal affected for the better by the reception accorded to the Amir Peysal’s mission in London and more especially &gt;&gt; io o egiam addressed by His Majesty the King* to King ’’Abdul ’Aziz on the occasion of its departure.

I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that I resumed charge of His Britannic Majesty’s Legation on my arrival in Jedda this morning. I take this opportunity of requesting you to convey to His Majesty King ’Abdul ’Aziz the respectful expression of my gratitude for the messao-e of welcome which He deigned to transmit to me through Harndi Bey on the occasion of my return to my post and of the satisfaction with which I learnt that His Majesty continues in the enjoyment of good health.

( 84 ) {Received on 24th July 1932, with Political Secretary's letter No. 27-P.Z., dated the 7 th July 1932.) Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, No. 240, dated the 29th June 1932. I I have discussed with King Faisal the question of the Emir’s visit. Ac cording to the Palace there never has been a definite arrangement for a visit to Baghdad but some months ago it was vaguely suggested from Jedda that the Emir might on his return home pass through Iraq no dates being gu en. Nothing has since this been heard of Emir’s movements or plans of which no record exists in my Secretariat. Faisal is much embarrassed by his proposed stay in Baghdad just now for following reasons (1) Baghdad in July is at i s worst temperature over 120 in the shade. Most important people are awa&gt; and official receptions are very difficult. There will be nothing w a ever oi him to do and he will probably go away with bad impression oi Iraq, (2) lo accommodate him King will have to turn out of his summer residence, (3) Assyrian question if not previously scotched will be at i s mos cn ica stage wdiich Faisal naturally does not wish to advertise to Emu. He would have preferred Emir to leave Persia via Mohammerah and return via Basra to Nejd. I have however persuaded Faisal to offer Emir cordial welcome at^Baghdad and to give him as adequate reception as is possible m e i confident personally I feel that result is not likely to be very happy. that Emir will run no risk of injury during his stay m T from Iraq, any information as to proposed length of stay or metho I am enquiring about this from Teheran.81 (85) ' {Received on 31st July 1933, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 28, dated the 1 14th July 1932.)

I have the honour to report that the Italian Government have raised the status of their representation in this country to that of a Legation and that Com- mendatore Ottavio Be, Peppo has been nominated to the post thus created as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary. 2. This step, of which I was notified on the 31st May by the official left in charge of the Italian Consulate on the departure of Commendatore Sollazzo on the 12th April, results naturally from Article 2 of the Treaty signed between Italy and the Hejaz-Nejd on February 10th last, a translation of the Arabic text of which was forwarded to you under cover of Mr. Hope Gill’s despatch No. 207 of the 12th May. 3.

Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 26th July 1932. Letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jeddah, to the Foreign Office, No. 205, dated the 11th May 1932. In my immediately preceding despatch [Serial No. (67)], is transmitted a translation of a speech delivered by Ibn Sand in Mecca on the 12th April, as reported in the u Umm-al-Qura” I understand from some who were present that much more was said in the same vein of religions emotion, but that Oie newspaper has succeeded in adequately reproducing the main gist of the matter. 2. The occasion was the customary Royal banquet given to some 500 repre sentative Moslems three days before they set out to observe the dav of pilgrim age at Arafat. Neither the Indian vice-consul nor, I think, anv of the Moslem foreign representatives were present although they were invited. A number of prominent Indian pilgrims attended, However. 3 3. The speech as heard and retailed has been badly received and m severelv criticised, the remark : “ By God, I fear the foreigner once, but I fear those who pretend to be Moslem three thousand times,” being regarded as particularlyoffensive. My Turkish and Iraqi colleagues are hio-hlv hiceiiQ^ n+ n plimentary reference to the Saudi regime’s predecessors th 'l- then done, the sms committed, and the peace violated ” t ’ ^ ru, i3 . l0 ? dsile(: } that when Ibn Sand came to Jeddah after the nilorimsera i, 1 ^ ledib ^ r ^niornied of leading Jedawis, by greeting them with the fords. ' I eoiwent the 'tWs of every one of you.” UL tne Cllr oats 4. All obsevvei-s are agreed that Ibn Sand is at his wits’ end to obtain money, and many affirm that he is feeling insecure. He certainly seems to nw lost much ot the poise and balance which distinguished him in the early days oi his Hejazi adventure. His present state of uncertainty, with its symptomatic lack of control of ideas and expression, but not yet of action, seems to me to e caused by a very real fear for his financial position, an increased feeling of futility amid the complexities of government, and a growing sense of the hostility which surrounds him in the Hejaz and the Moslem world outside. It was noticed that during the forty-eight hours which he recently spent at Jedda he remained outside the town, which he normally never fails to visit for some inspection or other 5 indeed he hardly put foot outside the palace building*. 5* The. effect of these obsessions is aggravated by ill health. At my short formal audience of the 1st May Ibn Saud was listless, and looked a very different man from what he was a year and a half ago. His face had yellowed under the skin and was pouchy, puckered, and much more lined. Dr. Naji-al-Asil, who has had a number of private audiences in Mecca, confirms my impression that Ibn Saud is physically very unwell and mentally obsessed by problems which he cannot solve and Which he now fears to face. It is probable that he will return to Riyadh as soon as he decently can, probably in less than a month’s time. 6 . I may here mention that on the 1 st May Ibn Baud was polite, but distant. He smiled once or twice, but had nothing to say. I purposely allowed two long pauses to lengthen in order to draw, if possible, some reference to current topics, such as the Minister’s absence. Ibn Sand at length broke the first silence with a comment on the weather, which had already received adequate comment. 1 broke the second one myself with a request for permission to leave.

According to private accounts of the gathering His Majesty indulged m extremely strong lano-nao-e about the abuses complained of by pilgrims and, while excusing the irregularities practised by exploiters of the poorer sort, criticized m the severest terms people in intermediate positions and most of all those of the highest class, including it is said, his own officials. He is reported to have spoken of chopping off heads’ as a remedy which M had thought of applying at once, and with his own hand but for which on the present occasion he was substituting a warning ; and to have attacked the younger of his hearers for their inclination to read Egyptian political literature and to tread in the materialistic ways of Europe. 2. There may be a goojA deal of exaggeration in the version which I have summarized in the preceding parag’raph but the speech seems neveitheless to have been intended as a cautionary sermon for the special benefit of the Hejazis. The IJmm-al-Qura published on May 27, a long account of it in which it is pos sible to detect the boom of menace in the sea of somewhat militant piety to which Ibn Sand has accustomed his Moslem hearers. “ You know ”, he said “ that we entered the Hejaz only after we have been fought against in our home. By God, we do not withstand anything unless we are first attacked, and if we are attacked we defend our religion, ourselves, our nation and home ; and God grants us success which is a blessing from him. When we arrive at a place we order its people to follow the commands in the Holy Book and the traditions of the Prophet. We are only warriors in the cause of God 3. The King, according to the Umm-al-Qura report, described his readiness to inquire into the state of the people and his care for their welfare. “ Oh people of this holy and sacred land ”, he cried, “ by God, I look at the old as my father, the middle aged as my brother and the young as a son. What I say is what 1 believe and God is the best witness He went on to define his attitude towards modern civilization. He would depart in nothing from the commands of God as conveyed by the Prophet ; he would accept what was beneficial and permitted by Islam, opposing what was contrary to it. There was no civiliza tion preferable or better than that of Islam. 4. Presently the King delivered himself of the following passages :— “ You must advise ignorant people and guide them to the right path. If he follows the advice, thank God, but if he refuses he will be responsible for his sin, “ I swear by God that I like peace and endeavour to maintain it but in ease I am afflicted, I keep still till the very end, and if the time of defence comes I will defend the religion and country. “ If there is nothing to ride on except spear heads, the compelled one cannot help riding on them. Then there will be one of two alterna tives : either happiness or martyrdom, and each of them is a bless ing from God. We are prepared to meet either of them with open arms and cheerful faces, as this is the tradition of the Prophet of God and his friends after him ”. 5. The King went on to divide people generally into three classes, the helpers, the indifferent, whom efforts should be mad$ to guide in the right way, and the opposers, whose punishment w r ould be great in this world and in the next. He called upon his hearers, as being the chiefs and leaders of the nation, to submit any complaints to him and to give him their guidance, bearing in mind, however, the injunction of the Caliph Omar to one who sought to advise him, that it should be “ between me and him ”. He would investigate any com plaint he received. His hearers should engage in useful work. “ The land of God is so vast and broad, you should go round about and do some work, eschewing laziness, which brings evil results ”. He had brought them together to counsel them, so that the stupid might not be tempted by clemency to per severe in error. He warned them against apostasy and deviation from Islam in these holy lands. Any that he saw guilty of such deviation would be severly punished, as would be those who were tempted by the devil to commit subversive actions. These he would treat as dynamite. Anyone who had a grievance against another could appeal to him, even though the complaint was against his son Feysal ; and, if he* neglected the complaint and upheld his son, then his owm conduct would give just ground for complaint. ft84 MdGoijjjtjjt; pWteiife editions o{| 'd liis reafe l e. “ObA I I saris ns ne kisattitis i tlie coial ilntakitWi diftlietifJ ry. the#® 8.

Letter from the British Embassy, Moscow, to the Foreign Office, No. 329 dated the 21st June 1932. I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of a message which appeared in the “ Izvestiya ” 0 f to-day’s date emanating from a London correspondent of that paper regarding the present state of affairs in the Hejaz. Tt is suggested, apparently on the basis of an article published during the last few days in the “ Morning Post ”, that His Majestv’s Gov ernment are interested in the downfall of the Government of Ibn Sand and for that purpose are fomenting disorder on the Northern and Western frontiers of the Hejaz. 2. It is hardly a matter for surprise that Colonel Lawrence and the Intel ligence Service come into the picture though—strangely enough—no mention is made of Sir Henri Deterding. 3. Although the upshot of such conversations as presumably took place between Emir Feisal and the Soviet Government on the occasion of the former’s visit to Moscow (see my despatch No. 299 of the 6th June) [Serial No. (17) in F. No. 123-N.j32], has been kept dark, a strong hint of their nature can be gleaned from Sir Andrew Ryan’s telegram No. 75 of the 13th June according to which Ibn Saud represents the Soviet Government as being willing, under certain conditions, to lend the Hejaz Government up to one million pounds sterling. Publicly, at least, the Soviet Government is principally interested in the trade possibilities of the Hejaz (see my despatch No. 296 of the 6th June);, but the potential expansion in that direction is limited, and it is therefore to be presumed that relations with this important Moslem State are governed by r considerations of policy dictated by the Communist Party which aims at spreading communist influence in Moslem countries. Confirmation of the existence of a fresh orienta tion of Soviet policy with regard to the Moslem world would appear to be forth coming from Mr. Ogilvie Forbes’ memorandum of the 30th May (F. 0. despatch No. 386 of the 11th June) according to which the Soviet Government are endea vouring to represent themselves as the defenders of Islam against Christian interference.

The “ Morning Post ” is suspiciously “ well informed ” with regard to the state of affairs in the Hejaz. The paper openly “ foretells ” that the reign of Ibn Saud is coming to an end. “ It is more than possible ”, states the newspaper, that the hopeless (?) economic condition of the Hejaz brought about by the general financial crisis, end still further deteriorated by a drought of two years duration, will be follow ed by a revolution.”ixrw ovp the moving forces of this “ revointion ’&gt; which the “ Morning ... predicts and which, when they take place m young Nationalist |° a t are to benS to British imperialism? The paper explains tl^t the stales axe o-oina- to be carried on by the warlike tribes of Koweit IndBilh 111 These tribes migrated in the past to the Northern (Palestine) and to the Western (Sinai Peninsula and Egypt) frontiers of Hejaz. Part of the nomads have penetrated into the territory under British rule The forces of f he rebels are concentrated, according to the paper, m the neighbourhood of the Jauf oasis and also on the shores of the Southern part of the Bay of Sinai and of the Red Sea. states the paper, “ that these emigrants are being “ There are signs ora’anised by the agents 7 of some secret service. The fact that families and herds do not accompany the nomads returning to the He^az is a pi oof of piepaia- tions for an attempt at organised revolutionary activities. In conclusion, the paper promises the rebels aid against Ibn Saud. It is exceedingly possible that the arabs of the Sinai Peninsula, Palestine and Transiordania will cross the frontiers of the Hejaz and will help the insurgents to overthrow the Government which protects the sect (Wahabis) which is governed on the principles of autocracy and proselytism ”. This information is stated to emanate from Cairo, where according to Colonel Lawrence’s book, the Near Eastern centre of the Intelligence service is situated. It is exceedingly instructive that there is a statement added to the following effect :— “ During recent times the possibility of concluding a treaty between Great Britain and the Yemen (a State bordering with the Hejaz in the East) has been mooted. The Yemen is the only Arab State which remains isolated from Western influence. Now the British High Commissioner in Aden, Lieut.-Colonel Bernard Reilly, has re ceived instructions to conclude such a treaty.” {Received on 14th August 1932, with Political Secretary's letter No. 30, dated the 28th July 1932.)

British Policy in Arabia. 11 As seen by “ A1 Gihad ”. In a leading article entitled “ British Policv in Arabia ” “ A1 Gihad savs 11 There is no doubt that the revolt of Ibn Rafada against Lbii Sand’s Government is an event that arrests one’s attention and that makes Arab observers wonder what its, source and object can be. Any writer who wishes to deal with Ibn Rafadar’s movement must, in order to know its exact objects, go back a few years.

As regards the taking of Syria and the Lebanon from France British policy considers it wise to delay it for some time. For the torture pi the Syrians by France from time to time is bound to keep Svria m a state of weakness that makes her more ready to be swallowed when the time comes. And Britain cannot fail to find some means by which to snatch jSyria from France at any time. Therefore w lat remains for Britain to create her new India is to remove the b,- f rom the Yemen and to uproot King Ibn Saoud from the Hedjaz and Nejd. But suppose Britain is unable to uproot the two men to-day. Will she stop ? No she will continue to skirmish with King Ibn Saoud at one time and with the Imam another. If she can defeat them she will attain her object and if not she will satisfy herself with weakening them until the day comes, even after half a century, when she can get rid of them. “ The plan of the English with Fcisul A1 Dawish tw r o years ago is the same plan which they are now y taking with Ibn Rafada. When the English felt, two years ago, that King Ibn Saoud was getting stronger they created for him Feisul A1 Dawish. In order, how ever to conceal their intrigue they complaint against Al- Dawishs’ attempt at attacking their colony Iraq. In face of this complaint Ibn Saoud sent an expeditionary force to bring Al- Dawish to book and considerable Arab blood was shed. The h^nglish, in the meanwhile, sent troops and men of w T ar to Koweit to watch the situation. If Ibn Saoud had been defeated his country would have fallen prey in the hands of the English and if Al-Dawdsh was defeated the English would all the same have realised their object in weakening Ibn Saoud and plucking his feathers. But God decreed that King Ibn Saoud should defeat this heretic Al-Dawish, who, it was later established had been supplied with money, arms and ammunition by Mr. Glubbe who is known as the second Colonel Lawrence and by the Beduins as ‘ Abu Heneik ’ Mr. Glubbe is a crafty and cunning Englishman who used to occupy the post of Inspector of Deserts in the Iraq Government. When the English saw that King Ibn Saoud had defeated Al- Dawish they assisted the latter to escape and wanted to send him to another country. But King Ibn Saoud threatened that unless Al-Dawish was to be surrendered to him he would invade Koweit. As a result of this threat Al-Dawish was surrendered and put in prison until he died. King Ibn Saoud also insisted that Mr. Glubbe should be sent away from Iraq. Eventually Mr. Glubbe was ap pointed to the post of Inspector of Deserts in Amman the capital of the country of the Emir Abdullah, son of ex-King Hussein, to play the same role on the Trans jordan-Hedjaz frontiers. u It will therefore be seen that it was Mr. Glubbe or the second Colonel Lawrence who instigated the tribes encamping on the Hedjaz- Tians- jordan frontiers to revolt against King Ibn Saoud and it was he who supplied Ibn Rafada with arms and ammunition. The object LC214FDhowever, of sending British troops to the .Hedjaz-Transjordan. frontiers is not to assist Ibn Saoud but to assist the rebels and also to stand with their fair-complexioned faces and blue eyes before the troops of Ibn Saoud in case Ihn Saoud wins and wishes to [ i vima nrip’inftllv a -oart of the Hechaz.” (93) (Received on 21st August 1932, with Political Secretary s letter No. 31, dated ' the 4th August 1932.)

T have the honour to refer to my telegram No. 252, dated the 4th of Jul&gt; 1932 [Serial No. (82)1, and to make the following report on the Amir Faisal’s visit to ’Iraq. 9 jqis Highness arrived at Khanaqin on the evening of the 7th July, He was met bv Dn Nail al Assil, the ’Iraqi Charge d’Aftaires in Jedda and by re presentatives of King Faisal and the ’Iraqi Government. From Khanaqm His Highness was brought to Baghdad by a special tram m which he was accommo dated in the Royal Saloon. On arrival he was received by the Acting Prime Minister Ja’far Pasha and by a large representative gathering of officials and notables. A guard of honour was provided by the Royal Bodyguard. 3 His Maiesty King Faisal put his country house at Harthiyah at the disposal of his guest and I had the honour of being received by him there shortly after his arrival. I found His Highness lookmg very tired but doing his best to maintain an appearance of pleased interest in all that was being done to honour and entertain him. A little later, after his visit to the King, the Amir returned my call at the Residency in company with Fuad Bey Hamza. His Hiohness gave me a friendly message from his father and was good enough to sav that King Abdul Aziz al Sa’uds had often spoken to him of the pleasure which the conference on board H. M. S. Lupin in 1930 had given him. 4 5 4. On the first evening of his visit His Highness was entertained at a banquet given in his honour at the Palace ; the following evening he attended another banquet given by the Acting Prime Minister in the Municipal Gardens and on the last day of his stay I had the pleasure of receiving His Highness and his staff as my guests at a dinner party at the Residency. Early on the morning of the 11th July, the Amir left Baghdad for Kuwait in a Royal Air Force Victoria which the Air Officer Commanding had kindly placed at His Highness s disposal. 5. The Amir’s visit passed off quietly without incident and his pleasant manners created an agreeable impression on all with whom he came in contact Before his arrival, I had advised King Faisal that he should endeavour to pront from His Highness’s visit, not only to settle outstanding differences between the ’Iraqi and Nejd-Hijazi Governments concerning the location of the ’Iraqi Legation in the Hijaz, but also to do what he could to prepare the way for a better understanding between the Amir Abdulah and King Ihn Sa’ud. I sug gested that His Majesty should compromise with King Ihn Sa’ud over the Legation difficulty by agreeing that the ’Iraqi Legation should be in Jedda, provided that the Hijazi Government would allow the ’Iraqi mission to have an unofficial house at Mecca which they could use when they visited the. Capital on business. T also hinted that the ’Iraqi mission might be less suspiciously re ceived, if His Majesty were to appoint as its chief a man who was not compro mised in the eyes of the Najd-Hijazi Government by previous personal contact with Hijazi affairs. As regards relations between the Hijaz and Transjordan, I recalled the immediate relaxation of dangerous tension which had followed on His Majesty’s meeting with King Ibn Sa’ud in 1930, and said that I was con fident that similarly beneficial results could be obtained from a rapproachmen between King Ibn Sa’ud and the Amir Abdullah, if His Majesty would use his good offices to bring this about.88 Ou]j, ^ Sisal’s ^ '/tl JuIt, | ?(3 n e e Ac%fi ; of offi niarA is Kigjflili ev Ham.

Aftei the Amir s departure, the King told me that he had discussed both these matters on the lines I had suggested. He was hopeful that the com promise proposed about the location of the ’Iraqi Legation would be accepted by King Ibn Sa ud, but he anticipated that the latter might ask for the ’Iraqi representative to be^ a Minister and not a Charge d’Affaires. I think King Faisal would agree to this, provided that the Minister is allowed to have a house in Mecca and an assurance is. given that he will be treated properlv and not shadowed by spies, as Dr. Naji al Assil complains he always was when he went to Mecca. 7. As regards Transjordan-Nejd relations, the King said that tU Amir Faisal had undertaken to .try to persuade his father to telegraph to His Majesty requesting his mediation with a view to the conclusion of a good neigh bourly relations treaty between Transjordan and Nejd and the Hijaz on the lines of that which had recently been concluded between ’Iraq and Nejd and the Hijaz. The King seemed hopeful that King Ibn Sa’ud would do this and said that in that event he would go to Amman to persuade the Amir Abdullah to come into line. 8. His Majesty also revealed to me that he had learnt that the Amir was far from pleased with Fuad Hamza who had been too self assertive during their tour in Europe. He thought that the latter would not long remain in power after his return to Nejd. 9. In my own talks with the Amir I kept to general topics, but in conversa tion with Fuad Hamza I gathered that he regarded the Ibn Rifada invasion as a matter of second rate importance and that he was convinced that His Majesty’s Government were doing everything that was possible to bring it to a ignominious conclusion. 10.

M/s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, Lpndon, No. 258, DATED THE 21ST JUNE 1932. Since writing my despatch No. 234 of the 17th June, I have heard various reports, most of which rank no higher than rumours, but which are worth recording, in connexion with the Ibn Rifada affair and its repercussions or possible repercussions elsewhere in the Hejaz. The principal sources are my Indian vice-consul, who recently made a short stay at Taif, and the French Charge d’Affaires, with whom I had a most unusual amount of general conver sation on the 8th and 20th June. 2. There has undoubtedly been much malaise in Hejazi circles for some time past. It was stimulated by the King’s trenchant address to the notables at Mecca on the 22nd May, which has formed the subject of a separate report. The news of Ibn Rifada’s adventure fell on a soil of public opinion prepared for every kind of untoward eventuality. Fear of Ibn Sand, fear of war and doubts as to the stability of the regime are among the characteristic symptoms of the general uneasiness. 3 4 3. Old friends fought shy of the Indian vice-consul at Taif. The King received him, but confined himself to conventional conversation on topics like the weather and my health. The Khan Bahadur saw, however, the president of the Legislative Council and picked up various items of information, from which it would appear that the King is perturbed not only by the situation in the north, but by the state of feeling among the naturally unruly tribes round Taif. It was said that many of the leading men had been imprisoned, and that some were released after a few days, while others were detained. The King was also said to be looking suspiciously towards the Yemen, to suspect Hashimite activity m that direction, and to be contemplating measures in Asir, including the despatch thither of one of the family of the Director-General of Finance. 4. It was reported that the King had summoned the well-known military leader, Khalid-al-Lowai, from Turaba for consultation, and that a few days later fifty lorry loads of soldiers, which had been standing by outside the palace, left Taif, possibly to be placed under Khalid’s command. The vice-consul saw jjfltkrarres' We Amir pisps with i ii; horse le King's at!

S defeat on the present 5. The arrest of Faudhi-al-Kawokii seems* to i a sensation. It is undoubtedly connected with the Ibn Rifndn uW no .small diate cause, but it has its own background of rumour If t f“ the Amir Feisal had incurred the King’s displeasure before hellfi 1 lat (compare Mr. Hope Gill’s telegram No. 56 o?

Finally, there was talk in Mecca and Taif of other arrests besides that of Faudhi but of these I have no particulars. 6. Most of the preceding paragraph must he regarded as doubtful, but it is not quite such small beer as might appear at first sight. I am assured that, whatever the reason, 'Fuad Hamza and Yusuf Yasin are seriously at logger- heads, and any quarrel between these two is a quarrel between an ambitious moderniser and one who is out and out the King’s man. It is not impossible that the Amir Feisal, a man of no great character but some intelligence, swollen perhaps with the vanity of having been Viceroy of the Hejaz, might become the stalking horse of a party formed to pull the Hejaz out of the morass in which the King’s attempts at administration and economic depression have landed it* The report that all is not well between the Amir and the King deserves some support from the fact that he expected to be detained at Riyadh on his return from his tour, an expectation which he is said to have announced to his friends before he left, and which he confessed to me vaguely in conversation in London. There is, in fact, tinder enough about to take fire, if the Ibn Rifada affair pre cipitated a serious situation. 7. This brings me back to Ibn Rifada, whose position and prospects are still shrouded in mystery. My French colleague is convinced that the Govern ment here are concealing facts, and that the situation in the north is more serious than they will admit. I think he is going less on any known facts than on a plausible theory that tribesmen may well be supposed to have rallied to the invader, and that underpaid garrisons, notably that at Tebuk, have long been so discontented that they might easily go over. On my suggesting that, if the situation were really serious, the King would probably take it in hand himself and go at least as far as Medina. M. Maigret developed the theory that Ibn Sand dared not leave Taif owing 1 to the doubtful loyalty of the tribes round that place, of whose restiveness he had heard tales similar to those brought me by the Indian vice-consul. 8. I take the opportunity of mentioning one matter of actual fact. ^ ou remember that, on the 4th June, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin mentioned to me the anes of a launch from Suez at Wejh. On the 8th June I found that my I rencfi colleague had been approached about this by a certain Ansara, who had broug i the launch to Wejh. M. Maigret was at first cautious, but he told me, on tne 20th June, that he had ascertained that the vessel was under te 1Gncl , ^ although Ansara was, he said, an Egyptian, not a Syrian, as I a ^ ea . . , where.' He then took the matter np with some vigour with tl l e Acting p t for Foreign Affairs, but has not so far got any explanation of t ‘ll that it was due to contravention of unspecified regulations, i o A ’ x, i - m _ me what the launch carried, but the Hejazi Governnien evi ^ portance to her, as they have detained her and her crew since i ^e on the risk of disagreeableness with the French. Ansara himself is sard to be his way to Taif, whether as a free man or as a prisoner, I kno I learn that he has got as far as Jedda by car. Lc214FD91 * 9 .

Renton, Esq., Department of Overseas Trade, No. E.-3802|3802|91, DATED THE 20TH JULY 1932. A certain Mr. C. L. Boucher, a consulting engineer, came to see us yesterday with the text of a concession which the Imam of the Yemen has, it appears, offered to an Egyptian ex-Prime Minister, Mahommed Sakaf ; the concession grants rights of exploitation for minerals, including oil, over a strip of 100 miles along the whole coast of the Yemen. Mr. Boucher had been consulted in the matter by an associate of his, Mr. Mitchell, to whom the exploitation of the con cession has been proposed by Mahommed Sakaf. Mr. Boucher enquired what the attitude of H. M. Government would be in the matter. I explained to him that we were not at present in treaty relations with the Imam, but that correspondence was being carried on with him about the negotiation of a treaty. I told Mr. Boucher that so long at any rate as we had no treaty with the Imam we should not be able to give any official support or assistance to a British concern engaged on the concession, but that from the political point of view I, personally, saw no reason why H. &gt;M. Government should object to the proposal in principle ; if, however, Mr. Boucher or Mr. Mitchell wanted an official statement of our attitude, they must write to us. On perusing the concession it appeared that there were certain conditions attached to it which excluded foreign participation, and a stipulation to the effect that everybody connected with the matter must be Moslem. Mr. Boucher said on this point that he understood that arrangements had been made to over come these obstacles to British participation in the concession. I told Mr. Boucher that we here were concerned purely with the political aspect of the matter and that on the commercial side he should approach your Department, and suggested that he should make an appointment with Farrer. On ringing up Farrer, however, at Mr. Boucher’s request, I found that he was away and that you were out. Ottewill, to whom I spoke, suggested that I should send you this line in order that you might, if you saw no objection, ring up Mr. Boucher and let him know when he could see you. His address is : 6 Queen Anne’s Gate, Westminister, Tel. Victoria 2871. I think that you will probably like to see him and read through the conces sion, if only for purposes of information. Enclosure 1 to Serial No. (97). Fetter from J. P. Mitchell, Esq., Westminster, S. W. 1, to the Foreign Office, London, dated the 26th July 1932. I have the honour to approach you regarding an important concession which I have been able to negotiate with the Imam of Yemen, and also in con nection with certain general matters relating to this country. Rocently Mr. C.

I I conclude In saying that I am a Scotchman who has resided in Egypt for over 2a 3 7 ears, and if I may be given the opportunity of placing before you the points referred to above, I shall greatly esteem the favour.P.

E., 8, Rue Nabi Daniel Alexandria. i 2 - ^ rr T M| C'hell gaxe the following information. Mahommed Sakoff to whom the Imam of the Yemen has offered the concession, is an Arab of Persian extraction, and an ex-Prime Minister of the Yemen. He lives in Alexandria The document panting the concession is in Arabic and is, it is alleged, signed !? } ] V\ ie I m ^ lsh t f allslatl on which was shown to me, it is stated tbat Mahommed Sakoff is permitted to operate all kinds of mines throughout the length ol the Yemen coast and for a depth of 100 miles inland, during a period of oO years. Ao similar concession will be granted to anyone else during that period. Certain clauses in the document make it conditional that no one of foreign nationality is to be associated with Mahommed Sakoff in the development of the concession, and that all engineers and experts employed are to be Moslems. No payment is to be made for the grant of the concession, but twenty per cent, of the profits are to be handed over to the Imam’s treasury. 3. The concession was obtained by Mahommed Sakoff, whose financial position, I gathered, is weak, during a nine months visit to the Yemen, the expenses of the visit (stated to have been £2,000) having been paid by Mr. Mitchell. Mr. Mitchell wishes to form a British syndicate for the purpose of prospecting and reporting on the area covered by the concession. The syndicate, of which Mr. Mitchell would be a member,* would be expected to subscribe up to £10,000 capital for expenses in connection with the prospecting. Mr. Mitchell’s idea is that the syndicate should send mining engineers to the Yemen, accompanied by Mahommed Sakoff who, it was stated, would have little difficulty in obtaining a new agreement with the Imam in which the conditions regarding the employment of Moslem engineers and the non-association of foreigners, wonld be withdrawn. 4. Before seeking to interest British capital, Mr. Mitchell wanted to be assured that his efforts to exploit the concession would receive the blessing of His Majesty’s Government. He seemed to think that it was for the Depart ment of Overseas Trade to give such a blessing, so I explained to him that our interest lay in the possibility of British mining machinery and equipment being employed if the concession were developed. I vmnt on to say that you had already told Mr. Boucher that you personally saw T no reason why His Majesty’s Government should object to the proposal in principle, and that you had said that if an official statement wms required either Mr. Boucher or Mr. Mitchell should write to the Foreign Office. I understand from Helm that you have since received a letter from Mr. Mitchell. Possibly Mr. Mitchell feels that it would considerably enhance his prospects of securing capital if he were armed with a Foreign Office letter blessing the scheme. 5. Mr. Mitchell asked me if the Department of Overseas Trade could place kim in touch wdth suitable persons to form the syndicate, but I felt unable to offer him any encouragement in that direction. I suggested that a necessary preliminary seemed to be to obtain a new agreement in which the objectionable conditions v 5 * 7 ere withdrawn. Even then it seemed doubtful whether there would be any enthusiasm to invest money in a mining concession in the Yemen where the existence of oil, platinum, gold and copper had never been proved. Moreover, there was, I thought, an over-production of oil at the present time, Mr. Mitchell said that if he could not get British capital he would have no difficulty in obtaining Italian money, but he naturally wished that the prospect- TT &amp;ud development of the first mineral concession of the Yemen should be in British hands, and he thought that His Majesty’s Government would prefer it to be so.93 6 We have on record here a copy of a letter dated the 6th August 1930, •written bv the Commercial Secretary at Ramleh, to the Director of Public A Corks in’Jerusalem, in response to an enquiry about Mr. Mitchell. The Com mercial Secretary described Mr. Mitchell as a suitable person to whom mining concessions might be given, and said that as far as could be ascertained it was thouMit that he could command sufficient working capital, technical knowledge and assistance to ensure proper and adequate prospecting. Mr. Mitchell told me yesterday that he participates in a manganese concession in Palestine. Our records also’ show that Mr. Mitchell trades in machinery, cutlery and hardware, and is considered to be a suitable business connection for United Kingdom manufacturers. 7. We should be interested to have a copy of the reply which you send to Mr. Mitchell. Enclosure 3 to Serial No. (97). Letter ^rom the Foreign Office, London, to J. P. Mitchell, Esq., West minster, S. W. 1, No. E.-3884[3802|91, dated the 10th August 1932. I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th July [Enclosure 1 to Serial No. (96)] requesting an interview at this Department in order to discuss a mining concession in the Yemen, as well as certain other general matters relating to that territory. 2. The Secretary of State is informed that, since the date of your letter under reply, Mr. C. L. Boucher and yourself have discussed the position with regard to this concession at the Department of Overseas Trade. From the full account of the interview received from that Department, and from the informa tion regarding the concession furnished by Mr. Boucher during his previous interview at the Foreign Office on the 25th July, the matter does not appear to be one which can usefully be discussed further at the present stage. It appears, indeed, that the concession in question is one which has been offered by the Imam to Mohammed Sakoff, an Arab, and that British participation in its exploitation is barred by its terms. Moreover, as you are already aware, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom are not in treaty relations with the Imam of the Yemen and there is no British representative in his country, so that for the present no official support could be given to any British interests in the Yemen. 3. If, however, you should wish to bring to the notice of the Secretary of State any additional information which would modify the position as already explained to the Department of Overseas Trade, he will be glad to receive a further communication explaining any such developments in the situation.

The articles gave a pretty full account of the earlier part of the journey up to the reputed site of It bar but the series has not been continued since May 20.- 2. As this despatch has been delayed by pressure of other work and as there have been ample opportunities at home of hearing Mr. Philby’s account of his enterprise at first hand, I need not undertake the labour of reporting on the Jjmm-al-Qura articles as a whole. That of May 13, however, contains two points which are worth recording as follows :— (a) The article states that about a year before the Amir of Hassa sent an expedition against certain tribes who had raided the camels of other tribes and that it was necessary to send a second punitive expedi tion this year to complete the work of the first. This afforded an opportunity for Mr. Philby’s expedition. The punitive expedition went on ahead and returned after capturing the remaining criminals ‘ ‘ who had their arms and legs cut off ’ ’ while Mr. Philby and his party went forward. {b) The Umm-al-Qvra prints a letter of December 16, 1931, from Mr. Philby to the King, asking permission to accompany the punitive expedition subject to certain undertakings, which are of interest in connection with possible territorial claims. I enclose a translation of this letter. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to the Political Resi dents in the Persian Gulf and at Aden. Enclosure to Serial No. (99).

Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, London No. 294, dated the 9th July 1932. In my despatch No. 250 of the 17th June [Serial No. (90)] I reported on a speech by Ibn Saud, which revealed his attitude towards the townspeople of the Hejaz, and in my despatch No. 258 of the 21st June [Serial No. (96)] I dealt with various matters bearing on the uneasy internal situation in this country. This reflection in the public mind of this uneasiness has been greatly stimulated by the somewhat drastic proceedings of the police and the Govern ment during the last couple of weeks. 2. It is stated that on the night of the 25th June the Director of Police of Mecca, a powerful and arbitrary official, created no small emotion by posting armed men all over the town, with the ostensible object, it appeared afterwards, of merely raiding a house where country wine was supposed to be made, and in which four tins of wine were actually found. 3. The same report reproduces a story for which I should be sorry to vouch, and quote only as an example of the sort of gossip that goes about in an excited and fearful atmosphere. It is said that the King sent back some soldiers who had come from Khurma to Taif, and that the Amir Khalid-bin-Lowai had explained that His Majesty did not require them, that the English would bring Ibn Rifada to Taif for delivery to the King, who would strike off his head, and that the English had further promised to turn the “ dirty pig ” Abdullah out of Transjordan and send him to Iraq. 4. More importance attaches to certain police proceedings in Jedda on the night of the 28th June, when a large number of residents were arrested. Some of them were released at once, some others within a few days ; but several were sent to the interior. I need not quote the rumours on this' subject, as the Gov ernment took the unusual course of publishing a communique in the “ Umm-al- Qura ” of the 1st July. I enclose a translation of this document, minus the pious exordium which explains that this holy land is a place for prayer and work, not for propaganda. 5. It is interesting to note that the avowed object of the raid in Jedda was to discourage the circulation of rumours, a subject on which I have had conver sations with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, in circumstances described in the correspond ence arising out of the Ibn Rifada affair. One of the persons deported to the interior is a well-known Hadhrami sheikh. I believe him to be entitled to Butish protection and am keeping his case in mind, although I do not feel that 1 can prudently intervene on his behalf at the present moment. t execution in Jedda on the 1st July of a murderer, a man of the Junema tribe, has also created an impression, though, apart from the barbanty ’with which it was carried out and the fact that the man had excited, interest some weeks before by escaping from prison, this incident need not call or much comment at a normal time. The man seems to have richly deserved his fate. , T*-P . was T r ®P or ^ e ^ end of June that the playing of football had been prohibited.

Mr. van LeeuweH, who has suffered a good deal from fever of late told me that he was leaving under imperative doctor’s orders.

Although he has been kept pretty busy, I do not think he finds his position very satisfactory or is given much scope for real financial reorganization. He speaks well of the Director General of Finance but says that Sheykh Abdullah buieyman has far too much to do. He himself complains as we all do of the lack ot contact with governing circles ; and he appears to have no staff’to help mm, except a Syrian clerk who left the service of Messrs.

On the 17th August Warner sent you a copy of our official letter Ao. E.-8884j3802|91 of the 10th August, to Mr. J. P. Mitchell [Enclosure 3 to kenal No. (97)] about that gentleman’s scheme for obtaining a mining con cession in the Yemen. . 2. In spite of our request in paragraph 3 of that letter that he should write h he had any new points to raise, Mr. Mitchell, accompanied by Mr. Boucher, called here again on August 22nd. They had nothing new to say regarding the concession although they made no effort to conceal their disappointment at what they considered our unhelpful attitude and contrasted it unfavourably with the policy of the Italian Government who—they alleged—were doing their utmost to further Italian penetration in the Yemen (though, I believe, with very meagre results). 3. They then revealed the real object of their visit. Mr. Mitchell has apparently made up his mind to send Mr. Sakaf once more to the Yemen, in the hope of securing a revision of the draft concession, and he thinks that it wifi be pecessary for him to be accompanied by a qualified engineer such as Mr. Boucher. Pus suggestion was that this engineer might be useful to His Majesty’s Gov ernment as a negotiator with the Imam or alternatively that His Majesty’s Government should pay Mr. Sakaf’s expenses in return for his supplying them with any information which he may obtain during his stay in the Yemen.HiBKecmawBr; shi 97 4 Mr Mitchell was informed that neither of his suggestions could be entertained It was also made clear to him that, so far as we were concerned the posMon remained as it had been stated in our letter of August 10 h Enclosure 3 to Serial No. (97)], i.e., that m present circumstances we could afford his proposed enterprise no assistance whatsoever. He replied that lie fully realized this. He leaves for Egypt on August 24th and remains confident that he will get the draft concession modified to his satisfaction. Should he do so he gays that he intends to carry on with the scheme, if possible m co operation with British financial interests, but it not with such foreign assistance as he may be able to get. 5 Before leaving Mr. Mitchell said that if there were any fresh develop ments or if he required information on any fresh points he would write to us as suo-gested in the last paragraph of our letter of August 10th His represen tative's in this country would be Messrs. William Mmrhead and Partners. 6. I am sending copies of this letter to Cowell at the Colonial Office and to Laithwaite at the India Office.

P.Z.-5575|32. Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 298, dated the 12th July 1932. With reference to Air. Hope Gill’s despatch No. 140 of the 20th Alarcli [Enclosure to Serial No. (38)] and previous correspondence relative to the financial situation of this country, I have the honour to forward a translation ot a regulation published in the “ Lmm-al-Qura ” of the 17th June, regarding the mode of settlement of Govemment debts. The wording of the regulation is in some respects obscure, and I should not like to vouch for the complete accuracy of the translation. The principle appears to be that all debts (meaning, pre sumably, debts dating from before the current financial year, although this is not stated) will, except as provided in articles 1, 2, 5 and 6, be paid by drafts on customs, where such drafts have not already been issued in respect of them, and that such drafts will be accepted in payment of 25 per cent, of the duty on newly-imported goods. Claimants who are not themselves importing merchants are to nominate such merchants, in whose name the drafts will be issued. 1 understand that, as might be expected, the market for drafts on customs is very poor, but it is too soon to judge of the practical effect of the regulation. 2. I have reported elsewhere on a representation made to me by the Acting Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the discouraging advice alleged to have been given by His Alajesty’s Government to the business friends of a AI. Ydlibi, who is interested in enterprise in this country. I suggested, in this connexion, to Sheikh Yussuf Yasin that the Hejazi Government were themselves destroying any credit they might have. This led the sheikh to give me on the 26th June his general views about the financial situation. He spoke of the poverty of the Hejaz and the conditions in other countries, referring, inter alia, to the loss imposed on so many people by Great Britain’s abandonment of the gold standard. 3 3. I explained to Sheikh Yussuf at some length that what I complained of was not the effects of the poverty of the Hejaz, which might well necessitate special arrangements with creditors, but the financial methods employed, which #-were such that no creditor knew where he stood. I had not, I said pressed him on the subject ot claims m which His Majesty’s Government were interested because we had been absorbed m the Transjordan frontier, but I ran him thrS the list m order to illustrate my thesis. It had been announced last autumn that one-fourth of the whole revenue would be assigned to the payment of old debts and I had in January given Sheikh Fuad Hamza my vfews as to how the Government nog to be expected to deal with the floating debt problem. The arrangement of ast autumn seemed to have been lost sight of and there was now a new regulation which I did not quite understand, but which seemed to produce certain definite effects. ' . ' F 4. I told Sheikh Yussuf that article 1 of the new regulation seemed to me to bo ct gicincl 3 . 11 8.ng6inoi]t tor creditors who hod special arrangements X expected to hear at any moment that Egyptian Shell had been paid the amounts due for the benzine which the Government had acquired in -peculiar eircmrmtannps last September, and in respect of which the Director-General of Finance Imd made^and then dishonoured a special agreement. I was interested, however in other' claims, about which no special arrangements had been made. I gave,’ as one example, the small sum due to His Majesty’s Government for the Hejazi share in the expenditure on the MacDonnell investigation. Was it really intended, I asked, that 1 should take out drafts on customs and get a local importing merchant to discount them for me 1 The sheikh replied in a rather shocked tone that the regulation did not apply to the case in point. I referred also to a subject on which I had spoken to him on the 12th June, but with which I have not felt it necessary to trouble you, namely, the action (successful in some cases) of. the Directorate-General of Finance in trying to get chauffeurs employed in Government-controlled motor companies to accept one-third of the arrears due to them in full settlement. 5. If the Hejazi Government would only adopt some sensible method of (dealing with the floating debt on a moratorium basis and stick to it, I should not be so hard on them. As it is, the prospects of creditors are pretty desperate. I hope that, if the political situation grows easier, I may be able, before going on leave, to bring up to date the position in regard to the specific claims in which His Majesty’s Government are interested. If so, I will report on the particular cases as may be necessary. Enclosure to Serial No. (104). Extract from “ Umm-al-Qura ” of Safar 12, 1351 {June 17, 1932)• Decision in eespect of Debts. (Translation.) The following has been received from the Press Department :— The Ministry of Finance makes the following declaration regarding debts due bv the Government :— 1. Debts concerning which an arrangement has already been reached with the creditors will be dealt with in accordance with that agreement. 2. With regard to debts in respect of which the Directorate of Finance has given to the creditors drafts on the customs, 25 per cent, of the customs revenue will be set aside for the creditors in payment of the amount due to them. These drafts will remain valid as issued. 4 3. With regard to debts in respect of which the creditors do not hold drafts of the customs, the Directorate of Finance is prepared to give to. the creditor s m person drafts in payment, ?o that the drafts may be set off against the customs duty payable by the creditor at the rate of 25 per cent. 4. Every Government employee whose salary is in arrear may take a dra on the customs, as may any merchant who does not import goods tnrougn tie customs. Such an employee or such a merchant must make an agreemen wi i another merchant (presumably one of those who do import goods) anc oiva _ his name to the Government, whereupon a draft will be given to the specified merchant in respect of the amount due to the (original) merchant which will h set off against the customs duty payable by him (the speci ec mere f rate of 25 per cent. The said merchant (No. 2 ?) is not allowe o to another person. Lc214FD5. In the Case of soldiers, police and chauffeurs in the Government employ ment who are still in that employment, the Go\cinment will give them, in respect of their arrears of pay, supplies in kind—-a suitable quantity for each month— until all their claims are liquidated. This is in addition to the salaries which w iU be paid to them and to all other employees. 6. Debts due by the Government in respect of house rent will be settled in accordance with the special regulation in respect of delayed payments of house rent.

Despatch from His Majesty's Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 371, dated the 27th August, 1932. With reference to Mr. Hope Gill’s despatch No. 215 of May 18 [Serial No. (67)], relative to the Constitution of the Nejaz, 1 have the honour to for ward herewith a translation of an announcement published in the local press on August 22, to Die effect that the Department of Finance had been raised to the status of a Wazarat, w r ith Sheykh Abdulllah Suleyman as Wazir and his brother Hamad as Wakil. I will deal elsewdiere in due course with the political significance of this change. In the present despatch I confine myself in the main to its constitutional aspect. 2. The main text to which it is necessary to go back is the enclosure in Mr. Hope Gill’s despatch No. 118 of March 5 (File No. F. 132-N.|32), the regulation vdiich equipped this country with a Council of Ministers, forming' an organic body and having apparently a certain joint responsibility. Mr. Hope Gill rightly regarded this as a very confused measure, all the more confused because no attempt had been made to connect it properly with previous constitutional enactments and because the law was clearly conditioned by a desire to take into account and re-define the special position of a particular royal personage, the Amir Feysal. It is nevertheless possible to rationalize the system to some extent. 3. In the first place, I consider that Mr. Hope Gill was perhaps unduly impressed by the apparent anomaly of describing the members of the Council collectively as Wukala, the plural of Wakil, although not all the individuals W'ere to be Wakils. In this I see a followung of the old Turkish practice, by which the Council of Ministers at the Sublime Porte were known collectively as the Majlis-al-Wukala, long after every member of it had come to bear a different individual title, usually that of Nasir, which w r as accepted as the Turkish equivalent of “ Minister 4. The Nejazi regulations of last January contemplated a Council consisting of a President, wdio wmuld automatically become Viceroy in the King’s absence from the Hejaz and who was also to combine with the Presidency two Wazarats or what may be called full-Ministries, namely those of Foreign Affairs and the Interior. There vmre to be no other Wazarats, except perhaps for Military affairs, as to which see paragraph 7 below. 5 ; A reference to Hughes’ Dictionary of Islam will show that the original meaning of the word Wazir is obscure but in its modern usage it may safely be translated i ‘ Minister ’ ’ and it is a highly honorific title. I will use that transla tion in the remainder of this despatch in order not to overload it unduly with Arabic words. There is no such doubt as to the original meaning of the word Wakil which means a representative with delegated authority. The regulations of January contemplated three holders of the title of Wakil,'each having a seat in the Council. But at this point there is an undoubted ambiguity as to the application of the title Wakil. Those concerned with Finance and the Legislative Assembly had no Minister over them and it must be supposed that they were invested with the title as being persons deriving a delegated authority from the King. The third, however, the Wakil for Foreign Affairs was to be employed in a department with a titular Minister at the head of it. It must be supposedthat in his case the title implied not a direct delegation of authority by the Kino but a delegation by the Minister. You will remember that in May there was n fact some djJSculty m defining m English the position of the occupant of ti e post, Fuad Be} Hamza. The Hejazi Minister in London, a hostile witness so tar as the personal question u^as concerned, regarded Wakil in Fuad Bey ’s Lse as the equivalent of Under Secretary. Fuad Bey himself, a man on the mX settled down, after some wobbhng to the version “Deputy Minister’” which sounds fair and does m fact correspond to his function of working head, though not titular head of the Ministry. 5 s 6 Thus the Council might be regarded theoretically as a Council of six, the President and two Ministers, all of whose posts were united in one person that of the Amir Feysal and three Wakils, two deriving authority direct from the King and one from the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The discrimination was obviously designed to confine any title higher than that of Wakil to the one royal personage concerned. J 7. I share Mr. Hope Hill s inability to put any rational construction on the reference in the regulations of January to the department of Military Affairs as a Ministry also held by the President of the Council. The language is clear hut Fuad Bey told Mr. Hope Gill that it was wrong and that the King certainly has not delegated to the Amir Feysal even such control of military affairs as he has done, in principle, in the case of foreign and internal affairs. Article 26 and 27 of the original Constitution of 1926 remain as effectively in force as if there had been no subsequent legislation of any kind. If proof 'of this were needed, it is afforded by the conduct of the recent military operations. 8. The effect of the enclosed announcement is now to create a full Ministry of Finance, with a non-royal personage at the head of it. This would appear to be to place that non-royal personage on an equality of status with the only other full Minister, the Amir Feysal, except in so far as the latter is permanently President of the Council and becomes, in the King’s absence, Viceroy, theoretically enjoying by delegation all the royal powers in the Hejaz. 9. There are three other points to be noted. In the regulations of January it was laid down that the President of the Council was to be the channel for transmitting the King’s orders to Wakils. It is not clear whether he is to be similarly the channel of communication with his one fellow-Minister. Secondly, Slieykh Abdullah Suleyman is described as having become Minister of Finance for the Kingdom of the Hejaz and Nejd and its Dependencies, whereas it has always been understood that the Constitution is a constitution for the Hejaz only. This merely illustrates in a new way a nebulousness which has long- existed and which is, to some extent at least, intentional. Thirdly it is not stated whether the Wakil for Finance will sit as well as his brother on the Council. 10. I apologise for so long a disquisition on an apparently academic subject. The constitutional evolution of this country is incoherent but is not devoid of interest. The interplay of these titles and their holders may prove now or later to have a good deal of practical importance. Also, you will remember that one matter at which I have glanced, the relations between the Hejaz and Nejd, had to be carefully considered by your then predecessor, when studying the question of a possible application by Hejaz-Nejd for membership of the League ot Nations. These are my excuses for dealing with the present subject at length. Enclosure to Serial No. (105).

Despatch prom His Majesty's Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 374, dated the 30th August 1932. With reference to paragrpah 6 of my telegram No. 165 of the 21st August, I have the honour to state that Ibn Saud came to Jedda to-day for the inside of ti ie day—“ to take leave of the foreign representatives before proceeding to Nejd ” was the formula used. He received the representatives in a series of formal audiences in the forenoon. His graciousness, when my turn came, left nothing to be desired. I had not seen His Majesty for fourteen months and had in the interval heard very varying accounts of his physical state. On this occa sion both Mr. Wikelev, who accompanied me, and I myself were struck by his appearance of good health, though Mr. Wlkeley thought he had put on a good deal of flesh in a part of his anatomy which I was not noticing. He was quite lively in the backchat of compliment. 2. I had not intended to seek a further audience as I felt that I could neither avoid nor usefully discuss the situation between Hejaz-Nejd and Transjordan until you had considered it further. Fuad Bey Hamza, however, was keen on my doing so, and I authorised him to say that, although I had nothing to lay before the King, I should be grateful if His Majesty would receive me in case he had anything to say before we left for Nejd and England respectively. The audience was arranged for this afternoon. At the outset, I presented to the King Commander A. R. Farquhar, of H. M. S. “ Penzance,” which, by an unintended coincidence, arrived at Jedda on the same day as Ibn Saud. 3. After Commander Farquhar had retired, the King and I, with Fuad Bey interpreting, engaged in a general conversation on the present situation ; but one so very general that it would be useless to weary you with its details. The King reaffirmed all his familiar principles, his friendship for and belief in Great Britain, his desire to receive and to be guided by her advice, etc., and proclaimed his unshakable fidelity to them, subject only to the qualifications that she must safeguard his honour and his interests. I gave all the usual replies, with illustrations drawn from various sources, including the attitude observed by His Majesty's Government during the Ibn Rifada affair. 4. The fact is that both Hi’s Majesty and I were talking, and talked for an hour, platitudes with a purpose. That of the King was to prove that no gentle man, however reasonable, could feel safe with a person like the Amir Abdullah over his border ; mine to instil the idea that to the practical British mind the Ibn Rifada affair appeared a matter which had been finished with, that permanent enmity was not a practical basis for the relations between rulers and that a fresh start should be made. We might have come to closer grips with the real subject of the conversation, if I had not had to make way for the Soviet Minister, who had already been kept Avaiting a quarter of an hour. 5. As it was neither of us put a name to the Amir Abdullah, Avho so filled our thoughts, but the King mentioned King Faisal as a most commendable monarch with whom, thanks to His Majesty's Government, he Avas on the best ot terms. It is all the rage now in high Hejazi circles to represent the King of Iraq as a good Arab, un homme serieux, in contrast with his brother Abdullah, who is regarded as the incarnation of intrigue and untrustworthiness. 6 6.

S8o, DATED THE 7tH SEPTEMBER 1932. ’ 1 have the honour to transmit l.erewith a translation of a private and confidential letter from Fuad Bey Hamza which His Majesty’s Minister received the &lt;i»r before he left, regarding Hejaz-Nejd relations with Italy and Egypt 2. Sir A. Ryan took occasion of a final conversation with Fuad Bey to refer' briefly to its contents. He recalled what he had said to Sheykh Yusuf Yasin earJy ln June about the extreme unlikelihood of Egypt taking a hand in Arabian a hairs and said that he hail seen nothing since to alter his then view of which on the contrary he had confirmatory evidence. Sir Andrew suggested that Egypt had a natural interest in Hejazi affairs but not. as at present p-overned any such interest as would lead her into an Arabian adventure. 3. Fuad Bey had nothing particular to say about the err-Khedive, except that he had been amazingly active of late. 4. As regards Italy, Sir Andrew expressed the view that she was nowadays keenly interested in all foreign affairs but not interested in this country in any such way as need cause anxiety. He suggested that much of the bottom had gone out of her interest in the Yemen, her position in regard to which had at one time perturbed the Hejazi Government. 5. Fuad Hamza, for the moment, left it at that. ' Enclosure 1 to Serial No. (107). Private and Confidential letter from Fuad Bey Hamza, to Sir Andrew Ryan, His Majesty's Minister, Jedda, dated the 31st August 1932. I noticed in the “ A1 Ak.ram ” newspaper of August 17, 1932 news of which the purport of which is that the Egyptian Prime Minister, Sidky Pasha, when he visited Rome, discussed many subjects of which one of the most important was particularly that of the events in the Hejaz. Your Excellency is not unaware that news like that attracts attention and can he explained in many ways. Although I propose to request an explanation from the Italian Government, I find that the personal friendship between us, besides the friendship between our countries, obliges me to acquaint you with the matter, so that you may inform the British Government and ask for their views in such a case as this. P. I enclose for your perusal the paper which published the news and request that you will be good enough to return it after you finish with it. (Note by Mr. Hope Gill. —A1 Akram reports that the following matters affecting Italy and Egypt were discussed :— (a) Egyptian Debt, (b) Events in the Hejaz, (c) The err-Khedive, and adds that, as regards (h), Italy was closely watching developments.)

Ryan pointed out to Fuad Bey at the that Egypt would wish to intervene actively in Aiabia. F , , she lns table that she would wish to do so in conjunction with Italy, with whom e c LC214FDfrequent difficulties on her western frontier. It is none the less likely and comorehensible that the Egyptian Prime Minister should have discussed Arabian affairs with the Italian Government during his recent visit to Rome, as alleged, ^idkv Pasha has for long felt that his Government is regarded as something of an •upstart. The main object of his European tour may be said to have been to dispel tliis feeling by discussing a large variety of topics with as many govern ments as possible on equal terms. 3 The evidence in the possession of His Majesty’s Government does not r however entirely bear out the view tentatively expressed to Fuad Bey by Sir A Ryan that the interest of Italy in the Yemen has considerably diminished. There is reason to believe that the Italian Government are somewhat perturbed by the recent lack of response on the part of the Imam to the constant advances made to him through the Eritrean authorities, and that they are exerting themselves to induce him to adopt a more favourable attitude. The present visit of the King of Italy to Eritrea has, it appears, led to the appearance of many articles in the Italian press, emphasizing the interest of Italy in Arabia generally and the political importance of her colony of Eritrea. 4.

Despatch riAiAi His AIajesty s Charge d’Aefaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office London, Lo. 384, dated the 8th September 1932. ’ I have the honour to report that Hajji Abdallah All Riza, the octogenarian Governor oi l -&lt;loa, died at lail on the 24th August after an illness of about two months. 2. His death caused some emotion in Hejazi circles, for he was a well-known and popular hgure, and had enjoyed, at various times, considerable influence in the country. He had been Ivaimakam (Governor) of Jedda since the earlv davs of King Hussein’s regime, and was confirmed in the post by Ibn Saud when the latter entered Jedda at the end of 1925. ’ o. Of lei si an oiigin, he came to the Hejaz as a young man and with his brothers built up an important trade with India and the Persian Gulf. He died a wealthy, wise and witty old man, hard of hearing but very bright of eye, a personality head and shoulders above the sorry, stunted humanity of the Hejaz. His relations with successive British representatives ivere uniformly good. 4. The late Governor was the last holder of the old Turkish title of Kaimakam. The foreign representatives ivere informed on the 30th August by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that a Eoyal decree had been issued for the title of Governor of Jedda to be changed to that of Amir, thus bringing Jedda into line with all the other towns of importance in the kingdom. Hajji Abdulla’s successor is a Nejdi named Abdul Aziz-bin-Muammar, who was previously Amir of Yanbu. He is a young man of good Nejdi stock, his grandfather being, I believe, Governor of Riyadh in the days of the Rashidi rule. 5. The change in title has no great significance. The change in the person of Governor, however, may well prove to have a far-reaching effect. The appoint ment of a Nejdi to a post held for so long by one who, in spite of his Persian origin, had succeeded in identifying himself with the Hejaz and its interests has caused misgiving in Jedda. For one thing, it accentuates the Nejdi domination of the Hejaz. For another, the new r Amir, though well spoken of in certain circles, is an official pure and simple, and it is to be expected that he will be much more amenable to the influence of Mecca and Riyadh than was Hajji Abdullah, who was known frequently to have opposed the central authority in the interests of Jedda and the Hejaz generally and to have been extremely outspoken on occasions with 3 bn Sand himself. 6. The new Amir is nevertheless welcomed by the European shipping agencies in Jedda, for he has no personal interest in shipping and is unlikely therefore to use his official position to further private interests as a shipping agent, to the detriment of rival firms, as was the frequent practice of the late and sagacious Hajji Abdullah. 7.

Sir, It may be as w^ell to place on record the following events concerning the Holy Cube at Mecca which have recently been given prominence in the “ Umm-al- Qura ” newspaper.105 2. Apparently about the beginning of July an Afghan, named ’Abdul Sittar ibn Sufi AJimad Ghafar, stole a piece of the meteoritic Black Stone which is set in the Ka’ba wall, a portion of the Holy Carpet covering the Ka’ba, and two pieces of silver from the silver ladder near the holy well of Zemzem. 3. A special court was convened to try this sacrilege, consisting of the Grand Qadhi ( President), the President of the High Shari’a Court and various ’Uiama and Officials of the Haram ash-Sharif. 4. The accused confessed to having_ stolen a piece of the Black Stone, which he had knocked from the parent block with another stone ; he also pleaded guilty to the other two counts, stating that he had hoped to procure blessing for himself by being in possession of these sacred objects. But sentence of death was passed on him and he was beheaded on July 7th. 5. It remains to be recorded that Ibn Sa’ud, on August 31 and in the presence of the Grand Qadhi, the Keeper of the Keys of the Ka’aba and a large number of ’Uiama, officials and notables, piously replaced with his own hands the missing fragment of what the “ Umm-al-Qura ” calls the “ Testimony of God on f r o Earth ” I have the honour to be, etc., C.

Yesterday there passed through the Porta Nuova station here the Minister, Mohamet! Kai ant El Alidale, special Envoy of the Mecca Government to Italy. The Minister, as soon as he arrived at Turin from Genoa, went to Cavoretto for a few days rest. Mohamed Rafaat El Ahdale is a true Arab from Mecca, and a distinguished engineer, who has been sent by King Ibn Saud to Italy on a special mission with the special object of working out a new and comprehensive organisation for communications in his country corresponding to road and transit conditions there. During his visit to Turin Rafaat El Ahdale showed considerable interest also in the aerodrome. He was impressed by the high degree of perfection which we have reached in various spheres of engineering and electricity and particularly by those of our factories which can successfully compete with the greatest enter prises abroad. Mohamed Rafaat El Ahdale, who is paying his first visit to Europe, travelled in an Italian steamer, and is enthusiastic on the subject of the Italian mercantile marine. In reply to questions by representatives of the press, Mohamed Rafaat El Ahdale, stated that his country under the rule of Ibn Saud is at present enjoying a period of peaceful prosperity.

This man is a Syrian chauffeur who was formerly employed by e^-Kiug ’Ali at Jedda and has more recently been engaged by the Mecca Municipality to drive its mechanical water-sprinkler. Receiving no pay, he opened a repair-shop of his own and concentrated on worn-out Fiats. As the Hejazi Government own a number of these, they contracted with him for their repair and upkeep and eventually assisted him to visit Italy in search of spare parts. He is no more a Minister of Ibn Sabid’s than is that Turk, Jamal Pasha al Ghazzfi who was procurer-in-chief to the Amir Feysal in 1930, styled himself as “ Hejazi Minister for War ” while in Syria in 1931, and is now in India representing himself to the press as “ Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs ”. 3. Nevertheless, there is a certain move on foot, attributed to Sheykh ’Abdullah Suleyman as holder of the portfolios of Finance and Pilgrimage, to bring all motor-transport under Government ownership^ before the next pilgrim age season opens. This would certainly entail extensive repairs to existing Vehicles and might necessitate the purchase of new stock. At.present, howevei, none of the local motor-car agencies—and those of Ford, Chevrolet, and Fia are the chief—will look at any terms other than half cash with order and the balance on delivery. 4.

The only point which seems to be worthy of special mention is that Hejaz-Nejd territorial waters are defined as extending four miles from shore, excluding gulfs and bights (i.e., presumably including them entirely) but including “ the other localities outside this area where the Hejazi Government are accustomed to permit fishing ”. Unless you wish me to do so, I do not propose to enquire what these localities are. 3 I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade, the Acting Governor-General of the Sudan and the Acting Commissioner at Port Sudan.

He delivered a speech at the opening of the new session and granted the assembly the same authority as before. Organization of Finance. One of the chief matters to whidh the Government gave much of their atten- tion this year, has been the question of finance and the overcoming of the crisis. They have very carefully organized the financial affairs, relying for their expen diture on the fundamental revenue of the country. They divided the income into four divisions : one for the pay of Government employees, one for debts, one as a reserve fund and one for unforeseen expenses. All finance treasuries have been attached to the general treasury. Other arrangements, including reduc tion in all expenditure have been made. The “ Wakalat al Maliya ” has been raised to a Ministry, for which a special regulation has been made and will be published when obtained. Public Security. The incident of Ibn Rifada, who has been entirely defeated, has not been allowed to cause disturbance, etc. Care of Pilgrims. Great care has been taken by the Legislative Assembly to make arrangements ensuring the comfort of pilgrims and to draw up a general list of dues impose* on pilgrims, much reduced from those imposed in past years. It has also pre pared instructions and advice which will be published in all languages m t e form of a booklet and distributed free to pilgrims. Health.

(This proposal was recorded in my despatch No. 82 of the 1st March to Mr. Morgan) (not received). 2. Munir Bey was accordingly authorised to inform me that the Emir Feisal of the Hejaz Nejd, when he visited Angora in June last, had placed an order for one hundred rifles of Turkish make and two mitrailleuses, which were to be delivered to his father King Abdul Aziz (Ibn Saud) by two Turkish officers, who were about to proceed to the Hejaz, to inspect and repair some old cannons dating from the time when the Imperial Ottoman Government ruled over the Hejaz. In reply to an enquiry on my part, whether there was any question of the supply of ammunition, His Excellency replied in the negative.

The answer is evasive and anodyne : “ You are aware that my first task is to follow the ancestors, to ensure that everyone receives his right, to render people of all classes comfortable, to establish peace, to improve the condition of the country,.and to make the regulations necessary for its administration. As regards the position of my countries towards the neighbouring Governments, this matter concerns me as well as the Arabs, who undoubtedly will not remain far from each other for ever. I think that their inclination to hold one conference after another is the result of the firm belief, which has penetrated deeply into their blood, that they have to co-operate and work hand in hand for the restitution of the honour of Islam, and to behave as good and useful members of human society as their grandfathers did, for the leading of the people to laws, knowledge, the arts and everything to their ad vantage. This is their natural right and none can blame them for it. The Arab Conference which was held some months ago was due to the necessity of creating understanding between the Arabs, and I hope that the discussions and objects of the next Arab Conference and the wishes of its members will, be united and free from the personal and material interests which have hitherto prevented Arabs from co-operating and uniting.” 4. Asked finally what the chances of success of the next Arab Conference are and whether, if invited to join an Arab Alliance, he would accept, Ibn Sand is as discreet as he is pious. The future is in God’s hands, he replies, but if, he repeats, the decisions of that conference were to be free from taint of personal and material interests and were directed solely towards “ the advantage of the Arabs ” then no Arab would hesitate to co-operate. “ Although I am weak ”, he concludes, “ and there is neither might nor power save in God alone, yet if ever I am invited to anything which may redound to the honour, benefit, welfare, and unity of the Arabs, I will be as an individual man of the Arab nation, caring neither for rank nor position, which foster conceit, but affording every possible assistance to that end. ” ' | 5.

I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with your despatch No 81 dated 14th September 1932, on the subject of a mineral and oil con cession in the Yemen, and to state that the Political Clerk at Hodeidah has sent me the following information regarding Muhammad Saqqaf. 2. He states that Muhammad Sa ’id Saqqaf visited the Yemen about two years'ago for the purpose of recovering the cost of certain goods from one Sharif Ahmed Al-Rafa’i. During this visit he posed as a wealthy merchant. He left the Yemen three months ago and is believed to intend to return, but the Political Clerk considers it improbable that the Yemeni authorities will permit him to land. He is not an ^-Minister of the Yemen, nor has he hitherto been connected with any mining concession in the Tihama. His present address is reported to be No. 8, Daniel Street, Alexandria. According to the Political Clerk ‘ the general local opinion about Saqqaf is that he is a swindler ’. 3. While I am to unable to confirm this estimate of SaqqaHs character from senarate sources I have no reason to suppose it is untrue, as information supplied by the Political Clerk is usually reliable. You may consider it desir able to put Mr. Mitchell and his colleagues on their guard against confiding their interests to an individual of such doubtful antecedents.

Enclosure to Serial No. (127). Letter from the Commanding Officer, H. M. S. Penzance, to the Senior Officer, Red Sea Sloops, No. A.-316|4-A., dated the 24th September 1932. I beg to forward the following report. 2. On 23rd September, 1932, about 0900, when in Lat. 13° 29 r N., Long. 43° 15' E., near Yochtul in the Yemen, I boarded the dhow “ Dai Khair A Nakhuda named Yehia Kassim, bound x\den to Khoka (Lat. 13° 50' N., Long. 43° 16' E.), cleared Aden on 20th September. 3. On board the dhow 7 was a small boy, aged 6^—7 years, named Mohamado bin Faraga Alla, v T ho did not appear in the list of crew 7 and passengers. 4. On questioning him he stated that this summer he was taken by his il father ” from Djibuti to Khoka. That his “ father ” went to Massawa and died, and that he had been the slave of the Nakhuda since a month or so ago, and that he worked in the dhow 7 . (Note-: It is common practice for these dhows to carry one or even two boys who light the men’s pipes, carry water, etc., etc.) 5. The Nakhuda admitted that the boy w r as his slave and stated that whon the boy’s “ father ” left there w 7 as no one to look after him, and so he took him as his slave. He denied having paid anything for him. 6. There w r as another dhow near, closing the ship, and during further cross examination, the Nakhuda said “ ask the Sudani in the other dhow and be will confirm my story7. The Nahhnda of this dhow— “ Path al Pori * rx-i Loheyiah, named Ahmed Ali was brought on board and allowedTo eha°nce of commumeation with the first Nakhuda, Yehia Kassim. As soon as he saw the boy, the rieognition was mutual and obviously a pleasant one. Nakhuda No 2 however, told a different story, ante-dating the time of the lad’s arrival to a year v .T 0 ,! v T T S ° Said , he m i h ^ d the b °y first aIld then given him t, Nakhuda No. 1 who was his brother-in-law ; (all this seemed to me unt“ue) 11ns No. I confiimed, although it is most unlikely that an Arab woman would marry a negro such as No 2 was. To offset that is the indisputable fact that No. 1 suggested appealing to No. 2 when there was not the least possibility ef collusion. . The boy stated that he was happy and well treated. His looks and condition bore this out. 8. Instructions to Naval Officers, Slave Trade, Volume I, Articles 99—102, lay down the procedure in the case of a fugitive slave and prohibit (Article 101) removing a slave from the shore and then treating him as a fugitive. I conceive the same prohibition applies to a ship. M. 0. M. No. 18, paragraph 7, also refers to runaway slaves. 9. I was presented with a clear case (admitted) of a boy who had been recently enslaved in Arabia from Africa. The boy, however, was too young to claim the protection of the British Flag. 10. 1 therefore regretfully came to the conclusion that I had no right to take the lad away. I was supported in coming to this conclusion by the undoubted fact that Chiefs and others come into the Aden Protectorate accompanied by personal slaves, (although the fact of being accompanied by a slave is not paraded), and no steps would be taken in the matter unless the slave appealed for refuge and protection. 11. I therefore considered I was only entitled to take a slave away from his master if he appealed for refuge and protection. Por^ example, at Jidda, while a slave who has once taken refuge in the Legation is safe, the greatest care is taken not to in any way spread the impression abroad that the Legation is, so to speak, “ touting ” for runaway slaves. 12 I would point out that the above circumstances are probably by no means unusual and that, as the Regulations now stand it would appear that the usefulness of His Majesty’s Vessels in preventing sla J t f comH onlv seill impaired, since, if my reading of the Instructions is correct, I could only seize a slave if— (a) he claims British protection ; uw ^ x m,™ j, C a,,ght proceeding from Africa to Arabia, and the slave {b) ,Vse™ed btfme he has become the property of an individual m Arabia. 13. To ask a child of 64 years what he wants^to do^OTld^pear to me centrary\o' the instructions of The British Government, as I understand them. As a matter of fact I did ask him if he wished to remain in the dhow, and s answered in the affirmative. _ 14. I would submit therefore, that a these children irticular reference to the course to claiming British protection, ho are too young to know about tne possibility “^“s Opposed to the indi- id who are the bona property o purpose of enslavement.

On 16th September 1932, I stopped and examined the dhow “ El Naser ,r which cleared Aden on 10th September. On board was a boy, an enslave, a member of the crew who was not named in the crew list ; the crew total was, therefore, incorrect. The Nakhuda admitted that the boy was on board while the dhow was at Aden. 2. On 23rd September, I stopped and examined the dhow “ Dai Khair ” r which cleared Aden on 20th September. Here again was a boy, the admitted slave of the Nakhuda, Yehia Kassim, who also had been on board while the dhow was at Aden and whose name was not entered among’ the crew. 3. I would suggest that this concealment of boys by the Nakhudas presents undesirable features, and beg to bring this matter to your notice. ( 128 ) {Received on 25th December 1932, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 49, dated 3rd December 1932.) P.Z.-7391|32. Despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 428, dated the 19th October 1932. The manager of the local “ Dutch Bank ”, a branch of the Handel Maatschappij of Amsterdam, has imparted the following items of financial interest :— 2. During the months of May, June, July and August his office was busily employed in selling to about a dozen of the smaller merchants of Jedda and Mecca, against gold, drafts on Bombay, Cairo and London. They amounted, in round figures, to £150,000 sterling, and were divided about equally between those three markets. Mr. Jacobs was of the opinion that the drafts on Bombay were required to finance purchases of rice and other comestibles in time for the coming pilgrimage season, that those on London were mainly for the purchase of cotton goods, and that those on Cairo were connected with gambling on the gold exchange. He made a point of stating that these figures excluded the business preparations made by the really big local firms, such as Haii Abdullah ’Ali Kidha’s, who conduct their own banking business. Nor, he thought, did they include savings of the more fortunate Government servants placed abroad for greater safety. 3. If Mr. Jacobs’s figures are approximately correct, as I take them to be, they show that there was evidently still plenty of money in private hands ; at the same time they betray an implicit faith in the size of the next pilgrimage, which seems only too likely to have been misplaced. A couple of months ago the bazaar gossip placed the coming Javanese pilgrimage with confidence at 40,000. Last season it was 4,500. Next season, according to the shipping company, which has reason to know best, it will be 1,500. Stocks are now heavy, and unless other countries send unsuspected quantities of pilgrims, it will be very difficult to get rid of the accumulation. 4 4. Mr. Jacobs was very despondent about Saudi Government finance. During next month, he said, Government commitments mature to the tune of £40,000 gold. He will have to handle these debts, but sees no hope of obtaining payment. On the contrary, he foresees trouble and complications arising from the fact that the gneater portion of them has been discounted and re-discounted in Europe. This, I understand, to be the case with £15,000 owing to th^ Standard Oil Company through Messrs. Sharqieh (Limited), and £10,000 to German firms represented by M. de Haas, the German consul ; these are Mr. Jacobs’s figures. The other £15,000 are owing to the Marconi Company, also through Messrs^ Sharqieh. Apart from these, Mr. Jacobs is aware of £5,000 gold owing to his own firm, £15,000 to the Shell Company, through Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., £25,000 to the Qusaibis, and £30,000 to the Soviets for od—a total external indebtedness, according to Mr. Jacobs, of £115,000 gold. To this figure we can add £10,000 owing to the Government of Lidia, £2,500 to the Eastern Telegraph Company, and £1,700 to His Maiesty’s Government—a minimum grand total of some £125,000 gold.

He is spoken of as an acquisition by Hejazis who know him but I do not know if he is anti-British. He has so far avoided the ’Iraqi Legation. 3.

I have just returned from a visit to Terim in the Hadramaut where I had an opportunity of discussing with Sheikh A1 Kaf the general question of the purchase of the aircraft, and gave him details of the radius of action, load, etc., of the De Havilland Fox Moth. I am inclined to think, however, that the Sheikh has momentarily, at least, rather abandoned the idea of acquiring an aeroplane. When making his suggestion in the first instance he had not appreciated the maintenance problem. Although there are some 70 motor cars in the Hadhramaut, these care are not maintained, and are allowed to run on until a breakdown occurs. Sheikh A1 Kaf now appreciates that the same method cannot be adopted with an aeroplane, and consequently his enthusiasm is waning. He has not, however, entirely abandoned the idea, and is, in fact, proceeding with the construction of a landing ground just outside the walls of his town. 3 3. Squadron Leader Rickards will be returning to the Hadhramaut in about six weeks’ time, and will then broach the subject again, and try to discover what Sheikh Ai Kaf has finally decided upon.(133) (Received on 11th January 1933, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 52, dated 29th December 1932.) ?.Z.-7752i32.

The unfortunates were two Hindus. Some days later it was ascertained that two men who had disappeared and were suspected had left Aden by dhow on the night of the murder. Messages were dropped from aircraft along the coast asking that these men who were described should be arrested and detained. On 29th October information was received that the suspects had been arrested at Mrqa (160 miles B.-N.-E. of Aden) by the Sheikh of Trqa with whom His Majesty’s Government is in treaty relations. Political complications were threatened. It was reported from Trqa that the Lower ’Aulaqi Sultan whose territory bounds that of the Sheikh of Trqa on the S.-W. had demanded that the men should be handed over to him under threat of attack. The Resident was most anxious to avoid any tribal trouble which might disturb the' peace of the Protectorate and possibly result in a long-standing tribal feud It was therefore important that the political difficulty should be solved at once before it had time to develop. In view of these considerations I willinglv acceded to his request for the services of H. M. Ship Hastings and, having embarked a Political Officer, the Commandant of Police and an escort of armed police, sailed to arrive off Trqa at 0(00 on olst October. The Political Officer was landed on arrival and negotiations were opened after a letter had been given to the Sheikh warning tne of the consequences if lie should attack Irqa on gionnc s present incident. The Sheikh refused to negotiate before receiving this letter, After a long discussion lasting some hours and payment of a rewardjwhich by the wav the Sheikh would not accept m the presence of his tohowei s rema mg later that if he had done so it would only have amounted to about 8 a ^ head), the party were embarked in the motor boat and preseAt of 3 goats and. 4 hens -hich were thrown minute, much to the embarrassment of the Political umcei to his reception on arrival on board. .

Sunni of Baghdad ; age about 38. Belongs to the ’Alusf family of Baghdad which is noted for the learned men which it has produced. He is a graduate of the Sorbonne University, returned to Baghdad from Paris in 1926, and was appointed a Professor in the Baghdad Law School. In 1928 he was transferred to the post of Director in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but resigned two years later as the result of a quarrel with the Minister Abdullah Damluji. Accompanied Nuri Pasha on his visit to Mecca in 1931 ; later on is said to have had a violent quarrel with him. This led to his quitting ’Iraq in the Autumn of 1932 and taking service under Ibn Sa’ud as Legal Adviser in the Sa’udi ministry of Foreign Affairs. In Baghdad it is now' rumoured that he has quickly tired of his new Master, whose methods are naturally repugnant to one educated in the principles of European law.

With reference to the semi-official note from the Eastern Department to my ^ mncery No. 1338|164|25 of November 25, I have the honour to state that Mr. HopeAhll was unable to extract any information from the so-called ssislant Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs here regarding the date ot exchange of ratifications and entry into form of the Treaty of December 1931, w ween bn Sa ud and the Imam Yahya-, I therefore wrote personally to Fuad ey amza on January 1 explaining that the information was needed for purely documentary purposes. When I reminded Fuad Bey of mv fetter in conversa tion on January 9, he replied that the ratification had been effected by an ^xc mnge o e egrams, the dates of which were not in his possession, but he was obtaining them from Riyadh. 2. I took the opportunity of asking Fuad Bey about the mission which the rH A'a a is UnderSt0 i 011 to hav , e ■ sont to ^ an ’ a making it clear that my inquiry was y a e Tr. y a purely general interest in the relations between two monarehs T ^ n 1 1 ajG l ty S ^? vernmen ^ liked to see on good terms with each other, !&lt; said that ^ny information was a little confused. It had been announced in the U mm-ai-qmra that the King was sending a representative to San’a. (This announcement was made m the issue of November 4, under the heading “ New endeavours of His Majesty the King for the union of Arabs. Negotiations with Yemen ) Subsequently an impression had grown up that this referred to the despatch of Sheykh Hamad Suleyman and Khalid Bey al Qarqani, and that they had been held up by the revolt in ’Asfr. ^ j 3 3. Fuad Bey said there had been no question of sending Sheykh Hamad and is compamon to San a. Their destination had alwavs been ’Asfr, where it was ^ nteaded that should investigate the situation and where they remained after the outbreak of the revolt. They were now with the punitiveforces The King had sent quite independently another officer direct from Riyadh to San’a m the person of Muhammad Ibn Dhawi a “ clerk ” in h s diwan. The object was to discuss in a friendly spirit various outstanding matters, among which Fuad Bey specifically mentioned frontier delimitation. 4. Fuad Bey said that Muhammad ibn Dhawi was still in SaiFa. He pro mised spontaneously to inquire about the course of the negotiations and to let me know the result of his inquiries. When thanking him, I repeated that my interest in the matter was general and that while I should be glad to have anv further information, I did not wish to be importunate. All that really concerned us was to know that the rulers concerned were in good relations, as we were all for peace in Arabia. Fuad Bey made the remarks which are now usual about the excellent attitude of the Imam in regard to the ’Asfr revolt, of which he disapproved. I said that all my own information supported the belief that the Imam had no desire to embroil himself. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Chief Commis sioner at Aden.

The Vice-Consul was confident that it was still going on but on a very small scale. He believes seldom more than 3 slaves at a time are shipped and often only one. Small Sambouks are used and adults are not as a rule dealt in. The Chef de Cabinet in the course of conversation only reiterated what French officials have been saying for years, i.e., that slave traffic through French Somaliland is non-existent ; that the coast is too well patrolled. I ascertained that the coast from the head of the Gulf of Tajura to Raheta a distance of 115 miles was in charge of a District Commissioner with a small party of native camelry stationed at Obak so it is doubtful if the patrol is in any way effective. The District Commissioner is the only European official employed in this region. There seems little prospect of combating the trade until the French take an active interest. Mr. Lowe assured me that there would be no difficulty in the French authorities obtaining information if they really wanted to. ######## 6.

Kamaran. The Administrator, Captain Wickham, visited the ship shortly afterwards. He had no fresh information regarding affairs in Asir except a rumour that the attack by the Idrissians on Gizan had failed for the present. 9. On 18th November, Captain Wickham received a personal letter from Seyyid Abid al Idrissi (nephew of the Idrissi) announcing a revolt due to Sa’udi oppression, and the restoration of the Idrissi’s authority in Asir. Abid en quired as to the attitude of the British Government and under what conditions they would contemplate an agreement. The purport of this letter was passed to the Chief Commissioner, Aden. About the same time unconfirmed reports announced the capture of Sabia and Gizan by the Idrissians. On 20th November information was received that Ibn Sa’ud had re-captured Gizan, having sent troops by sea and attacked under cover of darkness. 10. Hodeida .—The weather having moderated I sailed early on 21st Novem ber for HODEIDA and arrived at 1115 * The Political Clerk, Mohamed Saleh Jaffar came on board on arrival and a salute was fired on ascertaining that the local authorities were prepared to return it. ' ‘i I ascefe a toll' parly of t nywayffi i at dto, # i » itioBo;aE ; , l, 1 - Saleh Jaffer informed me that the Governor Saif-al-Islam al Hussein fourth son of the Iman was sick and that the Assistant Governor, Kazi Ah B?n Hussein Al-Amn would receive my call. I landed at 1600 and was met by a guard and band about 1_0 strong and several of the principal Officials of the , - district were presented to me before proceeding to the Government Offices My reception was most friendly and it was obvious that a visit from one of H. M. Ships was considered an honour. The Governor sent a message saying how sorry he was not to be able to meet me. He invited me to send a telegram to the Iman which I did expressing pleasure at the opportunity of visitin'- HODEIDA and appreciation of my reception. The Iman replied thankine; me for my message and welcoming our arrival. . Later in the day a dhow came oil bringing gifts from the Governor con sisting of 2 oxen, 3 sheep, chickens, eggs, coff ee, and bananas. In return I sent some cases of tinned fruits, jams and syrup, which it is believed are appreciated. 12. The following morning the Acting Governor accompanied by Saleh Jaffer and three members of Al Hussein’s Staff returned my call. He was shown over the ship in which he displayed great interest and expressed a hope that we would pay more frequent visits to HODEIDA. As he was unquestion ably acting in the place of the Governor who was sick, I gave him a salute of 15 guns on leaving, this being the number accorded by British and Italian warships on previous visits. From information obtained from the Political Clerk, it appears that the Iman, while secretly encouraging the revolt in ASIR, is not giving any open support. Proceeded at 1130 and returned to K AM ARAN. 13. Kamaran .—On 21st November about 95 refugees including 50 male adults, arrived, mostly from GIZAN ; amongst these were Seyyid Abid, accompanied by his cousin Seyyid Hussein and a party of 30. Abid had hoped to receive an answer to his letter with request for an agreement and handed a further letter to the Administrator with definite suggestions including pro posals for a grant by the Idrissi of Oil and Salt concessions in FARISAN and GIZAN respectively in return for help. The text of this letter was passed to ADEN. 14. Abid accompanied by Hussein called on me on 23rd November. He was in formed beforehand that I could in no way discuss the rights and wrongs of the political situation ; an arrangement to which he endeavoured to comply but was unable to resist, expressing bitter feelings against Ibn Sa’ud stating also that all the Idrissians needed were arms and ammunition and that they were more afraid of the Iman than Ibn Sa’ud. In the course of conversation he mentioned having visited H. M. S. “ ODIN ” some years ago at GIZAN and asked why no British Warships came there now. AMd is a pleasant, plausible fellow with a keen sense of humour and his troubles do not a] 3 pear to weigh heavily upon him. Hussein had little to say. 15. On 24th November Abid was informed by the Administrator that he must leave the island and he sailed for MASSAWA on the 25th. Later it was reported that, on encountering some Idrissian dhows and hearing tmit ne Idrissi was about to start a new offensive, he transhipped, sent ^ to MASSAWA, and landed at MADAYA (about half way between GIZAN and MEDI). Confirmation of this, has been received and it is smce^reported that SABIA and the Wells at GIZAN have been reco\ ered by the Idrissians. Ihe Sa’udi troops in GIZAN are obtaining water from FARibAiN. A wounded Saudi soldier who arrived with two others from GIZAN on 23rd November is being treated in the hospital. Proceeded on patrol west of the reef area at 1600 on 30th November.

On 2nd December at 0900, I closed JEBEL TIER with the intention of sending some books and papers but the swell did not permit landing. Proceeded to KAMARAN by the North passage and arrived at 1800. 3. Kamaran .—There was no information to show any change in the situa tion in ASIR. All refugees had been ordered to leave the island and were clear by 7th December. Accordingly I proceeded with the programme originally projected having ascertained that the Chief Commissioner Aden concurred that the presence of the ship at KAMARAN was no longer necessary. PARIS AN ISLANDS were deliberately avoided in order that there should be no impression of British countenance or support of the revolt. I had consulted with the Chief Commisioner whep at ADEN with regard to the policy it was desirable to adopt. 7. Massawa. — ....It was ascertained that 60 refugees from GIZAN FARISAN and KAMARAN arrived at MASSAWA on 6th December. 13. Mukalla. —MUKALLA was reached on the morning of 18th December, a few dhows being boarded on passage. Calls we're exchanged with the Wazir, Seyyid Bubakar Husein, representing the Sultan who was absent in India. We had a friendly reception and were entertained to luncheon in the Sultan’s Palace. Motor cars were placed at our disposal for a duck shooting expedition. 14. Bir Ali .—Sailed at 1835 on 19th December and arived on the. follow ing morning at BIR ALI. There was a strong easterly wind blowing and landing was difficult. Visits were exchanged with the Representative of the Sultan who was in ADEN. The Representative complained that his neighbours .froni j HAP (20 miles west of BIR ALI) had arested &gt; two dhows and imprisoned six of his villagers and asked if I could do anything to procure ie V n1P was a coincidence that when at ADEN the Chief Commissioner la ° to visit BAL HAP as well as BIR ALI m order to avoid jealously as a go deal of friction existed between the two tribes.15 Bal IIaf I reported the complaint to the Chief Commissioner and pro ceeded' to BAL HAF. The Sultan was friendly but somewhat deaf and loqua cious 1 believe he felt that the ship had been sent specially to BAL HAF on account of the existing circumstances. The result of my proceedings are reported in Enclosure No. 2 herewith. At both places we were well received. Gifts of honey fruit and a goat were presented during our visits to MUKALA, BIR ALI and BAL HAF, and suitable presents sent in return. M. j * * * * * # Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (10). Copy.

I beg to report that I interviewed the Sultan of Bal Haf this morning and informed him of your message 1956 of 20th December, having ascertained previously that the report from BIR ALI was correct. 2. On request I gave him written instructions to release the dhows and their crews. He then stated that the crews had already been released shortly before the arrival of H. M. S. ‘‘ HASTINGS ” (1600—20th December), but that the dhows were still at BAL HAF. After some discussion he promised to send a message to BIR Ali i forthwith requesting that men should be sent to take them away. 3. It apears that the dhows were detained as a reprisal for the theft of four canoes from the fishing village of JILLAA. The canoes w r ere not actually stolen by the Bir Ali but by a Bedouin tribe (Ahl-el-Adin from AL-HAMIA). Bal Haf stated that this Bedouin tribe were close friends of the Bir Ah and that the latter had incited and paid the former to commit the crime. 4. He also stated that he is always ready to obey the instructions of the British Government but that his tribe are very indignant at the loss of the canoes and he fears there may be trouble if the canoes are not returned or compensation paid.

Some weeks ago Fuad Bey Hamza informed me that he had arranged to visit jedda regularly every Saturday after Ramadhan, ie., roughly from the ^ beginning of Febmary. He has in fact been available in Jedda on the forenoon of most Saturdays since that date. The Ministry has now informed the foreign missions by a circular that the branch of the Ministry in Jedda will be open every Saturday for the i eception of foreign representatives. The circular adds that the Under Secretary (or Deputy Minister, as Fuad Bey prefers to call himself) will be prepared in exceptional circumstances to visit Jedda at other times at the request of the representatives. o. I take this opportunity of stating that the effective arrangements of the Sa'udi Government for dealing with foreign affairs remain otherwise unchanged. The Amir Feysal continues to be titular Minister and to play no apparent active role. Fuad Bey Hamza continues to be the only person with whom business can usefully be discussed. If the new arrangement is adhered to, it should alleviate the difficulties of which I have complained in the past.

No machines belonging either to this Command or to Iraq, were in the vicinity of Nejd territory on the 23rd of February. It is therefore thought that the complaints of the 22nd and 23rd February, have reference to some other machine, possibly, one belonging to No. 55, Squadron which left Amman for Rutbah but returned to Amman owing to thick fog in vicinity of Azarak. On March 3rd no service aircraft belonging to this Command flew o\ T er Nejd territory. On that date, two machines of Iraq Command left Baghdad for Amman : cause unknown.

(2) Sailed at 2030 on 7th for Mukalla, passing 4th Destroyer Flotilla out side harbour, having embarked one R. A. F. officer who was to make final arrange ments for the visit of Colonel Reilly (Resident of Aden) and the Group Captain in three Vickers Victorias to Mukalla. Lalso embarked a cook specially engage by the Sultan of Mukalla for the Resident’s visit, as. he had'been unable to transport to that place. (Steamers run roughly about once a month from A to Mukalla.) (3) Arrived at Ahwar on 11th and landed some stores for the emergency landing ground there, and a letter for the Sheikh, and then proceeded to R^ 18 '^ Kalb. That evening a dhow was encountered who was out of water andI deficiency made good. She was bound for MaoW i , to get there in a couple of months The NnVh rfi V inshaliaii day! jon^oy Mafid been n ° f ° r tw0 ^ and that « extended eight t ted (5) Left 10th iand arrived at Mukalla about 1100. I called on the Wazir- as the Sultan was away m India, he haying estates in Haiderhad, and beiny as’ much Indian as Arab, due to the many inter-marriages in the past S (6) MukaMis a great port ibr this part of the Hadranmaut and the valleys distant about 150 miles and well inland are most fertile, though belonging to a different Sultan From these valleys a motor road is in process of construction to the coast, but at present there is a grap of some fifty miles or so. In conse- quence cars are taken to pieces and carried up on camels to the road head assem bled, and used in the interior. There is also electric light equipment i’n some of the inland towns, with the result that having traversed the desert bv age old means of transport, i.e., camels, one suddenly arrives in a district equipped with electricity and motbr roads. It is not, howevfer, intended to convey the impression that here is the location of the Arabian Picadilly circus. (7) On 11th the Resident arrived in airplanes and was saluted on arrival by shore battery. As Colonel Reilly had always hitherto waived ceremony at Aden, I had not yet saluted him, and T therefore informed him that I should do so on his arrival at Mukalla. It is corsidered that much better value was obtain ed by firing 13 guns at a place like this, where salutes count with the natives, than at Aden, where all the natives are blase, and the Europeans merely complain that one has either broken their windows or their afternoon siesta (or both). (8) That afternoon I attended an excellent physical drill exhibition, and Sports, given by the sons of the Sultan’s slaves. Of these latter the Sultan has a large number, so much so that their upkeep constitutes a heavy drain on his purse. Sometime ago he approached the British authorities for advice as to the best direction to economise and they recommended freeing the slaves. The Sultan was aghast, and pointed out that if free, no'-one would be responsible for their food and lodging. That there was no work for them, and they would starve, and then, rendered desperate by hunger, cause riots, etc. (9) The Wazir, accompanied by innumerable relations, returned my call, and was taken round the ship. Accompanied by two officers I dined at the Palace, with the Wazir that night.' In the evening a slave came on board. This is fully reported in en closure No. 1. (10) On the 13th as soon as the planes left, the ship sailed for Aden, taking back the cook and an emplo5me of the Aden Port Trust, arriving next day. . ..

Tribe. —Amhara. Born.—Minjar (near Addis Abboba one day’s journey). Age.—About 25 y&lt;§Rfs'.(2) One of the Somalis from H. M. S. “ Penzance ” was m a coffee shop at Mukalla when Dnbala came up and told his story, and said he had heard that the British would help slaves. The Somali confirmed this and told him to come on hoard and ask to see the Captain or First Lieutenant-Commnder. He arrived on board about 1900 on 12th March. He presented a well fed appear- &lt; a nce which is a great tribute to the charity of the people of Mukalla (14° 31 ft. N. 49° 07 ft. E.) since on his own showing, he had subsisted by begging all his time there, some four months) in all. (3) He was taken about fifteen years ago by an Abyssinian to Meirz and thence to Tadjurah, where he was handed to Dankalis who took him, with about fifty others bv dhow to the coast of the Hejaz and thence to Medina. He heard the Dankahs say they would not go to Jedda because there were English there. (4) From Medina he was sold to Bedouins who took him two months by camel to Dabai (Trucial Coast) and after changing hands several times he was eventually bought by one Mohmed bin Faras, a merchant of Hebai, with whom he remained 13 years, working as a pearl diver when of sufficient age. ( 5 ) About two years ago as he was always being beaten for any mistake, he ran away to Hen]am in a small boat. Four slaves were sent to retake him, but the Persian Governor interfered. While this was being discussed Officers from the “ Cyclamen ” got to hear about it, and on learning that he was a run away slave gave orders that he was to be allowed to remain and work at Henjam until passage could be arranged. (6) He worked as a coolie for about three months and coaled “Lupin”, “ Cyclamen ” and “ Triad ”, finally being given passage in an Eastern Tele- oraph Company’s Ship to Muscat by order of the Commanding Officer of H. M. S. “ Cyclamen ”. On arrival at Muscat he was given a manumission certificate by the Consul. (7) He remained at Muscat working for three months. He then arranged to come to Mukalla by dhow, the Nakhuda (Captain) asking ten rupees, but as the slave onlv had four he finally accepted that sum. This was directly after the last Ramadhan but one {i.e., February 1931). Mukalla was the home port of tins vessel. (8) Before arriving at Dhofar (17° 01 ft. N. 54° 05 ft. E.) they met two fishing dhows jft sea, and the Captain offered to sell him to them. This offer was refused because the Captain could not show a certificate that he was his own property. The Captain again tried to sell him at Dhofar but the would be purchasers again refused owing to the lack of papers showing that Dubala was his own property. He still had his manumission certificate. (9) He was warned not to run away at Dhofar as there were Bedoums there. He was then told they were going to Mukalla but instead they armed at a place called Jebel ' Kyoot (not identified!. While there lie over heard the crew discussing him, and saying that if they took him to Huka a he might complain to the Sultan and get them into trouble, and that the beri flung to be done was to kill him. After hearing this he jumped overboard at night wmie the crew were asleep, as the lesser of two evils:, and after swimming and wa ung for about seven days he was found by some Bedouins and Somalis. The p ace was not identified. (10) He had been without food all this time and the only liquid obtainable was by licking the undersides of stones. The seven days is naturally on F &amp; estimate as he was almost dead on arrival being speechless, and for three a. they put ghee to his lips as he could not swallow. His napers were lost m trip. He remained at this dace about four months working as a water can ' but when he said he wished to leave this was refused him, so he ran away, hiding bv dav and walking bv night in three days arrived at Dhofar, where reported to the Sheikh and told his story. (11) He remained at Dhofar about five months and then the Sheikh arrang ed a passage for him to Mukalla. This was about four months ago. _ ^ (12) Soon after he arrived at Mukalla he saw the dhow which took him Muscat, and he went to the Harbour master and to All Hakim, the doctor o ^ port and laid a complaint against the Contain for his conduct. °, f or0 that thev could not heln him and that he must complain to the cour • Abdul Rathman bin Othmau ( the Wazir). The Nakhuda was nroduceci u ^ and stated that Dubala had been a passien^r, and left unknown to him a Kyoot. No further action was taken by the court.(13) Tlie dhow made two trips to Somaliland and an j i , il Penzance’s ” arrival left for Aden r rhp NnH, i ? ^ fij-ten days before Obaid Barkoot given by Dubala as Amber Root ^ 'p 8 llc I^f e wa 1 s ^ 0 ’ 1)ara k Dubala stated he would recognise him again. Most of the abovetfSatiot was elicited that rngnt, but it was not until the next day that the infomat on in paragraph 13 was made clear, and its importance pointed out by th?First Lieutenant Commander who examined him. y (15) A signal was therefore made to the Port Officer Adpn nobdnn- whether a dhow whose Nakhuda’s name was Amberkoot was ’in port.’ Chrinf to the name being incorrect a reply in the negative was received (16) On Penzance’s arrival in Aden the next day a copy of the evidence was sent to the Political Secretary, with a suggestion for further search, and that night the police arrested Barkoot, his son and his nephews. The dhow was loaded and ready to sail, m a few hours would have been well out of rteach The above three men were the only ones left of the crew which Dubala accused', the others having left. (17) Apart from the fact that it was one man’s word against three (Barkoot and company) naturally denied Dubala’s accusations) legal difficul ties arose as to whether the Indian Penal Code embraced this offence alleged to have been committed outside British Territories, and the accused had therefore to be released as no charge could be substantiated. (18) Even if nothing could be proved, yet the knowledge of arrest, etc., will spread up and down the coast and I feel that respect for the length of the British arm will be enhanced. (19) Dubala will be repatriated to Abyssinia and on being asked whether there was any chance of his being caught again as a slave, he replied with the Arabic equivalent of “ Once bitten twice shy ”. (20) There is little doubt as to the truth of the slave’s story as the tale he told to the police and the Political Secretary never varied from his original tale told on board Penzance.

The Camel Corps and the Policemen were standing along the sides of the street in order to give His Majesty a military salute.

In this square the Municipality had prepared magnificent awnings one of which was reserved for His Majesty and for the reception of the people who came to congratulate him, while the others were for the deputations of Moslems, officials, and pilgrims who came to salute His Majesty.

With reference to the despatch addressed to you by His Majesty’s Minister at Kabul, No. 38, of March 9 [Serial No. (27)], I have the honour to state that the Afghan Government are understood to have purchased for £6,000 a house in Mecca belonging to the Governor of Jedda to be used as a hostel for Afghan pilgrims. The deal was carried through during the visit of the recent Afghan mission, apparently under the auspices of the Afghan Minister in Cairo. There is said to have been, a difference of opinion in the mission as to the suitability of this means of providing for the needs of Afghan pilgrims. According to a rumour, which I should be very sorry to vouch for in any way, the Minister in Cairo received a substantial sum of money for his ser vices as broker. 2.

Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated the 24th June 1932. Letter from His Majesty's Charge de'Affaires, Jedda, No. 1, dated the 8th April 1932. Mr. Hope Gill to Mr. Warner .— {Received April 26.) PHILBY reached Mecca from the Rub-al-Khali on the 5th April, and came to Jedda on the 6th. I saw him then, and again yesterday, when he described his trip with the aid of “ Southern Arabia ” (Thomas), published last Septem ber by the Royal Geographical Society. If the details interest, pull out the map and I will recount them as briefly as I can. Philby left Hufuf on the 6th January, with thirty-two of the finest Omaniya camels in Arabia provided by Ibn Saud, eighteen barbarian Bedonin, all sectional sheikhs of the Ajman and Murra tribes, chosen by Ibn Jiluwi of Hasa and engaged by him for the adventure at 30 riyals (£2) a head, with the promise of a gratuity at the end. They took with them only dates and rice, also tents, Philby carried a sporting gun, sextant, compass, chronometers, &amp;e., as well as tour different kinds of Kodaks and a Zeiss Ikon ” cinema camera, with which he took several hundred photographs and reeled 200 feet of film. He and three of his companions kept Ramadhan (the 9th January—7th February) religious- ly, and felt all the better for it. Two salukis accompanied them throughout and caught hares for them during the first part of the trip. They first made south-east across the Jafura, which, like the Dahana to its vcs , is a pi oiongation northward of the Rub’-al-Khali. Arrived at Salwa, which les at the southern end of the bay separating Qatar from Hasa, they turned south-westward to the Jabrin oasis (about 23° 15' N. 49° 15' E.). Plulby found that Cheeseman’s plotting of Jahrin is about 25 miles ' too tar to the w r est, as are the other mapped points of that area. 170 l Vent soutl1 a . magnificent well called Maqainama, dug 22° 10' ^49° 'io' E 6 and C01ltainin £ Purest water ; it lies at about they eame t0 Bir FacUiil (about 22“ 15'N.

Philby is sure that this is Dbar, although Thomas though that it might he at about 18’ 50' N. by 52° 25'E. Philby’s companions are convinced that tie crater-walls are the rums of the famous palaces, but Philby knows them to be either the lips of extinct volcanoes or else the edo-es of the pants oi impact of meteorites, he is not sure which. They are vitreous and clearly the product of great heat The desert for miles around is dotted with sma 1, quite roiind, lava-like pebbles, which Philby’s Bedouin declared to be the black pearls of those ancient beauties and collected greedily. Philbv has brought many such specimens from the site, including the niece of meteorite Thomas by the way is said to have found a similar smaller piece a hundred or more miles to the S.S.E. of Farajja. After “ Ubar ” Philby went southward along a string of wells to Naif a about 19° 50' N. 51° 25' E.), a well lying some 20 miles due west of Thomas’s Bainha, and containing water with all the properties of Epsom salts. This well lies in a horseshoe of high-piled sand, and here Philby, dancing on the crest in the right kind of wind, made the sands sing. Then tobogganing down with the falling sand, he drew deep trombone-notes with his hands from the moving sur face. Pie was intensely pleased, collected samples of the sand, and speaks of vacunm as a possible cause of the sound. Here, too, he tracked down the Bedouin myth of the walking stones, stones which lies quiet when a man approaches, but which leave a tell-tale trail behind them. These Philby found only on sufficient ly sloping ground. Around Naifa lay another marked grouping of shallow wells, more deposits of fresh-water shells, and frequent traces of flint weapons. This area Philby tentatively connects with the distant Wadi Dawasir in the west, but unfortunately his final westward tracks lay well to the north of the supposed ancient line of this river, which he was consequently unable to check en route. From Naifa, where he had to abandon one camel, Philby went south again to Thomas’s Shanna about 19° N. 51 ° 30' E.), and here he prepared for his main objective, the crossing of Rub’-al-Khali along the longest completely waterless line. This, he reckoned, lay over the 350 odd mies from Shanna to Sulaiyil in the west (about 20° 25' N. 45 ° SO 7 E.). On about the 21st February they set out. Each morning the baggage camels went ahead at 2 a.m. ; the rest followed at 4. On the fifth day out, and just short of the south of Shuwaikila, about a third of the way across (say, 19° * 25' N. 49° 25' E.), Philby found the baggage train halted at midday, the camels sheltered from the sun in tents, the men frightened and refusing to 'move further. The camels had broken down with sunstroke, and all that could be done was to make back at once to water. They just succeeded in five more days in reaching Naifa again, helped by two camelions miscarriages, which they ate, and running out of water twelve hours before reaching the well on the 1st' March. There they rested, feasting on the two weakest camels, which they killed, and reorganised. Philby thereupon decided to make the second attempt light, and sent back to Riyadh the fourteen weakest camels, all the tents and rice, and the eight worst men. There was apparently some competition among them to proceed instead of returning, which Philby attributes to the gratuity at the other end. He was by then completely disgusted with the company of his companions, whom he fates as quite the most animal men can be ; he nevertheless valued their stamina and desert-craft very highly. Philby set out on the second attempt on about the 5th March, with fifteen camels, ten men, sundried camel-flesh, two skins of dates, and. six s uns o Epsom-salty water, with another 10 gallons in petrol tins as an iron-ration. e also took his instruments and cameras, of course, but sent back his recor s o n trip to date, in case he failed to reach Sulaiyil. For ten days they moved stent i y across the emptiest part of the Empty Quarter,, guided by directional in. checked by the compass, finding practically no sign of life of any •km one day spending eighteen hours in the saddle. The camels weie Lc560FD _14 water, with the exception of four of the weakest, who received an occasional tea pot-full poured into the nostrils or squirted in by men’s mouths, “ to cool their brains ”, they said. They picked up very little grazing by the way, and for three days there was not a twig nor a blade. Most of the way lay over undulat ing, rolling, or corrugated sand desert, but they crossed one 50-mile wide stretch of fine dead-flat gravel, which lay in the midst of their course, and which Philby reckons to be 150 miles long and to afford the finest speed track in the world. At the end of 111 hours’ riding from Naifa, and after fifty-five days since seeing another human being, the party reached Sulaiyil with their iron-rations intact. There they rested apd feasted, and thence they made their way by easy stages through the comparatively civilised surrounding of Risha, Turaba, and Taif, to Mecca, which they reached on the 5th April, in nice time for the pil grimage. Philby’s Omaniya celebrated her arrival with ,a foal. She must have done nearly 1,800miles in the ninety days’ outing. Philby himself kept very fit and betrays remarkably little sign of the strain. His determination to ride into Mecca broke down, however, a few miles out at Sail, where he saw a motor-car, and incontinently deserted his camel. As for climatic conditions, at Salwa the morning sand had been too cold to walk upon (Philby is tender-footed). In the Rub’-al-Khali it scorched him. The sun temperature there wms about 140, with about 100 in the shade. The nights were cold, and he appreciated two quilted coverings throughout his trip. No rain was supposed to have fallen in the Rub’-al-Khali for twenty years. On the same day that Mecca was flooded, however, and people were drowned ( f he 6th March), there was heavy rain near Naifa, and rainstorms seemed to have flanked much of the passage of the Emptiest Eighth, but they left the party dry. Philby says that he has enough material to work on for a year. I think it likely that he will visit England in a month or two and take his specimens with him. . {Received on 17th, July 1932, with, Political Secretary’s letter No. 26, dated 30th June 1932.)

We give hereunder a summary of the speech delivered by His Majesty the King at the big Banquet which His Majesty the King gave on Tuesday evening 6th instant (April 12th) and of which a description is published on the fourth page of this issue : t i ^ ie ? rea ^ es ^ graces bestowed by God on mankind is the blessing of ^siam. God Almighty has judged amongst people with justice and selected from amongst their best and most honourable ones His Prophet (may praise and the peace of God be upon him). This is indicated by His saving : ‘ An apostle appeared from amongst you and is powerful over vou, however obstinate you may be ’ The favours and blessings of God are innumerable. Fens15 of the people of the world run drv Wnro +Wr ^ human beings. The rest of the matter is cLtainedTn the foniwing^ are thenoblepXhe” who h doei e noTfpeikas™e a )ikes that d G t d h- Sra f iOUSly granted us impeccable Z infallible, ast Tenti^d M StlonTf geXg eloser'to h, His cmmnand, surrendering to His pardon and being safTfrom H^^nerT One of His gracious favours is that God Almighty also imposed upon them the performance of five prayers and commanded them to gather at such prayers and especially on Friday which He distinguished with many merits. He also fixed for them the greatest day m this blessed spot which is the source of the diW inspiration and religion as one of the greatest favours of God Almighty So we should confess to such favours, and the confession must not be through the tongue only but by heart and soul as well so that we shall perform one of the duties or the first principles. Moslems have to confess to the favours of God and to express their thanks for the same. Unity and co-operation amongst Moslems and following His Command • &lt; Keep fast to the word of God, all, and do not separate \ God Almighty gave us the example of His Prophet and commanded us in His Holy Book to follow that example in the Prophet of God. So it is our duty to follow the example of the Prophet and his friends. Do you know what ruined religion and increased misguidance amongst Moslems ? This is only due to dispute and disagreement amongst Moslems. If we go back to the early days of Islam and think of the countries which the Moslems conquered, the idols they destroyed and the great prosperity they achieved, we shall find that all that happened was only due to agreement in and keeping to the religions commands, sincerity in work, honesty and faithfulness. God graciously granted Islam and unity to Moslems, but when they separated they were defeated and God empowered their enemies over them. So if the Moslems re-co-operate and help each other, their old dignity and glory will return to them. God says :—‘ God will not change the state of people until they change it by themselves \ Fate is doubtless coming. When Moslems acted wisely and exchanged advice, they achieved the highest stage, but when they disputed they came to such a state as we now see and regret. The soul is in clined to commit evils. Perhaps one man is aware of this and fails to take steps to safeguard himself against it, while another might know the religion and act in accordance with its principles ; and so God, being aware of his heart, renders bis efforts successful. Moslems now-a-days are awaking from sleep and inadvertence. They should therefore take hold of their weapon which is of two kinds : the materials weapon, such as aeroplanes, etc. ; the Moslems cannot possess of this kind such as their enemies possess of already, unless God is willing. The other weapon which is greater than the above-mentioned one, is that which I advise mvself and yon to follow, namely, piety and the keeping ot the commands of God. If you follow this advice you will attain glory m this world and be granted pardon in the next. The Mercy of God extends ^9, e ^ er ^ m ^' This nation can achieve no progress except in the way followed by its first ones. Any other way is useless. I admit that power is necessary m every mg, n agriculture, politics and industry, and in every. thing that c( ? nies U inc ^J , dience to God, but in anything contrary to this, it is useless to obey the meatu e and to disobey the Creator. The Prophet of God recommended ^arning foreign languages, because they are to he considered as amongst e m _ P ° Tr pr the enemy, so that he may overcome them not. So we him. •. v . . We have associated to-day in the beat places ' nder discuss obedience to God Almighty, and without such obedience ™ achieved. He who is in confusion may come to ns and^ ^ y ( j od that He he who has any advice may say it, and as for th - p may safeguard us against his evils and for him we ’ if It the relations between me and God y e y^Ubetags^lnd^are not ever- between me and P eo P^ are T ^ d ' be J e of a H creatures has passed away and lasting nor remain for ever, ifie fiesr 01&gt;,• fronds too have also passed away after him. Man should endeavour and try to do his best for the general welfare and interest. Peonle have been talking too much about the Hejaz and its people. They criticize them only because they believe in God Almighty, the ever Praiseworthy. The Heiaz was once under the Turks and then under the Sherifs before us, and lliese men are the sons of the past ones. They are aware of the past situation von are also aware of the bloodshed then done, the sms committed and the neace violated When God made me its ruler, I did what I could, being a Slave of God, and have no other rule or way to follow except the true religion, and this Holy Book between my hands, and the Islamic law. If what people say is something against religion, the truth is what is men tioned in the Holy Book. The one who conceals the truth is cursed and every thing contradictory to religion should be left out and discarded. If anyone has anything to say as emanating from the wise ancestors . or the conscious (/recognised) Caliphs or the four Imams, he may mention it to us for verifica tion • and if anyone has advice to draw our attention from the ‘ Book ’ or the Traditions Ave are prepared at all times to listen to him, Avhether he may be a big one or’ a small, important or unimportant. Anyone wishing us to act con- trarv to these we will never attend to. God commanded us to follow the &lt; Shar’fa ’ (law) of Islam and to keep to it. He who feels annoyed at us When we came to rule over the Hejaz, people were of different characters ; some were malevolent, some were vindictive, some were friends and others sincere. Of our Moslem brethren we accepted any advice, on condition that it is right. There are two matters which we cannot consent to even if all the people of the world were to fight against us until none of us remained, namely, the slightest deviation from the religion of God ; for it is useless to obey the creature and to disobev the creator ; so we will never deviate from the Book and the Traditions. The second thing is that it is impossible for us to allow any action that may affect the independence or violate the honour of our country, no matter who may speak and what he may say, for facts are known and established, and this is our duty so far as religion and the world are concerned. Some people frequently say ‘ Why does Ibn Sa’ud not arrange for associa tions and committees to promulgate propaganda against the English, Russian or Italian people and others, and defend the Moslems ? ’ I wish to bring to light such suspicion and to explain its reality. I am not one of the men who make statements without reasoning matters out. 1 am a practical man and, if I say something, I act accordingly. It is dis graceful to my religion and honour to say something which I do not actually do. I am not accustomed to do so and I should never like to become accustomed. WTiat do people want from me ? Do they want me to speak and say something ; then 1 get no reply and I keep still. What is the use of the words which are not followed by deeds ? It is a habit I am not accustomed to, neither are my people. I do not tell the editor of the ‘ Umm-al-Qura ’ or anyone else to speak against so-and-so, but I command silence until the time of action has come and, if we begin to take action, we speak. We have been keeping still because we were in doubt of the state of people, and I mean by people most of those who pretend to be Moslems. Such people are those whose evils I apprehend and whom I watch before all others. Renounce blame, as the sin is not one, and leave everything you meet m your way to the circumstances. ‘ If a close friend of your party act dishonestly with you, how wonderful would it be if those who have no relation with you were to act peace fully ’ (couplet). If Moslems speak against Christians, they speak politely and Avith good manners, but if they speak against Moslems, they accuse wrongfully as if the} were their enemies. They say, Ibn Sa’ud said so and so and did such and such, but it is all wrong and forgery. Why all this ! There are some men who acted vindictively against us, looking with an evil eye at what God granted us. So the devil tempted them to do many evil deecK I did not find one of the Moslems defending me, even in one single case. Moslems presented the Hayameyn charities and Wakfs and began to prevent peopleperforming pilgrimage All this is against Ibn Sa’ud. What has Ibn Sa’n.l done 1 Has Ibn ba nd erected an idol to be worshipped instead of God ? Has he allowed intoxicants ? _ Has he permitted adultery and prostitution ? Has Ibn Sa ud left the mischievous committing evil actions on earth ? What has Ibn Sa’ud done contrary to the Shar’fa and against Arab manliness ? By God, I fear the foreigner once but I fear those who pretend to be Moslem three thousand Hmes. I hope the Moslems will excuse me for sayino* so. Bv God, I am true in what I say. The Prophet was asked as to whether a Moslem commits adultery, steals or tells a lie, and he replied for the first two in the affirmative but for the third in the negative. I swear by God that I do not tell a lie. This is the truth. What have the Moslems agreed upon and striven for, and I hesitated to join them ? I delay or advance as is necessary and I do not commit any action that may ruin my country. When it is time for action, the disgrace rests with the one who is late. If people give their wealth, I give mine ; if they sacrifice their souls, I do the same to myself and my sons ; but as to exciting words, which bring more harm than use to us, I have nothing to do with them * but if 'Moslems go forth for action, it wiiPbe disgraceful for our honour, ours, the Arabs, if we fail to do the same. They say that there is famine in the Hejaz. They censure Ibn Sa’ud for lack of rain ; they say Ibn Sa’ud is contracting a loan with the English, and Ibn Sa’ud wants to do this and that. I have not taken away the money of the Hejaz or its property but, on the contrary, I have improved the state of the Hejaz and the Hejazis in this sacred country. I have, by the Grace of God, effected peace on the roads and hand-cuffed the mischievous, enforced the religious law throughout the Kingdom from the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea and from Sabya and Jizan to Qaryat al Milh. This is all from God ; ‘ It was not you who threw when you threw, but it is God who threw ’. They say that fhe Beduin are dying from lack of rain. God Almighty is the effective cause and if he wanted to keep away rain from the Beduin what can Ibn Sa’ud do 1 But the disgrace rests with the Moslems who prevented the sending of the charities and Wakfs of the people of the two Holy Sanctuaries, and who tried to make intrigue amongst people and prevent them by evil pro paganda from performing the pilgrimage. As to the lack of rain amongst the Beduin it is nothing disgraceful on our part, because it is from God, who must be thanked ‘and praised for whatever He gives. This is not the case with the Beduin of the Hejaz only, but it is the same with Palestine and ’Iraq too. Nevertheless, God has been Merciful to His Slaves and He is the Most Merciful. That is a thing which neither we nor they can avoid. If I could avoid it, even had I to sacrifice my sons, I would not have hesitated about doing so. By God, I.do not possess any money and my only properties are the sword and the Qu’ran. The money of the Hejaz is for the people of the Hejaz ; and I protect and defend them. I declare openly that if any one of the Moslem Kings, princes or merchants wants to do a benevolent deed for the Moslems m this country he is warmly welcome, provided he does not violate the honour of our country, neither does he affect our independence or anything of our reli gious matters. False statements shown in true appearance we do not accept consent to, or even listen to. We must maintain everything offered to us by a means in a lawful manner. People have been confusedly talking about the untrue loan and fabricating rumours. 1 swear by God, the only One God, that I have not contracted a loan with the English or others, but perhaps we may need to take from the Moslems or others, r but if it occurs it cannot be beyond the limits o± the Shar a am should not affect the independence of the country and what it consists ot. it there are any Moslems, whether a King or a merchant, who wants to help the Hejaz and its people in the lawful way, I will afford assistance to im. I also say that if anyone has advice to give us, Moslem whether now, at another time between us and him, or in future before Moslem Ulama. By God. I do not agree to allow any harmful thing ‘'f^^^Jj^Yged the Moslem countries. I look upon the old one as^ ' j god an d you as my brother and the young as my son. This is W M,1 f&gt; n d and nravers and to follow, and facts are as clear as anything praise be to God and prayers and peace he upon Muhammad, his relatives and men s.

(Repeated to Baghdad, No. 110.) Hejazi Government have secret information value of which I cannot assess that members of King Ali’s circle are plotting attempt on Emir Feisal when he visits Baghdad early in July. They wish His Majesty’s Government to know this and seek their advice more particularly as to whether visit should be aban doned. It is not suggested that King of Iraq is implicated. I have pointed out action to avert danger could only be taken by the Iraq Government whom it would be more natural to approach direct and that e\en if His Majesty’s Government should be willing to intervene they would find it difficult to take responsibility of giving advice without consulting that Govern ment secretly. I expressed opinion regarding difficulty would be all the greater as abandonment of visit might have considerable political effect at a time like this when Hejaz-Nejd and Iraq are known to have differences, when Iraq Oharge d’Affaires has left Jedda unexpectedly and when attempts are being made m press to bring Iraq into orbit of Ibn Rifada affairs. Minister for Foreign Affairs observes truly that Hejaz Government have no present means of communicating on such a subject with Baghdad. He sees no objection to High Commissioner consulting the Iraq Government if you consul that the best course. (71) P.Z.-3719|I932. „ ^^BTircor^mTTrrn^Ejur ™ Jerusalem, Amman and Jedda.)

I gathered from my recent conversations with King Feisal and Jafar, Minister for Foreign Affairs, that Emir Feisal’s proposed visit to Baghdad during the present summer was regarded by them as an, unmitigated nuisance and that no one would be better pleased than King Feisal if some plausible reason could be given for the Emir’s return to Hejaz direct from Constantinople, where I understand he is at present. In the event, however, if the Emir’s going to Tehran as arranged, it would be awkward to explain why he missed out Baghdad. I can sound King Feisal on the subject, if desired. Personally I do not see that there is anything to be gained by Emir’s visit to Baghdad just now.

As the Kingdom of Afghanistan had no f Haji Khana ’ (Rest house for pilgrims) in the Hedjaz and as it was ordained by God that a ‘Haji Khana ’ should be constructed in that land during the blessed period of His Majesty’s rule and in the name of the Afghan nation, wherein Afghan Hajis^ may stay, His Majesty decided some time ago to found a Haji Kha a there and sanctioned a sufficient sum of money for the purpose. His Majesty has now deputed His Excellency the Minister of Court and sent two learned Ulamas named Saifur Rahman Khan and Said Mobashhir Khan Tarazi to accompany him and has invested him with powers to select a site for the ‘ Haji Khana’ in the Hedjaz and lay the foundation stone ( ? ). In view of our religious relations and of the fact that a considerable number of Afghan subjects visit that country on the occasion of the Haj pilgrimage. His Excellency has also been empowered to enter into negotiations and conclude a treaty of friend* ship with the Hedjaz Government in order to strengthen our diplomatic relations with that co-religionist Government. (27-A) (Received on 20th March 1932, with Political Secretary's letter No. P. Z.-9, dated the 3rd March 1932.) Letter from the Admiralty, to the India Office, No. M.-0371/32, dated the 23rd Eebrtjary 1932. I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to transmit, for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, extracts from a report which has been received from the Senior Officer, Red Sea Sloops, concerning the transport of a medical mission from Aden to Mekka, Yemen in H. M. S. “ Penzance Similar letters have been addressed to the Colonial Office and Foreign Office. Endo. 1 to Serial No. (27 A). Medical Mission to Taiz, Yemen. 3. In the course of interviews with the Resident’s Staff, my visit to the Political Secretary coincided with that of Colonel M. C. Lake, Political Officer, and it came to my knowledge that the attention of a woman Doctor was urgently needed by the Grand daughter of the Imam of Yemen, who is the wife of the Cammander-in-CHfef and Governor of Taiz. This presented a very favourable opportunity for a gesture on our part, significant of genuine altgruistic friendliness towards the Yemeni. It was apparent that the provision and organisation of transport over that part of the route to Taiz which involved camel and mule transport, pre sented considerable difficulty. The Arab lady patient in question was on tte point of death from some undiagnosed woman’s complaint, and no one but a woman would be allowed to treat her.4. I therefore mentioned the possibility of a passage for the Medical Mission in His Majesty s ship, whose already scheduled visit to Mocha would provide an efficient and. easy solution to their problem. My proposal was not immediately accepted as the several individual * interests of the personnel of the Mission had to be studied. The matter was therefore in abeyance as far as His Majesty’s ship was concerned, and I did not see fit at this stage to raise the point with higher authority. Shortly before transmission of my message 1700/26, however, a letter was received from the Resident accepting my proposal and emphasisimo' the importance of such timely assistance on the part of His Majesty’s Navy.° 5. In order to make some definite impression on Arab mentality in the Yemen. I ventured to apply the broadest possible discretion allowed by King’s Regulations, while adopting to the best of my and my officers’ ability the decision which we considered would have been made by you under similar circumstances. 6. The Mission was embarked at 0550 on Sunday 27th December. The three woman were accommodated as guests in my Cabin, and allowed the use of the reserved Starboard side of boat deck for exercise. The two men, Colonel Lake, Political Officer, and Doctor Petrie were the guests of the Ward Room Officers. The cost of the meals supplied to the Natives is being recovered from the Resident, Aden. 7. It happend that the N. E. Monsoon wind on that day was particularly fresh resulting in some motion to the ship which kept all passengers qaiet. Exceptional contrary currents were experienced both in Gulf of Aden and Red Sea. On arrival off Mocha at sunset, 1| hours later than antici pated, flares were lit on the North and South Forts and in the town in reply to searchlight and these lights materially assisted the straightforward passage to the Northward of the outlying reefs, and finally enchoring in 5 fathoms in the Roadstead li miles from the town at 2,100. 8. A dhow came alongside on the ship’s arrival conveying the Sheikh of Mocha, but the women passengers could not very well be committed to such an unpleasant trip in the dark, and it was too rough for ship’s boats. To wait for daylight and thereby avoid native hospitality for the night in some ruined building in Mocba was therefore decided upon. Transport to Taiz from Mocha bad already been arranged for 0800 Monday. Accordingly the Mission, medical stores and camp equipment were disembarked at 0630 Monday, and the outfit had started off on the motor car portion of the journey by 1000, for the comparatively short trip to Taiz over passable roads. 9. The expected opportunity to exchange civilities with the Sheikh of Mocha then presented itself. A present consisting of 3 bullocks and 2 sacks of coffee beans had arrived on board at dawn. The compliment was returned in person and in kind by ship’s whaler. In consequence the preliminary negotiations for the re-establishment of periodical visits of His Majesty s ships to Yemeni ports have been opened under auspicious circumstances. Ibo Sheikh (Sayed Abdul Jelileim Abmed Pasha) was not only unaffectedly pleased but also obviously gratified by the honour accorded him y e P ® senee of His Majesty’s ship. He expressed an earnest wish for another visit* at an early date. 105(C) f&amp;pd„ . _r, .formation received from Senior Officer, Persian Gulf, that jl/MSC«f.

His Swedish Majesty’s Ship ” Fylgia ’’—Captain Count, G. G. C. Wachtminster, A.D.C., arrived at 08-00 on 21st December. The Officer of the Guard returned with a message expressing a wish that all official calls might be postponed until the following day a ter “Fylgia” had completed with coal. The Resident, Aden gave an official luncheon party attended by Captain and 1 Officers from “ Fylgia . Official calls were exchanged with “ Fylgia’’ the following day. “Penzance’s” motor boat was placed at the disposal of the Resident as he has now no boat provided for the purpose. An official ball at the Residency was attended by a large number of Swedish Officers, including youngest son of the King, a Cadet, and nearly all the European colony of Aden. The interview with Resident, Aden finally resulted in the conveyance of the Medical Mission to Mocha. Aderu to Mocha. —Erom information received from the Imam’s agent, a Sheik who accompanied the Medical Mission as Liaison Officer, it appears that the telegraph line from Hodeida to Sheih Seyd has been reopened after eeveral years’disuse. The question was raised when a n3W building was noticed in a prominent position on the Arabian side of the bmail fetrait, Babel Mandeb. The Yemen Government has approached the Eastern Telegraph Company through the Manager of Perim Coal Company, requesting that the cable between Sheih Seyd and Perim might be re-fitted, ine Eastern Telegraph Company has referred the matter to Head Quarters in London, but no reply has been received. This information was connrmea at a subsequent visit to Perim.

Slave Trade Intelligence. No fresh or original information has been forthcoming during the period covered by tbis or the former report, in fact the several authorities with whom the matter of slaves has been discussed appear to have nothing to add to their previous remarks and reports, which have been detailed and amplified in the several Letters of Proceedings from the Red Sea Sloops during the past few years. The Aetino Vice-Consul at Djibouti and his predecessor Mr. Salmond merely repeated the many items of evidence in support of the contention that slaves continue to be exported from Abyssinia via Dungkali tenitory (Tajura and Obok district) with impunity. They assert (no brief is held for such sweeping statements) that the Trench Authorities, not only do not exercise effective control over their protectorate, particularly the coastline from Tajura to the Italian Eritrean border but that their subordinate and Native Officials will not risk inter ference with these illicit activities, even if they do not deliberately countenance the traffic in which not a few of them have personal interests. Whether it be contemporary historical literature on Arabia and tho Arabs or intelligence reports originating in the covmtnes bordering the Red Sea ah of them make the most of this very tempting subject of universal interest Slaves; and all of them agree in so many words that that part of French Somalilahd North of the Gulf of Tajura is what may be described as WeS S of the slave trade,’ and the South West monsoon months of June, July and August the “ Slave trooping season . However, all that may or may not be, one is bound to suspect this part of colst as tho obvious outlet, both geographically and otherwise ; and further Sere is no doubt that, of all available natives, Abyssimans are or have been the most in demand in Arabia. »»“~ h «»?”“*» delivery. . n member of the crew of the The Abyssinian boy, ag , ^ knew of several Abyssinians in dhow boarded off Kamaran s a e parents but who were now freed, u sts hex's: ts *■ «&lt; w-—•*» •» “ ^ in Jedda during September and October, IDd..r,-' r .

(13) In view of the angry tone of the Mecca telegrams the Minister thought it advisable for 44 Penzance’s ” departure to be delayed at least 24 hours to allow time for any reaction on part of the Hedjaz Government and in this I concurred and reported my proposal. (14) The history of these events from the Hedjazi side has now been obtained. It was the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, one Fuad Hamza, who ran it, and he was the author of the various uncompromising telegrams received by the Minister. (15) On the 29th January he rang up the Kaimakam (Hajji Abdulla Ali Raza) and he told him to take the necessary steps to ensure that the slave Bahit did not embark. The Kaimakam replied that this was an international affair and outside his province as local governor. That the police were under the Government and that he (Fuad Hamza) must give his orders to the police. He warned Fuad that it rrdght be a serious affair and advised him to act as was the custom in the days of King Hussein, viz., shut his eyes and pretend to know nothing. (16) Fuad, who presumably hoped to gain kudos over the matter with Ibn Saud, then gave his orders to the police. They were to the effect that if Sir Andrew Ryan accompanied the slave himself, the police were to say Bahit conld not go. If Sir Andrew persisted the police were to make another effort, but should Sir Andrew stil P^ rsis they must give away and on no account offer him any resistance. on however the Vice-Consul accompany Bahit, under no circumstance whatever was the slave to be allowed to embark. In fact the Consul (not he ice- Consul) took Bahit down, and the police officer says that was not piovi for in his instructions, and while he was endea vouring to ascer am w a was to be done the slave embarked. The officer is now m jail w er immediately incarcerated.

The date and hour had previously been fixed at his request, and the fact that my call occurred immediately after the embarka tion of the slave could not have been avoided. He was as usual, most charming and affable, and neither he, nor his entourage betrayed in any way that he received me direct from a heated telephonic conversation with Mecca, which fact was overheard by the Legation interpreter who accom panied me. His return call was waived on account of its being Ramadan.

The fifteen sub-divisions (a) to (o) of item 6, however, are estimated to the uttermost piastre. In view of the fact that they represent chiefly the salaries and wa^s of .departmental staffs and employees, and in yiew ako of Fuad Hamza s admission reported in paragraph 4 of Sir A. Ryan’s despatch, that much of the expenditure would in fact be incurred in silver, it is I think safe to assume that the whole of item 6 is calculated in silver piastres. The current rate of these us about 190 to the £ gold. At this rate item 6 would represent some ^ £17o&gt;.000. The total estimated expenditure would thus amount to £bd5,000 m the current financial year which ends next November uU til. fi* You will observe that none of these items of expenditure bears any relation at all to the p rcentage allotments which Sheykh Yusuf Yasin and Fuad Bey Humza informed me officially and confidentially last November would orm the basis of the budgetary reform. 35 per cent, of the revenue was to be devoted to the administration of the country, 25 per cent, to the liquidation of its debt, 25 per cent, to economic development and pilgrimage netids, and 15 per cent, was ;o be put aside as a reserve fund. This basis has evidently gone by the board. When reporting its adoption, I remarked that it was not clear how the King would live. It is now quite clear, however, that about half the revenue, or the £410,000 accounted for by expenditure items 1 to 3, will pass to Ibn Sa’ud, or to his comptroller 1 Sheykh Abdullah Suleyman. I should not be in the least surprised if item 4, Communications and Transport £100,000, also went that way. Items 5 and 6, repayment of debt and payment of administrative costs and salaries, are likely to be the first to suffer from any diminution of revenue below its “ assumed ” total. As I have already reported elsewhere, only 70 per cent, of the first financial month’s salaries and none of the second month’s have so far been paid. The third month is now drawing to a close and the officials are pessimistic. As for the debts, it is the declared intention of the Government to make no repayment until the end of the financial year. I make so bold as to pro phesy that they will then declare their inability to make any repayment. 6. What I have written is no more than a series of assumptions. It is unfortunately impossible to submit to you anything more valid at the pre sent time. It is possible that when the Dutch financial adviser arrives—and I learn that he may shortly be expected—something more concrete may materialize. In the meantime this Legation has done its best to collect such local information as may be had and I have the honour to transmit herewith an interesting memorandum by Mr. Furlonge on the results of the Indian Vice-Consul’s conversations with a leading and intelligent notable, Sheykh Suleyman Gabil, an erstwhile Mayor of Jedda. It discloses, with what accu racy I cannot say, a little of the inner history of the “bud et” and makes an attempt to estimate revenue, which seems to fall short of the estimated ex penditure by about 25 per cent, of the latter. I am very much [inclined to agree with the ex-Mayor’s dictum that “ the whole budget is so much eye wash ”. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the recipients of copies of Sir A. Ryan’s despatch under reference.13 equivalent)—the informal committee of notables which the King consults on important decisions. As a result of their deliberations, Suleyman Gabil as spokesman approached the King with the offer to double the Royal allowance (which v;as fixed in 1926 at about £300,000, according to him) and to adjust the other items of expenditure accordingly. The King agreed and instructed the Committee to consult with Abdullah Suleyman ; which they did at a second meeting held at the latter's house. In the course of this, however, it emerged that the King intended not only to take the doubled allowance but to reserve for himself all the Koshan receipts, which amount in ail to some £7 per pilgrim, or £280,000 last year. Seeing the main item of their anticip ited revenue thus abstracted, the Committee decided that the budget scheme was vitiated beyond remedy, and accordingly submitted a loyal address withdrawing the suggestion, affirming that the King was the father of his country, and advising that the status quo ante he maintained. Since that date the Committee h as had no sort of a voice in the financial arrange ments. 2. The budget published last January is pure Qusuf Y&amp;sin, with a possible flavouring of Abdullah Suleyman. It was arrived at as follows, according to Suleyman Gabil:— (а) The two items of £60,000, Royal allowance, and £235,000, Military have been copied from the grants made to the King in 1926, which, as noted above, were nearly £300,000. (Jedda reported in 1926—Eastern Affairs, Part XVIII, pages 100 and 107—that the grant was £2-1,000, hut this may have been wrong). (б) The other three round-figure items (Debts, Communications, and Princes, Palaces, etc..) were put down at random, in order to look pretty. (c) The remaining items, Administrative expenditure, were copied from the cash-hooks for same past year, probably 1927, when expenditure was at its highest. This explains their meticulous X—piastre accuracy. The division of revenue into percentages announced in November has simply been forgotten. 3 The whole production is so much eye wash. Expenditure under (c) above*is confined to items of immediate urgency with a consequent ermrmous discrepancy between actual expenditure and jihe pubhshed figures, w c represented the amounts expended m an exceptional y eai ^ e , _ j merit was really endeavouring to run the country ^ its debts.

Despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 99, dated the 22nd February 1932. With reference to Sir A. Ryan’s despatch No. 36 of the 21st January (Enclosure to Serial No. 17) on the subject of the new budget, I have the honour to report that the financial situation is as tangled as ever it was I hope to be in a position to discuss the budget more fully at the end of the month, but the following information may be of interest meanwhile. 2. We are now half way through the third month of the new financial yea 11 . At the beginning of the first month, Sha’ban, the salaries of all Government officials and employees were from four to eight months in arrear; these arrears, they were told, would be paid in instalments from the appro priation of revenue to be devoted to the extinction o 1 all debts equally. At the end of the first month only 70 per cent, of the Sha’ban salaries and pay was issued, and at the unfavourable rate of ten riya's to the gold £ in the case of salaries payable in pounds. At the end of the second month, Ramadhan, the majority received no pay at all, but the troops and police were given the remaining 30 per cent, of their Sha’ban pay to keep them quiet and contented. 3. Ramadhan is usually an expensive and busy month, when the merchants and shopkeepers expect to do well. Even the poorest buy new clothes for themselves and better food for their families and cut a dash at the Bairam feast. This year there has been absolute stagnation in Mecca and conditions w r ere but little better here. The whole population is too crippled with debt to move. A general moratorium on all commercial and private liabilities would seem inevitable. Hitherto, however, the only official step in this direction has been the recent suspension by the Amir Feysal of a series of judgments given by the Commercial Court in favour of a number of Jedda merchants against the tradesmen of Mecca. 4. Yet money has been coming into the country. Customs duties and quarantine dues, although certainly very much reduced, must have amount ed to nearly £50,000 during the first two months of the financial year. There is general speculation as to where the balance has gone, after the partial payment of Sha’ban salaries. It is generally believed to have all gone to Riadh and that for this reason no Ramadhan salaries have been paid. The Indian Vice-Consul, who has recently returned from Mecca, assures me that he had it on the reliable authority of a high official of the Finance Depart ment, that £12,000 in gold and 100,000 silver riyals were sent to Riadh on the 27th Remadhan.15 the ColInkrOffic^No! 6 ! of the SthF-brifaTTF ° 0nfident j al despatch to in File No. 172-N/29) that Ihr, F ^ iaar y (Enclosure of Serial No. 194 He even said that Nejd was financing “he HVa^^fcannot beHwe many year.', and especially during 19^1 DeJ1 - ve Il} * for but whether mainly for the benefit of Nejd/or of Ibn Sa’udj or o' his officials’ Whatever thF ditr^thm' 1 Th6 Us P-bably no S: Whatever the distribution there can, I thmk, be no doubt that the Heiaz has supplied a lot of butter for the Najdi slice of bread. n “ o tlejaz (33) MEMORANDUM.

Having a tubercular wife he lives mainly in Cairo. ^ r t^ 2 The purpose of his visit appears to have been twoford, to secure pay- ment of something over two million sloty-some fifty thousand pounds gold-in respect of tl.e Polish arms deli vered to the Hejaz-Nejd Government in 1930 (see paragraph 15 of the Jedda Report for August 1930), and also to find out about the local medical service and sam ary arrangements for the pilorimage. I gather that, although shocked by what he saw and heardo the latter, he tried to use the prospect of persuading a few score Polish Moslems to perform the pilgrimage as an inducement to the Hejazi Government to liquidate their debt. The usual vague deferred terms were offered and a proposal was even made that further consignments of Polish arms should be arranged for. When he pressed Fuad Hamza for a bankers guarantee, he was offered the very superior guarantee of Ibn Sa ud s word. The Professor refused the latter and of course failed to obtain the former. He left equally shocked by Hejazi finance. 3. It appears that the visit was made at the request of the Polish Chargb d’Affaires at Cairo. The Professor was given to understand that it would not be unaccompanied by discomfort and even danger ; he was advise to wear a fez, for infidel headgear would expose him to attack m the stieets of Jedda. Having brought only a Lz, he was disgusted to find that we all wore helmets and hamburgs and panama hats, but he gave full marks to tne discomfort of his stay ; he was lodged, like all improvident foreign wanderers to this place, in the Governor’s private residence. 4.

W ith reference oo my despatch No. 119 of the 5th March (Enclo 1 to Senal No. 31) on the object of the budget, I ha.e the honour to report that I learn from a confidential and fairly trustworthy source that the Jedda Custom receipts for th.e first quarter of the current financial year amounted to some £-N,5 jO gold. The Customs houses at Yanbu.and other Ports may have taken ha if as much again, bringing the total to about £40 000 but I have no figures to go on Revenue from Customs would thus fall well below the rough estimate of £100,000 as average customs revenue per quarter which I submitted in my previous despatch. Tnc detailed figures of the quarter s receipts are attached. 2. I also learn, from, uhe quarantine authorities, that the number of pil grims who arrived i iring the quarter was about 9,000. These will have yielded, at the generally computed figure of £7 per head for koshan, a total of £03,000 gold, plus £9,000 in quarantine dues. 3. Out of this minimum total revenue of about £110,000 for the quarter, the only known outgoings have been some £29,000 in respect of the first and third months’ salaries, which have now been paid. The pay of all Govern ment servants is thus only one month in arrear on the completion of the first quarter of tne new budgetary year. 4. It iq I think probable that most of the remaining £80,000 of revenue has gone to Riadh. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the recipients of my despatch under reference. (Enclosure).

Lists therefore, of British exporters of the articles referred to are enclosed in this letter fur communication to Ahmed Yusuf Khan and Brothers if Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare sees no objection. It might at the same time be explained to the firm that the activities of British commercial and Consular officers abroad are chiefly directed towards the promotion of the export trade in British and not foreign products. 3. It also appears possible to Mr. Colville that in view of the references to Soviet activities in the Red Sea contained in various paragraphs of the Aden periodical intelligence reports, it may be of interest to note, for other than commercial reasons, thn desiro of Ahmed Yusuf Khan and Brothers to form commercial connections with the Soviet Government. 4.

Despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 444, dated the 17th November 1931. With reference to my telegram No. 241 of the T4th November [S. No. mi regarding the financial situation, I have the honour to transmit here with a 'translation of the royal proclamation, or letter as it is familiarly styled, announcing budgetary reform. 2 The opening phrases are somewhat misleading. The King poses as having obeyed the call of duty. In reality he has disobeyed it for months. He states that he (took the initiative in informing himself of the whole situation In reality it was his second son, egged on by his Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, no doubt stimulated in his turn by Mr. Philby’s and his own personal animosity towards his financial colleague, who spurred his Maiesty into belated activity by forcing upon him a great deal of unpalatable information. Ibn Sa’ud states that the information was submitted through the Minister, more properly Director-General of Finance. In reality it accompanied him to Riadh as unwelcome evidence of his guilt, which he has evidently failed to disprove. Towards the end of his letter the King informs his people that he has kept his Finance Minister at Riadh in the interests of the finances of Nejd; his people know better, or think they do. They do not believe that Sheykh ’Abdullah Suleyman will be released for a long time, but Fuad Bey Hamza has told me that it is only too true that he will soon return. He, with Yusuf Yasin, is making the most of ’Abdullah Suleyman’s absence. 3. I was asked to call at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs here on the 13th November to meet Sheykh Yusuf Yasin who had arrived post-haste from Riadh over night. The glad news of reform was broken to me, fol lowed by the less gratifying news of a virtual moratorium on all Government debts, internal and external, and rounded off by an invitation to His Majesty s Government to stand on a footing of equality with all other creditors in the matter of the 1929 debt to the Government of India. 4. I enquired what part of the revenue was to be devoted to funding these debts, how much it would amount to, and what period was calculated to be necessary for the liquidation of the current indebtedness. Only in the matter of proportion were any figures available. The total revenues, k appears, are to be classified under four headings to meet four main objects, as follows:— (1.) Official salaries, thirty-five per cent. This was explained to me as covering all the normal costs of administration. (2) Indebtedness, twenty-five per cent. This was to cover all arrears of salaries as well as the internal and external debt or the Hejazi Government. (3) Reserve, fifteen per cent. This is a notable novelty which will have all the attraction of a pot of honey. (4) Extraordinary expenses, twenty-five per cent. This is intended to ensure the comfort and health of pilgrims and to develop the country’s hidden resources. 5. As regards approximate figures, I could be given no information. Much spade-work remained to be done. But as regards the length of time which it would take to pay off current debts, Fuad Bey informed me—YusufYasin having by then gone to say his prayers—that they calculated it at about two years. In reporting the matter to you in my telegram under reference, I therefore suggested that the concurrence of His Majesty’s Gov ernment with this still further postponed repayment of the Government of India debt might be made conditional on the production of a satisfactory budget estimate. 6. I have already reported in the same telegram the Hejazi Govern ment’s attitude towards the other outstanding British credits, namely, the costs of the MacDonnell investigation, the account with the Eastern Tele graph Company and the two classes of debts owing to Messrs. Gellatly Hankey and Company (Sudan) Limited. I have as yet nothing more to ;add. 7. Sheykh Yusuf Yasin and Euad Bey Hamza spent two busy days in negotiation with the Government’s other creditors in Jedda. I fear that they have gone too fast. A great diversity of categories of indebtedness and conditions of security and treatment has been brought to light but nothing has been reduced to writing and the Sheykh and the Bey have now returned to Mecca with views and intentions which undoubtedly conflict with the impressions they have left behind them with the creditors here. 8. One further point of interest has emerged. It is intended to make Jedda the chief centre of financial control and hopes are still entertained of securing the services of a Dutchman as financial adviser. My Dutch col league seems less hopeful. 9. The reform, in short, is late, perhaps too late in time, drastic in theory, and reducible in practice to the low levels of local diligence and in tegrity. Moreover it is not obvious how Ibn Sa’ud himself will live, unless he lives on the salaries of his officials, the funded debts, the pilgrims, or the reserve. I did not broach the delicate question which ..... Enclo. to S. No. (4).

God Almighty has now helped us to arrive at an organisation of income and expenditure. Expenditure has been weighed against income in the most advantageous fashion, and revenues of the Gov ernment have been divided up and classified under four headings, each according to its needs :— (1) Official Salaries, (2) Indebtedness, (3) Reserve, (4) Extraordinary expenses (not decided upon). Instructions have accordingly been laid down and arrangements co ordinated for the collection and conservation of these revenues, with a view to their being disbursed under the specific headings. The quotas allocated under the regulations and instructions confirmed by us are to be adhered to in such a manner that no person will be preferred to another in the matter of drawing or disbursing any money from the treasury. Under these regula tions the principle has been laid down that salaries and debts shall be settled in equality amongst all persons. Strict orders have been issued that this principle must be observed and that any person infringing these instructions orders and regulations shall be severely punished. The budget will, Please God, be sufficient to ensure the dues of all officials, inhabitants and claimants of the different categories, certain items of expenditure having been reduced and certain items of revenue having been increased in very reasonable pro portions. It depends for this on the principal revenue of the country, which the Government is endeavouring, by all the material and intellectual , means at their disposal, to foster and augment, with a view to its becoming the main source of Government income. It has been arranged that the undetermined portion of the income shall be spent on its own objects, such as securing the comfort of pilgrims, facilitating their journey and preparing sanitary measures and all such things as may bring tranquillity and happiness to them and the people of the country. In order that the affairs and interests of the inhabitants may he within the scope of the sacred religious law and the re gulations which depend therefrom, we have ordered our Viceroy and the Council of Ministers over which he presides to be watchful in carryino- out our orders as regards the maintenance of peace and of justice and equity amongst the people without distinction between the strong and the weak; to follow our instructions as regards the improvement of finance; and to ensin e t at everv person shall have his rights without delay or negligence. e a\e or ©red Yusuf Yasin to convey all the instructions and orders in .ffiis respect to the Viceroy in the Hejaz, so that he will see that they are notified and complied with attentatively.

Copy to Department of Overseas Trade in P. L. No. 0. T. 29 of 27th November, 1931. Enclo. to S. No. (7).t Memorandum. Mr. Twitchell returned to Jedda from the United States of America on October 19, accompanied by his wife, who also aclts as his secretary, and by a Mr. Moseley, an American prospector who has spent all his life mining in the Rocky Mountains and Mexico and who appears to be capable tech nician of no remarkable attainments. The six engineers who, as stated in Jedda despatch No. 366 of September 12, were reported ito be arriving with Mr. Twitchell, did not come with him and there appears no immediate pros pect of their appearance. The party were accommodated in the Government guest-house at Jedda, which had been specially redecorated for them, and settled down for a stay of some months. The “Umm-al-Qura” newspaper had heralded their arrival by two long articles. The first, published in its issue of September 11, expatiated on Ibn Sa’ud’s pre-occupation for the water supply of the Hejaz and related the history of the Waziria wells, distant 11^ kilometres from Jedda on the Mecca Road. These wells, it appears have been known since the time of Mustafa Pasha in 1640 and were opened up and connected to the town by a conduit by the Turkish ruler of the Hejaz, Osman Pasha, in 1882. They gave a regular supply until 1900, when they dried up. The second article, in the issue of October 2, gave a glowing account of the mineral wealth which had been known since ancient times to exist in the country, and a eulogy of the King who had conceived the idea of digging them up. Messages of en couragement had, it appeared, been received from other Moslem countries. After their arrival the two engineers proceeded to Taif, presumably to investigate further the traces of gold which, as reported in Appendix A to Jedda despatch No. 365 of September 12th, were supposed to have been found in that neighbourhood. Mr. Twitchell returned after five days to Jedda, leaving Mr. Moseley with an interpreter at Taif. where he still remains; no information has transpired as to what success he has so far met with. At Jedda Mr. Twitchell has been chiefly concerned with the production of water from the Waziria wells mentioned above. Work has been proceed ing since July on the old Turkish conduit under the supervision ofMr. Ousman the British engineer in charge of the local sea-water distillery and has recently resulted in a dirppt flnw i , VVcl ^ i 1 uistmery, wpllq and ledda Mr t ^ ^ 0t Water bem S achl eved between the mm water Dumn which h6 l h f d L m0re ° Ver ’ brou S Kt with him a win&lt;1 - he next 103’ It is th U c P and wo, ' kin g in the course of the next month. It is therefore probable that the well-water will shortly be available for the use of the inhabitants at a cost considerably less ?han that of condenser water, which will prove a very real boon, especially in the present time of economic depression. The condenser may be allowed to fall into disuse. Mr. Twitchell has also been envisaging a system of irrigation for the area immediately surrounding the town which will render it possible to lay out gardens and thus relieve the present utter barrenness of the out- skirts. In conversation Mr. Twitchell has shown the greatest reticence as to his discoveries up to the present, and a disinclination to look further than the next step ahead of him. Ihe development of a mining industry, as he points out, consists of four successive stages, prospecting, sampling, setting up of plant, and organisation of transport. Of these only the first has as yet been touched on and no opinion can be pronounced until it has been com pleted. His attitude in this respect contrasts markedly with that of his hosts. The King has shown the greatest interest in and encouragement of Mr. Twitchell s activities, and the authorities concerned have extended to him assistance which he describes as “prompt, regular, and efficient’’, terms seldom heard of in the Hejaz. These unwonted official efforts on his behalf, combined with the tone of all the Press articles which have appeared in the “Umm-al-Qura”, show the high hopes entertained by the Hejazi Govern ment, and passed on to the people, of the results of his investigations in pro viding a revenue additional to the pilgrimage for the country. It will be interesting to see whether their disappointment at the lack of immediate outcome to his work will result in a backsliding from the standard of assist ance which they have set themselves and the consequent disillusionment of the so far enthusiastic American. Another former enthusiast, Mr. Philby, has gone that way. ( 8 ) (Received on 10th January 1932, with Political Secretary's letter No. P. Z.-52, dated 2Ath December 1931.)

It is possible that the letter of October 21st from Mubarik Ali and Mirza Suleiman Ahmed makes the position clearer and you will no doubt send us a copy if you think it would help. In any case what are the insults referred to in Mubarik’s letter of the 6th November and how do the Dutch Consulate come into the affair ? Should not a copy of the correspondence have gone direct to India ? ( 10 ) {Received .on 24th January 1932, with Political Secretary's letter No. P.Z.- 4, dated 7th January 1932.)

In my printed letter ia’ud’s proclamation announcing ? £,nN.-7 was transmitted a series of an- !o. 400 of the 30th November which were publish- “^••UmS-Quri” of the20th/they conveyed the King’s commands to L1G08(C) T'&amp;PDKKMWJW’T'i flag f r n no reduce expenditure, select a Reorganisation Committee, create a Treasury Department, and appoint a Treasurer, and meanwhile to employ the Director- General of Finance and the Vice-President of the Hejasi Legislative Assembly in an mspectional tour of the other side of Nejd. 2. I now have the honour to enclose a translation of a leading article from the “Umm-al-Qura” of the 4th December entitled) “Between two Epochs; Memorable Deeds of His Majesty” as well as a more restrained but not very illuminating announcement on “The New Budget”. 3. The two epochs are, of course, the evil past, relieved only by the King’s good deeds, and the radiant future in both this world! and the next. The memorable deeds of His Majesty are five in number. First and fore most is his constitution of a Council of four Under-Secretaries of State, having collective and individual responsibility under the presidency of bis Viceroy; the second is his establishment of a Budget; the third the assessment of the Government’s assets and liabilities; the fourth the concentration of all revenue in a central Treasury and its allotment to various defined objects; and, fifthly, measures of economy in the personnel and expenditure of Government departments. These are not the first proofs which His Majesty has given of his Islamic sincerity, his Arabic zeal, and his devotion to his people, but they now effectively discharge his conscience of his obligations towards Allah and the country. In another extract which is also enclosed, from the “Umm-al-Qura” of the 27th November, the editor deems it worthy of glorification and praise that His Majesty has also commanded the reduc tion of his personal expenses to an exceeding degree as a further proof of his democratic principles. 4. All this has meant a lot of work for the only Under-Secretary of State in action, Faud Bey Hamza, Sheykh Yusuf Yasin having returned! to Riadh. He is naturally elated by the success of his efforts to break the Abdullah Suleyman regime, create a budget, and constitute a central organ of responsibility and control. It is still too soon to say that the reforms will work, however. There is such a remarkable lack of adequate men and money, and so little prospect of supplementing either deficiency, that they will cer tainly have a hard struggle to survive. Pessimism is general. Few believe that the creation of a budget and the establishment of a Treasury under a bankrupt of 35, whom there was not enough money to send as first Secretary to the Hague, offer any guarantee of honest or capable financial management. Various and curious arrangements are being come to with the more pushing of the Government’s creditors. The budget is to date from the 12th December (the 1st Sha-ban) but no figures are given, promised!, or even surmised. When the dust of all this unwonted activity settles, it will probably simply be seen that the landmarks have shifted but the desert is much the same. Enclosure 2 to S. No. 10. Frandation of extract from t( Umm-al-Qura'\ No. 36£, dated December 1931 (24-7 L 1350). “Between Two Epochs”. “Displaying Fresh Improvements”. “Memorable Deeds of His Majesty”.. The second half of last month and the twenty days which have elapsed of this month have been full of great deeds, which should be registered in golden letters on the forehead of the age in favour of His Majesty who is situing on the throne, they should be added to his noble deeds and great services to this country, which has tasted no comfort and prosperity for ages, except during his happy golden days.Readers must have learnt of thp qnhQtanno ^-c which gracious Royal Orders have bppn icon ^ -p t ^ e f e im P rovemen ts, for iu recent issues ot^his pIpL J nd ha veT h’ T ^ P ublications those issues, the Royal P^amatf™ whfeh /“ ^ t™ 1 page of one of which His Majesty'has deter^ied^o^ffet^hi^r’ 31116 ^ the WISe P?f itical P lan critical and dreadful crisis. We havef Iren J ove ™ m ™t to follow at this tioi of the Proelarmtinn • ea ^ mentioned since the publica- 1 01 r , ; 1 rocia Ration, the improvements made and introduced into tho various Government Departments, which will secure the runnhifo affairs m good order, the maintenance of the rights of the people and the reasurv and the care and bettering of the state of visitors to tlds country We are not m much need of making any further explanation, for the publications we have made speak for themselves of the memorable knd everlfsting deeds of the redeemed King We however think it useful to display the splendid improvement le eXpeCted g0 ° d C0Ilse q u ences of general prosperity and great We said that the last few weeks have been full of glorious deeds and we are not exaggerating in our statement, because such a period can certaTn ly be accounted as one separating two epochs. The former closed with its good and evil actions, as well as all the other great improvements which His Majesty had been personally looking after; the latter opened the door ° f j a i e wiT° Wering and , S UInrj ^ tlrae ’ whlch we hope will be full of prosperity and all the success we desire in this world and! progress in the next. The first of the new improvements that can be displayed, and which His Majesty has ordered to be carried out, is the improvement he has introduced into the Central Government, so that it may become a Government able to bear the burdens of its Governmental duties for the welfare of the nation tne Government and the country. The most important aspect of this im provement is that of the personal and joint responsibility of the principal Government officials. The Government in the past has lacked such respon- sibiiity. ^ It has been found that the laying of responsibility on people in dividually and jointly and their co-operation in bearing the burdens of Government will bring forth welfare and avoid much harm. His Majesty has therefore issued his orders for the constitution of a “Majlis al Wukala” (Council of Under-Secretaries or sub-Ministers) under the presidency of His Highness the Viceroy and consisting of the Under-Secretaries of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Interior and Legislation to supervise the affairs of the country and to run them in their various directions' within the scope and the defined capacities decided upon in accordance with the Royal ordfers. Mem bers of the Council are held responsible jointly for the actions to be taken by them. A detailed regulation in which this responsibility and these capa cities will be defined is going to be drawn up. The next item of the series of new improvements is the gracious decree of establishing the budget of the country on a firm basis and in such a manner that the revenue and expenditure are checked, and calculation has been made tentatively, on good authority, for anv possible deficiency in the income. The budget has been established on this sound basis, and thus both sides, income and expenditure, have become equal. This fact is one of the utmost importance to the Government and the country. The third item is the checking of the Government’s claims and liabili ties and .the taking of decisive action for the collection of the former and the settlement of the latter at their fixed times. A special share of the revenues of the Government has been allotted for these debts, as is pointed out in the gracious Royal Proclamation, and it is hoped that such liabilities will be settled in due course by the budget referred to. The fourth matter which should be counted as of the utmost and deepest importance as far as the recent improvements are concerned is the checking of the revenues of the Governmnt and the bringing of them under one admin istration and the placing of the new administration, which has been called Ihe General Treasury, uilder a firm regulation unlikely to be broken. Theoo , !1VP hpen divided up and defined in the gracious Proclamation. The^roportions of the divisions have been fixed in the same unchangeable manned Generally speaking, steps to ensure that no mfaction of the decreed 'regulation will be committed have been taken and arrangements have been made with a view to carrying out^the regulation in the most care- Among the improvements referred to is mentioned the revision of the allowances of the various Government Departments and the rediution of certain unnecessary ones in a reasonable proportion, which has resulted in the saving of a considerable amount of money from the original allowances in the general budget of the country. These improvements in general point to the highest goal at which His Maiestv drives and the wise policy by which he directs the endeavours of his Government, keeping pace with the spirit of improvement and the essential development which circumstances necessitate, shall take place gradually and not at such a pace as the Government might not be able to stand. . The action now taken by His Majesty is not the first proof which His Majesty has given of his Islamic sincerity, his Arabic zeal and his devotion to the service of his nation and people, but what he has done now are parts of a series of great improvements which he has undertaken to realise for the service of this country, the reconditioning of its affairs and its restoration to its former dignity and honour. His Majesty has not' only given proof to this effect by his action, but he has also discharged his conscience of his obligations towards his religion and nation, and has given a high example of devotion to the cause of refor mation, zeal for the general interest, and desire for success. May Godl help to success and guide in the right path. Enclosure 3 to S. No. (10). Translation of Extract from “Umm-al-Qura”, No. 364, dated December 4th t 1931 (24-7-1350). The New Budget. A High Decree has been issued sanctioning the budget proposals for the present year, from the 1st Sha’ban 1350 02th December 1931) to the end of Bajab 1351 (29th November 1932). The text of this Decree has been communicated to the authorities concerned, that they may put it into effect as from the 1st Sha’ban next. The officials who have been revised (sic. ? dismissed) will leave their posts, as their work allows, beginning on that date. We learn that the Government, in view of the regulation necessitating the submission of the budgets to the Legislative Council, and in view also of the fact that the Reorganization Committee was appointed temporarily for a temporary task, are considering the transfer of the regulation con cerning the budget and of all the departmental budgets to the above mention ed place (Legislative Council) fom decision and signature in accordance with the regulation.

M.’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 492, dated the 28th December 1931. Since my return to Jedda on December 15th, I have obtain a general view of the economic and financial situation in this country^ Although I can add little to the information already m your possession ^ think it worth while to attempt a comprehensive picture of what I find alter an absence of five months. In drawing it I have not had the advantage of any contact with high Government circles, for, as you , og L1008(C) FA PD ! &gt;|fi; ft! j »[ 1 ' * * &gt;• H remains at Eiadh and most of his advisers have summoned thither, indudine Fuad Bey Hamza, who left Mecca for Nejd almost simultaneous^ with my arrival in Jedda. The only Hejaai personage of any consequent whom i have seen is the rich old Governor of Jedda, who hardly conn s as nnv longer Though still to some extent employed as a consultant 0 “ SrSS he now concerns himself little with the current afiairs of his S office so that his outlook is less that of a Government servant than of a f merchant It is no secret that, as a business man and an important creditor of the Government, he views the situation in the country with anxiety and illconcealed hostility to the present regime. . . 2 It is Generally agreed that the economic position m the country as a whole could hardly be worse. The merchants in Jedda and Mecca have been increasingly embarrassed during the past two years Of late, they have had to cope not only with depression m trade but with Govermnent demands for contributions in money or m kind, extorted ostensibly on loan but without any definite prospect of repayment of the money or payment for the goods. Some carry large stocks (e.g., of rice) owing to over-importation earlier this year and in 1930. Monetary crises elsewhere have created a feelin- of uncertainty, the net result of which is to create further depres sion although there have been passing effects of a contrary kind, e.g., the abandonment of the gold standard by His Majesty s Government and conse quent depreciation of the rupee gave a temporary fillip to the import trade from India. The prices of most imported goods, reckoned in gold, have risen considerably during my absence, though those of local foodstuffs appear to be fairly steady. ' . , . T , 3. I am assured that among the tribes and especially those m the .North 0 f the Heiaz the utmost misery prevails. It is impossible to sift the informa tion but it is said that, what with the reaction of world conditions, manifested more particularly in the greatly reduced pilgrimage, and the demands of the Government for military purposes, there has been a great depletion of livestock. I hear of a reduction in the number of camels and of sheep and goats being sold off at ludicrously small prices. Attention is drawn to the influx of half-starved Beduin into the larger towns, especially perhaps Medina and to the frequent spectacle of hungry tribesmen collecting at the halts on the main road from Jedda to that place. In August I was inclined to doubt the tales of actual starvation, which, it will be remembered, were related by the Hejaz-Nejd Minister in London, among others, harlv in September the Mecca newspaper “Uminj-al-Qura”, a Government inspired oro’an, thought it worth while to contradict a report of famine m the Hejaz which’had been circulated in India, In view of what I now hear, I can no longer disregard the reiterated statements made to me regarding hunger ana incased mortality. To give one example, possibly exaggerated, I am told of Beduin dying in Medina at the rate of 35 a day. 4 There is little or no prospect of relief being afforded by the pilgrimage. Some months ago I thought that the number of overseas pilgrims might attain the 1931 figure of about forty thousand, though it was unlikely to exceed it. The Government have exerted themselves to stimnia the flow by propaganda, including the announcement of reduced charges an an almost firm promise that Pilgrimage Day will fall on a Friday. Mve- theless, it now looks as though the total number of overseas pilgrims may nearer twenty thousand than forty thousand. It is too soon to make denn estimates, as the number of Indians and Egyptians is always to a very short time before the great day, which should fall on or aboiit Ap 15th next year. Up to the present, however, only two thousand five hunar pilgrims have arrived from' the Dutch East Indies, always first in the neia. The Netherlands Legation surmises that this represents about halt the t°; - for the season, which would thus be about five thousand as compared wi about sixteen thousand this year. yT? 5. Hopes are still founded on the possible development of new resources^ the recently discovered or rediscovered water, petroleum and gold. American expert, Mr. Twitchell, followed the procession of high ott E ia 5 Riadh on December 15th. The one concrete result of his efforts so tarK5 been the erection of an undoubtedly fine and happily cheap American wind mill at the Waziria wells some miles Irom Jedda and some quite useful work on the old conduits connecting them with the town. It seems uncertain whether the water is to be used to supply J edda or for agricultural purposes. Of the gold and peti oleum I know nothing new nor have I heard any more of the separate pioposal to employ Swedish experts to investigate the petroleum. 6. I turn to the financial situation of the Government Mr. Hope Gill has kept you very fully informed on this subject m a series of despatches ending with his Ao. 482 of December 13th. [Eclo. 1 to S. No. (10).] I need not therefore go ino the details of the reform schemes which have been so greatly advertised. The general opinion is that, even if revenue prospects were steadier and even if Ibn Sa’ud had men capable of running a rational financial system, the scheme has come too late. The revenue from direct taxation of pilgrims must necessarily diminish. There must be a further decline in customs revenue owing to the failing off of pilgrims and general depression. In his despatch No. 346 of August 29th Mr. Hope Gill gave figures from a well informed source showing that the customs receipts had fallen from nearly £1,200,000 in the lunar year ending about June 8th, 1929 to less than £900,000 in that ending about May, 18th, 1931. One of my more pessimistic informants puts the figure as low as £400,000 this year. This may be an under-estimate but I doubt whether a customs revenue of more than half a million can be counted on for the year ending next May. The customs receipts such as they are might be used as security for a foreign loan but only if the lenders could rely on some more or less independent control being established and on a greater prospect of durability than the Sa’udian regime at present offers. As you are aware the negotiations with the Dutch Bank broke down and there seems to be no longer any likelihood of a loan being obtained from any European source on commercial lines. Contradictory rumours are in circulation regarding the relations between the Government here and Soviet Russia, which might alone engage m tra e or even finance on uneconomic lines. The Russian Minister went on long leave a couple of months ago and may not return, though he is offi cially due back in April. He has been temporarily replaced by a non- Moslem from Leningrad, a man of intelligence and Ig ather s ^ e importance in Soviet circles. This gentleman, Monsieur Horace Salkmd, is very much out for information, but he cannot go m person to Mecca as the Minister used to do. My impression is that Mthough the Ru®iaMhaYe brought off the coup of selling benzine and petroleum on credit and althou there are other Russian goods in the market e.q., mateh^ there is big business doing between the Soviets and the Hejazi Government. 7 The proposal to supplement the reform scheme by employing an EuropeJn aSr still holds the field. I am told that Monsieur Jacote the lianager of die xjutch* a salary of £1 : 000 a yean was 4 j Netherlands Chargfi -*»« i-g a Atlaires tninks J meone to undertake the reorganization of the £* ■». - * “ p ”“ frnm the Kin 0, when he has accomplished his task. 8. Meanwhile the ^'^matlon StoGm budget far as they can d( &gt; s° wifhont a Y ^ x ig to be divided into percentages which has been adopted f floating debt, reserve and extraordinary assigned to ^y^kffnparentlv betterment schemes. The new tadget is expenditure me X p fi rs t dav of the current lunar month *.jo, abou to operate as from the tirst Y ,i b tbe i ar cr e arrears of salaries December 9th. From this.it l^ks as &amp;ough toe ^ practicable arrange . due on that date were to go ^ d t the penury among officials. in the spring and early summer. * Itwin be remembered that early in .the year the Government concentrated its rfforts onTn attempt to maintain the recognised elements in the loca currency at the official rates viz., £ gold 1 ^silver nyals 10=mckel current piastres 220 and that this attempt broke down as regards the gold-silver parity, although silver did not slump quite as badly as might have been expected. In my despatch No. 286 of July 14th, I forwarded a communique defining to some extent the monetary policy on the basis of maintaining the above rates and fixing corresponding rates for other currencies in general use, which were to be still tolerated, including the Maria Theresa dollar and the runee These decisions produced no effect as against market conditions and the division is now mainly of historical interest only. When the United Kingdom went oil the gold standard, the curious position arose that the Heiaz possessed an official gold currency in the shape of English sovereigns side bv side with its own silver. The Hejazi Government were as incapable as most people of understanding the implications of such a situation, much less devising a policy to deal with it. On October 16th they announced a prohibition of the export of gold, except by permission of the Government (see Mr. Hope Gill’s despatch No. 404 of October 19th). It was subsequent- ly announced that the authorities empowered to grant permits or the export of gold were the customs authorities and that detailed uistructions, which I have not seen, would be issued later. I understand that the principle was to allow gold to leave the country only on a guarantee being given that an equivalent quantity of goods would be imported within three months. Apart from this prohibition, the currency situation was allowed to work itself out under the influence of market conditions. For a time, it was possible in certain transactions, for gold and sterling to be treated as equivalent, but this could obviously be neither general nor lasting. Gold tended to become scarce in the local 'market. Sterling and Egyptian notes came into increas ing use. The respective values, as expressed in riyals, adapted themselves more or less to European exchange conditions, gold at a high premium and the various paper issues at rates determined by their relation to sterling with slight local variations resulting presumably from demand, supply and native ideas as to the confidence they might (inspire. At the time of writing the approximate rates in the bazars here are as follows :— £ gold - Riyals 17| £ sterling = Riyals 12^ £ Egyptian = Riyals 13 19 rupees = £1 gold. 10. I can best complete this account of the currency situation by giving a string of isolated facts, not all of which I can interpret, as follows (a) As already stated gold has tended to disappear from the market. This is in part attributed to hoarding. It ds possible that some has been sent to Riadh, where the King is believed by some to be accumulating a reserve of treasure. Gold has also been taken off the market by the Dutch Bank, which for several weeks past has been buying. This Bank normally sends a shipment of gold to Europe after the pilgrimage. Its present policy of buying may be due to a desire on the part of the head office to hold part of their gold reserve in Jedda. Fluid gold is required for various local purposes and the depletion has been sufficiently marked to produce a recent enquiry by a firm here for a quotation for gold sovereigns from abroad delivered in Jedda. (b) The Soviet Legation here has been selling sterling notes in considerable quantities. The origin of the notes and the object of the Legation are obscure. Fears have been expressed lest the notes should not be all genuine, but I have not heard it seriously suggested so far that any of the notes here have been forged..arket Ntwerea^ chsit th the? emits for | !f r instaetms.r' i as «Si , adapted te a hi^li pnii relatioato i demand, siffl t the time of i :jsr ret, as ituatioalfl earl It isposf Kk is ^ isure. ch I This a desire® 1 old reserve il t 17 sS* B “ r aK t ti A/T ^ Asir, though it was not hoped to ou^t the Ma,ria Theresa dollar at a stroke. This policy has been pursued by introducing riyals into Nejd for use in out payments, e.g., it was said that Ibn Sa’ud intended to give his largesse to the, tribes this year in Hejazi silver, and a plan was apparently devised for creating in Nejd a net-work of stalls to retail goods bought or borrowed in the Hejazi towns, the transactions to be effected in riyals only. The latter part of the plan is said to have been defeated by local Nejdi opposition with the result that the goods had to* be stored or sold whole sale. Riyals, though put into circulation in Nejd, are very unpopular there, partly because the merchants complain that they are no use to them in Kowait and Bahrain. Their gold value in Nejd is consequently much lower than in the Hejaz, though information as to the actual rates are conflicting. One informant, the pessimist, says that they went some little time ago as low as thirty to the £, with the result, he adds, that the King in his anger confiscated the good of twelve Riadh merchants and closed down their shops. (d) The Government have stultified their previous policy of trying to keep riyals at 10 to the £ gold by their own recent attitude. ,Where possible they pay them out at that rate but they accept them only at their market value in gold. This is perhaps reasonable in the case of telegraph charges, having regard to the necessity for providing for external settlements. The same rule is, however, applied in other cases, notably that of customs duty. Unfortunately for the financial authorities they have not been able to carry to its logical conclusion their plan of having it both ways i.e., paying at 10 and collecting at gold rate. In order to clear off debts to certain commercial houses, they have had to agree to take only a portion of the duty on new imports in cash and to allow the remainder to be written oh against the debts. Some at least of the com- mercdal houses, e.g., Messrs Gellatly, Hankey and . Company have successfully asserted the principle that, for this purpose, the writing oh .should be on the basis of £ .gold to £ gold, instead of at the customs rate for riyals, which fluctuates round the fluctuating market rate. (e) A curious transaction came to my notice accidentally at Fort Sudan. I found that the Hejazi postal authorities had clear ed oh their debt to the Eastern Telegraph Company up to last May and had subsequently made a single payment which was understood to be on account of the June account. Ims took the form of a cheque in sterling drawn by Credit Lyonnais, Paris on Credit Lyonnais, London on Octohcr -6t last to the order of the Director General of Posts and Tele graphs and endorsed by the latter at Mecca on December _ to the Eastern Telegraph Company. I am at a toss to unde^ stand how this cheque was bought and can only surmi* that it may have something to do with ‘Abdurrahman Qusar i activities in Europe. 11.

His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda presents his compliments to Foreign Secretary to Government of India, and has the honour to transmit the Name and date. Subject. To Fortign Office, London, No. 493 of 29th December 1931. Local Government, Internal Situation. London. End. to S. No. (12) Despatch from H. M.’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 493, DATED THE 29TH DECEMBER 1931. I have attempted in my despatch No. 492, of 28th December, [Enel, tc S. No. (11)], to give a general view of the economic and financial situation in this country. I have now the honour to submit some account of the political situation and the conjectures to which it gives rise in connexion with Ibn Sa’fid’s foreign policy. The data are meagre and I am even more hampered in this case than in my endeavour to sum up the economic situation by the fact that I have had no real contact with the Hejazi Government since my return to Jedda on December 15th. I should indeed reserve this report for a later occasion, were it not for its bearing on the possibility of trouble on the Northern frontiers of the Hejaz. 2. When Ibn Sa’fid went to Riadh about the beginning of July he was completely “fed up” with the Hejaz and its problems. He doubtless felt, moreover, that the affairs of Nejd required his personal attention. It was significant that before going there he made one spectacular gesture designed to placate extreme Wahhabi opinion by deferring to the opinion of the Ulema of Nejd on the impropriety of celebrating annually his acces sion to the Hejazi throne. At the same time he gave another indication of a swing towards the extremists by reviving the machinery for the en forcement of strict religious principles. He did not abandon his schemes for certain improvements on European lines to which fanatics might take exception like the wireless project. Nevertheless in the published record of the proceedings of the “National Conference” held in June stress was laid on the principle that economic development should be effected by the instru mentality of Moslems; and the King would not allow the Marconi expert, Mr. Boucicault, to go to Riadh to erect the wireless station there. 3. While the King, on the eve qf his departure for Nejd, was thus showing himself not only a good Moslem, but a good Wahhabi, he had not despaired of European assistance. In his June conversations with me he made a strong appeal for a good understanding on all subjects with Great Britain, with special reference to his hope of getting His Majesty’s Goverm ment to give their patronage to himself rather than to the Hashimites and19 the feasibility of inducing a British bank to give him financial assisf.mpp barters alS the Wmd other “an quarters also, notably m Holland. He engaged m dealing with Bolsheviks representative bu there is nothing as yet to show that he was prepared to give much more to the Soviets than the privilege of suppl y in^ him with STrade mS ^ P0SSib ^ SOme Nation of the resfrictions on - situation in the Hejaz, bad in June, has grown much worse since then, lha towns have every reason for discontent the tribes for dis affection. n °k possible to speak with equal confidence of Neid but it is rumoured that there also there is much dissatisfaction. Apart from the usual tales of trouble with tribes, there are specific allegations of discontent owing to oppressive taxation, non-payment o.f the wages of Neidi soldier- employed m the neighbourhood of the frontier, e.g., at Tabuk, levies in kind on merchants, attempts to impose the use of the unpopular Heiazi riyal and the reforms instituted in Hasa by the mission of At-Tawil. 5. Such is the internal situation with which Ibn Sa’ud has to cope, as he sits tight at Riadh, attempting to deal with the affairs of the Hejaz from a distance with the aid of the advisers summoned in turn to the Nefdi capital; uncertain perhaps of his hold on the Nejd itself, a country which he can only rule with a strong hand and largess and*the population of which are so little impressed by kingly majesty in itself that they are said still to use in speaking to him the address “Ya, ’Abdul 5 Aziz!”. The King must realize by now that there is little chance of money from Europe or of the kind of positive support from Great Britain for which he begged in June,— no British Bank, no air force, no backing in his latent struggle with the Hashimites. Over all lies the shadow of a pilgrimage much smaller than that of last year and worse times to come in consequence. 6. It cannot be wondered at that some observers expect the King to seek salvation in one or both of two things, adventure over the border or an agreement with the Soviets. He has engaged in military preparations, as he is always doing. The tribes, it is said, have been encouraged to hope or threatened with the necessity of preparing for Jihad, For a time it was thought that the objective wns the Yemen but since my return it has been announced that the King has composed his difference with the Imam in a spirit of piety and love of peace in Arabia. The observers whom I have just mentioned are all the more disposed to think that he is preparing an onslaught on Trans-Jordan, with the object of gratifying his mingled hatred and fear of the Amir ’Abdullah and gaining access perhaps to richer lands than his own. I cannot myself believe that he would be so foolish as to engage openly in an enterprise, which would bring him into direct conflict with His Majesty’s Government, but the possibility cannot be dismissed in the case of a man. strong willed and ambitious, who is already in hard 1 straits and may be desperate in a few months. There is the alternative possibility of the same object benig pursued less openly by the promotion ol authorised raids. ! 7. Assuming for the sake of hypothesis that Ibn Sarid has some such object in view, three questions, among many others, call for special consi deration. What financial resources could he employ for the purposes ot his adventure ? What is the extent of the reported military preparations ? On what outside assistance or sympathy could he rely, from the Soviets or otherwise? I will glance at these in order. 8. No one knows what reserve the King had at Riadh, despite the impoverishment of the country and the Hejazi Treasury. t as een suggested that he has been collecting treasure there, perhaps not gold or not all gold, but in other forms, e.g., riyals or jewellery. War taxes ^ S a.d to have been levied on the Hejazi tribes and on the ^l nsf ^ k ’- tf j‘ riyals a head it is said from the tribesmen, four hundred thousand riyals from those in the area round Taif and further sums from f .Lj,. According to one account the latter represente o . , V. . miserable poverty and offered men with riding c y De s , .•i i offer which the Amir undertook to refer to the King hut which the la.20 was thought unlikely to accept owing to h is lack of ^confidence in the Hejazi tribesmen. Another tale is that the merchants of ’ Anaiza and Buraida are owed sixty-thousand pounds and have little chance of payment, though eight of them made their way to Mecca to ventilate their grievance, despite the efforts of the Governor of Medina to prevent them from getting further than that place. I cannot pronounce on the probability or otherwise of the King having collected any substantial licpiid reserve at Riadh by the alleged £ exactions and other means, but Mr. Hope Gill, who has followed deveiop- ments during my absence, especially Sheykh ’Abdullah Suleyman’s financial policy, believes in it. 9. As regards the extent of the King’s military preparations, I can again rely only on distorted rumours and a few items of fact. He has of course his garrisons on the frontier and in certain places not far from it and he could obtain men from Nejd for a definite enterprise promising warfare and loot. Such troops as there were in Jedda would appear to have been moved to Mecca almost in their entirety. I see in a report from the Political Agent at Bahrain dated November 23, that an informant newly arrived from the main land had noted an unsual withdrawal of horsemen towards Nejd and supposed that they might be intended for an attack on Yemen. I quote with great reserve a report which has reached me here that the Polish engineer employed in the Government workshop at Mecca has been sent to recruit airmen in Poland. A good deal has been spent during the last year or more on military supplies. It is now said that twenty-four thousand rifles have been repaired in the Mecca workshops, that there were recently four thousand in hand which the mechanics were being pressed to repair without delay and that further rifles were expected to be brought from the interior for the same purpose. It is also said that the Soviet representative has been offering rifles with one thousand two hundred cartridges each at two pounds ten shillings per rifle, c.i.f. Whether this be true or not, my informant, the Indian Vice-Consul, says that a friend of his who went some little time ago to the Soviet Legation to buy sterling chanced on one of the A1 Fadhl family and other Nejdis engaged in inspecting various kinds of rifle, 10. The third question need not be dealt with at length. My Russian colleague here has always struck me as more interested in commerce than in politics and I see nothing in his burst of activity last summer or its result up to date to make me alter that opinion. I can see the Soviets selling rifles or anything else to Ibn Sa’ud on cheap and easy terms but not at the present time backing him in a foreign adventure otherwise than by perhaps looking on generally at any attempt he might make to fish in trouled waters. I discard as fantastic a further suggestion by my principal informant that Russia might, in an endeavour to compass the destruction of the British position in the Mid-East, draw Ibn Sa’ud into a general alliance comprising Turkey and Persia. I feel that, if Ibn Sa’ud contemplates further adventure, he would work as he has always done on his own expansive lines, a raider in the grand condottiere manner. There may be more to be said for sugges tions that he has sought to gain Islamic sympathy through agents in countries like Trans-Jordan, the Yemen and Hadhramaut, perhaps even further afield. i ' 11. This is not intended to be an alarmist despatch. I am only too conscious that the basis of ascertained fact on which; I have built is very slender. In my attempt to produce a balanced superstructure I may have given it too formidable an appearance. While writing I have had before me the extremely interesting paper by Major Fowle enclosed in Mr. Walton’s letter to Mr. Rendel of November 18. It will be seen that, though Major Fowle pays me too great a compliment in suggesting that I know more about Tbn Sa ud than anyone else, my mind has been working on the same general lines as his. There is this difference that looking at the King in the light of the most recent events, I suspect that the test of his success may come before he disappears from the scene and I conceive tentatively the possibility of Ibn Sa’ud himself, rather than his successor, being driven to the course suggested in paragraph 10 (b) of Major Fowle’s memorandum, that of launching ’Wahhabi attacks on the surrounding unbelievers.t onfide; Wi 1Za ^L % or ■ a!1 mwhi f y Qs fact, |'.' )nse ^ a Ppeartii i in a iat an ended for s : h lias read Trade, the Secretary to P the^Governmen^of j he ,P e P artme nt of Overseas Political Department, His Maiestv’s TTio-h c JK, ; a 111 the Foreign and and 'Iraq, and the WcKs^nflf (13) {ReceM on mk 'r^At h £%%z zr y ' s lemr N °- p 2 - Enclosure in Colonial 0ffi “ letter No. 89213/31, dated 22nd Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to H m ’ c tv/Tt Jedda, No. 263, dated tee 18th December 19^1 M NISTER!

No. (17)., Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda v to the Foreign Office, No. 36, DATED THE 21ST JANUARY 1932. With reference to my despatch No. 492 of December 28, [Enclo. to S, No. (11)], I have the honour to state that the Umm-al-Qura of January E, published the text of what purports to be a budget for the lunar year begin ning Sha’ban 1,1350, i.e., December 11, 1931. I enclose a translation of the finance law and attached statement, as published. It will be observed that there is a discrepancy of Piastres miri 486,458 between the items and the total shown. 2. 1 he publication of this enactment must be regarded as a distinct advance, The budget is nevertheless merely an estimate of expenditure under various heads. It is assumed that revenue will be available to meet this expenditure but no attempt is made to estimate the anticipated revenue from various sources. It is not stated whether the budget applies to the Hejaz or to the whole of Ibn Sa’fid’s dominions. 3. I had some conversation regarding the budget with Fuad Bey Hamza on January 19, when I was discussing the position in regard to certain British claims. I congratulated him on the step forward made by his Government I observed that, while the amount ear-marked for the payment of debts did m lC amount ( - ^finite sm c reiors #pay I11( [ fuad realty a gr jfadiof the jnsilver.

U a lent of C feign a Baghdad iDot appear to be 25 of the U&gt;tal } as we had been led to expect, it was never theless a substantial sum, viz., £ gold 150,000 on the assumption that Piastres Min meant gold piastres at the rate of 110 to the £ gold. He had told me incidentally the previous evening that the Government knew exactly the amount of their liabilities up to the beginning of the financial year. 1 suggested that as they were in this happy position and had now ear-marked a definite sum, which they presumably knew would be available, for paying off the debts, they should be in a position to give concrete indications to their creditors of the instalments which they intended to pay and the dates on which payment might be expected. 4. Fuad Bey explained that the amount ear-marked for debts bore in reality a greater proportion to anticipated receipts than would appear. Much of the expenditure shown in “Piastres Miri” would in fact be incurred in silver. Otherwise, he admitted, the budget would not balance at all. The 16,500,000 piastres miri allocated to debt were, however, gold piastres as I had supposed. I refrained from comment on the singularity of a budget which lumps Piastres Miri whether gold or silver in a single statement, at a time when the Government have practically abandoned the pretence that silver riyals are still at the old legal parity of 10 to the £ gold. 5. Fuad Bey seemed to have no illusions as to the uncertainty of the re venue prospects. I was mainly concerned with the operation of the morato rium implied in the decision to treat all debts up to the beginning of the finan cial year as a floating debt to be paid off by instalments. When I pursued this topic, he told me quite cheerfully that, if things went badly, the Government would be unable to pay and would have to go on from one moratorium to another. He suggested that after all, if money did not come in, it would be owing to causes for which the Government had no responsibility, meaning no doubt that revenue must depend on the volume of the pilgrimage, which would be determined by causes beyond the control of the Government. 6. There is much to be said for Fuad Bey’s point of view, despite its apparent levity. I fear, however, that the publication of this so-called budget, although interesting as an indication of the wish of the Government to put their house in order, will have little effect on the practical finance of this country for the coming year. 7.

Having seen in recent intelligence reports forwarded to this post from Bushire, what appeared to be a more trustworthy account of Sheykh Feysal’s death in October last, I asked Fuad Bey Hamza on January 22nd whether the news was true. Fuad Bey confirmed it saying that he himself had heard it during his recent stay at Riada and that he had intended to mention the matter to me. He added that Sheykh Feysal had died of an internal dis order in the nature of dysentery. He thought that the death had occurred early in November but was vague on this point. 2. 1 am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, His Majesty’s High Commissioners at Baghdad and Jerusalem, and His Majesty’s Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

On the 12th proceeded into Kameran. f r Various games were played against' local teams. , IThe Resident, Captain Wickham was ill, an£ at one moment it appeared that it might become necessary to embark him for passage to hospital at Aden, there being no adequate nursing facilities at Kameran, fortunately he took a turn for the better. # Sailed on patrol 16-30, 16th November, and ship had -just cleared the Kameran passage when a signal was received from Aden stating that a plane had made a forced landing 25 miles North of Moka, and askeu “Uahiia” to proceed and render salvage assistance. Owing to strong head wind ship did not arrive at position indicated (Lat. 13. 39 N) till 09-30 on the 17th when coast was closed (on a weather shore) to await arrival of seaplane which Aden had informed me would be sent to indicate the position of stranded plane. A Moth plane, however, was seen to land some 4 miles away, and the stranded plane was then made out to be 1^ miles inland., The First Lieutenant and an armed working party was landed over fringing reef, and ship moved to abreast of plane, and as near the reef as was safe. By the time communication with plane was established, wind had veered 5 points and increased in force, finally reaching a moderate gale all the after noon and first dog, and the return of boat from shore became quite imprac ticable. In view of the uncertainty as to the attitude of Natives (as a matter of fact they proved most friendly, though this could not be foreseen) I was loath to put to sea until absolutely obliged to do so, as I knew that any untoward event was highly improbable while ship remained in the vicinity. The holding ground proved better than expected and ship rode out the gale, though the position on a lee shore, with a party away, left a good deal to be desired. Fortunately the weather moderated in last dog, and the party was re- embarked about 21-00, as the Air men were satisfied as to the situation. Incidentally, during the next three nights the wind did not moderate sufficiently for a party to have got off at all. I remained at anchor that night. Spare parts arrived from Aden the next morning, and. an hour later both planes took off. Ship then proceeded on patrol, passing H.M.S. ‘'Vindictive” shortly afterwards. I count it a most fortunate circumstance, that on the first occasion of a plane making a forced landing in the Yemen, a Man of War should have been in the vicinity. There is no doubt that the effect on the attitude o Natives in the future will be excellent, as they will expect a ship to again very strong all this is the case. * Sailed on more the next. * # the 23rd, and two dhows were overhauled this day, and two # * to him the undermentioned documents.28 description of Enclosure.

M.’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 16, DATED THE 12th JANUARY 1932. With reference to Mr. Hope Gill’s telegram No. 248, of December 11, [S. No, (3)], I have the honour to state that Fuad Bey Hamza left Riadh on January 2, and reached Mecca on January 5. He came to Jedda on the evening of January 7, and was followed next day by the Amir Feysal, who still combines the functions of Minister for Foreign Affairs with those of Viceroy of the Hejaz. As this is the first time since my return to Jedda nearly a month ago that I have had effective contract with the Ministn otherwise than by letter or telephone, I take the opportunity of mentioning one or two matters bearing on the general situation of diplomatic repre sentatives here. 2. The reorganisation of the arrangements for dealing with foreign affairs, effected on paper in December 1930, continues to be of no practical effect. So far as any handling of them with foreign representatives is concerned, the Amir Feysal is still a figurehead. The Jedda branch of the Ministry has been transferred to a small house not far from my chancery, where it is miserably accommodated but more independent than when Fuad Bev occupied the top flat of a building rented by a firm of shipping agents. The branch still functions only when Fuad Bey himself visits Jedda.' The staff of the Ministry as a 1 whole has been reduced even below the low level attained a year ago. In fact the only subordinate discharging anv duties of more than clerical importance would appear to be Fuad Bey’s brother. Tawfiq Bey Flamza. 3 Since his arrival in Jedda on January, 8, the Amir Feysal has made no oretenee of living un to his title of Minister for Foreign Affairs. I have had only one business interview so far and that was with Fuad Bey yester day afternoon. I will report certain portions of our conversation as occa sion requires, when writing to you about the particular cases we discussed.29 4. The Amir Feysal honoured my wife and me with his company at dinner last evening. As I am temporarily doyen of the foreign representa Uves, we took the opportunity of asking all of Lm oocupying^iplomatic or career consular posts to meet him. All accepted save my French colleague who was souffrant —sutfermg, I believe fnd trust, from nothing worse than a growing agoraphobia. The dinner was something of a novelty in the official life of Jedda. It passed off successfully, even though its lead ing feature was decorum rather than brilliancy. Mis Royal Highness was as frail looking and listless as usual and he has little conversation for such occasions. He bore himself, however, with grace and dignity and seemed languid y P cased. At the small reception which followed, he took a hand at Corinthian bagatelle, recognising, I hope, that it is more a game of skill than of chance and therefore not forbidden by Islamic law. 5. The representatives are to be entertained at dinner this evening at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The Amir is to be present but the dinner is being given by Fuad Bey. The latter was flattering enough to ask my cook, without reference to my wife or me, to do the dinner for him. The somewhat delicate direct negotiations between them broke down. i (23) (Received on 21st February 1932, with Political Secretary's letter No. P. Z.-5 f dated Mh February 1932.)

In my despatch No. 13 of January 12th 1931 (on F. No. 4-N./31), I had the honour to describe the celebration a year ago of Ibn Sa’ud’s acces sion to the throne of the Hejaz. In reports on the general situation sent later on in the vear 1 referred to the remonstrance addressed by the Ulama of Nejd to His Majesty regarding the impropriety of such annual celebrations and the King’s reply deferring to their judgment. The publicity given to this correspondence in the “Umm-al-Qura” newspaper of June 26th was the most striking of various indications at that time of Ibn Sa’ud’s desire to placate extreme Wahhabi opinion. It was arguable that it was merely a political move made in view of his impending departure for Nejd and the importance of rallying loyal sentiment then at a time of trouble in the Hejaz. ' 2. The King has not quite lived up to his professions to the Ulama, for his accession was again celebrated this year on January 8th. The final decision apparently was to hold no celebration in Mecca as being a religious centre and to curtail the ceremonial in Jedda. In the latter place the school children were as before well coached in their singing. On the morn ing of the day they sang through the town accompanied by the motley proces sion of loyal maiiifestants. The Governor of Jedda, held a reception for the foreign representatives in the forenoon. In the afternoon we and others were bidden to a tea-party at the Green Palace, organized by e local celebration Committee and attended bv the Amir Fevsal who arrived from Mecca shortlv before the party.

The Resident is in India in connection with Round Table Conference business and is expected back on 9th December.

Visits to Mokalla, Ras-el-Kalb and Bir Ali, where it had been proposed that the Senior Officer, Red Sea sloops, in “Penzance”, should call during passage from Muscat to Aden, will therefore be postponed pending further discussion with the Resident himself.

The call was unofficial. It will he returned officially when “Penzance” arrives at Aden from Muscat.

He explained that King Ibn Saud was anxious to stabrnse his currency and to set the finances of his country on a firm basis His. Majesty therefore desired to establish a State Bank, and was most anxious to secure the services of a British bank for this purpose. He had a ^ 0r u ln f 1 - y send a representative to England to interview suit able banking firms, and the representative selected, Mr. Abdur Rahman Qusaibi, was arriving in London that morning. 2. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba was informed that Sir Andrew Ryan had already reported King Ibn Saud’s request for the assistance of His Majesty’s Govt, in this matter, and that the necessary instructions had already been telegraphed to Sir A. Ryan with regard to the reply to be returned to His Majesty s enquiry. In that telegram, Sir A. Ryan had been instructed to explain that, whilst His Majesty’s Government fully appreciated and sympathised with the financial difficulties of the Hejazi Government, it was impossible for them to depart from their long established practice of non intervention in transactions between foreign governments and British banks. In any case in England, unlike certain other countries, the banks were wholly independent bodies, whose decisionis His Majesty’s Government were not in a position to influence. The banks would therefore reach a decision on any proposition which might be put before them on its commer cial merits and not on political grounds. In these circumstances. His Majesty’s Government had suggested that King Ibn Saud should appoint a representative in London to explore the matter with the banks direct. It appeared, from what Sheikh Hafiz Wahba had said, that the King had already anticipated this advice. 3. The Sheikh stated that he recognised the inability of His Majesty’s Government to intervene with British banks, as explained above, but hinted that King Ibn Saud would be prepared to offer very substantial commercial concessions to any bank willing to consider the business. He^ also explain ed that while the King personally, and he himself, were eager to put any business in British hands, the Russians were making efforts to establish themselves commercially in the Hejaz and interested persons were trying to persuade the King to deal with them. 4. The Minister was informed in reply that His Majesty’s Government were aware that the Russians had been selling goods in parts of Arabia at a very low price. If they attempted to do this in the Hejaz it would not be possible for this country to compete with them, as British trade was in private hands and was run on a commerial basis. It was of course entirely for King Ibn Saud to decide whether or not he should encourage Russian activities in his dominions. 5. As a result of this conversation, it was arranged that Mr. Zade of the Hejazi Legation and Mr. Abdur Rahman Qusaibi should discuss the position at the Department of Overseas Trade on the 23rd July with mem bers of that department. They then stated to the representatives of department that they were already in touch with the Eastern Bank w r it which Mr. Abdur Rahman Qusaibi had had commercial dealings at Bahrein.

They w ,nld be dad if the Ottoman Bank could be informed that the Department of° Overseas Trade were fully cognisant of the project. 6 Mr Zade was informed that the Department of Overseas Trade had been in touch with Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), who had large resources, and were already represented by branches in Egypt and the Sudan and he was given a letter of introduction to this bank. It was however explained to the Hejazi representatives that there were relatively few banks with experience of their part of the world, and that it was pro bably undesirable from their point of view to discuss the matter with more than at the outside, two or three banks, as otherwise there might be a danger that none would be inclined to give their proposals serious consi deration. 7 'pj^g Department of Overseas Trade have since approached the Otto man Bank, as requested by Mr. Zade, and have been informed that the Hejazi Government’s proposals are under consideration. 8 . The Hejazi Minister has expressed his appreciation of the assist, a nee rendered to him in this connexion. (Received on 6th September 1931, ivith Political Secretary's letter No. P. dated 20th August 1931.) Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 291, DATED THE 10TH JULY 1931. I have the honour to state that I received your telegram No. 113 of July 14th [S. No. (76)], relative to the possibility of a British bank estab lishing itself in the Hejaz, just before an interview with Fuad Bey Hamza, who came down from Mecca for the inside of the day on July 13th. I seized the opportunity of reading the first paragraph of your telegram to Fuad Bey, who manifested no surprise or disappointment. 2. In view of the first sentence of the second paragraph of your tele gram, I told Fuad Bey as from myself that, while I did not exclude the pos sibility of the Hejazi Government enlisting the interest of a British bank, I could not honestly encourage them to hope for much in that direction. I let fall the various names I had heard mentioned in connection with pos sible arrangements with bankers (See paragraphs 6 and 7 of my despatch No. 253 of July 1 st); but Fuad Bey was not to be drawn. 3. I thought it inadvisable to suggest consultation with Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., Ltd., as regards the choice of a person to act for the Hejazi Government in the City. That firm has extensive and pecu liar relations with the Hejazi Government and are themselves engaged w banking here on a fairly important scale. Their position vis-d-vis of the Government is so variable that any reference I might make to them in this connection would almost certainly be misunderstood, either as an encourage ment to hope that the firm might themselves come, to the help of the Gov ernment, which they are not prepared to do except on the most moderate scale, or as an attempt on my part to ram them down the throats of the Gov ernment. 4. As an illustration of the singular way in which all such matters are approached here, I may mention that on July 8 th, Fuad Bey asked me at the instance of the Director General of Finance to use my influence with Messrs. Gellatly Hankey and Company in favour of an arrangement where by they would provide money for the specific purpose of maintaining the i( l tW t he ha .flStui* 1 (lliscote 3 I was D r* M(S Jill bllSlN jffarner. 1 fitment w gpting that Gellat ille import ilk as I k for £U |{ii ) ama I i® outstand Isas able to 1 a sat Hi&amp;Maji if Secretary69 Hejazi representative missions abroad. The Director General was pre pared to give security apparently by depositing local silver currency—and to promise that the business would be perfectly safe. I asked why Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman did not go to Messrs. Geilatly Hankey and Company himself, adding that I understood they were on the best of terms. Fuad Bey said that he thought they were no longer on such good terms as formerly. Anyhow, he had been asked to pass on the message and was doing so; but he was careful to add in fairly clear language that he would prefer not to back his colleague’s word. 5. I was naturally not very eager to intervene, least of all with a view to urging Messrs. Geilatly Hankey and Company to involve themselves in unsound business. I promised, however, to speak to the manager, Mr. A. J. Warner. When I did so three days later, I found that he had an appointment with Abdullah Suleiman himself for that afternoon and was expecting that Director General to talk Biggish Business, e.g. y to see what Messrs. Geilatly Hankey and Company would do in return for a monopoly of the importation of benzine and petroleum. The upshot of the whole thing, as I learnt later from Mr. Warner, was that Abdullah Suleiman asked for £1,500 to cover one month’s expenditure on the missions abroad and promised to pay interest on the sums already due by the Government to the firm, a matter of £6,000 to £7,000. Mr. Warner is quite happy about these outstandings and thought his firm would run to the extra £1,500. I was able to telephone to Fuad Bey that I understood the Director General had had a satisfactory interview with Messrs.. Geilatly Hankey and Com pany’s Manager and I left it at that.

Although I suspect that the picture is somewhat overdrawn, what I learn from other sources confirms the main fact that the Hejaz is being made to feel the Nejdi yoke more heavily than before, probably as a counterpoise to Ibn Sa’ud’s long absence in Nejd. The Hejazis are becom ing more and more embittered and their talk is increasingly of revolution, but they are not the stuff of which revolutionaries are made. In Munshi Ihammullah’s words, with great restraint they have checked themselves, as they have none at their back. 3.

C, H. G, ‘ i 19th March 1931.,71 Enel, 2 to S. No. (85). H. M. Charge d’affaires, i Durmg my last visit to Mecca I noticed a great change amono- the people there. Since the abolition of the Religious Committee, they eiS personal reedom to a great extent. The tyranny of the infernal Neidi soldiers was gradually becoming a dream in the public life and passing into dark oblivion. The only discontent prevailing among them was the General grievance bound up with the life of a public body. The effect of the world! wide depression told heavily upon them and it was further magnified bv the imposition o heavier taxes upon the pilgrims and the consequent decrease m their number, which ultimately affected the market and deprived the people ot their income, inasmuch as every one in Mocca directly or indirectly has to depend upon the pilgrims for their means of subsistence. The people placed in such financial difficulties could not but resent the exploitation of the Hejaz money in Nejd. This menacing economic problem confronted the people with an ordeal which absorbed all their attention. At this critical stage in the life of the nation, King Ibn Sa’ud instead of sympathis ing with his subjects and devising means for the amelioration of their condi tion, wantonly injured their feelings by ordering the revival of the defunct Religious Committee. 2. This Committee has re-appeared with greater powers for evil. In the past, the ofienders were given a chance to appear before a body of not ables, among whom there were one or two citizens who had the natural in clination to be lenient and sympathetic towards their fellow-citizens in crime; the well-to-do persons were also treated properly and tried in camera. But now the Committee is different from that in the past. It has been given summary powers and it has brought in its train considerably large numbers of Nejdi soldiers employed in its service. There are 20 Nejdi soldiers on behalf of the Religious Committee in each Hara (quarter), thus their total number within the municipal jurisdiction of Mecca is 260, which is even greater than the military force kept at the Jedda Garrison. The cruelty and avarice of the Nejdi soldiers are well-known and need no recapitulation. The presence of such a large number of the inhuman and unsympathetic element m each Hara of Mecca has naturally created a terror in the heart’s of the public. These brutes being let loose are perpetrating all sorts of cruelties and harassing the people simply to satisfy their Brutal nafure. There is no law to restrain them. They move like tyrants of folk-lore and as sume the air of an autocrat who is above law and order. Especially on the occasion of the five-times-a-day prayer, these incarnations of the civil wildly run through the public thorough-fares and enter the lanes and bye-lanes in pursuit of the defaulters who might have taken shelter there, and on dis covery fall upon them with all their might and beat them mercilessly. There is no distinction between good or bad, rich or poor, young or old, and even school boys of minor age are not spared. They lay them down on the public road and flog them indiscriminately. _ Any one having a spark of humanity in him cannot bear the scene of such inhuman perpetrations on the helpless citizens. If any unfortunate has the audacity to advance argu ments or oppose, his days may be numbered or he may be required to go to the hospital to dress his wounds sustained at the hands of these brutes of religion. 3. I happened to see the condition once with my own eyes. Just before prayer, I drove in a car to the remoter quarter of the city and found t e se hungry dogs more active there than in the adjoining quarters o e o y Harem, in the pursuit of their infernal perpetrations; and: I was able to realise the truth of the general complaints of the people. 4. Tobacco on which the Wahhabi Government impose he^vy customs autv, is the cause of another trouble, from, which both the shop-keepers and their customers suffer considerably. Whenever they are detected in carrying on transactions on this “Forbidden” article, they fa 1 a victim to he Nejd. wrath and indignity. It is difficult to fathom the Wahhabi lo D ic and L632(C) F&amp;PD72 account for their peculiar principle. It is curious to note that while the puritan Wahhibi Government have not made any legislation to prohibit the entry of tobacco into the Hejaz, rather on the other hand, they do not hesi tate to profit their revenues from the taxes imposed on it, they allow the people engaged in lawful transaction to suffer insult and disgrace. 5 The unrestricted tyranny and persecution all through, combined with the miserable condition of the people, have naturally moved the hearts of even those who are the best friends and well-wishers of the Government. The citizens are tired, their patiencs has exceeded the limit, but helpless as they are, they cannot overthrow the Wahhabi yoke. But history seems to have repeated itself and the weak have adopted against the oppressor the same old policy of starting secret activities. I happened to see a copy of the leaflets which are being distributed secretly amongst the citizens. I managed to get a copy of one, which I attach herewith for your perusal The worried people have taken to this course in order to satisfy the burning desire of their heart. This is a sort of propaganda, saying to the people that the days of agonies and troubles are numbered and that the nation will heave a sigh of relief to find the new Government established in Rajab (November-December) of this year. These leaflets originated at Mecca, have now reached Jedda and in no time may reach the interior. 6. I had some discourse with a city notable who related to me the pain ful stories of the hardships and miseries to which the Hejazis have been put and under which they are groaning and dragging their miserable exis tence. He said that the discontent of the people has reached its zenith and all the Hejazis, whether citizen or Beduin, are greatly agitated and any small spark may bring about a great conflagration. With great restraint they have checked themselves, as they have none at their back; and that if they get the slightest hope of assistance from any quarter, the regime of Ibn Sa’ud in the Hejaz will end instantaneously. I advised the gentleman not to think of revolutions as it will prove fatal to all. It will not bring about any useful result but will injure their cause. It is a suicidal policy and the whole nation will suffer immensely from its consequence. He concurred with my views, but added that Ibn Sa’ud has given a fresh impetus to the anti-Saudi organisation by reviving the Religious Committee, and this may ultimately result in the opening of negotiations between the discontented Heiazis at home and Ibn Sa’ud’s enemies abroad.

They also confirmed that it was necessary to go to Assab for a fishing permit, and that these regulations had been in force for two years. 12.

In one a email boy about 7 years old was found, who did not appear in the list of passengers. He was claimed as a brother by one of the crew. Being under the impression that slaves were generally castrated, I had him examined by the Surgeon Lieutenant to see whether he was entire. As this proved to be the case and he also appeared to be of the Arabic type,I released the dhow.

Reference was made b ^ ad f/^but this has not so describing in detail nine named wells in W adi r aum far been published.2 The second instalment of what I will call for convenience Report No. I, deals with various water points in the Jedda-Wadi Fatima area other than those in the Wadi Umm-as-Salam and Wadi Fatima itself. I do not think it necessary to reproduce its contents in detail but it presents certain features of general interest as follows:— (a) All the wells described would appear to be in the region round about Jedda and Bahra. In some cases Mr. Twitchell found fresh water; in other brachish. He emphasises the plentifulness of the water in certain places and suggests means whereby it might be dammed underground and raised from compara tively close to the earth’s surface by simple pumping apparatus worked mainly by windmills. (b) Mr Twitchell suggests that the water at Waziria, 11'5 kilometres South-East of Jedda, might be used not only agriculturally but also to supply the town of Jedda with good water, prefer able to that provided by the present sea-water condensers and more plentiful. His idea would appear to be that this water should be transported in tanks by motor lorry. He illustrates his point as to the copiousness of the supply by a mathematical calculation, which is unfortunately unintelligible as reproduc ed in the Umm-al-Qura but appears to arrive at the result that the supply from Waziria might be put at the equivalent, of 83 gallons per minute or more than double the estimated output of the condensers. 3. Nothing further appeared in the Umm-al-Qura until July 10th, when it brought out what appears to be the first instalment of a second report (which I will call Report No. II) dealing with a survey carried out by Mr. Twitchell between April 6th and May 13th in the coastal region to the North. He states that he travelled something over 1,000 miles and he submits his results under the headings of— (1) Water and cultivation; {2) Mines, including A, alluvial deposits; B, mines in hard rock; and C, petroleum. 1 (3) Roads or “passes.” 4. The portion of the Report No. II published on July 10th covers the first of the above headings Water and cultivation. The area visited is stated to have comprised the region along a sea-board of about 500 miles, to a depth inland of about 35 miles. Mr. Twitchell concludes from the nature of the existing vegetation that abundant water is available close to the earth’s surface, although the quantity and depth could only be ascer tained by boring. He suggests the lines on which a further survey should be conducted with a view to locating sources and determining the most suit able means of sinking wells, which in some cases might most suitably be done by mechanical or even hand-boring appliances, in others by band-digging. He suggests that the first wells should be sunk along the pilgrim roads. He again recommends the use of windmills and states that each well should be provided with a reservoir and surrounded by a small plantation. He believes that the area surveyed should be capable of producing maize, clover, lemons, oranges, cotton, eucalptus and probably figs, bamboo, walnuts, hazel puts ana vegetables; and he suggests that as wheat is grown success- fully in Trans-Jordan it might also be tried. The instalment ends with a descritpion of two water points at Dabhan, 30 miles north of Jedda and Tawil al Qadima, 25 miles North of Jedda. o. There is presumably 7, more to follow in future issues of the Umm-al- Qura and it may be interesting, if Mr. Twitchell’s results as regards mining possibilities are published m eocienso. . 6 As regards water, I do not know how much information His Majesty s Government already possess regarding water in the Hejaz in the s ape of ^reports furnished to the old International Sanitary Board hi75 Constantinople, e.g Dr F G. Clenow’s monograph on “Les Eaux de Dpddah , or repoits made for military purposes during the War I do not know either to what extent the matter is of real interest to departments of His Majesty s Government. If it were considered worth while this Legation could send home a translation of Mr. Twitched’s report but I should not with to undertake this unnecessarily as the labour of checking the rough translation already made with the Arabic text in the Umm-al-Qura itself presumably a translation from an English original, would be consi derable. 7. As regards other minerals, I mentioned casually to Fuad Bey Hamza some weeks ago the announcements in the Stockholm press that the Hejazi Government had asked the Swedish Government to supply a geological mission. See the correspondence ending with Mr. Clark Kerr’s despatch to vou No. 127 of May 31st [S. No. (59)]. Fuad Bey did not deny this report but did not expand. ' 8. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade. (89) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 27th August 1931. (Received on 20th September 1931 with Pol, Secy.’s letter No. P. Z.-36, dated 3rd September 1931.) Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 253, DATED THE 1ST JULY 1931. In my despatch No. 177 of the 15th May [S. No. (67)], I attempted to bring up to date the information in my earlier despatch No. 108 of the 23rd March, regarding the financial situation in this country, with special refer ence to the problem of exchange. I have had occasion in other reports to advert to the growing hopelessness of Ibn Saud’s financial position, and to the way in which it has come to be ai dominant factor in the political situa tion in the Hejaz. 2. There has been no improvement in the financial outlook since the middle of May. It seems more than probable, though it cannot be taken as certain, that any gold reserve which the Director-General of Finance may have had up his sleeve has been practically exhausted. This is the view of the manager of the Dutch Bank, who was in close touch with the Govern ment during March and April. He told me recently that at the end of that period the Government were in fact good for the £60,000 in gold required to bolster up the exchange. I could not ascertain whether he actually made a new arrangement with them then, but, if he did, little or nothing came of it, and Mr, Jacob’s principals in Holland have settled down to an attitude of abstention from further transactions. Before the departure on leave of M. Adriaanse, the future Netherlands Charge d’ Affaires, who arrived here some months ago to be initiated into his duties in accordance with the Dutch system, he was strongly pressed to use his influence at home to get the Dutch Government to get the Dutch Bank to be more accommodating. There is very little chance, however, of their altering their attitude. 3. I have reported elsewhere on the King’s experiment of convoking a National Conference of urban representatives, which sat from the 2nd to the Hth June, to review in an advisory capacity the problems confronting the Hejazi Government. Finance was naturally a prominent feature in the proceedings. As might have been expected, the members of the conference had no comfort to offer, and such advice as some of them were bold enough to tender was most unpalatable to Ibn Saud. All that the conference effect ed was to help to give a certain coherence to grievances which have gradually been growing articulate afid which may be summed up as follows. (a) The L632(C) F&amp;PD - -/ Hejaz is the victim of a double drain on its meagre -resources, owing to the amount of money expended abroad on extravagant requirements, of which motor cars are the favourite example, and the amount which is devoted to expenditure proper to Nejd, notably subsidies to the tribes there; (b) the country has no budget in any true sense, and almost unlimited power in the financial domain is exerted by the Director-General, Sheikh Abdulla Sulei man, whose unpopularity increases by leaps and bounds, but whose position with the King seems to be unimpaired. Certain members of the conference had the courage to criticise Abdullah Suleiman and to proclaim the necessity for a budget. The King’s reply is said to have been in effect, “le budget c’est moi.” 4. The trouble.has become concrete in two forms, viz., (a) the failure of all efforts to maintain the riyal exchange, and (b) the necessity for finding new money to carry Ibn Saud over a very lean period. Unless assistance can be obtained, it may be confidently anticipated that this period will be one of complete indigence for some months, that the next pilgrimage season will bring some temporary relief, and that, if the pilgrimage is again small the position a year hence will be at least as bad as it is now. 5. The silver currency has entered on a new phase of depreciation during the last few weeks. The riyal stands now at about 14-| to the pound. The wonder is that it has not gone lower. The King has his own cure, which I described when reporting on my audience of the 17th June [cf. S. No. (65)]. I may repeat myself in order to make this despatch self- contained. All that is necessary, says Ibn Saud, is to bring the Hejazi silver and nickel currency into use throughout his dominions, and he has taken measures with that object. He may succeed, but I doubt whether he realises how difficult it may be to secure acceptance in countries like Nejd and Asir, of a currency which has been so blown upon in its country of orimn. He has, however, discovered one practical device. He left Mecca for Neid on the 28th June, intending to make a long stay. I understand that this time he is going to meet the tribal demands on his generosity by presents in 6. But the need for new money has now become the maior problem. I have reported elsewhere Fuad Bey Hamza’s broad hint to me on the 12th June, that His Majesty’s Government might come to Ibn Baud’s help nancially as well as m other ways. The King himself was more guarded on the 17th June, but he broached a definite request, which I submitted for your consideration m my telegram No. 170 of the 19th June FS.

Enclosure in Foreign Office Covering letter dated 31st August 1931. Letter from H. M.’s. Charge d’ Affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office No. 308, dated the 28th July 1931. The “Umm-al-Qura” recently announced the following Hejazi ap pointments abroad : Sheykh Hafidh Wahba as Ibn Sa’ud’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at The Hague; Sheykh Abdullah Ibrahim al Fadhl as first Secretary in charge of the Hejazi Legation at The Hague; and Seyyid Hamza al Ghouth as Hejazi Consul in Batavia. 2. The creation of a Legation at The Hague has long been in contem plation but is understood to have been held up on financial grounds. I learn in confidence from Mr. Philby, who claims to have seen the figures, that the maintenance of their Legation in London costs the Llejazi Govern ment five thousand two hundred pounds a year. The rent of 42, Eaton Place is supposed to account for one thousand five hundred pounds of this sum. 3. Sheykh Abdullah is about 35 years old and a son of the late Ibrahim al Fadhl, head of the erstwhile considerable Hejazi firm of “E. A. Alfazal” of Bombay. The firm has recently gone into a bankruptcy which some consider fraudulent and Sheykh Abdullah, as one of the directors, has retired from before its creditors to the Hejaz, where he has since been living on the King’s charity. He understands English but speaks it badly. As far as I can discover his only previous contacts with Europe and diplomacy were made in 1926, when he accompanied the young Amir Feysal, as his private secretary, to England, Holland, and France. 4. Seyyid Hamaz al Ghouth is a man of over 40 and a Turkish-educat ed native of Medina. During the Arab revolt of 1917 he ran an anti- Hashimite paper in Medina, wherefore he received sentence of death Horn King Huseyn, but he made good his escape and later joined Ibn fea ud m Riadh. On the latter’s occupation of Medina he was made Assistant Governor of the city. He has recently been attached to the Palace at Mecca. 5. I do not yet know when Sheykh Abdullah and Seyyid Hamza are due ) proceed to their posts. It must largely depend on In the ast aragraph of his despatch No. 291 of July 16 [S. No (84)] Sir A.

Secy.’ s letter No. Z.-3-F., dated mb y September 1931.) Telegram R„ from H. M.’s Charge d’ f ^AmES Jedd A to the Foreign Office, No. 201, dated the 14th September 1931. Situation is deteriorating. 1 Dutch loan (my despatch 346) on which hopes of financial recovery have increasingly centred was refused on September 12th Government can now obtain no foreign credit, have drained private wealth practically dry, and appear to have no other resources. 2. They lack motor fuel to transport ammunition and supplies to Asir. Soviet benzine cannot arrive before September 20th. They did the utmost to obtain fuel from Suez by Italian steamer but failed. They consequently completed during the night of September 12th theft of 13,000 pounds worth of benzine from Gellatly Hankey and Company Limited comprising the firm’s whole stock in government warehouse. Theft has probably been proceeding for some weeks but authorities have apparently been falsifying accounts and denying firm access to store on pleas of absence of store keeper and key at Taif so that discovery was only made yesterday morning after last big haul. I have made representations by telegraph. 3. Financial and moral depression are deepened by news (not yet offi cially confirmed) of still further advances by Imam and general expectation of open hostilities this week. 4. Situation is not improved by spectacular collapse of Hejaz air force just when needed. Lowe is ill and was dismissed last week as useless but police have orders not to allow him to leave Jedda tomorrow (I may have to telegraph separately on this subject). Syrian adventurer recently engaged as pilot yesterday refused to fly and has been flogged and jailed; French Charge d’ Affaires now intervening. Turkish pseudo-mechanic has escaped into his legation after mauling by Nejdi garrison. German pilot (Sir A. Ryan’s despatch No. 213) was dragged from sick bed yesterday by 50 troops under General Officer Commanding and forced to fly to Asir. He returned after a few minutes, apparently fainted and crashed Wapiti in the lagoon but survived; German Consul now intervening. See my immediately following telegram [S. No. (92)]. Enclosure to S. No. (91). Telegram from H. M.’s Charge d’ Affaires Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 202 , dated the 14th September 1931. Please see my immediately preceding telegram [S. No. (91)]. No. (1) is serious, as the Riyal has suddenly dropped 2 points to 17. I foresee renewed and intense negotiations between Director of Finance and Soviet Minister over financial assistance for a loan on commercial con cessions and long credit. (2) is aggravating, but in the event of soviet benzine arriving, it will relieve local situation and I propose to try to secure by means of Gov ernment sales satisfactory terms for reimbursement to Geilatly Hankey of full value. J No. (3) is disconcerting to local officials, but as yet there is no indica tion that is considered by Ibn Saud as warranting his return. No. (4) has caused local sensation and belief is current that failure of air torce is the result of foreign intervention. I have declined request from i° e 1 a § 1 ues * or 3 0in t action, urging necessity for bolsteing up confidence of local Government rather than seeming to mob it.79 L632(C) f&amp;pd (Received on Ath October 1931, with P olitical Secretary's letter No. P. Z.-38 dated 17th September 1931.) EcL in F. 0, covering letter dated 15th September 1931. No. 1. Letter from H. M. s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 233, DATED THE 20TH JUNE 1931. In my despatch No. 200 of the 28th May [Enel, to S. No. (55)1 I attempted to give a general appreciation of the situation in the Hejaz. In various other reports I have dealt with particular problems and Ibn Sand’s groping efforts to deal with them before departing for Nejd, as he intends to do in the near future. The press of business thus entailed kept nim in Mecca long past the date which he had originally fixed for coming to Jedda. In the event he arrived here on the 14th June and left in the evening of the 17th June. 2. The King’s difficulties remain unsolved. I have not yet heard what passed at the National Convention which sat from the 2nd to 11th June. I gather, however, that it produced little except some forward suggestions by the bolder members and some consequent Royal displeasure. 3. In these circumstances, the King has been anxiously sizing up his position vis-a-vis of Great Britain, viewed both as a possible source of danger, having regard to His Majesty’s Government’s recent severity, but also as a possible helper. Fuad Bey Hamza preceded the King and arrived in Jedda on the 11th June. We discussed current business on the 12th June. On the 13th June he came to see me with the object of expounding general views on the relations between Great Britain and Hejaz-Nejd and with the w^re special object of discussing my personal position in regard to them. Ihis has, unfortunately, become a factor in the general situation, as for ?c ™ e time past the King has taken it into his head that I am hostile, and has attributed the policy of His Majesty’s Government to my inspiration Both he and Fuad Bey exaggerate pathetically my influence^ His Majesty has become alarmed, but is great enough to give play to a Royal r ^ e ntme^ . ove it to Fuad Bey to say that he has shown sincere anxmty to bnd e th gulf, not only, I think, in order to enlist my assistance, though he nati r y desires to do that, hut from a genuine belief that I am not such a ba if I am taken the right way. 3. I regret to have to lay stress on this matter of my personal positiom I do so because it has assumed an absurd importance m ejaz V &gt; therefore a more general importance,, however factitious I « a y ^7 h y although I have been outspoken on various occasions those on 'mj language has caused most displeasure have been occa carrying out your express instructions. 4. I have the honour to enclose three memoranda tecribing^my various interviews with Fuad Bey and the King during £ n j c ] ea that I that I have been at special pains to disabuse the King various con ^ am personally antagonistic. It was with a 2 A „. e w hi c h may appear versations I used on my own side a ° f ic h Sldlppear sympathe- to you excessive.

I ca Bev’s help I had reinstated 17th June with the feeling that, wlth ^^exteiR but that my tenure of it mvself in the King’s regard to a eonsid c , V ^ see him through with was precarious and would depend on whether 1 could His Majesty’s Government. wants 5. ! turnwith r ®f’ e f cannot ^realise that thl only an understanding with Great Bn85 ’ , noosible basis of such an understanding, is the settlement of questions as they frise Exaggerating his power, even in the midst of his present weakness, he conceives the possibility of a sort of permanent entente almost an alliance and an alliance potentially directed against the Hashimites He knows that iw would be a good thing for him. He imagines that it would be so well worth His Maiesty's Government’s while that they ought to be ready to help him-and the help he most needs at the present time is pecuniary help in some shape or form. 6 It would be too cynical to suggest that Ibn Saud y js offering to His Maiesty’s Government a “pure and virgin” love for a consideration. He is not himself cynical or brazen enough for that. He is more like the maiden of pantomime in a snowstorm, but proudly conscious of a station a beauty and a virtue that, given their chance, must cause her to be loved amd honour ably set up in life for her own sake. There are Christmas parties behind the windows that glimmer through the snow, and she would like to be taken into the nicest of those houses—yours, Sir. The maiden feels, if I may pursue a fancy not entirely idle, that you should not count on those Hashi- te girls whom you are already entertaining, pretentious hussies who are with fou for what they can get and will want more How much happier you would be with me,” says the maiden,, unconsciously vain in her conscious virtue. “And oh, how happy, should I be too! 7. I have tried to illustrate by a flippant example what T conceive to be Ibn Sand’s attitude, because I think it reveals it better than pages of solemn analysis He is not insincere, but he is fairly desperate at the moment and quite unpractical. He admitted towards the end of our conversation on the 17th June that the questions he had asked me to put to His Majesty s bo ernment were too hypothetical to be answerable. That does not mean that be will not expect sime sort of an answer. I do not see what His Majesty Government can do to help him. Political commitments to im, excep those of a purely negative kind, seem to be out of the question. It was de cided two years ago that there could be no q uestl o n , of ^, re ' ew f* of . financial assistance. He hinted then at a request for bread, offered a common form of commercial treaty. I can only leave y ou sider whether there is any form of kindness which His Majesty s govern ment could show him without prejudice to their obligations elsewhere an without spending money. I am telegraphing about one point only, that the possibility of getting a British bank to help him, because that is a co prpfp nronosal. thoua'h it seems to me as unpractical as all the rest. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. (A) Conversation with Fuad Bey Hainzu on June IS. FUAD BEY HAMZA spoke tome at length on the 13th June regarding the general state of relations between Ibn Sand and His Majesty’s Uover ment, with somewhat special reference to the effect thereon of my P ers position vis-a-vis of His Majesty. He had meditated his statement tor s time and it was carefully considered. 2. Euad Bey spoke of the object of my mission. The King s wis^ ^ see a British Legation established here was dictated by a desire to his Court a representative of such standing that he could re P resel ! be _ Maje-sty’s point of view to His Majesty’s Government and speak on . s half with authority, enjoying a greater latitude in the discussion ox ^ than could be expected in the case of a junior official. Fuad Hey strebc - ^ importance of personal factors, and expressed a desire to restore n y tions with the Kins: to their former friendly footing.81 3. Fuad Bey traced the history of Ibn Saud’s relations with His Majesty s Government, liiey had originated as far back as thirty years ago, when the King was the guest of Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit. The policy of His Majesty’s Government was favourable to Mubarak at a time when the Turks were backing Ibn Rashid. At that time and afterwards they had lent their moral support to Ibn Saud. Their relations with him were strengthened during the Great War. A treaty had been concluded at that time, establishing relations of such a nature that His Majesty had accepted a kind of vassalage of Great Britain, to which it was unnecessary now to look back, as that situation had been ended by the Treaty of Jedda in 1927. 4. The friendly relations, Fuad Bey said, had passed through periods when His Majesty’s Government seemed cooler or even antagonistic. They had supported King Hussein in the dispute over Taraba and Khurma in 1918-19 Ibn Rashid had been given support from the Iraq side before his death in 1921, and afterwards the Shammar had been used against Ibn Saud. When Ibn Saud secured Taraba and Khurma, His Majesty’s Government had accepted the new situation, but they pursued a policy which had the ap pearance of encircling the King. The installation of King Feisul and the Amdr Abdullah in Iraq and Transjordan at a time when Ibn Saud was pushing northward, and the use made of frontier tribes, had strengthened the impression, though it may have been eironeous, that such an encircle ment was in progress. 5 The pressure of encirclement was relieved when in 1924 the British lost faith in Hussein and the King embarked on the campaign which diove the Hashimites out of the Hejaz. But there was still a pressure from the north. Fuad Bey referred to statements by Sir P. Cox and/or bir 1. Dobbs which implied that Great Britain could look across the frontier, at Ibn Saud and 1 see him reduced to impotence. (When correcting this passage Fuad Bey was rather uncertain. He recollected something which passage r had y said to Sheikh Hafiz Wahba in Bagdad, and thought that something^had 1 appeared in the press. He offered to look the matter up. but I did not ask him to do so.) fi Fuad Bev referred to recent controversies, which had arisen during 6. luad Y p• a f res p phase of apparent coldness and anta- my mission here, f Government.

Great Britain had in Iraq and Transjordan a pri vileged positioif which it was important for her to maintain, but which could not be maintained without prejudice to the national aspirations of these countries. There was a conflict between British interests and those national aspirations such that true friendship was impossible. There was nothino* 0 f the sort to mar the relations between Great Britain and Ibn Sand. Except in one matter, which Fuad Bey hoped to see disposed of in the near future, namely, slavery, we did not seek to impose ourselves on Ibn Sand. Was there anything else? he asked me. (I replied that our policy in regard to slavery was important to us, and that I had told him my views. I recognised that there was nothing fundamental to divide Ibn Saud and His Majesty’s Government, though I should have more to say about the details of Fuad Bey’s statement.) 9. Fuad Bey described the friendship between the King and Great Britain, in contrast with those other friendships of which he had spoken, as being “pure and virgin”. It could be utilised. 10. What did Great Britain want of Ibn Sand? Fuad Bey asked, supplied an answer under six general heads as follows:— He ( 3 ) ( 4 ) (1) The continued maintenance of friendly and peaceful relations. (2) The continued maintenance of the security in this country which was essential, e.g., in the interests of British pilgrims. The maintenance of friendly relations with the surrounding countries in which Great Britain had special interests. The King’s dominions so situated as to lie across the line of British imperial communications through the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf and by the transdesert route to the north of them; it was Great Britain’s interest that there should be no menace to those communications. (5) In particular, Great Britain wished to be free to use the Hasa coast for purposes of aerial communication, a thing which could only be done on a basis of friendship with Ibn Saud, and which was all the more important because of the possible diffi culty of using Persian territory, (6) It was in Great Britain’s interest to counteract Bolshevik propa ganda in the East, whether illegitimate or carried on under a cloak of legality, and in this His Majesty co-operaton was needed. 11. Fuad Bey said that these were very general headings, under each of Avhich special questions arose. Fie instanced the question of Aqaba and Ma’an and questions in the Persian Gulf. He regarded such matters as being of subsidiary importance. 12. The King was on his side, Fuad Bey went on, compelled to rely on the assistance and support of Great Britain. 13. The object of my mission, he said, should be to harmonise and pro mote the interests of both sides, between which interests there was no con tradiction. 14. I observed that Fuad Bey had indicated what, in his view, were the things for which Great Britain looked to Ibn Saud, but he had indicated in a single sentence only the things for which His Majesty looked to Great Britain. 15. Fuad Bey said that he was prepared for questions on his statement. He could not tell me the King’s desiderata in detail without taking instruc tions, Imt he could tell me his own ideas on the understanding that I should 3 111 deal ■3 ar SortL632(C) FVPD 83 'ndslt I* 1 ® ill Crests ^ silt. \ selves 01 dhiim e KIej i .tM pi!?fi te to tier there Wi ee tnm ion, a tiiff carried#*' treat what he said as purely personal. He developed then on this agreed understanding, on the following lines : 1 , r is agreed )nal Kino* both f T ^ t HejaZ Ba i 1Way ( l uestlon ’ wllich interested the Km &amp; both politically and economically; politically from the point of view of bringing certain parts of his dominions m o closer touch with each other; economically, because of the value of the railway, if reconditioned, as a means of rapid transit, huad Bey referred to a private letter which I had written to the King and which was in the file. I said that, while I was not authorised to discuss the question, I was odad to know that His Majesty’s advisers had knowledge oAhe letter, which had taken the form it did for very special reasons. Fuad Bey understood those reasons, and said that, as they had imposed a special course of action, a suitable communi cation, .would be made to me in reply in the first instance. (2) The question of Aqaba and Ma’an was still unsettled. He did not say that the King wished to reopen it now or to press it, but it was an outstanding matter between him and His Majesty’s Government. (3) The King desired assistance in connexion with the extensive Wakfs in territory under British control. (4) Fuad Bey said that he was on such terms with me that he could speak of a matter, which others might hesitate to broach so frankly, viz., the financial needs of this country. I knew very well, he said, the King’s difficulties and liabilities. He was expected to maintain security, to provide a sound sanitary administration; to improve his ports; to promote economic development; and to seek resources other than the pilgrimage on which the country at present depended and which had become precarious. He reminded me that the Turks in their time had to maintain an army of 30,000 men in the Hejaz, and to subsidise tribes as well. The resources available were known. I observed that I myself had no accurate idea of them.) If the King had to work on the Turkish plan and did things on the Turkish scale, it would now be necessary to spend $1 million to £2 million a year on security alone. It was also necessary to provide for the civil administration and for representatives abroad. Fuad Bey, after enumerating those burdens, observed that both King Hussein and Ibn Saud had enjoyed British financial assistance in the past. (5) Finally, Fuad Bey said, His Majesty’s Government could help Ibn Saud by ensuring a good attitude on the part of his neighbours, in regard to whom we had a special position. 16. Fuad Bey assured me, and renewed the assurance later, that the King desired a perfect understanding with His Majesty s Government, and that, if such an understanding existed. His Majesty was prepared to mee., us on all the points to wTiich he conceived us to attach importance. 17. I thanked Fuad Bey for speaking to me so fully and frankly. There followed a long and intimate conversation which was confined to the question of my personal relations with Ibn Saud, to which Fuad Bey had referred tactfully as being in need of restoration to an earlier and better tooting. I said that I myself had been conscious of a strain I traced m detail the history of relations with Ibn Saud, referring to the various occasions on Wluch, in dealing with particular matters notobly ^ question, I appeared to have given offence. While agreeing generally with Fuad Bey’s 'definition'of the o°bject of a mission like mine and his view as to the importance of personal factors in diplomacy, P increa- questions of the highest importance, diplomatic re PJ ,e ^. ta i 1 J e ^ e J r e ta ^ e of singly dependent on their central Governments, and the pSt personal factors, great as it was, was apt to be exaggerated m Extern mnntries I said not by way of excuse or apology, but out of my strong desire 'to disabuse the King of any idea that I was antagonistic, that, if at times I had spoken or written very plainly, it was either because I was Pound by quite definite instructions or else because I wished to get certain auestions settled without their assuming such importance as to force His Maiestv’s Government into the necessity of themselves taking a strong line When instructions assumed final form they had to be carried out The final form often differed from the original form as a result of consultation with me I deprecated any idea that the attitude taken up by His Majesty s Government over, e.q., Transjordan frontier question was inspired by me or was due to anything except the serious view that His Majesty s Government found themselves compelled to take up a particular situation, which had been exaggerated to a dangerous point since October. is I pointed out to Fuad Bey the special difficulties of a Minister in dealing with a King who was effectively his own Minister for Foreign Affairs and delegated so little authority to his advisers that he handled foreign business himself not only by directing general policy but by going into all the details personally. It was a necessary consequence of this that a Minister might have to address direct to the King communications, some- Hmes of a disagreeable nature, which, in other countries, would normally be addressed to a Minister of State. 19 Fuad Bey recognised my difficulties and promised to do everything in his power to satisfy the King that my attitude was not one of hostility He suggested that, when I had strong representations to make, I should make them to himself rather than direct. I said that it was necessary for me to lay certain matters before His Majesty m person, and that I was sometimes formally directed to do so. Subject to this I was quite prepared, and myself preferred, to discuss details with the King s advisers. J - i a T Via 20. As it was late, we agreed to reserve anything I might have to say in regard to the remainder of Fuad Bey’s statement for a further interview. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. (B) Further Conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza on June 16. Fuad Bey came to see me again on the 16th June. We discussed some minor matters, but his main purpose was to complete our conversation of the 13th June before I should see the King. The following is a much condensed account of what passed L'. Fuad Bey brought me the King’s reply to my recent private com. munication about the Hejaz Railway. (I am dealing with this s cp aratel y-) Fie brought also a less formal letter of his own, m which he suggested certain corrections in my record of his statement of the 13th June, which 1 hart let him see (I have introduced these corrections into the record of our nrst conversation.) He asked me to add the following points to his original statement (a) He had spoken to me without instructions from the King, but he was personally convinced that the King’s interest lay m a good understanding with Great Britain. (6) He knew that the King himself had the best intentions towards Great Britain and relied on her along. 3 Fuad Bey explained that, in these circumstances, his object was tn arrive at an understanding with me as to the objects we should jointly nnrsne using our influence with our respective authorities. I replied tna T was at one with him in his idea that we should work together to P roin0 good relations, but said that our positions were different. He was ti King’s adviser on foreign affairs and was the real Minister lor Ioreig a ftdlva so far as there was any such Minister other than the King himsei , ■tie l 0 1 ion a ! j and did I had pi “SS that b Jiich he hfl it following o Jit interest , friends.

He (Fuad) was therefore in th^ position of a responsible statesman. I myself was a civil servant. I could, and did, advise my Government on particular questions, but nor mally a diplomatic representative did not shape maior policy I could hardly, therefore enter into a contract, as it were, to pursue a given set of objects, though I could, and would, collaborate with him. 4. I had promised to give Fuad Bey some observations on his statement of the 14th June. 1 began with his historical retrospect recognising that all through Ibn Sand had been a friend. Fuad Bey knew more, I said, than T did about the details of the recent history of Arabia. I suggested' however, that he had not paid sufficient attention to the fact that thTevents to which he had adverted were all parts of a difficult process of readjust ment following on the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire. The position after the Great War was that there were certain parts of Arabia in which we had taken on definite responsibilities and others in which we had a less direct interest, two being areas ruled over by two Sovereigns who were both our friends. We were indebted to King Hussein as well as to Ibn Sand. We had sought to work for a stable Arabia and to compose differences. Ibn Sand had, so far as territory was concerned, come best out of the whole process, not thanks to ns but to himself. Fuad had spoken of encirclement. It appeared to me that we had been on the edge of the circle first and that Ibn Sand had expanded until he filled it. For me, I said, history began with the Treaty of Jedda in 1927, subject to there being a pre-history dating from 1925. Owing to our special responsibilities in Iraq and Trans jordan we had negotiated the Bahra and Hadda Agreements at a time when Ibn Sand had not yet completed his conquest of the Hejaz. 5. Fuad Bey suggested that all would have been well had we kept the adjoining countries under our own control and had not introduced into them as rulers the King’s enemies. I said that the first alternative was out of the question, because responsible people in Great Britain and British pubblic opinion did not want enlarged commitments but reduced commit ments in the East, and because there were nationalist sentiments to be reckoned with in the countries themselves. Those sentiments had been strong in Iraq and they existed in Transjordan, though the position of that territory was different and its evolution was less complete. I demurred strongly to the idea that there could be no real friendship between us and those countries, because we retained a special position, which in l 1 e Iraq would be reduced to an absolute minimum when the treaty of 1930 became operative. We wished to be, and thought we could be, fnends^with everybody. Onr ideal was to see settled States in Arabia m friendship with us and with each other. A great measure of equilibrium had been achieved There were States with definite frontiers even though the Transjordan frontier, for instance, was m one part still a theatre ot difficulty and in another the subject of an outstanding question as he had reminded me when speaking of Aqaba and Maan. a neve sion to deal with that particular question and did not ™ ean ft It had been in abeyance since 1927 when we had st at e .d a position whmh the King had not accepted; but he had agreed to a an J riiwadi, and all I could see for it if there were an ^Bev was that the status quo and the modus vwendi shouid continue.

SSS'rwlrfthetol fcTlhbgTLtad enumerated. 1 mtpmi **86 the Kind’s great achievement was that he had established security, a matter of direct interest to us in the pilgrim area when it was complete and of indirect interest to us in a more general sense. As regards the fifth point on his list I did not know the position as regards flying over lersia, but we should like to have freedom in agreement with the Powers concerned to flv either way along the Persian Gulf. In so far as Bolshevik propaganda was still an active force in the East, it was our interest to counteract it, (Fuad Bey said he wished to speak to me another time about Bolshevik nroDaganda.) T As regards Fuad Bey’s purely personal estimate of the ways in which His Maiesty’s Government might help the King, I said as little as I could I said that, if he wished in due course to speak about the Hejaz Pailway I would report what he had to say; I had no instructions on the subiect. I had said all I would say about Agaba and Maan another cpies- tion wdiich had not arisen since I came here. He had referred to Persian Gulf questions. There had been a talk of discussing them last year, but eventually the Biscoe incident had held everything up. My Government were anxious that these questions should be handled by Colonel Biscoe, as they were in his sphere. I could not, therefore, speak of the desiderata on both sides, but I might mention the impression produced by the King’s prolonged blockade, as it were, of Koweit. As for AVakfs, the King had discussed the subject with Sir G. Clayton in 1927 and had formulated desiderata. They had been carefully considered, and later in the year a reply had been returned, based on the constant policy of His Majesty’s Government of not interfering in so purely religious a matter. I remarked that I myself, though I sometimes made representations about Wakfs in the Hejaz at the instance of British Moslem interested parties, a thing rather different from interfering in Wakfs in a country which we admi nistered or controlled in any way, always did so with hesitation and within as narrow limits as possible. There were, I observed in passing, many Wakfs for the benefit of pilgrims at Mecca, and the Hejazi Government would do well to see that they were well cared for. ? 8. I turned to finance. It was true that in the past His Majesty’s Government had assisted King Hussein and Ibn Sand. That was part of a policy arising out of the war, when money was spent on many things—we had, for instance, spent millions on buying fish in Norway merely to prevent its going to our enemies. Economy was now the order of the day. It was a plank in every political platform in England. It was practised by His Majesty’s Government. Every Government must now stand on its own feet. That was a hard saving, but true. I knew of the difficulties of this country. I realised that it was too dependent on the pilgrimage. I saw salvation only in the development of the fresh economic resources to which the Government had been turning their attention. I had heard of press statements about an application to Sweden for a geological mission. I had nothing against that. I would not encourage any hope of direct finan cial assistance from Great Britain, if that was what was in Fuad Bey’s mind. British interest might possibly be enlisted in connexion with economic schemes. If I could help with any advice in regard to such schemes I would be happy to do so. 9 9. Time was running out and I could not follow up the one remaining point in Fuad Bey’s statement of the 13th June; fortunately, perhaps, as Fuad Bey might have harped on an idea, which emerged in the course of our conversations, that Ibn Baud’s assistance, negative or even positive, would be useful to His Majesty’s Government if ever they had trouble in Iraq or Transjordan. I wound up the conversation by saying that I had given him an exposition of my own ideas. If they were in some ways dis couraging, he would not take it amiss. It would be easy enough, but not honest, to intimate agreement with him; to say when he suggested our working together on some particular line : “Yes, that’s splendid; I’ll put it up to my Government,’’ and say two or three months later that my Govern ment had turned it down.87 L632(C) F&amp;PD Enclosure 3 in No. 1. (G) Record of Audiences with Ihn Saud on June 14 and 17, 1931. The King arrived in Jedda early on the 14th June. In accordance with his custom he received the foreign representatives in succession that morning. As my audience on this occasion was formal I did not touch on current business, but I said that I had been awaiting an opportunitv of conveying to His Majesty the congratulations of His Majesty’s Govern ment on the successful negotiations with Iraq (see Foreign Office telegram No. 86 of the 21st May). I said that I had previously offered my own congratulations and those of Sir F. Humphrys, but that His Majesty’s Government had waited until ratification was assured. I explained that I had received my instructions some little time ago when His Majesty was expected in Jedda, but that, having told Sheikh Yussuf Yasin the nature of the message, I had deferred the communication until I could see the King in person. The King paid a renewed tribute to the part played by His Majesty’s Government and myself, and spoke with great appreciation of Sir F. Humphrys, when at a later stage I said that Sir Francis had asked me to thank him for his gracious reply to a personal letter sent at the time of Nuri Pasha’s visit. I ovserved that we had, indeed, worked hard for a successful result, but that its attainment was due to the attitude observed by the parties directly concerned in the final negotiations. 2. I had discussed outstanding business so thoroughly with Fuad Bey that I had really little to say to the King himself during this visit to Jedda. I therefore told Fuad Bey on the 15th June that I was not applying for a business audience, but that it might be useful if I saw the King, as His Majesty was going to Riadh and I to London; that he himself might have matters to discuss with me; and that, in any case, I hoped the King would give me a few minutes before he left for Mecca, so that I might pay my respects on the eve of our separation for a long period. 3 The King received me on the 17th June and kept me for two hours. Fuad Bey interpreted, and Sheikh Yussuf Yasin was present nearly the whole time. I began by saying very much what I had said to Fuad B^y as stated in the previous paragraph. It was clear that His Majesty did not wish any more than I did myself to discuss the details of any partmula question, but he engaged me in a conversation of a general kind in whuA on his position vis-a-vis of His Majesty’s Government The following is an account of what passed, necessarily abridged and not based on notes. 1 have omitted one or two digressions . 4 The Kino- spoke of his old friendship with Great Britain He said that ill tercertinjf tf this them, 1, did “ “.KVd'Si, M*liS,“ ahl,. was 1 f n .P er, f h ^‘ t it g] a ^s[i 0 l f fofldm w’aTthat of his personal position ssssr-srasrs ^ ’z*sJat&gt;is s ■ yarVeaga israwwiw &amp;* Sir Percy had not »&gt;« £,§”■ “in' His Majesty s Government.

I said that I was at the e Maiesty’s Government, anything he might wish to communicate to His Maje y88 6 The King said that there was nothing in the general situation in Arabia to cause anxiety. The situation might, however, change. He was&gt; the friend of Great Britain, whatever might befall. If any change occur red if, for instance, His Majesty’s Government had difficulties m neigh bouring countries (I do not recoliect very clearly the words used, but this was implied if not stated), he would like to know where he stood. What acts would His M^ajestv’s Government wish him to avoids In what posi tive way could he assist them in case of need ? these were the questions, which lie had sought to elucidate in the past through Sir P. Cox and Sir G. Clayton. He was asking me now to obtain answers to them. How did he stand ? He did not mean that his friendship depended on the answer. He would be Great Britain’s friend as he had always been, if they needed his friendship. He was not making it a matter of bargaining. 7. I undertook to convey His Majesty’s statement to His Majesty’s Government. I added that I could hardly venture to say much myself, but that I should like to offer a few observations. On this the King said that he was not only giving me a message, but seeking my personal advice. He did not wish to say anything that might produce a bad effect or breed suspicion. 8. Thus encouraged, I said rather more than I at first intended. I reminded the King that he had sent, Sheikh Yussuf Yasin to speak to me on the 1st April about his perturbation over the apparent tension between Great Britain and himself. I had told the Sheikh that His Majesty’s Gov ernment’s fundamental attitude of friendship towards the King had not changed, and had stressed the fact that His Majesty’s Government dealt with particular questions on their merits. I had not disguised the danger of general relations being affected by such a question as that of the Trans jordan frontier, but the danger had now been averted. The language I had used to Sheikh Yussuf and similar language on other occasions had been approved. 9. I spoke of the bases of our friendship with Ibn Saud. Old associa tion was a factor in it; that always counted for something. The impres sion which he created personally was another factor : those of my country men who had had intercourse with him had always, in my experience, been attracted by his personality. The greatest factor of all was, however, the fact that His Majesty’s Government saw in him an element of stability in a country where they desired stability. \Ve were a nation of shop keepers and wanted stability everywhere. We had a more special interest in stability in Arabia for reasons into which I would not enter, as I did not wish to be too lengthy. 10 The King, I said, had sought my advice about his message to His Majesty’s Government. I did not dissuade him from sending it: I could not encourage him to hope for a definite reply. I knew little of what Sir P. Cox had done in Arabia, but I had known him otherwise. Whatever turn he might give to a matter, neither he nor Sir G. Clayton were men who would fail to report fully anything the King had said. If he had elicited no answer, I thought it was because his questions related to a hypothe tical case. It was a fixed principle with His Majesty’s Government to deal with questions as they arose, and they had a horror of defining an attitude in regard to hypothetical cases. I enlarged on this. 11. On this the King admitted that he could not expect a definite answer to his questions. What he wanted was to expound his views to His Majesty s Government and (this was implied rather than stated) to enlist my assistance. 12^ I took the opportunity of begging the King to believe that I was sincerely well-disposed towards him and his country. I wouM, and did, represent his views to my Government. ^ As I had told Fuad Bey, final instructions might diner from original instructions as a result of my sug- gestions, but final instructions must be carried out. The representative of a Government was like a chisel in the hands of a carpenter, an essential tool, but worked by the carpenter.carrvfnffrat mstouXan? 1 ! 1 ^ He su gg ested . however, that befora nforder thft ?t ffn-M k 0 ? f ascertam ^ Government’s side of the case, m o der tnat it might be taken into account. I did not&gt; analyse this obviously impossible suggestion. I assured the King of my good disposi tions, and said that I had used the analogy of the chisel adv^diy. Kwas a necessary tool and it must be sharp, so that it could be used in the carpentei s hand to piouuce things ot oeauty: it might also make rude cll f s - „ ^ sai( ^ ^ was sure t^at if we could get the Transjordan problem out oi the way, there was nothing to trouble relations. I reminded the King of his promise to receive the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and said 1 hoped the visit could be arranged if the King was stavin cr some months in Nejd. I added that I could not suggest anything definite at the moment, as Colonel Biscoe had been ill, and had, I believed, left for England. 14. I was about to leave, but the King detained me. He said he did not want to do anything behind my back. He had not consulted his advisers about what he was going to say, but he had made up his mind to say it, whatever they might think. It was a question of the financial position. This had two aspects. The first was the exchange situation, which turned on two factors—rivals and nickel. Steps had been taken to gather in nickel, and it had been rehabilitated. As for riyals, His Majesty intend ed to bring them into legal circulation throughout all his dominions, and this would produce relief, as the quantity of silver money was not excessive and an extended use would suffice to revalorise it. The other question was that of banking arrangements. There had been an arrangement with the Dutch Bank, which had broken down on questions between its representa tives here and their principals. The King said he would like to find another bank, which under suitable arrangements would serve the purposes of a State bank. He would prefer a British institution. He sought my advice and that of His Majesty’s Government. 15. I said that my personal opinion would have no value, as I knew too little of the machinery of banking. I would willingly consult His Majesty’s Government. I hinted that I thought it would be difficult to find a British bank, but did not exclude the possibility of interesting firms like Barclays, who were in the Red Sea, or Lloyds who were in Egypt. 16. The King said what he wanted to know was whether he might or might not hope for a British bank, and whether any firm who was interested would send a representative. The matter was of some urgency, as he had received offers from other quarters. I said I had heard various reports. I had heard, for instance, of a plan to authorise an Indian Moslem bank to establish itself here, although it had been represented to me as an idea conceived with a view to the convenience of pilgrims rather than with the more general purpose the King had indicated. This was a feeler, in case His Majesty should feel inclined to say something about the other advances made to him. He did not, however, respond.

Mr. Hope-Gill to Mr. A. Henderson.—(Received August 18.) Despatch from H. M.’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 315, dated the July 30, 1931. The more critical of Ibn Saud Mr. Philby has felt, the more communi cative he has become. Recent despatches of Sir A. Ryan s have traced the development of this tendency. A few evenings ago I earned i s origin from Mr Philby.90 &lt;&gt; He had been stung, I think, into unwonted frankness by trouble over the Marconi contract. Trouble over the effective range of the wireless tele- nhonv is still to oome-; the present friction centring round the refusal of the Heiazi Government to take over the four mobile sets and their failure to pay three of the monthly instalments of £1,000 each Mr. Philby was con- ^ templating drastic measures, such as sending Mr. Boucicault out of the country He was only deterred by the fact that all the material has arrived and is in Hejazi hands, and by the fear that they would begin monkeying with it themselves. ^ 3 He led the conversation on to financial matters in general and Ibn Sand’s incompetence in particular. While the pilgrim hosts were stoning the devil at Muna, the King held meeting after meeting to discuss the prob lem of the nickel exchange. Mr. Philby attended them, silent but increas ingly indignant. After much talk one day, it must have been the 30th April, the King ordained that the Saudi piastre should henceforth stand at 44 to the rial; its par value was 22, but it had dropped into the 50’s; every one applauded the King’s wisdom and his fiat went forth. On the next day, after much further talk, the King decided that the piastre should sta id at'22 and accepted equal applause from the same advisers. Mr. Philby was furious, but waited until the King had left to tell the sycophants what he thought of them. On the following day the King, whose ears are long, chaffed him beyond endurance. After a heated discussion, Mr. Philby was sent out into the streets with a gold sovereign and a silver rialdn his hand and told to prove his assertion that, whatever His Majesty might ordain, not one of his subjects would sell a silver rial for 22 pieces of nickel. In vain he pointed out to the King that what he wanted for this purpose was only a handful of nickel. Ibn Sand, he maintains, simply could not under stand so simple a monetary point. He left in disgust at the ignorance of Ibn Sand and the suppleness of his advisers, and has but rarely seen the King since then. The incident may well have been distorted by Mr. Philby, but there is probably enough truth in it to make it interesting. Its rela tion is certainly illuminating. t 4. Mr. Philby was not less cynical about the impossibility of obtaining banking facilities for this country, though rather more guarded. It had been understood that he was interested in Lutfullah’s Bank to the extent of urging its advantages on Ibn Sand (see paragraph 7 of Sir A. Ryan’s des patch No. 177 of the 15th May) [S. No. (67)]. He now holds Lutfullah up to ridicule as that inordinately vain individual who, in King Hussein’s day, had himself named his Ambassador at Rome and paid for the privilege not only his own salary, but those of an imposing suite. Mr. Philby has even stated that the banker is now bankrupt. His attitude seems to be one of general disillusionment. The King has feet of mnd. The country, to National Conference, has ruled out anyhing in the nature of a State Bank. So much the worse for Lutfullah. 5, Mr. Philby also spoke of the benzine contract, to which Sir A. Ryan referred in paragraph 7 of his despatch No. 280 of the 12th July (Enelo. to S. No, (80)] He affirmed that, after threatening to close down his Lega tion and to have himself withdrawn, the Russian Minister had at length succeeded in securing the contract but nothing more, that is nothing in the nature of more favourable terms for the entry of Russian goods. The Hejazi Government had agreed to buy 50,000 cases of benzine at L50 dollars a case, to be paid for in three instalments at three-month intervals beginning three months after delivery. This agreement will enable the Hejazi Govern ment to ensure something over a half-year’s supply of their fuel needs. It is almost certain that no business house could afford to supply on these terms, unless at a deliberate loss. * * Ext. place 1 on F.-146-N./30. re. wireless in the Eejax.L632(C) f&amp;pd 91 ftw Phili cicault'o ill Si l ?

The Minister added that the Hejazi Government, in spite of his explanations, refused to believe that His Majesty’s Government were really, as they had stated powerless to influence the British banks, and had apparently tornied the opinion that His JVIajesty^s Government were them selves disinclined to support the proposal; he was doing his best to disabuse his Government of this misconception. 3. Meanwhile, as he had spoken very frankly about the Hejazi Govern ment's project in the first instance, he wished to state confidentially that he had learnt unofficially that Abdurrahman Qusaibi had now proceeded to Holland where a Hutch bank was showing great interest in the matter and appeared ready to come to terms. In reply to a question, the Sheikh said that he understood that it was proposed that a loan should be made to the Hejazi Government secured on the receipts of the Jedda customs, and that the Netherlands bank would probably be allowed to appoint an official in the customs to safeguard their interests. No final agreement had yet been reached, but it seemed probable that one would not be long delayed. 4. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba was informed that, as it had been impossible for this country to furnish King Ibn Saud with the financial help and faci lities he desired, His Majesty’s Government could only welcome the fact that the requisite assistance seemed likely to be forthcoming from another quarter. i (95) Memorandum from H.

I have the honour to state that I am Assistant Accountant General in the service of His Exalted Highness the Nizam of Hyderabad, and I came to Hedjaz before the last Haj having been appointed “Qafla Salar” of the Hyderabad Pilgrims. After the Haj, I came to Medina, where still I am staying.. It is my official duty, as Qafla Salar to inspect all the chari table institutions, maintained or aided by the Government of Hyderabad, and report on their working, and in case of need to render all reasonable assistance through proper channels to these institutions. I find open religious interference from the Shaikh-ul-Islam of Mecca, Shaikh Abdullah bin Hasan, which the annexed note fully explains. Under these circumstances, I have the honour to draw the attention of your Excellency, the representative of our paramount power, in this country, and to request the favour to take the necessary steps to prevent such religious interference, and allow the teaching in Madrasa Nizamiah, in Medina, which is managed by Maulana Abdul Baqi, to be carried on, according to the prescribed curriculum, approved by His Exalted Highness the Nizam of Hyderabad, according to the Hanfi creed. A copy of this note is also being sent to Honourable Sir Nawab Hydar Nawaz Jang Bahadur, Finance Member at the Hyderabad State Council,, and representative of that government, now in London.. There is a Madrasa in Medina under the name of Madrasa Nizamiah to give the post graduate education to the advanced students of Theology in Tafsir and Hadis according to Hanafi School, and it is maintained by the department of religious affairs of the government of His Exalted High ness the Nizam of Hyderabad. The Principal and Manager of this Madrasa is Maulana Sheikh Abdul Baqi, a recognised Alim of the Hanafi sect and he comes from the well-known family of Ulemas of Frangi Mahal of Lucknow. Maulana Abdul BaqFs elders have a long standing relation with the State of Hyderabad, and are Jagir holders of the State. Thirty years ago Maulana Abdul Baqi came to Hejaz and settled down in Medina. The Turkish authorities at Medina having recognised the abilities of Maulana Abdul Baqi he was allowed to lecture on theology to the advanced students, in the Harem of Medina, soon after his arrival there. The Sherifian Government which succeeded the Turkish regime yfaenth l^asno |ran Sham falrasaass titer the boy lilies order 0, appointed by aitis repres lial was ex lithe stride wer [Iwithoii do Med Maulani ai his stud dlslam, a: fanment laii sect, b stanes heedo: #1 the Me fit their93 also permitted him to continue his educational work. Maulana Abdul Jlaqi was carrying on this work without any help from outside till 1343 i I k t j iat / ea ^ ^ ovem ment of His Exalted Highness the Nizam of Hyderabad offered Maulana Abdul Baqi financial help to establish a Madrasa m Medina and engage the services of some Hanafi Ulemas to help him m the work which he was till then carrying on single handed and this offer was accepted and the Institution was named Nizamiah When the present Government came in power in Hejaz for about a year there was no government school whera Quran Sharif was taught to the boys, and Maulana Abdul Baqi felt the necessity of opening a class for teaching Quran Sharif to boys and he did so. This boys’ class was abolished in his Madrasa as soon as the Saudiah Government school was opened. Long ago after the boys’ class was abolished in the Madrasa Nizamiah, Mecca autho rities ordered Maulana Abdul Baqi to accept a teacher in his school, appointed by the Government, to teach “Tauhid” (the Unity of God), but on his representing the matter to the Amir of Medina, the Madrasa Niza miah was exempted, as no boys received education in that Madrasah, and all the students were grown up men who had completed theological educa tion and were getting post graduate lectures. The Madrasah was doing its work without interference from the Saudi Government till the beginning of this month, when Sheikh-ul-Islam of Mecca, Sheikh Abdulla bin Hassan came to Medina and ordered Maulana Abdul Baqi to accept a teacher ap pointed by the Government, to teach “Tauhid” to the professors and the students of his Madrasa, otherwise the Madrasa will be closed. Maulana Abdul Baqi considered the order derogatory to his co-workers and his students position and refused to accept it, and consequently he has been ordered by Abdulla bin Hasan to close his Madrasa. There are more than thirty students in the Madrasa from India, Afghanistan, Bokhara, Turkistan and other parts of the world, who are recognised Ulemas in their countries, and have come here to take the post graduate diploma from this Madrasa in “Tafsir” and “Hadis”. The curriculum of this Madrasa is fixed according to the Hanafi sect of Islam, and has the sanction of the Nizam’s Government. The Saudi Government has always professed that it recognised the four Sunni sects, viz., Hanafi, Shafaee, Malaki, and Hanbli; but the order of Shaikh Abdulla bin Hasan is an open interference with the doctrines and teaching of the Hanafi sect, and a compulsion to follow the teachings of the Whabiism. Mecca and Medina are centres for all the sects of Islam, and have a resident population of all sects, and pilgrims of all Islamic sects visit these places every year If compulsion of this sort is going to be forced by the Saudi Government to compel people of other sects to accept and follow Wahabi teachings, great estrangement of feelings will be the result which may lead to extremes of tyranny and hardships. Freedom of thought and religion is recognised by international laws, and the Moslem subjects of foreign governments have every right to expect from their respective government to give them the necessary protection m these matters in these sacred towns of Islam.

No. (83)], regarding a State Bank in the Hejaz, I have the honour to report that I learn confidentially from the local manager of the Nether lands Trading Society, more commonly known here as the Dutch Bank, that his principals in Amsterdam seem to be seriously contemplating a loan of £500,000 to Ibn Sand, to be secured on customs receipts and conditioned by suitable concessions in matters of handling and control of all public moneys. 2.

Ryan’s despatch No. 284, of July No (88)1 relative to Mr. Twitchell’s report on the water and minerals e the Heiaz coastal area, I have the honour to inform Your Eordshin tna' the final instalment of the report as translated into Arabic was puhhsbe in the “Umm-al-Qura” of August 28th. The process of publication has97 TriDolitan translator h^f iC and there are man y blanks wh ere the Iripolitan translator has boggled at the technology. As a whole the reoort is disappointing, except m the matter of water, gtud, and petroleum fh^ asked the Hejazi Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs to show me the report itself now that it is published, hut I am not sanguine about receiving^. H Mr TlitVu m w 6 hands 0f Khalld Be y al Qarqani, who acfom- pained Mr. Twitchell as interpreter and is now with the King at Itiadh. 2 t ^^ r ---Continuing from the point where Sir A. Ryan left it, Part II (1) of the report enumerates the existing and possible water-points along the coast from Rabigh northwards through Wejh as far as Muweyla which is some live hundred miles North of Jedda. It is on exactly the same lines and advocates the same treatment as that prescribed for the area iust North of Jedda, foretelling similar results in the matter of crops and culti vation. This water section of the report ends with the following summary : All the observations which I have made during this journey prove that there is a great quantity of water close to the surface of the ground which can be utilised in proportion as the ground is brought under cultivation. If this area is large, it will support many families and will develop this part of Hejaz. If cotton can be sown, ginned, spun and weaved by hand in quantity sufficient for the needs of the country, mnoh money will be saved and retain ed in the country instead of being sent abroad for the purchase of imported cotton goods. Similarly with dates, corn, etc. If maize and wheat are sown over smaller areas (than cotton) they will effect a large saving in the country’s budget. The way to improve and strengthen the general health of the nation is to increase the planting of fruit trees and vegetables. Excess products can be exported to Egypt and thus assist the national exchequer. 3. Minerals .—Part II (2) deals with minerals. It opens with a dis sertation on the geological process through which gold, platinum, diamond and tin bearing quartzes pass into alluvial beds, from which most of the world’s supply of these minerals is obtained. Mr. Twitchell states that he found large areas of alluvial quartz in the following places, but is unable to pronounce on their value without further expert examination. He thinks that only gold may be expected, an expectation fostered by the old gold mine at Al Qarayat on which he reports later : j Alluvial Beds. 1. Marbad, 15—24 Km. N. E. of Yanbuh 2- a wadi, Km.

E. of Wejh. 14. on road from Yanbu’ an-Nakhal to Salwar, 40-41 Km. E of Yanbu’. 15 Tn his water report Mr. Twitchell also mentioned the possibility of quartz-bearing alluvial deposits in a wadi 28 Km. N. o' Umm Lajj.98 4 For testing the alluvial deposits he advocates the use of a (blank) machine costing three hundred to four hundred £ 3 oc—*oo. pounds f. o. b. JNew York, which could also be used for finding water. It would be easy he says, for capable labour properly lunervised and with an interpreter to learn how to work the drill and make thl necessary calculations with a year’s practice. He adds: I repeatedly «uH strongly advise you to enforce this, that your subjects may be able to carrv out°tne work in future instead of employing persons from abroad”. Once found the gold may be won by dredging, a suitable machine costing ’ ahrmt thirt.v thousand Dounds. 5. Mr. Twitched then turns to minerals in lodes. The greatest mineral wealth in the world, he states, is that obtained from lodes. As a result of his brief investigations hei thinks that of the more valuable minerals, gold, silver iron, lead, mica and petroleum exist in the Hejaz. and there may be others, he adds. He advocates the training of personnel to distinguish samples. He had made a collection himself and commends its extension. “All industry depends on minerals” he says, “in a direct or indirect way. The progress and success of the United States of America are based on their minerals. I must strongly and repeatedly draw your attention to the great importance which should be given to the matter of your minerals”. 6. Mica .—Getting down to detail, Mr. Twitchell states that at Yanbu’ he was shown samples of mica, one a particularly large (37 cm. x 10 cm.) and a good piece of “mica muscovite”. Its source was not known and it was most important to discover it. India at present produced sixty-five per cent, of the world’s output of mica, a mineral which required but little and inexpensive machinery to produce. Every endeavour should be made to find and produce it. (I learn independently that promising samples are found in the hills immediately behind Jadda). 7. Iron .—At Salwan, thirty-two kilometers West (1) of Yanbu’ he found a sample of iron which he calls “spacpolarite”. The sits was a small volcanic area three by twenty meters and four hundred feet up by aneroid but he does not think that the geological formation warrants exploitation or further search. 8. Talc .—Two kilometers North of Yanbu’ an-Nakhal he found a small deposit of talc, but of no importance or value. 9. Coal .—Eight kilometers North of Wejh, at Himeyra and Qibla, hs suspected the existence of coal. Although he found none, he thinks that it may be worth following the layer southwards. 10. Emery .—At the same place and twelve kilometers from the old pil grimage for there was a presumption that emery existed, but he thinks it is of no value. '. 11 12 * 14 11. Gold I Silver. —Thirty-five kilometers North of Wejh on the Dhaba road he found large angular pieces of quartz and advises that the mountains to the Eastwards be examined to discover its source. Samples should be taken and examined for gold or silver. 12. Gypsum. North of Yanbu’ he found many sites of gypsum, useful for making lime and for improving the condition of salty soil. There was also gypsum at Jabal al Kabrit, thirty-two kilometers North of Dhaba. Sulphur. On the same mountain he thinks that there might be light veins of sulphur (kabrit means sulphur) but he himself found none, the area which he examined having no value. 14. Gold and Silver .—The most important part of Mr. Twitchell’s report concerns the old workings for gold and silver at Al Qarayat and Ras ash-Shuweyta I attach as Appendix “A” a verbatim translation of the bad Arabic in case it may be of interest to one with sufficient technical knowledge to decypher it. I have added to appendix “A” a translation of a further report of gold being found near Taif.X if*., P cu! imisicg File sits 99 15. Lead. —-Twenty-ssyen kilometers from Wejh and one hundred feet above sea-level he iound old lead-working at A1 Asib mine. The metal was fused m mud pots, only small quantities being produced. The deposit is chiefly of carbonaceous lead, with some lead sulphide. It seemed to lie in an irregular series of pockets extending one kilometer, “and its Northern direction is twenty-six degrees West” Mr. Twitchell advises that the whole area be carefully examined and the need for plant studied in connec tion with the result. 16. Petroleum,— It was very pleasant and delightful to note the possi bilities of petroleum in the district between Umm Lajj and A1 Muweyla”, says Mr. Twitchell. He had advised the local Amirs to make further search to the North of A1 Muweyla, to the South of Umm Lajj, and North and South of Yanbu’. He himself found surface asphalt, apparently throughout a strip of coastal plain three hundred and fifty kilometers long by two to fifteen wide. I attach as appendix “B” a verbatim translation of his report on petroleum. 17. Roads .—In part II (3) of his report Mr. Twitchell is impressed by the ease with which good roads can be quickly made and easily maintained throughout the coastal area. He advocates the engagement of an expert and the purchase of about four hundred pounds worth £400 * of dirt-trackcutters, ploughs, and rollers. 18. Conclusion. —Mr. Twitchell states that he has attached to his report full details of the samples taken and of his proposals for carrying out the work “In conclusion, I wish to say that this journey was very pleasant and that I and Mr. Crane hope that it will bring real results to the benefit of your country”. 19. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Controller-General, Department of Overseas Trade. ; Undo. 1 to S. No. (102), APPENDIX “A” f Gold and Silver. Al Qarayat Mine fGold): At a distance of twenty-seven kilometers East to South of Wejh and at a height of three hundred and ten feet above sea level by aneroi is on the Eastern side a big vein of quartz .extending to a distance ol ft y metres by a magnetic bearing of twenty-eight degrees South to eevent) degrees East. Its width is one metre. It is accidently cut on the No , but I did not find proof of this. In a place called (blank) (blank) there is a soft ^one lying between the veins of quartz stone and the wall underneath quartz which m kno ^ by “side wall foot”. There may be quantities 0 , l uartz f |f )d difficult to get them out of a hard rock such as this by means natural method. The most important works lie at a distance half ^kilometer^ These works cover the southern ® lde “J® “gj through the foundation at a measurement of one hundred P ^ hundred metres along- and extending North forty-five degrees West and two hundred ntetees^ ^ side the eastern edge. This mineral is in alongside the foundation teeth and it is composed of a big J^y deg ees approximately and another four veins extending South at ninety ucg to the foundation. L632(C) F&amp;PD V ■c- * - r i ',: i ■ v- v-'' ’ ' ** ' , -T * VThe measurement of the veins was one to nine metres in width. The places from which the mineral was taken are wide. As I can see, this work was bent to (blank) which is lying on both sides of the veins. It is probable that amounts of pure gold (which do not take much trouble to get out) existed in (blank) and that the quartz was too hard to be broken and crushed by the method which was used at that time for get ting out the gold. The small pieces of flint (hard stone) scattered there and the hand crushing mills which we saw near that mine prove that there is resemblance between these and the old Sudan gold mines like those in the Gebeit mine. It is not advisable to think that the work done there shows that it was done without getting the mineral searched for. Sample No. 1 was taken from a pole of hard rock of fifty-one centimetres thickness at wall foot (under a quartz vein) in one of the old places from which gold was taken. This sample should be examined for both gold and silver, so as to know the amount of presumption in this kind of raw mineral. Sample No. 2 is taken from several quartz broken pieces covering the area of the western mine. If this sample gives proof of a precious value under the circumstances of the present work, it will then be possible to obtain a large quantity but this cannot be decided until after the necessary W'ork and investigation are made for the preliminary yield. The geology of this territory proves that the mineral bodies will not be so hard and there are also two chains of quartz outcrop on the surface of the ground extending to a distance of two kilometres East. It is possible that one plant of medium size and covering the group of mines of Ras ash- Shuweyta, which lies at a distance of five kilometres South, will do the work of all these places but before thinking of the factory, etc., a full in vestigation should be made and several samples should be taken for exami nation for all these minerals as well as an accurate search being also made in all the neighbouring places, and if facilities are found for carrying out this work it will not take more than one year to one year and a half from the date the work commences. As ancient people were endeavouring to get out only the gold which did not give trouble, the necessaries for getting out this metal should be simple and cheap, say twenty thousand pounds for a mill to make fifty tons a day if only this kind of metal is found. Another twenty thousand pounds should be enough for digging tools (including air pressure) drills, grindstones, steel, blacksmiths, machines, carpentry tools, carpenters and also pumps, cranes and trunks with their railroads and explosives. Buildings should be built from local products of stones and timber. The obtaining of a sufficient quantity of water is necessary and if there is. not a quantity of water sufficient for milling, then the raw materials should be transferred to a suitable place. This operation may well increase the expense of each ton. Has ash-Shuweyta. (Gold and Silver.) This mine lies at a distance of five kilometres South of A1 Qarayat mine at a height of three hundred and twenty feet above sea level by aneroid. The vein extends South at thirty-seven degrees East magnetic, lower ed to sixty-two degrees North at a width between thirty centimetres to one and a half metres and it is worked to a length of two hundred and seventy- five metres and to an unmeasured depth, which is presumed to be ten metres at most. The appearance and shape of the quartz stone afford reason to believe the existence of gold and of silver also, but this will not show until after examination. There is in the A1 Qarayat mine a kind of mountain rock called “Anthracite schist” (blank), is cut by the heights. We took sample No. 3 from broken quartz stones alongside the worked places. .ofth : ce i 11 ‘ see &gt; of se' , 0 fabc u ♦ LottfdW irobable ! othei distance i in it brok #1 of this iftioned ab( iparatns foi liae should b tiinikr, If t Wnile m steof mine faifaspecin m in Jedd list in the Mr. Tw gild in the a toforty-thre atadistanei di Ai Wo. 2 to101 One of the veins extends to a distance of one hundred metres West of this place in a northern direction thirty-two degrees West. It was pos sible to see the external brosen quartz only which appeared to extend to a distance of seventy metres. We took sample No. 4 from this place. At a distance of about four to six metres to the North-East of Ras ash-Shuweyta falls what I have icalled the J\orth-eastern vein”. It lies in a northern direction sixty-eight degrees East is lowered at sixty degrees East and it passes through the iniddle of the line of the zone called (blank) 5 therefore it is probable that it wih be of regular shape wider and of greater depth than the other veins. It can be seen outcropping over the ground surface to a distance of about three hundred metres but there is no sign of old works in it. This vein is cut in several places. Sample No. 5 is taken from the broken pieces of quartz lying at a distance of fifty metres. The width of this outcropping is between one and two point ten metres. As mentioned above, all this area can be worked under one system and one apparatus for milling. It is certain that the instruments of A1 Qarayat mine should be separated from those of Ras Shuweyta, though they will be similar. If there is no haste in the work, then the fund prescribed for this purpose may be decreased by employing hand work instead of a mineral drilling machine. Discovery of Gold Mines in the Neighbourhood of Taif. While Muhammad Ali A1 Qarqazi, the engineer, was enquiring about sites of minerals in various directions, he found at Wadi al Mihrim near Taif a specimen of gold and for confirmation he asked Mr. Twitched, who was in Jedda, to visit the place. He has visited it and made several examinations and investigations, as a result of which the gold is found to exist in the veins of quartz stone present in a kind of rock called “Mica Schist”. Mr. Twitched also found on his way marks which show that there is gold in the area lying on each side of the Riadh Road at a distance of forty to forty-three kilometres from Taif and also in the area near Ash-Sharyh at a distance of one hundred and eighteen kilometres from Jedda, eastward of Wadi Az-Zima. Enclo. 2 to S. No. (102). APPENDIX “B”. Petroleum. It had been very delightful and pleasant to note the possibilities of petroleum in the region from Umm Lajj to Al Musweyla. We have advi sed the Amirs to make a search in the direction North of Al Muweyla, South of Umm Lajj and North and South of Tanbu with a view to finding whether there are more signs of petroleum or otherwise. I had Khalid Bev saw asphalt over the stony sands of that region. The complete distance from North to South is three hundred and forty-six kilometres as measured by the car speedometer. The distance East of the sea shore to the rocks is two to fifteen kilometres approximately. Before talking, about heavy expenses for search, a wide and distinct geological examination should be made alongside the lower area with a view to choosing and fixing the places suitable for digging preliminary wells. The extension of their depth and the commercial quantities of petroleum cannot be known without digging. I have no hesitation in recommending digging holes for experi ment. It is not expected (that it will be necessary) to dig very102 deer&gt; holes for this purpose, but I advise a moveable drill (blank) te employed for boring preliminary holes. This machine can bore to a Lth of three hundred metres. It was supplied to me complete for three thousand five hundred pounds in 1927. It is essential to employ two expert men for this work, which will last for one year. It is certain that the 'eoloR'ist or the engineer controlling this work should choose the places in which &amp; the holes should be made, as the other diggers (borers) are expert only in boring holes. The machines (drills) which are used in boring water wells may not be strong' enough for oil works. It would be better to enquire about the price of the smallest machine for refining oil, so that in ca.se of producing it m commercial quantities, it can then be refined for local use, which will save the considerable expenses incurred annually for the import of petroleum and other oils of the same nature; moreover, the transport charges will v . . inrincfrAr hv means of cheap inel.

I tried to draw him but found him very reticent. All he would vouchsafe was that he had already order ed some windpumping plant for the Waziria well near Jedda and that six American engineers would visit the Hejaz in the course of the next few months to prospect on the lines he had laid down. He thought that the Hejazi Government would make the necessary financial arrangements and that Mr. Crane would not bear any of the expense.' ■ i i . i iuo al-QL” 1 of Ju”? 11 the f0ll0Wing news was P ublished in the “Umm- ,We Which Were held the Got - ernment and certain other parties have resulted in an agree- General Ti ' : ’ heykh Sule y man A1 Hama d, Director General °f Finance and Mr. Twitched the American Geolo- which P wlIl lded t ^ a f h6 Wl!1 be the President of ‘he commission which will search for minerals and oil.

Umm-Al-Qura, No. 352 of 11-9-1931 (28-4-1350). Gold Mine in Fran-Bani Salim. The mine of Fran, or Bani Salim, is one of the mines known to exist in the Arabian Peninsula and is mentioned in the books of several writers of olden times such as Yaqut, A1 Hamadani, A1 Maqdisi, Ibn Khudadhaba, As Samhudi, etc. It is situated near A1 Hanakia on the Medina Road in Hejd, and is mentioned in the works of Ibn Sa’dan as having been opened in''the era of Abu Bakr As Siddiq. Tradition states that Harffn Ar Rashid the Abbasi caliph produced a considerable output from this mine,^ and that samples from it were sent to Constantinople during the reign of Abdul Hamid at the request of his Government. L632(C) f&amp;pd104 Fran is known to Medina people by the name of Mahd Addahab “bed of gold” on account of the abundance of metal there. When Sheykh Abdullah Suleyman, Minister of Finance, visited Medina last month, he paid a visit to this spot in order to evnfy the reports which he had received regarding it, and found traces of diggings which had been worked m ancient times. Nine veins had been completely worked, out the ovens and biddings being still visible. He caused several samples to be taken from this mine for examination, in order that the quality and ype ot mineral existing' therein might be ascertained. (103) (Received on 31st October 1931, with Political Secretary’s letter No. P r Z-&amp;2, dated 15th October 1931.) Despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 361, dated the 9th September 1931, I took occasion of the recent visit of the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs to Jedda to ask him what he could tell me about the benzine cchp tract which his finance colleague was supposed to have signed with the Soviet Legation. His face fell, his manner lost its habitual assurance, and he retired into 1928 to gain time. He reminded me that in that year Ibn Sand had instructed him to broach with Mi*. Bird the subject of foster- ing British trade with the Hejaz as an offset to the Soviet attempts to break into the closed Hejazi market. Yes, I said, a favourable commercial treaty was sought as a quid fro quo, No. he said, he had been misunderstood more than that had been hoped for; but he did not specify what. Instead, he passed on the expatiate on the brave show that the King had put up against Soviet pressure, unaided and alone, until circumstances had at last become too strong for him. (Here I reminded him that the show was made not so much for our bright eyes as for the black looks of the Nejdi brethren and the Hejazi tradesmen at the mere mention of bolshevism and Soviet goods. He gave me right—up to a point.) 2. At last, however, His Majesty had been forced to yield in one parti cular to the Soviet pressure. Unable to make a satisfactory contract on the one side for State fuel needs, and threatened on the other by the with drawal of the Soviet Legation from Jedda, his Ministers had made the best of a bad job and contracted to buy ]£30,000 worth of Russian benzine, and on very favourable terms too. I suggested that they had been both bluffed and led into the way of further concession. He admitted the first as a possibility, but denied hotly that any further concession wras possible. When I reminded him that in spite of the total denial of entry to Russian goods, Russian matches were sold openly everywhere and Russian cement was not unknown, he made the curious statement that it was quite true that the prohibition was enforced and that at the same time here was a four fold duty on all Russian goods—a position easily understood in Jedda. He then said frankly that the financial situation was rotten, but he did not think it was hopeless. He himself had received no salary since March. 3. I have since received sidelights on the benzine contract from Herr de Haas, the German trading consul. He has recently returned from leave, having spent a month of it in Moscow haggling with the Soviet authori ties for the right to run their contract on a commission basis. Under pres sure of his threat to undercut them with still cheaper Roumanian oil, they played him with long negotiations up to the point of agreement, which they then refused; having in the meantime succeeded in securing their con tract in Jedda By negotiation with the Hejazi Government through their Minister. So keen were they to have it signed before Herr de Haas could' i*' \. ) 0® 1 secretarfful isfaclorf» heotl# 105 Eoumamaa'Sr ThafZ Sheikh Suleiman with his yet cheaper fhT^ame ohTect that ‘ wo “““^1 plenipotentiaries arrived here with *rt • understand that the exact terms of the contract are the purchase by' the Kejazi Government of 60,000 8-gallon cases of benzine at 6s.

This is now expected shortly. r 4 I learn that in anticipation of the delivery, Sheikh Abdullah Sulei man has already concluded an advance sale in Mecca of 2,000 cases of benzine at £1 apiece. This is the normal market price in the Heiaz, and shows a clear profit to the sheikh’s treasury of 200 per cent., with the added benefit of cash down against an unmatured debt. It is surprising that the Hejazis have not fallen sooner to such a lure. Their inherent aversion to bolshevism, their interested stand against Soviet trade, and M. Turakulov’s persistent efforts to obtain further concessions have probably been the main factors of delay. 5. In Jedda a humbler method obtains for raising the wind. The merchants having now been relieved, on loan, of nearly all their cash, are required to lend their stock-in-trade to the local treasury official. He there upon knocks it down at auction for what it will fetch, spot cash. I am assured that this means was resorted to in order to pay for the official din ner with which the Finance Minister was greeted on his recent return from Medina. Little wonder that the local tradesmen feel sore, so sore that even the venerable Governor of Jedda, himself a merchant who has been heavily dunned for loans, hailed the Indian vice-consul in full merket the other day and asked him how he could evade further, extortion. As the Governor is very deaf, the Munshi was much embarrassed for reply. 6. With regard to expenditure, I hear through a credible channel that Ibn Saud is no whit less extravagant than before, and that observers at Riadh are shocked at hislavish hunting parties. His Minister in London, on the other hand, has recently been telegraphing for funds. The arrange ment with Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., for the supply of credit to cover the needs of missions abroad (Sir A. Ryan’s despatch No. 291 of the 16th July) [S. No, (84)], was not concluded after all, but I learn confi dentially from the manager of the local Dutch bank that the Finance Minister succeeded during the last week of August in collecting £300, which the bank remitted to Sheikh Hafiz Wahba.

I have the honour to report that Mr. Philby, or rather Haji Abdullah St. John Philby, has returned unexpectedly from Riadh, and in the course of several conversations has givn me some interesting sidelights on the internal situation in this country. | 2. There seems little doubt but that Ibn Saud and he get badly on each other s nerves. He left with all his baggage and instruments in two cars running on a three-quarter paraffin mixture. In full desert they ran out of * With 4 spare copies, t With 3 spare copies^108 # who had to transact all the current business for his hermit Charge d’Affaires on the occasion of the Amir Feisahs recent visit to Jedda, found Fuad Bey ready to discuss the attractions of the post of Minister at Paris. I think that M. Durmarcay initiated this subject, a point which may have signifi cance of another kind. 7. Mr. Philby confirmed my growing conviction^ that the Director- General of Finance is now for all practical purposes “the Hejazi Govern ment.” He still has the King’s blind confidence. He moves about the central Hejaz, the only moving point and the sole motive force in an area of complete stagnation, collecting means from the merchants in cash or kind and disposing of it none knows how. Holding the purse-strings, he controls everything except the “Umm-al-Qura,” which he has tried to capture but failed in face of the “Syrian party,” which still has enough means to produce the paper. An essential department which Abdullah Suleiman is said to be deliberately starving is the Post and Telegraphs. In spite of the Finance Department’s hauls of benzine, the Jedda-Mecca- Taif mails have now for a forthnight been carried by donkeys. The Eastern Telegraph Company’s account is mounting up and nothing has been paid since the end of May. It is Mr. Philby’s opinion that, for all his secretive activit}^, Abdullah Suleiman is near the end of his tether and cannot reach the beginning of the pilgrimage season. I learn that he is shortly going to Riadh. 8. If he goes, the Hejaz will lapse into a state of anarchic torpor under the figure-headship of the Viceroy. The urban populations will sit with fatalistic eyes turned towards a pilgrimage which they know will be minimum.. The only movement which may be expected is from soldiery and police who, lacking pay wherewith to buv food, have the power to take it.

Prior to sailing on 14th September in accordance with programme, a message was received from H. M. Charge d’Affaires at Jedda asking H.M.S. “Lupin” to delay departure until arrival of a letter due the next day. . On receipt of this it was learned that on 12th September the Hedjaz Government had stolen thirteen thousand pounds worth of Benzine from Messrs. Collatly Hankey &amp; Co.’s, storehouse at Jedda. Also an acute financial crisis seemed imminent on account of the refusal of the Dutch to grant a loan, while reports of rising in Asir, with possible invasion by the Imam of the Yemen, rendered the situation at Jedda very unsettled. Although H. M. Charge d’Affaires did not ask for any change in pro gramme, I considered it desirable to stay a few days longer at Port Sudan, so as to be in touch and near. In the case of rioting in Jedda the W/T Station might be seized, also the cable line (which at any time is somewhat liable to damage) might fail, when the Legation would be cut off from communication, in which case H.M.S. “Lupin” would proceed to Jedda to restore a W/T rpute. However, on the 21st September reassuring messages having been received, “Lupin” proceeded on her cruise southward. Kama/ran.

He granted us this precious opportunity with a view to enabling us to proclaim the realities of the religion and the secrets of this mnocent case, ^ich is the adherence to the belief of the good ancestors.

The truth appeared and the he died. This is our line of action since the first number of “Umm-al-Qura’* was issued and we will continue it. The seventh year of “Umm-al-Qura” has expired. It was full of the various schemes which were carried out by the Government of His Majesty s the King - in the Holy land, in spite of the economic crises all o'vei the world. The first of all the functions which were carried out by the Government was to make treaties of Friendship with .some of the other Governments, the recognition by the United States of America of the Kingdom of Hejaz- Nejd and its Dependencies, and the establishment of two Legations, one in Holland and the other in Iraq, of a Consulate in Java and other diplomatic matters which may strengthen the friendly relations between this country and other countries. The cession by As-Sayid at Hasan at Idrisi of Asir to His Majesty the King also took place in that year and the former’s territory has become one of the countries of His Majesty the King. The assembly of the National Conference was one of the important func^ tions. It was assembled in Mecca during that year and will be held at the beginning of every year in accordance with the order of His Majesty the King, with a view to enabling the Government to understand the needs of the nation. The conference carried out the task which was laid upon its shoulders and enacted several decisions, the majority of which were put into force, while others are still under discussion, The Government paid special attention to the matter of facilities for Muslim visitors to the Holy Mosque and made many improvements which will greatly comfort the pilgrims.

Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Jeddah, to the Foreign Office,. No. 158, dated the 24th April 1931. I have the honour to state that Ibn Sa’ud came to Jeddah on the even ing of April 19, and returned to Mecca early on April 22. As I have reported in another connection the King had intended to come to Jeddah earlier, i.e., on April 18, but postponed his visit in order to avoid any appearance of having come to meet ex-King Amanullah, who arrived in Jedda on the morning of that day and proceeded to Mecca in the afternoon. The two Kings met on the 19th when Ibn Sa’ud received AmanuuRah Khan and, I understand, returned the visit. 2. His Majesty’s visit to Jeddah was un-official and I do not know with what, if any definite purpose, he came. It may have had to do with («) general preparations for the pilgrimage; (b) the fact that he has recently installed one of his wives en 'permanence accoiding to Mr. i y i Jeddah; and (c) the arrival by S.S. “Merkara” of the first consignment o wireless material delivered under the Marconi wireless contract. Ihe tying himself said that having felt slightly tired, he had come for a change o air. It is also quite possible that, although the visit was apparently planned in the first instance without reference to King Amanullah 8 mm e- ments, Ibn Sa’ud was not sorry to absent himself from Mecca for a portion of that embarrassing guest’s stay there. \ 3. The King received the diplomatic representatives on Ap r il A in formally but only for courtesy, visit. At my own audience he w . . ^ Tery friendly I mentioned the two wireless sets presented to y F. Humphrys on behalf of His Majesty s ’ r rnn fi n n- in the sonal letter' in which I had informed him that t ey seemed to be “Merkera” His Majesty expressed great appreciation and scen e particularly pleased over the fact that the g 1 ^* ca “® £3 to Tmention of Francis but from His Majesty’s Government. Tins led up to a mentmn ot the recent ’Iraq negotiations. I said that although I had not oonttto tajk business, I wished to congratulate His aj y m45 of the negotiations. He spoke cordially of the part played by Great Bri afn and her representatives. I expressed proper appreciation and faid that we had certainly done much preparatory work but that the final result was due to the statesmanship which had been displayed on both sides bv the parties directly concerned in the negotiations m Mecca. ' 4 Before I left the King spoke vaguely of again receiving me for the discussion of busYness. I was not specially keen on his doing so at this juncture, as the various questions with which T am dealing at present are better discussed with his subordinates. I did not therefore ask or a further audience but said that if His Majesty wished to see me I should be entirely at his disposal either during his present visit or when he returned to Jeddah after the pilgrimage. 5 In the event the King did not again summon me to the palace. He might have done so on April 21, when Mr. R. S._ Champion, the Pro^ teotorate Secretary at Aden arrived on a private visit to discuss matters of common interest wih me. I had told Fuad Bey about this, saying expressly that I did not feel that I could ask His Majesty to receive Mr. Champion but that, if the King himself wished to see him, I should be happy to present him 6. I attach no importance to the fact that Ibn Sa’ud did not give me a second audience. He was very busy while here but he would certainly have seen me, had I myself asked to be received either for business or to present Mr. Champion. 7. Although I have referred incidentally in this despatch to various matters, which have formed the subject of other correspondence, it is merely intended as a general record of the King’s visit. Should it be necessary to refer to anything that passed in special connections, I will do so separately in reports on the specific subjects. 8. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s High Com missioner for ’Iraq. (49) {Received on 28th June 1081, with Political Secretary's letter, No. 24, dated 11th Jilne 19SI.)

This anniversary has been celebrated with more and more emphasis during: the last few years, and has now reached the full status of an official holiday. 2. The commemoration of the “Martyrs” lends itself to the ventila tion of public grievances; and on this occasion the presence of members of the Syrian Government gave an additional savour to the speeches, in which they were vigorously criticised. 3. After a reference by the first speaker to the Italian atrocities in Libya, and an ode contributed by a Trans-Jordan poet denouncing the Gov ernment’s subservience to French advisers, the chief speech was made by Aref el Nakady, the late Government Attorney, the circumstances of whose dismissal were reported in paragraph 3 of my despatch No. 44, of the 23rd August, 1930.

Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 200, dated the 28th May 1931. I have had occasion in various recent reports to refer to various tions of weakening of Ibn Baud’s position in this country.

Ibn Sa’ud imposed bimseif on the Hejaz by force of arms, lie' maintains himself by force of personality and by a reserve of material force responding to Ins personal' direction and still capable of being applied w ih sufficient effect at any particular point to enable him to cope with anything short of a fairly general movement of opposition. Such a movement^ could hardly originate among the parasitic populations of places like Mecca and Jedda, although their inhabitants would almost certainly welcome a cimige of regime. The tribes have no such cohesion as to produce of themselves , n organised movement in opposition to a King whose name and past exploits inspire respect and fear. 3. So far so good, from Ibn Sa’ud’s point of view. Nevertheless he has to reckon with more remote factors. One hears vaguely but some hat persistently of a restive spirit in the North of the Hejaz. Hail and even Medina are potential centres of disaffection. Behind them are the Trans jordan frontier and countries ruled by members of the Sherifian family, a family which, though eliminated at present from the Hejazi scheme of things, would be the natural rallying centre for elements bold enough to try coucffi- sions with the present regime. Such elements may emerge m the North, even though it be impossible at present to locate or identify them, i neir boldness would strike an echo not of equal boldness but of sympathy m Mecca, and Jedda,, where people chafe under restrictions and recent Nej- dification”. . , 4 The Kind’s religious prestige has diminished as his temporal powe has grown He 'tends to fall between two stools.

Hoyal extravagance in personal expenditure might, however, pass, if royal requirements for other purposes were not so great a dram. The King’s strength and prestige must depend on his ability to pay, pay, pay. An Islamized Dutchman here not hostile to him, has expressed to me doubt as to whether the King mean&amp; to go to Nejd at all this summer. His doubt is probably unfounded but his. reasons for it are interesting. Custom demands that all who come to the King’s threshhold in Riadh should receive food, clothing and gifts. What an excellent plan then for His Majesty to put it about that he is goino th ither; let the expectant Bedouin turn their steps in that direction also° retire to Taif; and leave an eldest son to gratify as best he may the hopes of the Bedouins ! Mr. Philby again, in the conversation to which I have already referred, asked me with unusual diffidence what I thought of the financial outlook and had nothing hopeful to suggest, when I said I could not see- where any money was to come from until late in the autumn. 7. There is little in this despatch that I have not already adverted tm in special connections in other reports. In putting all the facts together in one statement, I may have painted too gloomy a picture. Jt is not the first time in Ibn Sa’ud’s history that he has been confronted with difficulties nor is there anything in his record to suggest that he would easily relinouish what he has gained. He has often been hard up and contrived to carry on His whole position was endangered by the 1929 rebellion and he came out on top My object is not to suggest that he is now on the point of collanse m tiie Hejaz but to show that his position here rests on foundations so un- stable that a strong push from any direction might upset it and that his downfall, if it.could be compassed, would not be unwelcome to the pooula- tion. however incapable..the most visible elements may be of compassino- it themselves.

Slate Trade Intelligence.—-No special intelligence has been re ceived during the month but during my stay at Jedda. Sir Andrew Ryan had full discussions with me on the subject, and gave me access to the Lega tion archives, though these revealed no information that was new to me. On my arrival, I found that Mr. Champion, the Protectorate Secretary from Aden, was staying at the Legation, and at the request of the Minis ter, a meeting was held to discuss the possibility of improving the Intelli gence service, which, Sir Andrew agrees, is the most hopeful line of deve lopment, if the work of the Sloops is to be rendered effective. The Minister was not hopeful of being able to help much, by the collec tion of intelligence in the Hedjaz, and as regards the Yemen, Mr. Cham pion said that a reply was still awaited from the Colonial Office to the pro posals put forward by the Resident Aden, last year. In the meantime, however, approval has been given for the engage ment of the additional Interpreter, skilled in the slave dialects, and it is hoped to embark him at the end of next month.

Enclo. in Foreign Office covering letter dated 15th June 1931. Letter from His Majesty s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 188, dated the 22nd May 1931. In paragraph 4 of my despatch No. 13 of January 12th relative to the celebration of the anniversary of Ibn Sa’ud’s accession, I supplied some information, which at the time did not appear important enough to record separately, regarding the attempt to create the beginnings of a regular army on European lines in this country. I have followed this experiment with some interest, as I was struck with the zeal and intelligence which Faudhi ey appeared to be bringing to his task. He told me himself something o is plans for utilizing the human material available and establishing m er a la &amp; school for Non Commissioned Officers. He seemed to be mak ing some hmg at any rate of the infantry arm and it became a common thing to see parties of the men being efficiently drilled just outside the town. 2. It was reported to me a short time, ago that Faudhi Bey had resign ed because he comd not get attention paid to his proposals and because orders were given over his head to those under his command. I had already noticed that there was no longer any drilling within sight of the Legation. I now iearn from what I believe to be an authentic source that Faudhi Bey a S K result XT of against him, in which a considerable x* 11 ' ^ tu. ’ i 0ne ® airi( ^ 1 Eey, Officer Commanding the garrison in with;***? 16 sca ^f lm ^g er ? suggested that Faudhi Bey was' intriguing ti- A P 1 ans 0 e Sherifian family and that he had been promised by bnbe of £1 ’ 00 ° 000, no less, to procure the i A r° r 5 aT T Smg ' st °ry is that he wrote a letter to Heffi? f m ?

There is, however, no proof of this thatT know of and he is certainly a trained officer with ideas of organization. The recent episode augiiiS ill for the success of the King’s efforts to build up a regu- lad army. He has now had two organizers in a space of some months. If, as my latest informant states, the Hamdi Bey mentioned above has been definitely appointed to the vacant post, the prospects of success will be poorer than ever. He was in the Turkish Army but I doubt whether he ever rose much above the rank of corporal or sergeant. He comes I think from Kur distan, but of this I am not certain. He appears to have little education. I should judge him to be a useful man in a scrap but useless as an organizer and unlikely to inspire confidence in the other officers who have passed into Ibn Sa’ud’s service. I had already heard of his capacity for intrigue and have reason to believe that he had a hand in the doings which led up to the disintegration of the Hejaz Air Force.

I doubt, how ever the Kind’s capacity for directing it with the necessary comprehen- sion and perseverance, aL still more his willingness to give any orei^ pvnert a sufficiently free hand to achieve much. As for mining the pros- pehs are even more nebulous. Until the “Umm-al-Qura” article appear ed T had heard of no definite scheme, but when the Commissioner of Po Sudan was vTsIting here early in March Mr. Philby told him that the King had decided on a geological survey of the country, with a ^w I gathe: , to concessions being eventually given subject to suitable safeguard*. 5. If Ibn Sand knows little about how to set about applying modern contrivances to the development of latent water resources, e is pto a y infinitely mode ignorant of the difficulties surrounding the location and ex ploitation of minerals in a country like this. In opinion , e c m terest at present of the matters mentioned m this despatch is the indication they afford of an inclination on Ibn Sand’s part to explore tentative^ pos sibilities of economic development. However little grasp he may ha\e the conditions necessary to achieve real success m that direction, he is q intelligent enough to realise the need for some new basis of prosperity it the country is to hold its own. So far as the Hejaz is concerned, its almost complete dependence on the pilgrimage as its sole industry is a pate source of weakness; and the weakness has never in recent years patent as during the present season, which has brought only some 4U,tuu pilgrims from overseas to Mecca. 6 I am sending copies of this despatch to the political resident m Aden,' who is interested in Mr. Twitchell, and to the Department of Over- np-v*/-i (61) (Received on 12th July 1931, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 26, dated 25th June 1931.)

I am submitting full report by bag leaving to-morrow. # . , . , . Both King and Fuad dwelt on financial situation which is so bad that assistance must be sought in some quarter The Kmg put it like t is. Exchange situation was in process of successful rehabilitation Me also required a bank which under suitable arrangements would serve the purpose of a state bank. Although he had offers from other quarters he would prefer British institution. He enquired if His Majesty s Government would help him to secure one and also if any British bank were disposed to consider the matter, if they would send representative. Matter was urgent as he must take early decision. I promised to submit the question, not excluding possibility of favourable answer, at the same time hinting at difficulty. In fact, except as a very risky experiment. I do not see on what basis any British bank would undertake business. The King may have in mind Eastern Bank as it has, I believe, been suggested to him. Probably other offers are nebulous, but Egyptian Lutfullah Bank sent a representative recently who may have made proposals. Above should be read in conjunction with my despatches Nos. 177 and 200 (Enclo to S. No. 55). All efforts to get further accommodation irom Dutch Bank have, so far as I can understand, failed.

M.’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 177 t DATED THE 15TH MaY 1931. Since I wrote my despatch No. 108 of the 23rd March (S. No. 30), the exchange situation in this country has gone through various vicissi tudes, of which it is now possible to give a more or less connected account, although no account by an outsider can be complete or at all points accurate owing to the amazing difficulty of obtaining coherent information in the conditions which prevail. 2. The arrangements with the Dutch Bank, as the Netherlands Trad ing Society is popularly called, worked for five or six weeks on the lines described in my previous despatch, i.e.. the bank sold drafts on abroad in exchano-e for rivals at 10 to the £ sterling, plus a small premium of H ourrent’piastres'i and charged for the draft a high commission, the normal rate of which was at first 1 per cent., but was afterwards raised to 2 per cent The currency remained fairly fixed at the (legal rate of £1 gold sterling to 10 riyals, equalling 220 current nickel piastres. 3 About the middle of April, however, the arrangement with the Dutch Bank broke down, apparently for two reasons, namely, that the Dov- ernment was working on a limit of £10,000 in gold for redemption pur- noses and threw hack on to the market an excessive quantity of the redeem ed silver and nickel. At this stage the Government would appear to have latdthe prohibition of the expert of by selang ' , Unrilr more or less shut down its exchange business.

The principle of this arrangement appears to be to withdraw from circulation £24,000 of nickel, the Government putting up £8,000, the merchants the rest, each of them being assessed at a stated amount. The nickel thus collected was to be held by the Ministry of Finance, and repayment of the money levied on the public was to be made at a later date. It was further decided about the 7th May to close all the shops of the money changers, who are accused of rigging the currency market. 7. The measures taken have rehabilitated nickel for the time being and, as I have said, the riyal has not fallen unduly low. Nevertheless, the situation is obviously precarious, for the crisis has occurred at what should be the period of greatest prosperity. The months between now and the beginning of the next pilgrimage season late in the autumn, when the 1932 pilgrims will begin to arrive, must necessarily be very lean months. The manager of the Dutch Bank was a very disillusioned man towards the end of April, but he was then negotiating a fresh arrangement with the Gov ernment. He did not tefl me its exact nature, but he said that the Government would have to put up £60,000 in gold to back it. After the festival he did not reopen his bank for exchange business, and rumours were afloat that the bank contemplated retirement from the countrv. On the 10th Mav, however, Mr. Jacobs told me that he was still negotiating He no longer had any doubt that the Government could dispose of any necessary amount of gold up to £60,000, but he said he was awaiting the King’s guarantee of the transaction, whatever it might be. He complained bitterly of the changeableness and incapacity of the Government. He put much of the blame on Mr. Philby, who, he said, had been dangling before the King the idea that it would be an easy matter to arrange, with his (Mr. Philby’s) assistance, to introduce another bank, which would give all the help required. 8. The situation is complicated by factors which are even further from my ken than the matters which I have attempted to summarise above in a torrn m ore intelligible than most of the reports on which my account is based there are supposed to be, for instance, some £30,000 worth of me el coins m circulation, but rumours of inflation by the importation of forged coins have been current and have helped to destroy confidence. = ° b8 T e - f fP ' S the dlfficult y o f popularising in Nejd the use of tile silver and nickel coinage current in the Hejaz. whirh ,W w' doubtless t be struck by the smallness of the amounts on £60 000 h fn crnTd 7 lm P° rtant C , nses turn ' Ifc needs at most, it appears, unlimited amount s ns am a silver currency which is legal tender to an the market TntA 1 °P e . ratlons in nickel to a total of £30,000 can throw report it is champtp &gt;• ® l0n ®- A s ^ have observed in at least one previous to P all sorts Af sidfr! to f 01 tllls f , cou ? tr y that the Government are reduced quite small liabilities P. e W1 h _what, according to our standards, are low water but I doubt wbetli 'T P brSt ^i™ 6 tbat bn ® aud bas been ' n little credit It is iust oS m tn ? f er been 80 embarrassed or had so react on his political future.' 6 the present financial situation may seas Trade 3 ™ Sencbn ° a co f^ °f tbls despatch to the Department of Over- ( 68 ) (RtCGicC’d otl 12th July 1931 with * ? 7 th725tk,tTwlT)^ ^ N °- 26 ’ d TtrEGRAM P., FROM THE FOREIGN OFFICE TO tttt?

The purposes of His Highness’s tour is to consult the best European medical opinion in regard to an internal complaint from which he is suffer ing, and to this end he proposes to visit Vienna, Paris, Berlin and kstly jLondon. 3. His Highness, who is travelling privately with an interpreter, and one personal servant, will leave Aden on the 18th June by S.S. “Cathay” for Marseilles. He has informed me that he will be unable to make definite plans for his tour until his arrival at Marseilles on the 21st June, and I have accordingly advised him to inform Your Lordship of them, and of his pro bable date of arrival in the United Kingdom, by telegraph from that place. 4. I have notified His Majesty’s Consul-General at Marseilles of His Highness’s intentions, and have requested him to assist His Highness, particularly in regard to his onward journey to and his stay in the cities he proposes to visit. I have also given His Highness letters of introduction to His Majesty’s Consuls General at Vienna, Paris and Berlin. 5. In regard to the political and financial circumstances of His High ness and the condition of affairs in his State, I have the honour to refer Your Lordship to Sir Stewart Symes’ despatches No. 195 of the 20th Octo ber 1928, and No. 13 of the 22nd January 1930 to which I have nothing to add. His Highness continues to reside in Hyderabad, Deccan, wBere he holds the position of Jemadar of the Irregular Troops of His Exalted High ness the Nizam from whom he receives an honorarium of Rs. 2,000 a month. His Highness has informed me that he proposes to spend some months at Mukalla on his return from Europe. 6. I have the honour to recommend that His Highness may be accorded all such customs and other facilities and assistance as it may be possible to grant him during his stay in England, particularly in view of his limited knowledge of European travel and conditions.

In my despatch No. 200 of May _28th, I attempted to review situation in this country with special reference ] 436(C) F&amp;PD* WV,' ^liisi» r ■ [ijaGov® I»s( ^tof India ;giissioM r 4 My la i’s jonra to the fteroecui from Neid and its Dependencies. Now that Ibn Sa ud has gone to Riadh and I myself am about to go on leave, I should like to bring the review up to /date. , 2 It is generally felt that the King, having concentrated ins attention on the affairs of the Hejaz for over a year, his first prolonged stay in tins part of his dominions since he completed his conquest of it, has left those affairs in a hopeless mess. It is even suggested by some that he has run away from them. I understand that the situation has gi\en rise to extra vagant rumours abroad, one of them being that His Majesty had decided to adbicate in favour of his son Faisal, presumably in the Hejaz of which that prince is Viceroy, or in favour of both his elder sons fea ud and laisal. A report in the latter sense, published in a Cairo newspaper, was formally contradicted in the “Umm-al-Qura” of July 10th. 3 The feeling one has at present is a sense, not of greater apparent trouble than in May, but of a lack of central direction. The Hejaz has been left like a water-logged and half-dismantled ship without any parti cular signs of a wind to blow it either into port or to destruction. It is hard to say who is governing the country. The King is too far away and probably too fed up not to be glad of a rest from the Hejaz. The young Viceroy has been too much in the background of late to make it possible to judge of his capacity for affairs. Among the “statesmen” the two most important factors are Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, who is strong, and Fuad Bey Hamza, who is active and industrious. It remains to be seen whether this not very happily assorted triumvirate can carry on until next pilgrim age. 4. I can add nothing to what I said in paragraph 3 of my despatch under reference regarding the situation in the interior. There is the same anxiety about it in the towns. The same rumours float about, occasionally perhaps a little more precise but usually fantastic. In the imagination of the quidnuncs of Mecca and Jedda, Jauf “falls” periodically, no one knows into whose hands. A recent rumour has filled the lacuna in the case of Tebuk, which was said to have fallen “to the rebels”. 5. In paragraph 4 of my previous despatch, I referred to the King’s religious position. There has been an interesting development in this con nection. It became known towards the end of June that he had made con cessions to bis extremists. He allowed to be published in the “Umm-al-Qura” of June 26th a long remonstrance addressed to him by the Ulama of Nejd regarding the repetition this year of the Accession Day celebrations insti tuted m January 1930. The writers claimed politely but firmly that it was f 1 ^ ^ ail , duty to call the King’s attention to the irreligiousness of ceie ramonsw ich they bad condoned in 1930 as there might be political reasons for them but the perpetuation of which could not he tolerated.

P V heS With the financial situation and ot tne National Conference (F.-191-N./31), I need notdwell on them further here, except to mention one side-effect of the financial and economic difficulties which may have some political importance. The King vvas casting about in many directions before he left with a view to raising the wind in foreign quarters. The Soviet representative seems to have taken a hand in the game and is reported to have sold 50,000 cans of benzine to the Government on easy terms. More than this cannot be affirmed but Monsieur Turakulov’s deal has naturally given rise to rumours that the ffejazi Government have come to terms with the Bolsheviks on a more exten sive basis.. I am asking Mr. Hope Gill to watch for any developments in this direction, though at present I see no evidence of more than a commer cial transaction and doubt whether, there is much to come of it. 8. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Secretary to the Govern ment of India in the Foreign and Political Department, ,His Majesty’s High Commissioner at Jerusalem, the Acting High Commissioner at Baghdad and the Acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I v ( 81 ) (Received on 16th August 1931, with Political Secretary's letter No. P. Z - 31, dated 30th July 1931.) Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 225„ dated the 16th June 1931. I had the honour to report in my despatch No. 102 of May 4th (S. No. 60) on the visit to the Hejaz of an American engineer named Twitchel! who came here in April, under, the auspices of Mr. Charles R. Crane, to study water possibilities in the Hejaz and apparently minig prospects as well. My later information confirmed my belief that the first of Mr. Twit- chell’s journeys was confined to the immediate neighbourhood of Jedda. The second, however, was more extensive as will be seen from the enclosed translation of an article in the “Umm-al-Qura” of May 15th. A few days after that date Mr. Twitchell returned to Jedda, submitted reports and was,, I believe, received by the King at a place in the country between this and Mecca. He and his wife left Jedda about May 31st. 2 The information in the enclosed article regarding water was amplified by a long article in the “Umm-al-Qura” of May 29th purporting to give the text of Mr. TTvitchell’s main report on that branch of his investigations. Mr Twitchell came to people bemused by the blessed word Artesian, which leaps gratefully to Arab lips, probably because it makes a perfectly beau tiful broken plural in Arabic—irtiwaziya. That is doubtless why he begins his report by pointing out that an Artesian well is one in which under ground water rises under its own pressure, although not necessarily all the way to the earth’s surface. He explains that this type of supply seldom or never occurs in the region he visited. He contemplates the raising of water by ordinary pumping apparatus and suggests that the prevalence of big winds would enable water to be pumped up from wells which need not be very deep, at an extremely low cost. He gives a list of six areas or water points which he visited and deals in some detail with wo, V jV 1 , j r Salam and the Wadi Fatma, in both of which he ground »*&gt;'' whl, ; h *S be oulth.M would it ’srxf'SS bamboo beans grounds nuts and potatoes. He adds that these are his pt Damooo, beans, g desired to make experimental farms, sonal suggestions but that, it it were uesirea tu ma ^ . the Department of Agriculture at Washmgtou would be pleased to give advice and to supply suitable seeds.65 3. The report that gold and petroleum had been discovered created a pleasurable flutter but details have not so far been published. Mr. Philby told me a couple of weeks ago that the discovery of these minerals was merely a rediscovery of what was already known to exist. I am unable to check this with the means at my disposal here but it will doubtless be pos sible to do so in London. As regards petroleum Mr. Philby referred vaguely to a passage in one of the older works, he thought Burton. In connection with gold he referred to a concession formerly granted to Midian (or Madian) Limited, a concern in which he said he had some little holding. 4. Mr. Philby added a statement of some interest. He said that not long ago the King had said in a moment of expansion that he would grant a concession for all the minerals in the country to any one who would give him a million pounds. Mr. Philby then or later, according to his own account, asked whether the King meant business, in which case some thing practical might be arranged, without plunging into millions. On receiving a favourable reply he had communicated with Midian Limited, but had steered the matter in such a way that the further correspondence should be direct between the company and the Government here. 5. All this tends to confirm what I said in para. 5 of my despatch under reference. Even if Mr. Twitchell has only rediscovered previous dis coveries, his visit has had the effect of stimulating interest in certain economic possibilities. I still doubt, however, whether Ibn Sa’ud will face up to the essential condition of any successful effort to determine what is economically exploitable and to render the exploitation a practical proposition, namely, the employment of foreign experts, even trained experts of Arab blood, who might perhaps be found. All that can be said at present is that the pos sibility of his doing so cannot be excluded, as he is evolving rapidly under pressure of his present difficulties. Meanwhile I understand that the question of developing new economic resources was one of those referred to the National Conference of representatives from Hejazi towns which sat in Mecca from June 2nd to June 11th. I have reported elsewhere on this conference but do not as yet know what it achieved. ^ J 121 a ddressing this report to the Foreign Office as in the present state ot this country the economic situation is even more closely connected with the general political situation than in more normal countries.

I leanit later that fere me to be four principal functions to which foreign representatives wen. invited As the head of the only mission of first-class political importance here I felt that any abstention on my part would be seriously misinterpreted in Jedda and Mecca especially as 1 had had no previous opportunity of meeting tfe Emir Feisal, who now combines the functions of Minister for Foreign Affairs with those of Viceroy of the liejaz. 1 therefore accepted the various mvita- -Hons One of the social functions projected, a tea party at Kandara on the afternoon of the 8th, was in the event countermanded. Although no express reason was given, I was told privately by Fuad Bey Hamza that this change in the programme was intended as a mark of respeei to the memory ot the Princess Royal. I foil: it all the more incumbent on me to attend the other functions. In my private letter thanking Fuad Bey and expressing satisfac tion I added that the gesture of the local authorities would be greatly appreciated in England, and explained that I was interrupting a period, ot mourning for an event deeply felt at home in order to be present at the various celebrations. 3. On the morning of the 8th January, my colleagues and I called on the Acting Governor of Jedda. Early in the afternoon the Emir Feisal. gave me a special interview, which had been arranged by Fuad Bey. His Royal Highness was very civil and very nervous. I cannot say that, my first im pression of him was favourable. He has the fine features of his familv and he does not show in his face the signs of dissipation which I expected. He lacks, however, both the charm and the physique of his father and his elder brother, the Emir Sand- In repose he wears a look of jaded melancholy and listlessness, and his smiles, though agreeable, are sickly. In my own slight intercourse with him on the 8th and 9th January, he gave little evidence of keenness or intelligence, though I noticed that wfith his ov r n entourage he seemed confident and quick in decision. The interpreter wdiom he employed at my private interview was incapable. I had not intended to talk much business on such an occasion and, owing to the difficulty of getting anything of importance translated, I limited myself still further. I enquired as to wiiether my letters to. Fuad Hamza and the King in connexion with the proposed visit of Colonel Biscoe had been forwarded to Riadh and when they might he expected to arrive. The Prince said that he had forwarded the letters, but his reply to my second question v r as hopelessly vague. My only other attempt at business was to appeal to the Prince on behalf of two prisoners, one a British Indian, who has neeii detained too long on a doubtful charge, the other, a Hadrami, who mav be guilty of a serious offence,, hut w r ho appears to have been barbarously treated. 1 emoxed hie custom oi using clemency on royal anniversaries and the Prince promised to look into the two cases. r ^ ie rev * ew bold by the Emir Feisal at Kandara on the afternoon of the Mil January, presented features of interest.

It had been intended that' Urey should approach when the camelry went back to barracks, but the arrangements tor this miscarried and as no signalling bad been arranged the aerial display was rather tame. 5. Tire first day ended with a dinner of about 120 covers at Kandara. The Emir, who was to liave presided, excused himself at the last moment on grounds of slight indisposition. Otherwise, the arrangements were excellent. Only two speeches were allowed. The first and more, important consisted of a lengthy review of Ibn Sand’s efforts in various directions. International relations were touched on and reference was made to the rapprochement with Iraq result ing from the meeting of the two Kings on board H.M.S. “ Lupin.’'’ It was remarked that no mention was made of Egypt, an omission the more striking as it is understood that recent negotiations, though their scope and prospects' of success have been exaggerated, have afforded promise of a better understanding between Egypt and the Hejaz. The Soviet Minister said a few words in Arabic at the end of dinner in reply to the references which had been made to the diplomatic representatives. 6. Mr. Hope-Grill and I started early on the 10th January for Wadv Fatma to attend the celebration organised there by the municipality of Mecca. The programme was a heavy one. There were some twenty-four speeches, poems and set pieces recited by schoolboys, before and after luncheon. The Emir Feisal presided with hardly concealed boredom, though he was himself the object of the most eloquent eulogies. He was at his best with some children of the Royal family, including his own son, who flitted in and out of the reception tent. One of the items was a set piece welcoming the Prince and the foreign representatives, delivered in English by a Mecca schoolboy. His nervousness contrasted strongly with the aplomb of his comrades, who produced their Arabic effusions from lungs of bronze, and he boggled sadly, poor child, over the hard word “ representatives.” Another interesting school item was a case heard before the Cadi between advocates of pen and sword. The sword was very large and the pen very little. The Cadi, in a nicely-balanced judgment, declared them both' to he servants of equal utility as such, and reconciled the advocates in a handshake. One poet gracefully compared the Emir and the diplomatic representatives to the moon surrounded by stars. His comparison was apter than he knew, for our Minister for Foreign Affairs is a great but pallid and elusive luminary and we, the stars, are very fixed in Jedda. The proceeding’s were punctuated by choral performances. Singing does not appear to rank as forbidden music, and one of the chants was intro duced as the “ Song of the Fatherland.” At least 200 guests sat down to an excellent luncheon served at one long table in a marquee. The day ended wita a fantastic war dance by Nejdi tribesmen, a barbaric pantomime full of hie and colour. At the outset the dance centred on a gigantic Royal Standard, but before long standard and standard-bearer were dancing with the most active. 7. Not only had Egypt been ignored in the speech of the evening, but the Egyptian consul had been given^ a comparatively poor place at table. I ese circumstances may account for his absence from the vv ady f atma pai }• Some other diplomatic abstentions were due to indisposition and weie ess hoticeable. 8. I apologise for the length at which I have described these proceedings. They are worthy of attention for various reasons. It was suggested last year that’ such a celebration was un-Islamie. The contrary view has tnumphed Secondly, no one present could fail to be struck by the eleinen _ propaganda and the strong insistence on his successes as hemg g achievements. Lastly, the element of compromise between Wahabi strictness and European ideas, which Mr. Bond noticed last year, was again cen -&gt; present. The intervals for prayer were duly observed, but th y|^ ln ® absence many members of bis entourage strolled with us under he patos and smoked freely in our company. Although the music at the Wady Fatma partyV - v * 18 \M .t, was all sung; the inhabitants of the district used musical instruments undis turbed within earshot of us, nor was there any lack of drums in the war dance.

The Question of Hodiyada Port. —A report received early in July 1930, confirmed that King Ibn Saud would not return to Nejd this year but would remain two or three months in the Hejaz and then go to the Gizan of Yemen to attend to the settlement of the dispute between him and Imam Yehia over the question of Hodiyada Port. In the meanwhile Ibn Saud has a representative at Gizan who is keeping him well informed of affairs there. It is clear that he considers El Hodiyada as a part of El Aseer which is one of his dependencies, and is reported to have stated openly that if the Imam Yehia does not give it up by peace, he will take it by war. Before leaving Nejd, the King issued orders to the Amirs of Hayel, Bridah, Enizah, Shaarah, Dawadnah, Morad, El Kafr and El Hassah to be ready with troops in case he should call them to his Headquarters at El Taif. Internal Situation in the I emen. —A good deal of hatred exists between the sons of Imam YYhia and their Father. Seif el Islam Mohamed has not yet met his father smee his return from Italy in 1927. It is reported that Mahmoud Nadim Bay (the previous Turkish Walrv of Yemen) succeeded in making peace once betw een the sons and tl efr father, but Abdalla El Em ari (the Imam’s Chief Minister) has since mMe things worse again. people of Yemen are not satisfied with the rule of their Imam and a delegation representing El Zaranik tribe was lately received bv King Ibn Saud who promised to take their territory under his protection as requested by them. ^ Italy and the Yemen.

There appears to be little doubt that a secret treaty exists between United Soviet Socialist Republic and Ibn Sand as well as between Repub licand Imam Yehia. wish the that Germany and the Yemen.~One of Germany’s chief Agents is an Egyptian named Mohamed El Salah El Kajar, who works in Cairo as a representative of the “ United. German Engineering Works Junkers Borsig Hall, Ltd. ” He has an office in the Khedivial Buildings—Sharia Emal-el-Din. He has been several times to the Yemen, usually with Hasan Anis Pasha of Cairo, and has been instrumental i i connecting Imam Yehia with the U. S. S. R. through the Soviet Consm at Paris. Through him, the Imam bought two German ( Junkers) aeroplanes, one of which has since crashed. El Najar often goes to Berlin, where he was educated. He is the son of Sheikh Abdel Wahab el Najar (Vice-President of the Young.Mens Moslem Association of Cairo) who was also in Hejaz this year and who promised Ibn Saud to work in organising the Pan-Islamic societies. Supply of arms to Ibn Saud .—King Ibn Saud gets any amount of arms and ammunition from Germany through his agents who receive a high com- misskm from th ' German companies. These companies are known to be “ Stephen and Heyman ”, “ Hackthal Dracht und Kabel Worke A. G. Hanover ”, and the “ Wegner Oriental Company ”. Last year when Ibn Saud was fighting Felsal-el-Dawish, a German steamer unloaded at Je ddah 3,000,000 rounds of ammunition and 3,000 rifles which were immediately despatched to the King m 250 cars. (b) Reports from R. A. F. Sources—Palestine and Transjordan. Arab Officers for the Yemen Army. —About the time that the information from Mecca was received, it was reported from Amman that a Syrian named Ha^san Tassin Pasha living in Damascus and who is a prominent member or the Syrian Independence Party, had received a letter through King Ali, son of ex-King Hussein, from Imam Yahia requesting him to come to the Yemen and bring several well-trained Arab Officers to organise the Yemen forces and help to resist Ibn Saud. The Pasha accepted the offer and made terms of service and with the Imam. The whole party were to go to Sanna via Aden m an a i n Ship and their passports were arranged for by the Italian Consul in Beirut. On July 3rd, the Pasha and twenty-five “ Effendia ” sailed from Beirut. Tneir destination, however, was kept secret. A telegram was received about the same time by the Italian Doctor in Amman from Aden askii g him to instruct one, Doctor Shabunda, to proceed to Sanna with medical outfits as soon as possible. The purchase of armoured cars by Ibn ,SawI.— Ttwas r&lt; portOj yan Azrak Agent through Amman on July 3lst that Ibn Sa 'd ‘ _ Middl() Armoured Cars and eight ordinary cars from Egyp • ,d as a' result of East, Cairo, were asked to confirm the report, if poss.ble, and as a investigations in Cairo and London it was learned that Ibn c baud n^ placed an order last November with Messrs. Re^ult^ i^ E - at armoured cars and foui 6-wheel lonies. T Jeddah, however, had so far not been reported. (c) Public Rumours and Press Statements. Armed forces at Tebuh During the flrsUort ^ raflg _j ord S an- rumnurs were rife regarding intended attacks nyr«I '?*’«*»»» It was Stated that a force of 1,500 had arrived at Tebuk and that forces were concentrating in the Geraya District. Agents sent- out to these localities returned with the information that there was no truth whatever in the rumours. At Tebuk all was quiet and normal and in Geraya District it was learned that 500 rifles had been distributed to the Nejd Shararat Tribe by / the Amir of Kaf in order that they might protect themselves against raids by Transjordan tribes. Hitherto, this tribe has had very few arms and little or no ammunition. Statements in the Press. —Rumours reached culminating point when articles appeared in the English and Egyptian Press. The statements, however, were officially denied by the Representative of the Kingdom of IRjaz, Nejd and Dependencies, in Egypt, in a cablegram to the Editor of the Daily Mail as follows :— “ The news published by 3 7 our newspaper and reproduced by “ A1 Mokattan ” that there might be serious trouble on the borders of Palestine which would be provoked by H. M. King Iba Sand and that H. M.’s plans were complete for an assault on Transjordan, is completely unfounded. His Majesty’s Govern ment has never had any such intentions.” Intercepted WfT Message. —The truth of this dementi is further confiimed in an Arabic cipher wireless message intercepted on 29th August 1930 from H. M. King Ibn Saud to his representative in Jauf, a parapnrused version of which reads :— “ The Chiefs in Transjordan are restraining their tribes from raiding and causing disturbances. Are you also preventing all your Arabs from carrying out any raids either private or public. If you hear of any of your Aiabs raiding you must punish them.” The reply to His Majesty on 30th August 1930, which was also inter cepted, read :—“ We are restraining all our Arabs and they have no intention of pillaging or raiding. Onr area is as quie t t and safe as we could wish for, for which thanks are due to God and you.” {d) Report from Jeddah. Visit of Ibn Saud to Jeddah. —Early in September, it was reported from Jeddah that Ibn Saud had paid a visit there on September 2nd to open the new Custom House (by no means completed) but obviously in connection with the consignment of 10,C00 mausers and ammunition landed from S. S. “ Cracow ”. While in Jeddah, His Majesty witnessed a secret demonstration shoot by a Polish expert with a new 45 mills camel gun. The arms and ammunition were rumoured as destined for Transjordan, but the report stated they were actually going by camel to Mecca. (e) Conversations with Pilots of Hejaz Air Force. During the passage of the Hejaz Air Porce Pilots and Aircraft through Amman, I had conversations while there on September 6th with the pilots, who all believe that their transfer to Jeddah is in connection with the Yemen situation. Rumours, they say, wore strong of intended action by Ibn Saud. They had not heaid anything about a possible demonstration by Ibn Saud against Transjordan and thought it most unlikely. 'p 16 ^ er, i® r Pilot of the Hejaz Air Force stated that Ibn Saud had at first issued orders for bombs to be carried on the aircraft, but later altered his decision on being told that the extra weight would encumber the aircraft on the journey.I 98 * fomenti is I- sd on ijj Jauf, aparsfi inbes {[on k I so pre?elii either p;ii ch S5 His real reason for objecting, the senior pilot mentioned, was that he did not like the idea of carrying bombs over friendly countries. He thought that Ibn Saud’s reasons for carrying bombs were that a supply would be available on arrival if required. All four aeroplanes were equipped with bomb racks, but rone carried front or rear guns, nor were they equipped with the necessary fittings. (/) Conclusion. In conclusion, it can reasonably be assumed bom the information contained in the above reports that if Ibn Saud has any intentions of becoming aggressive in the near future, such aggression is likely to be directed against the Yemen and not against Transjordan. This assumption is based on the following factors:— (i) The presence of Ibn Saud in Mecca and his prolonged stay there. (ii) His coveted possession of the Port of Hodiyada, and open state ment regarding its acquisition by force if not by peace. {iii) The recent supply of arms and ammunition from the S. S. 44 Cracow ”. (iv) The official dementi of rumours regarding any attacks on Transjordan, and the confirmation by agents and intercepted wireless messages of the truth of such dementi. (v) The request of the Imam Yehia to Hassin Tassin Pasha to bring trained Arab officers to the Yemen to organise his forces to resist Ibn Saud. U (vi) The transfer of the Hejaz Air Force to Jeddab and the informa tion obtained from the Pilots. As regards Transjordan, it is not impossible that action might be taken this winter by Ibn Saud. Such action, it is expected, would take the form of a strong raid and be in the nature of a reprisal for the raids by Trans jordan tribes during the year. 3F MM if msly inw : id o Mecca. B FoecJ.

I havehonour to refer to paragraph 4 of yoar despatch Ho. 131, dated 13th September 1930 to the Foreign Office (a copy of which was received under cover of your Memorandum No. 19, dated 16th ultimo), respecting an incident between Dr. Prufer and the local Police here. A careful enquiry has been made. It appears that a certain Herr Paul Beer, an Austrian artist notified his intention to visit Aden for the purpose of making sketches* He enquired whether any restrictions were likely to be put on hit movements for this purpose. In order to relieve him of anxiety on this point a junior Police Officer was instructed to meet him on arrival and to explain that apart from certain prohibited areas in the fortifications, he could sketch wherever he liked. The Officer boarded the ship for this pms pose and, most unfortunate^, mistook Dr.. Prufer for Herr Paul Beer, and delivered his message to the former. The Officer reported it to the Com mandant of Police who, hearing that Dr. Prufer had seemed much amused and had replied that he was not a painter, dismissed the matter from his mind. I may also mention that Dr. Prufer when dining with Colonel Reilly at this Residency did not refer to the incident in any way. 2. I have sent this full explanation and would a^k, if you see no objec tion that it may be transmitted to Dr. Prufer with an expression of sincere regret that he should have so erroneously received the impression that the Authorities here or the local Police had the smallest doubt of his bona fides^ Enclo. 2 to Serial No. 97. Letter from the British Legation, Addis Ababa, to the Charge d’affaires, Germany, dated the 10th October 1930. In the course of our recent conversation, when you were good enough to convey to me a message from Dr. Prufer on the subject of his visit to Sanaa, you mentioned that an incident had occurred with the Aden Police en route. As I was at a loss to understand how such an incident could have occurred in view of the fact that Dr. Prufer had written to me to say that he had had a very friendly reception at Aden, I made enquiries of the Resident from whom I have now received the following reply :— “ A careful enquiry has been made and it appears that a certain Herr Paul Beer, an Austrian artist, notified his intention to visit Aden for the purpose of making sketches. He enquried whe ther any restrictions were likely to be put on his movements for this purpose. In order to relieve him of his anxiety on this point a junior Police Officer was instructed to meet him on arrival and to explain that apart from certain prohibited areas in the fortifications, he could sketch wherever he liked.

The Resident asks that this full explanation may be transmitted to Hr* Pinfer with an expression of sincere regret that he should have so erroneous ly received the impression that the Authorities at Aden or the local Police had the smallest doubt of his bona fides. I should accordingly be grateful if you would inform Dr. Prufer of the above.aaiea (Received on 29th November 1930, with Political Secretary's letter No. 46, the 13th November 1930.) Letter from His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda, to The Foreign Office, No. 28?, dated the 18th October 1930. The “ Umm-al-Qura ” of October 3rd published a summary of the Hejaz-Nejd Government’s achievements during the past twelve months which I think it may be useful to record briefly, if somewhat literally, as follows: — I. Foreign Relations. (1) The establishment of political contact ” with Germany, Poland, Persia, and Afghanistan, i.e., the recognition of the Hejaz- Nejd Government. (2) The conclusion of treaties with Germany, Turkey, and Persia; (3) The meeting of King Ibn Sa’ud with King Faisal in the Persian Gulf which laid the foundations of a settlement of past difficul ties between this country and Iraq and opens up a hopeful view of the future. (4) The raising by Foreign Powers of the rank of their representatives at Jedda to that of Minister. (5) The establishment of a Hejaz-Nejd Legation in London. II. Domestic Affairs. (1) Royal opening of the new Legative Council. (2) Defeat of rebels, restoration of complete internal order, and re organization of the Police. (3) Reformation of Government Departments and constitution of an Inspectorate of Departments. (4) Improvement of facilities for pilgrims and constitution of a pilgri mage Committee. .. - . (5) Increase in the number of schools and of scholars sent to study in (6) Establishment of a Government Motor repair shop, and of the “ Kiswa ” carpet factory at Mecca. (7) Importation by Government of well machinery which has eneour- ' ' Led private individuals to follow suit, (8) Publication and free distribution of a work on agriculture written ' ' by a prominent Medina land owner.

I am informed, however, that the general trend of the reports we have received from our Legation at Jedda during the last few months suggests that there is no special likelihood of an outbreak of hostilities between Ibn Sand and the Imam, and that, while it is of course impossible to prophesy what developments the situation may take in future, there is at present no reason for anxiety. Enclo. to Serial No. 108. LETTER FROM THE FOREIGN OFFICE, TO THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT, No. 1311, DATED THE 27tH NOVEMBER 1930. The Italian Ambassador, in the course of an interview with Sir Robert Vansittart on November 26th, enquired whether His Majesty’s Government had received any information regarding the reported annexation by King Ibn Saud of the Hejaz and Nejd of the Emirate of Asir. His Excellency referred to the understanding with the Italian Government reached as a result of Sir G. Clayton’s conversations in February 1927 (see Your Excellency’s despatch No. 193 of March 11th of that year), under which it was agreed that it is in the common interests of the two Governments to pursue a policy of pacification, and to exercise their influence with the various rulers concerned with a view to eliminating causes of . conflict. The Italian Government were anxious to know whether His Majesty’s Govern ment had any reason to regard the recent developments as likely to lead to a deterioration of the situation. 2. In reply, Sir R. Vansifctart gave Monsieur Bordenaro the substance of the first paragraph of telegram No. 831 of November 25th from His92 Maiestv’s Chargi d’Affaires at Jedda, a copy of which is enclosed herein for Sentence of reference. The second paragraph ot the telegram was not communicated to His Excellency, since to communicate such unconfirmed reworts to the Italian Government might merely have increased their anxiety ^ In a situation which does not at present appear, in actual fact, to contain serious elemeuts of danger. Sir R. Vansittart subsequently wrote to Monsieur Bordenaro the private letter of which a copy is also enclosed (109) (Received on 13th December 1930, with Political Secretary's letter No. 48, dat ed the 27th November 1930.) Telegram from the British Consul, Antwerp, to the Foreign Office, No. 6, DATED THE 21ST NOVEMBER 1930.

Telegram from His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jedda to the Foreign Office, No. 229, dated the 23rd November 1930, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me verbally on November 20th of King Hussein’s death but without comment. He is commonly said to have expiessed wish to be buried at Mecca. If so, it would be regarded by Moslems as binding on his sons. I am advised that there would be no grounds for Wahabite objection but that on the other hand no precedent exists. It seems probable however that Ibn Saud would be led by political considerations to refuse.

We shall be glad to know whether you have received a reply from Jeddah on the subject of the Nejd Government officials exceeding the limits of their duties. We are now informed that on 12th July 1930, Mut’ib ibn Hijris, of the 'TJtaiba tribe, and Hashim al-Ahji, of Shammar tribe, arrived at an Nakldb place, within Iraq territory, alleging that they belong to H. M. King Ibn Sa’ud and that they were sent to Iraq by ibn ’Athil, H. M. agent to inform thq Najdi tribes in Iraq to return to Nejd and to pay the taxes due by them to the Nejd Government. Two letters, the first from His Majesty Ibn Sa’ud and the second from Tim Musa’id, the Amir of Rail, were found in possession of the above-mentioned two persons. The entrance of Nejdi officials to the Iraq territory for asking Nejdi tribe* to return to their country, and for the collection of taxes from them, is contrary to the agreements concluded between the two countries and to the international usage. There is nothing which prevents the Nejd Government from issuing their orders to their tribes camping in Iraq through the Iraq authorities con cerned.

In forwarding these documents, with a request that I should brino* them to the -notice of His Majesty the King, Sir Francis requested me to protest against tiie acti\ dies of certain individuals, named in the memorandum, who profess to act on behalf of the Rejaz-Nejd Government. Sir Francis Kumphrys draws particular attention to the authoritative tone of the letter to Abdul Itazzaq ibn Nallaf and the definite threats of punishment therein addressed to an Iraq subject, who is a Sheikh of the Dhalir tribe and was at the time encamped at Rafa’iyah near Basra. Sir Francis considers that Ihe Iraq Government have good reason for protesting against the despatch of such a letter, if genuine, both on that ground and as being contrary to Article 5 of the Bahra Agreement. Sir Francis asks me to say that he feels sure that some misunderstanding must have occurred. He is convinced that His Majesty the King would not have authorised the despatch of a letter of this nature if he had been fully aware of the facts as described above. 1 think Your Excellency will also appreciate the fact that the unauthorised fhitry of subordinate Nejd officials into Iraq territory in the manner described, hi the enclosed memorandum is contrary to international usage and likely to embarrass the good relations, between Nejd and Iraq which we have all been trying so hard to cement. I have no doubt that His Majesty will cause urgent orders to lie issued to prevent the recurrence of such incidents.

With reference to your letter No. 1717|583[83 of Gth August 1930 (12-3-1349) enclosing a memorandum from the Government of fraq concerning certain aggressions attributed to certain Nejd officials, I have the honour to inform Y our Excellency of the following :— 1. The allegations made in the Iraq memorandum as to the property looted hy Mutlaq ibn Zamel from al Asi ibn Hasan will be investigated, and when the crime is proved the looted property will he returned to its owner and the criminal will be punished as he deserves. 2. As to the other allegations therein mentioned regarding certain officials crossing the Iraq frontier, I can divide that (question) into two parts. Firstly : : entering Iraq territories with the intention of getting into touch with; the Iraq officials or of meeting the Administrative Inspector of the Iraq side With a view to homing to a mutual understanding on certain unimportant matters. Secondly r Officials entering for some other reasons. As to the first part, I do not think it calls for a protest or (should cause) any displeasure as it is a legal action and] carried out with the sole intention of settling certain unimportant matters as quickly as possible. As to the second part, most careful investigation will he made with a view to ascertaining the reasons for which it was done ; because, as is well known, His Majesty’s Government (the Hejaz Government) protect this principle hy all means in their power and cannot agree to accept its non-observance. 3. There remains for me to explain to you the truth concerning the letter alleged to have been sent to Abdnrrazzaq ibn Halaf. The copy sent by you to me, which is supposed to have been despatched by His Majesty the King, is a true copy, but His Majesty the King never intended to send the letfer to Ibn Halaf, neither did he want it to he sent to him in the Iraq territories. The origin of this letter is that His Majesty my Lord the King on his- return from the Lupin Gonference, promised to order that raiding against Iraq should be prevented ami to declare that the situation between Nejd and Iraq was very good. So he wrote from this letter several thousands of copies to be distributed amongst all Bedouins and more especially (amongst those) in the vicinity of the frontiers. His Majesty had given some copies of that letter without mentioning the name of any addressee. It appears that the messenger who carried that letter wrote the name of Ibn -Halaf on it, and perhaps he presumed that Ihn Halaf was in Nejd territory so he addressed it in his name. This is the letter which you have received. I hope this explanation of the matter will suffice. (Received on 19th October 1930, with Political Secretary's letter Ho. 40, dated .2nd October 1930).

I sent an officer inshore in a boat during the forenoon, to see if any formation cpuld be obtained, but without success. One native appeared anxious to talk, but was quickly suppressed by the Imam’s soldiery. The next night was spent at anchor off Sheik Seyd, but it was too rough to send the boats away, and no zambuqs were seen to cross the Straits. . Alter carrying out a day patrol, I entered Perim about midday, and re mained till alter dark the following day when I left with the ship darkened, and patrolled to the S. L. of Sheik Seyd, anchoring and sending away the boats off S tiki air On approaching the coast to anchor, about 1 a.m., an intermittent white light was seen ashore, and next morning this proved to be the camp lire of some wandering Bedouins. These men were in the Aden Protectorate, but had come from the interior, and disclaimed all allegiance to any ruler. ^ Sakiah is reported as being a landing place for slaves embarked to the North of Ras al Bir, during the period of Northerly winds. Whilst at 1 eriin, the Resident told me that he had received news of a party of slaves having been landed about two months ago, after being embarked to the South of Raheita. They were destined for Loheiya and Habil. On the 4th 1 carried out a day patrol to the Eastward, but the wind and sea were very high, and with no shelter on the coast. I decided to proceed to Aden, and entered the harbour just before dark. A curious phenomenon was encountered during the evening. The wind was blowing about force 4 on the starboard quarter, when without the slightest wanting it suddenly shifted right ahead with the same velocity. The effect on the sea was very curious. 3. ddcro—-The usual calls were exchanged with the Acting Resident, »... he had no special news. I discussed the question of visits to ports in the Yemen tV v langed to pay a call at Khaukha, a rising port to the South of Ilodieda, when ormortnnitv nffproP blit r ^ a .

Khaukha and on patrol.-Atter stopping a good many zaralmqs durinl the day, 1 proceeded North, and carried out a night patrol off Yactul 1 it nothing suspicions was observed. Next day I proceeded to Khaukha, and met With a most friendly reception. ’ On arrival, an officer was sent inshore, and the local Governor Syed AH bin AH, who represents the Imam, and the local Sheikh Abdullah Mohsine, accom panied by several other local notables, came onboard. They sent off a’ present of fowls and eggs, and after being entertained onboard and showed round the ship, J landed with them to return their call. Khauklia is a growing place, with a good export trade, and skilled boat builders, who were seen at work repairing dhows hauled up on the beach. The Governor was delighted with my visit, but would not be satisfied until I stayed to eat his midday dinner with him. The village is about a mile inland, camels and mules being provided for the journey. A large camel caravan was resting in the square, and I believe that a great deal of the export trade from Hodieda is being diverted to Khaukiia. My visit, and the fact that I had eaten with them, was reported to the Imam at once, at Sanaa, hy telegraph, and I left amongst protestations of undying friendship. The Governor assured me that whenever lie saw the ship again, lie would com® off at once, but that when he had seen us before, he had not liked to do so. His gift was acknowledged by a suitable present of tinned fruits, with which he was delighted, -—- AiHunffimvimy Khiaikha, night patrol was carried out off Sakiah, but nothing suspicious was seen ; this was not really surprising as it was near the time of the full moon, and the slave dealers are said to move only when the moon is not shining. Approval having been received for my proposed visit to French Somaliland I cruised off the French coast next day, outside territorial waters, and examined the shore near Has Siyan and Khor Angar. The consent of the Governor of French Somaliland to my visit was re ceived about noon on the 16th, so I proceeded South to Obokh, and was able to examine the whole of the coast line on the way. I entered Obokh just before sunset. 6. Obokh- —Whilst looking imposing from the sea, Obokh is a dead town, with all the houses in ruins or falling down. There are no European inhabitants, although M. de Manfned has a bimgxv low there. i -i j The French guard is in charge of an Arafrsergeant ^10 came rndwarf, and offered to do anything for me that he could.

His Excellency was most friendly, and said that he hoped I should be well enough to receive him next morning, when he would come to return my call. He came off next day, and was accorded a salute of 17 guns on leaving the ship The“ sual calls were exchanged with Mr. Lowe, the British Vice-Consul. M Chappon-Baissac has been going through an unpleasant time recently, .,S he has been held up to extreme ridicule m the columns of the Matin ”. It appears that a journalist, Joseph Kessel, accompanied, by a naval lieutenant and an armv doctor were sent out by the paper, ostensibly tounvestwhe the Stnt of tte Slave trade in French Somaliland and Abyssinia and as them -friend and guide they chose the notorious de Manfned. On arrival at Djibouti, Kessel went to call on His Excellency, accompanied bv de Manfried. Not unnaturally M. Chappoi^Ba^sae refused Hitter, and'tlien decliiied to give permission^foi’ the expedition to proceed inland from Tadjura, saying that lie could not guarantee then sa e y. U XClUJUJLClj ^ T 1* The interview seems to have ended stormily, and after spending sometime in Abyssinia Kessel took his expedition across country from the neighbou- hood of Dire^laoua in Abyssinia, right through the forbidden regions, imi e e guidance of de Manfried, managing to avoid the patrols sent out by the Gov to arrest them.

One dhow I stopped had been three days trvn£ to get round the Cape, into the Straits. ^ . ... ^ and Bas Siyan. The charts are of no use iOr tins pait ot the coast, but it turns out to be almost similar to the Arabian roast, with^ a shelving sandy bottom, and a reef running about mile off the roast, parallel to it. There are two French posts between Eas Siyan, and the Italian boundary. The Italians have a post on the boundary, visited twice a week by Askar is from Eaheita, but there seems to be a gap of some miles between them and the iirst French post. I put into Perim in the late afternoon, and sailed for a night patrol off Eaheita after dark the following day, returning to Perim at daylight to meet Captain E. B. C. Dicken, O.B.E., D.S.C., the new Senior Officer, Eed Sea Sloops, who had just arrived in “ Clematis ”. 9. Assab .—I sailed from Perim early, and carried out a patrol of the Straits, stopping a few dhows coming up from Djibouti hut nothing suspicious was found. I then showed myself off Eaheita, and proceeded to Assab, where the usual calls were exchanged with the Commissioner. In the evening, the Commissioner and Mr. Davidson dined with me, and the latter told me about the visit to Assab of the Kessel Missoin, in de. Man- fried’s dhow. lie was very disappointed to find that the latter was not in the party, as he had orders to put him under arrest. The Commissioner told me that he thought that the Mission was purely political, and that Kessel was only the nominal leader, the real head being the naval lieutenant, who had served in the Bed Sea in the “ Diane ” some years ago. Later the conversation turned on the slave trade, and the Commissioner was vervTtelimteffhat embarkation from the coasts of Eritrea was now a tiling of the past. He assured me that his native soldiers at. Eaheita were very much on the alert He is another who is anxious to lay Sheik Issa by the heels, as it appears that during the war, when engaged in gun running he was intercepted by the Italians, and made his escape, leaving a good many of the lattei s soidieis dead. 10. On petrol and at Perim.—On leaving Assab, I crossed to the Arabian coast, stopping a few dhows on the way across, and anchored o vacua, ox few hours. . . I found the local sheik quite friendly, but was not able to obtain any usefi^ information, as I did not stay long enough to get any men tooomooff^tl and fowls, which is the best way of getting them to a ■ C both these that the small village of Gehelleh is about a bnf l.vfng dho^ places are mentioned as being favourite landing b ■' J ' .

Strong North west erly winds were encountered during most of the passage. 12. Slave Trade Intelligence .—The outstanding event this month has been the detailed information received from Sir Sidney Barton concerning a large caravan of slaves actually known to be on its way to the coast. \part from this, T have been able to gather a certain amount of informa tion locally, and if the payment of awards proposed in my No. 88(1 dated 1911a June 1930*should be approved I have hopes of getting really useful intelligence. It seems probable that in the event of getting information leading to the capture of a dhow, I should be able to arrange for an award of about 300 rupees through, the Government Agent at Perim, or the Acting Resident at Aden, but it is not absolutely certain. At Perim, I ascertained that Sheik Issa had left for French Somaliland a few days earlier, landing at Khor Angar, and proceeding inland to meet a caravan to buy camels. From another source, just before leaving, it was re ported that he had returned to Angar, and sent camels to Dubab, and was await ing the return of the dhow with rifles and ammunition in payment. The rifles' are sometimes carried in small fishing boats, and bung underneath the boats by a lanyard, if a sloop is seen approaching. At other times they are hidden beneath grass, or the edible leaves which form a common cargo from Arabia to the African coast. Ammunition can be bought at live rounds for a dnllav in A rnbia. hut if commands a dollar a round in Africa, so the trade is a profitable one. It is difficult to find out exactly where the slaves are embarked, an expres sion often used being, “ down from Roheita I followed up this point rather closely, and judge that the Italians are correct, and only occasionally are slaves embarked in their territory. The favourite spot appears to be a few miles south of Ras Dumiera. It was confidently reported that a cargo pf slaves sailed from there early in June, when “ Dahlia ” was at Aden, and having a favourable wind were able to make Khaukha the same night, where they were sold. This cargo was run by the Danakil dealer, Garad, who is one of the men mentioned in the telegram from Addis Ababa. Whilst at Djibouti, I was able to find out that the other dealer mciffiowA in the telegram, Turab, bad left for Aden, and was staying at a certain address. This information was passed to the Acting Resident, and he has informed me. that he is staying there under another name, and purposes leaving for Assah shortly, by an Italian steamer. He has now been asked if this man can be imprisoned for using a false name, or alternatively, it has been suggested to him that the Italian authorities should be informed, as by shadowing him, they might be led direct to the slave caravan. On my last day at Perim, I got in touch with a Danakil, who used to be in the Aden police, and who may be useful. His information seems pretty 7- reliable, as he told me quite accurately about KessePs trip, and his quarrels at Djibouti. This man states that no slaves are now embarked south of Obokh, but that they are marched to the North of Ras al Bir, and may embark at places called Gahira or Guzyra between that point and Khor Angar, vdren the south wind is blowing, but at this time of the y r ear, the usual places are between Ras Siyan and Ras Bumeira. This man confirmed that Sheik Issa dare not risk capture by the Italian and he stated that the coast of Eritrea was practically closed to the slaves. ID was quite definite that the French native troops would turn a blind eye to them. As a matter of interest, it w 7 as reported that an Egyptian, Abdul Aziz Masib has started a fish export business at Sheik Seyd, but that this is only a_lime, and he uses the barrels of fish for smuggling perfume, bought cheap at Djibuan? into A din. I have informed the Acting Political Resident of this report. 13.

S. “ Cracow ” landed nine thousand three hundred and forty-seven cases (four hundred tons) of arms and ammunition as well as one thousand seven hundred and fifty tons of coal, sugar, and cement here on August 28th. The cases of munitions were marked NM1929 ” and were consigned by “ Lepeve Sp. z o p Warzour ” They were landed at an isolated jetty some distance from the port and customs-house and sent by camel to Mecca. 2. A Polish mission consisting of a Colonel Goronowsky (!) and a gunnery expert accompanied the consignment and were received by Ibn Sa’ud, who came Lc6T5Fdto Jcdda from Taif for the inside of the day on September 1st. He attended an exhibition shoot given by the expert with a 47 m|m screw gun, suitable for camel transport in two loads, which was presented to Ibn Sa’ud. The shoot was carefully guarded but I learn that good results were shown at a range of seven to eight thousand yards. *&gt;. I understand from the local Dutch banking house that the shipment wag valued at eighty thousand pounds of which one half was to be paid on delivery The usual hesitations and delays occurred and the “ Cracow ” had to lie off hooting for the money. She eventually sailed with it on September 3rd. 4. The Mecca “ Umm-al-Qura ” published on September 5th a stout denial of press reports to the effect that special permission for the export of these munitions had been obtained from the League of Nations and the British and French Governments. “ The Kingdom of Hejaz-Nejd, being an independent Kingdom, has no need for any such permission 5.1 am sending copies of this despatch to the Acting High Commissioners for Iraq and Trans-Jordan with reference to my telegram No. 154 of September 2 [Serial No. (73)], to yon, which was repeated to them under No. 219.

It ircowwp 77 now lie observed that the Acting Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs himself expressed regret that he had not been earlier informed. 3. It will he remembered that His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda has on several occasions drawn attention to the sensibility of King Ibn Sand in all matters connected with aviation affecting his territories, and has expressed the view that extreme care is required in these matters in order not to increase further the King’s suspicion of, and possible opposition to, the desire of His Majesty’s Government for facilities in connexion with the proposed Arab coast air route. Mi. Henderson tiusts that Lord Passfield will agree to remind the Acting High Commissioner of the importance of these considerations, and to express the hope that it may be found possible to institute some arrangement whereby, should the Royal Air Force unfortunately be compelled to send a machine from Iraq in some unforeseen emergency to enter Nejdi waters without obtaining the previous permission of the Hejazi Government, telegraphic notifica tion shall simultaneously be sent to His Majesty’s Representative at Jedda. 4. A copy of a letter which is being addressed to the Air Ministry on this question is enclosed for Lord Passfield’s information. Enclosure ‘2 to Serial No. (87).

In view of the considerations, advanced in the enclosed letter, I. am to express the hope that the Air Council will cause instructions to be sent to the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq, with a view to ensuring that any similar acei- dcntal infringement of Nejdi territorial waters which may take place in future is notified to the Hejazi Government, through the High Commissioner at Baghdad and His Mnjesty’s Representative at Jeddah, at the eailiest possible moment.

Letter from the Political Agent, Kuwait, to the Hon ’bee the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, No. 299, dated the 3rd September I have the honour to submit the following information which mav he found ot interest. (1) Ibti Mikrad Shaikh of the Mahfudh section of the Ajman, and “ persona grata ’’ with Abdullah ibn Jaloui, Governor of Hassa, visited the Political Agent Kuwait, on 2nd September 1930. He brought an “ Omani” dromedary as present, which was duly accepted and returned in manner permissible anionu- Bedouin. (2) According to Ibn Mikrad, he had come up from Hoffuf with Ibn Mansur to assist him in collecting “ Zikat ” from the Ajman camped in the vicinity of al-Djuda, Awaina, Nta and Jarriyah, and also to try and persuade the Ajman leaders to repair to Hoffuf and see Ibn Jaloui. (3) The Ajman “ Zikat ” had been successfully collected, but the leaders were ^till shy of accepting the invitation to go to Hoffuf. (4) Ibn Mansur was now camped at Wafra (3rd September 1930) and was working through the Awazim about Arak-Wafra, etc. After finishing with them the intention was to visit Subaihiyeh and deal with “ Harb ” now camped there. For this permission had been asked for and granted by the Shaikh of Kuwait. ;(5) I bn M ikrad brought a cordial message from Ibn Jaloui begging the Political Agent to assist in the matter of Subaiheyeh. (6) Ibn Mikrad was accompanied by the old father-in-law of Fahad al- Hatlilain Ilzain ibn Hathlam (killed at Ingair) and Khalid al Mohomed (Sahman), now a refugee in Baghdad. (7) r i'he old man informed the Political Agent that Khalid ? s family were now in Kiath, and that Bin Sand had married 2 of his sisters, in the same way as he and his brother had taken AzaizPs wives after the latter’s death. He him self had come to take Fahad’s family consisting of his daughter, her mother and child to Kiath but the ladies had refused to accompany him. They were camped outside the city by the Shamiyeh wells and are known to the Political Agent.—fgl Oilier information obtained was that the Nta fort was being rapidly Oie condition of al-Duwish, Ibn Hathlain and Ibn Lam was daily q , tvsn: vznss sStHS sz&amp;z - Wore 0 ° in addfao y n to e wearing ehains their legs ‘were confined in ‘‘ stocks - made of heavy wood.

Telegram P., from the High Commissioner for Iraq, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, No. 66, dated the 24th January 1930. Your telegram of 24th January, No. 38. It appeared from your telegram No. 25 that policy of His Majesty’s Government was as follows: Unless Political Resident was satisfied both that Arab sentiment would not be outraged and that Iraq and Koweit would be protected from future raids by handing over of rebel leaders he was authorized in spite of juridical and financial objections which could presumably be overriden to inform Ibn Saud that there was no alternative to deportation. As this was the course suggested in your private and personal telegram of 10th January and independently suggested from here and as it has been concurred in by Resident in the Persian Gulf in his private and personal telegram of 11th January I did not anticipate any other solution and therefore made no comment. From Resident’s telegram No. T.-12 it appears that the first requirement has been met as the leaders have themselves accepted terms but in his T.-7 he states that he shares view that second requirement can only be met by deportation of leaders and return of loot before surrender of tribesmen. The misunderstanding is most regrettable and I now rea ize a it would have been f better if I had commented on your telegram No. 25 before conference took place. I am replying officially as to position of Iraq Govern- ment. I fear that they will feel that they have been sidetracked unless meeting on board ship can be arranged between Faisal and Ibn Saud.147 to use this as an argument against their being eonsultej as to the disposal of the rebels in view of considerations which led them to refuse—wde my telegram No. 21 of 7th January. I should be grateful for early instructions as to the moment when and terms in which decision of His Majesty’s Government should be communicated to the Iraq Government.

It appears unnecessary to return any reply to aide-memoire. If Fuad Hamza should revert to matter however you should explain that since King Ibn Baud’s letter of November 17th was received at approximately the same time as the aide-memoire, and since Fuad Hamza explained that greater part of latter document was of personal nature, official reply of His Majesty’s Government was made to King’s letter.

Complaints that Ibn Baud’s accusations against King Faisal and the of Koweit by Acting Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs have remained un answered. I hope that necessity for further discussion or argument in respect of accusations brought against King Faisal and Sheikh of Koweit may be avoided, as a result of suppression of revolt, of improved atmosphere created by recent meeting between Ibn Baud and Political Resident in Persian Gulf (see Koweit telegram No. T.-7 of January 21st and January 22nd to Colonial Office), of possi bility of Ibn Baud meeting King Faisal personally in near future, and of depar ture of Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs from Jeddah [see your telegram No. 14 (of January 21st)], you may make use, at your discretion and in whatever way you think best, of material contained in Bushire despatches Nos. 61, 64 and 68 and in Baghdad despatch of November 56th to Colonial Office, copies of all of which have been sent to you direct. If, however, you should at any time consider it essential to return some reply to specific charges advanced in Ibn Baud’s memo randum of September 14th.

In the conversation which I had with him on the 21st instant when he brought the matter up he stated that the Iving felt somewhat aggrieved at the prolonged delay in the settlement by His Majesty’s Government of various ques tions of importance to him. I asked him for specific instances and he stated first of all that several points in the King’s memorandum enclosed in my despatch No. 255 of September 30th had not been answered. On my pressing for further details he referred to the charges against Iraq and Koweit. I replied that it was quite impossible to reply at once to charges of such a nature and that they would require careful investigation involving by the nature of things considerable time in order to arrive at the truth. He then quoted the cases which I reported in my telegram and I promised to bring them to your notice. I reminded him how ever that, in general, questions of importance regarding Arabia required con sideration by at least three separate Government departments, often by three separate Governments as well, and that whatever delays there might normally be, due to administrative causes, there were therefore necessarily multiplied. I also added that, in spite of delays, he could rest assured that all matters of interest to the Hejaz Government received the most careful consideration of His Majesty’s Government.

The ostensible reason was that the King was hying to the simplest style and was not m a position suitably to entertain dis- tSshed visitors and that he had with him a number of fanatical and ignorant tXsmen • the real reason, I think, was that certain Shaikhs from Iraqi nbes and others' were visiting his camp and Bin Sand was anxious that we should not become aware of this. 4 In their instructions to me His Majesty’s Government had said that they would much prefer to avoid deporting the rebel eaders, if possible and I felt that there was much force in the reasons advanced by them, though at first sight deportation certainly seemed the simplest course After a full consideration, however of all the issues involved and as a result of my discussions with Bin Saud and the impression I formed of his feeling’s and character, I believe it would have been a mistake, for the following reasons. His Majesty’s govern ment have in the past given many signs of their friendship for Bm Sand : they have supplied him with arms and ammunition and even with aeroplanes with British personnel : they have taken the most drastic measures to ensure that no facilities should be accorded to the rebel tribes ; and their general attitude has been one of readiness to assist him as far as was in their power in his struggle with his rebellious subjects. They had, of course, never offered to surrender the rebels to him unconditionally and had warned him that a con tingency might arise under which they would be unable to eject the rebels from Kuwait or Iraq territory. If however when this contingency arose, His Majesty’s Government had declined to surrender the rebel leaders to him des pite the very categorical undertaking he was prepared to give to prevent raids by Nejdi tribes into Kuwait and Iraq territory in the future, and his undertak ing to s'pare the lives of all the rebels and make a prompt settlement of claims, then, I venture to think, Bin Saud would have had some justification for feeling that, while the action of His Majesty’s Government did not constitute a breach of faith, it was inconsistent with their former professions of friendship and^im- plied a change of attitude. I am certain that he would have gone back to Nejd completely antagonised. To speak of the terms arranged as capitulation seems to me to ignore the past relations existing between His Majesty’s Government and Bin Saud. Had he gone off to Nejd without the rebel leaders being handed over to him, what would have been the position 1 It would not have been pos sible permanently to stop the rebel Mutair and Ajman from returning to Nejd territory, which is their home : Bin Sand would thus have been provided with a weapon ready to his hand, and, though it is time that these tribes would have been deprived of. their principal leaders, others would have been forthcom ing, and with .Bin Saud in hostile mood and these tribes again at his disposal I think there would have been a strong probabilitv of a recrudes- ence of organised raiding all along the border in the near future. It is of course possible that Bin Sand may not fulfil his undertakings, though person ally I believe that he intends to do so, and that organised raiding under his orders and with his encouragement will cease for at any rate some time to come.: but I do think that the risk of organised raiding is very much less now than it . , „ # 0 - petty cattle-lifting nia} lecur irom time to time is of course possible : they are more or less in the nature of a local pastime, and of little importance and are totally different makers to organised raiding carried out with the encouragement or under the orders of the King. . , 5 ’ T . here if one otlier consideration to be borne in mind and that is the pro jected air route down the Gulf. A portion of this route runs through Nejd an iavo 1 i 11 fhc past, to obtain certain facilities from Bin etc., but these facilities have hitherto Govor^w 1 ; P ° SS i bly olie 1 of the considerations that induced His Majesty s .1 to ™Vv}Y aeroplanes to Bin Sand was that these might induce him They will I think be on stronger ground to renew their to change liis attitud&lt; beeirthe 'J! acc ede to them now than would have Deen the case had the rebel leaders been deported.: b t h '^•k' tlatfct 1 Irani li 1 ami| 'nUkt scussionsiij: ^cterjl*: Majest?^ )r res to ensir.

His Majesty’s Government insisted that the surrender of the rebel leaders should be in accordance with Arab sentiment. I therefore asked the Commander of H. M. S. “ Lupin ” to bring them down to Kuwait and flew up to Kuwait myself with Colonel Dickson to interview them. Dawish, after hearing that Bin Sand was ready to give a formal letter to His Majesty’s Gov ernment promising to spare his life, at once thanked me profusely and said he was quite willing to go back. Ibn Hithlain is an impossible 'person to deal with. He is entirely unstable, very talkative and ready to refuse or deny in the morning any arrangement arrived at the previous even ing* However, after a discussion with Colonel Dickson and myself he also agreed to surrender to Bin Saud. I therefore returned to Bin Sand’s camp quite satisfied. The following morning I got a telegram from the Commander of the “ Lupin ” to the effect that Ibn Hithalain was not willing to return unless the King sent his son to take him over in accordance with a custom that is some times adopted among Arabs to give confidence to tribesmen who wish to sur render. The King, not unnaturally I think, said that the proposal was quite in compatible with his dignity and, secondly, that this was only done when it was the intention that the person surrendering should be completely forgiven : in the present case this was not his intention nor the desire of His Majesty’s Govern ment : on the contrary his intention was to punish these persons. Colonel Dickson therefore again went up to Kuwait to interview the rebel leaders and Ibn Hithlain again said that he was ready to surrender. I therefore proceeded with the settlement and arranged that they should be flown down to Bin Saud’s camp and handed over by Colonel Dickson. After the whole settlement had been con cluded and our party had left for Kuwait,. Air Commodore Burnett, Colonel Dickson and I proceeded on board the “ Lupin ” to inform the rebel leaders that they would be handed over the following morning, and Hithlain then said that he would not go. I told him it was too late to change his mmd and that he would have to go, the next morning and to my surprise he came ashore the following morning quite cheerful and smiling and stepped into the aeroplane without the smallest demur. Dawisb on the other hand was perfectly consistent throughout and reiterated his readiness to return to Bm Sand and 1 m gratitude to His Maiestv’s Government for having saved his life. He lumself remarked to CoL-l Dickson that Ibn Hithlain had the mind of a child and it was quite im possible to argue with him as he changed his mmd half a dozen times a day. I mav mention that Ibn Hithlain and Dawish are closely related by marriage. CfeTade no reference to Ibn Lami, the third rebel leader. He, however, is a very petty Shaikh, who has only sprung.into notoriety because he happen to be wiih Diwlsih when he surrendered. He is a person of no real importance ^Ifan“ 'ady to return to Bin Sand and J^aSr ^ 6 would have gone back with the tribesmen and not with the r ^ e ' i After the — the point of yi., , settlement I would point out that the comrol tution m anticipation of a tmai settlement. w i • ty pw had of the tribes was causing Air Commodore Burnett mu«h anxm y ^ T been located, doubtless for very good reasons, “ c ‘ ose V™ anvious to re border.

Air Commodore Burnett was most anxious to a J to move the tribes down, and I felt that it was essential tha ,f p the be finally settled ivithout further delay. The following morning therefore tto rebel leaders were flown down to Bin Sand’s camp with Colonel Dickson whop sonally handed them over to Bin Sand, and the Chief Staff Officer left with SMblan, and emissaries from Bin Sand bearing letters of forgiveness, etc^, Jarishan to tell the tribes to move south, while I returned that night m n. “ Lnpin ” to Bushire. 9 . I would mention that in accordance with your instructions at my terview with Bin Sand I informed him that His Majesty’s Government too | / exception to the tone of the notes addressed by his Minister for Foreign A to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Jeddah. He admitted at once that their remonstrance was justified, and express^ his regret, and it was reported to me afterwards that Bin Sand had telegrap for Fuad Hamza to come to his camp and intended to dismiss him and appo Hafiz Wabha to act in bis place temporarily. Now that tbe meeting with J - &amp; Faisal is to take place it is possible that he may decide not to make anv cna &amp; for the moment, and that if Fnad Hamza carries on the negotiations wnh successfully he may rehabilitate himself : Bin Sand however was certainly ^ angry with him at the time. Curiously enough Hafiz Wabha who had been i a a nuisance to the Political Agent at Kuwait for some time past, was most he p during the negotiations : he is, I believe, on very bad terms with the i 1 S private secretary Yusif Yasin, a Syrian, who was most obstructive in every c -’ and possibly this had much to do with it. 10 .

W r ! forgij#; that night 111 imposed on the rebel leaders and the tribes. As explained in my telegram No. 38 of the 28th January Bin Sand resented dictation in this matter : he contended that he had given a definite promise to prevent raids, but that the exact manner in which he was to implement this must be left to him. To have pressed the point would have meant further discussions, and as I have pointed out above an early settlement was essential, and I could not help feeling* that the matter was one rather of theoretical than of practical importance. Firstly, as regards the leaders it would have been very difficult to have ascertained whether in fact they were being kept in Riyadh or at any other place. Secondly, as telegraphed in my comments on the agreement, if Bin Sand means to stop raiding* lie may be trusted to exercise effective control over both the leaders and the tribes : if he does not intend to fulfil this undertaking then any promises regarding the control to be exercised over the rebel tribes will certainly prove equally illusory. I think how- everthat not merely in fulfilment of his undertakings to His Majesty’s Government hut in his own interests he will take drastic measures to prevent all risk of a fur ther rebellion against his authority. As regards the tribes it was not his inten tion to restrict them to one specified area : considerations of grazing and water would prevent this : but I think he intends to control their movements generally and not to allow them to move about anywhere they place, for some time to come at any rate. 11. As regards Bin Sand’s promises to settle claims promptly in future my hands were somewhat tied by the machinery of the Bahra Agreement in the case of Iraq. Bin Saucl would of course have been glad of any excuse to modify the terms of the Bahra Agreement and expressed his readiness to settle claims for raids on Iraq on demand, but said that he assumed that any such arrange ment would supersede any arrangement prescribed in the Bahra Agreement, lo this of course I could not agree, and the only course possible was to try to tighten im the Bahra Agreement ; and Bin Sand offered spontaneously to appoint repre sentatives to the tribunal prescribed in the Bahra Agreement at any time one month after the receipt of a request to this effect by the Iraq Government, the only stipulation he made being that the month of Zi-Haj (pilgiimage) s ion t be excluded from the computation of the month allowed to as sal ?Jf n a „ he made the pilgrimage himself every year and had many preoccupations during that month He contended, however, that the failure to form a tribunal to in vestigate claims in the past was not due to him and that he had on two occamons sent Hafiz Wabha to Kuwait as his representative and that the latter had s1 A there for six months on one occasion and for two or three months ™ mother, and that tin Traq Government had failed to send representatives I did not know whether th^ statement was correct and Xmenfofd^m the matter. As regards Kuwait the current prmitice for the settlement ot clai^ is for the Ruler of Kuwait to address Bin Sand direct and .or cla ms iusted bv direct correspondence. This procedure has proved quite meffectua Ste pasrilnd I C douht P whether it is likely to P.^rtStiTte^n agreem n future, but Bin Saud stated that he was quite ^‘“8 ^ | es ire it. with Kuwait on the lines of the Bahra Agreement should ^ Finally he agreed to pay £10,000 m anticipation of a final settlement It will be seen that, firstly, the leaders have gone back will ; secondly, we have obtained a.promise ro a categorical pro- them and the tribesmen with humanity ; thirdly, Mejias ^.ve ^ ^ | nture? and mise to prevent any raids by Nejd tribes m o 11 their settlement has should any raids occur despite his e ^°fJ s ^| le Government* choose to avail been considerably tightened up and if e_ ^ . coini 3ensation. Finally, themselves of it no undue delay should occur in obtaim^ ap _ despite the fact that Bin Saud contends t against Nejd, a substantial proximately to the same figure as the Iraq claims against iNeja, sum has been obtained from him on accoun . 12. As regards the allocation as between 'hIs Excellency’the I am confronted by a similar^ difficulty to that e p ^ Yonoi the 3l s t January, High Commissioner for Iraq m his telegra • c ] a i m ‘ s , or the proportion they inasmuch as I do not know the amount o . , ^ ;gi n gaud claims to hear to the Kuwait claims. I would ho \ e ^ e p r taTnot -ot any counter-claims have heaw counter-claims against Iraq, w a ^ ^ payment on account Lc472FD155 , for the concluBion with Kuwait of an agreement 13.

Should any material modification be found necessary then doubtless it mil be possible in the near future to arrange a meeting between the Shaikh and Bin Sand and possibly, if His Majesty’s Government saw on objection, the Political Agent or I could also attend to discuss the matter. 14 In the course of a private discussion with Bin Sand I mentioned the matter of Kuwait customs, but the latter was entirely uncompromising, at the same time he was quite frank and said he was in dire straits tor money (which I believe to be more or less correct) and that he must get it prom somewhere and that the Shaikh of Kuwait had a comfortable income without having to work for it while he Bin Sand, led laborious days and was constantly beset by financial worries This of course was a ridiculous argument but time did not permit of mv pressing this matter further then nor was the moment altogether propitious. 1 do not think, however, that there is much use in continuing a discussion on paper with Bin Sand on tins subject. There arc many wheels within wheels. For one thing Bin Sand’s chief financiers are the wealthy firm of Qnsaibis at Bahrain. They farm the.customs at Oqair and Qatif and it is obviously in their interests to compel trade to pass through those ports in preference to Kuwait and, since the introduction of the arrangement by which goods consigned to Nejd only pay 2 per cent, transit duty at Bahrain, their task has been much facilitated, and they naturally have much influence with Bin Sand. If Bin Sand could be induced to farm out to them the customs on goods entering Nejd through Kuwait it is very probable that nothing more would be heard of the question of the customs duties on this border and that the trade of Kuwait would revive. I think the best thing would be to wait a short time and see whether, wuth the more peaceful conditions that it is honed will prevail, there is any revival of trade and lessening of the blockade of Kuwait and, if not, to arrange for a meeting betwees the Shaikh and Bin Sand acconfpanied by a political officer to thrash out the whole matter. 15. As I have reported in my telegram No. 32 of the 31st January, the Shaikh of Kuwait paid- a formal visit to Bin Sand while I was there. As I have said above, at Bin Sand’s request he had sent out tents, servants and supplies for us there, and we were rcallv his guests and not those of Bin Sand. He was anxious to pay his respects to Bin Sand and assured the Political Agent that the visit would merely he a formal one as he himself is desirous that anv discussions with Bin Sand regarding Kuwait affairs should he carried on by us on his behalf. He and some of the membei’s of his family were therefore conveyed bv air to Bin Baud’s camp, stayed two nights and were flown back to Kuwait. He gave me to understand that no controversial matters were discussed, but Bin Saud re cce mod from the Awazim the loot they had carried off in the three recent raids, and restored it to him. T). On my arrival at Bin Sand’s camp the King expressed a desire that the aeroplanes supplied to him by His Majesty’s Government should be flown from p/’ip 1 to us camp so that he would see them. A telegram was therefore sent to wJrTh 108 n 1C 1 'V V. c 0 ' !lcej ’ l!1 eBarge of the aeroplanes to fly them up to Khaban i v p. ,] T le . c °ecurjed in the transmission of the message since the wire- about Alr F ? rce hOTe . to Darin was iiot workiw, but in finrfin^ flm'j ‘' er t-ie aeroplanes arrived, thousfii thov had some difficulty ekoii Ji Arot * anc h w ® s , mllch Stratified.

In view of the British Government’s undertaking to hand over Faisal ad-Dawish, Naif Ibn Hithlain, Jasir Ibn Land and all the Mutair and Ajman who are held by the British authorities, we hereby confirm our verbal conversations with you as follows :— U) That in spite of the punishment which the three leaders, Faisal ad- Dawish, Naif Ibn Hithlain and Jasir Ibn Lami and their followers deserve for their offences against neighbouring Governments and their rebellion against us.

(2) We regard it as our prerogative to inflict upon these people such punishment as will restrain them in future, and restrain others whose souls may lead them to do evil ; these punishments however will be saturated with the spirit of justice and mercy for which we are known, hut we reserve the right to take from them any pro perty that they may have taken from others. m As regards the raids, we promise to prevent any raid against the neighbouring Governments, Iraq and Kuwait, whether by the Mntair, Ajman or any other Najd tribe ; should anything of the kind take place in future we shall be prepared to apply without delay the Bahra Agreement in the case of Iraq, and to restore im mediately whatever may be plundered from Kuwait in accordance with the custom current between Kuwait and Najd. If the Ruler of Kuwait desires to enter into an agreement in regard to raids, similar to the Bahra Agreement, we are prepared to enter into such an agreement with him. (4) As regards property that has been carried off from Iraq nefioTuiN in the past, we are prepared to apply the procedure prescribed in the Bahra Agreement, and in the case of Kuwait to effect a settle ment of claims in accordance with the procedure at piesent in force, provided that none of the rebellious Mutair and Apian and their followers who are in the hands of the British authorities or their property remain in Iraq or Kuwait territory. In view of the friendship which exists between ns and His M*teety’s Gov- eminent, we have agreed to their wishes as expressed in paragr * q ( | letter.

The same day he was taken to Basra by aeroplane. Thereupon we sent to the British Government who supervise the relations of the Governments of Iraq, Koweit and Transjordan, a strong protest in which we said that Boweish and his miserable companions were .criminals in the sight of all those Governments ’ that they were being punished for trespassing on those countries ; that agreements and past promises assured ns that they would not receive them, but would oppose them with force. For this reason we pro test against the reception of Feisal and we request his surrender and the deli very of all those who have surrendered. We sent off this protest yesterday. The probability is that there will be a meeting of delegates of H. M. King Ibn Sand and delegates of Great Britain, Iraq' and Koweit. It will probably meet in the space (at Abya 1) between the frontiers of Nejd, Iraq and Koweit. It is expected that Sheikh Yussef Yassin and Sheikh Hafez Wabha will be the King’s representatives and Colonel Dickson(?), British Agent in Koweit, repre sentative of Great Britain.

His Highness’s statement that Colonel Peake is mchned to call out Ae Fron tier Force on every occasion is obviously ill founded but may perhaps be lor- given in view of the clear exposition of his view of the situation which he gives in the following paragraphs of his letter. tT ^ , The Amir’s statement that raiders from the Nejd and the Hedjaz have remained unpunished is, with the single exception of Farhan Ibn Mashhur, quite rue His statement that no loot has been returned by Ibn baud is also true w“th the exception that a very small portion oi the loot taken in the raid on the Zebu in February, 1928, was restored. It is also true that a very large proportion of the loot taken by the Trans jordan tribes since the Hadda Agreement has been restored and that a number of prominent people have been punished by imprisonment and nne. Neither can it be denied that protection has not been given to Trans-Jordan Bednin in any single case from raiders from Nejd and the Hedjaz. It is also a fact that the tribunals assembled at Maan and Jericho failed to produce anv result because of the obstructive attitude of Ibn Sand and his dele gates and that Ibn Sand has resisted attempts on my part to improve relation* by getting into closer touch with his officials. Ibn Sand has replied to any claim submitted by Trans-Jordan by flinging insults at the Amir and by bringing countercharges against Trans-Jordan tribes but has done nothing towards setting matters right. His Majesty’s Govern ment has allowed these insults and this failure to act pass unchallenged and has at the same time brought continuous pressure to bear on the Amir in regard to the failure of his tribes and has done all it can to help Ibn Baud in overcoming the troubles with which he has recently been faced in striking contrast with its line of action when King Hussein and King Ali were threatened by him when they were still in the Hedjaz. It is not be wondered at, therefore, that the Beduin believe that we are frightened of Tbn Baud and it may be assumed also that the Amir shares this conviction and that his regard for us diminished accordingly. I have previously explained how during two periods the Amir has put his house in order and that the disorder which subsequently followed was due on each occasion to Nejd. I venture to suggest that an expression of appreciation of the difficulties in which the Amir is placed would not be amiss and that the situation would im prove if His Majesty’s Government would take up the cudgels on behalf of Trans-Jordan from time to time instead of shewing itself more in sympathy with Ibn Baud than with the ruler of its own mandated territory. Letter from Amir Abdullah, to His Excellency the British Resident, No. -A DATED THE 25th JANUARY 1930. In confhmation of my conversation yesterday, I am pleased to Inform Toni’ Excellency that I do not object to carrying out the request of the 0. C.

I quite agree that the Trans-Jordan tribes should not be allowed to raid and that those who dare to do so should be punished and made to recover and return all they loot. I have confirmed this on several occasions by word and deed. But being desirous of protecting the tribes of my people and of retain ing the loyalty of that people towards me and towards the Mandatory Power, I find it necessary in the light of my knowledge of Beduin mentality to draw Your Excellency’s attention and that of His Excellency the High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan, to the following remarks :— (1) Kaiding as viewed by tribes is legitimate and the existence of each tribe within the limits of their natural boundaries gives them the right to raid any other tribe outside their boundaries. (2) Beduin Arabs, like Ibn Sand, and Ibn Rasheed formerly, took the lea dership of their tribes to raid the other when quarrels between them were dec lared, because those tribes are in fact the soldier of Beduin Amirs. (3) When one of them conquers the other the tribes of the vanquished commit themselves to the victorious Amir and unite with him and then will attack with him that Amir who had been their previous chief in their country and would not mind capturing that chief and his family. This is what hap pened when Mohamed Ibn Rasheed conquered all Nejd and captured A1 Baud and the very same thing happened recently to A1 Rasheed at the hands of Ibn Baud. Such is God’s law in Jezeera (Arabia). (4) Now as regards those parts of Arabia which were governed by Civil Governments, as Turkey previously. Turkey permitted raiding amongst the tribes and did not object at all as long as raids did not extend to the settled dis tricts and as long as the Amirs of Nejd acknowledged the suzerainty of the Sul tan the same as Egypt. (5) Since the Nejdian tribes have attacked this country, when they had em braced the YV r ahhabi creed and were supported by their Sultan and then by their King and were not punished for their action nor anything was restored to the tribes of this country or any compensation given, this would convey to the Beduin that freedom of raiding is still open and lawful. (6) At present also when that King has made an end as is rumoured of the Wahhabi hordes who had risen against him his tribes who are under his P 10 ~ tection and favour started to raid the tribes of this country. The number of such raids is no doubt known to Your Excellency. On our side we have not gained anything for our tribes but have only given promises that their losses would be made good yet whilst we do not repel raids against them we aie doing our best to restore all they had taken from their enemies which is on an average of one to ten, that is to say against ten raids by Nejd there is one raid by Trans-Jordan. Owing to these facts I would point out that the following mil happen {a) The resentment of all the inhabitants of Trans-Jordan will be raised against us on account of their enemy having a free hand to raid them at pleasure wTiereas they are not protected but are commanc - ed to have patience against such horrid acts and aie bidden to re taliate. (b) The disappearance of love and loyalty from the hearts of the people towards me and towards the Mandatory Power ror that reason. (e) The firm belief of the Bedu that the Nejd-Hejaz Government frwhtM this side and renders it unable to safeguard the rights of its sub jects and of those taking refuges in its country. (d) The tribes will commence to take refuge in the Nejdian authorities and joinin'’’ them will show enmity to us which is only a natural result of what is said above.171 in a nws 5 gt is their ci l- am aarymiliti Is Majesl fcr sabjei is.

(I) Iraq Government undertaking to expel Da wish and his followers re ferred to the person who had raided into Iraq and whom Ibn Sand wished to punish. Mashhur is not of this category.

Telegram P. ? from the Secretary of State for the Colonies, to the High Com missioner for Iraq, No, 85, dated the 14th February 1930. (Repeated to Bushire, No. 39 ; Jeddah No. 36). Your telegram of February 12th, No. 104 [Serial No. (219)], disposal of Jbn Mashhur. His Majesty’s Government are very apprehensive as to effect on Ibn Sand of line referred to in your telegram. It is of such importance that meeting between Ibn S&amp;ud and Feisal should take place in a friendly atmosphere, alike from point of view of future relations between Nejd and Iraq and from that of His Majesty’s Government themselves, and the refusal of Ibn Saud to persevere with meeting because of a dispute over this relatively unimportant matter would be so unfortunate that His Majesty’s Government regard it as desirable to make all possible efforts to arrive at an understanding with him. From a different standpoint in view of assurances given to Ibn Saud they would be placed in a most embarrassing position vis-a-vis Nejd if Iraq Government persist in their present uncompromising attitude. Although perhaps it is arguable that case of Ibn Mashhur is not expressly covered by terms of the pledges given by Iraq Government, His Majesty’s Government feel that it would be most difficult to contend that his case is not affected by guarantees given by them in November as to expulsion of “ contending forces ” and “ concerting of necessary military measures ” for that end. His Majesty’s Government’s own inclination would be to hand over Ibn Mashhur subject to similar guarantees to those obtained in case of other rebel leaders. They do not, however, object to Iraq Government endeavouring to use Ibn Mashhur as bargaining counter for securing a saitsfactory settlement of Dahamshah and Dhafir question. It should nevertheless be realised that Iraq Government have no claim under Article 4 of the Bahra Agreement to expulsion of Shiekhs of these tribes. On the other hand, the demand for the surrender of Ibn Mizyad is in His Majesty’s Government’s opinion quite unjustified as being directly contrary to Article 1 of the Bahra Agreement, which provides expressly for the administra tion of punishment for raiding by Government to which the raiders are subject. It makes no provision for the handling over of Nejdi offenders by Nejd Govern ment to Iraq which, other considerations apart, would probably lead to embar rassing counter claims from Nejd. In the circumstances Iraq Government should be informed that while His Majesty’s Government are prepared to support the Iraq Government in their endeavour to obtain a satisfactory settlement as regards the Dahamshah and Dhafir Sheikhs, although not necessarily as a condition of handing over Ibn Mashhur, they nevertheless are definitely unable to support the demand for the surrender of ibn Mizyad, and you should use your utmost endeavours to induce them to substitute a demand that Ibn Saud should inflict upon him and his fol lowers u severe punishment ” which would be in accordance with Article 1 of the Bahra Agreement. If, however, Iraq Government persist in maintenance of a wholly uncom promising attitude as regards Ibn Mashhur and in this way jeopardise the pros pects of a satisfactory settlement with Ibn Saud, it may be found necessary for His Majesty’s Government to instruct you to dissociate yourself from their action, and you should warn Iraq Government accordingly.

Your telegram No. 85 of 15th February [Serial No. (220)]. I agree that demand for surrender of Ibn Mizyad is wholly unreasonable and I should have mentioned this in mv telegram. Mesopotamian Government were incensed at reports that he was in high favour with Bin Sand m whose tram he was said * to be riding stolen Mesopotamian she camels. I propose with them to confine their demand in his case to request for ade quate punishment. ■With regard to Ibn Mashhur I agree that if meeting of kings were to be abandoned on his account it would be most unfortuate but I should find it very difficult to persuade Feisal to abandon his chief bargaining counter in advance of the meeting and blame should surely rest on Bin Sand if he wrecks the con ference on this point. Feisal himself suggested to me the other day that no useful purpose would be served by his meeting Ibn Sand unless latter agreed beforehand to his attitude about the desert posts. I dissuaded him from adopting this attitude arid suggest Ibn Saud should be similarly dissuaded if he attempts to make his own attendance at meeting conditional on prior agreement to surrender Ibn Mashhur. Present position is that preliminary conference which was friendly but unfruitful has broken up. Telegrams from Mesopotamian delegation indicate that question of Mashhur was raised only at first of three meetings and not pressed. Nejd delegates left Koweit February 14th to join Ibn Saud who is apparently moving south to embark February 20th, at Ras Tanurah for meet ing. Mesopotamian delegates are due at Baghdad tomorrow and I will report further if necessary after hearing what they have to say. : (223) Enclosure in Colonial Office covering letter dated 19th February 1930.

The only rea- 11 ac 011 ^ ie part of Ibn i\lusaed may bo investigated in the. lightof the following statement. Begins. He used to report to us acts of aggression and raiding committed by Tians-Jordon Tribes near Jauf, Hail and Tebuk and our Government in turn used to communicate these reports to the British Gov ernment tin ough the British A^gent at Jeddah^ and lately during conversations between our Acting Minister for h preign Affairs and the British Resident in Amman. Besides these reports Ibn Musaed used to keep us informed of bad effect and alarm which these ceaseless raids used to create amongst our tribes and witnin our territory in addition to instigation exercised over our tribesmen to make them rise against our authority. Had it not been for God’s help and troops we^ had placed in those parts it would have been impossible for us to prevent risings and calamity. These conditions might have been Ibn Musaed or any ol his officials to act in order to prevent a calamity befalling those parts of our country in the absence of measures to put an end to continued raids from Trans-Jordan, We believe if this report proves correct Ibn Musaed’s act must be of such a nature as to inflict a punishment upon mischief makers between both sides. Because we have great confidence in the wisdom of Ibn Musaed who does not exceed our orders. Nevertheless we express to the British Govern ment our regret at what had taken place and request them to act promptly to evade difficulty between us and Trans-Jordan in the manner they consider fit. We have left the matter entirely in their hands and we accept whatever decision they find convenient because, first, we like to do always what pleases them, secondly, we dislike creating any difference in Arabia, and thirdly, we like rest and tranquility for us and our neighbours. We therefore request the British Government to reconsider pending questions between us and Trans-Jordan to settle existing problems with least possible delay.

Section “ B Port Sudan — Perivn. I. From 25tli November—2nd December combined patrol was carried out between H. M. Ships “ Clematis ” and ^ Dahlia ” working on opposite sides of Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb. Bad weather was experienced throughout. With the exception of one dhow intercepted by H. M. S. “ Dahlia ” north of Aden, no suspicious vessels were encountered. Subsequently this dhow was released after enquiry by Resident Aden and cautioned for failing to stop when called upon. It is still a matter of conjecture that this dhow may have been engaged in illicit traffic of some nature, but evidence was lacking. “ Clematis ” has stopped and searched dhows lately on this coast and no similar case of “ igno rance ” has been experienced when called upon to stop. The defence put for ward by the dhow crew to the effect that “ warships never appeared on this coast and therefore were not to be expected ” still sounds somewhat suspicious. However it may have been a case of genuine fright and evidence being lacking nothing could be done to convict. Anchorages were made at Great Nanish Island and Sheikh Said, the latter for purpose of rendezvous with “ Dahlia ”. “ Dahlia ” later proceeded on patrol and ships rendezvoused again at Perim on 4th December. On 6th Decem ber “ Clematis ” sailed on patrol and for Aden, shortW after her departure “ Dahlia ” left Perim on patrol northwards calling at Asab and Bid. ******** Aden—Kishin and return. II. A visit was paid by me to Political Resident to discuss the cruise to Mokalla and Coast of the Aden Protectorate mentioned in my letter of Proceed ings No. I14j81, Section B.-II of 30th August, 1929. The Resident “ explained ” to me that some three to four weeks previously a R. A. F. Officer (Flight Lieut. Rickards) had left Aden for Mokalla by air, for the purpose of proceeding thence by dhow to Kishin and Dhofar. The object of his journey was a reconnaissance of the coast northwards from Mokalla for the purpose of establishing aeroplane landing grounds, with a view eventuallv to linking, up the Red Sea and Persian Gulf by air. Communications beyond Mokalla do not exist except precariously by dhow,181 m, n f Lieut Eickards at Kisiin apparently had not been too , T 16 The Beeident suggested to me that if “ Clematis ” cruise could be ex- f 1 ’?a'to’include the vicinity of Kishin, he thought a useful purpose would be tended to me i / oved by you “ Clematis ’’left Aden on 10th December after embarking Lieut.-Colonel Cake Political Officer, at the request .Uecemoei, the dual p Ur p 0 se o± the cruise to Kishm and also to inquire into the circumstances of a tribal dispute between the Sultans of Bal TT J and Bir Ali affecting the ownership ot the cargo of a dhow which threatened ^o cause trouble. With this object “ Clematis - put intq Bal Haf and Bir Ali on the wav to Kishin, at which places the usual visits were paid, accompanied by Political Officer, and it is believed as a result this dispute has now been settled. The Sultan of Bal Haf was absent In the hinterland, his uncle Sultan Ahmed bin Salih officiating, the Sultan of Bir Ah was absent at Aden his son Sultan Thalab bin Nasir officiating. Ill On arrival at Kishin a visit w T as paid by me accompanied by Lieut.t Colonel'Lake to the son of the Sultan of Kishin and Socotra. The Sultan him self was absent in Socotra. Our reception was not cordial, in fact, I under stood at the time, from Lieut.-Colonel, Labe, who is an authority in such cases, that it was distinctly rude. We were not offered coffee, kept waiting for a con siderable period unnecessarily, and IJent.-Colonel Lake had difficulty in getting any satisfactory answers relative to Flight Lient. Rickard’s visit. Generally the attitude taken up appeared to he that aeroplanes and landing grounds were not in the least wanted and facilities, for the latter did not exist. This last was eer-, tainly not accurate since Lieut. Rickards it appears had experienced no diffi culty in finding a duitable landing ground close to Kishin during his short stay (about 6 hours only). However, this attitude was not entirety unexpected, the Resident having hinted at possible “.obstruction ” before “ Clematis” left Aden. For this there appeared no justifiable reason as it is believed corres pondence had previously passed with the Sultan of Kishin and Socotra of a favourable nature. The Sultan’s son excused himself from returning my call on being invited on hoard for “ fear of being seasick ” ah “ old ” tale which carried no conviction. IV. From information obtained privately from two different sources, one at Kishin and the other from a dhow intercepted en route, it appeared that Flight Lieut. Rickards had passed through Kishin about 10 days previously and safely arrived at Dhofar, where no difficulty was anticipated as to the nature of Ms reception. This information was communicated to Resident Aden, who agreed with me that it appeared unnecessary for “ Clematis ” to proceed further. V. On return passage to Aden, a short visit was paid to Mokalla of 24 hours, for the purpose of embarking Abdullah bin Mohsin, brother of the Sultan of Bal Haf, who was granted an indulgence passage by me to Aden, with a view to ex pediting the settlement of the dispute mentioned in paragraph II, and a fur ther short of 3|4 hours at Bal Haf for purpose of consultation. This was at Colonel Lake’s suggestion. Our reception at Mokalla was of the usual cordial nature and in marked contrast to that at Kishin. The Prime Minister, Syed Bubukar Hussain bin Earned, who was officiating (the Sultan being absent in en) was visited by Colonel Lake and myself at the village of Tyla, some 12 r 1 ? s n 1 an • pyed Buhukar Husain bin Hamed insisted on accompanying us rnnm/nf n m ^e visit. At Tyla the party attended a wedding cere- nreqonf inJf 1 y C lie \ a t * ie Pnrae Minister’s invitation. A large gathering was present including a body guard of some 100 Bedouin soldiers.

' le Air Officer Commanding, Aden, intends to take further steps to reconnoitre these p! aces.VII. At the various points along the coast visited the natives were found to he of a tuendly disposition except at Kashin. At Kishin it was mentioned hy the Sultan s son, with what truth is not known, that no British warship had visited this place for from 12 14 years. Kishin is an open anchorage and landing has to be made thiough the surf. It is my opinion that a distinctly use ful purpose is served by showing the flag along this coast, in view of the gradual opening up of this part of the Aden Protectorate by aeroplane and otherwise. Recent aeroplane surveys in the Northern part of the Protectorate inland have disclosed some quite considerable towns and fertile districts, the existence of which in the past whilst not actually unknown has largely been a matter of con jecture. It is believed this opinion is also shared by the authorities at Aden. Contact with the local Bedouin tribes who are inclined to be hostile on occasion, once established on a tactful basis, generally ends in their apprehensions being dispelled. It is remarkable what a few friendly gestures and small presents will produce in the way of changing this attitude of suspicion. The first essen tial to friendly relations is to make contact and this can be done by showing the flag occasionally along the coast, whilst at the same time carrying out these duties mentioned in M. S. 0. B. Article 965, paragraph 2. These visits can only be carried out occasionally if the duties of H. M. Ships in the Red Sea are not to suffer. **•#**#* Aden — Perim, Kamaran—Port Sudan. II. Ship sailed for Perim, 27th December p.m. and having completed with coal at Perim left on patrol northwards and for the purpose of rendezvousing with “ Dahlia ” at Port Sudan about the middle of January. On passage to Perim the vicinity of Brothers’ Islands was searched at daylight. No dhows were encountered. Subsequent to leaving Perim closed Khor Ghuleifakeh at daylight and anchored off for two hours., no suspicious dhows were encountered. III. Twelve hours only were spent at Kamaran for the purpose of purchas ing fresh provisions. “Clematis” entered the reef area on 1st January patrolling northwards and anchoring each evening as convenient. With the exception of a small fishing boat picked up in an abandoned condition off Loheiya on 1st January and restored to her owners, no special incidents to re port or suspicious dhows encountered. A stay of three days was made at Pelican Island for the purpose of completing the survey of this area com menced by “ Clematis ” in April 1929, and for the purpose of accurately fixing the position of some islands in the vicinity hitherto not charted and near the main inshore channel. Ship left the reef area on 8th January and after a stay of 24 hours at Mohammed Gul arrived and effected a rendezvous with H. M. S. “ Dahlia ” at Port Sudan on 11th January, preparatory to that vessel’s depar ture for Malta to refit. L Slave Trade. During the period in question much useful information concerning the Slave Trade has been received from H. M. S. “ Dahlia ” and forwarded through the usual channels. Dhows (upwards of 50 in number) have been intercepted and board by both ships whenever practicable. ******** (c) The substance of information contained in Section B. (Aden—Kishin) paragraphs II to VIII has been communicated to Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, and to Political Resident, Aden, by separate letter. **##*##* Copies to :— The Secretary of the Admiralty.

In the afternoon, the Colonel and Officers of the 3rd Battalion Eritreo Galliano Regiment took us all over their barracks, one company were seen at recreational exercises, and we were afterwards entertained to tea, when the Colonel made a short speech. In the evening, His Excellency the Governor gave a dinner to which the principal Officers of the Colony were invited, and after the loyal toasts had been honoured, he made a most friendly speech, in which he stressed his earnest desire for lasting friendship and good-will between his country and the British Empire. A suitable reply was made by the Commanding Officer, thanking him for his wonderful hospitality, recalling the fact that we fought side by side during the Great War, and saying how greatly the camaradie of the officers of “ Lepanto ” had added to the pleasure of our visit. After dinner, the officers attended a Ball, given in our honour at the Officers’ Club, which was exceedingly well arranged. His Excellency was unable to attend owing to the serious illness of his wife. The party returned to Massawa next morning. (ii) Nothing could have exceeded the kindness of all the Italians met, from the Governor downwards, during the whole of our visit. They are undoubtedly very proud of their Colony, and it is indeed a beauti ful spot* The high lands, inlands, appear to be very fertile, plenty of corn is grown, great herds of cattle are in evidence everywhere, and there is no short age of fresh water. The roads are excellent, and a car can travel at 50 miles per hour quite com fortably across the plateaux* (Hi) The Secretary General impressed me as a very forceful personality^ well read, and intensely interested in our Navy* He is well up to date in his in formation, asked a few questions, but for the most part seemed only too willing to display his knowledge, and listen to his own voice. Both he and the Governor were very anxious to find put what we really thought of the American Navy, and of the French, and explained how necessary it was that Italy should possess a powerful fleet. (iv) The Native Battalions, each with about 20 Italian Officers given an impression of very high efficiency. Our visit to the Gallianos was intense y interesting, the lines were absolutely spotlessly clean, recreational exercises were entered into with zest, and good feeling obviously prevails between the men and their officers* (v) Both the Captain and the 1st Lieutenant of the “ Lepanto ’’ are newly ■joined, and appear most able officers. Hogardeo had been a Flag Lieutenant, and had attended the Peace Conference at Paris, and the Naval Conference at Washington. He struck me as likely to go far in his profession, as he is well read, and speaks languages well. I was much interested to hear that the Italians are building a second sailing ship for training cadets. The utmost good feeling prevailed between the officers of the two ships. (vi) An official dinner party was given on-board, after the return from Asmara, nine Italians, the maximum that can be accommodated, dining with the Commanding Officer, after which there was a small at home, a_ en e&lt; &gt; . c Officers of both ships, several from the “ Lepanto ” having already dined m the Ward Room. After the loval toasts, the Commanding Officer told the Commissioner of Massawa Vhat an interesting time had been spent at Asmara thanked Mm foi his courtesy during our stay at Massawa, and asked tha ns 1 Conveyed to His Excellency once more. (vii) The air station at Massawa is in charge of a Flight Lieutenant and possesses two seaplanes only.These planes made a flight of five hours duration on January 3rd, steering to the south. There are no aircraft at Asmara. Apparently the height lias introduced some difficulties in the way of their use, (viii) The Captain of the “ Lepantp ”, in addition to his executive duties in command, has an office and official residence ashore. He is in charge of all the lights on the coast of Eritrea, and has control of the W|T Stations in the Colony. By virtue of his appointment as the Senior Naval Officer, he ranks 4th in order of precedence at Asmara, coming directly after the Colonel Commandant of the Garrison, and before all the other Lieutenant-Colonels and Colonial Officers. The WjT Station at Asmara is in charge of a Naval Lieutenant. (ix) One Persian naval officer under training is borne in “ Lepanto A considerable number of Persian cadets are under training in the Italian fleet. (x) The ship sailed for Port Sudan net day, and the following signal was received from His Excellency the Governor of Eritrea, in response to my fare well signal Moi, ma famille, Fonctionnaires et Officiers de cette colonie vous sommes tres recoimaissants pour votre tres aimables expressions, que vous avez voulu nous addresser.

During my visit, His Excellency said several times that if we could pay another visit, he was very anxious that we should stay longer at Asmara, and teat I should bring up as many as possible of the ship’s company, including the football team. e fi *’ S l &lt; ' dan ’ diking to report.

When lunching with me, the Captain of the “ Baccarat ” mentioned that recently, when off Jeddah he had seen a “ black man ”, quite naked, standing on a reef in the open sea, with no boat near him. He wondered if he formed part of a cargo of slaves who had been dumped on the reef, and were being taken inshore in small boats. He did not investigate further. ##****#* Copies to :— Secretary of the Admiralty, and Senior Officer Red Sea Sloops, H. M.

Hejaz Government have been informed that Farhan Ibn Mashhor and some followers were allowed to enter Irak territory a few days ago and are residing near Busaiyeh post. Note continues as follows : “ the repeated promises made by the British (rovernment in their own name and in the name of the Governments of Koweit, Iraq and Trans-Jordania were to the effect that no rebel force should be allowed to cross the frontier and still less reside in territories of those Governments. I cannot understand the reasons which have led the British Government to allow Farhan Ibn Mashhur and his party to take refuge in Iraqi territory. Farhan In Mashhur is a criminal in the opinion of the British Government who have made representations about him in the past and he is also a criminal in the opinion of the Hejaz Government.” Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs therefore officially requests his extradition and enquires how this may best be effected.

From my note (based on Foreign Office telegram No. 157 to Jeddah) Your Majesty will have learnt that the Awazim were informed that they would be denied access to or supplies from Koweit and that they were being treated as part of the contending forces. His Majesty’s Government are not aware whether this tribe has returned to the effective control of Y our Majesty or whether it is co-operative with the rebellious forces. They regret, however, to inform Your Majesty that three serious raids have been perpetrated by the Awazim into the eastern portion of Koweit territory, on the 21st, 23rd and 28th of December in the course of which over fourteen hundred sheep have been carried off by the raiders. These raids were made possible owing to the steps taken by the Sheikh of Koweit at the re quest of Your Majesty s Government for the removal of Koweit tribes from the vicinity of the Frontier leaving the shepherds without protection. His Majesty’s overnmen recognise the difficulties which Your Majesty may experience m maintaining an effective control of the Awazim at this moment.

Your orders regarding wholly un conditional surrender have been communicated to the local Royal Air Force com mander who is attempting in co-operation with Iraq Police to expel rebels who have crossed Nejd frontier and camped on Koweit Iraq border. Latest report indi cates that Mutair leaders, Dawish and Ibn Hithlain, are in Koweit territory and refuse either to surrender unconditionally or to return to Nejd. Presence of women and children with the rebels precludes air action by the Royal Air Force. In the meantime, messages received from Ibn Saud grow more threatening. In the circumstances, Royal Air Force commander proposes to at tempt to effect arrest of the two leaders to-morrow. I have given instructions that he should hand over prisoners to Iraq Police ’f arrested in Iraq and to concert measures for their disposal with Political agent at Koweit if arrested in Koweit territory.

Royal Air Force armoured cars are now at Jahra temporarily weatherbound. Mutair rebel(s) with women and children are moving south as a result of aerial reconnaissances accompanied by occasional warning bomb(s). Ibn Saud is moving east along Nejd-Koweit border with his whole force. Entirely new situa tion has thus been created and if bombing is continued effect will be either that rebels will break back or that they will be driven into jaws of Ibn Saud when H. M. Government will have to face stigma of responsiblity for massacre of women and children which may result. Bombing has accordingly been temporarily sus pended and will not be resumed pending further instructions. I adhere to view expressed in my telegram of 31st December, No. 456 [Serial No. (91)] that best hope of satisfactory outcome is to accept surrender of rebels on the lines suggested. In discussing case Ibn Mashar to-day King told me that he could not agree to hand oyer any rebel refugee to Ibn Saud against his will as this would be grave violation of tribal custom—even if surrender had been unconditional. He added that if &gt; lei m of Koweit agreed to such a proceeding his daughter would remain for ever(y) unmarnageable. Enclosure.

Telegram from the High Commissioner of Iraq, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, No. 14, dated the 7th January 1930. Prime Minister asked to see me this morning and brought letter from himself marked very urgent gist of which is as follows. Begins. Since Bin Sand is now encamped close to Iraq Frontier, Iraq Government feel excellent opportunity presents itself for a joint meeting in order to discuss settlement of outstanding questions between the two Governments. Faisal is so impressed with the necessity for seizing this opportunity of making friendly overtures to a neighbouring King on his borders That he is ready to meet Bin Sand himself either in neutral zone or at some convenient place near the frontier for discussion of these questions. Iraq Government request me to convey this invitation to Bin Sand. Ends. Prime Minister explained that Faisal is very anxious to try to dissipate present atmos phere of distrust between Iraq and Nejd Governments by personal meeting with Bin Sand and would be glad if I could take part in conference which would probably be attended by Prime Minister and Cornwallis. Matters for discussion include (a) disposal of rebel refugees (6) return of loot (c) breaches of Article 4 of Bahrah Agreement (d) extradition (e) Treaty of Bon Yoisinage (/) mutual recognition of two Governments and exchange of representatives (g) desert posts which is regarded as most important of all. Primafac e, I am in favour of this proposal as feeling of hostility between Iraq and Nejd could hardly be worse* and there seems a chance that even if conference fails to solve any outstanding questions way might be prepared by personal contact for a better mutual understanding. Since it is un likely that Bin Saud will remain near Iraq border for long, I request instructions by telegram as to whether I am authorised to despatch invitation to Bin Saud as suggested. If meeting approved and takes place before question of rebel refugees In Koweit Is settled I suggest that representative of Koweit should be invited to attend. (118) {Received on 1st February 1930, ivith Political Secretary s letter No. 3, dated the 16th January 1930). Letter from the Foreign Office, to Colonial Office, No. E.-6762/2322/91, DATED THE 7TH JANUARY 1930. I am directed by Mr. Secretary Henderson to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 69184/29 of the 27th December [Serial No. (73)] in which it was suggested that a protest should be made to the Hejazi Government regarding certain activities of Sheikh Hafiz Wahba in Koweit. 2. In reply, I am to request you to inform Lord Passfield that the Secretary of State recognises that the demand addressed by Sheikh Hafiz M ahba to the Sheikh of Koweit regarding the Awazim, mentioned in the telegram of the 15th December from the Resident in the Persian Gulf, appears to have been made m a discourteous manner. Mr. Henderson is however disposed to think, as regards the substance of that demand, that it is not altogether unnatural that Sheikh Hafiz Wahba should have considered that it fell within the scope of his duties, as liaison officer between King Ibn Saud and the authorities in Koweit hi respect of matters concerning the activities of the rebels and the King s operations against them, to discover and report to the King information affecting the position of the Awazim— a tribe owing allegiance to King Ibn Saud and originally forming part of his forces MC42FD\ 106 • X x^^ rphpls—whose status at the moment was uncertain. I n cperatnig agai. th^ ^ ^ unfortunate confusion which arose in. connection “tl the sunnosed hitry of the Awazim into Koweit territory, Mr. Henderson would prefer P not to address a protest to the Hejazi Government regarding a matter connected with that incident. . ■ 3 T | ie i ns tances of the quasi-consular activities of Sheikh Hafiz Wahha re- fprred'to in the telegram mentioned above hardly seem to be of a sufficiently fmportont nature to justify in themselves an official protest. 4 In these circumstances Mr. Henderson trusts that Lord Passfield will share his view that it is preferable not to instruct His Majesty’s Charge deAffaires at ledda in the manner suggested m your letter under reply, unless the future actions of Sheikh Hafiz Wahba in Koweit furnish further and stronger grounds for objection, 5.

Telegram P., from the Secretary of State for the Colonies, to the High Commissioner of Iraq, and the Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated the 10th January 1930. It seems clear that m the event of rebel leaders being handed over to Ibn Saud, His Majesty’s Government, and in a lesser degree the Sheikh of Kuwait, will incur considerable odium as having committed an act which is contrary to Arab tradi tion. If leaders are handed over to him, Ibn Saud may either cause them to be put to death or may pardon them. In the former event His Majesty s Govern ment would apparently incur blame for having committed act of inhumanity and breach of Arab custom, m the latter even Da wish anct other rebel leaders would, doubtless, prosecute further raids against Iraq and Kowait either with or without the direct encouragement of Ibn Saud and would again become a thorn in our flesh. It has been suggested to me that a possible solution of the poblem would be to deport to some such^ place as Cyprus such of the leaders as would be likely to be put to death by. Ibn Saud or, if pardoned, to be a source of future trouble to us, and to keep them there in confinement or under close surveillance tor a number ot years and until they can safely be released. Ibn Saud is unlikely, it is suggested to punush the rank and file of the rebel tribes with undue severity and these could be surrendered to him on such conditions as seem desirable. Moieover he wo108 n lonp 1 as the rebel leaders were definitely irnmobi- liave no le f&gt; was promised that they would not be permitted to re turn to Arabia without ^ of j lis Majesty’s Government have not yet The other suggestion and before this is done I should be grateful been 'llffnd also to learn- f01 ^° U (1) V whether the suggested solution would be likely to accord with local sentiment, (2) approximately how many persons, men and women, it would be neces- sary to deport, whpt her the rebel leaders and their relatives could be relied upon to (3) provide the funds necessary for their deportation and subsequent maintenance or whether these would have to be provided by His Majesty’s Government. A very early reply would be appreciated A similar telegram is being sent to Bushire/Baghdad to whom your reply should be repeated. Enclosure 1. ^ ci Ttufopah P from the Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Secretary or State foe the Colonies, dated the 11th January 1930. (Repeated to Baghdad.) I agree with proposals contained m your private and personal telegram of 10th January which are similar to those put forward by Baghdad. 1 believe settle ment would accord with local sentiment and would saleguard position of Sheikh of Koweit. I am making enquiries from Dickson about (2) and (3) and \\ill tele graph further. Suggestion contained in my telegram 10th January Ro. 19 (No. 56 to Baghdad) may therefore be ignored though Sheikh might suitably meet Bin Sand later. I suggested possibility of settlement on Arab lines through Sheikh as way out of the difficulty only because I thought that His Majesty’s Government might feel their hands tied to some extent by previous assurances to Bin baud. Enclosure 2. Telegram P., from the Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, No. 21, dated the 11th January 1930. Please refer to Baghdad telegram No. 30 of January 10th. Dickson is in my view a good choice for negotiations with Ibn Saud as he knows him personally. Moreover, he gets on very well with Arabs and is a very good linguist and if given free hand should do very well. He is however somewhat temperamental. If Air Officer Commanding’s representative is senior to him (as Burnett is) latter would presumably be head of mission and Dickson would be practically relegated to role of interoreter. He is not well suited for this and I much fear there would be friction. He has himself asked not to be sent in this capacity. I recommend therefore that Royal Air Force representative should be junior to Dickson who as Political Officer should be head of mission. I have not repeated this to Baghdad. Enclosure 3.

Telegram P., prom the High Commissioner for Iraq, to the Secretary op State for the Colonies, No 33, dated the 11th January 1930. (Re peated to Bushier, No. 2-S.) Referenoe your Private and Personal telegram No. 17 of 10th January. You will see from my telegram of 10th January, No. 30, which crossed your private and personal telegram, that I have made identical recommendation regarding disposal of leaders. I also agree as regards rank and file, but I feel that first essential is to inform Ibn Baud at once of His Majesty’s Government’s intention to keep in their own hands negotiations as to disposal, otherwise prisoners will disperse and start nego tiating direct with Ibn Baud with the result that Koweit and Iraq claims will be ignored. Answers to your questions are as follows :—- 1. I am advised that solution which you suggest, as amplified in my te’egram No. 30, would accord with local Arab sentiment. Internment of leaders outside Arabia would probably be unpopular with Iraq Government who hoped to use them as lever to extract concession from Ibn Sand. But they have no justification for this attitude. 2. I will telegraph numbers later. There are probably a few more Sheikhs who would not dare to return to Nejd or who would be thorn in our flesh if they did. 3. His Majesty’s Government should be prepared to pay for costs of deporta tion and probably of maintenance. I will however make enquiries on latter point. Burnett is waiting here for instructions from His Majesty’s Government which were requested in my telegram No. 30 to which I shall be grategul for very early reply. I consider that his presence at meeting with Ibn Saud is of greatest importance. Enclosure 5. Telegram from the Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, No. 22, dated the 12th January 1930. Baghdad private and personal telegram of yesterday has just reached me. Prom this and from concluding paragraph of his telegram No. 30 of 10th January, it is clear that Humphry’s view is that Brunett should be head of mission. Apart from personal factor which I have pointed out this seems to me to put mission on wuong basis. I take it that we are sending Dickson who is personal friend of Ibn Saud to have friendly discussion regarding disposal of rebels, and I imagine that His Majesty’s Government would be ready to meet Ibn Sand’s wishes as far as possible subject to two conditions— (1) That settlement arrived at shall not offend local sentiment, and (2) That Ibn Saud shall give guarantees that persons handed over to him shall receive reasonable treatment and shall not be put to death. If this view is correct it wou’d seem undesirable to send mission headed by military officer “ to announce orders.” If we can settle disposal of refugees in the first instance then question of Koweit and Iraq claims and other cognate matters might be left for discussion at subsequent meeting between Faisal, Ibn Saud and Sheikh of Kowiet. Another solution of the difficulty would be for me to head Mission myself taking Dickson as my assistant. In this case there would be no objection to Burnett being the Royal Air Force representative if Baghdad still (word omitted) there wouid be no objection. .

Bnllowins is gist of a note dated 10th January which I have received from Arthur Minister for Foreign Affairs in which he presses for a categorical answer to demands already made for delivery of rebels and states that procrastination would have most serious results. He learns that rebels have been permitted to cross the frontier of Koweit. This, is contrary to the undertaking given that, if they crossed the boundary, they would be expelled by force. Their movements within Koweit and Iracj. boundaries without action being taken against them in accordance with assurances given has produced serious doubts as to the friendly intentions of His Majesty's Government repeatedly ex pressed. He adds that the policy of lajssez faire would unfavourably affect the good relations between the two countries. ■ He requests to be informed with all frankness and at the earliest opportunity of the position which His Majesty’s Government are taking up. In a second note of the same date, despatched on receipt by him of the news of Dawish’s surrender, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs requests rebellion leaders, particularly Dawish Bin Mashhur, Bin Lami and Bin Hithlain, should be handed over. Acceptance of their surrender is, he says, contrary to the undertakings of His Majesty’s Government.

In his general utterances acting Minister for Foreign Affairs is openly accusing His Majesty’s Government of breach of faith. To this effect he has spoken strongly to a party of journalists representing leading Egyptian papers who have been attend- mg as guests of the Hedjaz Government anniversary celebrations here. 1 he action of the acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, I am inclined to think lias not met with Emir s entire approval, and although 1 can sympathise with the formers feelings, I think, a somewhat curt reply might have a salutary effect, in view r of tenour of his notes. « bu eject to your approval I would therefore propose to limit myself to stating the matter in question is being dealt with direct between His Majesty’s Political agent at Koweit and the King and that after consultation with the latter arrange- ments are being made for a meeting with the King in order to discuss with him personally the various points at issue.

Reference to my personal and private telegram, 11th January. Dickson reports that each Sheikh would probably be accompanied by about ten persons. He con siders it \ery improbable that relatives could find costs of deportation or mainte nance since sole wealth of Bedouins is their flocks and herds and they have little or no cash. In any case once tribes have been surrendered only means of recovering cost would be through Ibn Saud. This would probably be difficult since he is certain to oppose deportation.

(Here insert text of my immidately following telegram). You will see that only difference between Ibn Sand's attitude and that of Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, as reported in Jeddah telegram S.-7 and to Foreign Office, is that Minister for Foreign Affairs is even more uncompromising. While agreeing that a curt reply would be salutary I suggest instead of draft contained in Jeddah telegram No. 8 the following message should be sent through me to Ibn Saud and repeated to Jeddah f,or identical communication mutatis mutandis to Minister for Foreign Affairs. Begins. I have repeated to his Britannic Majesty’s Government Your Majesty's message communicated to me through Political Agent at Koweit and I am instructed to reply as follows His Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment have never promised to surrender the persons of rebel leaders to Your Majesty. Such proceeding would as Your Majesty is (group omitted), be entirely contrary to all local custom and international usage. As has been already explained to Your Majesty the only thing that prevented H. M. Government from expelling rebel tribes was that they were accompanied by their women and children against whom it was impossible to take military action. Your Majesty was warned of this contin gency as long ago as the middle of October. {Vide Foreign Office telegram of 14th October No. 107 to Jeddah). Ends. Enclosure.

He said that the present situation was being exploited by our enemies, indicating Sheikh Fuad Hamza and the Syrian party, to our detriment, and he gave me to understand privately and confidentially that there was a possibility of a hostile demonstration before the British Legation. 2. I told him that the question of the disposal of the rebels was being dealt with direct between the King and the local British authorities and that I had every hope that the whole position would be cleared up to the satisfaction of all concerned. The Governor was obviously worried and was anxious for some information which would serve to allay fears and counteract propaganda against us. I thought it as well therefore to state to him that the position as I myself saw it was that His Majesty’s Government had been asked to co-operate in suppressing the rebellion, that British forces had been sent to the frontiers of Iraq and Koweit for this purpose, that the rebels had been caught between two fires and that they had thus been forced to surrender. There was, I said, no other course but to accept such a surrender, particularly as the rebels were accompanied by women and children, and it was simply a question of arranging for their disposal,—a question which in the nature of things must necessarily envolve negotiation and which must have regard both to Arab custom and to British tradition. I added that it had not been a case of giving refuge to rebels, as had been misrepresented here, but simply that these rebels had been received as enemies, disarmed and rendered inocuous pending their ultimate disposal. 3. I then went on to discuss the harm that would be done by any ill-considered action such as a demonstration here while the negotiations were in progress with the King, and the bad effect that such an event must inevitably have on our relations and on British public opinion. 4. I think that my words had some effect as the Governor left in a more cheerful frame of mind, and he will I am sure take all possible steps to forestall any thing in the nature of a demonstration. I am however myself also taking steps privately to' counteract hostile propaganda. 5. I should add that the Governor is personally opposed to Sheikh Fuad Hamza and his policy, and there is no love lost between them. His influence is however greatly inferior to that of the Syrian party which has been gaining strength while the King has been away. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s High Commissioners for Iraq and Transjordan, the Secretary to the Government of India in the P oreign and Political Department, the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf and the Politi cal Agent at Koweit.

As regards (Hi) it is undesirable that Political Agent should include in his letter anything more than passing reference to Dawish’s overtures and admission of Awazim, since British Agent Jeddah has already been instructed to report both incidents to Ibn Saud. In general it is undesirable that matters m which questions of policv are involved and on which British Agent, Jeddah has been instructed to communicate with Hejaz Government should be dealt with m personal corres pondence between Dickson and Ibh Saud which should remain oi private and MC42FD114 personal nature.

The members have been instructed to give precedence to vital reforms according to the order of importance, and to communicate with specialists with a view to engaging them for the work. The committee has commenced their labours by a decision to engage an engineer proficient in geo ogy and metallurgy to make surveys and borings in certain districts. They have also decided to construct a quay and port at Jedda according to a modern technical style and to engage an engineer to advise upon the project. The following are the notices issued by the Committee — 1. The Government of the Hejaz and Nejd desires to engage a qualified technical specialist holding high diplomas in geology and metallurgy so that he may undertake the necessary surveys and borings in the spots to be appointed by the Government, to submit full reports regarding his discoveries and give estimates of the expenditure necessary for the extr action of such metals or minerals. The engineer should bring with him (presumably at his own expense) the in struments required for the work. The appointment will be by contract for one year and the Government reserves the right of renewing it for another year. Applications should be addressed to “ The Committee for the study of projects of Beform, Department of Finance, Mecca 2.

ANNEXURE. “ His Majesty’s Government have been informed by the British Agent at Jedda of Your Majesty’s Note of November 23rd regarding the Transjordan situa tion which has long been engaging their attention. Your Majesty suggests three possible solutions of the problem of raiding and counter-raiding. ^ Of these His Majesty’s Government regret that for reasons of general policy which Your Majesty will readily understand, they cannot contemplate either the second or the third. The measures which they have already taken or are in process of taking are however practically identical with the first solution advocated in Your Majesty’s note. In view of Your Majesty’s acceptance of the suggestion put forward in Mr. Bond’s note of July 13th for the appointment of a British investigator to deal with the question of the restitution of loot, and of the recent unconditional acceptance of that proposal by His Highness the Amir of Transjordan, they are proceeding forthwith to the selection of a suitable officer for this purpose who will be instructed to proceed to the affected area at the earliest possible moment. On the receipt of his report His Majesty’s Government will proceed to give their arbitral awards and to take the necessary measures for their execution in Transjordan. Awards will also be communicated to Your Majesty without delay for similar action in Your Majesty’s territories. As regards measures to be taken to prevent attacks and to punish offenders, punitive action has within the last few months been taken in a large number of cases against Transjordan tribes convicted of having carried out raids into Nejd and Hejaz, and in some cases loot has actually been restored, whereas no loot has yet been returned by Your Majesty’s tribesmen. Measures taken in the case of Transjordan tribes have however been rendered exceedingly difficult by the fact that no corresponding measures have apparently been taken against Hejaz and Nejd tribes who ha^ e been guilty of raids against Transjordan on a more extensive scale. In view however of the increasingly unsatisfactory situation as regards raids both from Transjordan and from Your Majesty’s dominions, Flis Majesty’s Govern ment are now reconsidering the whole of the problem in consultation with the High Corrmiissioner of Transjordan”.

T have the honour to report that H. E. Sheikh Ahmad reported to me this mon im-that it had come to his knowledge that the minor rebel leader know,, as “ Al-Dahaina” a man of the Ataiba tribe, entered the eity of Kuwait about 10 days ago, very secretly and disguised as a wood-cutter. Aftei spending 3 days in the town in the grass hut of an obscure person of Ataiba origin living in the Safaa (market place), he as secretly departed. From enquiries made by myself and the head of the Police in Kuwait, it appears the man came on a begging visit and wanted money. I think it right that you should know of the above, as by this time Abdullah an-Nafisi will probably have heard the story in the same way as I did, and will have informed Sheikh Hafith Wahba. His Excellency the Sheikh was at pains to explain that no one knows al- Dahaina in Kuwait except a few of his tribes people, and it was easy to pass the guards at the main gate, (143) (Received on 15th February 1930. with Political Secretary's letter No. 5, dated the 30th January 1930.)

The Iraq Government do not think that such action on their part would be contrary to the provisions of the promise, His Excellency the Prime Minister will be glad to learn whether the views of His Britannic Majesty s Government ns regards the interpretation of the promise agree with those of the Iraq Government as stated hereinabove. The Iraq Government are always prepared to give effect to the promise in accordance with the above interpretation, and they do not think that any responsibility would devolve upon them in consequence of delaying the des patch of the Company, since they are not bound to expel the rebels at the very time the latter cross the frontiers of Iraq. Enclosure 1. Letter from H. E. the High Commissioner for ’Iraq, to the President of the Council, of Ministers, Baghdad, Ho. P.O.-305-Secret, dated the 26th December 1929. I am directed by His Excellency the High Commissioner to inform Your Excellency that the position in the Southern Desert appears to be as follows. The Royal Air Force armoured cars were operating in the Batin area up to December 18th with the object of expelling the Ajman rebels from the Koiveit- Iraq area. When the Commandant of Police at Julaida and Captain Glubb applied urgently for assistance, the Royal Air Force car moved westwards at once to facilitate the extrication of the police from the neutral zone in accord ance with the instructions given to the police by the Ministry of Interior. North of the neutral zone in ’Iraq territory, Ibn Mashhur was discovered by the Royal Air Force. Captain Glubb ordered him to leave Iraq territory and on his refusal the Royal Air Force assisted the police to effect his surrender. The Royal Air Force cars have now returned to the Batin and are engaged, in response to an urgent request from Koweit, in completing the operation of ex- uelling the Ajman from the Batin area, after which the Air Officer Command ing will recall the Chief Staff Officer. It is suggested that orders be sent to the Commandant of Police to co operate with the Chief Staff Officer by preventing the Ajman from breaking back north-westwards into Iraq territory. The responsibility of the Ministry of Interior for the Southern Desert, of course, remains intact. It is regretted that, owing to the Christmas holidays, it has not been, possible to communicate with Your Excellency earlier in writing. Enclosure 2.

I am directed by His Excellency the Prime Minister to thank you for the explanations supplied by you regarding the situation in the desert and to in form you that in accordance with instructions issued by him to the Ministry of Interior, the latter Ministry has issued the necessary orders by telegram to the Police Commandant to the effect that he should co-operate with the Chief Staff Officer in preventing the Ajman from entering Iraq territory. Enclosure 3. Letter from H. E. the High Commissioner for Iraq, to the President of the Council of Ministers, Baghdad, No. P.O.-308-Secret, dated the 28th December 1929.

At the same time, His Excellency realises that a situation may arise in which bodies of rebels, accompanied by their women and children having suc ceeded in entering Iraq, may refuse to leave even under threat of force. In that case it is not His Excellency’s intention to suggest that the Iraq Govern ment should' arrange to shoot down the rebels and to undertake military opera tions against them. In such an event, if the rebels declined to quit Iraq terri- tory His Excellency wishes to enquire whether the Iraq Government would bo prepared to take steps to ensure the unconditional surrender of the rebels and to disarm and intern them, pending negotiations for the settlement of their case. This would incidentally afford the Iraq _ Government the opportunity of obtaining redress from such internees as had inflicted injury on Iraq subjects in the past. If the Iraq Government are prepared to fulfil their responsibility in the maimer described above, His Excellency the High Commissioner is ready to try to obtain by telegram the concurrence of His Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment in this procedure. It is to be understood that the Iraq Government would not thereby be absolved from their undertaking to use their best endeavours to prevent the entry of the rebels into Iraq territory. An early reply is requested and a telegram will be despatched to London immediately on its receipt.

Durmg the past years many discussions in connection with these questions took place between representatives of His Britannic Majesty’s Government and the Iraq Government of one part and representatives of His Majesty King Ibn Sa ud of the other part. In spite, however, of the righteousness of ’Iraqi’s point of view and of the fact that ’Iraq was supported by H. B. M.’s Government all these discussions failed as a result of King Ibn Sa’ud’s obduracy and his per sistence in his own views which were incompatible wdth the provisions of the treaties and agreements concluded between the two countries. As. Your Excellency is aware, Ibn Sa ’ud is now engaged in the preparation of disciplinary expeditions to be directed against his rebel subjects, and that in fulfilment of the promise given to him both His Britannic Majesty’s and the Iraq Governments have adopted the necessary measures to assist Ibn Sa ’ud in the execution of this policy of his. The ’Iraq Government consider that they have open to them a valuable opportunity for the solution of the problems arising between ’Iraq and Najd, and that this opportunity should be seized for an attempt to be made to induce Ibn Sa’ud to accept the ’Iraq Government’s point of view in regard to these problems. The ’Iraq Government believe that m view of the critical position in which Ibn Sa’ud now finds himself and of his imperative need for the assistance to be accorded to him by His Britannic Majesty’s and the Traq Governments, he (Ibn Sa’ud) will be prepared to take into due consideration such advice as may be tendered to him at the present time more readily than at any other time. Therefore, the Traq Government suggest that Ibn Sa ’ud should be approach ed now on the subject of the settlement of the above mentioned questions and they would be glad to be acquainted with Your Excellency’s views in this connection as early as possible. Enclosure. Letter from H. E. the High Commissioner for Iraq, Baghdad, to the President of the Council of Ministers, Baghdad, No. P.O.-9-Confidential, dated the 14th January 1930. My dear Prime Minister, $ I have received Your Excellency’s letter No. 3241, dated the 28th of Decem ber, 1929 [Serial No. (145)], about Traq-Najd relations, and I have been con sidering the suggestion contained in it that the time is now favourable to attemptm 7 ^ffTmnpnt of all outstanding questions with His Majesty io arrange a ^ eTie { a ^ 0 S \ vitll Y our Excellency that King Ibn Sa’ud may quite King Ibn Sa’ud.

In the meanwhile I should be grateful if I could be supplied with a list of the Questions which the ’Iraq Government desire to settle, and if Your Excellency would at the same time give some indication ol the procedure which Your Excellency has in mind. T tike this oPDortnnitv of reminding Your Excellency of the correspondence ending with Mr Urges’ letter No. P.0,260, dated the 24th of October 1929, regarding the Arbitral Convention which rt is proposed to conclude with the Naid Government and .to inform Your Excellency that the latter have now revived the question and have asked that a further communication from His Britannic Majesty’s Government on the subject may be expedited^ The Secre- tarv of State has therefore asked by telegraph that the ’Iraq Government’s comments on the proposed agreement may be communicated to him as soon as possible. This indicates that King Ibn Sa’ud may bimself be anxious to clear up outstanding questions. I suggest therefore that Your Excellency should inform me without delav of the views of the ’Iraq Government on the proposed arbitral Convention and’that Your Excellency should address me later in greater detail regarding the ’Iraq Government’s proposals for the settlement of other outstanding questions.

I am directed to inform you that His Excellency the Prime Minister has now received the following reply from the Ministry of the Interior “ The Ministry of the Interior had asked the Southern Desert authorities to withdraw the tribes from the Neutral zone, and the said authorities replied that that was impossible at present owing to the scarcity of water and grazing in ‘Iraq territory. On the 18th instant the Ministry of the Interior issued instructions to the Southern Desert authorities for the withdrawal of the ’Iraq Police forces from Julaida Post and for the adoption of Busaiyah as a base for the motor cars force and the establishment of a temporary post within ’Iraq territory close to the frontier for the purpose of facilitating reconnaissance and the protection of ’Iraqi tribes, and also asked the said authorities to withdraw the whole force from the Neutral zone and to take such steps as they could for the withdrawal of the ’Iraqi tribes as -well with them. The Ministry of the Interior has now learnt that the withdrawal of the ’Iraq Police to a place 14 miles to the north east of “ Hunaiyah ” (or Hilda) Bund, within ’Iraq territory, has been accomplished.” Letter from the Secretary to the Council of Ministers, Baghdad, to the Political Secretary to H. E. the High Commissioner for ’Iraq, Baghdad, No. 3252-Secret, dated the 29th December 1929. His Excellency the Prime Minister and his colleagues have seen your letter No. P.O.|308, dated 28th December 1929 [Enclosure 3 of Serial No. (143)], regarding the interpretation of the undertaking given to Ibn Sa ’ud, and after deliberation on the subject they agreed in considering that the intention of the undertaking was that in the event of the rebels succeeding in entering ’Iraq the ’Iraq Government would be compelled to pursue them and force them to quit, but that if the ’Iraq forces proved unable to drive the rebels away in the direction of Najd and the latter succeeded in escaping from the hands of the said forces into other quarters, the ’Iraq Government would not bear responsi bility for their escape. The policy which the ’Iraq Government intends to pursue in the event of the rebels entering ’Iraq is first to warn them to quit ’Iraq territory, and if they failed to comply with such warning to threaten to turn them out by force. If they declined to quit in spite of the threat to use force and insisted on remain ing in ’Iraq with their children and families, the ’Iraq Government would there upon compel them to surrender to her unconditionally, and when this has been done would disarm them and intern them at a place removed from the frontier pending the result of negotiations for the settlement of their case. As pointed# 125 but by H. E. the High Commissioner, this procedure would afford the Iraq Government the opportunity of punishing such of the interned rebels who had carried out raids against ’Iraqi tribes and of recovering the loot from them.

Many reports have been circulated abroad regarding Feisal-ed-Damsh and 1 ■ ,.Xiii nI1 o suD'norters with the result that certain interested persons desirous o fisSTtroS! waters represented the rebels’ weakness as strength and their disunion as combination threatening the very integrity of Nejd This was when the rebels were seeking refuge m neighbouring countries supported merely by false hopes inspired in them by interested and mean persons who have never rendered ahy useful service to the Arab nation. The fact that His Majesty the King did not take immediate measures against the rebels afforded’ them some encouragement and led to doubts and apprehensions, whereas the situation, as revealed to anyone in close touch with the tread of events, may be summed up as follows :— After the repeated defeat of the rebels in evety pitched battle with the Khm’s forces, they fled Seeking shelter in Koweit, thinking that they may be sufficiently reinforced to resume their raids on those travelling m the desert and to renew 'their disturbance of public security. They took for granted that assistance would be forthcoming from those who had promised to support them, and Who, in reality, had neither power nor authority.. Such was the situation of the rebels a few months ago when they discovered that the King's forces, in overwhelming numbers, had practically encircled them .on every side. His Majesty’s Government had then two ends in view, first to take punitive measures against their rebellious subjects who had disturbed the peace by raiding the territories of the countries on the frontiers of Nejd and secondly, to ascertain the intentions of the neighbouring countries regarding the rebels, particularly as to whether these Governments would carry out their undertakings or leave the rebels unmolested. The shelter afforded the rebels by the Govern ment of Koweit, and the hesitation of the said Government to come to a deci sion regarding them forced His Majesty the King to suspend operations, as he Was anxious to avoid an encounter with the rebels in the territory of a neighbour ing country. His Majesty’s earnest desire was to respect the rights of that country and to observe his agreement. It is needless to say that the Hejaz- Nejd Government have always carried out their undertakings although the authorities on the other side have failed to observe them. The rebels, of whose raids and attacks the neighbouring Governments and principalities had pre viously complained, were enabled to obtain provisions. The fact about which there is not the least doubt is that the rebels have never set afoot any serious movement in the territory of Nejd nor has their insidious propaganda affected any region within the boundaries of Nejd, for Whenever such an attempt was made, His Majesty’s forces intercepted ariu routed! them so that they enjoyed no relief except in the shelter of the territory of a neighbouring countries. _ The Governments on the frontiers of Nejd should have observed their undertakings by refusing to afford refuge to those who had deprived their own subjects of security and peace. The rebels have, on the contrary, been allowed to obtain provisions and arms, have been treated with every consideration and have moved about without any let or hindrance. Whenever these Governments were asked to reconsider their attitude, they ignored the harms which migffit befall them by failing to observe their under takings, by stirring up dissension among the Arabs, creating rancours by ally' mg themselves with those who were their bitter enemies but yesterday, by en couraging highwaymen and by violating the time of neighbourliness. His Majesty’s Government had to draw the attention of those Governments to the violation resulting from giving refuge to the rebels.

Aden.—I called on the Political Resident, and discussed the information I had acquired at Zeila, concerning the slave trade. He seemed much interested, and stated that it was his intention to endeavour to obtain some information from Arabia as to the numbers of slaves, arriving on the coast, during the year. As regards the round number of one thousand, mentioned by M. Zaphiro, and in the report from Zeila (see my No. 2|514|6 of 1 November, 1929), bir Steward Symes was frankly sceptical, and pointed out that the use of such a number might mean anything, “ just a crowd ”, say, in the language oi the bazaar. It was at his request that I forwarded a copy of my letter to him, to the British Minister at Addis Ababa. I sailed for Perim as soon as the mail had been received, carrying out a •patrol of the coast en route, and searching some dhows off Sheik Seyd m tne early morning. 3 . The Manager of the Coal Company, Mr. Davey, who acts as Government Agents was still on leave, and his duties w f ere J’ el '^ ? a f rr, ® h bv Mr. Pape. The usual calls were exchanged, 134 tons of very good a „ a i n st were received, and games of football, hockey and cricket were played a B a ie local teams. I sailed on patrol on the morning of the 5th, and proceeded up the Yemen iast, boarding or examining all dhows sighted. Several were found rdfht^Vows' weighted :eded north and anchored off Moshg for the n g _ ^ i;|lte;nding to iring the dark hours, and at dayligh, P p. * f ore noon, the wind rry out boat P ;ck ®f tin | ° f th ^ a ° d n^dhows were to be seen, and so I decided leXshelfeffrdtcSTfflhe Northern and of Jebel Sukur for the night. Next morning, I resumed my patrol to the Southward, and proceeded to den to replenish the refrigerator.131 •pwh me at only, is available at Aden, and as such meat cannot be put into the refrigerator until all the frozen meat therein has been expended, it is neces- sa?y to replenish as soon as possible after existing supplies are exhausted. Port Sudan is the only place where supplies of already frozen meat can be obtained. 4 Aden —I had intended to leave Aden for Jibuti to embark Sir Harold and LadyKittermaster on the 10th, but on the afternoon of that day I received in- formation that they would not arrive at Jibuti until the afternoon of the 15th, so l deterinlned to resume my patrol of the Gulf of Aden, and of the Straits of Bab-el-Mand'eb. 5 The Sowabih or Brothers Islands were visited, the ship anchoring off Sheikh Sevd and off Perim on the nights of the 11th and 12th, respectively, The ceremony laid down for the observance of Armistice Day was carried out at Sea on November 11th. A careful look-out was kept at night for dhows approaching from the South- ward but none were seen. The moon happened to be at the full during this period, so that I did not anticipate the appearance of a slave dhow. I put into Perim for water on the morning of the 14th, and sailed for Jibuti next morning. 6 . Jibuti—I was met on arrival by the British Vice-Consul Mr. Salmon, and arranged to call upon H. E. The Governor of French Somaliland next morn ing. M. Cochar'd, as always, was most friendly, and said how sorry he was that the ship had not been in harbour on Armistice Day, as would have been the case if Sir Harold Kittermaster had not been delayed. After a religious ceremony in the early morning, followed by a parade of ez-Service men, motor racing and acquatic sports were held, after which the Governor gave a dinner, followed by a Ball at the Stade lasting till 4 a.m. I heard afterwards that M. Cochard had wished for the presence of an English ship to add life to the proceedings. My call was returned by M. Algret, the Chef de Cabinet, and in the after noon as many officers as could be spared were invited to a reception at Govern ment House. Sir Harold Kittermaster embarked about 7 p.m. and the ship left for Berbera the same evening. Sir Harold expressed his great relief to me that it was possible for him to be granted a passage, as failing one of H. M. ships, it is necessary to travel by steamers of the Cowasjee Dinshaw line. These vessels are very small, incon ceivably dirty, and really quite unsuitable for the use of high officials and their wives. 7. Berbera. —I had hoped to be able to remain two or three days at Berhera, in the place of the visit which had been planned for the previous month. On arrival, however, the Medical Officer of Health came on board, and stated that the port was in quarantine for small-pox, and it was inadvisable for anyone to land. In conversation, the Governor of British Somaliland told me how much the visits of British ships were appreciated by the inhabitants, and it is recommend ed that if other duties permit, one of the Red Sea sloops should visit Zeila and Berbera occasionally, as it seems probable that information, concerning the sla ^ 6 trade may be obtained by judicious enquiries. The ship sailed for Aden directly the Governor of British Somaliland and Lady Kittermaster had disembarked, to send an urgent cost case to the R. A. F. hospital. 8 . Perim. Calls were exchanged with Mr. Davey, the Manager of the Coal Company, and British Agent, who had just returned from leave. 102 tons of coal were received, after which opportunity was taken to pcabit ship, exercise boat sailing, etc. The Indian Police run a very anthusiastic hockey team, who are always very imve^all beei^dravm* ^ gameB P la F ed against them up to the present132 L tas ?«ii l tcs «i»oi!

On leaving Perim, I commenced a Patrol Northwards, but owing to the high winds no dhows were underweigh, and after closing the coast of Eritrea, to make sure that there were no dhows sailing to the Northward under the land, I steered South out of the Straits, and carried out a patrol of the South Arabian coast, as far as Pas al Ara, where I anchored for the night. At daylight next day, I patrolled Southwards past the Brothers Xslands, towards the Gulf of Tadjura, outside territorial waters, but once more, no dhows were sighted. * * # * * * # * 10. Aden .—The Political Resident has gone up country, to visit the Dala country, and his duties are being carried out by the First Political Assistant, Colonel Reilly. ■if:*****#* The ship sailed on the combined patrol arranged by the S. 0., R. S. on the morning of the 26th, in accordance with his instructions. 11. Combined Patrol .—The area allotted to “ Dahlia ” was the South Arabian coast, from about 30 miles East of Aden to the vicinity of Perim, an area of about 30 miles being covered daily. About 10-30, on the 26th, I sighted a dhow on my port bow, coming in my direction, from the Eastward, and course was altered to intercept her. It soon became apparent that the dhow was standing away, and doing her best to avoid me, so I altered course to cut her off. As I neared the dhow, she was seen to be standing well inshore, so I proceeded well to leeward of her, and as the water had shoaled, I anchored and sent away armed boarding boat under sail, to catch her, firing a round of blank at the same time. The dhow was by now very near the coa.st, on which heavy surf was break ing, and twice she was seen to run right inside the surf, when men on shore ap peared to wade into the water where she had been. My whaler was just about able to keep pace with the dhow, and was slightly to leeward and to sea-ward, so that she waspn a good! position to shut her off. It was evident that the men in the dhow realised this, for they suddenly ran the dhow ashore, and the crew of seven escaped inland, and hid in the bushes. In the meantime, I had sent away the other whaler to interrogate the men on shore, and I then got out the motor boat to go to the assistance of the first whaler who was about five miles to leeward, by the stranded dhow. At the same time, I reported the circumstances to the Resident Aden, a,s I considered the actions of the dhow were so remarkable that she was to be suspected of some illicit proceeding, such as smuggling drugs. The whaler near the dhow was unable to get alongside her, owing to. the shallow water, and very heavy surf, but it could be seen that she contained fishing tackle only, and the officer in charge decided to withdraw. .As soon as he began to haul off, the dhow’s crew came down to their boat, seeing this the whaler returned, whereupon the natives again ran away inland. As there was nothing more to be done, the motor boat and whaler returned to the ship, and the natives promptly manned the dhow, and sailed off in the direction of Crater. The second whaler also returned, and reported that the men on shore dis claimed all connected with the dhow. As the shallow water prevented any attempt at following her, I reported her escape to the Resident, Aden, and requested that her arrival at Crater should be awaited, and the crew interrogated. Only one other dhow was seen that day, and I anchored for the night to the East of Aden. Next day no dhows whatever were sighted, and I put into Aden p.m., to furnish a written report on the above incident to the Resident. In renlv he informed me that the dhow’s crew had been arrested, and in a statement P to the police they attributed 1 their action to fear, and stated that t ey had fled for their lives.133 As nothing incriminating was found, the only charge that could be brought against them was one of failing to submit to search when called upon to do so, but under the circumstances, I felt justified m requesting that no further action, beyond a caution that they should stop on the next occasion, should be taken against them. . It was most satisfactory that my close co-operation with the authorities at Aden, the dhow and crew were arrested immediately they arrived. (ii) I sailed on the morning of the 29th, but no dhows were sighted until the evening, when three were. stopped, soon after one another, all bound for Aden, one from Jibuti, and two men Zeila. I remained at sea during the night, and arrived at Sheik Seyd at 1,000 on the 30th to rendezvous with the S. 0. R. S. S. in accordance with his orders. (Hi) After exchange of information I proceeded through the small Strait to continue the patrol of the South Arabian coast, 12. Slave Trade Operations—The patrols carried out during the month have been described above, but although a considerable number of dhows have been stopped, nothing suspicious has been observed, apart from the episode on the 26th, which after all turned out to be of no importance. The small number of dhows met during the last few days of the month is certainly surprising, but can be attributed, in my opinion, to the strong winds which have been blowing in the Red Sea, and which have ke’pt the dhows in harbour. (ii) I have formed an opinion that the presence of a sloop in particular waters also has the effect of keeping the dhows in harbour. No definite proof of this can be advanced, but on each occasion of taking up a patrol off Perim, and on the coast of Yemen, south of Mokha, I have noticed that many more dhows have been under sail on the first day than could be seen on the second and succeeding days. (Hi) It is very noticeable that a large proportion of the dhows stopped come from Khaukha, and it is to be inferred that this village is superseding Hodeida as a place of export, just as the latter supplanted Mokha in days gone by. (iv) During my stay at Jibuti, I was able to discuss the situation in the Gulf of Tadjura with the Vice-Consul. He could give me no information about the places named in my No. 2|514|6, dated 1st November, 1929, nor had he heard of the native Akida Trahep, who is said to be the Danakil chiefly interested in the above trade. He was able to confirm that M. Manfried was again in Jibuti, # as he had seen him quite recently, but he stated that he was supposed to have some business interests in Abyssinia.^ He stated that the motor was removed from his dhow, alter his arrest some time ago, and that the dhow was still out of action. ^' s i? r £^ a ^ s empioyment of agents, or the collection of reports from the coast of Tadjura, he pointed out how very difficult it was, partly on the score of interference in the affairs of a friendly Power, and partly owing to the extreme difficulty of getting hold of a trustworthy native. (A) It is rather remarkable that although several dhows have been stopped outward bound for Jibuti, not one bound from Jibuti to the Arabian coast has been stopped during the period of this report. One exceptionally well-found dhow, fitted with a binnacle, and a wheel, bound from Jibuti to Aden was found to belong to the rich Arab, Hamudi, who is. said to be connected with the slave trade. She was carrving no cargo, but was m ballact. ^ &amp; ### * * # ** Copies to :—Secretary of the Admiralty. Senior Officer, Red Sea Sloops, H. M.

Enclosure. Despatch Secret B, from the Acting High Commissioner for Iraq, to Colonial Office, dated the 21st October, 1929. I have the honour to refer to Your Lordship’s telegram No. 313, dated the 16th of October, 1929, in which Your Lordship invites my observations on des patches Nos. 546 and 549, dated the 24th and 26th of September, 1929, respec tively, from the Political Agent at Kuwait. 2. I have already in my telegram No. 350 (No. 90|S. to Bushire), dated the 5th of October, 1929, given an indication of the attitude adopted by His Majesty King Faisal in regard to the Nejd rebellion. His Majesty makes no secret of his sympathy for the rebels, who, he thinks, are certain to succeed in overthrow ing King Ibn Sa’ud’s rule in the near future. King Faisal maintains that in his opinion His Britannic Majesty’s Government are making a profound mis take in attempting to bolster up King Ibn Sa’ud’s tottering throne, not merely because its collapse is inevitable, but because the continued rule of King Ibn Sa’ud over central Arabia based as it is on constant military aggression is contrary to the interest of ’Iraq and Transjordan and so to the interests of His Britannic Majesty’s Government. 3. In these circumstances it is impossible to expect that a man of King Faisal’s character could refrain from taking more than an academic interest in the fortunes of the rebel Akhwan. There is no doubt in my mind that he has been sending agents to the rebels with messages of encouragement and in some cases with 'material assistance in the form of cash—though such assistance is ostensibly provided, no doubt, by the refugees from the rebel tribes now in ’Iraq. I have no doubt moreover that one of the reasons for the visit of the Amir Abdullah to Baghdad was the desire of the two brothers to discuss how the fall of King Ibn Sa’ud might be hastened and how it might be subsequently used to the best advantage. 4. As regards the report that arrangements have been made for a general move southwards of the ’Iraq Shammar with the object of recovering Hail for the Ibn Rashid family, it is a fact that the ’Iraq Shamar are moving southward from the northern Jazirah into the Hillah and Diwamyah Liwas. This south ward move of the Shammar is however not unusual when grazmg is scarce m the northern Jazirah. Similar migrations took place m 1923, 1925 and 192». The presence of the Shammar (more especially of the Shammar Abda who are refugees from Najd) in the southern Liwas has m former years been a source of anxiety to the ’Iraq Government in view of possible disturbances on the Naj frontier, md consequently measures have been taken to keep these southward migrations of the tribe under close control. No sectmn for example, is per mitted to cross the Euphrates into the Shamiyah. I consider it likely that this southward move of the Shammar has been used for propaganda purposes } those who are seeking to encourage the rebels and has been represented as evid- ence of Traq’is intention to assist them. 5 On the other hand if the rebels are successful and the armies of King Ibn Sa’ud are routed a King Faisal expects, it is certain that the Shammar Abda’ wm throw in their lot with the M and .f share they can f ^^ e \“;; ee teltTaf b^en leaclTed ShaSTlqab them. How far a der ~ , Waisnl al I lavish, under the auspices of ihn Ajil of the Shammar Abda and t .mmar in the event of a rebel King Faisal, for Hail to be handed over to the 8^™^ eve^ ' 3avar&amp;?feK «*•* 1 - * -r*- * an agreement of this nature did exist.135 I mav add that I have no evidence that the Amarat (the I ra( l Anaiz^i) 6. 1 may au Vy. fpr , • ch an agreement and I consider that the report are m any way PjP ® originated in the brain of some zealous propagandist. As ^to^the^uwallah^I ^anf less qualified to give an opinion, but I do not attach much weight tp the report of their complicity. 7 Your Lordship will appreciate the difficulty of preventing King Faisal from giving encouragement and support are moral rather than material I have as Your Lordship is aware forwarded to the ’Iraq Government a hst of specific charges made against King Faisal by King Ibn ha ud ; I understand that His Maiestv is preparing a detailed reply, and in the meantime he has undertaken fo act ^ith strict propriety in future, but, so long as His Majesty s sympathies aro known to be wholly with the Akhwan rebels, this will not materially affect the situation. 8. While I do not share King Faisal’s belief in the imminent collapse of King Ibn Sa’nd, I am becoming increasingly impressed with the fact that hia ultimate victorv over the rebels is uncertain. The Acting Political Resident m the Persian Gulf in his telegram No. 1012, dated the 16th of October, 1929, for, warded a report of a rebel victory, which if confirmed would seem to threaten King Ibn Sa’ud’s control of the whole of the province of Hasa. I should add however that reports of this same battle received by way of Basrah represent it as having been a decisive victory for the loyalist to forces. Where the atmos phere is still so clouded with propaganda that one cannot clearly review the pre sent situation, it seems idle to attempt to look into the future.

Three and two machines he said had flovn over his camp and over his camels on successive days. He thought airmen pro bably acted without authority but in any case he would like warning given them, as it excited his people, and was irregular. Hafidh Wahba further informed me that Ibn Sand had received communication regarding visit of King oi 1 1 acj, and obviously welcomed idea, as he has ordered marquees tables and chans to be got readv in Koweit and transported by dhows to Ras A1 Zor as soon as arrangements visit definitely fixed.

These were the first cele- bratmns of the sort that have taken place, and it is stated that the King was at st opposed to them although he subsequently gave'his consent. 2 - ^ e&lt; ^ a the streets were beflagged and a general holiday was proclaimed q aimary 0 , ie . ( ^ a N began with receptions and a salute of one hundred and one guns, the foreign representatives and Consuls and their staffs in uniform bexn received by the Governor at eleven a.m., simultaneously the Emir Feisal was holding a reception of notables in Mecca. l nnQ i 3 \ In lhe afte .™on the Emir Feisal arrived from Mecca for a review of the ffifn 14?° T S fn aUt f ^ the t0 - Wn at Kandara - These consisted of a company of imantry ot the Jedda garrison m their semi-European uniform, who presented Fill’s spe ji, She wife' feaccessii fea at 1 erected an journal ception nn Mime pt leipensi cepts whie ttre takeia ratlier sorry spectacle, compared with a few wild horsemen and a picturesque contingent of about two hundred men on gaily caparisoned camels who followed. Idie artillery was represented by the four saluting guns which were drawn by mules commandeered from the market place for the purpose. The review was preceded by sea at the palace at Kandara to which some three hundred guests had been invited. 4. In the evening an official banquet was held at Kandara at which about a hundred and fifty guests were present including the foreign representatives and a number of representatives of the leading Egyptian newspapers who had been invited by the Hejas Government to attend the celebrations. The banquet was the occasion for a number of complimentary speeches extolling the virtues of the King and the progress made under his reign. There had, I am told, been a sharp dispute between the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Gov ernor of Jedda as to who should deliver the Government’s address. The matter had been referred to the Emir who had decided as a compromise that Sheikh Fuad’s speech should be read by a citizen of Jedda. 5. Sheikh Fuad ’s speech was in the main also a eulogy of the King and his' works. He enumerated the objects which the King has set out to achieve since his accession and commented on the results obtaiifed. I enclose a resume of his speech. 6. For the following day a lunch had been organised fey the Municipality of Mecca at Wadi Falun, about fifteen miles from Mecca where tents had been erected among palm groves. The foreign representatives and the Egyptian journalists were again invited. Lunch was served to two hundred and fifty guests at a long table in one tent. The arrangements for lunch were excellent, although the superabundance of food was calculated to daunt all but the hardiest treacherous, and the guests in spite of appetites sharpened by a two hours drive across country, managed to make very little impression on it. The time was occupied both before and after lunch by speeches and poems delivered in a re ception marquee by selected orators who vied with one another in showering fulsome praise on the King and his representative, the Amir. 7. The celebrations were organised I am told on an unprecedented scale for Arabia and were obviously intended to impress both the foreigners and the Arabs. No expense was spared and the organisation was on the whole good. 8. The invitation extended to the Egyptian journalists was a clever more on Sheikh Fuad’s part. They were treated with assiduous courtesy and were loud in their praises. 9 The celebrations marked I think a definite departure from the rigid pre cepts which the Akhwan had succeeded temporarily in imposing. Photographs were taken freely ; an official photographer had in fact come from Egypt and photographed the Amir on every possible occasion. Smoking was indulged m openly or with only a pretence at concealment. In fact there seemed to be a general relaxation of regulations and a desire to get away from the irksome restrictions which, in Jedda at any rate, have never been popular. 10.

The improvement of public health and education and the development of agriculture so that the Bedouins may abandon nomadic Me and settle down as productive and law-abiding citizens. Turning to the subject of foreign relations the Acting Minister for Foreign. Affairs makes the following remarks ■With regard to foreign relations, the prominence given to His Majesty’s Kingdom in international life and its desire to become a useful member of the family of nations working for the general good are proved by the fact that friendly relations have been established with most governments and political treaties and agreements have been concluded with them. The treaties which have been concluded and thosS which are now the subject of negotiations bear witness to His Majesty’s desire for peace in the Holy Land. There is no doubt that no member in the society of nations can be useful unless it co-operates with other members in the discharge of its duty for the good of all. This is the case with a Government that desires to become a useful member in international life. It cannot achieve this end if it remains isolated and the establishment of relations must inevitably lead to a community of in terests. In following such a course difficulties may arise but they are easily overcome. If these matters are taken into consideration, it will be readily seen that the existence of outstanding problems among nations is inevitable in inter national affairs. It must be borne in mind, however, that with goodwill, sincerity and a spirit of fair play, all difficulties may be overcome and all problems mav he solved. Such a spirit dictates the policy of His Majesty’s Government and for this reason all onr problems are by no means intricate or impossible to solve. In this connection, I cannot but refer to the new step taken by this country in its foreign relations by the recent elevation of the status of foreign representa tion in the country. The countries with which the Government had diplomatic relations were represented by Agencies and Committees but their status was raised a short time ago. There are now four Legations at Jedda and I trust the number will be increased. Sheikh Fuad Hamza then asserted that the vast territories of the Kingdom of the Hejas and its Dependencies, enjoy a security which is not equalled in any other country. He goes on to summarise the measures taken to ensure the com fort of pilgrims, such as the development of motor transport, the widening of roads, the improvement of the water supply and medical attention. Finally he mentions that great strides have been made in the development of education and agriculture, adding, with regard to the latter, that the question of scientific irri gation is under consideration and that it is hoped in the near future to make great progress in this direction too. In conclusion Fuad Hamza thanks the Organizing Committee for its labours and the Foreign Representatives and journalists for their attendance, (170) (Received on 15th February 1930, with Political Secretary's letter No. 5, Met 30th January 1930.)

It seems to me that no question of capitulation arises (corrupt group). Hitherto H. M. Government have adopted a most friendly attitude towards Ibn Saud and have assisted him in a large number of ways. The original intention was to deny rebels access to Iraq and Koweit and simply to push them back to Ibn Saud. This has proved impossible and they are now our prisoners. H. M.’s Gov ernment are still (corrupt group) perfectly prepared to return them to their friend Ibn Saud, but Arab sentiment, etc., must be taken into account and they naturally desire to receive an assurance that these tribes shall not be permitted in the future to harry the border and that Ibn Saud will arrange to settle out standing claims. To' speak of capitulation f ignores our friendly relations with Ibn Saud which he himself also emphasised very strongly. An entire cessation of raiding among Arab tribes cannot permanently be achieved by any arrange ment but if he is met in a friendly spirit I think Ibn Saud will do his best and he is stronger now than before.

Had meeting in Iraq- Nejd neutral territory been suggested when he was in the vicinity he would gladly have accepted but now unless King Faisal agrees to place proposed by Ibn Saud latter regrets that meeting will have to be postponed to future occa sion.

We exchanged ordinary oriental courtesies in the course of which he asked after the King’s health, making special reference to his illness of a year ago. He expressed pleasure on hearing how well 1 had found His Majesty when I kissed hands. Ele emphasised his desire for good relations with Great Britain, to which I replied that I had had evidence of a reciprocal sentiment of the same kind in all circles at home when I was preparing to come to Jedda. After this exchange of compliments I retired, my staff and I making a point of walking back wards and bowing in accordance with European etioiiette, a touch which, I think, was duly noted. King Ibn Sand again remained alone, while his officers escorted me to the antechamber. 4. King Ibn Sand indulged rather less than I had expected in high- flown phrases, but his reception was in every way cordial. He was per haps a little fatigued. At any rate his voice was somewhat hoarse, owing, it is said, to the number and length of the theological discourses which he has recently had occasion to pronounce at Mecca. His bearing was stately and impressive in his loose robe, one of the usual Arabian type, but of fine mate rial and handsomely embroidered. His feet were bare. The audience chamber was a room of moderate size, well-carpeted, but otherwise fur nished in a debased French style. The most conspicuous object was a green panel high in the wall behind the King, embroidered with the Moslem profession of faith and a hefty sword underneath. 5. After the audience Shaikh Fuad Hamza asked whether I had any objection to a photograph being taken. One my acquiescing an Egyptian photographer from Cairo, who works for the u Graphic ” and other papers, took several pictures. In the meantime the King himself had, apparently at the suggestion of some of his officers, intimated his willing ness to be photographed also, and a final photograph was taken, in which e 9 cc ^b ie d the centre of the group with myself on his right.

His destina tion was Taif, where, it appears, the Heir Apparent, Emir Sand, is to be operated on for eye trouble by an Egyptian surgeon. This has led to the cancellation of a visit by the Emir Sand to Jedda, which was planned for the 19th May, and during which I was to meet the prince at another party of Fuad Hamza s. ^ I uad Hamza, himself, is also returning to Mecca to-day._ In these circumstances, I cannot hope to do any personal busi ness with eithei him or the King before the 25th May, hut I have reason to expect that tlie} will both be in Jedda again in the course of the week beginning on that day. 9.

As will he seen the letter of the King (a) appears reasonable enough on the surface, though there is little doubt in both the Shaikh’s and my38 mind that the real object of Ibrahim bin Arfaj’s presence is the tighten- ing of the blockade. „ „ ,, , a j^ino- has incited the Shaikh of Kuwait to address any com- nlaints against Nejdis who may misbehave, to his representative, the latter has taken him at his word and reported to Ibrahmi al-Arfaj a quite ) recent occurrence which took place during my absence at Baghdad recently when some Awazim again entered Kuwait Territory near Subailnyeh and carried oft 13 camels from woodcutters on the plea and they recognised them as their own. The camels in question having ceitainly once belonged to the Awazim, but had been purchased “ for dioney ” by the said wood cutters. N 0 t e . In passing it should be noted that the above complaint has nothing to do with the 37 camels taken by Mohamed ibn Sultan’s people in March last and which the Shaikh wrote to the King about, vide para graph 4 of my confidential despatch No. 202, dated 8tli April last. 5. The Shaikh in his letter to Ibrahim al-Arfaj also pointed out, with reference to his hint about certain Nejd camels being still in Kuwait, that he had written to the King a long time back offering to return the 53 camels mentioned in paragraph 12 of my despatch No. 194 of 26th March if payment in full was made, but had received no reply and that in the meanwhile he was not prepared to discuss the question. 6. I also am informing Ibrahim bin Arfaj privately regretting that further discussions cannot be allowed in the matter of the 53 camels with out reference to His Majesty’s Government. The Shaikh has approved my reply. 7. I hope therefore that nothing further will be heard on his subject, but I am watching events nevertheless. Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (51).

Enclosure to Serial No. (52). Letter from the Political Agent, Kuwait, to the Hon’ble the Poli tical Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, No. 254, dated the 11th June 1930. In continuation of my despatch No. 233, dated 16th May, I have the honour to forward the following items of news which may be of interest 1. The rumour is still current that H. M, King Bin Saud intends to remain in the Hijaz for good, and that he intends appointing Saud his son his viceroy for Nejd and Hassa. Best informed opinion in Kuwait puts no credence in the rumour, and prefers to put if down to the fact that the King has given out that he will summer in Taif. At the same time it is considered possible that he will permanently appoint the Amir Saud to the governorship of Nejd, himself retaining the general control. 2. At the end of May, Ibrahim bin Arfaj proceeded to the ’Iraq neutral area to settle certain water disputes which had arisen between Shammar elements at “ Bir Ansab ”, and at Julaida between some Shammar under ibn Hudaid and the Dhalir under ibn Suwait. Ibn Arfaj is reliably reported to have decided both cases satisfactorily and in the second of the two cases to have given his decision in favour of the Dhafir. 3. During ibn Arfaj’s absence in the neutral area (2 above) three small caravans managed to get into Kuwait as below :— (a) On 5th June a caravan of 60 camels, consisting of Braih tribesmen from Hafar al-Batin. The story is not considered unlikelv42 ( 54 ) l (Received on Telegram from )M THE High Commissioner for Egypt, to the Foreign Office, No. 309, dated the 8th July 1930, My telegram No. 302. Sheikh Hafiz has arrived Cairo but cannot leave Egypt before July 21st at earliest, (55) (Received on 17th August 1930, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 31, A 91 C'+ Till II IQRn ^ Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 120, DATED THE 28TH MAY 1930. In tlie note on various matters of protocol enclosed in my despatch No. 114 of the 18th instant [Serial No. (50)], I referred to the question of formal visits bv foreign representatives to King Ibn Sand’s Heir Apparent as one which had not been raised in my conversations with the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and which need not arise at present. I have the honour to state that it has in fact arisen much sooner than I anticipated. 2. Late in the evening of the 25th May, I received a telephone message from the assistant to the Governor of Jedda to the effect that the Emir Sand was arriving early next morning, and would receive me the next morning at 10-10 a.m. On enquiry, I found that the intention of the Prince was to re ceive the foreign representatives officially, and that uniform would be appropriate. He received us in succession, beginning with the Soviet Minister, at the Green Palace, which. Sheikh Fuad Hamza tells me, is now definitely the property of the King. I took with me the same party, minus the Legation interpreter, as when I presented credentials. The Prince, who was attended by Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, placed me on a sofa beside him. The reception was on the same lines as the less formal part of the pro ceedings when the King himself received me. 3. The Governor of Jedda had issued invitations for a dinner, given also at the Palace, but apparently by the local authorities, in honour of “ le Heir Apparent. It was a hot evening, and it was happily arranged that the European guests might wear ordinary evening dress, in which vogue or attire a black dinner jacket, though all do not own to it, is still re high-water mark in Jedda. Having surmounted the perils of a stair-a, revolving fan supplemented the simple slave-driven variety, the relief was general when we again adjourned to the roof, where, after half an hour of further conversation and light refreshment, we took leave. 5. I was distinctly impressed by the personality of the Prince. Tall and slender, he resembles his father cast in a finer, if less imposing, mould. His features are well marked and he conceals his eye trouble behind glasses, and he has a most engaging smile. In his conversation he showed great vivacity. He confined it almost entirely to the Soviet Minister and myself. As M. Turakouloff speaks both Turkish and stumbling Arabic, he was able to converse direct, and was good enough to act to some extent as interpreter between the Emir and me. At the outset of the conversa tion before dinner the Emir plunged into a glorification of Islam, which my Russian colleague echoed with contributions of his own. After dinner His Highness reverted to the subject, and said how mistaken it was to suppose that Islam was incompatible with civilisation. Eager to be polite without any approach to the profession of an alien faith, I said that, indeed, there should be no conflict. I related how I myself, going to church in Hampstead one Sunday morning in a tramcar, otherwise empty except for the driver and the conductor, had heard one of them say to the other : “ What do we want with . . . religions now we’re civilised ?” and how much more civilised I had felt myself to be than the speaker. It gave me some satisfaction to have this simple tale translated by the represen tative of Soviet Russia, although I had to omit the epithet preceding “ re ligions. ’ ’ 6. On the 27th May the Prince sent two persons, the Assistant Governor and the officer commanding the garrison, to return the visit which I had paid him. 7. The Emir was expected to say here a few days, but he changed all his plans and returned to Mecca on the evening of the 27th May. I hear from a confidential source that his recall was due to the arrival of news of some trouble in Nejd. I cannot vouch for tills information, but as it was the Prince’s first visit to Jedda since 1926 there must have been some important reason for his sudden departure. 8. As my main object in writing this despatch is to provide a full record for future reference of ceremonial now observed here, I may men tion that, in addition to calling officially on the other foreign representa tives after I had presented my credentials, I also called on the Governor of Jedda, as being the chief local authority in what is becoming the diplo matic capital.

Letter from the Foreign Minister to the Iraq Government, to the High Commissioner for Iraq, Ho. 1789, dated the 51 11th June 1930. 1 We are informed by one ’Asi ibn Hasan of the Dahamsha tribe that 3 months ago while he was encamped at the place called Shahab al-Sahn, within ’Iraq territory, he was raided by Mutliq ibn Zamil accompanied by twenty camelmen who seized his sheep consisting of 100 heads and re turned with them into Nejd territory. We have learnt that Mutliq and his men are “ Zakat ” collectors under ’Abdulaziz ibn Musa’id. We request that you will communicate with the Hejd Government and ask them to restore the pillaged sheep and do the necessary to prevent the recurrence of such acts of aggression which are likely to have a prejudi cial effect on the good relations existing between the two neighbouring Kingdoms. We should be glad to be acquainted with the result in due course. Lc562EDSimilar letters have been sent to the Under Secretaries of State, Foreign Office and Colonial Office.

I had thought that this traffic was almost extinct. Rather to my surprise he has advocated the manning of dhows with native crews, although his remarks on this subject are somewhat contra dictory. In discussing the question with him, I took the line that such craft would be of little value, but I was unable to get him to alter his opinion. i i regards the institution of an Intelligence Service in the Hedjaz, he held out little hope, and pointed out how difficult the control of such a service would be for the British Legation. I had an opportunity of discussing the question also with the Poli tical Authorities at Aden, and gathered the impression that steady pro gress is being made to meet our requests for more adequate information iro:n Arabia, concerning the doings of the slave dealers. Buring a recent visit of Sir Sidney Barton, the question of an Intel ligence Service in French Somaliland w T as discussed, and I understand that the Foreign Office is being approached concerning the supply of funds to allow of its institution.Steps have already been taken to collect information m the Aden Pro- ^Momation to for “rTceived confirms my previous report that the use i™ge dhows has been given up, and that the slaves are carried across the Straits in small numbers m small last dhows or fishmg zam uqs. y ie monopoly of the trade has been assumed by Saif el Islam Ahmed, the eldest son of the Imam Yahya who has first choice of all the slaves imported, after which they pass through the hands of the Governor of Medi, Qadlii Abdullah al Aiabic.

Up to the present, an interim report only, has been^ received from Konjuni, the Consular Agent at Hodieda, but he is to visit Aden very shortly, when more information will be obtained. It is reported that the Arab Hamudi, mentioned in my previous re ports as paying for information concerning the movements of sloops, died at Djibouti last January. I shall try to obtain confirmation of this, during my present visit. Mr. Low the acting Vice-Consul had heard no reports of slave run ning from the Gulf of Tad jura at all recently, but seemed to think that a certain number left from the neighbourhood of Asab.

It was in order to render such assistance that two visits were paid to Darin Island this year on January 24 and April 13. On both occasions the Air Force was provided with certain spare parts and with technical help in connection with its wireless installation and the visits were limited in duration to the time necessary for the purpose in view. The sgcond visit, which gave rise to the protest of His Highness the Emir, was paid by an air boat returning from India and was undertaken at great inconvenienee. I am further informed that the air boat did not fly over the coast during its journey although in alighting or taking off it may have been over the Island, owing to the state of the wind, for a very brief 4. My Government are confident that the above explanation will dissk pate any alarm which may have been caused by misrepresentations of the kind mentioned by the Emir in his note of May 4 [Enclosure to Serial No. (25)]. They cannot but regret the vigour of the language used by His Highness in regard to an incident, which fuller enquiry would have shown in its true proportions. At the same time they recognize that there was a technical omission in not obtaining the assent of His Majesty the King before the visits of January 24 and April 13 were made and they have taken steps to ensure that this assent will be asked for on future occasions, 5. As I have had occasion to refer to the wireless installation of the Air Force, I take this opportunity of mentioning a matter arising out of the communication which Your Excellency made to me by telephone on May 20. _ You expressed a wish that British wireless stations should not communicate with the Air Force at Darin except in circumstances of urgency. n tins connection my Government wish me to draw attention f °r V vireless installation like that at Darin to exchange trom time to time test messages with other wireless stations, which in this ensure thnftbifk i''' ' stat J ons 111 Ira q.

I have little doubt the visit was by direction of His Majesty. It would appear Sheikh Shaibby is an influential personage, being the Hereditary Keeper of the Golden Key of the Kaba at Mecca. This appointment, I am creditably informed, has been uninterruptedly in the keeping of the family of Sheikh Shaibby for a period of upwards of 2,000 years. He must therefore be one of the original Koreish Tribe, i.e., the original founders of the City of Mecca. The venerable old man, for he must he over 70 years of age, was most affable and appeared pleased with his re ception. Opportunity was taken to present all the Somali ratings borne in complement and this appeared to make a great impression on him. He went to considerable trouble in making them a lengthy and patriotic speech,, in which he impressed on them that they must serve their country ^Britain) loyally, for, as he said, “ England was always kind and just to all Mohammedans ”. It was apparent that the Seedies treated him with ie gi eatest veneration, all kissing his hand and showing the greatest respect. &amp; b t / A edby see irom sucn small incidents the serious effects lesu ? should we, .by chance, as a nation, at any time anta- anti-RrifSi 6111 °f )nilon in Arabia, resulting in Mecca becoming a centre of it is nt r&gt;rp«Am 0 ^f^ an ^ a Indian and African pilgrims.

With reference to my telegram Nos. 94 and 95 of June 30, I have the honour to state that Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, the Heiaz-Neid Minister Designate m London left for his post to-day, taking the Khedivial S. S. 1 . , as ,, ar as ouez. I gave a small dinner party in his honour last evening, m the course of which he said that he expected to stay about a xortnight in Egypt and would go on to London via Marseilles. . T 116 record of Sheikh Hafiz Wahba is so well known to you that it is unnecessary for me to say anything of his antecedents. I have not seen enough of him to have formed any personal estimate of his present out- iook I give with reserve the following impressions derived from reports winch have readied me :— (a) He would be glad to see much closer relations betwen Great Britain and this country on terms favourable to the latter. (b) He is hostile to the “ Syrian Party ”, the protagonists in which are Sheikhs Euad Hamza and Yussef Yassin, and is specially hostile towards the latter. (c) His own position vis-a-vis of the King is probably that the latter values his opinions but frequently finds them unpalatable. He himself finds the King difficult. He told one of tmy informants nevertheless that a special code had been arranged which would enable him to communicate with Ibn Sand independently of the Syrians. (d) He does not think that the King is disposed to break with the Syrians at present, perhaps for reasons connected with ultimate aspirations in regard to Syria. It is suggested even that Ibn Saud hopes one day to secure the throne of that country for one of his sons. 3. I may mention in this connection that reports have been rife for some time to the effect that the King intends to make the Emir Eeisal Minister of Foreign Affairs, retaining the services of Fuad Hamza as a subordinate. 4. Hafiz Wahba told the informant already mentioned that the Hejaz Government intended to establish Consulates at Bombay and Singapore and that there was a dispute as to whether they should be under him as Minister in London or directly imder the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here. 5. I am not circulating this despatch to any other post.

God has been gracious towards the Moslems by revealing to them the Islamic faith and enabling them to adopt it, whereby they have tasted happy life which combines the good of this world and that of the next. The sinful elements have brought about trouble and dissention among the Moslem and God has dealt them his punishment. May God be thanked for He alone has given victory to his hosts and defeated the confederates, I see that there is spreading about in the desert an evil (rumour ?) to the effect that we had fought “ those ” only because of their tenacious hold to their religion. May God forbid that we should have fought them on that account. Tenacity in religions belief accompanied by discretion is most strongly admired by us. We have fought them only on account of contra vention of religion and the Sharia’. There are also some who imagine that the Sharia’ and the religion have been upheld only thanks to five bedouins of Midair and Ataiba. This can be imagined only by false ones and ene- mies of the faith and of Moslems. God be praised for the “ leadership or Moslems has at all times exerted itself only for the support of reli gion, the upholding of the Sharia’, and the suppression of those who act to the contrary seeking assistance from God.

No dhows were seen, but some fishing sambuqs were inspected. There were a lew fishermen using the island as a base. I sailed at 10 p.m., with the ship darkened, and lowered the motor boat and oije whaler off Moshij, on the 10 fathom line, at 1 a.m., standing off during the night, and returning to pick up the boats at early dawn. No sailing boats were seen to approach the coast during the night, and I do not think I was seen from the shore. I anchored for the day off Great Hanish Island, and sailed for Dubab at 6 p.m. On arrival off Dubab, just inside the 10 fathom line, I anchored for half an hour, as there was a nasty swell and I was doubtful whether to send the boats away. It was well I did so, for the wind increased about 2 o’clock, and would have made the conditions for the boats very dangerous. Boat work being out of the question, I patrolled at slow speed to the South, in the hope of intercepting any sambuqs coming from Ras Siyan. The wind would have been favourable for them, but perhaps rather too high. Perim Island was passed just before daylight, and I anchored for the day off Ras al Ara, in the Gulf of Aden, preparatory to repeating the operation off Dubab, should the weather be favourable. The bad weather on the night of the 29th was most disappointing, as conditions for intercepting a slave runner were very good. It was the season of no moon, the presence of a sloop was probably unknown so far South, and Dubab is reputed to be one of the main landiiy places on the Arabian coast. Operations of this nature are only possible during good weather, owing to the necessity for using small boats, and it is essential that the presence of the slll P beiorehand should not be suspected, as it is reported that the s ave dealers have an excellent system of intelligence and the fact of a sloop being m the neighbourhood gets to their ears very quickly.

The Resident Aden, is able to maintain some agents in that country, ^ P 11I1C1 P^1 duty is the collection of intelligence, insofar as it .affects the Aden Protectorate. Naturally, this is best obtained inland, whereas information concerning the slave trade is chiefly to be obtained on the coast. Tims, until special funds are forthcoming, too much cannot be hoped for from this direction. • x* Whilst at anchor off Yactul, I was able to obtain some local information from some Arabs, who appeared to be truthful. Three men were interviewed, and although one would say nothing, the first, a lad, answered freely, and the third who was the eldest, appeared glad to give information. That such should be the case is quite natural, as the slave dealers are a class apart, and the poorer Arabs of the coastal regions are Quite in different as to the existence of the traffic or otherwise. My informants stated that they knew of slaves having been brought across within the last month or so, and said that they were being shipped now from Pas Siyan, and usually made the Arabian coast off Dubab. Thence they proceeded by sea to (tizen, which is not the trading centre, and it was stated quite confidently that they pass through Kamaran Passage, using the sea route to prevent the taxation imposed by Saif el Islam Ahmed, previously referred to. Moshij was also referred to as a landfall on the Arabian Coast, where the small boats from Africa usually arrive about two hours before sunrise. The trade is said to be in the hands of the Danakils, and payment is made in rifles. Girls and boys form the cargoes, being brought across in fast Zambuqs sometimes twenty at a time. As much as 400 dollars was said to be a recent price paid for a girl in the interior of Arabia. This information bears out previous intelligence very closely, and I am inclined to trust it. It might be, that the promise of a reward for information leading to a capture might bring really valuable news, and this forms the subject of a separate submission, my No. 880, dated 19th June, 1930, addressed to the Senior Officer, Red Sea Sloops. * * ***** Copies to —The Secretary to the Admiralty. and The Senior Officer, Red Sea Sloops, H.

From time to time there were technical troubles at this station and while there was no obligation on. the part of His Majesty Government in connection with it, it was felt that there was a moral obligation to see that it was kept in proper working order. Accordingly, on no less than three occasions expert mechanics were specially sent by air to examine it, and on each occasion sqares were supplied without any question of charges being raised. . visit to Darin Island on the 13fh April, 1930, was in connection with this W|T station. The Flying Boat was on its way back from India and it was ■ordered to pul into Darin Island to deliver spares and adjust the set. This visit was undertaken at great inconvenience. As the visit was solely for the benefit, of the Hijaz Government it was never anticipated any objection would be raised. On the contrary, it was hoped the Hijaz Government would appreciate the efforts made to help them. 4. It is desired to point out that on other occasions help has also been rendered to the Hijaz Air Force in a different manner. . When Hijaz aircraft arrived at the camp of the King of the Hijaz and Najd in the Southern Desert in February last, they had not sufficient petrol to take them back to Darin. They would have remained stranded at the comr) for some. considerable time until supplies could have been sent out to them under Hijaz arrangements over difficult country were it not for the assistance rendered by the Royal Air Force. Aircraft were specially detailed to convey petrol to them by air and all that was asked was that the Hijaz Government should pay for the petrol supplied. The services of Royal Air Force aircraft were willingly provided without charge. 6. On another occasion. Hijaz aircraft were stranded at Kuwait for want of oil. Again the Royal Air Force supplied their needs without any question of recompense. ( Rossiblv when Kiny Thu Sa’ud is put in possession of all these facts, he will be grateful instead of indignant.

I have the honour to enclose a translation of an article published in the Lm el Qtira of May 23 regarding an alleged request addressed by French North African Moslems to the French Government to build hostels in Mecca and Medina for the accommodation of their pilgrims. 2. The article is chiefly interesting in that it mentions, incidentally, that Hejaz-Nejd nationals alone may own property in the Hejaz. Mr. Bond had occasion to address an enquiry on this subject to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Government of Iraq to which no official reply has yet beeil received^ 3. A further point made by the author is that charities and Waqf foun dations are not allowed in the Hejaz unless these conform to the principles of Sharia Law and are administered under the supervision of the Hejaz Govern ment. 4.

With regal'd to charities and Auqaf in the Ilojaz, they .are not allowed in the Hejaz unless they are in conformity with the principles laid down by Sharia Law in this matter, and unless they are under the supervision of the Hejaz Government according to the regulations made concerning them.

The Air Council agree that as the delivery of the spare parts neeesi saiilj in\ohed entry into Nejo.i territorial waters it cannot well be ar°'ued that any breach which was committed was purely accidental.

(38) (Received on 20th July 1930, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 27, dated 3rd July 1930.) Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 115, dated the 18th May .1930, With reference to Mr. Bond’s despatch No. 102 of the 2nd instant report ing the arrival of a Polish mission under Count Edward Raczynsky, I have the honour to report that the members of this mission were received by the King on the 3rd instant. 2. In a somewhat fulsome speech delivered by him on this occasion, which has been published in the “ Um el Qura ”, Count Raczynsky dwelt upon the reciprocal advantages to be derived from commercial intercourse between the tv T o nations. He also made some remarks about the King’s prowess in the defence of religion which may possibly be regarded by his compatriots as being somewhat inapposite. The following is the passage to which I refer:— “ Your Majesty’s reputation as the most pious King and the greatest defender of Religion increases and spreads daily among Your Moslem brethren in Poland, who have lived in the far North for many centuries. These Moslems have been treated by the Polish nation as brothers because of their excellent reputation and because of their heroism and bravery in the defence of their homeland along with their Polish brothers when enemies attacked their country. Their representative and their Religious Head, the Grand Mufti Yakub Sinkfwiteh, has come here me to-day in order to establish firm and friendly relations with the source of their Religion, and to congra tulate Your Mojesty on Your accession to the throne of the Holy Lands and on Your defence of them.” 3. The replv read on behalf of the King echoed in rather more moderate language the Sentiments of the Polish Envoy. His Majesty compared the Arab and Polish nations in the matter of courage, referred with pleasure to what had been said about the Moslems in Poland and expressed confidence that the mission would have the best effect on economic relations between the tw T o countries. 4. The report in the 3 4 * Fm el Qura ’ ’ states that after the exchange of speeches the Envoy informed Ibn Sand of his recognition by Poland as King of the Hejas, Nejd and its Dependencies, for wffiich the King expressed thanks. I am not yet aware of the nature of any agreement which may have been con cluded. Lc423FD-- r ~' (39) (Received on 20th July 1930, with Political Secretary’s letter No. » dat i K 3rd July 1930.) Letter from II. M/s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 123, dawt&gt; the 30th May 1930. I have the honour to state that the Mecca weekly paper Um el Qura i s at present publishing a series of articles on the events in Nejd, which culminated in the repression of the rebellion of Feisal ed Dawish, etc. These articles are attributed to Sheikh Yussef Yasin, who acts as Secretary to Ibn Sand and is closely connected with the paper in question. The articles purport to be of a purely historical character and the writer expressly disclaims any desire to inflame feeling or revive controversy over matters that have been the object of political settlement. The two articles which have already appeared contain little or nothing of such interest as to make it necessary to forward translations. They are such as might be expected from a writer with a one-sided outlook, anxious at once to justify and to glorify the action of Ibn Saud. As, however, they naturally abound in references to His Majesty’s Government and to the attitude observed in Iraq and Eoweit, I think it well to draw attention to the fact that they are being published. The _ second article, which appeared in the Um el Qura of May 23, makes play with the assurances given by the British authorities when Ibn Saud decided to reduce the rebels by force and rather suggests that there was hedging over the fulfilment of those assurances, but on the whole the references to this subject are guarded. 3.

Although the activities of Ibn Sand’s agents on this frontier have been reported from time to time it may not be amiss to summarise briefly the events that have occurred since the Mutair and Ajman crossed the border in February last. These two tribes were conveyed into Nejd territory by the Royal Air Force and Ibn Sand himself expressed his appreciation of the manner in which this had been done. There was however a possibility that a few camels might have been handed over to the Araibdar or that a iew refugees might still remain and when King Ibn Sand desired to send an emis sary to investigate the matter it was decided, in order that he might have no possible ground for complaint, to allow him to carry out the search in conjunc tion with a representative of the Shaikh. y. iiie nrsi emissary sent by Ihn Sand was Barjas al Othman. n earned out a most comprehensive search and discovered a few refugees sti ilh^Hwait territory mostly women and children, whose men folk had bee t a . c6 Uain number of Nejd camels.

This has not however been the case and he has now sent Ibrahim ibn Arfaj to maintain the pressure. The latter has not camped nearer the border than Hafar el Batin, but has employed armed patrols all along the border to prevent caravans proceeding to Kuwait and divert them to Zobeir, Further, he has visited Kuwait himself secretly, and Colonel Dickson has definite proof that he stayed two nights with Nafisi, Ibn Baud’s agent there. Each fresh commander appointed to the Kuwait border produces fresh lists of so called Nejd.camels and fresh demands upon the 'Shaikh of Kuwait.. As Colonel Dickson points out, matters have now reached a climax, and had it not been for his constant efforts, there is little doubt but that Ibn Baud’s armed forces would by now have been over-running Kuwait territory and helping themselves to Kuwait camels, while Ibn Baud on his part has made no attempt to compensate Kuwait for the heavy losses inflicted on them by Nejd tribes or to pay the compensation which he promised. I enclose for the information of His Majesty’s Government a copy of a reply that I have sent to Colonel Dickson and trust they will approve of the instructions therein given. 5. I would also venture strongly to urge that representations should be made to Ibn Baud regarding the conduct of his officials on the Kuwait border. The Nejd Government desires to be treated nowadays as a civilized gov ernment in the comity of nations. If this is so they should adopt in their deal ings with their neighbours at least some of the practices current among civi lized nations. As will be seen from the above, Ibn Baud’s officials have camped with armed forces actually on the Kuwait border, thereby creating consterna tion among Kuwait subjects ; they have crossed the border and looted Kuwait tribes ; they maintain a perpetual blockade of all Kuwait territory and no one from Nejd is allowed to visit Kuwait; and finally Ibn Baud’s own authorised representative instead of visiting Kuwait openly and calling on the Shaikh and the Political Agent, visits it secretly by night, presumably in order to spy out the land. Further, his aeroplanes visit Kuwait territory without per mission while the visit paid by the aeroplanes of the Royal Air Force to DARIN in the interests of the Hedjaz Air Force immediately evokes the most vigorous protests. Ibn Baud’s attitude therefore towards Kuwait can only be described as deliberately hostile, and he persistently treats Kuwait as though it were a rebellious province of Nejd. While prevented from invad ing it by His Majesty’s Government he is attempting to reduce it to submis sion to his will by blockade. 6. Ibn Baud in his letter to the Shaikh of Kuwait has suggested that each Kuwait subject who has bought a Nejd camel should be sent with a letter from the Shaikh into Nejd territory with his witnesses to prove that he has bought the camel. This proposal is 'firstly opposed to current practice and tribal custom and secondly would involve great trouble to Kuwait subjects. They would have to proceed with their witnesses perhaps a hundred or two hundred miles into Nejd territory where the case would be heard by Nejd officials whose impartialitv in this matter may well be doubted. When similar cases arise between Kuwait and ’Iraq if a Kuwait subject professes to have found his camels in the possession of an Iraqi tribesman he is sent, by the Political Agent to ’Iraq where the matter is investigated by he Officer-in-Charge of the Southern Desert and the claimant is compelled to abide by his decision. I he Shaikh of Kuwait is naturally unwilling to agree to Ibn Baud’s proposal but contends that Nejd claimants should be sent to Kuwait with their witnesses where the case would be investigated by the Shaikh and Kuwait claimants should he sent to Nejd. If King Ibn Baud contends that the impartiality ot the Kuwait officials is also not above suspicion in a matter ot this nature, Colonel Dickson informs me that he thinks the Shaikh would readily agree m the Political Aaent supervising the proceedings. In any case this, I am informed, is the'general practice and there seems to be no reason why it should be departed from in the present instance. The Shaikh of Kuwai ias ^ere fore written to Ibn Baud declining to agree to his proposal and putting forward the counter-suggestion outlined above.

In continuation of my confidential despatch No. 243, dated the 26th May last, I have the honour to forward for your information translations of the follow ing letters :— ( a ) From Ibrahim bin Arfaj to the Political Agent, Kuwait No. dated nil, 1349 (received on 10th June 1930) with enclosure. (b) From the Political Agent, Kuwait, to Ibrahim bin Arfaj, No. 351, dated 12th June 1930. (c) From the Political Agent, Kuwait, to H. E. the Shaikh of Kuwait, No. 255 (confidential), dated 12th June 1930. (d) From H. E. the Shaikh of Kuwait, to the Political Agent, No. nil, dated 14th June, 1930. (e) Two camel lists sent by H. E. the Shaikh to the Political Agent on 15th June 1930. A “ Mulhaq ” or supplement to a letter received on 15th June 1930 by H. E. the Shaikh of Kuwait from H. M. the King of Hijaz and Najd under his letter No. 2070, dated 21st Dhil, Hujjah 1348 (20th May 1930). 2. From the above correspondence it will be seen that Ibn Arfaj (presum ably acting under the orders of Bin Sand) has followed up the activities of Barjas ibn Othman and Mohomed ibn Sultan and has come to the charge with a fresh list, this time of 321 camels, which he says are with certain Kuwait subjects (names given), and which he demands on behalf of his master. 3. Ibn Arfaj in his letter (a) makes two wrong statements. Firstly. It is incorrect that I told Yusuf bin Abdullah al-Nafisi to inform ibn Arfaj that he was “ to submit a list of losses (of camels) which were to be recovered What I did say was that ihn Arfaj should do nothing' foolish and attempt to take the law into his own hands and that if he had any complaints to prefer against the Shaikh of Kuwait, he should inform me, sending a copy to the Shaikh. Secondly. —In the third paragraph of his letter he uses the words “ and this al-Nafisi explained to you He did nothing of the sort, and the state ment is a pure invention. I think, to enable yon to understand The above explanations are necessary, ibn Arfaj’s methods. 4. Enclosures (b), (c), (d) are self-explanatory, but (a) requires a little elucidation. On receipt of ibn Arfaj’s letter, I asked H. E. the Shaikh to let me know whether any of the names of persons who were in possession of the 53 camels mentioned in Ibn Sultan’s list, had again been mentioned by ihn Artaj. The Shaikh replied that 24 men’s names mentioned by ibn Sultan had been entered in ibn Arfaj’s list but that whereas the former had only found 36 camels with them the latter now claimed, and without examination or search, that there were 68. See List I and II. 5. Enclosure (/) forms part of a courteous letter on general subjects re cently received (20th May 1930) by H. E. the Shaikh from H. M.

A letter was already sent by us to you with our man Abdur Rahman in which we informed you of what was necessary at the time. Further I have received a letter from Yusjuf bin Abdullah an-Nafisi inform ing me that Your Excellency told him to instruct lis that if we had any complaint to make we should write a letter to you, including a list of the losses which are to be recovered* and a similar letter to Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir, seeing that in onr previous letters, we did Hot explain our demands clearly to you, but had only asked your assistance, and you had replied that you have written to my master H. M. the King, if we were thinking of the question of the 53 camels which were noted down by Ibn Sultan. I accordingly beg to inform you that it is not about the question of the 53 camels that I write, and which you said that Ibn Sultan had noted down, and this an-Nafisi explained to you.f Our list is made up according to accounts which we hold. If you will restore the camels (as per the enclosed copy) we shall be grate ful to you. We shall also be grateful to you, if you will assist us to recover the 53 camels (Ibn Sultan’s demand), if they have not yet been demanded by my master H. M. the King. This will give us great honour.

SHAIKH SlR AjTMAD AL-JaBIR AS-SUBAH, K.C I.E, C.S.I,, Ruler of Kuwait, to t^e PontTicAL Agent, Kuwait, dated the-17th Muhab- ram 1349 (14th June- 1930). I have pleasure to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 255, dated the 1 instant (Enclosure 6) the contents of which as well as that of the letter and enclosures 1 received by Your Excellency from Ibrahim bin Arfaj through Yusuf an-Nafisi, I have understood. I have also received a letter from the abovementioned 'persone to the same effect including similar list to that sent to Your Excellency Ibn Arfaj pretends that all the animals mentioned therein are still with the Kuwait tribesmen, and that should search be allowed he will find more than that mentioned. All this is over and above the question of the 53 camels notexl down by Muhammad bin Sultan and the 30 camels taken already by the Awazim and the 13- camels which they lately took. Ibn Arfaj’s letter is probably genuine although it has no date and-seal, since the handwriting is the same as that of his previous^ letters As to the shortages mentioned in the. abovementioned papers, I do not think it possible that such a large number of camels as stated could ever have’been in our territory, and certainly neither the officials of Ibn Saud, whom we sent with our son Abdullah al-Jabir, and who twice carried out the necessary searches in their own way, heard of them. The first of these was Barjas bin Uthman and his companions. If there had been so many camels, how did they fail to find them. Moreover to concentrate and confine the tribes &amp;gain for another search would be real persecution, and would injure their property greatly. We also wrote to the abovementioned Ibn Arjaf with regard to the shortages, and said that should anything besides that noted down by Ibn Sultan be found, he should let us know so'that we may do whatever may be necessary. Is it not correct to say that we agreed to return everything that was reported to us l Ibn Arjaf’s letter with its enclosures is herewith enclosed. Enclosure 8 to Serial No. (44). Translation.

With reference to the shortages, there has been no shortcoming from your nart because you have done whatever action that was necessary. But may God save vou the ways of the Bedouin are not unknown to you, and it appears to us that most of the animals now with the Arabdar have been left with them in trust even through the Araibdar claim to have bought them. Hence, may God pro- lon&lt;- your life, and as the proverb has it, “ Follow the humble up to his family's hoifse ”. This saying is just and it can apply to Nejd property as well as to that of Kuwait subjects. In the Present case It means that all camels that can be recognised as the property of Nejd subjects and are now with subjects of Kuwait should be recovered and distributed through, your hands. (And my plan is this.) Each present owner (Kuwait subject who has bought a Nejd camel) should be given a letter from you to us, or to any of our retainers (officials) stating that a certain camel or camels were found to be in the possession of so and so (Kuwait subject), who bought them from so and so (Nepd subject) at such and such a price, tlmt the camel or camels are being kept (by you Shaikh of Kuwait) until the price be recovered through us from the seller, and that when this price is paid to the buver, the original owner (Nejdi) can return to you and take over his property. This way is the best. You should also warn the peo'ple of Kuwait not to buy any camel without stipulating with its owner that it was not a robbed animal, or had strayed from the people of Nejd. By so doing both of us will find full rest. We shall, also do the same with the people of Nejd that is should any Kuwait subject recognise his camel with anv Nejd subject, we shall restore it in case it was robbed, but should it be sold by any of the Kuwait subjects we shall ask you to undertake payment of its price, and the camel shall then be given hack to its owner. This proposal will keep all matters straight and in good order, will leave no excuse for the robber and will reserve the rights of the people. Please let your brother know should you agree to this proposal, other* wise should you have another proposal please write to your brother. We are prepared and await your reply. , 1 -t-A.' p aiiatiu forces io emer or obtain access erntory, Colonel Biscoe. considers that the best thing for vou to do would be to nnTQin o -i-V. „ en, .• .,•&lt; M 1 . . ^ , i obtain a letter from the Shaikh requesting the official concerned to leave ;™ : - e hand of Khan Sahib Farhan or some simiW to send it out to him by ear by the- liana ot tihan Sahib Fa Hum or some siu&gt;*.»- responsible individual If the bearer of the letter definitely verifies the fa“ that Ibn Sand s officials or forces are within Kuwait territory, the letter shop be delivered and the matter reported by telegram to the Hon’hie the PoM* 1 Kesident who will at once bring the facts to the notice of His Maiestv’s Go''?' 11 ' , Hls M yiesty’s Minister at Jeddah, with a view to suitable remp* tations being made, Should the Shaikh be unwilling to write a letter di«ct&lt; Enclosure 10 to Serial No. (44).

The Hon’blithe Political Resident entirely agrees with the view therein expressed that the time has now come to put a stop to these activities of fin Sand’s agents in Kuwait, and is of the opinion that the Shaikh should be urged strongly to resist any further attempts on the part of Nejd officials to institute searches in Kuwait territory. He has already made great concessions in tins lespect and it is clear that so far from meeting with any response on Ibn Sand s part this attitude on his part is merely construed as weakness and attributed to alarm and fear.

The greatest of these benefits would appear to be that the introduction of electricity would imme diately cause a great reduction in the number of Jhe various nil lamps and other Ughting appliances which are at present imported into the country in great quan- tities, thus reducing the amount of money that leaves the country each year The idea of reducing the amount of money which goes abroad annually is, in fact very dear to the promoters of the scheme, and it is one of the main arguments they employ m endeavouring to enlist public support. ' step was tbe holding of a meeting in the Jedda Municipality pre- sided over by the Governor, to which all the notables and rich merchants of the town were bidden. The Minister of Finance came down from Mecca for the pur- pose of attending.. 1 A speech was read at this meeting in which Jedda citizens were urged to subscribe to the scheme, and were invited to follow the example of their colleagues m Mecca, who, it was stated, had made a splendid response to the call. A list was drawn up of the names of those who wished to subscribe. It is stated that lists containing names of the shareholders will soon be pub lished. J The general feeling about the scheme is that, if properly managed, it will be ' a success, but that the essential condition for this is European control in the engineering department. It is for this reason presumably that Bahra which is outside the zone forbidden to non-Moslems, is suggested as the headquarters of the scheme. Abdullah Suleiman, the Minister of hinauce, who is, apparently, the moving spirit of the scheme, is considering also the engagement of a European as managing director to ensure the proper handling of the financial side of the concern ; royal assent for this has, however, not yet been obtained. The chief drawbacks to the scheme as at present contemplated are, firstly, .fhat the proposed capital of £60,000 will not suffice to cover the cost of any effective scheme, and, secondly, that the people have no confidence in the honesty of the (rovernment s intentions, and fear, for instance, that the Government will not pay for the power it uses. As the Government will probably be the largest consumer, this would be quite sufficient to wreck the scheme. The fate of the Saudieh Motor Company, a scheme which was launched in very similar circumstances, is fresh in the public memory. The public is showing little enthusiasm in taking up the shares offered and is awaiting further developments before committing itself.4 'i nnvtlimtf the towns of Mecca and Jedda are likely to con- If fche ±„ C n curS ou^’of all proportion to their size. The pipulaC sume an amount o inclined when they can to use a number of lights iS ^.‘“^'of no^al requirements, and there would certainly be a stfong popular 'demand for cheaper electricity if it became avarlable.

Enclosure 1 to Serial No, (4), Letter from His Majesty King Feisal of Iraq, to His Majesty King Pin Baud of the Hedjaz, Nejd and Depedencies, dated the 23rd February 1930 (24th KamadhaN 1348), It has been a source of pleasure and gratification for me to he afforded this happy opportunity of meeting Your Majesty and making the acquaintance of your noble person and of establishing relations of firm friendship, and of amity, and intimate understanding between ourselves, our Kingdoms and our people. The memory of those two happy days I shall ever hold among the best and kindest of memories. With the help of God, I shall never forget what has been revealed to me as to the sincerity of Your Majesty’s words and the genuineness of Your Majesty’s desire for the damning upon our two countries of a new era of accord and union such as God (May He be praised and exalted) has enabled us to lay the foundations thereof in the course of our present meet’ng. In view of the very limited time remaining available for the Representatives of our Governments to discuss the questions outstanding between the two countries, I would like to refer to the agreement reached between us in regard to the question of the desert posts and the necessity of settling the said question within the next six months provided that if, may God forbid, no understanding was reached between the two Governments within the said period, the question should then be referred to an arbitration board to pass a definite decision thereon, such board to consist of two members to be nominated by my government and two other members to be nominated by Y r our Majesty's government, and failing agreement between these members the two governments will ask the Government of His Majesty King George Y subject to no objection on her part, to appoint, a person to preside over the said board, and both (Governments) agree in advance to accept the person appointed by her. In conclusion, I wish Your Majesty abundant good lasting happiness. Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (4). l .ETTER FROM HlS EXCELLENCY THE HlGH COMMISSIONER FOR IRAQ, TO HlS Majesty King Eeisal of Iraq, No. R. 0.-61, dated the 28th February 1930. I have received a telegram from His Britannic Majesty’s Political AgeniSf dahrem, communicating the text of the following letter addressed to me by His Majesty King Ibn Sa’ud, which I quote in full for Y'our Majesty’s information Me have the pleasure to express our gratitude to Your Excellency f° r your good efforts in binding the friendly relations between us and our brother His Majesty King Faisal, and also between our two Govern' merits and two nations. We are waiting for Your Excellency rulul your promise to us in the last meeting in settling the questionof Iraq acknowledging clearly tire Kingdom of Hedjaz and Nejd and Dependencies as also the question relating to Bin Mashhur and others wdio entered ’Iraq from among the rebels, in a satisfactory manner. In doing so yon will strengthen the relations and remove every cause which may lead to misunderstanding between the two neighbouring Kingdoms. In this connection we thought it fit to bring to Your Excellency’s notice the matter awaiting settlement between Hedjaz, Nejd and Dependencies and ’Iraq which were dis cussed during the last meeting; (1) the friendly neighbouring treaty, which was discussed and settled between the delegates of the two Governments leaving nothing except entering into it in a legal manner ; (2) the question of the forts in which we agreed to the desire of the British and ’Iraq Governments as was mentioned in the letter exchanged between us and our dear brother ; (3) the question of Plunder of the two States, which we authorise our dear brother Faisal to settle. He should either suggest a solution acceptable to us or suggest its transfer to the Tribunal for which we are ready, on condition that the meeting should not be fixed before the month of Safar. If this is desired we should be informed of it before the end of Dul Hijjah; (4) the question of Ibn Mashhur; (5) the Extra dition Treaty. The proposals suggested by us in this connection were handed over to the ’Iraq delegates by our delegates when they were in Koweit, which were discussed and nearly settled in Jeddah when the discussion took place with the regretted late General Clayton, The most important matter about which the Hed jaz and Nejd people are anxious is the question of executing your undertaking which you promised us. We request Your Excellency to reply us very early on the question mentioned above so as to reach us before we reach the interior of Nejd. As you know nothing will remove doubts and strengthen relations between tie two countries except the execution of your last promise to us. Please reply soon. Usual ending.’ King have telegraphed requesting that the following reply may be conveyed to Ibn Sa’ud I thank Your Majesty for your friendly letter of 26th Ramadhan 1348. It was a great pleasure to me to meet Your Majesty and I share the hope that the Meeting between Your Majesty and His Majesty Kmg Feisal will pave the way to permanent friendly relations between the two kings and a satisfactory settlement of all outstanding ques tions between the two Governments and two nations. Your Majesty may rely upon me to spare no effort to ensure this result which is a matter of the deepest interest to His Britannic Majesty’s Government, ’ Your Majesty will, I am convinced, appreciate the importance of giving Kmg Ibn Sa’ud no pretext for claiming that the undertakings given to His Majesty by Your Majesty have not been carried out in any particular and so possibly in- perilling the whole success of the meeting. In regard to Ibn Mashhur for examp e, I consider that King Ibn Sa’ud is justified in contending that Your Majesty gave him to understand that as the result of pardon having been granted to Ibn Mashhur his case would be satisfactorily settled. He certainly anticipated that Your Majesty would be successful in inducing Ibn Mashhur and his fo lowers to return to Najd. I earnestly trust that Your Majesty will find it possible to do this without delay. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Prime Minister, 5 (5) Received on 4th May 1930, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 16, dated the 17th April 1930.) ELEGBAM FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES, TO THE RESIDENT IN THE Perisan Gulf, No. 53, DATED THE 22nd March 19^0. Repea. ld Baghdad, No. 122.) Your telegram No. 48. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, Jeddah has oeen istructed to mention matter to Emir Feisal.% (6) ., „„ in 9 /i PnUtiral Secretary's letter No. 16, dated the 17th Ami Whereupon His Excellency the High Commissioner denied the existence of such undertaking on the part of his Government, except in so far as concerned those who sought refuge in Kuwait. His Majesty, however, did not wish that further oppor tunity should pass without giving a demonstration of his good intentions towards Ivin»• Ibn Sa’ud, and he, therefore, told him that he would spare no effort to pre- vail°upon Ibn Mashhur to return to Nejd, provided that His Majesty King Abdul ’Aziz undertook to accept Ibn Mashhur s dakhala and not to inflict any harm on him. This was done, in that His Majesty King ’Abdul ’Aziz gave an undertaking to that effect. In the course of conversation, His Majesty repreatedly said that the efforts which he intended to bring to bear on Ibn Mashhur did not in any way include his handing over by force or compulsion but would be restricted within the limits of persuasion, and that in the event of failure to persuade him he would be given the choice of leaving for Syria, Persia, or any place he may choose outside Iraq. A similar conversation took place at the last meeting between the Iraq and Nejd delegations, and the Iraq delegation left no opening for misconstruction on this point. The minutes of this meeting are available with His Excellency the Prime Minister. In view of the foregoing, His Majesty cannot see why and in virtue of what previous undertaking, Ibn Mashhur should remain in custody. Nor again can His Majesty see why the release of this individual should be contrary toHis Majesty s undertaking, and what undertaking is meant by His Excellency in the last paragraph of your letter. His Majesty realizes the necessity of strengthening the good relations with His Majesty King ’Abdul ’Aziz and it was on this account that he has already on his own initiative and in spite of all considerations proposed to recognise him as King of Hijaz, asked to meet him and has not hesitated to give all sorts of assurances demonstrating his good intentions. His Majesty hopes that formal “ acquaintance will be achieved through the medium of the Bon Voisinage Agreement, over the principles of which understanding has been reached and which it is hoped will he concluded at an early date. As regards the question of Ibn Mashhur, the best means for the persuasion of this man and for enabling Plis Majesty most success fully to exert his efforts is to release him forthwith and restore to him his pro perties in order that he should feel sure that intentions towards him are good and that the statements regarding his return to Nejd and the intentions of King ’Abdul j-i-zyl towards him are true and serious.)6 M ka, 'SEu- for Hi, ^at, wli| s? over Hi | dh mi ainst ir Force Coe 1 the eiisti as concii Fish thatM jood inteii .IS M not to litti azgaveaif MI' be restrict^ he may P for miscoif th Bis fc dy. ^ | ontrarytoi 5 Excellency *■ he go 1 ) reco; formal'*' reAjwf hiclit^.

On passage from Jeddah heavy weather was encountered off the Farasan Banks and ship took shelter under lee of Jebel Zukur 24-26th February. 3. During this period a visit was paid by Medical Officer to Abu Ail Lighthouse in response to her urgent request for medical assistance. The patient p?oved to be the senior Lighthouse Keeper and was attended to with satisfactory results. ^ eat ' ier moderating night patrols were carried out, underway, during the 26th February m the direction of Mersa Eejera and on the 27th the shin anchored oft Dubab, ship being darkened. One fishing boat was encountered having come from Raheita, Eritrea, but with this exception remark ably few dhows were sighted, probably due to the recent heavy weather. IV.—ADEN. The Resident, Sir Stewart Symes, was absent on a visit to Bombay, Colonel Reilly,^ First Assistant officiating. The usual visits were exchanged. The steam yacht Sapphire (Lady Fairhaven) was in harbour homeward bound. Count and Countess de Sirbor (nee Miss S3lfridge) had arrived that morning (1st March) from Jibouti in their Moth light aeroplane. The Count, I was informed, although a Frenchman, has strong English sympathies and had expressed himself as not at all favourably impressed with the administration of French Somaliland. In particular, he was emphatic that no real effective efforts were being made to stamp out the slave trade. 2. Group Captain Maclean, Air Officer Commanding, informed me that matters were proceeding satisfactorily in the establishment of a chain of landing grounds between Aden and Muscat, and that the Sultan of Kishn is now adopt ing a more amenable attitude. The landing ground at Dhofar is well advanced and the Admiralty have agreed to allow an Admiralty oiler to call there shortly in order to land petrol and supplies. Flight Lieutenant Rickards, R.A.F., is making a second visit to Kishn and it is anticipated that this time the difficulties experienced (mentioned in my Letter of Proceedings No. 114/84, dated the 13th January 1930) will be smoothed over. Group Captain Maclean informed me he was anxious to obtain as much information as possible on the subject of Abyssinia, the usual reports from Addis Ababa being of little value from a flying point of view. This will be communicated to H. M. S. “ Dahlia ” in view of her ap proaching visit to these waters. 3. Heavy rains are still being experienced from time to time at Aden, which has assumed for the first time within memory an almost complete green appear ance. V—PERIM-KAMARAN. Night patrols were carried out on the 5th March, three dhows being searched off Khor Omeira at early dawn. 2. After coaling at Perim ship proceeded on night patrol in the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb and off Brothers’ Islands, anchoring on the 8th March at Great Hanish Island. I have heard it stated that the Italians propose to establish a lighthouse oh one of the Haycock Islands, situated just south of Great Hanish Island, presumably with a view to improving the navigation to and from Massawa. Should this be so it would seem to explain the object of the recent visit of Dr. Cibelli, Commissioner of Asab (mentioned in my letter of Proceed ings No. 114/83, dated the 25th November 1929) to the Great Hanish Group. Night patrol was continued on Sunday 9th March, rendezvous being made wit^ H. M. S. “ Endeavour ” at Kamaran on Monday 10th March, when mails and provisions were delivered to her from Aden. Air Mail from Aden was received same day. 3. The Administrator had little information to impart. It is understood the salt works project at Salif is again under consideration. Mr. Holmes, the late manager (pre-war) has been staying in Kamaran in this connection. Captain M0275FD10 „ r , , iam is however doubtful whether anything will come of it and considers has no Ll intention of coming to terms. VLr p™ S ifo?thwa L rds N w S a S continued on Tuesday 11th March, ship entered ratroi noiu approaches known as the Pearly Gates at 10 a. m. ^fhfmh March two dhows being searched en route. This entrance on the whole is a good and safe method of approach to the Farasans. There am however, several dS fathom patches in the approaches and ship anchored for a short period for the purpose of fixing the position of these (not shown on the chart). 1 O Before leaving Aden Group Captain Maclean had asked me if possible, to Obtain information as to the condition of the landing ground on Disan Island L northernmost island of the Farasan Group, and with this m view ship anchored in Abtein Bay 12th March P. M. The landing ground was found to be u, qn,te good condition and good water fit for drinking was found at a depth of four feet on the beach nearby. The island is uninhabited. It is believed this landing ground was established during the late war. This information has been con- veyed separately to Air Officer Commanding, Aden, together with other air intelligence relative to the southeast coast of Arabia and Akik Ivebir. Letters of appreciation have been received from him in acknowledgment. The anchor age in Abtein Bay is poor and steep to depths shoaling suddenly from 30 fathoms to 3| fathoms. 3. Patrol was continued on 13th March and anchorage made at Khor Meadi off the village of Hela, no suspicious dhows were met with all being obviously engaged pearl fishing. No activities were observed as regards oil drilling opera tions either in the vicinity of Za-l-fif (Red Sea Petroleum Co.’s concession) or along the coast and information received from the crews of fishing dhows visited as to the presence of any Europeans in the islands was negative. Ship left vicinity of the Farasans on 14th March anchoring at Telia Telia Kebir, Suakin Archipelago, 15th March. Patrol north was continued on 17th March arriving Port Sudan on that date. With the exception of one large fishing dhow searcbed at Telia Telia Kebir nothing special to report, SECTION “ C ”. Slave Trade. Little information has been received during this period, There is a rumour to the effect that the celebrated Doctor Manfried is at Obok and contemplates crossing to Arabia shortly for “ Business ” purposes. A further report has been received from H. M. S. “ Dahlia ” containing information from Addis Ababa. 2. Materials are being collected for a brochure to contain information as to the regulations in force in the countries bordering the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, governing native passenger and pilgrim traffic to and from Arabia ; also police controls in the ports and along the coast. When completed this should assist sloops on slave patrol duties. The want of concise information on this subject has long been felt. It may further prove useful should it be considered necessary at some future date to bring to the notice of the Authorities bordering the Arabian C oast the absence of similar organisation by way of comparison in their waters. *** * * * ^ ^ ^ * *** Copies to :— Secretary of the Admiralty, Commanding Officer, H.

The Shaikh gave it as his opinion that Ibrahim-bin-Arfaj, whom he knows as another petty commander of His Majesty King Bin Sand’s, like Mohamed-ibn- Sultan has been deputed with the sole and express purpose of tightening up the blockade against Kuweit, and that the table that he is coming up to post himself in the vicinity of the ‘ Iraq-Kuweit-Nejd frontiers to settle certan matters between Nejd tribes, is so much camouflage, especially the story that he will be ready to receive complaints from the ’Iraq or Kuweit frontier authorities against Nejd tribes. 5. The Shaikh added that Ibrahim-bin-Arfaj, was the Commander of the Nejd “ Sarriyeh ” stationed with the “ Subei ” and Sahool tribes, when al-duwish at tacked and defeated them in July 1929 at Gaiyeh (Qaiya) near Artawiyeh (reported in my No. 468, dated 12th August 1929). 6.

I am sending copies of this despatch and its enclosures to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Iraq. The Political Resident in the Per sian Gulf and the Political Agent at Koweit. Enclo. Memorandum from His Majesty the King to the BritIish Government, dated 14th September 1929. The British Government have learnt that we have left the Hejaz in these days for Nejd, after we had received complete assurances from them pledg ing themselves to prevent the rebels who were gathered near the borders of Koweit from taking refuge in, or crossing into Iraq or Koweit, and to prevent any assistance reaching them from either of these sources. We left intend ing to march on the rebels wherever they might be and to punish them in such a way as to finish with them and by the strength and will of God to prevent eir rising up ever afterwards. But we were delayed in expediting this plan by the intense heat and the difficulty of conducting the troops from the routes’and Jbe 1“ ° PP . ressive se ^ son &gt; when water is scarce along the routes and the camels grazing grounds are parched. For this reason we p s poned our expedition against the rebels and were content with strength ening the forces confronting them, so that ilow, with God’s help these ifave otTSftt 0 Gulf 1 t! a T ttaok f f ma * take p °- tv. a ^ lnst Gulf. It so happened that during our halt. Feisal ed oweish and his followers received some encouragement from certain ouar- rs, details of whose activities we will furnish below. He thought of carry mg out some raids to prove to those quarters which were urging h‘m on that he was starting on his activities. His first object was a b&lt;X of Saba an tribesmen encamped at the wells of El Qa’ivah about six hours purney from Artawiyah. The Saba’an learnt of his intention and cameZ towards him with their camels which were the obiect of his search ?n or Z to entice him into figh ting them. They wished by this means'to'lead him and an . encount&lt; ?- an d left no one at the wells save their women and children d ™ en ’ w lth w ho m no one has any desire to fight Ed Doweish how er went another way and the two parties did not meet. So Ed Doweish V A i/?2 the wells and found no forces there except a small number, whom arrived at he was able to cteieat. He then killed tne children and the women ^ _ anci wuen tne baba'an learnt of tins they returned to the wells m order to e flgage Kd Uoweisn but he and his followers had hed by the way he came, a ™ ss the desert, ft afterwards happened that some individuals from among the followers of Ed Doweish, who were formerly with Ibn Mashhur, belonging to the Ataibah and others, sent to their companions m Aejd requesting them to ask for an amnesty for themselves if they returned. We promised them a free pardon if they would return and submit to the . judgment of the Sharia Court. They showed their indignation with Feisal ed Doweish and parted from him, to return to their homes. In view of the longings aroused m them by those in Iraq their minds became filled with evil, and when they reached their homes they declared among certain enemies that the Sherif Faisal in Iraq was backing them and that he had sent his brother the Sherif Ali to attack the Hejaz from the direction of Transjordan, and that he him self was prepared to march on Nejd from Iraqi if he saw them rise against us in the interior of our country. Among the rebels were certain of the Ataibah who were living in Iraq under the care of King Faisal, such as Mo hammed el Khndhary, Obeid bin Faisal ibn Hameid and others. Satan temp ted the foolish among the Ataibah to obey them and some of them even refus ed to pay their Zikat, and some looted the camels of certain persons who were passing. We immediately ordered the forces stationed at various posts to hasten, each detachment from its station, and fight all those who had asso ciated themselves with the evildoers by word, deed, opinion or assistance. So we despatched a force under the command of our Nephew Khalil Ibn Mohammed, and God gave judgment on all the evildoers whose minds mis gave them, and everything became perfectly quiet in the interior of Nejd by God’s grace and favour. So nothing remains for us to do except to march against the rebels in the North, where we shall punish them, and, if God will, by the middle of Rabia el Thani, our force will be ready to march. But something new has occurred, on which we should like to have the opinion of the British Government, so that no difficulties may arise in the future, through any misunderstanding, or for any reason at all. Before going into this matter we consider that it would be very useful to unfold to the British Government a summary of the events which have taken place contrary to the undertakings of the British Government and we firmly believe that these things happened without their consent. Before quoting particulars of these events we find it impossible not to mention with praise and thanks the kind ^orts of all the British officials both of Iraq and of Koweit against the rebels, and we have no remark whatever to make on their attitude towards us, especially as regards the collection of information which has reached us roTn Colonel Dickson of Koweit, the whole of which points to the firmness and resolution with which he met the events, and shows his eager desire to carry out his Government’s policy in those regions. m • ^ m ^ tters which we to bring to the notice of His Britannic Majesty s Government are the following: — a* 16 enc * Hijja and the beginning of Moharram (June) t t^ S ° 6 n an d of Ibn Mashhur and those with them began to and amm^ ei f an ^ as g ues ts of Ibn Sabah, and purchased all the arms and ammunition they have now obtained. datci^ ld 1 ™^ ^ Ibn S i abal1 Wrote t0 their clliefs &gt; g ivin g them bread and dates, and gave them nearly six thousand rials. ’ 8 g Kowih date als °’ P n Mashllur and the Ajman purchased from Jstates 5 2“—'■&gt;' s *“ - ** * the eonnaelfnf^aV. 1111 ' 11 ' 5 ’ ^ y o h a rram (June) a convoy of sixty men under they we“e met L aw Sabah ' The V P»‘ L at Adiliya. where turned to A] Wafrah ' ^ 6 Jablr Wh ° welcomed them . and then re '(5) lowards the middle of Moharram Abd el Aziz ed Doweish came to Milh and sent Ibn Shablan, who was with him, to Koweit. Ibn Sabah sent to the son of Ed Doweish one thousand dollars as a present. (6) During the month of Safar, Abd er Rahman el Qusaibi was at Koweit and one afternoon at the house of Hilal El Mutairi he saw Haif El Fuqm. It is well known that this Euqm is the man who raided Koweit re cently, just before the Sabilla campaign, and took much loot from Koweiti subjects. He is the person also about whom the British Government com plained as having caused the death of the wireless operator or one of the British aeroplanes, (7) About the beginning of Rabi Awal (August) Ed Doweish after raid ing Qa’iyat sent Hilal and El Shuheiri to Koweit to announce the evil deeds perpetrated by at Doweish at Qa’iyah. Both are Ibn Sabah’s men and both accompanied Doweish on his last foray. (8) About the beginning of Rabi Awal also, Sahman sent to Koweit to announce that he had attacked the people of Thalathein at Hunidh, and the fact is that it is he who was attacked at the said well. (9) On the said date Abu Widain sent a messenger called Fila to an nounce that he had attacked eleven motor cars in the desert and had burnt them. These messengers crossed into Koweit and all were generously treated. .' --r,,.: i ! \ (10) On the 5th Moharram 1348 (June 12th 1929) Ebeid Ibn Faisal Ibn Hamaid left Bagdad for Koweit as the emissary of King Faisal, and explain ed to him the result of his mission. On his return he carried a letter from the rebels to King Faisal. (11) In Safar (July) Ebeid Ibn Faisal Ibn Hameid returned from Bagdad provided with certain financial assistance from King Faisal. He arrived in Koweit, where he purchased four camels and a tent to use on his going out with the Duheinah. (12) On the 20th Moharram (27th June) Ali Abu Shuweirabat and Mo hammed El Khudhari, after being received by King Faisal, left Bagdad for Koweit in order to meet Ed Doweish, Ibn Mashhur and Ibn Hithalain. (13) On the 14th Safar (27th July) Abu Shuweirabat returned with letters to King Faisal at Bagdad. He reported that he had reached Koweit and travelled with Mohammed El Khudhari until he met Ed Doweish. Both of them then returned to Koweit where El Khudhari purchased a riding camel and returned on it to Ed Doweish, while Abu Shuweirabat returned to Bagdad, with the letters he was carrying to King Faisal in order to report on the result of his endeavours. (14) Towards the end of Moharram, Sha’eifan Abu Shagarah, Matrik Ibn Higna, Burhan El Gabali, Ali Ibn Abdullah son of Abu Shuweirabat and Eid El Mas’oudi El Duheina all left Bagdad for Koweit in order to be in touch with and in correspondence with the rebels. They met Ed Doweish, Ibn Mashhur and the Duheima. The men are continually going to and fro between Koweit, Bagdad and the rebels, within the sight of everyone. (15) On 17th Safar 1348 (24th July) Rageh Ibn Shaheen and Uhmud El Khammash, a relative of Abdullah Ibn Misfar, one of King Faisal’s chamberlains, left Bagdad for Koweit having with them six horses, which they sent to the rebels. (16) Abd er Rahman El Qusaibi, passing through Koweit learnt from the most reliable sources that a certain Zubeir received eight horses through a man belonging to Abdullah Ibn El Misfar. It was intended to send these horses to the rebels. El Qusaibi also learnt from the same reliable source that other horses had been previously sent from Iraq on behalf of the rebels. El Qusaibi learnt from a reliable official source in Koweit that Abu Shuweirabat and Ibn Humeid arrived at Koweit on a mission from Kino' Faisal, but Colonel Dickson did his utmost to prevent them from carrvW out their desires.

As h ra f” who will not cease from their activities, plaints against ^ m ar | fo had relations between us and the „ from Koweit and from King Faisal. We bring this to the truth of our previous com- These^resSt in our being hurt, lead to bad relations between us and Neighbouring countries and aOso tend to trouble the relations between us and the British Government. What we have mentioned in the foregoing is not of first class import, ance to us, because we are convinced by the might and strength of God that these intrigues will not have the slightest effect on our situation. In the divs of their full might and strength m the Heyaz, the Ashraf were power less to resist us So he who sent' us victorious against them at the time of their power and might is a guarantee in our eyes for putting an end to their intrigues, which could only have regrettable results in that we were com- pelled to destroy the souls which w-ere lured away by these plottings. If God will, we shall overtake the rest of those who were seduced by Satan, to gether with the intriguers and also those whose souls beguiled them. All this is not of great importance to us, but what is of importance is our relations with the British Government, with whom ^e Lke to have an understanding in all matters so that no clash may occui between us and them, neither in the present nor in the future. ^ e should line therefore, after this preamble, to explain the situation which has bpz-ome so ambigu ous for us, and on which we should like to know the opinion of the British Government. It is this— (1) Towards the middle of Safar 134S (July 1929) some of the Ajman, owning one hundred and fifty huts and tents, went and camped at Shamiyah Fantas, Abu Halifa, Sha’iba and Arifgan. (2) The major part of the Ajman left Shamiyah for Naqra and went to Qusur. (3) A1 Suleiman of the Ajman camped at Qurein A1 Subeihiya. (4) A section of A1 Safran camped at Arifgan. (5) Rashaida camped at Qurein. (0) On 25th Rabi A1 Awal Ed Doweish and his Mutair followers left Qurein for A1 Suhaihiya on the Koweit frontiers. From this it will be clear to the British Government that the undertaking which we obtained from the British Government as regards preventing the rebels from taking refuge in Koweit territory, was not carried out bv the Koweit Govern ment. These rebels have carried all their propertv. their women and every thing they fear for; and placed it in safe custody in Koweit territory, and their armed fighting men have come forth into Xeid to carrv on their mis- 1 lu h vous activities. The British Government had promised to expel them 1 t0r0t j U 1 « to °k refuge there and &gt;'et thev are sittinsr in safety. are ready to march on them and we do not care a iot for Koweit or those ,1 oa r° i here - are concerned about is what the attitude of the Rmisa Government will be if these people should remain in Koweit tei- [ t&lt;r&gt; r,nd should wish to attack them Wih the British Government 2'hrh GG h this?

F i i » his followers by the King of Iraq. The last proposal made to the rebels by King Faisal is that Doweish and his companions should m^rch into Iraq territory and proceed thence into Syrian territory. We have been preparing a force to stand in Doweish’s way if he wished to escape to Syria. This force we have put under the command of our Emir I Abd el Aziz Ibn Musa’id who has been encamped with his troops for a con siderable period over against Aqaba. What will be the attitude of the Bri tish Government if those rebels wish to flee to Syria by way of Iraq ? We are very much afraid that the promise exchange between the rebels may be put into effect, namely the promise which either the Iraq Government or King Faisal has made to the effect that should they so intend he will with draw the Iraq forces from their path so that they can pass, and afterwards it will be declared that they passed through Iraq territory by stealth, with out the knowledge of anyone. The British Government will perceive that if this happens it will in jure our interests and those of Iraq alike. What strengthens this suspicion and confirms this probability is the fact of which we informed the High Commissioner for Iraq, and which was communicated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to His Excellency the British Agent at Jedda concerning the journey of Ibn Mashhur to Bagdad to secure this object. Will the Bri tish Government have any objection if we send a force to take up its station near the Iraq frontiers, to watch for the flight of these rebels, so that if it should learn anything about them, it might attack them wherever they might be. Then, supposing that they should manage to escape and reach Syria, will the British Government have any objection if we pass over any territory in which British influence is exercised, in order to. get rid of them? These things will probably happen after our expedi tion against the rebels, because we have determined by the will and power of God to pursue them wherever they may be, till we put an end to them, by the will and power of God. We should therefore like to learn the opinion of the British Government frankly and clearly as regards all these probabi lities, which are bound up with the rush for an asylum now taking place on the Koweit frontier, and which are as likely to happen as is the flight of those who will flee to Syria by way of Iraq. This is the subject on which we are awaiting a reply from the British Government. We have written about what is happening at Koweit and Iraq to the High Commissioner for Iraq and the Resident for the Persian Gulf for their information as regards what is happening contrary to the wishes and to the undertakings of the British Government.

The attack took place in the vicinity of Nabk. The loot taken was ten camels and three rifles. 3.

(Repeated Kuwait.) ’Iraq Government represent that owing to lack of grazing in immediate neighbourhood of Sarwan Iraq tribes have penetrated into Kuwait territory as far as Rodhatain. They are dependent on Safwan for water and their range is therefore limited. ’Iraq Government ask that permission of Sheikh of Kuwait may be given to ’Iraq Police cars to protect ’Iraq camels in Kuwait territory on the conditions stated in paragraph 2 of memorandum enclosed with my No. 1306 (No. 1307 to Kuwait) of 1st July.

Shaikh whom I only saw last night after an absence of 2 days agrees to ’Iraq police cars entering his territory for purpose mentioned, on the con dition laid down in paragraph 2 of High Commissioner’s memorandum under reference; though he emphasises there is no danger from Akhwan raids today; Shaikh however is extremely nervous lest police also Dhafir and Shammar whom they are to protect do not play the game; especially as whole of Kuwait “Hathar” element which include many Mutair and Ajman their hereditary enemies, are themselves now grazing to the north, north east and west of Jahrah with several thousands of camels and sheep. As Shaikh is anxious there should be no repetition of regrettable incidents of last year s when Dhafir, in, particular, behaved very badly he requests that most strin gent order be issued that populace ajjide'strictly by the conditions laid down and above all that they prevent small parties of Bedouins under their charge from issuing forth secretly for purpose of lifting cattle or other acts of aggression on Kuwait subjects.T. 10 Enclo. 3- Telegram from the Political Agent, Kuwait, to the Political R ES i. 1 ELEGRAM^^ Bushire&gt; No 029, DATED THE 16TH NOVEMBER 1929. (Repeated High Commissioner, Baghdad.) In continuation of my No. 628 (Enel. 2). Sheikh, who visited me again yesterday about this matter, asked me to represent to you that (quote) while he in no way desires to go back on his permission to allow police cars to enter his territory he would like to know why ’Iraq camel tribes m question cannot be made to graze due west of Safwan and inside ’Iraq territory where grazing is as plentiful as across his border. Should there be objection to this which he is unaware of, he suggests, to ensure order and to avoid possible cause of friction and unpleasantness, the Dhafir and Shammar now grazing in his territory and watering at Safwan be transferred to some of many wells existing south of railroad, for instance, Shajra, Baswa, Abu Char, Nabha or Chabda, the last named in particular having a supply of water for any number of camels with an inexhaustible supply of grazing in the vicinity. Sheikh rather pertinently asks why his territory which he wants for his own people, should be selected for the grazing of ’Iraq camels in, when ’Iraq has superb grazing available near at hand. Sheikh adds his above remarks are not intended to apply to the special migration of the Muntafiq shepherd tribes into Kuwait which is of advantage to himself as well as to shepherds owing to the wool and ghi they bring in. (unquote). Whilst I do not wish to raise an unnecessary awkward issue I cannot but sympathise with Sheikh’s point of view especially as from my knowledge of the country in question I know that he is right about this there being an abundance of water and grazing at the places mentioned by him. I suggest therefore, if you see no objection, that the ’Iraq Government be asked to meet the Sheikh in this matter.

Should latter take generous line, which I think he will, seeing that Akhwan are an unbroken force and still very strong submission of Dawish with whole of rebgl force(s) may be expected.12 If on the other hand Ibn Sand demands unconditional surreiider of Dawish nreliminary to any discussion latter may either decide to try his luck in further resistance or with small following attempt to make for Syria. ] n former case he will, I think, make for Neutral zone and try and gather Shammar round him for final struggle.

His Majesty’s Government have given proof of their desire to co operate by supplying arms from India and aeroplanes. They are convinced.that Bin Baud has been misinformed, as regards assistance given to rebels from Iraq and Koweit warning him against accept ing reports from untrustworthy source. In their desire to show readiness to co-operate (i) They have issued instructions to ensure that pledge shall be fully implemented, (ii) Instruc tions have been given to remove all Koweit tribe (s) and refugees of Awazim from the vicinity of the frontier or scene of possible conflict, (iii) Instruc tions have been issued for necessary military measures for ejection of con tending forces that may enter Koweit and Iraq or trans-Jordania. His Majesty’s Government have gone next to possible limit to co-operate, and can in no circumstances allow Bin Baud’s armed forces to enter Koweit and Iraq or trans-Jordania. Apart from the risk that forces might be mis taken for rebels instructions issued for ejection of any contending forces that may cross the frontier would inevitably result in conflict between troops of Bin Baud and His Britannic Majesty’s. Finally they ask Bin Baud to send emissary to Koweit for liaison. I (175) Endorsement by the F. &amp; P. Department, No. F.-75-N./29, dated this 8th December 1929.

I have the honour to inform Your Majesty that some days ago His Excellency the Sheikh of Koweit received a message (of., S. N. 105), from Feisal ed Doweish in which he formulated the following three requests: — (1) He begged to be assured by His Majesty’s Government that they would not permit the tribes of Iraq or Koweit to molest the families of the Mutair and Ajman whom he was leaving behind in their present camping ground South of the Koweit border. (2) He enquired whether His Majesty’s Government would allow his women to cross the Koweit border and to take refuge at Jehrah if they were raided by Your Majesty’s bedouin while he was absent. (3) He wished to be informed whether he would be held responsible by His Majesty’s Government if he shot down the aircraft which he was aware had been sold to Your Majesty by the British Government, or if they were captured by him. 2. The Sheikh of Koweit informed Feisal ed Doweish on November 8th that his questions had been communicated to His Majesty’s Government who had replied (c/., S. No. 169), to the following effect: — His Majesty’s Government did not feel called upon to indicate the attitude which they would adopt in the circumstances referred to by him, but, as regards his second point, the assurance from His Majesty’s Govern ment precluded the grant of refuge to his women in Koweit or Iraq. As regards his third point His Majesty’s Government would take a very serious view of failure on his part to treat with full consideration any British personnel that might fall into his hands. 3. His Majesty’s Government furthermore expressed the desire that in communicating the above it should be made clear that they were not pre pared to enter into any further discussions with Feisal ed Dov/eish who should be warned that if he himself or any of his emissaries crossed the Koweit frontier again they would be liable to arrest or any other action that might be considered necessary. 4. I am instructed, in bringing the foregoing to the knowledge of Your Majesty to emphasize once again the points to which I had the honour to draw Your Majesty’s attention in paragraph 5 of my note No. 2184/1464/j 61 of October 16th last (13.5.1348) (Enclosure to S.

I am starting from Gibraltar in a few weeks time in motor car from this town to Palestine from here with Captain Worth through Arabia over Akaba Djeddah (Mekka-Medina) the capital of Ibn Saud, Oman to Aden this part of the trip will take at least three months. From Aden with steamer to Orbonsi, from here (motor car) to Adis Ababa and if possible over Khartoum—Cairo back to Gibraltar. I speak Arabic fluently as I already have been 4-5 years in the near Orient. I have contracts with about 20 Scandinavian, German and Switzerland papers for this proposed trip, and it is my intention to take a film in con nection with Captain Worth and phonographical records from the countries we are going through. I have written one book on English (from Morocco) under the protec torate of H. R. H. Prince Roger of Denmark and two books in Du ? and Palestine, and poems from Persia. There are only a few facts I should be very pleased if I could get an appointment with the Foreign News Editor with regard to the proposed journey. {Enclo. 2.

XVUWCit I fiave received a letter from the King, dated November 17th reference to my letter to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs of I with News regarding Awazim is incorrect; it is possibly a trick of Doweish in order to have friends within Koweit territory whom he can use. Even supposing it were a fact, is it lawful for the Sheikh of Koweit in the present critical circumstances to allow portion of the King s subjects to leave his country and settle in Sheikh’s territory? The King therefore protests strongly against the action of the Sheikh of Koweit as also against approval given it by the British Government and requests all persons claiming to be Awazim or other subjects of His Majesty who may have taken refuge in Koweit should be expelled at once as this embarrasses his action against rebellions.

I did not in my note to Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs of the 1st November use the argument mentioned in paragraph 2 of your telegram No. 113 (S.

No. (206) (Received on IJdh December 1929 with Political Secretary's letter No. 18, dated 28th November 1929.) i ' Telegram P., from the British Agent, Jeddah, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 172, dated the 25th November 1929. (Repeated Bushire and Kuwait, No. 226.) A messenger from Riyadh to Amir Feisal in Jeddah has brought a report that Doweish has asked for pardon but that the reply given by the King was that this can only be decided by Sharia. The report adds that the King pioposes to attack at once in force. It is stated privately that Ibn Saud intends to attack Kuwait as the ' ftl ' ' t® supporting rebels. In this connection it is significant that u a conversation which I had with Acting Minister fof Foreign Affair25 yesterday the latter restated somewhat emphatically his case against Kuwait He also handed me an aide memoire which he stated represented only his own personal Jiews and which is in the main a tirade against perfidy of Koweit ° n \ me , 0± memorandu m enclosed in my despatch No. 255 of the 30th September (S. No 162), though it also states that incidents have occurred there which are difficult to explain save on the grounds that His Maiestv’s Government have gone back on their undertakings. It is also insistently demanded by Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs that any re hel entering Mesopotamia or Koweit should be arrested, tried and punished and that he should be disarmed in accordance with internation al law. Here he says he also speaks for Hedjaz Government. He had not yet received news of Doweish’s offer to submit. I he coincidence of the King s projected move to the neighbourhood of Koweit border as foreshadowed by Hafez Wahba [see my telegram 165 of 8th November (S. No. 177)], the present attitude of Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs despite all past assurances and rumour referred to above suggest possibility that Ibn Sand may be tempted to use the opportunity of presence of his forces on Koweit border, which has been so strongly recom mended by His Majesty’s Government, in order to teach Koweit a lesson. Present intention of Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs may therefore be to forestall eventual protests in case of action by Ibn Saud against Koweit.

Following is gist of note just received from Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. In spite of optimism expressed in my note of September 27th— vide my despatch No. 251 —it has been reported to him that tribes of Trans-Jordania are making expeditions on large scale in their Nejd boundaries along a line from Wady Sirhan to the Red Sea. Several attacks have taken place involv ing incalculable loss to life and property. Amongst these is a raid carried out by Trans-Jordian Arabs against Shararat near Jauf about August 30th and another against a caravan which had left Maan for Misheitiya and Halaj near Tebuk when seven men of the caravan were taken prisoners, one killed and the whole caravan looted. Several other attacks in force by Trans-Jordanian raiders have taken place near Tebuk and much property captured including sheep and cattle of government and of the Emir of Tebuk himself. Strong measures are required to stop this and the Hejaz government hope that His Majesty’s Government will co-operate to this end. The usual protest follows.

My telegram No. 1200 (repeated to Colonial Office as No. 71). Koweit reports that all Akhwan camels watering have left Jeddah has been informed. Consequently while grateful to the High Commissioner and Air Officer Commanding for their prompt offer to expel the rebels’ camels Sheikh no longer requires assistance. The camels seen by the aeroplanes are his own and Koweit animals which are now all drinking at Jahrah. As regards threat from Ibn Saud such a possibility appears remote and the Sheikh does not think counter measures necessary for the present. Should threat materialise however he will not only ask for by gratefully accept fullest assistance. * In these circumstances I now consider situation to be normal and the request for armoured cars may be definitely cancelled. 28th November.

Telegram from His Majesty’s Agent and Consul, Jeddah, to Poreign Office, London, No. 174, dated the 27th November 1929. (Repeated to Bushire, Koweit, and Baghdad No. 228.) Following is gist of letter received from The King dated November 17th. The rebels have learnt of Ibn Sand’s imminent attack and have been advised from high quarters in neighbouring countries to scatter if they cannot withstand him and to save themselves hy mingling with Arabs of Koweit and Iraq. Paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of my letter of October 16th {vide my despatch No. 268) (Serial No. 182 in F. No. 75-N/29), call he says for special attention. As to paragraph 4 he has not the least desire to cross frontiers of Iraq and Kowuit, he requested permission to do this as a precautionary measure to be acted upon when absolutely necessary and in the event of forces in Koweit and Iraq being unable to prevent insurgents from taking refuge there when pursued by him. What does British Government expect him to do in such an event ? If he were to withdraw leaving mutineers safe in Koweit territory they would be free to create fresh trouble. As to paragraph 5 it is obvious that intention to scatter amongst Arabs of Koweit and Iraq when hard pressed is known to British Government. As regards hope expressed in this paragraph he wishes that British Governmetit would have explained how he can prevent rebels entering Koweit and Iraq territory when Government of Koweit has not prevented them and they are still watering their animals within the refuge of Koweit territory, he himself being debarred from entering it. The position as British Government must realise is difficult for him. As he has actually moved off and expects in a few days to establish contact wuth insurgents, and as in desert warfare it is essential to seize the first opportunity of attack, he suggests the following :— {a) That Koweit Government should order their subjects to collect in an appointed locality far from any likely scene of action and should comer them with an armed force. He should be informed of the locality chosen. An adequate force should then be placed by Koweit Government on frontier to repel rebels—he does not think air force alone would suffice. British Govern ment officials should with two forces (presumably Ibn Saud’s and Koweit frontier force) push back insurgents as far as possible even operating within Nejd itself. Any rebel who may 101S(s) F&amp;PD. t.f'iui ' ;’oUi{ t FOREiu.J ■ * • H 1 \ t - mi sd 2&lt; APR -bea 12 MAY, J30 * , ^2 succeed in crossing frontier should be arrested and handed over In this event he says there would he no need for him t 0 cross it himself. (b) If all this is impossible he suggests that subjects of Koweit should be concentrated as in {d) that he should then be left free to pursue rebels anywhere. In this ca&amp;e he undeitakes to protect subjects of neighbouring countries from any aggression. He also promises not to leave a single soldier in those countries a moment after pursuit insurgents is over. Thus the rebels will he annihilated. This is in his opinion the only way of dealing with the problem and exterminating mutineers. After all his efforts, trouble and expense it will be impossible to return without completely crushing them. If British Govern- ment does not agree with ^ either suggestion the consequences will be regret table. He grieves for suffering which he is inflicting on. part of his subjects and on their women and children when nothing originally obliged him to punish them except the fact that they have violated assurance (given by him to British Government) by attacking Iraq and Koweit subjects. It was in cumbent on him to punish them most severely in order to safeguard his pledge. If neighbouring countries do not wish to assist him in his efforts to secure their safety and that of their subjects he does not wish his action to result in clash between his forces—particularly as he is commanding them in person— and those of the British Government; this is the situation which he is tryino to avoid and which please God cannot occur. If the immediately foregoing presumption is correct he would have to abandon not only punitive measures undertaken but also a plan for ensuring internal security. He will not then be responsible for any aggression against neighbouring countries. He will be justified before himself and the world for he will have fought against his own people for the sake of neighbours w T ho shelter their own deadly enemies and help these against himself. He is now setting forth. If either of his two suggestions is met well and good. If not he will to his regret be compelled to adopt last mentioned attitude and declining all responsibility will take no further measures to prevent attacks against neighbouring countries. The responsibility will then lie with thes countries. (3) {Received on 22nd December 1929, with Political Secretary's letter No. 49, dated the 5th December 1929.)

Following is message referred to in my immediately preceding telegram (Serial No. 7). His Majesty’s Government have learnt of contents of Your Majesty’s letter of November 17th to British Agent at Jeddah with regret. They have never failed in the undertakings which they have repeatedly given to Your Majesty s to use all the means in their power to prevent the improper use of Koweit and Iraqi territory by Your Majesty’s rebellious sub- jec s. ne efforts which the latter have made to take refuge in Koweit em ory ave indeed already been frustrated more than once, and on September r ,. y s Government recognised the sincerity and efficiency with v uc i ae ii [si authorities in Koweit had carried out their undertakings by formally thanking them for their efforts. recc3 s a ^ ar ® Majesty’s Government were approached as rantefis^fnr V Vem ^ er ^ ^ e i sa l e( i Hawish with requests forgua- rerturerfor nrri-^ Th ^ are credibly informed thaUhe sed to Ynnr YTn ^ 101 -^ eisa l Bawish is reported recently to haveaddres- which Hisr&lt; Were P rinc iP a lty due to the uncompromising attitude vffich ms Majesty s Government have taken up in reply to these requests. earnest desire fon-^° V6 T m6 ^r m oreover given material proof of their lion in North-East Npa\ e W1 ^? 1 j^ our ^ a 3 e sty in the suppression of the rebel* arms which You ui'wnfi '' assls .I u § Your Majesty to obtain from India tie future on spJcWlv f?™ y and ^ ^ranging to supply in the near thenec:«kSsh ;“son fe 1 ter p Sf k Ur aero P la ^ °f the^afest type with personnel. Further supplies of material for use withthese aeroplanes are already on the way out to the Persian Gulf and should reach Darin early in ^December. His Majesty’s Government feel certain that tliese explanations will dispel any misunderstanding as to their attitude. • C . areful e^uiries have convinced His Majesty’s Government that Your Majesty must have been misinformed as to the assistance which the rebels have obtained from Koweit and Iraq. His Majesty’s Government desire in this connexion to place Your Majesty on your guard against the acceptance of reports rrom interested and unreliable sources. Turning now to.the specific requests contained in Your Majesty’s com- mumcation, His Majesty s Government, in addition to the restrict instructions alieady given to their authorities in Koweit and Iraq, of the nature of which Your Majesty has been informed, have taken the following action. In their desire to meet Your Majesty’s wishes as far as possible and to show their readiness to co-operate whole heartedly with Your Majesty in the re-establish ment of peace and order in Your dominions, (1) they have now issued renew ed instructions which should ensure that the pledges already given to Your Majesty shall be fully implemented. (2) Instructions have been given to secure the removal of all Koweiti tribes and of the refugee Awazim from the vicinity of the frontier or from any scene of possible conflict. (3) Instruc tions have been given to concert the necessary military measures for the ejection of any of the contending forces that may entered Koweiti or Iraqi territory, and to intercept wherever possible isolated groups of rebels entering such territery for the purpose of merging with local tribes in the manner which Your Majesty suggests. With regard to the communication addressed by lour Majesty’s Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs to the British Agent at Jeddah, suggesting that the rebels may attempt to escape into Transjorda nian territory, instructions on similar lines have now been sent to the High Commissioner for Transjordan which should effectively guard against this danger. Your Majesty will see from the foregoing that His Majesty’s Government have gone to the furthest possible limit in their endeavour to co-operate with Your Majesty on the lines suggested by You. They regret, however, that they cannot in any circumstances modify their decision against allowing Your Majesty’s armed forces to enter Koweiti, Iraqi or Tranjordanian territory. Apart from the risk of which Your Majesty has already been informed by the British Agent at Jeddah that such forces might be mistaken for rebels, the instructions issued to the British local authorities for the ejection of any of the contending forces that may cross the frontier would inevitably result in Your forces coming into conflict with those of His Britannic Majesty, a contingency which His Majesty’s Government and Your Majesty would equally deplore. In conclusion, His Majesty’s Government would again point out that the task of itheir military authorities would be rendered less difficult if Your Majesty could designate an emissary from Your military forces to keep the local frontier authorities in Koweit informed of the movements of Your Majesty’s Hoops and of the rebels.

Then We received Your Excellency’s letter No. 2194/1464/61 of 13 . 5 . 10 ^ (16th October 1929) (Enclo. to Serial No. 182 in F. No. 75-N./29), and not ri that the British Government agree to Our suggestions that a military force f Ours should be stationed near the Iraq frontiers to repel the rebels, and weha^ noted also their readiness to accept Our suggestions that strong co-operatifT should be maintained on the frontiers. Further it is noted that the Briti h Government suggest the appointment of bason officers to patrol the Koweif and Iraq frontiers and inform the authorities concerned of the movements f Our troops and those of the rebels. To thank the British Government for this Paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of Your Excellency’s letter call for i attention. P lal As to paragraph 4, We have not the least desire to cross the frontiers f Iraq or Koweit. We asked for this and suggested it only as a precaution 0 measure to wffiieh We may have recourse in the case of absolute necessity if the forces of Koweit or Iraq are unable to prevent the rebels takino- mf o in Koweit or Iraq territories wffiile we are in pursuit of them. Then in 3 such ^ case, that is, if W’e pursue the rebels and they crossed the frontiers of Kowe't, or Iraq and the forces of Koweit or Iraq did not prevent them entering do the British Government expect ? Are We to retire and leave the rebels safe in the territories of Koweit so that they may come back and create troubk again, or what do the British Government think We should do in circumstances ? As to paragraph 5, it is obviously clear that the British Government have been informed of the news which We received that the rebels intend when We close in on them, to spread about among the Arabs of Koweit and Iran. We note that the British Government advise that effective measures should he taken by Us to prevent the rebels from reaching Koweit or Iraq in order that the local military authority may not be embarrassed. We wish the British Government could have explained how We are to prevent he rebels entering the territories of Koweit and Iraq while the Government 0 Koweit takes no measures to prevent them from doing so, and thevTre stri watering in Koweit territory quite safe from any aggrlssion. 7 How can We prevent them doing this when Our forces arp w u re 0 b°er ate ^ territ ° rieS which are c &lt;™idercd as an ideal shetr“ aud af We hive actaally ’Vi'/’T ' 1 ^ attacking the en^hT'tt following: u ue ta^en, ^ ^ therefore suggest the (gj e suggest tnat the Government nf TCrvn u u j a • subi efs tn eminent of Ji owei t should ord r their front of 1 hem to nmt^f P01n ^ e m F c ^^ on w ith a force placed in any lik ly zone of bat?! } 0Ca bty should be far from inform Us of the nn 'f 6 * J T ^ owe ^ Government should then ment of KoweitT s^mulc^alsn le ^ ioi \ and 'bf'y (the Govern- think that the Air v S i° b a ? e an adequate force (We do not i KoweitTn o lde r t n rZ7 suffici ^t) on the borders of there.

We further undertake not to leave a single soldier in those countries immediately Our pursuit of the criminals has come to an end. In which case the rebels will be totally anni hilated by the Grace and Power of God. This is in Our opinion the only solution of the problem and the only way of exterminating the rebels. It is indeed impossible for IJs to retire after the trouble We have taken and the great expenses W^e have incurred and the extensive efforts We have made before crushing the last remnant of the rebels by the Power of God. If the British Government do not agree to either of the above suggestions We will be very sorry for the situation that may consequently arise. We wish to assure the British Government that it is not easy for Us to see a section of Our subjects suffering the bitterness of such punishment at Our own hands. Their sufferings and those of their women and children break Our heart. There was in the beginning no reason for Us to punish them beyond the fact that they violated Our assurance given to the British Government by attacking the subjects of Iraq and Koweit. So We found the only w;ay to safeguard Our pled on was to punish them most severely so that they might know the result of their faithlessness and treachery. If the neighbouring countries do not wish to help Us in w r hat We have undertake in order to ensure their safety and that of their subjects We on Our part do not desire Our sections to result in a clash between Our forces—particularly as We are commanding them in nerson—and those of the British Government. This is a situation which We are trying to avoid and which, please God, cannot occur. Under these circumstances the only course open to Us would be to abandon pot only the punitive measures We have undertaken, but also a plan whereby Our internal security may be ensured. In that case We shall m no way be responsible for any aggression against the neighbouring countries Thus We sha 1 be justified in Our ov n eyes and in the eyes of the whole world because W e will have fought a^ai. st Our own people for the sake of Our neighbours while Our neighbours will have sheltered their own deadly enemies and helped them agmnst Us. We are now going to continue Our journey, and if either of the suggestions We have made is carried out, in the neighbouring country, well and good ; other wise We regret that We shall have to adopt the last mentioned attitude and We Thall bear no further responsibility or take any measures to prevent any attack that may be made against the neighbouring countries. The responsibility will then be on Our neighbours and not on Us. We be 01 you to have this communicated to the British Government as soon as possible. We have written in this sense to the Resident in the Persian Gulf so that he will inform the British Government accordingly.

ELEGRAM P., from THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES, LONDON, 1929 HE olitical Resident, Bushire, dated the 12th December (Repeated to High Commissioner, Baghdad, No. 395, Political Agent, Koweit, and British Agent, Jeddah, No. 142 ) extends for a de^th^of^aboubl^m^ 6 ^ / r0nt , 1 ® r zone which is being cleared the Koweit-Neid frontier to Hip n 11 ^ a i° ng the wJlole len gth oi the direction of b.- .*** “•' dt regards the remainder of the frontier zone His Majesty’s Government realise the impracticability of the complete evacuation of any area on which the economic life of Kuwait depends, but you will have seen from Foreign Office tele gram to Jeddah, No. l34 of 30th November (Serial No 8 ), that Ibn Saud has been informed definitely and categorically that instructions have been given for the removal of all Kuwaiti tribes from the vicinity of the frontier. The fact that the frontier area East of the North-Western corner of the neutral zone (approximately half that total frontier and including the important wells of Subeihiya) has not been cleared is inconsistent with the formal assurance which has been given and to which it is essential for the sake of our good name to adhere if possible. Otherwise the effect may be embarrassing on our relations with Ibn Saud. If it is quite impossible to implement the assurance a further explanation will have to be sent to Ibn Saud without delay in the hope of forestalling possible accusation of bad faith on the part of His Majesty’s Gov ernment, which it would in the circumstances be hard to counter. Please therefore telegraph immediately full particulars of the position in the uncleared area and especially whether isolated shepherds and woodcutters only or the entire population have been allowed to remain in it. If the latter, every effort should be made part ally to implement the assurance given to Ibn Saud by the removal of all elements not essential to the economic life of Kuwait to a distance of at least 10 miles from the frontier. As regards the Awazim no further communication will be addressed to Ibn Saud until the reply of the Awazim to the ultimatum reported in your telegram of 8 th December is known : but the situation is delicate and any development should be immediately reported by telegram. It is important moreover that there should be no misunderstanding as to the question of the allegiance of the Awazim. His Majesty’s Government have hitherto only approved of the grant to them by the Sheikh of temporary shelter (see my telegram of 1 st November repeated to Baghdad as No. 340). If the Sheikh shows any disposition to regard the present admission of the Awazim as constituting permanent transfer to him of their allegiance (see your telegram No. 54 of 31st October), further consideration will he necessary since the Foreign Office doubt the legitimacy and expediency * of such transfer of allegiance in the present circumstances. Please ascertain and report what is the situation. In the meantime you should make sure that nothing is done to prejudice the position. The foregoing refers to your telegram No. T .-8 of 3 rd December (Serial No. 172 in File No. 75-N./29) and my telegram of 7th December repeated to Baghdad as No. 391. E&lt; clo. 2.

The assumption in the first paragraph of your telegram is correct. In this connection please see my telegram No. T.-40 of 11th December. I will report when evacuation is completed. As regards remainder I fear there has been misapprehension and regret if my telegram No. T .-8 (Serial No. 172 in File No. 75-N./29) was not sufficiently explicit. In this area there are no settlements at all except along the Coast and all tribal elements have been removed from it. The inhabitants of Koweit town however own considerable number of sheep and camels and the inhabi tants of the Tillages on the coast also own camels.

To denv ' he use of the wells at Subaihiyah and Tawil would force them backon Kuwait and gravely affect its economic life. I respectfully submit that such isolated individuals cannot be included in the term Kuwait tribes nor can their presence be regarded as breach of undertaking given by Hi, Majesty’s Government. m U j-xe ti I will submit report later regarding the Awazim. The difficulty will be automatically solved if they do not enter Koweit territory. ( 18 ) Endorsement from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, NO. P.S.-ll, DATED THE 15tH DECEMBER 1929.

Despatch from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Colonial Office, No. P.S.-9, dated the 15th December 1929. 1 1 have the honour to report that I have recently concluded a three days visit to Kuwait, during which I had a long conversation with the Shaikh. 2. His Excellency began by asking me if he could speak out frankly, and I assured him that such frankness would not be taken amiss. I hough the Shaikh in the course of this conversation stated little that was new y , and much that was ancient, history he did endeavour by recapitulating the events of tbe past years to place his position, difficultips and grievances against Pin Saud before me in their proper perspective, and at the risk of taxing Your Lord ship’s patience I would venture to recapitulate briefly what he said, as it brings out clearly the grave difficulties under which the Ruler of Kuwait has laboured for the past 7 or 8 years, and which would seem to be deserving of sympathetic consideration on tne part of His Majesty’s Government. The story which follows was simply told : Shaikh Ahmad, though not a strong man, is, I should say, a straight forward one, and many of the facts stated were corroborated by Colonel Dickson. They represent however of course the Koweit point of view. 3. Shaikh Ahmad began by recalling that 20 years ago Bin Saud was a refugee in Kuwait and that he and Bin Saud played as children together. The great Mubarak then ruled in Kuwait and it was with his aid and that of the Koweit tubes of Ajman and Mutair that Bin Saud was enabled to take possession of Nejd. 4. In the first instance Bin Saud sallied forth with only a few followers u ly ns fortunes against! Bin Rashid, but could make no progress, so S a ikh Mubarak sent out the Mutair and Ajman to assist him. A battle took place at Sanf and resulted m the defeat of Bin Saud and the Kuwait forces, who suffered some 700 casualties and 4 members of the Shaikh’s family lost their LmU i p . s , cc i uen tly, however, dissensions appear to have arisen among Bm Rashid s tribes and taking advantage of these Bin Saud was enabled to fakepossession of Nejd, but his position was weak and he appealed to Mubarak for assistance against his rival Bin Rashid. The Mu (air however refused to march and Mubarak attacked them in person with the Ajman, inflicted a salutary lesson upon them and ordered them back to Jahra. Having regained control Mubarak ordered both the Ajman and the Mutair to march to Bin Sand’s aid and a battle occurred at Jarab between Bin Saud’s forces and those of Bin Rashid. At this battle the Ajman and Bin Saud’s c Hatari ’ forces were on the left and the Mutair on the right. Bin Saud’s left wing was broken owing, according to Bin Sand, to treachery on the part of the Ajman, but the situation wns saved to some extent by the Mutair on the right. On the whole however the honours were with Bin Rashid and Bin Saud was compelled to retire to Nejd. It was at this battle that Captain Shakespaie was killed. 5 . The Ajman in company wdth some of Bin Saud’s other tribes then went off to Central Hasa and Bin Saud again appealed to Mubarak for assistance. As usual Mubarak responded, and sent the Mutair under his own sons to attack them, sending word at the same time to Bin Saud to join forces with them. The latter, however, while the Kuwait forces were waiting for him marched to the South of the Ajman and offered them peace under the most binding oath, the oath of God. They accepted, but directly they had done so Bin Saud attacked them in the night: he was however utterly defeated : his brother was killed, he himself was hit in the leg, and compelled to flee to Hoffuf. It was some days hofore the Kuwait forces heard what had happened : when they did so they retired to Kuwait, w r here a family council was held. Mubarak was so disgusted at Bin Saud’s act of perfidy that he was for leaving him to his fate : Jabir and Salim however were for continuing to belt) him and finally a small force of 400 horsemen under Jabir and Ahmad, the present Shaikh, were despatched to Hoffuf. There they found ^ Bin Saud besieo-ed in two small forts, the town itself being in the hands of tne Ajman. The &amp; small Kuwait force could obviously not overcome the Ajman but ior 70 days they carried on a guerilla warfare against them, being joined, but only just towards the end, by the Beni Hajir, one of Bin Saud s tribes, while Bi/ Saud himself lay inactive and made no sorties. Ihe Kuwait forces however inflicted numerous casualties on the Ajman, and the latter, wearied of the o* a me finally withdrew to Ritha near Jubail. Bin Saud and the Kuwait forces 'followed them up and were preparing to attack when orders were received from Mubarak to cease operations as the Ajman had ten ^ ied submission to him ; peace was concluded and Mubarak ordered the Ajman Wk to Safwan, while Bin Saud returned to Nejd, Jabir and Ahmad to Kuwait. While en route for Kuwait news was received of Mubarak s death, and Jabir reigned in his stead. 6 It was now that Bin Saud began to preach the extreme tenets of w w,i ■ and the Ikhwan movement really started, and Dawish announced S erttou of io ning t aud went off with the Mutair Jabir however only reigned forgone year and died of plague : no part.cular xncxdent occurred between Kuwait and Nejd during this period. 7 Tahir was succeeded by Salim : that much of the present friction between 7 , V.+lTfrnm this neriod cannot be denied. Salim was stupid Kuwait and Nejd dates trom this penoa ca^ ^ ^ and the Awazim and obstinate an' w 011 M u tair The defection of his tribes was a sore point soon after followed the Mutaiu ineaei ct growing power with Salim and he showed 1 d tle , t . a n 0t r “, hls 11 “ ea t 1 “ o t he walls of Kuwait. Two of Nejd while Bin Saud claime ^ P gaUm was de f eat ed by battles occurred : one at , ^ here Salim beat off Dawish’s attack. Dawish himself, and /“^^llf^dsho^d P™ceed on a mission to Knally.it was arranged th tS of outstan ding matters. While Nejd with a view to e h ec ^ » q r . , death. Shaikh Ahmad was welcomed en route news was rece.ved &gt;- eon atulated him 0 n his accession, and it ^VSy^ttt “s ^14 8. For some months all went well, trade flourished and tribes j tr\ offonV n.nrl ShsiilrVi peace. Bin Saud every assistance l proceeded to attack Hail and Shaikh Ahmad render^ 'u- al everva^— possible, sending him Ks. 1,60,000 in cash and 3 000 cam'! loads of supplies, and finally Bin Saud was victorious and his power fipj] established. 9. Soon after this Bin Saud wrote to Shaikh Ahmad and said that he in need of funds and raised the question of custom duties, and demanded thaT* fixed sum should be paid to him annually by Kuwait. As in Arab eyes tl ,a would have been regarded as a tribute Shaikh Ahmad refused to pay a fix!? sum, but recalled 'the assistance he had rendered Bin Saud in the past S renewed his assurances that if Bin Saud was at any time i: would again assist him by any means in his power. Bin Saud uc that he should have his own officials in the Kuwait customs house similar vpncrmo Shaikh Ahmarl rpfnspfl ho ao-rftPi ».nrl t pro ic rvr. would again assist him by any means in his power. Bin Saud then demand d that he should have his own officials in the Kuwait customs house, but f similar reasons Shaikh Ahmad refused to agree, and t: ere is no doubt that h°d he agreed he would have lost his position as an independent ruler in the pvo e his own people. 10. It was then, 7 years ago, that Bin Saud declared a blockade asm Kuwait, and for 7 years this small State has been subject to constant raids 'f trade has been in great measure destroyed, and its economic life seriously i 1 S fered with. Its customs revenue, which was formerly about 8 lakhs a v ^ has fallen to about lakhs. Trade is stagnant, and were it not for the w ^ industry Kuwrnit town would have been reduced to a village and most of tT population compelled to seek their living elsewhere. The list of these ra' f was forwarded with Colonel Barrett’s despatch No. 40, dated 8th Aupw imn (F. No. 75-N./29). 0 ^ 1J ' 9 11. During this period came the Ojair conference and the grievance, of Kuwait, at the results are known. Kuwait territories were reduced in extent and the chief grazing grounds of the Mutair and Aiman transferred to Bin Saud, thus finally severing their connection with Kuwait and leavi™ this small prrncipahty defenceless. Shaikh Ahmed recalled to me how on da r yL e 7rabia X ”. retUrn ^ ^ t0 ““ “ Then “ is sti11 the sword that wins the n. ag ° came the revoU of the Mutair and Aiman against E n Ind' „ f n® St0r - m Was brewiu S the Shaikh received a letter’from 5! kln S. forhl s assistance and co-operation, but not „ nnatuta | lT ibi !; n ^f h! t hcorain S- W may not be without interest to recall briefly the ou to m oi the present revolt, as recounted by FaisaFal Dawkh fn Pninnai v /1 forced to conform to Wahabi tenets Wlilti’, 8 ’ Wh ° w ? re to be destroyed or power was checked he was comnelled &lt;n h en the expansion of the Bin Sand’s his‘jehad’and the &lt;1^ “mi d F° he r k hls Akh wan and to renounce leaders demanded that thT wr d n aS , , broken ' The Mutair and Ajman conference uncalled D^i s rand r ihn 0 Hi, be the U'^.^da Sand’s tents although he offererl H hn Hithlain at first refused to go to Bin meethimattheVemarten TW S K a t ely0noath but “id they would Bin Saud but on arrival he wa, Fb Jet ho TIf sub “q»ently agreed to meet to his women to Folve Tbn k hl°- ^ the , St ° mach and hiI bod y gira &gt; known, Dawish subsequently recovered.^ 11 g0 ° d hlS esca P e ’ and as is trade increased, shepherds and^^fk^ ■ ^ 6 revo ^ occurred the raids ceased, molested, and ships beo-an to hnno&gt; eis ^ ere enabled to wander far afield un- for Kuwait.

He realises that he is between two powerful neighbours, that 1 °^ °x lj tW * 0 Kuwait tribes that count he is defenceless and that his only hope of maintaining his independence is to rely on the Butish Govemment. lhat the Akhwan have on occasion camped in Kuwait territory and used Kuwait wells is undeniable, but that the Shaikh has co operated loyally with the Political Agent in haying them turned out as rapidly as possible with the means at his disposal is equally undeniable. It must be borne in mind that the Kuwait boundary is indistinguishable on the ground to tribesmen, and is a purely artificial one defined by no landmarks : it is doubt ful if many Europeans would confidently say exactly where it runs. The Shaikh has no forces at his disposal who are capable of turning out the Mutair or the Ajman : the only method he can employ is persuasion. On the other hand the fact that the Kuwait customs statistics show no improvement is proof that he has denied them supplies. 1 16. His Excellency stated that he had recapitulated these past events to show the relationship subsisting between him and Bin Saud and the difficulty of effecting a settlement. To the support of Mubarak and Kuwait forces did Bin Saud largely owe his original successes : at Hoffuf his life had been saved by Jabir and Ahmad with Kuwait forces When Shaikh Ahmad visited him he had promised perpetual peace with Kuwait, and at Hail the Shaikh of Kuwait had afforded him every assistance in his power. Despite all this Bin Saud would not abandon his ambition to rule up to the walls of Kuwait. It was only against Kuwait that it was proposed to impose these customs posts : there was no talk of customs posts on the Iraq frontiers though in normal times many caravans left Zobeir for Nejd, neither had Bin Saud claimed customs duty on goods imported through the Trucial Coast ports or Oman. He, Shaikh Ahmad, was ready to agree to any reasonable arrangement com patible with the maintenance of his own position as and independent ruler, but he was convinced that Bin Saud would agree to nothing unless His Majesty’s Government informed him in the plainest terms that they would not tolerate aggression into Kuwait territory. 17. His Excellency stated that for 7 years he had reported every instance of aggression to the Political Agent, but as far as he was aware no representa tions had been made on his behalf, and in no instance had any compensation or redress been obtained. He added that as long as the rebels were in the fiel 1 he had no fear of Bin Saud : he did not seem to think it probable that Bin Saud would heat them in the open field, hut he did think that within a short period terms of peace would probably be arranged. Dawish himself has stated that he was sure that he would then be ordered to raid into Kuwait territory but that to this he will never agree. And Shaikh Ahmad is convinced that as soon as Bin Saud has come to terms with the Mutair and Ajman he will renew the blockade of Kuwait and the raids into Kuwait territory. He was most grateful for the assurances that he had received that in the event of his co-operating loyally with the British authorities His Majesty’s Government would endeavour to effect an honourable settlement with Bin Saud; he thought however that past history showed that there was little prospect of Bin Saud aoreeing to any reasonable arrangement, and that on one pretext or another he would reject all proposals put before him, except under the strongest pressure. He hoped however that, if his forebodings came true, His Majesty’s Government would, in view of his defenceless condition, take such measures as mio’ht be possible to protect not merely the town but also the territories of his 3 principality and the property of his subjects, and also to obtain redress for the past. 18. I would emphasise that Shaikh Ahmad spoke in no carping or complainino* spirit: he is certainly an attractive personality, an Arab of the desert rather than of the Gulf type, and as he himself stated several times has spent most of his life among the Bedouin. He realises fully that since the defection of the Mutair and Ajman he owes his existence as an independent ruler entirely to the British Government. I promised him however that I— 16 would report what he had told me and I have therefore repeated the converas tion at tength since it would seem desirable that when endeavours are made O effect a settlement His Majesty’s Government should be m possession of his past relations with Bin Sand so that they may appreciate the difficulty . that will have to be overcome. It would not seem to be a question of arrivin. » at working arrangements regarding customs duties or similar matters (these nresent little difficulty given some measure of good will on both sides) but, an fond, one of curbing the ambitions of a powerful ruier.

In these circumstances it appeared to be entirely in interest* of Ibn Baud that the Awazim should be definitely neutralised by admission into Koweit territory. . . , ^3) The expulsion of the Awazim m aceoraance with Ibn Sauds request could only be effected by the use of force, and it ls &gt; °ut of the question to con- temnlate such a breach of the obligations which the Sheikh of Koweit assumed when he gave the Awazim permission to escape from the rebels by taking refuse in his territory.

My telegram No. 173 (Serial No. 207 in Pile No. 75-N./29,) Following is gist of note dated November 23rd received from the King Beferring to my communication to Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, presumably of November 6ih, ha adverts to the persistent raids by Arabs of Trans-Jordania. They now attack as far south as the region of Hail. If matters continue thus the people of Nejd will be compelled to take action themselves. This would not be in the interest of either country. He has suggested that the British Government should terminate the sit ration but no effective reply has been received. Now lest the matter should become serious he proposes the following alternative solutions :— The British Government shall themselves arbitrate the question of looted property so that tl.e rights and obligations may be defined, ihe British Gov ernment shall execute their decision as regards Trans-Jordania and notify him of it for execution in his own territory. It is important though that such decision should be immediate ard effective. Drastic and effective measures should then be taken by the British Government to prevent attacks. This world mean exemplary punishment of the offenders and immediate return of the looted property. 2. If this proposal is impracticable he suggests that Bedouins of either sale be left free to settle matters themselves, towns remaining neutral. This alternative is fraught with dangers and is suggested only because Trans* Jordanian Government has so far been unable to prevent its subjects attacking his people. 1 xu m ls T a0 1 sol ^ tel y certain that Arabs of Beni Sakhr and Howeitat ° ^^-^crdaman tribes have no desire to fight or annoy him and if t were lett to themselves they would not dare to attack.

I learned with some apprehension from your telegram under reference that Awazim are in the neutral zone at present and that no attempt apparently contemplated to move them into Koweit. I regard their presence in neutral zone as in con sistent with the assurances which have been given to Ibn Saud and as most undesirable in itself. It will tend to confirm Ibn Saud’s belief that rebels intend to use the Awazim as an agency for obtaining supplies from Koweit [vide Jeddah telegram No. 170 (Serial No. 204 ibib\, and, should they be defeated, to escape by mingling with Arabs in neighbouring territories. Moreover, Awazim’s present position would provide Ibn Saud vith an incen tive for taking his forces into the neutral zone. You should at once arrange with Shaikh of Koweit unless it is impracti cable for removal of Awazim from the neutral zone and for their concentra tion in some region in Koweit at a distaucefrom the frontier or possible scene of conflict.

This will very likely occur in the case of the Towaiha, a part of Howeitat, who are reported to have Wahabite sympathies. One of the best methods of pre venting raiding by our Trans-Jordan tribes would be for Ibn Saud to cause restitution to be made of property looted by his tribes during last two years.

With reference to my despatch No. 226 of S( ptember 9th (On F. 75-N./29) enclosing a copy of a Note which, in pursuance of the instructions contained in your despatch No. 169 (E *4115-3-91) of August 22nd last, I had addressed to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding raids carried out by Nejdi subjects against shepherds and tribesmen of Iraq between July 1, 1928, and May 31, 1929, I now have the honour to enclose copy of a Note, dated the 31st ultimo addressed to me by Sheikh Fuad in reply. 2. It will be seen that Sheikh Fuad refuses to take cognizance of the raids, numbered 1, 2, 5 and 8 on the list communicated to him. These were raids by Nejdi subjects against the Dahamashah tribe, wLose allegiance, as you are aware, has long formed the subject of dispute between Ibn Saud and the Government of Iraq. For the history of the dispute T have the honour to refer you to the Appendix to the enclosure in a despatch addressed by Hia Majesty’s High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on April 14th, 1928, of which a copy was sent to this Agency in Foreign Office despatch No. 91 of May 5th, 1928, 3. In the conversation which I had with Sheikh Fuad, to which he refers at the beginning of his Note, he claimed then, as he claims now, that some of the tribes against which raids have been undertaken by Nejdi subjects are themselves Nejdi also. He did not at the time show any inclination to discuss the question of liability or to congest it on the grounds which you mention22 your despatch No. 169. I did not therefore have occasion or conside initiative the points ’ ' r ^ opportune at that stage to raise of my own initiative ine points which are treated in paragraphs 4 and 5 of your despitch and m the despatch addressed hv the late Hi^h Commissioner for Iraq to the Colonial Office on June ifth and to explain the views of His Majesty’s Government as authorised to do in paragraph 8 of your despatch. 4.

Enelo. to Serial No. 27- Note by the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs* Hedjaz, to the British Agent, Jeddah, No. 23/4/9, dated the 31st October 1929. With reference to Your Excellency’s letter No. 1865-33-212 of September 9th last (in E. 75-N/29) and to my conveisation with you on 11/4/1348 (15th September 1929) regarding the claims of Iraq tribes from the tribes of Neid, and the request for the formation of the Court prescribed in Article 2 of the Bahra Agreement [Enclo. to Serial No. 147 t in File No. 149(1?)-$./ 24-25], I have the honour to confirm to Your Excellency the statement which I made to you verbally in the course of the conversation, namely that the Hejaz Government cannot take any cognizance whatever of the raids men tioned in the list enclosed in Your Excellency’s letter under Numbers 1, 2, 5 and 8, as they consider that these raids took place between their subjects and it is on y their right to decide about them. 2. As regards the raid memioned in the said list under No 7, the raiders as far as I can see, were under the leadership of an individual belonging to Iraq, and therefore the correctness of the claim of the Iraq Government against the Hejaz Government in connexion therewith is a matter for argu ment. 3. No doubt there exist claims of Nejdian subjects against Iraq tribes and the competent authorities are engaged in preparing the necessary lists, which I shall send to Your Excellency, on their completion, for communication to the Iraq Government.

Letter from the British Agent, Jedda, to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Transjordan, No. 2133/246/24, dated the 9th October 1929. In continuation of my letter No. 1441/246/22 of July 23rd last, relative to the question of the traffic in arms between Transjordan and Nejd, I have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a further Note on this subject which I have received from the Acting Minister for Eoreign Affairs to the Hejaz Government. 2. As foreshadowed in paragraph 3 of my letter under reference, Sheikh Euad Hamza claims that the Ottoman Penal Code cannot be made applicable to the transit trade either in arms or in any other kind of merchandise between Syria and Nejd, but that the provisions regarding the freedom of passage of merchandise such as are embodied in Article 13 of the Hadda Agreement over-ride any regulations contained in that code. 3. The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs concludes by requesting that the arms confiscated from Abdulla er Rashudi in January last, the seizure of which formed the subject of your telegram No. 21 of May 14th last, may be restored to their owner. 4. A copy of this letter and of its enclosure is being forwarded to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Annexure. Note from the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hejaz Gov- ernment, to the British Agent, Jeddah, No. 23/1/3, dated the 8ih October 1929. Your Excellency is aware that numerous communications have passed between me and the British Agency, arising out of the action of the authorities in Transjordan in seizing a quantity of arms and ammunition which a Nejdi caravan was said to be smuggling in the first half of Rajah 1347 (December 1928). The last Note on the subject was Mr. Jakins’letter No. 897/246/5 of June 6th, 1929 (27-12-1347), but an opportunity presented itself to me on July 21st last (14-2-1348) of discussing this subject with Your Excellency when I explained to you the views of the Hejaz Government thereon. 2. It is clear that the Ottoman Penal Code which is the code now in force in Transjordan, cannot be made applicable except to acts committed, in Trans jordan. Trading in arms within Transjordan territory may be subject to its provisions, but the transport of arms or of any other merchandise between Syria and JSejd naturally cannot be made subject to the provisions of this law, but are subject to Article 13 of the Hadda Agreement. 3. If the Transjordan Government are desirous of applying the provisions of this law, as stated in the official notice mentioned to me by Mr. Jakins in his letter No. 770/7,55/5 of May 27th last and published last January, they have full right to do so, on condition that they comply with the two basic principles which follow (a) the exemption of Nejdi commercial caravans the members of which carry the arms necessary for their self defence, (b) the exemption of the transit trade between Syria and Nejd, of whatever kind. that is to say, its territory, the Transjordan Government can prevent trading in arms .within but if it opposes such trading in transit between Syria andNeid this cannot be accepted, since it is contrary to Article 13 of the HadJ a q k A vp Tn anv case, the Transiordan ISTpid this cannot uo ^ — tuc i Agreement referred to above. In any case tiie Transjordan Government ha's ihe right to control this trade m so fai as is laid down in Article ]:; above, and not otherwise. e, anu uuu • 4 This beim? so, the Transjordan Government have no right to confiscates anv goods which may be carried from Syria to Tsejd of whatever kind they f may be and the Hejaz Government requests the restitution of the rifles be- longing to Abdulla er Rashudi and taken from him m Transjordan contrary to the Hadda Agreement.

Enclosure. l\OTE FROM THE BRITISH AGENCY, JeDDA, TO HlS MAJESTY THE KlN&amp; OF THE HeJAZ, NejD AND ITS DEPENDENCES, No. 2468/1164/95, DATED THE 14th November 1929. 11 ^ ^ •! 1 ? nou jJ :o ^ Grm your Majesty that some days ago His Ex- cellency the Sheikh of Koweit received a massage from Feisal ed Doweish in which he formulated the following three requests. (1) He begged to be assured by His Majesty’s Government that they would not permit the tribes of Iraq or Koweit to molest the amihes of the Mutair and Aj man w T hom he was leaving behind m their present camping ground South of the Koweit border He enquired whether His Majesty’s Government would allow his women o cross the Koweit border and to take refuge at Jahrah absent^ ^ ere ra ^ e d by Your Majesty’s bedouin while he was ( 2 )(3) He wished to be informed whether he would be held responsible by His Majesty’s Government if he shot down the aircraft which he was aware had been sold to Your Majesty by the British Government, or if they were captured by Mm. 2. The Sheikh of Koweit informed Feisal ed Doweish on November 8th that his questions had been communicated to His Majesty’s Government who had replied to the following effect: — His Majesty’s Government did not feel called upon to indicate the attitude which they would adopt in the circumstances referred to by him, but, as regards his second point, the assurance from His Majesty’s Government precluded the grant of refuge to his women in Koweit or Iraq. As regards his third point His Majesty’s Government would take a very serious view of failure on his part to treat with full consideration any British personnel that might fall into his hands. 3. His Majesty’s Government furthermore expressed the desire that in com municating the above it should be made clear that they were not prepared to enter into any further discussions with Jfeisal ed Doweish who should be warned that if he himself or any of his emissa ies crossed the Koweit frontier again they would be liable to arrest or any other action that might be con sidered necessary. I am instructed, in bringing the foregoing to the knowledge of Your Majesty to emphasize once again the points to which I had the honour to draw Your Majesty’s attention in paragraph 5 of my note No. 2184/1464/61, of October 16th last (13*5. 1348), since His Majesty’s Government clearly cannot guarantee that it would in all circumstances be possible for them to prevent women and children from crossing into Koweit or Iraq territory.

Conclusive information having been received that camels belonging to the rebels were being watered at Subaihiyah and Tawil, a sharp warning was sent by His Majesty’s Political Agent to the camp of Feisal ed Doweish through Hilal el Mutairi on November 5th to the effect that unless the practice ceased immediately he would have the camels bombed. His Excellency the Sheikh of Koweit was also requested to issue a similar warning and to post a guard on the wells in question to prevent a recurrence of the incident. 3. Hilal el Mutairi delivered the message and returned some days later with the following report: — (1) Feisal ed Doweish promised to stop the practice complained of. (2) He had news that His Majesty the King had, at any rate for the present, satisfactorily dealt with the Afaibah. (3) He was moving on November 11th with the whole rebel force except the Ajman to Wabra Safa and perhaps the liafar area. (4) From there his first attack would be on Ajibba and the Kind’s forces theie. 4.

Following from Kuwait begins : On December lltli Sheikh of Kuwait and I each received official letter from Hafiz Wahba regarding your message sent to Awazim on 9th. The letter addressed to Sheikh contained a court demand to be told the nature of the message and also a request to be apprised of any communication whatsoever that might take place between Sheikh and subjects of Nejd. The letter to me asked if I was aware of nature of the message and pointed out that for the Sheikh to interfere in the affairs of Nejd subjects is highly undesirable.32 On the same day Sheikh called On me and made an official protest 0 in«t the obvious consular activities of Hafiz Wahba He suggested hi, against tee odyi ^ the Treat y I advised him to take Eh S^Govemment’s advice first. I think Hafiz Wahba’s action calls for a nrotest and I should be grateful for ordeis on the subject Hafiz Wahha * called on December 12th and raised the question I explained the policy aud orders of His Majesty’s Government verbally but said nothing of his objection, able communications. Ends. , . „ While giving no information regarding the movements of Bin Sand or rebel forces Hafiz Wahba is assuming the role of Consular Officer and he recently addressed the Sheikh ou the subject of two slaves sa d to have escaped from Nejd territory and also regarding some camels which are said to have been stolen. • . I am instructing Political Agent that the Sheikh should take no action against Hafiz Wahba hut trust that now that we have definite grounds of complaint it will be possible to protest. fn Sccretarv of State for Colonies, repeated to Jeddah. (43) (Received on 4th January 1930, with Political Secretary s letter No. 51, dated the 19th December 1929.) Telegram from the High Commissioner of Iraq, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, No. 445, bated the IGth December 1929. Eepeated to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, Koweit, Jerusalem and Jeddah, No. 345.) Information was received on 12th December that Paisal r.l Hawish and a considerable portion of his following with flocks were moving up Batin towards Itiqau south of the eastern extremity of Iraq-Nejd neutral zone. Aerial reconnaissances have confirmed the presence of numerous tents and camels in that area. On 13th December Glubb when reconnoitring near Shaih al Auja with police car(s) was approached by two horsemen, one of whom was said to be relative of Dawish. They said Dawish himself was close by and wished to speak to him ; also that rebel leader with Ibn Mashhur and Bufidi with Mutair and Ajman tiibesmen were all camping together in the neighbourhood. Glubb refused to see Dawish. Glubb has since received letter from Dawish professing friendship and readiness to obey Government orders and requesting interview. He is await ing at Riqai for reply. Iraq Government have instructed Glubb not to meet or communicate with Dawish or any other rebel but to give out that any attempt by rebels to cross Iraq frontier will he prevented. As additional precaution two sections of Royal xVir Force armoured cars have been moved down Batin to Adhaibah and are carryinsr out reconnaissance to the frontier. 9 (44) (Received on 4th January 1930, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 51, the 19th December 1929.)

(Repeated to Baghdad, Jeddah and Koweit.) Assumption in the first paragraph of your telegram of 12th December (No. 395 to Baghdad) (Serial No. 35) is correct. In this connection see my telegram of 11th December, T.-40 I will report when evacuation complete. As regards the remainder I am afraid there has been a misapprehension and regret if my telegram No. T.-8 was not sufficiently explicit. There are no settlements at all in this area except along the coast and all tribal elements have been removed from it. Inhabitants of Koweit town however own a large number of sheep and some camels and the inhabitants of the villages along the coast also own camels. They send these out to graze in the zone in question in charge of shepherds and at this time of the year when the sheep are only watered every four days and the camels once a week they wander over considerable areas in search of pasture. Moreover wood-cutters go out to collect brush wood for sale in the(?) towns(?). Only these individuals are per mitted in this zone and Political Agent reports that now the tribal elements have been removed the whole area is practically deserted except for them. To deny them the use of wells at Tawil and Subaihiyeh would force them back on Koweit and would seriously affect economic life. I respectfully submit that these isolated idividuals cannot be included in the term Koweit tribes nor can their presence be held to constitute a breach of the undertaking given to Ibn Saud by His Majesty’s Government. I will submit report regarding Awazim later. Difficulty will automati cally be solved if they do not enter Koweit territory.

According to reports terms offered to the rebels by Bin Saud include return of loot taken from Nejd tribes but do not mention loot taken from Iraqi tribes. I suggest that in view of the assistance rendered him by His Majesty’s Government and Iraq Government His Majesty’s Government should press Bin Saud strongly to ensure that loot taken from Iraqi tribes is returned. Iraq Government themselves are debarred from bargaining with Dawish for return of loot in exchange for asylum in Iraq territory by their previous undertaking which was given at the instance of His Majesty’s Government and it seems to me that we might well volunteer to assist them in this way.

Telegram R., from Foreign Office, London, to His Majesty’s Charge d’affaires, Jeddah, No. 149, dated the 20th December 1929. (Repeated Jerusalem,) Following is message referred to in my immediately preceding telegram (Serial No. 56). Begins. His Majesty’s Government have been informed by the British Agent at Jeddah of Your Majesty’s note of November 23rd regarding the Transjordan situation which has long been engaging their earnest attention. Your Majesty suggests three possible solutions of the problem of raiding and counter-raiding. Of these His Majesty’s Government regret that for reasons of general policy which Your Majesty will readily understand, they cannot contemplate either the second or the third. 1 he measures which they have already taken or are in process of taking are, however, practically identical with the first solution advocated in Your Majesty’s note. In view of Your Majesty’s acceptance of the suggestion put forward Mr. Bond’s note of July 13th for the appointment of a British investigator to deal with the question of the restitution of loot, and of the recent un conditional acceptance of that proposal by His Highness the Amir of Transjordan, they are proceeding {forthwith to the selection of a suitable officer for this purpose who will be instructed to proceed to the affected area at the earliest possible moment. On the receipt of his report His Majesty’s Government will proceed to give their arbitral award and to take the necessary measures for their execution in Transjordan. The awari will also be communicated to Your Majesty without delay for similar action in Your Majesty’s territories. As regards the measures to be taken to prevent attacks and to punish offenders, pumtive action has within the last few months been taken in a large number of cases against Transjordanian tribes convicted of having carried out raids into Nejd and the Hejaz, and in some cases loot has actually bien restored, whereas no loot has yet been returned by Your Majesty’s tribesmen. The measures taken in the case of Transjordanian tribes have, however, been rendered exceedingly difficult by the fact that no corresponding measures have apparently been taken against Hejazi and Nejdian tribes who have been guilty of raids against Transjordan on a more extensive scale. In view, however, of the increasingly unsatisfactory situation as regards raids both from Transjordan and bom Your Majesty’s Dominions, His Majesty’s Government are now reconsidering the whole problem in con sultation with the High Commissioner for Transjordan.

U Ti-oreien Otfice have strongly represented that continuance of present un- satisfactory situation must react unfavourably on general relations between His Maiesty’s Government and Ibn baud, an Urge y vitiate measures al- 1 ready taken in other directions to improve such relations.

Jordan involves military forces m emergency work outside their p roper sphere, and leads eventually to counter-raiding, which is most d^cnlt to deal with in area where, owing to absence of adequate admimstrat.on, htelli. gence is necessarily inadequate. I shall be glad if you will reconsider, in consultation with Air Officer Commanding, the whole situation in Eastern Transjordan, in light of above, and report as soon as possible whether existing and contemplated arrange ments, as authorised in my despatch of September 6 th, are in your opinion still sufficiently comprehensive to remedy a situation ot increasing gravity or do you consider new measures necessary ?

Following is text referred to in my immediately preceding telegram :— His Majesty’s-Government learn from Political Resident, Bushire, that Your Majesty has, in a recent letter to him, made a further protest against the action of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the Awazim tribe. They cannot but believe that this protest is based upon a misapprehension which the following explanation will remove. In reply to Your Majesty’s letter of 17th November, in which anxiety was expressed lest Your Majesty’s rebellious subjects when pressed should escape by mixing with tribes in adjacent countries, and m which request was made that these tribes should be removed from the vicinity of the frontier His Majesty’s Representative informed Your Majesty that measures would be taken to this end. Being under the impression that the Awazim had already entered or were about to enter Kuwait m order to seek sanctuary His Majesty’s Government gave instructions that they as well as the Kuwait tribes should be ordered to move into the interior of Kuwait. Subsequently however His Majesty’s Government learnt that the Awazim had not availed themselves of the permission given to move into Kuwait territory but remained in the neutral area. On receipt of this information, in order that the doubtful position of the AwaznH might be cleared up and the assurances given to Your Majesty regarding the clearing r frontier zone fully implemented, instructions were given that a message should be sent to the Awazim to the effect that they must e; dher move It once into the interior of Kuwait or alternatively they would be treated as part of the contending forces. PTis Maiestv’s Government now learn that they have not entered Kuwait and 3 inJtructions have therefore been given for denial to them of all supplies from Kuwait and for use of force, if necessary, to expel them should they cross the frontier.

As regards the action proposed by the High Commissioner for Iraq (1) vis a vis Ibn Mashur and (2) vis a vis the rebels, (1) apprently contem plates allowing Mashur to proceed to Syria without providing for his actions against this country. I do not consider, in view of the spirit of the assu rances given, that such action could be successfully defended on technical grounds before public opinion in Arabia or that it would be interpreted otherwise than as granting refuge. As regards (2) I am firmly convinced that King and Government will expect the rebals to be handed over unconditionally and that in this respect the assurances given would be considered to override any argument based on the absence of an extradition treaty. Demands 4 and 5 quoted by High Commissioner are, I think, subsidiary demands referring to isolated evasion and should not be hehi to affect the main demand, number 2,* which I believe, is intended to cover any situation in which the rebels as a force may succeed in placing themselves out of reach of the King’s forces.

Following is gist of note received from Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs :— Hejaz Government have been informed that Farhan ibn Mashhur and some followers were allowed to enter Iraq territory a few days ago and are residing near Busaiyah post. Note continues as follows. “ The repeated promises made by the British Government in their own name and in the name of the Governments of Kuwait, Iraq and Trans-Jordan were to the effect that no rebel force should be allowed to cross the frontier and still they reside in the territories of those Governments. I cannot understand the reason which has led the British Government to allow Farhan ibn Mashhur and his party to take refuge in Iraq territory. Farhan ibn Mashhur is a criminal in the opinion of the British Govern ment, who have made representations about him in the past, and he is also a criminal in the opinion the Hejaz Government.” Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs therefore officially requests his extradit’on and inquires how this may best be effected. Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs is also informed to the effect that Ibn Lami has escaped to the Kuwait frontier and requests that he and his followers be either expelled or handed over to the Hejaz Government.

It will be seen fr ^ Jeddah telegram No. 174 of 27th November, repeated to you, a letter fro 01 Bin Saud, written immediately before Fuad Hamza’s communication 1 was received simultaneously, in which His Majesty asked specifically that rebels crossing the frontier should be arrested and handed over. Thoueh no specific guarantee to this effect was given by His Majesty’s Government in replying they did inform the King that instructions had been given to concert necessary Military measures for the ejection of any of the contend ing forces that might enter Kuwait or Iraq territory and for the inter cm* tion, wherever possible of isolated groups of rebels entering such territorv for the purpose of merging locally with tribes. While not committing themselves on the question of handing over, they did not qualify these as &amp; surances by any reference to Fuad Hamza’s demands. It was for these reasons that the instructions in my telegram No. 1 of January 2nd were sent to you. betsfif 8 anv!

Do you consider that if they refuse voluntarily to surrender their arms it would be possible forcibly to disarm them ? (e) Subject to any observations which you may have to offer and which they will be glad to receive as early as possible, His Majesty’s Government now propose to communicate with Ibn Saud on the lines set out above, and to invite him to state the conditions on which he would be prepared to take over the refugees from the Iraq Government, when, provided the conditions were satisfactory, arrangements for their handing over could be concerted with Bin Sand. (f) What exactly is covered by the term “ settle accounts ” in your telegram of 31st December ? Please telegraph explicit statement of action contemplated in this connection. (g) Since the foregoing paragraphs were drafted His Majesty’s Govern ment have received Jeddah telegram No. 2, repeated to you. This shows the importance of exercising the greatest care in dealing with the refugees if His Majesty’s Government are to avoid the charge of failing to imple ment the assurances given to Bin Saud. They must therefore retain corm plete freedom, except in so far as they may be already committed by the pledges referred to in paragraph (c) above to negotiate with Ibn Saud as to the disposal of the refugees.

AIDE MEMOIRE. His Majesty the King and His Government have great confidence in the friendship of the British Government and the desire of the British nation— a desire which they reciprocate—to establish relations with His Majesty’s country (the Hejaz) on really amicable and friendly basis. As a result of such mutual confidence His Majesty and the Hejaz Government have always relied on British friendship and have requested the assistance of the British Government in matters of interest to both parties ; for the sake of their friendship His Majesty the King has made considerable sacrifices in men and money. The latest action of the King in this connection is that he has declared war on certain of his subjects in Nejd, who, in the beginning, were guilty of no punishable acts against Nejd. Their only crime was committed against countries in which the friendly British Government has many interests. In accordance with the desire expressed by this friendly Government, His Majesty undertook punitive measures on a large scale, which measures are still, in part, being earn' d on. Daring the execution of the punitive measures there arose the question of the rebels taking refuge in Koweit or Iraq territory or obtaining food and supplies from there. In spite of the fact that the British Government undertook to al 1 ow the people in question neither to purchase food and supplies nor to take refuge in those territories, certain events occurred which are difficult to explain except on the grounds that Great Britain had gone back on this understanding. It is certainlv known that Ed Do wish and his followers, the Mutair, the Ajman and Ibn Mashhur, and all who take their part are criminals who committed several crimes against Iraq, Koweit and Transjordan before they committed any crime against Nejd. It is also known that the_ fundamental reason for the punitive measures which have been taken against them on such a large scale are the crimes and attacks on those countries of which they were guilty. They are therefore criminals against those countries and it is the duty of the latter to punish them very severely. But I very much regret to state that far from any such steps being taken they have acted in a way that has afforded help to the rebels It is impossible to explain this action except on the supposition that, forgetful o the P ?ebels’ past crimes, they have pardoned them for all their aggressions and desire foTome extent to help them to rebel against their own Govern ment which only undertook punitive measures against them at the desire o the neighbouring states (Iraq, Transjordan and Koweit) Feisal ed Doweish then, and the authorities in K0W Seat objection is taken to the fact that such facilities have been afforded, and that for the following three reasons m The Koweit authorities have dealt with the criminals in such a ^ way as to show that they have forgiven them.49 (2) They have overlooked the fact that the criminals are rebellW against a friendly Government and have accepted communica! tions and negotiations from them. (S) They have caused many people to believe that they are pleased with the action the rebels have taken, and are desirous of helping them in their rebellion. The mutual interest of the two countries, especially as regards the position of the Hejaz criminals necessitates real co-operation on this subject, which could be effected in the following ways (1) Strong measures should betaken to prevent food, supplies and ammunition reaching the rebels through Koweit and Iraq. (2) The rebels should not be allowed to take refuge in Koweit and Iraq territories. ( 3 ) No correspondence or negotiation should be held with the rebels. (4) any rebel entering Iraq or Koweit should be arrested, tried and punished. (5) Any rebel crossing the frontier (of Koweit or Iraq) should have his weapons confiscated, which is the usual custom enforced in international affairs. As the British Government have previously undertaken—an undertaking which has been confirmed on several occasions—to carry out the suggestion contained in the first two items (mentioned above), there is nothing further to request in this respect except that they take effective measures to stop food and ammunition being secretly supplied to the rebels. The same can be said about the third item now that the last letter addressed to His Majesty the King by the British Agent in Jedda has been received (letter No. 2468/1464/95 of 14th November 1929). I must now insist on the suggestions outlined in the fourth and fifth items being carried out and in doing so I feel entirely justified. I earnestly hope that the British Government will act accordingly and that I shall receive confirmation at the earliest possible opportunity.

After the brilliant success achieved in the punitive operations against the rebels whose intention was to create disturbances in Nejd, His Majesty the King has given orders to all the forces to proceed to the frontier regions where the remnant of the rebels have sought shelter, so that decisive measures may be taken against them. All arrangements have been made and the soldiers have actually begun their march in every appointed direction. The town soldiers have been ordered to gather at Shuka, while the Bedouin forces and their auxiliaries have been instructed to concentrate in their appointed places. The forces of the Harb left Bareida on the 16th instant and those of the Ataibah moved on the same day from Shafra to Hafr-el-Atz, while Qahtan also marched from Jefir. They will all be concentrated at Shuka whence the whole army will advance to any regions where any remnant of the rebels may remain. Further more the Emir Abdul Aziz Ibn Musaad received orders to proceed to Shaabia (presumably Shaibah) where he has been joined by the men of Shaara and Aneiza. The present plan is to encircle the rebels (from every point) and thus render their escape impossible. Two days after the mobilisation of the above-mentioned forces, His Majesty the King proceeded to General Headquarters where he gave the order to advance on November 22nd. Prior to his departure His Majesty issued a decree appointing His Highness Prince Saoud as Regent during his absence. When the rebels realised that their situation was critical and that their obedience to those who desire to fish in troubled waters would bring inevit able disaster upon them, they petitioned His Majesty the King offering to surrender. The King, however, informed them that it was impossible to pardon them until they had submitted to the arbitration of the law of God (Sharia). Thus, within a few days, the punitive operations will have been brought to a successful issue.

I do not think that it is necessary to examine in detail King Faisal’s ex planation of the movements of the individuals who, King Ibn Sand alleges, have been engaged in encouraging the Najdi rebels. The situation in Najd has changed radically since these complaints were put forward and it can no longer be of importance to investigate the truth of the motives of these men’s movements.

Correspondence was exchanged on the subject58 of this incident between His Majesty and the late Sir Gilbert Clayton, of which we enclose a copy for ready reference, so that the facts of the case may be understood. 3 and 4 ; —’Ali Abu Shuwairbat. About a year ago this individual asked for permission to go out with his family to join his tribe in Najd. As, how- ever, he !s charged with the murder of a certain relative of the Da wish he wished before going out to secure his safety from the Dawish. For this pur pose he sent out a messenger on his behalf his uncle Majid, who went over to Mail, saw its Governor Ibn Musa’id and waited there until a reply was received from the Dawish to the effect that he was still revengeful. Later on when Dawish came close to Kuwait. ’Ali Abu Shuwairibat went out to see hmi personally with a view to settling his case with him and securing hia . ' w ih. This is all what we know about this case, which is a personal affair between the two parties. 6. Rajih Ibn Shaheen and Hummud al-Khammash went out to Kuwait with a number of mares for trading purposes. They stopped at Kuwait for some time and actually sold their mares to the neighbouring tribes receiving the price in camels which they brought back to Zubair and there sold them to the butchers. 7. As regards Mr. Dickson’s having done this best to prevent Abu Shuwairibat and Ibn Hamid from executing their wishes and desires, we have no information on this subject, neither are we aware of the nature of their wishes and desires and why they were prevented from execut ing them. 8. Shukhair ibn Tuwala is residing in ’Iraq, and he has not been seen at the Palace by any one for some months. 9. The number of Najdis residing in ’Iraq is very considerable . They may be numbered by thousands among whom some are loyal to Ibn Sa’ud and some are against him. It is impossible for anyone to place them under complete control and to tie up their tongues to prevent news mongering. The habit of news mongering is common among all peoples, specially among the bedouins. Often news is corrupted or fabricated for the promotion of some personal aim. Such being the case, it is not unlikely that the enemies of Ibn Sa’ud and they are many, should have wrongfully imputed statements to His Majesty the King (of ’Iraq) and the British Government with the object of strengthening the hands of the rebels and weakening the hand of Ibn Sa’ud. Such is the information available to us in regard to the complaints of His Majesty King Ibn Sa’ud, which we relate for the information of His Excellency the President of the Council of Ministers, and from which it is clear there is no ground for complaint, and that it has only been intended to interpret the incidents that have occurred in a manner inconsistent with fact. The ’Iraq Government have so far adopted with the utmost cautiousness a policy of strict non-interference with the affairs of Nejd, and they had been and continue to be anxious to adhere to (or observe strictly) the treaties concluded between them and Nejd and to respect them to the utmost possible extent. It would appear to us that the ’Iraq has pursued this course and its desire for peace and amity with Nejd further than is demanded by treaties, having, as it has, promised to expel the Dawdsh from its territories in the event of his seeking refuge therein, and adopted stringent measures in the restriction of “ musabala ” (trade in provisions) with the rebel tribes of Nejd notwithstanding the resultant harm to the country’s trade, and has also, on numerous occasions, demonstrated a reasonably perfect attitude of neutra- litv These effective demonstrations should have left no place for doubt and suspicion in the mind of His Majesty King Ibn Sa’ud. Unfortunately however it appears that the assistance which has been accorded and continues to be accorded by ’Iraq has jiot proved sufficient to dispel these doubts.

Following is text referred to in my immediately preceding telegram (Serial No. 77.)60 His Majesty’s Government learn from the Political Resident at BusMre that Yonr Majesty has in a recent letter to him made a further protest against the action of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the Awazim tribe, they cannot hut believe that this protest is based upon a misappre hension, which the following explanation will remove. . re P 1 y Your Majesty’s letter of the 17th November, in which was expressed lest Your Majesty’s rebellious subjects when pressed should escape by mingling with the tribes in the adjacent countries and in which the request was made that these tribes should be removed from the vicinity of the frontier, His Majesty’s representative informed Your Majesty that measures would be taken to this end. Being under the impression that the Awazim had already entered or were about to enter Koweit in order to seek sanctuary, His Majesty’s Government gave instructions that they, as well as the Koweiti tribes, should be ordered to move into the interior of Koweit. Subsequently, however, His Majesty’s Government learned that the Awazim had not availed themselves of the permission given to move into Koweit territory, but remained in the neutral area. On the receipt of this information, in order that the doubtful position of the Awazim might be cleared up and the assurances given to Your Majesty regarding the clearing of the frontier zone fully implemented, instructions were given that a message should be sent to the Awazim to the effect that they must either move at once into the interior of Koweit or alternatively they would be treated as part of the contending forces. His Majesty’s Government now learn that they have not entered Koweit and that instructions have therefore been given for the denial to them of all supplies from Koweit and for the use of force if necessary to expel them should they cross the frontier.

Presence of rebels in Kuwait territory contrary to undertakings of British Government.

Proposal that Iraq police cars should be called in to assist m rounding up rebels is strongly resisted by Iraq Government not only on general grounds but on ground that Iraq-Nejd frontier would be left unprotected both against rebels and against marauders belonging to Bin Sand forces.

(Repeated High Commissioner, Baghdad, Political Resident, Bushire, Political Agent v * Kuwait, No. 8.) Following is gist of a Note dated 10th January which I have received from Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs in which he presses for a categorical answer to the demands already made for the delivery of the rebels and states that procrastination would have the most serious results. He learns that the rebels have been permitted to cross the frontier of Kuwait. This is contrary to the undertaking given that if they crossed the frontier they would be expelled by force. Their movements within the Kuwait and Iraq boundaries without action being taken against them in accordance with the assurances given has produced serious doubts as to the friendly intentions of His Majesty’s Gov ernment repeatedly expressed. He adds that the policy of laissez faire would unfavourably affect the good relations between the two countries. He requests to be informed with all frankness and at the earliest oppor tunity of the position which His Majesty’s Government are taking up. In a second note of the same date, despatched on receipt by him of the news of Dawish’s surrender, Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs requests that rebel leaders, particularly Dawish, Ibn Mashur, Ibn Lami and Ibn Hithlain should be handed over. Acceptance of their surrender is, he says, contrary to the undertakings of His Majesty’s Government. Enclo. 2.

It will be seen that only difference between attitude of Bin Saud and that of Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, as reported in Jeddah’s tele grams Nos. 7 and 8 to Foreign Office, is that Minister for Foreign Affairs is even more uncompromising. I agree that a curt reply would be salutary, but suggest that instead of draft in Jeddah telegram No. 8 the following message should be sent to Bin Saud through me repeated to Jeddah for identical communication mutatis mutandis to Minister for Foreign Affairs begins :— I have repeated to His Britannic Majesty’s Government your message communicated to me through Political Agent, Kuwait and am instructed to reply as follows :— His Britannic Majesty’s Government have never promised to hand over to Your Majesty the persons of rebel leaders. Such proceed ing, as Your Majesty is ? (aware), would be entirely contrary to all local customs and international usage. As has been already explained to Your Majesty the only reason why His Britannic Majesty’s Government found themselves unable to expel the rebel tribes was that they were accompanied by their women and child ren against whom it was impossible to take military action. &lt; Your Majesty was warned of this contingency as long ago as middle of October (vide Foreign Office telegram No. 107 of October 4th to Jeddah).

Despite our seeing the slowness of His Majesty’s Government in fulfilling jts promise(s) we with our troops are still expecting the fulfilment of same given, in return, in its letter and request now the handing over of Dawish, Hathlain and Mashur and driving out of ail Mutair and Ajman.

I have the honour to refer to your letter No. 2033/15/217 of 23-4- 1348 (27th September 1929) informing me of the desire of the British Govern ment to draw up a plan to improve the situation on the Nejd-Transjordan frontier, and you have therein shown the desire of your Government that peace should prevail there ; but I wish to inform you that in spite of your optimism I see that the tribes of Transjordan are increasing the number of their attacks and crimes. It has been reported to me that the tribes of Transjordan are making expe ditions on a large scale within the frontiers along the line from Wadi Sirhan to the Red Sea. Several attacks have taken place which have caused incalculable loss of life and property. Amongst these is in particular a raid carried out by the Arabs of Transjordan against the Shararat in the neigh bourhood of Jauf on about 25 3-1348 (30th August 1929) and^ another attack against a carvan which had left man for Misheitiya and Ba 1 aj in the vicinity of Tebuk when seven men of the caravan were taken prisoner, one being killed, and the whole caravan plundered. Besides that a large number of Transjordan raiders made several attacks against the vicinities of Tebuk and carried off many things including sheep and cattle belonging to the Government and to the Emir of Tebuk himself. I have also received many reports referring to the manner in which such crimes are carried out and their large scale and it is obvious that str*. ng measures must be taken to put a stop to them. I therefore beg you to inform the British Government as soon as possible of these regrettable incidents and to inform them that the Hejaz Government hope that they will co-operate with them in avoiding the occurrence ot such regrettable incidents which have a bad effect on our mutual relations and increase the difficulties of the present situation. The Heiaz Government protest strongly against these planned expedi tions and request the punishment of the criminals, the return of the looted property and the payment of blood money.

My second object was to meet at A1 Naab Sultan Abdalla Hussein and other Chiefs of the Fadhli tribe whose affairs and relations with its neighbours are not very satisfactory. Reports I received of personal dissensions among the leaders of the Upper Yafa tribe persuaded me that a visit to their district would not have been opportune. 3 I was impressed with the inaccessibility and primitive conditions of most of the country I passed through, and by its poverty. Almost every able-bodied man and even youths carried modern rifles. Despite their wild ness, chiefs and tribesmen seemed well disposed and many of the former deplored the backward state of fche territory. Of progress to material pros perity I saw no trace although in several tracts an increased cultivation of grain and coffee might support a much larger population. Opinions I have formed, which are confirmed by this journey, as to the lines along which a measure of progress may be promoted will be reported to Your Lordship in a separate despatch.

Your communication to Our Foreign Office relating to the raids said to have been committed by Our subjects against these of Trans-jordan has been forwarded to Us. Our Foreign Office will no doubt inform you of the reports we have received concerning raids committed by the Arabs of Trans-jordan against Our Arabs in the region of Jauf. The persistence of the Trans-jordan criminals has reached such a point that they have crossed the r egion of Jauf and even entered that of Hail. You will see that if this state cf things continues in this matter, the matter will become serious and that circumstances will compel the people of Nejd to a course of action which would not be in the interests of either country. We had suggested that the British Government should put an end to this state of affairs, but we regret that we have not so far received any effective reply regarding this question. Now, lest matters become very serious in those outlying regions, we would suggest to the British Government various ways of solving this problem so that they may for their part choose the one they consider best, and we are convinced that this will settle the matter. 1. The British Government shall of their own accord look into the question of the looted property and give a decision which they think com patible with justice and equity. We inform the British Government with the utmost frankness and clearness that we accept the decision they may arrive at regarding the looted property which is in dispute between our subjects and those of Trans-jordan, so that our rights and obligations may be defined Then the British Government should carry out the decision with regard to Transjordan, and notify Us so that we may have it carried out in our territory. It is important however that such a decision should be both effective and immediate. The British Government should then take drastic measures to prevent the Arabs of Trans-jordan making any attack, which preventive measures should be carried out m fact and no^ merely, on naper so that, if anyone attacks our frontiers, severe and exemplary punish ment should be inflicted upon him and the looted property restored to its Owners at once. If this suggestion is acted upon once or twice We believe that raids will come to an end once and for ad. 2 If this proposal is not practicable We suggest that both the parties concerned be informed that the Bedouin on both sides are free to settle the matter amon« themselves, that is, they may have peace or war with each Shev and thJt each of them is at liberty to defend his rights against the other Towns will be neutral in such agreements and disputes. Tnis, as th British Government will see, is fraught with dangers ana m maxing diis British bovernm merelv bv the fact that the Trans-] ordan Govern- ment°has not so far been able to prevent its subjects from attacking Ours. It is not possible for Us to prevent Our own subjects from defending them- selves to Cvering their rightful property if the Trans-jordan Government does not prevent its subjects from attacking Ours. f, the ^ a, ta .....it,,irfta«v»»,'■»«■ »t are convinced thatdhese mds^^ So y the of instigations which L^y _ A ffpo+ive and forcible preventive ^°Ind 1 ^e ll Covemnient U o£ t, Trans-ioSan , ^»s a ^ven T, no proof o, a?

The chassis is the standard 6-wheel Crossley chassis on which is mounted a special body. 2. The front of the cab is armoured and can carry three men. A Lewis gun is mounted above the cab and can be fired in any direction. At the rear of the cab, twelve riflemen can be seated in positions from which they can quickly dismount. Accommodation for drinking water spare ammuni tion, rations, etc., is provided between the two rows of men. 3. The vehicle is capable of a speed of about 45 miles per hour over good tracks and weighs under 5 tons unladen. Its performance is superior to that of the 6-wheeled Renault lorry. 4. The vehicle described could be supplied completely armoured but its speed and the maximum number of personnel that could be carried would both be reduced. 5. The body is so designed that the seats can be removed and the vehicle converted into an ordinary lorry by the addition of sides and a tail board.

Letter from Foreign Office, to Colonal Office, No. E.-6687/2322/91, DATED THE 31ST DECEMBER 1929. I am directed by Mr. Secretary Henderson to acknowledge the receipt of vour letter No. 69006/445/29 of the 21st December (Serial No 67), in which it is suggested that His Majesty s Charge d Affaires at Jedda should be instructed to urge upon King Ibn Saud that, m settling the terms of sub mission of the Nejdi rebels he should ensure that the loot taken from Iraqi tribes is returned. 2. In reply, I am to request you to inform Lord Passfield that Mr. Henderson is inclined to doubt whether such action would be opportune. 3. In the first place, it appears from the telegram No. 89 of December 23, from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, a copy of which was enclosed in Colonial Office letter No. 69006/462/29 of the 24th December (Serial No. 68), that Ibn Saud is not at present in a position to impose such conditions upon the rebels, since in reply to Dawish’s request for pardon and security Ibn Saud had demanded the return of all plunder (including presumably that taken from Iraqi tribes), and Dawish had refused this condition. 4. Secondly, it will be recollected that the Hedjazi Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, in the note, dated October 31, a translation of which was transmitted to the Colonial Office with Foreign Office letter No. E-6284/3/91 of the 14th December, contested the majority of the Iraqi claims presented to him by Mr. Bond. 5. Thirdly, Mr. Henderson feels that His Majesty’s Government are in a somewhat weak position to approach King Ibn Saud in the manner suggested on behalf of Iraq. In the telegram mentioned in paragraph 3 above, Lieu tenant-Colonel Biscoe reported the receipt by the Political Agent at Koweit of a letter from King Ibn Saud, in which he referred to fresh evidence that King Feisal was intriguing with Dawish. It seems unlikely therefore that Ibn Saud would be favourably influenced by the reference to the assistance given to him by the Iraqi Government with which it is suggested that the proposed request should be supported, or by the consideration that the Iraqi Government are debarred by their undertakings from negotiating direct with Dawish. 6. In view of these considerations, Mr. Henderson is inclined to appre hend that the action proposed in your letter under reply would merely expose His Majesty’s Government to the risk of a rebuff. If However the Secretary of State for the Colonies is strongly of the opinion that King Ibn Saud should be approached regarding the return of the loot taken from Iraqi tribes before the negotiations with the rebels are brought to a conclusion, Mr. Henderson is prepared to autnorise Mr. Bond to use his discretion in bringing the matter to the King’s notice. 0 ° Ministry* 0 ^* 08 * e ^ er are ^ e i n g sent to the India Office and Air (80) (Received on 26th January 1930, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 2, dated (P -56/30 ) l&gt;i ' 2 ^ J ' nuary 193 0-) Letter and. enclosure from Admiralty, to India Office, M.-03303/292, DATED THE 3lST DECEMBER 1929. transmit 1 ^ Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to ’ le 111 orma ’f 1 on of the Secretary of State, extracts from a report86 l!

On arrival, I was met by the Vice-Consul Mr. Cooke, and Hamdi Bey, the Commandant of the forces in Jeddah, who welcomed me on behalf of the Hedjaz Government. An official call was then paid upon Mr. W. L. Bond, the British Agent and Consul, which was returned the following clay, when the Agent was accorded a salute of 11 guns. (ii) His Excellency Sheik Fuad Hamsa, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, was staying in the town, and invited the Commanding Officer and three other officers to a picnic dinner party on one of the quarantine islands in the harbour. The party was specially organised in our honour, and was attended by the whole of the Consular authorities in Jeddah, and all the local notabilities, a total of 51 sitting down to the meal, which was served in semi-Arab style. A new Italian Consul has just arrived at Jeddah, vho is said to be of con siderable importance, and a great friend of Mussolini. It was noticeable that both he and the Soviet Consul, an individual of a very low Mongol type of countenance, were treated with considerable deference by the Hedjazi. The Foreign Minister appeared to be very friendly to us, and went out of his way to say what pleasure it gave him to see one of the sloops anchored in the Roads. He speaks English and French most fluently, having been educated at an American college in Syria, of which country he is a native. In conversation with Mr. Bond, I gathered that the difficulties surround ing the visits of the sloops to the Hedjaz coast have now disappeared, and he thinks that there will be no objection to more frequent visits being paid to Jeddah, as well as visits to Wej and Yembo, although previous notice of such visits would obviously be desirable. This seems very satisfactory, as for some time past, a great deal of the Arabian coast has been more or less closed to H. M. ships. (m) An official call was paid on the Kaim-makam, His Excellency Abdulla Ali Risa, on the 16th, accompanied by the British Agent. The Governor is a dear old man, very well inclined towards the British, who seems to live a great deal in the past, and to lament the passing of the good old days. In days gone by, he said, men worked but three months in the year, (during the Hajj), and made holiday the rest, and yet everybody had plenty of money. Now, he thought things were very different. Everybody has to work 24 hours every day, all the year round, and yet, nobody has any money, owing to the high rate of existing taxation. Owing to my sailing early on the 17th, it was impossible for His Excellency to return my call. ***** After leaving the Governor, I returned the call of the Commandant, Hamdi Bev? who is of somewhat crafty appearance, and unpleasant deme anour. I was not at all impressed by the physique or the accoutrement of the guard which was turned out to receive me. The Commandant of the local Irregulars was also present at this interview. * * In the evening the Commanding Officer and two officers dined with the British Agent, who spared no pains to make our visit in every way success ful and enjoyable. The ship sailed for Kamaran and Aden on the 17th, as soon as the sun was high enough to make navigation through the reefs as easy as possible.87 several dhows, but nothing suspicious was found. Perim was passed during the night, with a full moon, and a careful look-out was kept for any dhows coming up from the southward, winds favourable for vessels coming from the Gulf of Tadjura having been blowing for a few days. No sailing traffic whatever was seen. 5. Aden .—The Political Resident, Sir Stewart Symes, requested that official calls should not be exchanged, and invited the Commanding Officer to luncheon, to meet Sir Harold and Lady Kittermaster, and it was arranged that I should sail for Jibouti on the evening of the 23rd, and time my arrival for 15-00 on the 21th. The French authorities were informed accordingly. The Resident seemed very interested in the slave trade, and informed me that he was considering the possibility of obtaining reports from agents, principally with a view, in the first instance, to determining with some degree of certainty, the volume of the traffic, as it exists at present. During my stay, I was able to discuss this question with the political assistants, and emphasised how much any information from reliable sources would be appreciated. No confirmation of the report from Kamaran was forthcoming, and it is very evident that there is but little information bearing on the slave trade, to be obtained at Aden at present. The French Consul, M. Blaise, called on me, bearing a cordial greeting from His Excellency, the Governor of French Somaliland, who had %/ 7 j W HU JULdivJ. very kindly placed the Rest House at Jibouti at our disposal during our A second luncheon party was given at the Residency, to which the Commanding Officer was invited, attended by the French Consul, and by the British Vice Consul, at Jibouti, Mr. Salmon, who happened to be in Aden. * * 6. Sir Harold and Lady Kittermaster were embarked t.m . on the 23rd, and the ship sailed at 21-00, a course being laid off along the Aia uiau coast, almost as far as Perim, in the hope of intercepting any dhows. Hamlri ttuA / u y ivi. uocnard, am Harold Kittermaster and the Commanding Officer.After the dinner, there was an official reception and dance, attended by the whole European community, at least 150 being present. M. Cochard returned my call the next day, and was accorded a salute of 15 guns on leaving the ship. On that afternoon, a reception and dance was given at the Stade, a party of men were invited to play bowls, and the Commanding Officer and four others dined with His Excellency in the evening. (ii) Nothing could have exceeded the courtesy and friendliness of the French authorities during my stay. In addition to the Rest House, two Government cars, and a large motor boat were placed at our entire disposal, and good use was made of the facilities accorded. On the morning of the 26th, a shooting expedition was organised to the French frontier, and two gazelle were obtained. Shooting actually took place on British territory, and I was much impressed by the smart turn out of the personnel of the Frontier Force under a native corporal at the British blockhouse on the frontier. The road towards Zeila is wonderfully good, and I was informed that M. Cochard has devoted much attention to the improvement of the roads both inside and without the town. (iii) M. Street, the Secretary to the Governor, has only recently arrived at Jibouti, from Abyssinia, where he has Jived for many years. He is partly of English extraction, and speaks most fluent English, having served with Corps of Interpreters on the Western Front during the Great War. He fought with the r Border Regiment for nearly two years, wearing British Uniform and then returned to his coffee plantation in Abyssinia, which he had left on the outbreak of hostilities, in order to serve his country. t w several opportunities of discussing the extent of the slave traffic • th t h; s gentleman, and gathered that he thought that M. Zaphiro, whom he knew fnd liked, had exaggerated when he put the annual number passing at about 1000. As regards the coast Northward of Tadjura, M Street informed me tna the French post at Obokh had been reopened, and that French officers were now stationed both at Tadjura and at Obok . He also told me that the notorious Sultan of the Danakil tribe who TnrHnra had been nut in prison in Madagascar, and he behev that 6 the export of slaves on anything like an extensive scale was not now possible. ^ ^ hand foJ . a patrol of th e whole coast line, northwards to the tt^vigdan^of th'e^Frencffi'guards^ he'instanced^'case which Vad 'occurred quite recently. ,. fl observed behaving suspiciously, and was AtTuTlof ^she dil not comply, but put off from th^shore, ^ wa^ then dhfctedTthel biTshemade off, and the incident drew a sharp and his wife to visit the Hedjaz. qnsnicious, but there were no At the time, it seems M.

Cochard, The Chef de Cabinet and Mme Al/i M. and Mme. Street, and Mr. Lowe, who had been doing dt ^ as Acting British Vice Consul in the absence of Mr. Salmon t Aden. After the loyal toasts had been honoured, the Commanding Offi thanked His Excellency, M. Cochard most warmly for the friendly welconT he had accorded us, and proposed the toast of his health, coupled with tl t of success to the Colony of French Somaliland. In his reply, the Governor again emphasised the pleasure it afforded h' to have a British ship in harbour, and said how much he hoped that ^ should be able to pay him another visit at some future date. (v) On Sunday, October 27th a football match was p^yed against mixed team, at the Stade, which was fought out ‘ friendly spirit, although the result was an “ Dahlia.’ 5 m a very easy win for The match was attended by the Governor after which he insisted accompanying me to the pier, and seeing me safely onboard. In saying Good-bye, he went out of his way to tell me that the good behaviour of the liberty men had been specially noticeable, and that not a single complaint had been brought forward by the Police, a circumstance which is seemingly rare, when war-ships visit Jibouti. Q.Zetla—On arrival, Captain Wickham, the District Commissioner from Borama, came onboard to welcome me, and his call was returned durins the afternoon. The on'y other European at Zeila now are Mr. Crimson assistant m the public works department, and his wife. He is supervising the building of a guard house on the Western Frontier and also the work of increasing the height of the beacon on Aibat Island. iS l most 3 in ruins - A P art from the Residency and the and prison, there does not seem t° be one house in decent repair, nn d Tn dfl pre £ ent ® a most mournful aspect, with but little trade going butthfshafalfbeen^tt H eX P 0rt trade from Ab y®inia! are nlans on foot to ! ^ Jlb ° Utl ’ ^ the rai W&gt; alth O”g b them frontier whereh it i f passable motor road to the Abyssinian be recovered,^as the and dry for r the U OTpater r.'* 3&lt; t° r i *1?^ saiK lbanks, the pier being high -en a small Lp haAo fie be,.ring^&gt;trthe e sfa»e^rade^ durin^m^ftajf here^ 6 ^ ° £ significant info ™ ato slaves,' 1 happened”^ 1 be 'hfog d ^ r ’ , for ™ (;rl y interested in the running of fisherman, this man and the P ■ th ® ” cal gaol here, and being an expert several fishing ex^ditfons Grlms0n s Solnali *&gt;oy have taken them on the current price^o^slave^K^ti 11 .*’ lr , ,1 l ed °. n the slave trade, it appeared that in the Sun in Zeila and h’ 01 e' A :&gt; y RS ' n ’ a an d in Arabia was common talk Grimson^e7b :Cget :Kan Stedinthesub j ect &gt; both Mr - and Mrs ' The viat nf Z 0 f the Arab t0 °P en ont a good deal. were run ahniially, 1 all from' &lt; E S btai ?.® d was that at least 1,000 slaves Danakil tribe, that the nriee i nCb ^. oma hland, the slavers belonging to the for, that the traffic was almoa/ T*, m A V«in&gt;a was from £l-£2, H paid me was almost entirely confined to children, and that themost highly prized class of slaves would command a price of £70—80 in Arabia. It was also stated that the movements of the sloops were well known, that the French ships were not much feared, but that the slavers took great trouble to avoid the British sloops. It was also stated that there was a man in Jibouti, who would say “ Oh, plenty of rupees ” for information concerning the movements of ships. This information contravenes the opinion expressed to me just previous ly, by M. Street at Jibouti, but is in such striking confirmation of the opinions expressed by M. Zaphiro , that I thought the matter was worth pursuing further. Accordingly I arranged with the District Commissioner for an interview with Said Kudar, but whilst obviously anxious to please, I had the feeling that he was not speaking by any means Ireely. He started off by mention ing all the well-known places, where slaves have been anded in the past, and then went on to say that nowadays the traffic is almost all earned out in small boats, the business being too dangerous for the bigger dhows. He confirmed the reports that all the slaves come from the Danakil coast, and when I told him that the Sultan of Tadjura was in prison, he seemed in no way surprised, but said that another man in the tribe was now actively engaged in the trade. I questioned him narrowly as to whether the movements of the sloops got known in advance, and as to the course steered by the slavers from the African shore to the coast of Arabia. At this point, he appeared to me to be distinctly evasive, said that the movements of the ships were never known, but that a sharp look-out for their masts was always maintained, and that although a few of the slaves were taken straight across the Straits of Ban al Mandeb, and landed near Sheikh Seyd, the majority followed the African coast, amongst the Italian Islands, and then crossed over the Red Sea, when opposite their intended port of call. This information seemed to me distinctly contradictory, as it vas coupled with an emphatic statement that the slavers only trevelled by night, and yet were always ready to run their boats ashore, and retreat inland on sighting a sloop. He knew the notorious French slave dealer, M. Manfried quite well, and had often had dealings with him in the past, referring to him laughingly as Sheikh Abdulla, the name he has adopted in Arabia. He added that the slavers on their return usually carried back a cargo of rifles with them, and that they themselves were usually armed. The agent who pays for informatiou in Jibouti,[he stated to be an Arab named Hamudi. I am taking steps to ascertain if possible through Mr. Grimson, whether Said Hudar was purposely misleading me or not, as his Somali Boy was present as interpreter at my interview with him, and was also of the fishing P In the meantime, the following information was ° b t ain ^ t b ^Ua District Commissioner from his Inspector of Pohce who has been at Zerla for the last 30 years, and who may be regarded as reliable. ^ 'C E t£ «‘Z WOO *v„ ,» »l»o« ..-u ° hl,d E.ut« «... they 0.».

As an example of this, it was reported ashore on the day I sailed that « Dahlia ” was going to Aden, would only stay a very short time, and then proceed to Perim, after which she would go to a place called Dubat near Sheikh Seyd. It was also reported ashore that Sir Harold Kittermaster would proceed to Jibouti in “ Dahlia ”, long before it was known officially. The Inspector went on to say that one big dhow is still used, fitted with an auxiliary motor, belonging to the Prenchman, M. Manfried. The latter is believed to be at Obokh at the moment disguised as a native. It was also confirmed that the dhows travel only by night, and then only when there is no moon. The last dhow which had crossed, to the Inspector’s knowledge, went the month before last, but he thought there had probably been others of which he had not heard. He thought the trade was less than it was, but that it was still pretty lucrative. 10. Slave Trade Operations .—A number of dhows have been examined during the period of this report, but nothing suspicious has been observed. The gist of the information obtained, touching the slave trade, obtained at Jibouti and Zeila has been communicated to the Political Resident, Aden, and to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister Plenipotentiary at Addis Ababa. It is considered that, if possible endeavours should be made to confirm the existence of the persons named by the Inspector of Police at Zeila, and the Arab offender Said Kudar, as if those persons do exist, it should be possible to follow up their activities, and the fact of their existence would lend support to the credibility of the remainder of the information supplied.

My telegram No. 453. Regarding disposal of Ibn Mashhur and his following: they are not Nejdis but belong to Ruwallah tribe from Syria. Undertaking given by His Majestys’ Government and the Iraq Government to Ibn Saud does not therefore appear to apply to them. Moreover Ibn Mashhur states that Ibn Saud has excluded them from the offer of the terms made to the rebels on the grounds that he does not want them. I sl |§§ es t therefore that the Iraq Government having settled their own account with them should let them return to Syria. Please telegraph whether I may advise the Iraq Government accordingly. As regards the rebels Mutair and Ajman; rebels on Koweit-Iraq frontier with women and children are now re using to recross the Nejd frontier even under the threat of Irafi po ice cars. Royal Air Force, armoured cars and aeroplanes. Mutair ugitives also with women and children may be expected to cross into Iraq near Riqai and adopt the game attitude. * The situation has therefore arisen ot which Ibn Saud was warned by the British Agent at Jeddah mparagraph 5 of his letter of 16th October and which Ibn Sand has apparently taken no steps to avert. In these circumstances it is clearly impossible to bomb or shoot down the rebels and the alternatives are (a) as first proposed by the Iraq Government to expel them to foreign territory, eg. Syria and (6) to accept their surrender, arresting the leaders and disarming and interning the remainder, the only condition being that they are not hand ed over to Ibn Sand against their will. I have informed the Prime Min ister that {a) would not be acceptable to His Majesty’s Government and must be ruled out, (6) accords with demands 1 and 5 contained in aide-memoire enclosed in Jeddah despatch No. 306 of 30th November (Serial No. 62) and Iraq Government have now agreed to this procedure. Since the situ ation admits of no delay locally police and Royal Air Force Commanders have been instructed to take action accordingly. If the rebels surrender as anticipated leaders will be imprisoned and the remainder escorted to Jarishan on Iraq-Koweit border where adequate grazing exists. Iraq Government can then settle accounts with the rebels who have raided Iraq in the past and subsequently negotiate for their ultimate disposal with Ibn Sand.

I have already, in my telegram No. 1 (?55), mentioned doubts entertained here where Iraq is concerned as to sincerity of British attitude towards Ibn Sand, and although credit is generally given for efforts made by His Majesty’s Government to carry oufc their undertakings, anxiety i s still felt on this score. I am convinced that His Majesty’s Government will be held responsible and accountable for action taken by Government of Iraq towards Dawish and rebels and that it will be interpreted as prov ing or disproving sincerity of His Majesty’s Government. Whatever the facts may be there is a strong feeling that Iraq and Koweit Governments have to some extent been playing Dawish’s game and if rebels are now (Sic. ? not) readily handed over are only handed over under pressure, I fear idea may become established that His Majesty’s Government have connived at this all along in spite of categorical assurances given. As regards action proposed by His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Iraq {1) vis-a-vis Ibn Mashhur and (2) vis-a-vis rebels, (1) apparently con- templetes allowing Mashhur to proceed to Syria without providing for his actions against this country, I do not consider in view of spirit of assur ances given that such action could be successfully defended on technical grounds before public opinion in Arabia or that it would be interpreted other wise than as granting a refuge. As regards (2)1 am firmly convinced that the King and Government will expect rebels to be handed over unconditionally and that in this respect assurances given would be considered to over-ride any argument based on absence of an extradition treaty. Demands (4) and (5) quoted by the High Commissioner are I think subsidiary demands referring to isolated cases of evasion and should not be held to affect main demand No. 2 which I believe is intended to cover any situation in which rebels as a force may succeed in placing themselves out of the reach of the King’s forces.

I have the honour to enclose copy of a Note which I am directed by my Government to forward to His Majesty the King regarding the protests made by Him against the action of the British Government in respect of the Awazim tribe. 2. I should be grateful if Your Excellency would arrange for this Note to be conveyed to His Majesty as the earliest possible opportunity, and I enclose a copy for the information of the Hejaz Government. His Majesty’s Government learn from the Political Resident at Bushire that Your Majesty has in a recent letter to him made further protests against the action of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the Awazim tribe. They cannot but believe that this protest is bassed upon a misappre hension which the following explanation will remove. In reply to Your Majesty’s letter of November 17th in which anxiety was expressed lest Your Majesty’s rebellious subject when pressed should escape by mixing with tribes in adjacent countries, and in which the request was made that these tribes should be removed from the vicinity of the frontier, His Majesty’s representative informed Your Majesty that measures would be taken to this end. Being under the impression that the Awazim had already entered or were about to enter Koweit in order to seek sanctuary, His Majesty’s Government gave instructions that they a,s well as Koweit tribes should be ordered to move into the interior of Koweit. Subsequently however, His Majesty’s Government learnt that the Awazim has not availed themselves of the permission given to move into Koweit territory but remained in neutral area. On receipt of this mtorma- tion, in order that doubt of the position of the Awazim mignt be cleared up and the assurances given t &gt; Your Majesty regarding the clearing ott e frontier zone might be fully implemented, instructions were given that a message should be sent to the Awazim to the effect that they must f* th f r move at once into the interior of Koweit or alternately that they would be treated as part of the contending forces. His Majesty s Government now learn that they have not entered Koweit and that instructions have therefor beemeiven for the denial to them of all supplies from Koweit and for the use of force if necessary to expel them should they cross the frontier.

They consisted of two persons sent by Abdullah bin Turki (Abu Ithaar) and they brought a letter^ copy of which i g also below. Similar letters having been sent to Qatif and Hassa. “We convey to you the happy tidings that the Awazim crushed the vile enemy on the 1st Jamad I, (5th October 1929), and that their chief, ad-Duwisb, his son Bandar and Ibn Ash wan’s two sons were killed and that the defeated were followed up to Hamadh and were slaughtered in a killing so great as will be handed down by the living to posterity. Five Bairaqs^were captured from the enemy/' and sent by us to Hassa. 2. The messengers gave out that the day before the battle there were attacks on horses by both sides and that on. the 1st of Jamad (5th October 1929) Mutair heavily attacked the Awazim who consisted of four parties camped on the Nuqairiyah wells (Ingair). During the attack the most south- ernly party was defeated and Mutair reached the Awazim’s camp and set up their Bairaqs in it. 3. As to Ibn Shuqair, he took Dhidan from the Awazim, but the latter then counter-attacked and defeated and drove back the enemy to their camp. In the evening the Awazim again attacked the Mutair and fought with them with swords and daggers (hand to hand) and after a two hours’ struggle the Mutair were again defeated and followed to Hamadh. 4. Ibn Shuqair escaped in another direction to that of the defeated tribes, whose total casualties are estimated to be 800 out of whom ad-Duwish is one (undoubtedly), and also Naif Abul Kulab (Shaikh of the Ajman) Ibn Ashwan’s sons and many others.

Before this I sent yon a letter in which I informed you about our safe arrival, nothing occurred here besides the fight of ad-Duwish with the Awazim. The news which has reached us is that ad-Duwish has been defeated but we are in doubt as to whether the news is true or not, but many stories have reached us from Hassa, Jnbail and Qatif all to the effect that the fight took place on the morning of Saturday and continued for six hours, ending with the defeat of ad-Duwish who was followed to Hamadh, and that ad-Duwish himself and his son Bandar had been killed. Tnere is an addition to the above news, received from Jubail, it is that Ihn Shuqair during the fight took some camels which belonged to Awazim and •started towards the West in another direction than that of the defeated tribes, we do not know whether he took these camels from Awazim during the fight or found them straying. fi summar y °f the news which has reached us about the fight aI1 ^ the truth of course, will appear later. As to the Amir Saud, he has probably e t liassa to-day proceeding to the Awazim with a force, he ordered the Qusai- ? arra i* nge , to send his requirements to Jubail, this was done together with 500 tins of petrol for his motor cars. ■n ^ is said that Amir Saud has fifty motor cars and that four aeroplanes wfil reach to him, God knows better if this be true.Letter from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 573-S. of 1929, dated the 29th October 1929.

His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad who as you know keeps himself in formed of Nejd affairs through Bahrain by means of certain Kuwaiti merchants has received letters by last mail making the following reports :— (a) Abdur Rahman al-Qosaibi has written confidentially from Hoffuf to his family that a caravan between Nejd and Hoffuf has been taken by the Ajman also another belonging to Rani Hajir near Hoffuf. (5) A Kuwait merchant from the interior confirms that Bin Saud has gone to Shaara 140 miles west of Riath. He adds that the Nejd-Hejaz road has been closed for some time. Also that the price of a bag of rice in Riath is now Rials 60 Eurther that the Hoffuf treasury is empty and officials have not received pay for 2 months. That the people fear a sudden attack and that four or five patrols in “ ford ” cars move out of the town daily and proceed towards the north returning every evening. (c) That a good deal of anti-Kuwait propaganda is issuing from the Qosaibi’s house, special items being that the Shaikh of Kuwait’s cars leave regularly for the rebel camp with supplies of arms and ammunition, also that al-Duwish has got one or the Shaikh of Kuwait’s “ Bairaqs ” with him.104 , n T1 ,„t Bin Sand has written to the Ataiba Shaikhs saying that the ^ 1 heads of Duwish, Ibn Mashur, Ibn Hathlain, Mohomed al- Khalid, and twenty three lesser, rebels have been sent to Hoffuf,' as well as several captured “ Bairaqs ” as a result of the last crowning victory. , r , , That 2 war flags were taken from the Ajman by the Awazim when thev were driven back at the battle oflngairk admitted by the Akhwan. These were got through to Hoffuf before Ha wish finally forced a surrender, and I believe have hung from the walls of the kut ever since as emblems of the victory.

Further reports of this incident have now been received. 3. It appears as far as I can judge from the confused accounts which have reached me tha$ a strong force of the Ataibah under al Dahaina moved south wards across the Mecea-Biyadh road penetrating as far as the country around Turaba raiding villages in that neighbourhood but not venturing near Taif. 4. Khalid bin Lovrai’s expedition against them was not at first successfu and he was compelled to retire or else of his own accord withdrew to Khurma However on the arrival of reinforcements sent from Taif under Mohammed bin Sahmi, Khalid bin Lowai made a detour and threatened the Ataibah communications, thus compelling the forward detachments of the raiders to ^ len a PP ears to have followed up his success by driving these etachments Northwards and an action is reported to have taken place bet ween them and the loyal sections of the Ataibah under Ibn Bubeian, in which they are said to have been defeated with heavy loss.

Enclo. to Serial No. 130. Official Communique. Press Department. His Majesty the King, on his return to Nejd from Hejaz, stayed for some days at the village of Dawadami in order to look into the question of those who participated in the disorders and were punished on the day of M Atxila. Sheikhs of the Ataibah tribe came to His Majesty, declared their submission and obedience, and asked His Majesty to pardon the guilty. His Majesty pardoned them. . „ . „ It so happened that when His Majesty was arranging for the pursuit of the remainder of the Ajman and Mutair rebels near Koweit, Feisal ed Doweish and his Ajman followers raided a section of A1 Saba an at a place callen El Qa’iyah, during the absence of the fighting forces ijat tribe, and so they met with no resistance. The rebels after watering left the place. p„ rtie s from the Ataibah and Beni Abdullah of the Mutair who were with Ibn Mashhur crossed to Nejd in order to cause disturbances Among them were Ebeid Ibn Eaisal Ibn Hamid and Mohammed El Khudun, both of the Ataibah and resident at Baghdad. These carried out some raids on persons Ataioan ana pHmlnals joined them. Emigrants who were encamped P ear the rebels and who were of the Ataibah, Harb and Qanlan tribes quickly attacked Uie rebTls, Inch party engaging the rebels of its own tribe, until they defeated and scattered tbem ^ to ^ ^ ^ the i a H v M This h nephew.

His Majesty the King attached the rebels and comp y ^ ga - d that those who received his was asked to pardon rt selves at Rivadh for Sharia action against them, pardon should sunder them be y kille d and their property confiscated, but that those who did not do so mig ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ Qai&gt;h; Subsequently (El Daweis , - Dushan and the Mutair together sent his son Abd el Aziz and the ^ le | °““ nd the Ajman numbering seven with all the fitting strength ^ the Maitau-^ The t hU toAlHazoTanTfh cSfound a great number of camels belonging toA 112 the Arabs of the Sbammar and Aneiza tribes, all of which they looted. The Emir Abd el Aziz Ibn Musaad, Emir of Hail, on hearing of this raid, being encamped with his soldiers at a place called Igbah immediately started out in pursuit, reaching A1 Basuk and then Urn Ardamah, where he stayed for three days but couM not trace the rabels. On Saturday 4th Rabi Tani 134 8 (tth September 1929) the Emir left for Lams, and when he reached a place called Tayarat, he caught sight of Abd el Aziz Ed Daweish and his followers returning with their loot. The Emir quickly attacked them and after five hours fighting the rebels retreated, pursued by the mounted units, who com- plelely defeated them. Among them was Abd el Aziz Ed Daweish and the party of Ibn Mashhur. Earhan ibn Mashhur himself was not present at the fight. Now these rebels have three times made a covenant with the King and three times broken their pact. Since it is impossible to reform them, and since they ought to be made to serve as a 'warning to others, the Emir Ibn Mussad found it better not to be lenient as regards their punishment. He therefore collected the remainder of the rebels, numbering two hundred persons and ordered their heads to be cut off. This was carried out, all being killed except two wdio fled on horseback and could not be traced. This last campaign and the campaigns wTiich. preceded it have caused the greatest impression on the remainder of the rebels now scattered alono- the frontiers. At the end of Rabi Tani (3rd January 1929) His Majesty the King will set out with all the Nejdian forces, whom His Majesty has ordered to march towards the Kowiet borders, to deal with the remainder of the rebels there. This military operation by the will of God will be the last of its kind to cleanse this Arabian Peninsula of all evil and evildoers. 20th Rabi Tani 1348 (24th September 1929).

This assistance could have been ^ h backing and beating those criminals instead of communicating wit i t lem and giving them sufficient time to get away safely. I believe that this request or the Hejaz Government cannot but be approved of by His .Britannic Majesty s Government, because they promised to carry it out according to your letter No. 1164-33-150, dated 20th Moharram 1348 (27th June 19w9j addressed to His Majesty the King.

With reference to Your Excellency’s Note No. 14-3—51 of the 25th instant (21-4-1348) (Enclo. No., 1) regarding the measures taken to expel Eeisal ed Daweish and the rebel refugees with him from Koweit territory, I have the honour co explain to Your Excellency that the position of His Majesty’s Government is as follows :— 2. His Majesty’s Government undertook to prevent Nejdi rebels from using Koweit territory as a base for activities against His Majesty the King or as a refuge from His Majesty’s punitive forces. With this object in view authority was given for Eeisal ed Daweish to be attacked if this should be necessary in order to eject him from Koweit territory. This authority was not an instruction to attack Eeisal ed Daweish at sight, but was intended to enable the British authorities to take drastic action against him if and when necessary, without reference to higher authority. 3. Colonel Dickson, on the occasion to which my Note No. 1982-33— 228, of the 22nd instand refers, did in fact take steps which resulted in Eeisal ed Daweish leaving Koweit territory forthwith. 4. Had these steps not been successful, he would no doubt have had resort to more drastic measures. 5. No action such as that foreshadowed in paragraph 4 of Your Excel lency’s Note No. 14-3—44 of the 9th instant (5-4-1318) is covered by the undertaking given by His Majesty s Government. 6. I am sending a translation of Your Excellency’s Note and a copy of this Note to His Majesty’s Government. i. ■{ i \ t(132) (Received on 17th November 1929, with Political Secretary's letter No. 44, ^ the 31st October 1929.)

I baye the honour to refer to your Confidential despatch No. 49 of the 27th August No. E.-62(1)-JN —29, regarding the possibility of an influx of refugees from Nejd into Koweit. 2. Since your despatch was written the situation which you apprehended has actually arisen and has been successfully dealt with. Insurgents accom panied by their women and children have in fact entered Koweit territory and have been prevailed upon to leave. In _ the event, of a further influx of refugees into Koweit it must, in my opinion, rest with the local authorities, acting in the light of existing instructions, to take such steps as are practicable to expel them, obtaining the assistance of armoured cars should this be necessary. His Majesty’s Government are not themselves in a position to devise special measures in advance to deal with such a situation. 3.

Dawish has replied saying that he will submit with his whole force on the following conditions :— (1) That he be free to purchase supplies, in any town he (gr. chooses ? omitted?) in Iraq, Koweit or Nejd. (2) That he should not be required to meet Ibn Saud. (8) That he be allowed to lead Badouin life in the future and not be ordered to reside in any town. Dawish stated that in order to test his loyalty he knew Ibn Saud would order him to attack Koweit but under ftp circumstances would he agree, and in order to strengthen his hands in coming negotiations he bad ordered raid on South to recommence at once.

Confidential lettee from the Political Agent, Kuwait, to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, No. 613 DATED THE 6TH NOVEMBER 1929. With reference to my telegram No. 600. dated 31st October and subse quent telegrams, I have the honour to submit the following report 1. On the night of the 30th October at about 7-30 p.m., His Excellency the Shaikh sent round his Secretary to report to me that al-Duwish had written in asking for an interview at Jahrah or Saada the next or following day, adding that he hoped I would meet him also. He had certain questions to ask, be said, as well as certain important information to impart. The Secretary added that as His Excellency thought such interview would be useful especially as it was not known, if al-l&gt;uwish intended preventing the Awazim from entering Kuwait or not, he, the Shaikh, suggested that he should be allowed to see the Rebel Leader and that I should accompany him. I accordingly sent off my telegram No. 690 early on the morning of 31st October. 2. On the same day (31st October) at 10-30 a.m. I visited the Shaikh to discuss al-Huwish’s latest request, explaining at the same time that I had tele graphed you, and that we could do nothing till we received your reply. 3. Whilst with the Shaikh and at about 11 a.m. a messenger accom panied by al-Huwish’s nephew suddenly brought the startling news that al- Duwish himself with a considerable retenue had followed up his letter in person and had reached a point 6 miles from the city. The Shaikh who was very angry indeed sent for the Duwish's nephew, a mere boy, and to his face abused his uncle roundly for being a “ worthless and thick headed Bedouin who could not wait a few hours for a reply to an ordinary letter The youth replied with spirit that no man could stop al-Duwish in anythin?, when once the latter’s mind was made up, nor would he the Shaikh be able to stop him from coming to Kuwait now he had got so far and the city itself was in sight. His Excellency much upset dismissed the youth and asked what my advice was. I suggested his being returned to his camp at once. But on the Shaikh pointing out that the Rebel Leader would certainly refuse to do this and would come straight on. I came to the conclusion that the best means of turning him was to send a joint order to al-Duwish to retrace his steps and then proceed half right to Jahrah, where he could await our reply. To insure his going back, a car was sent for him and he was invited by Abdullah bin Jabir the Commander of the Kuwait forces to proceed to Jahrah. The an&lt; ^ n00n al-Duwish was successfully shepherded to Jahrah, but the situation was stilly difficult, and both His Excellency and I fully realized the danger of allowing al-Duwish to remain inside the Kuw'ait border. i j’ a A t ur ^ ier discussion with the Shaikh, it was decided that I should send for Abdullah al Jabir from Jarhah and give him a definite order 10 m myself to al-Duwish to quit Jahrah that night, informing him at the some time that no meeting could be held at all with him till he recrossed the border. As stated m my telegram No. 604, Abdullah was further iustructed o obtain rom the Rebel Leader either xerbally or in writing exactly what ie desired to say, and to tell him that it would be reported to His Majesty’s overnment and if the latter thought necessary both His Excellency and T would be sent out to his camp to interview him.121 5. It was just about this time, and shortly after we had sent off Abdullah on is secon mission, that your telegram No. 1066, arrived impressing on me e necessi y of meeting al-Duwish outside Kuwait territory in company with His Excellency the Shaikh. 6. Abdullah who was very late in reaching Jahrah owing to his car breaking down duly delivered my message and after an all night discussion successfully got Duwish out of Jahrah two hours before dawn, on 1st Novem ber 9 9 and across the border about 2J hours later. With al-Duwish were the following Rebel Shaikhs :— Talah Ibn Hanaiah Mohamed Ibn Watban . }&gt; Dooshan | Mutair. Mikhlif Ibn Jarbuh . J Muahi Ibn Ashwan }■ Braih. Jazzah Ibn Ashwan .J also one-hundred and twenty-five retainers. 7. Abdullah bin Jabir returned to Kuwait at 10 a.m., on 1st November and reported to me verbally what he had done and delivered the message which al-Duwish desired to be conveyed to His Majesty’s Government. This I sent off to you under my telegram No. 606 of the same date. Abdullah also brought a personal and rather typical letter from the Akhwan Leader, translation of which I append to this report. 8. Among other interesting statements made by Duwish to Abdllah the following is I think worth of record. He stated that Bin Saud had spread the report among the Ataiba that he had received recently a letter from Shaikh Ahmad of Kuwait to the effect that as he Bin Saud had now destroyed the Rebels in Hassa, he the Shaikh of Kuwait desired to be allowed to take over and protect the Mutair and Ajman women and children who had survived the King’s chastisement, and that he intended placing them in the country on the north side of the Bay of Kuwait. Bin Saud had added that he had granted the Shaikh of Kuwait his request as he was an old friend. Enclo. 2 Serial No. 143.

He has told me unofficially that the Hedjaz Government desire him to investigate the truth of allegations made against Kuwait regarding the assistance afforded to the rebel tribes. He suggested incidentally that the Awazim tribe might now be used as intermediaries. It is possible that his mission is an excuse to get him away from Mecca. He expects to be in contact with and probably to visit Ibn Saud whose camp will be at Qaryah.

Permission to Awazim to return to Koweit allegiance and approval given to this by His Majesty’s Gov ernment is strongly protested against by King. He asks that as this em- barasses his action against rebels they should be expelled. Pardon has been asked for by Hawish but King has replied that this can only be decided by Shariat and proposes to attack in force at once. It is stated privately that Bin Saud intends to attack Koweit. Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs has restated to British Agent case against Koweit emphatically and handed Aide Memoire representing his personal views which consist mainly of tirade against perfidy of Koweit. He further demanded that any rebel should be arrested, tried, punished and disarmed on entering Koweit or Mesopotamia. British Agent concludes “The coincidence of King s pro jected move to neighbourhood of Koweit b( ^ ei -J 18 . foreshadowed by H a z Wahba [see my telegram No. 165 November 8th (Enclo. 2 to Serial No. 144)] the present attitude in spite of all past assurances and ^ above of Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs suggests possibility that Bm Saud mav be tempted in order to teach Eoweit a lesson to use opportunity of pre- s“noe of his forces on Koweit border, which His Majesty’s Government has so strongly reinforced. ,, , TWut intention of Acting Minister for Foreign Aflairs may therefore bein c^e of action against 3 Koweit by Bin Saud to forestall eventual protests.124 (146) Telegram P., from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in IHti /-&gt;» T&gt;^T«-rrTT%TH 11 Qfi ■nAT'Trn ^PTTTn 9Rnnrr , ^ X XVWaWL — — — — x xiN I 1 Peesian GtJLF Bushire, No. 1196, dated the 26th November 1929, Will you kindly refer to my telegram No. 1195, dated the 26th Noyemhp (Serial No. 145).

Whilst they used to dislike the rule of Sheriff Hussein, he gave it as his opinion that they were still more averse to the rule of Ibn Saoud, King of the Hedjaz, and Sultan of Nejd. On the afternoon of the 17th, an auxiliary schooner, the &lt;e Penn ” under the French flag, specially fitted for lobster fishing entered the hay. She is under the command of Mr. G.

All my luggage was taken charge of and thoroughly searched 1°/ t ag -f et 5’.’ but ^ e y b were thoroughly 8 dfsappointed as, xcept a butter knife, they did not discover anything of the sort. So, on e evening of the 12th I was given possession of my luggage and it was God sent, as for three days and two nights I was given a bare torn mat as the sole magnificent set of furniture, comprising sitting room, dining room, drawing 100 m and edroom of floor of all bumpy stones in all angles and shapes and the room was so clean that the numberless inhabitants of it in fleas, bugs and other vermins, weie so social with my body that, inevitably, they made jolly good feed of my blood and flesh. No matter how many I slaughtered more advanced to nil the ranks up. Of course, these 3 days and 2 nights I will ha^e reason to remember the rest of my days. Anyhow I was taken to High Court on 13th and was tried by Kazir (the Chief Justice) with charge of being a non-Moslem attempted to penetrate to Mecca, and if proved, the penalty was death. But to their surprise, the Kazir, who is of an unbiased mind thorougly worth his office, after searching examination, found I was as good a Moslem as himself, ordered my immediate release and let me proceed wherever I liked for the pilgrimage. ‘ I thanked my God that all was over, and my guards took me to prison, telling me I can take my luggage, but on pretence of fixing the things up in quarter of an hour, I was detained in prison till 20th April. Oh 18th April, I managed to get a pencil written note smuggled to the British Consul requesting him to take action, I cannot make out why the Consul was so uninterested in my case. As I did tell his Indian representative on the night of the 10th April that I was wrongfully arrested and kept prisoner and, as an Australian subject, asked for protection. He promised me he will bring the matter to the notice of the Consul immediately. But I did not hear anything till my smuggled note of 18th April. On 20th April I was summoned by the Governor of the prison, who told me he would release me on parole, to be in the house of one of his friends (?) and not to leave Jeddah until his order. So I came out of my Sweet Araby on 20th April evening. I am trying to get an interview with the British Consul, and there, on the 21st I received your such welcome letter. If you receive this letter, would you think it would be worth while for the Australian Government to make enquiries, in case of my sudden disappearance of this abode. As they confidently inform me that disobeying the Kazir’s order is sure sign of facing firing party. If it comes to that, I can assure you I know how, and will face it as calm and worthy of my adopted Great Australia. I am trying to smuggle this letter through Suez. p # g '—Since writing this letter I had an interview with the British Consul, whom I showed your letter, who tells me everything will be alright in future and my first message did not reach him. One official blames the other for not telling him plainly. Anyhow, I have no trust in promises of local Government, as once w’e proceed interior no news is brought to outside world. Thousands of such cases have happened. So good bye for the present. Your letter was the cause of respect shown to me by the Consul. Enclo. 2 to Serial No. 151.

Now the said Hassanullah for the sake of exonerating him- se lf from the blame tries to make a light affair by telling his superior and others that on account of my being a non-Moslem by biith this happened, but as. I am, a Moslem of 30 years and thousands of new converts come to pilgrimage every, year many of them only few months old, why they were not arrested. Another thing, on third day after my acquittal by Kazir (the Chief Justice) why was I again imprisoned for 9 days and best of all the international rule is to present the passport of every pilgrim to the Consulate of his Government within 12 hours of his landing at Jeddah and mine was secreted or not presented until after my release, so they had made up their mind before my landing to leave no trace of mine of my reaching Hedjaz and yet with all such open proof Hassanullah tries to make light matter of it. I did not mention in my last letter that consulate own Head Surgeon, Dr. Muzaffer Ali Shah (Vice* Consul) cured me of a nasty bruise inflicted between my shoulder blades, by a rifle butt blow r from behind without warning by a dastardly cowaid sentry for my not bowing down his officer when talking, but that did not curb, my free Australian spirit two days after my acquittal by Kazir, but I can assure you I did suffer some pain through it, but I did not give them a chance to say that an Australian squeak'd when he was hurt. Although darkness came over me when the blow was struck, but thank God I managed to keep my pains erect and after few seconds I calmly turned to my cowardly assaulter and laughed at his face, and said “ I bow 7 to my Almighty God only&gt; and no one else ”, No doubt the aforesaid Dr. Muzaffer Ali Shah rendered me some good service and it was him who took that smuggled letter of mine to the Consul on 19th April, and attended to my other illness (152) {Received on 23rd November 1929, with Political Secretary's letter No. 46, dated the 7th November 1929.)

Subject. Jeddah despatch to the Foreign Office, No. 247, of 22nd September 1929, and Enclosure. General situation report. Letter from the British Agent and Consul, Jeddah, to the Foreign Office, No. 247, dated the 22nd September 1929. In my telegram No. 130 of the 10th instant (Serial No. 29) I touched briefly on the conditions in the Hejaz, and I mentioned then that the politi cal and financial situation was becoming steadily worse. 2. In view of recent and possible developments it may be of interest if I amplify the information contained in my telegram, and give a resume of the main features of the situation as it is to-day and as it appears to Jeddah and Mecca opinion with whom I am in touch. 3. Ever since Feisal ed Doweish throw off the veil of his doubtful allegiance and declared himself openly in rebellion against Ibn Saud the Gov ernment has had to deal with a growing restiveness and lawlessness among the tribes, which has vented itself in incidents of major or minor importance and which has now brought the Government face to face with a critical situation resembling in many ways the position at the beginning of the Great War when the Hejaz was menaced by the revival of the militant Wahabi power to which it eventually succumbed. 4. There is a general feeling abroad now in Jeddah and Mecca among the better informed classes, whether sympathetic or hostile to the present regime, that the fate of the Hejaz and of Arabia in general may at anytime within the next few months be staked upon the issue of a decisive battle between Ibn Saud and the rebel forces. There does, in fact, seem little doubt that the King’s position in Arabia is shortly to be put to a searching test. Openly, every confidence in professed in the result. In private one observes an under current of anxiety, an anxiety which, fed by the successive rumours of gossip mongers, sees its justification in the exceptional measures taken by Ibn Saud to provide for the coming conflict. Doubts are expressed as to his ability in certain eventualities to control the situation m the interior ; and such eventualities might result for instance from a suecessiw of ooups possibly of small importance in themselves, in which the Akhwan were victorious. Their prestige is such that, given a reasonably successful start, they are likely to attract active sympathy and co-operation from aJ slues. 5 jt would be futile to attempt a comparison between the strengt i o the rival forces These vary almost from day to day and they would tne .rival lorccs. •x.wiw* fortunes of the campaign.

On the have everyother side the rebels are also believed to be well armed but one may i n f from the deputations and appeals to the Sheikh of Koweit and their anxi t to avail themselves of the Koweit grazing grounds that they severely handicapped by lack of supplies. Numerically also ^ ^ must be at a great disadvantage. 6. The chief weakness of the King’s position lies in the inferior mo 1 of his army as compared with the fanatic enthusiasm and desperate cour of the Akhwan, and in the general unpopularity of his rule. As a result^f the latter, it is generally believed that except in Nejd proper the majoritv f the tribes wmuld rise at once if there were any reasonable hope of throw' 01 off his yoke. Added to this in the fact that he is unable to rely on a lar^ number of troops who have been enrolled in the south by attractive promi^ 6 and by enforced levies, and who have not their heart in the fight • th 868 include for instance a number of Arabs of the Ataibah tribe of which seve^ sections are in open defection. Many of these troops have been sent t Medina and thence drafted to other bases, while some seven thousand ^ distributed at different posts between Taif and Henakiya to provide asa' 81 ^ surprises. In Nejd itself, to judge from the small number of tribal chiefs of importance who are reported to be with him at Riyadh, he does not anne - to have succeeded in rallying the tribes to his side and has had to fill v' ranks largely with townsmen. 7. Another weakness is the fact that the defection of the Akhwan fa to a large extent discredited him among the more fanatical and influential elements of his own following. People like Abdulla bin Hassan, a descend ent of Abdul Wahab, who was chiefly responsible for the recent dismissal' of the Imams at Mecca and Medina, Abdulla bin Alaihid until last vear Grand Wadi of Mecca, Mohammad bin Ali Turky who resigned the same nost a few month ago, are commonly believed to favour the Akhwan cause while Abdul Latif, another descendent of Abdul Wahab and one of the most in fluential Ulemas at Riyadh is reported to have left Riyadh and to havP definitely gone over to Feisal ed Doweish. Ibn Sand is beginning to be regarded by these fanatics as no longer true to Wahabi tenets and as beim himseif now no better than an infidel. Thoir support of him is in any case likely to be lukewarm only as they themselves would stand to lose by any diminution of the fanatical Akhwans influence. ^ ^ Q r| 8 M SignS inci ? ents are not wanting to alarm the inhabitants of Jeddah end Mecca.

I 2 . In vrew of the state of affairs as described above, it is not to be ^whh the north i^diffi 6 *° Ca ^ ^ e i az ^ Communication &lt;%with the north is difficult and takes considerable time. Rumours of defeats are exagger ted and good news, meagre as it is, is received with a scepticism born of many disappointments. The black side of things therefore looms large before his anxious eyes and he derives little comfort from a situation which, tor all its brighter aspects, is wrapped in uncertainty. To add to hig gloom tne cost ot all such commodities as are normally purchased from the interior, e.g., mutton and butter, has risen considerably and is still rising. The cost ot mutton for instance is doubled. t ^ i n ^-i Ca t e( i though in my telegram No. 130 of September 10th &lt; V S. No. 29), the conditions of the country although far from satisfactory is to a large extent the natural consequence of the period of suspense through which it is passing in anticipation of a definite solution by battle of the question of supremacy. It should not be forgotten either that, although latterly there has been peace and security in the Hejaz, disturbances, raiding and counter-raiding on a larger or lesser scale is a normal state of affairs in Arabia. 14. The political situation is still further complicated by the present financial crisis. The Government is having the greatest difficulty in raising money to satisfy the King’s requirements and to meet other calls. An attempt to raise a loan among local Jeddah merchants has had no success. Customs dues, as reported in my telegram No. 199 of August 15th last, have been collected in advance on orders placed, although the goods are not due to arrive for months ahead. Large increases have been made in the Customs tariff on tobacco and certain other commodities {vide my despatch No. 0. T. 9 of August 9th). Cash which merchants at Yanho, Wejh, etc., wish to remit to Jeddah is often commandeered by Government representatives and drafts, on the Customs are given in exchange. These drafts, which now constitute the usual method of payment are rapidly losing value, although it is still possible to negotiate them with the more influential merchants at a five per cenG discount ; it is impossible except in rare cases and by bribery to realise them on presentation. An appreciable proportion of Government funds is diverted into improper channels and finds its way into the pockets of the higher Government officials and of the Emir Eeisal itself while the sums that are sent to Riyadh are from all accounts expended by the King in true Royal fashion. A form of taxation has been introduced among the tribes around Taif by which each tribe is called upon to supply a fixed number of men and camels for the arms, fail ing which a fine of eight pounds per camel and thirteen pounds for each fight ing man short of the number is inflicted. This tax is causing widespread dis content. Finally there is a report from Mecca to the effect that funds held on trust on account of deceased persons’ estates are, despite the injunctions of the Koran, being used by the Government for its own needs. 15. The fact is that the Government cannot afford the maintenance or a large military establishment which circumstances have forced upon it ; nor can it look for relief until the present situation is liquidated, and what nov forms a large standing army judged by Arabian standards, is effective y 16.

The effect of the visit of the wanted persons to Koweit territory a d their meeting with the British Political Representatiye and their return f ^ Koweit in safety, without having been arrested or sentenced for the prev' r0m crimes of which they were accused, was to spread numerous rumours abouHlf change in the attitude of the British Government and of the Iraq and K • Governments towards these rebels and the breach of the undertaking wht they made to prevent these criminals from taking refuge in, or passing thro al Iraq or Koweit territory and to pursue them with armed forces. ° ^ 3. Your Excellency is not unaware that the Hejaz Government consider, these rebels as criminals, who are to be punished, pursued and arrested who ever they may he found. Their crimes were committed against Iran » i Koweit and their subjects, and accordingly the Hejaz Government consider!

A Rashaidi who states that he arrived this morning from Dawish’s camp reports that on Sunday Awazim from Naairiyeh affected junction with Awazim at Injair and were attacked by insurgent. In action that resulted Mutair were successful and drove back Ibn Saud’s regular troops as far as camp where they captured and drove off practically all Awazim camels. Ajman on other flank were repulsed by Awazim who pursued vigorously till driven back by victorious Mutair. Both sides then returned to their respective camps which they now hold.

Though there is mass of contradictory rumours from accounts ^ by inde- pendent eye-witnesses as well as from report of second of Sheikh s Special watcher, a reliable man who was present during battle greatly fears Bin Sand s Hasa force as represented by Awazim has suffered severe reverse. It is clear however that portion of Awazim were able to rally m vicinity of Injair. These have been surrounded and are still holding out. Dawish after battle sent force south in pursuit of fugitives as well as to deal with Bam Hajir an Zi KhaM reinforcements reported at Sarar Sheikh's eye-witness states slaughter of Awazim left and centre exceeded anything he saw at battles of T tt j* ri TaLrah Mufair who nre blood enemies of Awazim gave Jarrab, Hadiya amlJahrah M'tair who are o o^ d ^ for ? miles who only number 100 all to ^, we .

Reference my No. 566 of 13fch October (Enclo, No. 6), which was post T to Basrah owing to breakdown of telegraph lines. ^ ea First and third of Sheikh’s and my special watcher arrived last from Dawish’s camp. He reports that remainder of Awazim surrendered unconditionally on Friday night, 11th October. They included Braichat Haddaxin and Musahma section under Mubarak al Malaabi and Abdull h Ibn Faishan as well as other survivors. Awazim begged that they be allowed to proceed to Kuwait and take shelter with their old ruler alternative was t joint Akhwan with all their families. Dawish acceded to their request and allowed them temporarily to camp at Barchsa close to Akhwan. Awazim leader may be expected here any moment to beg for shelter and protection from the Sheikh of Kuwait who has decided to grant same. Above has been confirmed by letter from Dawish himself, dated the 9th October and lust received. J Secondly on Saturday, 12th October, Dawish left Bander his son in charee and moved south to round up Turki Abu Ithaar who last reported Shabac south-east of Nta with 808 men awaiting the arrival of Bani Khalid and Bani Hajir. As result of the battle latter have sent messenger to Dawish offering to submit. Thirdly Dawish^ before leaving gave out that after Turki his obiective was Ibn Jiluwi s camels in Habil region afterwards he will hurry to Hoffuf Oatif and Juhail area. ’ ^ Fourthly Al Suhalli escaped with 5 men. Abdulla Al Subaii his second m command was killed. • + ^ if ^ly with destruction of Ibn Saud’s Hasa army Dawish is free to move into Aejd where he will now certainly be joined by many other Neid elements Ajman will be able to deal with anything in Hasa where according 3 to Dawish Thn Sand has nothing further to oppose them with.

Details of the fight have been obtained from the followin g sources (a) Letter from al Duwish to Shaikh Ahmad. (5) The messenger of al Duwish who though not allowed to enter Kuvait was interviewed by Shaikh Ahmad in person and is considered reliable. (c) A reliable Ajman of Kuwait sent by Sheikh Ahmad to watch events. (d) A man of the Beshaida tribe who arrived at Jahra with some looted Awazim camels and gave an intelligent account of the action. No doubt fuller details will be forthcoming later, but I do not think they will affect the general story, though they may modify details. 2. It would appear that on Eriday 4th October the Awash n Southern force, with which were Bin Saud’s regular troops (Sarriya) and other allies such as Bani Hajir and Bani Khalid under the command of Mohomed bin Suhalli, moved, up from Naairiyeh and affected a junction with their advanced troops at Injair (pronounced Ingair). 3. Eaisal al Duwish who up to then had been averse to risking everything on a battle, and was out rather to manoeuvre the Awazim into retiring, sud denly decided to attack. 4. Saturday at dawn was fixed for this and on Eriday evening he moved the Ajman under Hzam al Hithlain and Khalid al Mohomed close in on the right flank of the Awasim (see sketch map attached*). The Mutair forces, including the Ilwa, the Braih under Ibn Ashwan, and detachments of Ibn Mashur and al Bufudi, he concentrated immediately to the North of the Awazim camp. 5. His orders were that as the sun rose the Ajman should commence the attack from the East, and when well engaged, he with the whole Mutair would deliver the main attack. The Mutair mounted troops and the Ajman ditto were to work round the enemy’s left flank and right rear respectively and charge home as they saw opportunity. 6. At about 4 a. m., the Ajman against order precipitated matters by attemptino' to rush the enemy’s right wing, and were at first entirely success ful pushing in the darkness right into the heart of the Awazim camp and cutting up all who opposed them. Beinforcements of Awazim and Bani Khalid however coming up counter attacked and drove the Ajman back with loss and pursued them right back to their camp, a 1,000 yards away where hand to hand fighting continued. 7 At the first streak of dawn Hzam al Hathlain with the Ajman mounted contingent relieved the-situation by coining up and delivering a coarge on the attacking Awazim and Bani.Khalid, and forced them to retire m disorder. In this charge Shaikh Hzam was killed, his place being taken by Khalid al Mohomed (Zebsahman). . , , • 8 At this moment al Duwish who had till then not moved delivered his • , “If with all his forces, on the Awazim left and centre, where were mam on-skught w^h all 11.^61^ ^ Hajir and main body of the Ayazim posted Bin a e( j t 0 the ahl al Ghanam who were opposing Ajman). * Not printed.78 reported to have been almost wiped out. During this attack the Mutair mounted troops fell upon the Awazim rear where the tents and camels were inextricably mixed up and rounding up the latter drove them off the field. The fight ended by Duwish planting his standard in the heart of the Awazim camp in front of al Suhalli’s tent, the survivors of the Awazim retreating Southward to the camp of the Awazim ahl al Ghanam situate about 1,500 yards South of their main camp. Here they reformed, and opened a long range fire on the Mutair and Ajman in occupation of their main camp. 9. At this stage, the whole of the Mutair and Ajman became scattered all over the place in search of loot, and it wuis a case of every man for himself Duwish therefore finding he had no concentrated body to continue the fiaU and pursue the Awazim whc were obviously rallying, decided to move back°to his camp. This apparently both liis force and the Ajman did, leaving nothino- in the main Awazim camp standing, or worth carrying off. 10. Mohomed al Suhalli Bin Sand’s commander seeing the day lost is reported to have ridden away with 4 men, and al-Duwish is said to have remarked that he should be let alone so as to convey the news to his master Ali al-Shuarihat (recently of Baghdad) however pursued with a small bod? 0 f horsemen and is said to have caught him up and killed him with his own hand. 11. The probable strength of the forces engaged are as follows Awazim 3,000 to 3,500 ; Akhwan 3,500. Losses of the Mutair 20 killed (reported by al-Duwish himself) while those of the Awazim including allies and the Ajman -were probably much heavier. They could not have had” less that, 150 killed in each case. 12. It seems pretty clear that the Aw azim lost practically all their camels numbering at least 3,000, but the Akliwum on the other hand expended much ammunition which they cannot replace. So one may say that as far as gains and losses go the honours w^ere even unless the Akhwan got any of the Awazim reserve ammunition in the camp they looted. This is a'possibility as the Awazim are reported to have had a very full supply of British ‘303 S. A. A. 13. At the moment of writing no further news has come in and one does not know how far the Awazim have been able to rally their forces, or whether al-Duwish has attacked them again or drawn off. Bedouin gossip has it that the Atozhu have rallied and that there will be another fight, I am personally inclined to think this is true hut prefer to await further news. 14. The honours obviously went with the Akhwan, but the Awazim as far as I can see have not received by any means a “ knock out ” blow. lo. Further news is hound to come in soon and will be telegraphed you. Enclo.

On the night of the 13th u 0 - 3rd 'er, also a letter from al-Duwish himself to His Excellency Shark i nmad and from these two sources the “ fog ” may be said to have lifted, and the cause of events made clear. Much other corroborative news has also come m through Dhafir, Hashida and Awazim sources to relations among the Hathar of Kuwait* The full story is given below— 3. As was clear from my previous despatch (Enclosure 1), the Mutair broke the Awazim right and centre and carried all before them on the 5th October. The Ajman on the other hand suffered a sharp reverse on the Awazim right wing. The Mutair pursued wildly for a matter of 7 miles, their horsemen numbering some 550 causing much execution among fugitives. On giving up their immediate pursuit of fleeing Awazim and loose camels, the Mutair returned to find Ajman still engaged with the Awazim and pressing them back. The latter had rallied in their subsidiary camp (see original plan sent) which was much closer to the main wells of Ingair than originally reported, and were putting up a fine resistance. The Awazim had dug trenches everywhere and as daylight came on their fight become more severe. Both Mutair and Ajman from all sides then attacked and opened a tremendous fire into the camp of the Awazim which contained women and children, camels, sheep, etc., etc., closely and inextricably mixed up. It was this fire which caused so many casualties among the Awazim animals and women and children. 4. Al-Euwish at noon called off the attack, mainly because his forces were out of hand and had scattered in their efforts to round up the Awazim camels. It might be mentioned that the Awazim women, when the Mutair attack was at its height i loosed nearly all their camels in the hope they would escape and be recovered later. These to the number of nearly 8,000 were rounded up by the Aklrwan. 5. On Sunday 6th October all was quiet, though al-Duwish with his mounted men arranged that no one should come to or leave the Awazim camp. 6. On Monday 7th October the Awazim sent in a man of the Zaab to treat for surrender. As a preliminary he asked al-Duwish if the Awazim could move camp to al-Batchsa, wells close to, and to the South-East o Ingair, as the stench of dead men, camels and sheep was very great and the water was poluted. Al-Duwish agreed and likewise moved his own Ajman and Mutair camps to Um al Hzam, a place commanding Batchsa. The moves of both forces were completed by Thursday, 10th October. 7. On the same day, i.e., Thursday, the 10th October, I'uw^h sent in and demanded that the Awazim leaders come to his camp and discuss t surrender 8. This was agreed to and on Friday, 11th October al-Fuqm with 3 men proceeded to the° Awazim camp and escorted Mubarak al Milaabi and Abdullah ibn Faishan the leading Shaikhs back to al-Duwis . q Throughout Friday, 10th the conference took place, and much speech making was indulged in ol both sides which it is Suffice to say ai-Duwish blamed the Awazim for b g g dear warnings on their own heads and asked God o wi ness . to Hassa to them to retire as l ^ r ^'^waztohad chosen to refuse and had preferred was very awkward. Iliey tne a. ^ alternative but to remove to obey Bin Sand’s commands, so he had ha . , ^ d that they deserv- their threat by force.

On Friday night 11th, the Awazim surrendered ; al-Duwish allowi them to retain their arms, property, camels and sheep not actually taken i the battle. Al-Duwish further offered the Awazim two alternatives D (a) That they should retire North well away from his rear, and ent Kuwait territory if they could make their peace with the Shaikh of Kuwait. (Jb) With their fighting men joir the Akhwan in their future opera tions, leaving their women and flocks with those of the Akhwan The Awazim chose the former, and asked al-Duwish to write to the Shaikh of Kuwait and explain their case. The latter did this on the spot, and the Awazim Shaikhs armed -with this letter are probably now en route to the Kuwait frontier to beg asylum from Shaikh Ahmad. The Awazim asked for 20 day’s grace before they took their families North in order to bury dead attend to wounded and collect fugitives. Al-Duwish who seems to have shown remarkable magnanimity all through, at once granted their request. 11. At dawn on Saturday 12th al-Duwish, al-Fuqm and al-Bufidi moved South to try and round up Turki abu Ithaar. As a guard over their camp and to watch the Awazim, Bandar, Duwish’s son, Ibn Mashur, and Naif al- Hathlain were left behind. 12. Al-Duwish before starting gave out that he had not much hope of catching Turki but he intended rounding up Bani Khalid, Bani Haiir and then proceeding against Bin Jaloui’s camels in the Habil region North of Hoffutf Afterwards he w ould deal with Hoffuff, Qatif and Jubail, by w 7 hich I think e meant “ areas not “ towns ”, for it is obvious he would only tie himself up if he started besieging these places.

Abdullah further ordered to get from Dawish verbally or in writing exactly what he desires to say, and to tell him it would be reported to His Majesty’s Government. If latter then thought it necessary to send Sheikh and myself to interview him ; this would be done in his own camp and not anywhere inside Koweit territory. Ends.

Comes of a Yemeni family said to be of a certain importance, which has been established for the last century at Damascus. He is a graduate of the Turkish Military College and was a captain in the Turkish army. He was for many years the secretary 0 f the Great Senussi, and accompanied 8 v ed Senussi to Nejd and later to Mecca, t Here he became appointed Bais-ed Diwan of Naib-el-Am in Mecca. This post however, he surrendered in favour of employment as Ibn Sand’s propagandist and unofficial agent abroad In this capacity he visited India in 1926. after wards visiting Germany, where he is reported to have had relations with soviet agents. Apparently ovvdng to the King’s distrust of his activities at this juncture, or possibly considering it expedient to disown him, a notice was published in the “ TJimel-Qura ” stating that Tewfik Bey Sherif was in Ger many as a merchant, and had no connexion with the Hejaz Government. The local Hejaz officials, however, bad no doubts as to the fact of his employment especially as Tewfik Bey Sherif was known to be still sending confidential reports to the King and to the Emil Eaisal at Mecca. Although a Syrian, he has privately declared himself to be opposed to Euad Hamza, Yussuf Yassin and the other Syrian opportunists in the country whom he accuses of dishonesty and whom he considers to have a malevolent influence on the King, particularly so far as Ibn Saud’s relations with his Majesty’s Government are concerned. He professes great concern for the future of Arabia and regret at the neglect of the country’s real interests under the Saudian regime, which, he declares, is now no better than that of Kin® Hussein.

Reference my secret No. 546, dated 24th September 1929 (Enclosure 1 to Serial No. 116). v His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad also reported this morning that a Shaikh Trad ibn Sattam al Shaalao of Anaza (Syria) had arrived in Kuwait yesterday and had called on him. He had not divulged the reason of his visit yet, but it was obvious he came with a message for al-Duwish. 3. Paragraph (l) and (2) above read in connection with Hillal al Mutairi’s statement as reported in paragraph 6 of my letter referred to above are Illuminati; g s t think. 4. During his talk with me His Excellency said he was afraid things were going to get worse for Bin Saud before long, and if the latter did not make a very big effort soon, he feared a series of new enemies would arise and join Duwish against him. When 1 asked who these were, Shaikh Ahmad replied that he had had it from Ali al Shuwairbat when he passed through a few days ago, that King Eaisal had secretly sent for all the Shammar refugee Shaikhs to Baghdad —vide Kuwait Diary No. 17, paragraph 136—including Ajil al Yawar (Shammar Jarba) and Agab ibn Ajil (Shammar Abda), and had called them cowards for not rising against Bin Saud and making themselves masters of Hail, that the time was now ripe for action and if they did not move they deserved to be slaves for all time. That when the Shammar Shaikhs excused themselves pleading their fear of al-Duwish, he the King had said, “ Have no p . t i j ft khafun Duwish andhi Y’ fear, I have arranged things with al-Duwish (‘ lat V Thev then replied that they would not move till the cold weather set in and that if in the meantime Bin Saud did not bring about a change in the situa tion, they the Shammar would act and throw in their lot with the insurgents. 5. His Excellency said he had not paid much attention to the above as he thought rather libellous story, at the time, but that it had now been corroborat ed by Hillal al Mutairi, in rather remarkable fashion Stiaikh Ahmad then proceeded to tell me exactly what Hillal had reported to me as “ most secret information. (Vide paragraph 6 of my No. 546, Enclosure 1 to Serial No. 116). 6. From the above there would appear some, reason to suppose that al-Duwish is in touch with the Sheerifian party and is making efforts through them to get Shammar and Anaze to come m as allies by offering them Hail and Jauf respectively. 7 His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad is, it wouM seem, of the above opinion } cautious about stating his views. He made one curious remark to me, which is worth recording also but is obviously cautious about stating his views. He made one curious remark to me which is worth recording. “ Remember a -Duwish is a grea poWkian “he said “ there is no question of Din behmd tins r jbellm; what CTshIs playing for is the downfall of the house of Saud and the rise of him- feral-DuXhbn Bin Sand’s place, with success Z rd and now he hopes to become master of Nejd, a . , ?&gt; we if the Hejaz returns to the Shereefian family or Had BmRaseh d . 8.

On or about 18th July a party of Mawahit tribe of Hedjaz lead by Ghobn Al-Herfi and Zaidan al Herfi raided a caravan of Transjordan Bani Atiya in Hedjaz territory near Mudawwara carrying off 52 camels loaded with grain and personal effects of the following six Bani Atiya persons who were killed namely Baraj al Asufi Salman al Asufi, Azm al Hayyani, Roueiee Salama al. attar Sulaiman el Mahu- hat, and Husain Bin Salama. On 19th September a caravan under the control of Ealih al Luwaifi al Hamdan al Azimi of Transjordan was attacked by a party of sixty camel- men belonging partly to Eid Bin Rammal’s section of Shammar partly Saad al Eaqir’s section of Aneiza and partly to Walad Daifan’s section of Shararat. The attack was in the vicinity of Nebk. Loot taken 10 camels and three rifles. On 25th September a party of Hedjaz tribesmen crossed to Transjordan territory near Mudawwara at a place known as Ghadir Abu Suwwan and carried off 800 sheep and 150 camels belonging to Takatka and Zalabia tribes ot Transjordan together with all their tents.

It is very doubtful if the dhow traffic from the African to the Arabian Coast in the vicinity of Perim mentioned in previous reports on Slave Trade, does in fact exist. It i s a t certain as anything can be that no dhow, either of an innocent or illicit character, crossed the Straits during the three weeks that “ Clematis ” w as at Perim and it is not until one gets North, near the Hanish Islands, that the African trade is met with at all. It is from there Northward that the dhow trade, augmented by the coastal traffic of the Arabian ports between Jeddah and Hodeida, is met with in any degree. For every dhow encountered between Perim and Hanish Islands, three are met with in the area further North. Between 5 August and 19 August, patrol was continued as stated. Two short visits were paid to Perim during this period to rest ship’s company and clean Boiler. Great Hanish Island was visited from 13th to loth August Aden was visited on 10th August. Mails at Perim were received by air from Aden on 29th Julv and 19th August. The recent institution by E. A. F. of sending every lo 14 days mails by air to Perim and Kamaran, has been found a great convenience. Aden.—In conversation with Political Eesident, Aden, Sir Stewart Symes, he informed me that the political results of the recent visit of H. M. S. “ Dahlia ” to Mokha and Hodeida has been most satisfactory. He requested me, however, not to arrange further visits to Yemen Ports without previously consulting him. (Commanding Officer H. M. S. “Dahlia” has been so informed.) This was, of course, done in the case of “ Dahlia’s ” visit, but the idea generally is, that while this one visit is desirable as a “ gesture ”, until the Imam at Sanaa has approached the British Government with a view to the renewml of relations on a proper basis, we must avoid making ourselves “ cheap ” and throwing ourselves at him. The opinion prevailing at Aden at present is very optimistic. One or two “ feelers ” have been thrown out from Sanaa, but nothing definite. There seems reason to believe that it is only a question of time when the Imam’s bands may be torced by events and that he will decide to throw in his lot 'with us. He would like to. do so now and feels that he has backed the wrong horse, His conn ry is destitute owing to a corrupt administration, whilst in comparison the prosperity of the neighbouring tribes, friendly to Great Britain, in the Aden Protectorate is increasing daily. Further, the Zaraniques, who ave a ways beon a thorn in his side, are more than maintaining their m epen e ^ c e.

Subject to the views of Mr. Secretary Henderson and of the Secretary of State for India and the Air Council who are also being consulted, Lord Passfield does not consider it necessary to oppose the decision of the Shaikh of Kuwait to afford shelter to the remainder of the Awazim tribe. To acquiesce in the Shaikh’s decision would seem in no way inconsistent with the attitude hitherto adopted by Hi s Majesty’s Government. King Ibn Saud has been informed that his forces may not cross the frontiers ot Kuwait or Iraq and he has been assured that the rebel tribes will be denied refuge in those territories The Awazim, having surrendered to Faisal al Dawish can scarcely be regarded as part of King Ibn Saud’s forces, nor can they be regarded as insurgents since it is apparent that they have no desire or intention to take any further part in the revolt. In Lord Passfield’s opinion the Awazim may reasonablv be regarded as a loyal tribe who have suffered at the hands of the rebels for their loyalty to King Ibn Saud, and there is thus no obligation on the part of His Majesty’ Government to see that the remnant of the tribes are refused shelter in Kuwait. Lord Passfield would be glad to learn whether Mr Handerson concurs in this view. 3. I am, however, to suggest that in order to forestal any possible protest from King Ibn Saud against the action contemplated by the Shaikh of Kuwait in the matter,, it would be well for the British Agent at Jeddah to inform the Hejaz Government of the circumstances in which it is proposed that the remnant of the Awazim tribe should be allowed to take refuse in Kuwait. 4. Copies of this letter are being forwarded to the India Office and Air Ministry. (120) Memorandum from the British Agent and Consul Jeddah, No. 2212/ 1456/56, dated the 18th October 1929.

The Ataibah tribes may be subdued tempoi an)y by minor operations such as those to which X have referred, but there are seveial sections among them who are always ready to give trouble if the emeus are favourable. 4. News of the Awazim defeat has not yet apparently reached Jeddah. It is possible that this communique was issued in order to counteract the effect of any rumours that may filter through. 5.

Press Bureau. The Military expedition under the leadership of the Emir Khalid son of the Emir Mohammed and the military expedition under the leadership of Khalid ibn Lowai and Mohammed ibn Sib.my has completed the punitive action against the remainder of the fugitive criminals, who were pursued by the detachments until they were destroyed to a man and the country cleansed of their evils. In view of the desire of His Majesty the King to take decisive steps regarding those insurgents who surrendered after their compact, their breach of faith, then their defeat, he decided that a consultative assembly should meet at the village of Shaara, at which His Majesty should himself he present. Accordingly His Majesty the King left Riyadh on Monday 27th Rabi Tani 1348 (1st October 1929) for Shaara where a conference was held. It was attended by a gathering of Ulemas, chieftains and leaders of the Ataibah, Qahtan Harb and others, so that they might be consulted as to what should he done with those individuals. The conference made the following decisions which were immediately put into effect : (11 The confiscation of the possessions of the survivors of those who took part in the rebellion, on their being condemned to capital punishment. _ The taking of all warlike implements (riding camels, horses aiU 2 rifles) from every person accused of supporting the dissidents and of disobeying the call to fight against them. (3) The eviction of all the fugitives who gave way to disaffection and ( } thdr distribution among other tribes, thus preventing them trom settling together in one place. „ , r (4) The rewarding of the loyal combatants by the distribution ot the rebels’ confiscated property among them. (5) The execution of these decisions in the course of ten days.It happened that His Majesty had given orders to the majority of the forces to march towards the neighbourhood of the area where the defeated Mutair and Ajman rebels were, in order to put an end to their disaffection and to make an example of them. The Almighty however had facilitated matters before the commencement of the punitive action against these criminals and therefore it is not known what His Majesty’s decision will be after His receiving the news that the forces which were encircling the rebels on every J side had succeeded in exterminating and destroying them and had killed then- leader Feisaled Doweish himself. Thus everything, thank God, has ended according to what was desired.

Koseir .—Visits exchanged with the local Mamur. Koseir is, however a bad harbour and host work was difficult. A railway is under construction from Keneh on the Nile to Koseir. £30,000 has been voted as a first instalment this year and work is to be completed in three years. In addition, it is understood there are to be Harbour developments at Koseir and the town re-planned and re-built. The objects are a direct route from the East for tourist traffic to Luxor and Upper Nile, and to ^— 1 — ,1 fish and coal trade inwards and possibly the grain and outwards. The original intention was for this to have been a now been made i y develop the cotton trade was for this to have been a narrow gauge railway, but it is believed a decision has now been made that it shall be broad gauge so as to link up with the Egyptian State Railways. Port Sudan. —Arrived p.m. 19th July, a.m. 21st July received instruc tions from you in connection with S.

Previous to sailing, signals were made to British Consul at Jeddah, asking him to facilitate my visit with the Authorities, and to British Consul, Port Said, requesting information of passage through Suez Canal of “ Falkenfels ” if possible. On 23rd July patrolled in vicinity of Lat. 2P30-N.

A report on this matter was made to you by signal and further report will be forwarded when details are received from the British Consul at Jeddah who has promised to keep me informed of any develop ments. 2. It is understood that the recent inspection by Wing Commander Stent, R. A. F., carried out at the request of the Hejaz Government, of the aircraft (four ?) in number, British which have been in store at Jeddah for the last three years, has shown these craft to be in a surprisingly satisfactory and airworthy condition. Proceedings are on foot to engage four British Pilots and six Mechanics to re-organise this force. These proceedings, if successful, may mean an order for new aeroplanes. The present ones, owing to small radiator capacity, are unable to operate effectively during the hot weather. 3. Tobacco duty has been increased from 40 to 80 per cent, and Benzine duty from 17 to 50 per cent. It is anticipated considerable smuggling will result. Preventive Vessel “ Bakura ” mentioned in my Report of Proceed ings, No. 114—78 of 11th June 1929 (enclosure to Serial No. 23), has not yet arrived. It is not stated that she is arriving in August from England, from Messrs. Thorneycroft, and that a further one follows :— 4. Mr. Philby is also in England, where, hearsay, states he is endeavour ing to obtain an appointment through friends in the new Government. Jeddah-Perim. —S.S. “ Falkenfels ” sailed from Jeddah 13-30, 26th July. As it appeared probable from information contained in Aden Political Ink Hi- gence Summary No. 128, paragraph 970 (File No. 34-N.-29), and from other Sources, that “ Falkenfels ” might put into Hodeida, I considered it desirable to keep in touch with her on my passage to Perim. “Clematis^ sailed therefore at 14-30, 26th July, leaving harbour by a different rome.b. b. “iFalkenfels ” was kept in sight throughout the passage to Pe ™f’ a varying between 2^ to 11 miles.

Bin Saud had ordered them to raid ’Iraq and uwait times without number and as soldiers they had carried Thn ^ t0 1 letter ‘ - 1 here inter i e cted that perhaps P5m baud had not himself given the orders, but that they had taken their instructions from some one else. This they hotly denied saying that the Akhwan leaders accepted no orders except from Bin Sand’s own mouth.) (b) fhen came the English they said who began to complain to Bin Saud and started demanding back stolen sheep, camels, etc. To this Bin Saud gave answer that they his Akhwan were out of hand and he could not very well control them. Actually he again and again had ordered them to continue their raiding and took the “ khumus ” 1-5 of all the loot they got. (c) Eventually under pressure from the English Bin Saud had demand, ed that they should hand back their share of the loot to him- and he would return same to ’Iraq. Their reply to him had been “ Yes we will do this and loyally obey your orders but you must do likewise as our leader ”. They had also wanted to know how it was that while it suited his convenience he Bin Saud had quoted to them by chapter and verse from the Koran, the virtue of jehad and attacking non-Akhwan and Mushriq tribes, and how it was that he was now asking them to return to the infidel what he had preached was lawful; they demanded that Bin Saud should explain this. Bin Saud for his part had promised to explain all to them at Sabillah, and when they went there, by a gross piece of teachery, he had attacked them, killed several of their leaders on the spot, wounded al-Duwish (and incidentally taken his seal) and lastly had cast Ibn Humaid of the Ataiba into prison where he was now languish- ing. (d) Not satisfied with this Bin Saud had sent Eahad bin Jaloui to seize Dhaidan bin Hathlain one of the big three Akhwan leaders who had not attended the Conference. When Ibn Hathlain refused to come and meet Fahad, the latter sent him a letter giving “ the oath of God ” that he only wished to see him and discuss matters, and that he would send him back safe Against the wishes of the tribal leaders and particularly against his Hazam al-Hathlain’s advice Dhaidan went and met Fahad Thereupon he was treacherously seized and cast into irons and Interhad his throat cut by Fahad’s own hand, shortly after he Hazam had attacked Fahad’s camp in order to save his cousin. Pod had punished Fahad for his treachery by means of him God had pm carrving out the orders of his ““ ^r it0 ai ^nt^rot fSIo tLdan giving him « hath wa ■Rakht ” in the name of God). k x nf treacherv they added and the general (e) The two above a ^ ots ^ , 0 f the English by Bin Saud whose playing ^“^^tl/L^mehld stirred up the whole of servant he had app y d n to throw off his the Akhwan of north Najd. a ^ ^ ^ . n ^ ea ^ yoke.

(c) F&amp;PD(f) Here I asked where Bin Saud was, and the reply was : “he has U ^ been forced back to the Hejaz, he cannot reach either Qasim or Riath, only 4 days ago, special messangers reached us from Oahtan Ataiba and Harb to the effect that they had been completely successful in blocking the way from Hejaz.” (a) I asked if it was true that they were moving south from Wafra * and Shathaf. They said perfectly true, and half of them had already moved off. (h) I asked what were their intentions with the Awazim: al-Fuqm V 7 replied that they had sent them an offer to “ Tudaiyan ” (join the Akhwan) or be attacked. They have as yet had no reply, but they had heard that Awazim had retired towards Hoffuf. * (i) To my query, as to what their losses had been at al-Ritha, (where they had attacked the Awazim) al-Fuqm replied “ 22 men killed no Shaikhs hurt on either side To their regret their rifle fire had killed several women among the Aw r azim, but that was pure accident, as the Awazim were closely packed in Zeraba formation when they received their attack. (j) When I asked if it was true that they had raided as far as “ Saud al-Rimadan “ Abu Jiffan ” and “Bamban” close to Riath, they replied “ Yes and we have brought back much loot and many of Bin Sand’s own camels ”. (1c) When I questioned them as to what they really wanted from me, they at last came to the point and said that they came for two things:— (i) They the Akhwan desired to enter into a sort of treaty engage ment with the British, the treaty to be formally written out and signed by their leaders: in the document they would promise to remain on friendly terms with Iraq, and Kuwait, and would undertake not to attack either Govern- ment or raid any of their tribes. (ii) In return they desire to be allowed to make use of Kuwait and to purchase supplies and munitions from it. (l) Kuwait had been their port from time immemorial. They looked upon themselves as Kuwait tribes and only wished to return to their own. They thought they were strong enough to be called a small nation now and just as Kuwait had done, they wished to make a direct treaty with the British, if possible. (m) When I told them that their’s was quite an impossible request and under no circumstances whatever could His Majesty’s Government do such a thing, they naively asked if they could come under the Shaikh of Kuwait’s jurisdiction. To this I also gave a negative reply. ( 71 ) I was then asked to explain exactly the British Government’s wishes as some of their friends would not be able to understand why their offer of friendship was refused. I replied in detail to the effect that as the Akhwan were in open rebellion againsi their Ruler and that as their Ruler was our friend and in treaty relations with us, we could not but stand by him, and had promised to assist in the following way :— (i) By denying supplies to them, the rebel Akhwan. (ii) By refusing them entry, under any circumstances whatever, into either Kuwait or Iraq territory. (°) I added that neither Shaikh Ahmad nor I desired their blood or that of their women on our heads, but that as sure as they attempted to put foot across the border they would be bombed. Beyond this the British Government had no concern, and they w ould be quite safe anywhere across the border.{p) I finally added that the Shaikh of Kuwait was only carrying out His Majesty’s Government’s orders, and that any denial of supplies was not his fault but ours. (q) To their rather foolish request about making a treaty with us, I pointed out the absurdity of such talk. Their fight was with Bin Saud our friend. We were lookers on merely, when the fight was over there would doubtless be other talk, whichever side came out successful. I however warned them to make their peace with Bin Saud before it was too late. They appeared rather amazed than otherwise at this. (r) Throughout our talk both Shaikhs were extremely friendly and at the end of my exposition of the situation al-Fuqm thanked me and exclaimed : “ We know we should get the truth from you, English, who are like us Akhwan. We quite see the attitude of the Shaikh of Kuwait and excuse him entirely. We also see the English point of ^view and your desire to keep out of Najd quarrels. Let us leave it at that. Perhaps, if God wills and when we have done with the House of Saud you will have other advise and talk for us : in the meantime tell your Government that they need have nothing to fear from us Akhwan now, either in the direction of Iraq or Kuwait. This closed our interview and I returned to the town. (s) The impression I gathered was that the Akhwan were beginning to feel the pinch of hunger, though none of them showed it One argument they brought forward and which X have not mentioned above was to the effect that they recognised we had every right to stop ammunition and rifles from coming to t m but that surely we had no right to stop food from their women and * children'who were very many. ‘‘God will not agree to this” (Allah ma yikbal fi hatha) they said.

Letter from the Political Agent, Kuwait, to the Hon’ble the Politi cal Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, No. 537, dated the 18th September 1929. (Confidntial). Situation in Hassa and Nejd. Reference your telegram No. 914, dated the 14th September 1929, quoting al-Qosaibi’s claim in Bahrain that— (a) Azaiyiz with 600 of al-Duwish’s men had been destroyed to a man by Ibn M’saad. (b) That al-Duhaina the insurgent leader sent by al-Duwish to Qassim had been killed with 700 men. I have the honour to say that I think al-Qosaibi in his anxiety to give out good news, has exagerated. This is a mistake and will only harm his master’s cause when the full facts become known. 2. As regards (a) please see my No. 936 of 12th September. From the last remark it will be seen that al-Qosaibi got his news from Hl-Nafisi of th's Town, who coloured his news to the extent that he reported “ no survivors ” at all. Actually, here in Kuwait we have not yet received a correct account of the engagement, so the true tale of Azaiyiz’s defeat is not known. One thing is known however, it is that— (a) the original force numbered 500 ; (b) en route to Lauqa, 100 men were sent back in charge of two large bodies of raided camels. (c) Faisal al-Shiblan’s detachment numbered about 80 and 1(H) survivors have definitely returned to Wafra. This leaves 320 with Azaiyiz unaccounted for. Personally I am of opinion that Azaiyiz did not escape and that he with 320 men were killed. We shall hear the truth no doubt in a few days. Ibn M’saad’s success was the result of clever work, and he brought off his coup by filling up certain wells, and denying the water of Umer Rudhumma to a weary and very thirsty force as represented by Azaiyiz raiders. These fought to get to the water but failed. 3. As regards (5). The news here is that a]-Duhaina is very much alive and is creating a lot of trouble but as this comes from insurgent sources, it must be accepted with caution. Bin Saud himself says nothing about his eath m a long letter dated 30th August which Shaikh Ahmad received by as up mail) 13th September 1929). This letter was a particularly friendly one and a precis of it is given in the following paragraphs :— (а) He thanked the Shaikh of Kuwait for so kindly entertaining Abdur Rahman Qosaibi and for the messages sent him by that individual. (б) He hoped before long to personally arrange a meeting with his ’ n k rc j^k er the Shaikh of Kuwait. He -would arrauge the date later (Shaikh Ahmad knows nothing about this meeting). (c) He would long ago have set out on his expedition to punish the insurgents, but the heat was too great. (d) The people of Nejd proper and Qassim had recently refused to provide troops, wherewith to attack the Akhwan in Hassa, •T/i CUS ? being country was so disturbed in thier nnast that he Bin Saud must first settle the trouble at home betore asking them to move to a distance, («) That al-Ihdiaina sent by Faisal al-Duwish was creating a lot of rou ,e in Qassim, but he had several forces engaged in trying o ring him to action, including a force sent from Hejaz by is son haisal. Until this person was “settled” there could &lt; be no more north.46 (/) had'ndeed surprised al-Buhaina once and taken ing much mischief ““ lmSelf WaS StiU at large and creat ’ cerned^th d afflirfne e ^rhn lilie e’i t T 0uH seem that Bin Saud is too con- tion against “u expedi - rfnnhi^hr +1 Vi • ? nt ® y et ’ Shaikh Ahmad states there un- fs conffrmW thk At tk ® “ Aa ? ed and Qassim and reads Bin Saud ’ s letter if lii k to sale t-- A ^ th am ? tlme ’ sa y s Shaikh Ahmad, Bin Sand must next month o! two g ’ ° ne big efi ° rt t0 tackle al -Buwish, in the q J?’ 7^ e va rious rumours from Mecca, London and elsewhere that Bin Saud s forces were converging on the rebels, etc., are so much “ moonshine ” ai J. . on Jy ^ e . d 110 ^ 8 ^ by the rebels as examples of the stupid lies with which Bin Saud is trying to bolster up his cause. 6. The actual position of Bin Saud’s forces to-day is as follows :—- (a) The “ Awazim ” tribe are at Mulaija (8 miles North of Nta) under Mubarak Ibn Drai and Ibn Jami. They are assisted by con tingents of Bani Khalid, al-Manassir, Bani Hajir, Qahtan and Sahool—(all small). Also by a detachment of 250/300 of Bin Saud’s regulars (sarraya). The whole force numbers about 2,500 and is hampered by the un-numberable women and children of the Awazim. (b) There is nothing at Haffar al Atz though the pro-Bin Saudites like to think there is. (c) At Ajibba is camped Ibn M’saad with the original concentration he has had all along (Shammar, al-Harb and a contingent of Hathar from the Qassim towns). Total about 2,500. Ibn M’saad has not sent, nor does he contemplate moving up any of his forces to Haffar al-Batin, as far as one can see. Such force would be too exposed to a sudden attack. The stories circulated from Hassa that Abdulla Bin Abdur Rahman as-Saud has arrived al-Awainat South of Nta with a large force in support of the Awazim, is also not true in my opinion, nor is it confirmed from any reliable source. 7 It will be seen from the above that the insurgents under al-Duwish have only one hostile force at all threatening them. This is the Awazim. These latter are already in a dangerously exposed position and may be attacked any moment by the combined Mutair and Ajman. As a matter of fact it is rumoured that they have been recalled from their forward position by direct orders from Bin Saud, and may retire any day now. Their trouble is that further south grazing and water is bad. 8 As for al-Duwish, for the moment he is fattening and resting his j oia And as the da vs are much cooler the latter are going horses and camels And as f ^ 3 th were able to do sometime rf^dS^ S^-lr exists.

He had therefore mentioned the whole matter to Hillalal Mutairi who, as you know, never loses touch with his old tribe the Mutair. He had also shown him the copy of Faisal’s letter which I had presented to him, Shaikh Ahmed. Hdlal who at the time supported Shaikh Ahmad in his views, it seems wrote to ad-Duwish and taxed him with the matter. The latter has applied swearing as big an oath as he can (by his religion and by his wives honour and his own) that he never used the expression “ chicken ” at all, and that his only letter to Amir Sand was in reply to one received, and was a short statement only of why he left Artawiyeh, nothing more. Faisal ad-Duwish added that the letter complained of was an obvious forgery and especially as his opponents were in possession of his seal (taken, as reported, at Sabilla). Faisal asked Hillal al Mutairi to inform both Shaikh Ahmad and the Colonel Dickson of this answer of his.

I (c) F&amp;PD49 The party had consisted of four trusty henchmen of Shaikh Ahmad in. eluding the chief messenger who is locally renowned for speaking out his mind:— (a) The party reached Raith 7 days before Bin Saud arrived there They were seized by the “ Braih ” at Hafar al Batin on their T way south, but were released at the intervention of one of Bin Sand’s officers. (b) On his arrival, Bin Saud was kind to them, but continually talked “ big ” of what he was going to do at the end of “ Rabia al Awal ” (25th of August) with the insurgents in Hassa. (c) The party found a vast gathering of Southern Bedouin at Riath and these Bin Saud was feeding freely with food and gifts. R e also was disbursing arms and ammunition in quantities. They were struck with the fact that there were very few important Shaikhs in Riath. Among those they saw or heard of were Ibn Shuqail (al-Muhamad), Mishari al-Musaiyis (Braih), Naif ibn Maziad, Faisal al-Dewish’s protege at Artawiyeh. 'These three latter Bin Saud was keeping more or less under restraint their following having been ordered to return home. (d) Bin Saud told my informant that Saud his son (Abu Sharrain) had gone to Hassa for a 10 days’ tour. (Since confirmed bv tele gram from Saud to the Shaikh of Kuwait, dated 10th August 1929). My informant could not say if Saud was going to replace Abdul Aziz al-Turki as Commander of Troops in Hassa or was merely going to visit Bin Jaloui and report on his condition. (e) All the members of the Saud family were with the King except Faisal his son. (/) No Ataiba Shaikhs were seen with Bin Saud. My informant could not understand the absence of these. {g) My informant’s opinion was that Bin Saud was making clear pre parations for a Bedouin campaign against the rebels, but all depended on whether Ataiba chiefs would play “ straight ”. {h) Bin Saud’s information regarding rebels appeared poor : for inst ance he had no idea when they, the, 1 ihessengers, left on 1st August that k aisal al Duwish had left Hassa for an unknown destination, and only on 2nd August when they were a day out ot Riath did express messengers pass them going North to warn everyone that al-Duwish was on the war path. {i) On their return journey to Kuwait the party crossed the tracks i° n S Th ese were heavy and well marked and lea feouth. Numbers were estimated at two or three thousand. (j) Acting on the previous instructions of Shaikh of Kuwait, the chief messenger asked Bin Saud in Riath if he would accept the surren er o the insurgents if he, Shaikh Ahmad, could arrange n . m Saud had given him a definitely negative reply. {&amp;) Similarly under orders the chief messenger had upbraided Bin au or is continuous harsh and unfriendly treatment M QntTf At nd J d ? m ? ,nded in the na me of “ Allah ” to know what •i 1 j..

A copy of the Political Agent’s telegram No. 486, dated 19th August, to which he refers, was enclosed with my letter No. 48, dated 22nd August. 2. The continued embassies to Kuwait and the attempt to send Ibn Mashur to Baghdad show that the Akhwan are realising their unenviable situation. Unless they can rouse the Ataibah Faisal ed-Dawish is bound to be defeated. In that event Iraq or Kuwait must expect a mass immigration of the Aj man or Mutair Aiwa accompanied by their women and children. 3. It is for the decision of His Majesty’s Government what action should be taken in such an event. The Royal Air Force have orders to exclude refugees flying from Ibn Saud’s army, but presumably these orders apply to the fighting men, especially Faisal-bin-Dawish and his chief followers. It will be impossible to take “ air action ” against women and children, and unless some measures are devised His Majesty’s Government will lay them selves open to Ibn Saud’s reproaches. 4. In the meantime, as Colonel Dickson’s letter shows, a large movement of the insurgent’s herds across the Kuwait border into Subaihiyah may be expected. Copies of this letter and of its enclosure are being sent to the Govern* ment of India, His Excellency the High Commissioner for Iraq and His Majesty’s Agent and Consul at Jeddah.

In continuation of my No. 486, dated the 19th August 1929, I have the honour to make the following remarks Ibn Mashur is acting for ham North reference) hag made it The latter in his letter to Shaikh Ahm d^ ^d^ ^khwan Shaikhs, and clear that he is speaking for 11 th camels to Subaihiyeh to graze, that adds that so keen are these to g Mashurl and are prepared to renew they have sent their seals to him ( b as we ll as give another their promise not to ™ d L heir camels as soon as Bin Saud shows undertaking in writing to remo This to allay any suspicions on sign of “f™f c h a Ce^wffi U make use'of Subaihiyeh as a sort of house of StnttoThoSesrear the horde.Shaikh Ahmad says that the Ajman and Mutair to-day have vast heard** of camels congregated in North Hassa, and the grazing in consequence is getting scarcer and scarcer. The Akhwan see just over the border the hitherto untouched grazing grounds of Subaihiyeh and the temptation to cross the border is almost beyond endurance. As Shaikh Ahmad prettiM puts it, “ They look upon Subaihiyeh to-day as more desirable to get to than the Holy Kaaba itself ”. This year no camels of the Bin Subah or anyone else have grazed at Subaihiyeh, so camel food is luxuriant.

(Secret). « •J'rJn° f t 1 ? y N °' 537, dated 18th September 1929 (Enclo 2 to Serial No. 57) and my telegram No. 542, dated 21st September 1929 I have the honour « report a very interesting conversation with Shaikh' Hillal al Mutain which I had yesterday the 23rd September 1929. This individual as you kn w resides in Kuwait and is probably the wealthiest man m the Persian Gulf to-day. He maintains, at all timesf the closest ouc with Nejd, and more particularly with Faisal al Duwish and Ibn Ashwan the two most important Rebel Leaders. With the former because of a life long friendship between them, and with the latter because Ibn Ashwan is the head of Shaikh Hillal’s own tribe the Mutair (Braieh). 2. Shaikh Hillal al Mutairi’s knowledge of affairs in Central Arabia generally, and especia ly his knowledge of Desert politics and the things that the great Bedouin tribes are thinking of and discussing, is in my opinion unique, and being a man of 70 years old with mind still active and strong, whatever he has to say is usually tempered with judgement and common sense. 3. In politics Shaikh Hillal is a Mutairi tribesman first, secondly a Kuwaiti pearl merchant, and loyal subject of the al Subah. Lastly, he is, and always has been, an anti-Bin Saudite and as such his sympathies are entirely with the Rebels. Being however, as I said above a man of long views and clear perspective, his appreciations of situations are nearly always sound. 4. Shaikh Hillal arrived from his estates on the Shatt al-Arab on 21st September 1929 where incidentally he received on 16th September 1929 as visitors Mutrij Ibn Hijna (Ataiba) and Rihan Ibn Marwi (Mutairi) both resident in Transjordan. These individual according to the Special Service Officer, Basrah’s report No. I/BS/1, dated 17th September 1929, paragr ph (a) brought letters from Abdullah al Misfir, who holds an important position in the palace at Baghdad. There would appear to be a connection between the visit of these men and items of news mentioned in paragraph 6 below. 5. In his conversation w : th me Shaikh Hillal imparted the following in formation which is given below in the form of sub-paragraphs : (a) Azaiyiz the son of al Duwish was undoubtedly killed at Umel Rudhumma but with him not more than 250 men. The incident is looked upon as a regrettable incident and will in no wmy affect the plans of al Duwish. (b) Al Duwish had mobilized the Ajman and Mutair and was at the moment of writing moving South against the Awazim. Al Duwish had deliberately allowed the Awazim to hear o his movements in order to convey the impression that he intended attacking them any moment. They, the Awazim, with their allies and Bin Saud’s regulars (Sarraya) in all about 2,500 strong had formed a camp surrounded by trenches and defen- sife North-East by East of Nta and were to all intents and purposes awaiting the coming attack. . . „ . v , , v^pver was not to attack at all. Having got the (c) Duwish s plan howeve camels and sheep ma Awazim by a ring of camps small area, he was go ng f them either to come distant four to five m il® s or surmider. The large out of their k^elfand sheep with the Awazim was their weak- number of camels an t' decision. These required ness, and wouid help for^ ^ quitt e d ca mp, Faisal’s plan to be grazed an ^ a , attacked and rounded up. he was that they *ould * ^ ^ enable them to superior strength oi rn adopt these tactics.57 (d) A1 Duwish hoped for a complete surrender in a matter of 4 to 5 days by these methods; the only danger being that the Awazim would “tumble” to the plan before the door was closed to them, and would escape south to the Qatif or Ruffuf oasis. (e) There was little chance of the Awazim moving over to the Akhwan side voluntarily as did the Braih, as theirs was a tribe originally subject to the Ajman, whom Bin Saud had freed from bondage and given the status of an independent tribe. Incidentally this was how Bin Saud had won the Awazim over to his side from their former allegiance to Kuwait. The Awazim would lose their freedom once more if they threw in their lot with the rebels now and would again have to pay “ Khawa ” to their old lords the Ajman. (/) Having accomplished his object of either forcing the Awazim to surrender or compelling them to retire south, al Duwish’s next move would be to leave the Ajman masters in Hassa, and move with all his Mutair forces to Artawiyeh. Here he would estab lish his base, and striking South West would seize the Sudair and Washm provinces and cut off Riath from the rich province of Qassim. (g) The operation would not be difficult as Bin Saud definitely had no troops (regular or tribal) in the field except the Awazim and their allies, and the force under Ibn M’saad at Ajibba. There was nothing at all at Hafar al Atz or Awania (South of Nta) as reported in different quarters so persistently. (h) As regards Qassim itself, the rebel leaders al Dahaina was definite ly alive and well, and going from success to success. He had already established relations with the townspeople of Anaiza and was receiving all the supplies he required from that quarter. (i) Recent letters from al Dhaina to al Duwish reported that all was going well with him in Qassim, in spite of a temporary set back caused by the report spread by Bin Saud that Hassa and Kuwait had been taken over by the English, and that the Akwan attacked in rear were in extremis. This report for a short time had created some-thing of consternation in the ranks of the Ataiba insurgents, but the truth was now knowm. (j) It was perfectly true, that Bin Saud had possession of all the towns in Hassa, Nejd and Qassim to-day, but as far as Qassim was concerned this would not help him much as the inhabi tants would be compelled to come to terms with the rebels wdio had it in their power to ruin all agriculture, gardens etc. lying outside the town areas. As everywhere irrigation was by “lift” from wells and as camels were the means used, these only had to be driven off by the Akwan and all irrigation would come to a standstill: Al Duwish was perfectly aware of this fact, and once at Artawalyeh he intended to force Qassim to declare for him by means of this form of pressure. 6. Shaikh Hilal next confided to me the following which he described as “ most secret'’'’ refusing to divulge the source he had got it from. He added that he could not definitely assure me, that what he said would come off or turn out to be true but that he believed that something on the lines of what is described below was being planned and would be attempted. L ° ^ The information he imparted was:— (a) That King Hussain would shortly come to Baghdad from Cyprus for his health. (&amp;) That bnuri al Shaalan and the Rualla, would shortly start hostilities against Bin Saud and attack Jaur.58 '(c) Thckt Shammar Jarba imrlpT* A iii oi v a general mnvp j? i ici a Yarwar were arranging for a vi°w n f^J So uth of all Shammar elements in Iraq with ,, , °, re '-'Over Rail for the ar-Raschi'l family That Sh there^ 61 ^ H ° f tMs family Were state P^oners in whom it If ! J u “°L member of th « &amp;mily at large to 5rir»oHS a ,o ^ ^ (d) That several prominent Shammar Shaikhs were already at Baghdad arranging details of the above plot, and that the recent movements of messengers between Baghdaed and al- Dawisn s headquarters were all to do with this plan. (e) Finally that Duwish had agreed to get into touch with loyal Sham mar elements still in Nejd and try and win them over also. 7, I have given the above in detail, for coming from a man of Hillal al Mutairi’s calibre, it is worth taking note of. As far as the information given in paragraph 5 goes, I personally believe Hillal al Mutairi has given me correct news which he has received direct from al-Duwish and his agents in Qassim. The report. about al Bahama’s successes has been confirmed by the Shaikh of Kuwait also and I think we may assume things are not going too well with Bin Saud in Nejd, though the report that Bin Saud cannot'leave Riath, should be accepted with reserve. As regards the “ very secret” news given in paragraph 6. I prefer to make no comments, though it is not improbable that Shereefian elements wherever found will endeavour to further any plan that will embarass Bin Saud. Enclo. 3 to Serial No. 77.

His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad also reported this morning that a Shaikh Trad ibn Sattam al Shaalan of Anaze (Syria) had arrived in Kuwait yester day and had called on him. He had not d.vulged the reason of h ls visit vet but it was obvious he came with a message for al-Duwish. yet ’o paraeranhs (1) and (2) above read in connection with Hillal al- Mutoi^s statement as reported in paragraph 6 of my letter referred to above are illuminating, I tbl “k- Excellency said he was afraid things 4. During his tal LrL Saud before long, and if the latter did not were going to get worse o , f are(; j „ series of new enemies would arise and make a very big effort soon, he feared a^ene^o ^ ^ ghaikh Ahmad join Duwish ag ains lj him- W Ali l . shuwa i r bat when he passed through a replied that he had had it from All ai&amp;nuw shammar refugee few days ago, that Kmg Faisal had secwtl^sent^ 136 _. including Ltrss s,‘£. s. “*'» “ ,h * 1 dld “/ xm lit- 59 move they deserved to be slaves for all time. That when the Shammar Shaikhs excused themselves pleading their fear of al-Duwish, he the King had said, “ Have no fear, I have arranged things with al-Duwish (‘ lat khafun Du wish andhi They then replied that they would not move till the cold weather set in and that if in the meantime Bin Saud did not brincr about a change in the situation, they the Shammar would act and throw in their lot with the insurgents. 5. His Excellency said he had not paid much attention to the above as he thought rather libellous story, at the time, but that it had now been corroborated by Hillal-al-Mutairi, in rather remarkable fashion. Shaikh Ahmad then proceeded to tell me exactly what Hilla! had reported to me as “ must secret ” information (vide paragraph 6 of my No. 546). 6. From the above there would appear some reason to suppose that al-Duwish is in touch with the Sheerifian party and is making efforts through them to get Shammar and Anaze to come in as allies by offering them Hail and Jauf respectively. 7. His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad is. it would seem, of the above opinion also, but is obviously cautious about stating his views. He made one curious remark to me, which is worth recording. “ Remember al-Duwish is a great politician”, “there is no question of Din behind this rebellion; what Duwish is playing for is the downfall of the house of Saud and the rise or himself al-Duwish in Bin Saud’s place, with success his horizon has become widened and now he hopes to become master of Nejd, and in the process does not care if the Hijaz returns to the Shereefian family or Hail to Bin Raschid 8. It must not of course be forgotten that the Shaikh of Kuwait is among the anti-Bin Saudites. Enclo. 4 to Serial No. 77.

M. ’g SECRETARY OF State tor ForEigh AeeaiRs^ Kfo. 135, Oated the 8th June 1929. I have read with interest the report, No. 5, of the 4th December 1928, made b&gt; the commancuiig officer of H. M. S. “ Dahlia ” to the Commander-in-Chiel of His Majesty s ships and vessels in the Mediterranean, on the subject of slave trade in the Fed Sea, a copy of which was enclosed in your printed despatch No. 43 of the 1st March, and venture to offer the following observations on Com mander Cotton's concluding general remarks :—• 2. It is commonly accepted in Jeddah and Mecca that, within the past two or more years, the import of slaves into this country has diminished consider ably. The slave market has in consequence become almost entirely conlined to persons of long residence in Arabia. Occasionally, children of domiciled slaves are offered for sale, but, as I had recently occasion to verify from a Malay pilgrim who hoped to secure two slaves and return with them to Malaya, only old slaves are for the most part available. The French delegate, who is annually sent to reside at Mecca for the whole pilgrimage season and has an intimate acquaintance with the life of the town and its citizens, recently informed me, as a rare item of interest, of the sale of an Abyssinian girl at the significant figure of £136. 3. I do not share the opinion that the principal factor in the trade is the pilgrimage. Isolated cases have been brought to my notice of pilgrims travelling alone on foot who have been set upon by Bedouins and sold into ^slavery, but incidents of this nature are not of recent occurrence, nor is their repetition] likelv in the absolute security of the pilgrim ways enjoyed under the present regime Bim'ilarlv, it is difficult to continue to accept at its original value the retort of the sale by indigent parents of their offspring Parents will, ot course, o-ivu a rbr’Mder in marriage for a good monetary consideration, but transactions bbhL fabl; doNTfall raider the heading of slave trade. The few casesot the crde of elridren into slavery are of old standing, and refer, rather to the dis- pAiof children entrusted to guardians With thera = g^ntrol L t} ie neighbouring pilgrimage authorities, I see no leas nature should not cwase entirely, if they have not already done so. 4.

Jibuti.-—A\though a telegram bad been sent from Aden tbe previous day giving the time of onr arrival no boat came to meet ns, so I sent an officer to ascertain when it would be convenient for me and for Sir Sidney Barton to pay our respects to tbe Governor of French Somaliland. It then transpired that the telegram had been incorrectly transmitted, and we had not been expected until three hours later. Eventually, we called on M. Cochard, who is but recently arrived from Madagascar, and found him most cordial in his welcome. He came on board in person to return my call, and was accorded a salute of 15 guns on leaving tbe ship. He seemed genuinely sorry that we were not remaining longer, and was most pressing that we should visit Jibuti again in the near future, and stay for two or three days. He placed a motor car at my disposal whilst we remained, and promised that if we returned, he would show us all the country in the vicinity. There is a large and prosperous British community in Jibuti, who are very loyal, and had planned a welcome on the pier for Sir Sidney Barton on. his arrival. Owing to the mistake in the telegram, however, they were only able to see the Governor returning from his call. I met the leading traders in the evening at the Vice-Consulate with Sir Sidney Barton, and if it can be arranged I consider that a visit to Jibuti, later in the year, when the leading members of tbe British community could be invited' to visit the ship, would be desirable. I was given to understand that M. Cochard and. his Chef Badin, have made themselves very popular already in Jibuti, and that grea, attention has been devoted to the improvement of the roads. The Acting Vice-Consul, Mr. Lowe, did all he could to make up for the dis- a ,po[nAtnt occa Joted by the incorrect telegram and sakl how much he hoped a British ship would be able to visit Jibuti again befoie long. * # * * * * 10 UMa T arrived and anchored at about 6-30 am . sending ashore to find oft wteniL'oM be 6 convenient for the Governor to see me.

No further particulars were obtainable. This information was passed by signal to the Senior Officer, Red Sea Sloops, and the Resident at Aden has also been informed. It is questionable whether these acts cannot be looked upon as a form of naval warfare between the Imam and the Idrisi, rather than as lawless acts upon the high seas. When 1 asked why the Yemenese dhows did not defend themselves, Sved Abdil Galil replied that whilst the Imam could arm many more dhows that the Idrisi, he did not care to do so, as he looked upon the sloops as the guardians of the sea, and in fact he had given special orders that his dhows were to proceed unarmed. This may or may not be true, but in actual fact, the Zeranics would always be likely to get the better of a tight at sea, as they are a sea-faring race, whilst their opponents are for the main part Hillmen, with but a small sea-board. 13. Jebel Zh/rwr.—Nothing to report. I consider it very unlikely that any landing grounds for aeroplanes are to be found on the island. ^ * * * * * 14. Hodieda .—The ship anchored at 7 a.m., and a salute was fired by arrangement at 8 a.m. It was returned immediately by the South Fort. The local Consular Agent, Hassan, Konjuni, came on board very soon after anchoring, and informed me that all was quiet on shore, but that heavy fighting was taking place to the Northwards. The Yemenese forces were using an old Turkish camion of about 8 inch bore, for which they had plenty of ammunition, but said that two Italian 6 inch guns and an Italian aeroplane were of no use, and could not be made to work. He then left to arrange for my visit to the Governor, which he thought would have to be deferred till the afternoon, the day being Friday. At about 11 o’clock a dhow came off bearing gifts from the Governor, con sisting of coffee, limes and fresh vegetables, eggs, over 100 head of fowls, and a large crate of pigeons, whilst in another dhow, two calves and four sheep were sent on board. A suitable return in the way of tinned fruits; tea, sugar, etc., was sent on shore, together with a few special articles from my store, and a couple of blocks- of ice. I called on the Governor at 3 o’clock, and was received with great ceremony, a large guard and band being paraded at the base of the pier. His attitude was most friendly, and I gather that he had obtained a special permission from his father, the Imam who is at Sanaa, to come off and return my call. When thanking him for his presents he asked that they might only be forgotten, in comparison with what I had sent to him, and said that when I Visited him again, he would send gifts worthy of the ship. Accompanied by Hassan Konjuni and a number of his staff he returned my call at 4-30, and was shown round the ship. He was particularly interested in the searchlight and appeared to be completely taken aback by the brilliance of the light. The ease of laying the 4 inch guns also surprised him. He had not been on board an limglish ship before, or at least not since 1919, though be had been off to several Italian men-ofwvar. I gathered that he was much im pressed. . V h en hnestioned about the attacks on the Yemen dhow^s, he told me that Jus lather had armed a certain number with small brass cannons, as a guard jor those engaged in trade, but later had given orders for the removal of the guns, as likely to cause offence to us. I had made no preparations to accord a personal salute to Saif-el-Islam, but on the most urgent representations of the Consular Agent, I deemed it ew pedient to fodow the Italian custom and in accordance with Article 78, K. R. and A. 1., 1 saluted him with 15 guns as he left the ship. I I neaid later from Konjuni, that immediately on landing he had made a special report of his visit to the Imam, and that* he had been greatly pleased n&gt; nis reception It is interesting to note that he has always declined to visd ii is snip before, giving as his reason, a fear of being kidnapped.25 v I was unable to gather anv further infnrrw;™ . vities m the Yemen, but Hodeida is visited very fre ( u&lt;' 1K- 1 '!! 1 ”ft ssta i 11 . iVctl F war, and Italian merchant shipping. 7 ±re( l uentl Y by Italian ships of _ p g^ M4st SOn ° f the Imam is now Greeting the operations against the Wrisi The snl,stance of this report dealing mth my visits to Mokha and Hodieda has been forwarded to the Resident, Aden, for information. 15.

There is general dis content at the new and severe measures which are being taken to bleed fled jaz tribes of men and money. 7,§00 Bedouins are estimated to have been enrolled* at Taif and sent to Nejd and Medina. To a large extent the situation is due to natural result of period of suspense through which, in anticipation of definite solution by battle of situation vis a vis the Akhwan, the country is now passing.

(b) Akhwan. (c) Aarab. 2 Taking (a). These, so called “ Regulars ”, are nothing more or less SmJ • CJ \ / ' - • -| ill * 9? J T’/MTCllloT* TY1 n*n T H ITT -rA.inxr « no than his “ Fidawi ” troops. They receive regular monthly pay, but wear special uniform. Most of them are of the “ hathar ’’ (town dweller) class as “ Badia ” opposed to the “ Badia ” (people of the desert). This does not mean to say they are townsmen necessarily, for you will always find men from different tribes employed as Fidawis. A good example of the type recruited, are the Shaikh of Kuwait Fidawi forces stationed at Jahara. Perhaps the best English name that coulct be given them, would be “ Paid Mercenaries They are for the most part chosen for their reliability, and carry out the direct orders of Bin Sand’s Amirs, etc., whereas under category {b), ( c ) the individual fighter carries out his Shaikh’s orders first. The garrisons of the Kuts ” or forts which dominate Hail, Hoffuf, Mubawaz and Qatif for instance consist of these so called “ Regular ” troops. Messages to tribal leaders other towns and the guarding of prisoners and collecting of Zikat (aims), etc., is entrusted to these persons. They go under the name of “ Siriyah ” (singular) and “ Saraya ” (plural). The Akhwan effect to dispise them and call them “ Hadharis 3. The Akhwan (b) on the other hand were brought into being by Bin Sand to fight his battles and win them in the name of Religion. As BadOuins they would never have been reliable, as Akhwan and inflamed by “ the Din” they become well right invincible. Thev.may be linkened to Cromwell’s “ Iron sides ” or the German “ Storm Troops ”, For the rest these fanatics are too well-known to need further description. Suffice to say, when they attack, they have a regular drill which consists of dis mounting from their camels and horses, and advancing shoulder to shoulder infantry fashion, and in several lines. Their boast is that they never run nor are tempted to sheer out of the fight as ordinary Bedouins do when on horseback. If an “ Akhu ” (Comrade-brother) is slain his - place is immediately taken by another. There is no pause in the forward progress, or so their drill has it. Their motto is “ move swiftly and secretly to your objective, when there, attack on foot ”. A regular reserve is always maintained in rear to reinforce where necessary. Such manoeuvres as dawn attacks, night attacks, flank and rear attacks etc etc are regularly understood and practiced. A The Akhwan look upon themselves as the elect of God and the creme de la creme of Bin Sand’s troops. For this reason the rank and file feel confident of ultimate success m their rebellion against Bin Saud. Theirs may be likened to a mutiny of Bin Sand s Pretorian guard rather than a rebellion. The Akhwan despise (a) the Sarraya and (b) the Aarab. 4. Tim Aarab are the ordinary Ba’dia or Bedouin allies of Bin Saud,. and a certain amount, of them usually accompany the Akhwaii on a Ghazzu. For instance when al-Duwish made his recent march across 130 miles of waterless nlimho ail f ? . luc k ^ le an d Sahool at Gaiyeh, he was accompanied by a t i 1 ,, • |r l rUj11 ^ ara | ) ; These were used as scouts patrols, etc., and when • f , a , ac was launched, skirmished ahead’. The Akhwan were the heavy infantry and mam-stay of the attack. They also formed the Reserve. that not ever y Mutairi or Ajmi is an Akhwan : only those of them who feel that way, join the ranks of the elect.

(REPEATED to Cairo, Jerusalem and Bagdad, No. 196.) Lord Lloyd has asked me whether there is any truth in reports in Egyptian press of serious revolt m Hejaz against Ibn Saud. ^ ^ These reports probably arose from Beni Malek incident which is now regarded as closed. In addition there has recently been looting at Tail by Bin Bujad’s Uteibah from Ghut Ghut. Qade is said to have been killed but Amir Feisal went there in person and calm is now restored. I have no further information respecting situation in the interior and must regard reports of u revolt either serious or widespread as unfounded.

Minister for Foreign Affairs states that eauKing Ali has given an offensive interview to correspondent of “ Baghdad Times ” containing false reports of unrest in the Hejaz. Hejaz government realise that they cannot use treaty of Jeddah as a basis of protest to Iraq government they therefore wish to complain to His Majesty’s Government whom they ask to have a stop put to these activities.

Should Mr. Amery agree to the issue of such instructions, Sir Austen Cham berlain proposes to authorise Mr. Jakins to inform the Hejaz Government, in reply to their representations, that His Majesty’s Government regret the fact that the interview was granted, and that they are taking such steps as they can to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents.

The call was followed by various displays by the townspeople during which I had ordered the seaplane to be flown over the town. As mai y ox the townspeople had never seen an aeroplane this created a great sensa tion. After dark searchlights were burnt and the town and surrounding hills illu minated. In the evening a banquet followed by fireworks was given at the Palace m honour of the Resident. In addition to the Residents staff and myself, six officers were invited to attend. The following forenoon I landed with the Resident for a tour of the town and surrounding country. The town is well built and reasonably clean from the Arab standard. Makalla is of interest in being one of the principal ports of the Hadra- maut. The Resident’s visit appeared to arouse much enthusiasm among the people. We came on board again at 10-30 and the ship weighed and proceeded at 11-00. At the request of the Resident I accommodated H. H. The Sultan and a small retinue on board for the passage. H.

I nese considerations are primarily political, but they have direct bear ing upon our military commitments. The Air Council s view is that in general it is desirable to avoid, so far as pos sible, entering into new treaty relationships with these chiefs, and that when sup port or recognition for them is deemed to be advantageous, it is preferable that it should be afforded not by subsidies as such, but by payments for services to be rendered in the way of maintaining emergency landing grounds or keeping roads in repair. The amount of work thereby imposed on the chiefs would be small, and to the chiefs themselves the immediate effect would be much the same as the pay ment of a subsidy based on a specific treaty relationship. From the point of view, however, of His Majesty’s Government, the arrangement would, it is suggested, have the advantage of minimising the obligations of His Majesty’s Government to support a particular chief if, owing to external aggression or other causes, fie became unable to carry out his part of the undertaking, and of avoiding the implication which has sometimes arisen that the honour of His Majesty’s Government is engaged to protect any minor ruler to whom a treaty has been extended at some pastime. The Air Council suggest that the adoption of this policy whenever practicable is in general more consistent with that “ fluidity ”of political groupings in South Western Arabia which the Colonial Office consider to be endemic to conditions in that area (vide paragraph 13 of C. I. D. Memorandum 748-B., October 1926). The Air Council’s suggestion is, in short, that so far as possible any new engagements with chiefs should be on the basis of the third category of those set out in C. P. 231 (27) (Aden Hinterland : Obligations to Tribes) where the stipend is granted in exchange for the protection of trade routes and not on the basis of the first and second cate gories which provided for treaties of peace and friendship.

Between Turkey, N^d, ^^Jgharaf AdnanPaya, We announced yesterday the amva o d the He j az&gt; coming from Counsellor of His Majesty the King of Aej MC4S8FD6 Constantinople and on Ms way to Mecca. One of our reporters met him and asked him as to the reasons for his journey to Turkey and as to the present political condi tions in the Gheziret-el-Arab. He asked also that he should be authorised to pub lish the interview but the Sherif refused, not visiting to see his political comments published in the daily newspapers. Nevertheless, with apologies for disregardin g his wishes, we publish hereunder the interview which is interesting. The reporter gays the following “ The first thing I thought of asking him was the reason for his journey to Turkey, now that the Seoudist policy is beginning to oppose itself to the British policy and that Turkey and Russia are trying to ex change treaties with His Majesty Ibn Seoud and His Majesty the Imam Yehya. So I asked him that question. He replied u l did not go to Constantinople on a political mission but for the sake of the property and business which I have there.” “ His meeting Turkish statesmen .— “ Did you not meet any of the Turkish statesmen ? “ -—Yes, I did, for certain reasons and it was for the same reasons that I had to go to Angora where I met Ismet Pasha, the Prime Minister, gnd Dr. Twefik Rushdy Bey, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Suleiman Shewket Bey, the ex-Turkish representative inHejaz. but as I was not in charge of a political mission, our conversations were not about politics. “ Between Nejd and Turkey. —But the Turkish press said that you talked with the Foreign Minister of Turkey about the negotiations which are taking place between the Turkish Representative in Hejaz and Nejd and the Nejdian government with a view of concluding a treaty ? “ — We had a conversation on this subject but a personal and not an official one and that is a matter on which I can say nothing before I lay it before His Majesty the King. “ — Ho you approve of friendly relations with Turkey ? £&lt; Yes, if such is the wish of His Majesty the King. “ Friendly relations and Great Britain s attitude. W hat will be Great Britain’s attitude towards such relations ? British policy has always been known to be easy and tolerant and not to force things, save in exceptional circumstances. Great Britain has demonstrated her sympathy towards the Arabs and the Arab question during the war and after it and British statesmen never missed an opportunity to declare that the Arabs will obtain their independence anu freedom ; all these declarations were merely political disguise because Great Britain in reality did not keep a single promise of the several ones she gave to the Arabs. We did what we could to sti engthen our friendly relations with Great Britain and now if we sign a treaty either political or economical with Turkey, this would not oe an attack on Great Britain but a matter of doing something which vn imd necessary to us and our government is ready to conclude any xea^y witn any power without having to obtain the assent of Great mam, it our government thinks that that treaty is essential to them.

This attack was made by people very well known to those who tried to attribute it to the Wahabis. ■“ The expulsion of Feisul Danish. ~ What about the concentration of the Wahabis on the Iraq frontier '? — T his is not true and if there are any Wahabis there they must be the men of Feisal Da wish who has been turned out of the country and for whose punishment orders have been issued, ' £ Between the Imam Yelvja mid Ibn Seoud. — What do you think of the relations existing between the Imam Yehya Hamid-Ud-Din and Ibn Seoud ? — They are very good and it is certain that a Yemen delegation will come in the spring to Mecca in order to open official negotiations with a view of concluding a treaty between the two Arab monarchs. I am certain that His Majesty Ibn Seoud’s keenest desire is to maintain friendly relations with His Majesty the Imam and put an end to misunderstandings which could not last except for foreign intrigues. The Imam’s desire cannot be different. ■ t£ .— Put British sources said a month ago that Ibn Seoud had demanded to enforce his sovereignty over the Idriss people and the return to them of their territory now within the Yemen boundaries. Everybody knows that the execution of this would prevent the return of the coastal region as far as Hodeida, to the Idrissi. “ ^0, article 4 of that agreement said that Assir was now territoiy under Ibn Seoud’s influence, but the King never asked for what you say nor wmuld he do so in the future. This Is the conversation we had and we know that despite his denial, the Sherif went to Turkey on a political mission, delegated by Ibn Seoud, to fix up tlie terms sf the treaty to be signed between Turkey and Ibn Seoud.

The usual visits were exchanged with his two principal Ministers and Agents, Sayed Abdel Rahman bin Hamid and Sayed Bu Bekr bin Husain. “ Clematis ” was well received and visit appeared to be popular. Entertainments were exchanged with local officials. 2. Mokalla is a flourishing town of some 15 to 20 thousand inhabitants, carry ing on a considerable trade with the interior. Condition appeared prosperous and latterly road development has been carried out on considerable scale. Mr. Champion and I proceeded on a motor tour accompanied by the Ministers, and at their desire inspected three possible landing grounds for aeroplanes. The Sultan is anxious to open up air communication between Aden and Mokalla, with the idea of even tually establishing an air route via Dafur, Muskat and Karachi to India, extending later perhaps down the East coast of Africa, Mombassa, Zanzibar, etc. 3. Some 30 to 40 dhows, several of large dimensions, present in harbour, Ship building establishments appeared busy. Administration appeared popular. Motor traffic is gradually developing with construction of roads. Tobacco cultivation on the increase. Bir Ali .—In company with Mr. Champion, 2nd Assistant Beslan Prm tectorate Secretary, Aden, paid visit of courtesy to local » of the ^ later the Sultan visited the ship accompanied by a °f “jecte I' § remains of an ancient Himyante aty of almu^ exist here, including some ancient mscrip ion . £ t i, e var ious Arabic ance during this cruise owing to his exceptional knowledge ot the var Aden-Perim.-A short stop was made at ^“g^Xsi^Mtical 0 R^sh collect mails.

He was awaiting passage at Aden on my arrival there. 3. Ship sailed for Asab, p. m. 21st January. Visits were exchanged with Resident Commissioner, Dr. Errico Cibelh. Commanding Officer and one other officer dined with the Commissioner and a party of Italian officers with Commissioner Cibelli and Madame Cibelli lunched on board “ Clematis ” the following day. 2. Asab is a small town of about 3,000 inhabitants. It is r however, a place of possible future importance by virtue of the fact that a motor road is under construc tion from Asab to the interior of Abyssinia. A large warehouse was in process of erection and also harbour works, including cargo-loading appliances. I was inform ed these were in connection with the large Salt Works Co. (Capital 20,000,000 lira) which has recently been established here. This may be so, but it is probable these loading appliances are also in connection with the trade with the interior of Abyssinia, which it is hoped will develop when the road is completed. The bay in which Asab is situated is spacious and although affording good anchorage for a Fleet, is somewhat exposed to the strong Southerly winds which prevail at this season of the year. Massaua .—Junction was made with H.M.S. £1 Endeavour ” on 24th January off Kamaran for the purpose of delivering mails. Sailed for Massaua arriving 25th January, p. m. Usual salutes were exchanged and visits between “ Clematis ” and officials made. A very warm welcome awaited the ship at Massaua, where our arrival appeared to have been heralded from Asab. 2. The Resident Commissioner, Vincenzo Cancilla, informed me that H. E. the Governor of Eritrea hoped that myself and as many officers as I desired to bring would visit him at Asmara. Two motor cars were placed at our disposal and two Italian Naval Officers to accompany us, and party of six officers (i.e. 4 British, 2 Italian) left for Asmara at 14-00, arriving at 18-00. 3. Asmara, situated some 140 kilometres by road from Massaua, at an altitude of 6,000 to 7,000 ft. has a population of 14,000 of whom some 1,500 odd are white. Development has lately been rapid and many public buildings are of considerable size and importance, including the Roman Catholic Cathedral, large Civil and Mili tary Clubs, the Governor’s Palace, Zoo, Military Hospital, Theatre and large hotels, all more or less dating, so I was informed, from the time when Mussolini took charge in Italy. Previous to this, it appears that it was impossible to obtain any assistance from the Italian Colonial Office, but there is no doubt that latterly large sums of money have been spent both at Asmara and Massaua in the endeavour to develop this Italian Colony. On arrival at Asmara, the officers were housed at the principal hotel, attended the Theatre and subsequently a dance at the Civil Club. The following day the Commanding Officer called on Colonel Commandant Cona, commanding Italian Forces in Eritrea, and subsequently H. E. the Governor of Eritrea, Corrado Zoli, entertained the Commanding Officer and officers of Clematis to lunch. During lunch, the Governor in the course of a speech welcoming Clematis made particular reference to the anxiety felt by the Italian nation as to the health of His Majesty Knm Georoe V, adding with what respect and reverence H. M. was held, by all Italians °and praying for his speedy recovery. A suitable reply was made. Later, the Governor enquired as to the health of Sir Stewart Symes, remarking he hoped Resident, Aden, would pay film a visit shortly. It appears from what Resident, Aden, told me before leaving there that botn are anxious to meet to discuss the situation in the Yemen as affecting British and Italian interests, with a view to coming to a &lt;£ modus operand! ” , h ^ °r f i ReS ™ e I lt5 Aden ’ wil1 1 ,rohab] y take place about the end of CW™ 1 SlI /?i ln Mafte y&gt; Governor General of the Soudan, is visiting the have f Lntr ^ a . at Q t q Same c lme - The en( l ui *ies of the Governor of Eritrea have been conveyed to Bir Stewart Symes by separate letter.

Asked why he did not liberate them he explained that if he did so, they would have no means of sup porting themselves; they would immediately foment trouble and compel him to feed them, as he already has to do : since his own position would be the same after as before release, they might as well remain slaves. ***** * **^* Passage Northward through May 9th.

On Clematis last visit to Massawa in January 1929 [“ Clematis ” Report of Pro ceedings No. 114/76 of 17th February 1929, Enclosure to Serial No. (14)] a cordial invitation had been extended by the authorities at Asmara, that on a future visit we should send up a Footoall team to play their best team. It was with this in mind that I had discussed matters with Resident, Aden, and called on Dr. Medici, the Italian Consul, at Aden (reference “ Clematis ” report of Proceedings, No. 114/ 78 of 11th June 1929). In the interval between leaving Aden and arrival at Massa wa, Dr. Medici, had made all necessary arrangements and the Commissioner, Cam- cilia, was so kind as to inform me that a special train was at our disposal whenever required. Further, that H. E. the Governor hoped that we would bring up as many officers and men as we liked and that he would be very pleased to look after them ; I therefcre decided to send one Football team—the ship’s Volunteer band and 2 Chief Petty Officers. More had been suggested by them but on consideration I thought this number sufficient. The party left the next morning by ordinary train, accompanied by myself, three officers and two officers of the Italian Gunboat “ Lepanto ” detailed to act as Liaison Officers. On arrival at Asmara, the officers were received that evening by H. E. the Governor who had previously sent his Staff Officer to greet them at the station. A dance in honour of the British Officers was held at the Military Club, the same evening. The Chief Petty Officers and Petty Officers composing the party were accommodated at an hotel and entertained at the Sergeants’ Mess of the 3rd Battalion, Ascari Regiment, the other ratings being accommodated at another hotel. Friday and Saturday were spent in motor tours of the surrounding country by the officers and ratings, the Football match taking place on Sunday. It was essential to allow an interval’of the two days to elapse after arrival of Football team at Asmara to accustom them to the difference in height of Asmara (8,000 ft.) and sea-level. Sub sequent to this interval, no adverse effects were felt and all ranks and ratings derived much benefit from the spring-like weather experienced at Asmara, me Football match, attended by some 2,500 spectators, including the Governor and principal officers of the Garrison and their families resulted m a wm for Ctema ihr ^ 9 crnals after a very good match.

An official dinner was held on board Clematis on Tuesday, the day prior to departure from Massawa, attended by the Commissioner and Officers of the Port. Several Football matches between ££ Clematis ” 2nd team and local ones vere played at Massawa during absence of 1st team at Asmara. The greatest good feeling prevailed between all ranks throughout the visit and the men helmed exceptionally welh The following signals were exchanged subsequent to departure To H. E. the Governor of Eritrea (repeated to Commissioner, Massawa) “ Will you please accept the grateful thanks of myself, my officers and men on the termination of delightful visit to Asmara and Massawa, All ranks have enjoyed themselves immensely and desire particularly to thank their many friends who have extended to them so much hospitality and &amp;o many kindnesses.” Eeply To Commanding Officer, “ Clematis ”, from Governor, Asmara. “ Thank you for your friendly greetings and I assure you that we will always retain the most charming remembrances of the visit of the officers and men of the H. M. S. ££ Clematis ”. Whilst at Massawa, Baron Franchetti, whom I had made the acquaintance of during my visit to Asab in January 1929, returned from his expedition to the Dankalia country (Abyssinia), in that section bordering Eritrea, behind Asab and Beilul. It appears that the object of the expedition was a mineralogical survey. H. E. the Governor informed me that geologically and hydographically the expedi tion had been quite successful, but he was unable to discover what the results from a mineralogical point of view were, as the expedition was entirely privately financed by Baron Franchetti himself. There seems reason to believe that oil, and possibly gold, are being prospected for. It is to be noted in this connection that the road from Asab now under construction, will when finished traverse this country. Baron Franchetti brought back the remains of the Giulietti Ex pedition, wffiich he discovered by chance during his travels. It appears this ex pedition consisting of a civilian named Giulietti, a sub-Lieutenant and 12 other ratings from the Italian warships “ Fieramosca ”, having started from Beilul in 1881, were massacred by the Abyssinians. The remains are being taken back to Italy, where it is expected they will be given a public funeral, possibly in Rome. Baron Franchetti informed me that he had several times been in action during the expedition and had lost three men. the substance of the information contained in this report of my visit to Massa wa and Asmara has been conveyed to Resident, Aden,, by separate letter, ii accordance with M.

I am directed by His Excellency the High Commissioner to enquire whether you have any information regarding the activities of Emir Shekib Arslan in the Hejaz. o The Emir is a Druze, and started his career by being strongly pro-Turk, pan-Islamic and anti-Arab. After the war he became anti-French and pro- Syrian. He has recently been to Moscow and is almost certainl) working under Soviet direction. 3 He recently passed through here with presents for Ibn Sand, and, in conver sation with various persons, used language showing considerable intimacy with Bolshevik leaders. 4 Various motives for his visit to the Hejaz have been suggested. By some it is said that his object is to persuade Ibn Sand to conclude with the Soviets a Treaty on the lines of the recent Russo-Yemen Treaty. In this connexion he is credited with the intention of organising Bolshevik and anti-British propaganda in Arabia. Brothers it is said that his main purpose is to persuade Ibn Sfeud to appoint him Hejaz Agent in Berlin where already much anti-British propaganda is conducted by Oriental extremists, working in connection with Communist elements and, it is asserted, not discouraged by the Herman authorities. It is also said that he is trying to obtain from Ibn Saud the appointment of one h ouad Selim, an Egyptian, as Hejaz Agent in Paris. 5 . The Syro-Palestinian Committee, which is opposed to Shekib Arslan, is rather apprehensive lest the Emir may succeed in enticing Ibn Saud into some disastrous adventures in Syria. 6 . His Excellency would be glad of any information you can furnish regard ing the purpose and results of the Emir’s visit to the Hejaz. 7 . A copy of this despatch has been forwarded to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary.of State for Foreign Affairs.

Extracts from a letter from the Commander, H. M. S. “ Clematis”, to the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Station, No. 114/78, dated the 11th June 1929. Port Sudan — Jeddah. — Arrived Port Sudan a. m. 16th May ; after provision ing and receiving mails, sailed for Jeddah p. m. 17th May. Acting British Consul at Jeddah in message cabled to S. 0., R. $• Dahlia on 15th May, asked that “ Clematis ” might arrive at Jeddah on 18th May, if possible. I therefore, subject to S. 0. R. S. S.’s approval, deferred my proposed visit to Massawu about this date. The object of arriving on 18th May was on account of this day coinciding with the commencement of “ Courban Bairam or the Haj Pilgrimage, which continued until 22 nd May. The visit wastherefore m the nature of a visit of courtesy and compliment on the occasion of the Pilgrimage and there is no doubt that in these days, although there is no - Mahmal to salute on arrival from Egypt and departure for Mecca (M. S. 0. B., Article 972) as m previous years, owing to present difference of opinion between King Ibn Saud and the Egyptian Authorities (who insists on providing an Egyptian Guard to accompany it), the visit of one of H. M. Sloops at this time is appreciated as a compliment to the Mohammedan Religion. The usual visits of courtesy were exchanged with the Governor of Jeddah, H. E. Abdullah Ali Reza Some 20 Merchant Vessels engaged in the Pilgrim Trade, varying from 500 to 5,000 tons, were in Harbour. 3. During the visit several Sailing Races for Merchant Ship’s Boats were organised by Clematis , culminating in a very successful Jeddah Town Regatta, on 21st May, when the principal European and Arabian residents, together with the Governor of Jeddah, arrived on board to witness the Races. The last occasion on which this Regatta was held was in 1922. The programme included two races on which this Regatta was held was in 1922. The programme included two races for local Arabian boats or “ Sambuks ” and the Governor was kind enough to pro vide me personally with one of his own vessels in which to race. He parti cularly requested that I would fly my ensign together with the Hedjaz flag. We were fortunate enough to win this race after a most exciting tussel, by one length. These “ Sambuks ” are about 55 feet long, very fast and a beautiful shape below water. The crews are very fine sailors, and would make good “ material ' if properly handled and led. Later, the Governor presented the prizes at an At Home held on board 1 Clematis . 4. From information received by me from an un-official source during the visit, it appears that King Ibn Saud is already “ toying ” with the idea of a Navy, or rather “ a preventive service ”, for the protection of the revenue. The first vessel in this service, to be named “ Bakura ” (‘ first fruits ’) is shortly due to arrive at Teddah She is to be some 64 feet long, twin motors, light draught, with 2,400 cubfc feet'of cargo space for any illicit cargoes about to be smuggled winch she may seize on her patrols up and down the coast; approximate cost £3,500 ; stated sneed 10 knots. It is understood if this vessel is successful, further orders are likely’ to be placed. It is gathered that there is no intention of arming these vessels except possibly with rifles and Lewis Guns; nor will the crews wear any recognised uniform. The institution of this “ preventive service will however s* “ %' ir « ar sstia demanding territorial recognition on the coast.

It is my strong opinion, although I am unable to prove my suspicions, that the notorious Mr. B. St. John Philby, sometime Acting British Resident' Trans-Jordan, is responsible for many of the fears and suspicions under which the Hedjaz Government is at present labouring. Mr. Philby left the service of H. M. Government “ under a cloud”, having quarrelled with the authorities it is understood, on the subject of recognition of King Ibn Sand as against King Hussein He bears a poor reputation in Jeddah, both as being British and as regards his commercial dealings generally. There is no doubt, however, that he has the ear of Ibn Saud, whose “ Confidential Adviser ” I have heard him described as, or at least some of his Ministers who use him for their own purposes Nominally his business m Jeddah is as agent for the Ford Motor Co., but he is quite prepared to undertake any work on a commission basis, and it is through Ittbl nAi? 0rder f ° r 1 Ibn Sand’s “ navy ” has been placed.

Letter from His Britannic Majesty’s Ninister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 40, dated the 31st January 1931. With reference to my despatch No. 184 of July 22nd last (Serial No. 1 in File ]No. 285-N./30), I have the honour to report on a matter, which would not be worth recording but for the way in which it illustrates the continued difficulty of doing diplomatic business here in a normal manner. 2. The Emir Faisal became Minister for Foreign Affairs on December It. It was understood that a permanent branch of the Ministry would be estab lished in Jedda under Fuad Bey Hamza who became Under-Sec ret ary in the new organization. This plan has come to nothing so far, owing to Fuad Bey’s serious illness which began on December 21 and culminated in his departure for Egypt on January 30. 3. For three weeks the Emir took no steps to establish personal contact with the foreign representatives. When, however, be came to Jedda on Jan uary 8-9 in connection with the Accession celebrations, Fuad Bey arranged that the Prince should receive independently of the functions a ranged for the Accession. I supposed my visit to be one paid to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. 4. More than three weeks more passed befo r e it was announced that the Prince would arrive in Jedda on January 29 and would receive the foreign representatives. On being informed of this indirectly by Sheikh Yusui Yasin, I replied through the same channels that I should be delighted to wait on the Prince, with whom I had much accumulated business to discuss, but I added a polite hint that I presumed that my visit to the Minister for Foreign Affairs would be returned. I was told m reply that when the Emu- had come here on January 8, he came as Viceroy of the Hejaz and. that fie would be returning the visits of foreign representatives after receiving them on January 29. I accepted this in difference to the Emirs royal standing and for reasons of practical policy and visited him by arrange men ^ morning of the 29th. This visit was formal and m the course of we arranged that I should again see him to talk busims=&gt; 1 s' 30, an hour fixed by the Prince after I had expressed readmess, as it. was Ramadhan, to call on him at any hour oi the day oi mg j 3 . ^ clear hour. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin was present at the formal visit that he was taking on Fuad Bey’s work. ,, 5. When I arrived at the Palace, f, filted 'T made my -ay was no one in attendance and no sign that I t j.cr to the reception to the upper floor and finding the door oi the ante-ehamber to the reueptio room open, I went in there while my interpreter made enquiries. 238 ‘ c ; wi) v::;;- IN20 reported that the Prince was sleeping and that no one knew where Yusuf Yasin was I decided to leave and on my way out found the Prince’s aide- decamp who said that his master had been taken suddenly ill. I expressed, in somewhat lively Turkish, I confess, my sense of injury at the lack of any warning and at the absence of Yusuf Yasin. As I was driving away, I passed the latter approaching the Palace in a car but felt it better to show mv irritatioh by not stopping. On my return to the Legation I sent the Prince a letter, a copy of which I enclose. I sent it without a number, so that I need not treat it as a formal Note later. 6. As my letter was going off, there arrived a junior official of the Ministry and the Aide-do camp, bringing a letter from Yusuf Yasin. They were sent on to my house, I was unable to read the letter at once and said I should have it translated. I added that X had already written to the Emir and that I could not consider a visit by two subordinates as adequate satis faction but would gladly listen to them. We went over the whole ground and 1 took the opportunity of reciting the story of my relations with the Emir. I said that as the Prince was ill, I should accept a visit from Yusuf Yasin, if he came to convey a suitable apology in the couise of the evening. Otherwise I should send the King next day a copy of my letter to the Prince. 7. An hour later Yusuf Yasin announced a visit. He tendered an apology which left nothing to be desired. We had a most friendly conversa tion, in the course of which I said that I was iully satisfied and regarded the incident as closed. It was clear from the various conversations that it was due to an unfortunate combination of circumstances, the Prince and presumably his servants having been overcome by Ramadhan and Yusuf Yasm having been delayed owing to Fuad Bey’s departure. In these cir cumstances I withdrew my request that the matter should be laid before the King. Yusuf Yasin mentioned that the Prince hoped to call upon me and I said I should be honoured. 8. The incident was disposed of in this way within five hours. When I saw Yusuf Yasin, I had fortunately not seen the translation of his letter, which would have added to my irritation. I enclose the translation with a copy of a letter which I addressed to him on January 31, in order to make my position clear without re-opening the incident. 9. I very much regret that such an incident should have occurred at all, but I considered it imperative, to take serious notice of it, lest the Emir who shows little interest in or capacity for his new work should run away with the idea that he can as a Prince go as he pleases with the British representa- tive hm*e and lest Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, who is notoriously most difficult, should imagine that his position dispenses him from the ordinary rules of po te conduct. I make every allowance for the difficulties caused by igno rance, Fuad Bey s illness and the effects of fasting but I could not admit that, on gomg to the Palace to keep an appointment with the Minister for Foreign Affairs I shoffid be left completely in the air. I need hardly add that I manifested all proper concern for the Prince’s health. My impression is. that he succumbs very easily. J r Enclo. 2 to Serial No. (17).

I regret to say that I saw you returning from the Palace before the elapse of some time for your meeting His Highness the Amir and I stopped my car in order ro find out what has happened that caused your return so quickly, but you were so angry that you ordered your driver to go fast and not to stop and continued your driving. When t retu ned to the Palace I hastened to enquire from the A. D. C. of His Royal Highness about the incident and I learnt from him that you returned after waiting five minutes in His Hghness’ private room and told him that to keep you waiting this time without anyone coming to receive you is a degradation directed to you and your Government while this is not the fact meant and is impossible to be or to be meant. This is an mconceiveable thing. The fact is that His Highness the Amir after his return from Friday mid-day prayer became suddenly ill suffering from an attack of fever w r hich he had on the morning of the day he arrived at Jedda. In spite of this when you arrived his A. I). C. informed him of your arrival, so he at once tried to get ready to go out and see you, but a little before he came out you left the Palace so angrily. Your Excellency will see from this explanation that the appointment made by His Highness was in no way neglected. His Highness and myself very much regret that you should come to the Palace and return so quickly with such strong impression and we much more regret the fact that you should think that his action meant to show any degradation. I shall be glad if you will be good enough to consider this letter sent to Your Excellency by the hand of the A. D. G. of His Highness the Amir Faisal and the Assistant Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs to express our regret for the incident and that such matter which appears small if its fact is realized and which happened only owing to overcoming unforeseen necessities should not affect or entangle the progress of the work which we jointly try to accomplish for the mutual interest of both countries. Enclo. 4 to Serial No. (17). Letter from His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Jeddah, to the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Hejazi Government, DATED THE SlST JANUARY 1931. It was only after you left me last evening that I received the translation of the letter you had sent me earlier in the afternoon. As I told you during your visit, I regard the small incident of yesterday afternoon as entirely closed, but I should like to draw your attention to two matters of fact, le^t any feeling should remain that my attitude was unreasonable. 1 When I arrived at the Palace there w^as no one of any kind m attendance not even a servant, and nothing to show that my visit was expected On trying to find out what had happened, my mterpreter was told that the Prince wa/sleeping and that it was not known where you yourself22 Ti- wflq onlv on my way out that Kl-alid Bey told me that His Royal Highness was ill. He did not add that the ^ince was preparing to receive me inspite of his indisposition. I should not have had any complaint, f anyone even a servant, had explained the position and had requested me to wait for a reasonable time in order to be received. 2 I did not enter the Prince’s private appartments. The room which I entered while my interpreter was making enquiries, was the anti-chamber in which I am usually received when I go to see the King or the Prince, before being taken into the reception room. I found the door ol the anti- chamber open. no HI uer ujjfii. Forgive my returning even to this extent to a matter to which I attach nu further importance. I sincerely hope that His Boya! Highness has primnletelv recovered from his indisposition. Enclo. 5 to Serial No. (17). Letter from His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 44, dated the 4th February 1931. With reference to my despatch No. 40 of 31st January relative to an incident connected with my relations with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have the honour to state that the Amir Faisal paid formal return visits to myself and certain other foreign representatives here on the morning of February 1st. He stayed at this Legation half an hour, was very amiable and shewed rather more responsiveness than he usually does, although I had to initiate every subject of conversation. While receiving him as Foreign Minister, I did everything possible to mark respect for his position as a prince. 2. As I reported in my telegram No 19 of 2nd February the Amir has completly broken down and my only business interview with him was that which took nlace on January 31st. He appears to be suffering from malaria. H ; was unable to carry out his intention of returning to Mecca on February 2nd but is only awaiting the permission of his doctors to go there. All foreign affairs business is therefore in the hands of Sheikh Yussuf Yasin. 3. I have had daily conferences with Yussuf Yasin since February 1st. When we hud our first tete-a-tete on that day, he was extremely difficult, as I have reported in my separate despatch on the case of Ibn Mashhur. At the subsequent interviews he has been very correct in discussion and cordial in his general demeanour. 4. In these circumstances I consider that the incident of January 30th, although unfortunate, has had a good effect. 5. I may add that the position of Sheikh Yussuf Yasin which seemed to me obscure when he came here with the Amir Faisal a few days ago is now clear. It appears from an announcement in the “ Umm-al-Qura ” of January 30th that he is to act as Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs during Fuad Bey Hamza s absence, retaining apparently his position as Private Secretary to the King and head of the Political Section of the Royal Divan (Received on 5th April 1931, with Political Secretary's, letter No. 12, dated 19th March 1931.)

As you are aware, some stir was created last year by Mr. H. St. J. Philby’s adoption of the Islamic faith in August. I revert now to this matter, which I did not think it necessary to report officially at the time, because of a long article published in the Mjcca p tper “ Umm-al-Qura ” of January 30th. 2. The writer takes as his text a verse from the Koran which says “ I will not drive away those who have believed ”. His object is to dispose of calumnious gossip regarding the relations between Ibn Sa’ud and Mr. Philby. He refers to the friendly personal relations which grew out of Mr. Philby’s mission to the King during the Great War ; to Mr. Philby’s resignation from the service of His Majesty’s Government as a result of differences when he was employed in Trans-Jordan ; and to the renewal of his friend : y relations with Ibn Sa’ud when Mr. Philby settkd in business in Jedda, He explains how the spectacle of the King’s strong faith led Mr. Philby to look deeply into Islam and how, after frequently expressing to the King his desire to embrace that faith, he finally decided to do so, a decision which increased his consideration in the eyes of the King and all the people, for the friend of yesterday had now become a brother in Islam. The writer scouts the idea that there is any other difference between the Philby of the ptsst and the Abdullah of the present. He repudiates the slanders to which Mr. Philby’s profession of faith and the King’s acceptance have given rise. 3. The writer wishes that the scandal mongers had stopped at general slander but they do not. They suggest that the King, who founded his dominions by the sword and also secured his independence by the grace of God and his own good planning and power, has shewn submission to the British by making Mr. Philby a British adviser, so that he should be under British guidance. “ Oh God Almighty, what a lie ” cries the author. The hero of battles fought for digni y and honour could not sink so low. Mr. Philby, a true friend before and after and now a brother in Islam, is too great to be accused so falsely and the King is a faithful Arab. 4. This article has a certain significance. Mr. Philby has undoubtedly increased his position with the King, if not necessarily in other native circles, by his adoption of Islam. He has much freer access to Ibn fea ud now that he can go to Mecca and other places in the interior, than he had before. The Kina, a talkative man by nature, certainly speaks much to him of his affairs and,°I believe, admits him to the vagueJy constituted councils which he constantly holds. There must be many people who hold by the good old idea that a British official never cnanges his spots and t at Mr. Philby can only be acting as some sort of a British rhe a .^ J of the writer’s refe/enees to Mr. Philby’s past career would appear to intimate that he has himself had a good deal to do with the apologia in the Urn . QuraT. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s High Commis sioners in Iraq and Trans-Jordan. 228(C) F&amp;PDMbmorandtjm from His Britannic Majesty s Minister, Jedda, No. 16^, DATED THE 0TH MARCH 1 31.

Copy to Cairo, Bagdad, and Bushire. Enclo. to Serial No. (20). Better prom His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foriegn Office, No. 80, dated the 6th March 1931. In my despatch No. 13 of January 11, 1931 (Serial No. 12), I mentioned that the festivities at Wadi Fatma on January 9, in honour of Ibn Sa’ud’s accession included a Nejdi war dance. I did not at the time attach any particular importance to this. It now comes into the same setting as certain more recent manifestations which throw a curious sidelight on the internal situation in this country. 2. The King returned to Mecca for Eamedhan and spent the ensuing festival there. Mecca and Jedda were presently all agog on hearing that the King and the Princes of the royal house had danced in public during the feast. Shortly after, as you know, Ibn Sa’ud came to Jedda. He arrived on February 25, the principal object of his visit being to gratify the cherished ambition of Mr. Charles H. Crane, a former Americ:in Minister and sympathiser with Syrian revolutionaries to make his acquaintance. This had been engineered partly by Mr. Antonins and perhaps to some extent by Mr. Philby. It was hoped by some that Mr. Crane might produce a substantial gift or loan. Anyhow, the King was all out to do honour to his guest. 3. Various functions were arranged for the King’s stay in Jedda The diplomatic corps were invited to several as was Mr. Crane. We all dined at the Municipality on the King’s invitation. We all drank tea with Mr. Philby, whose house His Majesty honoured. But the close of the proceedings was a review on February 27 held mainly, it would appear, to provide local colour for Mr. Crane’s edification. There was a small march past of the infantry of the “ regular army ”. It was followed by a much larger parade of men at arms from Nejd who had come back with the King Ihis was carried out with some show of military order, but it was followed by a dance similar to that given at Wadi Fatma though 0.1 wTti.^ y ge ^ scaIe - M '‘y the royal princes took part in it. The leader thr. nnnQii 'l'^ Cf n ’i le hhuir IVsal, so that the diplomatic body enjoyed the unusual spectacle of seeing the Minister for Foreign Aflairs execute aTO TElFi l 12 ) k the 1 Miflpi. tance, Ffe public dance in front of them. He was most graceful and he twirls a sword very prettily. He wore an agreeable smile, though it became a little set as the afternoon wore on—it is said that he collapsed at the end of the similar dance in ilecca. Altogether he showed to infinitely greater advant age than when he is conducting the foreign business of his country. 4. All the participants in th ft dance were N'jdis. The infantrymen of the regular, army, most of whom Cc»me fiom that country intimated a wish to join in alter they had gone through thrir new-fangled European tricks. The King graciously accorded permission. Next day it was announced that the people of Jedda had expressed a desire to show what they could do in the way of a display. The King left Mr. Philby’s party on February 28 somewhat early because be had p omised to return to the Palace for this Jeddavi performance. I understand that it vas on the same lines as the Nejdi display, although less formal. After that the habit of making processions to the Palace with drums, singing and dancing appeared to grow on the people of Jfidda and there were two or three demonstrations of the kind during the remainder of the King’s stay, including one on March 5, when the lead was said to have been taken by the Hadrawis and several gay parties running to many hundred people in all surged past my house on their way back from th^ Palace. 5. On March 2, Mr. Philby gave me his version of the dancing at Mecca. It began more or less by accident, he said. On the first day of the festival a crowd of Meccans made a popular demonstration before the palace there. It was doubtful how the King would take it a question whether he would say ? as it were “ Off with their heads ! ” or “On with the dance ! ” The King was in a good humour and received the demonstration graciously. Then his Nejdis said, “ Let ns have our national dancing too ” and the King assented. When he saw it he was so carried away that he himself joined in. It was a brave sight, said Mr. Philby, to see how the others clustered round until the King was the centre of a thousand men or so, each with his sword in the air. Sword-play, the firing of guns and pistols and the beating of drums are a feature of all these dances. 6. The Mecca “ Umm-al-Qura ” of February 27 records the performance at Mecca in an article headed “ The speech of the Sword . It makes no mention of anything having happened on the first day of the festival but says that on the second the King held a review of his Bedouin troops, in which the Princes joined ; and that the King threw off ins clock, drew his sword and played with it too, “ remembering the old days of his lights . The writer descrih s this swoid play an a voiceless speech, because every g ance and gesture of the King meant many things. 7. The King himself mentioned in my hearing at one of the functions m Jedda that the Nejdi war detnee was a revival, the custom having been m abeyance for over fifteen years. Mr. Philby s version cf ^ ^ . w a{ i; trations ignores the fact that there had been an organised ^ Fatma on January 9, but he too says that these things ar f p t vears old practice and be puts the period of discontinuance at ahou y y * This brings me to my reason for describing an official despatch what so far reads merely like a record of the pi^ q 8. Ibn Sa’ud started the organisation of about 1912. They were clearly designed Tho rebels fighting forces fanned to zeal by the present Wa js difficult of 1929 turned a portion of this instrument again j ue ®' { t i ie Akhwan to judge how far the revolt permanently impair rebels was that the as J a military machine b '^ ^^ue to the latent that, as King had ceased to be a good \\ ahabi. r - eg w ith modern progress he has risen, he has had to make many co geeg in pig toleration and and some with less rigid forms of I indication of his desire to encouragement of the repent manifestations t g ^ ^ ,. hinga re pugnent to ride on a lesser ram a section °£ ms s d 1 { th drum for instence. the true Wahhabi of the old school, the music ot me ui mi r,iAlthough this new liberty has been allowed to both Nejdis and Hejazxs, it is significant that the easing of the safety valve has taken place in Mecca and Jedda, places with no real appetite for Wahabism in a ,y form. The King would appear to be reinsuring with the less puritanical elements. His personal participation and that of the princes in the dancing have enabled him to appear as a monarch who has not only liked to see his people have a bit of fun but is democratic enough to join in it. 9. Townsmen count for little in this country and it would be a mistake to attach a greater political significance to the matter than I have done i n the preceding paragraph. The spectacle of the dancing crowd outside my house on March 3, injured up the atmosphere of expensiveness char acteristic of the cheer fuller phases of European revolutions which have ended in the downfall of Kings ; but I should be slow to suggest that Ibn kSa’ud’s complaisance denotes, in an Arabian setting, any consciousness of a serious weakening in his position. 10 . 1 am sending copies of this despatch to the High Commissioner at Baghdad, Cairo, The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and to the Secretary to Government of Ind a in the Foreign and Political Department. {Received on 19th April 1931, with Political Secretary's letter No. {the 2nd April 1931.) 14, dated Enclosure in Colonial Office covering letter dated 27tli March 1931.

I said that there was no neneral change in His Majesty’s Go vrernment towards Ibn Sa ud Nevep- theless particular questions might affect the relations of states, if they were of sufficient importance. The Eastern Telegraph Company question was not of that importance. The Trans-Jordan question might be. Eeen so it was the practice of His Majesty’s Government to deal as far as possible with all questions, even the most important, on their individual merits. They had not for instance allowed the Trans-Jordan question to stand in the way of Nuri Pasha’s visit, as they might have done even though they were no longer directly concerned in the negotiations for which he was comine They had, like the Hejazi Government, given no publicity to the existence of an acute cont-oversy. Had they let it be known, Ibn Saud mi^ht have sustained damage, e.g., it would have anected the Indian pilgrimage, the only element in the whole of this year s pilgrimage which seemed likely to be np to last year’s strength. 10. As for myself, I said, I had continued to discuss other questions which were already in hand. The only change I had made was that I had delayed certain communications pending a settlement of the one capital question. I had been at pains to avoid any fresh cau e of quarrel, e.g., I had in one case acted with great restraint over a new non-political question, that of the Government chauffeurs. We then had some conversation on that subject, on which I have reported separately. 11. My main object throughout this conversation was to impress Sheikh Yussuf with the extreme importance of the Trans-Jordan frontier question, without involving myself in any discussion of its recent phases. Though perturbed over it, he gave me the impression of thinking that it had ceased to be acute, as for i istanee when he said that he had waited until things were easier to make his general communication. When he was leaving I asked him to convey my respects to the King and to assure His Majesty that I was always striving for a good understanding ; but I added that there was one cloud and that that cloud had nob been dispersed. 12. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s High Com missioners at Jerusalem and Baghdad and to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department.

My immediately preceding telegram (Serial No. 16 in File No. 1-N./31). Reports have been floating about recently to the effect that Ibn Saud has been strengthening forces in North. I hear also of Camel Corps being organised at Medina and the Government workshops at Mecca being engaged in conversion of ordinary motor cars into extemporised armoured cars. r I cannot Youch for the last two items and the report of unusual move ments of troops are (? too, omitted) common in this country to deserve much attention. Language of last notes read in conjunction with other recent communications suggests however the bare possibility that the King may e trying to work up justification for some kind of forward action. I think such action unlikely but possibility should be borne in mind as he may ee r^er a er t e conclusion of Iraq negotiations and recent indications point to easier situation between him and Imam Yahya.

With reference to my telegram No. 19 of February 2, I have the honour to state that Fuad Bey Hamza returned to Jedda, on April 13, and informed me by a personal letter of April 15 that he had resumed his duties, i.e., those of Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs. 2. Although Fuad Bey’s illness in December and January was undoubtedly genuine, many people thought him unlikely to return to the Hejaz. Now that he has come back, it remains to be seen what balance will be established between him and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, whose P^ition with the King is strong and who has since the beginning of February ^J^r'ist “ito close contact with the foreign representatives. It will also be mtere g see how much of his time Fuad Bey will spend in Jedda, either as a g representative of the Minister lor Foreign Affairs or as head of a properly organized local branch of the Ministry. 3.

( 26 ) {Received on 10th May 1931, with Political Secretary s letter No. 17, dated the 23rd April 1931.) No. 1. Despatch from His Majesty's Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 81, DATED THE OtH MaRCH 1931. In my despatch No. 80 of to-day’s date I have had occasion to mention the visit of Mr. Charles R. Crane to Jedda. As this event has attracted a good deal of attention, it may be worth while to make it the subject of a report. 2. It will be remembered that Mr. Crane visited Jedda at the end of 1926, as recorded in the Jedda report for December of that year. He did not then meet Ibn Sand, but they exchanged presents. His recent visit would appear to have been arranged by Mr. Antonins, who was formerly employed in the Palestine Administration, and who assisted Sir G. Clayton here at various times from 1925 to 1928. I first heard of it from Mr. Philby, shortly before I received a telegram from Sir John Chancellor on the subject. 3. Mr. Crane appears to have come specially from America to accomplish, his personal visit to Ibn Sand. He arrived here on the 25th February and left on the 3rd March. He was accompanied by Mr. Antonias. He stayed, by his own request, at the house of a local notable who had entertained him in 1926. He saw a great deal of the King in one way or another, both by special arrangement and at functions. 4. In 1926-27 Mr. Crane was mal vu in French and British official circles because of his association with Syiian revolutionaries. I have no lull information on the subject, but my French colleague here tells me that, in his opinion, the French authorities took a rather exaggerated view. He seems to regard Mr. Crane as an amiable busybody, who makes oriental peoples his hobby and who has money to burn, although he does not burn it as fieely as he is sometimes expected to do. My own observation tends to connim this. Mr. Crane called on me, and I entertained him a little during his stay without going beyond the courtesy which it is natural to show in this place to any distinguished visitor. He rode his hobby all the time, caracoiing from Turkey to the Far East, and he seemed to be merely an interested, though sympathetic, observer of experiments in uplift in the df S ap;hr°~histoS” dWelt ° n th6 ma ' y tHn S S he had ^ ^„H 5 a Mr ' f Crail t iSint f eStedintheYemen &gt; an&lt;1 said to be building a • en \ m0tiTeS - His Yisit t0 Jedda heralded by ZZ i f ^ W f 8 ?? g t0 , gl T e ° r lend Ibn Sal «i a handsome sum of the Kinff flr.rh P assed between them, except that, when turnS o g n d hw a ,, Mr - P j 1 i by ?, 0n the 28th February, the conversation the Yemen tn r' n ^ ^ r ' !; rane r, ® ere 'i to arrange for his engineer in . -men to call m at Jedda on his next voyage up the Red Sea to size uptlie possibilities^ of boring hereabouts. The King, who toys a good deal with the idea of finding new water in his Dominion, accepted the offer. The conversation, in which it was made and accepted and at which I was present, appeared to be quiet accidental.

All these causes doubtless contributed to the slump in rivals although I have not sufficient expert knowledge to iudee of the effect of particular factors nor do I know what quantity of riyats is required for the normal business of the country. The Government were forced to take the situation in hand, and an attempt was made to restore the riyal by a pro- clamation, which in Jedda w&lt;;S disseminated late one evening by that pictu resque survival, the town crier. The Government action produced its effect' but it was said that the riyal still passed surreptitiously at a depreciated price. When the King came to Jedda on the 25th February, conferences were held between the authorities, bankers and merchan s. It was decided to enforce the law stringently and to bolster vp the riyal by prohibiting the exportation of gold. The Government expressed readiness themselves to accept riyals for all purposes at 10 to the £ sterling, and enjoined this on everyone else. They secured the support of the Nederlarniische Handel Maatschappij (Netherlands Trading Society), which undertook to take riyals at the official rate, plus a small supplement in payment for drafts. The only other banking firm in Jedda, Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited), took up a more conservative attitude and declined to commit themselves, although they are in fact dealing at the official rate up to a limit. 5. I enclose a translation of a communique issued in the “ Umm-al- Qura ” of the 6th March ( 1 ). The same number of the paper had a leading article attributing the crisis to the fraudulent manoeuvres of speculators, denying that there has been any real crisis at all and describing the action of the Government. 6. The measures taken have produced stability for the time being, the riyal being pegged at 10 to export-prohibited gold. The effect has been not to rehabilitate the riyal so much as to bring gold down to its level. In view of the poor pilgrimage prospects, it is difficult to see what the outcome will be in a country with no export trade and little capacity in the highest places for any form of earning other than that of postponing, where possible, the payment o* debts. It is to be supposed that the level of prices will rise. The action of the Dutch Bank has been of material assistance to the Govern ment, but it is not clear on what basis that action rests. When he embarked on it, the manager, Mr. Jacobs, appeared to be confident and to think that the Hejaz was good for any amount up to the total value of riyals in circu lation. He professed to rely o.i the honour of the Government and thus found common ground with Mr. Philby, who in ' ne conversation suggested that anyone who did not share this simple faith might as well give up trying to do business here. 7. Mr. Jacobs seems to be a pretty astute financier and had no doubt some more solid basis to work on. On the face of it hr, bank make six balalas per £ or about par on every draft they sell, and they a so charge a commission of 1 per cent. As they are in effec en pig go equivalent abroad on the security of riyals, the value to them of the w profits would appear to depend not only o n the eventual solvency of the ( 1 ) Notpiinted.38 4 . +T.P Ipnath of time for which they have to carry any Government, bnt on Lqmess. r Ihey doubtless have some redemp- riyals not required for c.ri to ascertain its exact nature, It is tion arrangement, hut I - ^ March the Minister of Finance pro- within my knowledge that ^ pose _ My i a test information at duced a certain quantity g ' bg ig as w9 ll satisfied as he was three the time of writing is that i • g tb 22nd March that he would weeks ago.

Enclosure in the Department of Overseas Trade, covering letter No. 26350/31, dated the 20th Miy 1931. He tee from H. M.’s Misistee, Jeddi, to the Comptroller General Department of Overseas Trade, No. 23350/31, dated the 18th Apkil 1931. Up to December 31st last Messrs. Gallatly, Hankey and Company (Sudan) Lid., held, as agents for Shell, the contract for the supply of benzine to the Hejazi Government when the last contract was nearing its expiration Messrs. Gailatly, Hai key Ltd. tendered for a new one but they were only prep tred to take it up on more stringent terms as regards payment. They had had great difficulty in obtaining regu'ar settlements under the previous contract which provided for payment at thur option in gold, local silver or drafts on the Customs. For some time previous to last December they had accepted drafts on Customs but they were only marketable at a heavy discount and could only be realised without loss by rendering them in payment of customs duty. At one moment early this year it was rumoured that the Customs might no longer accept them for this purpose. The rumour was nou confirmed but caution was necessiry and Messrs. Gallatly, Hankey and Company declined to accept drafts for the purpo e of the December settle ment. The whole position was so unsatisfactory and the financial outlook is so bad that they professed indifference as to whether they got the contract for Shell or not unless they could be assured of payment in gold. 2. It was reported a short time ago that the contract had gone to Messrs. H. de Haas, a German, who has been in business here for some months past and was recently appointed German Consul. This gentleman works in partnership with a Tripodtan named Khalid Ley, who also came here last year and entered the service of the Government but afterwards left it. It was understood that Monsieur de Haas had secured the contract in competition not only with Messrs. Gallatly, Hankey &amp; Co. but also with Sharqieh Ltd., Mr. Philby’s firm, who represent Standard Oil. Monsieur de Hass was said to have m view supplies of Roumanian or Galician oil. Prince would appear to have been the determining factor in a choice among the competitors. Messrs. GaTatly Hankey &amp; Co. are at present in bad odour with the Government owing to their attitude towards the exchange question (See the copy of my despatch No. 108 of 23rd March 1931 to the F. O., forwarded in my despatch No. O. T. 11 of the same date) but Sharqieh Ltd. are under no similar disability. 3. The Government seem, however, to have difficulty in making the necessary financial arrangements in oroer to place the contract with any one, Monsieur de Hass himself told me on March 30th that he had in fact been supposed to be first favourite and thought a couple of weeks ago that all was settled. The Minister of Finance had then delayed signing the contract from day to day and the latest indications were that it would not be sigried for some time. Messrs. GaDaily, Hankey s manager e s me a when the business seemed ripe for settlement the Government ^ked his Arm for a loan of ten thousand pounds, which was refused. He suspected that his money was needed to finance the benzine contrac w. i rival.40 4 I learnt very confidentially some weeks ago from the manager of Messrs. Galletly, Hankey &amp; Co. that the Government were considering a scheme to monopolise the importation and distribution of benzine and other articles. He considered that they would have little difficulty in arranging for the storage and local distribution of benzine, but might find it harder to make buying arrangements abroad. X have heard no more of this project. It may have something to do with the delay over the benzine contract but it seems more probable that it is the financial difficulty that blocks the way. Meanwhile the Government appear to be buying supplies off the market. (37) {Received on 14th June 1931, with Political Secretary's letter A 7 o. 22, dated the 28th May 1931.

I have not long returned from a lengthy journey round Africa. Most of this was done on a Boat belonging to an Italian line which left Venice on the 2nd December last. We called at Fium&lt;‘, and load'd up 10,000 large cases, eash containing two tins holding several gallons of what was alleged to be Paraffin, but was in fact Petrol. There was some doubt as to the destination of this cargo until we reached the Bed Sea, and then it appeared that we were to discharge it at Mocha. We reached that place on the 26th December and were unloading u. der difficulties until the 28th December, The cargo was consigned to the Emir of that District who is understood to be the Viceroy of the King of Arabia and claims to be his cousin. Considerable importance sterns to have been attached to the Cargo, as the Emir came on board in person with a numerous suite. There came on hoard with him two Italians wbo were in the district to further Italian interests. One is a Doctor. He told me he had previously been in Abyssinia.

I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to trans mit herewith, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs extracts from a report of proceedings for the period 1st to 31st October 1930’ which has been received from the Commanding Officer of H.M.S. “ DAHLIA The information in section 12 regarding the slave trade is interesting and important. It confirms opinions previously expressed that such traffic as°there is goes mainly through French territory and tends to confirm previous impres sions that the French local authorities make no serious attempts to stop it, partly through indifference (or possibly connivance) and partly through in ability. It also confirms the view that the organisation of intelligence on shore is the first necessity. It is again stated that the slaves are transported across to Arabia 2 or 3 at a time. This will always be difficult, if not impossible, to stop by action at sea. In this connection I am to request that My Lords may be favoured at an early date witli the views of the Secretary of State on the proposal that an interpreter 'to be engaged through the Legation at Addis Ababa should be em barked in the sloops cruising in Southern Red Sea Waters capable of questioning children found in dhows (vide Admiralty letter of the 16th October, No. M. 03099|30).

This island is said to be very rich in minerals of various kinds, together with semi-precious stones, and some gold, but no water is available, aiid there is no anchorage. Many attempts have been made from time to time to develop the workings, but these natural difficulties have always proved too much for the concessionaires, 3. Port Sudan .—The Senior Officer, Red Sea Sloops, was in harbour in “ Clematis ” on arrival, together with the French Sloop “ Vitry le Francois ” and two submarines, returning from Madagascar, which had been met with at Port Said in April, outward bound, # * * ? * * * * {iv) The tents belonging to the Governor General arrived on the and were embarked together with nine native servants, and Major Cheesman the British Consul at Shangila in Abyssinia, for whom a passage had been granted. The ship sailed for Djibouti next day. (v) The fact that Major Cheesman found it necessary to come to Port Sudan is interesting, as illustrating the difficulties of travel in Abyssinia. His post is to the S.-W. of Lake Tsana, about 150—200 miles N.-W. of Addis Ababa, hut owing to the flooding of the Bine Nile it was necessary for him to trek for twelve days to the Soudan frontier at Gallabat, expend another week in reach ing Khartoum, spend two days in the train to reach Port Sudan, four days bv sea to reach Djibouti, and tljeii travel another 500 miles on the Ethiopan Rail way to reach Addis Ababa. His post is a most lonely one, with no white men within reach. He receives a mail about once in six months, and may go as long as eighteen months with, out seeing another white man. Being stationed in the Northern pa rt of the country, he is somewhat beyond the usual route of slave caravans making for the coast, but he has seen slaves m small numbers being taken to the,North, as if making for the Eritrean frontier but these might well he for sale within Abyssinia itself, and not for export. ’ • m ]le in ^ ed t 7 ° ^f a , r d the export traffic as likely to be of small dimen, sions aithough he admitted it was largely outside his sphere.

Lowe the British Vice Consul, Who has teen deluged With work in connection with the arrival of tte British delegations, and other work m connection with the Coronation. On previous visits Mr Lowe has not had much intelligence for me coneern- mg the slave trade, and indeed as an unpaid consul, with a large business he has little time to devote to outside work. ’ _ During the past summer, trade has been slack, however, and he has ob tained a considerable amount of intelligence, which is included later in this report. ^ confessed to me that Ms discoveries have come as the greatest surprise The ship sailed for Rerkera, by way of Aden, on the afternoon of the 18th. 6 . Ate.—Two French tugs, under the command of a naval lieutenant, route for Saigon were in harbour, and due to sail shortly. Friendly greetings, and good wishes for their long vovage were sent over, which seemed much appreciated. The Political Resident embayked after sunset, and the ship sailed for ‘Berbera Immediately. Sir Stewart Symes expressed his great gratitude for the passage accorded him, as without it, he could not have reached Addis Ababa in time for the Coronation. 4 T. Berber a .—-The usual call was paid on the Governor on arrival, after which Sir Harold Kittermaster ashed me to come ashore as soon as possible with Sir Stewart Symes to have a look round the town, etc., and stay for lunch. The Governor embarked, under a salute of 17 guns, about 5 o’clock, and the ship sailed for Djibouti almost immediately, Hying his flag. Berbera harbour is easy of access, but is so narrow that it is wiser to sail before dark, as there is little room for turning the ship, and it is impossible to see the shoals at night. Speed was adjusted to allow of reacMng Djibouti jabout 3 p.m., when the heat of the day is -oyer. (n) On arrival representatives of the Governor of French Somaliland and of the railway compan 3 r came on board, the latter being much concerned about the arrangements for the special train for II. It. H. The Duke of Gloucester. The original time table allowed of its departure on the afternoon of the 17th, but at the last moment the -Coronation festivities were advanced twenty- four hours, and in order that the Royal train should be able to return to Djibouti in time to fetch the Italian Prince, it was necessary that the train for His Royal Highness should leave Djibouti not later than the evening of the 26th, although the “ Ranpura ”, carrying the Royal Mission was not due at Aden until the morning of that day. (Hi) His Excellency the Governor of British Somaliland, and the Political Resident, Aden, accompanied by the Commanding Officer disembarked at 5 p.m., •and called upon the French Governor M. Chappon-Baissac, and after a vist to the station returned to the French Residency for an early dinner, before the .departure of the train at 7-30 p.m. His Excellency very kindly airanged tha. the train should not leave until dinner was over, and accompanied the P ai y To the Station, which was gaily decorated. (iv) I had a further conversation With the Vice-Consul next day, on the subject of the slave trade, and sailed for Aden in the afternoon. Calls were also exchanged with the Commanding Officer of the ‘‘ Diana ”, and arrangements made concern! mr the salutes that would he fired on the a tv- m Effi* ”;fiyi^ the flag of His Royal Highness, the Duke of Glpucester. U * H 1 f ■ 'V: 1 j!P ijv 'r \Thp Oat)tam of the “ Diana ' was rather worried, and wished to get the posi tion mite clear, as he is not a saluting ship, since he carries hut two guns, hut he has received orders for this occasion to fire personal salutes, hut not to return salutes for those fired to the Country. I made the necessary arrange ments with “ Effingham ” on arrival at Aden. 8. Aden. H. M. S. “ Effingham ”, flying the flag of Bear Admiral E. J. A. Fullerton C.B., D.S.O., Commander-In-Chief, East Indies Station, was in har bour, and was saluted with 15 guns on arrival, a return salute of 7 guns being fired by “ Effingham ” (ii) The Commander-in-Chief sent a message that lie did not wish me to make an official call upon him, and invited me to lunch instead, after which he asked me for as much information as I possessed about the forthcoming Corona tion. ******** (iv) H. R. H. The Duke of Gloucester arrived in the P. and 0. S.S. “ Ranpura at 8 a.m. on the 26th, and anchored in the outer harbour, in order to expedite the departure of “ Effingham ”, which had to reach Djibouti before dark. Salutes of 31 guns were fired on the arrival of “ Ranpura ”, and when His Royal Highness embarked in “ Effingham ”. A further salute was not fired by “ Dahlia ” when “ Effingham ” sailed in accordance with the orders of the Commander-in-Chief. (vi) I discussed my visit to Mokalla and the adjacent coast with both Sir Stewart Symes and the Acting Resident, who regretted that at the present time it was not possible to take advantage of the opportunity to embark a Political Officer for the visit. By arrangement with the Air Officer Commanding. Flight Lieutenant Rickard, the Intelligence Officer, and another R. A. F. Officer were given a passage. The R. A. F. are displaying great activity in perfecting their series of landing grounds along this coast. 9. Aden to Mokalla .—The passage was uneventful, and very little dhow traffic was encountered. One dhow from Socotra belonging to the Sultan of Kishin and Socotra was stopped and boarded. The crew were short of water, and were given a supplv sufficient to enable them to reach Aden. 10 MokaUa.—On arrival I was informed that H. H. The Sultan of Sheher and Mokalla had sailed for India the previous day, so official calls were ex- c ange vi i k eyd Abdul Rehman bin Hamid bin Mehdar representing the the^interfor^ ^ ^ aZir ’ ^nbaker bin Hussein Mehdar being absent in it o-uve' toTho rec O ve( h and emphasis was laid on the pleasure „a e to the inhabitants to receive an occasional visit from a British ship. even^mm’e^osfprp^ 0 ^^ J- S P^ nrc&gt; 3que from seaward, hut seems to be n moie pestered with flies than other Arab town« There is a verv °-ood rhtHe 1 in P tt town iSelM' bn f in ^e&gt; be seen, but on the whole there is nme m tne town itself to make a visit interesting. +i y* 1 ra ffic Operations. —Owing to the snecial nmoramm^ rm whiHt the ship has been emploved. therp has hepn Phi,, P a !

The information states that the Slaves, all boys and girls, are kept more or less openly outside Tad jura, and employed as goat-herds until their sale has been negotiated. There are two routes for shipment, one at Ambaba near Tadjura, and the other in the neighbourhood of lias Dumeira, inside the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb. Mr. Lowe, at my request, is trying to ascertain the exact whereabouts of this last position, which is of considerable interest to the sloops. He had recently made an excursion to Tadjura in a motor boat, in company with a member of the Legation staff from Addis Ababa, and came hack with the impression that the existence of the traffic in slaves was well known to the French authorities. (in) A good deal of interesting information had reached Mr. Lowe from one of the French District Officers on the Abyssinian frontier. This officer realises how little authority his Government have in the interior, and is very anxious to import some Senegalese troops, and then by means of bribery to set the Dankali chiefs quarrelling amongst themselves. Once this was done, fbe troops could quickly subjugate the tribes one by one. At present, however, they are all in league with one another, content to share the profits of the slave and arms traffic, and remain united in the face of the indifferent opposition of the French native troops at present in the Colony. M. Chappon-Baissac is reported to have refused to listen to any such sug gestion. (iv) From the same source Mr. Lowe leareed that a large trade is now going on in women from the interior, who are brought down to Djibouti by train, one at a time, as the wives ” of their companions. The District Officer has come to know of this, and proposed to institute a train inspection on the frontier, with verification of papers, which would have put a stop to the traffic. This proposal, also, is said to have been rejected by the Governor, and, further, on one occasion, when the District Officer was about to search a parti cular train, urgent orders were received that the search was not to take place. (v) As an illustration of the small control exercised by the French,, it appears that quite recently the Commissioner at Tadjura obtained permission •to build himself a house on a plateau in the mountains, where there is a water fall, and a reasonably pleasant climate. Accordingly he selected a spot for the Residency, marked it off, and was commencing to have it cleared. Immediately the work was* commenced, he was approached by two of the Danakil Chiefs, who explained that they had raised no objection to his looking at the place, but they could not dream of allowing him to live there. In consequence the residence in the hills has had to be given up. (vi) The native informer reports that the notorious Sheik Issa, who is so often at Perim, is now employed as an intelligence agert only, and lets the slavers know when the coast Is clear for them. He is said to do this by means of fires on the shore. The last report from Aden about this man is that he is now hut a peaceful trader in camels. As he is known to he wanted by the Italians foi muider, i seems a pity he cannot be arrested, and handed over to them. (vii) Major Cheesman was with me, during most of my conversations with Mr. Lowe, aud was ohviouslv verv surprised to hear of the ramifica 1011 s of the trade. There is no doubt that Mr. Lowe himself was very astonished at the information that reached him, and it was this fact that imp]esse ine moie . :ian anything, as in previous conversations he had been somewia • sctp ica extent of the traffic. Pin) One other point is worthy of remark, ^ 'ative agent went so far as to offer to negotiate the saie of two or three o i^se ' ' , . himself, if he could arrange a boat to fetch them away, and went on t P sa) that Lc70ED6 if an armed partv were to be sent in the boat, the dealers themselves might he eaught and punished. Now the idea that the Consul might like to buy slaves is not one that is likely to occur to a native, but this very proposal was included in a recent despatch to the Foreign Office from the British Minister at Addis Ababa. In the circumstances it seems likely that there is a leakage of information somewhere, and it is a disturbing conclusion at which to arrive. I do not think there can have been any leakage onboard this ship. Copies to :— The Senior Officer, Bed Sea Sloops, H.M.S. The Secretary to the Admiralty.

An account of a conversation which I had with King Faisal when he called upon me in my house in the afternoon of the 30th November may be of interest. The Kin^ enquired as to the Customs arrangement between Trans-Jordan and Syria saying that he was interested since the French in Syria were nego tiating for an agreement with Iraq. He said he did not intend to grant any facilities to the French which would help to improve the economic situation in Syria since that would delay their departure from that country. He) said he was most anxious that the pipe-line should not pass through Syria because if it did the French would never leave since they vvould maintain that the protection of the pipe-line w T as an international obligation and neces sitated their permanent presence in the country. I asked him if the same remark did not apply to the English if the pipe line came to Haifa. ,/ He replied that with the English the position was different. The Arabs feel that their future is bound up with that Nation and that it is to their interests to remain on good terms with them. lie thought England’s Jewish policy was a very great mistake but that Palestine should remain permanently under the English for it might prove a white elephant to the Arabs with its Holy places.* If the Arabs were in charge, the Western Powers would always have an excuse for poking their noses into Arab affairs on the plea that the Holy places and the rights appertaining thereto were not being adequately looked after and safeguarded. If, on the other hand, England were in charge she could bear the brunt of this. I asked him what his ideas were in regard to the future of the Arab Nation. He said he hoped in the future to see a Federation of Arab States, namely, Iraq, Syria, Trans-Jordan (with a shrug), Nejd, and the Hejaz and the Yemen. As regards the kingdom of Ibn Sand he felt sure that it would go to pieces on the death of the present Monarch but that in the meantime he would like to see close and friendly arrangements established between these States and between them and England. He realised that the French stood in the way of this as regards Syria hut hoped that Syria might eventually get rid of the French and follow the example of the other Arab States. He expressed regret that the treaty between England and the Yemen had not been concluded and was apprehensive of the activities of the Italians in that country.

(S) (Received on Uth February 1931, with Political Secretary’s letter No. 5, dated the 29th December 1930.) Enclosure in Foreign Office Covering letter, dated 23rd January 1931. Letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 7 , DATED THE 23rD DECEMBER 1930. In my telegram No. 240 of 19th December [Serial No (14) in File No. 138-N.i30], 1 had the honour to report that I had arrived at dedda^ on that aa&gt; on my return from leave. It may he worth while to record the additional fact that Fuad Bey Hamza, now Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, came down from Mecca specially to receive me on behalf of the King and ,o present Ins personal greetings. 'He met me at the Customs House and delivered cordial messages from Ibn Sa’ud, accompanied by an expression of regret that lie naa been compelled to time his departure for Riadh so that it coincided with m) arrival. Fuad Bev, who will certainly continue to play the leading role m foreign affairs, especially as regards the maintenance of relations with foreign representatives, was most effusive in his personal welcome to my wile myself. 2 Fuad Bev had to return to Mecca the same afternoon as the King was due to leave for Nejd that evening and actually started on the morning ot the 20th. I have consequently had no opportunity of discussing any business with the Under-Secretary and am unlikely to see the King himself tor at leas two months, possibly a good deal longer. 3. The cordiality of my reception shows that Ibn Sa’ud desires to stain well with His Majesty’s Government. Any optimism that I might be temntea to feel is discounted by the nrospect of having to deal with various con ten ions questions and more especially by the blackness of the financial outlook, wine is worse/ than when I left in August. It is now such that I shall inevi ary have to bring strong pressure to hear to procure the settlement of outstanciUo deb f s, ■ like that due to the Government of India for arms and ammuni ion supplied last year, arrears due to the Eastern Telegraph Company in respec. of telegrams despatched bv the Port Sudan cable and the considerable amouii - due to Messrs.

During the last few days of the month, the wind has been too strong to allow of any traffic being under sail. 11 Slave Trade Intelligence, —No intelligence fiom British sources, has been received during the month. When at Djibouti, I was telling the First Lieutenant of Lepanto about the supposed drug traffickers, and then passed naturally to a discussion of the Slave Trade. After mentioning the traffic through Tadjura, he told me how difficult it was to stop it in Eritrea, and went on to say that as far as he knew, slaves were embarked from time to time at Shah Shak, and Howakil Island. “ Lepanto ” is never employed on anti-slave patrol. We had seen a good deal of this Officer during the visit to Massawa a year ago, and although he was acting as Captain, during the absence of his Commanding Officer at Addis Ababa, he came over himself as Officer of the Guard to renew our acquaintance. I have little doubt that he is correct in his statements concerning the places mentioned, and it may well be that the slaves referred to as passing North from Dangila, by the Consul at that post, who took passage recently, are those destined for export through Eritrea, ( 10 ) Memoran'dum from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, No. 8, dated the 3ri&gt; February 1931.
