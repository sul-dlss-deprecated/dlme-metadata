The Captain's choice of recruiting a messenger from Muscat in order to communicate with the tribe is also considered to be highly questionable. The letter therefore announces the Captain's removal from his post and impending court martial.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023711596.0x000010#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
