Figures wearing <i>tiraz </i>garments are frequently depicted in ceramics, manuscript illustrations, stucco sculpture, and other figural artworks from the Islamic world during the medieval period. This bowl belongs to a class of enameled ceramics known as <i>haft rang</i> (or &ldquo;seven-color&rdquo;) ware, which were produced uniquely in the Iranian centers of Kashan and Rayy between 1185 and 1250. Often, <i>haft rang</i> ceramics are decorated with detailed narrative scenes, such as the one on this bowl. Other examples bear depictions of personified zodiacal or planetary symbols, while still others are decorated with artistic renderings of historical battles.<br />", "summary": "", "rank": 0, "label_date": "2005-10-18", "date_added": "2009-05-18 14:07:17", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [], "collections": [{"id": 20, "name": "Arts of the Islamic World", "folder": "arts_of_the_islamic_world", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [{"id": 1199, "title": "Realm of Marvels: Building Collections for the Future"}], "related_items": [], "geographical_locations": [{"id": 5172, "name": "Iran", "type": "Place made"}], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "86.227.61_editedversion_SL3.jpg", "id": 133169, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/86.227.61_editedversion_SL3.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/86.227.61_editedversion_SL3.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 81, "height": 96}, {"size": "1", "width": 163, "height": 192}, {"size": "2", "width": 326, "height": 384}, {"size": "3", "width": 653, "height": 768}, {"size": "4", "width": 1306, "height": 1536}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/86.227.61_editedversion_SL3.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": null, "caption": " <em>Bowl with an Enthronement Scene</em>, late 12th-early 13th century.
