Sir, Reference Nominal Roll as on 1-1-43 of the Persian Gulf Clerical Cadre sent with Bushire Printed letter No. 175-64/240, dated the 4th February, 1943. 2. I submit the following facts for favour of consideration with regard to my position in the cadre;- 3. My date of appointment (column)2) is erroneously shown as 1-5-42, and my position in the cadre fixed accordingly below Mr. Narasimha Rao, who joined service here on 30-2-42. As a matter of fact, I was relieved at Karachi on 23-12-41, and joined duty on 6-1-42. My correct position in the cadre must therefore have been shown as below Mr. C.A.D^guer, who joined here on 4-11-41 and above Mr. Maqbul-ur-Rahman, who joined on 23-2-42. 4. I feel that this miscalculation of my seniority was perhaps responsible for my not being given a chance to officiate in the Upper Division, while most of the people who joined service after me are officiating in the Upper Division. 5. I request therefore, that my position in the cadre may be shown correctly, and that favourable consideration be given to my claims, by virtue of seniority, to officiating chances in the Upper Division. I beg to remain. Sir, Your most obedient servant, No.C/279 . Political Agency, Bahrain, the 28th Feb 1943.

To The Political Agent, Bahrain. 11 MEMQliANDmi Please report how many years Government service Mr.V.B.S.Manim has in India, the department under which he was serving and his age. Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf./ z&gt;lz£- , a A.P .A, I request that while reporting to Bushire about my return to Bahrain from leave, they may be asked to incorporate the necessary certificate in ' i I the Office^ Order to enable me to draw the house rent during the period I was on leave. Since I went on a short leave, I had to maintain a house here. M-k-LtVI shall be grateful if you will kindly interest yourself in my case and take such steps as you consider fit in getting me redress. I do not believe in making representations and I do not intend that this should be construed as one, but the following facts will help you in forming a correct picture of the case. I hold a permanent post of lower division clerk in the Karachi Custom House and have a record of 8 years of clean service to my credit. I still hold my lien there. I came here in December 1941. on deputation, and accepted a lower division post, with the object of bettering my position, in the hope that I will be given promotions in due course, consistent with my previous experience and the satisfactory performance of my duties. I find however that though it is over a year and a half since I joined this office and several vacancies occurred in the upper division I was not given any officiating chance, though men, who have bad no previous experience have been posted to such vacancies. I find in the latest nominal roll a long list of persons holding upper division posts, who were recruited after me, Viz;- (1) Mr. Maqbul-ur-Rahman (2) ' J.A.Armstrong. (3) ' N.C»Johannes. (4) Mrs. I.Croning. (5) Mr. J.KoGonsalves. (6) Mr. Mohd Azam Qureshi I believe the criterion to promotion to upper division posts is the ability to discharge more onerfous and responsible work, and to a certain extent seniority. From the time I joined this office, I have been doing responsible and important work e.g. the issue of navicerts, export licences for oil, export licences for goods of non- empire origin, in addition to collection of various import and export statistics. For a considerable time I was doing the passport work, and despite the fact I was new to that work, have given no cause for complaint. I should perhaps mention here that though I have been drawing only lower division emoluments all along, the posts whose work I have been performing are upper divisions. Y/hile I am doing the work, some body else is shown as officiating in these posts and benefitting financially. Taking the new dearness allowance into consideration the loss to me financially is considerable. When on leave recently, I learnt that several juniors in my parent office have been promoted to various higher posts and had I remained there, I would have also received my due promotion. Though it is a fact that these are all only temporary^ as I would have to revert to my old post after the war, and it would be of immediate benefit to me to be given these temporary promotions as these offi ciating chances would be taken into consideration in normal times when any vacancy occurs in a higher post. I lost my chance in my parent office because I was here, and it is very disappointing to see that here also I am being over looked. I shall be grateful if you will kindly consider these facts and if you think I am deserving of promotion, recommend me for the next vacancy in the upper division t if it is not possible to reconsider the postings alreadymade. I should like to reiterate here that I am not putting these facts before you by way of assertion of my claims to any privileges; the authorities must have taken injCB all facts into consideration when making promotions, but sometimes it happens that the man on the spot scores, and the cases of men in outside stations are just forgotten. My case may well be one of the latter. Please excuse me for intruding on your timeD.U .N*. 1408 Political Ag«ncy f Buhmlm Itetad th« 1st July 1943.
