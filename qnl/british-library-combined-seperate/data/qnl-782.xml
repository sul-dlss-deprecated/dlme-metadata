In particular, the correspondence discusses a proposal by C.R.L Adrian-Vallance to establish a college of higher education in Bahrain for students from all of the Arab states of the Gulf.Adrian-Vallance proposed this idea as a means to combat Pan-Arab/anti-British sentiment and foster a sense of Gulf identity distinct from a broader Arab identity. A letter (from Adrian-Vallance to Charles Belgrave, Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa's adviser) that outlines his plan for the college is contained on ff. 7 - 15.The file also includes a detailed report on government education in Bahrain with proposals for reform (written by Adrian-Vallance in 1939) contained on ff. 52b - 126, a report on technical education in Bahrain (written by Geoffrey E. Hutchings in 1940) contained on ff. 160 - 192 and a report written by Adrian-Vallance in May 1940 that gives an update on the progress made in education in Bahrain since his appointment as Director of Education in the country in November 1939.The file also contains correspondence regarding Adrian-Vallance's appointment as Director of Education in Bahrain, including a copy of his contract with Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>James Orton</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Francis Warden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Hugh Weightman</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Khalīfah (Family)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Būshehr</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Education</topic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>National Economy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Religious conflicts</topic></subject><subject><topic>Rights of states</topic></subject><subject><topic>Arab nationalism</topic></subject><subject><topic>Social reform</topic></subject><subject><topic>Economic reform</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00015a#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00015a#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00015a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
