Jia (y&amp; i &gt;S) (• Mesopotamia Administration Committee. hr Proposed extension of Quetta-Nushlvi-DaU&gt;an(iin Railway. 1 . From Viceroy, Army Department, Jane 1017. 9014. Our whole political and strategical position has been altered by recent events in Kussia. The internal dissensions of Russia and the reports as to the resultant inefficiency of her armies lead us to apprehend a renewal of a Gennan-Turldsh movement on Tehran as well as progress eastwards towards Afghanistan of organised hostile bodies. Secondly. The unstable political conditions of Persia, the military failure of llussia, and the reported nomination of Mackensen and Falkenhayn for commands to Asia Minor and Mesopotamia, will make this hostile project more formidable than the last, attempt under Zeiler ; while on this occasion we may have to guard the Perso-Afghan frontier single-handed. Thirdly. The status of the above factors will re-act to our disadvantage in the region for which South Persia Rifles are responsible. Fourthly. Consequent on above, we recommend extension westward of Dalbandin railway in order that (a) we may be in a position to develop and maintain military strength in and northwards of SeUtan, thereby threatening the movement of enemy detachments towards Afghanistan, and denying to them Seistan as a rendezvous and base; (b) from Seistan avg could threaten the Hank of enemy detachments southwards towards Helmand, thus limiting their advance towards our border to the longer and more difficult Hari Rud and Daolat Yar Road ; and the presence of our troops in Seistan will have a steadying effect on Afghanistan ; (c) support can be better afforded to South Persia Rifles in the Kerman province, thereby covering the Baluchistan frontier. FifthIv. For the present these considerations are met by extension to Mirjawa on the Persian frontier, rid Isa Takir Nok Kundi, a route which commends itself on strategical, political, and technical giounds. Cost of construction is roughly estimated at 176 lakhs, which will fall on Indian revenues, and will form an addition to the cuirent years railway programme. Sixthly. Our present commitments in rail supply to oversea theatres will be completed by September, and we request sanction to recommence work on the extension from Dalbandin westwards to Mirjawa as soon as weather is favourable. If new rails are then required overseas, we should be prepared to lift the rails from existing Indian systems. \\ e ask for early reply. From Secretary cj State to Viceroy, Army Department, 24th July 1017. 1598. Your telegram of 20th June, 9611. Nushki-Dalbandin railway xtension Have you considered possibility of using motor lorries htted vith flanged wheels on light rails? See paragraph 19 of Urd Montagus ieport on Mechanical Transport, dated 1st March 191/. Advantages appear o be rapidity of construction and cheapness, while capable of delivering mount of supplies likely to be wanted by force probably employed Seistan. understand difficulties with steam boilers m this district would o.so be .voided. Please telegraph reply as early as possible. S 369 30 8 173. From Viceroy, Army Department, 20th July 1017. . 11^34 Your telegram of tiie —4tli instant, ^o. loO^. JjoicI \Jontagu s proposal war, known°to us but not considered applicable to Dalbandin- Mirjawa extension for following reasons ( 1 , i t i 8 an expedient for working an existing railway temporarily short of rolling stock or with damaged bridges, and not a substitute for a railway extension. (2) Track has to be laid, and this requires railway rolling stock to carry material, particularly where speed of construction is essential as in this case. (3) At least 150 lorries and 300 trailers would be necessary for a daily delivery of 500 tons, which is minimum we should be certain of at Mirjawa for, as mentioned in our telegram of the 29th ultimo. No. 9614, we reckon we may have to maintain larger forces beyond Mirjawa than in 1916. yl) We have not the lorries, nor the trailers, nor personnel for them though we can provide equivalent carrying capacity in railway rolling stock and personnel. The difficulties and delay in obtaining lorries are known to you. (5) It would mean a break in bulk at Dalbandin. (6) Troop movements are not practicable as railway rolling stock needed for conveyance of horses, vehicles. 4. From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Home Department, 4t/i August 1917. 1696. Your telegram dated 29th July 1917, No. 11234, and my telegram of 24th July 1917, No. 1598. It is not understood why you consider daily delivery of 500 tons as minimum you should be certain of at Mirjawa, unless this includes material for construction of railway. It has not so far been contemplated here that you are likely to have more than equivalent of one brigade in Western Seistan and on the Persian border. Also have you settled that alignment Dalbandin-Mirjawa is best final one for the eventual railway? Lord Montagu reports that the 40 Jeffrey Quads cars could be adapted for running on Dalbandin extension as motor lorries, load four tons each. This should ensure daily delivery at Mirjawa of at least 60 tons. Construction of line suitable for motor lorry service would surely be more rapid than for standard gauge railway, and results of accident or derailment less serious. Water supply difficulty also minimised. Your reserve supplies of standard gauge rails, rolling stock and locomotives would not be encroached upon. Some personnel over military age might be obtained here. Driving motor vehicles on rails requires much less skill than on road, and it should be possible to train Indian drivers in a short time. Lastly, cost, considering that you get the motor vehicles for nothing, must be much lower. Please consider these points. 5. From Viceroy, Army Department, 11th August 1917. 11834. Your telegram of the 4th instant. Please see paragraph 4 of our telegram of 29th June, No. 9614, reason 3 of our telegram of the 29th ultimo, No. 11234. (1) The force you mention was sufficient to meet past requirements, but if situation outlined in first part of our No. 9614 arises, it is not prudent to reekoa on less than 500 tAns for the forces necessary to their maintenance, transport and the possibility of further railway extension towards actual theatre. 500 tons daily represents one train load.1 2) Rapidity oj Trying—Axe we to understand your railway advisers favour Lord Montagu s expedient after taking into consideration the urgency of this proposal, the weight of track to be moved forward, the unsuitability of kxiiies as constinotion of trains, the extravagance in personnel and the fact that before construction begins the lorries must be in India. (3) II atcv Supply. Difficulty is minimised by alignment and is nowhere insuperable. As regards alignment, please see paragraph 5 of our No. 9614 of 29th dune, the route was selected after expert survey and after full exam;nation of considerations involved, and is common to all routes westward. (4) As regards encroaching on reserves, a broad-gauge track is necessary in any case and any rails required will have either to be rolled or lifted from existing railways. Broad-gauge rolling stock can be diverted on emergency from the Indian railway systems and normal requirements of line will be small, whereas we have no reserve of lorries or motor transport personnel to draw on and would want to apply to England both at a time when immediate action would be essential. (5) As regards personnel, the conditions of life on this desert route try the strongest and would be too severe for men over military age, even if available. The training of Indian drivers has not been lost sight of. We see no prospect yet of getting numbers we require for other purposes within a reasonable time. (6) As regards cost, initial outlay of Lord Montagu’s proposals may be lower, but in return for it we have a 60-ton output and a line valueless in the future except for motor lorry traffic, unable to support effectually military operations and useless for troop movement as brought to your notice in our Xo. 11234. (7) It appears from the correspondence which has arisen since our telegram No. 9614, of 29th June, that you have in mind only the present problem, whereas we contemplate the more serious problem therein presented to you, and we are endeavouring to prepare tor a military situation which may arise so rapidly that there will be no time to rectify mistakes. Therefore we are not prepared to adopt an untried expedient. (8) Lastly, we wish to draw attention to the fact that the shortness of the favourable season for railway construction is appioacnmg and that considerable preparations are necessary before actual work commences. 6 . India Office to War Office. No. 29331. (Immediate.) India Office, -• r ~ ' ' 15th August 1917. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the nformafcion of the Army Council, a copy of telegraphic correspondence vith the Government of India, and an extract from the proceedings of the Mesopotamia Administration Committee, on the subject of a proposed extension of the Nushki-Dalbandin Railway to the 1 ersian I rentier. In view of the importance which the Government of India attaches to Lis proposal, and to the explanations contained m the correpondence, Mr. Secretary Montagu would be glad to be informed as early as possible whether the 'Council concur in the proposal adumbrated in the telegram So. 96U of 29th June 1917. I have, &amp;e., . , H. V. Con, The Secretary. War Office. 1 .ieutenant-Geireral.War Office to India Office. No. 0164/3514. (M. 0.2.)

I am, Ac., The Under Secretary of State B. B. CumiT. ■frvr Inn in 8 . Extract from telegram from Commander-m-Chief, India, to General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia, dated hth August 1917. {Repeated to War Office.) 5599S. After having examined position with care as regards supply of railway personnel, and basing calculation on demand received and forecast given up to date, we now expect to be short at end of August in important categories. Every endeavour being made to meet your demands w'ith active co operation of Railway Board. Schools were started as soon as magnitude of demands for East Africa and Mesopotamia made it apparent that ordinary methods of recruitment would not suffice. These have as yet had no time to take effect. As we are dependent on volunteers, no exact forecast of position can be given, and figures are approximate only. Position rendered more difficult by numerous additions and entirely unforeseen demands upsetting all previous forecasts. Recruiting proceeding at highest pressure but in present depleted state of Indian railways, and pending out-turn from schools no immediate increase in output can he counted on. Though the railways in India will do their best to spare what they can, you must remember that their resources are not unlimited, and that they have to 'meet the demands of East Africa where wastage is high. Above is as much as you can count on for the present and it indicates necessity for economy in demands. It is for you to decide whether such economy can be effected by reducing commercial traffic. 9.
