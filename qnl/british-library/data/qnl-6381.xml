GOVERNMENT IN 1914 CASE FOR THE OPINION OF THE LAW OFFICERS OF THE CROWN AND OPINION THEREONThe Date Gardens in Iraq of the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah Scope of undertakings given by h. M. Government in 1914 CASE FOR THE OPINION OF THE LAW OFFICERS OF THE CROWN AND OPINION THEREON 1. This case raises certain questions respecting the nature and scope of undertakings given by His Majesty s Government in 1914 to the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah (documents 1 and 2 in the Appendix, pp. 8 and 9), upon which the Treasury desire to have the opinion of the Law Officers. 2. Certain aspects of the problems raised by these under takings were submitted to the Law Officers in May, 1930, by the Colonial Office. The questions then submitted related in the main to issues which had arisen as between His Majesty's Government and the Iraqi Government. The question which now .falls to be considered is whether in the circumstances hereinafter described any legal obligation rests- on His Majesty's Government vis-a-vis the Sheikhs themselves. 3. The circumstances in which the undertakings in question came to be given can, so far as they are relevant to the present question, be stated shortly as follows :— 4. In 1914 His Majesty's Government were desirous of obtain ing the assistance of the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah against Turkey, and letters were accordingly addressed to them by the Resident and Consul-General in the Persian Gulf, in which the nature of the assistance desired was indicated and certain promises were made in return. The letters, documents 1 and 2 in the Appen dix, were in different terms but for present purposes it is necessary only to quote the following extracts. In the letter to the Sheikh of Koweit dated 3rd November, 1914, the following passage occurs- ' Furthermore I make to you, on behalf of the British Government, certain promises concerning Your Excellency personally, viz. :— ' (1) That your gardens which are now in your possession viz. the date gardens situate between Fao and Qurnah shall remain in your possession and in possession of your descendants without being subject to the payment of taxes or imposts.' In the letter to the Sheikh of Mohammerah dated 21st Novem ber, 1914, it was stated :— ' Further the date gardens which you now possess on the Turkish side of the Shatt-el-Arab shall remain in full possession of you and your heirs and immune from taxa tion.' . , r The reason why a variant of the expression '' immune from taxation ' appears in the letter to the Sheikh of Koweit is explained in paragraph 13 below. A 187862 5. The date gardens referred to in these letters are situated in territory which has become part of Iraq. Iraq is now an inde pendent sovereign state and the literal fulfilment of the under takings in question could therefore only have been rendered possible if His Majesty's Government had retained some measure of control over the Government of Iraq or had placed upon that Government an express treaty obligation to concede the immunity from taxa tion to which the undertakings refer. Unfortunately this was not done and His Majesty's Government have since found it impossible to induce the Iraqi Government to admit any obligation in the matter; and for various reasons (into which it is unnecessary for the present purpose to eiiter) it has not been thought desirable to submit the dispute between His Majesty's Government and Iraq, upon which your predecessors advised in 1930, to the Permanent Court of International Justice, or any other international tribunal. Since therefore His Majesty's Government are not in a position to give literal effect to the undertakings given to the Sheikhs, the question arises whether there is a legal obligation on His Majesty's. Government to pay compensation to the Sheikhs on account of certain events relating to the date gardens now taking place in Iraq, upon the assumption that His Majesty's Government fail to prevent them. This question must depend, in the first place, on whether* these events are or are not contrary to the promises to the Sheikhs referred to in the preceding paragraph, and this is the matter upon which the opinion of the Law Officers is now desired. The events in question are {a) the levy upon the produce of these gardens by the Iraqi Government of a particular kind of tax called the Istihlak tax; (6) the institution by private persons in Iraq of proceedings in the Iraq courts (hitherto successful) for the recovery of possession from the Sheikh of Koweit of certain of the gardens possessed by him. There are therefore two separate questions, and it will be convenient to deal with {a) first. 6. For some time after the creation of the Kingdom of Iraq, the system of taxation in that territory included a tax on land based upon and fundamentally similar to the Turkish tax which was in force at the time when the undertakings were given to the Sheikhs. The method of determining the amount of the tax varied according to the nature of the land, the character of the crops, the system of irrigation employed, etc.; but in the case of the large estates in Basra similar to the properties of the Sheikhs the assessment was based on a valuation of the area under cultivation. The tax was in all cases payable bv the landowner, leaseholder or occupier of the land in question. It is not disputed that the levy of this tax upon the Sheikhs would have been contrary to the promises of His Majesty's Government and although this tax was as a matter of Iraqi law considered to be exigible in respect of the date gardens owned by the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah, the High Com missioner was able, by putting pressure on the Iraqi authorities from time to time, to induce them to refrain from actually collect ing it. 7. In June, 1931, however, a new system of taxation was introduced which replaced the previous tax upon land by a tax upon produce. The text of the law instituting this tax will be found in document No. 3 in the Appendix, p. 9 et seq. Under this law no tax is imposed upon land as such, nor is any produce which is re tained for consumption by the occupier of the land or his family subject to tax. The new tax, which is known as the ' Istihlak tax,' is levied only upon that portion of the produce of land which is sold or stored or transformed into another shape by artificial means, or exported from Iraq. It is collected not from the land owner or occupier as such, but from the person who sells the produce or from the exporter who ships it abroad who may or may not bethe owner or occupier of the land yielding the produce. Thus in its method of assessment and collection the tax is somewhat similar to an excise or export duty. 8. The collection of the new tax in respect of the produce of the Sheikhs' date gardens is now being enforced, and the first of the two questions on which the opinion of the Law Officers is desired is whether the levy of this tax on the produce of these date gardens involves a breach of the undertakings given to the Sheikhs in 1914 that their date gardens should be immune from taxes or imposts or from taxation as the case may be. It will be appreciated that in their capacity as proprietors of these gardens the Sheikhs will not be called upon to pay any tax, but in so far as they themselves, or their agents, sell or export the produce of the gardens they will be liable to pay the Istihlak tax on the produce thus sold or ex ported. It should be mentioned, however, although the point is not strictly relevant to the legal question in issue, that the pro visions of the new law will in practice press with particular hard ship on the Sheikhs, since they do not reside in Iraq and con sequently all produce which may be used for their own consumption and the maintenance of their families and retainers and which is necessarily taken out of Iraq will be liable to the tax; whereas a person residing in Iraq will be exempt from the tax in respect of such part of the produce of his property as is consumed in loco. 9. The issue can therefore be shortly stated as follows, viz. whether the date gardens in question must be regarded as subject to the payment of taxes or imposts in the one case or as no longer *' immune from taxation in the other, by reason of the fact that this tax is levied on all the produce of those gardens sold or ex ported from Iraq. 10. In view of the circumstances in which the undertakings were given and the parties to the bargain thus made, it is doubtful whether anv assistance can be obtained from any decisions of the English Courts relating to statutory exemptions from taxation. Reference may however be made to two well-known cases. 1 he best known case is probably that of the Associated Newspapers Limtted v City of London Corporation (1926 2 A.C. 429) in which it was decided that the Statute 7 Geo. 3 c. 37, which authorised various improvements in the City of London and provided {inter aha) that land reclaimed from the bed of the Thames should vest in the owners of the adjoining land ' free from all taxes and assessments what soever ', extended not only to taxes and assessments in existence at the time the Act was passed, but also to taxes and assessments sub sequently imposed and which were not mere substitutes for such as existed when the Statute first became operative. In the present case it clearly cannot even be suggested that the undei taking gi\en at the outbreak of war in 1914 had regard only to existing taxation im posed under Turkish laws; indeed the whole basis of the undertaking was that the territory in question would, it was confidently hoped, cease to be under Turkish rule. 11. The only other case to which it is thought the attention of the Law Officers might perhaps be drawn is that of (7% o/ Halifax v. Nova Scotia Car U orks lAd. (1914 A.C. 992), in which the Privy Council decided that where under an agreement with the City Corporation the company were entitled to ' a total exemption from taxation ' for ten years on certain land, the company could not be called upon to contribute towards the cost of constructing a sewer under a clause in the City's Charter which provided that owners of property fronting on any sewer laid by the Corporation should contribute to its cost according to their frontage. Some of the remarks in the judgment in this case respecting the point of view from which a Court is likely to consider cases where one partyto a bargain involving relief from taxation claims that he has pei formed all that he has promised to do, may perhaps be regarded as of general application. 12. In the present case there can be little doubt that the Istihlak is a ' tax ' strictly so called; and the question thereroie appears to be whether on their true construction and having regard to the circumstances in which and the persons to whom they were given the undertakings given to the Sheikhs extend to taxation not levied on the gardens themselves as such but on their produce. Do they, for example, extend only to taxes creating a liability which arises from the simple fact of occupation or ownership ot land, or do they include also a tax creating liability which only arises if the landowner chooses to export or sell some part of the produce of that land, and then payable not by the landowner as such, but by the seller or exporter. 13. It is important to examine the actual language used in the undertakings given to the two Sheikhs. When the drafts were under consideration in 1914 the wording approved for both letters v/as ' The date gardens which you now possess .... shall remain in the full possession of you and your heirs and be immune from taxation '. An authenticated copy of the actual Arabic letter received by the Sheikh of Koweit has been obtained. The words in this which correspond to ' immune from taxation in the English draft are Arabic words which are literally translated ' without there being upon them anything in the nature of taxes or imposts ' . Evidently Colonel Knox, the writer of the Arabic letter, used two more or less synonymous Arabic words to give the sense of taxation quite generally and comprehensively. (There is no reason to suppose that the Arabic of the letter sent to the Sheikh of Mohammerah is not the same as that of the letter sent to the Sheikh of Koweit in the particular, but as copy of it is not available here, the copy sent herewith follows the original English draft). It will thus be seen that the pledge in regard to taxation is quite general and not ex pressed as limited to particular kinds of taxes. At the same time it seems clear that this exemption is not a personal exemption simpliciter in the sense that it implies that the Sheikh is entitled to reside in the gardens and claim to be exempt from all taxation of every kind which may be imposed on persons resident in Iraq; it is quite definitely linked up with the possession of the gardens and it seems reasonable therefore to limit it to taxation the liability to which is closely connected with the gardens themselves. 14. It is necessary to consider very closely the exact nature of the tax recently imposed. It may be regarded on the one hand as merely a trader's tax in the sense that it is primarily a tax on produce sold or exported; or on the other it may be regarded as merely a variant of the earlier form of tax based on the value of the land under cultivation and therefore as bearing a very close re semblance to that tax. 15. Admittedly the earlier form of tax fell within the terms of the undertaking and the question is therefore whether in all the circumstances the present tax can be regarded as so far divorced from the land itself as to bring it outside the terms used by the Kesident in his letter. As has been explained above, the new tax is not levied on the landowner as such and may indeed not be paid by the Landowner himself at all except in so far as he mav by reason of its existence have to accept a lesser price for his produce. It is therefore a tax on produce, but not on the produce as such of any particular garden or plantation; nor does the produce attract the tax until it has been severed and has been sold or ex ported. But since neither of the Sheikhs is resident in Iraq, the whole of the produce of their gardens (other than that consumed by5 the resident cultivators) does in fact attract the tax in the process of being sent to their places of residence for the consumption of their families and retainers. 16. Two views of the matter may it is thought conceivably be taken : (1) that the undertaking ought to be beneficially con strued in the light of the practical effect of the new tax; and that as the Sheikhs are necessarily resident elsewhere than in Iraq, and since the produce of their gardens will with only trifling exceptions, always and necessarily attract the tax, because the produce is always and necessarily exported from Iraq for their consumption, the tax in their case is in fact a tax upon the produce of their gardens and therefore within the undertakings; and (2) that the undertakings are limited to taxes levied on the land itself and upon the owner ship or occupation of the land, and the Istihlak tax is not a tax on land but on produce as such, divorced from the ownership or occupation of land, and therefore not within the terms of either undertaking. 17. To turn now to the second question which affects only the gardens in the possession of the Sheikh of Koweit. Tt appears that certain legal proceedings have been instituted against him in the Iraqi Courts at the suit of private persons claiming to be entitled to part of the gardens in his possession. In one such case the Court of Cassation at Baghdad has decided on appeal in favour of the plaintiff; and further proceedings of a similar nature are pending. It is therefore necessary to consider whether the pledge given to the Sheikh in 1914 imposes on His Majesty's Government any obligation in respect of such portions of the gardens in his physical possession in 1914 as the Iraqi Courts may decide are not the Sheikh's property. It is clearly beyond the power of His Majesty's Government to maintain the Sheikh in physical possession of property in Iraq which may be declared by the Iraqi Courts not to belong to him, and any liability must therefore be for payment of compensation. 18. The answer to this question would seem to depend on whether the undertaking given in 1914 ought, on its true construc tion, to be regarded as applying to a given area of land of which the Sheikh was at that time in physical possession or whether it relates only to such portions of that area as legally belong to him; in other words, has the pledge that certain gardens ' shall remain in his possession ' any application to property of which the Sheikh is^ dispossessed by the ordinary process of law, and as the result of sl judgment in the Iraqi Courts? It is thought that the circum stances in which the pledge was given must be taken into account. 19. The general historv of the case is contained in the accom panying Memorandum by tlie Political Agent, Koweit, document No. 4 in the appendix, p. 16. The essential points are, firstly, that from 1899 onwards His Majesty's Government were anxious to establish their political position in Koweit in the face of claims by the Turks that the Sheikh was an Ottoman subject; that with this end in view H.M.G. entered into secret engagements with the Sheikh; that in the years 1907 and following the Sheikh made certain large purchases of land in the then vilayet of Basra; that the Turkish authorities, apparently with a view to bringing pressure to bear on the Sheikh, refused to allow him to arrange for the necessary appearance before the Tapu department, with a view to declanng the validity of the sale, as was required by law, or to allow him to take possession, unless he registered himself as a Turkish national; that consequent on an appeal by the Sheikh to H.M.G. he was instructed not to take out Turkish nationality papers, but to have the stamped deeds secretly registered in the British Consulate at Basra; and that general discussions over thi&amp; and other points affecting the status of Koweit proceeded between 187866 H.M.G. and the Turkish Government until 1911, when tliey be came merged in negotiations for the regularisation of the various questions in issue between H.M.G. and the Turkish Government in this area. Those negotiations culminated in the Anglo- Turkish Convention signed by the representatives oi both parties on 29th July 1913. A section of the Convention in question regularised the position of the Sheikh of Koweit vis-a-vis both the Turkish and British Governments; and, with the history of the dispute which had taken place over the date gardens in view, one of the articles of the section in question provided that the Sheikh should enjoy in full security and in accordance with Otto man Law the rights of private property which he possessed in the Vilayet of Basra. This convention had not been ratified, how ever, when war broke out with Turkey in 1914. 20. From the copy of the Judgment given by the Court of Cassation in Baghdad which is also enclosed (document No. 5 in the Appendix, p. 19) it will be seen that the failure of the Sheikh to take the formal steps necessary in regard to the registration of the documents of title with the Turkish authorities before the War, as described above, is one of the grounds on which he may be ■adjudged not to be the lawful owner of the gardens of which he is in possession and that it appears to have been strongly urged upon the Court. It is not clear whether this omission was or was not in itself a vital point in the decision already given, in the sense that but for this point the decision would have been in favour of the Sheikh, but it may well be thought in view of the history ot matter prior to the giving of the undertakings, which is set out in the Memorandum of the Political Agent (No. 4, p. 16) that to the extent to which it was vital in that case or may be vital in any similar case which may be brought against the Sheikh here after, His Majesty's Government cannot refuse to recognise an obligation to compensate the Sheikh for any loss which he may have suffered as the result of his refusal to take the necessary steps to register his title because that involved his acceptance of the position of a subject of Turkey, and that would have been contrary to the policy which His Majesty's Government were urging upon him. It is clear that the question of the registration of his title to the gardens and the then recent difficulties created by non registration must have been fresh in the minds of the Sheikh and the Political Resident at the time when the undertaking to the Sheikh was given in 1914. In this connection it may be significant that the first draft of the letter to be sent to the Sheikh in 1914 read . youi date gardens between lao and Gurneh shall remain in the full possession of you and your heirs ....', and that the Government of India deliberately directed the replacement of the words your date gardens ' by the words ' date gardens which you now possess '. It was in consequence of this change in the draft made by the Government of India that the pledge in the letter sent to the bheikh of 3rd November actually reads ' Your gardens which are now in your possession ti / t t ^' J he ^ aw Oncers will also see from the Memorandum by Mr. E. Alexander (Acting Judicial Adviser to the Iraq Govern ment) No. 6 in the appendix, p. 21, that there are grounds for doubting whether the decision of thet Court on the question of the application of certain laws relating to the period of time necessary to prevent a title by adverse possession is correct. The question is one of Ottoman law on which English lawyers can scarcely express a definite opinion, but information obtained from an expert on the subject appears to afford some ground for holding that the doubt is well founded and that if the appropriate law had been correctly applied the Sheikh would not have been deprived of his Vi T , he q uestlon ma y then arise whether the obligations of His Majesty s Government are affected in any way by the correctness or otherwise of the decision of the Iraqi Courts. The Sheikh does7 not hesitate to allege something akin to a conspiracy to dc-prive him of his gardens on political grounds, and the Law Officers may be of opinion that in these circumstances it is incumbent on His Majesty's Government to examine for themselves the basis of any decision against the Sheikh; and that if, as the result of that examination, in the course of which opinions would of course be obtained from experts in Ottoman law, it should be decided that the decision against the Sheikh is contrary to the justice of the case, His Majesty's Government come under a legal obligation to compensate the Sheikh for property which was then in his posses sion, but of which on this basis he has been wrongfully deprived. THE LAW OFFICERS are requested to advise :— 1. Whether having regard to the terms of the under takings given in 1914, the imposition of the Istihlak tax on the produce of the date gardens of the Sheikh of Koweit and the Sheikh of Mohammerah involves any breach of those undertakings and whether as a result any obligation resta on His Majesty's Government to compensate the Sheikhs. 2. Whether His Majesty's Government are under any obligation to compensate the Sheikh of Koweit in respect of any portion of the gardens in the possession of his pre decessor in 1914 of which he may be deprived in consequence of a Judgment of the competent Iraqi Courts. 3. Whether it is material for the purposes of the last question to consider (a) whether the basis of the judgment of the Iraqi Courts is the failure by the Sheikh to register certain documents in 1914; that failure having been admittedly due to the fact that the Sheikh, in accordance with the wishes of His Majesty's Govern ment, refused to declare himself a Turkish subject, or {h) whether the Judgment of the Iraqi Courts is or is not in-accordance with the justice of the case; that is to say whether in the event of His Majesty's Government 'being of opinion that the decision of the Iraqi Courts is wrong, any liability to compensate the Sheikh arises. 4.

Letter dated 3rd November, 1914, from Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Ruler of Kuwait and Dependencies, Kuwait. After compliments. In continuation of previous letter intimating the outbreak of war between the British Government and Turkey, I am ordered by the British Government to convey to your Excellency gratitude for your loyalty and your offer of assistance, and to request you to attack Umm Qasr Safwan and Bubiyan and to occupy them. You should endeavour, afterwards, in co-operation with Shaikh Sir Khazai Khan, Amir Abdul Azin bin Saud and other reliable Shaikhs to liberate Basrah from Turkish possession. Should this prove to be beyond your ability, you should make arrangements, if possible, to prevent Turkish reinforcements from reaching Basrah or even Qurnah, until the arrival of the British troops whom we shall send, please God, as soon as possible. T also hope that two of our men- of-war will reach Basrah before the arrival of your troops there. And though it should be your highest aim, in this connection, to liberate Basrah and its people from Turkish rule, still we request that you should use your utmost endeavour in preventing troops and others from plundering the merchandise belonging to British mer chants in Basrah and its dependencies, to protect the European resi dents of Basrah and to safeguard them from loss and oppression. In return for your valuable assistance in this important matter, I am ordered by the British Government to promise to Your Excellency that if we succeed therein—and we shall succeed therein, please God—we will not return Basrah to the Turkish Government, and we will not surrender it back to them at all. Furthermore I make to you, on behalf of the British Government, certain promises concerning Your Excellency personally, viz. :— (1) that your gardens which are now in your posses sions, viz., the date gardens situate between Fao and Qurnah, shall remain in your possession and in possession of your descendants without being subject to the payment of taxes or imposts; (2) that if you attack Safwan, Umm Qasr and Bubiyan and occupy them, the British Government will protect you from any consequences arising from that action; (3) that the British Government does recognise and admit that the Shaikhdom of Kuwait is an independent Government under British protection. I request that you will be good enough to read the enclosed letter and transmit the same to the Amir of Najd at the earliest convenience. I have addressed a letter to the Shaikh of Moham- merah similar to this I am writing you. I I am confident of your old-established friendship with the exalted Government, and I believe that Your Excellency will use your endeavour in these important matters, in every respect. I avail myself of this opportunity to assure you of my high esteem, and may you continue to remain preserved and salaams. (Signed) S. G. KNOX, Resident and H.B.M.'s Consul General in the Persian Gulf.DOCUMENT 2.

With reference to the assurance conveyed to Your Excellency in my letter No. 307 dated 15th October, 1910 (11th Shawwal 1328) and having regard to the further valued services and co-operation, which Your Excellency has rendered to the British Government and to British interests in Arabistan and the Shatt-al-Arab, I am now authorised to assure Your Excellency personally, and to do so by this writing, that whatever change may take place in the form of the Government of Persia, and whether it be Royalist or Nationalist, His Majesty's Government will be prepared to afford you the support necessary for obtaining a solution satisfactory both to yourself and to us in the event of any encroachment by the Persian Government on your jurisdiction and recognised rights or on your property in Persia. In like manner they will safeguard you to the best of their ability against any unprovoked attack by a foreign power or against any encroachment by such power on your jurisdiction and recognised rights or on your property in Persia. These assurances are given for yourself and for your successors from among your male descendants, and shall hold good so long as you and they do not fail to observe your and their obligations towards the Persian Government provided that the nomination of your successors from among your male descendants shall be subject to confidential consultation with, and the approval of His Majesty's Government, and so long as you and they shall continue to be guided by the advice of His Majesty's Government and to maintain an attitude satisfactory to that Government. Vis-a-vis the Persian Government, we shall do our best to maintain Your Excellency in your present state of local autonomy. Further, the date gardens which you now possess on the Turkish side of the Shatt-al-Arab shall remain in full possession of you and your heirs and immune from taxation. (Signed) P. Z.

DOCUMENT 4. Memorandum by the Political Agent, Koweit. Note on a conversation which the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf had with the Shaikh of Kuwait on 25th October, 1931, regarding the new Iraq ' Istihlah ' tax, with special reference to the effect such tax would have on the Kuwait properties on the Shatt-al-Arab, if it were enforced. In the course of a general conversation on this subject and in reply to several questions put by the Honourable the Political Resi dent, the Shaikh made the following points. Under the old system, a garden owner had to pay his tax according to the number of ' jaribs ' he owned, and not according to the number or size of his date trees. This shortly was the system in force in Turkish times in Basrah. In the Muntafik and some other Liwas, the system was different, and a tax was levied on each date tree a garden owner possessed, and to encourage the owner to cultivate the ground under the trees, which improved the country side and incidentally the palm-tree itself, a reduction was made in the rate of tax taken per tree in accordance as the garden was ' amar ' (cultivated) or 44 kharab (uncultivated).17 In Basrah therefore if a man had a large garden and a small area under dates he stood to lose as compared to the man who had ia small or even similar sized garden which was all under dates. It was the discontent caused by the above system which prob ably brought the new proposed tax into the sphere of practical politics. Actually there was method in the Turks ' madness ' for behind the idea was the desire to encourage landlords who were careless garden owners like the ' Saadun ' families to put down an in creased number of date trees each year, by penalizing the man with a large area and few trees in favour of the man who took the trouble to grow the maximum number of trees possible on his plot of land. 2. When asked how the collection of the new tax would work in the case of an ordinary garden owner who lived on his property, the Shaikh replied that as far as he understood the proposed new law which he had read, the garden owner would, after cutting down his dates, put what he, his family and fellaheen required for their own personal use, on one side. This would not be subject to taxation. The balance he would collect on his sif ' i.e., the river bank, until he could find a buyer. Such buyer coming along, would pay cash down for what he bought, and remove the dates, either for export by dhow or steamer. As such buyer would eventually have to pay the ' ashur ' or 10 per cent government date tax, he naturally would deduct this amount from the price paid for the dates, i.e., the market price, while each year is fixed by a com mittee for the whole of the Basrah date area, and would still-further have to allow for his own profit, after deducting carriage expenses to dhow or ship, packing, etc. It was of course the buyer's business also to keep in touch with the Customs authorities, take out necessary documents, and pay the 'Ashur' tax. The garden owner had no responsibility in this direction at all. Should, on the other hand, the garden owner in question be faced with a bad year, and be unable to find a buyer vat all, then his produce remained with him, and was either thrown into the river, or sold for a song, to wandering shepherds. Bedouin or other migrating elements, who during the date season are usually to be found camped on the desert side of gardens seeking what they can pick up cheap or steal. The garden owner in this case pays nothing to Government and the latter loses the ' Ashur ' tax due from his dates. 3. The Political Resident then asked the Shaikh how he thought the new law would work if applied to the five great Kuwait properties situate on the lower reaches of the Shatt-al-Arab. The Shaikh without hesitation replied that it would fall harder on himself than, if he had to pay the ordinary ' jarib ' taxation, as used to exist. 4. When asked to explain how he arrived at this conclusion, the Shaikh pointed out:— {a) That he was not in the same position as the resident garden owner, for he was both an absentee landlord, and worse, resided outside Iraq. Actually he employed only ' fallahs ' (or gardeners) in the gardens and these were the only persons w r ho resided there. Hence under the new law only these resident fellaheen would be entitled to take their share of dates free of taxation, while he and the remaining 100 branch families of the al-Subah who resided in Kuwait would presumably have to pay the ' Ashur ' taxation on the large stores of dates, garden produce, fruit, wood, palm fronds, barley, fodder, lucerne grass, etc., which was annually brought to Kuwait for their own use, under the plea that they had been exported from the garden areas, and also out of Iraq.18 In this connection the Shaikh pointed out that the amounts brought to Kuwait by himself did not merely include- that share of the garden produce which he and the 1U0 junior families of the al-Subah (numbering some 1,000 souls, I sup pose), had a right to, in their capacity as joint shareholders in the estates, but included the annual free food ration of his body-guard and paid 44 fidawi ' land forces numbering some 500 men who with their families all received half their pay in kind and half in cash. The former apart from rice (obtained in India), was practically all obtained from the produce of his Shatt-al-Arab estates. (b) Again in the matter of the date produce which the Shaikh ' exported ' overseas to India, the Ked Sea,. Zanzibar, etc., the Shaikh pointed out that he came under a different category to the ordinary garden owner of Basrah or the well-known Arab and European merchants who annually bought up and exported dates from Basrah seeing that in a sense he was both owner and exporter. And while the latter class, both Arab and Europeans, purchased direct from individual garden owners and paid cash down for the produce, he as Shaikh of Kuwait sold nothing to these ex porting merchants but instead dealt with his own merchants of Kuwait who nearly all owned regular fleets of dhow. East Indian men which made annual voyages to either India, the Red Sea, East Africa or Zanzibar, taking as out ward cargoes Basrah dates, and bringing back ship-loads of wood, beams, spices, rice, building material, etc. The system under which this export business was conducted was as follows :— The Shaikh, who it must not be forgotten runs his estate on our old feudal lines, annually and before the dates are ripe sends for his leading Kuwait merchants (largely also pearl dealers) and enquiries if any of them will take up cargoes of dates from his estates. The response is generally good, and that part of the produce of the gardens previously ear marked for overseas export, is now sold to these local merchants. The method of sale is as follows :—The dates are sold by the gosara (basket) at the rate pre vailing at Basrah, hut no cash passes hands, instead the buyers sign documents promising to pay the Shaikh his money, after one, two or three voyages (i.e., years), as the case may be, and only after they have disposed of their return cargoes. These signed docu ments are deposited with the Shaikh, who recovers his money gradually, and by a method which bears easily on his merchants and keeps his overseas dhow trade alive. Under this method dhow captains on behalf of their principals do the actual trading and with the money which they realise from the sale of the dates they carry, they buy their return cargoes. In bad trading years as at present return cargoes fetch little, and often merchants have to ask the Shaikh for an extension of the period of repayment. The latter naturally assists more often than not, for his policy is literally to be the ' father of his people.' 5. Taking therefore the above two systems (paragraph 4 {a) and {b) for dealing with the produce of his date gardens in Iraq, it was clear, the Shaikh pointed out, that he himself would have to find the ' Ashur ' tax both in the case of :— {a) Dates and garden produce exported to Kuwait for state purposes. (ft) Dates exported to foreign countries by Kuwait dhow owners.19 In the former case, because, according to the letter of the law, the goods would be taxable, he being the owner-exporter of the produce, and in the latter case because the merchants exporters (the dhow owners) would not be paying for the dates till they returned from India, etc., and had disposed of their return cargoes. They would naturally expect the Shaikh to pay the Iraq date-tax on the top of the credit he had given, they promising to pay same back on settlement day. 6. Even if it could be arranged by negotiation with the Iraq Government that the produce sent to Kuwait (for family and state use), paragraph 4 (a), should be exempt from taxation, the Shaikh pointed out that much irritating accounting and checking by officials at both ends would be involved, and he did not see how in any case, he could avoid having to deposit large guarantee sums to the various- Iraq officials in control, which would only be released after docu ments had been received from Kuwait to say that the goods had arrived. The conforming to such cumbersome and irritating methods before he could get the produce of his own gardens to Kuwait was in view of the Shaikh unthinkable, especially as it would lay Kuwait open to the danger of perpetual demands from rapacious junior Iraq officials for largesse, etc. (Sgd.) H. E. P. DICKSON, Lieut.-Colonel. Political Agent, Kuwait. Dated 21st November, 1931. DOCUMENT 5. Translation of a decree No. 66/932 dated 9th May, 1932, issued by the Court of Appeal, Baghdad, for service on Shaikh Ahmad Jabir A1 Sabah, Ruler of Kuwait. Appellor : Shaikh Ahmad A1 Jabir. A1 Sabah (Defendant). Represented by Lawyer Iskandar Mansur Effendi. Appellee : Rafi'ah daughter of 'Ali Pasha Ai Zuhair (I laintift)^ Represented by Lawyer Kamal Effendi Al Sanawi. The Iraqi Court of Revision, formed of Daud Effendi Samrah, Vice-President, and 'Abdullah Effendi Salam and Antoine Effendi Shammas, Members, empowered to adjudicate in the name of His- Majesty the King of Iraq, met in its capacity as a Court oi Appeal on 9th May, 1932, and passed the following judgment The Plaintiff submitted a complaint to the Court of First Instance, Basrah, stating that she owns certain shares of a plot of land which is situated at Eaddaghiyah, the boundaries ot which are known, transferred to her from her father and mother. As the Defendant is opposing her she requests that he should be prohibited from opposing her and that he should pay the (court) fees. On 30th December, 1931, the court in question issued a judg ment in the case No. 77/31 prohibiting the Defendant from opposing- the Plaintiff in (the administration of) her It shares out ot 21b shares, and what has been transferred to her from the 16 shares belono-ino- to her mother Shafiqah, out of 120 shares of the plot ot land under dispute, and compelling him to pay the fees as it has been proved in the Khaqani register that the Plaintiff and her brothers and sisters own 85 shares, and that the 1 laintiff s mother - owned 27 shares which, at the death of the latter, have been trans ferred to her heirs including the Plaintiff. It has been proved that the person now administering the land is the Defendant who bases his ownership on an ordinary document of sale. This document cannot be recognised as it includes the sale of immovable property while the seller was not the only guardian of the Plaintiff. There fore the effect of this sale by her cannot be recognised.20 The Defendant appealed against this judgment on the grounds that Lawyer Agob Effendi had attended the hearing in his capacity as the Agent of the Plaintiff at the time when the latter had dis missed him, thus his participation in this case, in accordance with a special (ordinary) power of attorney, is illegal; that he (the Defendant) administered the land for a period exceeding the 44 period of prescription ' provided for in the Indian Law of Limitation which was in force in Basrah, which makes the hearing of the case illegal; that he hnno -bt the shares belonging to the administered the land prior to the date of the document of sale, and therefore the non-hearing of his personal (oral) evidence was illegal. Moreover the civil ' period of prescription ' as well passed this ' tasarruf In case the land is considered as miri land the Land Law should be applied thereto. The sale, which was made in accordance with the power of attorney, was effected with the permission of the Sharia Court. Had the sale been regarded as illegal, a judgment should have been passed to the effect that the money received by the Appellee through her guardian should be refunded. In view of the above the Appellor demanded that the judgment be reversed and the Plaintiff's case rejected, and that the Appellee should pay the court fees etc. The following is the summary of the written statement in reply : The Indian Law of Limitation does not apply to this case. More over the period between the dates of its enforcement and repeal is less than the ' period of prescription and the request made by the Appellor to hear his evidence regarding ' tasarruf ' and the application of the ' period of prescription ' is not reasonable as he based his ' tasarruf on an ordinary document of sale which states that the Appellee owns these shares. This confession refutes the ' period of prescription.' As the sale of miri land effected without the permission of the Mamur of Khaqani register is con sidered illegal, the ' tasarruf ' of the Appellor is also illegal, and in this case the provisions of the Land Law cannot be applied. As the Appellor did not raise a case in the past demanding that the price should be refunded, he has no right now to claim that price. As regards the sale permission deed, it cannot now be considered as he (the Appellor) did not present it in the Court of First Instance. The independence of one of the guardians in the administration of the property of minors is invalid. In view of the above it is re quested that the judgment from which this appeal has been lodged should be approved and that the Appellor be charged to pay the court fees etc. On the date fixed for the trial, Lawyer Iskandar Mansur Effendi, Agent of the Appellor, and Lawyer Kamal Effendi Al Sanawi, Agent of the Appellee, appeared before the Court and repeated the contents of their written statements respectively. The case having been heard the Court withdrew for discussion. As a result of the examination of the case by the Court of Appeal the important objections raised by the Appellor have been summarised as follows : — (1) That the hearing of the case was attended by Agob Effendi, as Agent of the Appellee, after withdrawing her power of attorney in his favour. (2) That under both the Civil and Indian Laws the period of prescription has lapsed in this case. The first objection is out of the question because Lawyer Agob Effendi attended the hearing in accordance with another power of attorney which was unobjectionable. The lady who made this power of attorney in favour of her Agent did not raise any objection, and at the same time no objection to this was raised in the Court of First Instance. Appellee from her mother guardian; and that he21 As regards the second objection, it appears that the administra tion of this land by the Appellor was based on the sale agreement dated 21st Mnharram, 1327. After examination and taking into consideration the date on which the Indian Law of Limitation 9 was repealed, it appears that the ' period of prescription ' did not elapse. The sanad produced falsifies the allegation made by the Appellor in respect of his tasarruf ' which he demanded to prove by evidence, because the Appellor was allowed possession of this land from the date of the sanad. As regards the civil ' period of prescription ', it is considered that, although a period of time has passed on the ' tasarruf ' of the Defendant (Appellor) before the case has been raised, this ' 'period of prescription ' is of no value as lonp as the Appellor has clearly admitted the ownership by the Appellee of the land under dispute. This admission is made in a sale document which states that he (the Appellor) purchased the plot of land under dispute from the guardian of the Appellee. As such sales are not recognised, and as the judgment of the Court prohibiting the Appellor from opposing the Appellee in administer ing the shares under dispute is correct, the judgment appealed is hereby confirmed and the Appellor is ordered to pay the court fees together with 9 dinars, wages of the lawyer for one sitting, plus I.D. 11/250, wages for drafting the statement in reply. This decision is issued unanimously under Articles 196 and 198 of the Code of Civil Procedure and Article 24 of its Supplement, and -declared to both parties in open Court this 9th day of May, 1932.

Subjects (1) The Sheikh of Kuwait and the Bashiya Garden land suit. (2) The possession of the Fadaghiyah garden by the Sheikh of Kuwait. 1. With reference to your letter dated 1st August, 1932, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Justice have both mentioned this matter to me and requested me to furnish all available informa tion. I am therefore in a position to supply you with fuller com ments than I would feel justified in doing if I acted only on the terms of Secretary of State letter dated 6th February, 1926. 2. The Prime Minister and the Minister of Justice realise that in your opinion the good name of the Law Courts is involved22 and at this stage of the political development of Iraq, the Govern ment are particularly desirous that there should not be imputations against the Law Courts and in particular against the Court of Cassation. 3. I must point out that I occupy the most peculiar position in this matter, for this report does not consist in my giving a note on the whole case only, but the honesty ot the personnel ot the Court ' of Cassation is directly challenged by the Sheikh of Kuwait and this aspect has been pressed by you upon me most torcibly, further you have put certain questions as regards the Sheikh s position in Law. I trust I may be able to give you full and accurate information on most of these matters, but I cannot say what future decisions ought to lie given by the courts because 1 shall D.\ . most certainly be required to sit. 4. The letter from Col. Dickson dated 25th June. 1932, shows that the Sheikh of Kuwait owns five gardens or rather groups of gardens. The two gardens under reference in this matter are the Bashiya and the Fadaghiya gardens, these two gardens, with a third garden called A1 Kharam, form the group of gardens called Fadaghiyah vide para. (9) of the letter. The case already decided affects the garden Bashiya and is in respect of a claim to one-tenth of that garden being the share claimed by Rafia Bint Ali Pasha A1 Zuhair. I have received information tliat three of the sisters of Rafia have now filed similar cases in the Court of First Instance Basrah, cases Nos. 239, 214 and 253, and the Secretariat of the High Commissioner has been informed. The Sheikh of Kuwait alleged to Col. Dickson that a case is about to be filed in respect of the main Fadaghiyah garden, but as regards this no in formation has reached me. 5. There is a point distinguishing the facts as regards the possession of the Sheikh in the Bashiya garden and the facts re garding his possession of the Fadaghiyah garden vide page (3) of the statement of Abdul Aziz el Salim el Badar, agent for the Sheikh of Kuwait which is attached to Col. Dickson's letter. This distinc tion is that no Tapu Sanad was ever issued to the Sheikh of Kuwait in respect of the Bashiya garden, but it appears that a Taipu Sanad was issued to the Sheikh of Kuwait in respect of the main Fadag hiyah garden vide the letter dated 14th June, 1915, from Sir Henry Dobbs* and statement on page (7) of Col. Dickson's letter. This dis tinction must be borne in mind when I deal with the Sheikh's possession as regards the Fadaghiyah garden. 6. I have no knowledge of the conditions under which the other four groups of gardens were bought by the Sheikh of Kuwait nor how the third garden A1 Kharam of the Fadaghiyah group was acquired. 7. Without wishing to minimise the importance of the Sheikh's allegations, the actual case decided affects one-tenth of the small garden of 31 jerib and the Sheikh's main fear is as regards the large garden of A1 Fadaghiyah containing 400 jeribs. 8. As to the history of the proceedings up to the date of filing the action in the Basrah Court of First Instance in respect of the Bashiya garden, I see no reason not to accept the statement of Abdul Aziz el Salim el Badar set out on pages 1 and 2 of the trans lation of his note, and I agree with the statement on page 2 of the letter from the Political Resident in, the Persian Gulf dated 11th July, 1932, that there is no doubt that it was a bona fide transac tion and that the purchase price was paid. 9. I will now summarise the case and the findings. This will enable you to follow the complicated series of facts set out in this report. * Document No. 7, p. 31.23 A. sues B. for a declaration of ownership in a piece of Miri land and for an injunction against B. A. proves ownership of her ancestor. B. sets up sale dated 1327, i.e. 13th March, 1909, by ancestor of A. to ancestor of B. by means of ordinary unregistered sale deed. Held this Sanad cannot pass ownership; (а) It has not the consent of the Mamur Tapu necessary in 1327 under section 36 Land Law for Miri Land Sales. {b) The Transfer is not registered in Tapu and is there fore void vide section 1. Transfer of Possession of Immov able Property Act, 1329, and numerous decisions since Irada Saniyat, 1318. B. then sets up Limitation. (1) Under Indian Limitation Act 12 years period under article 144 and he claims possession for more than 12 years prior to Repeal of that Act by Basrah Laws Repeal Act 1920. (2) Under article 20 Land Code, 10 years is sufficient. Held by court. Under the Indian Limitation Act the period runs from date of Sanad 13.2.1909 (21st Muharran 1327) to 30.9.1920 Basrah Law Repeal Act i.e. 11 years 7J months. Further the court refused to hear witnesses that B. had possessed the land prior to date of sale because the Sanad of Sale on which he himself relies state that the seller was in possession up to date of sale. Therefore Limita tion has not run under the Indian Limitation Act. Held secondly that although article 20 Land Code gives 10 years as period of prescription yet the principle of section 1674 of the Majelleh has to be followed namely that no prescription runs if a party admits that his root of title is derived from the ancestor of the other party; in such case he cannot set up adverse possession but must establish a root of title such as a legal transfer. 10. The history of the proceedings in the Bashiya garden case has not in my opinion been accurately or sufficiently set out, I will therefore try to set out the salient facts. A great deal of stress has been laid by you and by Col. Dickson on the judgment being given by Iraqi and not British judges and I have therefore made several references to this aspect of the case. 11. I have had copies made of the following documents and they have been sent to your office for translation and forwarding to you :— (1) Judgment Court of First Instance dated 15.7.31. (2) Judgment Court of Cassation dated 11.11.31. (3) Judgment Court of First Instance dated 30.12.31. (4) Judgment Court of Cassation dated 9.5.32. (5) The petition filed by Rafia bint Ali Pasha A1 Zuhair dated 5.3.30. (б) The defence filed by the defendant dated 26.10.30. (7) A further defence dated 28.1.31. (8) A reply by the plaintiff dated 3.2.31. (9) A rejoinder by the defendant dated 12.2.31. (10) A statement by advocate for defendant dated 24.2.31. (11) Translation of a letter from Dafterkhana Constan tinople to Wakil Dafterkhana Basrah, produced to court on 4.5.31 (probably 4.7.31).24 (12) Translation copy of a letter from Ministry of Tapi&gt; to Ministry of Finance signed by the Prime Minister pro duced on 4.5.31. (probably 4.7.31). (13) A letter from Mr. Dobbs dated 14th June, 1915.* (14) An additional petition by the plaintiff dated 9.7.31. 12. In civil case No. 77 of 1930 of the Basrah Court of First Instance, Rafia bint Ali Pasha A1 Zuhair, sued Sheikh Ahmad Jabir A1 Sabah (Sheikh of Kuwait). She claimed that she was the owner of one share out of ten of a certain garden in Fadaghiyah. This we know is the Bashiya garden. She alleged that detendant took possession and prevented her from obtaining her share, she set out her title which was based on Sanad Khakani, that this was Miri land and any sale on such Miri land must have a special authority from Mamur of Tapu vide section 36 of Land Law. She claimed an order to prevent interference with her enjoyment. Note : That the nearest approach to this kind of relief in England Law is for an injunction to restrain etc. The defence dated 26.10.1930 briefly denied that the Sheikh of Kuwait took the land by force and laid certain preliminary objections which were not important. On 28.1.1931 the main grounds of defence was filed. The defendant first queried the amount of the shares shewn to be in ownership of plaintiff. No point turns on this now and it was not raised in the Court of Appeal. It merely concerns whether the plaintiff inherited one tenth or inherited 17 out of 216 shares. The third ground sets out the case for the defendant namely that his grandfather Sheikh Mubarak A1 Sabah bought the shares belonging to Shafiqa Khanim and her children Hassan, Bahija, Najiya, Rafia (the plaintiff in the case) and Kamila children of Ali Pasha A1 Zuhair for 3033 lira and 30 kurush on behalf of herself as principal and as guardian (wasi) on behalf of the children, as proved by Sanad of sale dated 21st Muharram 1327. The defendant then referred to a condition of sale that if the business of Tafweedh i.e. transfer in Tapu were delayed, that delay would not form any ground to cancel the sale, he then stated that there was a delay in registering due to political matters because the Ottoman Government considered that the Sheikh of Kuwait had bought these lands for the benefit of the British Government (sic) vide letter No. 504 dated 14.6.1915 from Abdul Aziz Effendi el Salim el Badar, agent of defendant and for this reason the Government of Turkey sent a code telegram to Dafterk- hana of Tapu Basra not to register. Note:—I have set out this ground at a length because it contains what is the real reason for the delay in registration. On 3.2.1931, plaintiff replied to this defence, the important points being the following :— (а) So far as the minor children were concerned, no per mission was given by the Qadhi. Note;—I mention this because the formalities of the sale by the ' Wasi ' are given as one of the grounds in the judgment of Court of First Instance Basrah dated 30.12.1931, but this point was not pressed in the Court of Appeal, which decided the case on other points. (б) Proved that this is Miri land and the sale of Miri land without the permission of Mamur of Tapu was not allowed in 1327 under Article 36 of the Land Law. (c) That a sale outside Tapu must be registered under section 1 Law of Transfer of Possessions of Immovable Pro perty Act. The defendant made a rejoinder to this dated 12.2.31 which adds nothing to the matter but on 24.2.31 he filed a petition giving the reasons why the sale was not registered in Tapu. He said —r — — * Document No. 7.that this was not done because the Turkish Government wanted a declaration that the Sheikh of Kuwait was a Turkish subject where as he is independent under the protection of Britain. On the 4th of May 1931 (probably an error for 4.7.1931) defendant put in letter fom Dafterkhana Istana to Dafterkhana Basra ordering him to do the registration on the lines of the communication from the Prime Minister. He also filed a translation of letter from Prime Minister Mahmud Shawkat Pasha to Ministry of Finance Istana ordering it to carry through the business of Sheik of Muham- mera and that of the Qaimmaqam of Kuwait if they admit that they were Turkish subjects and agree to have this endorsed in the Sanads. During the hearing on 9.7.31 the plaintiff filed an argument in writing which recapitulates the points on which he relies. 13. I have set out at length the points made by plaintiff and defendant because at the rehearing no additional pleadings were filed and the case proceeded on these original proceedings and on the arguments recorded in the ' dhabt ' i.e. record of the case. You will notice that there does not appear to be raised the matter of limitation on which you have laid so much stress but in fact in the second hearing this point was expressly raised and re corded in the ' dhabt and formed the main grounds of appeal taken in the second appeal. 14. At this stage I will set out the dates of the different decisions. They are : 14.4.31 claim dismissed by Mr. Hooper for lack of prosecution. This is a very ordinary step in a case and I see no reason to comment on the remarks of the defendant's agent to the effect that at that date i.e. before judgment, Mr. Hooper was convinced of the justice of defendant's case and for that reason plaintiff withdrew her power of attorney from her advocate and allowed the case to be dismissed for default. If Mr. Hooper really was unwise enough to shew his intentions before giving final judgment, it is quite understandable why the plaintiff dropped the case but 1 really have no grounds on which to say that this was the reason why the plaintiff dropped the case. There may be a dozen reasons. On 6.5.31 the plaintiff applied to continue the case by opposi tion to the judgment of dismissal. The case was heard on the 7th of July 1931 by the \ ice-president and the judgment was given on 15.7.1931, in favour of the defendant i.e. of the Sheikh of Kuwait dimissing the case on the ground that an action must firstly be filed to cancel the deed of sale of the 21st Muharram before any action could be filed based on ownership claiming mana' mu'aradha. So far as the allegation of the Sheikh of Kuwait against the bona fides of the Iraqi judges is concerned, I cannot see that he can complain of this judgment in his favour but I now draw your attention to fact that although Mr. Hooper was known to be leaving Basrah no application was made to me as President Court of Cassation by Mohammed Effendi Wasfi, the Sheik's ad vocate, to transfer the case to another court. If the Sheikh's agent had then any reason to suspect an intrigue either with lawyers or with Government officials I find it difficult not to suppose that lie would have gone to the British Consul and information brought to me or after I went on leave to Mr. Drower who acted for me. 15. I attach copy of judgment of the Civil Court of First Instance Basrah which I paraphrase as follows: '' The defendant relies on a contract of sale which purports to transfer ownership to him. The plaintiff relies on inheritance through the person who made the Sanad of sale. Therefore the plaintiff cannot claim ownership until he has cancelled the sale, she must therefore first file an action to cancel the Sanad. If that succeeds, she may then claim in respect of the share of the estate which she has inherited26 as the owner and may then file an action claiming (Mana' mua'radha) i.e. prevent the defendant from interfering with her property For the benefit of any lawyer who may be consulted 1 should explain that this is what the Turks call a judgment on a preliminary ground. Such judgments caused much scandalous delay and section 20 of the amended Civil Procedure Regulation was framed to curtail these judgments on preliminary points, but, unfortunately it left it to the discretion of the court and this case is an instance of the trouble which results when a judge does not give judgment on the merits as well as on preliminary objections. 16. Against this judgment an appeal was filed before the Court of Appeal C.A.148 of 1931. The plaintiff appellant: {a) challc/nged the correctness of the order of dismissal, (h) referred to section 36 of the Land Law and the judgment of the Court of Cassation of Constantinople dated 13.1.1331 with reference to the sale made outside Tapu by the Sanad of 21st Muharram 1327 relied on by defendant re spondent. (c) Urged that the sale of the minor' property without leave of the Qadhi is valid. The advocate for defendant respondent maintained that the decision was correct and he also claimed that in view of the long possession of this land the Law of limitation applies. I was pre sent at the hearing of this appeal. A fairly complete note was prepared for me and \ concurred with the judges. In this judgment the court held that the decision to reject the claim on the single ground that the plaintiff must first file an action to cancel the deed of sale is wrong, in particular as it will appear clear that this deed is null and void as a transfer of property being made outside Tapu vide sec. 1 Immovable Property Act and without permission of the Mamur as required under section 36 of the Land Law and as this transaction was not one merely voidable but is actually null and void, no separate action to cancel it is required before the court can treat it as being non-existent. The case was therefore remitted for re-hearing on its merits. As this decision was given by lurkish trained judges and is framed in language which pre- supposes that the decision is a technical document for lawyers, the following observations will assist you in realizing what is the theory of Turkish Law regarding unregistered sale of Miri land in areas where the Tapu offices function. In Turkey there is a difference between transfer of mulk (firagh) and transfer of miri (tafweedh). In Miri lands there is always an ultimate ownership in Govt, which may be resumed and section 36 of the Land Law preserved the right of Government to interfere with the free disposal of such Miri land by insistin (T that the permission of Ma'mur concerned i.e. the Tapu Ma'mur should be obtained. Further such transfer is legally effected in the Tapu Office only, therefore, unless and until, a transaction affect ing Miri land was registered in Tapu and the consent obtained, usually by endorsement of the Mamur Tapu, that transaction was null and void in the year 1327 and in the eyes of the Law did not exist to pass property. The consent of the Mamur Tapu does not appear to be necessary any longer since 1329 but that does not concern the efforts to register this sale. 17. Before going on with the proceedings I will say a word as to why the Tapu Mamur refused to give his consent. The Law of the Ottomans is not in favour of immovable property being held by foreigners. Even in the case of Mulk land e.g. houses and small gardens it is only allowed on condition that the foreigner submitted to the laws and courts of the country and as regards Miri land it was forbidden. The Turkish attitude in this matter throughout27 has been that no sale to foreigners will be allowed and the Govern ment Mamur was forbidden to allow this transfer. Under the orders of the Turkish Prime Minister, however, they stretched a point as regards the known attitude of the Sheikhs of Muhammara and 9 Kuwait towards the Turkish State and offered to allow them to register their sales if they admitted that they were Turkish subjects. 18. The Court of Appeal disposed of the first appeal on the 9th of November 1931 and papers went back to Basrah and on the 14th of December the Iraqi Vice-President fixed the 23rd of December for the re-hearing. Since the procsedings in this part of the case have been attacked because no British judge sat, I must point out that Mr. Lloyd was President of the Basrah Court and was in Basrah from 1st of December. All British judges know that they should sit if possible in foreigners cases and I cannot believe that any application was made to Mr. Lloyd to sit in this case and must therefore presume that the advocate Muhammed Wasfi Effendi and Abdul Aziz Effendi A1 Salim A1 Badar took no steps to draw the attention of the British President to the case. I have read the ' dhabt ' and it is quite clear that the following points were raised in argument by the Sheikh of Kuwait's advocate. (a) That in this case limitation ought to run under section 144 schedule 1 the Indian Limitation Act and that the period has elapsed. (b) If the Indian Limitation Act does not apply, limita tion runs under the Law of the country and also has elapsed. On 30th December 1931 judgment was given in favour of the plaintiff on the following grounds :— (a) That the sale as shewn by the deed of 21st Muharram 1327 was null and void under section 1 Possession of Land Law. (b) Section 1674 of the Majelle lays down that in view of the admission of the right of the plaintiff's ancestor no prescription can be pleaded. Note :—This is the important decision as to limitation and •will be discussed later on. (c) That at any event a sale by one ' Wasi ' will be invalid. 19. On this judgment appeal is made to the Court of Appeal; 2nd appeal No. 66/932. Iskender Mansour Effendi appeared for the Sheikh as appellant. It is alleged that I was deliberately kept in ignorance of this case. Iskender Mansour is an advocate who often comes to Baghdad on appellate work and is quite well aware that he may at any time have access to the President if he wishes to apply to him. He made no effort to secure my presence in the case. The case was heard on the 9th May. There were 5 cases in the list including one concerning a foreigner on which I sat. The partiea in the appeal by the Sheikh of Kuwait were described : Appellant: A1 Sheikh Ahmad A1 Sabah, Advocate Tskender Effendi Mansour. Respondent: Rafia bint Ali Zuhair, her advocate Kamal Effendi A1 Sinawi. I note that you apprehend that this omission to inform me that it was a foreigner's case was intentional. In view of the extremely sharp nature of your conjectures I have asked the Minister to hold special enquiry vide my letter to the Minister dated 16.8.32 copy attached. I will only observe that the grounds of appeal filed by Iskender Mansour do not state that the Appellant was the Sheikh of Kuwait nor does the copy of the judgment of the First Instance filed with those grounds state that but the Sheikh is described by the title of His Highness and the advocate's Power of Attorney state that he was the Ruler of Kuwait.28 20. The judgment of the Court of Cassation sets out the grounds of appeal fully. They are as follows :— (a) Limitation in this case should be in accordance with para. 144 Schedule 1 of Indian Limitation Act, that the period under this is 12 years, and that 12 years of actual possession had passed before Basrah Law Repeal Act of 1920 took effect and appellant claims to prove this by proving possession before the sale deed was made. {h) If Limitation under the Indian Limitation Act is not good then the Appellant has been in possession for the necessary period under the Law of the country and section 20 of the Land Code applies which gives prescription of 10 years. {c) Appellant has enjoyed this possession by virtue of a legal sale not in opposition to the wishes of the seller. Although the sale by the one ' Wasi ' yet it was with per mission of the Qadhi and if the court cancels sale I ask for the recovery'of the price. The plaintiff respondent took the points already discussed in the Law Court and in particular laid emphasis on section 1674 of the Majelle claiming that once an admission of the right of plaintiff's ancestor had been made a defence of limitation cannot succeed and he also relied on section 1 of the Transfer of Immovable Property Law. As to Limitation under the Indian Limitation Act the period runs from date of Sanad 13-2-1909 to 30th Sept. 1920 i.e. eleven, years seven months and a half. The defendant appellant submitted a further statement of grounds of appeal of which the important points are :— {a) The possession exceeded 12 years under the Indian Limitation Act. {h) That the Qadhi had given valid permission. {c) That no permission of Mamur Tapu was required. The judgment of the Court of Cassation holds that;— {a) In as much as the Sanad of sale stated that possession of the seller continued up to the date of sale, the possession of the buyer for the purpose of Limitation runs from the date of the Sanad i.e. 21st Muharram 1327 and that 12 years has not expired under the Indian Limita tion Act before the Basrah Law Repeal Act. (ft) Under the Law of the country the admission of a right to titled entirely prevents a subsequent setting up of Limitation under section 1674 of the Majelle. (c) The sale deed is null and void. I have examined the points of limitation under the Majelle i.e. Law of the country, and there is ample authority from the remarks of Ali Haidar the Jurist that if a defendant admits that the origin of his possession has derived from the plaintiff or his ancestor the defendant cannot plead prescription but must prove some other means of acquisition e.g. sale. In this case he tried to prove such sale but as the sale was unregistered he cannot rely on this as a transfer of property; as long ago as 1318 all such transactions outside Tapu were forbidden regarding Mulk and Miri land by Iradah Saniyah. 21. I come now to answer your specific questions :— (a) As to limitation: I have set out the view taken by the Court of Cassation and I see no reason to suppose it is wrong except that the view that possession under the Indian Limitation Act only runs from the date of the Sanad is a point on which I am a little doubtful; There is, however. 9 *much to be said for the view followed by the Court of Cassa tion that the written admission in the Sanad of sale as to possession commencing with the date of the Sanad is con clusive against the purchaser even though the Sanad itself as a disposition of property is null and void. A reference to the Sanad shews that it contains ad mission that the land is under the possession of seller up to the date of the Sanad and will be possessed by the Sheikh of Kuwait. (b) As to copy of 'plaint and defence: I have already stated that in the re-hearing at Basra separate written plead ings were not filed but that the ' dhabt ' a court record shews clearlv that the point of limitation was argued. I have supplied copies of all the pleadings. (c) I have explained how I did not come to sit in this case. {d) See next paragraph. 22. Your question {d) presumably refers to the two gardens Bashiya and Fadaghiyah. I do not see what the Sheikh can do to contest the decision already given as regards the claims of Rafia to l/10th of the Bashiya garden, but if he wishes to apply for a review the grounds are well known vide section 27 of the Amended Civil Procedure Regulations. Clearly I cannot possibly advise to- his chance of success. As regards the Fadaglhiyah garden I remind you of the distinc tion between this garden and the Bashiya garden; namely, that it appears from the letter of Sir Henry Dobbs dated 14th of June 1915 that a Sanad Khakani has been issued to the Sheikh of Kuwait. If an action is filed as regards the Fadaghiyah garden the following points will certainly arise ;— {a) Is the Sanad Khakani a valid disposition in Tapu ? (6) If Valid so far as the Government is concerned was it made with the consent of the seller or her heirs ? {c) If there were minors with interests in the garden when does the period of prescription cease. I will here observe that Sir Henry Dobbs' letter shews that the entry in the register was made without the consent of the heirs of the sellers. Under Turkish Law it is possible to file suit to declare void a transaction in Tapu and the point will be taken that it is essential that in such transactions the seller or his agent must be present and admit the sale. As regards prescription for such suit I am unable to say how far prescription may run as the claimant appears to have been a minor at the time of the sale. If a minor the period of minority must be added to the period of prescription which I am informed is 15 years. In answer to your question I can therefore say that it is doubtful whether the Sheikh can successfully contest the claim, assuming the period of prescription is not completed. 23. As regards legislation, this depends on the general condi tions surrounding this case. In this matter the Iraq Government stands in the shoes of the Turkish Government. The same objection to foreigners holding Miri land prevails. The Turkish view con firmed by the courts was that this transaction is null and void but the Mamur of Tapu would, on behalf of the Government, allow registration, as the sellers agreed, on condition that the purchaser declare himself to be a Turkish subject. I do not see that any political consideration can possibly destroy the legal results of such failure to register. The Law as to limitation laid down under section 1674 of the Majelle is peculiar to English ideas but to me it seems logical.30 There have been many different decisions as regards necessity or non-necessity of registering land in different parts of Iraq but I am of the opinion that as far as the transactions in land at Basra is concerned section 36 of the Land Law certainly applied as to permission of Mamnr Tapu and since the Irada Saniyah of 1318 there have been many decisions insisting that sales must be regis tered or they have no validity. The first part of section 1 of Law to dispose of Immovable Property 1329 lays this down and applies in Iraq according to many decisions. The Unregistered Sales Con firmation Proclamation 1919 affirms this in its Preamble. 24. Generally I am of the opinion that, even if the omission to inform me of the case, was intentional, the grounds given by the Court of Cassation will be accepted by the Iraq Government as being valid grounds for determining this claim and unless there is some treaty obligation I do not think that the Iraq Government will admit any liability. The argument may be expressed as follows:— Minor children are not bound until they reach majority. They may take any legal steps to recover what they think is their patrimony. The sale by ancestor of plaintiff is null and void. If there is a legal flaw in the title of the purchaser from their father and mother they may recover the estate even though it has enormously increased in value unless they are time barred. They were not time barred at the date of the Basrah Law Repeal Act and under the Civil Law no pres cription can be good as the Sheikh admitted he held his titles from the ancestor of Plaintiff. I will put the matter in another way. The Sheikh of Kuwait has induced the British Government to guarantee his possession of lands to which he cannot (presumably) establish his legal title. I draw attention to the following :—■ It is in fact clear from the conditions of the deed that he was aware of the necessity of registration and aware that there were difficulties he endeavoured against the express provisions of the Law to ensure that the sale should not be considered null. 25. As to the promise by the British Government, the Iraq Government, so you inform me, don't admit this promise to be binding on the Iraq Government. If there is a dispute between the two Governments, presumably the matter will go to the Hague Court. If the Hague Court holds that this is an international obligation of Iraq, then, the Iraq Government may have to pass a law expropriating those persons who establish their claims in those gardens. If the Hague Court holds that there is no international obli gation on the Iraq Government it seems to me that this becomes a matter between the British Government and the Sheikh of Kuwait and it is for the British Government to decide whether the Sheikh should be compensated. 26. I notice that the Sheikh of Kuwait refuses to employ Mr. Mirza Mohammed. It will be extremely difficult for the High Commissioner to get legal opinion unless some advocate of standing is employed and I am of the opinion that it is advisable to obtain the advice of an experienced local advocate. It may be that the ruling on limitation under the Indian Limitation Act can be attacked and the ruling that article 20 of the Land Code is subject to the overriding provisions of article 1674 of the Majell.e may be challenged by the advocate. 27. The Political Resident of the Gulf asked about the claim to be independent of the Law Courts. All I can say is that the31 Sheikh of Kuwait can raise the point in the 3 cases filed at Basrah. When a foreign potentate possess land in another country it is easy to believe that the court will not admit that an action affecting immovable property can be excluded from their jurisdiction. 28. The Court gave no order regarding the point raised on appeal that a refund of the purchase price should be claimed. There is nothing to prevent the Sheikh claiming to recover this. No doubt the court did not decide this as it would mean an adjournment for payment of the court fees on the claim. 29. The court did not go into the point whether the second guardian should have joined in the sale. There may be a good deal of substance in the argument that when there are two ' Wasis ' both must join, failing which a disposition by one can be upset. 30. I cannot recommend any legislation except to alter the application of the Majelle, to possession of land under article 20 of the Land Code. 31. Finally do not let it be supposed that I am in favour of the present Civil Code known as the Majelle nor of the provisions of the Land Code. I have frequently pressed for the revision of both the Majelle and Land Code and you will find my comments in my annual reports especially for 1923, 1924, 1926 and 1931, copies of which should be in your office. (Sgd.) G. Alexander, A/G Judicial Adviser, 20th August, 1932. DOCUMENT 7. Copy Letter by Sir H. Dobbs, Revenue Commissioner, Basrah, U&gt; the Agent of the Sheikh of Koweit, dated 14th June, 1915. I promised you that I would send you a written reply to the application presented by you on the 16th May, 1915, for the registra tion in the Tapu Department of the sale to the Sheikh of Koweit of a certain Estate in Fadaghiya. The shares in the Estate were as follows :— (1) Estate Called Bashiya. Shares. Ahmad Pasha ez Zuhair 36 Abdul Bagi son of Ali Pasha ... ... ... 34 Shafiqa mother of Abdul Bagi 1 5 daughters V ••• ••• 1^6 1 son Hassan J (2) Estate Comprising 6 holdings and 3 river frontage holdings. Ayesha wife of Ahmad Pasha ez Zuheir, sole proprietors. In 1326 A.H. (1324 Ottoman Year) Ahmad Pasha acting on his own behalf in regard to the 36 shares in Bashiya and as agent of Abdul Bagi for his 34 shares and also agent for Ayesha for her whole estate, covenanted to sell the shares to the Sheikh ot Koweit as follows :— Shares. Piastres. Ahmad Pasha 36 ... ... ... 769-12^ Andul Bagi 34 ... ... ... i 1 706-62 Ayesha, whole estate ... ... ... £1 44217-33 At the same time Shafiqa on behalf of herself and 5 daughters and minor son covenanted to sell her 146 shares in Bashiya to the Sheikh for £T 3304-37 piastres. Ahmad Pasha was at that time starting for Constantinople and he received from the Sheikh of Koweit before starting a hawala on Bombay for £T 10,000 in part payment. He left a power of attorney with Abdul Wahab Pasha.Kartas, empowering him on behalf of himself and Abdul Hagi and Ayesha to complete the transaction of the sale by Tapn registration and thereon to receive the balance of the purchase money. 1 here after you, as agent for the Sheikh of Koweit and Abdul vVahab as agent for Ahmad Pasha and Abdul Bagi and Ayesha, went before the Mudir of the Tapu to register the sale. But the Mudir of Tapa in an order dated 9 Shabat 1324 refused to register the sale owing to orders received from Constantinople, that no more sales of land in the name of the Sheikh of Koweit were to be registered. After this you and Abdul Wahab went before the British Consul at Basrah and privately registered before him a deed of sale of the Estate—in so far as the holdings of Ahmad Pasha and Ayesha were concerned. Nothing was registered before the British Consul as regards the holdings of Abdul Bagi and Shafiqa and her daughters and minor son. Abdul Wahab received from you the balance of the purchase money viz. £T 38706 and handed the Estate over to the Sheikh of Koweit, in whose name it stands in the Muhasibi registers, though not in the Tapu registers. The Sheikh of Koweit has during the last few years been paying the Miri tax on the Estate to the Ottoman Government, which must be held to have by receipt of the tax, acquiesced in the transfer of the Estate to the Sheikh of Koweit. Now that Ottoman authority has been removed from Basrah and that the British Military authorities have reopened the Tapu Department the former difficulty about Tapu registration of the sale of the Estate has been removed, and you ask for formal registra tion. But in the meanwhile Ahmad Pasha ez Zuhair has (lied in Constantinople, but his death has of course cancelled the first power of attorney given to him by Ayesha and Abdul Bagi and the second power of attorney given by him to Abdul Wahab. Ayesha herself and the heirs of Ahmad Pasha are most of them in Constantinople, and they refused before the War to answer letters sent from Basrah asking them to appoint another agent for the completion of the sale before the Tapu Department. They have an agent in Basrah Armad ez Sani, but he holds authority only to arrange about the produce of their lands in Basrah and about the payment of taxes to Government and not for such matters as the registration of a deed of sale. The position is accordingly this. Under the Tapu Law the sale of land cannot be registered and finally validated unless the owner and the buyer appear before the Tapu Department in person or by authorised agent and testify to the fact of the sale and to the giving and receipt of the purchase money. The present owners of the shares of Ahmad Pasha and Ayesha cannot now them selves appear before the Tapu and have failed to appoint an authorised agent for the purpose. Nor is there any prospect of their intentions being discovered before the end of the War. But the Tapu Department has satisfied itself by an inspection of the papers signed before the British Consul at Basrah that there was a formal sale and delivery of the shares of Ahmad Pasha and Ayesha in the Estate and that the sale for those shares was paid; and in the peculiar circumstances this would justify the Tapu Department in granting a Tapu Sanad in respect of the sale of these shares. There remains the question of the shares of Abdul Bagi and Shafiqa and of her five daughters and minor son. If these persons are now prepared to appear before the Tapu in person or by authorised agent and testify to the sale of their shares, you should call upon them to do so. The whole transaction can then be com pleted and Tapu Sanads granted for the whole portion of land in question. Usual ending. (Sgd.) H. Dobbs, Revenue Commissioner, Basrah.

In our opinion if His Majesty's Government themselves, while in control of the Government of Iraq, had imposed the Istihlak Tax on the produce of the date gardens of either of the Sheikhs, it would have been a breach of the undertakings given in November, 1914. On this basis, we think that an obligation rests on His Majesty's Government to compensate the Sheikhs for the imposition of the tax by the present Government of Iraq. 2. Yes. 3. We think that the test is whether the then Sheikh of Koweit was, at the date of the undertaking, de facto in possession of the portions of the gardens affected by the judgment. We are of opinion that it is not material to consider either of the two alternatives. 4. We have nothing to add. (Sgd.) (Sgd.) Law Officers' Department, 29th March, 1933. T. W. H. INSKIP. F. B.

In the years ionediately preceding the War the status of the Sheikh of Koweit was of vital interest to His Majesty T s Government in connexion with the Bagdad rail way and it was therefore a matter of some concern to them when, 'between 1909 and 1911, the Turkish authorities in the Basra Vilayet placed difficulties in the way of the regis tration of property acquired in their jurisdiction by the Sheikh of Koweit unless His Excellency would consent to describe himself as a Turkish subject. An article was accordingly included in the Anglo-Turkish Convention,signed on July 29th,1915, to secure to the Sheikh the enjoyment of his private property in the Basra Vilayet, 2 C The manner in which the present difficulties arose is explained in the following extract from paragraph 4 of the case for. the Law Officers (dated March 29th,195&lt;5j. 'In 1914- His Majesty's Government were desirous of obtaining the assistance of the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah against Turkey, and letters were accordingly addressed to them by the Resident and Consul-General m the Persian Gulf, in which the nature of the assistance * desired was indicated and certain promises were made in return. In the letter to the Sheikh of Koweit dated ord November, 1914, the following passage occurs:- 'Furthermore I make to you, on behalf of the British Government, certain promises concerning Your Excellency personally, viz:- '(D/2. '(1) That your gardens v/hich are no iM in your possession vi'.:-• the date gardens situate between Fao and Qurnah shall regain iu your possession and in possession of your descendants without heing subject to the payment of taxes or imposts.' 'in the letter to the bheikh of Mohammerah dated 21st ii'oveinber; 1914 s it v/as stated:- 'lurther the d...te ■ . rdens which you now possess on the Turkish side of the 3hatt-el -Arab shall remain in full possession of you and your heirs and immune from taxation. 1 H 5. The date gardens referred to in both these letters are situated in territory which has now become part of Iraq and His Majesty's Government have always contended that the Iraqi Government should inherit these obligations: all attempts in tlxus direction have so far failed as the following paragraphs will ^how. 4. The original proposal to deal with the matter in the financial agreement arising out of .rticle 15 of the Anglo-iraq Treaty of 19^2 having bern ab^ndonedj the High Commissioner was informed in Novembers 192^ that it would be necessary to tre. t the matter separately under Article 10 of the 1922 Treaty. Unfortunately the final instructions sent to him made no reference to this point and the High Commissioner made no mention of the matter in his note to the Iraqi Government defining the latter's obligations under Article 10 of the 1922 Treaty. To repair this omission the Counsellor to the High Commissioner wrote to the Iraqi Prime iiinister explaining the omission on the grounds that the .latter was a minor obligation in respect of Iraq, contracted by His Majesty's Government/6. / 0 5, Government at the cor^ienceiient oi their campaign for Iraq's liberation and expressing the 'igh Corrjiiissioner's coniiciencc that the Iraqi Governinent v/ould recopnise this debt of honour. ■o reply was received to this letter. 5. The matter remained dormant until December, 1926 v/hen the Iraqi Government pointed out that the exemption of taxation hitherto accorded to the Sheikhs' date gardens was illegal under Article 92 of the Iraqi Con stitution, which provides that noone shall be exempted from taxation except in accordance with the law, and in ^ugust 1927 they reiterated this statement, maintaining that the exemption could not be continued except by special legislation and that it was highly improbable that such a law would pass the Iraqi Chamber. In these circumstances the High Commissioner was instructed to secure a specific assurtuce from the Irrqi Government that, as the uric: ertakings given to the oheikhs had been included amongst the international obligations mentioned in a memorandum submitted to the Iraqi Government in connexion with Article 5 of the 'stillborn' Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1927, they were now prepared to recognise them. Owing, however, in the first place to a misapprehension on the part of the High Commissioner and subsequently to the uncertain political situation in Iraq, these instructions were never carried out.8./ 6. On the strength of the Law Otxicers' opinion of 1950 that His ] ajesty's Government would, in the event of arbitration, have a rec.sonable prospect ol success, a despatch vas prepared instructing the High Corinissicner to suggest, should it prove impossible to induce the Iraqi Government to accept the obligations to the Sheikxis^ that the matter should be referred to arbitration. In the event this despatch was never issued, His Iiajesty s Government preferring to stand aside whilst the Iraqi Government entered into direct negotiations with the Sheikhs. At the same time it was agreed between Sir ?. Humphrys and Puri Pasha in an exchange of letters dated August 19th, 1930, that the obligations to the Sheikhs should be included in the list, to be communicated to the Iraqi Government, of international obligations devolving on Iraq under Article 8 of the 1930 Treaty of Alliance, with a foot-note to the effect that private negotiations were proceeding with a view to the liquidation of that particular obligation and that if these were unsuccessful the question would be discussed lurther between the two Governments. 7. at the end of 1931 it became apparent that the direct negotiations between the Sheikhs and the Iraqi Government had broken down and in 1932 the whole question was thrown into the melting pot by the Iraqi Government s introduction of the Istihlak tax and by the appearance of a number or private claimants bringing actions into the Iraqi courts to dispossess the Sheikh of Koweit oi certain of his properties.• • ■© 8. In 1935, owing to a technical flaw in the ohei::h of Koweit's title, an initial test case, relating to his title to the Bashiyeh garden, was successful. lis Majesty's Government took a serious view of this threat to the Sheikh's titles to his gardens and put forward in May, 1953, a proposal that if the Iraqi Government would undertake to secure the Sheikh of Koweit in the possession of his gardens. His Majesty's Government would favourably consider paying both the Sheikhs compensation in respect of their future losses under the new system ox ^axc-oion. v .hen King Feisal was approached by Sir F. Ilumphrys on these lines, he promised him in the presence of I uri Pcsno., tao Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, that he would see tnat the Sheikh was not dispossessed of property acquired by bona fide purchase: he afterwards, during his visit to England in the summer of 1933, reaffirmed this intenoion, and, after his death, the present King of Iraq gave his word to Sir F. Humphrys to honour his father's undertaking. 9. Action was however suspended on this proposal, and early in 1934 Sir F. Humphrys reported that there was little likelihood of the Iraqi Government implementing an arrange ment of this nature, and put icrward as likely to be accept able to the Iraqi Government an alternative course, in volving a contribution of not more than £2,000 by his Majesty's Government towards the cost or validating ohe Sheikh of Koweit's title to his gardens. Assuming that there was little likelihood of making real progress with the 1933 proposals s Sir F. Humphrys' suggestion appeared to provide the only alternative to arbitration. Although the/E. 941/82/93 of 1936. 6. the L lw Officers, in their opinion of January 23rd 1934, had advised i&lt;.v our ably as to His Ilajesty's Government's chances of success in that event, that opinion had to some extent been based on a false premise, in that His Majesty's Government had failed to implement their under takings to the Sheikh - at least as regards regularising the Sheikh of Koweit 1 s title - in the period when it had been open to them to do so. In these circumstances it was considered that arbitration involved a considerable element of risk., and in the event of an unfavourable verdict might expose His Majesty's Government to large and indefinite liabilities. Despite the grave objections to Sir P. Humphrys 1 proposal, it was therefore decided to authorise him in the event of the 1933 solution definitely proving unobtainable, to fall back on his alternative proposal. 10. His l.ajesty's Government's proposals were eventually communicated to the Acting Minister lor foreign Affairs in a letter dated January 28th, 1936 to the xollowing effect: On the understanding that the Iraqi Government would ensure that the Sheikh of Loweit was given a legally valid and unassailable title to his Faddaghiyah property (except that portion of the Bashiyah section already alienated from the Sheikh by a Court judgment /Tor which loss His I.ajesty's Government had resigned themselves to compensate the Sheikh/ 7 ), His lajesty's Government would contribute a sum not exceeding £2,000 towards the expenses which might be incurred in carrying out the necessary transactions. Provided that effect was given to these arrangements, and on the further/t- further understanding that the Iraqi Government_would (a) undertake to iricike no claim for arrears of taxation a.gainst the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah in respect 9! their properties in Iraq, (b) give the Ambassador a written surance that no discriminatory taxation would be imposed on the properties of either of these Sheikhs in future. His Malesty's Government would raise no further claim tor the exemption from taxation of the Sheikh s properties. 11, It had originally been intended to include in the proposals a requirement that the Iraqi Government should guarantee the Sheikh's title to all his gardens. ihe Sheikh had accordingly been asked to furnish a written list of his properties in Iraq covered by the 1914 guarantee, so as to leave no room for the Sheikh to claim subsequently that * properties not mentioned therein were 'exempted' properties. As the Iraqi Government could not however see their way to accept this condition and as the Sheikh's titles to his other properties appeared reasonably secure, the Ambassador was authorised merely to place it on record, when the Faddaghiyah dispute had been disposed of, that His Majesty s Government held that the Sheikh's other four properties were covered by the guarantee given to the Sheikh of Koweit in 1914, and that, as the obligations under this guarantee had passed to the Iraqi Government, His Majesty's Government would, in the event of the Sheikh being dispossessed, make a claim against the Iraqi Government in respect of such dispossession. — STr7 The Sheikh's list was as follows 1. Mutaawaih. 2. Faddaghiyah. 3. Farhaniyah. 4. Fao. 5. Uiairawiyahu In January 1935 (E.334/82/93) Sir F. Humphrys was in formed that the Sheikh's title to 1 appeared to be abso lutely secure, ond to 3 and 4 reasonably so. how' thai: the Sheikh' s Itle to 5 was also ecure).

In the summer of 19.'5 the Embassy reported trie t their sttention had been drawn to certain inadeouacies in the 19-34 ^ronosals which suggested that even if the Jraqi 'joveinment could be persuaded to acce nt the proposals^ the difficulties connected Vvith the Sheikh of I'oweit's titles to his gardens would not be disnosed of. They were requested to put the points, together with any alternative solution which they had to suggest, in an official despatch. L 92 1 of // 1935 15, In lvJcvember 1955 Sir A - Clark Kerr reported accordingly that neither Sir F. Humphrys nor he himself had 'been able to induce the Irani Government to take any action Oix the lines of the 1934 solution, and that there was litble hone of their making any real attempt to carry it out . Me pointed out that even if the Iraoi Government could be persuaded to issue to the Sheikh a proper T apu Sanad in respect of his Faddaghiyah gardens, the Sheikh would not thereby necessarily be safeguarded from claims (a) in connection with reclaimed land not yet registered i n £§121^ (b) of the f ellaheen who by planting the trees had acquired rights to certain portions of his land ('Taab rights') and (o) of other members of his family. 14. Sir A. Clark Kerr therefore proposed that the Sheikh of J oweit's title to his properties in Iraq should be examined de novo with a view to dealing with all questions of rights to these properties and that a Commission should, with the consent of the Sheikh of Koweit, be set up by the Iraqi Government (1) to enquire into the boundaries of all l^nd claimed by the Sheikh, (2) to examine all outside rights to the land, and to value such claims as might be proved to be legal rights under the law of Iraq, andr 9, and (5) to register in Tapu all lands, etc., of the Sheikhly family as a private Wakf to 'be administered 'by the ruling bheikh of Foweit and to forbid the Iraqi Courts to entertain actions 'by members of the Sheikhly family regarding their share in these lands.. He pointed out however that this proposal, although providing for a definite settlement, unfortunately presented certain difficulties. In the first place whilst the Iraqi Government might be willing to set up a Commission, if it could be done without special legislation, the Commission would probably only have adequate powers if set up 'by such legislation. Secondly, whilst it would be impossible to estimate until the Commission had completed its work how much compensation would have to be paid to outside claimants, neither the Iraqi Government nor His Majesty's Government would be likely to be willing to pledge them selves in advance to an indefinite financial liability. 15. The comments of the interested authorities on these new proposals are summarised below* E 898/18/95. (1) The Political Resident, after consulting with the former Political Agent, Colonel Dickson, was inclined to view favourably the proposal for a Commission, provided that an official who would look after the interests of the Sheikh and of His majesty's Government was included amongst its members. As regards the difficulties to which Sir A. Clark Kerr had called attention (see (a), (b) and (c) in paragraph 15 above), he suggested that the Sheikh could register the accretions provided the Iraqi Government put no difficulties in his way, and that the Taab claims and the disputes between the Sheikh and members of his family10. family were not covered by the 1914 pledge (i&lt;ir. Beckett takes a similar view ci these difficultie^ (2) The Government of India have no observations to ot'ler* (s) The India Office are in general agreement with Colonel Fowle's views (see (l) above). E 715^82/95 of 1^5. E 1751/18/95 B 2456/18/95 16= Sir A. Clark Ferr has been invited to observe on Colonel Eowle 's suggestion as to the composition of the Commission (see paragraphlS above), lie considers tnat if the Commission is to be given powers to pass decisions as to title and compensation with all the lorcc of un appealable judgments of the courts, the most that the Iraqi Government could be persuaded to agree ..o would the inclusion of one of the British oiiicial^ in uheir service. At the same time he anticipates that the difficulty of persuading the Iraqi Government and the Sheikh to agree to a Commission with such wide powers may prove insuperable and that it may prove necessary to fall back on a Commission ith more limited terms of reference, namely merely to enquire into the extent of the sneikh s claims and the nature of the counter-claims against him as a preliminary sten to a satisfactory settlement. He requests explicit instructions regarding (a) the composition of the suggested Commission and (b) its powers. At bhe E 2452 same time he feels that as it appears from Nuri Pasha's E 2185 recent conversation with er. Bateman that the Iraqi Government may not be averse from tackling the possession question in the near future, the possibility of disposing of this more urgent aspect of the matter should not be prejudiced by any delay which may be involved m working out11. (iii) ^ out a solution of the compensation aspect. Compensation for Taxati on Loss&lt;:• r; 0 17• As mentioned in paragraph 7 above the Iraqi G-overnment altered their system of taxation upon agricultural products in 1952, y/ith the result that taxa tion was levied not as hitherto on the land itself, but on suah parts of the crop as were sold or exported. Whilst it was evident that the Sheikhs would have to be compensated in some form for their losses under this new Istihlal, tax, io was decided that before a decision could be reached regarding the amount of compensation eventually to be paid, or regarding the basis on which it would be calculated, it would be necessary to have the opinion of uhe Law Oxiicers, wnether or not the Sheikhs T losses under the ney/ tax were covered by the 1914 pledges. In March, 1935, the Law Officers advised that an obligation resi-ed upon His Majesty's Government to compensate the Sheikhs for the imposition of the Istihlak tax, and the modality of that compensation was accordingly discussed, 18o As regards the Sheikh of Koweit the India Office suggested that the following alternatives were open to His Majesty's Government: (i) The payment annually of a sum sufficient from time to time to indemnify the Sheikh and his descendants in respect of any annual payment which they might have to make to Iraq; His Majesty's Government to remain liable for such payment so long as the descendants of Sheikh Mubarak hold the gardens covered by the 1914 pledge. (ii) A corresponding payment for the life-time of the present Sheikh only.12. (iii) The capitrlisation on the basis of the value of a perpetual exemption (? 25 years purchase or thereabouts) of the present aost of the exemption; and. the payment thence annually to the Sheikh and his successors of the proceeds of the capitalised sum. (iv) Payment to the Sheikh of an immediate lump sum representing the capitalized sum, referred to in (iii), the Sheikh thereafter becoming liable to such taxation as the Iraqi Government might impose on his property in common with other similar properties, and His Majesty's Government's obligation under the 1914 pledge being finally liquidated. The India Office felt strongly that having regard to the terms of the original undertaking the indemnity could not be confined to the losses suffered by the present Sheikh during his lifetime. The 'Treasury sav Parliamentary objections to the recurrent charge of public funds proposed in courses (i) and (ii). Course (iii) moreover shared the advantage of courses (i) and (ii) in that payment could be withheld in any particular year if the Sheikh's behaviour were unsatisfactory. 19. Before going further with this question it was decided to establish the extent of the taxation losses for which the two Sheikhs would, have to be compensated. The Embassy assessed the amount of compensation which might reasonably be given to the Sheikh of loweit for his Istihlak E 2123 and losses at £1,000 a year and that to be given to the Sheikh E 4967/274/ 93 of 1954 of Mohammerah at 50^ of that figure. It was however decided to go no further with the compensation aspect until the question of title had been disposed of, because (a) the final decision on compensation might depend on whether compensation1 ?. compensation vas to be paid to cover taxation exemption alone, or taxation exemption and the loss of the Bashiyeh garden, or taxation exemption and the lose of the Bashiyeh and other properties; ( d ) were His iiajesty's Government to disclose to the Iraqi G-overnment that they were willing to bear the cost of the Sheikhs' taxation losses, the Jraca Government might have little incentive to validate the Sheikh of Joweit's title to his gardens; moreover, the Iraqi G-overnment might prove reluctant to waive their claim to taxation arrears without the quid pro quo of His Hajesty's Government's proposed financial contri bution towards the settlement of the possession difficulty. 2C. This aspect of the question remained therefore in abeyance until Cir A. Clark Ferr put forward the proposals referred to in paragraph 12 above. The India Office, the Treasury and the Political Agent are now anxious that consideration of the compensation aspect shall not be deferred pending the setting up of the suggested Commission, should it be decided to appoint it, as it may be anticipated that some time will elanse before a settlement of the possession aspect on the lines now proposed can be reached. E 1046 The Treasury have pointed out that His Majesty's Government's liability under this head is increasing even'- year, and favour a 'lump sum* payment to the Sheikh of Voweit in return for a formal discharge binding on his successors as well as on himself, such a settlement to be conditional on the Iraai Government undertaking (a) to claim no arrears from either Sheikh in respect of the taxation exemption accorded under the system in force before 195?. r assessed at some £80,000] and (b) to give a written assurance that no discriminatory14, discriminatory tax would bo imposed on either Sheikh in future (as proposed in the 19?4- solution; see paragraph 10 above). 21o The claims of the She ikh of ..ohammerah under the 1914 undertaking are on a somewhat different basis to those of the Sheikh of Koveit. The Sheikhs of ^oweit remain independent rulers, but the Sheikh of x/iohammerah has relapsed into subjection to Persia and it is conceivable that he v.ill have no 'successor' in the special and semi- independent feudal circumstances which it might be claimed His Majesty's Government had in mind in entering into the engagement of 1914. The Foreign Office have taken the view that the Sheikh of iiohammerah should be treated during his life-time on the same basis as the Sheikh of Foweit 5 without prejudice to a possible decision on his death that he had no 'successors' and that His majesty's Government could therefore regard their obligation as exhausted. As regards the modality of the compensation it had been suggested that the payment should be made through the Legation at Tehran to prevent the money being seized by the Persian Government; this suggestion did not however commend itself to the Legation, who suggested that payment should be made through a bank. 22. Assuming that there is no reasonable prospect of inducing the Iraoi Government to agree to the 1954 proposals (see paragraph 10) four alternative solutions of the ' possession ' question would appear to remain for discussion: (a) The Ambassador's 1955 proposal for a Commission with full powers (see paragraph 14), (b) A Commission with limited terms of reference (see paragraph 16), (c)15. (c) Some modification of the 1954 proposals more likely to 'be acceptable to the Iraqi G-overnment. (d) Arbitration (c.f. paragraph 9). Further action as regards the ' compensation ' question vvill to some extent depend on i hich of the above courses is to be adopted in the 'possession' Question. It is ior discussion v.hether the 'compensation' 1 aspect can be pursued independently of the ''possession' aspect (c.f. ^aragraDh 19); v.hether a solution should be worked out previously, concurrently or subsequently to the 'possession' 1 settlement (c.f. paragraphs 16 and 20); and whether the settlement should be on the lines now proposed by the Treasury (see paragraph 20) or whether another of the alternative solutions proposed by the India Office in 1953 (see paragraph 13) should be pursued. &lt;33. It is possible that reference may be made during the discussion to a despatch recently sent to the Ambassador in connexion with the 'oosition of the Sheikh of Poweit in regard to civil suits in the Iraqi courts. Sir A. Clark Kerr has been instructed to explain to the Iraci G-overnment that the suits brought against the Sheikh in respect of his real property in Iraq would normally have come within the scope of the exception admitted by International Law to the general rule of immunity from process of foreign sovereigns, and that His iviajesty's Government would normally have been prepared to transmit the relevant documents for s -:rvice on the Sheikh, but that they nevertheless consider themselvesthemselves under no obligation to assist in the 6 ' service of these documents in the special circumstances of the case, since to do so v.ould be clearly inconsistent with the 1914 pledge. The Ambassador has however been instructed to take no action on this despatch pending the concurrence of Colonel Fowle.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00001e_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B468</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00001e</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B468</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>The Date Gardens in Iraq of the Sheikhs of Koweit [Kuwait] and Mohammerah.
