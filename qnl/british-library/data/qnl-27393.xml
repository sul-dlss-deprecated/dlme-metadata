J The balance of foreign trade during all the years under review shows a deficit, which in the pre-war years amounted on the average to 171 million rials, or 22% of the value of imports. While in 1323 this deficit amounted to 1921 million rials, of 70% of the total value of imports. In other words, the exports have made up only 30% of the imports in value. In 1324, however, there was a little change favourable to the country’s trade, as the balance of deficit amounted to 1409 mill ion rials, or 45% of total imports. In other words exports have amounted to a little over half of the imports. Thus the balance of foreign trade is still quite unfavourable for this country, and the deficit balance amounts to over £. 10,000,000 - a condition which cannot possib ly be allowed to continue without serious endeavours for its amelioration. Parti cularly when it is remembered that the balance of trade was favourable for this country during the years 1318, 1319 and 1320, when exports exceeded imports to a considerable extent. The conclusion which may be inferred from the table No. 2, that is to say the comparison of trade returns of goods only (leaving out the transactions in precious metals) of the year 1324 with the corresponding figures for the previous years, does not sensibly change the result obtained from the table No. 1 Because the figures returned for the year 1323 as regards transactions in precious metals, while comparatively large, amounted to somewhat less than 80% of the total foreign trade returns.898 No. 84 - October - November 1946 It may be seen from the following table that exports of oil products in the year 1324 have increased to an extraordinary extent, attaining to as much as 1 times their 1923 volume, or twice their average of the pre-war years, and rising in value by 43% above the 1923 level, or about four times as much as the average for the pre-war years. The average value of all oil products exported, taken together without classi fication into their several kinds, and as per the declarations submitted at the Ira nian Customs, for the years 1324, and 1323, and the average for the pre-war years, amounted respectively to 375, 388 and 191 rials per ton. That is to say in 1324 it was somewhat cheaper than in 1323 and the price twice as much as in the pre-war years.

The average value of the produce of the Fisheries, without classification into their several kinds, have also changed almost in the same ratio as the oil products. That is to say, the average value declared at the Customs for the years 1324 and 1325, and the average for the pre-war years, was 3,140 to 3,600 and 1,860 Rials respectively.No. 83 - August - September 1946 899 The duty-free imports in 1324 compared with 1323 rose in weight and value by 190,000 tons and 360 million Rials, or 57.5% and 90.3% respectively; while compared with the average for the pre-war years these imports increased by 323,000 tons and 502 million Rials or 164% and 196% respectively. Among the main imports figures of pre-war years piecegoods of pure cot ton held the first place, but during the war and afterwards sugar (grain and loaf) attained that position. There is a sensible difference between imports from the USSR and from other countries in the case of sugar andcotton piecegoods imported during recent years; since other countries sell their goods to the Iranian Government or Iranian merchants, and the cost figures returned by the Customs are cif rates for delivery at Iranian ports ,while the USSR import their goods directly (without passing them through the Iranian Customs) and sell them at Tehran and other towns at the free market rate. The figures returned by the Customs for the value of the lat ter goods are, therefore, at the rates prevalent in the free markets of this countiy, and thus the sugar (grain and loaf) and piecegoods imported from the USSR.

As to the volume of imports it may be seen that the quantity of cotton piecegoods imported into Iran during the year 1324 is less than the total imports of the pre-war period by 20%. Particularly imports from the USSR made up a half of all such piecegoods imported to Iran, while in 1324 they fell to only one-quarter of such imports. Imports of sugar, granulated and loaf, amounted in weight to 75% of the quantity imported in pre-war years, woollen cloth to 17%, tea to 54% and machinery to 13% only.902 No. 84 - October - November 1946 Table No. 5 MAIN EXPORTS.

In value too these exports rose to 4 1 / / 2 times their amount in the pre-war years. Exports of dry fruits, though more than double the amount of what they were in 1323, are still only 60% of their pre-war level. Exports of skins and rice have exceeded their average pre-war level. As to gum tragacanth the amount of exports have been 75% by volume and 300% by value, compared with the pre-war years. Lastly grain exports, though somewhat less than 70% of the pre-war amount by volume were a little more than that level by value. The following schedule shows in the order of importance the names of countries which have had important trade relations with Iran during the year 1324:No. 84 - October - November 1946 trade of Iran with the USSR should then amount to the sum of only 767 million rials, which is equivalent to that of imports from British India, and the USSR would then hold the third place instead of the second. The countries from which goods of any considerable amount have been imported, given in the order of importance are: the USSR, The U.S.A., Bri tish India, Great Britain and Ireland, Switzerland and South Africa. While those to which exports of considerable amount have been sent, also given in the order of importance, are: the U.S.A., British India, Syria, the USSR, Iraq and Great Britain with Ireland. Among the above - named countries the balance of trade with Iraq and Syria has been quite favourable to Iran, as the imports from Syria have been very insignificant compared with the exports sent there, while our exports to Iraq have been four times as much as the imports from that country. The balance of trade with Switzerland and South Africa has been, on the contrary, unfavourable to Iran; since we have only one million rials of exports to South Africa against 128 million rials of imports, and only 5 million rials of exports to Switzerland against 196 million rials of imports from there. It must not be forgotten, however, that the main item of imports from South Africa consists of the 109 million rials woith of gold bars; but the chief item of imports from Switzerland is 120 million rials of artificial silk cloth. During the year 1323 the countries having trading relations with Iran stood in the following order as regards the importance and magnitude of their total transactions: British India, the USSR., the U.S.A., Switzerland, Iraq and Great Britain with Ireland. The following is a list of countries which have had considerable trade relation with Iran in the pre-war years, given in the order of their import ance: Percentage In total trade It should be remembered that, during the years 1317, 1318 and 1319 42%, 39% and 46% respectively of the total trade of the country was carried on with Germany which held the first place among the countries which had trade reations W!th Iran. While during the years 1313, 1314, 1315 and 1316, on the contrary, 34%, 29 , 36% and 34% respectively of the total trade of this country was with the U.S. S.l at th in h£ di: ba be pr to in eiNo. 84 - October - November 1946 905 S.R. which held the first place. In the last two years (1322 to 1323) no country has attained this ratio in Iran’s total trade. From all the various tables given in this article it can be deduced that the general condition of Iran’s foreign trade during 1324 has been on the w T hole improved in result of cessation of the war. Particularly as regards exports which have increased considerably in comparison with the year 1323. The main difficulty which we have, however, is the question of our deficit in the balance of trade, which the Government, and more particularly the merchants, are bound to try and ameliorate. As regards imports, also careful endeavours should be made to import productive commodities which may help to increase the public wealth. For, it is to be noted with regret, the imports of machinery, which constitute the most important means of productive industry conducive to wealth, are still only one eighth of the amount they had attained during the pre-war years.906 No. 84 - October - November 1946 Economic Report for the Month of Mehr f32»&gt; 1 — Commercial Information. The stagnation which was brought about in the market from the second week of Shahrivar subsequent to the Decree of the Council of Ministers concer ning the authorization of the sale of foreign exchange for the purpose of opening documentary credits, continued during the month of Mehr, and no transaction of importance took place. Some business was, however, done within actual limits of need for consumption in certain essential commodities such as, piece-goods, tea, loaf sugar, spices and grocery-goods. Imported goods were mostly slack, and in some cases there was even a fall as in indigo, metalware, glass-ware and porcelain. Because the tea and sugar rations for Mehr were not distributed, and due to the scarcity of these commodities in the market, the price went up. Consequently the price of sugar, on 20th. of Mehr was Rls. 65. 50 per kilo, but the sale of Government sugar at Rls. 51. 50 per kilo stopped a further increase in the price of this commodity. Market for export goods was as brisk as in the preceding month. There was a demand, for export purposes, for rugs to Europe, and gum tragacanth, guts and skins to America. Of the dried-fruits class, almond was the only item in demand for exportation to Iraq. Contrary to the preceding month the market for food-stuffs was stagnant, and prices of most of the items tended to fall. There was a fall of 20^ in Champa (rice) 15- /o in Sadri (rice) and 10% in Ghee. Below is given a list comparing prices of some important items at the end of Shahrivar 1318 with the maximum prices during the recent years.908 No. 84 - October - November 1946 Importation of second-hand clothing prohibited In accordance with the Decree of the Council of Ministers No. 19390 dated 18. 6. 25, importation of second-hand clothing has been prohibited as from the above date. In the new import quota subsequently notified by the Council of Ministers and indicated hereunder, however, provision has been made for the importation of second-hand clothing under Appenix No. 3. New import cguota for 1325 The Council of Ministers at their session of 25 Shahrivar notified the new import quota and set down the regulations governing the goods imported during 1325. In accordance with these regulations, therefore, goods imported in the year 1325 are divided into 4 categories: Importation of goods of the first category (listed under App. 1 ) is completely prohibited. Importation of goods of the second category (listed under App. 2) becomes a Government monopoly. Goods listed under appendix 3 can be freely imported by merchants within the limitations of the import quota. In cases, however, where the orders placed by the merchants exceed the quota limitation, or when (with the confirmation of the F. E. Commission) the decrease in the country’s foreign exchange holdings necessitates, the Ministry of Commerce and Industries will notify that orders for the said goods must have prior approval of the Ministry. The clearance of such goods, from the Customs, can be allowed only with import permits issued by the said Ministry Importation of goods of the fourth category (goods not listed under any of the 3 appendices) is altogether free (Decree No. 23402 dated 28. 6. 25) Fire in Meshed Sugar Factory A big fire broke out in an important section of the Meshed sugar factory during the night on the 2nd. Mehr and caused considerable damage. A telegraphic message despatched by the correspondent of the Ettelaat Paper says that the people at Meshed, particularly beet-root farmers, are great ly worried by this unfortunate accident about the seventy thousand tons ofNo. 84 - October - November 1946 909 sugar-beet which they have provided for the Factory. Consequently a sudden rise occured in the price of sugar which rose to 100 rials per kilo. Grain - crop in the current year. Information received by the paper “Ettelaat” reveal that the crop in the grain producing areas, which generally supply the shortage of other poorer re gions, is quite satisfactory. The stock at the Tehran silo is 44,000 tons of wheats and 11,000 tons of barley. This is sufficient to provide for Tehran consumption against 9 months and is the largest stock ever held at the silo. There is another 42,000 tons of wheat and 15,000 tons of barley in the granaries of other provinces. Although the cold regions provide the greater part of the country’s supply of grain, and the crop in those areas has not yet been gathered in, still more than 70 thousand tons out of the total quantity undertaken to be supplied by farmers has so far been delivered to the authorities. This figure, however, will undoubtedly in crease to 150,000 tons by the end of Aban. Sujsur sold free marltct price. The revision, by the IVIinistry of Finance, of distiibution of the rations foi the month of Mehr, presented an opportunity to the hoarders to raise the price of these commodities in the market. In order to stabilise the price of sugar until such time as new coupons are distributed and the people receive their rations, the Council of Minister, at their session of 20th. Mehr, authorized the said Ministry to sell up to 1,000 tons of sugar at free market-price (Decree No. 26862 dated 22.7.25). Importation of unrefined sugar permitted. The Council of Ministers, at their session of 24th. Mehr, authorized the Ministry of Finance to permit, by notification, interested persons to import unrefined sugar under conditions set down by that Ministry. Such importers may, when necessary, be exempted from paying the commercial pi of it of the Government.910 No. 84 - October - November 1946 Exchange market. During the month of Mehr the market was somewhat dull for transaction in free foreign exchange holdings, particularly the Pound Sterling Dollars for the purpose of placing orders for automobiles, and Swiss Francs were, however, in demand. Following are variations in foreign exchange rates during the month of Mehr: Dollar Bills of Exchange 48.50 to 51.00 Rials Dollar holdings 48.25 &gt; 50.50 » Pound Sterling drafts 149.— &gt; 160.— » Pound Sterling holdings 131.— &gt; 138.— » Swiss Franc certificates obtained against exports 12.50 &gt; 13.— &gt; Rupee drafts 10.65 » 10.90 Dollar notes (green) 47.— » 49.50 » One Pound Banknotes 134.50 &gt; 137.00 Dinar Notes 137.— &gt; 141.— &gt; Chervonetz 4.75 &gt; 5.— &gt; Foreign exchange regulations. As per letter, dated 6.7.25, of the Foreign Exchange Commission the merchants can discharge their obligations in respect of goods exported to the coun tries of the sterling area in any foreign exchange they like. But exporters who are paid by the authorized Banks against shipping and other documents should use the foreign exchange thus acquired only in the settle ment of contracts against the above documents. Situation in money and precious metals. During the month of Mehr no increase was made in the amount of Bank notes in circulation (viz. 7, 700 million rials). Rate of interest in the market was higher than in the preceding month i. e. under first class signatures 12% to 18%, under second class signatures up to 30% and against real estate guarantees (price of which has risen in comparison to the preceding month) 18% to 24%.No. 84 - October - November 1946 911 Selling price of Pahlevi gold coins in Bank Mell Iran was, as in the preced ing month, Rls, 600. - and its free market price between 588 and 594 rials. Gold Pounds were between Rls. 716 and 732; but their market, during the whole month, was generally calm. 2- Financial and Economic Information Tax on rentable property. The Council of Ministers, at their session of 27 Shahrivar, cancelled the second section of the Single Article Decree No. 142 dated 8.1.25 (published in Bulletin No. 82) concerning tax on rentable properties, and authorized that, as from the ebeginning of 1325, the income derived from rentable properties should not be added to the other income of the taxpayer, but should rather be taxed on the basis of 10% of the total annual income as passed by Parliament in Somboleh (Shahrivar) 1294 (Decree No. 23738 of 31.6.25). Conference Held by the Representatives of the Landlords and the Prime Minister’s Speech The first conference of the Provincial Land Owners Representatives was held in the Foreign Ministry at 6 p. m. on 7th. Mehr. His Highness the Prime Minister, a number of Cabinet Ministers and other personalities were present. H. H. the Prime Minister delivered the following speech: “Following the inauguration of The Merchants’ Economic Conference it gives me the greatest pleasure to open officially the Land-owners Confeience today undei the auspices of His Imperial Majesty the Shahenshah. For the first time representatives of the land-owners in every district and province of Iran have been sent to this Conference in order to have a close and direct contact with the Government, acquaint themselves with the social problems of great magnitude with which the country is now faced, and to assist the Govern ment in finding the proper solution of these problems. My chief concern is the problem of building up a solid basis on which the future of Iran can be erected. For mere show of patriotism and verbal demonstrations of good-will are not enough to serve as a foundation for the independence of an ancient and glorious nation such as ours. The survival of na tions depends upon the efficiency of the individuals, and their confidence in ob taining the prime necessities of life through their efforts.9t2 No. 84 - October - November 1946 In the Merchants’ Economic Conference I said that the country’s economic indepndence is the pivot on which the Government’s economic policy revolves. I would like to declare, now, that this independence rests upon the fundamental basis of the Government’s agricultural policy which in itself is based upon two vital issues, viz; the safeguarding of the principles of private ownership, which constitu tes one of the aims, of the Democrat Party of Iran, and the improvement of the living conditions of the huge masses of farmers and labourers. Today, you gentlemen have come together to cooperate with me in the so lution of this vital problem, and work for the achievement of our national aspira tions, as reflected by the policy of my Government and based on the improvement of our natural resources. The Government will, by means of working programme which is now being planned, encourage and support the initiative enterprises of the land-owning class, and expects that they will, on their part, follow the Government’s plans, accept its leader-ship, and utilize the working power of the Iranian peasantry in developing the potential productivity of the land and improving the living conditions of the peasants themselves. Problems pertaining to the development of agriculture including increase of agricultural products and water-supply of the country will be placed by the Ministry of Agriculture before this Conference in which mutually acceptable plans agreed by you will be decided upon. In order to do this, technical Commis sions have to be appointed to study the aforementioned problems and find the best way of tackling them. The problem of finding ways and means for the use of technical facilities in excavation of “kanats”, or subterranean waterways is of prime importance, which a special committee of experts will have to study carefully. Necessary equipment for the digging of wells and for the use of electrical motor power in water works, as well as the possibilities of making artesian wells are among other matters to be taken up. A revolution is needed in our methods of agriculture, by introduction and use of machinery. Plans for a more extensive irrigation system, including construc tion of dams must be drawn. The Ministry of Agriculture will, moreover, despatch special technical commissions to the provinces where they will, with the coopera-No. 84 - October - November 1946 913 tion of the landlords, draw up necessary and practical programmes for the deve lopment of agriculture in their respectiveareas. The Agricultural Bank is responsible to earmark an important portion of its capital for the purchase of drilling and agricultural equipment to be distributed throughout the country. It will also facilitate the country’s irrigation problems by means of digging water wells on contract basis. This work coupled with mechanical and technical devices can be accom plished cheaply without any loss of time. Special classes have to be formed to train mechanics and technical experts to operate agricultural machinery. The present system of giving loans, by the Agricultural Bank, to the farmers does not greatly effect the country’s prosperity. On the other hand the Ministry of Labour, in conjunction with the Ministry of Agriculture, should, by means of resolutions passed by the Conference, do away with all the burdens and responsibilities placed upon the shoulder of the farmer by the land-lord. The above-mentioned Ministries will also bring to the notice of the Confer ence all the differences created by water-rights for the settlement of which the Conference will have to pass special resolution. The problem of pastures both in cold and warm regions of the country, belonging either to the tribes or to the land-lords, will be brought to the Con ference by the Ministry of Finance. Resolutions stabilising ownership of these pastures and their proper maintenance will in due course be passed by the Conference which will also cancel pasturage collected heretofoi e by the land-lord. Now that the cultivation of poppy-seeds has been prohibited, the Ministries of Finance and Agriculture will jointly propose the development and cultivation of other substitutes. You may rest assured that your practical views will receive immediate considerations. The ruinous danger of opium must be enadicated from the country once and for all. The problem of breeding cattle and sheep will be brought to the atten tion of the Conference with a view to obtaining practical and useful opinion. I expect that special attention be shown towards this important national resource. The Ministries of Agriculture and Finance in conjunction with the Agri cultural Bank will prepare trustworthy statistics of the present cultivated areas and also prepare a list of the various agricultural crops in order to enable the914 No. 84 - October - November 1946 Government in developing and increasing the kind of products mostly needed by the nation. I assure the gentlemen that any other practical suggestions initiated by the Conference will receive my special consideration, and that I shall support your well intentioned plans for the development of agriculture. The foundations of my vast social reforms are based upon the welfare of the masses, the improvement of their living-standard, and the development of the pro ductivity of the land. Iran requests to increase her capital in the International Monetary Fund. The Government of Iran has requested that her capital be increased in the Internationl Monetary Fund. This request has been forwarded to the Managing Directors for the preparation of the necessary report. Regulations governing the National Savings Bank Following the formation of the National Savings Bank, authorized under the Law of 18 Ordibehesht 1318, the Council of Ministers at their session of 8th. Mehr sanctioned that: firstly, the National Savings Bank should only keep its funds in the Bank Melli Iran, and secondly, the regulations covering the National Sav ings Bank are hereby abolished. The Bank Melli Iran which, legally, manages and guarantees the affairs of the said Fund will draw up the necessary regulations and, after the approval of the Bank’s Supreme Council, put them into action. Agrlcuharal Exhibition. On the proposal of the Ministry of Agriculture the Council of Ministers, at their session of 10th. Mehr, authorized that, in order to acquaint the farmers with new agricultural methods and render possible the exchange of ideas between them, an agricultural exhibition be established. The exhibition will be opened once every year and will be under the supreme supervision of the Minister of Agriculture. All farmers and owners of agri cultural organisation can participate in the exhibition, and the Government will provide the necessary facilities for the participants. The expenses of the exhibition and entrance fee for the visitors shallf be fixed by the Board of Directors, and the revenues of the exhibition shall be spent in accordance with a separate budget to enlargen and improve the said exhibition (Decree No. 25410 of 14.7.25)No. 84 - October - November 1946 915 Settlement of differences concerning the Income Tnx. With a view to expedite the collection of the income tax, the Council of Ministers, at their session of 13 Mehr, gave further authorities to the Finance Offices. They are consequently empowered to settle their differences with the tax payer concerning the tax on 1325 and the preceding year, without taking into account the previous notices issued, and with due consideration to their past record and on the basis of the present situation of their books. The settlement, after the approval by the income tax assessment Committee, must be considered final, and in cases where no settlement can be reached between the Finance authorities and the tax payer, the differences by mutual agreement, or else it must base its judgement upon both the past xecoid of the tax payer and the situation of his income as reflected in his books. The assessed tax, in such cases, is final for any amount where mutual agreement has been reached and up to rials 10,000 in the latter way. In the second instance, the Commission for the revision of such differences, members of which are separate from the other Commission, will reach a settle ment in the manner described hereabove. Their decision up to rials 500,000 shall be final. As a last resort the matter shall be referred to the Finance Tribunal for in vestigation. When the tax payer refers the matter to the said Court, he must place before them a sum equal to the difference. Tax payers who are covered by this Decree should pay 10 percent of the amount charged against them, either by mutual consent or by verdict of the commissions, as a fine for late payment of their taxes. (Decree No. 26190 of 16.7.25) Twenty-five dinar coins Subject to the proposal of the Bank Melli Iran and the approval of the Min istry of Finance, the Council of Ministers in their meeting of 15 Mehr authorized that twenty five dinar (cent) coins of 19mm. diameter to the extent of ten mill ion rials, be minted at the Imperial Mint (Decree No. 26196 of 17.7.25) Amendment to the Statutes of the Industrial and Mining Bank The Council of Ministers at thier session of 20th. Mehr 1325 amended the constitution of the Industrial and Mineral Bank (Refer to Bulletin No. 81 page 584) as follows: The Board of Directors will be formed by the Director of the Bank and three members, one of which shall be the permanent chairman of the Board4* 9 ^ No. 84 - October - November 194G elected at the General Meeting of the shareholders for a period of four years.

It was provided in Clause 1 of the Statute that: “The Trade Council shall be formed in order that economic data should be collected there, and problems which affect the economic life of the Country be discussed and studied accor ding to a clear-cut programme by members known for their expert knowledge and wide experience of the economic policy of the Realm. The Prime Minister is ex officio President of the Trade Council.” The Trade Council was composed of the Prime Minister, the Mi nister of Finance, the President of the Board of Agriculture, the President of the Board of Industry, the President of the Board of Trade, the Con troller General of Private Companies, the Governor of Bank Melli Iran, the Manager of the Agricultural Bank and three competent private individuals elected for one year by the Council of Ministers • The Trade Council held its first meeting on 2nd. Ordibehesht 1316 (May 1937) and subsequently held eight consecutive meetings under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister. Its tenth meeting was held on 1st. Tir 1316 (July 1937) in Saad Abad Palace in the presence of His Late Majesty, Reza Shah. A report was submitted to His Majesty, in which it was mentioned that the Council considered it its prime duty to prepare a general economic plan for the Country. His Late Majesty ob served that whilst this was the case the Council had diverted its delibe ration from the main duties assigned to it. The Trade Council then decided to concentrate all its efforts upon the preparation of a long-term economic plan for Iran, and at its meeting of 6th. Mehr 1316 (October 1937) approved the fromation of a perm a-No. 83 - August - September 1946 791 nent Committee charged with the preparation of a plan for increasing the productive capacity of the Country. The Committee met 20 times and submitted proposals for the ^.development of agriculture and labour movements. It also prepared a number of plans among which may be mentioned the Seven Years Agri cultural plan. It was adjourned sine die after its meeting on 11th. Mehr 1317 (October 1938) and had no further activities. The Trade Council, which was evidently waiting for the Committee’s proposals, had held no further sessions in the meanwhile. The outbreak of the World War and the subsequent events of Shah- rivar 1320 (September 1941), put a stop to all these activities, as the authori ties were engaged for some time in the day - to-day affairs of the Country. As the current economic problems of the Country necessitated Government interference, need was felt for consultations by the Govern ment with the economic experts on vital problems In Mordad 1323 (August 1944) the Council of Ministers decided to form a Supreme Economic Council. The Statute of the former Trade Council was approved with some slight alterations for the new Supreme Economic Council. This Council held a few meetings but was brought to a standstill owing to the resignation of the Council of Ministers. In Esfand 1324 (March 1945), Mr. Ebtehaj, Governor of Bank Melli Iran, who had acted in 1316 (1937) as Secretary - General of the Supreme Economic Council, wrote the following letter to the Minister of Finance: Your Excellency, I have been studying for a long time with great con cern the economic and social problems of Iran and various projects put forward for economic developments and social reforms, the utilization of Iran’s holdings in gold and foreign currency, the prevention of flight or wastage of capital and the balancing of the general budget of this Country. Some time ago, I submitted my views to the Coun-792 No. 83 - August - September 1946 cil of Ministers to the effect that, in order to ensure the fulfil ment of such social and economic aims, we must have a definite plan. A report was also forwarded on 14 Shahrivar (September) to His Excellency the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance.\ Owing to the urgency and importance of the subject and in order that Bank Melli Iran may render effective assis tance in carrying out the above mentioned objects, I have caused a Committee to be formed at the Bank to study the subject carefully, and to prepare a workable draft plan. This draft will only deal with the general aspects of the plan submit ted. The details must, however, be worked out under the super vision of experts and with a very careful and extensive study by various Ministries and Departments, so that the estimate of expenditures and revenues may be worked out as accurately as possible. The conclusions reached by them will determine the order of priority of each particular project. When the total expenditures and the additional reve nues, which will be forthcoming once the projects have been carried out, are calculated, it will be possible, if the authorities approve, and our holdings in gold and foreign currencies are found to be inadequate, to obtain long - term loans from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development which will shortly be formed to provide such facilities, or from similar institutions. The loan will subsequently be repaid from the revenue which will gradually come to hand when the plan is actually put into operation. In the light of the foregoing remarks, I propose that a Committee be formed at the Ministry of Finance to take ac tive steps to prepare the general economic plan. I shall be glad to put at Your Excellency’s disposal all the data collected at this Bank together with the results of the studies undertaken on these subjects, and shall instruct those members of the Bank staffNo. 83 - August - September 1946 793 who have carried out this task to cooperate fully with the Com mittee which will be formed at the Ministry of Finance. This Bank will also be glad to offer any futher assist ance required. A. H. Ebtehaj, Governor. The Committee was subsequently formed in the Ministry of Finan ce on 12th. Farvardin 1325 (April 1946), and submitted its proposals to the Council of Ministers. Ihe Council therefore passed the following decree at its Session of 17th. Farvardin 1325. DFCREE OF THE COINCIL OF MINISTERS DATED 17 FARVARDIN 1325 (April 1946) In accordance with the proposal No.5/897 dated 12th.

Khordad 1325, at the Bank Melli Iran Building. ^ His Excellency Mr. Abul-Hassan Ebtchaj, Governor of the Bank Melli Iran, opened the meeting with the following statement: Ladies and Gentlemen, Allow me first of all to thank you on my own part and on behalf of the Natio nal Savings Bank’s management for your kindness in coming here today to parti cipate in the procedure of drawing lots for the prizes offered by the National Savings Banks. As you are no doubt aware, Bank Melli Iran in its efforts to give useful service opened, as early as 1307 a Bank of “Savings Accounts”, for its customers. The balance of which amounted at the end of the year 1317 to Rls. 10,459,000/-. The National Savings Bank was then established in 1318 by virtue of a legis lative act, and the number of saving accounts in all Iran with the total amount deposited in them since that year until the end of 1324 has been as follows: Year Number of accounts Amounts 1318 22,307 Rls. 22,433,000 1319 55,153 » 37,862,000 1320 54,647 » 30,933,000 1321 65,405 » 53,594,000 1322 97,416 » 144,747,000 1323 144,781 » 296,646,000 1324 207,623 » 454,891,000 A comparison of the above figures will clearly show that the number &lt; Savings accounts and the balances of deposits have increased in a remarkably satis factory manner. The Bank Melli Iran has always been endeavouring to earn the satisfaction of its customers and in this instance it has not withheld its assistance, and in spite of numerous difficulties the Bank has increased the number of its town sub-branches and its agencies in various parts of the country, thus providing considerable facilities for savings depositors. Apart from raising the rate of interest, it has also with the view to encouraging the habit of saving, increased the amount of prizes. Thus the total value of prizes which amounted to only one million Rials in 1323 rose toIRAN’S DEVELOPMENT PLAN Supplement to Bank Melli Iran Bulletin No. 82 November 1946IRAN’S DEVELOPMENT PLAN Supplement to Bank Melli Iran Bulletin No. S2 November 1946IRAN’S DEVELOPMENT PLAN The first Trade Council was formed in Iran in Farvardin 1316 (April 1937) on the proposal of the Board of Trade and the sanction of the Council of Ministers which approved its Statute.

Ordibehesht 1316 (May 1937) and subsequently held eight consecutive meetings under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister. Its tenth meeting was held on 1st. Tir 1316 (July 1937) in Saad Abad Palace in the presence of His Late Majesty, Reza Shah. A report was submitted to His Majesty, in which it was mentioned that the Council considered it its prime duty to prepare a general economic plan for the Country. His Late Majesty ob served that whilst this was the case the Council had diverted its delibe ration from the main duties assigned to it. The Trade Council then decided to concentrate all its efforts upon the preparation of a long-term economic plan for Iran, and at its meeting of 6th. Mehr 1316 (October 1937) approved the fromation of a perma-- 2 - nent Committee charged with the preparation of a plan for increasing the productive capacity of the Country. The Committee met 20 times and submitted proposals for the development of agriculture and labour movements. It also prepared number of plans among which may be mentioned the Seven Years Agri cultural plan. It was adjourned sine die after its meeting on 11th. Mehr 1317 (October 1938) and had no further activities. The Trade Council, which was evidently waiting for the Committee s proposals, had held no further sessions in the meanwhile. The outbreak of the World War and the subsequent events of Shah- rivar 1320 (September 1941), put a stop to all these activities, as the authori ties were engaged for some time in the day - to-day affairs of the Country. As the current economic problems of the Country necessitated Government interference, need was felt for consultations by the Govern ment with the economic experts on vital problems In Mordad 1323 (August 1944) the Council of Ministers decided to form a Supreme Economic Council. The Statute of the former Trade Council was approved with some slight alterations for the new Supreme Economic Council. This Council held a few meetings but was brought to a standstill owing to the resignation of the Council of Ministers. In Esfand 1324 (March 1945), Mr. Ebtehaj, Governor of Bank Melli Iran, who had acted in 1316 (1937) as Secretary - General of the Supreme Economic Council, wrote the following letter to the Minister of Finance: Your Excellency, I have been studying for a long time with great con cern the economic and social problems of Iran and various projects put forward for economic developments and social reforms, the utilization of Iran’s holdings in gold and foreign currency, the prevention of flight or wastage of capital and the balancing of the general budget of this Country. Some time ago, I submitted my views to the Coun-cil of Ministers to the effect that, in order to ensure the fulfil ment of such social and economic aims, we must have a definite plan. A report was also forwarded on 14 Shahrivar (September) to His Excellency the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance. Owing to the urgency and importance of the subject and in order that Bank Melli Iran may render effective assis tance in carrying out the above mentioned objects, I have caused a Committee to be formed at the Bank to study the subject carefully, and to prepare a workable draft plan. This draft will only deal with the general aspects of the plan submit ted. The details must, however, be worked out under the super vision of experts and with a very careful and extensive study by various Ministries and Departments, so that the estimate of expenditures and revenues may be worked out as accurately as possible. The conclusions reached by them will determine the order of priority of each particular project. When the total expenditures and the additional reve nues, which will be forthcoming once the projects have been carried out, are calculated, it will be possible, if the authorities approve, and our holdings in gold and foreign currencies are found to be inadequate, to obtain long - term loans from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development which will shortly be formed to provide such facilities, or from similar institutions. The loan will subsequently be repaid from the revenue which will gradually come to hand when the plan is actually put into operation. In the light of the foregoing remarks, I propose that a Committee be formed at the Ministry of Finance to take ac tive steps to prepare the general economic plan. I shall be glad to put at Your F^xcellency’s disposal all the data collected at this Bank together with the results of the studies undertaken on these subjects, and shall instruct those members of the Bank staff-4- who have carried out this task to cooperate fully with the Com mittee which will be formed at the Ministry of Finance. This Bank will also be glad to offer anf futher assist ance required. ^ A. FI. Ebtehaj, Governor. The Committee was subsequently formed in the Ministry of Finan ce on 12th. Farvardin 1325 (April 1946), and submitted its proposals to the Council of Ministers. Ihe Council therefore passed the following decree at its Session of 17th. Farvardin 1325. DECREE OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS DATED 17 FARVARDIN 1325 (April 1946) In accordance with the proposal No.5/897 dated 12th. Farvardin 1325, of the Ministry of Finance, the Council of Ministers approved at its Session of 17th. Farvardin the following: 1 - For the purposes of planning and drafting of a long-term plan of reforms which should be carried out in the Ministries and in the organizations founded for the welfare of the country, a commission, which will be henceforth called “ The Commission for Drafting plans for the Development of the Country”, and whose members will be selected by the Minister of Finance, shall be held under the presidentship of that Minister. 2 - For the purposes of administration, the aforementioned Com mission will be under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Finance. The Ministry of Finance shall be bound to provide necessary funds for the expenses of the Commission in accordance with the regulations which will be drafted by the Commission and submitted to the Minister of Finance for approval. 3 - All the Ministries, independent Government Organizations,— 5 — the Com- the Banks and Companies are bound to put at the disposal of the Com- ice. mission, at the earliest possible time, every kind of carefully prepared infor- ther assist- mation and data required, and, if necessary, to form a special department r ibtehaj, ^.for dealing with matters arising out of such enquiries. 4 - The Commission can send special representatives to the Minis- rnor. tries or their dependent Departments for the completion of such data. 5 - The Commission, having made a thorough and complete y of Finan- roposals to following survey of the plans of reforms which are considered necessary for the development of the country, shall submit for approval the result of their survey and their recommendations through the Ministry of Finance to the Council of Ministers. .

The ids for the dons which Minister of ganizations,IRAN’S SEVEN YEAR FEAN Report submitted to H.H. the Prime Minister by the Commission for Preparation of the Development Plan for Iran. Your Highness, In carrying out the provisions of the Decree of the Council of Ministers No. 129/938 dated 20th. Farvardin, 1325 (April 1946), and embued with your Highness’ special concern for the execution of those provisions, the Commission has the honour of submitting herewith the Seven Year Plan for Iran’s Reconstruction and Development. The Commission also asks permission to put briefly before your Highness certain preliminary observations and points relevant to those plans as a whole 1- Need for the enforcement of the plans The progress of civilization, the development of various indus tries and the improvements which have been made in transport, have brought the international and national economic alfairs closer together, have succeeded more and more to dissolve private enterprises into nation wide units and have tended to weave various nations into a closer in ternational pattern. It has perforce extended the interference of Govern ments and national bodies in the complicated social and economic acti vities of nations and have made it necessary that a harmony should exist between different national enterprises and between them and the international world as a whole. These inter-relations have brought home to all the nations of the world the necessity for the preparation of long-term plans for economic and financial developments and have stirred the authorities to put them into execution. The need for the preparation of such a long-range plan has beenfelt in Iran for some years, and its urgency has been prompted by well- informed individuals. It is to be regretted that no effective consideration was shown for so many years by the responsible authorities, and that 4&gt;e luke-warm efforts have been given no continuity to bear any tangi- ole results. The result has been that such projects have been neglected and were given to oblivion by the passage of time. It is now very gratifying indeed to notice that Your Highness’ attention has been directed in no uncertain manner to these vital prob lems. It is hoped by all the well-wishers of Iran and those who have her prosperity as their aim, that the long-felt desire will now approach the period of fulfilment in spite of all the difficulties which are existing at present and which may hamper the achievement of such a great object. 2. The difficulties which have hampered the Commission As it was mentioned in our report of 5th. Khordad (June), various difficulties have been experienced by the Commission from the outset, of which the most important are referred to below: a) Lack of trustworthv data and correct basis of statistics in the Ministries and Independent Departments, without which no accurate and co-ordinated plans for reform and development could be conceived. b) Unstable loyalty of the Government employees, loosening of discipline, and lack of individual responsibility. These defects have been the result of insufficient pay in pro portion to the cost of living, constant changes in the organizations, and the insecurity which have been felt by the Government officials with respect to their posts. The above motives have paralysed Government Administrations, have slowed down efficiency and have laid the Civil Service open to public resentment. No long-term plan can therefore be conceived and put into force unless a definite attempt is made towards a fundamental reorganization of the Government Services.- 8 - 3. The general nature of the Plan As the Commission was charged to prepare drafts of a general plan for reforms and developments, the plans embarce all types of government activities and deal with matters relating to the reorganization or strengthening of the present organization with special attention to the following matters: a) Economic and development activities in so far as they affect the direct production of wealth or incomes, such as the projects for irrigation, cattle farming, development of forests, foundation of factories, extension of telegraph and telephone lines, railways, postal transport etc. b) Social activities which produce no direct income but will enhance public welfare and tend to raise the standard of living, edu cation and public health, and will result in an all round increase in the working capacity of the individuals and the productive power of the country as a whole, and which, in turn, will increase the national in come. Among such activities can be mentioned the steps which should be taken for the strengthening and reforming of the judicature and the army, the cleaning and lighting of towns etc. c) Lack of experience on the part of Government employees in the preparation of long-term plans and the non-existence of records in the Ministries on such subjects. d) Shortage of time at the disposal of the Commission and the impossibility of collecting accurate information and extensive studies in such a short time. Other countries, for which all data were available, have generally spent a much longer time in the preparation of their long-term plans. e) The uncertainty with respect to the general policy and the limitations which the Commission had to observe in the preparation of each particular .plan. Notwithstanding all the above difficulties, efforts were made by the members of the Commission and some of the directors of variousif a general 11 types of organization attention to they affect projects for of factories, ansport etc. e but will iving, edu- •ease in the &gt;wer of the lational in- ich should ire and the mployees in ; of records ion and the ^ studies in e available, )n of their icy and the paration of *e made by of various Institutions and Administrations, and it was possible to prepare, in less than three months time, a comparatively complete plan for 11 Minis tries, 5 Administrations, 3 Banks and two Government Institutions. ^ The Commission considered its duty to help and guide the Ministries and Administrations in the preparation of their special plans in order that the general plan of the country could be pre pared with due regard to each particular plan. The Commission has not therefore made any effort to distinguish between the essen tial and non-essential parts of each project, or in reducing or increasing the items of expenditure. This was found impossible because of the shortage of time for a technical and expert study of the figures pro posed. A general and brief study has nevertheless been made in each particular case before its inclusion in the general plan. The defects which naturally exist in these plans are mentioned below. The plans submitted to the Commission can not, as it has been pointed out at the beginning, claim a sound and correct basis, nor has it been possible, with the very short time which the Commission had at its disposal, to familiarize the Government functionaries with the nature of the work and to obtain information from the Provinces. It cannot be expected that the plans are without any defects whatso ever. It nevertheless can be claimed that the Government organizations have been made conscious, for the first time, of the necessity for long term programmes of reform, and a foundation, however incomplete, has been laid down for such a task in future. We beg to submit the following proposal for the removal of the defects which are evidenced in the plan: A new Commission should be held consisting of the members of the present Commission together with a few other experts, charged by Your Highness to compare and co-ordinate the total figures of expenditures given in the plans with the financial capacity of the country, and to propose ways and means for removing the deficit. If such method be consi--10- dered as undesirable bv the Government, the Commission should then be entrusted with the task of differentiating between the projects of pri mary and secondary importance and to propose a new definite plan with due consideration of the financial capacity of the Government and tf^ nation, and the possibility of obtaining credits elsewhere. It is evident from the foregoing that the expenditure involved in the projects directly effective in the increase of the national wealth should be met by extraordinary revenues, so that its burden be not solely laid upon the shoulders of the present generation. Other projects which are connected with social reforms and the completion of the present organi zation should be preferably financed by the funds collected inside the country. If the Government decides to carry out the schemes submitted, the following points should be especially borne in mind:- 1) - Combat against corruption of the Government employees and the reorganization of the present Ministries: As the greater part of the plan must in any case be carried out by the Government employees, it is impossible to form a fixed and responsible organization to deal with such matters with honesty and ef ficiency unless they feel secure with respect to their subsistence and their posts. It is impossible to expect such efficiency and loyalty from the present functionaries who, on account of poverty and insecurity, are in fested with pessimism and a wavering spirit. A draft has been included in the programme of the Ministry of Finance with respect to the revisions of the present Civil Service Law which claims urgency and should be put into force prior to any other reforms. Steps should also be taken with all possible means to embue Go\ ernment employees with the sense of loyalty and to bring home to them the responsibilities which they have in connection with their duties. The reorganization of the Ministries with a view to forming a new organization appropriate to the duties entrusted to each Ministry, isalso of utmost importance. If this is carried out it will be a safeguard against the constant changes which now occur in the departments, probably through personal motives. It will also enable the Government to dismiss ^hose employees whose services are considered as superfluous and unnecessary. 2) - The revision of the present administrative and financial regu lations, which are not in harmony with the extensive activities projected, is also of utmost importance. Many Ministries realize that vague and inappropriate provisions and regulations have hampered many an urgent and technical enterprise and if they continue to remain in force, it will result in delay and inefficiency in future. These anomalies have been pointed out by several Ministries, and the Ministry of Finance has laid stress in its plan on their removal. 3) - The maintenance of the judicial security of all individuals, the prevention of the flight of capital and an all-round increase in the general output should be considered as the fundamental conditions of success of any far-reaching project. 4) - As a number of projects proposed, such as irrigation works, lighting, etc. should be financed by individual investments under the gui dance of the Government, it is necessary that the Commission, entrusted with the preparation of the definite plan, be instructed to keep this fun damental principle in view, and to differentiate between such projects and those which are to be carried out by the Government. The Commission wishes to point out in conclusion that in spite of undue pessimism evidenced in certain circles which are always against any far-reaching and fundamental reform, the idea of preparing a long term plan is one of the important policies of Your Highness’ Government, and its execution will render a lasting and most valuable service to this country whose people have for a long time been kept waiting for such funda mental reforms to materialize.DECREE OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS Approved in their session of 19th.

Farvardin (April), in the presence of Ills Highness the Prime Minister, i he meeting was attended by all members. 1 he Prime Minister delivered the following address: Gentlemen; Since my Government accepted the responsibility of holding office, I have been paying special attention to the question of the well-being of the Iranian people through the increase of their material wealth, and the amelioration of the economic and social conditions of the country. Not withstanding the difficulties experienced in our foreign policy and the gloomy situation evidenced in Iran, prior to our taking office, for the remo val of which 1 had to spend most of my time. I issued urgent instructions to the Ministries and various Government Administrations for a close and careful study of the ways and means to increase the productive capacity of the country, to encourage exports and to raise the standard of living of the labourers and peasants and for the protection of home industries. As you are no doubt aware, in spite of various obstacles which had ham pered progress, effective measures have nevertheless been taken for the execution of the Labour Law, enforcement of regulations concerning the relations between the employee and the employer, the annulment of certain restrictions affecting exports and the limitations put on the imports when similar goods are obtainable at home. As the adoption of fundamental measures for reconstruction and development necessitates the preparation of an all-round plan concerning every branch of Government and individual activity, and as without such plans the capital and efforts of both the Government and private individuals will be spent in vain, I have therefore designated a Council to render effective help and guidance to the Ministries and independent Departments in preparing long-term plan for their respective organi zations. It is gratifying to note that in spite of the defects which are evidenced in various Government organizations, and notwithstanding the novelty of such a task in the environment accustomed to day-to-day mode of work, the draft plans for all the Ministries and independent Depart ments have been prepared, thanks to the commendable efforts of the members of the Committee and the effective support of a number of the direc tors of various Government Departments. I should like to express mv appreciation to all those who have been instrumental in the fulfilment of this our primary object. As the plans were prepared at short notice and with inadequate machinery and without apportioning the cost with the financial capacity of ihe Country to ensure exactitude, and could not be put into execution in their present form, it was therefore decided that a supreme Council should be formed of the members of the former Committee and other experts in various branches of economic and social activities, to consider the necessity and urgency of each separate plan with due attention to the capital involved in each project, and to prepare a definite plan of reconstruction and development for the Country. 1 have therefore invited you, Gentlemen, who all posses expert nowledge in the affairs of the country, to co-operate with me in render ing a service to your country, which may have far-reaching effects on e prosperity of Iran and on raising its prestige among other nations. p } ou will spare no time and effort for the preparation, at the short est possible time, of a general plan. ^ ^ ltls aIrea dy been provided in the Decree of the Council ° lln ! SterS ’ 0ne °f the most important duties of the Council is that of ascertaining the financial capacity of the country. It is no doubt well ' OI1 ^ le exec ution ol extentivc reconstruction and develop ment plans has been made possible in most countries by a great sacrifice m he people and by accepting various restrictions in the cause of general welfare. 'all (he termination of the devastating World War, every nation • , ^ or ' v ‘ lri ' w '^ 1 hope to a brighter and freer world and is slriving a e ’ ler o&gt; to iopair the ravages of war and to bring about funda mental reforms it is the duty of our countrymen to leave behind them all miseries and sufferings of the past and to measure long and confident A' ' 3 braVe heart and good cheer along the path of progress, so I ' llr , C ° m C y may regaln ils former glory and be established in the •rjiujsr * m these davs when the world is experiencing a severe economic~ 17- and social upheaval, pessimism and laziness would be analogous to death and dissolution. Responsible as I am for the orientation of the policy of Iran and mindful of the debt I owe to her, I consider it my bounden duty to light against such a pessimism, more especially because our history ^|hows that we have surpassed many a gloomy day and have surmounted many grave issues. Iranians have always found encouragement from among their own people and have torn many a dark cloud by sheer determination and resolve, thus adding yet another page to their glorious history. I he events of the last 20 years have clearly shown that the Ira nian people have borne more than their capacity, the burden of heavy taxation levied for the development and extension of industry: but, since the developments were carried out without a sound plan the results have not been in proportion to their sacrifices. Those experiments must now be considered as a warning to us to remove the defects and not as grounds for pessimism. The general development and reconstruction plans for the country will give their benefits to every one. and it is therefore incumbent upon each individual to render every assistance towards their execution. It is nevertheless necessary to bear in mind that all the burdens of such a general project must not be laid upon the shoulders of one generation alone, but a great part of the expenses should be met by capital invest ments at home, or by obtaining credits from abroad on such terms as would in no way threaten our political or economic interests. The Government organizations have been expanded far beyond the needs of the country, and they have been draining the public income to an extraordinary degree. I have issued instructions for the reorganiza tion of the Ministries in order to adjust them to the real needs of Iran. Whilst there will be provisions for employment on a larger scale than before, I hope a great effort will be made in economy in the general ex penditure, so that the amount saved may by used on real developments. In order that the public should be assured that the funds ear marked for development and reconstruction schemes are spent solely and totally on such projects, and that no other expenses are met by such funds, a special Act shall be passed, by virtue of which all such funds shall be kept in a special account, and the payment from it shall be prohibited for any expenditure other than those of reconstruction and development.. ! ' - 18 - In order also lo assure efficiency in the execution of the plan and to prevent any stoppage in the task undertaken, a Committee of Control shall be formed, entrusted with the task of supervising the exe cution of the plan, ft is hoped that it will give further confidence to the public as to the soundness of the plans. Ihe public must therefore co-operate with the Government in carry ing out these vital relorms on which economic existence of the country depend, and to refrain from listening to any malicious propoganda which may be launched by those who exploit the poverty and misery of the people to further their private ends, and to prove to the world that they are con scious of their duties towards their country and have its prosperity and progress as their ideal. 1 here is yet another point which I wish to emphasise here and which constitutes one of the primary duties of the Council: that is the neces sity for encouraging private individuals to help in the execution of the plan . I have always laid great emphasis in my declarations upon the necessity of participation of private individuals in the social and economic activities of the country. This must be carefully considered by the members of the ( mined in so far as it applies to the Reconstruction Plan . A sharp distinction must, however, be made between such enterprises as are to be conducted by private individuals under the guidance and with the support of the Government, and those which should be directly undertaken by the ( Government. I should like (o point out at this stage, as 1 have declared on seve ral occasions, that the Government will spare no efforts in protecting ca pital either from home or from foreign countries and shall support the principle of freedom of individual enterprise in economic and commercial al airs. 1 strongly hope that great many social frictions and claGs disputes which are the results of general poverty will be remove,I through the exe cution of reconstruction and development projects, and that we shall enjoy the benefits of an increase in the national in™™** i • • i . f , . national income and individual security ...a free and democratic environment, and that every Iranian national shal be able to make use of the enormous resources of Iran within the ” , ° f h,S ; eeds 7 d 1 also that by the ties of unity between all classes of people the greatness and independence of our dear Iran will he safeguarded.In conclusion I must repeat that there can be no hope for any fundamental reform unless the plans prepared for the reconstruction and development of the country are put into force. I am therefore very happy indeed to-day to notice that, notwithstanding all the difficulties A which confront the Government both at home and abroad, the first step has been taken in this matter and that we are now taking our second step. I am confident that, with your zeal and efficiency, patriotism and love for progress, further steps will be taken as quickly as possible. The Government will of course put all necessary means at the disposal of the Council and, in spite of my heavy programme of engage ments, I shall also try to attend its meetings. I wish to thank you for ac cepting the invitation and, in expectation of your future activities, 1 wish you every success in your praiseworthy efforts to serve your dear country. I shall of course be more grateful if you will strengthen my hope by your expedition in carrying out your duties with efficiency and ardour so that the Government can start work at the earliest possible time. * * * The idea of preparing long-term plans has for the first time placed a definite and clear-cut plan of work before the Ministries, which will henceforth take the place of spasmodic actions dictated by the whims and fancies of the Ministers, and will avoid the confusion which exist in the Ministries on general issues. As the availability of means for the execution of any plan is the first condition of success, Bank Melli Iran is now engaged in taking preliminary steps in the procurement of necessary funds for the execution of the plans. There is no doubt that the extent of reconstruction and development depends on the country’s financial capacity and on the possibility of obtaining credits from abroad and from banks such as the International Bank for Beconstruction and Development and the Export Import Bank of Washington.BANK MELLI IRAN BULLETIN Farvardin-Ordibehesht 1325 (April-May 1946) Vol. XIII CONTENTS* Page Companies registered during the year 1323.

The number of companies registered during the year 1323 showed a marked increase which may be attributed to the following causes: 1. The successful progress of the Allies and the prospective end of the war naturally encouranged the merchants to embark on business enterprises, and to provide the necessary capital numerous companies were founded. 2. The recent fiscal laws had so much alarmed all merchants during 1322 that no new companies had been established in that year. In 1323, however, the said laws had not only become customary by usage but were being enforced with much less rigidity than at the beginning. So much so, in fact, that the Govern ment was finally obliged to make some legislative amendments. 3. In establishment of companies, particularly joint stock companies, the usual aim is to find profitable employment for minor investments of small capital. Now, in 1323, many people who had some little money were willing to invest it in some productive business. 4. It should be remarked, however, that the increase in the number of companies registered during the year 1323 is, to some extent, a reaction from the stagnancy observed in the previous year. However the case may be explained, the number of companies registered, and the trend and progress of increase during the last fourteen years, is shown by the following figures: 1310 93 1311 326 + 233 1312 641 -j - 31o 1313 748 + 107 1314 881 + 133 1315 1182 + 301 1316 1394 + 212 1317 1582 + 188 1318 1735 + 153 1319 1873 + 138 1320 1902 + 29 1321 2072 + 170 1322 2091 + 19 1323 2195 + 104 (1) See Bank Melli Iran Bulletin, Nos. 9,10,15,18,32,43,55,61,65,72, and 76No. 81 - April - May 1946 557 &lt;1 Joint Stock Companies. The number of joint stock companies, attaining in the year 1322 to 647, rose in the year 1323 to 745, so that we have an increase of 98 in the number of com panies in the latter year. The total capital invested by these companies during the year 1322 amounted to 2096.83 million Rials. Compared to the figure 3110.02 given for the year 1323 we find that the latter has an increase of 1013119 million Rials. At Tehran the number of joint stock companies reached in the year 1323 to 292 with an aggregate capital of 1940142 million Rials. As the number of these companies in 1322 was 216 there has been an increase of 76 in 1323, while the total of capital held by these companies in Tehran shows a rise of 845180 million Rials. The total number of joint stock companies in the Provinces during the year 1323 was 453 with an aggregate capital of 1169|60 million Rls. which compared with the corresponding figures of 431 and 1002[21 for the year 1322 show an in crease of 22 in their number and 167 j 39 Rials in their capital. Thus as in the previous year a great majority of joint stock companies were registered during 1323 at Tehran which alone accounts for no less than 45 com panies more than all the other parts of Iran put together.

V ECONOMIC LAWS AND DECREES PASSED IN AZAR AND DEY ^ 1324 Summary of the Amendment to the Income Tax Law enacted on 22nei. Azar 1324. 1‘ The Ministry of Finance is authorised to declare its view on all income tax declarations made the years 1323 and 1324, so that outstanding differences (if any) may be settled in accardance with the provision of this Law. Only the tax-payers who have already paid their taxes for the above two years, and whose actual in come tax amounts to less than five thousand rials, shall be exempt from any revision made by the Ministry of Finance. 2. The “Committee of Three” in Article 19 of the former Law are hereby authorized to settle in the first instance the above-mentioned differences through mutual agreements. In the second instance cases shall be examined by another Committee, of similar kind, but composed of three members, whose decision shall be final. 3. Should the amount of tax claimed by the Ministry of Finance, however, be more than five hundred thousand rials, the decision made by the above-men tioned secondary Committee will no longer be final, and the Ministry of Finance may, within a month, object to such decision. The final investigation of the case shall then be referred to the Ministry of Finance Tribunal. Contrary to the previous Law, however, the tax-payer is entiled to complain to the Finance Tribu nal only if he has already paid the assessed tax. 4. In order to expedite and facilitate the settlemen of differences by the Committees, certain basic indications have been established as the criteria for assessing the amounts of tax payable for the years 1323 and 1324, to wit: For estates under cultivation the income-tax shall be equal to that of the year 1313 in kind, and double that amount in cash. As for the tax payable on other kinds of in come, it shall amount to three times the total amount of taxes paid in 1321 (pro vided this total is less than ten thousand rials, otherwise three times the total of taxes paid in 1320, 1321 or 1322, whichever amount is greater). The amount of tax finally fixed by the Committee through agreement with the tax-payer shall in no wise be less than the foregoing limits. 5. Notwithstanding the above stipulations, in case the tax-payers wish toNo. 79 - December 1945 - January 1946 411 settle not later than the end of he year 1324 their taxes based on the indicated data for either of the year 1323 or 1324, the Ministry of Finance is bound to accept it without further objection. 6. Taxpayers whose rate of liability is assessed in accordance with the pre sent Law shall be exempt from payment of fines stipulated by the previous law (#h er than the flne for non-submittal of income declaration, if and when the payer is liable to a tax). 7. The 18 per cent exemption of capital belonging to joint stock companies shall apply only to that portion of the capital of such companies which they had possessed before the end of Esfand 1321, For additional shares only six per cent of the capital shall be exempt from tax . LAW AUTHORIZING THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT TO TAKE PART IN THE PLAN FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND BANK PROVIDED BY THE BRETTON WOODS CONFERENCE, ENACTED ON 6 DEY 1324 SINGLE ARTICLE. The Majless authorizes the Government to sign and deli ver to the government of the United States of America the document purporting the approval of the Bretton Woods Agreement annexed to this Law, concerning the establishment of an International Monetary Fund and Bank, and confirming the Iranian Government’s participation in these two Organisations. In this connection the Majless approves the following articles which follow as a sequel to approval of the Bretton Woods Agreement: 1. The Government s authorized to take part in the International Monetary Fund, hereinafter called “the Fund”, and in the International Bank for Develop ment and Reconstruction, hereinafter called “the International Bank”, the Statutes of both of which were drawn up. as given in the annexed protocol, at the Inter national held at Bretton Woods in the United States of America, with represen tatives fiom Iian taking part in the preceedings. 2. The Government representatives for the Fund, and the International Bank and their substitutes shall be nominated by approval of the Council of Ministers upon the proposal of the Ministry of Finance. 3. The Government, or its representatives, cannot ask for a change in the parity rates of Rial in relation to the currencies of other countries which are members of the Fund, or to agree to any such change, or to accept any modification in the shares allotted to Iran in the Fund and International Bank, without the412 No. 79 - December 1945 - January 1946 previous approval of such change by the Majless. 4. Use of resources of the Fund and the financial facilities afforded by the International Bank can be obtained solely through, or with concurrence of, the Bank Melli Iran, and any deposits belonging to the International Bank or the Fund, shall be kept at the Bank Melli Iran. 5. The Issue Department of the Bank Melli Iran (Banknote Reserve Cor~^l Committee) is authorized to deliver over gold to the Fund on account of the *25% share thereof allotted to the Iranian Government in accordance with the Satutes of the Fund, and amounting to six million two hundred and fifty thousand Dollars And the receipt document obtained by the Bank Melli Iran from the Fund against the said gold shall be considered as part of the gold backing held in reserve against banknotes. In case this gold should be subsequently returned by the Fund it shall forthwith be handed over to the Issue Department of the Bank Melli. 6. Upon call made for payment of the remaining 75% of the share allotted to the Government the Bank Melli Iran is authorized to put Rials, upto the limit of the equivalent of 18,750,000 Dollars, at disposal of the Fund and, when nece ssary, to turn over to the Issue Department of the Bank Melli Iran any foreign exchange or credit obtained from the Fund against the said Rials. The Issue Department is authorized to have such foreign exchange or credit obtained in the above-mentioned manner credited to the account of the backing held against issued banknotes. The Government may issue non-interest-bearing, untransferable debentures upto the limit of the above amount and to hand them over to the Fund on account of its Rial share in the Fund. 7. The Issue Department of the Bank Melli Iran (Banknote Reserve Control Committee) is authorized to leave on demand at the disposal of the International Bank upto the limit of 19,680,000 Dollars from the gold or foreign exchange reser ves, on account of the 82% of the share of the Government in that Bank, with due consideration of the States of the International Bank. The Issue Department of the Bank Melli Iran (Banknotes Reserve Control Committee) is likewise authorised to leave funds at disposal of the said Interna tional Bank upto the limit of 4,320,000 Dollars in Rial currency, on account of the 18% remaining share of the Government in that Bank. Non-interest-bearing promissory notes, given by the Government to the Issue Department of the Bank Melli Iran as the counter-value of the share of Iran in the International Bank shall be counted as part of the backing held against banknotes. 8. Currencies of countries which are members of the Fund shall be accep table as part of the reserve backing held against issued banknotes, provided thatMajless. the financial facilities afforded by the through, or with concurrence of, the ig to the International Bank or the u ik Melli Iran (Banknote Reserve Cor^)! ;old to the Fund on account of the 25% rnment in accordance with the Satutes l two hundred and fifty thousand Dollars Bank Melli Iran from the Fund against f the gold backing held in reserve ently returned by the Fund it shall artment of the Bank Melli. he remaining 75% of the share allotted authorized to put Rials, upto the limit disposal of the Fund and, when nece- t of the Bank Melli Iran any foreign d against the said Rials.

All the data collected by the Bank on index numbers for both the cost of living and the wholesale prices for imported and ex ported goods were, therefore, prepared with a view to meeting the bank’s own pur poses. As compilation of such data was not, however, attemped before in Iran, in the earlier stages it was considered as some kind of propaganda and was ? received as the means for passive amusement. No experienced staff for the preparation of statistics and cost indices were available at the outset, and the few who knew the value of such activities were pes simistic about their ultimate result. The problem of arriving at correct cost for commodities was a real one indeed, and it is to be admitted that such a task was beyond the capacity of any single government organisation. The task was not, however, impossible for Bank Melli Iran, who had always encouraged the expansion of commerce and industry and had maintained good relationship with businessmen. The Bank enjoyed all the required co-operation of merchants and shopkeepers, and the latter were especially keen to cooperate with a concern that afforded them financial help without being hampered by the in come tax entanglements. The first step was the training of men in the Central Office on the methods of costino- and sending detailed circulars to all Branches in which full particulars were given with respect to the work in hand. In order to ensure the authenticity of the information collected for the purpose Branch Managers were made responsible for the collection and the checking of data. In some cases trained employees were sent to the Provinces in order to acquaint the local clerks with the procedure. Data received from the Provinces were thoroughly checked, and where there was any slightest doubt as to accuracy of figures or the grading and the quantity of merchandise further explanations were immediately asked for.

It will be seen that exact allocations have not been made to the various Ministries but that a percentage of the total estimated revenues has been granted to each Ministry. For purposes of comparison the expenditure figures of the budget for the financial year 1945-46 (beginning on March 21st, 1945)&gt; details of which were gi ven in my despatch N o. 82 of the 15th March, 1 945 &gt; have been calculated on a percentage basis and these percentages are shown in a parallel column, it is interesting to observe that the allocation to the Army, Gendarmerie and police has been reduced from 39$ of the total budget to 30 $&gt; hut on the other hand there has been a marited increase in the alocation to social services. The vote for education has been increased from 9»5$ to 14$ &gt; and that for the j Ministry of Health and its associated organisations has been increased i from 3 . 5 $ to 1 C$. Article 3 of the Law gives the Ministry of Finance the right, for a period of 1 5 years, to take over the whole of the revenue derived from the sugar monopoly, road taxes and port charges, and this revenue is, in accordance with Article 4&gt; to be devoted to the completion of the railway system, the construction and repair of metalled roads and of buildings, and the completion of schemes connected with public welfare. It is also interesting to observe from Article 5 that all Government liabilities are to be consolidated and funded in a single account v/ith the Bank Melli, and that these liabilities are to be liquidated within a period of 15 years from the oil royalties derived from the A.I.O.C* The Bill represents an attempt at long term planning and as such is a welcome innovation, but as already stated it is now somewhat doubtful whether it will ever be nresented and annnoved. I have the honour to be, with the highest respect. Sir, Your most humble, obedient servant, (Sgd.) R.W. Bullard. H.M. AMBASSADOR.
