The letter also reminds the Colonel that officers on the Punjaub [Punjab] frontier wishing to visit the Khan's dominions should inform him first, which is what had caused the dissatisfaction and irritation on the part of the Khan.The letter proceeds by stating that he does not see how the recent proceedings at Khelat could be viewed as unbecoming or a dangerous sort of agitiation, and that what had occured was oring to an ommission of an act of courtesy towards the Khan, also that the enclosed copies of the Political Diary of Captain Harrison did not show anything that could be construed as an attack on His Highness the Ameer of Cabul [Amir of Kabul] and that nothing in the entries could be seen as a cause for alarm. Also stating that Ibrahim Khan had written similar letters to the British Government requesting aid in return for his allegience, and was no more likely to receive a favourable reply from the Khan, and that Colonel Phayre's response to Captain Harrison in this matter had temporarily closed this useful means of obtaining valuable information, for which Merewether had placed a sum of money at Captain Harrison's disposal for the purpose of procuring good intelligence from Seistan as it was considered a matter of the greatest importance.The letter concludes by again requesting that Colonel Phayre refrain from his unnecessary suspicions of proceedings in Khelat and his hasty assumptions of wrong motives from the Khan and his endeavours to find fault with Captain Harrison and stating that they are not all unjust to both individuals, but are injurious to public interests and needlessly take up the time of those individuals to whom correspondence his addressed.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024102474.0x000012#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
