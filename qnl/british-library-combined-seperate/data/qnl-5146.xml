Most of the file is concerned with requests for the Political Agent's assistance, made by the Consul on behalf of various Bahraini citizens. The file contains translated copies of letters and petitions addressed to the Consul, and one item that is written in Arabic: an original copy of a letter, which is also addressed to the British Consul.Matters discussed in the correspondence include: the repatriation to Basra (where his father lives) of a boy living in Bahrain; the arrest (and subsequent release without charge) in Iraq of a Bahraini citizen; disputes regarding the nationalities of persons enlisted for military training under Iraq's conscription law; a Bahraini citizen's request for assistance in the recovery of proceeds and jewellery from two fellow Bahrainis; the verification of the legality (in British law) of a marriage performed in the Shara [Sharia] Court of Bahrain.Other correspondents include the Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, and Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, Adviser to the Government of Bahrain.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Basra</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Claims</topic></subject><subject><topic>Foreigners</topic></subject><subject><topic>Repatriation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Conscription</topic></subject><subject><topic>Nationality</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000274#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000274#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000274#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
