It bas always been the Company who have insisted on closure of Jask station by December next. At their request we have recently obtained formal assurance that they may leave then. Their change of plan makes us look foolish. But I have no reason to suppose that the Persian Government will object to the operation of Jask station until cable ship is available. I hope however that Company will send ship as soon as they can. 2.

Lomu ti e after t ie conclusion of the said agree ment, when negotiations were in progress between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the British negation concerning the handing- oyer of the wireless apparatus which was formerly working at Lingah and was subsequently abandoned,the reply received from His Britannic ajesty’s Legation was to the effect that the question of handing over of the Persian Gulf wireless stations to the Iranian Government would be settled in the ccurse of a general agreement to u© concluded between the two Governments and the matter was there fore left in abeyance. In the meanwhile,that is after the conclusion of the agreement relating to the handing over of the Indo-huropean Telegraph Company, most of the stations in question were removed and of those which were formerly working in the Persian Gulf there iiow remains only that of Bushire,which is used for communications between jushira and certain places near Bushire in the Persian yulf that have wireless apparatus for aeroplanes passing to and fro in the neighbourhood of ju shire,and likewise for ships coming within signalling range of the Bus hire station. Mow that Iranian wireless apparatuses are being established at Bushire and Jask for such kind of communications,the competent quarters of the Imperial Government are of opinion that a decision should be taken beforehand concerning the British wireless at Bushire so that it may not interfere with tin; eomt uu:noat ions of the Iranian wireless stations,when the latter come into oper‘ date will previously be notified.

It now appears that wireless stations at Henj am and Lingah and (?are) entirely property of His Majesty’s Government ani/or Government of India. 2. Transmitting apparatus now in use at Bushire is on the other hand property of Cable and Tireless, who state that station is at present worked with rt continuous wave” set constructed locally by their operators to meet international anti “spark” regulations in force since 1st January 1935. Me need not therefore be deterred from telling Persian Government that the other two stations are obsolete by the fear that this might raise inconvenient questions as to whether Bushire station complies with existing regulations. 3. Cable and v/ireless would be most reluctant to s^e Bushire wireless station pass into Persian hands even after Cable re-organization is complete, and would like to ccntinue to use it so long as existing temporary apparatus is reason ably efficient. But latter point can be considered later. 4 0 Meanwhile as soon aa you have notified Persian Government of impending cable re-organization you may, unless Government of India see apy objection, reply to enquiries regarding wireless stations on the following lines.

(3) Locally constructed apparatus now in use at Bushire i s of little or no value. Moreover wire less station is in the same site as cable station and it would cause great inconvenience if it were to be worked separately from cable station.

I should be grateful if you would communicate the Iranian Government’s request to the Company and inform me of their reply. 4 Reference to installation at Jask is presumably a mistake, since transmitting set there was dismantled in 1932. In any case Jask cable station will shortly close. But I should be grateful if Company would confirm that there is now no wireless transmitting installation at Jask. SEYMOURI x° L c. t ?Jg$. A ?

Dear Consulate-General, Your despatch No. 508 - S of 1937 of the 2nd July, enclosing a copy of a letter from Mr. Humphrey about the closing of the Jask station. 2. We are very glad to see that the Company do not propose to pursue their plan of leaving the cable permanently landed on the beach at Jask. 3. The Minister sees no harm in asking the Iranian Government now how soon the land line to Jask will be ready, and we enclose a copy of a letter which Butler is sending to the Acting Minister of Posts putting the question. As the Company do not now seem to be in any hurry to leave Jask, Butler has not said anything to spur the Ministry to greater activity. 4 . We are sending a copy of this letter, together with a copy of the enclosure to your despatch under reference, to Baggallay at the Foreign Office. Yours ever. Chancery. British Consulate-General, Bushire.Copies to Mr. Baggallay and Bushire. No. 104/8/37 21st July, 1937. As Your Excellency is doubtless aware some six months ago Mr. Trott had some correspondence with His Excellency the late Minister of Posts and Telegraphs about the closing of the cable station of Cable and Wireless Limited at Jask. In his letter No. 237/22/36 of the 31st December, 1936 (10th Day, 1315), Mr. Trott reminded His Excellency that Gable and Wireless Limited had only agreed to remain at Jask for two years from November, 1935 (Abanmah - Azarmah, 1314), and His Excellency replied in his letter No. 12978/61 of the 11th January (21st Day, 1315) saying that the Imperial Government would make every effort to complete the landline to Jask as soon as possible. 2. The Company are naturally anxious to know as far ahead as possible how soon the land line will be completed, and I should therefore be most grateful if Your Excellency will be so good as to inform me whether you are yet in a position to say when the land line will be ready for operation. It would be a great convenience if Your Excellency could let me have an early reply, even if it is as yet impossible for the Imperial Government to give more than an approximate date for the completion of the line. (Signed) Nevile Butler. His Excellency, Monsieur Mohammad Hakimi, Acting Minister of Posts and Telegraphs.No. 51/292 Cable and Wireless Limited, Karachi Branch. 24th June, 1957 . Dear Sir, Evacuation of Jask. With reference to the correspondence ending with your communication forwarded to me as a service telegram under reference BH/NS dated 28th March, giving H.M. Minister’s observations on the Company’s expressed desire to retain the cable landing place at Jask, these were conveyed to my Company for their further comments. In reply they state that after due consideration of H.M. Minister’s remarks it has been decided that the technical reasons for this measure are not of sufficient importance to justify taking up the matter with the Imperial Government of Iran. Consequently, when it is decided to close the cable branch at Jask, the cables will be taken out and joined through at sea, as was originally intended* It will be recalled that the reason for staying at Jask for two years from November, 1935, was in order to oblige the Imperial Government and allow time for the construction of a Government of a Government land line to join up with the main interior system, probably at Bunder Abbas* At the same time, though the arrangement was not disclosed to the Iranian Government, the Company obtained certain support from the Air Companies using Jask as a refuelling point, during the two years ending November 30th 1937. It may be mentioned that this support is the sole factor which makes it worth the Company’s while to keep the Jask Branch open. The/ e Secretary to the Honourable the Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire*The Air Companies no* desire to extend this agreement for a further twelve months to November, 1938, but, before acceding to this reQuest, it is necessary to know if the Iranian Government will be in a position before that date to request the Company to evacuate Jask. It would seem a reasonable estimate to allow a further eighteen months before the Iranian Government could expect to complete the construction of a landline from Jask to Bunder Abbas, unless this project is further advanced than the information at my disposal might lead me to suppose. It is clear, therefore, that this uncertain period if it could be estimated more precisely, will determine whether or no the Company can meet the wishes of the Air Companies by extending the agreement with them to 30th November, 1938. The Company would be glad, therefore, if you would kindly approach H.M. Minister at Tehran on the subject and obtain his views whether, now that the full facts are before him, it would be wise to approach the Iranian Government in this matter. You will appreicate that the Company do not wish to disclose the existence of this agreement with the Air Companies, so any application made to the Iranian Government should be grounded on the Company’s desire to meet their wishes. Yours faithfully (signed) F.W. Humphrey Divisional Manager, Persian Gulf.COPY INDIA Din E 4V56/67/65) No#292 104/12/3V) BRITISH LEGATION, TEHRAN. 31st July, 1937.

'In reply to youf letter No. 104/8/37 of the 24th July last(2nd Murdad 1316), which reached this Ministry on the 28th July ( 6 th Murdad), concerning the extension of the land line to Jask, I beg to state that, since for certain reasons the proposal to lay a land line has been dropped, it is therefore proposed to maintain communication with Jask by wireless for the time being. The installation of a wireless set at Jask, and another at Bushire, is in hand, and I hope that these will be completed in the near future. Under these circumstances, I presume that it will not be necessary for the staff of Cables and Wireless Ltd to remain at Jask for longer than the period formerly requested, i.e. until December 1937 Ends. This contradicts statement of late Minister of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones reported in paragraph 2 of my telegram to you No. 99 of the 31st December 1936 But I presume Company will welcome possibility of closing station at Jask as early as December next. Letter Ministry/Ministry of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones is, I think, too vague to be taken as formal notice that Company may leave in December. Company may wish me to ask for this.

Once in coirmunication on these wave lengths they find another wave length on which they make their e ommunic at Iona. Apart from 1 ncse waves, which are used for only a short interval,they choose for their work waves which do not coincide with the wave- neighbouring stations and thus do not inconvenience th# .atter.

The following is an. extract from telegram of April 21st received from Imperial Airways representative at Karachi. Begins^. Jask has opened wireless station which is reported by Gwadur to be transmitting aimlessly. On April 18th Jaak transmitted practically continuously for an hour, apparently to nobody in particular, complete interference being caused as Gwadur and Shargah cannot work during these periods. On April 17th danger arose owing to impossibility supply urgent, nil visibility reports to our west ncL eLso gi eau difficulty in G-wadur giving requests for urgent Ends * We understand that interference takes place on 900 metres which is exclusively reserved for aeronautical communications under International Tele-Oo^unication -Conventian of Madrid^ to which Persia is signatory c Tbs Convention also provided that wireless stations must be operated so as to avoid interference with other services and special restrictions are laid down in respect of testing of stations, 3* We suggest that His Majesty 5 s Minister at Tehran should to instructed to make urgent representations to the Iranian Government* Imperial Airways have particularly asked that no reference/ 21APM937 officereference to them should be made in representations to Iranian authorities^ but there appears to be no objection to referring to aeronautical services carried by wireless stations at bwadur a.nd Bhang ah* It can ? if necessary^ be stated that complaint has been received by the Government of India from their Posts and Telegraphs Department.&gt;y. 2002/67/65). ,ies to: Mr. Baggallay No. 104/5/37 Major Hay No. 104/5/37 J 04 / 5/37 18tii March, 1937. Would you refer to your printed letter Ho. 8 B of 1937 of the 20th February, enclosing a copy of a letter from Mr. Humphrey about the position of Cable and Wireless Limited at Jask? 2. It rather looks from the last paragraph of this letter as if the Company now intend to make the permanent join in the cable from Muscat to Bushire on the beach at Jask, and leave it there, so that the cable will remain permanently with a landing at Jask, though there will now be no station or instruments there. If this is in fact their intention, it would seem to involve a rather important departure from the original scheme of re-organisation. We always understood that the Jask station was to be closed in order that a direct connection might be made between Muscat and Bushire without any landing-point, and you will see from the copy of Knatchbull-Hugessen’s note No. 564 of the 27th September, 1935, which was enclosed in his despatch to you No. 93 of the 25th September, 1935, that we definitely told the Iranian Government that henceforth Bushire will be the only point at which the cable will land on Iranian territory The Minister, who is away and has asked me to write this letter, thinks that if the Company now want to leave the cable permanently with a landing at Jask, we probably ought/ ■ curable ■ tenant Colonel T.C.W. Fowle, C.B.B., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire......Ik'B -aaaitWMj ought to inform the Iranian Government of this change of plan and ask if they have any objection to it. it is of course impossible to predict whether they will object. But it would perhaps not be entirely unreasonable if they did object to our leaving the cable with a landing at jask, but no station, so that they are being forced to go to the expense of building a land line to Jask, although our line will still go there. 3. The point seems of some importance, and we should therefore be very grateful if you could find out from Mr. Humphrey whether we have understood the last paragraph of his letter aright. 4. I am sending copies of this letter and of Mr. Humphrey’s to Baggallay at the Foreign Office No. 104/5/37 and to Hay in the Foreign and Political Department No. 104/5/37. (Signed).

It is noted with satisfaction that the longest possible notice of the date of withdrawal will be given to the Company, who consider three months the minimum period conformable to the position. The Company also appreciate that they may be forced to remain at Jask, if necessary, until after November of this year.

Trott Esquire, orientai Secretary at His Majesty's Legation, Tehran, to His Excellency Sezara-ed-Din HIStmat, Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. Ho. 237/S2/36 of the 31st December, 1936. Your Excellency, you will doubtless remember that when Your Excellency was good enough to receive me on the 33rd December, we had some dis cussion about the length of the period for which Cable and Wirelea Limited had agreed to remain at Jask. I told Your Excellency that I understood that the Company regarded the two-year period men tioned in the correspondence on the subject which took place at the end of 1935 as a maximum, beyond which they could not be re quired to remain at Jask* Your Excellency, however, thought that they had agreed to stay for a minimum period of two years in any such case, and if necessary for ft further period as would enable the Imperial Government to complete the land line from Bandar Abbas to Jask. * f 2 . I have now had an opportunity to look up the correspondence in question. I find that it is true that in his note No. 36707/ 2887 of the 11th November, 1935, His Excellency Monsieur Soheily said that while the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs would try to ensure that the land line to Jask would be completed within two years, they would expect that the Company would remain at Jask until the land line was completed, even if more than two yeaio were required for the work* In his note No* 893 of the November in reply, Mr* Mallet said that the Company thought that the period of two years might be expected to prove more oh sufficient for the establishment of a land telegraph line to J He added, however, that should the Iranian authorities meet with unforeseen difficulties, the Company would be prepared, when time came, to discuss the question of their remaining a further period. To this note His Excellency Monsieu replied in his note Ho. 38321/3039 of the 9th December, giving would endeavour to a n assurance that the Imperial Governmen construct a land line to Jask within two years* /3.- 2 - [ 1937 ! 3 . It will thus be seen that the Company have not in fact given any undertaking to remain at Jaak for more than two years from Hovember 1935, though I have no doubt that in consonsaioe with the friendly relations xkzKk so happily existing between the Company and Your Excellency's Department, they will he ready to stay longer at Jask should it be impossible for the Imperial Government to complete the new land line within the l two years. But I arasure that Your Excellency will appreciate that the Company are remaining at Jask at considerable incon venience and expense to themselves, and that they are exceedingly anxious to close their station there at the earliest possible moment. Both the Company and His Majesty*s Government have good reason to be deeply grateful to Your Excellency for the ready assistance which you have often given in connection with Company’s affairs. I need hardly say how greatly they will appreciate any action which Your Excellency may feel able to take to ensure that the work of completing the land line to Jask is carried through with the utmost possible despatch.

Oriental Secretary saw Minister of Posts and Telegraphs on 23rd December and informed him that Company had agreed to give up quarters in question, tennis court and outhouses. Minister expressed his warm thanks and said he fully realised how much his Ministry owed to Company’s co-operation. 2* Oriental Secretary then referred to points raised in paragraph 3 of your telegram No.33. With regard to (a) Minister stated definitely that establishment of wireless station at Jask would not (repeat not) affect date on which Company could leave. It was only coastal wireless for communication with aircraft and ships. He therefore asked that Company should stay until land line to Bandar Abbas was complete. Oriental Secretary said that Company were anxious to leave as soon as possible, and that they regarded two year period as maximum. His Excellency replied that he had understood that it was minimum and that they had agreed to stay longer if necessary. However he promised to do his best to complet line as soon as possible. But delay was inevitable owing to all supplies and smallness of his budget and requirement tnax work should be put up for tender. 3. I fear that it is only too probable that Company /wills O 337 will be forced to stay at Jask after 1st November 19377^ I am reminding His excellency of terms of correspondence enclosed in Tehran despatches to you Nos«lll,ll 3 and 118 of 1935, (Nos* 496, 515 and 56o respectively to Foreign Office) and will continue to urge him to hurry on work. Be is consistently helpful and will certainly do his best. 4. With regard to no rice of date when evacuation would be possible. His Excellency readily gave assurance that he would give longest possible notice. He asked what notice the Company wanted, and said he hoped to be able to give three months. 5. Points raised in paragraph 2 of your telegram No. 95 have not been mentioned to Minister. In unlikely event of evacuation before 1st November, 1937, I think it would be difficult to argue that Company should retain quarters let to air companies until that date. Further I am not quite clear what is situation contemplated by Company in which they would require use of cable house and cable landing place after evacuation of Jask station.

My dear Baggallay, I enclose a copy of a letter from Colonel Fowle dated the 29th May in which he points out that it will be open to the Iranian Government to object to the new Bushire-Bahrein cable. Our failure to mention this part of the t? reorganisation the Iranian Government was of course deliberate, and was designed to avoid getting involved in a controversy with them. Our attitude was, I think, that as the Bushire-Bahrein cable would not technically be a new cable but would be a T piece off the Bushir e-Mus cat-Karachi cable, ell of it being outside Persian territorial waters, it was not strictly necessary to mention it. It is, however, obviously the case, as Fowle points out, that for practical purposes there is a new Bushire-Bahrein cable which is not in fact covered by any agreement between His Majesty’s ttu, Government and the Iranian Government^ You will, no^ doubt, agree that i-g-a rirsk ■whlch.lias to be takers fa/- Baggallay, Esq., lVK&lt;y Foreign Office.2 .

Under the Telegraph Agreement of 17th February 1952, Cable and Wireless, as the Agent of His Majesty’s Govern ment and the Government of India, acquired the right of working the existing cables and stations on the Iranian side of the Gulf. The Bushire-Bahrain cable, however, is a new one, which was not covered by the Agreement of 1932, and which was not mentioned to the Iranian Government in obtaining their consent to the cable reorganisation scheme of 1955 (vide paragraph 2 of Foreign Office tele gram No.170, dated the 26th August 1935, to Tehran). If the Iranians want to be unpleasant at any time they can presumably demand the disconnection of this cable on tuese two grounds. This would not isolate Bahrain, wnose present wireless installation is capable of communicating with Basrah and Karachi, but it would deprive the Company of an alternative route in case of certain breakdowns. The position has, doubtless, not escaped notice, but X have thought it worth while to mention tne matter. ^ .p 4 &gt;vnc Totter to Metcalfe, I am sending copies of tins letter Butler at Tehran and Hickinbotham. iTU/lo C.Walton Esauire, CB.,MC., The India Office* 'London.

In reply I have to inform you that my Company would have no objection to the closure of our* Wireless Station Bushire if the Iranian Government so desire# We have begun a general scheme of technical re equipment for t he working of the Gulf cables and it occurred to us that if our Bushire hadio had to close down that office building would become available for the installation of the new instruments for working the cables and landlines. I have accordingly put forward to my Company a plan ^eta^.ling this suggestion which offers many technical advantages Among these is the important one that the building is our own property and already houses our power plant and batter ies, which it will be necessary to extend# Before the scheme is adopted I should be grateful if you could inform me wnether any difficulty is likely to arise t«tn the Iranian Government over this projected transfer oj. the Present Cable Office to the Radio building. i • Yours faithfully, Sd. y.W.

Jhe new set may however only be intended for communication with aircraft and not intended to interfere in any way with the operations of Cable and Wireless.

In connection with a proposed reorganisation of the cables m the Persian Gulf the Coy. and H.M.G. no longer wish to avail themselves of this permit, except m respect of the cable station at Bushire* A conwunicatiorr was made to the Persian Govt, in the sense of para. 2 of F.O. telegram of 26th August, 1935, flagged A. Discussions with the Persian Govt, on the subject are reported m the further telegrams on the file, notably those at flags B, C and D, from which it will be seen that the Persian Govt, accepted the Coy.’s offer^^utject to the Coy. maintaining the cable station at Jask until the Persian Govt, have communication by landlmes with that place. Will you please see the F.O. letter of 22 nd February enclosing a letter from the Coy* of 10 th January and a proposed reply. I should have thought that the 1 was natural construction of Art. IV of the Agre ernent/that subpara. 1 permits us to maintain the stations, etc., so long as we carry out any obligations resting on us under the remaining subparas., and not that it imposes any o„bliga.tion to maintain the stations, etc. Could you kindly say whether you consider this a reasonable construction? real doubt about the f the fact that the But even if there is any construction, it seems that, in view o Persian/ rMr.Walt on, m. i. an .,o.a„ n8lj hTOtl „ lM ■ 'r 4 - ^ In Mr.Bagjjallay 1 a LU.r to •minister at Tehran, dated 18th April 1935, P.Z.2856/35, the auestinn question was put forward (see paragraph 7) whether H m r nether H.M.P. and the (Jovernment of India are under an obligation to operate the cable stations which Article IV of the 1932 Telegraph Agreement gives them &amp;e mi salon to operate. So far as I nan v iar as 1 can make out the question has never been very deeply considered - certainly no decision has 'been reached. If there were, an obligation on the principals (H.M.G. and the Government of India) or their agent (Cable and Wire!ess Ltd.) to maintain the stations then their withdrawal from one or more of them would clearly entitle the Persian Government to claim compensation or perhaps to denounce the Agreement as a whole. As tne foreign Office point out, however, the fact that tne Persian (iovernment has acquiesced in the withdrawal precludes them from claiming compensation for non-fulfilment of the Agreement whatever the interpretation of Article IV may be. Since the question of a. claim for compensation does not arise a fo rt ior i the question of who would be responsible for paying the compensation does not arise. So we can tell Cable and Wireless not to worry, which is what this proposal in fact boils down to. I have made in the draft letter to the Foreign Cilice now submitted some meticulous points which explain themselves. t may not be worth making them but perhaps there is no harm in doing so. Lit,p.

Lord Zetland concurs generally in the draft of the reply which Mr.Eden /proposes to return to Captain Lawson. His Lordship would, however, suggest the following minor alterations for consideration:- (1) substitute ’’alleged” for 'the' in line 7 of paragraph 1; (2) revise the last part of the first sentence of paragraph 2 as follows:- ' were liable to the Persian Government for non- fulfilment of the Agreement, and the further question whether the Persian Government, in default of satisfaction, financial or otherwise, might have become entitled to denounce the Agreement altogether, might have arisen.”r- n 3 } ■ ■ ■ (S') omit the last three the last paragraph ( the India Office Legal Adviser has not in fact been formally consulted'on the questions at issue).

Sir, \ Foreign Office. S.W.l. 22nd February, 1936. I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to transmit to you, herewith, the accompanying copy of a letter from Captain Lawson, of Cable and Wireless Limited, to Mr. Rendel, of this department, in which Captain Lawson raises the question of the degree of liability which might attach to Cable and Wireless Limited, as the agent of His Majesty’s Government'in the United Kingdom and the Government of India, should thfe / / Persian Government seek to recover damages for the non-fulfilment- through the recent closing or partial closing of the cable ^stations at Hen jam, Jask and Charbar - of the terms of the Agreement of 17th February, 1932. A draft espy- of the reply which the Secretary of State proposes, subject to the concurrence of the Marquess of Zetland, to return to Captain Lawson, is also enclosed. / 2. It is possible that Captain Lawson is seeking an assurance, not only in regard to the direct liability of Cable and Wireless Limited towards the Persian Government, but also in regard to their liability to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India in the hypothetical event of His Majesty s Government and the Government of India wishing to recover their agent any damages v/hich they, as the principal , compelled to pay to the Persian Government. Inasmuch as Cable and Wireless Limited have in all matters pertaining to the closing of the cable stations ■ acted with the consent and even the active approval of His Majesty's Government and the it, ta Government of India, it A 6 -* 11 '' 1 l ! 1 t-c''' y Lt! , I BJCLOSUr.E I' _ Majesty's ^ 12 MAR 1936 | Secretary of State, ,, I 1.1'.;“;;p T india offk&gt;h u-isi. Office# ^ —dp t liL-ii* — —Majesty’s Government and the Government of India could in practice seek to recover such damages, although they might not necessarily feel called upon, in a converse situation, to repay to Cable and Wireless Limited any damages which they, as the agent, were compelled to pay* It is questionable, however, whether, as a matter of law, any claim can be made by the Persian Government against Cable and Wireless Limited for breach of the agreement of 1932, because the company is not a party to that agreement. On the other hand, the question whether Cable and Wireless Limited would be legally liable to make good such damages to their principal is one that does not concern the Foreign Office alone, or even principally. It seems to concern primarily the India Office, who made the Agreement of 1 28th August/lst September/l2th September, 1930 with Imperial and International Communications Limited by which that Company (now Cable and Wireless Limited) became the Agent of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India under the subsequently- concluded Agreement of 17th February, 1932. But before any reply could be sent to Cable and Wireless Limited it would doubtless be necessary to consult the Treasury, the Imperial Communications Committee and presumably the Government of Inula. Even with such consultation it is unlikely that the reply would take the form of a definite assurance or that His Majesty s Government could say more than that they were unable to commi themselves in regard to the recovery from a third party of a *iy damages which they might be compelled to pay under pothetical verdict. 3. m these circumstances Mr. Eden would prefer not to lunteer any statement in regard to the question of H + o-nrf the Government of India, between His Majesty’s Government . _ the other, unless and until the one side, and their agent Cable% ‘ t ~ Cable and Wireless Limited ask for such a statement in more explicit language than is used in Captain Lawson's letter. The draft reply enclosed with this letter accordingly deals only with the question of liability towards the Persian Government. 4. I am 1,0 request that Mr. Eden may receive Lord Zetland's observations upon this letter at an early date, as Captain Lawson’s letter has already been left without a reply for some little time.

Monsieur le Gerant, With reference to Your Excellency's note No. 36146/2937 of the 16th November (26th Aban), I have the honour to inform you that Gable and Wireless Limited state that it is difficult to give even an approximate estimate of the cost of the repairs which are necessary in the cable from Hen jam to Bander Abbas. The cost depends mainly upon the length of time for which the cable ship is delayed, and this in turn depends upon the length of cable which must be renewed, which cannot be determined until the cable is raised and examined. But assuming that nothing more proves to be necessary than reconnecting two simple breaks,the time required might not amount to more than two days. The charter charge of the vessel is about £300 (three hundred pounds) per day. Any new cable required would cost about £17b (one hundred and seventy five pounds) per mile. 2 , The Company have, however, /already Hie ExO®l lenc y Monsieur A* S°heily» Affairs.

I have telephoned to Lawson and given him the substance of the telegram and have also sent him a confirmatory letter. Lawson told me that he assumed the explanation given by Mallet about the chartering of the cable ship was correct, but he could not say for certain because, when the Company first had to execute repairs to this cable for the Persian Government, they had applied to the Government of India for information regarding the basis on which the Indo-European Telegraph Department had assessed the charges made to the Persian Government for similar services in the past, but had never/ .auson, Esq.never received any reply. in consequence the Company had had to frame their charges in the light of the charges which they would have made to any other Government in similar circumstances, without any purely Persian precedent to guide them. Lawson seemed to think that even if the Persian Government gave no satisfactory answer about the 1932 amount before the cable ship left Hen jam, the Company might nevertheless decide to carry out the repairs in order not to make bad blood with the Persians. But this must not be taken as a definite decision because it appears that some of the Directors had not been at all pleased when they heard about the offer to do the present repairs free of charge, in return for a settlement of the 1932 account, and they would probably be even less willing to do the repairs free of charge without obtaining any satisfaction regarding the 1932 aaount. Lawson told me that the cable ship was still engaged on repairs to the Bushire-Pao cable, and had not reached Henjam. It should however be ready to leave for Hen jam by about 12 th December.r CONFIDENTIAL.

No. 35707/2887 of Aban 19th, isu (11th November, 1935). Monsieur le Charge d’Affaires, In reply to His Excellency Mr. Knatchbull- Hugessen’s notes regarding the handing over of the Jask and Charbar telegraph line up to the Baluchistan frontier and the closing of the cable stations in Henjam and Jask, I have the honour to state that, although, in accordance with the Agreement of February 17th, 1932, it was arranged that the cable arrangements of the Persian Gulf should remain unchanged up to the year 1945, yet as His Excellency the British Minister has requested that assistance may be afforded as far as possible to the views of the Cable Company, the competent quarters agree that: !• cable station at Henjam shall be closed down, and 2, the land line between Jask and Chnrbar up to ^mbrcn r , as well as the buildings and dependencies thereof,shall be taken over from the Company with an expression of thanks. As regards the cutting of the cable line at Jask, the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs will try to ensure telegraphic communication with that place within two years from now. If, however, after the expiry of the said period he installation of lines which shall have been started is ot finished, the above Ministry will expect that the Cable ampany on their part shall maintain the said station till the termination of the work. , x In conclusion I have to point out the fact that necessary instructions have been issued to the compet /quarters2 3 V; quarters to extend their assistance in respect of the exportation of the stores, accessories, apparatus and surplus articles of the Gable Company. As regards, however, the export of arms, as special permission must he obtained, necessary steps have been taken in the matter and I snail not fail to inform you of the result shortly.

Please see note at P.Z.3549/35* in which it was explained that after due consideration Toy the authorities and Departments concerned it had heen decided that Cable and Wireless Ltd., should withdraw from their stations at Hen jam, Gharbar and Jask, thus removing their cable from Persian territory save at Bushire, and should link up with the Arab coast at Bahrein, where a wireless station would be erected which would be able to communicate with distance stations such as Aden. It was also decided that the Persian Government should be informed of the changes contemplated as soon as, but noo before, the Company were ready to put them in bo effect. The/The necessary arrangements were made in due course hy the Company and oust before they were to he put into operation the necessary communication was made to the Persian Government. Unfortunately the latter reacted very strongly against the proposals on the ground that they would result in Charbar and Jash being entirely cut off from communication with the interior of Persia. The reason for this being so (which I do not think had been really appreciated by the Departments concerned) is that while there is a landline from Tehran to Bunder Abbas (whence a line goes partly by sea and partly by land to Hen jam) and v/hile there is a landline from Karachi as far as Jask, there is no land communication between Jask and Bunder Abbas. Jask and Charbar have therefore relied for their communications with the interior of Persia on the cables of Cable and Wireless Ltd%—(&lt;. /? H'av^c . ' A There is, of course, no reason, in view of the exjr-B-ting tiresome attitude which the Persian Government have always adopted to Cable and Wireless, why we should kwiJi hesitated to cause inconvenience of this kind to the Persian Government. On the other hand the Company pointed out that they were afraid of experiencing difficulty with the local Persian authorities for getting pemission for their personnel and instruments etc. to be withdrawn from the stations which they are evacuating. It _ p fir* aiso r be the Persians if they / were really annoyed, to make it impossible for Cable and Wireless to remain in Bushire. It was felt desiraTole, therefore, that some interim arrangement should, if possible, he made by the Company to meet the objectionsMinute Paper.

It is interesting to note that, in fact, this arrangement will ^eost the Company nothing, as the French and Duteh^lines were so appalled by the prospect of being left to the mercy of the Persian Post Office at Jask, where they have a landing ground, that they are even prepared to pay the Company to remain there. It is accordingly possible for the Company to make a generous gesture to the Persian Government without any expenditure. It appears from Tehran telegram of the 11th November No.341R&gt; now received, that the suggested arrangement is generally acceptable to the Persian Government, and it seems reasonable to assume that they are not likely to give any more trouble over the re-organisation scheme. The only point of real importance in the whole matter is the danger of a threat to the Station at Bushire which is, of course, of vital importance, at any rate so long as the Political Resident stays at Bushire Under the Telegraph Agreement with Persia His Majesty s Government (or their agents, viz.

Reference:- Foreign office telegram No. 198 of October 8th, 1935. Ho. 622 dated October 22nd, 1935 to the Iranian Minister ’oreign Affairs. Copies have been sent to the Foreign secretary to the Government of India No. 232, and to H.M.Consul-General Bushire No. 104#3-r Ur. t-j. fl* Ua Please see my note on P.Z.8169/35 which I was D V * to „», forwdrd. .« h .„ „„ „„ from the Government of India and Tehran. The point in paragraph 3 of the Government of India’s telegram needs an answer. The history of the matter is briefly as follows. The Persian Minister of Posts in conversation with the Legation on October 5th said that if the Company were to insist on going ahead with their reorganisation scheme at once he could not say whether the Shah might not demand that they should evacuate Bushire too. He added 'but I very much hope it will not come to this. I should much prefer a friendly arrangement'. (P.Z. 7181/35 - paragraph 5 of Tehran telegram of 5th October). The Government of India at the end of their telegram of 11th October (P. Z. 7313/35) said that if His Majesty's Government considered that a demand for withdrawal from Bushire could not successfully he resisted, then the programme of reorganisation might, if practicable, be postponed 'on the understanding that... question of closure of Bushire station is definitely dropped by Iranian Government M . Meanwhile, of course, arrangements had been under discussion for a modification of the scheme to meet the Persian objections. Cable and Wireless Limited, in their letter of 17th October (P. Z. 7506/35) added a proviso ’’that no objection A will be raised to the carrying out of the remainder of the Programme for reorganisation of the Gulf system' in the e vent of the suggested modification of the scheme (in regard to Jask) being adopted. Instructions were then issued to His Majesty’s Minister (P.Z. 7611/35 - Foreign Office telegram of 18th v October/2 . October) to inform the Persian n Peraia-n Government of the propca. ««„, th „ t „ ,, ^ «h. underatanding lh , t th .

The persian reply is reported in Mr .Mallet ♦ „ ailet 8 telegram of nth iiovember (P. Z. 8! 69/35). It did not refer ^ ^ understanding on which the Company- s offer was made. The question now is whether the Persian Government should be asked for a formal written undertaking on the subject. The Government of ln dia think they should. His Majesty-s Charge* d'Affaires points out that His Majesty's Minister's note did not ask f nr — r ^r c r* h&lt;r»t, for w imHi-i UxiLiV: but merely stated the understanding^ and that the Persian reply seems to imply acceptance. He is however prepared to ask for a written undertaking if instructed. The Foreign Office feel - and this seems reasonable that there is little to be gained by pressing for a ^^B^fiUVU^dertaking, whereas much might be lost. The Persians are constitutionally averse from formal undertakings, and would probably hedge. We might get involved in a long correspondence on details (e.g. they m ight offer to undertake to allow the Company to remain at -Busftre H so long as they remain at Jask” or something awkward of that kind.) Moreover, if they are to give an undertaking in regard to the reorganisation programme as a it might be necessary to give a detailed description of the programme, including the arrangements made at Bahrein. This opportunity might be takenby tli© Persians to revive _ . . tj t. “ontroversy about th eir claim to Bahrein. On the whole it seems much the best to leare matters where they are. A draft telegram to India had been drafted in consultation with the Foreign Office before Mr.Mallefs telegram of 16th November arrived. It has now been amended in the light of the latter telegram. If you eonr-u,. u you concur, if Foreign Office have no more to say, it might issue ?

London, W.C,2. 14th November, 1935 . Dear Mr, Rendel, With reference to the conversation which took place in your Office yesterday morning regarding my Company’s plans in the Persian Ghilf, and more especially in relation to the telegram from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran to the Foreign Office, the substance of which you were kind enough to convey to me, my Company is pleased to note that the Persian Government have agreed to the closing of the Henjam Cable Station and that they accept my Company’s offer to hand over the landlines from Jask to Charbar and Gwadur. As regards the Persian Government’s statement to the effect that they will expect the Company to continue maintaining the Cable Station at Jask should they be unable to arrange alternative telegraphic communication within the period of two years, I am to state that my Company, while anxious to meet the views of the Persian Government, cannot accept the indefinite llahility to maintain the Cable Station at Jask which is implied in the Persian Government's reply. It is considered that a period of two years is more than sufficient for the establishment of an inland telegraph connection, but should the Persian Administration meet with unforeseen lel &gt; Esq,., C.M.G. , dgn Office, London, s.W.l.unforeseen difficulties my Company is prepared to discuss the matter when the time approaches, Mjr Company is pleased to note that instructions have been given permitting the re-exportation of surplus stores and apparatus. The question of the export of arms, however, does not arise in so far as the Company is concerned. It is noted that the communication from the Persian Government contains no reference to the continuance of my Company’s operations at Bushire or to the carrying out of the remainder of the programme for reorganisation of the cable system in the Persian Gulf, with which is included the withdrawal from Charbar, In view, however, of the exchange of views at the Foreign Office yesterday morning, my Company is prepared to accept the Persian Government’s note as implying consent to the Company remaining at Bushire and proceeding with the remainder of the programme of reorganisation and has decided not to press for a categorical statement on these points.

Contrary to expectations the landline connections on the Island appear to be intact but both the submarine cable connections are broken. The Kishm cable is broken about one mile from Bunder Abbas and the Henjam section about midway between the islands. Should the Iranian Government so desire, the repairs could be effected by the C.S.'Lady Denison-Pender” after she has completed the work at Bahrein Island. The ship has now completed the repairs to the Fao-Bushire cables and is proceeding to Bahrein in order to start work on the Bahrein-Bushire cable connection. Perhaps you would inform me whether the British Minister at Tehran has succeeded in smoothing the way for our withdrawal from Hen jam and Charbar as the ship will proceed to the former place as soon as she has finished her work at Bahrein.

Captain Lawson of Cable and Wireless Limited rang me un rts afternoon to say that he had received my letter of October ,th (E 6062), and that it correctly represented the position. 2 . He feared, however, that his Company would not be able to tain a final decision about Jask for some days longer. He ’sonally felt confident that there would be no difficulty, but j air companies wished to consult their Boards and would not be ,e to let Cable and Wireless have their answer until the end of s week. Would this be all right? . I replied that I did not think that this slight further ay would matter very much now that the Cable ship was being Lected for other work and that the question of the evacuation Task was therefore no longer one of immediate urgency, lover, we had now told the Persians that we were hoping that heme might be devised to meet their desiderata , so that ously a few days further delay would be intelligible. Captain on promised to telephone to me as soon as a decision was hed. Captain Lawson then told me that the Cable ship had shed the work of deflecting the Karachi cable to Muscat and i now repair the Jask cahle, which had been in bad condition two years. I gathered from this that his Company feel pretty Ldent that Jask will remain open. Captain Lawson then asked me my opinion on the question en^aa.

Captain Lawson said that he srsonally agreed with my view and did not think it necessary la t the Minister should he consulted. Henjam win, therefore, t he evacuated until the Jask question has been settled. 6. Captain Lawson also referred to the proposed survey of 8 land line to Henjam. He was not certain whether the Persian rernment had been told of the Company’s proposal. I said that ;hought that nothing had yet been said to the Persians on this nt, since we had been waiting to deal with the whole matter il a decision had been reached on the major question of Jask. tain Lawson explained that the original intention had been t the ship should carry out the survey on her first visit to jam and pay a second visit later for the purpose of doing any jssary repair work. I gathered, however, that it would be ;e easy to put all this off, and we agreed that it would be ;er to do nothing for the present. (Sgd. ) G.W.

THE CHAIRMAN pointed out that in the letter from 3 aole and wireless they asked for advice on matters likely to affect the Company’s system of communications in the Light of the present international situation, and they also ,ffered their services to His Majesty’s Government. it id not appear to him that there was anything at the present tage which the Committee could tell Cable -nd Wireless. COL CHEL TRENCH raised the question of the alternative outes by which they would carry their traffico He was not Itogeoher certain whether the round Africa route would be iequateo MRo PHILLIPS thought that Cable and Wireless’ letter idicated that they could carry all the traffic without the 56 Mediterranean cables by a combination of alternative Cole routes and wireless. CAPTAIN HALL I PAX thought that the genesis of the letter iS ^ le fcnr of the Cable and Wireless as to the vulnerability ■ the Mediterranean cables. In reply to the Chairman ? he nd that the cable between Gibraltar and Malta was vulnerable, lu -1 was possible that the Italians could cut it. It was 5tj 00 vu lnerable between Malta and Egypt. cd. ROBINSON raised the question of whether the Sub- ^ittee were to accept the Company’s statement that they '° Uld carr&gt; y the traffic on alternative routes or whether we not to ask for further particulars. MM PHILLIPS said that the Post Office had no special e this point They knew, however, that there was -1-a large spare capacity on the alternative routes if wireless and cables were taken in conjunction. in reply to the Chairman CAPTAIN HALLIPAX anticipated a considerable increase in traffic from the Naval point of view in the event of a warn COLCNEl TRENCH pointed out that an Increase in the wireless capacity was not a substitute for a reduction in cable capacity. THE CHAIRMAN pointed out that wireless must be held to be not safe for secret strategical information. Seme discussion followed as to the correct method of approaching Cable and wireless Limited. CONCLUSION S., IT WAS AGREED:~ (a) that Cable and Wireless nimited should be invited to inform the Committee of Imperial Defence how they would propose to carry the traffic by alternative routes in the event of the Mediterranean cable route being closed 9 and to what extent they would contemplate the use of wireless. (b) that the Joint Secretaries should draft a letter to Cable and Wireless.Limited for consideration by the Imperial Com munications Committee pjrior to its reference to the Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence for signature.

He felt, howtwer, possible that Australia was angling to get the agrenneuo the United Kingdom on strategical grounds m oraei the coula then suggest the possibility of the United Kingdom contributing towards the cost.CAPTAM thought there was probably a certain amount of jealousy between the Navy Department and the Post Office in Australia and it was perhaps for that reason that the Navy Department had referred the matter to the Imperial Communications Committee. Seme discussion followed as to the extent to which the commercial aspects ox tlie quescion v/ere involved, in t lie strategical aspect. m * -R0.BINS ON suggested that in the first place it would 'be advisable to obtain a report on the purely strategical aspect. In this connection VlhCr COlii'alNDiiiR SIlvil^SOiT pointed out that there was no information in the papers dealin c , witn the air aspect of the question. CONCLUSIONS o IT LAS AGrRELD:- (a) that the proposals for the erection of Naval wireless stations in Australia should^ in the first instance s be referred to the Wireless Board with the request that they would report on the purely strategical aspect of the problem. (b) that on receipt of the report from the Wire- less Board the Imperial Communications Committee should consider the further step of setting up a Sub-Committee* possibly with a representative from the High Commissioner for Australia's office* to consider the broader aspects of the problem* including the commercial questions involved. 4 ‘ SV 10 SEBVIGD feZTfeDN ADEN AND ADDIS ABABA.

We do not iticipate that any more land will be required as that in present cupation of the Coa^any should be more than sufficient to meet r requirements. It is noted from your letter of the 12th instant that the Itan of Muscat has no objection to the proposed alterations in gard to the cables landing at Muscat and I have pleasure in •pending herewith a brief outline of the contemplated alterations that place» for communication to the Sultan. You will note ‘oin the tentative programme that the ship will call at Muscat rst in order to pick up a letter containing the fullest istructions, which is being sent hy air mail today, and in idition we will instruct the Commander of the ship to call on to Political Agent and explain to him in detail exactly what it 8 proposed to do after having examined the landing place and the in of the cables at Muscat. Warding the withdrawal from Persian territory at Jask, Tartar and Hen jam as covered in the enclosed program*:, my c &lt;®pany would be glad if His Majesty’s Government could take any ^Uon which may facilitate the entrance and departure oi the ^ at these points and for the embarking of instruments, stores2 . and staff which it may be necessary to transport for u - Muscat and Bahrein# It is noted that the Persian Government have made enquiries regarding the purchase of the wireless installations at Hen jam, &lt;ingah and Bushire. My Company has no claim on the material com- irising the wireless installations at Henjam and Lingah, which re of spark transmission type and therefore not in a position to e used for wireless transmission# However, ny Company would be eluctant to see these stations pass into the hands of the Persian jvernment and would prefer that they should be dismantled. As jg&amp;rds Bushire wireless station the apparatus at present in use is been manufactured locally by our own staff in order to enable Hmunication to be carried on on a continuous wave since the &gt;ark apparatus became obsolete. As stipulated in your letter of ie 13th June, 1935, wireless communication at Bushire will be intained until the reorganisation of the cable system has been mpleted, and it is possible that it might be found advantageous continue using this station for a further period so long as the isting temporary apparatus continues to function with reasonable ficlency, but in any case ny Compary would be reluctant to see is station pass into the hands of the Persian Government or any her party, more especially as the land and buildings coiiprising e wireless station are on the same site as the cable station. May I again refer to your letter of the 13th June in connec- with the reference in the last paragraph to the disposal of ie landline at present operated by ny Conpany in Persian territory. Maps you would be so good as to inform me whether this line is ) be handed over to the Persian Government, subject to the strict ion referred to in ny letter of the 18th June, 1935. As regards the general programme of procedure, it is antic- Lpated that the Cable Ship tt Lady Denison-Pender” should arrive to Muscat on or about October 1st to pick up the letter of lll structions which is being forwarded there by air mail. At the ^ time the ship will survey the landing place for the cables3. and the Commander will be instructed to get into touch with the political Agent at Muscat. Operations^ at_Muscat.

When tne alterations are completed Muscat will be in direct degraphic communication with Karachi on the one side and Bushire i the other side, which should prove of considerable advantage i the Government and the commercial comnunity at Muscat.

The existing cable ana wireless » comnunicat ions in the Gulf a re show on the map fiaggl The evacuation of Henjam brought up the question of the future of the wireless ana cable station there, and representatives of the Company were interviewed on 27th March 1935 with a view to a decision on this (see note of conversation on P.z. 2209/35 flagged). The company subsequently formally proposed (p.z.2265/35 flagged) a general reorganisation of the Gulf cable system, the effect of which woula be to close down the cable stations at Jask, Charbar ana Henjam, and to remove the cable from Persian territory, save at Bushire, where it would connect with the main Persian landline* A subsidiary proposal was for the laying of a cable from Bushire to Bahrein, this cable in all probability to be linked up with one of the existing cables outside Persian territorial waters. A powerful wireless station would simultaneously be installed at Bahrein* The Company suggested that all the material requirements of H.M*G. so far as communications were concerned would be amply satisfied by an arrangements on these lines, which they had apparently elaborated before the matter was broached with them consequent on the proposed evacuation of Henjam. They raised, however, the question whether some compensation should W- L, not be paid to them in respect of the value of the sites Of tile telegraph stations in Persia, to which teey-bast ho title/, but which had been valuea among the assets transferred at the time of the sale of the I.2.T.D. to I.C. at some £ 20 , 000 . 2. The matter was considered in the Communications Committee of the C.I.D. on 9th ^pril (minutei s H(minutes flagged), when the conclusion was reached that subject to reference to the Government of India and to their concurrence and to certadn minor reservations, there would he advantage in accepting the Company’s proposals. The Resident has since expressed his concurrence in those proposals and the Government of India have now equally intimated that they approve them (telegram of 16th May , P «Z. 3369/35). 3 . m these circumstances we may go ahead. The procedure is somewhat involved. I understand from discussion with Commander Clarke at the C.I.D. and Mr. F.p. Robinson at the Treasury that the right course will be that the India Office should write to Cable and Wireless Ltd., either privately or officially, conveying a reply to their proposals on the lines approved by the C.I.D.; making it clear that no compensation would be paid; and suggesting that the Company should refer the matter for consideration to th Imperial Communications Advisory Committee, on which H.M.u, are represented, on receipt of a reference from the company the matter would be considered by the advisory Committee, who (the Government representative having previously received a copy of the India Office letter to the Company and so knowing what the attitude the Government was) would intimate concurrence.

I am to say, however, that H.M.G. and the G.of I. would be unable to agree to the payment of any compensation to the Company in respect of the matters referred to in the last paragraph of your letter in* question. The Secretary of State understands that the reorganisation will result in a not unimportant yearly saving to the Company which can be set against any immediate loss involved in the surrender of the sites in question. Apart from that, the Company, in the event of reorganisation, may be saved a heavy \ annual/Department. ^ Of annual payment aue to t he Government Inoia i or the maintenance of wire by land-line from Karachi to the Persian frontier. 3- The reservations which H.M.G. would desire to make are as follows (a) that the W/T communication at Bushire should be maintained until the reorganisation of the cable system has been completed; (b) that if the Persian Government, on being informed of the proposed closing of the stations at Henjam, Jask and Gharbar, were for any reason to press for a simultaneous closing of the cable i station at Bushire, the question would require further consideration. 4. The Secretary of State would be glad if further particulars could be supplied to H.M.G. as to the arrangements contemplated for the proposed cable communication between Bushire and Bahrein. The Company will be familiar with the claims which have been put forward by the Persian Government to certain rights in Bahrein While those claims are not and never have been recognised in any way by H.M.G., the fact of their existence makes it necessary to treat this aspect of the matter with some care. The Secretary of State for his part would be disposed to suggest that the simplest course would be that, if there/Paper.

To place the question beyond doubt it would seem advisable that if the suggestion now made is technically practicable the point of junction should be some distance outside the 12 mile limit. 5. In the event of the proposals being approved by the Imperial Communications Advisory Committee, it is considered that, before any action is taken to give effect to the reorganisation under discussion, a communication should be addressed to the Persian Govt, by H.M.

W, 1 » 53 nd May, 1935 My dear Baggallay, X axn sorry to have teen so long in commentin on your letters of 18th April, £.2470/^174/65, and 11th May, E. sbo9/isl74/oo, to laiatohtull-Hugessen, about the proposed closing or the cable stations at Hen jam, Jask and Chart)ar. The Government or India’s observations on the question have now, of course, been received (copies were sent to you and Admiralty, and Commander Clarke at the Committee of Imperial Defence, under our printed letter P.Z. 5369/35 of the 17th May) and we shall be consulting the interested Departments further in the light of them. But it may be convenient that I should deal at once with certain . point s arising out of your two letters to Tehran. 3. As regards the point discussed in paragraph 3 of your letter of 18th April, I think we have throughout made it clear that the retention of the Bush ire station link is in our opinion probably on a broad view of considerable importance to Persia and that it is, in iacu, i^gallay, Esq., sign Office, S . ii . 1 * COPY SENT BY AIR MAfl. of 2 4 MAY 1935 AAJPthe station which really matters, proposing to close clown Bushire and Char oar a Pei si an pxotest might certainly have D-en expected, I do not think there is the same risk in adopting the proposals now under consideration. 3 . As regards the point dealt with in paragraph 5 of your letter ox 13th April. I warned the Company at our discussions on this point that it would he necessary to walk rather carefully as regards the proposed new cable to Bahrein. I gather (though this is subject to confirmation and I am not sure that they have themselves taken any decision) that what in fact they would probably do would be to link Bahrein with one of the two existing Fao-Bushire cables outside Persian Territorial Waters, and this would, of course, avoid the difficulties which would almost certainly arise with the Persians if we were to start to lay a new caole direct from Bushire through Persian Territoi ial ivatmo to Bunrein. 4. If our view is correct that serious difficult,) is perhaps unlikely to arise with rex si a ovei , , • __ + i q hardly necessary retention of the Busnire station, it i to/to examine in great detail the position under Article 4 of the Telegraph Agreement of 17th February, 1932 , 0 general view here is, however, very much that of the Government of India, that having regard to the pifrnis sive character of the drafting of Article 4(1) it i s not easy to see tnat the Company could he regarded as be inn hound by an obligation to Persia to maintain land communication with Jask and with Charbar, though we recognise the force of the counter arguments referred to in your letters to Tehran. 5. As regards compensation to the Company, the new argument advanced by the Government of India in paragraph 2 of their telegram of 16th May is directly relevant. So far as disposal of the sites of their stations is concerned we will await Tehran 1 s comments on the observations in your letters of 18th April and 11th May; though we should, I think, agree that it would save much trouble if the Company were willing, without anj compensation from us, to hand over their irremovable property at Hen jam, Jask and Charbar to the Persians. 6 . On a minor point of detail, the statement in paragraph/4. paragraph. 14 of your letter of 18th April that the Government of India had approved the scheme was, of course, an am-icipaoiOii, though they have in fact now formally expressed agreement in it.

LACY DmGGALLAY./2174/65) The use of Hen.lam for a Cable station was granted by the Persian Government on March ii9th 1868. The permission was in the form of a minute by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs approving a memorandum of the requirements of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the station, the said memorandum being accompanied by a sketch map of a telegraph station on another Island - the island of Ashowade x (see 'precis of correspondence relating to the .British positions on Basidu and Hen jam” - 1927 - E 1199/245/34 (1927) page 25). Whatever the original grant may have meant, considerable doubt existed in 1905 both as to the area of the station and the rights of the Indo-European Telegraph I apartment within that area (see 'Precis' pages 69 - 75 ,; particularly paragraphs 30 (sub-paragraph 7 of Sir Percy Cox’s letter), 40, 44 and 50). The upshot was that His Majesty's Government failed to establi definite rights over any given area to the extent of oeint to exclude th© Persian Government or Persian subjects erecting buildings or residing within that area. 44, on page 73, a comparison is drawn with the Jas* Station (see next paragraph). • -teak were fixed by an The limits of the station at d . ^ nwn signed on February 25, Agreement, with an accompanying sap* * £i 1887 and modified in an unimportant particular tr , yr tt (5th Edition) *hat year (Aitohison's treaties. I Page 191 or ^collection of Telegraph U 1 1915” / page 1 cannot trace this, perhaps ^Iphinstone Inlet is meant. ^legraphs island inpage 28). This agreement simply stated that it bad be .n decided that the boundaries *ere such and such and thrall Persian buildings must be placed outside these limits. There is no record of anv y -peoial agreement about the Charbar station. It was originally a land telegraph station, similar to dozens of others throughout Persia. It exl8ted ^ virtue of an agreement signed on April 2 , lese (Altehlson, page 18S or 'Colleotion' page U) by whloll tlla Sovernment allowed His Majesty's Government to establish a telegraph line from Gwadnr to a point between jesk and dundar Abbas, and undertook to give their 'good offices and authority for its construction, maintenance and protection”# There Is no mention of individual stations and no provision for the acquisition of any lands or buildings which might be required for such stations. The station was probably pitched on a piece of previously empty desert, so that the question of title deeds in the ordinary sense would not arise. In this connexion Article 2 of the Telegraphs Agreement of 1932 is instructive, dy that article all the ’constructions-telegraphiques” belonging to the Indo-European Telegraph Department were handed over to the Persian Government, *'ith the exception of their property in the large towns. It sse&amp;s that these properties, which the Department insisted on be ing allowed to sell, had been acquired by them in the ordinary from private owners, and it is possible that the outlying stations, which were handed over to the Persian v^rnai? v, ar Aground on which the department had simply ”squattea !f . .-e 2 orrespondence of the period expressly states that the ere 10 title-deeds for three of the out-lying stations ^ tloned Article i.e. sivand, Dashtardjin and xonartakhteh, and ^le either for these or for a fourth, Dahaneh ( 01 j Baghi)«2655/2174/65) : i . PO p™ OFFICE, S.w.l. 3rd May, 1935 , My dear Laithwaite, . In our letter E 3655/2174/65 of the 27th April we sent you a copy of a telegram from Tehran stating that the Persian Government had asked if they might purchase the wireless installations at Henjam, Lingah and Bushire. The 'installation' which is being removed at Henjam is presumably the home-made sending and receiving set of Cable and Wireless, Limited, which is probably being dismantled, I fancy the word ‘♦installations' at the end of the paragraph is meant in a very general sense. 2. This is a question upon which the Government of India, as the owners of the stations, will doubtless telegraph their observations in due course, but in the meanwhile it may be useful if I set down the following tentative and purely provisional views which we have formed after a preliminary study of the proposal. *aite, Esq. , C.I.E. ' SENT BY AtR MAIL Wl/si' C / ■ i 0MAYJ935It -.r, r. 3 . on general principles, we think u would ^ ^ good thing to meet the Persians over this proposal as far ss w© conveniently cen* it is tT*np +v&gt;«-» + true that we once proposed to hand over the station at Henjam and the material of the stations at Bushire and Lingah to the Persians as a part of the settlement embodied in the General Treaty. But the stations are never likely to he bargaining pawns of any value in future political negotiations and if we can dispose of them to the Persians on a purely commercial basis, there seems to be every advantage in doing so. Unless they are disposed of* somehow they will grow into white elephants, seeing that it would be very expensive to remove them, even if the Persians would allow it; and an accommodating attitude over this proposal may help to mollify any resentment which the Persians may conceivably feel over the cable reorganisation. 4. There are, however, as we well realise, certain obstacles to be overcome, notably the fact that the actual receiving and sending sets at Bushire and Hen jam appear to he (a) the property of Cable and Wireless Limited (b) valueless commercially and (c) obsolete, and that thestation at Bushire cannot the cable station without bS Worked independently of great inconvenience to the company. Our suggestions. (p Ure iy tentative and provisional, as I have said before) would therefore be on the following lines: 5. As regards Lingah, there &amp; &gt; wxcxe is no reason, so far as we can see, why His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran should not offer it to the Persians at any time and at any price which the Government of India think fair and reasonable. 6 . As regards Henjam, the Minister might tell the Persians that if they care to buy the masts etc., at such and such a price (to be indicated by the Government of India) the Government of India will be prepared to sell, but that the sending and receiving apparatus is not only the property of Cable and Wireless, Limited, but obsolete under the latest international regulations; if the Persians want it they should apply to the company, but they would probably do better to buy up-to-date material elsewhere. 7. As regards Bushire, His Majesty’s Minister might explain that for various reasons it would be impracticable/impracticable for the Persian authoriti + -J-i'ies to work the wireless station while the company were working the cable station, hut that if they cared to buy the masts and other material and use it elsewhere, the Government would he prepared to sell it at such and such a price; he would then add the same explanation about the sending and receiving apparatus being the property of the company and obsolete as in the case of the station at Henoam. 8 . It will be desirable to postpone any reply, at any rate about Hen jam and Bushire, until His Majesty’s Minister announces the impending closure of the Henjam cable station and the Bushire wireless station.KH/Air, 1 secret (39 groups) 2242. £ ' S - g ~ 2 -^ JLJ ^~g-!~I_g I, K G R &gt; „ (COPISS India.

The aspect© of the scheme which to concern the Foreign Office and the Legation (a) the reactions of the Persian Ooverment. (b) the disposal of the land and buildings at Hen Jam Jash and Gharhar* 4* As regards (a), the Persian OoTemaent may not uind the closing of the station at Henjara, since they will still he able to eorrhmic&amp;te with Hen jam through hmaer fbb&amp;s. But the stations at Jesk end Charhar are their sole existing means of cmmunieati^ with the south-east of Persia, where they are, as we know, having trouble with rebel chieftain®, brigands etc. If these two stations are closed, one of the main benefits which they derive from having the cable stations on ■. e*sian soli will disappear. It la therefore possible that when they hear what is going to happen they nay at the^ ifi which %&amp; male® altermativ® g^sagjBB&amp;nta and at the worst raise objections to the ^ainteiMince or the single remaining atstiem at Buahire, 5* Furthermore, the Persians ma^ feel that they cannot $ eonel s ten «# ly with the ms i ntenaBtoe of their claim to Bahrain, ae-mlese© in the existence of a direct cable connexion between Bush ire and Bahrain for #iich their permission (as th- r 'owners-' of Bahrain) has not been sought and giTea. the fact that there has for nam time hemi direct wireless comm'imication between Bush ire m&amp; Bahrain and that the Bahrain wireless station hm been run by Cable and Wireless Limited may have escaped their notice and would in any case be unlikely to reconcile them to the existence of the cable. 6 , W$ mist therefore face the possibility that the Persian Goveriment nay be piqued at the in ten ©ranee ^ith their military ccenmunications m&amp; at the cable connexion with Mhrain and that they may in consequence conceivably sake difficult!., about l«tting the «xisting station re^in at Buohire.

If the Persian Gowernaent were for the reaeone giren above or for any other reason to try to get rid ef the Buohire atatioa, the position which would arise ander the Telegraphs agreement of the l*?th February, i 93 i ia somewhat obaeure. Article 4(1) of this ngreenent states that the ersian Oovern-nent peradttra h ^ a ^ n t. * •. *, ^ nominated by Hie Majesty’s f/overn^ent (and the Government of India) to operate the cable office 1945* it does not say that Hie Majesty*® Swarnment mxmt operate them.

Persian territory. The strength of these and any similar argument® which the Persians light bring forward could only be tested on practical grounds, e*g, by considering the extent of the darmge to their interests which they could show to be actually entailed by the closing of the stations, 3. 4m have discussed with the other departments concerned, and particularly with the India office, the possibility that the Persians may object to the retention of the Bushire station. It has been agreed that there are no strategical objections to the disappearance/diaapixMraaee of this station, but *w * ut that *• ahoula bo reluctant to oonts^mts it, if ^ of ^ Politiesl Seal dent* a eofaualcati»,« l! » a«ition the eoapaay hare a strong eomeroiai interest in it . reteution, as the great bulk of their Persian J, 8arcs&gt; ehieh are worth some 7.000 a year, p„ e thPough u&gt; whereas only about two aessages in three days pas* through Jaak sad Oharbar.

The other question which my concern the legation is the eosp^rijr ? m imoveable property at Ksnjem, Jask and Chnrbur. The following are briefly the circismstances. 10* So far as we know, the Indo European Telegraph Department were never given nny title-deeds for the ground on ^hieh the three stations stand* fht legation sre already familiar with the position of the Jaek concession/eOT „.,.lo» nam ^ ^ M .l .f &lt;M l.t i—7). *, „„j„ , wls- indicated an area within which - 4 ' gra '-“ Gildings mirM fee put up (M« Lorimer ;o lus « i PM .

It wm®, made ouite clear to them at the time that no title-deeds for the lend and buildings at these stations could he produced. II# the company hare now asked His 'Majesty's Government (as you will see from their letter of the 29th larch) whether they can expect any compensation for the assets/assets they are abandoning.

There is clearly no reason why His Majesty’s Government should compensate the company for following their own corcnereial interests, even though Hi a Majesty’s Government do in fact approve of the closing of the stations.

ME. BAGGALLAY said that the Foreign Office were entirely n favour of the re-arrangement, but would like to draw the ttention of the committee to one possibility in connexion herewith. At present there were four cable stations “Persian territory, at Bushire, Henjam, Jasknew and. Charbar. Linder the new -nr&gt;^ new proposals on i y that &amp;t Bushire would remain. The Versions might not • gIiG n °t mind the closing of the station at Heniam +, njam, as they could still communicate with Henjam through Barn»„ 8 bandar Abbas. But the stations at aask and Oharbar were their 1 sole existing means of communication with the south-east nr ^ • east of p er . sia) where they were having t. ouble with rebel chieftairo v ouieitains, brigands etc. If those stations were closed, the main benefit which they derived from having the cable stations on Persian territory would disappear, and they might make difficulties about letting the single station at Bushire remain. They were not dependent on this station for communication with the outer world. ? as they had the Pahlevi radio at Tehran and the land-line to Baghdad 0 The legal position under the Telegraphs Agreement of 1932 was obscure, but if the Persians v/ere to claim that the article in the Agreement which gave His Majesty f s Government the right to maintain certain cable stations must be read as a whole and that consequently if His Majesty’s Government did not maintain all four stations they could maintain none, the point would at least he an '’arguable 1 ’ one. The Foreign Office did not for a moment wish to hold up the scheme on account of this possibility, but they would welcome a declaration that, from a strategical point of view there would be no ©ejection if all argument failed and in the last resort, to havi g no cable landing at Bushire. THE CHAIRMAN asked what the Services view was egarding the importance of retaining a cable conn r ith Bushire. COMMANDER DANGERFIELD said the Admiralty would like 'he retention of that station in order to provide ^mmunication with the Political Res''MR. LAITHWAIT5 said that both tho n DOXa the Company and the Indi a Office would he very reluctant to see the discontinuance of the Bushire link. Its retention was important to His Majesty’s Government because of the , -eoiaenu s communications* So far as the Company were concerned the Persians were anxious to have a land-line communication with India, end Calls and Gir^leoo, Lcci, , were naturally opposed to this He felt that as long as the Bushire contact existed there was a good answer go any Persian proposals for a land-line* The Bushire link, moreover, was of particular value to the Company as the great bulk of Persian communications (worth some £7,000 a year) passed through this station, only some three messages in two days going through Jask and Charhar, He was doubtful in these circumstances whether Persia would wish to face the inconvenience involved in closing down Bushire* at any rate while her W/T stations in the Gulf were still in the future* he suggested that if Persia did wish to turn the Company out of Bushire it would raise a new situation which should be considered at the time when the Persians’ intentions became known. In answer to a question by the Chairman it was explained that as soon as, hut not before, tne Company were ready to put the changes into exfeet, ana Ills Government and the Government of India deciaea u 0 them, the procedure with the Persians ^oulc, the Persian Government of the changes contemplated, the v, v •.nrr riven o'enerally as one reason for these changes being g iv economy, T , , ^ t +he examination of the position It was agreed that one e. which would arise if the Persians oljectea to tn + rnohire should be re tent ion of the cable station a— ^ postponed on til tliis po ss il ]_ li iv occurrod iiuv. Li-iIxit^AITi, then raised the question of financial compensation, The Company had put foward the contention that they would be involved in p, loss apparently of about £20 ? 000 - the present-day value of the stations to be evacuated which they had taken out without title deeds from the I.E.T.D., and had said they would be glad to have the consideration of the Government in this matter. He pointed out that they would apparently be saving about £4*000 a year by their re-arrangement, and further, he did not think they could plead that these changes were being forced upon them on strategical grounds. It was evident that the Company had worked out their complete plan for the re-arrangement before the India Office had approached them regarding the evacuation of Hen jam* MR. ROBINSON said this had raised the poinu on which he would like precise ins true cions. necessary for him, as the Treasury repreoentative, . . ~ Tmnerial Communications communicate the decisions 01 tne mp^ Committee to the Imperial Communications Advi Committee.

MR.

GABLE LANDING LI CENCES IN THE IRISH FREE S T ATE . (I* C.C. Paper 1613,) MR. PHILLIPS said the Post Office had examined the draft Sicences in detail and he was anxious to draw the Committee’s attention to one point. These licences purported to giv \merican Companies the right to carry Anglo-European traffic, le explained this by saying that at the present moment the American Companies in England could not accept in nessages for Europe, Under the Irish Free State licences q irnqh Free State would be American cable stations in the Iris + _ p . the united Kingdom to Europe, authorised to carry traffic fno, a-p those Companies did so, THE CHAIRMAN asked whether, i contracts with the United they would then be breaking t Kingdom. , x 1 .q 11 y at this moment those MR.

ME. PHILLIPS suggested that perhaps there would be no harm in stating our own position only to the Irish Free State THE CHA.IRMA.N thought one way of dealing with it would be for the British Representative on the I.C.A.C. to talk privately to the Irish Free State representative on that Committee. This means would not invite a rebuff, as possibly would be the case if the mat ter was put officially to the I,C*A C Alternatively, it might do good if the Dominions Office informally discussed the question with the High Commissioner for the Irish Free State. MR. PRICE agreed that this would be one method of attacking the question. The matter would, of course, have to be submitted to the Secretary of State. MR. ROBINSON questioned what would be the effect on the United States if, at this stage, altera.tions of the nature envisaged were made in the draft licences. MR, PHILLIES said that no secret had been made to America of the fact that the United Kingdom could not see its way to give licences at present. In reply to a question by Mr. Price, he said he thought that the Irish Free State had acted on their own initiative in proposing these licences, though it was possible that they . ■ -f*-i r*c! + -ni ace by the American ftay have been asked for m the fi P Companies. 1 the more informal the discussions THE CHAIRMAN said that the + hp better it would be, with the Irish Free State were, Hp that it was not a matter to bring was inclined to agree that n I.C.A.C. into off - 11 - *CONCLUSIONS.

COMMANDER DANSERFIELD said the Admiralty would like ulie re uention of that soation in order to provide corniTiunication with the Political Resident. MR. LAiTHWAITE said that both the India Office would be Company and the very reluctant to see the dis continuance of the Bushire link. The Persians were anxious to have a land-line communication with India, and Cable and Wireless, Ltd., were naturally opposed to this. He felt that as long as tne Bushire contact existed there was a good answer to any Persian proposals for a land-line. The Bushire linkfwas of particular value to the Company as the great hulk of Persian rAXWmAstea communications, passed through iins stauon.

These licences purported to give the American Companies the right to carry Anglo-European traffic. He explained this by saying that at tin present moment the American Companies in England could not accept in this country messages for Europe.

In reply to a question by Mr. Price ? he said he thought that the Irish Free State had acted on their own initiative in proposing these licences^ though it was possible that they nay have been asked for in the first place by the American Companies.

Prom the maps it leeks as though this would be very close indeed to the track of your cable and it is conceivable that it might be thought possible and desirable to make a call there. ’I* The second is that there is at Shargah on the Trucial Coast a station on Imperial Airways route to India. At present this station is used only by Imperial Airways but the possibility that it may be open to general use at some period in the future cannot be ruled out ? and 9 so far as we can form any judgment at this stage 9 it would not 9 I think be surprising if Shargah were in the course of time to become a really important air port.

Sir 5 Persian Gulf Telegraph Conmimications. Ity Con^any’s representatives having been informed in confidence that the British Government contemplate closing down the Naval Station at Hen jam and has suggested that the wireless and submarine telegraph station at Henjam at present administered by my Company as agents in Persia of His Majesty's Government should be closed, it is desired to submit for the consideration of His Majesty's Secretary of State for India a plan of re-organisation of the telegraph system in the Persian Gulf which, if acceptable, would cover not only the proposed withdrawal from Henjam but would generally improve the working of the telegraph system in the Gulf by providing direct commun ication between Karachi, Muscat, and Bushire, with an additional link by cable to Bahrein, where the system would be supplemented by wireless service with Aden. In the event of any temporary interruption of the cables east of R ah r ein an alternative link would be provided by the projected wireless service from Bahrein to Aden, where connection would be made with the Company s iiiain cable syst The plan which my Conpany now suomits and a,s set out accompanying map involves the following, alterat' Karachi to Jask being diverted a. The existing cable from V to Muscat. „ „ a ~ oa nrxssible certain portions ox tne T. b * Utilising as between Muscat testing cables, a direct eonneotton »uld be sale and Bushire.2. c. e provision of a new connection by cable between Busiure Bahrem, thus Unkuig the Co W ' s , lrelCss station at B^tmin to the »i, othu ^ ^ ^ ^ The t»„ existing cables befeen Ira, (p„) » a Buslll „ to be maintained. d. As regards Bahrein try Company contemplates enlarging the wireless station on the island in order to provide two additional services:- 1. With the wireless stations of the Government of Saudi- Arabia, a project which is the subject of negotiations with the Saudi Government at Jeddah at the present time. 2. Hfith a projected wireless station at Aden, in connection with which Company is at present carrying out technical experiments prior to application being made for Government sanction. The re-organisation of the cable system in the Persian Gulf is independent of the Aden-Bahrein wireless project except in so far, as has already been mentioned, that the latter will provide an alternative route in the event of interruption of the cables. It is proposed that the wireless station at Bushire should be closed as well as that at Hen jam. It will be recalled that when these stations were handed over to my Conpany lor adminis- tration they were only equipped with 'spark transmission' which, by reason of Article 7 (8(4)) of the General Radio Comnunication Regulations drawn up at the Madrid Conference in 1932, they veie forbidden to operate as from the 1st January, 1935. Furthermore owing to the embargo placed by the Persian Government on the import of wireless material it has only been possible ry^ Conpany to maintain a precarious wireless service by '*=- r!S of locally constructed continuous wave transmitters. It is also proposed that the cable branches at Jask and Cnarbar should oe . i inriline between Jask-Charbar and closed and that the Company s landii the Baluchistan frontier should be dismantled. /.3 My Company estimates that the proposed alterations to the of official sanction having been obtained. If the above proposals meet with the approval of His Majesty's Secretary of State for India ny Company would be he approval of His ny Company would be glad to have the assistance of His Majesty's Government in obtaining sucn permits as may be necessary from the authorities at Muscat and Bahrein. In conclusion Company begs to submit that at the appropriate time consideration should be given to the fact that the Company will be relinquishing certain fixed assets in Persian territory to which the Government was not able to furnish any title deeds at the time when these assets were transferred to the Company.

Sir Norman Leslie and Captain Lawson, of CaLle and wireless, called dy appointment on 27th iv&amp;rch to discuss the future of the Henjarn wireless station. 2. I explained to them, emphasising the confidential nature of this communication, the decision which had heen taken in regard to Henjam and put to them the suggestion made in the Government of India's telegram No.770 of 25th March. 3. The Company's representatives said that they had themselves independently been considering the question of the Gulf cables and had provisionally worked * out a scheme the effect of which would te to take the cable wholly out of Persia save at Bushire. under their scheme the land-line alongside the Persian Coast would disappear. The cable would run from Karachi direct to Muscat, thence round the tip of the Mussandim Peninsula to Bushire (picking up the existing cable). A separate cable would be laid from Bushire to Bahrein. The Bahrein wireless station was already being very substantially improved. An arrangement of this nature would, they thought, fully safeguard the strategic desiderata of while, since Persia would be able to make contact with the Gulf cables at Buehire, it would deprive her of an excuse for demanding tne reopening of communication with India across tie Baluchistan/ COPY SENT BY AIRMAIL By MA j U —-- n f ^r fr - 6 ^ ■Baluchistan Frontier along a Central Persian land-line. The Company estimated that the time necessary to establish the revised system suggested need not be more than two months. They were concerned, however, at tne loss which might be anticipated in connection with the disposal oi their existing land stations in Persia (Henjain, Jask and Charbar). These and the connected assets had been valued, they thought, at about £20,000 in the balance-sheet at the time of the withdrawal of the I«E*T.D« from Persia. Was there any prospect that Government would compensate them on this or any other basis? 4. I said that I could not, of course, express any final opinion on a proposal of this nature, but that prlma facie , subject to examination by the Imperial Communications committee of the committee of Imperial Defence and the Government of India, it looked as though it might have very definite advantages. I agreed that if the revised arrangement proposed would not, if approved, fake more than two months to put into operation, tne balance of advantage rested with taking no interim action at Hen jam. As for compensation, I said I saw no prospect of any compensation being paid to the Company by they would not overlook that if the land-lines were dispensed with it would save not only the cost of maintaining them, but also the amount in subsidies which at present had to be paid to the local chiefs. (Captain Lawson estimated the outgoings at about £4,000 a year). R /- 3 - m It ' was a S r eea In these circumstances that the Company l s representatives should, send to the India Office a detailed statement of their proposals, which would he considered urgently here and in India. So far as Henjam was concerned they saw no objection to the closing down of the wireless station, on the lines suggested by the Government of India. The cable station would continue to function pending a decision on the major issue referred to above. J.G. LAITHWAITE. 28th March 1935.SECRET. M. 0421/10/55.

Perplexing complication of importance is that the wireless stations and buildings,both at Henjam and Bushire, are integral part of the cable station, same power plant being used for both wireless, and cable purposes. It follows that disposal of wireless station at Henjam cannot be considered apart from the cable station, and effect of action taken at Henjam on the situation at Bush%6 must also be considered* Extremely difficult situation would arise* both at Henjam and Bushire* if Iran attempted to occupy and work wireless stations while Company are working cable station* 3® We agree with the Resident that evacuation of Henjam should foe followed by closure of cable station and diversion of oable* (? preferably) beyond territorial waters* but closure of th© cable station is probably difficult to effect immediately.SECRET iT/vm/m.. 1719 (COPIES CIRCHLASBD) pecypber From -Q-l T g L E G B A Ma Goyerrmeat of ladia, foreign and ^(“icalDepartiaent, to Secretary oi State for India.

He said that he had had a conversation on the telephone with Captain Lawson, who informed him that Cable and Wireless were hoping to obtain from the Dutch and French Air lines using Jask, a subsidy sufficient to make it worth their while to keep the Jask cable station open. f/U. Air Companies were very reluctant to lose Gable flnci WipgIgssj q.s 'fciiGy iiq.vg no confidenc© in 'tli© efficient working of a Persian Post Office. Ic is accordingly hoped to reach an agreement whereby the Company would retain their staff at Jask and keep the cable landings there, vdiich would ensure communications with Muscat and Bushire. Meanwhile, Captain Lawson informed Mr. Rendel that arrangements would be made for the cable ship to carry on with its other tasks in the Persian Gulf in the hope that before they were concluded a settlsimt would have been reached in regard to Jask. A telegram is being sent to Tehran, and a copy will be sent over to us. No action is necessary until/until ue hear fur^ner !'rom the Foreign Office or the Company. A solution of this kind would obviously he most convenient for us and would avoid the necessity of having to go to the Government of India about the land line question.^ 's note to M r . E.J. /Tamer Would you kindly refer to Laithwaxte you dated 4th April, 1935 (E. &amp; o. 2240/35) regarding cable reorganisation in the Persian Gulf? Since then the reorganisation has been approved by His Majesty's Government, and the Company are about to carry it out. It was decided to tell the Persian Government of the changes involved a short time before the reorganisation was to be carried out, and this has now been done. The Persian Government have, however, strongly urged that the reorganisation should be postponed for 18 months or two years, as the result of it will be to cut off Jask and Charbar from communication with Tehran and Persia generally. It is quite impossible at this stage (and would in any case be undesirable) to postpone reorganisation, but in order to meet the objections of the Persian Government it is proposed, after consultation with Captain Lawson of Cable and Wireless, to suggest that as an interim arrangement messages from Jask and Charbar should be transmitted over the landlines to Karachi,retransmitted thence to Bashire, and from Bushire to the Persian interior. The attached draft telegramfto India shows what is suggested. In your note of 4th April in reply to Mr. Laithwaite’s note you mentioned the probability that the Government of India would wish to dismantle the landline from Karachi to the Persian frontier as a result of the reorganisation, ihe present oroposal would involve their keeping this landline open jor probably another 18 months. i o you see any objection to the present proposal being put to the Government of India? It is desirable to meet the Persian Government as far as is possible, since there is always the possibility that they might, if they are really annoyed, turn Cable and tireless out from Bashire, which would be exceedingly unfortunate for the Company and would be inconvenient to j us. It is desired to get the telegram*out to India,- * a s there are now only a few days before the Company wish ^ to start removal operations at Jask and Charbar. 1l jLieiit. g°l 9 ggl t T-g e - r FowIe ju C f .B.E., Political. Captain li► J.C. Lav/son ? Cable and Wireless Ltd. Mr. Bacall ay said that on being informed by the Minister at Tehran of the impending cable re-organisation in the Persian Gulf which Cable and Wireless were about to undertake ? the Persian Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, whilst he seemed to have no objections to the scheme in general, had strongly urged that its operation should be postponed until the Persian Government had had time to make alternative arrangements. The Persian Minister had represented that the scheme would entail tne complete isolation of Jask and Charbar and south eastern Persia generally, and it was indeed obvious tnat it would do so, since there was at present no telegraphic connection Jask and Bunder Abbas. The Minister h- a mentioned months as the minimum period necessary oo erect stations but he had also pres sea tor a posuponem IS m tl, a to wo yews, which wight «*» “ »»t«l.tei building- a land line from Jask to fiunaer i + h o mores si on that it Mr. Knatchbull Hugessen had gained w „ rrible Persian objections in we iailed to meet any reaoonaua-e . , .... +i-, e Persian Government regard to the cable re-organisaiion, + ■ o cable station at Bushire. n might decide to close tne CdOl ^ a ^no-o-ested thao tne Minister of Posts and Telegraphs i a Persian/Persian Government might instal their own operators at Ja6 lc and Charter ate v,ork the cables themselves at their own expense, but apparently he aid not realise that the Company proposed to remove the intermediate cables (i. e . Bushire-Henjam, Hanjam-Jask, Jask-Charbar) and use them for other purposes in connection with the re-or^anisation* ]aptain La\vspn pointed out that all the cables in puestion, is well 8-3 tne cable from Jask. to Karachi 5 but not the cable hom Jask to Muscat 9 had. already been interrupted for some ime. The Company had been relying on using portions of hese cables for the reorganisation but they might be prepared o part with them on terms. New cable cost about £140 a mile, :t these cables were not new by any means .and they might srhaps be sold for nearer £25 a mile. Mr. 6 agnail ay said mt in view of the present state of these cables, and the .fficulty and expense which the Persians would have in dntaining them, it would doubtless be impracticable for le Persians to use them, but, he asked whether, supposing le Persian Government took over the stations at Jask and larbar and made use of the land line to Karachi, the Company )uld agree to transmit Persian Government messages back to ishire and v ice v ersa on present terms, i.e. free of cost. , seemed probable that while the cables were down t.ns was mt was actually happening to Persian Government messages. ie Persian Government might quite possibx.y taxe the line lough they had not yet done so) that if the Company were .ble to transmit official messages free of charge, as luired by the Telegraphs Agreement, except by keeping up + thp Como any were under 5 stations at Jask and Char car, then bligation to keep up these stations. Cap tain Lawson pointed out that the present land line the Frontier to Karachi, which -went via Bela an ' run by the Indian Posts and Telegrapns Department,charged Caole and fereless a terminal charge at Karachi He did not know whether the Indian authorities stin proposed to keep up this land line. Vr rl ., 1C!r said that so far as he Knew no definite decision had been reached on the point, but the opinion had been expressed in the correspondence that no doubt the Government of India would give the line up when the cable re-organisation went through. Captain Lawson saia tnat if the Government of India agreed to waive their terminal charges on Persian Government message he had no doubt that the Company would pass these messages on to Bushire free of charge. The traffic seemed to be of very small dimensions. At present messages originating irom Char bar ani o u lib 6 d 'to about, ons ovory iwo days 5 and bhosQ iPora Jask j excluding 'those addressed bo Mu scab ? bo aboub one or bwo per day.

Mr. B agga ilay read out bhe latest telegram xrom hhran, giving blie Persian proposals an.u oiiowin^, bl*at ' r attached great importance bo maintaining cOiijuUixit,&lt;a.ti and Charbar. Henjam was less important since it couia breached fairly quickly by boat. The telegram also showed X X o -i- /that the Persian Minister of Posts and Telegraphs had mentioned the possibility of the Shah closing Bushire if cables were removed from Jaskand Charbar. Mr. Baglai lay then sup’d-aq+q^ +v, I ' Xia l 11 we could offer the Persians telegraphic communications with Jask and Charbar at present rates, and give them some assistance in regard to repairing the Hengam-Bunder Abbas cable, which had apparently been out of action for the past 12 months, we might hope that they would be satisfied and make no difficulty about Bushire. Time w as short since the re organisation was about to begin ana the Foreign Office would like to be able to reply to the Persian representations at a very early date. Captain La wson said that under present arrangements the cable ship was due to arrive at Muscat on the 9th October, after which it would spend several days turning into Muscat the already broken cable from Karachi to Jask. There was therefore about a week in hand. In view of the possible difficulties in making use of the land line to Karachi, he made the personal suggestion that an alternative ^ay of meeting the Persians would be to leave the two cables running into Jask for the time being, viz. that from Bushire md that from Muscat, instead of removing them from Jask and joining them up outside Persian waters as was intended under he reorganisation scheme. It would then be possible for he Persians to break in and use the cables for messages into uid out from Jask at stated times. At other times the line 57 Quid be plugged straight through. The Persians could employ two local operators and the Company would have 3U Pply a man of their own to supervise, -tbe rer&amp;ians b ^n be in a position to telegraph from Jask and Charbar to Muscat,Karachi and Bushire. They would not be abl be legraph from Jask to Henjam,but since the cable h^d been 3 r°ken for some time they were not in a position to do this at Mr. / present-.Mr^Baggallay then asked whether something could not he done to assist the Persians also in regard to the repair of the cable and land line between Henjam and Bunder Abbas, it seemed that the Persians were afraid of having to pay a large charter charge for the cable-ship. Would it be possible for Cable and Wireless,without altering the ship's programme, to send an engineer to look at the cable and see what was wrong with it, and then work out a schedule of repairs under which ill preliminary and incidental work could be carried out yithouf the cable-ship having to be chartered, and the chartering reduced to the actual period during which she was [efinitely needed to pick up Cable from the bed of the sea? Captain Lawson said that the last time the cable was epaired the Company in fact charged the Persians only for the ctual time spent on repairing it and that they had been ather surprised to find that the Persians thought their barge outrageous, though perhaps it might seem so to the ersians in comparison with the value of the cable. He said bat he thought the Company could do a survey of the cable f*ee of charge. It was finally agreed that,subject to iurther )nsideration by Captain Lawson in consultation with his 'Chnical advisers the following arrangements could be made ith a view to meeting the objections raised oy the iersia ^vernment in connection with the cable re-organisation (1) That the Persian Government sshould receiv line between Jask and Charbar and the Indian bich was in a good state of repair; (2) that the cable from Jask to Charbar, which nri the cable from een interrupted for the past four years a a sk to Henjam which had been down for 6 mO? 1 °ne away with; (3)that/(3) that the cable connections between Jask and Muscat and Jask and Bushire should be maintained for the time being, the cable Station at Jask being allowed to weak in at stated intervals and use the cables for messages to and from Jask; the Persians to provide their own staff, who would be assisted by an(Anglo-indian) Supervisor provided by Cable and Wireless; (4) that; the cable iroin Hen 3 am. to Bushire, which had not been working for the last three months,should also be done away with; (5) that Cable and Wireless should send an Engineer free of cost to the Persian Government to report on the Henjam-Bunder Abbas cable and land line. Captain Lawson asked how long these interim arrangements would last. Mr.Clauson suggested, and Colonel Fowle confirmed that if such arrangements were provisionally made there would be a risk that the Persians might sit tack and do nothing about providing permanent arrangements of their own between Jask and Bunder Abbas. This would have to be provided against. Mr.Baggalla y said that the interim period might perhaps be 18 months to two years. He thought the Foreign Office would not like to take too definite a line with the Persians at present on this point, but if aitei a y or so the Persians had taken no action they cou-ud, he reminded that these arrangements were only temporary a nd could not be indefinitely maintained. Captain Lawson promised to put the above prop to the Company and let Mr.Baggallay know the result the hollowing morning.own operators 'PWm that load telegraph line, which will he 9 banded over as concern, will be operated by i eraian Soverninent with their 2.
