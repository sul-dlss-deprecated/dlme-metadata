Gnnelpful attitude of Shaikh is regrettable. Present Prime Minister of Iraq has often reiterated his desire for more friendly | relations. By sending carefully selected delegates to this infer- mal conference, one of whom was known to be persona grata to the Shaikh, Iraqi Government have mad. a practical gesture of friend ship towards settlement of smuggling problem. It is well known that Shaikh and hia subjects have for many years made great profits out of contraband traffic. In view of his present attitude towards Iraqi Government and of fact that actual smugglers in most if not all cases are Iraqi subjects, it does not seem reasonable that His Majesty’s Government should inter vene with Iraqi Government every time that Shaikh cries out he is 'j hurt in connection with this profitable smuggling. I hope this consideration may be borne in mind when next incident occurs. The Shaikh cannot have it both ways. I, nevertheless, feel that, despite outwardly barren results, unis meeting has done good, thanks to the efforts of Colonel Loch to the admitted good will of the Iraqi delegates* I have dis cussed tliis matter, both with the Minister and Secretary General of foreign iffairs* Hurl Pasha is in favour of continuing the negotia tions and at the same time proposes to strengthen the police posts ?iu ■ ;,afwan and ^iibair and to exercise stricter control in Basra, where the smuggling Is organized* The Secretary General of Foreign Affairs advocates a 'gentleman’s agreement' with the Shaikh providing forxor no smuggling on the present organized scale in return for some monetary compensation. lie is certain that it is within the Shaikh's power to stop the smuggling. Here Colonel Loch's suggestion for the appointment of a British Indian Customs Controller, who would of course be in close liaison with the Iraqi Customs, seems an excellent idea. The British Director of the Iraqi Customs informs me that as Iraq loses at least £50,000 a year from Kuwaiti smuggling, Iraqi Government can afford to pay the Shaikh handsome compensation for stopping it. rhe idea of including settlement of Date Gardens case in an Iraq-Kuwaiti settlement on smuggling seems worthy of encouragement, as the more His Majesty's Government is out ol that picture the better. While Secretary General seemed favourable, I doubt whether the Iraqi Government would play up without involving His Majesty's Government, but the Date Gardens problem might well be settled about the same time as the smuggling and benefit by the existing atmosphere of good will.

WHITEHALL, S.W.1. 23rd October 1934. My dear George, We have been considering Ogilvie-Forbes 1 Saving Telegram No.35 of 1st October on the question of smuggling between Iraq and Koweit and have shown it to Fowle. After discussion with him I venture to make the following comments. 2. We quite agree that it is unfortunate that any hitch arose over the visit of the Iraqi intermediaries to Koweit and it looks as though through some error there had been failure to give the Sheikh notice sufficiently far ahead. We cannot help feeling, too, that Bagdad were at fault in sending representatives to make out and dried proposals, whereas the plan agreed on at the meeting with Fowle on 19th July had been a different one - the despatch of representatives to prepare the way for a conference by making it clear to the Sheikh that he had nothing to lose by entering into such a conference. On the other hand, as Ogilvie-Forbes sajrs, there seems reason to believe that the meeting has done some good, and from paragraph 7 of Loch’s express letter, C.293, of 27th September (copy sent to/ Rendel, Esq., CMG., FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l.l to you on 5th October under our printed letter P.Z.6183/34) it appears that the Sheikh, as a result of the visit, is prepared to accept either an informal or an official discussion of the question. 3. We feel at the same time that it is important to emphasize as regards paragraph 2 of Ogilvie-Fortes’ telegram that the Sheikh is on very strong ground legally and internationally in this question. As the Foreign Office have previously informed us the onus of suppressing smuggling cannot he regarded as resting upon him, and is essentially a matter for the Iraq Government. The incidents of which he has complained are all incidents, so far as can he judged, in which equally he has a genuine cause of complaint, and so long as he has a legitimate grievance it is of course our duty (as I think has been accepted by all the interested Departments in the discussions that have taken place) to defend his interests with Iraq. It would be impossible, for instance, to justify the shooting of Koweitis by Iraqi officials in Koweit territory merely on the ground that the reception given by the Sheikh to the delegates to the recent informal conference had been rather cool. 4. On a second point we are strongly averse (as I think the Foreign Office have been in the past) from linkingin any way the question of the date gardens with that of smuggling. They are quite separate issues and can only satisfactorily in our view be dealt with independently though, as Ogilvie“Forbes says, if it were possible to settle both in the near future this would be all to the good. 5. Copies of this letter are being sent to India and to Bushire. fours ever. GILBERT LAITBW'AITE.CONFIDENTIAL POLITICAL AGrSNCY, KUWAIT, w,-. n r&gt;OA The Snd November 1934 Lt*-Colonel H,R#P.Dickson, C.I.S., Political Agent, Kuwait; To The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bush!re Shooting of 2 Kuwait tribesmen in Kuwait territory by Iraq Preventive Police on August 4, 1954* Sir With reference to correspondence ending your Express Letter No.820-S, dated the 30th August 1934, I have the honour to report that since my return from leave I have taken considerable trouble to check the various statements connected with this incident, and I now forward one or two new and interesting facts as a result of my discussing the case with the man, Murahid al Buraihi, who was recently released by the Iraq Police* They are as follows:- (a) The men who were shot up were actually retainers of Shaikh Salim al Hamud al Subah, cousin of His Excellency the Ruler. This was confirmed on 2nd Move: iber 1934 by Shaikh Salim himself to me in presence of Mur eh id. yA# '■ (b) From this Office telegfam Ho.242, dated 28th August and para marked ' Secondly' , it might be inferred that the two men, on leaving their camp at Athaiba and Ruhail which lie just across the frontier North-West of Kuwait, proceeded direct from their to Jahara (near Kuwait) and passed a place called Raf’iyeh en route. Actually the men proceeded north in the first Instance to the wells called Raf f iyeh lying 23 miles North-West of Jebel Sanam and well in IraqA 5./ Iraq territory (Papworth's map of 1954 calls it Rafahiyah, and Million Sheet RAFAFIYA), where seme of their friends were staying* After spending one night there they left again for Jahara and Kuwait. (c) The men entered Kuwait territory slightly lest of Jebel Sanara, and when they reached a spot 15 miles inside Kuwait territory, and slightly West of a dried up lakelet called ROTHA (Papworthfs map) on the Kuwait - Basra Road, they met the two Iraqi armed Police cars which shot them up. (On the Million Sheet the spot corresponds with the n AL n of A1 Hamar ridge. (d) Although the man, Murshid al Buraihi, has been released, the camels still remain in the hands of the Iraq Police. 2. It might be asked what these two unfortunate Kuwaitis were doing in Iraq, and no doubt the Iraqi Police will suggest that they ware returning from a smuggling expedition. The reply to this is that after the Araibdar and Fiddawiyeh earn) at Ruhail and Athaiba broke up through lack of grazing, the majority of individual tents proceeded along with many Awazim tribesmen to the country lying south and South-West of the Hamar lake - These scattered over a large area in a pitiable attempt to eke ou1 an existence. 5. Close investigations since my return from leave show that very many of these unfortunate Kuwaiti and Awazim tribesmen are still South of the Hamar lake, and are quite unable to return home, let alone move their sheep, owing to the entire absence in the Northern area of Kuwait of any grazing at all. 4. It Is a melancholy fact that the late rain which fell in Kuwait in May 1954, and from which so much was hoped for, resulted in no benefit. New grass actually came up but was burned up as soon as it appeared* he result has been that K for the Bedouin famine conditions have existed throughout the j|K Summer of 1954 and still continue.3 5* So bad have conditions been that I understand from tbe Bedouin frineds that some of the Awazim and a few Kuwait Araibdar have actually crossed the Euphrates near Nasriyeh and are now West of Shatra on the Shatt al Kar* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, l/ Lt.-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait.5./ CONFIDENTIAL POLITICAL AGENCY \ No.G-291 Kuwait The 10th November 1954 From Lt.-Colonel H.R.1.Dickson, C.I.E., Political Agent, Kuwait; To The Hon 1 ble th e Polltical Resid ent in the Persian Gulf, Bush ire. Operation of Iraq Customs Launch in Kuwait territorial waters. Sir \ M I have the honour to enclose for your information translation of a letter fran His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait, No.R-4/1803, dated the 6th November 1934, to my address which speaks for itself. 2. The latter is as you soe very moderately worded, and in no way attempts to magnify a sxaall incident, into seme thing big. Indeed I have always found this to be the case when the Shaikh has thought fit to report some overt act on the part of Iraqi officials whether by land or sea. 3. In the present instance the irritating point frcm the Shaikh T s point of view, is that WARBA Island which lies immediately north of Bubiyan Island, belongs to Kuwait, and clearly the Fao launch had no right to act as it did, let alone fire on the boat or the Shaikh’s hawking party. 4. Happily no harm was done, although one must condemn the reckless firing of the launch’s crew as a stupid and mad act, seeing that those fired on were also armed and might easily have retaliated, to the disadvantage of the launch’s crew. Indeed it is a curious fact in passing, to record how ready the Iraq preventive officer’s man is with his gun. Fire is opened on the least provocation, which shows an irresponsible state of mind, to say the least of it.- 2 - The point of politioal significance in the abotr e story is of course the fact that the Iraq Customs authorities have in the past steadily denied that their hao Customs Launch ever proceeded as far as Tarha Island or beyond, as it was so small that it would be dangerous for it to go any distance from Fao* They made great play of this fact when the Shaikh accused the Launch Commander of operating in the narrows north west of Failika Island (See this Agency Report Ho.245, dated the 11th October 1933.} and again when the launch attacked and captured the two small Kuwait woodcutters r boats in the northern portion of the Khar Subiyeh (See this Agency despatch No.G-182, dated the 18th May 1934). / I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient servant Lt.-Colonel Political Agent, KuwaitTranslation of a letter No*B~4/l805 &gt; dated the 29th Bajab 1353, corresponding to the 6th Hot ember 1934, from His Sxoellenoy the Ruler of Kuwait, to the Political Agent, Kuwait« After Compliments, I have the honour to Inform you that at this time of the year ,Autumn, and with the approaching hawking season snarers/of falcons make a practice of going out into the country to catch young hawks. Some of these actually the servants of my brothers (actually cousins) Shaikhs All al Khalifa and Salim al Hamud, were camped and had set their traps on farba island (appertaining to Kuwait), On the 22nd Rajab 1353 (31,10.34) a small boat whose nakhuda was one Jasjir bin Khalil, proceeded from Kuwait to Varda Island with the following provisions for the said trappers, viz half a bag of Rice, a basket of dates, and some drinking water. As the boat, after having discharged these provisions, was anchored close in shore opposite the trappers* hut, a Fao Customs launch appeared and started firing at them from a distance of about half a mile. Six shots were discharged in all, while the launch gradually came near to them. The crew of the boat and the trappers, meanwhile, were standing up conspicuously, the latter with their hawks on their wrists, to show that they were trappers. Coming within earshot the people in the launch shouted to the men in the boat and the trappers to stand quite still and not move. They all complied. Then the launch drew quite close in, and a man from it asked the men In the boat to send him their canoe (houri), to enable him to come to their boat. Two of them went in the canoe to fetch him. He detained them alongside in their canoe, and in his launch came alongside the boat, which, he inspected. Having satisfied himself that they were servants of ours and only trappers, he left them and proceeded on his way. In drawing/In drawing your attention to the above occurrence, I would once again request you to give full consideration to these sort of outrages, which although regularly denied by the Central Government at Baghdad, are regular occurrences where the Fao Customs officials are concerned. I do not think that our sister State the Iraqi Government really knows what is going on or would approve of such acts of her servants, which are inconsistent with the rights of friendship and neighbourhood.

I am much more interested, and much less amused, to find that by misrepresentation of the facts it is insinuated that my information ms untrue or maliciously misleading. I can hardly let so unpleasant an insinuation be broadcast in official correspondonce without comment. 1 do not know why it Is represented that the armoured oars which I met were 'far removed from the straight Ku?/ait-3afwan road'. They were not: if they had teen, 1 could not have met them. They were travelling at a good pace towards Kuwait on that very road; and I met them, being myself travelling towards oafwan, at a point some four miles on the Kuwait side of the large sign-board which notifies the Xraq-Kwait boundary, lay, except for reasons of advocacy, it should be imagined rhat I should be 'vexed' or 'dissatisfied' at these, or any other, proceedings of the Iraqi forces because of the confiscation of a present of coffee, sugar an tea to the sergeant at „afwan is incomprehensible. The only person likely to be /sxed or dissatisfied was the sergeant. The present, (two pounds of coffee-beans, two loaves of sugar, and one pound of tea) was similar to those given from time to time for many years past, both by myself and other travellers on the road in return for the coffee and other courtesies given at this isolated post. In case it is next suggested that such presents were bribes, it should bo noted that customs examination took place not atnot at this post but at : ubair. The aboYs facts show that there is no justification for the adroit but baseless insinuation that I supplied incorrect information for interested motives.

Copies by Bag 16th Decamber| 1934 Sir I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch Ko.780 of Hovember 2th, 1934, re^ardii% the tension which is developing between Iraq and Kuwait over the activities ox smugglers running contraband goods into Iraq. X would at the su^e time refer to the coniid^ntial despatch ox the Honour able the olitical resident in the Persian dull on the same subject, Ho.1046-S of November 20th, 1934* 2 . X have recently had occasion to talk privately on this topic with trie Minister for : oreign irs, ana ^.r • Sievwright, the British Inspector-General of the Customs and lx else j apart- men * It has already been made clear that, rightly or wrongly, the Iraqi Government regard Kuwait as a base for organised smuggling and there is no doubt that tli« obduracy of the Gh&amp;ikh of Kuwait in refusing to co-operate with tiiem in any construc tive measures fox* the suppression of tnis Sixuggling - is tending to exasperate the Iraqi Gov^nx ent. They are convinced trat the Ghaikh is simply evadiiig Uie issue, and are now turning their minds towards a programme ox unilateral measures which cannot but operate to the severe aetriment ox tlie trade and commerce, licit as well as illicit, of Kuwait. These measures include the total prohibition oi imports i roi« Kuwait, the strengthening of the armed forces patrolling the land irentier of Iraq, aevex*e restrictions upon the entry into xr&amp;qi watei*s of Kuwaiti craft, and the withdrawal of ti*# valuable customs |j concessions at present extended to Kuwaiti commerce. iJi the last namea category are included the privileges oi export oi goods &gt;vm Iraq to Kuwait out of bond and under drawback free of / s Right non’bl* Sir John Simon,*3*C .G .1., etc •, etc«, etc .5- 2 - of customs and excise duty, and the concessions admissible to goods in transit, all of which privileges can be restricted or withdrawn by Government Regulations. There are a number of Iraqi officials who re advocates of extreme measures and they urge this course of action on the grounds not only of the iinaneial loos which the Iraqi Treasury is suffering because of the volume ox goods pouring into Iraq and escepin,, customs duty, but also because of the loss of prestige caused to the Iraqi Government by their failure to put an end to the activities of the law-breakers engaged in the contr-band trade• Traders in Basra and Hajaf are conq lain ng that normal trade is stagnating because of the increasing amount oX smuggled goods entering their markets. 3 * It is possible to argue that both the extent of the smuggling and tne loss to the Iraqi Government therefrom are exaggerated. A member of my staff has been given an opportunity of examining and analysing statistics prepared and collected by the Iraqi Customs department, in an endeavour to assess the actual loss caused to Iraq by smuggling from Kuwait. These figures, of which the accuracy b«s beer* checked by a reference to the published figures of Kuwaiti trade, show that the excess of imports over exports ±mmX into Kuwait, i.e. the vznue eg goods consumed in, or exported (some at least illicitly) from the Sheikhdom was as follows in each of the last three years; 1931/32 £109.047 1932/33 £150,210 1933/34 £lS&amp;,b81 It will be observed that the amount is steadily increasing* The average import into Iraq per person annually over the past three years is of a value of £l*b. 6 . The average import into Kuwait per person annually during the past three years has been as follows, assuming a figure of 60,000 inhabitants /'3~ inhabitants of Kuwait:- 1931/32 £3.16*0. 1932/33 £3.17.0. 1933/34 £4.17.0. Allowing the figure per head imported into raq as a reasonable amount for local consumption* the balance ox imports available for illicit export from Kuwait into neighbouring territories during each of the three years is:~ 1931/ 32 x2*5 * 547 1932/33 £64*710 1933/34 £99f&gt;3Bl There are so many factors which require to be taken into consideration tl*at these figures are only useful as a very rough pointer to the fact that there is a substantial quantity ol goods im, orted into Kuwait* which could be smuggled into neigiibouriiig countries in the manner alleged by the Iraqi Customs department. The pki^ority ol these excess imports are commodities on which a high fixed rate ol customs duty is charged and the customs duty on the value of the ‘’potential contraband'* would be a percentage (■f not lees than 75 . oi the value. On the other hand it is true to atat- that the otential profits from smuggling into ; ersia ana Kejd are greater than those obtainable from contraband running into Iraq and goods undoubtedly go illicitly to these countries also. Iraq* however* offers the easier and wider target and a greater prospect of success. 4 , during 1933 the Iraqi Customs aecKected 618 cases of smuggling * by land and sea* of goods which they believe to have emanated from the town of Kuwait. The value of these goods was approximately £h1,500 and the duty thereon was £8.500. during the first hull of 1934, 523 xa similar cases were detected* the goods seized being of a value os £ »* *oGO* on which tiie customs duty payable would have been £5,000. 5 . It is, of course, impossible to say with any accuracy what /-4~ what the actual loss from smug&amp;lin&amp; is, but a study of the above figures, and of other det lied facts and statistics wfcich are available, renders it difficult to refute the allegations of the Customs authorities in Iraq that (a) that less than 130,000 annually Is lost to the Iraqi Treasury and (b) the co itraband business, which is undoubtedly lucrative mien the cargo ets Uirough, is on the increase. 6 . The Iraqi authorities strongly suspect that one of the reasons for the Shaikh’s co tinned refusal to take any active steps to combat this illicit trade is that he benefits personally by a share in the handsome profits derived from it. nven if this is untrue, he probably considers that the prosperity of his State is to some extend bound up with it, especially since the decline of profits derived from the pearl fisheries began to be felt by his subjects. It is argued there!ore that unless strong and stem measures are taken by Iraq, smuggling will continue rife and unchecked at the source. The advocates of the policy of economic blockade have not yet had their way because the cooler headed Iraqi statesmen are reluctant to do anything to embarrass, or to raise difficulties vis k vis His hajesty^s Government. The continued delay in reaching any sort of agreement with the Shaikh is, however, making it more and more difficult and unless something quite definite is clone quickly, I i.ear what the advocates of a strict blocK&amp;de will shortly g-in their point. ?. In paragraph 3 of your despatch unaer reference the view is expressed that it is for the Iraqi oovernment to take the initiative in the matter oi suggesting measures of co operation in which the Shaikh might join. I woulu point out however, that the Iraqi Government have already placed two separate sets of proposals before the Shaikh lor his consideration. /'I f ' -5 ^' V A? f. v s / /p / f ca.sideration* The first scheme is described in paragraph 3 of my despatch Ho.96 of 15th February last ana was placed officially before the dhaikh, who, except for denying Uie existence of smuggling, returned merely a non-committal reply. Revised proposals were submitted to him for his consideration by the Iraqi delegates at their meeting' in September, as reported in paragr ph 4 of Colonel Loch*s express letter Ho.C.295 of 27th September last. These proposals involved (a) the application of the Iraqi customs tariii to Kuwait or (b) placing the Kuwait custo s under the consol of Iraqi oniciuls in the employ of the Shaikh of Kuwait, and limiting imports. In the event of either course being adopted, the Shaikh would be paid a reasonable amount o* compensation. 6 , It is important to note that the Iraqi delegates specifically stated that if the Shaikh aid not accept either of these suggestions the Iraqi Government hoped that he would put forward proposals ox his own for their consideration, in n^y opinion, therefore, the Iraqi Government have already taken the initiative in niakin^i proposals to the dimikii, and I submit that they cannot be expected to continue to put forward a series of alternative schemes to the Shaikh unless he at least gives seme indication of the manner in which he is disposed to co-operate . jo W* 9 . The position has been to some extent clarified by Colonel , owle*s confidential despatch ox 29th November, Ho. 1046-S, as paragraph 3 explains that the prppos *ls or the Iraqi government are totally unacceptable to the Shaikh and paragr ph 4(b) outlines measures which he is ready to rut into lorce. The Shaikh’s suggestions have been discussed semi-officially by my staxl wit|i the British advisers to Ur ministries of the Interior and finance, and the inspecuoi- General of Customs, and it bus been pointed out that Uiey have /- 6 - hav* reference only to exports from Kuwait by sea and do not toucii u on the very much larger problem of goods smuggled out by land• The measures which the Iraqi Customs Department have taken to comoat smuggling by water are resulting in the channel for contraband becoming, to &amp; much greater degree, the Inna f i xitiers ana tiie smuggling into Iraq by sea is not now to thought be very great# The Shaikh 1 ® propos Is ignore land smui, 0 ling entirely, pehha&gt;s ibr this reason. In the Inspector* General’s opinion, also, illicit sea-borne tra^ie would find if a cornyai'auively simple matter to evaae the proposed new regulations undex* the present loose coxitrol of tiie Kuwaiti customs• 10# X fully endorse Colonel owle 11 s opinion that until the Shaikh undergoes a change of heart over the question of contra band ^ti’ade a ..urther c orderence oetween him arid the Iraqi Govern ment wouli not be attended by any ads fruitful result, nor does it appear to me that aiiy satisfaction would be derived from askiiig the Iraqi Government at this stage to give ibll particulars of the manner in which they woulc propose to administer the measures suggested, the Gh&amp;ikh having already made it clear that he will have nothing to do with them# at would appear, therefore, that, once again a deadlock has baasm jra&amp;ached ana, in my view, it will only be removed by one oi two courses;- either (a) by the Iraqi Government taking matters into their own hands and instituting rigorous action such as 1 have outlined in paragraph 2 auove, or (b) by His x figest. ‘s Government actively inter vening and bringing pressure uo osar upon the Gh&amp;ikh, in his own Interests# 11 . as regards course (a), I have the honour to submit herewith /-? herewith copy of a letter from His Excellency Huri Pasha, from which it will be clear to you that the Iraqi Government desire nothing better than a working agreement with the Shaikh. They do not wish to proceed to extreme measures» His Excellency left no in no doubt, however, during a conversation which 1 held with him on December 11th, that trie Iraqi Government would not tolerate the present position indefinitely, and that, failing a satisfactory agreement with the dhaikh, they would be obliged, as a first step, to establish such a strong line of preventive customs posts along the frontier as to make smuggling virtually impossible. 12. This may ultimately prove to be the only solution or the difficulty should the Shaikh persist in his present attitude. Indeed, Judging from the enclosed extract from Kuwait Intelligence Summary tei for the first half of November, it may be deduced that the Shaikh himself would welcome such t. step by the Iraqi Government, he would, however, do well to take further thought. Given the length and nature of the frontier to be protected, the construcoion and maintenance of an adequate line of customs posts would be costly and difficult. Once established, the Iraqi Government could be relied upon to see that they got full value for their iso- ey, an d x cannot but feel that it would be the first step towards the more drastic measures outlined in paragraph 2 et seq above ending in the complete blockade of Kuwait* These apprehensions are shared by the Minister ior *©reign Aifairs, who informed me frankly that he deeply deplored the frequent occasions during the last two years on which His Majesty’s Embassy felt impelled to protest against the growing number of alleged incidents, the truth of which it was impossible, in present circumstances, to ascertain. He hinted, however, (and /- 8 - but ( aT1 d I cannot£feel that he is right), that it large numbers of preventive officials and possibly police a.«d troops are posted along the frontier, they will naturally work as near as possible to the centre c: the smuggling activity, and the number of clashes is likely to increase rather than diminish* .XX «, 1 “ “ “““•**• j the Iraqi Government to take tie contemplated step unless ana: until it is clear that no other course is feasible, and untiljj course (b) has received consideration. 13. As regards this course, the minister for Foreign Affairs appealed to me to try and persuade my Government, as the Protector of Kuwait, to arrive at an understanding with the Iraqi Government as to what sort of arrangement could reasonably fairly be put to the bh&amp;x&amp;n and then to make it clear that unless he accepted he would forfeit U*e sympathy of His Majesty's Government and could look lor no support from them in this particular matter. Given the v resent conciliatory attitude of the Iraqi Government, I feel that this appeal merits serious cous icier at ion. 14. This is a matter falling within the sphere of Kuwait’s foreign relations, for which His jetty's Govern ment are responsible* It seems to me that if His Majesty’s Government are to take up the cudgels on behalf oi the dhaikh in his dealings with foreigners, they are equally entitled to give him a clear lead when, in their view, his obduracy is such as to cause grave harm to his relations with his neighbours• 16. I would therefore suggest that Colonel : owle and Colonel Picks n be invited to come to Bagdaa at their earliest convenience, tc discuss with this i^mbassy and the British /f%) — mbavay am Urn British customs officials in Uie service of ti e Iraqi Government measures which coulc suitably be submitted to His Majesty*s Govex*rj»ent in the United Kingdom ^ or approv&lt;Al« I have reason to oeiiave tnat the Iraqi Government are not necessarily wedded to the senemas put forward in the pnst • They huve other measures in contemplation and are ready to consiuer sympathetically any reasonaole scheme, sponsored by his *«aj esty * s Government 9 which is calculated to put and end to the present situation* it would oe desiraole theretore that the Representatives oi His Majesty’s Goveniiiei*t in the Persian Gulf should come to the proposed cornereii.ce &amp;m..ed with suggestions which, in the light oi tneir personal ex r erience f are such as could fairly be put to the shaikh* It is obvious that sucn euggestioas should positive auu should not reflect tne negative and uxihelpful attitude tst hitherto adopted by the Shaikh himself* ns soon as any agreement provisionally arrived at in Bagaad receives the definite approval of his Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Iraqi Government, His Majesty’s Representatives in the Persian Gull should, I suggest, be empowered to communi cate it formally to tine Shaikh in the manner outlined in paragraph IS above, ana invite him to accept it or lace the consequences ox his continued obdui'acy • 1 U. &amp;K do mapy abortive attempts have bean made in the past to clear away this growing cause 01 serious friction between Iraq and Kuwait that it seems to me essential, px*ovided you approve of the general proposals outlined above, that the necessary instructions should bo issued without loss of time* I am most anxious that the threat of trouble which hangs over the Shaikh should be averted and that a position should not be created in which he linos himself inextricably involved /His Majesty's Goverment for help* 17. I need not add that every endeavour will be made by this embassy to arrive at practical recoBunandations which will be lair both to Iraq and Kuwait, 18* I am sanding a copy of this despatch to Hi© majesty’s Minister at Tehran and to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian bull* I have the honour to ba with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, sd.

My dear .^bassador, I wish to refer to the correspondence ending with the letter of His honour the Charge d*Affaires, ..0.642 01 20th September, -934, concerning the Kuwait conference, and have the honour to give Your excellency a summary, ae unaer, of the discussions which took place at the said conference. A. The Iraqi party stated to the Kuwaiti party the * Iraqi Government *s point of view on smuggling aJid the resultant material end moral harms, pointing out that the least of these hums was that smuggling would bread in tribesmen evil tendencies calculated to encourage them to commit prohibited acts and to continue their refractory attitude towards the laws and regulations of 'the country# The Iraqi party also pointed out tnat the Iraqi Government were able to combat smuggling but that they preferred to come to an understanding with His excellency the Shaikh for its prohibition and suppression. B« The two parties then discusseo practical measures possible of adoption for the “prohibition * 1 ('^suppression) of smuggling witnout resultant harm to tne inhabitants of Kuwait ana tribes subject to Kuwait, such as His excellency the dhaikh was anxious to avoid, and the Iraqi party suggested that the adoption of either of the following two eaxr&amp;x measures would ensure the object sought: 1# The application in Kuwait of the same custoi s tariff as that adopted in Iraq, with the guidance o* an Iraqi official whose services will be given on loan to the Government of the Shaikh. 2# The maintenance of the Kuwaiti customs tariff as at present, provided that the Kuwaiti customs administration shall be entrusted to * Iraqi officials subject to the Iraqi /- 2 - Iraqi Customs and Excise Administration• I ii^ve spoken to Your ^xcel^ency in til is connection, expressing my despair of any satisfactory understanding being reached between the two parties, and suggested to Your excellency the possibility of a settlement of this problem being reached between the British Bmbasay (acting)on behalf of Kuwait, which is protectee by the British Government, and the 1 Iraqi Govern ment, in view of the unwillingness of H^.s Excellency the dhaikh to come to an understanding with ’Iraq on a reasonable basis* ns Your excellency is aware, tills question ..as oeen dragging- for a consiueraole time, during which tha ’Iraqi Governr^ent have been suffering grave harm which is likely to increase with the delay of a settlement, 1 therefore be^ that you will be so goou as to agree to (enter into) discussions with a view to reaching a satisfactory solution for the question* Yours sincerely, (sd«) Nuri al Said.

He opined in all seriousness that Iraq's clear ana straighforw rd course was to impose a land blockade against Kuwait, if she woulu not agree to place a string of say 3 customs posts combined with strong , oints along her frontier line, fiiis was what he would like to see Sin Baud do also, but the latter had not seen eye to eye with, him on this front so xar* ,&lt;i Telegram it-27.

His Majesty’s Government agree that proposed i — —i official conference at Bagdad should be abandoned but they v —-— —■ j are anxious to explore further some intermediate course on the lines suggested in Foreign Office telegram to Bagdad referred to above before further considering action on the lines suggested in your despatch of January 8 th, Ho. 27 .S.^'|a Y\ 2. His Majesty’s Government in deference to your views and those of the Ambassador approve of proposed private visit to Bagdad if agreeable to ’Iraq Government. But they regard it as important that there should be no return visit (you will recollect the difficulties over this in 1933. See correspondence ending with Government of c . v- 7 -fv 0 ) India Demi-Official letter No .$6 of June 14th 1933 to India not Office) and they think it preferable that matter should/be raised at Bagdad until further progress has been made between Embassy and ’Iraq Government on the lines suggested in Foreign Office telegrrm to Bagdad No.47 of February 9th.2 4* Hear while they would be glad if you would telegraph your views as to Shaikh^ probable reaction to appointment in his service of (r) a British or (b) e British Indian Director Director of Customs. They attach great importance to this and feel that if Shaikh could be persuaded to agree and suitable man could be found it would greatly facilitate the future disposal of this ? difficult question. 5. His Majesty’s Government appreciate force of your arguments against involving themselves too deeply in this question. But their feeling is that it is better by taking an active interest in its disposal at this stage to avoid probability that they would be called in to cut knot at a stage when complete deadlock has been reached between parties and atmosphere was embittered, with probable unfortunate reactions on other questions outstanding between Kuwait and ’Irrq. - SECRETARY OF STATE - FiB IHDIA4. / Telegram From 6 XX Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs London. /**' \ To H.M.’b Ambassador, Bagdad. No.47 Repeated Goveriament of India, New Delhi. Political Resident, Bushire. Dated 9th (received 17th) February 1935.

I recognise that there are probably faults on both sides. But His Majesty’s Government are reluctant to 7see complete deadlock between these two states results of which might be most embarrassing to them over question which seems capable of settlement on reasonable lines. 2. In first ?place for political reasons His Majesty’s Government could not agree to customs union between Iraq and Kuwait and would be equally opposed for reasons given in my telegram No.8 of 1954 to ^Irafl-i customs control. It is essential to keep Kuwait out of ?Ircqi orbit. Proposals in this sense made by Iraq Govern ment since 1932 are therefore unacceptable. 3. Proposals of mrnifest system proposed by Shaikh, at my r? te if operated by reliable Director of Customs, appear to go very f* r to meet sea smuggling. If Shaikh could be persuaded to appoint suitable British or British Indian as Director would this in your opinion help to meet Iraq Government ? If so would they be prepared to contribute to his salary ?- 2 - ^ 4. I agree that Shaikh’s proposals do not dispose of question of land smuggling. International responsibility of stopping this rests primarily with Iraq Government, see my despatch No.706. Smugglers appear in most if not all cases to be organised in Basrah (Ogilvie-Forbes* telegram 35-Saving) while it is clear that existing preventive organisation on land frontier is quite inadequate (compare Bushire despatch dated 20th November). Primr facie step suggested by Political Resident ^ in paragraph 6 of his despatch dated 20th November would go far to meet the case. What, if any, are the Iraq objections to taking action on these lines ? I appreciate danger that their posts mty develop into blocxade but this should be lessened if posts were established ©n the lines suggested by Bushire as part of general friendly arrangements. * 5. I think best course will be that you should ?discu83 informally with Mr.Sievwright and Irrq Government settlement &amp;s regards land smuggling on above lines but without of course in any wty committing His Majesty’s Government or Shaikh ?reg;arding appointment of Director of Customs which however, subject to Resident's comments, His Majesty’s Government will press on Shaikh. Director if appointed could operate system of manifests in regard to goods consigned to overland frontier which, taking preventive measures referred to in paragraph 4 above should in my opinion enable Iraq to establish effective control without any limitation of imports into Kuwait (to which there would be objection) without transgression over Kuwait border and without pryment of compensation to hhaikh (save ?cost in respect of salary of Director of Customs). 6. Matter is very urgent and I shall be very grateful for earliest possible comments. If no settlement proves practicable on above lines it n^y be necessary to fall back on procedure /-3- procedure proposed in Bushire despatch No«?7-S ol Jf nur ry 8th but His Majesty’s Gorernment are most reluctfent to risk consequences sugg ested in par? graph 2 of your despatch Eo.7H unless this is quite inevitable. -Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs -: CONFIDENTIAL, N 0&lt; 215-S oi* 1935.

Bagdtd. 7th February 1936* Sir, I have the honour to invite a reference to my despatch of December 16th last, No*711, and to the despatch fro:, the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No.2*7-d of January 8 th, 1935, to the India Office, relative to the question of smuggling from Kuwait. 2* In order to prepare the ground for the conversation which I hoped to have with Colonel Fowls on my visit to Bushire, I recently invited 1 essrs.Hogg and Sie vwright, tiie Adviser to the Ministry of Finance and the Inspector-General of Customs respectively, to discuss with myself and my staff the possibility of reaching some degree of agreement between His Lfyesty‘s embassy and the Iraqi Government, as to what would be reasonable measures of anti-smuggling co-operation to suggest to the Shaikh of Kuwait* As a result general agreement was reached on the outline of a scheme which it w.,s thought the Shaikh could accept without loss of dignity. The conclusions reached at tiie meeting are summarised in the attached memorandum* 3. It will be observed that the suggested measures have not yet been acce, ted in principle by the Iraqi Government, but represent what their advisers are prepared to recommend for acceptance. If agreement is reached in principle on the main heads set out in the memorandum there will still be much room for discussion before the figures of quota and compensation are settled. 4* I explained these proposals at Bushire to Colonel Fowle, who / a Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G*C.3.1•,K*C.V.O., etc., etc., etc.■ 2 - who expressed his willingness to place them bei'ore the Shaikh of Kuwait skM if this course is ap, roved. He has incorporated them in his despatch No. 173-3 of the 2nd ebruary to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, a copy of which has been sent to the Secretary of* State ior India. I am in agreement with the recommendations made by Colonel Fowls in that despatch and would only stress the necessity for a decision to be taken at a very early date. 5. The Iraqi Government are being pressed on all sides to take definite steps to combat the ever-increasing flow of contraband goods from Kuwait, and unless the Shaikh takes positive and early action to show his good-will and readiness to co-operate it will not be possible or advisable to attempt them to res train*/from instituting such lawful measures ~s they think necess ry. 8 . I associate myself with the suggestion contained in Colonel Fowle’s telegram of 2nd February, No. 164, that the Shaikh should pay a private visit to Bagdad in order to discuss matters informally with the Iraqi Government. If this sugges tion receives the approval of His HaJesty* s Government in the United Kingdom, I will do what I can to ensure that Kin&amp; Gha^i issues an invitation to the bhaikh for a private visit to Bagciad as soon as possible. 7 . I am sending a copy oi this despatch to the Hon 1 ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to ue with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, sd.F.H.Humphrys^ypHAMDUK OK KUWAIT SMUGGLING The outcome of the meeting of His Excellency Sir Irancis H. Humphrys and Messrs. Hogg, Sievwright, Bateman and Stafford was briefly as follows!- I. That the Iraqi Government would not put forward any further detailed proposals for the co-operation of the Shaikh in the prevention of smuggling, as the Shaikh had not furnish ed any considered reply to the scheme placed before him by the Iraqi delegation wnich visited him in September last. 2. That the advisers to the Government have prepared a scheme of which the following are the main principles. These principles, subject to agreement later on details and the figures of quotas and compensation, have been accepted by His Majesty*s embassy as being &amp;ir and reasonable measures which the Shaikh should accept in order to retain the amity of Iraq :- (a) The appointment of an experienced British director of Customs at Kuwait, preferably from India, with an adequate staff. One half of the cost of the Director and the staff would be defrayed by the Iraqi Government on the understanding that/the director would work in the closest co-operation with the Iraqi Customs Department. He would send^opies l of all export licences for goods leaving Kuwait by land or sea to the Iraqi Customs Department and furnish all Information reasonably required by the Department for use in the prevention of smuggling. (b) The import of certain articles into Kuwait to be restricted to an annual quota. These commodities are those on wnich a high fixed rate oi duty is chargeable and which are known to be smuggled into Iraq in great quantity. The Iraqi Government should /3. / - 2 ~ should have power to require the Shaikh to add other commodities to the schedule should smu^&amp;l-ox them become rile# Sugar Coffee Tea Tobacco and Cigarettes Matches Cigarette Paper ^ It is suggested that tlid import quota should oe x xxeu on a per capita basis arid that the amount per capita imported into Iraq f where the standard oi living is at least as high as it is in Kuwait* should be regarded as a lair consumption per capita for Kuwait. The quota should be for such quantities as would be sufficient to allow for the consumption in Kuwait of the amount of the Iraqi per capita import by each inhabitant of Kuwait# In addition to this the Kuwaiti Customs would be empowered to issue import licences for quantities in excess of the quota required lor the legitimate export trade . Such additional imports would not exceed 10 per cent of the quota and would only be issued after enquiry had elicited that the goods were required xor licit commerce. Copies of all such import cert in cutes would be sent to the Iraqi Customs. (c) A joint Kuwaiti-Iraqi preventive service should be established* with power to operate within defined limits in the territories of both states* on land and sea. Both States would be rex^resented in the force, wnich would work in close liaison with both Customs Administrations. (d) In order to reimburse the Shaikh nominalxy xor his expenses in connection with the joint preventive service arid other measures (but actually to compensate him for » losses which he may suffer by the introduction of these arrangement#) the Iraqi Government will pay him a lump sum annually •-3- 3* It was agreed that if the Shaikh expressed his willing ness to accept these principles they ahoula be put forward to the Iraqi Government by His Majesty’s xainbassy ior their concurrence and. for the settlement 01 details* A time limit should be fixed, as the Iraqi Government werebe n e hard pressed to introduce stem repressive KHixl unilateral measures. 4 MOTdS * (1) As regards (c) above, there is a precedent (viz* the Iinnish-Swedish Agreement of December 29th, 1933)* It is clear that the Shaikh would suffer no loss oi prestige or sovereignty in agreeing under this head. (2) There is ui^gent need for the Shaikh to adopt a definite attitude at once towards these proposals. Iraqi merchants are complaining everwher© oi being undercut by the prices of goods smuggled from Kuwait and business is in a chaotic state* questions ax*e being raised in parliament, and failing a move by the Shaikh, the Iraqi Government will be obliged by public pressure to t-ke stringent measures to stop smuggling* This will entail expenditure which musu be provided in the budget estimates and that means a cteciaion before March 31su one way or the other. (3) As a preliminary measure the Iraqi Government will no doubt withdraw the valuable customs privileges enjoyed at present by Kuwait.

You will have seen from my despatch ^ .^o. 7 2f that proposals which formed basis of Towle*» i\ n\ despatch no. 17 3-S of February 2nd arose from dis- -cussions which I held With Mr Hogg and Mr Sievewri^it ^ U f o \ prior to my visit to Bushlre. The present position is as follows! In 1953 there 535 discovered cases of smuggling. In 1934 there were 1041 oases of which only 87 were by sea. Land smuggling is ge nerally increasing. The value of smuggled goods actually captured in f Iraq last year amounted to approximately £15# GOG/- the duty on which would have been £10,000/- The goods included 200 tons of sugar and one and a half million boxes of matches. I was recently in- -formed by a representative of Swedish Match Company that his fiirm is exporting yearly equal quantities of feoods to Basra and Kuwait and he estimates that 90^ of would be smuggled into Iraq. f;. Owing to underselling of goods . V'h B®M&amp;t&gt;led from Kuwait trade in some parts of Iraq is A becoming stagnant and pressure is being brought on A Gove rrmientGove rime nt to take active steps to prevent smuggling. Itoe Government are aware that responsibility of stopping smuggling rests with them tout they are convinced that pre -vantive courses open to them will not toe effective without 4 V 0 Shaikh* a cooperation# /P Ihe measures suggested in my despatch *k&gt;# are the result of two years hard thinking by Iraq Government and form an interlocking svs tem which they/feel should toe accepted as a whole. They have made it clear that they are willing to reimburse Shaikh for any loss or expense which he may incur in adopting these proposals. I i**ve diacuoood witn -uriiiah ouvisex’s of Iraq Government modified system proposed in your telegram ho. 41 with a view to ascertaining, if put forward by Shaikh, it would toe acceptable to Iraq Government. I can now say defi- -nitely that it would toe unacceptable and that unless -n,,.ikh is approached at once and puts f orward ( proposalS similar to those outlined in my despatch ^o. 72 Iraq Government will be otoli 0 ed to adopt coercive measures and to apply for toudgetar; provision for necessary materiel before march cist next.

From above it will be seen that patience of Iraq Government is now exhausted. hey had not thought of bringing Kuwait into a customs unit or into their political orbit but the are determined to put an end to a situation w*r which has brought them much unpopularity with trading ognmuni* «ty and ever i nr easing losses to their sue toms. they have invoked Majesty* s Government to bring Shaikh to reason and sincerely desire to settle this question by friendly cooperation rather than by coercive measures. They now wish it to be understood that unless Shaikh puts forward some reasonable cooperative shhexoe without delay steps will be taken to institute a strict blockade of hie territory. ~ w- , Humphry btelegram From TO Repeated xx Political Resiaent, Bashir©* Secretary vi State for India&gt; London* Government of India* New Delhi.

Kuwait Iraq Smuggling. While measures suggested in your despatch No.72 L of February 7th may be regarded as most suitable by European customs experts in Iraqi service, and may not be unsatisfactory from jfrely customs point of view, they are, I fear, open to gravest objections from political point of view, since they would lead to acquisition by Iraq of a degree of influence in Kuwait (?Internal) affairs which is quite incompatible with declared policy of His Majesty’s Government in regard to independence of Kuwait. On the other hand, His Majesty’s Government appreciate that Iraqi Government inspite of the fact that they have made no effort either to establish efficient preventive service on frontier or to deal with Iraqis who are mainly responsible for smuggling organisation, may have a legitimate grievance if Shaikh refuses all measures of cooperation with a view to reduction of suppression of smuggling. They therefore propose to press Shaikh strongly on the lines suggested in India Office telegram No.664 of March 1st to Political Resident to agree to appointment of British or British Indian Director of Customs with sufficient powers to enable a scheme of practical cooperation free from drawbacks of that proposed by Iraqi Government to be worked out by His Majesty’s Government on consultation with you and2 you and Political Resident* Before pressing bhalkh in this direction however it is essential that they should have some indication whether Iraqi Government would be prepared to agree to a what s his? Jat solution on these lines and to develop an adequate preventive organisation of their own* / You will appreciate that if Iraqi Government were * still to persist in their programme of compulsion described in last two paragraphs your telegram of the 19th ultimo, No.4,7, notwithstanding acceptance by Shaikh of some solution proposed by His Majesty’s Government on the lines indicated above His Majesty’s Government would have no choice but to treat this as a major .anglo-Iraq issue. I ly Retaxandum-Nfote for P.R. IRAQ-KUWAIT SMUGGLING- DISPUTE . Some suggestions for cooperation, open to the Shaikh. 44 ^ a' vi I* (a) In view of the fact that 95% of the smuggling with Iraq is done by Euphrates river tribal fraternity (riverain tribes), the Shaikh could offer to stop every Iraqi tribesman entering Kuwait Town unless in possession of a special certificate of Identity or Pass, signed and issued by his own Mutasarrif, Q,aimakam or Mudir. Such pass not only to authorize him to proceed to Kuwait, but to contain on it the articles of food or clothing he desired to purchase there* (b) As a quid pro quo the Shaikh to insist that the Iraq Government should establish 4 Customs posts on th their side of the frontier and that proper patrolling take place between thou* (c) Such posts to be at Safwan (already existing) Jarishan, Athaiba and Obeid* (d) All passholders to be required to enter Kuwait territory and return again through one of the above posts. It being the duty of the Commander of the patrols working between posts to shepherd tribesmen desiring to cross the frontier towards these posts. Similarly in order to deal effectively with the few but highly dangerous and undesirable Iraqi townsmen who armed with money, make a practice of coming down to Kuwait expressly for the purpose of arranging smuggling ventures, the Shaikh could tighten up the existing Passport system and lay it down that no Iraqi Townsman desirous of visiting Kuwait, could leave Zubair, and pass Safwan post unless armed with a no objection Certificate given by H.M’s Consul in Basra. The latter whenever an Iraqi townsman applied for a visa, would telegraph (at applicants expense) to the Political Agent, Kuwait, and enquire if there was any objection to his visiting the Principality. The type of undesirable it is required 1 t- a required to keep out are mostly known in Kuwait, should however, The Shaikh/as a quid pro quo make the proviso that Kuwaiti nationals desiring to return home from Basra should be exempt from this restriction* 3.. The bhaikh could also refuse to allow any cargo to be landed ’dff steamers if marked Tf Basra option Kuwait', but he should request as a quid pro quo that the Iraq Government should pass a law making it an offence for their subjects to indulge in this form of pursuit, which obviously means that the cargo is t&gt;o be smuggled, 4 . The bhaikh has already agreed to enforce the manifest system in full on goods leaving Kuwait by sea.To From Telegram I.F.0.19 27 and India Office, I Political Hesic Repeated F.&amp; P.Deptt, Government of India, No,665 Political Agent, Kuwait, No.666. Ambassador, Baghdad, No.667. Dated the 1st received the 2nd March 1935 Kuwait Iraq Smuggling. Matter has been further considered here in the light of your view and Humphrys. We appreciate importance your contention that His Majesty’s Government should so far as possible avoid involving themselves in this dispute. But we feel that unless Shaikh spotaneously makes acceptable proposals or asks for and accepts our advice we shall have to meet unjustified criticism whether we decided (a) To let him face full consequences of a breach with Iraq or (b) Press him to agree to take certain steps to meet Iraq criticisms at the same time as we take corresponding action with Iraq Government for their (? malpractices). ' 2 . Foreign Office telegram 77, Ma&gt;*llst to Baghdad will make position of His majesty’s Government clear to you as regards Iraqi proposals but you will appreciate that they cannot take as strong a line with Iraq as they would wish, so long as they are unable to point to any disposition to cooperate on the part of shaikh off Kuwait. 3 . In these circumstances th^r think best course would , be as follows: that subject to Humphrys reply, paragraph No.2 of Foreign Office telegram to Baghdad No,77, March 1 st, you should ^ \ (a) Write letter to Shaikh of Kuwait on general lines indicated in paragraphs 2(a) to 2(c) of■ ,4-^ .V'v 1 / ^ of your despatch 20-S of Januaiy 8 th(as modified in paragraph No. 1(a) and 1 (of your telegram of the 26th ultimo, No.222, and in paragraph No. , 2 (c) of your despatch February 2 nd, No.l73-S) omitting paragraphs (d) (e) and (f) and substituting new paragraph to the effect that situation is now a very serious one for Shaikh and that you have been instructed by Hi s i^ajesty^ Government to discuss it with him. (b) Proceed Kuwait at once as you suggest and personal ly interview shaikh. (c) Intimate to Shaikh once he has had time to digest your letter, that his position has now become very dangerous and that effect on his State of open breach with Iraq in matter in which his conduct is not irreproachable s cannot but be very serious; that at same^ His Majesty’s Government do not feel able to urge him to accept Iraqi proposals for reasons indicated in Foreign Office telegram No.77, March 1st to Baghdad, though these reasons need not be quoted. In these circumstances they consider Shaikh should put himself in right by putting forward concr etealternative scheme which His Majesty’s Government could support, and they consider best scheme in these circumstances would be appointment of a British or British Indian (but preferably British) Director of Customs in Shaikh’s service with adequate staff, half cost of which would be paid to Shaikh through His Majesty’s Government by Iraq who would be able effectively to operate a system of manifests etcetera to be worked out in detail in consultation with Shaikh. In that event His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to give him strongest possible support with T-rcirH anv^rnmpnt if necessary making dispute a major Iraqi Government , xi j Knglo-Iraqi issue. 4-/s 4. You should further emphasise that appointment of a Director of Customs would also be of value in connection with operation of any system of Customs control etc. which may result from discussions with Saudi Government regarding termination of Saudi blockade* 5. If Shaikh adopts i~inm1 niflu 'ainl cooperative attitude, he should be warned that His Majesty^ Government expect him to take their advice, and will take a serious view of his failure to do so. You may at your discretion add that they would have no option but to make it known in Kuwait that he has acted against their advice and incurred their displeasure and that they could take no responsibility for result • Retaxandum-Telegram From To No. Dated the I.F.0.1927 and 30.

Subject: Contraband Smuggling between Kuwait and Iraq. 'r &lt;^\y A/C. I have the honour to refer to the conversation that I had with Your Excellency on the above subject, while passing through Kuwait on my return from leave in October las t. 2. In the course of the above conversation, Your Excellency will recall, that 1 discussed with you among other things, the proposals of the Iraq Government as ^resented by their representatives on their visit to Kuwait, on September 22nd a.934 and which were given to Your Excellency by Lieut.-Colonel G.Loch. These proposals, if Your Excellency will remember, were as follows (i) That Your Excellency should give an undertaking to prevent ■ smuggling. (ii) That practical measures were necessary to ensure this undertaking, if accepued, being carried out, and the suggestions of the Iraq Govt, were:- (a) to apply the Iraq tariff in Kuwait with the technical advice of the Iraq Customs authorities, or (b) to retain the Kuwait tariff in Kuwait and to place the manage ment of the Kuwait Customs under Iraqi Customs officials in the employ of the Shaikh ox Kuwait, ' and that there should be a limitation/- 2 - limitation of imports* In either case, (a) or (b) compensation would be paid to Your Excellency. (iii) That if neither of these suggestions v/as acceptable to Your Excellency, the Iraq Government would be prepared to discuss any further suggestions which Your Excellency might wish to ma^e for a settlement agreeable to both parties. 3. Your Excellency will also recall that on a previous occasion (18.7.34) when I passed through Kuwait on my way home on leave, Your Excellency, out of regard for the friendly relations that exist between Kuwait and Iraq, expressed your willingness to take the following' measures:- (1) That all concerned in Kuwait would be warned that no goods whatsoever could be exported by sea without being manifested: and. that any persons found violating this order would be most severely dealt with. (2) That the Nakhuda of every boat sail ing from Kuwait would be given a spare copy of the manifest of the goods carried by him, and on the ship’s return to Kuwait this manifest would have to be produced showing an^ endorsement by the Customs official of the port or ports of destination, certifying that the relevant goods had been duly landed at that port. 4. I have now heard from His Excellency The Ambassador, Bagdad, with whom i have been in close correspondence on the matter, that the measures proposed by Your Excellency, from the point of view of the Iraqi Government ao not go nearly far enough, and that ix Your Excellency is not prepared to make any advance on them, the Iraq Government will be forced to effect /effect certain counter-measures. These generally will probably be as follows: (i) The total prohibtion of all imports from Kuwaiu into Iraq. (ii) The strengthening of the armed forces patrolling the land frontier of Iraqj and the imposition of a total blockade oi Kuwait. (iii) Severe restrictions on. the entry into Iraq v/aters of Kuwait craft. (iv) The- stopping—of Kuwait boats getting water from the Shatt al Arab. (v) The withdrawal of the valuable Customs concession at present extended to Kuwait commerce. 5. For Your Excellency's information, in the last-named category (v) are included the privileges of export of goods from Iraq into Kuwaio out of bond, and under drawback free of customs and excise duty, and the concession admissible to goods in trans all of which privileges can be restrict it, ed or withdrawn by an Iraq Government Regula tion. 6, His Majesty’s Government consider that the situation has now developed into a very serious one for Your Excellency, and have accordingly instructed me to visit Kuwait and discuss the matter with you. 7* The situation is now as follows: The Iraq Government, after representations from His Majesty's Government, finally agree that their requirements will be met by the appointment of a British or British Inaian Director of Customs with adequate staff in Your Excellency's service. Half the cost of /Dietat ed by P.R. This portion to be told to Shaikh verbally with draft letter {p.142(a) j in place of paragraphs 7 Sc 8 . \ H.M. Government’s views as to the measures which the Shaikh and the IRAQ Goverament should take res pectively to prevent smuggling are as follows:- They (H.M,G.) advise the Shaikh strongly to fall in with these measures in so far as they concern him. (a) Appointment of a British Customs Director with special powers. Details as to these powers to await outcome of conference mentioned below. At this conference scheme can be considered for agreed limitation of imports into Ku?/ait. (b) The system of manifests by land. (o) Formation of preventive service by Shaikh. (d) IRAQ Government paying for total cost of (a)(b)(c) above. (e) IRAQ shall institute proper effective control on her side frontier. (f) That in order to discuss the details of the above, a Conference to be assembled under the. Chairmanship of the Hon’ble the Political Resident, with Kuwait represented by one Kuwaiti and one British official, and IRAQ by one IRAQI and one British official From what the IRAQ authorities told the Resident verbally, the probable place of Conference would be Kuwait if Shaikh so Dietat ed by P.R. de sired.U.E . -4- of the Director and his staff would be paid to Your Excellency by the Iraq Government through His Majesty f s Government. A detailed scheme as to the- measures which the Director will put into force will be worked out between Your Excellency (in consultation with myself) and the Iraq Government. If a scheme accept able both to Your Excellency and to the Iraq Government can be evolved the Director will then be appointed and the scheme put into effect. If no such scheme can be evolved then the Iraq Government will have no cnoice but to put into operation any or all of the measures mentioned in para 4 above. 8. Taking all the circumstances, into consideration His Majesty’s Government have directed me to give you the strongest possible advice to accept the scheme outlined aoove * They have further directed me to inform Your Excellency that should you no u accept ? since all the measures proposed by the Iraq Government are witmn their legal i ightSf His Majesty’s Government will be unable to rive Your Excellency any further assistcUiCe in the matter.Shaikh f s explanation 5. He concluded by saying that he was most anxious that His Majesty's Government should not be under the impression that his attitude was simply one of obstinacy and asked me on his behalf to explain to His Majesty’s Government that thio matter while one perhaps of loss to I^aq was one of life or death to Kuwait. That he was surrounded by larger and stranger powers which, either by actual blockade as in the case of Bin Baud or by impossible high tariff as in the case of Iraq and Persia, rendered licit trade impossible# That his Principality was a desert producing nothing but grass for animals end that the only way that his people could live and get money to make purchases of food and clothing from India was by making Kuwait a market town for the interior including the Iraqi bedouin tribes. That in these circumstances the matter was one of life or death to Kuwait and that as for the blockade (the serious consequences of which I have drawn to his attention) he would prefer 'to be killed rather than to commit suicide M . 6. The Shaikh spoke sincerely and with some feeling and in the main his arguments from his point of view appear to Dickson and m)Di myself to have much in them.CONFIDENTIAL.

It is true that he was stupid S^ver xhe suggested Bagdad conference of February 1934 (vid* correspondence ending with ray express Letter ho.l&amp;S of 20th February 1934) but his actual conduct vis a vis Iraq has been studiously correct.

In spite of this the Iraq customs authorities have for the last three years pursued a deliberate /{ 4 %'*■ I / X J f deliberate policy of a succession of illegal high-handed and brutal acts which have involved the ill.treatment, wounuing aiid killing of Kuwaiti subjects with the obvious aim of bullying the Shaikh into co-operation# If the Shaikh had taken the law into his own hands (he has half-a-dozen armed Ford vanettes) or encouraged his people to do so and Iraqi Customs guards had been shot His 1 ajesty *0 Government woula have had a very serious situation on their hands.

Dated and received the 6th March i.935* y Your telegram No.77. Owing to resignation of Cabinet I have been unaole until now to discuss Kuwait Smuggling with ’ Iraq Government. I have to-day discussed your modified proposals with Advisers and Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Finance. \ They are most grateful that His Majesty*® Govern ment are prepared to take positive action with Shaikh but are keenly disappointed at what they consider to be total inadequacy of proposals which are to be put to him and have given me to understand that these are no more acceptable now than they were when I sent my telegram No .47. The contention of the Iraq Government, in which they are strongly supported by their British Advisers, is that imports into Kuwait of sugar, tea, matches, coffee, tobacco, cigarettes and cigarette paper are now approximately ten t lines greater than quantities which Kuwait can consume. The whole excess is deliberately imported solely for the purpose of smuggling and Iraq is by far the greatest sufferer. This is a fact and not a mere assumption as there are no ^icit exports whatever of these goods from Kuwait. 3 Unless therefore imports can be restricted to mat, bona fide requirements of Kuwait the root of evil Restriction can be effected either by equalising / will remain. ‘l&gt;) f x ) equalising the import tariff of the two countries, or by issue under strict control of a British Customs Director of import licences, not exceeding a fixed total for the seven articles in question. They regard appointment of a Customs Director as useless unless one or other of above remedies is accepted in principle by Shaikh beforehand. i&lt;Miii»8iriiiT'fTttWtiTtiroiri Yinwrfii^ ■ ■ ai ■ A- Iraq Government consider that alternative to restriction of imports into Kuwait of the seven articles mentioned is establishment of an efficient preventive service which owing to absence of any physical features on bounaary practically amounts to a blockade. This would oixly leau to embitterment of relations between Kuwait and Iraq and is, I submit, contrary to common sense since plain fact is that excess of imports should not be allowed into Kuwait at all. For last 15 months Iraq Government have deferred taking active measures on the lines adopted by Ibn Baud in the hope that through the good offices of His Majesty’s Government Shaikh would be brought to reasonable frame of mind. tT It is probably true that Iraqi Customs oliicials have committed illegal acts in Kuwait waters but it is a complete misunderstanding of position and facts ,to say that obvious aim of Iraq Government for the last 3 years has been to bully the Shailch into co-operating. Iraq genuinely desires to live on best of terms with Kuwait but expects neighbourly conduct from Shaikh. -aef-inite newn, regard it as a definitely unfriendly act that Shaikh should allow large quantity of goods to be imported into his country which he ; knows can only be intended to be smuggled into Iraq. If | blockade is established I do not think that Iraq will delibera ely cut off Kuwait water supply. As however bloakade entails prohibiting entry of Kuwaitis into Iraq territory, restrictions /-3- restrictions on enu*y of Kuwaiti boats into Iraq territorial waters must necessarily follow* This will mean in practice restrictions on movements of Kuwait water boats and a heavy increase in cost of their operations. Iraq Government are fully determined to take every effective defensive measure they can to preserve their interests. Unless His Majesty’s Government can bring about some amelioration of present position it is inevitable that Iraq will shortly demand a representative of her own and it will be difficult to resist the justice of her claim. (o To sum up. If useless expense and embittered relations are to be avoided Shaikh must be persuaded to agree to appointment of British Director of Customs in Kuwait and restrictions on import of the seven speciiied articles to bona fide requirements of his people. On their part Iraq Government will be ready to assist him financially. These in my opinion are basic principles of any lasting solution and time is running short. -HUMi'HRYS- (Copy given to Political Agent* Kuwait)/ / Ci FTom To Repeated xx /i f 7 2 -Jl Becretary of State for Bdreign Affairs, London.

CON FI PINT I \L Eav I.cccii t P No /7CP Da^ l // D • \ ' ~ / Your telegram No. 58 I am glad to note from final para, of Part Two of your telegram which has presumably been repeated to Political Resident and Government of India that you consider that Iraq Government would be prepared to agree to a solution based on appointment of British Director of Customs in Kuwait and on this assumption His Majesty* s Government are prepared to press Shaikh strongly to accept such an official. 2. On the other hand this agreement appears to • i be qualified by continued insistence on unconditional limit ation of imports. It is hardly possible for His Majesty*s Government to press Shaikh to accept at dictation of Iraq Government a scheme which would amount to severe rationing of his principal imports, since this would amount to virtual renunciation of his independent rights to maintenance of which you attach greatest importance and would involve legitimate transit trade. On latter point, although His Majesty's Government realise that efficient customs contrtfl may result in substantial diminution of imports into Kuwait , they cannot accept Iraqi suggestion that there can be no legitimate importation into Kuwait of articles named in Iraqi special list except in so far as they are required for local Kuwait consumption. They believe, provided economic relations of Kuwait with Saudi Arabia can be established on normal basis, Kuwait’s natural position as an entrepot may be expected~ 2 - expected to assert itself. His Majesty’s Government consider that a satisfac tory scheme for preventing illegitimate export of C3 oods from Kuwait can be evolved without arbitrary and unconditional limitation of imports. Detailed scheme will have to be worked out between Political authorities in Gulf iriconsultation w&amp;- with Shaikh, with His Majesty’s Embassy Bagdad, and with Iraq Government (in consultation with their British advisers). 4* It must however be made quite clear that His Majesty’s Government cannot agree to any arrangement whifch would involve raising of Kuwait tariff to Iraq level (you will remember that by treaty Shaikh is limited to 4/£ on British goods) and that any arrangement of limitation of imports or fixing of maximum quota in respect of individual articles would be acceptable only if framed in such a way as not to derogate from Sahikh’s independent rights. 5* In these circumstances you will appreciate that, although they are willing to bring pressure on Shaikh to settle with Iraq Government on reasonable terms. His Majesty’s Government cannot do so until they are assured that Iraq Government for their part will abandon their rigid insistence on one particular set of measures v&amp;a. arbitrary and unconditional limitation of imports at Iraq dictation and will be prepared to negotiate some alternative but equally effective solution. Without such an assurance it is useless for His Majesty’s Government to approach Shaikh while to give it need not in any way debar Iraq Government from r everting later to their present demands if negotiations on reasonable basis fail. 6. Urgency of matter is due to threats of Iraq Governmenta How that His Majesty’s Government are actively intervening I trust these can for time at any rate be laid aside.

Cannot Irac^ Government budget for institution of such a force own at once ? This might help to reassure their public opinion aud might also help His Majesty r s Government in persuading Shaikh to be reasonable* 7* Meanwhile I shall be glad if wither with or without further consultation with Iraq authorities you will confirm at earliest possible moment that Iraq Government will be willing to discuss settlement of this question on basis of Direct or appointment gL British or British Indian Customs Kuwait without prejudice to furtnerdetails of scheme fchich will be freel^y worked out between interested parties and His Majesty’s Government 0I / No ~Z2/_Da.el Telegram xx From To H.M4*s Ambassador, Bagdad, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs London.

I am informed however by Mr*Hogg that it is hopeless to expect that the Iraq Government would be willing to discuss settlement of smuggling question oh basis of appointment of British Customs Director Kuwait alone. Their objections to this course are (1) several months will probaoly elapse before Director is installed. (2) Director cannot do anything to control smuggling without administrative sanction of Shaikh behind him and would be regarded by Iraq Government as a mere facade. (3) unless one or other of principle (?measures) suggested by Iraq Government is adopted in advance of Director’s appointment (details of course would have to be discussed later) they are convinced that not (Vnothing) but procrasti nation will result.’ I am aware that Shaikh of Kuwait is limited by Treaty to 4% import duty on British goods but I regard this stipulation in present circumstances as an anachronism when import duty levied by neighbouring States ©n such an article as sugar is at least 25 times greater than the maximum imposed on Kuwait by our Treaty. As regards the secona alternative, Iraq Government are not seeking to impose arbitrary limitation on Shaikh but ask that he should be invited to suggest restriction by license on the seven articles principally smuggled into Iraq after Kuwait’s needs have been met* In this Iraq-Kuwait controversy we have an excellent opportunity of exercising our genius for mediation* If we let slip opportunity such as this I foresee time when force of circumstances will compel us to relinquish our exclusive position in Kuwait* I have restrained Iraq Government for many months from taking drastic action in the hope that something efficacious might be done to ease the situation and ii ids anything Majesty’s Government are unable at this saage to press ior / more than the appointment of a British Director of Customs in Kuwait there seems no alternative but to allow Iraq Goverruse] -ment to take their own measures provided they are legal, to put a sto^ to an situation. .aiis will probably mean that blocade of Kuwait will be complete. 3 cannot see that there is anything arbitrary, hostile or dictatorial in the Iraq Government’s present attitude. humphrys.

Jr. Kendel stated that from the recent correspondence on this c-uestion he had gained the impression that the Ira-*-! Oovernment, on the one hand, had failed to make any acceptable suggestions for the settlement of this problem and to take even such action as lay entirely within their own power to prevent smuggling into Xmqs but that the Sheikh, an the other hand. had by his obstructive tactics put himself in a position in which it was impossible for His Majesty‘a Government to take up his case wholeheartedly with the Iraqi Government.3 * ^oweit wa@ f of course t both politically and economically, an artificial creation, and w&amp;® subject to continuous pressure from 8audi-Arabl® and Ira-. sir Andrew ■cyan had shown very strikingly by hia imaginary dialogue between Ibn Send end the Sheikh what a power of attraction or pressure Saudi Arabia could exercise on Koweit and it waa probable that, if the iheikh were left to his own resources, it would bo to hia interest to let himself be absorbed by one or other of his neighbour®. in view, however, of the strategic importance of Loweit to His Majesty’s Government, the interest of Hia .lajeaty f s Government lay in preserving the independence of the nheikhdom, and 1 r* leadel was seriously inclined to doubt whether His Majesty*a Government could any longer seeure this end by pursuing their nineteenth century policy of keeping others out of Koweit while themselves declining responsibility for the administration of the Sheikhdom 4. With reference to the latest proposals which had been made Hr. Ren&amp;el we® inclined to doubt whether a direct discussion between the Sheikh and the King of Iraq, would further the solution of the smuggling problem. Such a meeting might indeed be used as an opportunity for farther anti-British Intrigue similar to that which had occurred when the Sheikh visited Bagdad in 1938. It might ©Iso, like the previous visit, give rise to difficulties in connexion with e return visit by the King of Iraq. It was at all event® certain that, even if any direct arrangement regarding smuggling were arrived at by this means, Koweit could not put it into effect without assistance, since the necessary administrative machinery did not exist there. The first step, therefore, was to provide Koweit with the/ 6,the Aeoe»©a,:y orgn niaation, tmd to achieve this object the appointment of « Iritieh ’ontroXler of the :o^it :n .to-,® easenti^l* Such an official ®ust he given 'wide power® and a free hand. The thei^h’s personal part in the settlement of this problem must he considerably reduced, and this xm&amp; desirable not only in the er ,,e of this particular question but also generally on grounds of His .;lajesty f a Government’s own interest. The Saudi blockade question, for example, would be far more easily settled if the Sheikh could be eliminated. 6. Mr. Rend.el therefore suggested that the Sheikh should be informed that the appointment of m, adequately equipped Controller of Customs was essential. If His Majesty’s Government were to help him in solving the smuggling problem. The sheikh should be told that, if he refused to agree to this appointment, His Majesty’s Government could only leave him to resist the aggressive designs of Iraq and Raudi Arabia unaided, as best he could. 7. Such a threat would of course be to some extent bluff, since His Majesty’s Government could not in fact afford to abandon Kowelt, and the Sheikh mist know this. On the other hand, although the independence of Koweit was, in view of recent developments in the Persian Gulf and Iraq a first class interest of His Majesty’s Government, they could not adequately defend, it with their present weapons. Mr. Rend el felt very strongly that His Majesty’s Government must either advance or retreat from their present unsatisfactory position in Koweit, whereby their relations with the Sheikh’s neighbours, especially with Xbn Gaud, were perpetually at the mercy of his bad faith and shiftiness. He thought that His Majesty’s Government should take this opportunity of obtaining closer control at the source of the trouble, particularly/particularly as it had already 'bmn agreed in principle that their ultimate policy should be to try to tighten up their hold &lt;m Howeit and their control over the Sheikh. a * -^f^Mthwaite agreed that the position was one of difficulty and that the Sheikh had not been very co-operative• un the other hand# in considering the application of sanctions to him# it could not be overlooked that Mis Majesty's Government were themselves at the moment in an unsatisfactory position# since it was always open to the Sheikh to reply to suggestions that he was not co-operating actively with them that His Majesty's Oovernrsent had entirely failed to implement their undertakings as regards the Kcwcit date gardens in Iraq* It was common ground between the Foreign Office and the India Office that it was essential to dispose of the question of the date gardens as soon as possible but cases such as the present were another illustration of the embarrassing affect of this dispute on our relations with Koweit. 9. 3o far as the question immediately before the meeting was concerned, he thought that the argument© advanced by Colonel Fowl® against an official conference at Bagdad without the prior consent of the Sheikh ware decisive and It looked as though Sir Francis Humphry*# after discussion with the Resident took the same view. On this assumption# the quest Ions for decision were: (a) whether His Majesty's Government should adopt the course of action suggested in Bushire despatch of 8th January# Ho«SO—8j (b} what line was to be taken as regards the suggested visit of the iheikh to King OhasdU 10. .',n regards ’ he of theae questions It w o# of course# quite possible that in the long run there might be nothing,/nothing for It but to take action on the lines now suggested by the Resident and apparently accepted, by Sir Francis Huaphryo* But it went without saying that if the Sheikh proved obstinate and if Iraq in consequence took retaliatory action, on the line® referred to in paragraph B of Bagdad despatch of 16th December f a very serious situation would arise; and that sooner or later it would be impossible for His Majesty’s Oormmmnt to avoid intervening to re-establish friendly .relations between Iraq and Koweit* It was relevant t too* that while it would no doubt be recognised In Howe it that the Sheikh was himself to blase for provoking retaliatory action by Iraq, some of the odium eeemod likely to fall on His Majesty’s Government* In thane circumstances it seemed desirable to make every effort to explore alternatives, and on the information available there seamed no reason why, with ©one degree of goodwill on both sides, a satisfactory via media should not be found* ^1* ..He 1 th^aite said that in the first place the l correspondence made It clear that legally the burden of preventing smuggling across the Koweit-Iraq frontier rested on Iraq; that in fact the actual smugglers were largely if not entirely Iraqis; Mi that the smuggling was organised in Basra* Secondly, it seemed, clear that the existing preventive organisation on the Koveit-Iraq frontier warn quite inadequate* The Sheikh had already made proposal© which, if accepted (and supplemented by the appointment of a competent customs official) would apparently go a very long way to dispose of the question of smuggling by sea* He agreed that the Sheikh’s proposals did not dispose of the question of smuggling by land* But while that was primarily a . ueatlon for Iran, what were the/tih- 1 ® objections to the ost&amp; b 11 oJujieiit, of* 0 ssseXX pi^eventlvo ■organisation by Xra^ on the lines suggested in paragraph 6 of Bushiro despatch of 20th November to Bagdad? ?he cost would not he very great f a net would be the less important if the financial loss to Iraq consequent on the snuggling was really as serious as was suggested* In reply to a question from Mr* Handel , he agreed that it would be Important that noweit should yaalce some effort to co«-ox&gt;erate with such an organisation. But if the Sheikh was prepared to accept e Director of Customs 9 there seemed ho reason why a system of manifests should not be worked In respect of consignments sent by land and no doubt the Director, if he was a man of some little standing, might be able ultimately to establish good working relations with his opposite number in Iraq. 12. He agreed that there was smeh to be said for the appointment of a Director of Customs* But this was a question on which it would be necessary to consult the Resident and probably the Government of India before a decision could be taken. There was, however, no reason why we should not at once ask Colonel Powle for his opinion aa to the Sheikh 1 ® probable reaction to such a proposal. Dr. Laithwaite suggested that in the circumstances which had been discussed it might be worth while to make a further effort to reach a reasonable settlement of this dispute on the lines which he had indicated. It was, he thought, common ground that Hie Majesty’s Government would be opposed for political reasons to any customs union between Koweit and Iraq, or (for reasons which had already been explained to the Embassy) to any f 01*12 of Joint customs control. This had, perhaps, never been made clear in m imtw words andit might he worth while touching on it* It might also be worth while to make it clear that Hia Majesty’s Government would see no objection to the establishment of a line of posts along the Koweit-Ira« frontier* While there was admittedly the risk that such a line might develop into m land blockade, the danger of this would be much diminished if the posts were set up as part of a joint friendly arrangement between Iraq and Koxeit, negotiated through His Majesty's Government* 13* As regards the visit of King Ohassi, the India Office were alive to the difficulties to which Mr* Rondel had referred, but they were impressed by the strong recommendation of the Resident and the fact that Ms view was shared by Sir Francis Humphry©* It would, of course, be important to discourage any question of a return visit and equally there could be no question of His Majesty's Government approving any form of agreement between Xoweit and Iraq. 14* Gir rchlbald Clark Kerr said that he thought cm the whole that there was a reasonable mm for exploring the compromise solution that had been suggested* 15* The meeting then discussed the line of policy to be adopted in the immediate future and. it was agreed that telegrams should be despatched to Bagdad and Buahire embodying the conclusions arrived at.

According to the Iraqi report there were two incidents A and B as narked by me on their note. A apparently was not reported by the Shaikh, presumably because it took place in Iraq territorial waters. 3. With regard to B it is common ground that shots were fired by the Iraq Customs officials but the latter state that they fired in the air as a warning, while the Kuwait case is that the shots were fired at the boatmen. It is also common ground that no contraband was found in the boat. The point at issue, therefore, is whether according to the Kuwait state ment the launch was in Kuwait territorial waters, or whether according to the Iraqi case it was outside those waters. 4. This point-, being merely a matter of statement on Doth sides, personally I do not see much point in pursuing the matter further. SO.. i.c.ruwxc, Lieut. -Colonel.

The Ministry for Foreign Affairs present their compliments to His Britannic Majesty's Embassy, Bagdad, and, with refer ence to the Embassy's note No.84 dated 22nd February 1935, have the honour to give below the result of the enquiries made into the incident in question. 1. Enquiries made from the Assistant Preventive Officer, Customs and Excise Office, Fao, and the individuals who accompanied him, reveal that the motor launch which carried them did not ''cross' (? enter) the territorial waters of Kuwait while proceeding to Khor 'Abdullah on 4th November 1934, that they did not land on the Island of Warba, and that their cruise was confined within the 'Iraqi section of that zone • 2. At 9 a.m. on the day of the incident the above mentionec 'Iraqi officials saw a boat enter the 'Iraqi waters in the zone in question, whereupon they fired a few shots in the air with the object of ascertaining whether the men in the boat had any arms with them. Having satisfied themselves that the boatmen had no arms with them, as the latter threw themselves overboard into the water and tied away into the desert in 'Iraq, without offering any resistance, the 'Iraqi officials drew close to the boat, which they searched and found to tontain smuggled goods. On their return, the 'Iradji officials came across a boat, belonging to one oa»im, a nakhuda, which, it occurred to them, was also engaged in smuggling, and they therefore in accordance with their practice fired a few shots in the air with the object of ascertaining / His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy,ascertaining whether or not the boatmen had any arms with them• Having assured themselves on this point, they drew close to the boat and addressed a number of questions to the nakhuda, as a result of which they were satisfied that the boat was not engaged in smuggling, whereupon they released it and resumed their duty without having committed any act of aggression. The Ministry beg to inform the esteemed Embassy that in view of the instructions issued to them on the * subject Iraqi customs officials charged with the combating of smuggling appreciate the responsibilities involved by their crossing the frontier. Therefore they always and in all circumstances avoid crossing the frontier. There is no doubt that Kuwa&amp;i subjects are induced to submit such complaints, which are conorary to fact, by the belief on their part that these complaints may lead to a loosening of control such as would leave the field open for more extensive smuggling activities and enable them to carry on the traffic by which they live, and which has caused ’Iraq great economic harm. The Ministry av&amp;il themselves of this opportunity to express their highest consideration and esteem.Conf idential Ho. C-124. POLITICAL AGISNCY, KUWAIT. The 3rd May 1935.

Sir, On the receipt of your despatch No. 206 (E. 1676/127/91) of March 15th last, 1 took early opportunity of set A ng before Nuri Pasha your views on the extent to which His ^jesty’s Grovernment would be justified in intervening to put a stop to smuggling from Kuwait into Iraq. I told His Excellency that this question was not entirely new to me» I had studied it in your department before coming to Bagdad, and he might rest assured of the genuine desire of His Majesty’s Government to mediate effectively and with justice ,&gt;1 to both parties 2o Having then given him the substance of my predecessor’s telegram No. 62T of March llth, I read him enough of your despatch under reference to make it clear that, as at present advised , His Majesty’s Government were not prepared to go beyond pressing the Shaikh to agree to the appointment of a British oT British Indian Customs director, and that such an appointment was t o be regarded not as effecting in itself a complete solution of this complex problem, but as an indispensable part of any eventual solution*, I added that it was hardly feasible to expect His m ajesty’s Government to accept all the proposals of the Iraqi Government as affording the only bases of settlement. If their mediation was to be effect ive it must take full account of practical possibilities. On the one hand they wished to be reasonably certain that the proposals put to the Shaikh would be such as might be accepted by him without loss of sovereignty* On the other, if the Shaikh did accept them, there must be an assurance that they would not be rejected by the Iraqi Government as being insufficient* 3, I want on to tell His Excellency that I would be perfectly frank with him. There was an uneasy feeling in London, which Is c onfes sed l lght Hon °urafcle Sir John Si imon, ff. c&gt;s•» •Hj N i! ^ aQ 1 ^1|| v °^i ii f Itej; oJp 83^3“ 31; iilli iiim , .oil ral 5 islji: : : 03 B 1 ^), ■ 33 oiiili jiiii sail o?ll! «! f] jlS ^35 ; Mi ^ ] Jp!‘! 13 i: ( 1J70S11 .j m 0^' jfH« ‘ | iii iN'i confcsged to having shared, that the proposals which had been put forward by the advisers to the Iraqi Government, though possibly reasonable from the purely technical pointof view, were in fact very drastic and were not such as could be put to the Shaikh with any great hope of free acceptance by him. I would, I said, go even further. These proposals might, indeed, be represented as being a cloak: for aggressive political designs on the part of Iraq which would be wholly incompatible with the sovereignty of Kuwait, the infringement of which His Majesty’s Government could clearly net admit. Very real apprehensions had been felt on this score which it would be difficult to dispel, and I should have to have proof of Iraq’s good intentions before 1 could suggest to His Majesty’s Government any deviation from the path w r hich they considered it « feasible to follow* 4. In reply, Uuri Pasha asked me t o reflect on the events of the past three years. I could make enquiries where I would in Iraq. I would find no hostility whatever towards the Shaikh or his people* On-the contrary, he was a brother Prab, with whom Iraq wished to live in harmony and friendly co-operation. I might rest assured that Iraq had no political designs on the Shaikhdom. The Iraqi Government fully realised the Shaikh’s defficulties and had no wish to force him into a corne^r. It was for this reason that$i 4in spite of many rebuffs, they had persisted for two years in Jo&amp;king friendly approach- i es to him with a view to deal, at the centre, with what amounted to an intolerable abuse, rather than to apply external palliatives or to indulge in unilateral repressive measures. But the method of direct approach had failed and they had appealed to His Majesty’s Government t' both as their ally and as the Shaikhs protector, to use their influence with him in the|interests of good neighbourly relations. No one regretted more than he the occasions on which His Majesty’s Embassy had had to proteet against incidents in which Kuwaitis had lost their lives. He asked me t o believe that these were sporadic events incidental to the existing situation along the land and water frontier^ and that they were no indication whatever of the policy of the3 - the Iraqi Government. As he had said, Iraq had no disigns on Kuwait, aggressive or otherwise. &amp;he had quite enough $o do to keep order in her own territory, and it was precisely because the Iraqi u overnment earnestly wished to avoid bloodshed and un necessary expense that they had finally asked His ^ajesty’s Govern ment to intervene. They had no wish to be arbitrary. All they wanted was a practical solution. They did not come to His Majesty f s Government as plaintiffs but as suppliants, asking for the application of an effective remedy designed to put an end quickly t o a. situation whichm if allowed to continue, might weil become very dangerous - and not to the ^haikh alone. I 5. Huri Pasha admitted that it was quite legitiim&amp;te toargue that, as the a ctual smuggling was done mainly by Iraqis and was probably financed and organised by them, acjLion should more properly be taken in Iraq. But the fre fact remained that if Kuwait did not import ten times more of certain commodities than she could possibly consume, there would be nothing to smuggle, and the Iraqi Government were convinced that the only satisfactory way to put an end to the present mix. situation, which v/as causing the complete stagnation of lawful trade in certain parts of the country, was by concluding i I an agreement with theShaikh which would have the effect of reducing the ( I quantity of imports in question. The adoption of other methods - even a strict blockade - would not be effective, given the peculiarly difficult nature of t|ie frontier. Ibn G au d, himself, for all his drastic methods, ad not been succesrful.* The situation was more diff' -icult for Iraq, since if she proceeded to take extreme measures, it might either (a) bring her into conflict with Ibn Gaud, or (b) result in an agreement with him at the expense of Kuwait. In ordinary circumstances the Ghaikh could, if he wished, effect a reduction of his excess imports by raising his duties to a level commensurate wdth those in neighbouring states. But he was precluded from doing this by his agreements with His ^ajesty’s Government, who were thus unable to recommend action on these lines. The proposals put forward by —the *This seems to be borne out by Sir Andrew Ryan’s telegram No.38 of February 21 st.- 4 - f!I J! n ' ; 'T 1 tbe Iraqi Government were therefore designed to secure the Shaikh's agreement to a measure of restriction of certain imports, and the Iraqi Government were willing to arrange that, subject of course, to certain conditions, he should not be loser financially, Where, Y:e asked, could I see in these proposals, hostility, unfairness or aggressive designs ? He was at a loss to understand whence the apprehension of His ^ajesty’s Government arose, but, in order to give me an opportunity to judge for myself, he would like a meeting called at His ^ajesty’s Embassy at which ell concerned could state their views openly and without ^nteerve* 6* Ho time was lost in convening this meeting* The following were present in addition to His Hxcellcncy, Mr. Bateman end n^yself* The Minister £«of Finance and the Adviser to the Ministry (Mr a Hogg ); the Iraqi Direct or-General cf Customs (Mr. Ibrahim Hemal) and the Inspector-G en eral (Mr. Sievwright); Mr.Swan, who will take Mr. Sievwrightts place in June next, was also present* 7* I need not trouble you with details of the ensuing discuss ion, which was conducted throughout in a manner which satisfied me that the Iraqi Government were genuinely anxious to put an end to tin existing situation with the least embarrassment to His Majesty’s ■! Government, the shaikh or to themselves. I was impressed by the lucid and reasonable way in which they put their points and I confe ss that the meeting left me grtvely doubting whether many of yoga apprehensions had any basis in fact* l M 8. I opened the discussion in the same way as I had done in my talk with Huri Pasha, that is to say by reading the material extracts from your despatch under reference* After An allusion to the existing fear of ulterior motives and to the apparent need for caution, I called for comments. The first came from the Iraqi -Girector—General of Customs and was stpprecative of tne extreme &lt; care with which His Majesty’s Government were approaching this question, end of their offer of mediation. The second (from the it appeared Adviser to the Ministry of finance) was to the effect that/tfaadtt\ &gt;e essential, if H'M.G.were to avoid being placed in an inviduoAs posi ion | iheir mediation should be effective. Otherwise, the -haikh would be able « to plead that he was no lo n ger the only factor to be consideredIn that case a certain measure of indirect responsibility for the continuance of smuggling would attach to His Majesty’s Governments This should be avoided at all costs and that was why the Iraqi Government hesitated to accept what appeared to be half measures, which, in their view, would be no remedy at all. 9. All the Iraq representatives agreed that the appointment of a customs director must be a sine qua non of a settlement^ They could not agree, however, that, if such a director were appointed, he would, to use the words of your despatch, r naturad.lv 4 have the administrative sanction of the Shaikh behind him*. This was an assumption which they were not prepared to admit* •‘ ■ he actual points should, they considered, be put to the Shaikh, If he were willing to give the Customs director powers other than those usually vested in such an official, he would have gone a long w&amp;y towards the cooperation which the Iraqi Government desired. They thought that, at the time when he was pressed to appoint the G us toms Director, he should be asked to give him authority to take restrictive measures if, as a result of the consultations envisaged in your telegrams on this subject, such measures were seen to be essential to put a stop to smugglings 10. This appeared to me to be reasonable. It is the function of Governments, not of th^er employees, to sanction measures such as raising or lowering customs tariffs, or impspjing restrictions on imports and exports, Thus, unless the Shaikh can be induced it intimate his assent to the grant of special powers to the proposed Customs -Gi rec tor, the appointment will hold out no prospect of a refiuctionof those imports which can only be destined for illicit export to Iraq and els^here. I venture, therefore, to suggest that your proposals whould be reexamined in this light. 11* One other point which emerged during the discussion was the foil owing. 12. The Iraqi Government realise that measures intended to check smuggling, by reducing excess imports, will involve the Shaikh in a loss of revenue. Provided they are not asked to make this good per s e - which would be. t/fcntamouht, in their view, to admittingadmitting the principle that persons who defraud the revenue are entitled to compensation if only thier efforts are wide and successful enough - they are anxious to give their assent to any measures which would afford to the Shaikh an opportunity for making good, within reason, the revenue which he will^Lose if their proposals are applied. fhey will, for example, bear part at least of the salaries of the Customs -Director and his staff (provided they have sufficient power to take effective action) and will help to defray the cost of any other preventive measures which the Shaikh may set on foot. In other words, they will pay the Shaikh for any positive steps which he consents to ts.ke, and I gathered that payment could be made in such a way as to leave the Shaikh a good margin of profit on the transaction. &lt;vhat the Iraqi Government envisage is that he «.fec should, in addition to x&amp;xxxtxxzx appointing a fully empowered Customs Director, agree to the establishment of a small preventive force which would work under either the Customs director or a specially appointed British Officer, and in harmony with the Iraq Preventive Service. If His ~aj esty * s Government could see their way to agree to this in principle, details of the methods to be adopted might well be left for for future discussion. In that event, I 'Venture to express the hope that any particular method which may promese to be desirable would not be t^n ruled out on a prior* grounds. If the Shaikh is willing to co operate in these directions, the Iraqi ^Ivernment see no difficulty in giving him pecuniary satisfaction , which will, in effect, take the form of § concealed subsidy. 13. Nuri Pasha took no part in the discussi on except towards the end, when he pointed ofct that His ^ajesty^ Government, although actuated by the best of motives, had so far only examined the Possibility of mediation. Nothing had yet been actually said to the Shaikh and meanwhile the latest figures showed that smuggling from Kuwait was increasing at an alarming rate and in almost geometric progression. Proposals for gradul&amp;^action. therefore, seemed to be wide of the mark and he earnestly trusted that, on re-examinating the Position, His iw ajesty * s Government would see their way to intervene withi ^ ;-{ , ADiSl; ansi} ji i a 1 1 /Sjo - 7 - the Shaikh, not on a piece meal basis, which would involve mu«h . 105;g, of time, but in the way which offered the best promise of producing results. £he Iraqi Government, he said, ma&amp;e no claims on His Majesty’s Government or threats against the Shaikh. *hey kneu that in the last resort, the onus of responsibility for preventing t3» r ent&lt;^ into Iratf of illicit goods rested upon tj-em, antj failing the good offices of His ' i ajesty t s Government, they would have to take energetic action if only to meet the growing criticism of the Iraq public. They had deferred taking such action during thflast eighteen months ,icK partly because they wished to avoid complications with the Shaikh and possibly with Saudi-Ara bia, but mainly because they w-ei were advised by His Majesty’s Government to avoid drastic unilateral mea sure s. 14. 1 am aware that the above adds little to the information alre ady furnished by my predecessor on this subject. But my conversation: -s on the whole subject have served to clear my own mind of many of *t? the irrelevancies wfe* with which the correspondence on this aaatter seems D 15. as it 15-i t- 1 ' It is should j fll 16. id P' 1 -'- way. ( if f i A)e are the Shaikh’s protectors. (2) We must safeguard his **T sovereignty and his legitimate interests (3) But at present the whole economy of his domain rests, for a variety of reasons, s^lqiost entirely pm t j e~~ o: : oc ot activities of his people. Phis, T understand, is free, acknowledged. We can no morejtountenance smuggling from Kuwait than we csn from other parts of the world where our influence prevails. On the other hand, we/ arethe ally of Iraq. Iraq is suffering acutely from the activities of our protege and, curbing her growing impatience, has asked for our of i ices, -difficult as mediation may be,we are in a unique position to undertake it. To shirk the responsibility of doi^g so may, in the circumstances,circumstances ,undermine the whole structure on which our treaty relations are based, 17. It would appear, therefore, that if purely political considerations enter into the calculation at all, there is as mnc much to be said for the one side as there is for the other and that the test should be not whether the present proposals of the Iraqi Government are politically expedient, but whether they \ are reasonable and practical. 1 think it is true to sa/ that Kuwait’s economic interest will suffer whether Iraq takes unilateral action (in which event the excess imports will find- little if any egress tJBxaca 5 ±x±Kx«J 6 iiakxx*iXiSHX 3 ixkitxki*xixa^i Sjsxxxxjemc* and will have to be cut down) or whether the Shaikh agrees toa ct in collaboration with the Iraqi Government. In the first event he will have nothing on the credit side r of the balance and will probably have to face alone the disconten of his people. In the second, he will at least have some financial compensation, the good-will both ol n is Majesty s Government and the Iraq Goverrment, and the consequent /ipos si bility of an increase in the legitimate trade of Kuwait. 18. It may well be that the Shaikh, however he be approached, will elect to continue to run the gauntlet on the assumption that in no circumstances would measures taken by Iraq alone be adequate. I have not yet seen enough of this country to say whether or not he would be fair to himself if he decided to act on these lines. But I would regard such a decision as most unfortunate and as being bound to poison his foreign relationships, with consequent embarrassment to His Majesty’s Government . 19. In conclusion I would only sdd that the question of making ansctual approach to the Shaikh is one oi gre^t urgency. 20 ./20. 1 sm sending copies of this desptck to the Government of India, His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humbii servant, id.

Ha esae straight from Bagdad and called on me on arrival, with Syed Abdur nahtaan al Kaqib, his causin and one Yusuf si Salim a veil-known resident of ^asra. 3. Though Syed Hamid Beg's visit vas, he assured me, quite of an informal nature, (he had mly come a area, he said, to see sister who is married to the shaikh's son) he early on started discussing the Shaikh's Bate gardens question, and the Iraq Government's smuggling accusations against Kuwait* i 4. AS dyed Hamid is a very influential deputy in the Iraq Parli&amp;asnt, as his opinions count for soasthing in Bagdad, I think it worth while reporting the gist of ghat hs said, as it shows L et there is a good deal of informative and influential opinion in Iraq, which sees tbs Shaikh of Kuwait’s point of view and is out for just *nd conciliatory mothods. 5 . so regards the gate 3yed . grid's views wore as follows j- (a) He deplored the way in which the Iraq Government had deliberately gone out to persecute the Shaikh durn^ the last four years, and considarod such methods the worst f Q rm of diplomatic tactics LAt his country co .la hr. * undertaken - Kuwait, he said, was Iraq's near and good neighbour /f -2~ neighbour and was ruled by a high spirited ana proud .rab of ancient lineage y and his country Iratj ought to have iaiown better than 'to drive a spear into shaikh ahmad’s heart' (Ms words), and so deeply wound him as to make it almost impossible to recover lost ground or ever discuss any minor disputes which arose, in friendly maimer again# (b) Iraq 1 s whole quarrel was really with His J^gesty** Government and not with Kuwait, and ©lie ou 4 ht, instead of attempting to take the law into her own hands, and force date garden revenue out of the Shaikh, to have held her hand where Kuwait was concerned and carried the wan are to London Kuwait's good-will and friendship she should have cultivated from the first. Her obvious line was to have given an ultimatum to His Majesty's Government 4 years ago and warn her that if within say a definite period of time, she (His Majesty's Govern ment) did not pay Kuwait's garden taxes herself and incidentally honour her pledges to Kuwait by so doing, she (Iraq) would most reluctantly have to take steps to recover same airect# this course, said Gyed Humid Beg, would at any rate not have made an 'enemy' of the Jbaikh of Kuwait* (c) Clearly, continued dyed Hamid Beg, the Bhaikh hmx been deeply wounded by Iraq's stupid end bullying action, and the smuggling question had been rendereu ten ti^e© more difficult of settlement in consequence, for to use a slung expression 'the Shaikh was justifiably trying to get his own back'.

Establishment of close liaison between Koweit and Iraqi customs directorates should moreover be possible without derogation from Shaikh*® sovereignty* (b) Establishment of Iraqi control on land frontier as suggested above in which Shaikh would co-operate by Instituting system of manifests for land export.

I observe from paragraphs 2 and 5 (b) of Foreign Office telegram just quoted that, in spite of the arguments put forward in my Express Letter Ho. 554-3 of 30th April, (particularly those contained in paragraph© 2 (a), (c), (e), (h) and (j), His Majesty* Government are apparently still prepared in certain eventualities■fcO lbyill|&lt;£ pi*OSSllI*6 Oil 'tllG OilutiKLH 'to 8.CC0 &lt;aO t/O till© X 1*0.0 Ck) YQVTUIlQI x' t * s proposals* It appears to ne that mediation or advice, even strong advice, is one tiling, and pressure is quite another, and I venture once more to point out that the effect 02 ? any such pressure on our prestige, in Kuwait particularly, and in the Persian Gulf generally, would be most unfortunate. In view of the fact that there is no legal obligation on the Shaikh to co-operate with the Iraq Govern ment and that British interests are not involved, it would be said, not only by the Shaikh of Kuwait and his people, but by the other Shaikhs of the Gulf (who will certainly hear of it), that for the benefit of Iraq, a (comparatively} large and independent rower. His Majesty f s Government had forced a certain line of action on Kuwait, a small shaikh&amp;om which is under our protection. moreover, the whole position of His Majesty’s Government in this matter of 'pressure' on the Shaikh is, in my opinion, considerably weakened by the fact that His Majesty’s Government - through no fault of their own - have been unable to implement their promises to the Shaikh with regard to the date 'gardens and Ibn Sand’s blockade. I fear that mention of pressure from Hie Majesty’s Government with regard to smuggling, will merely draw from the Shaikh the not illog ical reply that His Majesty’s Government’s pressure should be brou^it to bear first on Iraq to adjust the question of the date gardens, and of the incursions and outrages of the Iraqi Customs officials (for which so far no reparation has been forthcoming from the Iraq Government), and on Ibn Baud to raise the blockade. 3. Further, I do not see what pressure His Majesty’s Government can bring to bear on the Shaikh beyond a more or less direct order that he should take this or that line of action in acceding to the Iraqi proposals and, if he should refuse to obey this order, which is not improbable (since legally he is not compelled to co-operate wit.':, the Iraq Government over the smuggling), I do not see what measuresmeasures His Majesty’s Government can take to enforce their com- ssyiG.s • w 1 iX trie.' i iiave a clepiomoie si tuo. tiori on our hajicis • i&amp; will the full otli T&amp;;i of t&gt;x^/ in^ to orin^ pressure to bear on the Shaikh, the latter with the popular backing of his people will suecesei*ally have defied Hie Majesty 1 a Qoverasent, and all no result since the Irakis —* His iaaJesty f s Govermaent*® prea- sure having failed - will then proceed to institute their blockade* On the other hand, if His l-.aiesty f s Ck&gt;vemaent will stop at strong advice, no such situation can arise, and I urge most earnestly that, on further consideration, they will abandon any idea of pressure* Vis-lt-vis the I rag Govenment, His Majesty’s Government **• it will be observed - are not committed to pressure; the terns used in paragraph 3 of the Embassy letter to the Iraq Government referred to above are that His Majesty’s Government are prepared ?l to urge the Shaikh strongly^*(111/45/35). British Embassy, Bagdad. 85rd May, 1935. My dear Colonel, I enclose herewith copy of the letter which I handed to His Excellency Yasin Pasha this morning and which formed the basis of the discussion at which you were present. His Excellency, as you are aware, agreed that so far as concerns the Iraqi Government, the Shaikh of Kuwait may now be approached on the lines proposed. I will send you his written confirmation in due course. r The condition set out in the India Office telegram of May 21st (Ho.1581) has therefore been fulfilled and the way is clear for you to make representations to the Shaikh. If you succeed in getting him to agree in principle, it will only remain to fix the time and place at which the conference is to take place. You will, of course, keep us informed of all developments. Yours very sincerely, (Sgd.) C.H. BATEMAN LI EU TENANT -CO LON EL T.C.W. FOWLE, C.B.E.No* 264 British Embassy, Bagdad, 23rd May, 1935. My dear Minister, Your Excellency is no doubt aware that towards the end of last year, His Excellency Huri Pasha suggested to Sir Francis Humphrys that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom should be requested, as protectors of Kwait, to examine the possibility of making appropriate representations to the Ruler of Kuwait with a view to enlist his co-operation in an effort to put an end to the smuggling of certain commodities into Iraq. For some two years idle Iraqi Government had endeavoured unsuccessfully to reach agreement with the Shaikh on this matter. 2. Sir Francis Humphrys acted promptly on Nuri Pasha’s suggestion and for the past few months the question of smuggling from Kuwait has formed the subject of most earnest consideration, not only by His Majesty’s Government but also by His Majesty’s Embassy in discussion with the heads and advisers of the competent departments of the Iraqi Government and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 3. I now have pleasure in informing Your Excellency that His Majesty’s Government are prepared to use their good offices and to urge the shaikh strongly to accept a solution of the present difficulties on bases approximating to those which emerged from the discussions mentioned above. 4. These bases may be briefly and generally summarised as follows (l) The appointment of a British Customs Director at Kuwait irith special powers (not excluding the possibility ox restricting is Excellency Yasin Pasha al Hashimi, Ao Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, BAGDAD.- 2 - restrieting the import of certain commodities), who would work in close liaison with the Iraqi Customs authorities and the Political Agent at Kuwait. (2) The co-operation of the Shaikh of Kuwait in making effective a frontier control and customs cordon system to he set up hy the Iraqi Government. 5. In order that the problem may he adequately considered in all its aspects, and details worked out with a view to arrive at a satisfactory solution to all concerned, His Majesty’s Government propose that a conference, presided over hy the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, he called at a very early date at some convenient place at which the Iraqi Government and the Shaikh of Kuwait would he represented. G. If the Iraqi Government are in general agreement with this proposal and are prepared not to insist on any particular solution pending the result of the conference, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (who is at present in Bagdad and will leave on May 25th) will make the necessary representations to ihe Shaikh of Kuwait in the very near future. 7. The Political Resident will he available to preside over such a conference at some time between Juae 9th and June 16th next. 8. I shall he glad to learn as soon as possible whether Your Excellency agrees to this proposed procedure. I avail myself of this opportunity to express to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration. (For His Majesty’s Ambassador). (Sgd.) C.H.

Bri t i sh Embas sy, Ba^ida d. 24th May 1955. 4 /f You will have gathered from my Express Letter of today on the subject of Kuwait-Iraq Smuggling that I am distinctly perturbed that His Majesty 1 s Government, in spite of all my argumen ts to the contrary, still cling to the idea in certain eventualities' of bringing pressure to bear on the Shaikh. His Majesty’s Govern ment acknowledge that legally the Shaikh can refuse to co-operate with the Iraqis, yet at the same time they propose to bring pressure on him to do sol This seems to me an extraordinary line of policy. I do not know if His Majesty’s Government still think that, should the Iraqi blockade be established, they - His Majesty’s Government - will have responsi bility for removing it. Most certainly they will not . We will have given the Shaikh advice and he will have disregarded it, and he must then take the consequences I am sendirg a copy of this letter to Metcalfe. Sd. T.C.W.

(b) The system of manifests by land. (o) Formation of preventive service by Shaikh. (d) IRAQ Government paying for total cost of (a)(b)(c) above.

Now IRAQ had followed suit. (2) . Kuwait had no crops or any manufactures and only produced grass. Her 100,000 inhabitants must live. If licit means are denied she must resort to illicit trade to find money to buy gajatx food and clothing from overseas. (3) # IRAQ is demanding that Kuwait either appoint British Customs Officer with widest powers, on purpose to stop all trade with interior, which ipso facto would mean smuggling with Nejd also, or accept Blockade by land and sea. (4) * In either case Kuwait is faced with grevious injury. But it is preferable to be killed with honour than commit suicide with dishonour. Therefore with deep regret Sheikh * was forced to decide in favour of being blockaded. All he asked was that H.M.G safeguard the produce of his gardens and his peoples drinking water. tSix Matter was one of absolute life and death for Kuwait. (5) . Director and H.M.G’s other proposals for the following vital reasons:- (a) Kuv/ait would definitely loose all her trade with the interior, because this would be Director of Customs duty to arrange. (b) The whole Arab world would understand that Kuwait had surrendered to Iraq and so become a vassal of her£ (c) He, Sheikh, would be a looked upon as a traitor by his family, and all people of Kuwait, and would be £!££ execrated, and possibly deposed and killed. (d) Bin Saud would make anivax immense capital of his surrender to Ira^, and would point out to all and sundry that It impossibel e for him to accept a British Customspage. 2, y / ( that when he asked for a Muslim representative to reside in Kuwait to collect his transit dues, both $ the Sheikh and H.M.G had refused as it would have been interpretted as placing ) Kuwait under the control of Nejd-.Sheikh had now under pressure of H.M.G, accepted a Christian Director of Customs, with widest powers and paid by Iraq. The inference was obvious. (e) With Kuwait trade gohe, and the ^heikh a traitor to the people, there would be an exodus from Kuwait of the leading citizens, merchants, and notables- all would desert the ^heikh and 'Hajir^'. ed (7J• The Sheikh therefore appeal^ to the Viceroy and begged him to judge the situation according to justice* Iraq had no legal right to behave as she was doing. Why then was she supported by H.M.G. Though a small State, Kuwait honour stood high in Arabia. He the Sheikh would rather die than prostitute his peoples honour. He believed that H.M.G^is knew something of honour when she went to Belgium’s assistance. He further begged that his appeal would be forwarded to His Majesty’s Government in London.From - Political, Kuwait. To - Resident H.M.S. Bideford, Bushire Radio. No - 164.
