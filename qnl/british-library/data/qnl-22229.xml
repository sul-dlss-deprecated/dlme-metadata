This food was stored in Bahrein firstly, because we wished to have a supply from which we could draw in the event conditions in Saudi Arabia made it necessary for our staff personnel to evacuate, and secondly, because we had ordered quantities of food in excess of the six months supply that is customarily carried in our stores, and we desired a substantial build ing in which to store it. The Bahrein Government was kind enough to allow us to store this food in bond. No time limit was fixed for the period of storage, but it was intended to make withdrawals for delivery to A1 Khobar when the supplies on this side became exhausted, or if it became necessary for our people to take temporary refuge in Bahrein. Some of these supplies have been withdrawn to replenish stocks on this side, and also to consume certain foods that might spoil if kept too long. We now have in Bahrein under thirty days free bond, a supply of foodstuffs which arrived three weeks ago. We would appreciate it if these new supplies could be placed in storage under the same arrangement as for the first cache, since they are replacements for that which has been withdrawn. The supplies would be stored in the building known as the 'Farook Building', which was used previously and which is under lease to my Company. Arrangements for the first storage priviledge were made verbally with and through Mr. Weightman. No correspondence was exchanged by the Political Agent and the Company on the subject, and therefore, there is none to which I can refer you. Will you kindly advise me if the arrangements requested herein can be made, and the steps to be takent &gt;■ - 2 - by my Company to make them. The period of free bond for the new shipment expires September 28, but I assume that this can be extended for another thirty or sixty days through the customary channels of the Bahrein Government.

THE CUSTOMHOUSE: BAHRAIN: 25th September, 1940., 23rd Sha*ban, 1359., A-e, To: - H.B.M’s Political Agent, BAHRAIN: MEMORANDUM 1^ In acknowledging the receipt of your copy No:C/731-10/5 of the 23-9-40., with its enclosure, it is not at the moment quite clear to me if this arrangement should be submitted for the Advise Adviser's sanction. Perhaps you will very kindly inform me. In the meanwhile, might I, with deference, remark: (a) I understood from the Adviser that the special arrangement manctioned last autumn was a war emergency measure only, and not to constitute a precedent, as Mr Ohliger appears to regard it. I mention this point as the Customs had to forego a definite amount of collectable revenue. (b)ln view of the recent Notice No:G/25/553, copy of) which is enclosed, dated 1st Sha'ban, 1359, it might be thought that Mr Ohliger is in error in referring to 'thirty days free bond' as the original re-export period of twenty days has been extended to ninety days. This extension was made for the purpose of facilitating the storage in Customs' charge of cargo which the importer might, later on, wish to export; and to enable him ultimately to pay only the reduced rate of two per cent ad valorem, please.

Dear ^ilban, I am writing on the subject of California Arabian Standard Oil Company’s imports to Saoudi Arabia through Bahrain which we spoke about some time ago. a.t the beginning of the war the Company’s representative called on me and explained that as an emergency measure the company wished to lay in a quantity of foodstuff, mostly American tinned goods, to supply the company’s employees in case that a shortage of food should occur. They had no suitable storage facilities at al Khobar and asked, as a special case, that they should be allowed to keep their stores in Manamah and to send over supplies from time to time when the need occurred. I agreed to this request because at that time I thought there might be difficulty in bringing stores to Bahrain. It was definitely an emergency measure and there was no correspondence with the company on the subject. Last august the company again asked permission to import 7000 cases of new food from a ship then in the port of Ras Tanura in Saudi Arabia. The company was given permission to import these stores and to store them outside customs premises for thirty days on the understanding that if during this time the optional export period was extended this import would be subject to any additional periodperiod that should be decided upon. The question of increasing the period was at this time under consideration and was being discussed with His Highness and the Hhaikhs. The thirty days period was extended to ninety days in order to help all traders, not especially for the benefit of the California Arabian otandard Oil Company. Both times when the company imported supplies it paid only Hjo customs duty on its imports as if there had been overside delivery, from the steamer to dhow. .at the expiry of 90 days the import is no longer re-exportable at 2$ ad valorem but becomes a normal import on which 5^ customs duty is due. In my opinion there is now no need to regard the food situation as so critical that the Bahrain government should waive the regular customs pro cedure and payment. The company is at liberty to import its supplies direct to Saudi Arabia, as is frequently done, or to import them through Bahrain, re-exporting them within 90 days on payment of 2$ or the company can import goods into Bahrain in the normal way and pay full duty and obtain a refund on re-export in ninety days. The fact that it is more convenient for the company to keep its stores in Man amah cannot be recognised as a valid reason for exemption from the duty which is normally charged. Other firms, including Messrs. African andI t&lt;5) J1 -3- and Eastern Limited, a British trading company with an agency here, asked for similar concessions which have been refused. Yours sincerely, r\ Major R. G. E. W. ^Iban, H.B.M’s Political Agent, Bahrain.
