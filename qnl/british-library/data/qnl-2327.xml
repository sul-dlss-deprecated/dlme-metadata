CHARLTON. Cabinet Office, S.'/,l 4 , 11TH JULY, 1947.-1- COPY ANNEX XXX It would much assist us in the Ministry of Civil Aviation, in the planning of future air services, to have some official guidance on the desirability of developing our air services to the Far East - e.g. the political and commercial interests, the traffic likely to he found and promoted there and the particular value of it. The suggestion has been made ohat my best .source of guidance is the Far East (Official) Committee, and I am-putting the subject briefly to you in this letter. Since post-war air transport has been considered it has been contemplated that B.O.A.C., the Corporation concerned with the area, will run a trunk service through India to China, serving Hong Kong and some services going on to Japan. Resources are limited and particularly in the near future v/e have to consider on what routes all over the world they ere best used. The commercial aspect oj. profitability io factor. At the moment B.O.A.C. run a flying boat twice weekly from the United Kingdom through Rangoon and Bangkok to Hong Kong. Marine facilities exist at Rangoon and Bangkok; the}, determine the flying boat route. In the recent Air Transport Agreement with China_we have obtained rights to operate to (a) Shanghai T i?2||^itios (b) Shanghai and on to Japan. Wo may ha^ some diificu-tie.^ at whatever frequency we decide. Up to the present ; . 0 .w, 0 . na-. will'not^be' 1 ' avalloble^or! sayf two'years.' When ^ey are available the service would be dependent on ground facilities in in.ermeu service wuuiu . * obligation of Member States of I.C.A.o. territories. It lotho oblige^ . nternationnl aviat ion, but the’re 0 is no c^tainty when individual Member States will do do: In general, airports in China re poor. A medium stage land-plane service wo ^ d t '° r '^^ t r a n through Hanoi to Hong Kong and onwards, .-t the moment^an adequate prodrome does^no^exist ^Hanoi^ ( P &gt;g&gt; 1952 ) arfoxpross service could ^ clally ofsuchAongefltagos/fhfquestion of the economy of operation would have to be carefully considered. r. a a general statement on ground facilities, flying boat oporatfonsire possible now; the l^d-plane mat wait a bit. and it is impossible to predict &lt;&lt; cu,. *.In considering potential traffic, freight as well as the various classes of passenger — oificioj., business, tourist — must he considered. I need not here put out a thesis on the use of air transport for freight. To a large extent it depends on the products of the area and their suitability for carriage by air/ But there are general factors such as that air transport saves expense in packaging, reduces the need for large stocks of tools. There is a subsidiary question of whether it is desirable to open flying boat operations in the South China Seas. There will be local colonial air lines operating 'regionally' from Hong Kong and Singapore. But B.O.A.C. should not be debarred from having a share in the traffic of the area. At present they are operating a v/eexly flying boat between oingapore and Hong Kong via Bangkok. It has been contemplated that this service should be extended to run through Hong Kong, Manila, Sarawak, North Borneo and Singapore. We have been pressed to put on the latter service particularly to provide communications for the Colonies, but up to dace lack of resources has made this impossible. My basic question is whether there is likely to be a traffic potential in the area, including, of course, Saigon and the Netherlands kast Indies, when conditions are settled. Obviously Australia will be^ interested; its Company will no doubt operate regularly in a few years’ time from Australia through Manila to Hong Kong. The existing trunk service from the United Kingdom to _ Australia, operated by United Kingdom and Australian air lines, runs between Singapore and Darwin. Various charter companies operate from the Philippines. There is probably a good field for that sort of work, but current operations have been facilitated by war surplus equipment and. in the long run not all the existing operators are likely to survive. In all this we have to look ahead owing to the time of construction of aircraft and airports. But if the prospects- are good we should be progressively building up services so that the traffic does not all get into the hands of the lines of other countries. The Americans are, of course, active in the area; the French, Dutch and Philippines operate: South Americans and Mexico may enter the field some time. XXX M.E.

The information given in Appendix 'B' to this Summary (Indian Aviation / 3P) Services) supersedes that contained in Appendix ’'D' to Eastern Sumary N0.1, / China 63. The United Kingdom Mission led by Sir John Baldwin arrived in China at the beginning of February. The negotiations as outlined in Sumary N0.1 have been protracted, but have resulted in a draft bilateral agreement on Chicago lines. Full details will be published in Sumary NO.3. 6A. As the result of several accidents early in the year, C.N.A.C, and C. A.T.C. passenger services were suspended on two occasions for long periods. 65 . In addition to the accidents reported in the foregoing paragraph the Chinese Air Force A.T.C. suffered tv/o serious Dakota crashes in February. The newly-created Chinese Civil Aeronautics Administration affirmed that these crashes were mainly due to (a) unexpected weather deteriorations. (b) defective equipment. (c) lack of ground facilities and navigational aids due to financial troubles. (d) rapid expansion of civil aviation bringing about over-loaded ground c ornmuni cations. 66. From Kunming it is learned that C.N.A.C. during February inaugurated a new weekly passenger service between Calcutta and Hong Kong, via Kunming, using D. C.4 (Skymasters) carrying 44 passengers, 67. Major General Chennault T s 'C.N.R.R.A.' Air Service has acquired 3 C.47 aircraft and South West Aviation Corporation has acquired 50 aircraft (20 serviceable) together with 5 C.4?s for services operating from Canton. 68 . According to the Civil Air Attache, Washington, the Chinese Civil aeronautics administration are at present studying a plan for modernising China 1 s civil airways - estimated to cost # 150 million. The C.C.A.A, are at present hampered by lack of funds, but have drawn up plans to set up two main airlines to operate;- /(i) CIV. 10671- 2 - civ. 10671 (i) Peiping - Tientsin - Tsingtao - Shanghai - Canton. (ii) Shanghai - Nanking - Kinlciang - Hankav - Chungking, thence branching off to connect with Chengtu and Kunming in the South West. Plans envisage a modern system of radar equipment, a new chain of radio stations and improved meteorological facilities. If Government funds arc available, these air services are expected to be in operation within a year, 69, Pan ^meriean Airways have applied to the Civil aeronautics Board for permission to operate a non-stop service between Guam and Shanghai (1900 miles). A proving flight over the route was carried out in March. 70, C'ap^dn Geoffrey Wickner's Halifax aircraft, 'Waltzing Matilda' which he flew from England to Australia last year, has, it is reported by 'Plight', been purchased by Air Carriers who are opening a special air freight service between Australia and China, via Java. 71* Trans-World Airlines plan to expand their present U.S. - Europe - India route from Bombay to Mandalay - Hanoi - Canton - Shanghai by 1st May. At Shanghai it will connect with North West Airline*s North Pacific route from the U.S. which is to be opened shortly. Philippine Commonwealth 72. It is reported that T.W.A. is planning to sell its interests in the Philippine -irlines. T.W.A. bought 28% of the stock in 1945, and had visions of a round-the-world route with Manila as an intermediate stop. Philippine airlines have since issued additional shares, thus reducing the percentage of T.W.A.’s stock holdings. 73. The frequency Of P.A.A.*s San Francisco - Manila service has been increased from twice to three times weekly. 74. B.O.A.C. are interested in operating to Manila, and their long-term plan is for a South Seas Circular Service from Singapore, Via Borneo and Manila, to Hong Kong and thence back to Singapore, via Siam and Indo-China, It is probable that Cathay Pacific airways will be designated for scheduled services between Hong Kong and Bangkok, and Hong Kong and Manila on the understanding that the arrangement will be reviewed when B.O.^.C. are ready to operate the South China Seas Circular Service. 75* The first students to go to the U.S. under the Philippine Rehabilitation _*ct are 50 recruits who are to be trained as airport control tower staff. Instruction lasting one year in air traffic control will be given at Will Rogers Field and Oklahoma University. 76. The journal 'i*merican 4* viation' of 1st April, 1947, paints a somewhat glowing picture of civil aviation in the .Philippines. The principal features of the report are sunmarised below:- (i) There has been an extraordinary boom in air transport in the Philippines since the war due partly to the disruption of surface travel by the war and partly to the availability of large quantities of surplus aviation material. /(ii)civ. 10671 /81 - 3 - (ii) This increaso in aviation apparently caught the Philippine Republic unaware, as there was no established policy to guide the ^ Government, Recently Colonel Villamore, a war pilot, has been appointed as Director of the new Bureau of Aeronautics at Manila, (iii) a»s an example of the increase in inter-island air traffic, in 1939 only 16,209 passengers were carried as against 290,000 passengers in 1946, Air freight has also increased SOOfa since 1939. (iv) In addition to the two principal airlines (PEATI and PAL) mention is mado of seven other Philippine airlines operating local services in, and international services frcm, Manila, These presumably include Commercial Airlines Inc,, and Trans-J.siatic . • Airlines Inc., to which reference was made in paragraph 21 of Eastern Summary N0.1. No details of the other five companies are available• (v) A warning note, however, is sounded in the statement that most of the Philippine air operations have been begun with surplus U.S. equipment. Whether the services will survive the limited life of the aircraft and spares is a matter for conjecture, 11, The same journal reports 'The Civil aeronautics Administration hopes to begin work soon on a system of air navigation aids and comunications in the Philippine Islands. The C.A.^. is planning a programme to establish a system of communications for inter-island and trans-Pacific air travel,and to train Philippine personnel in/its operation and maintenance. The plans to finish this programme and hand over the system to the Philippine Republic by 1st July, 1930, according to the terns of the Philippine Rehabilitation Act, The C.A.^i, estimates that it will be necessary to establish air navigation and cormunication facilities at thirty airports, and the amount which has been allocated by the U.S. Government for this work is approximately $ 8,000,000.' Thailand 78. The formation of a Siamese subsidiary of Pacific Overseas Airlines Inc. under the name of P.0.~. (Siam) Ltd. was reported in paragraph 1? of Eastern Summary N0.1. This Company has now been put forward in the Siamese application for rights to operate scheduled services between Bangkok - Hong Kong and Bangkok - Singapore. 79. In the meantime the British charter company, Skyways Ltd., is negotiating for the establishment of an Anglo-Siamese Company, 80. In December, 1946, the Americans offered to instal a complete air radio station at a cost of approximately $ 151,000. Possibly influenced by the cost,the Siamese Government have offered to purchase from B.O.A.C. the mainly obsolescent 'civil' apparatus at present loaned by the R.A.E. to B.O.A.C. and operated by the latter on on agency basis for the Siamese Government. Although the Air Ministry are in the process of costing out this equipment, it is felt that its purchase and continued use by the Siamese will not provide a completely satisfactory system. The long terra solution may be for International ..eradio to provide assistance. It is hoped that this would be practicable.- 4 - civ. 10671 French Indo-China 81. There is nothing further to report. ^ Netherlands East Indies 82. The Swedish Press announced that the Dutch steamship companies '’Nederland' and 'Rotterdamsche Lloyd' arc planning to enter civil aviation. The first-mentioned company is reported to be taking delivery during the next few months of four Constellations, four D.C.4 and four Boeing-Stratoliner aircraft from the U.3, K.L.M. (Royal Dutch airlines) have found it necessary to increase the frequency of their service to the N.E.I., which they operate on behalf of the Netherlands Government, from four to five times weekly. The necessity for this increase is emphasized in the Swedish report that there is a waiting list of 5&gt;000 persons wishing to travel to the N.E*I. and that 8,000 persons arc wishing to return heme. It is also reported that there are 25,000 evacuees in Holland awaiting repatriation to the East Indies. India 83. The following notes hav. been taken from a report from the Director General of Civil .aviation. New Delhi, for the half year ended 31st December, 1946. 4ir Services On the 1st January, 1947, fifteen air services were operating over fourteen routes totalling 10,570 miles. Details of the routes flown are given in appendix B to this Summary. The miles flown increased from 1,652,000 in the first half of the year to 2 , 869,000 in the second half, and the freight mileage from three to five and a half million ton miles. The regularity factor was 96 . 6^0 as compared with 97*1$ in the first half of the year, 4n average load factor of 76 ^ over all the services was maintained throughout the year. Except on certain short stage flights passenger fares have been maintained at an average of about &gt;§ ■ annas per mile. &gt;i.ir Transport Licensing Board The Board was re-constituted in September, 1946. The 4ir Tronsport Licensing Rules beca _ operative on the 1st of October when provisional licences were issued for the operation of the air services then in existence. No permanent licences have yet been issued. Following a debate in the Legislative Assembly in November, 1946, the Government of India are reviewing their licensing policy. International ,.ir Transport B.O.A.C. and the C.N.^.C. continue to operate to and through India according to their existing agreements. K.L.M. and t *ir Fronce operated air services across India between Europe and the East for non-commercial purposes only. Following the bilateral air transport agreement concluded in Delhi between India and the U.S.-a. on the 14th November, 1946, the first ..hnerican air service to India was inaugurated on the 5th January, 1947* /I.erodrcmQ- 5 - CIV. 10671 ^Qrodraac and Flyinp; Control ^ Plying control hns boon tnlcon over by the Civil .viation Dircctora'to at five aerodromes, namely Karachi, ^hmedabad, Bombay (Juhu), Lahore (Walton) and Delhi (Safdarjang). aeronautical Radio Service Regional Communication Offices were opened at Delhi, Karachi, Bombay and Madras, Corxiunication facilities and radio navigational aids have been taken over from the iir Force at Karachi Airport, Delhi (Safdar jang), Bombay (Santa Cruz), 4kh::icdabad and Jaharsaguda, 84. In the opening address of the India Civil Aviation Conference held in February, 1947, the Government of India Member for Communications reported an encouiaging increase in 194 b traffic figures, but sounded the warning tint uncontrolled private enterprise would in the long run only achieve its ruin by suicidal competition which it might be necessary to prevent by a ri 'id system of licensing, 35. At a meeting of the Standing advisory Committee of the Posts and Telegraphs Department &lt;nlso held in February, emphasis was laid upon the necessity for establishing a Transport Board which would be free from cam '.unity prejudice. The meeting also concluded that internal should take priority over external services, that the maximum number of Indians should be employed in the expanded Civil Aviation Organisation, that Civil Aviation should'not be tne monopoly of one community or company, and that both Hindus and Moslems should be represented on the Air Transport Board. Burns QG. ^ The reconstruction programme for Burma airfields is at present held up, until the future constitution of the country is decided. Plans for a class 'C airport at Rangoon will, in the meantime, be presented to the Treasury, o/. Burma National airways, whose formation was forshadowed in Eastern Bunnary N0.1 (para. 35 ), have now been granted a monopoly of all internal air services and mail contracts. In the next 12 months the company's plans include tne operation of an extensive system of internal air services to augnent surface transport which was considerably damaged in the war. The large number of landing strips built during the war will facilitate air services to many otherwise inaccessible places. ^rmoi-e, a request by Burma National .airways to operate a service from Rangoon to Singapore, via Bangkok and Penang, has been approved by the Malayan Government on the understanding that, when a Malayan company is ready to operate the Bermuda principles of equitable division of traffic and frequency of services would be applied. Cabotage rights between Singapore and Penang will e reserved subject to later negotiations based on reciprocal rights. Rumours, however, from a reliable source in Burma indicate that plans ■ may be made to form another company in an attempt to break the monopoly over internal services at present accorded to B.N.-w C ey Ion 'j. Tae proposed b.K. - Ceylon service, to be run it the request of the Ceylon Government, will require an airport with standaids considerably higher than -hose 01 Ratnalana, which^ is inadequate for Tudors and may well be so for Ha tons. The A.^.F. airfield at Negcrabo appears to be suitable for both types. /but- 6 - / 97 - CIV. 10671 but the ^ir Ministry^ feel unable to provide handling facilities for trunk operators.

The company /Sas applied for permission to operate:- (i) Hong Kong to Sydney via Ranila - once weekly. (ii) Hong Kong to Singapore via Bangkok - twice weekly. Japan 98. The future organisation of civil aviation in Japan is at present being discussed by the Embassy at Washington and by the State Department. Present indications are that the U.S.A. are not in favour of setting up any special organisation for the operation of internal services in Japan, but would be content to leave the operation of these to the trunk airlines of the occupying powers, or possibly as an inter!,: measure, to those of all the United Nations. The U.K., Australia and New Zealand on the other hand would prefer on principle to see an international agency established for the operation of services 'within Japan. Both the U.K. and the U.S.A. may shortly submit papers on this subject to the Far Eastern Commission. 99. **n indication of the extent of development in Japan is furnished by a summary of the main points of interest in a bulletin issued by the Air Advisor to the U.K. Liaison Mission. (i) On the bombed-out area at Haneda (Tokyo), an airfield with runways of 5000 ’ and 7000’ has been constructed, and the site is being equipped on the usual lavish American scales, -with shops, messhalls, bars, ballroom, library, post office and a theatre. As a result, Haneda is now a luxuriously appointed well equipped going concern, ’’boasting one of the most beautiful airport terminal buildings in the world', (it is unfortunate that the building has recently been razed by fire). (ii) 24,000 passengers and some 300 tons of freight were transported to and from Hanoda in January by 188 long range transport aircraft and 438 medium range troop carriers, the latter operating on Japan - Manila, Japan - Guam and internal Japanese routes. (iii) By routes radiating from Hanoda the follov.dng places are at present served By A.T.C.Guam, Shanghai, Manila, Okinawa, I wo Jima, Peiping, Tarawa, Johnson Island, Honolulu and Kwajalein. By Troop Carriers:- Australia, Manila, Okinawa. By N aval A .IAS.: - Guam. To meet these demands 7 0-97 aircraft (the cargo version of the Boeing Stratocruiscr) are being supplied to A.T.G. during 1947. (iv) As part of what appears to be a progressive hand-over to civil airlines, a»,T.C. have awarded National Skyways Freight Corporation, (using 0-34*3) their largest single contract - the contract being ... 'of a military type, in the interests of the occupation'. Five days after the contract was awarded National Skyways ('The Flying Tigers') were in operation, and are still expanding their activities.- 8 - civ. 10671 is possibly of interest to note the ^.T.C. Pacific Commandf^s deiinitions of the purnose and mission of the A.T.C.:- to maintain the efficiency and the effectiveness of the air^transport fleet at the highest level ... (ani) to j.uliil its part iirjnediately i^.T.C. find themselves involved in war. The present position is a condition i/hich permits a fc .T.C. to obtain a large amount of training on overseas long range operations'. In the^same address it is also pointed out that A.T.C. is not in the airline business, although providing 'some of the niceties of airline seivices'. It engages in scheduled operations merely to retain the know bar and to use its aircraft in a manner thQ . hi 3 l ? 6st possible lift with the personnel available' t That is our job in war ... .and we must practice it in peace'). 100. oubstinitiating evidence of America* s civil aviation aspirations in p f°^ ded in a broadcast from Tokyo on 18th April, 1947, to the effect that the Supreme Commander had announced (l6th April) that North &lt; us Airlines and P....... had been granted permission to make preliminary arrangements to operate to Japan on their respective Trans-Pacific services, iianeda airport is designated as the sole port of entry for the two conroanies. icu are proaibited from employing Japanese personnel in flight operations or in aircraft maintenance. Japanese ground crews and radio operators ore however, being trained at American-controlled bases in Japan, which will ' serve as air terminals and emergency airfields for intcr-island services. pl- n3 have given rise to sensational Japanese rumours that American forces in Japan wore beginning to enlist Japanese ex-servicemen for possible 1 . Uo ? rG , a ° 3tlliti&lt;33 « These rumours are countered in the broadcast by' the explanation.that the 'training programme for prospective North-West Airline emp is necessary because Japanese air force standards are not high enough oc meet me exacting standards of American airlines, and because Japanese employees need to be trained in American practices'.

Immediately after the end of the war with Japan, communications in South East Asia were extremely poor and operated almost entirely by military or para military services. Local civilian services have been slow to re-open and pressure has already been exert-ed by the special Commissioner for South East Asia to improve them as rapidly as possible. CIV. 8744 /China :( CIV. 8744 /11. i China: /• ^ uivil aviation in China is under the Directorate of Navigation and Aviation v/hich in turn is under the Ministry of Comr.iunications. The present Director of Civil Aviation (Dr. Kao Ting Chi) appears to be both ignorant and ineffective; no airports have yet been designated for international use, nor have existi^rv. airfields been brought up to international standards; Met. and Control facilities are inadequate and there is not even relieable information about airfields; apart from some restrictive rules governing flights of foreign aircralt, no regulations have been published. The Director is admittedly at a disadvantage, in that all important airports are under Chinese Air Force control and^the Commanding General of the Chinese Air Force, General Chou Chiah-Jo, is making strenuous efforts to bring civil aviation under his own control. He seems to be xenophobe and is certainly anglophobe. He originally opposed the conclusion of civil aviation agreements with any foreign powers and it was Generalissimo Chiang Kai Shek himself who overruled him on this point. As examples of his anti-British influence, he has objected to the right of British civil aircraft to take refuge at airfields or anchorages during a typhoon and he violently opposed the transportation in British aircraft of a British Trade Delegation which was visiting China, c. The air lines at present operating under the Ministry of Communications are:- ( a ) Central Air Tranr 3 port Corporation - (C.A.T.C. ) - previously Eurasia; flying with Dakotas; nominated by the Chinese Government to fly North Pacific routes to U. S.A. v L ') -cina national Aviation Corporation - (C. N. A.C. ) - Government-owned with P.A.A. backing and small financial participation. The fleet consists of fourteen Dakotas and twelve Curtiss C .46 Commandos. Sky- masters are being bought and the first batch of seven arrived at the end of last year. The Company is nominated to fly the Central Pacific and European routes. Appendix 'C* to this summary shows routes presently being operated by C.A.T.C. and C.N.A.C. North East Aviation Company is to be established under the Ministry of Communications when plans have been approved by the Executive YUAN. It is reported that aircraft and capital are all ready. The Company intends to run services from Peking to Chang Chun via Mukden. At the same time, the Sino- Soviet air line is operating in North China .and into Russia, There is no detailed information about their services. We have also received a report from Chungking, dated 1st December, 194-6 on a proposal to form a 'Frontier Aviation Company ' in Szechuan, which will operate services from Chungking to Hong Kong, Hanoi, Chengtu and Yushin and Tihwa. The United States Government concluded on the 20th December a Civil Aviation Agreement with China under which United States obtain the first two Freedoms in China and the Third, Fourth and Fifth Freedoms at Shanghai, Tientsin and Canton on P.A.A. 's certificated route via Tokyo and Manila, on T.W.A's certificated route via Bombay, Mandalay and Hanoi and on North West Air Line's certificated route from Seattle to Manila via the Kurile Islands and Tokyo. China,obtained equivalent Freedoms at San Fancisco, New York and Honolulu for C.N.A. C. and C.A.T.C, The Agreement is to run for four years and may be terminated at one year's notice. 10. Since 1941 there has been a question of forming a Sino-British Air Company. This originally arose when the German influence in Eurasia, which was founded in 193^ with Luft Hansa financial interest and t echnical assistance, was withdrawn. In 1943 Eurasia was re-formed as C.A.T.C.and Jardine Matheson entered into tentative negotiations with the Chinese. The project was again discussed in June 1943 without success and the proposal appears to have received the coup de grace in September 1946. In fact, it seems doubtful whether the Chinese at any time contemplated foreign participation as similar requests from Russia and the United States were refused.civ, 8744 r~* -3- JLL4 i'., A, ;•&gt;. \ W vJ U vj K™^¥pate? $1 000 000 whi?p p m Tv l U - N - R - R - ii * has contributed twelve aircraft and i ,uuu,uuu, while C.N.R.R.A. has contributed the re&lt;=!i- o-p - 4 . n i • , consists in all of *3,000,000.

(d) Typhoon Dispersal rights. 13. Letters were exchanged at Chungking on 29th March 1942 and 21st May. 1942 governing reciprocal rights between S.W. China and India. Under this exchange we were allowed to operate from Calcutta to Kunming via Lashio and Chittagong (and to Hong Kong and Shanghai when conditions permitted); from Sadiya to Sichang (,in ozechnan) ; and from Myitkyina to Yunnanyi (in Yunnan). China received. reci-procil rights. In fact C.N.A.C. exceeded the agreed frequencies and were obliged by the course of the war to vary the routes. In the middle of last year maia requested that these routes should become inoperative at the end of 1946 and that a bilateral agreement should be negotiated to replace them, at which she would ask for the first four freedoms on a route Calcutta - Mandalay - Kunming - banking - Shanghai - Tokio(or points in French Indo-China), Calcutta, etc. - ' Hong Kong - Shanghai, etc., with Fifth freedom rights between Burma (or French Indo-China) and China. 14. On the 14th December, France and China exchanged notes to be effective for six months from 1st January 1947, allowing Air France to make one flignt each fortnxght ^Shanghai, with refuelling stops at Canton and Amoy, and rith^ -.^.- 1 . l. or O.A.T.0. to exercise reciprocal rights in French Indo-China with reiuelling stops at Hanoi and Tourance. Thailand: b. Siam was an enemy country between 1942 and 1945 but on the 1st January 1 946 Treat y was signed and there is now a British Minister at Bangkok* Under this ireaty we are guaranteed civil aviation rights no less favourable than those accorded to Imperial Air-ways by an exchange of letters dated 3rd December 1937 -n [J 10 bn Ravour 01 s..O.A.0. by an exchange of letters in January and March of 1940. The 1937 exchange of letters gave Imperial Airways the right to opera e regular air services between Rangoon and Singapore via Bangkok and between ong Kong and Bangkok. The Aerial Transport Company of Siam in exchange was given the right to operate between Bangkok and Hong Kong and from Bangkok to Calcutta via Rangoon and Akyab, Cabotage in Burma was reserved.-4- 16.

At the same time it was hinted that a. civil aviation Agreement would shortly be concluded between Thailand and the U.S.A. 1/. At the end of October 1946 we received reports from two sources that a Siamese subsidiary of Pacific Overseas Air Lines Incorporated was being formed wit., a capital of seven million ticals under the name of P.O.A. (Siam)'Limited. Ihe capital was to be subscribed in proportion of 25% Siamese Government, 25# y pr iv ^te individuals in Siam and 5Q% by Pacific Overseas Air Lines. (Or, as given in another report, 26# Siamese Government and 1+9% P.O.A.) It was arranged that a Siamese national was to be President of the Board and a United t Vice-President. P.O.A. is a Californian Corporation chartered on 27th November, 1945 with a capital of 100,000 dollars; in January 1946 the Company set up its headquarters in Ontario, California, where airfield facilities fn the Principal officers of the Company are ex-employees of Consairway (Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation of San Diego). The Company is operating as a sub-contractor to United Airlines who are under contract to the United States Army and are working on U.N.R.R.A. relief. Apart from four transports which belong to P.O.A., all the aircraft being operated belong to U.b._H.A.F. It is stated that the Siamese Company hopes to acquire twenty or xirty Skymasters, out this sounds like an exaggerated rumour. Apart from local .services, the Company expects to run services to Singapore, Hong Kong, Manila, Shanghai, Honolulu and Ontario, (California). 1b . ^ 8130 received a report in November last year that services from Bangkok to Cheigmai^and tc Haadyai and Sonkla v/ould shortly begin with Dakotas bought fr 0i ;‘ 1 • Disposal Board in India and operated by pilots of the Siamese Air Force. It io believed that Siam intends to operate internal services through their Air j^orce and to designate P.O.A. (Siam) Limited to operate external services. The future of the Aerial Transport Company of Siam, named under tho 1937 exchange of letters, is not known. Before the war they ran an efficient Internal air service with Puss Moths ahd equivalent types, ending in 1941-1942 with a fleet of i^irciiilds. ihe company had a Canadian General Manager, but he has not returned •to Siam; and it seems that the Company has been allowed to die. r ^ ea 2 h ; d dan f kok in the ]niddle of January, 1 947 that a United States Goodwill Fligho of orty-two B .29 baribers was touring the Far East and might be expected at Bangkok by May of this year. Philippine Commonwealth . 20. The Philippine Commonwealth has only recently become independent and is still to a certain extent, -^der United States influence. There is'a British Minister ’ at Manila. 21. There are at present in the Philippines the following conpanies:- ( a ) Philippine Air Lines (PAL) . This Canpany has the contract for domestic; air mails and was operating before the war. There is a T.W.A. financial holding in the corporation ( 28 %) and hie Company is qperaoing a number of internal services apart from non-scheduled flights (so regular as to be indistinguishable from services) to Hong Kong, Bangkok, Rangoon. Singapore ani Calcutta. Their fleet consists of fourteen 0.47’s and three Beechoraft Civ* 8744 ('b) Far Eastern Air Transport Incorporated (FEATl) This Camoany ras founded in 1933 by the brothers Lopes and operated before tie war under the name of llo ilo Negro^Air Express Company The Ccmpony has a fleet of twenty-seven Dakotas, too 0.54 transports, too oeeehcraft and fifteen Piper Cubs for their Par Eastern school.

They have a small fleet oi three Dakotas and tv/o '.54 transports and hope to operate externally to Saigon, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Amoy and Shanghai. They are also trying to form a registered Hong Kong subsidiary. (d) Trans Asiatic Air Lines Incorporated . This Company similarly consists of demobilized U.S.A.A.P. pilots, they are backed by a Philippine called Santiago and have a fleet of one Dakota and ten C.54 transports. They are operating at the moment on a non-schedule basis to Hong Kong and Saigon and expert to operate later to Bangkok, Rangoon, Calcutta, Singapore and Sumatra, The Company has a partnership arrangement with Par East Aviation Company Limited of Hong Kong. 22. On 16th November, 194^, a bilateral Agreement was signed with the U.S. Government, whereby all five Freedoms were granted to United States airlines at Manila and to Philippine airlines at Honolulu and San Francisco. It appears from this document that Philippine Air Lines have been designed to operate in an easterly direction and FEATI in a westerly direction. 25. A U.K. Mission has gone to China to negotiate a bilateral Agreement and on the way home expect to negotiate an agreement with the Philippine Commonwealth. B.O.A.C. intend to operate a South China Seas circular service, going through Manila in each direction, for which we require all five Freedoms; they also require the first four Freedoms at Manila on a Hong Kong — Manila local service. 24. The Philippine Government reached a working agreement with China on the 2nd September, 1946, for reciprocal flights twice weekly on the route Shanghai - Manila. 25. It is reported that the United States Army and Navy recently •ancelled the sale of petrol, oil and lubricants to Philippine Commercial Air Lines and that, as a result, there has been a temporary cut in services; but it is expected that the distribution of petrol on a civil basis will soon be restored. French Indo-China . 26. At present little is known about the situation in French Indo-China, as desultory fighting is still going on. The French have admitted the republic of Viet-Nam and Cochin China into the French Union. At present Air France is operating a weekly service to Saigon via Norch Africa, the Middle East and India. Dutch East Indies 27. K.N.I.L.M. are at present using Constellations on their service from Amsterdam to Batavia, which is operating four times weekly; in the near future they hope to increase the frequency to five times a week, operating three times via Calcutta and twice via Bangkok. 28. There has been a recent newspaper report that the Indonesian Republic (still not formally recognised) plans to open an air service linking Malang, Java, Palejnbang and Kottaradje in North Sumatra. India . 29. The policy of the India Government in civil aviation appears to envisage the operation of air services by private enterprise, subject to Government control and subsidy, the subsidy being based on an ascending target revenue and a descending target cost. Between the 1st January and the 30th December, 1946, TATAS and Indian National Airways were eperating ?*ommcri«al services under an agreement with the Indian Government and on the 1st October, 1946, an Air Transport Licensing Board was set up to license scheduled services. The Indian Government appears to be considering, in order of importance, the following external services Egypt, Burma, Malaya, the United Kingdom, China, East Africa and Afghanistan.- 6 - risw eveAt^arfv hOE&gt;eS ultimatel y to three Tudor II services a week, parti^imte in thi T 6 ' ^ We ' bUt “ is that she will be ready to pdr-cicipate m this scheme tor some time.

The airport of Begum Pet has been deveiqped as the main airport for the state and is beiL maintained^ under the State Railway Board. This Company has even talked of operating in the future a service to the United Kingdom which would raise the qaestion of status of Feudatory States vis a vis the United Kingdom Government ' and/or any Indian Union which may be formed in the immediate future. Y&gt;. Although the Indian Government had hoped to reserve Fifth freedan between concSe^Fif^fvS^ COU ? t^i | s^ their rece nt agreement with U.S.A. they conceaed liith freedom under Bermuda safeguards. Burma. rtute-^oY^b 0 ^ fi important junction on the Australasian and Far Eastern ^ ^^icult flying country, especially during the monsoon and at present it has few adequate airfields. A. report written about two years ago suggested that Rangoon shoula be developed to international standards and Mandalay SPa major ^ irport wn ile Akyab, Lashio, Kengtung, Magwe and Mergui should be developed as intermediate airfields. ^ Originally the policy of the Burma Government tended towards a State-owned and State-controlled air company, but latterly they appear to have taken a more realistic attitude and to have realised that there are many more urgent problems v/ith which the Government has to deal. They therefore offered tenders and received two applications to operate services on their behalf. These were from:- (a) the Indian Air Survey and Transport Company Limited; (b) a Moulmein merchant called Rai Bahadur Bhagwandass, Bagla. The former offer was^never seriously considered. In the latter case it seems that Bagla has supplied the money but that the moving spirit and general manager 13 a certain Squadron Leader Isaacs, late of R.A.F. Transport Command. To date Bagla* s proposals are for a company to be called Burma National Airways operating Dakotas and Expeditors on the following internal and external routes the frequencies being shown in parenthesis:- ’ 1 Internal External CIV. S 744 Rangoon - Moulmein ( 7 ) Rangoon - Basrein ( 7 ) Rangoon - Yenang - Yaung - Mandalay - Lashio - Mandalay - Rangoon (7 Rangoon - Moulmein - Tavoy - Mergui (2 Rangoon - Akyab - Calcutta Rangoon- Bangkok - Penang - Singapore Rangoon — Lashio — Kunming /■ /Ther ■ -7- J-i' V * i ; , f »• G J G U I The Burma Government is inclined to ac*cept Bagla’s tender, partly because he is a Burman and approves of a policy of 'Burmanisation' o^ ft^e/employees of the Company but chiefly because he is not aking for a Government subsidy.-- ' He is, however' * asking for a monopoly contract (including a contract for air charter work survey work and mails) i or a period of 40 years. He also proposes to offer of the shares to the public but to be reserved for Burman nationals. It has now been sugge^Kd to the Government of Burma that they should not agree to a contract of 40 or &lt;_J or 15 or even 10 years (all of which have been counter-proposals) but that they should suggest a monopoly of between 5 and 8 years and that the monopoly should exclude charter and survey work. 36. British Air Services Limited have offered to act as technical advisers to the Government of Burma but it is not known whether -this offer will be accepted. Ceylon . 37• The civil aviation policy in Ceylon at the moment appears to envisage the control and operation by the State of all exte rnal services, whereas they propose to set up an Air Transport Licensing Board to regularise internal air traffic, and in the operation of internal services they propose to open the field to private firms. Charter services would also be open to private firms and subject to licence. In their plans for external services, the early inauguration of a service to India figures high, and later they hope to operate trunk services to the United Kingdom and Australia. 38. The State has accepted responsibility for maintaining certain airfields and developing the aeronautical radio service and the Met. organisation. They also intend to establish a civil aviation Training School. 39. Discussions have taken place with Air India Limited (TATAS) for the formation of a Ceylonese Air Company, to be called Ceylon National Airways. The discussions have not yet been concluded and there is still absence of agreement on one or two points, but the general lines of the Agreement appear to be as follows Ceylon National Airways shall operate from Colombo to Karachi in parallel with Air India Limited, but in a lower ratio of frequencies (possibly in the nature of 1 : 3 or 1 : 6 ) and that Air India Limited shall operate Ceylon's quota under an Agency Agreement. Ceylon National Airways prepose to acquire certain aircraft; and depreciation on these, together with the fees of the Ceylon Directors, will be excluded from the assessment of profit and loss. Apart from this, expenses and revenue v/ill be pooled in the same ratio. 40. Ratmalana was opened as a civil airport on the 1st Juen, 1946, after the airport buildings has been re-conditioned. Ceylon has decided not to develop Negombo as a civil airport; any trunk operators who wish to use Negombo must make an arrangement with the R.A.F. Puttalam has now be n handed back to civil aviation department by the R.A.F. and will be used as an emergency landing ground. Minneriya and Vavuniya have also been handed over and will be maintained i s subsidiary landing grounds for internal services. 41. The United States Arn\y Air Force has sold to the Ceylon Government, for a nominal sum of ten rupees, the communications and radio equipment at Ratmalana airport on condition that the equipment continues to be operated as before. Ceylon has started to recruit technicians to operate radio communications and slo to train Air Traffic Control Officers. In Met. the R.A.F. and Civil Aviation Department are collaborating; weather reports are provided by the Ceylonese Government and the Met. organisation is being provided by the R.A.F.; here too Ceylon is arranging to train two observatory assistants in Met. duties so that they can take over from the R.A.F. in the future. 42. Ceylon is still toying with the idea of buying Constellations and operating a trunk service of her own to the United Kingdom and it is reported that Air India Limited (TATAS) has shown interest in the project. If this proposal should ever come to anything (which is unlikely) Air India Limited would almost certainly be asked to operate these services on an Agency Agreement. civ* 8744 /British MalayaBritish Malaya 4-3. British Malaya consists of: fa) Singapore ^ Cb) The Malayan Union * (c) North Borneo ( d) Sarawak (e) Brunei All the above, except Brunei which has a British Resident are administered y o. governor. The Governor-General of Malaya has general supervisory and co-ordinating functions in British Malaya. Singapore and the Malayan Union 44. Before thewar air s ervices in the Federated Malay States were operated by Uearne Brothers. A company called Malayan Airways Limited was incorporated in 1937 but it never operated any services; it had a capital of $500,000, of which Imperial Airways (later B.O.A.C.) held 51% shares and Holt's 49%. lifter the war Y/earne Brothers were prepared to resume their services but were not prepared to operate under the conditions defined by the Colonial Office, that is, for only three years and without any promise of a monopoly. On the other hand Mansfields (who are control by Holts) were anxious to start services in Malaya, 45. Various proposals were made, which included B.O.A.C. participation with Mansfields and with both Wearne Brothers and Mansfields. Tenders were offered, but finally Wearne Brothers declined to tender and B.O.A.C. withdrew from all 1 inaneial participation in the pre-war Malayan Airways Limited. Mansfields, were left alone in the field. Originally their proposals included, in addition to internal services, the operation of routes to Batavia, Bangkok, Medan (Sumatra) and Labnan (Borneo) and involved the use of Dakotas as well as Air Speed Consuls; but later they were asked to modify their plans to exclude the use of Dakotas and the operation of external services. 46 . It is now expected that the services shewn below will be opened on 1st April 1947 with Air Speed Consuls, of which one aircraft has already been received four more are expected. This fleet will allow one adreraft to be used for Government charters. Route Frequency (a) Singapore - Kuala Lampur - Ipoh - Penang Daily (b) Penang - KotaEharu Weekly (c) Singapore - Kuala Lumpur - Kuala Lipis - Kuantan Weekly (Routes (a) and (b) will be run at the operator's own risk but (c) will be at Government expense if it does not show a profit.) 47. The company is not asking for a subsidy but wants exemption from petrol etc. duties and aerodrome charges, or a grant in lieu. They will be given a monopoly for two years, but no guarantee of its continuance after that period. British Air Services will provide technical assistance, Qantas overhaul and maintenance facilities. NORTH BORNEO. SARAWAY AND BRUNEI : 48 . There are airfield sites in Borneo territories at Labuan, Kuching, Jesselton, Sandakan and Kennigan, all capable of being developed into reasonably good airfields, suitable for coinmerical air eperations; but, to restore thse airfields will cost at least one million dollars, to say nothing of the cost of putting up suitable airport buildings. 49* Chiefly for this reason it lias been recommended that air services could be most quickly set up in these territories with amphibious aircraft, capable of landing in the coastal regions and on rivers with a minimum of ground organisation. CIV. 8744 / 50 .c - SJ ■- &gt; vJ vJ / 57 - CIV. 8744 - 9 - I 5C. One of the chief needs is for an air link between ^n g fi p ol^ Borneo terrixories. The v.A.F. arc running, soraev/hat irregularly, a weekly flying- bofl-t service Singapore - Kuching - Labuan - Kuching - Singapore* Therx has be cm preg^vre to extend it to Jcsseltan. Clearly though, the sooner a civil airline can ouke this over, the butt r. Two proposals have been made:- (a) To recondition Labuan and operate a weekly service from Singapore; (b) For Qantas to operate a flying-boat service with Catalinas. Their first estimate however was considered too expensive - Australian £78 a flying hour, excluding the provision and maintenance of seaplane bases* HONG KONG : 51« At present several Philippine airlines arc operating services to Hong Kong which are described as non-scheduled but which in fact are regular and advertised as regular. These include Commercial Airlines Incorporated of Manila, FEATI, Philippine Airlines Incorporated and Trans-Asiatic Airlines Incorporated. To regularise this position, the *K. Mission which is in China, negotiating a bilateral Agreement, proposes to return to the U.K. via Manila and negotiate there an agreement vdth the Philippine Commonwealth. At the same time Australian National Airways applied in June of last year to extend their service from Australia to Manila as far as Hong Kong, operating with D.C.4«M. aircraft. This applicationhad not been sponsored by the Australian Government and nothing further has been heard of it. One of the difficulties will be to nominate a suitable Hong Kong Company to operate rccipjrocal services. 32. At present there is an air canpany registered in Hong Kong called Cathay Pacific Airlines. This is a subsidiary of Roy Farrell export and Imrort Company (Hong Kong) Limited, which has on the Board of Directors three Australians end two United States citisens. The capital is also shared in approximately tils proportion, i.e, fyj/o Australian and 37a American. The main Company has registered offices in Shanghai and also lias branch offices in Sydney (Australia) and Manila. Cathay Pacific Airlines has two Dakotas at the moment and is operating services iron Hong Kong to Sydney on a temporary basis; they propose to operate from Hong Kong to Macao, which is Portuguese territory on the Chinese mainland, and to Europe end the United Kingdom. Enquiries are now taking, place into the status of Cathay Pacific Airlines before this Company will be nominated as a British designated airline in ireciprocity with the airlines of other countries. 33* Last year a certain Mr. Summers, who has had business connections in Hong Kong for some years, proposed to start a small service between Hong Kong and Canton. B..O.A.C. shov/ed some interest in this proposal since they recognised that it would be impossible to make any further headway with the longstanding proposal to form a Sino-British Company, and they felt that this might be an opportunity of setting a foot in Chinese territory. /Iso concerned with this proposal arc Jardine Mathiesons who at first were opposed to the proposal but latterly show signs of co-operating. It has been suggested that the capital of the propos d company should be between £30,000 - £73?000 and according to preliminary B.O.A.C. estimates, ther is a chance that the Company would break even, working on a 63/o load factor. 34* We have also heard a report that a Chinese Corporation, Ta Hwa Aviation Corporation, who have been refused a licence to operate in China, have bean trying^ to have themselves registered in Hong Kong. OCCUPIED TERRITORIES IN JAPAN 33* Manchukuo has never been recognised as Japanese, territorjr and lias reverted to China. The future of other Japanese possessions is unsettled: Korea is claiming independence; Formosa is occupied by the Ohinese, Sakhalin and the Kuriles by the Russians, and will probably revert to those countries. There is a small British Commonwealth 0ccupying Force in the Japanese Islands, about two-thirds Australian and one-third British and Indian.HBi HHI 10. 5^* In September 1945 General MacArthur autnorised the Japanese State Airlines, Dai Dippon Koka Kabushiki Kaisha, to operate tne following services. The figures in parenthesis refer to tne weekly frequency. These services are;- Tokio - Osaka - Fukuoka (3) Tokio - Nagoya - Yunato - Osaka - Takamatsu - Hiroshima - Oita — Fukuoka ( 6 ) Tokio - Sendai - Aomori - Sapporo (5) Tokio - Niigata - Toyama - Fukucniyama - Osaka (1 ) 57. Recently the United States authorities in Japan have announced that United States civil airlines (P.A.A. and North Western Airlines Incorporated) will be allowed to operate to Tokio on a civilian basis. These companies are already operating under contract to U.S.A.A.F. 58. Arising out of this announcement a Far Eastern Committee document has been prepared which will define the rights of other powers to operate on a civilian basis to and in Japan. It is anticipated that otner countries will be given free access on similar terms to tnose now being imposed in enemy-occupied territories elsewhere in the world, on a non-discriminatory basis. General MacArthur has announced that he is willing to enter into tecnnical discussions with airlines of other nations, and B.O.A.C, are sending a representative. 59. On the U.K. Liaison Mission at Tokio there is an Air Liaison Officer, Group Captain A.E. Dark, C.B.E., who has been asked to cover civil aviation interests in Japan and who has been sent a brief on U.K. intentions in this territory. At present this includes an extension of the U.K. — Hong Kong flying-boat service operated by B.O.A.C. to Shanghai and later to Tokio; and possible rights in the future from Hong Kong to Tckio via Shangnai or to Tokio direco, exercised by a British local subsidiary ccmpany. CIV. 8744CIV. 8744 11 . SUFPLEi.ZEl^T TO EASTERN StMvlARY NO.1 . General Assessment of tne Position : I seme respeoxs the Eastern problems are more clearly defined that are those in the Near and Middle East, but in another sense they elude analysis. The countries included in tnis Summary broadly fall under the sphere of influence of one or other Great Power - Great Power being used in the sense of a political or commercial influence. These powers are the United States of America, the United Soviet Socialist Republics, China, the British Commonwealtn, Prance and the Netnerlands. In this respect it is comparatively easy to interpret and ’’pigeon hole” the varying information which we receive. But,'at tne same time, there is a curtain over China, Russia and Japan, which is not a nolp to,free commercial development. It is probably true to say that American influence in China is still greater than our own, although it is on the wane. Tne position of America as a military occupying power in Japan and tne Western Pacific gives ner a great influence here also during this interim period. On tne otner hand the influence of the British Commonwealth, Prance and tne Netherlands is decreasing, thougn not always at the expense of either China, Russia or the United States; Prance and Holland are both fighting for their eastern dependencies and we ourselves are voluntarily withdrawing from active control of India, Burma and Ceylon, in a greater or less degree. General Conclusions. 2, The conclusion from this is (a) that ccmmercial efficiency must be supplemented by astute diplomacy, and tne advantages of a chosen instrument should be exploited to the full; (b) in tnose States which are finding independence we should try to introduce now, before full independence is achieved, a status as advisers. This means a constant and complete exchange of information at every level, both between the Government Offices in Whitehall primarily concerned and this Ministry, who in turn should co-operate very closely with B.O.A.C. in London; and also between B.O.A.C. local representatives and the U.K. Government representative on the spot, whether he is a colonial governor or an air attache or an air adviser or a Consul-General .’or a British Minister. At the same time, there are manifest advantages, if we could persuade tne otner States concerned, in co-operation between the members of the British Canmonwealth. The faggot is stronger than each individual stick. Commonwealth solidarity is certainly our most important bargaining counter with China and the United States. 3. There is one other important difference between tne situation in tnis region and the situation in the Middle East. Whereas in tne Middle East airports are primarily stages on trans-ocean routes, and only secondarily centres of local networks, in this region they are terminals of U.K. trunk routes; for example, Karachi, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Singapore. Admittedly there may be a time in the future when we and Canada, either in parallel or in partnersnip, may be operating via the Aleutians and Alaska, but at the moment we are mainly concerned with terminal points. This means that we should be even more concerned to link our trunk routes with local services, which can be done most easily by close association with tne regional airlines, either by direct participation or by a management contract or by a loosely defined technical adviser status. Among tnose countries where it would be most valuable to have British associated local airlines are Malaya, Burma, Siam, Hong Kong, China and Japan. In China the chance of securing British participation in a Chinese airline are slender for some time to come. In Japan we should press for some form of international airline with Russian, British, American and Chinese participation. Failing tnis, the most likely field to explore is Korea, which has been claiming independence for seme years and which is likely to achieve it when the Peace Treaty with Japan canes to be signed. It is unlikely that any political infiltration will be possible, but there may be a chance for B.O.A.C, as a commercial operator to put a loot in the half-open door. r * R* .£ \. ■ /****&lt; o ..y w vJ IS 47 /Miscellaneousmam ■■■BF 12 . Miscellaneous 4» does noo seem to late to explore the chances of participating in an ^js internal Siamese airline. There is little doubt that P.O.A. (Siam) Ltd. has am itious projects outside Siam and is less concerned with developing the country’s internal services than with using tne country as a springboard. . -Although rignts for our trunk services are covered by tne 1937 exchange of letters, wo should consider concluding a bilateral agreement with Siam as soon as we are clear wnat external services will be operated from Hong Kong and British Malaya. e* There is an urgent need to develop an air link between Singapore and the Borneo territories and to start internal services in North Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei. /• Our attitude to Cathay Pacific in Hong Kong must be defined soon and plans for the B.O.A.C.
