Sir, With reference to Sir Robert divers aespatch Ho. 3o8 a of June 16th, 1931, regarding a law for the punishment of persons guilty of offences against the social order which had at that time just come into force, i hare the honour to report that the Ittila 1 at re-published the text of this law 'for general information' in its issue of Bee ember 3rd. I'he publication of this law followed close upon the who.iesale arrest of the Baidriti&amp;ri jehane (see ay despatch Ko.581 of to-day} and naturally gave rise to much speculation* 3. Subsequent to the date of 8ir Robert Clives despatch the law in question appeared in the official Gazette of June 30th,1931, and I take this opportunity of transmitting to you — a revised translation made from this text, it will be seen that it differs considerably from the newspaper version which was alone available at the date of Sir Robert Clive’s despatch. 4. fh® word translated 'socialistic 5? is 'ishtiraki'• The root meaning of this word ishtIraki' is 'sharing' or 'combining' with somebody else. The root is the earn© as that of 'Shirk' which was the great sin In the eyes of the orthodox mo si eras {and still is), being translated 'polytheism' - i.e. the association of other Gods with Allah* The usual word for 'socialistic' is not this* but 'ijtima i » which gives the idea of several persons thronging together. 1 think the drafters purposely used a vague word S'■ that they could rope in all forms of association as 'ishtliraki'. 5*. t Honourable ir John Simon a.C.S.X.* etc., etc * n etc ♦ » Tim For ei gn Off i 06 (Suolosrara 1 „ T., „ So . „„ ^ ^ ^ ^ to the Foreign office.

Section 5. £ 4315 / 162 / 34 ] No. 1. Mr. Lascelles to Mr. A. Mender son.—(Received Auqust 20) (No. 413.) ' Sir ’ I HAVE the honour to transmit to vou herewith £ v . lhek \ { uh J S1 &gt; 19 31. a law which has been submitted to the Majlis Judicial ComXionTegardinftht scale of punishment contemplated for those officials of the DepartLnt of Justice who, for personal, private or other motives, fail to dispense justice fmpartiallv in the cases with which they are called upon to deal. ' lm P a ™auy m 2. Of the various cases of failure to obtain justice which of late rears have come to the notice of this Legation, the most notable is the suit arising out of the 2 h Tune ^qr^Th at (see Sir R Clive ’ s des P atch ^ 338 of the Mh June 1931). The savage flogging of a British-Indian subject at Chahbar by order of a military officer comes within the scope of a military tribunal in so iar as disciplinary action is required, but it would presumably be the duty of the public prosecutor of the civil court to enquire into the request of a civilian for re( A ess anc ( compensation against a military officei’, especially when the latter, as tne Persian Government in this case admitted, was acting outside the scope of ms military duties. In no case which has come to the notice of this Legation nave the civil courts^ dared to intervene where a soldier (officer or man) was concerned, and this is true even where there were aspects of the case which brought it within the competence of the civil courts. 3. It is now three years since the abolition of the capitulatory regime, and although the Minister of Justice has made great efforts to build up a satisfactory Administration, he has encountered so many difficulties that the process has been much slower than was expected. The larger towns have naturally been the first to claim his attention, and there, apart from inordinate delays in the administration of justice owing to the innumerable appeals and counter-appeals which Persian law appears to allow, a certain amount of success has attended his efforts. Daver’s greatest difficulties, however, have been lack of material and lack of money, and there are still some places in South Persia, especially along the Gulf coast, where even primary courts have not been opened. A case in point is Bander Abbas, where a number of British-Indian merchants are domiciled, and where, in spite of repeated representations by this Legation in the course of the last two years, no law court of any kind at present exists. Daver has found too few people willing to face the climate of the Gulf, and his budget has not al owe him to make offers sufficiently tempting to offset the uncomfortable iving conditions. His latest proposal is to invest the Governors of such places with Magisterial authority and to give them a few months training m t e cour s o fhe nearest town before letting them return to their posts to exercise eir functions. This is certainly not an ideal way of filling t e gaps, u Perhaps better than having no courts at all and obliging Bntish-In m fo travel some hundreds of miles to the nearest court m order to obtain a hearing °1 the simplest case. . . n Up , . E Meanwhile, discipline in the Judicial Administration leaves much to be esired; a reduction in his salary recently caused the chie jus ice ^ resign his post without warning a few minutes before an impor ^ t p e e heard. A British firm happened to be a party m the case, an j? interests, expense of sending a lawyer by air from Tehran to take c arg esen t a tions The matter was taken up by His Majesty’s Legation, bu P b av e so far been without result. . t _ PA1ir + q 0 f justice fi It has not come to the notice of this Legation , corrupt than are more corrupt than other administrations they are certai y by P offi ce rs ,r • me most iuauiluuo ^ ^ rrhYPd commissions composeu the army.

It would, I fear, be a mistake to take this ostensiWeattempyo stamp out corruption at its face value; there is one law for ® “ ^ h f a “® inces another for the common herd of petty officials; one law fo ,■ P, * de and another for those in Tehran.

So long as the present state ot a l^ irs r . unchanged, such laws as this must be regarded as an attempt to throw a , the eyes of the casual observer and the temporary visitor to Persia, one p p are to be asked to believe that the present regime is, above all, honest, scru P 1 jL and imbued with the highest ideals for the welfare of the Persian people. 1 the most superficial observer could believe this to be the case. . , 7. Even if taken solely at its face value, the present state oi 311 i affairs in Persia leaves much to be desired. But there is one important aspec of the matter which I have not touched on here : there can be no doubt bu a torture and all sorts of “third-degree” methods are being extensively increasingly resorted to, both by the police and the £ £ commissions of enquiry- 171 ^st-hand evidence on such a subject is naturally hard to come by, but it is 3 stion that cannot be disregarded, in view of the large number of Bn is i British-Indian subjects living in Persia, and I shall shortly have the honou adoress you further concerning this unhealthy symptom of what, in ma™ ways, is an unhealthy regime. 8.1 am forwarding a copy of this despatch with its enclosure to the Foieiga Secretary to the Government of India.

Article 77. In any case in which the testator has vested the trustee ship in two or more persons independently, when one of them deceases, the other or others take possession individually and if it be laid down that such taking possession shall be collective, then an act of taking possession on the part of any one of the trustees shall not be valid unless it has the approval of the other or others, and after the death of one of them the judge shall appoint a person to be added to the survivors in order that they may jointly enter into possession. Article 78. The testator may appoint a supervising trustee vd.thout whose knowledge and approval no administrative act may take place. Article 79.

Article 82. In all cases in which the testator has made special arrangements for the management of the estate, the administrator shall carry out these arrangements, and if no arrangements are laid down, he shall act with regard to repairs, leases, and the collection of profits and their division among the beneficiaries and the maintenance of the property and so on, like a trustworthy agent. Article 83. The administrator may not entrust the trusteeship to another unless the testator has given permission in the text of the deed of endowment, but if in the deed of endowment it is not stipulated that he shall personally administer the property, he may appoint an agent. Article 84. It is permissible for the testator to make provision for a portion of the profits of the estate to be devoted to the remuneration °f the trustee, and if no remuneration for the trustee has been specified, the administrator is entitled to a fair remuneration. r ^ c -*- e 85.

Article 96. A spring situated in someone’s land definitely belongs to the owner of that land, unless another person has rights over its sub stance or its profits. Article 97. Whenever a person has for a long tune had a water channel running through the house or property of another to his own property or has had a right in his favour, the owner of that house or land shall not hinder the taking of water nor its passage through his property, and similarly with regard to rights such as holding rights in doors, open work windows, aqueducts,, irrigation channels and so on. Article 98. If the owner of property has given permission to pass through it to someone who cannot do so by right, he may rescind his permission whenever he wishes and prevent the other from passing through; and similarly with other rights of easement. Article 99. No one has the right to take his water channel into the property of another, nor to cause rain water from his roof to flow onto the roof of the property of another, nor to throw snow on to it unless he has permission from the owner. Article 100. If the water channel of one person passes through the house of another, and if it becomes damaged in such a way as to cause damage to the house, the owner of the house has no right to oblige the owner of the channel to repair it, but he himself must take steps to prevent it from causing him loss. Should the damage to the channel obstruct the passage of water, the owner of the house is not obliged to repair the channel, but the owner of the right of passage must himself remove the obstruction, and to make the repairs may enter the house or land, but except when there is such a necessity, he has no right of entry, without the permission of the owner. Article 101 . Whenever someone derives profit, such as the working of a mill or similar things, from water which is the property of someone else in accordance with some right, the owner of the water cannot change the course of the channel in such a way as to prevent this right from being profitably exercised. Article 102. Whenever an estate is transferred either in its entirety or in part to someone else, rights of easement over another estate or portion of it being included therein, such rights remain unchanged, unless there be a stipulation to the contrary. Article 103. Whenever the partners in a property possess rights and benefits and that estate is divided between them, each partner shall, in proportion to his share, become the owner of those rights e.g., if an estate possessing the right* of passage through another estate be divided between several persons, they each have the same right of passage as before over the said place. Article 104. A right of easement necessarily implies the exploitation of that right e.g., if a person has the right of taking water from the springs, tanks or reservoirs of others, he shall have the right of passage to such springs, tanks and reservoirs for the drawing of water. Article 105. Any expenses which may be necessary for the enjoyment of a r ight of easement are a charge upon the owner of that right, unless an agreement to the contrary has been arrived at between him and tne owner of the property.

ON THE ESSENTIAL CONDITIONS FOR THE VALID TTY OF A TRANSACTION Article 190. For the validity of a contract the following conditions are essential. (1) the intention and mutual donsent of both parties to the contract. ( 2 ) the competence of both parties. (3) there must be a definite thing which forms the subject-matter of the contract. (4-) the cause of the transaction must be lawful. SUB-SECTION (l) REGARDING THE INTENTION AW MUTUAL CONSENT OF BOTH PARTIES TO THE CONTRACT Article 191. A contract only becomes complete through the real intention of the contractor, and this real intention must be accom panied by some factor which proves that there was such an intention. Article 192. If either party or both, are unable to speak, a sign which indicates intention and acceptance will be sufficient. Article 193. The performence of a transaction may be effected by an act which indicates intention and agreement, such as taking delivery or handing over unless in circumstances excepted by the law. Article 194. The words, signs or other acts by which both parties perform the transaction must be co-ordinated so that each party accepts the transaction which the other intended to perform. Otherwise the transaction will be null and void. Article 195. If anyone makes a contract when drunk, unconscious or asleep, the contract is null owing to absence of intention. Article 196, Anyone who makes a contract is himself bound thereby, unless in making the contract the contrary is laid down or unless sub sequent evidence to the contrary is produced. When making a contract, however, any one can make provision for the benefit of a third person. Article 197. If the price or the subject of a sale in a contract is a thing which belongs to a third party, the contract will be on behalf of the owner of that thing. Article 198. Either or both parties may represent another or conversely one person can represent both parties to a contract. Article 199.

Reluctance will invalidate a contract even when it is caused by an outside party other than the two parties concerned. Article 204. Threats made by one party against the body or soul or honour of close relatives (of the other party) such as husband, wife, fathers or children are regarded as causing reluctance. In connection with this article the closeness of the relationship must be considered, according to custom, in estimating the reluctance. Article 205. When a threatened person knows that the threat cannot be carried out or when he is able to defend himself without difficulty from the threat or from performing the contract, the man who made the threat cannot be regarded as having used undue force. Article 206. If anyone is constrained to make a transaction through distress, this is not regarded as undue force and such a transaction is considered valid. Article 207. A transaction entered into by a person because constrained by an order of competent judicial authorities is not considered as made under undue force. Article 208. If one party fears the other, though not threatened by him, this is not regarded as being undue force. Article 209. A transaction signed after the removal of any undue force is binding..

If it is not possible to force the fulfillment of an act by the person who should perform it and if the act is of such a kind that no one else could perform it on his behalf, then the other party shall have the right to cancel the contract. Article 240. If when a contract has been made it is found that the carrying out of its condition is impossible or if it becomes known that the carrying out was impossible when the contract was made, the person in whose favour the contract was drawn up will have the option of can celling the contract, unless the condition becomes impossible of fulfilment owing to some act of the person in whose favour the contract was drawn up. Article 241. In a contract it may be specified that one of the parties should give security or pledge for the fulfilment of his obligation. Article 242. If it is stipulated that one of the parties should pledge ill. certain property and if that property is destroyed or damaged, the other party will have the right to cancel the contract but not the right Me. to demand the delivery of the equivalent of the pledged property or any compensation for damages. If such pledged property is destroyed or damaged after delivery there will be no right of cancellation of the contract. ffectaiit Article 243. If a contract provides for a guarantor and if this condition is not fulfilled, the person in whose favour the condition was uirefnts^ made will have the right to cancel the contract. Article 244. A party in whose favour a condition is made may surrender his claim to the fulfilment of that condition, and in that case the j^jiaugsoff condition ceases to be part of the contract; conditions about the result of a contract cannot, however, be cancelled in this.way. ^ Article 245. The surrender of the right to a condition may be made either orally or by some act, which indicates such surrender. Article 246.

Article 247, Contracts regarding the property of others, except those entered into by guardians, trustees or legal representatives, are not^ binding even tho^h the owner of the property inwardly agrees thereto, if however after the contract has been made the owner of e property signifies his consent, the contract becomes good and binding.

Article 252. consent or refusal need not immediate; in case of causing loss to a party who has acted m an authorised manner he shall have the right to break the contract. Article 253. In the case of an unauthorised contract, if the owner of the property dies before signifying his consent or refusal, this consent or refusal can be given by the heirs. Article 254. If the property referred to in an unauthorised contract subsequently passes into the possession of the unauthorised person in some way, this mere ownership will not make the original contract binding. Article 255. If anyone makes a contract which is acknowledged to be an unauthorised contract and subsequently it transpires that the property in question belonged to the man who made the contract or to a person, on whose behalf he was authorised to act as a guardian, or legal repre sentative, the validity of the contract depends on the renewed consent of the person who made the contract J if he does not give such a consent the contract is invalid. Article 256. In the event of anyone transferring property of'himself or anyone else in one contract, or accepting the transfer of property, for himself or another the contract is binding on himself but is considered unauthorised for anyone else. Article 257. If the object of an unauthorised transaction is made the object of other transactions also, before the owner of the property signifies his consent or refusal to the first unauthorised transaction, this owner can approve any of the transactions which he likes and the transactions dependent thereon shall be valid, while the previous ones shall be null and void. r re e 258.

In respect of profits derived from misappropriated property, each party guilty of misappropriation is responsible to the amount of profit accruing during the time that he has held the misappropriated property or the time that it has been held by persons subsequently guilty of misappropriation, even if he derived no benefit therefrom. When however a party guilty of misappropriation has had to pay profit that accrued while the property was held by others who misappropriated it later, then he may claim on each of these other persons in proportion to the period that they held the property. Article 321. If the owner of a property excuses a party who has been guilty of misappropriation from returning the equivalent or the value of the property, he shall have no right to claim on others who have been similarly guilty. If hov/ever (the owner) he delegates his right to one of those (guilty) persons by some means, this latter person will become the representative of the owner and will enjoy the same right that the owner had.'

In case of the death, lunacy, or mental incapacity of one of the parties. 2. In case the proprietor becomes destitute. 3. In case the whole of the capital and its profits disappear. 4. In case the trade which the parties envisaged becomes impos sible. Article 552. If in a contract of bailment a definite period be laid down for trading, the specifying of the period does not make the contract binding (lazim), but after the expiry of the period the bailee may not make any transaction except with the renewed consent of the proprietor. Article 553. If the contract of bailment is a general one, i.e. no special form of trade is laid down, the bailee can perform any ransac tion which may seem to him appropriate; but common practice must be observed in respect of the kind of trade.

Exclusion from Inheritance ( hu.jb) is the name given to the state of an heir who is completely or partially excluded from taking an inheritance owing to the existence of another heir.qq7 'Pxclusion from inheritance consists of two parts:- Article heir is deprived of the inheritance totally, e .g. Fi v St twt son is deprived of the inheritance owing to the existence a ^ r °Wher or a sister of the deceased: or, a half-brother on the °\f ide is deprived of an inheritance owing to the existence of father blood. frXrs ^the full blood. Second, when the portion of an heir is lessened; as for instance when the share of a husband is lessened from a half to a quarter when ever there are children from the wife; and similarly Ydien the share of the woman is reduced from a quarter to an eighth whenever there are children from her husband. Article 888 . The determining factor in total exclusion from inheri tance is the nearness of relationship to the deceased; hence, each degree of heirs deprive the next degree of taking any inheritance, except in the case mentioned in Article 936 and in cases where the more remote heir is able to take inheritance by way of representation of another, in which case both take an inheritance. Article 889. As between the heirs of the first degree, if there he no children of the deceased, the children's children, to whatever extent they go down, are the representatives of their father or their mother, and take an inheritance with the remaining parent; but, as between the children, the nearest to the deceased deprives the further ones from inheritance. Article 890. As between the heirs of the second degree, if there are no brothers or sisters of the deceased, the children of his brothers or sisters, however far down they go, are the representatives of their father or mother, and take an inheritance with whichever of the an cestors of the deceased has survived; but, as between the ancestors or the brother’s or sister's children, the nearer to the deceased deprives the remoter from an inheritance. The provisions of this Article will also be applied in the case of the heirs of the third degree. Article 891.

Relationship is of two kinds: Relationship by blood and relationship by marriage. Article 1032. Relationship by blood involves the following order of precedence. First class: father, mother, children and children of children; Second class: G-randfathers and grandmothers, brothers and sisters and their children; Third class: Paternal uncles, paternal aunts, maternal uncles and maternal aunts and their children. The degree of relationship by blood in each class is determined by the number of generations in that class. For example, in the first class, the relation of the father and the mother to their children comes first and the relationship of children between themselves comes second; in the same way in the second class, the relation of brother and sister with grand father and grandmother comes first and that of the chil en o' brother and sister with grandfather and father c ^ m ® s sec ° n • , in the third class, the relation of the uncle and the maternal un , and that of the paternal aunt and the maternal aunt come firs , that of their children comes second. Article 1033.

Article 1198 0 A man is only obliged to maintain another if he is in a position to do so? that _uo to say that he can provide such maintenance without thereby causing himself distress. To determine whether a man can maintain another his obligations and his manner of life must be taken into consideration- Article 1199- Maintenance of children is the duty of the father. On his death or his incapacity for maintenance,, this duty devolves on the paternal grandfathers,, the nearer of kin coming before the farther. In the absence of a father or paternal grandfathers or in the event of their incapacity, the duty of maintenance devolves on the mother. If the mother is dead also or is unable to maintain the child, the duty will devolve on maternal grandfathers and grandmothers and paternal grandmothers who are sufficiently wealthy to provide maintenance, giving preference to the nearer of kin over the farther. If a number of the grandparents are similar in degree of kinship, the maintenance expenses must be paid by them in equal shares. Article 1200, Maintenance expenses of parents must be paid by the nearest related child or grandchild in the order of kinship. Article 1201. If a person has relatives both ascending and descending in the direct line who are equally under an obligation to provide for his living, the relatives in question must share the expenses in equal shares. It follows therefore that if the person who is to be maintained has father, mother and direct children, his expenses should be shared in equal portions by his father and children without the mother being required to pay any share. In a like manner if a person who is to be maintained has a mother and direct children, his expenses must be born in equal shares by the mother and the children. Article 1202. If the relatives who are to be maintained are numerous and the supporter cannot pay for them all, the claim of the relatives in the descending direct line has priority over that of relatives in the ascending line.

Maintenance of relatives consists of providing dwelling, clothing, food and furni.ture to the extent of bare necessaries and subject to the means of the person who provides the maintenance. Article 1205, A person entitled to maintenance, whether a wxfe or a relative, can refer to the court and ask for the provision of maintenance. rticle 1206.

'hakim' (paragraph 28, and passim) evidently means a 'hakim- 1 -Shar'', or judge of a shar' court, and not the more ordinary meaning of 'Governor'. 2. The words 'lazim' and 'ja'iz' (articles 61, 638, and •passi m') evidently 'permissive' or 'revocable'. as applied to contracts mean respectively 'binding t! and •^ ie Vl ' or&lt; 3- surf' (article 141 and passim ) evidently refers to 'usage' or 'custom'. ^ The w °rd '’ivasain' (article 286) evidently signifies the thing sold, and the price or consideration given for it — one might perhaps translate 'the two substitutes'. The word ''ivaz' (not ''avaz' as one might think from the spelling) in article 338 evidently means the consideration given for a thing purchased. 5. 'ujrat-ul-misl' seems to mean properly 'the reasonable equivalent', or perhaps 'the reasonable price'. 6. '’ain-i-kulli' (article 482) and 'bai-i-kulli' (article 414) are at first sight difficult terns to translate. An 'ain-i-kulli' is apparently an object which forms one of a species of well-known and very similar objects, e,g, an apple, or a potato. Such objects are bought and sold according to their number, or in a large quantity, and need not be distinguished one from another as individuals. A similar idea is contained in the term 'misli' (article 950), meaning replaceable things, as distinct from things called 'qaimi', each of which is capable of being valued separately. 7. The difference between the ,M ain' and the 'manfa’at' of a thing is a fundamental conception which occurs more than once. Cf. article 314, The '’ain' denotes the fundamental essence of the thing, without any regard to the profits it earns; whereas the 'manfa’at' denotes the profits; e.g. in the case of a qanat or water-channel the '’ain' denotes the water of the qanat. In tne case of a house, a 'manfa'at' might arise simply owing to the house standing still, while land-values rise. 8. The words 'tafrit' and 'ta'addi' are continually recurring; the former means 'encroachment' or 'going beyond the proper limits , and the latter 'waste' or 'destructive user'; the two words together are usually translated 'excessive use and waste'. (B) Notes on particular points of translation or interpretation Article 36. The words 'sabah-i-numallik' appear to mean 'any cause which gives rise to proprietory rights'. 38. The words 'hava' and 'qarSr' are contrasted; the latter refers to whatever is fixed in the ground. M. The words 'habs-i-mutla q ' refer to an unconditional dedication• » Wi th no specification of the pious object to which or endowment; i-e- WJ - the ftmd is to be devoted. T , read 'tausif' instead of 'tarsif' in the text; the 11 °. :r^ r _„ &gt;'strength' or 'solidity', but tine Iranian lawyers say “ meaning 'by way of yasf', i.e. -by way of marks, or indications'. 236 The language of the drafter is very complicated, though the meaning is very simple. rxo The word 'arsh' appears to be a technical word meaning the difference between the value of a thing in good condition and the same thing in a damaged condition. So it is equivalent to 'depreciation owing to damage'. 286 For the difference between 'misli' and its counterpart 'qaimi' see*the General notes above, paragraph 6. Of the two alternative translations which I have given, I imagine the first is the more accurate. 312. The words translated 'last price' are very perplexing. According to a local lawyer, the meaning is the last price which the thing had before it ceased to have any value at all; which is mani festly absurd; the meaning must be the last price at the time of seizing. 307 and 336. The meaning of the word 'istifa' is not very clear; it appears to mean two different things; (a) 'taking advantage of a right” and (b) 'realising a claim'; in this place the former, (a), is no doubt intended. 364. The expression 'bai’-i-sirf' appears to mean a sale of cash against cash - e.g. the sale of gold coin against silver coin. I am informed by a local lawyer, however, that this article, No. 364, is at variance with articles 33, 34, and 35 of the Law concerning Registration of Documents of 1310; and where the two disagree it is the Law concerning Registration of Documents which is binding* For 'bai-i-kulli' see the General remarks above, No.6. 429. The words 'thaman-i-shakhsi' are very perplexing, but according to an Iranian lawyer they mean 'fixed price' in the sense that the thing sold is converted not into cash but into the equivalent, another .object; e.g. where a house is the price paid for the sale of a carpet; in fact, the words allude to bartering one object against another. 473. ^ The meaning is very badly put; the intention is merely to sub let^^ ^ Qj[Meen a P ro P r ietor and a lessee who has the right to A difficult article to translate.

The meaning of the latter portion is said to be that the : legacies are paid m the order mentioned in the will the first mentioned being paid in full first, and the process continued up to the third share; all the other legacies after that are therefore of no titicf;v effect. But if for instance the will says that 10,000 tomans are left ■ ,J&gt; 'Vw, ” t0 t!l f f i 0 h°f- n S objects......', without specifying how much is to go to each ooject 5 then the third share is spread over all the objects 'S Cttmtte-i. nord a. yan s one of the many plurals of the word ; ain' tsoalte^ a PP ears tc mean the capital value of an estate as distinct from the ’ usufruct or the profits. 873.

The valuation of 'a'yan' appears to be a valuation on the basis that the trees or buildings which compose the 'a'yan' are dead or useless material incapable of yielding a profit; though in that case it is difficult to see what real value they would have. tion is ^ astlierr sf’Wf if * t ' 965. The word 'vali' denotes a gqardian, and the woid q ayyim means also a guardian, but the latter word appears limited to guardians of minor children. 993. 'Bazl-i-muddat' is a curious phrase, denoting the grant by a husband of the remaining period of a temporary marriage, i.e* ie husband releases his temporary wife after the expiration o on y a certain portion of the period of marriage. 1055. The exact meaning,of the phrase 'sexual in^ercouroe doubtful nature* escapes me. 1070. The article evidently refers to the period af^er the 'aqd' or marriage contract, and befo re the 'arfisi' or physical marnage. 1093.
