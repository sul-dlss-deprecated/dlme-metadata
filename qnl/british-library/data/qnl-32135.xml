Lieutenant Colonel Cox recommends that Hamid Pasha’s request should be granted, but having regard to the complaints made in the past by the Jaudi Government, to the effect that Hamid Pasha was implicated in anti- Saudi intrigue, I shall be grateful for your advice whether the removal of the restriction of Hamid pasha’s entry into Trans-Jordan would be distasteful to Ring Aodul Aziz and his Government, or likely to arouse z^enewed suspicion in their minds* 3* I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies, and to His Majesty's Ambassador at Baghdad.

Sir . ..the honour to report that His Highness the Amir Abdullah arrived m Bagdad from Amman on the afternoon of the 1st April, accompanied ^ is younger son, the Amir Naif, and his principal private secretary, Sheikh I uad Pasha A1 Khatib. ^ 16 ^ay I called on His Highness at the palace. During the course of our conversation I congratulated him on the great improvement which he had succeeded in bringing about in the relations between Transjordan and Saudi Arabia, and expressed the hope that any misunderstandings which still lemained would soon be settled. The Amir echoed this hope and said that he would continue to work to strengthen the bonds of friendship between the two Arab States. I received the impression, however, that His Highness was not speaking to me with his usual frankness. 3. On the 6th April His Highness lunched at the Embassy and in the afternoon was present at a small reception given by King Ghazi, to which Sir Edward Ellington and the Air Officer Commanding were also invited. On the following Sunday he left Bagdad for Amman. 4. The declared purpose of His Highness’s visit was to see his brother, King Ali, whose health has recently been far from good. It may, however, be safely assumed that many matters of wider significance than the ex-King’s health were discussed with King Ghazi, King Ali, and other members of the Hashimite family now in Bagdad. Moreover, the fact that the at one time notorious Akhwan rebel, Farhan-bin-Mashhur (see page 34 of Annual Report for 1930), was present in Bagdad at the same time as the Amir Abdullah, and that on his return the Amir took in his suite the fugitive Ataibah chief, Naif-bin-Humaid, will probably, when reported to Mecca by the Saudi Legation, give rise to profound suspicion of His Highness’s activities here and may even provoke a protest. 5. The Amir’s visit has received little comment in the local press, but one nationalist journal professed to see a significant connexion between this event and Sir Arthur Wauchope’s private visit to me, which took place only a few days earlier. The deduction made was that a political development of great importance to the Arabs was about to take place, which might well be the union of Palestine and Transjordan under the rule of the Amir Abdullah. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty s High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan at Jerusalem and to His Majesty s Minister at Jedda. I have, &amp;c. F. H.

Extract from Palestine Police Summary, Po. 7/34 dated 26th April, 1934 . The War in the Arab PeninsulR. 2. The news of the war between Ibn Sioud and Imam Yehia attracted general interest, and public sympathy was almost wholly on the side of Ibn Sioud, whose firm attitude and defence of Sharia and his rejection of the terms of the treaty with His Majesty’s Government gained for him additional praise. Imam Yehia is not only not popular, but lacks the connections which Ibn Sioud has in Arab countries. The proper intelligence service, which Ibn Sioud has, in regard to spreading propaganda and collecting information, has been proved on several occasions. Fuad Hamzeh and Yousef Yassin, have the strongest ties with the Istiqlal leaders in Palestine, and there is reason to believe that Kheir el Din el Zerakli, who has recently been appointed on the staff of the Arab Saoudite Legation in Cairo, has been serving the interests of Ibn Sioud in Palestine. The cause of the war has been attributed in public gossip to His Majesty’s Government, and, to a degree, to the ambitions of Italy. Emir Abdalla is suspected of active interests and of visiting Iraq for the purpose of discussing a common scheme, and of an agreement with Imam Yehia. Friendly relations between France and Ibn Sioud are remembered, and also the payment by the former of certain Wakf dues, the visit to Hejaz of Fawaz Siiaalan, and grandson of Huri, a supporter of French policy. The peace delegation which proceeded to Hejaz and Yemen under the auspices of the Islamic Congress received general support. Success of the negotiations will add to the/the prestige of Haj Amin Husseini in the Arab and Moslem world at large. His action as peacemaker is believed to be likely to anger Emir Abdalla, The entertainment accorded to the Emir on his recent visit to Jerusalem by Fakhri Nashashibi and Abdel Rahman Taji of the 'Opposition” has been attributed to the desire of the Emir to counteract the action of the Husseini leaders. It is of interest to note that the Young Mens 1 Executive, whose connections with the Mufti faction are well established, have expressed their non-confidence in the Emir f s expected trip to London, It is understood that the Palestine delegation will endeavour while in the Arab Peninsula to secure the cooperation of the two Arab potentates in pan-Arab schemes and to interest them in the Palestine case. Mention must be made here of the reports which have been recently received and which find support in Arab political circles respecting an Italian, Hashemite and Yemenite alliance in which the names of Hassan Khaled Pasha, Emir Abdalla and the ex-Khedive are mentioned.COPY £110/79/28) [o.as fee, ^o/i 9 ) jKCHKT Britleh Legation, J edda» 11th l/aroh] p. z. 2504 4- ? y*'- i Sir, With reference to your telegram Mo.26 of March '6r&amp;, 1 have the hemour to state that I received an March 7th a repetition of Trans-Jordan telegram to the Colonial Office, liO fll that day, expressing concurrence In the proposed reply to Ibn ?• a ’tid’s private message regarding the alleged Ha shim 1 te plot to taJce advantage of the tension between him and the Im&amp;m Yahya* I arranged to call on the Minister of Finance on March 11th# 2# 1 made a statement to rheykh \bdullah Suleyman on the lines of the second paragraph of my telegram Ho#2? of March 1st, omitting In accordance with your instructions any reference to the known connexion of Hasan KM lid \bul Huda with the Kashimlte family# I gave this as a message from Hi© Majesty’s Government# Having in the meantime received a telegram from His Majesty’s Ambassador in Bagdad, Ho.l of March End, repeated to you as No.4 Saving, I felt U, justified in adding something, not as from His Majesty’s Government, regarding the alleged participation of high personages In ’ I rag in the reported plot# I said that although His Majesty’s Government were responsible lor Trans-Jordan and its ruler only, I had also been in communication with Sir Francis Humphry©# Sir Francis, whose friendly dispositions towards Ibn fu’M were well known, had, X said, assured/ e Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G,0.J#X#, K#J.V*0#, etc#, etc#, etc.aBsured Be that he eaw no sign® of any inclination in high cirelee in 'Iraq to engage in intrigue*, directed against King *Vbdul \ztz. j added that rir Francis had referred to a recent letter fro* Ihn Ba'hd expressing satisfaction at the state of his relations with 'Iraq and that I gathered that this had been received with similar satisfaction in Bagdad* 3* in ensuing conversation, Bheyfch ’ ^bduiiah rmleyMn expressed gratitude or the action taken on a communication which had been made for the information of Hie Majesty's Government and in the hope that they would inquire into the matter.

This led the Saudi Ciovernment to believe that their previous information was well*-founded* 2. Taufiq Bey did not refer again to the Aislr Abdullah or his relatives.

(My dear Humphry a), Many thanks for your letter of March 3 enclosing a copy of your letter to Oliphant of February 26 about alleged Intrigues against Ibn Ca’ud and your correspondence with him. This clears up one point on which I see that I went wrong. I thought that the letter from Ibn Se'fcd )^(T^ mentioned in your telegram To. 1 of March 2 was one to King Ghezi. As a matter of fact I do not myself attach much importance to Ibn Salad’s p olltes, os . I think that he is satisfied with his recent relations with ’Iraq but still mistrusts all Has hi mi tea. At present he is even more mistrustful of the Imam Yshya but even in his case he ordinarily uses civil and indeed friendly language. As for me, it bore me to tears to have to spend good British money on telegrams about these recurrent scares but it is the only way of keeping the Saudis quiet and lessening the danger of their thinking, as many of them do, that we ourselves are hostile to Ibn Sa’ud. lou will see by the copy I am sending you of my official despatch to the Foreign Office No. 73 o.f March 18 that they are still worried about Hasan Khalid Abul Hud© but have not returned to the charge about the Hashimite rulers end ex-ruler. iiom what you and Weuchope say it looks as though these three were being duly cautious. Meanwhile, all that really matters here at the moment 1b the Seudi-Yemen situation. It again looks es though war might break out but both sides hsve shown such unwillingness to go over the top that they may compromise. The F.K# Humphry s, G.C.M.G., G.-.t.O., etc., ete., etc., r, British Fmbassy, Bagdad.tne Ablia confer^nc© was © pleassrtly staged farce and gave no promise of a fill®! settlement• Tlie present position is the o the delegates are at Abha doing nothing and their masters a g^i^ telegraphing to each other. The general impression here is that I bn Ss'ud is only waiting until after the pilgrimage to attack but nobody knows what is at the back of his mind. If he goes to war, it will show that his policy has been (a) to make the breakdown of a conference, rather than any particular dispute, the justification for hostilities and (b) to make sure of Ms pilgrimage first. If he does not go to war immediately after the pilgrimage, it will show that he funks it and the chances of a patched up peace will be much improved. I am sending a copy of this to Oliphant.

This letter is in reply to an ordinary friendly letter of mine thanking His Majesty for his signed photograph, which he was kind enough to send me. In King Ibn Sa’ud’s letter 1 see no trace of a charge of unfriendly behaviour on the part of Iraq towards him, rather the contrary, and as His Majesty has been in the habit of writing to me with the greatest frankness, I do not think he would have hesitated to voice a complaint if he was nursing a grievance at the time of wilting the letter, which, you will ohserTe, ie dated the 5th Jfehruary Yours ever, (digued) F* H* HUMFHKYS.Translation iZiZl In tm name of God, the merciful the 'ZompaB si' ona t e .^rab Baud!

The Amir vsias very averse to the suggestion that he might visit Ibn Saud at Jedda on a Cruiser which should then take him on to Suez on his way to England and when it was first put to him believed that if he did not fall in with the suggestion his visit to England would be cancelled. When His Excellency the High Commissioner on his way back from Baghdad called on the Amir on the 34th,the Amir said he hoped Ibn Saud might be informed that the Amir looked forward to meeting him at a later date. His Highness also explained how it is better for the Hashimites that Ibn Saud should be in the Hedjaz rather than the Imam Yahya, since the latter is a liberal Moslem and a Sherif and with his arrival there would remain no great reason for the Hasitaites 1 return. On the 25th* the first day of the Feast, the Amir sent a telegram of greeting to Ibn Saud with the object of conveying to him that he need have no fear of any interference from this direction. He has received a very cordial telegram in reply. 8.

J Sir #ith reference to Foreign Office letter No. iu 56o5/2*53/25 of the 19th July, and to previous correspondence regarding the proposed personal meeting between King Ibn Baud of iaudi Arabia and the Amir Abdulla of Trans Jordan, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to request you to inform the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty 1 s Treasury that advantage has been taken of the presence in this country of His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda to discuss with him and with the Interested departments of His Majesty’s Government the practical difficulties connected with the proposed meeting. 2. Subject to any alterations or modifications which may be necessary later, the most suitable arrangements for this meeting appear to be as follows. 5. In concurring generally in the proposal that the meeting should take place on board one of His Majesty’s ships. King Ibn Ssud stated that, so far as he was concerned, the most suitable date would be some time in the two Moslem months following the 17th January, 19c4. The Admiralty state that only one sloop will be available in the Red Sea during January of next year. On the other hand, one of His Majesty s cruisers is due to leave England for the East on about the 3th January next, and would normally be in the vicinity of the The Secretary to the reasury*the Gulf of Akabe on or about the 22n£jranuary. The Secretaiy of State understands that it may be possible to delay the onward journey of this cruiser for a short time for the purposes of the proposed meeting. The plan, therefore, now suggested - subject to the formal approval of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty - is that the cruiser should proceed to Akaba, and that the High Commissioner and the Amir should embark at that port and snould proceed to the vicinity of some Saudi port, possibly Wejh, or any other port north of that place to which King Ibn Sand would be prepared to proceed independently and at his own cost. King Ibn Baud would then be embarked on board the cruiser in question where the formal meeting of the two sovereigns would take place. The meeting having duly ta en place off the Saudi coast, King Ibn Baud would be landed at or near the place of his embarkation, and the High Commissioner and the Amir would be conveyed back to Akaba in the cruiser. Sir Andrew Ryan would be conveyed from Jedclo to the meeting-place and back again in the sloop which would normally be available at that date in the Red Sea. 4. Until the details of this plan can be worked out and agreed on and until, for instance, it is known how far north along the Saudi coast King Ibn Saud is prepared to proceed on his own resources, it is impossible uo give any accurate estimate of what the expenditure involved is likely to be. I am to exolain, however, that at a preliminary inter-departmental meeting which was held on lUth Septembci to discuss this question, it was estimated that, asoiimlng that the meeting took place off Wejh, the extra cost of steaming for5. for the cruiser together with the total cost of entertainment (including, besides the incidental expenses of the actual meeting, the cost of entertaining Sir Arthur Wauchope and the Amir on the journey from Akaba to Wejh end back end sir Andrew Ryan on the journey from tXe&amp;da to lejh end back) would amount together to approximately £640 or possibly less, end it was suggested that, subject to the concurrence of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s treasury, the total expenses of the meeting should be borne as follows. King Xbn Saud would of course be responsible for the expenses of his own journey to and from the point of his embarkation on the cruiser; similarly, it is understood that the Colonial Office consider that the cost of conveying Sir Arthur auchope and the Amir from Jerusalem or Amman to Akaba and back might reasonably be charged to Palestine and Transjordan funds. There remains the expenditure provisionally estimated at £640 referred to above. I am to suggest, for Their Lordships' consideration, that this expenditure should be charged to the Diplomatic and Consular, and to the Colonial and Middle-Eastern Services votes, in equal shares. His Majesty’s Government will be the host at this meeting, and it therefore seems appropriate that the charge for this part of the scheme should fall upon them. It is understood, subject to confirmation by the Colonial Office, that the secretary of State for the Colonies concurs in this proposed division of the expenditure. Sir John Simon is informed that the Admiralty would not propose to make any charge for the steaming of the sloop which would take Sir Andrew Ryan from Jedda to ejh and back, since this would be regarded as part of the sloop’s normal routine - but this point is naturally subject to Admiralty confirmation.5. The agreement of the two rulers has still to be obtained in the scheme outlined above. Subject, however, to the necessity for subsequent change of plan, I am to invite the concurrence of Their Lordships in the proposal that a moiety of the cost of the extra journeys which the cruiser is required to make, together with the cost of entertainment connected with the meeting, may be p i id from the Diplomatic and Consular Vote - Sub-Head L (Special Missions). 6# Copies of this letter are being sent to the Colonial Office and the Admiralty.

Sir, Jedda, May 8 , 1933. k-7Ai- } J m/ J WITH reference to my telegram N o. 93 of the 5th May, I have the honour to submit a general report on the recent negotiations with a view to a treaty settle ment between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan. I will endeavour to make this despatch and its enclosures as self contained as possible, avoiding back reference except when it is essential. 2. The mission from Transjordan arrived in Jedda on the 22nd April, accompanied by Mrs. Cox. The party were welcomed with every mark of distinction both on board ship and at the quay, where they were received by Fuad Bey Hamza, the Governor of Jedda, and myself among others. Arrangements had been made to accommodate them as Government guests at the Kandara villa outside the town. If the arrangements there were not perfect at all points from a European point of view this was due to no lack of courtesy or goodwill. The formal dinners given by the Saudi Government, the Governor of Jedda and the Amir Feisal on the evenings of the 22nd to the 24th April were well managed functions. I do not think that the King can be accused of discourtesy in delaying his arrival in Jedda until the conference was nearly at an end, although an earlier arrival might have contributed to a happier result. He perhaps pushed oriental formality to an extreme in making no reference to the object of the mission s visit when he received us on the 3rd May, especially as he confined his personal inter course with the mission to that single audience. . 3. I enclose a diary of the visit of the mission from the 22 nd April to the 5th May. Fuad Bey came to tea at the Legation on the 22nd April and we arrange certain points of procedure. As our own drafts vyere not quite ready, we agreed, the more readily to listen at a first formal meeting next day to an exposition by Fuad Bey of points which might arise. He came to the meeting with ei ^ Yussuf Yassin, who acted as his fellow delegate throughout the conference ana who, if there was any inequality, seemed to take the leading part on t e au i [8728]_ A -i it clear that there would be acute differences of our draft on the 24th Api cedure contemplated in it and the definition of rJiit 1 ® opinion both m reg ard to the proceou extraditable offences.^^^^ Qf Friendship alld “ Bon-Voisinage ” having been completed in the interval, it was decided to leave the contentious subject of extra- dition m abeyance and to start discussion of the draft Treaty of Friendship fcW® abeyance^a^ ^ ^ ^ on the hnes 0 f that prepared at Amma. t u C 2 Srd AnriT This draft was also on the lines or tnar prepaieu ar Amma., In Fehruatrsubiect to modifications resulting from Colonial Office telegram 111 feDriiaiy, buujo XTi rrV.

We eventually reached almost complete agreement, except as regards article 2 on a text which was collated by experts in Arabic, including Fuad Bey and Taufiq Bey ear yon the 4th May, before the general meeting that morning. 8 I now turn to the Arbitration Protocol. Before the mission arrived, I had satisfied myself that in our anxiety at Amman in February not to get too far from the Saud'i-Iraq texts we had adapted proposals the practical working of which would be very difficult. I therefore prepared, in agreement with Colonel Cox and Taufiq Bey, a revised draft, which still contemplated recourse to arbitration at the option of eitner party, but which laid down an orderly procedure including provision for the nomination of the piesident of the board by a third Power, not specified, in the event of the parties failing to agree on one. The Arabic of this draft was handed to the Saudi delegates on the 30th April. 9 . After the draft protocol had been thus put forward, Colonel Cox and I became alive to the danger which might result if each party were given unlimited freedom to bring the other compulsorily to arbitration on any question affecting their relations. It was obviously desirable to avoid any possibility of questions like Maan-Aqaba and frontier delimitation being submitted to arbitration of the kind contemplated and it seemed equally desirable to guard against frivolous or petulant recourse to it under general treaty clauses dealing with the broad principles of collaboration. In a general discussion on the 1 st May we led up to n modified proposal, which we reduced to written form next day, that questions under specified articles of the Hadda Agreement and the new Treaty of Friend ship should be made arbitrable at the option of either party but that all others should be submitted to arbitration only by special agreement. The Saudi delegates on the 3rd May demurred to the proposal to establish two categories and to our surprise now plumped for arbitration by special agreement in all cases. It appeared to me that, so far as His Majesty’s Government were concerned, this would give them all that they required as a safety valve in the event of the Saudi Government persisting in unreasonable complaints that Transjordan had not fulfilled obligations and invoking the guarantee of the mandatory power. Colonel Cox agreed and Taufiq Bey was satisfied. Complete texts of the relevant article of the Treaty of Friendship and the Arbitration Protocol were then agreed upon. 10. Up to the eve of the final discussion on the Arbitration Protocol, the k° W President of ^an arbitration board should be appointed, in ' ^ 1 to present difficulty. I was unwilling to m 11 . When we M relevant po life had to, - jfjft of the Tn &amp; Protocol. 1 i so rapid case of non-agreement, continued propose formally that His Majesty’s Government should be named as the third owei, as, though obviously suitable, they will always be identified more with ?? e xr n Wlt A th T other ‘ \ broached the suggestion privately to Fuad Bey on 6 a u’ 1 expected, he demurred to provision in the protocol for ° n HlS Ma J est y ,s Government.

Sheikh Yussuf Yassin was dissatisfied with the list of offences in the text. He was dissatisfied with my explanation that, alhough the offences would be extraditable if they were ordinary offences committed during an armed rising, the competent court would have to appreciate their character, e.g., attempted killing might be ordinary murder or a rebel act. He not only wished the act of armed rebellion to be extraditable, but ^ggested that political activities like those of Hussein and Tahir-ad-Dabbagh should be considered extraditable offences also, a suggestion which I said His Majesty’s Government would in no circumstances countenance, although it would be their duty and the duty of the Transjordan Government to circumscribe such activities by action in their own spheres. 12 . I had on the previous evening told Fuad Bey privately that, in my opinion, it would be far better to abandon the attempt to make an extradition treaty and to concentrate on the provisions in the Treaty of Friendship for dealing with offences on the frontier. Having found Fuad Bey personally amenable, I threw out this suggestion again at the meeting on the 2nd May. The Saudi delegates, after some half-hearted hesitation, accepted it, and we returned in due course to the relevant portion of the draft Treaty of Friendship. 13. We had thus, by the evening of the 3rd May, evolved (a) an almost agreed draft of the Treaty of Friendship, and (b) a completely agreed draft Arbitration Protocol. Progress with the final stages of the discussion of these texts had been so rapid after the King’s arrival in Jedda early on the 3rd May that there seemed to be a prospect of getting them signed late on the 4th May or on the morning of the 5th May. The only subject, apart from article 2 of the Treaty of Friendship, which still preoccupied my colleagues and myself was that of having some working arrangement for determining the nationality of tribes; and in regard to this we should have been satisfied with a composition, reserving in some suitable way the rights of Transjordan in regard to disputed tribes. As described in my telegram under reference, I understood from Fuad Bey that the question of Anglo-Saudi accompanying notes could be dealt with separately in a manner agreeable to me. 14. I do not know what produced the change in the Saudi attitude on the night of the 3rd-4th May. They came to the first meeting on the 4th May with a draft communique already prepared in anticipation of a suspension of the negotiations; and although they capitulated, after a struggle, over article 2 of the Treaty of Friendship, they obviously intended the suspension to take place, none the less. 15. I enclose translations of the ikrabic texts of the two agreements mentioned above, as collated early on the 4th May. I have endeavoured to secure literal accuracy in these translations rather than attempt to reproduce the sense of the Arabic in English legal language. I would ask that they should not be regarded as final until Colonel Cox has had an opportunity of commenting on them. I enclose also a memorandum showing the relaffionship of the texts as they now stand to the Amman drafts, with brief explanations of the divergences, and the draft note which I offered to write if article 2 of the Treaty of Triendsnip were deleted. I gave a copy of this latter draft to the Saudi delegates on tne 4th May. . , 16. I will now deal with various side issues which arose during tire conference in the following paragraphs :— Nationality of Tribes. 17. I enclose a translation of a draft letter prepared on our side in accordance with Captain Glubb’s suggestions and communicated to tne &amp;ai a delegates on the 3rd May. It followed the lines of a suggestion already approTC by His Majesty’s Government as regards the Sherarat, bu ‘ a ® workable in Beni Atiya we had evolved a new solution which seeme Saud. practice and at the same time rather more likely 1 ° a&lt; j? e P w j, en p was The memorandum was discussed on the afternoon ob ,, 7’ oj, f ree t0 dear that there was to be no treaty and when the ® aud CA S that nationality stone-wall our proposals to their hearts’ content. e q • • admission They should be established for all time.

We however prepared on our side a set of possible rules, an English draft of which I endole Although time did not allow of my discussing the final form fully with Colonei Cox and Captain Glubb, it will serve as a basis of future study. 19 The draft treaties and the documents described in the two preceding paragraphs cover most of the points in Fuad Bey’s memorandum, but not the wholl of it The most important left over is probably point (9), dealing with transit through Transjordan, a subject which was discussed to some extent during the conference both at meetings and in private conversation. _ The baudi delegates tried hard to tie us up in an undertaking that Saudi officials passing between Syria and Saudi Arabia should be allowed to do so without obtaining the permission of the Transjordan Government. We insisted that such journeys were governed by article 12 oi the Hadda Agreement, adding that, if we were asked to consent to a special exemption for Saudi officials going to and from Syria, we could only do so on a basis of reciprocity, and should ask that Trans jordanian officials should have a similar right of crossing Saudi territory in case of need, e.g., if the Amir Abdullah had occasion to send a messenger to the Imam of the Yemen. This suggestion rather dashed the enthusiasm of the Saudi delegates. As regards to merchants in transit, we agreed to a clause in the new treaty affirming the continuance in force of article 13. We made it clear, and I explained this more fully to Fuad Bey in conversation, that this merely preserved article 13 of the ITadda Agreement with whatever effects it might be held to produce, a subject as to which difficulty had arisen in the case of certain articles. We expressed readiness to discuss the whole subject of the application of the article at a convenient stage of the conference, but we never got back to it. In this connexion, I threw out to Colonel Cox only that it might suit Transjordan to have in due course a simple form of commercial agreement with Saudi Arabia, covering both trans-frontier trade and transit trade. We had no time to discuss this fully, but I suggest that it should be further considered. 20. The question of Zakat, which is also raised in Fuad Bey’s memo randum, point (16), was mentioned during the discussions, but was not closely debated. / lijfotof 1 j‘j His subjed jiswftibilit: raimderre iikptics di i Tfa subjects fit} Bey Abd ilm.

In the course of the discussions the Saudi delegates mentioned that the Saudi Government contemplated altering their present arrangement under which a single officer, Abdul Aziz-bin-Zeyd, acts as Captain Glubb’s opposite number and to transfer the powers to certain Governors, who, he eventually said, would e the Governors of Tebuk and Qaf. This would affect the working arrangements for meetings, &amp;c. under article 7 of the Treaty of Friendship, and the Saudi delegates proposed to define the arrangements in an annexed letter. This was a 0 ree o m principle, but the draft was never produced. It might perhaps be J e “ b ° dy an T I P r °P° 1 sed arrangements in the Schedule of Rules contemplated m paragraph 18 above. fc^yie Ws K il Wud: Burying of Outstanding Claims. 22.

Colonel Cox and I were willing to write a letter outside the treaty texts giving this undertaking, but we did not get to the point at which it would have been necessary to write the letter. Anglo-Saudi Exchange of Notes contemplated in Paragraph 4 of my Note to the Saudi Government of January 11 . 24. This subject has become one of great importance, owing to the desirability of not doing anything unnecessarily wounding to the Amir ilbdullah’s susceptibilities. I need add nothing here, however, to what I said in my telegram under reference. Hashimite Properties and the Amir's Right to m,ake the Pilgrimage. 25. These subjects were, of course, outside the scope of the conference as such. Taufiq Bey Abdul-Huda did some useful work in connexion with them when in Mecca. As regards the Amir Abdullah’s interest in the properties, I have described the present position in my telegram No. 7, Saving, of the 5 th May. As regards the Amir’s right of pilgrimage, Taufiq Bey elicited from Ibn Baud a satisfactory message to the Amir. It was unnecessary for Colonel Cox or me to intervene in any way. 26. I regret that it should have proved impossible to obtain a final result, limited to the essentials indicated in paragraph 13 above, before the mission left. Nevertheless, the progress made was considerable and, if we parted with some disappointment, there was no serious feeling of dissatisfaction on either side. I do not think that the Saudi Government have any intention of going back on what has already been agreed to. I sincerely hope that His Majesty’s Government and the Transjordan Government will, on their side, be prepared to observe the same attitude in order to reduce the area of work still to be done and to discourage the Saudi Government from reopening settled questions. 27. Fuad Bey Hamza played a useful part in the conference. He was occasionally over-ready to take offence, and I think that he influenced the King in favour of postponement, but in the main he was conciliatory. Sheikh Yussuf Yassin oscillated between his natural tendency to intransigence and hair-splitting and a much more accommodating mood, which, on the whole, prevailed. He probably reflected the King’s personal attitude more faithfully than Fuad Bey. If His Majesty had only come to Jedda a day or two sooner, the result might have been more satisfactory. 28. Colonel Cox and I worked in complete accord. Taufiq Bey followed our lead with admiral loyalty, although towards the end he became a little sensitive lest the views of the Amir on his relations with His Majesty’s Govern ment should be prejudiced. Captain Glubb’s experience and knowledge were of the utmost assistance. I regard his contribution to the recent discussions as the fruit of his work on the frontier, the success of which has done much to create the favourable atmosphere in which it has of late been possible to approach a political settlement. You will allow me to conclude this report with a tribute to my Chancery staff, on whom the work of the conference imposed a great extra strain. I would draw your particular attention to the meritorious work done by Mr. Oppenheim, as British Secretary, and by my chief interpreter, Mendi, who bore one of the heaviest burdens. Mr. Furlonge has superintended the final retranslation of the treaty texts into English. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN.Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Diary of Mission’s Visit: Not printed.] Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Memorandum by Saudi Delegation concerning Points to be submitted for Discussion. (Translation.) (1) Frontiers. . . Pi rst l v The frontier line between Neid and Transjordan has been defined but as regards that between the Hejaz and Transjordan no agreement has been completed. We have undertaken by the Treaty of Jedda to maintam the status auo until the termination of its period ot validity. Secondly. —The frontier line has not been delimited on the spot but is shown on the maps by longitudes and latitudes; as a result of this, disputes have arisen regarding some of these places. (2) Co-operation on the Frontier. Article 3 of the Hadda Agreement indicated that the avoidance of misunder standing and the strengthening of bonds of mutual friendship and full co-operation must be secured by the maintenance of constant communication between the British representative at Amman and the Governor of the Wadi Sirhan. This matter of co-operation has been a question of dispute and argument between the two sides. A number of discussions have taken place as to how it may be effected in a manner which will secure the end desired, but no specific result has come of this except ( 1 ) that some telegraphic and written communication has recently taken place, and that ( 2 ) frontier officials have been appointed from both sides to secure the purpose in view. It is therefore necessary adequately to explain and to reach agreement with the Transjordan delegation on— (First) The scope of this co-operation. (Second) The means of effecting it and putting it into force. (3) Established Rights of Tribes in both Countries. It will be of advantage to the interests of both sides, and will avoid disagreement in respect of the interpretation of the object of article 4 of the Hadda Agreement, if the established rights of the Transjordan tribes in our territories and those of our tribes in Transjordan are specified, whether these rights deal with grazing, settlement or movements. It is also necessary to reach agreement as to the means whereby such rights should be exercised, and to make clear the conditions under which a certain tribe or individual members of it may be deprived permanently or temporarily of the enjoyment of those rights. (4) Questions of Nationality. • j na ti ona lii'y °f certain tribes has not yet been determined, although both sides lay claim to them. For instance, the Atun definitely form part of the Beni AUya, who are our subjects. A number of communications have been made in which the British Government admitted that Auda-al-Atna and his party were our subjects. (5) Tribunals in respect of Looted Property. In article 6 of the Hadda Agreement was laid down the constitution and powers oi a tribunal to deal with Innt.Arl ± more ,1)!PI flttfb 01 f# up® icl i ^ i applies 0 was s s tleir occiii property th necessary Me reasons! |3) lie method ’ without h lit list be undi Pg iu groups P or tribesmen Nhng was s j 5 | )t'tribes and tl «It is then bit, whe: i reject to ‘hticementr a A?r Jr except 3 is re? clause 'Ho CJaltie, . , - h , U P iccned in respect of travel and movement, but every regulation which migh ^ ed ^ The quest ion of transit, either for this condition has not Dee sub jects, is an essential and necessary one commerce or for the migration 01 J for Nejd.

(14) Blood Money. The question of blood money must be clearly agreed upon, because it has been the cause of much dispute. The adoption of the tribal system and tribal custom requires that the amounts to be paid should be estimated. The different varieties of blood money which should be agreed upon are :— ( 1 ) ( 2 ) (3) (4) (5) ( 6 ) Blood money in general. Blood money for a female. Blood money for a cousin (son of father’s brother). Blood money for “ al Buq ” (one under the charge of another). Blood money for the defender.

(18) Agreement upon the Rules governing Hearings. ^ We have already mentioned some of the points which should be [ ? borne in mind] when incidents are being investigated. There are some other questions which are also worthy of consideration. Enclosure 3 in No. 1 . Draft Treaty of Friendship and “ Bon-YoisinageH—Text of May 4, 1933. Article 1. PERMANENT peace and firm and inviolable friendship shall prevail between the Saudi Arab Kingdom and the Amara of Transjordan.

Memorandum on Draft Agreements as Collated on May 4, 1933. N.B.—This memorandum has been drawn up very hurriedly to avoid delay. I hope that I have avoided inaccuracy, but I have confined myself to salient points. The cross-references “Amman —” refer to the drafts prepared in Amman in February, whdeh, though subsequently modified somewhat, were the main basis, except as regards part of the Arbitration Protocol, of the drafts submitted by us to the Saudi delegates. Treaty of Friendship and “ Bon-VoisinageC Preamble .—Not discussed in the conference. The suggestion that, if the treaty were between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan only, Ibn Sand should have precedence in all texts was made in private discussion between Fuad Bey and me. I resisted it strenuously and Fuad Bey finally told me in the same private manner that it would not be insisted on. Article 1 (Amman 1 ).—No difficulty arose except for an academic doubt as to whether the word “permanent” was appropriate in a treaty of limited duration. Article 2 (Amman 2 ).—-Gave rise to great difficulty owing to the insistence of the Saudi delegates on wholly unacceptable suggestions. It was agreed on the 4th May, after the collated draft had been made, to delete the article on the understanding that the question of Saudi representation in Transjordan would be dealt within a diplomatic note to be addressed by me to the Saudi Government. Article 3 (Amman 3).—Paragraph 2 replaces an addition proposed by the Saudi delegates, who wished to provide for notification to the other party in all cases. Colonel Cox thought that it would be dangerous to contract so wide an obligation. His Majesty’s Government finally endorsed the High Commissioner s view that it would make for friendly feeling to accept the addition without qualification, but before w^e received their latest instructions we had seemed acceptance of the clause as it now stands.' Article 4 (Amman 8 ).—The displacement of this and other aitides was effected in deference to Fuad Bey’s view that this would produce a more s .y^ e “ matic arrangement. Various minor alterations were agreed upon, notab y a extending the right of intercommunication to persons acting on behalt o ne special officers. Article 5 (Amman 4 ).—The present text was the result of close discussion on points of detail, especially in regard to the aetion to be taken in cases o ur S en cy. Article 6 (Amman 5 ).—The present text was the result o c ose aI * P longed discussion. It may require a slight drafting amendmen o r ® possible ambiguity due to the position in the Arabic text of the woi s ‘within his territories.” As regards the substance, paragrap - fishing the principle that loot seized in the possession of raiders lia £ &amp; . j the frontier should be returned at once and in full, leaving e 9 regards and punishment to be dealt with in due course. Paragraph &gt; Although fhe nature of the subsequent action, with three categoues o standpoint of the text of the article as a whole is open to criticism from the stand^ European legal conceptions, it provides a s y^e m wm c ^ practical conditions on the frontier# The mode pealing w^ fo the country in which the raid was committed was p P parties getting away from extradition.

This was agreed to in principle, but the letter was not drafted. _ . Article 8 (Amman 10) was the subject of much discussion but m its final form it calls for little comment. We made it clear on our side that although we did not insist on an express mention of arbitral decisions m paragraph 2 , we regarded it as covering any decisions which might be arrived at m diplomatic discussion or as the result of any arbitration necessitated by the failure of such discussion. We pressed for paragraph 3 in order to remove any possible doubt regarding the already implied supersession of article 6 of Hadda. Article 9 (Amman 6 ).—We felt on onr side that this article did not hang together very well but we preferred to overlook minor discrepancies. In agreeing to the cross-reference to article 13 of Hadda, we explained that we regarded it merely as an affirmation of the validity of that article, without prejudice to the many doubtful points in regard to its interpretation, which we expressed readiness to discuss at another stage, if necessary. Article 10 (Amman 7).—“Armed” was substituted for “military 5 ' in paragraph 1 in order to give the clause its proper extension. We deleted the words “ in order to aid in the suppression of rebellion,” &amp;c., as being an irrational qualification of a restriction obviously intended to be general. Paragraphs 2 and 3 are a compromise evolved to counter an insistent Saudi proposal to debar either side from enlisting subjects of the other. We contested hotly this attempt to alter the whole purpose of the original article. We ourselves suggested, with some hesitation and only for the sake of agreement, the solution embodied in paragraphs 2 and 3. As they now stand they differ only very slightly from a draft prepared by us to meet the Saudi delegates as far as possible. Article 11 (Amman 11 ) presented little difficulty. We contested an attempt to impart into it a provision that Saudi officers might cross Transjordan without permission on their way to and from Syria, and maintained that this subject, if discussed, must be discussed separately. Colonel Cox and I agreed to write a ettei making the principle of the article applicable to officers in British service m iransjordan. Article 12 (Amman 12 ). The words “ refuse sanction ’’ emerged after much iscussionot the Saudi contention that travellers should be vr evented from ciossmg e frontier. We were ready to agree to anything in reason, but we ° U - a a k undertaking to prevent all travellers from proceeding could t e came on m practice, and was open to other objections of a legal nature. rbffi^l^T 13 Wa§ omitted together, as being non-essential, in view of the aimculty of agreeing on a text. stani^r^ii nian f 9 over i n g despatch as regards the circum- is clear I ™ LT 1 &lt; A Wa 'l ? 1 Vel V t ?

Article 1 (Amman 1).—Presented no difficulty. Articles ^ to ^ replace Amman 2 to 5.—The covering despatch explains the ircumstances in which the principle of arbitration by special agreement on each xasion was substituted for that of arbitration at the option of either party; and in which an intervening proposal to provide for the appointment of a president by a third Power in the event of non-agreement between the parties was discarded. The three articles provide for a sequence of proceedings on lines suggested by the British delegates. There is an error of drafting or collation to be corrected in the last sentence of article 2 , which was intended to provide for mutual communication of duplicates of documents forwarded to the president. Article 5 (Amman 6 ).— c&lt; Possible ” was inserted at the request of the Saudi delegates and was accepted by us as being reasonable in itself. It can hardly increase materially the danger of such a refusal of facilities as occurred when Mr. MacDonnell was denied access to Nejd. Whatever the wording dangers of this kind must be anticipated, if there is not goodwill on the Saudi side. Article 6 (Amman 7).—The Arabic text needs the addition of the “the right ” or some equivalent to make it coherent. Article 7 (Amman 8 ).—Presents no difficulty. Article 8 (Amman 9).—The Saudi delegates suggested at first that the losing side should pay the salary of the president, &amp;c. They withdrew this suggestion, which presented obvious difficulty, when it was decided to adopt the principle of arbitration by special agreement. Article 9 (Amman 10).—The Saudi delegates were a little sticky about the clause for prolongation of validity to enable pending cases to be disposed of, but the collated text to which they agreed seems to provide for this adequately. In any case the matter is of small importance, once it has been established that each arbitration must be preceded by special agreement. ANDREW RYAN. Jedda, May 8 , 1933. oi a d in iW filch i to teinfK by Bis 11 °»ja* A# Enclosure 6 in No. 1. Draft British Note on Saudi Representation in Transjordan. Your Royal Highness, (After Compliments.) IN the course of the negotiations leading up to the conclusion of the Treaty of Friendship and “ Bon-Voisinage ” signed to-day by the representatives of His Majesty the King of Saudi Arabia and His Highness the Amir of Trans jordan, it was agreed to reserve the considerations of article 2 of the draft treaty proposed for discussion on the 24th April as being a matter intimately connected with the relations between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of Saudi Arabia. In view of the difficulties ’which have attended every attempt to reconcile the divergence of views relative to this article, my Government authorised me, with the concurrence of His Highness the Amir of Transjordan, to propose t a it should be deleted from the treaty and to embody in a diplomatic note to your Royal Highness the following understanding, namely : {a) That the diplomatic representation of the interests of Saudi Arabia in Transjordan shall be exercised by the diplomatic represen a ion o former country in the United Kingdom; and . , tii h {b) That the consular interests of Saudi Arabia m Transjqr a , ij exercised bv a consul, whom the Government of bail * . su a c V h a^cons^Hs ^appomteffi ttto^rnment o?

(a) The following tribes and their sections shall be regamed as being of Transiordan nationality, without prejudice to any altciation in their juridical status which might result from a final settlement of the question of sovereignty over the Maan Aqaba area :— Huweytat-ash-Shimal (Ibn Jazi), including the Atun, but excluding Auda-al-Atna and his immediate relatives, i.e., sons, brothers and nephews. Beni Sakhr. Sirhan. Isa. isa.

(c) Any member of the Sherarat concerned in an incident which makes it necessary to determine his nationality 7 shall be deemed to be of the nationality of the country in wfiich he and his family were encamped at the time of the incident, or immediately 7 previous to it in the case of a rapid continuous movement from one territory to the other, e.g., a raid.

As regards paragraph 13 of your despatch, I have tha following comments to offer on the suggestions made by the Air Officer Commanding for the improvement of relations between Transjordan and timU Arabia. (a) It would undoubtedly b© useful if more frequent meetings could take place between Captain Glubb and Ibn 2:eid. This question is now being dealt with in the Treaty negotiations between Transjordan and Saudi Arabia, and there is reason to hope that satisfactory arrangements will be reached m a result of those negotiations. (b) As you are aware, the question of the frontier between Transjordan and iejd presents considerable difficulties, and in addition there is always the risk that any proposal for the demarcation of that frontier might open up prematurely the question of the frontier between Trans jordan and the Bejas, which at present rests upon a purely je facto and provisional agreement, would, therefore, deprecate the suggestion that the frontier should be demarcated at the present time. (a) and (d) I agree that it would be undesirable to bring pressure to bear on the Amir to issue orders which there is reason to think could not hm made i^elive, Jt to attempt to forbid correspondence between the Amir and th© Governor of Telma* more especially if 9mh action should, as in the latter case, be distasteful and humiliating to tha Amir. A* regards (&amp;) ho*ver. I would point out that direct correspondence between the Amir and the Governor of Ueiaa comes dangerousl near reing infraction.2.7.2 infraction, in S pi ri t if not in lattar. of .rtiole 9 of the va dda kgmimnt, which proridas that «fh. aorer^nt. of Sejd Md Trans-Jordan .nay not correspond with the Chiefs and Sheikhs of tribes subject to the other State on official or political .natters'.

A letter of recognition for the use of the Amir Abdullah was also drafted and on the 18th was shewn to His Highness and accepted by him as suitable. 7. The Amir when first confronted with the Tribal Offences Settlement Law, 1933, which provides that exclusive jurisdiction to deal with raiding cases where a foreign country is concerned shall be in the hands of the Officer Commanding the Arab Legion or an officer appointed by him, raised a number of objections; these have now been examined by the High Commissioner who has called upon the Amir to have the Law passed without modification. It is to be placed before the Legislative Council. &gt;4*V /“s /-s S**-' Decypher » Sir A» Ryan (jedda) D. Eo Nods.

[E 2541/233/25] No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received May 16) (No. 119.) n WI ™ rf rence to my despatch No._118.of the 16th ApS f Ce'the honour to state that after consulting Fuad Bey Hamza and satisfying myself that it might be useful to nave a business conversation with the King before the arrival of the Transjordanian mission, I applied for a further audience and was received by His Majesty on the lith April. 2. I took the opportunity of presenting Mr. Oppenheim to the King After he had retired, His Majesty left it to me to start the business conversation. I reviewed at some length the events leading up to the recent recognition of each other by Ibn Saud and the Amir Abdullah, stressing the evidence they had afforded of the friendship of His Majesty’s Government towards the King and his Government. I said that a further stage was now impending. It might be attended by difficulty, one of the reasons being that His Majesty’s Government had expressed readiness to accept a definite responsibility for the execution of undertakings entered into by the Amir and Government of Transjordan. This made it necessary that they should not only know the nature of such under takings, but should assure themselves that they were such that His Majesty’s Government could discharge the obligation implied in their guarantee. I asked the King to bear this in mind, when questions were referred to him during the negotiations and to remember that, if at any point His Majesty’s Government took up an attitude distasteful to him, it would be due not to lack of friendship, but to a desire to avoid future controversy. 3. Ibn Saud replied, also at some length and with animation, but his state ments were not closely reasoned and I observed the same curious appearance of preoccupation as at my formal audience of the 15th April. His main thesis was the familiar one that he expected his friends, the British Government and myself, to see him through and that there need be no difficulties, if they were willing to do so. He described himself more than once as the older friend, meaning that he was an older friend of His Majesty’s Government than the Amir Abdullah. He suggested that as the Amir’s delegate would have the support of British officials in Transjordan, his own representatives should have mine. 4. I persevered in my attempt to impress on the King the consideration that His Majesty’s Government must make certain that they could ensure the execution of any undertakings they endorsed. I pointed out, a apropos of a reference by the King to Arabs generally, that the Arabs were a large family in which family quarrels occurred and that His Majesty’s Government came into their affairs from outside. They desired to do their best for all Arabs, but they stood towards different sections of them in a variety of relationships. They dealt with His Majesty as an independent ruler. They considered the feelings of the Amir Abdullah and his people, but they had authority and responsibility m regard to them. I cited as an illustration a recent incident. The authorities in Transjordan had been trying to round up one Karayim-bin-Atiya, in order h) put him out of the way of harming the King. I had just heard that the King had recently entertained this man as his guest. I said I had no oojection to this. It was an Arab way of doing things. My. point was that if the same man were shown favour by the Amir Abdullah, it would be my u } deprecate it , 5- The King was voluble in explanation of his attitude towards Karayim Ypch he put down to the fact that he had been asked, and asked b T the Amir Abdullah himself, to be forgiving towards the Beni Atiya. I repeated tha mentioned the incident only as an example of a case , n. nment favour to a late enemy and in the counterpart of whic \ [795 q—1]2 , o -i? f&gt;,pv ViAfl nromised to secure the execution of a treaty artich w° u ld not be fr^ if ^ yh d ^ an enenly of the King.

My object has been to show that His Majesty’s Government must consider their own future responsibility with great care, if the treaties are to breed friendship 7 With regard to what I have said m this and my despatch under reference regarding Ibn Sand’s state, 1 may mention that my Italian colleague told Mr. Furlonge spontaneously that he had found the King distrait and disinclined to initiate subjects of conversation, though he had been charmed by his smile. My impression is that the King is suffering from a good deal of nervous strain He seemed tired and unusually anxious to end the conversation summarised above. It is true that it was rather long and that His Majesty was probably overdue for his mid-morning meal, but I have never known him show quite so much polite anxiety to see me go. ™ • , T t- t 8.

I promised history of statement based on your despatch T. 0.53/32 of June 10th. He said Saudi counter case would probably not be ready until he reached Jerusalem i took advantage of this to say that I was in a similar position regarding list of excepted Beni Atiya. I agreed that outstanding questions of nationality were in reality oi minor importance and suggested subject to insistence f -of importance of maintaining rights of Sirhan in Wadi Sirhan that range of controversy had been so narrowed that could agree on much and cover the rest/n reservations*) Head 3. I said I did not expect Wisaqa to present difficultydifficulty and suggested that Cia could hut be discussed with experts in Jerusalem. We agreed that all other matters had now become questions ox drafting and that margin of difference % sufficient!;/ reduced to make it safe to proceed with the second next month.

Saudi-Transjordan treaty negotiations). After consultation with Colonial Office, following are my views. .Heading 7: Compromise suggested hy Saudi Government can he accepted. Heading 2: Observations of High Commissioner on your telegram No. 128 to Transjordan are awaited. Sirhan. (a) Negotiations should not be allowed to break down on this question, which appears to be the only one still likely to involve serious difficulty. (b) I agree that it is desirable to avoid changing agreed text of treaty. (c) If your conversation with King unfortunately proves not to have led to desired modification of Saudi attitude on this point following proposal might, subject to your viev/s and those of High Commissioner, be made to Saudi Government. As exception to general provision regarding arbitration, if difficulty arises in practice and either High Contracting Party request reference of question of nationality of dirhan to arbitration, the other High Contracting Party should not have right to refuse. 2. Final..*2. 2 c Pinal paragraph of your telegram No.l27 (of 12th June) to Transjordan raises general question of procedure.

It does not in my opinion destroy its value as party refuses arbitration, puts itself to some extent in the wrong and in this case non Baud might well be deterred from drastic action by the knowledge that a demand for arbitration by Iransjordania in accordance with a reservation foreshadowing it, would have support of His Majesty’s Government, In any case danger of confiscation of property though not negligible is not in my opinion great 0 Yussuf * s bark is a very different thing from Ibn Baud’s bite 0 Cannot list of Beni Atiya claimed as Transjordan subjects be expedited? I had understood that it was mere question of tabulating result of effective division of tribe into two categories last November. Position is this. We have agreed, to attempt settlement of major question before second stage of conference and to aim at holding latter in July.. Ibn Baud regards nationality of Beni Atiya as major question but has promised to consider a list of exceptions which I, on my sido, promised to finish as soon as possible. List will also certainly oe disputed. Even if Saudi Government agrees to attend meeting in Jaly in spite of the fact that matt or has not been settled beforehand dispute over it may easily imperil success of that meeting. Alternatively, if list cannot he ready until mid July and I await it here, prolonged delay will ensue with risk to my health and destruction of my plan not go ment.ion more serious disadvantage.

Special officers should have the right to attend meetings by proxy except in case of officers acting for them in their post. In my opinion it would be most dangerous to allow them to send subordinates to represent them at periodical meetings. There is some chance of governors or acting governors shouldering responsibility but much less chance in the case of subordinates. I cannot how ever take up different position as regards Transjordanian special officers. Indeed having regard to importance of meetings I should personally see advantage in appointing both officer commanding Arab legion and officer commanding desert patrol or persons acting you May 30th) explains the position regarding r^isaqa.

These gardeners were the ancestors of some of the present fellaheen in Wady Sirharu Assertion of Glubb regarding Article 4 of Hadda Agreement was that provision about right ownership was probably inserted on account ^ ^ r haii because no other tribes were known to possess immovable Sporty there.• ’ / U.emaUvea i n talegr^ No.119 I am afraid (c) xb inqjracticaole 81n ca it has b een decxdad that arhit^ior ahall be only by agreement.

It is necessary therefore to consider (a) in case a breakdown can be avoided only by withdrawal of Trans-Jordan demand for admission that Sirhan are their subjects. The only references to nationality remaining in the draft treaty as collated on the dth of May are Articles 6 and 10. The proposed treatment of raiders does not greatly vary according to nationality and it should not be difficult to eliminate question from the former Article. It may be easier to rsaaa agreement to avoid reference to nationality in Article 10 than to obtain Saudi admission that Sirhan are Trans-Jordanians *1. fei'ii reference to my telegram No,51 to you repeated to Coicnial Office No.70 it is not expected that complete list of excepted Beni Atiya will be ready before the middle of7.

HIS Majesty s Minister at Jedda presents his compliments to His Maiestv’q Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to trTsmit to him copy of a note to Fuad Bey Hamza, dated the 19th March resnecZ. measures taken to counteract anti-Saudi activities. ^ es P ectln S Jedda, March 19, 1933. Enclosure in No. 1. Sir A . Ryan to Fuad Bey Hamza. (Personal and Confidential.) Dear Fuad Bey, Jedda, March YOUR Excellency lias on many occasions during the last few months made communications to Mr. Hope Gill and myself regarding activities in Transjordan and elsewhere directed against the maintenance of the authority of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz in this country. We have had frequent conversations on the subject, in which I have emphasised two things, viz. :— {a) The strong desire of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to repress such activities in territories which they control or in which they can use influence; and (&amp;) My personal conviction, which I believe to be shared by my Government, that, so far as Transjordan is concerned, nothing will do so much to discourage such activities as the completion of the negotiations for a general political settlement on which we are now engaged. As I told you in our last conversation on the subject on the 4th March, I devoted much personal attention to this matter during my recent journey to Cairo, Jerusalem and Amman. I am now authorised to give you a general statement under three heads regarding the action taken :— 1. Activities of the Dahhagh Family and their Associates. The enquiries made by the British authorities regarding the facts brought to their notice at various dates last year left no doubt that a number of persons, mostly of Hejazi origin, were engaged in a conspiracy against the present regime in this country. Immediate action was taken to prevent them from using as a base Aden, the first place in which their activities came to light. When it was discovered that the persons concerned were active elsewhere, further measures were taken to counteract their efforts. These measures culminated in the decision taken in the latter part of last year to exclude from Transjordan and Palestine the following persons, who were regarded as specially dangerous Hussein Abdullah-ad-Dabbagh. Tahir-bin-Meo’ad-ad-Dabbagh. Othman Arab. Abdur-Rauf-as-Sabban. Ahmed Abdullah Aishan. Abdul Aziz-at-Tayyar. [767 c—3]/ r r L i Ifii n i 'Ji *,,, ■ i! lis T mav add that, as a result of representations made by my Government, the F^ntian Government have also ordered the exclusion of the above-named persons from their territory, and they have warned other persons permanently resident in Egypt of the importance of refraining from undesirable activities. TFp enforcement of the exclusion orders mentioned above presented some difficulty at the outset. Further measures have been taken recently to make them completely effective. 2 Persons in the Emwloynnent of His Highness the Amii Abdullah who have been accused by the Saudi Government of Im V ro V er Activities. At the time of the first enquiries Abdur-Rauf Bey As Sabban held a minor post in the service of the Amir. He was dismissed from this post several months Lo and was subsequently dealt with on the lines indicated above. A more difficult problem arose in connexion with two more important persons mentioned in communications from your Government, namely, the Amir Shakir and Hamid Pasha A1 Wadi. It is true that their names have been used by the conspirators mentioned above, but my Government and General W auchope have discovered no proof of their complicity, and have felt unable to request His Highness the Amir Abdullah to dismiss them from his service, do make such a request, without adequate grounds, would have been peculiarly delicate in the case of the Amir Shakir who is closely related to the Amir Abdullah, and hardly less delicate in the case of the head of the Divan of His Highness. Aly Government and General Wauchope fully realised, however, that the use made of the names of these two persons had of itself created an undesirable situation. The Amir Shakir has been strongly urged to avoid anything which might compromise him. The question of Hamid Pasha has been solved by his departure from Amman on the 7th March in consequence of his election as a member of the Iraqi Chamber of Deputies. As your Excellency has attached particular importance to the meeting between the Amirs Talal and Shakir with Tahir-ad-Dabbagh and others in Jerusalem on the 15th December, I may explain that the visit of the two Amirs to Jerusalem was a normal one. The Amir Talal informed the British Resident at Amman of it beforehand, and the Amirs stayed at their usual hotel. By an unfortunate coincidence, Tahir-ad-Dabbagh, having evaded the measures taken against him, arrived in Jerusalem about the same time and was received by the Amirs. There is, however, the strongest reason to believe that the latter had no previous knowledge of his movements and that the meeting was in no way prearranged. The intensification of the measures to make the exclusion orders effective renders it unlikely that Tahir-ad-Dabbagh and his associates wall secure further access to the Amirs. 3. The Beni A tiya. It was realised at the outset of the Ibn Rifada affair that special precautions were necessary to prevent this tribe from becoming involved. Although one party of them did get across the frontier, it was due to the strenuous action of Captain Glubb, the details of which I have related to you in confidential conversation, that many more did not follow. You are aware of the eventual action taken in regard to the Beni Atiya after it had been ascertained that your Government had no objection to their peaceful return to Saudi Arabia. Their grazing necessities make it impossible to confine them permanently to one or other side of the frontiei, but the measures taken in November last were intended quite definitely as a warning that they must not abuse their position when in Transjordan. Apart from the action taken in regard to the non-settled portion of the tribe as a whole, special measures were taken to deal with certain prominent members of it. On the 23rd August last four of the leaders concerned in the crossing o the frontier were sentenced by the Bedouin Control Board to a year’s imprison ment each. Twu of these evaded capture, but two others, namely, Muhammad-bm Farhan and Muhammad-bin-Rashid, were arrested in November and are nov serving their terms of imprisonment. Two other chiefs, Sheikh Selim Abu DumeyK and Sheikh Karayim-bin-Atiya, were considered to be possible sources of danger.' and it was decided to remove them to Palestine as a measure of precau ion. Karayim had not been located wdien I last heard, but Selim Abu Dumeyk has been sent to live at Beersheba until further notice. 4 proTtf ijeier ktffeesigidliVnj 'iS wove ?&amp;•' tie names ii H ie Amiil Government and their t^e e “d Se provinee.

BRITISH LEGATION, JEDDA. lOth April 1933 0 Sir, With reference to my telegram of April 8, No. 63, I have the honour to state that the documents relative to the mutual recognition of each other Ly King Abdul Aziz Ibn Sa’ud and the Amir ’Abdullah were published in the form of an official communique in the ,, Umm-al-Qura n of April, 7th. The documents were the note addressed to the High Commissioner by the Chief Minister of Transjordan, the corresponding note addressed to me by the Amir Peysal and the telegrams exchanged between the two rulers. Only the first of these was given a date, but the omission of dates if frequent in Sa’udi publica tions. The text of the Sa’udi note is correctly reproduced except for the accidental omission of one honorific expression pertaining to Ibn Sa’ud himself. The text of the Transjordan note was completed by the insertion, in accordance with my request, of the word for 'Government H , which had been accidentally omitted in the original. One word which figured in the draft does not appear in the published text of the Amir ’Abdullah’s telegram and a grammatical change consisting of the substitution of one preposition for another occurs in that ot the King’s telegram. These divergences are so unimportant that I need not trouble you with the text of the communique. It is published without editorial comment. 2. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Transjordan at Jerusalem. I have, etc., (Signed) Andrew Ryan. he Elght Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I*&gt; K.C.V.O etc. , etc. , etc.n PARAPHRASE TELEORAM from the Acting }ligh Coirdfsaioner for the Trans Jordan to the Secretary of Plate foriSfoe Colonies. Dated 17th May, 1933. Rereived in the Colonial Office at 3.19 p.m. on 17th May, 1933. Reference my telegraia No.63. The necessity for Anglo-Saudi exchange of notes in connection with signature of treaty has been explained to the Amir by the British Resident and he warned him that it may be necessary to agree to their publication with it. Amir reaffirmed his desire to be on friendly terns with Ibn Saud and stated that he was not ashamed to rule Trans Jordan in friendly understanding with His Majesty's Government. While he did not actually express himself strongly in regard to the matter Cox derived impression that he lelt decidedly opposed to publication of notes. Cox considers therefore and I agree that if possible a course distasteful to the Amir should be avoided. It certainly would be less likely to leave a cause roi ill teeling if Saudi Government would agree that notes should not be published.

This will encourage Saudi government to come to reasonable understanding on outstanding matters especially as I believe Ibn Saud to be still desirous of early final settlement and Fuad wants to meet his wife in Syria about the end of July.

They agreed to it in the afternoon under instructions from the King but when I suggested that this might make it still possible to sign complete instrument be fore departure of Mission Fuad countered with reference to difficulties of preparing Anglo -Saudi exchange of notes in- time . In conversation on last named question on May 3rd I had told Fuad that text of notes would require your approval especially/ if they were to be published, a point on which I did not know your views.

Most important obstacles on our side are as follows:- 1, Article 7 of Treaty of Friendship. We can almost certainly agree on original draft plus, paragraph substance of which is given in immediately following telegram. Cox considers this acceptable and feasible from point of view of Transjordan lav/ which admits naturalization at short notice by authorization of chief minister.

Saudi delegates are most insistent on replacing Article 7 hy an article prohibiting party from future enlistment of subjects of other party in his regular or irregular forces without consent of such other party. We had objected strongly to this proposal. It completely changes the character of article and it might be fruitful source of future accusations by baudi Govern ment. Moreover although Transjordan has no irregular forces it is useful to have e.g. certain Beni Atiya in Arab legion.

Please see Mr. Morley's minute at P.Z.2002/33. The first stage of the treaty negotiations opened at Jedda on 23rd April and the progress of the negotiations is described in Jedda telegrams Nos. 75, 76 and 77 (P.Z.2385 and 2401/33). Discussion is proceeding on the basis oi the craft treaties in the form approved by His Majesty's Government with minor alterations agreed between the British Resident, Transjordan and H.M.Minister, Jedda. The preliminary drafts forwarded by the High Commissioner will be found at P.Z.1400/33 and 'the observations of His Majesty's Government were contained in the Colonial Office telegram to the High Commissioner for Transjordan of Hoc April at P.Z. 2124/33. Considerable difficulty is be ing/being experienced in connexion with the definition of extraditable offences in the extradition treaty, on which point it is natural that the Transjordan and Saudi delegates should hold very different views. The British Resident discussed with the Arnir the proposal that there should be a meeting between the two rulers and Abdullah is preparedto meet Ibn Saud, but the High Commissioner agrees with Sir Andrew Ryan that the proposal cannot usefully be pursued at present beyond an understanding that it may be reopened later if circumstances seem propitious. Sir Arthur Wauchope also considers it essential that the meeting should be held on neutral ground preferably on board one of H.M.'s ships. The alternatives of Koweit or ’Iraq suggested by the Amir seem unsuitable if only because Ibn Saud would probably never agree (P.Z.3227/33 - see also 1473/33). With regard to the general question of the policy of His Majesty’s Government in Arabia and the steps to be taken (1) for restricting anti-Saudi intrigue and (2) generally for promoting better relations between Transjordan and Saudi-Arabia, a reference is invited to the submission on P.Z.533/33. Tne Colonial Office despatch to Jerusalem of 1st February, which 7/as amended as suggested by this Office, is at P.Z.674/33. After alluding to the steps already taken the High Commissioner in his reply (P.Z. 2082/33) emphasises his view with which the Colonial Office agree t^at ' ur ther restrictions on the powers, activities and friends of Abdullah would be injurious to imperial interests turl. %1 ' SEEN i^JLiTICAL COM! &lt;9, f 5 35 /-33 -14;—6130 8l8l« (2) In any further communication on this subject, please quote No- £ and address —not to any -pers/n by name{\mt to— g ^ •The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1 /zlOl THE Under-Secretary of S«e fo^ Foreig compliments to 1 Affairs presents his '^7 / and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop *■-*' of the under-mentioned paper. £» Foreign Office, c,7 Reference to previous correspondence : Description of Enclosure. ^ eT Name and Date.

I presume we may use considerable latitude in accepting alteration and amplification in draft provided we give nothing important away. It is in my opinion desirable to relegate Hadda agreement to the background as far as possible by making new treaties as much more precise as can be done without over elaborating details. As regards tribunal under Article 6 of Hadda I should like if possible to get away from them altogether and to rely on arbitration in the last resort on questions which cannot be settled between frontier officers or by diplomatic ^ means. May we aim at this? On further study I consider Articles 2 to 4 of our draft arbitration protocol to be unworkable. May we attempt (a) to establish ordered sequence of proceedings leading up to arbitra tion and (b) to get Saudi Government to agree to nominations of President by third Power if parties fail to agree wltlun c -i nf pxohanee of views to his selection by month of completion of exchange u± mutual agreement. ^ . . . nn seenis to me essential but choice of third Latter provision seems u; party ray be ®I« it should be His Majesty's Government. /mat are jour ^ • Cox agrees with above views.) 9 (J o My general impression is that although his delegate vail he difficult Itn Sand wants treaties to he made and may sacrifice something to secure completion of negotiation before Mission leaves* It is therefore important that we should have guidance on important points as they arise with least possible delay.

I appreciate the objections o£ Hi a kajaatj’a Minister, Jeddah, against Jerusalem, and X am of the opinion that a meeting afloat in th© 5 3 &amp;ight Honourable Sir I'hilip Cunliffe-Uster, J.a. ,eto., etc., Us Majesty’s irincipal Secretary of otute for the Colonies.the Quit of Aqaba, where both the Amir a Mullah and £iag Ibn Saud would be the guest® of His Majesty’s CrQverft&amp;eat. would provide the best solution, in spite of the difficulty of arranging acGommodation to which Sir Andrew %an refers in his telegram Mo. 37 to the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs. 4. ?he British Hesident has diaoussed the proposal with the A air Abdullah who said that although it would be painful to hlta to meet King I bn Saud he was prepared to do so in order to demonstrate to Bis Majesty ? a Oovsrnaent that he was not less willing that King I bn 3aud to establish peaceful relations: he would, however, meet him only on the clear understanding that he and King I bn Baud were treated with equal honour. the Amir also considers that the most suitable place for the meeting would be on board on® of H.M.

Tour despatch Secret A of 25th Februaiy. Your telegram No.42 of 7th April, Draft treaties with Saudi-Arabia. His Majesty's Government have following observations on draft treaties:- Treaty-ji L£mmiaki£ - Article 2.. Though in practice subjects of Saudi- uabia who were in difficulties in Trans Jordan would no doubt apply for assistance to British officials, tms does not mean that all Consular duties such for instance as issue of passports would be undertaken oy T.ans ca authorities ou behalf of Government of Saudi-Araoia. This being so following re-draft is suggested:- -Save as otherwise specifically provided m this treaty or ar, other treaty governing relations between Trans Jordan and Saudi-Arabia, the hx^ contracting parties shall for the time recourse to the good oftioes o t , 4. ha Government of &gt;,he their respective comtries of t ■ , far the conduct of matters ox mutual Uni ted Kingdom fo„ concern.” 4s tween high . it is suggested tnat JapUfil&amp;Jsi*. ( shoul(ibe omi tted and words contracting parti and S audi-Arabia 'governing ^ inserted. This wor ^ H is Majesty's Hadda cement was between ^Ib ^ Government not between Ibnbau kr ^c.^rj-Acle. IS,*. Text leaves it doubtful what would be position if at end of three years one of parties was to give notice of desire to revise treaty and no agreement was reached* Following normal form of article would be preferable:- 'Present treaty shall be ratified and ratifications shall be exchanged at as soon as possible. It shall come into force immediately on exchange of ratifications and shall b© binding diu-ing period of three years from date of its coming into force. In case heither of high contracting parties shall have given notice to the other six months £ cue the said period of three years of its intention to terminate the treaty it shall remain in force until expiration of six months from the date at which notice of such intention is given.’’ Same observations apply as to Article 15 of Treaty of Friendship. Also as Trans Jordan Extradition Ordinance will presumably only become operative in respect of Saudi-Arabia on issue of proclamation to^ effect it will be necessary to ensure that proclam- ._o is issued on date of ratification of treaty. Alternatively, if -re convenient, it might be arranger that Extradition Treaty shall come mto roxcc . n -.pj-p-p (l&amp;t6 of 8XCh6.Bg© 0 lapse of given period after date ratifications. ^ 10 His Uajaaty's Oovsi»»»t oo»c». , .srassaph 3 of jo™ tta ‘ proposal »de V ^ lhe all0 oatio» of trita. agreed arrangemen 3 tes to annexed might be embodied m tion to an attempt % A-tr And thev 110 obj^ to the trea y ^ adop tion of an arrangement being made to secure iha the rtihosad in that paragraph i seUleme nt the proposedsettlement of incidents involving members of the Beni Atiya and Sharaxat tribes. While realising that such an arrangement is not in strict accordance with the usual principles for the determination of nationality and that in so far^as it makes residence a criterion of nationality it may be incompatihlt with the nationality laws of the two countries His majesty's Government are prepared to concur in it as a measure devised to meet special local conditions. .on As regards the suggestion that the Extraditi Treaty should provide that air 7 application for extradition will be dealt with in accordance with the laws in force in the territory whence extradition is sought, it would appear that since, so far as is known, there is no law in force in Saudi-Arabia similar to tne Extradition Ordinance in Trans Jordan the provision proposed would have no well-defined meaning as applied to Saudi-Arabia. Advantage might well be taken of such a provision by the Saudi Government to refuse any unwelcome demand for extradition. It seems that the point which it is desired to cover is the right to refuse extradition if the evidence is not considered sufficient. If there be no other reason for the proposal it might be better to embody in the dratt treaty provision to this precise effect rather than to insert the more general provision which you propose. 1 authorise you, after making such alterations in the draft treaties as may appear desirable in the light of the above comments to communicate them .o e Trans Jordan Government. You will ho doibt make Jt i. u, a TVans Jordan Government that .Jie quite clear to the ^.ns J ora , m orelv a basis for the coming draft Agreements are mere ynegotiatiaaa and if circuBDtanees permt it \sould seem 'best that consultation with Trans Jordan Government should be informal so that we shall not be unduly tied later on by appearance of preliminary commitment to Trans Jordan Government. As regards formal aarthorination for Kesidait, as he will not be signing treaties he will not need full powers. Trans Jordan Government delegate drould however take with him to Jedia full powers from Mir in order to be ready to sign if agreement di ould be reached there.2036 l In any furtlier communication on tliis subject, please quote 1 'v ** £/ 7 '//&amp; 3 / 2 jr \ P.Z. ^8 not to any person by nam/, but to 3 and address —not to any person by nam/, but to 0 The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. l THE Under-Secretary of State f &gt;™ry oi state fefo^gn Affairs presents his ft. ^ complunents to (J fa i and, by dhection of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop u4 0 f the under-mentioned paper.

THE UNDE3 SEC3I2T INDIA OFFICE.[:’,W aa. :8C l No. r j/13/ 33 High Oomiuirsioaer for Trane-Jordan, Jerusalem. 17th March,1933. Sir, 1 have tha honour to acitnov/ledge the receipt of ^our Secret despatch of the 1st February,1933, on the subject of the policy which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom are pursuing in regard to Arabian affairs, with special reference to Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Trans-Jordan. 2. After carefully reviewing the position in the light of the considerations sat forth in your despatch and of all the infora&amp;tion available, I have reached the following conclusions on the question asked by j?ou, namely ''hether any furthor stops can be t^ken: (l) for restricting anti-Saudi intrigue, and, in so far as it any be impossible to prevent it, at least for neutralising its effect; and {2) generally for promoting the establishment of better relations between Trans-Jordan and Ssudi-lrab 3 m the first place, it cannot be too strongly aaphasizod that, since 1 spoke to the Amir Abdullah last ' ., rOTail9d upon him to say that he would roco.au*. summer and prevail th&lt;* . h v\ ar of loudi / rnbia, there hat- n. * Ibn Baud as the King oi ^ slightest evidence to show that oi'^u have intrigued against Ibn Baud . light Honourable T , rt . r Philip 3unliffO'^ ieter » u D , , * p v*4 nf* 11-cil Secretary His Isjcity’s Principe ^ ,etc etc •» of State for the Colonies.I need not boro recount the measures which hrve already been taken to restrict tho activities of the principal agents in tho promotion of the raid of Ibn Hi fads into the liejaa. fhe Amir’s Chamberlain Hamid Pasha el Tadi, has now left fra ns-Jordan for good. The Amir Hhaker has been formally warned that ho must take no part in intrigues against tha Saudi Government, and he has underta an that he will not do so. 5, lou are also aware that a Bill has been arafted ana will be laid before the Legislative Council in the near future, which provides that exclusive Jurisdiction to deal with raiding cases where a foreign country is concerned shall be in the hands of the Officer Ooaocnding Arab Legion or an officer appointed by him. ?hie measure Wl11 have the effect of reducing the Aair's control over the tribes, and thereby it is hoped, of preventing the use of the tribes as weapons to annoy nnu irritate .bn »&gt;aud. 6. Turning frao the negative measures designed to limit l • u 4 -hfi inclination of Abdullah the bounds within which the natural • „+ ra,, ctmid can be exercised, to the to intrigue against Ibn oauu c. n ».,«» 6 :°; “ ”' d 't‘L; &gt;w Abdullah has already proaisea to roo,n. , Arrn f intioas now in v,ram a.uai-jr.i.i. m . mM! &gt;ocuri „, «&gt;• a ; h „ lta s»ud. ■ «»•» negotiations are prc.mraary , rn *vtradition frosty* of friMidship- — aflis9 0M iaportant , I desire, however, oopect 7.aspect of tho situation* Since it remains tfao considered polioj of His Majesty's Govomaont in Arabian affairs to support the Hashiaites in Trans-Jordan, (a policy in which 1 concur' aiaong other places, and since there is no obvious alternative to them, and,as renards Trans-Jordan, no suitable alternative to Abdullah, it seeas to iae expedient to consider whether the point has not been reached when any p further restrictions on the powers, the activities and the friends o f Abdullah will be injurious to imperial interests. There appears to be a real danger of reducing the Auir to a condition in which, having little to lose, ana nothing to hope for from His iinjesty’s Gavornnent, he may beteraptod to abandon responsible courses ana to start intrigues detrimental to the interests of stable government in Trans-Jordan. There is no lack of inflammable material in Palestine and of disaffected malcontents on both sides of the Jordan ready at any time to start a conflagration, la Abdullah’s favour it should bo remembered that hr- has always loyally supported His Majesty's Government's policy in Palestine and opposed the Istiqlal party, o I think that once the situation of Trans- Jordan m relation to Gaudi-Arabis has been satisfactorily settled by the measures already tal en and m hand, it shew constant policy of His Majesty’s Government &lt;=o show true in Abdullah by giving him a free hand over small &lt;ufa-.. whilst retaining control over niportrnt otters. , a m :_ or imi rovements of administrative ; 9 .

It will be roueiabered that Ibn Rifada and others were given Trons-Joraan paw sports at the dictation of the Amir, at a moment's notice. ihe air Oificer Com sanding has suggested that the Amir should not Bllow passports to ho issued without opportunity ^oing ^i•/en to tho suthorities to ascertain the antecedents of the persons concerned, and if necessary to allow time for the matter to be referred to me. I am considering what f tops, if any, are necessary to give effect to this suggestion. 10. As regarus improvements in the machinery for communicating intelligence, the Air Officer Commanding considers that, if close liaison had existed between the British Resident, the Officer Oomi»anding,Arab Legion, end the Royal Air Force Intelligence Service it is probable that the Ibn Rifada revolt and oany of the raids by Trans-Jordan tribes, which took place between 19J0 and 1932 night have been xaore speedily checked. It is also his opinion that the British Resident should have warned -he Royal Air Force Intelligence Branch when he first heard of the possibility of the Ibn Rifada incursion from the Chief Minister of the Trans-Jordnn Government on the 12th April,1932,so that all sources of information could hove been directed to discovering the truth, and so that plene might hove been proved to prevent the passage o f rebels through Trans-Jordan territory. i - fh n Air Officer Commanding considers 11. In conclusion, the Air .. • i t -i/ion 4 - nhowod himself to be more that if the British Residen. »&amp;owoa “ sympathetic t •• i ■sympathetic towaras the Special Ser 7 ice Officers, and attached more weight to the inWtion given by'them, the service of Intelligence in Trans-Jordan would bo greatly strengthened. 12 . I attach great weight to the advice and criticism of the Air Officer domuaading especially in matters of intelligence relative to Trans-Jordan, and I take this opportunity of saying that I constantly receive valuable information from the Inteli^eaco officers of the Boyal Air Force, and that, on several occasions, their work has been of great value to this Government. At the same time, I am hound to observe on the Air Officer Qomoanding*s opinions, as recorded in paragraphs It and 11 above, that he does not fully appreciate all the difficulties of the position of the British Resident. I consider that in the past some of his criticisms have been deserved, but 1 believe the British Resident now recognises the value of the information supplied by special service officers as I have on more than one occasion pointed out to him that as High Gomisrioner I have received valuable information through the Air Officer Commanding more quifekly than from ray other source. But I an hopeful that raore haraonious co-operation will take place in the future than has been evident in the past. 13. The Air Officer Commanding has also made the following suggestion# for the promotion of good relations between Trans-Jordan and 3 audi-Arabia: ( a ) that more from on t meetings shoulu take place between Captain fflubb and I bn -eid. and possibly meetings between the former and the frontier 1go vor no r&amp; in 3 audi-territory• I wldak this a useful suggestion anu it should be adopted if Ills ilajest^s GovornL.oat can make the necessary arrangements; (b) that the dauda frontier should be detiarcated, since, although no serious quarrels have arisen concerning the frontier, it is possible that they usy do so in the future* I a© douotful about the wisdom of this suggestion, but if it is considered expedient by His Majesty’s Government, it might perhaps be considered in connection with the negotiations for a Treaty of Friendship; — | /^p rohibiting meetings between Trans- \fL-y ( afvI'Oji V iembers of the Hisb el Hejasi should be Rev.

Previous Papers .* FOR INFORMATION. This file was last submitted at P.Z.53^/33. Mutual recognition between Ion Saud and Abdullah has at last been effected, wita elaborate precautions to secure exact synchronization. It is hoped to begin negotiations for a M-lateral treaty of friendship and bon ■oisinage, together with a protocol of irbitration and an extradition treaty, about the aid of the month. The preliminary drafts of ;hese, which closely follow those concluded between the Saud and Iraq in 1931. will be round at P.Z.1400. Ibn Saud has now agreed. . ft er a little reluctance, that the negotiation, should be in two stages, first at Jedda and later 4475b 1000 5.30f'' I I I ‘II Ir V later at Jerusalem. Puad’s recent reversion (P.X1930) to if • . the possibility of a trilateral treaty was disturbing, but Sir A. Ryan seems to have headed him off. The main difficulty in the negotiations is likely to arise over the question of divisions of the wandering frontier tribes. There is some talk of a purely personal and complimentary meeting between the two Rulers, somewhat on the lines of the 'Lupin” meeting between Ibn Baud and Reisal. (?.z.,.lb41 and 1478). It is unlikely to take j place cefore tne conclusion of the negotiations - perhaps : in one autumn - and the venue may possibly be a spot on I the frontier. Little or nothing has been heard from the Saudis I ao0ut lntri eues in Transjordan now that the Mr affair | has blown over. The Amir Shakir, has got off with a warning from Col.
