I am to state that the intention of this Office, as previously notified to the General Officer Commanding, Mauritius, is that these accounts should' be transferred to the Field Controller of Military Accounts, Poona, and the General Officer Commanding has reported that last pay certificates were forwarded to Basra on the 27th July. This Office became aware recently that the Egyptian Labour Corps has remained in Egypt payment, but this was arranged locally without the foreknowledge of this Office, and is contrary to the accepted principle that the accounts of the Mesopotamian force shall be kept by the Indian authorities.4 I am to request that instructions may be telegraphed to India that the transfer of the accounts of the Mauritius Labour Battalion to India shall be accepted ; and that this Office may be informed of the action taken.

War Office, t , , Oth. April 1917. am comm anded by the Army Council to say, for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, that they have had under consideration the question of their responsibility for financial control in regard to the operations m Mesopotamia. t Secretary of State for India is aware, the War Council decided in &lt;&lt; • rj- aS re ^ l arcs tle operations in Mesopotamia “ the Commander- &lt;&lt; l! 1 ' a 6 *’ p, ia ’ w !^ receive his instructions from, and be responsible to « the Army Council in regard to all matters of personnel, administration &lt;t and RU PPW of the f o rc es m question ; and, further, that he will be assisted hy such officers as the Army Council may deem it desirable to appoint.” 1 he Public Accounts Committee, with the approval of the House of Commons, has laid down that important forces in the field should be accompanied by a representative of the Accounting Officer for Army Funds, as 1 mancial Adviser to the Commander, and as expenditure in Mesopotamia is controlled by the Army Council and charged against Army Funds, the question of appointing a Financial Adviser there arises, within the sense intended by Parliament. Ihe case of the Expeditionary Force in Mesopotamia is not, however, on all fours with the case of Expeditionary Forces elsewhere ; the force in Mesopotamia is administered under Indian Begulations, the accounts are rendered to the Government of India for audit/and there is with the force a semoi officer of the Indian Military Accounts Department already discharging very similar functions to those discharged by a. Financial Adviser under22436—12 C mpenal Regulations. It is therefore suggested that to avoid duplication of personnel and to give this Department the benefit of the Indian experience of the present financial Adviser and his staff, the requirements of the situation would best be met by placing that official in direct communication with the Accounting Officer at the War Office, and I am to enquire whether the faecietaij of State for India is willing to approve of this arrangement. . som e extent the details would have to be subject to the guidance of experience but they could be defined forthwith in a provisional way by semi-omcial communication between the departments. rm T r r ri _ • -T am, &amp;c., Ihe under Secretary of State ' ]&gt; g Ctbitt for India. 82 (2).

Colonel Sheppard should communicate direct with Assistant Financial Societaly, A\ ai Office, on financial matters in. connection with Mesopotamia field Force. Ibis is necessary to safeguard statutory Parliamentary control over Army expenditure. Broadly, Sheppard would remain responsible to you for audit under Indian regulations and for Indian departmental duties, but would report periodically to Assistant Financial Secretary, War Office, on such matters as economy in field expenditure, e.g., on civil labour, compensation, and local contracts and purchases, financial concurrence in writing-off losses, accounting control over consumption of supplies and stores, financial consideration of scales of supplies, adjustment of claims for permanent services such as railway capital charges, economical utilisation of waste products, sales of stores, &amp;c. The general intention is that he should watch such subjects from a financial standpoint and keep Assistant Financial Secretary, War Office, fully informed.

Telegram from Viceroy, Army Department, dated 20th June 1917. 9122 lour telegram dated 3rd May, 889. Financial control in regard o opeiations in Mesopotamia. We have for some time past been anxious about economic and financial situation in Mesopotamia, because although cost of operations except normal charges of troops sent from India is ultimately debitable to Ills Majesty’s Government, we have to find in the rst instance money, men, and materials, and constantly increasing demands made on our resources, and we cannot help feeling that the drain is not wholly foi purposes essential to the war, but includes projects that are really a mattei of later peace development. We therefore welcome your proposal to impose a further check on expenditure, and are quite prepared to give Colonel Harrison who has recently succeeded Colonel Sheppard as Financial ^ 1 ' 1 ie ( ’ the fim 1 ctlons P r °posed by Army Council subject to conditions stated by you, namely, that copies of all correspondence between whih 011 R 1U AV ar °n Ce sh ? lllc ] be furtlished t0 With regard to question w ether Han ison will require further assistance we shall have to refer to nm, but we shall be prepared to furnish any additional assistance required.

A. Harrison) should be allowed to communicate direct with the Assistant Financial Secretary of the War Office on the understanding that they shall be furnished with copies of all such correspondence. The Government of India make the further suggestion that an officer of high status and technical engineering qualifications should be associated -with their Financial Adviser for the purposes mentioned in their telegram. Mr. Chamberlain would be glad to know whether this suggestion commends itself to the Army Council. As an alternative, if the appointment of a special officer is not thought desirable, it might be possible to arrange that the Chief Engineer at General Headquarters should undertake the duties specified with the assistance of an additional Staff Officer, Royal Engineers. Mr. Chamberlain is strongly impressed by information which has reached him from India as to the rapid growth of expenditure in connection with the Mesopotamia Force, with the necessity for a close scrutiny of that portion of the expenditure which has no real bearing on the conduct of the war or the comfort and efficiency of the force. He fully recognises that this is a matter for the Army Council which is responsible to Parliament for military operations in Mesopotamia, and he is not certain that the particular proposal made by the Government of India for giving the Financial Adviser technical assistance is the best way of bringing expenditure under examination. But he thinks it right to draw attention to a question which appears to him of some importance. I have, &amp;c., The Secretary, War Office. J. fl. Seabrooke, 82 82 ( 8 ).

Please see in this connection paragraphs 5 to 8 of our Despatch No. 129, dated the 26thMay 1916 printed at 0f File No - 12 of Yolulne ]lr of Office prints 1 issued m May 1917. lire arrangements proposed in that Despatch, with the amend ment suggested m our Despatch No. 290 dated the 25th November 1916 ( P a f e ^ ol 7 were approved m the Secretary of State’s telegram of fwth b ebruary 191/ (page 21 of ibid), subject to a modification on a point of detail. 1 a. Die pimciples aa Inch ve have constantly followed in determinino - the incidence of expenditure which may benefit both the military operations in Mesopotamia and the administration of the occupied territory mav be briefly stated as follows :— - ' • * \ 1 ) D the immediate necessity for the measure on which the expenditure is mcuired aiises piimarily from military considerations, we have held that the expenditure should in its entirety be charged in the accounts of* the military force, though the measure may also benefit the local administration, either immediately or ultimately. (“) If? othei hand, the immediate necessity for the measure arises primarily from considerations connected with the administra tion of the occupied territory, we have held that the expenditure should m its entnety be charged to the revenues of the occupied territory, even though it may help materially the military operations, directly or indirectly. 4. This arrangement is, in our opinion, also satisfactory from the point of view of general financial control. It does away with any possibility of divided responsibility in respect of expenditure which might otherwise be considered as chargeable partly to the military operations and partly to the revenues of the occupied territory. About the beginning of the current financial year we definitely laid down that, all expenditure falling under (I) above should be controlled by the General Officer Commanding through the Financial Adviser of the Mesopotamia Force, while all expenditure falling under ( 2 ) should be controlled by the General Officer Commanding, through the Civil Commissioner and the latter’s Financial Assistant, and should be subject to the powers recently delegated to them in respect of expenditure debitable to the revenues of the occupied territory. 5. It was in accordance with these principles that— (a) We recommended in our Army Department Despatch No. 93, dated the 10th November 1916, that the entire expenditure connected with the Zobeir Bund should be charged in the accounts of the Expeditionary Force. (b) We are debiting to the revenues of the occupied territory, with reference to our Despatches of 26th May 1916 and 25th November 1916 cited above, all charges of political officers employed in Mesopotamia ; the charges of additional officers employed to meet the requirements of the Mesopotamia Force, at places within the theatre of operations but outside the occupied territory, e.g., at Shustar and other places in South-West Persia, being alone debited in the accounts of the Force ; though it is possible to argue that a material portion of the expenditure of the political officers in Mesopotamia, particularly the Secret Service expen diture, is helping the military operations. 6 6 . The specific cases referred to in the telegram from the General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia, dated the 15th November 1917, and mentioned in the letter from the Financial Adviser, Mesopotamia Force, to the address of the Assistant Financial Secretaiy, War Office, No. 3213, dated the 4th December 1917, were also disposed of by us in accordance with the principles mentioned above. In submitting proposals for the division between Civil and Military funds of expenditure on the repairing of the bank of the Sakh- lawiyeh canal, the improvements in Baghdad West, and the military works carried out in the Nasiriyeh district up to the 10th April 1917, the Civil 22436-12 ECommissioner definitely informed ns that the works had been undertaken at the instance of the military authorities, and either entirely (in the case of the Nasiriyeh works) or primarily (in the case of the other works) for military reasons. We accordingly decided that the expendituie was chargeable wholly in the accounts of the military force. As already stated, the principles which guided us were placed before His Majesty’s Government, and were accepted by them ; and so long as they hold, we are unable to modify our decisions in any of the three cases with reference to the considerations mentioned in the letter of the 4th December 1917 from the Financial Adviser, Mesopotamia Force. 7 . We would strongly urge that you should impress on ^ the War Office the undesirability of makingany change in the existing principles. It makes no difference to Indian revenues whether the expenditure is charged to Civil or Military funds ; and any distribution of the expenditure will be in the nature of a transfer from one Department of His Majesty’s Government to another. The same principles have in practice governed the incidence of all important schemes of railway construction, port works, river conservancy and road construction which have been undertaken in Mesopotamia in the last two or three years. There cannot be any doubt that these schemes will immensely benefit the occupied territory and its civil population after the war is over ; and as a matter of fact these benefits are already being realised tp some extent. But the entire expenditure connected with these big- schemes is being charged to military funds, as their immediate inception has been dictated by military needs. If in the case of these schemes the whole of the expenditure is to be charged to military funds, we see no advantage, or gain of accuracy in accounts, by attempting, on scanty data, to allocate between Military and Civil funds relatively petty expenditure on minor works -whose immediate inception is aiso dictated by military needs, though, as in the case of the more important schemes, they may prove to be of eventual value to the administration of the occupied territory. In our opinion, the sole criterion for determining the incidence of the expenditure should continue to be whether the primary and immediate need for incurring it has arisen from military considerations ; and we would deprecate the tendency of the local authorities in Mesopotamia to waste their time, as well as that of hard-worked officials in England and India, in attempting to allocate the expenditure on these minor projects, on more or less arbitrary data. S. If the views expressed in the preceding paragraph are accepted by the Aar Office, we shall on hearing from you inform the General Officer Commanding in Mesopotamia that the local authorities should in future refrain from attempting to allocate expenditure, the incidence of which will continue to be determined by us with reference to the principles mentioned above. Should the War Office so desire, we shall also instruct the Financial Adviser, Mesopotamia horce, to submit to them quarterly statements of expenditure, a portion of which should, in his opinion, eventually he recovered from the revenues of the occupied territory. The War Office can then make any necessary readjustments with His Majesty’s Treasury: though we are doubtful, in view of the considerations stated in the preceding- paragraph, whether these readjustments will be of any practical value. 9. Pending further instructions from you, we shall dispose, in accordance with the accepted principles mentioned above, of all proposals which may be submitted to us for the allocation of expenditure in Mesopotamia between Civil and Military funds.

Allocation of expenditure in Mesopotamia between Civil and Military bunds. Following communications received from General Officer Com- manding, force D : “In continuation of correspondence ending with Army Department s letter No. 18260, dated 10th December last, I have the honour to submit for consideration of Government following proposals regai dmg incidence of expenditure between Military estimates and the revenues of the occupied territories. “ -• rhe decision conveyed in Foreign Department letter No. 2479/Est./B. dated 30th October 1916, implied in effect that each case should be dealt with on its merits. “ TJie rulings of the Government of India on the several cases submitted to them, however, appear to have been based on principle that expenditure occasioned by military requirements should in general be debited against military estimates in full. 1 . I he adoption of this principle wdl obviate the necessity of discussing the hypothetical advantage to be derived by the civil revenues from a few particular military works out of many that are now being constructed at the expense of Imperial Government to the great advantage of these territories and to the benefit of civil revenues generally : for example, irrigation works, roads, and embankments. 5- The financial adjustments at the end of the war between Iris Britannic Majestr s Government and the Ottoman Government presumably will be based on account of occupied territories as finally compiled in each for the financial yeai. 1 lie amount of capital expenditure on woiFs of a Civil nature charged finally against Military expenditure could, of course, be taken into account in the post-war discussions, but it is questionable whether such ■detailed re-examination would be possible in practice, and I consider it very desirable that the necessary debits should be made as far as the available surplus allows in each year’s civil accounts. “ 9. For this reason, and to avoid the necessity of numerous detailed adjust ments, I suggest that with concurrence of civil Commissioner, that the surplus revenues of the occupied territories should be credited annually to Imperial Government in relief of Military estimates. For irrigation I select this department, as the works under its control are primarily of a civil nature, are of permanent value, and result directly in increased revenue receipts. The preliminary estimate of this department alone for the year ending 1918-19 amounted to Rs. 80,00,000, very approximately. ’ ’ 7. Views expressed in paragraph 4 communications are practically identical with those expressed in Fell’s letter to Robinson of 6 th March 1918. 8 . As regards Commanding has papers, that entire surplus revenues are credited by us to His Majesty’s Government. Apparently under international law the whole of such surplus revenues may be see no reason to 6 th March 1918, munications. Nor do I think it necessary for me to make any adjustments concluding portion of communications, General Officer probably not realised, although he has got complete16 on the lines indicated in paragraph 6 of’ General Officer Commanding’s communications between the war accounts and the accounts of occupied territory as compiled by our Controller of War Accounts. The portion of the surplus revenues to be appropriated towards meeting the expenditure charged to the War Office in the accounts of Expeditionary Forces is essentially one for settlement between latter and His Majesty’s Treasury. 104.

With reference to Mr. Cubitt’s letter of 27th November last No. 121/3/767 (F. 1 a), I am directed to transmit, for the information of the Army Council, a copy of a letter dated 6 th March from the Financial Adviser of the Military Finance Department of the Government of India, explaining the principles followed by that Government in the allocation of expenditure in Mesopotamia between Military and Civil funds. A copy of a telegram dated 20 th April from the Government of India, reciting a communication from the General Officer Commanding on the subject and furnishing their own views, is also enclosed. In the opinion of the Secretary of State for India the procedure explained by_ Mr. Fell is appropriate and convenient, and it is hoped the Army Council will concur in its continuance. It would appear, moreover, that the General Officer Commanding, when making his representations on the subject of the allocation of the expenditure, was not aware of the arrangements made by the Government of India and reported in their letter of 26th May 1916, No. 129 (4 ol. 3 of War Prints issued by this Department File 12, pages 13-16).

A copy of the letter conveying the suggestion and of the reply are enclosed. The arrangements made had forestalled the suggestion made. No further communications have taken place with the Expeditionary Force Canteens, and no further reports have been received from the Field Controller, Basra, of canteen receipts and expenditure.

It is observed that latterly the reports show that “Payments ” in India exceed “Receipts” at Basra with more frequency than in the past, thus tending to^ throw a loss on public funds through the reserve of 10,0000 being considerably overdrawn from time to time. If, as seems probable, the necessity for economy of shipping tonnage causes the purchases in India to continue to be high or even to increase, it would seem advisable to reconsider the present system of disposal of Mesopotamia canteen funds as between Expeditionary Force Canteens and the Field Controller at Basra. At the outset of the present arrangement in June 1917, it was understood that the canteens might shortly be undertaking the disposal of its funds at Basra, and necessary remittances to India through ordinary commercial banking channels and handing to the Field Controller at Basra only such net sums as were actually free for remittance to England. If this method could now be adapted it would obviate some difficulties which now arise, and I am to ask whether it would be possible from the Expeditionary Force Canteens point of view. T.

I am to inquire whether the period of the account in which the entry or entries will appear could be reported. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State W. Mayne, for India.

I have, Ac., The Field Controller of Military Accounts, Frank Lucas, Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force. Financial Secretary. 114. War Office to India Office. 0162/231 (F. 1.). War Office, Sir, 20th August 1918. I am commanded by the Army Council to enclose for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, copies of telegrams which have been received from the General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia, and the Commander-in-Chief India, regarding the accounting arrangements for General Dunsterville’s force in Persia. 2 . The Council agree that the arrangements which were made for General Dunsterville’s “ Mission ” are no longer suitable, now that he commands a force which is under the orders of the General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia. They see no reason, however, why any part of the expenditure on this force should continue to be accounted for direct to this Office, and they propose that, as from as early a date as possible, the accounts shall be transferred to the Indian Accounting Officers and shall be dealt with on the same lines as those of the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force. The Council have no objection to the use of a separate Field Classified Abstract for General Dunsterville’s force, if that is considered preferable to the incorporation of the expenditure in the Field Classified Abstract for Mesopotamia. 3. In the above circumstances the services of Major Whitmarsh will not be further required with the F orce, and as soon as he has completed the accounts to the date of transfer, the Council propose that he and his three clerks shall be withdrawn 4. Ihe Council suggest that the Government of India should be instructed to select a Financial Adviser for General Dunsterville’s force. Preferably, they consider, he should be regarded as a Deputy of the Financial Adviser to the force in Mesopotamia, and so far as circumstances permit, should be under the control of that officer. o. At present General Dunsterville is supplied with local currency by the Imperial Bank of Persia at Teheran, the equivalent of his drawings being placed to the credit of that Bank in London on receipt of telegraphic instructions from the British Minister at Teheran. The Council propose that this arrangement should cease and that the provision of funds for this force, as for other forces in Persia, should be undertaken by the Indian Government. Ihe whole expenditure of the force would then be included in the Indian estimates of recoverable war expenditure, in respect of which monthly advances are made to the India Office. ^ Expenditure on the Russian forces remaining in Persia . . . . is charged to Army Funds and accounted for (since the'Hamadan Board was dissolved), in the same manner as other Army expenditure, but it ... . should appear under a distinctive heading in the Field Classified Abstract. If issues of supplies or stores on any considerable scale are made to the force, a correspondingly reduced money grant should suffice for its maintenance. The expenditure on issues in kind need not appear under distinctive heads m the Field Classified Abstract, but a record should be kept so that the amounts can be readily reported if required by the Treasury.21 7. The expenditure on the Kurdish levies need not be shown separately in the Field Classified Abstract, but a record should be kept so that the total in cash or in kind can be readily ascertained if a report is called for. 8 . It is desirable, if Mr. Montagu concurs in the proposed change of- arrangements, that instructions should be given for it to take effect at the earliest possible moment .... 9. A further communication will be addressed you regarding the pay, &amp;c., of the officers and men of the force who are at present on British rates, with reference to your letter of the 27th July, No. 28880.

Separate classified abstract not necessary unless you prefer it. War Office propose if these proposals are adopted that Whitmarsh and clerks should be withdrawn as soon as he has completed his accounts to date of transfer and concur in proposal in last sentence of your telegram of 29th August. Paragraph 2.—. ... As regards accounting Treasury require that all expenditure in cash or kind on Russian forces be charged to a suspense 22436—12 G-22 account and it must therefore be separately recorded, and priced receipted vouchers for stores or supplies and receipts for cash should be obtained by you for transmission here if required.

(Enclosure No. 1.) It Will be seen from these papers that in February 1915, 1 in connection itii a demand from us for estimates of revenue and expenditure of tlie admin- rtm'que S tho™of°the“o'^l,f xp ( c f ionar y force ™ Mesopotamia. vestal ^i^lhe^O ivpr 0n ^ r °t °r f le p &lt; ^ I1 ' IInistra ( 011 - This control had been ieTel «r O the U n e °, M'a/tnder the orders contained in vour tele^iam ol the 10 th December 1914, and, m view of the responsibilities imposed on them as trustees of His Majesty’s Government thev felt li abie 5vitiiout mature consideration after experience had been gained of the requirements of the new Administration, to make any formal delegatL of hnancial powers to the General Officer Commanding, other than thofe which LzTs ss tz ei }w rt a T a of the FieM s--- ecoimts manual (War). But instructions were issued to the Field ControUer of Military Accounts, Force “ 0 ,” to audit the receipts and c larges of the administered territory. In practice, however, the local authorities submitted portions of their accounts respectively to the Field Controller and to the Comptroller, India Treasuries, while 'in the case of Accounts officer 1167 dlJ render any acc0,ults a »y regular wns I t 1 rn 4 S * * ? P / emb i e ! J 915 ' the l &gt; anki ‘ig business of the Administration at Basra was transferred to the local branch or the Eastern Bank and a treasury was also established at Basra for dealing with the accounts of the Administration I his treasury, like similar institutions in India, had, of course, no audit functions its duties being mainly confined to the preparation of a proper record ot the receipts and payments of the Administration for submission to the Accounts department. 3. In February 1916, the Central Controller of War Accounts, who had been entrusted with the task of adjusting the receipts and charges of the Administration, discovered that complete accounts were not being rendered to any Acconnts officer of the Government of India, and he asked the Chief lohtical Officer, Basra, to send him statements of complete receipts and charges, together with such accounts as had not alreadv been rendered to the Accounts department of the Government of India. Simultaneously Sir I ercy C ox proposed m his telegram of the 1.7th February 191(5, 2 that the 2 Enclosure No. 3. Chief Political Officer at Basra should ,• j i invested with full authority to dispose, under the Army Commander’s general control, of the accounts of the administered territories. We were unable to accent, the suggestion w ich 5vas incompatible with a proper discharge by us of the responsibilities imposed on us by His Majesty’s Government in respect of the administration ot the occupied territory; and in our Foreign and Political Department 3 Enclosure No. 4 . l e \ ter , No - 577 Est. B., dated the p i-,- ™ .. . ^ Ah April 1910, 3 we asked the Chief 1 optical Officer to submit the accounts of the Administration to the Central ui Conti oiler for audit and adjustment. Before arriving at this decision, we carefully considered, in consultation 5 vith our Comptroller and Auditor- General, the question of the machinery for dealing 5 vith the audit and adjustment of these accounts ; and 5ve came to the conclusion that the best 5 voi kable arrangement, at any rate for some time to come, 5 vould be to entrust the whole work to the Central War Controller. As you are aware, 5 ve had about that time decided to withdraw the bulk of the Military Accounts staff employed in connection 5 vith the accounts of Force “ D ” from Basra to Poona ; and the staff left at Basra would have been unable to deal efficiently with the accounts of the occupied territory. 4. Later on, in June 1916, 5 ve received from the Chief Political Officer, Basra, the communication and the memorandum, which form, respectively' enclosures Nos. 7 and b ot this Despatch. In these t 5 vo documents, the local authorities pressed on us the vie5v that the supreme financial control o\ T er the occupied territories vested, under international law, in the Commander of the Army of Occupation, subject to the advisory control of His Majesty’s Government, and asked that, if the Government of India 5 vere unable toaccept this position, the matter should he referred for the consideration of His Majesty’s Government. In view, however, of the fact that the admini strative control (which naturally included the linancial control) of the occupied territory had already been vested in us by His Majesty’s Govern ment (see your telegram dated the 16th December 1914), and of the subsequent correspondence 1 on the subject of the finances and accounts of the territory, we thought it unnecessary to refer to you the question of our powers of control over the local Administration , and we simply reported the facts to you in our Foreign and Political Department telegram, dated the 17th July 1916. We now submit, for your information, the complete papers bearing on the subject. 1 Vide correspondence ending witli our Finance Department Despatch No. 129, dated the 26th May 1916. 5. The experience of the preceding 12 months had, however, convinced us that it was desirable to give to the local authorities wide powers of sanctioning expenditure in connection with the administration of the occupied territory ; and, after discussion with the officer who had been deputed by them to represent their views on the subject, we decided, subject to your concurrence, to delegate to the Army Commander the powers of sanction specified in enclosure No. 9, in respect of expenditure debitable wholly to the revenues of the occupied territory. These powers are in cerfain repects wider than those recently sanctioned by you for officers of a similar status in India. But, in the present circumstances of the admini stration of the occupied territoiy, it is, in our opinion, necessary and desirable that the local authorities should be given full discretion in cerfain directions and not have to refer to us on relatively unimportant matters on which we are bound to be guided at present by their advice. This is particularly the case as regards travelling allowances, in respect of which it is not possible for us to control systematically the actions of the local authorities without hampering to some extent the exigencies of the admini stration. We may also observe, with reference to the wide powers proposed, that it will always be open to our Comptroller and Auditor-General to call our special attention to any case or question in connection with the exercise of the ppyvers, where he thinks it necessary. With reference to Rule 5 of the Rules, we may mention that this rule wall not give the Army Commander any power to sanction political payments to non-officials, and that his powers in this respect will be defined separately. 6 . We also examined, at the same time, the question of re-delegation to subordinate authorities of the. powers delegated to the Army Commander. Enclosure No. 10 of this Despatch gives the rules which we have framed in this connection. Generally speaking, the maximum powers, which will be delegated to these subordinate authorities, are not wider than those sanctioned by you for authorities subordinate to Provincial Governments in India, in your Despatch No. 51 (Financial), dated the 25th August 1916. 7. With reference to our telegram to you, dated the 17th July 1916, we informed the Chief Political Officer, Basra, that he might act on the assumption that the recommendations contained in that telegram would be accepted. We have now communicated to the local authorities the orders contained in your telegram of the 10th October 1916. 8 8 . As regards accounts and audit, we came to the conclusion that the arrangement recommended by the local authorities in Sir Percy Cox’s letter 2 * Enclosures Nos. 7 and 8. ° f g* J ! m ® 1916 &gt; a “ d Us memo- randum 1 of the same date, which m effect was that the Chief Political Officer should be the principal account and audit officer for the occupied territory, would not supply a system satisfactory either to His Majesty’s Government or the Government of India, and strong exception was taken to it by our Comptroller and Auditor- General. We accordingly decided to adhere mainly to our previous, instructions on the subject. Under the system introduced by us, the Chief Political Officer will collect all the accounts of the occupied territory. Hestpm lU fn t P rel ' ni . laa) T. examination of the accounts, and take necessary steps to settle any obvtous irregularities. He will then send the complete Ww Control er a11 ThTw? forin exce ss of Ks. 100, to the Central ar Controller.

He will also adjust and compile the accounts in a suitable 'iw a h P p‘ro , th n e m t0 7 ° U ’ WItho,,t Buchers, from time to time.

We also understood •?m .the representative of the local authorities that the arrangements introduced by us were calculated to meet all practical difficulties. We are glad.to hnd, from l T ° ur telegram of the lOtli October 19.16, that you have piovisionaliy accepted our proposals, subject to any modification that may be necessary alter consideration by His Majesty’s Treasury.

In cases in which the Army Commander, or any authority subordinate to him, has sanctioned expenditure, in the belief that it was debitable to the ievenues of the occupied territory and with reference to the powers of sanction delegated to him in respect of expenditure so debitable, but the expenditure is found on audit to be debitable to the Indian Expeditionary Force m Mesopotamia, and beyond the power of sanction of the Army Commander in his militaiy capacity, no objection to the expenditure will be raised by the audit officer except in cases where he is not satisfied that the ongmal allocation of the local authorities was made m good faith.27 Enclosure No. 10.

The Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury have had before Them Sir W. Langley’s letter of the 27th October last, respecting a proposed purchase of land at Mazil at an estimated cost of 20 lakhs of rupees (133,0000), to be charged not against military estimates, but against the revenue of the occupied territories. As Mr. Secretary Balfour is aware, my Lords had concerned Themselves to secure that the revenues in the Turkish territory now in British occupation which had been assigned to the Council of Bondholders for the service of the Ottoman Debt, should continue to be collected under the British regime, and that careful accounts of their amount should be kept in view of the ultimate settlement which must be arrived at concerning the incidence of the old Ottoman Debt. Having declared a surplus on the year to 31st March 1916, and having invested it in a special account, my Lords think that it would be unfortunate to re-open the account, and apply any part of the money so set aside for the purpose of the capital development and subsequent needs of Mesopotamia. This argument would not apply to any surplus available in respect of the period subsequent to that date. My Lords have no information on this subject, however, and I am to inquire what has been the total revenue and expenditure in the occupied territories for the year 1916-17, and the estimated revenue and expenditure for the 1 Not printed. I 22436—1230 current year, as well as the amount of the old assigned revenues for which His Majesty’s Government may be accountable (a) up to 31st March 1917, and ( 6 ) to 31st March 1918.

In continuation of our telegram No. 304 C.W.C. dated 5th February last. Adm inistered territories in Mesopotamia. Civil Commissioner in Mesopotamia reports that he has made no definite allocation of revenues to Ottoman Public Debt. All revenues which used to be assigned wholly to service of Ottoman Debt before British occupation and which continue to be recovered after occupation are, however, being recorded in accounts under separate heads. Following figures give net total amount of such revenues, main item of revenues at present being: Excise 1914-15, 2,0007. # ; 19 15-16, 6,0007.; 1916-17, 15,0007. ; 1917-18, Basra, 25,0007., Baghdad, 25,0007. As you are aware no attempt has been made to administer Turkish stamp law and no revenue has been collected under that head and Turkish tobacco regie has disappeared also. See India Office letter dated 19th January 1917 to Treasury No. P/4624. Under Turkish Government 3 per cent, out of their Customs duty of 11 per cent, ad valorem was assigned to Ottoman Debt. Customs duty was reduced to 10 per cent, ad valorem immediately on British occupation. Share of reduced duty to be assigned to Ottoman Debt has not been discussed in the past. Question is primarily one for decision of His Majesty’s Government, but if our views are required on it we would submit them on hearing from you in consultation with Civil Commissioner in Mesopotamia. Following are figures of net customs import duty from beginning of occupation: 19 14—15, 9,0007.; 1915-16, 120,0007.; 1916-1/, 300,0007.; 1917-18, 400,0007. Paragraph 2 of your telegram dated 4th February 1918. Accounts to the end of 1915-16 have been completed and detailed statement is now being- printed and will be despatched by the end of this month. Accounts for 1916-17 are nearly ready and will be despatched about end of March. Accounts for quarter ending 30th June 1917 will probably also be sent about the same time. As already stated accounts do not show allocation of revenue to Ottoman Debt.. If it be desired that there should be a prefatory abstract attached to them showing such allocation please telegraph decision about share of Customs revenue to be so allocated.F. 1633. India Office to Treasury. India Office, 26th February 1918. In continuation of my letter of 15th February, No. F. 1340, regarding the transfer to the credit of Imperial revenues of the estimated amount of surplus revenues derived from the occupied territory of Mesopotamia for the period ending 31st March 1918, I am directed to transmit, for the informa-, tion and consideration of the Lords Commissioners, a copy of a telegram dated 15th instant, from the Government of India, the latter part of which deals with the despatch of the accounts. I have, &amp;c., William Robinson, The Secretary, Treasury. Financial Secretary. 35. Treasury to India Office. No. 8308/18. . Treasury Chambers, Sir, • 4th April 1918. I. have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury Mr. Robinson’s letter of the 26th February last (F. 1633) and its enclosed copy of a telegram, dated the 15th idem, from the Government of India relative to the surplus revenue of Mesopotamia. In reply I am to say that provided record is being kept of the revenues which have been by Turkish law assigned to the service of the Ottoman Debt, My Lords do not think it is necessary that the published accounts should show the allocation of these revenues. They would be glad, however, to receive for Their own information a statement showing the position of these revenues. The Under Secretary of State for India. I am, &amp;c., John Bradbury. 36. Mr. Howard to Mr. Robinson. No. 510 E.B. Simla, My dear Robinson, _ 17th April 1918. Under the orders contained in the Secretary of State’s telegram of the 16th December 1914, which was quoted in paragraph 2 of despatch from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department No. 22 , dated the 13th April 1917, the control of the administered territory in Mesopotamia was vested in the Government of India. Strictly speaking, therefore, the Government of India were empowered from the former date to sanction expenditure chargeable to the revenues of the administered territory subject to the limitations which govern their powers of sanctioning expenditure from Indian revenues. The position was not, however, fully lealised at our end at the earlier stages of occupation ; and in several cases we referred for the sanction of the Secretary of State expenditure which was within oui powers of sanction under standing arrangements governing our financial powers. Latterly we have been more consistent in this matter and have not tioubled the Secretary of State for sanction of expenditure which was within our powers of sanction. We propose to adhere to this arrangement strictly in future. ■r~rj i Yours sincerely, YY. Robinson, Esq. H. F. Howard.33 Sir, P. 2824. 37. India Office to Foreign Office.

I am f° request you to inform Mr. Secretary Balfour that I heir Lordships have no information as to the extent of the authority proposed to be delegated to the Government of India. While they have no desire to be consulted on matters of administrative routine, They think that, so long as the ultimate financial responsibility rests on the British Exchequer, this Department should be consulted on any expenditure of large amount or of a discretionary character in which questions of policy are involved ; and it. is not clear to Them that this ia secured under the procedure proposed.
