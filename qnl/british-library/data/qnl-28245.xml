The 'report for 1947-48 ( year ending 31st March 1948 ) will be forwarded as usual in due course. My comments on dollar exchange and dry dates price are given below 1. The exchanged remained unsteady and jumpy throughout the gre?\ter p&amp;rt of 1947. The rate opened at hs. 236 = £ 100 in January, and closed at Rs. 216 = # 100 in December, 1947. Between January and December, the rate continued to fluctuate steadily this process of •• Dollar deflation ,r was arrested. The prime factor responsible for this phase was continued difficulty in our date export market,v/hich reduced the purchasing power of dollar The banking regulation in India governing the operation of non residents accounts, ana the consequential discontinuance of ' Hundi system 1 helped to some extent in ’ deflating ' dollar, owing to the increasing scarcity of Rupee currency. 2. The dry date market opened very satisfactorily, the price for superior quality being $ 440 per bahar of 1800 lbs in the month of July 1947. In December price of the same quality came down to £ 195 per bahar. Similarly, the price of the inferior quality opened at ^ 330 per bahar in July, and came to stay at 3 160 per bahar in December. practically the only buyer of dry dates, is responsible for this phenomenal decrease in the price of dry dates. The future of dry date market in India is still underminable, and is doubtful if it will reach to its old level in foreseeable future. in a downward trend; and never once throughtout the entire year The import trade restriction in India, which is Director General c^f-^CnTtomsCONFIDEMTIAX, Hq&gt; C&gt; 8$ » ll/l Political Agency, Muscat. 5th February, 194S.

The cause is not always easy to know, but such conditions are closely connected te other diseases due te malnutrition and venereal diseases. Ear and eye diseases nay also be included in the above group as being due te some lack of vitamins. Thede diseases may almost be said to be confined to the poor class of the population#. Malaria has shown a very satisfactory decrease, possibly due te the people becoming a little mere malaria conscious and the Health Department's taking up of the matter seriously. This year separate figures of malaria infections as they occurred in Muscat and Muttrah were not maintained. The population of these two towns are constantly changing their abode from Mattrah to Muscat, and vice versa. The figure therefore shows only the place where the patient was resident at the time of illness not necessarily the place where infection occurred. Dysentery and Bowel diseases are very difficult to eradicate as the fly Infestation of Muscat and Muttrah is very great. Tuberculosis, like venereal disease, is regarded as a very common ailment and no regard is paid to their evil consequences even by the better class citizens. The Medical Store Depot at Bombay has been the main source of supply in the past. During 1947 they supplied about half of what was asked for. Supplementary indents were not complied with, as the matter of further supplies has been referred to the Now Indian Government, and so ffer no decision has been arrived at. If further supplies are not received, a requisition will have to be made to firms in the United Kingdom. / &gt;•^7 3 7^1 N« recant Indents for inetrunenta have been oubnltted as the present ones although eld are serviceable. If, in the future, major surgical work is anticipated, new instruments will have te be obtained. A well appointed Operation Theatre nee exists. The following equipment was purchased for the hospital from money available in the Hospital Voluntary Fund. 6 Godrej steel beds 6 Alwyn steel beds 1 2 horsepower Holden Brooks Centrifugal pump 1 Iren Fracture bed 2 Steel tanks for water storage. 1 Electrolux frigidaire 3 English white glased sinks Blankets, sheets, towels, pillows etc. Pipes to connect the hospital with the main water supply are on order but have net been received. Wire gause for the wards has net yet arrived. The Laboratory is new built and cemplete. Essential furniture has been installed and laboratory equipment purchased. These expenses were also met from the above fund. The hospital new has a total of 22 beds. 20 for Asiatics and 2 in a separate ward for Europeans. In-patients are chiefly men from the Muscat Infantry and Police. Admission is open te all, but civilians, mostly merchants, prefer rooms to themselves, and as the hospital has large open wards except for the two small rooms net many are admitted. Dieting of patients is either from their homes, or from the Unit Lines. The Medical Officer in charge of the hospital diets from his own kitchen those Europeans from the Merchant Havy, if admitted. Staff This remains as for the previous year, visl- A Medical Officer in charge, and Indian Assistant Surgeon, one locally trained dispenser and three ward servants. / Quarantine4 n . ft (•) avpr^iB* / During the yearthere was no epidemic and the Quarantine Station at Harenal remained dosed* This station had repairs carried out to the buildings in 1946* New cemented roofing was also used to replace the old Date thatch* Late in January 1947 the roof of the larger building fell in* The Secretary to His Highness the Sultan accompanied by the Quarantine Medical Officer visited the station and found the wooden beams used for supporting the roofing far toe fragile to be of aoy use* It was proposed to obtain sanction from the Sultan to rebuild the whole place* The situation in India caused uneasiness and in order that the station nay be of use immediately # the buildings were re** thatched with Date* A wall has also been built around the buildings dividing the area from the village near by* The station requires a lot more attention, and the Secretary to the Sultan is aware ef the situatien* During the year reports were received fren Dubai and other Persian Gulf Ports of a cholera outbreak* Several anti cholera measures wore planned for tho protection of Muscat and Muttrah but fortumtely did not have to be applied* It was found that while Ha renal was useful to quarantine ships and ship passengers, it was not practicable to use it for Read traffic and passengers* Haremal on tko East coast lino of Iftiscat can only bo reached by sea* A narrow track is all that connects Haremal with Muscat by land. The road enters Muscat - Muttrah almost due West* Had any oases ♦ ef cholera been imported by read and the intention been to isolate them at Haremal, it would have meant taking them through the main street of Mzttrah, through the bazaar down to the sea front for embarking for Haremal. Flies abound in Muttrah and such a procedure would have completely defeated anti cholera measures* / ThreeThree thatched huts were erected outside the Toll Gate, one for persons from an Infected area, one for contacts, one to be used as a hospital* Water,servants, guards, disposal of excreta were arranged, but fortunately not used or required* Anti cholera vaccine ran out and supplies could not be obtained from either India or the United Kingdom. Later the Chief Quarantine Medical Officer Bahrain sent supplies to Muscat* There were no cases of small pox in Muttrah or Muscat although alarmist rumours were current that small pox had broken out in Muttrah. Neither the Quarantine Medical Officer nor Dr. Thoms of the American Medical Mission hospital saw any such cases* The supply of vaccine lymph from India is causing anxiety. The Assistant Director of Public Health, West Punjab, states that further supply of vaccine lymph every week has been stopped till normal arrangements for mail are restored* Muscat is not on ary air route, shipping is irregular, and if India, the only country that can possibly supply Muscat with fairly fresh lymph now closes down on such supplies the situation is extremely dangerous* 3. mXLIWi PITWM (a) Tribal Very early in the year the Imam's health was in a precarious condition and it was feared that he would die* However in March His Highness the Sultan received information from the interior that the Imam had recovered sufficiently to dispel fears of his death in the near future. At the time of the Imam's illness some pressure was brought to bear on him regarding the nomination of a successor, but apparently he refused to do so* The general consensus of opinion at that time was that in the event of the Imam's death without his nominating a successor, serious disturbances would result In the interior in a general bid for the I met mate* / Sheikh/ &lt;* 6 Sheikh Mohammed bin Isa bin Saleh al Hart hi of Sharqiyah who had only succeeded his father the previoue year, died in April, nouinatinj Saleh bln Ahiaad al Kart hi as his successor* The Hinawis however decided otherwise and appointed Saleh bin Isa al Hart hi the brother of the late Sheikh Mohammed as the new Sheikh of the Sl^arqiyah. Another death of one of the leading personalities of the interior was that of Sheikh All bln Abdullah al Hamoodah al Alvi, Sheikh of the Beni Bu All tribe, Ja'alan, otherwise known as Vfelad al Amir who died in December* He was a very influential Sheikh and was independent ef both the loam and the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, but maintained good relations with the Sultan* Ho is succeeded by his son Khalid* From about August and until the end of the year, the tribes of Ncu/rr the Beni Ka v ab, Niam, Al Abu Shands, who occupy the area Baraimi - Dhank - Yankul, displayed an unusual restlessness, carrying out continuous spasmodic raids in the Shines and harrassing the inhabitants by looting, murdering lonely travellers and burning dwelling places* Ths Muscat Government were very concerned over this but did nothing practical to safeguard the Inhabitants of this part of their territory* Eventually Ismail ar Has easel. Head Hall and Wall of Muttrah was deputed to visit the area and see what could be done to stop these attacks* Saiyld Faisal bln Said was also sent with a small party of Askers, but no effective action resulted* News was received reporting the movements of the Oil Company party operating in the Baraimi - Dhahira area and this brought pretests from the Minister of Interior, although the Sultan was awars of this party 1 s operations and had given his provisional consent* (b) Local An Egyptian steamer 'Star of Mex' ran aground and was looted near Ras al Kbabb in February* The Political Agent, accora anled by the Commandant of the Muscat Levy Corps and Saiyid Faisal bin Said left for Ras al Khabb in H*M*I*S* Dhanush with a Levy escort but found that the Captain had already abandoned ship and left. Investigations suggested that the Captain- 7 ttftfOprtwto of tho ship had entered into negotiations with the lecal Sheikh 9 Sheikh Ali bin AbduXlah of the Beni Pu Ali f for unloading the e&amp;rgo, against the advice of the Wali of Sur, Sheikh Taqoob bin Abdullah. When the tribesmen had boarded the ship to work the cargo, the captain ms unable to control them, he had decided to abandon the ship and together with hie crew board the tanker •British Destiny* which had arrived at the scene. Later in the month Salyid Ahmed bin Ebrehim, Minister of Interior went to the spot to endeavour to recover the looted cargo from tho tribesmen. A considerable portion of the cargo was recovered, though not all of it. The Mali of Sur, Sheikh Yaqoob bin Abdullah al Hashmi was later removed from his pogtu as it was considered that even though the looting, was in the first place brought about through the Captain 1 a failure to accept his advice, he had none the less after the event profited from the stolen goods. The ship owners are attempting to claim compensation for the cargo lost, but it is almost certain that the Muscat Government will not concede this. His Highness Shaikh Sir Ahmed al Jabir As Subah, K.C.S.I., B.C.I.E., Shaikh of Kuwait, came ashore at Muscat whilst on his way to Karachi. Salyid Shlhab bin Ealsal gave a big luncheon party in the Shaikh's honour at Bait al Barsa. The Sheikh very proudly and openly compared Kuwait to ^ Muscat much to the detriment of Muscat, in the field of internal developments and social improvements. The Constitutional changes in India wars watched comparatively quietly and with no unusual interest and celebrations of Independence Day were carried out on a rather small scale by the Indian and Pakistani subjects. The Palestine situatlen had no serious repercussions in Muscat as only a very few could be expected to appreciate the situation enough to become interested or take any practical action in sppport of their convictions• / TheTfc* occasion of the weddlnf of Har Royal Hl^mess Prlnceas Elisabeth was celebrated with enthusiasm. The Sultan cent a telegram congratulating Hie Ifejesty King George VI and offering his best wishes to the Royal couple. Telegrams of congratulations wen. also sent by the Khoja and Hindu communities, and the Khoja community sent the Princess a wedding present. A considerable number of people left Muscat, Huttrah, (ten and the Batinah for Keweit and Bahrain owing te lack of employment and 1ear oi starvation. The total number of people who left the State during 1947 is estimated at 2,000. The following transfers among the Balls occurred during the year. Sheikh Xaqeob bin Abdullah al Hashrai, Bali of Sur was discharged and relieved temporarily by Sheikh Mansur bin Ghalib, the Wall of Ja'alan. Salyid Uahd bin Hilal bln All al Busaidi has h finally been appointed as the now Wall of Sur and Mansur bln Shall* has returned to the Ja'alan. Salyid Badr bin Saud Wall of Owadur was rellevwd by hie brother Saiyid Hilal bln Saud, who was relieved as Wall of Khaaab by Ibrahim bin Saud. bin Harab has been appointed temporary Hall of Sohar. laqub bln Abdullah, previously Wall of Sur has been appointed temporary Wall of Khabura. 4. TBATW: (a) The following table gives the comparative values ef imports end experts during the last three years. Totul imports for the year 1946/47 show an increase ef 13 £ over that ±or 1945/46. Imports from India chewed s marked decrease, mainly attributable te existing axport restrictions In that country. Tear imports Rs. 1,73,17,100/- Ro. 1,61,43,500/- Re. 1,85,30,300/- Exporta Rs. 1,57,66,400/- Rs. 1,79,66,700/- Rs. 1,71,34,500/- 1944/45 1945/46 1946/47 / This9 This deficiency was remedied by the Increase of imports from the United Kingdem, Persian Gulf and Iraq. The export figures my have been nrueh higher except that there mas a temporary embarfce placed by the Government of India on the import of dates into that country by steamer; and as India is the only buyer of Muscat's dry dates the less to the date trade was considerable during the period when the position was being clarified.

Klehneae Salvld Said bln Talaur His Highness was absent from Muscat throughout the year, and all matters requiring his personal attention had to be transmitted to Salalah. His Highness* prolonged absence from the capital has placed a big responsibility on his Ministers and Government officials, and the trend of public opinion is that these officials have acted in a manner more for their own interests than for the interests of the State. The Sultan is evidently aware of this and is very keen to obtain the services of a British Officer for his Foreign Secretary, and, to generally supervise the administratien during his absences from the capital. The Sultan*a return to Muscat was delayed ewlng to the fact that the Petroleum Concessions Limited Geologists* party postponed their visit to Dhofar until February 1948 and His Highness considered his presence in Dhofar essential to ensure satisfactory arrangements were made for the i period of the geologist party*s visit. His Highness has been / attempting- 13 - &amp;&gt; attempting a littla exploration on hie own and discorered what he hopes will prove to be a profitable mica mine, and also high quality iron ore deposits• The report of Sir Cyril Fex, Director of Geological Survey of India, at the time, who surveyed the Dhofar region early in the year 9 has given His Highness high hopes of the potential mineral wealth of that region of his territory. His Highness maintained good health throughout the year, but proposes visiting Bombay shortly for a thorough medical examination and attention by dental, and eye specialists* (b) Salvid Shiha b bin Phisal He continued acting as His Highness the Sultan's representative at Ceremonials throughout the year* On the occasion of the visit of the U.S. Destroyer 'Hyman rt to Muscat in May, Saiyld Shihab entertained the Captain and other officers at an Arab luncheon, and presented the Captain with a silver teapot and sugar bowl as a gift* Salyid Shihab has not been keeping very well and intends going to Sober after the Sultan's return, if the Sultan will permit him* (c) Salyid q&amp;im ur bin Faisal Ths ex Sultan remained in India throughout the year, but ie planning a visit to Dhofar sometime in 1948* He remained in office as the Minister for the Interior* The Sultan evidently expressed his disapproval of Saiyid Ahmed's handling of the 'Star of Mex' case and at one time he feared that he was in danger of losing his post* (e) Saiyld Tarla bin tiamur He continued as President, Uunlcipal Ceuncil throughout the year. (f) Saiyld Fahr bin Tajanr Sal} id Fahr hntered the Indian Military Aoadeny at Dehra Dun at the beginning of the year and two reports from the Aeade^y show that he impressed the authorities very favourably and was considered almost the beet cadet of hie platoon* (d) Salyid Ahmed bln Ebrahln / 2- u - 2 . mB &amp; J W Li w m Th® President of the Municipal Council, Saiyid Tariq bln Talraur devoted his energies to maintaining and even improving the cleanliness of the streets and roads of Muscat, but Muttrah proved too difficult a problem with the resources at his disposal, and the difficulty of obtaining the co-operation of the inhabitants. No tangible progress was made in improvements and repairs and new constructions of municipal facilities owing to the non-availability of cement at moderate rates. 3. EDUCATION The standard of teaching and in fact general training of the pupils of the Saiyidieh School has been raised considerably under the direction sf Ghallb N&amp;qshbandl the Palestinian Headmaster. Hs stresses the importance of physical fitness as well as education and has inaugurated compulsory games of volley ball, and other outdoor sports for the boys, and evsn takes thsm out into the country and eoa shore for week ends. The girls* school too, it is reported has made rapid advancement towards talsing the standard of education under the supervision of Mistress Munirah, niece of Qhallb Naqshbandl the Headmaster of the Bqys* School. 4. GENERAL COMMUNICATIONS For the major portion of the year Muscat was in direct cable communication with Aden only,owing to frequent temporary interruptions of the Bahrein and Bushire cables. The Muscat - Karachi cable which was destroyed by earthquake in November 1945 was re-layed by the cable ship Recorder in November. Direct cable communication now exists with Karachi, Aden and Bahrain. The cable ships 'Cable Enterprise', 'Norseman', 'Bullfinch' and 'Recorder' visited the area on repair work. Colonel H. Bloodworth, C.E.E. of Cablo and Wireless, visited Muscat in June to carry out a survey on the possibility of installing an automatic telephone system in the towns of Muscat and Muttrah. The plans of the proposed system have been submitted to His Highness th# Sultan for his approval. / 4sAs a result of constitutional changes in India, the post offices at Muscat and Gwadur are now administered by the Pakistan Posts and Telegraphs Department* TRANSPORT External - 17 mall steamers from India and 21 from the Persian Gulf called at Muscat during during 1947* The following oil tankers oAlled at Muscat Khuzistan 8 trips British Chemist 1 trip Southern Collins 1 trip* The following foreign steamers called i- Salvore (Italian cargo vessel) Herdls (Norwegian cargo vessel). 6. mhh Subedar Paqir Mohd remained in charge of the Police Force throughout the year* 7* DEFENCE Captain J*E*H* Hudson commanded the Muscat Levy Corps until August 1947 when he left for the United Kingdom* Subedar Major Allah Dad 0*B*I* officiated as Commandant of the Levy Corps from August until the arrival of the new Commandant, Major T*P* Greenwood, late of the Balueh Regiment Quetta* 8. 9, im The follewing naval ships visited Muscatt* H.M.S.

The Gwadur - Pasni landline was continually interrupted throughout the year owing te frequent breaks in the line, and it is considered that the landline should be replaced by the installation of a wireless set at Gwadur, as this would ensure constant communication with the outside world. 8.

I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of the Administration Report for the year ending 31st. December,1947, for your information. 2 I have the honour to be Sir, four most obedient servant. Administrator, Gruadur/iMHODUCTioii or Rsroaas m guadur ADMINISTRATION RSPORT K)R TIIS IBAR ENDING 31st. DECEMBER,1947. aid 'Dar* which means 'Gate of Wind* It is a most appropriate name because it literally is what the name suggests. Guadur is situated ' in the Gulf of Oman on the Me*ran coast and is a dependency of the Siltan of Muscat and Oman. It is a natural sea port with great potentiality for development. The town of Guadur with an estimated population of 8000 is built on a picturesque strip of sandy tract dotted all over by tall graceful date-palm trees which present a veiy delimitfUl view. The town is surrounded on three sides by the Araoian sea and is lying between the two bays near the end of a narrow strip of land about three miles long and half to one-fourth of a raile in width and is connected with the main coast from the north. This 'T* shaped projection in the sea ends in the south with a metff called *Koh Batail'* The town is built on sandy but hard bank of the eastern bay on a little raised ground and consists uiottly of muu buildings. There are several good buildings also of which Jumatkhaua* of the Aghakhanis is the most conspicuous,which is a permanent structure of good and coloured design. The town was slightly damaged in the earthquake of 1945 * particularly those buildings as were directly exposed to the sea. The sea is encroach ing gradually and has notched the bank badly from the British Agent 1 of lice to the fish go downs, a distance of about quarter mile,leaving it in a most ragged condition. There are several half washed build ings still standing on the edge of the bank and the impression they give is not quite pleasant. Although no immediate danger is antici pated, yet it is feared, the town in the event of similar natural causes as mentioned above will be left at the mercy of angxy sea 'bich generally take a heavy toll in such cases. Necessity of some iand ot Preventive measure is naturally obvious, but inview of the prohibitive expenditure involved, it can not be contemplated at pre- west and is about 1 to 2 miles in width. There is a cultivable catchment area on top of the reef which is entirely dependent on rainfall and whenever there are good rains produces suffient quanti* o-l vegetable to meet the local requirement of the town. There also exist an ancient masonry dam in the catchment area although it is In a bad state of repairs now. 3. Guadur has no permanent source of irrigation and it can not be stated definitely whether or not the natural water resources can be tapped effectively unless experiments under technical supervisio sent. 2 . Ihe reef in the south extends about 11 miles from east touxw mule to boro either artislan wells or locate eome other oaturtJ source* Ihe tow gets its drinking water oupply rroa the temporary wells dug in purely sandy soil towards northern side or the town just between the iSaet and West Bays near the £brt in the narrowest place or the projected strip. Water is slightly saltish, out others wise is considered quite nt for human consumption. Mo particular complaint has oyer been reported which would suggest possibility or its containing any injurious substance. Guadue has a temperate climate and le considered to be ono or the most healthy place in the coastal towns or the Ouir. 4. Guadur is also wollknown tor trade. On the Kekrou coast it is the only port which serves as the distributing centra Cor the produce of kekraa, inch as Ghee, cotton, whoat, cereals, dates goat-hair and wool. Its indigenous produce le fish which is faaoue both for quality as well as valety, and also provide main source of occupation to the local inhabitants of the place, irocperity of tiie whole town depends on the 21 sb trade ^aiivty which after being salted and dried is exported neatly to Colombo and some to Hongkong and llefcukan are the two mbildiary small ports v&amp;iich fall under the juriedictlon of Guadur. The fonser is situated on thc 5 mouth of the east bey on the co&amp;fct is about 12 miles by lend route from Guadur, while the latter is on the same ooaet in the west Bay about 2o miles by land, is^xtlatlon of Sur is estimated at looo and that of iiehukan at 1t&gt;oo. Both these ports are exclusively dependent on rich trade. fir!Kninr'f ^ ^ ^ i Ihe Government of huecat and Oman in the welfare of its uaojecta and those living under its protection some time ago ^ decided to Improve the general conditions of Guadur by introducing executive and awnlcipal reforaa in its dependency at the cost of haavy expoadituro. As s remilt of this coamkindable decision, a post of Administrator was created and R.B.«d&gt;dul uai, &amp;B 3 | a learned and expari.^ieod retired officer of the Government of India was appoint* in that post on contract basis with a view to execute various tichcv.es and proposals connected with reforms. Khan Bahadur, however could not moke much progress due to non-avail ability of medical, educational and other technical staff which the Government had sanctioned for this jxiposs and eventually after about nine months stay was compelled to relinquish charge of nie duties on account of a midden attack of serious illness. 2 hs post of administrator after Khan Bahadur’s departure in September 1946, remained vacant it was again filled up by the undersigned in tho end of ?eb- i ruary, 1947 whose f?emceu had been requisitioned on deputation fxvhi; t.-to Baluchistan Administration by the Government of Muscat and Oman. 7. It woe ofcourse obvious from the vexy begining that no practic e-3- i^V shape could he giren to the various veil considered schemes sanc tioned by the Government unless the necessary staff was first recruited. But recruitment of staff was unfortunately delayed inspite of continuous efforts due to unsettled conditions then prevailing in India. [Conservation of | Q ^ ^ ^ |fool supplies | 8 * 10 m * 9t witJa tJae si^a^Ion reailting from the universal shortage of essential commodities and to improve the rationing system, a Control Committee consisting of 11 members from the officials, gentry and merchant community was formed in the begining of the year under report. Main finction of the Committee ' is to ensure by devising such workable means according to the local conditions, as would result in equitable distribution of essential' commodities to the public on rates fixed by the committee. Allowing margin for unavoidable pilferage and profiteering, the system devise under guidance of the Administrator had been working satisfactorily on the whole. A detailed report in this connection had already been made vide D.O.Ho.9/9-47, dated the 2oth. January, 1948, to the address of the Secretary to the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. Copies of the proceedings of meetings held were also furnished to the Secretary from time to time. I j , niclpalityj ^ x© improve sanitation, street-lifting and other important affairs connected with the civic life, the municipality which existed already in a miniature form was expanded by forming a committee of six nominated members from the Baluchis, Aghakhanis and Hindu communities with a ratio of 3-2-1 respectively on the lines and principle of the municipality in Muscat. But due to un- forseen circumstances the committee could not function properly as it should have done. Demise of Kauda Abdulla, one of the leading members of the committee, whose substitute is still in Karachi settling bussiness affairs of his deceased father and long absence of two other leading members from the Aghakhanis i.e. Seth Hahmat- ull&amp;-3ashir and Seth Badeali-Ahmad who are also in Karachi settling their bussiness affairs a arising from the evacuation of Hindu merchants of that place are the main causes for the above explained position. However, efforts are being made either to replace these members by those who reside better part of the year in Guadur or msk® some such suitable arrangement as would facilitate proper function of the committee. The matter has already be.n referred to the agha&amp;hani Council at Guadur. Assurance has bejn given that the question will be discussed and settled by the Council as soon as its quorum is complete, from the information received, it is believ the committee will be able to strait its function properly by the end of March or at the latest begining of April 1948. 1o. The post of Sanitary Inspector remained vacant during the whole year.

The English and Urdu teachers recruited from Karachi reached Guadur on 19th. October, 1947. After making necessary arrangements and discussing the whole programme of education with the teachers, a meeting was held on 3oth. October 1947, in the premises of the school under presidentship of the Wali,where notable persons from all the communities were present, who were explained in Urdu by the undersigned and in Baluchi by the Head- Mast er, advantages of education and advised to de rive fUll benifit from the Institution which was being established for the sole benifit of the people of Guadur and its suberbs. The school with proper ceremony was opend on the 12th. November, 1947, as intimated in this office memorandum No.3o3 dated the 22 nd. November, 194/. In the begining only three classes were started, but the school is now functioning upto Y standard and subject to Government approval,will be raised to the middle standard In due course. The number of students in the begining jrfas reported £8 the memorandum referred to above was 1o2. This has since increased to 157. The accoimsodation in the existing school building is inadequate and it is getting over crowded every day. To avoid congestion it Is necessary to construct new building as soon as the overseer arrives and building material is arrangec as already proposed in the Budget Bertimate for the year 1948 aibmitted with this office letter No.315 dated the 17th. Becembea 1947. 1b. The old school staff has also been absorbed as intima ted vide letter No. 3o4 dated the 23rd. November, 1947. The Arabic teacher Maulvi Mohammad Mossa who was in Karachi took up his new appointment on 14th. January, 1948. 17. Scouting on proper lines has been introduced in the school including other sports. The public has shown their love for education beyond expectation. The school except for inadenua'. accommodation and shortage of books etc. is otherwise fbnctionin&lt; most sat I sfactoily. The Head—Master Mr. Mohammad Yousif Is a very intelligent man with a long experience of teaching line.The I Urdu teacher Mr. Mohammad Issa is also an experienced hand and is most suitable person for infant education. Similarly Arabic teacher Mewlvi Mohammad Mossa has got a long experience of teach* ing and ie well-versed in theology, Arabic, Persian and Baluchi languages. The II Urdu teacher Mr. Ismdll 3 aah although un qualified, yet possess considerable teaching experience. It Is really fortunate to have a staff of teachers whose mother tongue is Baluchi, as this is the type of staff which really suits the local conditions where most of the children studying in the school are Baluchis.Y r Jliibllc 4orks j 18* In the budget Ibr the year 194 b, amount of rl. 22,5 oo wae aanotloned by tliar Govemnent under non—recurring expenditure for construction of a part of the nuaicipal office, building and Hoopitul. No tiling was spent out of thie allot ment In 1346. Hiring the year under report also none of the major conrrtruction work was taken in haiid for want of technical man rc(|uir©d for the preparation of plans and cetimatce of the above mentioned buildings, und alao due to non-availability of building mateilal and Hkillod labour. Jbr execution of all the major works, it is necessary to secure first rervices of an experienced and reliable ovoroour ae repoi*ted before in tois office memorandum Mo. 202 dated the 5th. November, 1947. The efforts made by the undersigned in thie connection have not been successful so far, ae will be observed from the enclosed copy of the telegram from kitomologict Baluchistan. Failure in this respect can also be attributed to the reasons discussed in paras 6 and 7 of this report. Efforts are still being made through the influence of the Head-master daidie .School Guadur for securing the services of an experienced overseer from Karachi, out on account of the reasons already explained, it can be cold definitely whether such efforts will west with any success or not. In the light of experienced gained, it will alec be necessary to 'import skilled labour from Muscat or Pakistan when construction works are taken in hand, as skilled labour is not available in Guauur.
