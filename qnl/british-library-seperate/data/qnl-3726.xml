Details of most incoming flights were sent by the RAF Commanding Officer at Bahrain to the Political Agency, with details passed on to the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, as appropriate. These telegrams contains details of the anticipated arrival of flights, flight numbers, flight itineraries, names of crew and passengers, and some detail of instruction upon arrival: reporting to the customs department, passport medical officer.The file’s office notes, written by the Political Agent, Captain Hugh Dunstan Rance, his Assistant and others, give indication of an incident in late 1946 when there were breakdowns in telephone communication between RAF officials, customs house officials and employees at the Political Agency, on the event of an aircraft arriving at Muharraq airfield (f 7), in turn provoking further discussion (summarised in typewritten notes on f 23) on how best to manage the flow of information to various parties (customs, quarantine) in the event of new arrivals at Bahrain in future.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>RAF Commanding Officer, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Quarantine Medical Officer, Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Passports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Quarantine</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00033d#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00033d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
