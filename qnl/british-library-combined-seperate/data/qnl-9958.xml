Topics discussed include the hiring of teachers from Egypt, educational reform and the role of the British Council. The appointment of a replacement for Wakelin in 1945 is briefly discussed towards the end of the file.In addition to correspondence between Wakelin and other British officials (notably the Political Agency in Kuwait), the file also contains a large amount of correspondence between him and the Ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah and Kuwait's Department of Education (much of which is in Arabic accompanied by English translations). A limited amount of correspondence between British officials in Egypt and the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also present (this is largely in French and occasionally in Arabic).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Education</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000bc#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000bc#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000bc#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000bc#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
