THE instructions to tire Sub-Committee were to consider the effect that the completion of the Baghdad Railway may have on the situation—strategical, political, and commercial—in Southern Persia and the Persian Gulf, and the measures that it may be necessary to take in advance for the maintenance of British interests in those regions, either immediately or after the railway has reached Baghdad. The results of the Sub-Committee’s investigations, as well as their recommen dations, have been divided for convenience of reference under several headings, and are recorded below. 1. British Shipping and Trade in the Gulf. (a.) The Committee are of opinion that the competition to which British trade in the Persian Gulf is exposed is not merely commercial, but has a distinctly political object. British claims to political predominance in the Gulf are based mainly upon the fact of our commercial interests having hitherto been predominant, and should our trade, as a result of a German forward commercial policy, be impaired, our political inlluence woidd proportionately diminish. It follows that purely political action on our part, not having as its objective the development of material British interests, might have a prejudicial effect, both politically and commercially, by reason jof the suspicions it would be likely to rouse. Trade. (b.) The Committee are not satisfied that commercial interests in the Gulf are adequately represented on the establishment of the Consul-General at Bushire. The fact that special agents are from time to time sent from this country to inquire into commercial matters in Persia, shows that the want is felt. The Resident and Consul- General at Bushire, the chief authority in the Gulf, has in present circumstances to be an officer of the Indian Political Department, who has political duties to perform in connection with Muscat, the Pirate Coast, the Turkish littoral of the Gulf, Bahrein, and Koweit, but is unlikely to possess adequate commercial knowledge. The Com mittee would recommend that the present Vice-Consulate at Bushire should be raised in status to a Consulate, and should always be held by a commercial expert of a standing to command the confidence of manufacturers in this country and in India, and to be regarded by them as a competent adviser. The Committee recognize that this proposal will entail expense, but they are of opinion that such expenditure would be legitimate, and useful in safeguarding British commercial interests in the Persian Gulf. Shipping. (c.) The trade between India and the Gulf appears at present to be safe in British hands. The position of the British India Steam Navigation Company has not been seriously assailed, and no assistance is required in this quarter. But as regards the trade between Europe and the Gulf, the evidence which has been laid before the Committee tends to show that the Hamburg-Amerika Line isVI11 RErORT. making vigorous endeavours to secure a share in the trade in the Gulf, not primarily to extend their commerce, but to secure a political status in that region in view of future developments. (d.) There are plain indications that this Company is sustaining material losses bv its operations m the Persian Gulf. There is reason to believe that these losses are not borne by the Company, but whether they are made good by the German Government, or in what form, is not clear. (e.) It seems that these heavy losses, incurred at a time of trade depression in Germany, are one of the causes of the anxiety which has been recently evinced bv the Ham burg-Amerika Line to come to some agreement with the British shipping iinns m the Gulf. 11 (/•) An agreement between the British firms and the Hamburg—Amerika Line to hx rates would be detrimental to the interests of British exporters, for not only would British merchants be thereby deprived of the advantage of free competition in reights, but they would not be guaranteed equality of opportunity with the German exporters, since the latter might, and probably would, obtain preferential treatment in v 1 special rates on the German State Railways—a matter which it would be dimcult to detect and impossible to prevent. (g.) Hence, should Messrs. Strick and BucknalTs Combine approach His Majesty’s Government with a request for assistance, the Committee recommend that some support should be given, which might take the form of a postal subvention, the exact details to be determined when the occasion arises. 2. Navigation on the Tigris. (a.) The Committee are of opinion that it is desirable that the navigation of the igns should be developed, and that advantage should be taken of any opportunity to encourage British subjects to obtain a Concession for improving the waterway. ( 6 .) The steamer service on the Tigris between Basra and Baghdad is now conducted by six steamers, owned by the Sultan of Turkey, and two, with a third in reserve, which are run by a British firm (Messrs. Lynch and Co.), who receive a postal subsidy of 1,600L a-year from the British Government, under a Concession from the lurkish Government. (c.) L o favourable opportunity should be neglected to press for an extension of the existing British Concession, or to assist a British firm, preferably the British India Steam Navigation Company, to acquire the Sultan’s steamers. 3. Lighterage. The evidence shows that trade in the Gulf is much hampered by the inefficiency of the lighterage services at the different ports, more particularly at Busin re. There is reason to suppose that the British India Company might be prepared to enter into negotiations for the acquisition of the lighterage services, and the Committee recommend that this Company should be approached with a view to ascertaining if such is the case. ( 6 .) Should the British India Company show a disposition to proceed in the matter, they should be assured of the diplomatic support of His Majesty’s Government. Ihe cost should be borne by the shippers and traders concerned. 4. Lighthouses and Buoyage. it is desirable that, if the British shipowning Companies press for additional navigational lights in the Gulf, all reasonable steps should be taken to meet their wishes, yet, in view of the limited volume cf the trade at present, the Committee do not recommend that any considerable expenditure that could not be recouped by light dues should be incurred under this head. But they are of opinion that it would be worth while to incur the expenditure involved in the proposal, now under consideration, to send a Commission to collect information, consisting of the bemor Laval Officer, the officer in charge of the Indian Marine Survey, and an expert to be obtained through the Trinity House. This Commission would also deal with the question of buoyage. This proposal has the support of the Inter- Departmental Committee (Foreign Office, India Office, and Admiralty). The cost will be that of the expert and incidental expenses; the other two officers receiving no extra pay. ®Report. ix 5. Wireless Telegraphy. A scheme for establishing wireless telegraphy stations in the Gulf is now under the consideration of the Government of India in connection with a general scheme for establishing, for strategical purposes, such stations on the coasts of India. These proposals contemplate the erection of stations at Henjam (or Jask) and Bahrein (or Koweit) at an estimated initial expenditure of 3,BOOL and 1,050L a-year recurring. A proposal to fit the three subsidized vessels in the Gulf with wireless telegraphy is under consideration by the India Office, Admiralty, and Foreign Office. 6 . Bank at Baghdad. The Committee consider that the establishment of a British or British-Indian Bank at Baghdad would further British and Indian commercial interests. If at some future date it should appear that a temporary subvention (e.g., 1 , 000 /. per annum to repay office expenses) would induce some banking firm of standing to open a branch there, the possibility of giving such assistance might be worthy of consideration. 7. Railway Concessions in Persia. The policy of His Majesty’s Government is stated in detail in the Memorandum communicated to M. Isvolsky on the 14th October, 1908, in reply to the proposals of the Russian Government for a joint Anglo-Russian railway from the head of the Guli to the terminus at Julfa of the existing Russian line on the northern frontier of Persia. (See Appendix 11.) The proposals made to the Russian Government, it may be observed, will obviate the danger to British interests in India of the existence of a railway under foreign control in Southern Persia. 8 . Improvement in Trade Routes. There can be no doubt of the benefit to trade if security from robbers and blackmail could be established on the routes from Bunder Abbas and Bushire into the interior. Safety is of more importance than improvement of the existing tracks, though this also would be of material advantage. Proposals have been made from time to time on the subject, but no definite action has been taken. The cost is great, and the prospect indefinite of coming to a satisfactory arrangement with the Persian Government for providing efficient guards. The Committee recognize the importance of the subject, but do not see their way to making any recommendation 9. Bahrein. The evidence taken shows the growing importance of Bahrein as a trade centre. This may be attributed to the fact that the Sheikh has been rendered independent of the Turkish and Persian Governments by the action of His Majesty’s Government, who exercise a virtual Protectorate over the island. (a.) Assumption by British Government of Jurisdiction over Foreigners. It would strengthen our position in Bahrein and remove risks of interference by foreign Powers, other than Turkey or Persia, if the jurisdiction over foreigners in the island were placed in our hands. The Government of India should be instructed to approach the Sheikh with the object of inducing him to prefer a request to be relieved from the responsibility of exercising jurisdiction over foreigners. If this can be arranged, an Order in Council should be drawn up, the preamble of which should* recite the circumstances in which the transfer of jurisdiction has been effected. (b.) Protectorate. It does not seem expedient to make the Order hTCouncil as to foreign jurisdiction the medium of formally declaring a Protectorate. Persian and Turkish claims to sovereignty over the island have been repudiated by us in a form to preclude the [376] cX Re pout. necessity of any further discussion of the question with them. But neither Turkey nor Persia has formally abandoned its claims, and the Persian Government have not recognized, though we have consistently asserted, our right to protect Bahreinis in Persian territory. In the present political conditions of Turkey and Persia it is clear that we should scrupulously avoid any action that could be represented as an attempt to utilize their difficulties for selfish purposes. There is also the risk that the formal declaration of a Protectorate might be regarded as a challenge by other Powers than Persia and Turkey, who might raise the question of our rights in a provocative form. (c.) Customs Administration. It would accelerate the commercial development of Bahrein, and strengthen our political position there, if the Sheikh could be induced to place the administration of his customs under British control. But he has hitherto refused the proposals made him to this end, and it may prove that he may continue to refuse his consent, which would involve the surrender of a great measure of his independence, however advantageous our offer may be financially. Our terms, to be successful, will probably have to include something more than a guarantee of a minimum revenue based on present receipts. The Committee consider it important that no suitable opportunity of again approaching the Sheikh on the subject should be lost. (d.) Bank. Should the Indian Government be successful in their endeavours to give effect to the above proposals, the Committee are of opinion that it would be very desirable if some British-Indian bank of good standing would open a branch at Bahrein, with the object of forestalling the establishment of a foreign bank there. (e.) Harbour Accommodation. The landing facilities at Bahrein are at present primitive. With a view to their improvement, the Committee recommend that the Admiralty should be requested to arrange with the Indian Marine to carry out a survey of the harbour and to put forward detailed proposals for works to be carried out, with any suggestions which may occur to them as to how their cost may be met. (f.) Bearl Fisheries. The question whether action could be taken to prevent interference by foreigners with the pearl fisheries, of which Bahrein is the centre, was referred in 1905, on the initiative of the Government of India, to the Law Officers of the Crown, whose report, together with the indirect methods suggested by the Government of India for protecting the fisheries, is reproduced in Appendix 2, pages 168 to 173. The Committee do not see their way to make any precise recommendation on this very delicate question. The action to be taken, should occasion arise, must be decided with reference to the circumstances in which the fisheries are threatened bv “ inter lopers.” 10 . Koweit. As regards Koweit, a Secret Agreement was concluded with the Sheikh in October 1907, by which he granted us a perpetual lease of that portion of his foreshore near the town of Koweit which was considered likely to be required as the terminus of the Baghdad Railway when it reached the Gulf, as well as a right of pre-emption in regard to certain other territory on the coast-line, including the Island of Warba and its “ surrounding foreshore.” Inquiries are being made into the nature of the Sheikh’s claims to sovereignty oyer Warba and the adjacent coast. The rent paid for the lease is 4,00&lt;T. per annum, divided equally between the British and Indian Exchequers. As regards Bubiyan Island, there seems little doubt as to the validity of the Sheikh’s territorial rights ; but it was recently decided that no action should be taken for the present with a view to asserting his claims or to procuring the withdrawal by the Turks of the post established by them on the island in 1902.Report. Xi 11 . Muscat. Arms Traffic and Control of Customs. The attitude of the French Government at the Brussels Conference showed that they would be unwilling to agree to sign any Convention in connection with the proceedings of the Conference by which they would abandon the right secured to them by their Commercial Treaty with Muscat to import arms. But separate negotia tions have been opened with them for an Agreement by which, in return for the cession by Great Britain of the Crown Colony of the Gambia, they would, among other things, grant us a “ free hand ” in Muscat. In the absence of an Agreement with France, which would close the main source of supply, the situation created by the illicit landing of arms on the Persian coast between Bunder Abbas and Gwettur (Guattar) on the Indian border, whence they are conveyed into Afghanistan by armed gangs of Afghans, grows increasingly difficult. Fast year the Afghan gangs engaged in the trade took revenge for losses inflicted on them by attacking outlying stations of the Indo-European Telegraph Department’s Central Persian line. r lhis year it has been found necessary to order the telegraph stafl stationed at Dehaneh to be withdrawn temporarily to British territory, owing to the inability of the Persian Government to protect the post against Afghan attacks, and the impossibility, in existing circumstances, of posting Indian levies in Persian territory for the defence of the line. It is doubtful whether, without co-operation by land, an effective naval blockade could be enforced ; and the cost of the attempt to establish one is considered by the Government of India to be prohibitive. The decision arrived at, to do no more during the present gun-running season (which will extend till the summer) than continue the patiol of the coast with the existing naval establishment, seems to the Sub-Committee all that can be done for the present. 12 . Financial Considerations. The abo\ e recommendations and indications of policy involve heaw expenditure, and the question of finding the requisite money must necessarily raise difficulties. The Committee, while recognizing that both from an Imperial and an Indian point of view it would be inequitable to expect that either the British Government or the Government of India should be called upon to meet the whole expenditure entailed by the realization of these proposals; and, reserving the question of any contribution from Indian revenues, are of opinion that, if the justice of such a contribution be established in princ iple, the pioportions of Imperial and Indian contributions should be considered on the merits and as each occasion arises.

[376] B9 First Meeting, 2nd March, 1908. Sir Richmond T. W. Ritchie, K.C.B., Political and Secret Secretary, India Office, attended as a witness and was examined. Evidence of Sir R. T. W. Ritchie, K.C.B. 1. Mr. Morley : The first proposal that is before ns is a proposal in relation to Muscat—to reorganize the Customs. Sir R. Ritchie : Yes. 2. Sir E. Grey : What will be the method of carrying that out ? It will be done by instruction to our Resident in Muscat, and finally arranged with the Sultan, I take it? Sir R. Ritchie : Yes. 3. Sir E. Grey : Which will be settled by the Indian Government? Sir R. Ritchie : Yes. Mr. Morley : I should like to say now on this point that, while it is quite true — the existing relations between the Indian Government and Persia being what they are — that that would be the natural reply, I have a long time had in my mind the subject of the present relations between the Indian Government and the whole group of Persian questions. I only say that as a sort of caveat now, because it is my strong view, if my views prevail, that that and Persian questions generally will be much more effectivelv dealt with by you than by us. 4. Sir E. Grey: Muscat is more exclusively Indian than Persian, and the Indian Government has dealt more exclusively with Muscat than it has even with Persian questions. Sir R. Ritchie : That is so. Sm E Grey: Of course it does not interfere with the independence of the oultan of Muscat that we should get a British official, or that the Indian Government should get a British official, into the Customs, any more than M. Nans being appointed by the Belgian Government interfered with the independence of Persia. 5. Sir C. Hardin ge : If we might pass on to the Musandim Promontory, which is part of Muscat, I have got a suggestion which I think might possibly assist that very end. One of the proposals is that there should be a lighthouse built on one of the islands. That was recommended by the Government of India in 1904, but it has remained in abeyance since. I he question is: If that lighthouse were built, who would build it? We might get the Sultan of Muscat, as the Sovereign of the peninsula, to build the lighthouse. We could advance him the money to do it with, and we could appoint a Receiver at Muscat who would receive, we will say, the light house dues from every ship that was going into the Gulf or coming from the Gulf. ^ In that way we might gradually get control of the Customs. I would venture to put that forward as a suggestion. Mr. Morley : On p. 137 Y ' the lighthouse is recommended from the mercantile or marine point of view as well as from the political point of view, and to that is added a suggestion of a wireless telegraph establishment. So, besides the nautical and political reasons, there would be the Customs reason and the wireless telegraph reason. 1 i^ir E. (&lt;rey: Supposing we establish a lighthouse on this peninsula, you cannot enforce the payment of dues upon foreign vessels. Sir 0. Hardinge : From Muscat I think you could. You see, it would be on Muscat territory. gSiR E. Grey: You cannot enforce lighthouse dues on ships unless they go into territorial waters, I imagine ; can you ? * Appendix 2.Evidence of Sir R. T. W. Ritchie. 3 Mr. Lloyd-George : ]S T o. How could you ? Cartain Slade : But you could if they were going into Muscat. Sir C. Hardinge : That is what I meant. Mr. Lloyd-George : If they call there you could, certainly. Sir E. Grey : Yes, if they were to call at Muscat. But then Musandim is a Jong way from Muscat. Take all tlie German ships going into the Persian Gulf; what about those ? Sir 0. Hardinge : They will nearly all go to Muscat. Mr. Lloyd-George : A similar question has been before the Advisory Committee on new Lighthouse works. TJie sliip-owners were against it Ijecause they thought the cost would fall on the General Lighthouse Fund. If there are any means of collecting the dues on the spot it would be a different matter, and they would not mind it. Sir E. Grey : The dues would have to be collected at Muscat, the point of call before they got down the coast. Mr. Morley : I do not still quite see who is to make the lighthouse, and who is to collect the dues. Sir C. Hardinge : We could advance the money to the Sultan of Muscat to build the lighthouse. Mr. Morley : And he is to do it nominally P Sir C. Hardinge : He is to do it as the Sovereign, and we should have a Receiver in Muscat to collect the dues. Sir E. Grey : Suppose the dues do not cover the cost of the lighthouse and the interest on the money advanced Mr. Lloyd-George : Which they would not. Mr. Morley : Therefore this is the first proposal—there would be various others, including a possible subsidy to the Persian Gulf English Combine, but this is the first proposal, and it means cash out of pocket. Sir E. Grey : You will find subsidy at the bottom of every one of these things. Mr Morley : That is what I want to point out. Mr. Lloyd-George : That is exactly what the ship-owners say : “ We do not mind if the Imperial Government have as many lights as they like; you can light the coast as you would the Strand as long as it does not come out of our pockets.” That is the line they take. Sir R. Ritchie : There is one point about collecting lighthouse dues at Muscat. The one thing we are afraid of is anything like international control at Muscat. At present we have got at Muscat ourselves and the French, who are bad enough; but I take it the collection of dues might lead to a claim by Germany or anybody else to have a Representative. Mr. Morley : International control would be one of the things we should have to guard against. There are international pretensions which may become, it seems to me, reading the papers very carefully, much more active than they now are. If any body chose to challenge our case as stated by Lord Lansdowne and by Sir Edward Grey, it occurs to me, on reading those papers, that if it is challenged from an inter national jurisprudential point of view, it is not a very strong case. It is very strong from the point of view of civilization and the slave trade and all that, but if the Germans choose to fight it, it seems to me there is a great deal to be said, and that our position is rather weak in fact.4 First Meeting, 2nd March, 1908. * See Appendix 6, p. 218. f Appendix 2. See, however. Appendix 3, Part I, p. 199. G. Sir E. Grey : The fact is our case would disappear altogether if we lost our commercial supremacy in the Gulf. It is really based on our dc facto commercial interests ; if they go, all the past would go with them. Meanwhile, however, we may pass the disagreeable prospect of international control—I mean for to-day at the opening of our inquiry. Is there anything more to say about Muscat ? Sir R. Ritchie : I do not think so. Sir E. Grey : The question of the lighthouse you will have to reserve till you have settled the question of whether we are prepared for a policy of subsidies in the Gulf. Mr. Morley : I think if we went round the Gulf and saw in the case of other place —Bahrein, &amp;c.—what liabilities it may be wise for us to undertake, we then could come back again and say, “ Do this or that.” Mr. Lloyd-George : What does a subsidy mean there—about 10,000k or 12,000k for the lighthouse ? Sir E. Grey : Would it be as much as that ? Mr. Lloyd-George : It would be a very expensive job to put it up to begin with.* Sir E. Grey : We can put up a very cheap lighthouse. General Nicholson : Could you have an iron or a steel one ? Captain Slade : It will be a mistake if you make it of steel. It is a frightful climate. We have had to withdraw our telegraph station from that very place on account of the temperature. Mr. Lloyd-George : It will be a constant expense if you put up a cheap thing. Captain Slade : Yes, it will. Mr. Lloyd-George : A lighthouse here would cost about 20,000k Captain Slade : I should think it would. Sir C. Hardinge : It would be a big political advantage to have a lighthouse there, because it would, in a sort of way, establish our right upon that promontory against anybody else’s right if they tried to encroach. That would be an additional advantage. Mr. Lloyd-George : Supposing the Indian Government were to contribute a part, then I think we could approach the General Lighthouse Fund for the other part. Mr. Morley : They will contribute half on the day when I am persuaded—that is, so long as I have anything to do with the Indian Government—that the Indian tax-payer has any particular interest in a lighthouse at Musandim. That is a further point. Mr. Lloy^d-George : Or in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Morley : True. I am most sceptical up to this point, but still I am open to conviction. Sir R. Ritchie : There is one further point I should like to mention about Muscat which does not appear in this Memorandum^—it is now the centre of the arms importation. At the forthcoming Brussels Conference we are trying to get the Powers— I ranee, the United States, and Holland—who have got Treaties which give them the right of dealing in arms to waive their right. If we succeed, then we shall get the Sultan to consent to prohibit the import of arms, and if he does that, he will have to be compensated to the tune of some 12 , 000 k a year on that one item. 7. Mr. Morley : How does he earn the 12,000k a-year ?Evidence of Sm R. T. Ritchie. 5 Sir R. Ritchie : By charging 5 per cent, on all arms which come into his port. Of course the question is to find that 12,000Z. a-year, and whether that would not also give an opportunity for international control. Mr. Lloyd-Georoe : The lighthouse would mean about 4,000L or 5,000L a-year . 0 Captain Slade : About that, I should think. 8 . Mr. Morley : How would international control come in here ? Sir R. Ritchie : Any Power who contributes to that sum of 12,000L may choose to claim a right to exercise supervision over the trade in arms which may always go on at Muscat under illicit conditions. Of course the Sultan would be alkrwed to import arms for his own legitimate purposes. 9. Mr. Morley : The Memorandum on the arms traffic is not here yet, is it ? Sir R. Ritchie : No. 10. Mr. Morley : It is very important, but we shall have it by and by ? f Sir R. Ritchie : Yes. 11. Sir E. Grey : I do not see how you are to keep international control out of Muscat in one way or another ? Sir R. Ritchie : The procedure about arms is to have a bonded warehouse at Muscat, and nothing goes into that bonded warehouse except under proper licenses and so forth, and nothing comes out except under proper licenses. That is a difficult job from the administrative point of view. The French have failed entirely to carry it out at Djiboutil, and the Sultan will not be able to carry it out unless he is very well advised and has a capable administrator. Of course the Government of India would like that administrator and that advice to be exclusively British. 12. Mr. Morley : A corresponding difficulty will confront us in the other places too. Sir R. Ritchie : Not over arms, because they have no vested rights in the arms traffic. The Sultan of Muscat is the only person who has a vested right in that. 13. Mr. Morley : I do not think I understand quite what the vested right arises from, or who vested it. Sir R. Ritchie : Under commercial treaties with Muscat, France, the United States, and Holland, have the right to import arms, and the Sultan has taken all the arms which those countries and others, including Great Britain, have been good enough to export to him ever since the traffic began. He is an independent Sovereign, and he can refuse, at his risks, to agree to prohibit this very lucrative traffic ; but he may say, “ You ask me to give up 12,0001. a-year because of your humanitarian objections to arms, and I am an independent Sovereign guaranteed by France and yourselves.” 14. Sir E. Grey : I do not see how we can avoid that. We cannot help joiniug in suggestions to stop the arms traffic there. Sir R. Ritchie : The only thing is to pay up ourselves. 15. Sir E. Grey : To pay the whole thing ? Sir R. Ritchie : Yes. Mr. Morley : Well, we are getting on ! 16. Sir E. Grey : Meanwhile, there is no objection, I imagine, to the Indian Government taking steps to try and get an Indian Customs official put into the position of head of the Customs at Muscat ? Sir R. Ritchie : That is so. * See Appendix 6, p. 218. | Appendix 3, p. 199. [3761 C6 First Meeting, 2nd March, 1908. 17. Sir E. Grey : That does not involve a subsidy? Sir R, Ritchie: The only thing to be careful about is that we must not do anything to which the drench would object. Of course things were not easy with 1 ranee at one time, and Lord Lansdowne was apprehensive upon that point. General Nicholson : Does importing arms do any harm to anybody ? Sir E. Grey : These arms have found their way to other places. IS. Mr. Morley : \Y here is the reference to Lord Lansdowne’s apprehensions ? Sir R. Ritchie: Page 134. # He says there, in reference to any considerable change in the administration of Muscat, that nothing should be done to offend the r rench. 19. Sir E. Grey : Put this is not really a great change in the internal administration of Muscat; it is merely appointing a Customs official, who is appointed by the Sultan ? Sir R. Ritchie : That is so. 20. Sir E. Hrey : And he is under the Sultan ? Sir R. Ritchie : Yes. Put then the difficulty arises, whose advice is the Sultan to take m dealing with the Pritish Administrator of his Customs—the advice of the French or of the Pritish Consul ? 21 . Mr. Lloyd-George : And whether the Administrator is to be Pritish or t rench ? Sir R. Ritchie : Ex hypothesi, he is to be a Pritish Administrator. 22. Mr. Lloyd-George ^ Put then the French surely would have something to say to that—if they have any feeling about it all, 1 mean ? Sir R. Ritchie : I do not think we know now that the French have any feeliim- m the matter. We have settled the flag question. Sir E. Grey : The French would give way about that now. The Muscat relations are very different now. 2o. Mr. Morley : Put I think the French still keep up a day-to-day controversy about the dhows and their flags ? Sir R. Ritchie : That is now settled. It has been agreed between the two Consuls that there shall be 19 I rench flag-holders owning 24 dhows. 24. Mr. Morley : It seems that the French flag will soon disappear ? Sir R. Ritchie : Those will die out. 2o. Sir E. Grey : If the Sultan appoints a Pritish official as head of his Customs, and_ there are difficulties, of course that Pritish official would go to the Pritish Resident ? Sir R. Ritchie : Yes. 2b. Sir E. Grey : And not to the French Resident ? Sir R.^ Ritchie : Put simultaneously the French Consul may go to the Sultan and say : “Look ^here ; you beware of that. You were very foolish to accept that Pritish Administrator.” That is the way the difficulty arose on the flag question. Our Consul did something perfectly reasonable about the flags, and the Frenchman went off and inflamed the Sultan’s mind. Sir E. Grey: I do not think that would happen now. I do not see why that arrangement should not be proposed to the Sultan of Muscat, that he should appoint a Pritish official. * * ippendix 2.* Appendix 2. Evidence of Sir R. T. Ritchie. Mr. Morley : We will take a note that that is your view. Sir E. Grey : That does not involve a subsidy. 27. Mr. Lloyd-George : He will not do it without a subsidy. Sir R. Ritchie : You will have to guarantee him a sum. 28. Sir E. Grey : We shall have to guarantee him what ? Sir R. Ritchie : We shall have to guarantee him a minimum annual income. 29. Sir E. Grey : That would come out of the customs revenues of Muscat. Sir R. Ritchie : We would have to make a bargain acceptable to the Sultan, and it may be a losing bargain to us. The Saltan hates giving up his customs. 30. Sir E. Grey : But is he to give up his customs ? I should have thought the British official would simply collect them for him and pay them into the Treasury, like M. Naus did with Persia. Sir R. Ritchie : It would be a regular administration under rules which cannot be varied. At present the beauty of the system, I take it, is that the Sultan, when he is hard up, gets an advance from the customs farmer. If it is under British control, it will be a regular system, and he will receive so much a month—nothing more and nothing less. Mr Morley : Like the Public Trustee instead of the family trustees—very rigid and uncomfortable. Sir R. Ritchie : He will not like the idea. Sir E. Grev : I do not know why that should be. Why should not the British official have a fixed salary of his own, and simply be the man who superintends the Customs Service, and pays everything that is collected in the way of customs dues into the Muscat Treasury ? Mr. Lloyd-George : What does the Sultan get out of it ? What is the induce ment to him to enter into it ? Sir E. Grey : He, being an absolute despot, I take it, gets the whole of the customs dues. Mr. Lloyd-George : He can do that now, without introducing a foreigner into his dominions to collect the customs for him. 31. Sir E. Grey : They would be better collected. That is what always happens, and that is why the Persians took M. Naus. Sir R. Ritchie : I doubt if the better collection would be an inducement to the Sultan. Mr. Lloyd-George : If he sees any money in it he will do it probably. General Nicholson : He will get a good deal of money out of it, and it says on p. 131 of the Memorandum'^' that he is dissatisfied with his own administration of the customs. Sir E. Grey : Why the Belgians came into the Persian Customs and why the Chinese established the Hart system in China was in order to get more money out of the customs. Mr. Lloyd-George : But there was some pressure put upon the Chinese, was there not ? Sir E. Grey : Not in the case of Hart. When that system was established there was no pressure. Sir C. Hardinge : That is so.8 First Meeting, 2nd March, 1908. Sir E. Grey : There were no loans, so that at that time the Chinese did it for themselves. . Morley : However, yon are in favour here of our taking over the adminis tration of the customs ? Sir E. Grey : It seems to me it would be a good thing, because if there is to be mtei national control creeping about these things, the sooner we get our foot in the better. Mr. Morley : Your view would wholly depend upon what views we took about other things ? Sir E. Grey : Yes. Mr. Morley : It is a general policy for the Gulf that we must get our foot in wherever we can ? Sir E. Grey : Yes. 32 Mr. Morley : There are other proposals on p. 135* about flagstaffs and so on, ana t think, fcur Kichmond, you have considered them in the light of our Indian experience. Sir R. Ritchie : We practically admit Musandim to he Muscat territory, and the at \antage of hoisting the British flag on Muscat territory remains to be seen. Mr. Morley : What is the advantage ? r - S i IR ?' ^ RE)IX 1 GE tliere were a lighthouse the flags would not be necessary. 1 think the Admiralty demurred to the flagstatfs. Sir E. Grey : They mean nothing. They are not a vested interest, and thev simply are provocative. Mr. Morley : Unless they are accompanied, as is said on p. 136*, by a declaration of rrotectorate ? 3-;. Sir E. Grey : Yes ; but that declaration of Muscat. you cannot make because it is part Sir R. Ritchie : It is now admitted to be Muscat territory. 34. Sir E. Grey : What we have got about Muscat is the promise that the Sultan will not cede to anybody else ? Sir R. Ritchie : Yes. Sir E. Grey : I do not know that we want very much more about Muscat, do we ? Mr. Morley : No. Captain Slade : If we had the lighthouse that would settle the question as far as Musandim is concerned. ^ uo Sir E Grey: We shall have to consider that when we come to consider the question of the subsidies, as it is quite clear it would involve subsidies. We have first to consider whether we will give subsidies, and then what are the points of actual danger. Ihe Indian Government in 1901 said that this position would be less suitable for our ultimate naval station at the mouth of the Gulf, if we were to have a naval station at the mouth of the Gulf. But I take it that is quite out of the question, and it is not a case that is probable. ^ Captain Slade : Not at all probable. Sir E. Grey : We should never want to establish a naval station there ourselves and the prospect of anybody else establishing a naval station is very remote. * Appendix 2.Evidence of Sir R. T. Ritchie. 9 Captain Slade : I should think so. The only one there was any question about at all was Russia ; but that has gone into the background entirely. At any rate, I do not think there was ever any question of our going to Mnsandim. 35. Sir E. Grey : Our arrangement with the Sultan, I think, is that he is not to alienate Musandim without our consent; so that, even apart from the protection of the climate against anybody else establishing a naval station, we have got the protection of an Agreement with the Sultan of Unseat that he cannot alienate. Sir R. Ritchie : Yes. Sir E. Grey : I do not really see that we want so very much more. The lighthouse would be an excellent thing from the commercial point of view, as increasing our vested commercial interests. Sir C. Hardinge : And I suppose a wireless telegraph station would be a good thing from a naval point of view ? Captain Slade : I am a little doubtful about that; a wireless telegraph station would not be very much good. If we are going to put up a wireless telegraph station anywhere, it ought to be put up at Henjam, because you naturally want to have your station where you can get your telegrams off the wire. Sir E Grey : That is on the other side of the Gulf? Captain Slade : Yes. 36. Mr. Morley : Now we had better go on to Bahrein. Sir R. Ritchie : The Memorandum deals with the question of the trucial chiefs,* but I do not think there is anything to be said. 37. Mr. Morley : Will you tell me now, as shortly as ever you like, what our status in regard to Bahrein is. Sir R. Ritchie : It is governed by the undertaking of the Sheikh not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with any Power other than the British Government; that without the assent of the British Government he will not consent to a resident agent of any other Government; and, further, he will not cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise grant the occupation of any part of his territory save to the British Government. 38. Mr. Morley : Do those three provisions constitute a Protectorate or a quasi- Protectorate ? Sir R. Ritchie : It is a quasi-Protectorate; but what are the exact steps which would turn a quasi-Protectorate into a Protectorate is, I take it, a very open question. 39. Mr. Morley : That position of ours has been challenged by the Turk and the Persian ? Sir R. Ritchie : It has been challenged by the Turk and the Persian, each of them, an innumerable number of times, and we have absolutely refused to listen to either. The only point where the Turk and the Persian have a look-in is when we come to claim to protect Bahreinese subjects on a portion of Turkish or Persian territory. Then they refuse to entertain our claim. 40. Mr. Lloyd-George : Do we interfere at all in the administration of the island ? Sir R. Ritchie : Yes. There was a great row there a little time ago, when Persian subjects and German subjects were assaulted. We walked in and restored law and order. 41. Mr. Lloyd-George : Did the Germans protest at all ? Sir R. Ritchie : No, they did not. [376] * Appendix 2, Part II, {b), p. 137. D10 First Meeting, 2nd March, 1908. * Appendix 2 42. Mr. Lloyd-George : They accepted it ? Sir R. Ritchie : Yes, and the Persians invoked our assistance. Sir C. IIardinge : And, moreover, in 1895 we turned out a Turkish post from a place called Zabora, on the main coast, because they were hostile to Bahrein. Mr. Lloyd-George : That looks like effective jurisdiction. 43. Mr. Morley : 1 observe that on p. 146 of the Memorandum^' it is suggested that it is very desirable there should be a closer customs control, and that the customs question has an important relation to the arms traffic. Is this the same case as Muscat over again ? Sir R. Ritchie : No ; Bahrein is only a place of call for ships carrying arms. A certain amount may go from there to the Persian or Turkish mainland by dhows, but it is not a distributing centre. Muscat is the distributing centre. 44. Mr. Morley : The idea is, though it is now only a house of call, you might gradually make it what they term a trade emporium and an open market ? Sir R. Ritchie : Yes. 45. Mr. Morley : Is there a good foundation for any hope of that sort ? Does the trade there increase, do you happen to know ? Sir R. Ritchie : It is an important place and wealthy in itself, because of the pearl traffic. Sir C. Hardinge : In 1906 the British vessels represented 100,000 tons, the American 3,900 tons, and the German 6,000 tons. Mr. Lloyd-George : I see the trade increased between 1905 and 1906 ; but there do not seem to be any figures covering any length of time which would really enable us to judge. Merely taking two years like that, I think, is not conclusive. 46. Mr. Morley : There are three proposals : first, customs and a British official, and, secondly, opening a bank at Bahrein. Could not the Imperial Bank of Persia operate there ? Sir R. Ritchie : No. I believe its charter limits it to Persia. Mr. Morley : r J hen, again, there is wireless telegraphy. 47. Sm E. Grey: The important point is the protection. That is the proposal of the Government of India now, which they have raised to establish jurisdiction over foreigners in Bahrein, on the ground that it is a Protectorate. That would hardly involve a subsidy. Mr. Morley : No. We have claimed, as I understand, for a long time, the right to follow Bahreinese into Turkey. If a Bahreinese man gets into a difficulty in Turkey we claim the right to look after him. Sir E. Grey : You give him British Consular protection ? Sir R. Ritchie : The main point about Bahrein is that raised in the Govern- ment of India’s letter quoted in the Memorandum, namely, whether we are to take definite steps to proclaim a Protectorate to the whole world ? *G Haudinge : Does not the Indian Government propose that we should do it effectively but without proclaiming it? Is that not the proposal that was made a little while ago by the Government of India ? . n ^ IR K |TCHIE : The Government of India’s proposal is that by an Order m Council we should assume jurisdiction over foreigners. If we pass an Order in Council to that effect we must, I take it, make a communication to the foreigners concerned. 49. Sir E. Grey : Did we not issue some statement some time ago about the places which were under our protection ?Evidence of Sir R. T. Ritchie. 11 Sir C. Hardinge : Yes, we did, to some people ; but not to everybody. Sir E. Grey : Was Bahrein included ? Sir C. Hardinge : No. Sir R. Ritchie : As an afterthought, it was decided not to communicate the statement to Germany. Sir E. Grky : That notification having been made some time ago, it is a mere question of making it altogether public ; but that does not help us with Bahrein. We should have to consider on what we should base our rights, supposing we do pass an Order in Council exercising jurisdiction over the foreigners. 50. Mr. Morley : What would be the precise gain ? I never understood from the Government of India that they showed what the precise gain would be. What do you say, Sir Richmond ? Sir R. Ritchie : I think it would obviously be of great advantage. At present in every step we take at Bahrein we are haunted by the dread: What will Turkey sayV what will Persia say ? and Germany ? what will Mr. Wonckhaus say ? and what will the pearl-dealers say ? They all have the right of direct access to the Sheikh to get him to settle their difficulties, and our Political Officer does not always necessarily know what passes between the Sheikh and these foreigners. He has to find out before he can give effective advice to the Sheikh—that is, effective in the sense of British interests. Mr. Lloyd-George : This question of Bahrein and the other questions are part of the much bigger question of the control over the Persian Gulf as a whole. Mr. Morley : Yes, but you cannot consider the Gulf as a whole unless you have examined your control over the details. Mr. Lloyd-George : I put it the other way as well ; I think that is equally true. Details are, after all, details ; the other is the real principle. Mr. Morley : What is the principle ? Mr. Lloyd-George : Whether it is worth our while to establish some sort of control over the Persian Gulf in order to maintain the commercial supremacy, to begin with, which we have got there—and the political supremacy, of course. Mr. Morley : Surely we cannot discuss that scientifically until we know what control over the Persian Gulf involves? Take Bahrein, for example. It is quite true, as Sir Richmond says, that our Consul would be a more effective man if we issued our Order in Council; but what occurs to me is: What would Mr. Wonckhaus and the Persian and the Turk, and perhaps the German (who is a person we have got to think of), say ? I do not see, I submit, how we can talk at large about our control over the Gulf till we have looked a little into details. It is extremely tedious, but I think it is inevitable. Mr Lloyd-George : I should say it is not at all tedious. I think it is very interesting. Mr. Morley : Of course it is for the Sub-Committee to say whether the plan I suggest of going round these tiresome places is a good plan. Mr. Lloyd-George : I think you have got to do so. I think you have mistaken my point. It was rather in reference to the question which you put as to what we gain. That is the only reason why I put it. What we gain in Bahrein itself by establishing a Protectorate, I think, has reference rather to the question of our policy in the Gulf as a whole. Mr. Morley : True; but I am keeping my eye on the particular point of Bahrein. Here is the Government of India making a proposal; what is the precise gain that the Government of India hope to get ? That is my point now. What you say is, of course, the right way of looking at it, in time. Mr. Lloyd-George: That is so. I was not protesting against examining these things in detail.12 First Meeting, 2nd March, 1908. * Appendix 2. Mr. Morley : Is it not a question of arrangement with the local Sheikh, very largely ? If you bind him over, I do not see how any one else can protest. 51. Sir E. Grey : A Protectorate is not quite that. The question of a Pro tectorate is rather a question of exercising jurisdiction over other foreigners in Bahrein. Does the Sheikh attempt to exercise jurisdiction over them himself now? Sir R. Ritchie : Y es. The Government of India say there is a Court composed of a representative of the Sheikh and the Political Agent, which exercises jurisdiction over foreigners. 52. Sir E. Grey : But not over British ? Sir R. Ritchie : l T es, over British. But we have not got an Order in Council. 53. Sir E. Grey : The British Political Agent? Sir R. Ritchie : There is no other Political Agent, and he may not receive another Political Agent. Sir E. Grey : He is bound not to permit other Powers to establish Diplomatic or Consular Agencies without our consent. That is a real Treaty right we have with him. You will find that on p. 145.° In 1880, by Treaty, published for public in formation—so that Treaty is public—the Sheikh bound himself to abstain from making any Treaty of any sort with any State or Government other than the British. That, you know, is a virtual Protectorate. 54. Lord Esher : You see, on p. 146,* the British Agent has exercised important judicial powers in the island. What does that mean ? Sir R. Ritchie : Powers given him by the Sheikh. 55. Lord Esher : Does that mean over foreigners ? Sir R. Ritchie : Yes. In the Sheikh’s Court, under the control of the Political Agent. Mr. Morley : The President of the Board of Trade has asked about the increase in the trade. I have had some figures handed to me. The total exports of Bahrein in 1902 came to 736,000b ; in 1903 to 8 ^5,000b ; in 1904 to 901,000b ; and in 1905 to 1,363,000b ; so that it was almost doubled. Then the imports in 1902 were 888,000b ; in 1903 1,027,000b ; in 1904 992,000b ; and in 1905 1,620,000b ; so that the imports were doubled. Mr. Lloyd-George : Those are very important figures, I think. Sir C. Ottley : Those figures are taken from the Consular Reports. Mr. Lloyd-George : It is evidently a very important station from a commercial point of view, as it is growing in importance. Mr. Morley : Certainly. 56. Sir E. Grey : The point is, Have we got a case for establishing jurisdiction over foreigners ? Sir C. PIardinge : I think we have. Sir R. Ritchie : In the Persian Gulf the Order in Council runs : “ Whereas His Majesty, by Treaty, usage,” and so forth, has jurisdiction over British subjects; and it adds, over foreigners in cases where there are Agreements to that effect with the foreign Governments concerned. 57. Sir E. Grey : We have got no Agreement with them about Bahrein, have we ? Sir R. Ritchie : No. If we extend it by Order in Council to foreigners in Bahrein, one practical difficulty is, How will you word your Order ?Evidence of Sir R. T. Ritchie. 13 58. Sir E. Grey : It would bring it into sharp contrast with your own original position. Sir R. Ritchie : “ Usage, Treaty, or otherwise ” is the usual formula by which we state we have rights of foreign jurisdiction. You will have to invent a formula by which you can state that by usage, Treaty, or otherwise you have a right of jurisdiction over foreigners in Bahrein. 59. Sir E. Grey : The Sheikh would exercise it himself at present. Sir R. Ritchie : l r es. CO. Sir E. Grey : Then you really want a new Agreement with the Sheikh to base it. Mr. Lloyd-George : That is what I suggested. I think we have got to square your Sheikh first of all. Sir R. Ritchie : Have you to consult the person whom you protect before you declare that you protect him ? Gl. Sir E. Grey : No ; but this is a limitation of the Sheikh’s jurisdiction. Sir R. Ritchie : Yes, it is. G2. Sir E. Grey : Which the Sheikh now exercises. I should say, after all we have done in Bahrein, and with this Treaty which we have with him which does not allow other Powers to establish Diplomatic or Consular Agencies, which is a Treaty twenty-eight years old (so it is an old-established one), it would follow that so far as foreigners are concerned, they could never establish jurisdiction over their own subjects, and therefore they ought not to object to our exercising jurisdiction in Bahrein; but then the Sheikh seems to me to be in a position to say he does not want to give up his j urisdiction. Sir R. Ritchie : I take it that the Sheikh would be a less difficulty than the intimation to the foreign Powers, and that till an intimation is made to the foreign Powers we have not really got a Protectorate in the sense that we desire a Protectorate, that is to say, the first thing we do may be challenged. Are we to be in the position, if we are challenged, to say, we have done this because of the Protectorate which we informed you we were exercising; or are we to wait until we are challenged and then say, Ob ! yes, but we have a Protectorate ? G3. Mr. Lloyd-George : If we square the Sheikh first, surely that would strengthen onr position when intimating to the foreign Powers what we have done ? Sir R. Ritchie : Yes ; and I think throughout it is assumed that there will be no difficulty in squaring the Sheikh. 64. Sir E. Grey : I think it is rather a provocative business to send a Circular to other Powers saying we have got a Protectorate over Bahrein. They will think, why did you not tell us before ? We should base it on this Treaty of 1880, I assume ? Sir R. Ritchie : Yes ; and there is also the Treaty of 1892. Sir E. Grey : Then they would say, “ Why have you, d propos of nothing, suddenly told us you have got a Protectorate over Bahrein, which you say you have had for twenty-eight years ? ” Is it not better surely to let that point come up by their challenging something which we have done, and then our saying, “ This Treaty has been in existence for twenty-eight years, and it has been known to everybody, and we cannot possibly think of discussing it ? ” Sir C. Hardinge : On p. 143' :i: ' there is a point. The French, apparently, to a certain extent, have recognized our rights in Bahrein. Sir E. Grey : They suggested that it should be under the jurisdiction of the French Vice-Consul at Bushire, and the Government of India were of opinion that the best solution was to drop the question, and that seems to have been done. [37(5] * Appendix 2. E14 First Meeting, 2nd March, 1008. Mr. Morley : In talking of Bahrein, must yon not take into consideration that very disagreeable controversy about the pearling fisheries ? Sir C. Hardinge : Yes. 05. Mr. Morley : The more I think about that, the more difficult and dangerous does it look. It would be in connection, would it not, with the pearling fisheries that it would be likely that a foreign Power would challenge our position in Bahrein ? Sir R. Ritchie : Yes. 66. Sir E. Grey : The pearl fisheries in territorial waters belong to the Sheikh do they not ? Sir R. Ritchie : Yes. Sir E. Grey : And as regards the non-territorial waters, the Protectorate would not affect it. Mr. Morley : I do not know whether you have had time to read the long passage about the pearl fisheries ? 67. Sir E. Grey : How the pearl fisheries far out at sea, outside the terri torial waters, may affect those in the torritorial waters ? On the point of the Protectorate I do not see how that could come in, because we should have to agree that the pearl fisheries outside territorial waters would not be affected by the Protectorate, and that they must be a matter of international agreement. Inside territorial waters they would not be affected by the Protectorate, because they belong entirely to the Sheikh. ^ The only bearing I see that that could have on the Protectorate would be that there being pearl fisheries, the Germans or others might want to come and engage in the pearl fisheries in territorial waters, and that would bring a good many foreigners there. But I do not think the Sheikh would allow them in territorial waters ; he would keep the pearls for his own people. Sir R. Ritchie: l hat is so ; but it would be very much easier to deal with the question of an interloper if it was recognized universally that we had a Protectorate and a right of action in the Sheikh’s interest. Sir E. Grey : It does seem to me rather that if we arrange with the Sheikh we could go on with the jurisdiction over foreigners ; and then if they challenge it we can say, This Treaty of 1880 gives us the power; it obviously follows from the 'Treaty of 1880, and we have always regarded ourselves as having a Protectorate since 1880 hereas if you take as your first step the announcement to foreign Powers that we have got a Protectorate, they will say, \\ hy do you make the announcement now if it really dates back to 1880 ? Then we shall be engaged in a controversy which we'shall have opened with them, instead of their opening with us. 68. Mr. Morley : Is it likely to come up at all in connection with Abu Musa ? Sm R. Ritchie : Xo ; that is in a different jurisdiction altogether. But, Sir Edward, if we have our Order in Council which gives us jurisdiction over foreioners when the question arises of an interloper in the pearl fisheries in territorial waters^ will our Order in Council strengthen us in dealing with the other case ? Will not the foreign lowei sa\ : we accepted that Order in Council because it was strictly limited in scope, and we did not challenge your action in that respect. 69. Sir E Grey : You would have to issue your Order in Council, and that would have to be based upon the fact that Bahrein was a British Protectorate. Sir R. Ritchie : Yes. 70. Sir C. Hardinge : You think it would not be difficult to come to terms with the Sheikh ? Sir R. Ritchie : It is assumed so, but if the Sheikh is recalcitrant /l. Sir C. Hardinge : I think that is the whole crux of the question. Sir R. Ritchie: The Sheikh has been persistently recalcitrant about the customs.Evidence of Sir R. T. Ritchie. 15 * Appendix 2. Mr. Morley : The President of the Board of Trade said we should square him. Mr. Lloyd-George : Yes. Mr. Morley : May we ask what you exactly mean ? Mr. Lloyd-George: I mean what you put down here. You will take over the Customs, and you will guarantee him a subsidy. It is all down here on p. 146.* You take the risk of collecting it yourselves, but you guarantee to him a certain sum a-year. That is what I call squaring the Sheikh. Sir R. Ritchie : He has been offered that, and he will not look at it. Mr. Lloyd-George : That depends on the amount. I think it is only a question of what you guarantee him. I agree with Sir Charles that it is very largely a question of squaring this gentleman to begin with. 72. Lord Esher : What is the quid pro quo that you can give to him ? Mr. Morley : Cash ? Sir R. Ritchie : Cash. Lord Esher : You come back to that. Sir E. Grey : Yes ; it is the usual one. Mr. Morlet : The squaring of the Sheikh will not get us out of the Order in Council. Are we going to propose that or not? 73. Mr Lloyd-George : Supposing this gentleman goes and appeals to the Powers ? Sir R. Ritchie : He is precluded by this Treaty from doing that. 74. Mr. Morley: He cannot do it? Sir R, Ritchie: He cannot enter into any correspondence with any Power. We send a gun-boat if he does. Mr. Lloyd-George : But he has got ways of doing it, I have no doubt. 75. Sir E. Grey : He cannot enter into any correspondence with them, you say ; it is as much as that, is it ? Sir R. Ritchie : Yes. Mr. Morley : It is the regular three-sided thing we have in Afghanistan, and so on. General Xicholson : Could he not delegate all his judicial powers to the British Resident without any Order in Council, and could not that British Resident or Political Officer exercise those powers without any further trouble in the matter ? Mr. Lloyd-George : Will he do it, unless there is some sort of inducement offered him ? Sir E. Grey : You come to the same thing, that is, whether you should not tell the Indian Government that they have got to work through the Sheikh of Bahrein. Could w r e agree to their making any arrangement of the kind with the Sheikh of Bahrein ? There must be some arrangement wdth him first before we can assume jurisdiction over foreigners, and in the event of our having an arrangement with him we could then publish the Order in Council, based on the fact that Bahrein was a British Protectorate. Mr. Morley : Of course you would have the whole thing revived by Persia and the Turk, and they might have friends—Turkey might especially have a friend.* Appendix 2. 16 First Meeting, 2nd March, 1908. . Sr f. E * . Grey : We should not mind especially about that. The Turks have claimed it nineteen times; but in 1871 they said they had no intention whatever of obtaining supremacy over Bahrein. Mr. Morley : But that is not the same thing as acquiescence in our supremacy. Mr. Lloyd-George : If the man on the spot agrees that you can act as his deputy it should be all right. Mr. Morley : The Sheikh, you mean. Mr Lloyd-George : Yes. If he parts with his jurisdiction to the Representative of the Indian Government, I think we can say : “ It is none of your business.” Sir E. Grey : I do not think we should take any steps about this. General Nicholson : \Ye should not admit that he parted with it, because that would laise an international question, lie would say : “ I delegated all my powers.” Mr. Lloyd-George : les ; we could exercise jurisdiction on his behalf. Si r L. Grey : It is not a thing that the r I urk would take any trouble about, and as to protests, he protests against everything. Me have exercised Consular jurisdiction over the Bahreinese in L urkey, and he has recognized that apparently. Sir C. Hardinge : Yes, he has. Sir E. Grey : We have always done it. Mr. Morley : I am only thinking that we must look forward to a time when a pretty stiff controversy may arise about the Gulf, in all its aspects, between us and perhaps two great European Powers, certainly one, when every point that can be made against us will undoubtedly be made. Sir E. Grey : I he point with Germany would be, of course, whether this Treaty of 18b0, or the previous Treaty with the Sheikh, means really a Protectorate, or whether it does not. . ^ R - Morley : I only meant that we have got to be prepared for all the points being taken. . Sm E - Grey : As we have got a Treaty with the Sheikh which prevents him having any correspondence whatever with the German Government without our consent, I think that is quite enough ground for us to say to the Germans that any correspondence they want to have with Bahrein must go through us. Mr. Morley : I was thinking of the German operating on behalf of the Turk. The Turk says he has always had a sort of status, and he might have—and to-day very likely would have Germany at his back ; so that this wretched Bahrein, in that case, w T ould bring us very close to serious international questions. That is only one of the many effects of the Baghdad Railway. Lord Esher : Do we rely on the Treaty of 1880 only, or on the Treaty of 1861 as well? Sir R. Ritchie : M e rely on them all, but the Treaty of 1880 is the most explicit. 77. Lord Esher : Do you think that we should exercise wider judicial powers under the Treaty of 1861 than we do actually exercise—I am referring to p. 146. # Sir R. Ritchie : It would be regularising those important judicial powers. General Nicholson : The functions of the court are given on p. 144.* 78. Lord Esher : Under the Treaty of 1861 do you think he could exercise wider judicial powers than he actually has exercised ?Evidence of Sir 11. T. Ritchie. 17 Sir IL Ritchie : I cannot answer that. I do not carry the Treaty of 18G1 in my head. 79. Mr. Morley : Have we got to this—that we must either square the Sheikh, or, without squaring the Sheikh, take the strong measure of issuing an Ordei in Council, &amp;c. ? Sir R. Ritchie : Apparently, under the Treaty of 1861, the engagements entered into in 1820 were declared to he valid, and the Chief, as independent Ruler of Bahrein, bound himself to abstain from war in support of slavery, and the Butish Government engaged to maintain the security of his territory. 80. Mr. Morley : That renewed the engagement of 1820 ? Sir R. Ritchie : Yes, and we accepted him as independent Ruler of Bahrein. Mr. Lloyd-George : Our jurisdiction is very limited. Look at p. 144.* The jurisdiction to be exercised now is not very much greater than the juiisdiction which an ordinary Consul possesses. 81. Sir E. Grey : The Indian Government recommend that Bahrein should be “ declared by His Majesty in Council to be a territory in which jurisdiction is exercised by, or on behalf of, His Majesty.” ._ . . . “ We would accordingly request that, if His Majesty’s Government see no objection, the necessary^ Order in Council may be passed providing for the exercise of jurisdiction m Bahrein. I do not see that any of our Treaties gives us the right to do that without the consent of the Sheikh. If the Sheikh said “ You are going beyond your Treaty rights,” we should be in a hole. Sir R. Ritchie : Yes. Mr. Morley : On p. 145'” there is a reference to the precedent of Zanzibar. Could you tell us anything of Zanzibar that would throw light on this ? Sir E. Grey : I can tell you there is a great difference between Zanzibar and Bahrein, clearly. Foreign Powers had separate Treaties of their own with Zanzibar, giving them extra-territorial jurisdiction over their own subjects in Zanzibar actually giving them that jurisdiction. In Bahrein not only ha\e they not got such Treaties, but we have got a Treaty which prohibits them from having Consular Agents of their own. 1 think that distinction is clear. In Zanzibar they had pnoi Tieaties actually establishing the thing which they are prohibited from having in Bahrein ; so they could not argue from Zanzibar to Bahrein. Mr. Morley : I do not remember what we did at Zanzibar. Sir E. Grey : We are still doing. We have not got rid of all the Treaties which the foreign nations have still. Mr. Morley : What are we—a Protectorate, or what ? Sir E. Grey : We have got a Protectorate, but then they have extra-territorial jurisdiction over their own subjects. Sir R. Ritchie : About this, the point seems to be to ascertain from the Govern ment of India that the Sheikh will be willing to give us jurisdiction over foreign subjects. Sir E. Grey : I should have thought it was that we agree that the Treaties we have got with Bahrein would support the action which the Government of India desire to take as against any foreign objections, but that they do not appear to give us the right to do this without the consent of the Sheikh, and it would be necessary for the Government of India first to arrange matters with the Sheikh before any Order in Council is issued. Mr. Morley : Have we got to that, that we are to have an Order in Council ? Sir E. Grey : I was going to say that I think here again the Government of India would very probably say, if they are going to raise this matter with the Sheikh : “We [376] * Appendix 2. FEvidence of Sir R. T. Ritchie. 19 * Appendix 2. Sir E. Grey : You are saying now, three years afterwards, what Lord Lansdowne said, and that is a very good example that continuity of foreign policy may consist in making no progress at all. That is the point we have arrived at. 85. Mr. Morley : Now the next point in the Memorandum is the Wahahees. Sir R. Ritchie : There I think all that need be said is that the question turns on quarrels of the tribes in the interior. 1 take it all that need be done there is to maintain the decision that we should do nothing whatever except on the coast. Sir E. Grey : Yes, by all means. 86 . Mr. Morley: Rut observe that on p. 150* the Government of India were considering a proposal to send an agent four years ago to the Wahabee capital. Sir R. Ritchie : Yes ; but that has been forbidden by successive Secretaries of State. Sir E. Grey : You laid down something about this in 1906, which is quoted on p. 154. v ‘ ? Mr. Morley : The idea of our plunging into a Central Arabian policy certainly rather shocked me. No more need be said at present on this. Sir E. Grey : No. Then we come to Koweit. 87. Mr. Morley : Now, Sir Richmond, tell us how we stand juris-prudentially in Koweit. Sir R. Ritchie : Whenever we write to the Foreign Office we always say, the Sheikh of Koweit, with whose status the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is acquainted 5 ” and similarly when the Foreign Office viite to us the} adopt a similar form. Practically he is under our protection. We have guaranteed him against the only person who would attack him, who is the lurk. Sir E. Grey : We have evidently guaranteed him. 88 . Mr. Morley : He is not a Sovereign like the Sultan of Muscat, is he ? Sir R. Ritchie : No. The Turks have a shadowy sort of rights over him which our aim has steadily been to make more and more shadowy. 89. Mr. Lloyd-George : Does he pay a tribute to the Sultan of Turkey? Sir R. Ritchie : I do not know. Sir E. Grey : I do not think he pays a tribute now, but he hedges in this way, that, though he has a sort of promise from us that we will protect him against the Turks, in °order to prevent the Turk from attacking him, or to please the Turks, he flies the Turkish flag ; and when we ask him why he flies the Turkish flag, m order to avoid annoying us he says: U I only fly it as a Mahommedan flag, because I am a Mahommedan.” Sir C. Hardinge : In reality he does it because he is afraid of their seizing his personal property, which is in Turkish territory. Sir E. Grey : Meanwhile, we have very satisfactory relations with the Sheikh, and here we have made a little progress, because we have now leased his foreshore. That has been done in the last year. Mr. Lloyd-George : It is the only feasible outlet for the railway. Sir E. Grey t : It is certainly the best. Mr. Morley : The cost of which the poor Indian pays half, I think. Sir E. Grey : Yes. The Baghdad Railway is of great importance to India, and you have always admitted that. Mr. Morley : Yes, I have, certainly.Evidence of Sm R. T. Ritchie. 21 Sm E. Grey : That, of course, is purely Turkish, and it is not very good naviga tion there, is it ? General Nicholson : You could not take any very large ship to Basra, could you ? Sir E. Grey : You cannot get ocean-going steamers up to Basra. General Ewart : Not without dredging the channel. Captain Slade : It is quite possible to dredge it, and then you could get ships up, but at Um Kasr you could get biggish ships in without very much trouble. Sir R. Ritchie : Is there access to Um Kasr by the channel to the north of Warba Island ? Captain Slade : Yes. I want to point out that although we have got a lease of the foreshore of all possible places at Koweit, we have not safeguarded ourselves entirely in that region. Sir R. Ritchie : We are not quite sure whether we shall want Warba. We have got the right of pre-emption, but we do not know whether the Sheikh has any rights. Suppose he has rights, that would give us control of Warba Roads to the south of Warba Island. But that would only block the southern approach to Um Kasr, and there would still be a possibility of access. Captain Slade : There would still be a possibility of working up round. Sir C. Hardinge : We have maintained that the Sheikh of Koweit has rights over Um Kasr and Bubiyan Island, and we told the Turks when they occupied those two places we would not recognize their authority. 93. Sir E. Grey : Our lease from the Sheikh covers Um Kasr and Warba. Sir R. Ritchie : Yes, but when w^e asked them to withdraw' from Bubiyan w'e did not ask them to withdraw from Um Kasr. Sir C. Hardinge : That weakens our position. Mr. Morley : Um Kasr is about 4 miles up the Khor Zobeir; there is no town there, only an inclosure kept by the Turkish garrison. There is fresh water, and so on. Sir E. Grey : We cannot cover Um Kasr by this ; we cannot establish a claim to it. Mr. Morley : We have nothing further to say about Koweit, have we ? Sir E. Grey : There is nothing more to be done about Koweit, because it is quite satisfactory about Koweit, really. Sir C. Hardinge : Yes, if we could only get more done to Bubiyan Island, which we cannot do. Sir E. Grey : We could do it, but then that would lead to other trouble. But we have never recognized their being there. Mr. Morley : The only question that remains in my mind is whether that will be challenged if the struggle ever comes. Sir E. Grey : It will be, but then we have established as much claim as we possibly can, and I do not see what more we can do about it. Mr. Morley : Is it certain that they would admit the Sheikh had a right to lease ? They may say it belonged to the Turk. Sir E. Grey : They may say that, but we cannot do more than we have done. We cannot establish a stronger claim than we have done unless w r e were to annex it, or do something which we do not want to do. [376] G* Appendix 2. m 22 First Meeting, 2nd March, 1908.

It is a very good anchorage. It is quite possible to use that. Mr. Morley : But, of course as much depends upon the land approaches as upon the anchorage if the line is to be brought down there. Captain Slade : Of course it does. Me - Morley : That is what one wants to know something about. I would suggest that some of your young men might explore that point a little. Sir C.

Mr. Morley : We will go on with our voyage about the coast. There is nothing to say about Bnshire, is there ? Sir R. Ritchie : I think not. Sir E. Grey : Just going hack a moment. I think if Persia gets worse and worse, and Mohammerah comes to us, we ought to protect the Sheikh. Mr. Morley : That was the former decision. Sir E. Grey : Yes. That is understood. 97. Mr. Morley : About Bassidu, upon p. 165' :!: ' it appears there was a conference held, and among other recommendations as to the methods in which British influence might he extended, it was advised that “ we should assert our claims at Bassidu.” But that was only regarded as a Minute of this Committee, and nothing was done. It was said that we might consider steps for consolidating our position at the entrance of the Island of Kishm, and that the ruined buildings at Bassidu should be pulled down and a small station under British-Indian subjects established. That again would require certain expenditure. Sir E. Grey : Yes. Then there is the depot for stores. Sir R. Ritchie : There is always a question about Bassidu. It has never been stated definitely in the correspondence whether our rights there are rights of Sovereigns or merely rights of owners of the freehold. It certainly belongs to us, but whether we have sovereign rights, or whether our rights are subject to Persian sovereignty, has never been cleared up. Of course that might in certain contingencies be important. 98. Sir E. Grey : We have got a right to establish our depot there, apparently, because we have got the land. Sir R. Ritchie : Yes, and we fly a flag there. General Nicholson : And it has been used as a depot. Captain Slade : The building is still there. Sir E. Grey : It is again a question whether we spend money, and, if so, whether establishing a depot should be one of the objects on which we should spend money. 99. Mr. Morley : Quite so; the special strategic reason being that it guards the entrance to the Gulf. Sir R. Ritchie : I take it to be so. Sir C. Hardinge : Is it a good naval station there ? Captain Slade : There is no object in it, except as a dog-in-the-manger. ^ Mr. Morley : It has a population of about 350 only ; it has been a station for the Indian Marine for sixty years, and the water-supply is fair. A recent Report states that Bassidu is of no practical value for naval purposes, but is of value as giving us a claim so that no foreign Power shall obtain a footing at Kishm Island. Captain Slade : I quite agree with that. The only value of our going to Bassidu is to prevent anybody else going there or having any claim on the island. As far as naval strategy is concerned, it is of no value to us at all. Mr. Morley : That would be a reason why we should not spend any money on it, then. I admit a claim for sticking* up a flag-staff, if you like, but why all this about stores and meteorological stations ? Captain Slade : In former days, before our communications got so much better it was used as a store place for the Indian Marine ; but at the present moment it is of practically no value at all.24 First Meeting, 2nd March, 1908. . ^ R - M^kley : There is a flag-staff and a ruined buugalow, the which the British flag is habitually flown being close to the building, is roofless, and contains only an old turning-lathe and the remains of place could be set in order. flag-staff from The workshop a forge. That p lf G / PT ;, UN Slade : I am supposing that we do not put any large naval force into the Unit tor the purpose of policing the pearl fisheries or exercising any further powers troni there. But if we do that, and the force consists of small ships, then Bassidu would m those circumstances, be useful. From the point of view of strategy or anything of that kind it is not of any use at all. Mb. Mobley : I think we might simply take rather a pale note about the stores— perhaps m pencil, and not in ink. Then we go to Abu Musa, which is rather a troublesome pJace at present. 100 . Sir E Grey : We have got Treaties there, have we not ? We are on strong ground at Abu Musa, as it is under British protection. It was one of the places under our protection included in the announcement some time ago, was it not ? Sir R. Ritchie : I am afraid I cannot answer that. 101. Sir e Grey: Anyhow, at the present moment we have told the Germans definitely, and they have not disputed it that Abu Musa is under our protection ? Sir R. Ritchie : Yes. 102. Sir E. Grey : And that all communications that have the British Resident or the British Consul ? to pass, must go through Sir R. Ritchie : Yes. 103 Sir E. Grey: We have taken up that position and the Germans have not disputed that. Sir R. Ritchie : No. _ 104. Sir E. Grey : We have a dispute with them about Wonckhaus’ Icommercial claim m regard to red oxide, but they are not raising any political question, and we have definitely laid down that it is a British Protectorate, and as a matter of fact I think that was announced a very long time ago, though we may not have made a direct communication to the German Government at the time. Sik R. Ritchie : The Treaties of 1892 with the trucial Chiefs and Bahrein have 1 believe, been published m u Hertslet’s Treaties.” ’ 105 Sir E. Grey : There is no doubt about our Treaties with these trucial Chiefs is there r * Sir R. Ritchie : No. 10G. Sir E. Grey : They do constitute a Protectorate ? Sir R. Ritchie : I take it to be so. „„ SlE , E - (i REY: So there is really nothing more to be done about Abu Musa now. Effectively, as lar as we have got, we have asserted a claim to a Protectorate. Captain Slade : Does that include the whole of this coast ? Sir E. Grey : It includes everything which belongs to these trucial Chiefs. 107. Captain Slade : It is a very large strip. Would it give us a Protectorate over the whole of the coast ? Sir E. Grey : I think we have got it with the trucial Chiefs. Sir R. Ritchie . Yes ; they do not admit a foreign agent or correspond with foreigners direct. 108. Sir E. Grey ; Do they agree not to correspond with foreigners ?Evidence of Sir R. T. Ritchie. 25 Sir R. Ritchie : Not with foreign Powers. 109. Captain Slade : Then that is almost the same as Bahrein, and if it is effective as far as the trucial Chiefs are concerned, it might he effective as far as Bahrein is concerned—the two being identical. Sir R. Ritchie : But in Bahrein we need so much more. With the trucial Chiefs we have such a rough country, and there are so few dealings, that we do not have any difficulty in interpreting what consequences flow from the three conditions of our Agreements. Captain Slade : Still, at Abu Musa you have got the red oxide, which is a valuable commercial article, and if they will admit it on the one Treaty, is there any reason why they should not admit it on the other ? Sir E. Grey : But they have not raised the political question about Abu Musa— in fact, they have not raised any political question at all. Wonckhaus had a lease of the red oxide at Abu Musa, and the Sheikh cancelled that lease—or, rather, before Wonckhaus had it—and it was transferred to him. The Germans have taken that up as a purely commercial claim, and they have not raised the political question. But it does not follow that they would admit it about Bahrein, or that they would not raise a political question about Bahrein, because they have not done it at Abu Musa. Lord Esher : Have you not told the Germans that Abu Musa is under our protection ? Sir E. Grey : Yes; we have told them, anyhow, that we have got a Treaty under which the Sheikh of Shargah must not correspond except through us, and the Germans are now doing whatever they do there through our men. Lord Esher : They have accepted that ? 110. Sir E. Grey: Yes. The point raised about Bahrein was establishing jurisdiction over foreigners, which the Sheikh of Bahrein now exercises himself. It is hardly material to argue from Abu Musa to Bahrein now, because we have agreed with reference to the Sheikh at Bahrein that we shall have to come to an arrangement with him, but that that would depend upon what we do on the whole. There is nothing more to be done with the Treaties we have got with these trucial Chiefs, which are satisfactory. Sir R. Ritchie : They meet all contingencies that are likely to arise, 111. Sir E. Grey : That are likely to arise in these places ? Sir R. Ritchie : Yes, Sir E. Grey ; I am not sure that we had not better settle the question of subsidies the next time we meet, first, because it is getting very pressing. Mr. Lloyd-George : Can you give us some sort of general idea in figures what the subsidies mean ? First of all, there is the lighthouse; we might have a notion what that would cost. Then we might have a general idea of what the subsidy to the Sheikh of Bahrein would be—within certain limits. Sir E. Grey : My feeling is that if our shipping is driven out of the Gulf, all our trade goes with the shipping, and then none of these other things really matter. Mr. Morley : Quite true. We should be left with the lighthouse and jurisdiction over foreigners in Bahrein, and with 80 per cent, of the trade in the hands of the Germans instead of in our own—which would be a barren result. The next time we will begin with considering the question raised in the letter which I spoke of when we began—how we are to meet the demand, from the point of view of Persian Gulf policy, of the English Combine for help to enable them to stand up. Sir E. Grey : Whether British shipping is to be maintained there, and, if so. how ? Mr. Morley : All the rest of it, what we have been doing to-day, is subsidiary ? [376] HFirst Meeting, 2nd March, 1908. Sir E. Grey : les, I think it is really subsidiary to that. Mr. Lloyd-George : How are we to ascertain in the meantime what subsidy will put this thing through ? . Sir E. Grey : I thought we might have the help of the Board of Trade. We might possibly see Mr. Strick again. Then Mr. Eloyd has been doing very well. The best plan would be for your people at the Board of Trade to see Mr. Lloyd and to find out. Mr. Lloyd-George : Mr. Llewellyn Smith can do that. Sir C. Hardinge : Mr. Wilson Fox has been in correspondence with Mr. Lloyd. Mr. Lloyd-George : He will do it very well. Str L. Grey: Yes; he can see Mr. Lloyd and ascertain how much is wanted to stave off this thing for another couple of years. That is the thing to do I think. Mr. Lloyd-George : The first thing to find out seems to be to know what the amount is. Sir E, Grey : I think we had better give a little time for that. Mr. Lloyd-George : A\ hat about the Post Office? There is a lot of mischief in a direct subsidy. Ion will be provoking America, and you will be provoking Germany if you give subsidies. Could it be put in the form of a Post Office subsidy for mails ? It is really rather important. Mr. Morley : First of all we have got to establish the question of principle. Mr. Lloyd-George : I agree; but there are other questions which are accessories. Mr. Morley : I think we might assume that, if we decide in favour of the question of principle, the Post Office will be willing to lend themselves to whatever indirect methods we desire. Sir E. Grey : We have really got a problem which has never been considered before. It was always Russia before ; it is now Germany and the Baghdad Railway. General Nicholson : Do you want to prevent any termination at all of the Baghdad Railway ? Sir E. Grey : No ; but we do not want them to make the Baghdad Railway without our being in it. We have agreed that it is not a thing which can be indefinitely blocked, therefore it is a thing which we want to go into ; and the stronger our position the better terms we can get for coming in. Mr. Morley : We thought originally of having Sir James Mackay on the Committee, and I think we might have him as a witness next time. He is extremely well posted in all Persian Gulf affairs. You have seen him on some occasion Sir Charles, I think ? Sir C. Hardinge: Yes. Mr. Morley : Do you think it would be very desirable to have him as a witness ? Sir C. Hardinge : Yes ; because he knows the thing so well. Mr. Morley : If the Committee allow it I will ask him to come. I shall be seeing him to-morrow.

Wilson Fox, C.B., of the Board of Trade, was also present.) II? Mr Morley : Will you tell us what, in your view, is the general aspect of English trade with and in the Persian Gulf ?-In 1906 188 steamers loaded at Basra, w hfch is at the top of the Persian Gulf, of which 166 were British, 6 German, and 6 Russian; so that I think we might say the greater preponderance of trade in the Persian Gulf is carried by British ships. , ^ , T 113. You could tell us if it is trade between the Gulf and England, or between the Gulf and India, for example ?—By far the greater proportion of the exports from the Persian Gulf that come to Europe come to Great Britain ; then a large proportion of the balance of the exports goes to India, and a considerable amount goes to the United States—to Boston and New York. 114 In English bottoms ?—Yes. The lines between the United Kingdom and the Persian Gulf are, first, the British India Steamship Company. They do not have a direct line from London, but they have lines running from Bombay and Karachi up the Gulf, and they take a considerable quantity of cargo which comes originally from London and is transhipped at Bombay, it being sent out either by their own steamers direct to Karachi or Bombay, or by the P. and 0. or other regular lines from this country. Then we have the Anglo-Algerian Steamship Company, managed by Messrs. Strick Then we have the Bucknall Steamship Company, which is managed by Messrs Bucknall, and the West Hartlepool Steam Navigation Company, which is. managed by Jones, Price, and Co. Then lately Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. have- come into the trade, and they charter occasional steamers for homeward loading. Practically 90 per cent, of the trade from London to the Persian Gulf is carried on by the Stricks, Bucknalls, and George Price. Then we have the Hamburg-Amerika Line running from Hamburg to the Persian Gulf. That was started about three or four years ago. They are sending out twelve steamers a-year—practically about one a month ; they get very little cargo from Hamburg and Antwerp, and so far they have not called at any British ports. They get a fair quantity of cargo home entirely for the Continent. Then we have a Russian line between the Black Sea ’ [376] 1111 ■———w———WWWB—W—■H— 28 Second Meeting, Gth March, 1908. and the Persian Gulf, but they send very few steamers-only some two or three a-vear W e have a very large trade carried on between Bombay and the Persian Gulf which is mostly carried on by the British India Company. They have as well as a fast mail service, a subsidiary weekly service. These two services are, to some extent' subsidized by the Government of India. The British India Company have S has been m operation now for the last 30, 40 or 50 years under whiebtl ’ rv. carries the mails all round the coast of India,’ and nmThese steamers from Bombay up to Basra and back.

Then they go on to they an ^ Tlu hS “mi • hrein ’ ? ro y ided tfrfy h^e cargoes to these places ; and tney au call at Bushire. Their principal port of discharge is Basra which as von knou, is a Turkish port. Homewards, the ports of call are usually the same but it depends on the quantity of cargo offering. As I have said before, Ty far the’greater alT heT rts 6 ^ Um } e , d Kill gdom. The steamers from Bombay go to all the poits m the Gulf, both out and home ; they take up the mails, and they canw a very large number of native passengers—Indian, Arab, and Persian. 7 * llo. \\ here are the passengers going to—what to do?—They are mostly traders who carry on the business between the ports in the Persian Gul/ A greatTany of . aie dealers.in pearls We carry down a very large number of Arab horses every year, as Sir \\ dliam Nicholson knows. There is altogether a very large traffic between India and the 1 ersian Gulf. As regards the trade, the trade out and home o-oes on all e year round, but it is mostly done homewards between September and'December during the date season, lire trade from India up to and from the Gulf is carried on also all the year round, but mostly from the month of October till May, not’so much ‘'''f , 1 °J le ! n t ie monsoon, that is, 111 the rainy season. I do not know whether I need trouble the Committee with the imports. eea ^ 116. I think not, as we shall get those elsewhere.

I lieu we may say that, even m spite of the subsidy, both your strong line and he less strongly established lines have held their own against Herr Ballin and Co Tl Of course we have held our own from India, because we Ire not interfered with to any extent ay them. I do not know whether Stacks and BucknaUs and the West HartK pool Lines have been doing very much good in the Gulf; I should question it. I do not think they have been very seriously interfered with so far by the Germans. No doubt homewards the rates have been lowered considerably, but the Germans are quite uTable to carry all the cargo that comes away from the Persian Gulf; and so it would be is offering 101 ' ^ 061111(1118 t0 reduce the rates when th ey cannot carry all the stuff that m What would be the disadvantages of admitting Herr Ballin and Co. into this combine?-! do not quite understand what the proposals are. It may be that Herr Ballm and the Hamburg-Amerika Company have got tired of this running out from Hamburg to Basra with practically empty ships, and that they want to call aj uon on and tap some of the London traffic. Probably Mr. Lloyd-George will know BucknallsTre. 0 ^ 8 ^ ^ 1 d ° ^ kn ° W Wha ‘ HeiT BalIln ’ S P ro P osals to Stricks and Sir E. Grby : I can tell you. The proposal is that Stack and the others shouldEvidence of Sib J. Mack ay. 29 join and form a combine with the Hamburg-Amerika Line, and the threat of the Hamburg-Amerika Line is that if Strick and the others will not come into a combine the Hamburg-Amerika Line will begin calling at British ports. That Mr. Lloyd- George has seen in the paper too, I think. Mr. Lloyd-George : Yes ; Mr. Wilson Fox has seen that. 121. Sir E. Grey : They do not now call at British ports, but they will call at British ports, and they will subject Strick and others to a competition to which they have not yet been subject?—I do not know how the word “ combine” is understood. Do the } 7 propose that they shall have the same rates of freight outwards and homewards ? Sir E. Grey : That I do not think we have had stated. 122. Mr. Morley : That we shall get later on ?—What is the nature of the combine?—It is possible that the Hamburg-Amerika Company have said to Stricks and the West Hartlepool and Bucknalls, “ It is no use our competing against each other in the way we are doing, carrying cargo at ruinous rates, and it is much better for us to put our heads together and charge reasonable rates out to the Gulf and also homewards.” If that is the proposal, it does not seem to me there is very much to object to in that. 123. Do you assume that it will not be at all like the operations of the Germans in the Siamese waters—but, first, would you mind telling us what they did in that case?—The Norddeutscher Lloyd out in Siam went to Holts, who had a line of steamers running up from Singapore to Bangkok and back, and said to them, “ If you are not particularly anxious to remain in this trade, we shall be very pleased to buy your steamers and buy your trade ” ; Holts named their price, and the Germans paid it, and they have ever since run the trade. They carried on that trade entirely between Bangkok and Singapore till a year or two ago. when the Japanese attacked them and tried to cut into the trade ; now they have squared the Japanese and the Japanese have left the trade, and the Germans have got it entirely to themselves. 124. How did the Germans square the Japs ?—I think they may have given them some money payment, but that they also agreed not to compete with them on some other line. It was a mutual arrangement, and now the Germans have got it entirely to themselves. Of course, if 1 knew exactly what the Hamburg-Amerika proposals were I might be able to answer your question. Sir E. Grey : I do not think we know entirely. All we know is that it is a demand to be admitted into partnership with the British lines. 125. Mr. Lloyd-George : To pool the profits ?—Indeed ? You mean to make a regular combine, and to charter the ships on joint account for the four interests ? Mr. Lloyd-George : I think so. Mr. Morley' : And with no power of giving discriminating advantages to German goods, because that would be the real point. But, of course, what Herr Ballin would like would be, first of all, to have a large share of the prohts ; and, secondly, to carry as much German goods as he could, rather than English. Mr. Lloyd-George : I know; and that is one question I wanted to put to Sir James. 126. Sir E. Grey : The actual proposal apparently was, as far as we know it, that Herr Ballin wished to be taken into partnership with the British lines in the Persian Gulf trade ? Sir J. Mackay : That must mean much more than a mere arrangement as to what rates they will charge; being taken into partnership must mean sharing the prohts. I can understand their coming into an arrangement to divide the trade and saying, “ You have got three ships to our one, and we will endeavour to divide the trade—a fourth to each—and to charge the same rates of freight; so it does not matter who carries the cargo. We will divide it equally, and we will pool the earnings.” But I cannot under stand their making any proposals to work the whole of the steamers of the four Companies on joint account and to divide the prohts. That would be a very difficult matter to arrange, especially with the Germans. I think it must surely mean, Sir Edward, that they propose to divide the trade. The Germans say, “ Give us a fourth, and you retain three-fourths.” The P. and 0. and ourselves made the same arrange ment with the Hansa Line in regard to the Antwerp trade. The Hansa Line tried tor 30 Second Meeting, 6th March, 1908. keep us out of Antwerp altogether, and we fought them there for about eighteen months at a very serious loss to ourselves ; but eventually they gave way, and we got our sliare of the trade. I think we—the P. and 0. and the British India—have half between us, and the Hansa Line have the other half. I think it must be some arrangement of that sort. 127. Mr. Morley : To go to a point which engaged the Committee’s attention the last time we met—you may not care to answer it—but do you think the danger to English doings in the Persian Gulf is so large and active that a subsidy is to be thought of ■ 1 certainly think, if the Germans are subsidized by the German Govern- mt nt, and the English lines are not subsidized, and the Germans are able to carry on then tiade even at a moderate amount of profit, and the English lines are losing money, that the Germans will in the long run be able to oust the English lines from the Persian Gulf. 128. Of course we cannot forget that the Baghdad Railway is supposed one day or another to be coming down to the Gulf, which I presume will give the Germans an extra advantage ? It will, undoubtedly. 1 presume that the Hamburg-Amerika Line’s having started from Hamburg to Basra is entirely owing to the prospect of the Germans getting the railway down as far as either Basra or Koweit. If they have began this in oidei to make a^ through connection between Basra and Europe by German ships, it will then be a German railway sending the cargo home by German ships. 129. 8ir E. Grey: \ou think they are pegging out a claim?—I think they are pegging out a claim. l.d). In order to make it appear that they have an interest at that end ?— Undoubtedly, borne two or three years ago, I think, or a year ago—I believe yon have the papers in the foreign Office—the Hamburg-Amerika people w^rote to us and said, M e understand you have got about ten or fifteen buoys in the Persian Gulf” —they were navigation buoys which w r e laid down about twentv five years ago, and which we have maintained ever since. “ We understand that it costs you a good deal to maintain them,^ and w r e shall be very glad to share with you the cost of maintaining them.” We said, “ No ; we prefer to go on maintaining them ourselves.” I think, as you say, Sir Edward, it is entirely a matter of pegging out a claim and establishing their claim to the Peisian Gulf trade. I think undoubtedly if the German Government are behind the Hamburg—Amerika Company, and are prepared to pay the losses, and pay the depreciation, and give them interest on the capital they have invested in the ships in the Persian Gulf, they will eventually be able to drive the British steamers out of that trade altogether. 131. M r. Morley : Are you aware of any case in which w^e subsidize a line from this country or from India to a foreign port, which this is—Basra being Turkish, as \ou told us? Quite true. I do not know' of a case, except for mail purposes, of course. 132. And there it is payment for a service ?--There is probably quite as strong ^ c |j nn .’ as , ’ Eloyd-George know r s, for a subsidy from London to our own possessions in British hast Africa. There w r e have got an English territory at the one end and the Tinted Kingdom at the other, and yet it is impossible for British ships to continue that seivice because they are knocked out of the field by the highly subsidized German steamers. loo. Mh. Lloyd-George : After we spent a lot of money in building a railway, ^ 1 0 1 v ian i^ e&lt; ^ over t° the Germans?—Yes. The Germans of course take quite a different line here. Ihey say, “We are going to build a railway to Basra, and even beiore the railway is built w'e are going to subsidize a line of steamers in order to make a connection. Now w r e have built a railway from Uganda down to Mombasa, and we have left it at a loose end, and are permitting the whole of the trade to be carried by the Germans. \ ^ ^ 0RLEY : Before 1 part with you, I naturally ask you, Supposing the La jmet weie to accept the proposal of the subsidy that w'e have been talking about, what is the share of India in it ? Can it be maintained that, though it may be quite justi able to subsidize an English line against the Germans, both for commercial reasons and for reasons of political advantage, India is bound to contribute ? What is le interest of India f 1 ou know India w 7 ell ; tell us in your view 7 what interest Lidia las in it, and whether India is bound to contribute?—In the payment of a subsidy for steamers from the United Kingdom to the Persian Gulf ?Evidence of Sir J. Mackav. 31 l’&gt; . May 1 add, not only the payment of subsidies to steamers, but payments for improving the navigation by setting up lighthouses, for resident agents at Bahrein and other places,^ and for doing something or other at Muscat—all involving an expen- ditore oi money? What I would like to ask you is, whether in your view, with your Indian experience, having thought about these things, India gains advantage from it so dneet and clear that she ought to contribute?—I should say, in regard to a subsidy to keep iip a line of steamers between England and the Persian Gulf, that India ought to contribute nothing. India already subsidizes a line of steamers—two steamers a week from Bombay and Karachi up the Persian Gulf—and I think she does all that is lequired from the Indian point of view. In regard to the maintaining of Consular establishments at Muscat, Bahrein, Bunder Abbas, Bushire, and Basra, as the trade between the Persian Gulf and India is practically of as great a value as the trade between this country and the Persian Gulf, I should say that it is quite a fair charge foi India to bear half the cost of those establishments. In regard to the building of lighthouses, I assume they will be self-supporting. No doubt the ships using these lighthouses and making use oi these waters would pay light dues for the use of these aids to navigation. I am quite sure all steamers using the Persian Gulf would be only too glad to do so. As it is now, the whole place is in absolute darkness. From Muscat right up to basia there is not a single light, except perhaps an oil lamp hanging up in 136. Sir E. Grey : A lien you speak of the light dues, what amount of due have you m mind ? \\ hat is reasonable ?—An amount sufficient to give a fair interest upon the capital and to provide a sinking fund. i oq' mu W mucl1 per ton ? ^ is difficult to say. It depends on the cost of the light. innAW’ , W0U }^ not pay '’hMever was asked per ton ?—If a lighthouse cost 10,0006 to build and 3006 or 4006 a-year to keep up, there would have to be a charge levied upon the tonnage visiting the Gulf to make good the expenditure. You have got the formula in the Board of Trade. 139. Mr. Morley : \\ hat would your answer be on the Indian point to this : The Indian cultivator surely grains, it will be said, by trade ; the more traffic there is, the more facility for exjportation and so forth, the more the Indian cultivator gains thereby ; and does not, it will be said, every community gain by the activity of trade ? How would you think that argument affects the just liability, if it be just, of the Indian to pay or to^ contribute^ at all to all these things ?—I should say the gain of the Indian agriculturist, the Indian producer, would be too indirect to make a charge upon the Indian revenues for a subsidy for a line of steamers from London to the Persian Gulf, and I do not think it could be justified. But, looking to the enormous traffic there is between India and the Persian Gulf and Basra, the enormous number of Indians who are travelling backwards and forwards, and the large trade done by the natives of India the 1 arsees and others 1 certainly do think it is quite reasonable that a share oi the cost of the Consular establishments should be paid by the Indian Government. 140. Sir E. Grey : I will just take up that Indian point for a moment. There is an enormous Indian traffic, you say, carried on in British India steamers ?—Yes, mostly. 141. 1 hey are subsidized already ?—They are alreadv subsidized for carrying the mails. * ° „ 0 14 J- And therefore they are not affected by this proposal of Herr Ballin’s at all ?—No. 143. 4hat deals solely with the European traffic?—Entirely. Supposing Herr Ballin had acquired a monopoly of the European trade of the Gulf, I presume he might take you in detail afterwards and extend his sailings to India, making the same sort of proposal to .you as to whether you would come into partnership with him ?—Y es, he might ; but 1 do not think he would be likely to ask us to come into partnership. If he decided to establish a line of steamers from Basra to Bombay, he would probably ask us to agree to rates of freight, so as to avoid cut-throat competition. I have no doubt whatever when the railway is made to Koweit oi to Basra that the Germans will put on a line of steamers from the end of the railway down to Bombay. It would be quite natural that they should, if they are allowed to make the railway down as far as Koweit. Your point now is that, as far as the present emergenev is concerned, the Indian Government already subsidizes its own shipping to the Persian Gulf, and the Indian trade to the Persian Gulf is not threatened by the present development ?—Yes [376) kOHM 32 Second Meeting, (3th March, 1908. That^’s ^^ Leie ^ 01e ^ ere is n0 case for appealing to India in the present emergency ? the pre- u •.• 1 i 47 ‘i° f ? our ? e India would be very much affected, supposing the whole of ritish shipping m the Persian Gulf was transferred to German lines, by the pre ponderating interest which Germany would then have got in any object like the ag id ad Railway. The Baghdad Railway is a matter of intimate concern to India?— res, it is. 148. And to Indian trade generally ?—Yes. -I 4 ?! ' S() ^^^^^ly lndian interests would be very much threatened, would they 110 ’ 1 lc ^ 10 , e (d _ b 1 / 18 1 s ^PP^ n 8 ' (exclusive of the Indian shipping) disappeared out ot the lersian Gulf and were to be replaced by German shipping?—Would it mu e much difference to India ? I do not know whether it would. I do not think it would make much difference to the Indian trade. 150. It would make politically a considerable difference if it weakened our claim lor getting into the south end of the Baghdad Railway ?—Yes, politicallv it might. It would do that. ' ^ n i/W P resen ^ I understand our position is that we say we went to the Persian Gull before everybody else, and nobody has done anything for the Persian Gulf except ourselves. We have made it a navigable and commercial route, and we have done that entirely single-handed. That has a good deal of moral force as long as we can say tha the great proportion of shipping in the Persian Gulf is still British ; but supposing t mt disappears, then all that we have done in past years ceases to have any claim at ail, and it is something which is wiped out?—That is true. 152. Therefore the British interests in, and the British hold on, the Persian Gulf would be tremendously diminished, and that would be a serious thing for India ?— 1 es, it would and I presume politically for England too. But India lias not asked any one to help her m subsidizing the steamers running from Bombay to Basra, and I Basra * ka0W Ellglaild should ask Mia to aid in a subsidy from England to T r W E . xce P| that ultimately there is a joint interest; only you would say that Indm has done her share ?-I think India does her share, and I think in the meantime s le mig it be left alone. If it is necessary to help British ships to compete against the byYdia ^ 16 U ^ think that might be borne by the Imperial revenues and not 154. I suppose there is something in the argument that, if India has done her share I thfnYs tlUS ’ 516 might eXPeCt that H iS ° Ur t,,rn t0 d ° somet hing ?—Yes, loo. Of the trade which India does in the Gulf, have you any idea how much is Persian and how much is Mesopotamian ?-I should say 75 cent, is Mesopotamian. y e g ' 1 assnme Mesopotamia to be the real objective of the German competition ? lo7. So that German competition threatens nearly three-quarters of the Indian trade ?—I do not follow you. *1 15 1 8 ' ^ P cent '’ tllat is three-quarters, of the Indian trade is with Mesopotamia, then about three-quarters of the Indian trade will be endangered by the German competition, assuming Mesopotamia is the German objective ?—Yes if we have the Germans coming down to Bombay, but we have not got that just now, and there is no idea of that. The Hamburg-Amenka Company have told us, the British India, that they have no intention of interfering with our trhde to Bombay, and that their sole object^is to carry on the trade between Basra and Europe. !59. Of course that was to isolate you for the present—to get your neutrality - for the moment —I do not know that is quite possible. In the meantime 75 per cent, of the trade between the Persian Gulf and Bombay is from Mesopotamia, but 90 per cent., I think, of the trade between the Gulf and England is from Mesopotamia. IbO. bo it is really a Mesopotamian question ?—Yes, it is. 161. Mr. Lloyd-George : I have got the figures here. The imports into the Gulf from the Lmted Kingdom are : To Persia 551,0001, to Turkey (in Asia) 642,000L and to the Bahrein Islands and Muscat 123,000/., making a total of 1,316,000/. Then the exports from the Persian Gulf to the United Kingdom are : From Persia 223 100/. 'f arke y ( m ^ sia ) 758,000/., and from the Bahrein Islands 1,000/., or a total of 9ow,J00Z. therefore, as far as the exports of the United Kingdom are concerned Persia takes almost as much ? -I was speaking of the trade from Mesopotamia.Evidence of Sir J . Mackay. 33 162. The trade from Mesopotamia is 758,0002. as against 223,0002. from Persia?— It is just about what I thought. 163. Sir E. Grey : Would you say it is possible the Hamburg-Amerika Line are incurring all this loss now in the hope of driving the British shipping out of the Gulf, getting a monopoly of the trade, and eventually recouping themselves ; or do you think that they must have a subsidy at their back at the present moment ?—My own opinion is that they have got a subsidy at their back, and that they are subsidized by the German Government in order, as you say, to peg out a claim with a view to eventualities when the Baghdad Railway is made. Sfr E. Gricy : That subsidy does not appear in their accounts at all. Sir J. Mackay : It does not appear ? Sir E. Grey : No, it is not discoverable in any of their accounts, and I understand they know that at the Board of Trade. Mr. Lloyd-George : We cannot find it. Sir J. Mackay : If they have not got a subsidy, it may be that the Emperor has used his personal influence with Herr Ballin, and that he has induced him to continue this Persian Gulf business even at a loss. Mr. Lloyd-George : That is much more likely. 164. Sir E. Grey : There may, of course, be indirect ways of subsidizing, Sir James?—There may be indirect ways of helping him. There is all the influence, and then I think he has a subsidy on his American Line. 165. Mr. Lloyd-George : For America it is just the sort of subsidy the P. and O. get. It is a mail subsidy ?—The &lt; Jerman Government may help them in that way— “ If you cannot do this for the German Government we are not going to continue this large subsidy that you get for running across to America, or running out to Australia, or running out to China.” 166. Sir E. Grey : Here is the point I want to bring out: of course it is an ordinary commercial transaction with businesses which can afford to risk something that they should incur deliberately a commercial loss for a few years in the hope of extinguishing competitors and then recouping themselves afterwards ?—Quite true. 167. Would you think it possible that any shipping line like the Hamburg-Amerika Line would be doing this in the Persian Gulf purely for commercial objects ?—No, I do not think so. I do not think the trade is worth it. 168. So it means that the competition with British ship-owners for a place in the Persian Gulf by the Hamburg-Amerika Line is not one inspired by a desire for gain, or one inspired by purely commercial motives ?—I do not think for one moment the Hamburg-Amerika Line would ever have thought of running out from Hamburg to Basra in the hope of making a trade. I think they must have been influenced to do it in some way or other. 169. Mr. Morley : Might it not have been inspired by an expectation of the Baghdad Railway ? That is the plausible defence, so to say,£that might be put forward. They might say, “ We are losing, and we know it, but we are making ready for the arrival of our railway at Koweit ” ?—The arrival of the Baghdad Railway at Koweit is very distant, and I do not see how it can possibly be down there for another seven or eight or even ten years. Mr. Morley : They may not think that. 170. Sir E. Grey : I think they must think that?—I think they must realize that. 171. They have not got through the Taurus Mountains yet, and they are only going to build section by section, and they admit practically that they can only build section by section as they can sqweeze the kilometric guarantee out of the Turkish Government. That is a very slow process. They themselves are not attempting more than the next two sections, and even for those they have not yet got the kilometric34 Second Meeting, Gth March, 1908. guarantee, so it may be hung up for some time ?—I cannot conceive that any Company in its senses would start a line from Hamburg to Basra with the present traffic purely with the idea of getting in there when the railway line is made ten years hence. 172. I think that the pegging out of the claim still exists in this way : though the completion of the Baghdad Railway may be a long way off, they want to establish their position now, so much so that when they come to make the further sections of the Baghdad Railway they may be able to say that German interests in the trade are so preponderating that they cannot let anybody else in ?—Yes, I think that that is so. 173. But it comes to this: that you assume that the competition which British ship-owners have to meet from the Hamburg-Amerika Line is not really a commercial but is a political competition at the present moment ?—I should say so. 174. Therefore their claim for receiving a subsidy would be that you should give it not as a commercial subsidy ?—That is so. 175. But for political reasons?—You fight them with their own weapons. 176. Because the competition with which they are faced is not commercial?— Precisely. 177. If Herr Ballm has a subsidy from the German Government, it is not very clear why he should approach the British shipowners at all ?—No, it is not; and that is a point that I do not quite understand. Of course it is quite possible that the German Government said to him, “ If you start this business we will give you a subsidy for two or three years and see what you can make of it.” They may have got tired of paying this, and have told him that he must go on his own basis now ; and then he may have turned round to these English ship-owners and said, “ Let us make a pool, and see if we cannot improve things.” 178. So it is quite possible that it is bluff?—It may be. 179. And that if we staved off this crisis with a subsidy”to the ship-owners, limited, say, to a couple of years, that might be enough to bring the thing to an end ?—It might be. It might stop the Germans continuing to run. 180. Anyhow we can test it for a couple of years by giving an inducement for two years, or whatever short term is necessary, to Messrs. Strick to say “ No ” definitely to Herr Ballin, and in that way we might find out what there is in it ?—Yes, you might. 181. And we should be able to reconsider our position after that ?—Yes. You could do that for a short time. If you help them over the stile for a bit, you ’would then be able to gauge whether the Germans really meant business. 182. Captain Slade : I want to go simply to the hydrographic question in the Gulf. I suppose you have considered what you would require for lighting the Gidf, or that you have some idea what would be required ?—No, I have not gone into that at all. I only know from going up and down it two or three times myself that they have not got a light in the place. 183. I know that there is only one at Lingah, I think, which is a very trifling thing?—We should be very glad to have some lighthouses there, but I have not gone into it. 184. You have formed no idea of the cost yourself?—No, I have not. As I say, I have not gone into that at all. 185. Mr. Llovd-George : The question which was put by Sir Edward Grey is one which occurred to me, and that is, why the Germans should approach the British lines at all if they have got a strong subsidy ?—I said that to Sir Charles Hardinge some time ago. 186. The Bucknall Line is not paying, is it ?—They are not paying. 187. Are Stricks paying ?—I rather think they are, but I do not think the Bucknall Line is paying. 188. I understood you to say that a subsidized line could easily beat an un subsidized line in the Persian Gulf ?—YYs, it could. 189. They are fighting practically, I will not say an insolvent Company, but a Company that does not pay any dividend ?—Yes. 190. Why should they come to terms, if they have got a subsidy and they could easily beat them ?—I do not think the Hamburg-Amerika Line can have any idea of monopolizing the trade in the Gulf, because they have not got enough steamers ; one steamer a month is quite insufficient to carry all the trade that goes up the Gulf and back. 191. Still, if they conld beat them out of the Persian Gulf, they would rather do it than share the profits with them, would they not? I should have thought so ?—YYs,Evidence of Sir J. Mackay. 35 but I think naturally, when you are running a steamer and opposing each other, after a time you get tired of it and you want to come to some arrangement to stop the loss. It always ends in that. When you have rival lines, to begin with they fight and they are very angry with each other for a bit; then they begin to get calmer, and they come together and square their differences and share the trade. 192. I agree ; but does that not show that it is rather commercial than political? —It is probabJy commercial just now. 193. That is what I thought ?—Herr Ballin’s approaching them is probably commercial. 194. Is that not the sort of thing that really happens in any part of the world between rival Companies ? It is happening now between the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company and Herr Ballin in reference to the trade between the West Indies and New York ; they fought for years, and now they are coming to terms ?—Yes. They always do eventually. 195. Ballin’s Company is a very powerful Company, is it not ?—It is—very. 196. It made, I think, about a million and a-quarter last year ?—Yes. 197. And a million and a-half the previous year ?—Yes. They have done very well. 198. That is clean profit ?—Yes. 199. Herr Ballin’s policy is to run lines of steamers when he cannot hope to get a profitable trade for five or ten years, if there is a growing trade with a view to capturing it later on ; is that not so ?—Have you found that ? I do not know that I have found it in regard to him. 200. Has he not been doing it ?—I do not know that he has. 201. I thought he had been spreading into every part of the globe ?—He has been running about, but I do not think he has had any idea of monopolizing trades. He has run across the Atlantic, he has run out to Australia, he has run up to China, and he has run out to South America. 202. That is pretty well covering the whole world ?—Yes, it is. 203. Is that not the idea—and the Emperor encourages him ?—The Emperor does encourage him. 204. But not with subsidies ?—I think he has got subsidies. 205. Is he really subsidized to the same extent that our British ships are subsidized now to cover the mail contracts ?—Do you know how much his subsidy is ? Mr. Lloyd-Geouge : My only recollection is that there was a House of Commons inquiry four or five years ago, and they came to the conclusion that, with the exception of British East Africa, our ships were subsidized more heavily than German ships all over the world. Mr. Morley : Subsidized in the true sense of a subsidy, or paid handsomely for services ? 206. Mr. Lloyd-George : Paid handsomely for carrying the mails. Do you recollect that Committee, Sir James ?—Yes, I do. 207. Do you know whether the Singapore and Bangkok trade paid Holts ?—It did not. He was veiy glad to get rid of it. He made a very good sale of all his old ships. 208. They were losing money over it ?—He was not doing any good with them. 209. Do you think that Herr Ballin is making anything out of it ?—It is not Herr Ballin ; it is the Norddeutscher Lloyd. 210. Do you think they are making anything out of it ?—I saw the manager of it the other day, and I was asking him whether he was doing any good, and he said it was just beginning to pay now, he thought. 211. After how many years ?—They bought it about ten years ago. 212. Do you not think it is what Herr Ballin is doing here, having regard to the prospects of the trade ?—He did not buy a trade here. He started running a steamer from Hamburg up to Basra. 213. When ?—About four years ago. He started running a steamer once a month. 214. The trade is growing in the Persian Gulf?—I do not think the trade is growing very much. 215. I think the figures we had last time show that it has been growing very considerably ? Do you not think it would be a commercial speculation on his part if he thought the trade was growing ?—No ; I cannot think that it was. 216. Not four years ago?—No; I do not think so. I do not think it was a commercial speculation with him. T376J L36 Second Meeting, 6th March, 1908. 217. Was it the Emperor encouraged him ?—I think he must have been encouraged. He must have been requested to go there and make that link between Basra and Europe. It is entirely out of his line. 218. Now, when probably the Baghdad Railway seems to be rather remote, he is getting tired of it, and so he proposes to enter into terms with these two Companies ?— It may be. You would require to get exactly from Bucknall and Strick. what Herr Ball in’s proposals are. 219. You know the German State Railways indirectly subsidize trade to the East ?—By giving lower freights. 220 . Yes, through rates ?—Yes. 221. Do you think there is any subsidy, beyond that, for carrying German goods ?— As I said, I cannot say whether there is a subsidy or not, or whether there is a personal influence. Mr. Morley : In reference to what was said at our last meeting about the increase in the trade, did those figures of increase go beyoud Bahrein ?—I think they referred to Bahrein only. Sir W. Nicholson : There has been a large increase. Sir J. Mack ay : From Basra ? 222. Mr. Lloyd-George : All round. The total tonnage of entrances into the Persian Gulf, including both sailing and steam vessels, in 1895 was 835,719, and in 1906 it had gone up to very nearly two millions, namely, 1,964,639, so that it had much more than doubled ?—I think I can explain that. Under our contract with the Indian Government we doubled our service, that is, we sent two steamers a week instead of one. So that does not mean that the trade is very much increased, although you have got a large import and export tonnage. Mind, I am not prepared to stick to it; but my impression is that the exports from the Persian Gulf to Great Britain have not increased very materially. 223. The total imports into the Persian Gulf have gone up from 4,474,000Z in 1895 to 5,534,0001. in 1906 ; that is an increase of a million ?—In what time ? 224. In ten years ?—That is not very much ; it is 100,0001. a-year. 225. In 1895 the exports were 3,621,0001., and in 1906, 4,749,0001., so that the exports have gone up 1,128,0001. in the course of ten years?—That is 100,0001. each way, which is not very much. Sir VV. Nicholson : The question is, What did it start from ? 226. Mr. Lloyd-George : That is it ; it is a question of percentage. It is an increase of two millions upon eight millions ?—There has been an increase, of course. 227. It is an increase of 25 per cent, and it has been a very steadily increasing trade Is there not a certain danger in subsidizing a line of steamers to the Persian Gulf or to anywhere else ? Is it not a direct challenge ? We have got pretty well the trade of the world at the present moment, and if we start subsidizing in order to exclude the ships of our rival, is there not a real, danger that Germany and America may start to do the same thing?— You are not going to subsidize in order to exclude your rivals, are you? You are going to subsidize in order to protect your own trade against subsidized rivals. 228 I know you always say it is done in order to protect you ; but, as a matter of fact, have you not found in reference to the American Subsidy Bill that the subsidies we are giving to British shipping are being used at the present moment in the Senate by way of encouraging the Senate to give subsidies to American ships?—Yes. Mind yon, I am in no way an advocate of subsidies, except for value received. 229. That is a different matter?—As you know, my views are entirely opposed to anything in that shape. But in this case, if you find Germany, with a deliberate political motive, subsidizing steamers to run from Hamburg to Basra, in order to get an influence and to get the tail end of that line, you have got to consider whether you will not try to meet her. 230. I agree, if she is subsidizing heavily in order to exclude you ?—I think, first, you have got to ascertain whether Germany is subsidizing these Hamburg-Amerika steamers. Then you have got to ascertain what Herr Ball in’s proposals are to Strick. It seems to me to be very much in the air, and you do not know what they are. You want to get them, and you want to look into them and consider them very carefully.Evidence of Sir J. Mackay. 37 I cannot believe for a moment that Herr Ballin proposes to make what yon call a combine between the Hamburg-Amerika Line and these three, after all, very small, unimportant concerns—Strick, and Bucknall, and the West Hartlepool. The West Hartlepool have paid no dividend this last year; in fact, they passed their preference dividends. I do not think they are making any money in the Persian Gulf, and, as you say, Bucknalls are doing no good. I think you want really to get a plain and true statement of what Herr Ballin’s proposals to Strick are before you decide what to make up your mind to do. 231. Mr. Morley : Whether it is a proposal to play the Siamese waters game over again, or whether it is an honest proposal to internationalize on fair terms the trade of the Gulf ?—My impression is that it is this: “ Let us bury the hatchet and come to an agreement to charge certain rates of freight outwards and homewards, and not try to take the traffic from each other.” I think you will find that is the proposal. 232. Sir E. Grey : There is one question which arises out of Mr. Lloyd-George’s figures about the increase of the trade in the Persian Gulf. Apart from what it may be at the present moment, I suppose the increase will be enormous if Mesopotamia has a railway made through it and irrigation takes place ?-—Undoubtedly. 233. Mesopotamia is one of the greatest commercial prospects at present undeveloped in the world that there is ?—Undoubtedly. I think there will be a tremendous increase in trade there when the railway is made. 234. So the mere question of what the trade is now is a comparatively small consideration compared with the future prospects?—Quite so. There is very little room for development there until the railway is made, I think. 235. Is there a case for a postal subsidy to British ships going into the Persian Gulf?—From here ? 236. Yes ?—I am afraid not. . 237. If instead of a subsidy it is to be for services rendered, what services rendered can you suggest ?—I do not know. You get the mail out to Bombay in fourteen days from London by the P. and 0., the British India steamer is waiting with steam up to take it up the Persian Gulf, and it reaches Basra in five days thereafter, so you get the mail up there in nineteen days. A steamer would not be through the Suez Canal in that time. 238. I suppose the British India would not complain if a subsidy was given to Messrs. Strick ?—No, certainly not. I should be delighted, because if you can only establish that we shall ask you to give us a subsidy to run out to British East Africa. Sir E. Grey : There you are. That is the worst form of complaint that you can make. Mr. Lloyd-George : I think that is a much better case. 239. General Ewart : Would a combine of that character be likely to lead up to a transfer to the German flag ?—I do not see why it should not, if they get good enough terms. We should be delighted to sell some of our old ships to the Germans. But you see that would not give them a monopoly of the Persian Gulf, although they bought Strick’s ships. 240. Mr. Lloyd-George: Would it not?—No. The Persian Gulf is open to anybody. Mr. Morley : We may ask you to be good enough when you return from your holiday to come back and tell us what you think about the railway projects in Persia. That is a branch of the inquiry which we have not touched yet. [Adjourned.]Third Meeting, Wednesday, 11th March, 1908. PRESENT: The Right Hon. J. Morley, O.M., M.P., Secretary of State for India {in the Chair), The Right Hon. Sir E. Grey, Hart., M.P., Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. The Right Hon. D. Lloyd-George, M.P., President of the Board of Trade. The Viscount Esher, K.C.B., G.C.V.O. The Right Hon. Sir C. Hardinge, G.C.M.G., G.C.V.O., Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Sir R. Ritchie, K.C.B., Political and Secret Secretary, India Office. Captain E J. W. Slade, M.V.O., Director of Naval Intelligence. Major-General J. S. Ewart, C.B., Director of Military Operations. Captain Sir C. L. Ottley, K.C.M.G., M.V.O. (Secretary). Mr. Frank C. Strick, Manager of The Anglo-Algerian Shipping Company, and Mr. E. Lloyd, Managing Director of Bucknall’s Steamship Lines, attended as witnesses and were examined. Evidence of Mr. F. C. Strick. (Mr. A. Wilson Fox, C.B., of the Board of Trade, was also present.) 241. Mr. Morley : You have a line plying in the Persian Gulf, I believe?—Yes. 2'42. How long has your line been established there?—Y\ e have been there about twenty years now. 243. What is the route which your ships follow ? Where do they go to and from ? —Principally from London, Manchester, Marseilles, and the different ports of call en route for the Persian Gulf. We call at Djiboutil. 244. The Persian Gulf means what ?—Lingah, Bunder Abbas, Bushire, and Basra. We discharge cargo there, and load home from there to London or the Continent. 245. Do you come home straight ?—Yes, but sometimes via Marseilles. 240. Do you have anything to do with India ?—Very little now. 247. Your ships do not call at Karachi or Bombay, do they ?—We send them out sometimes. Occasionally, when there has been a shortage of cargo from the Gulf, we send them down to Karachi to load home. We were engaged in the Indian trade before there was the big fight which you will remember between the Hansa Line and the P. and 0. Mr. Morley : I am afraid I do not recollect. What was the big fight ? Mr. Lloyd-George : It is all on the notes. Sir James Mackay referred to it the last time. The Witness : He knows all about it. 248. Mr. Morley : Then I need not go into that. What do you think—if I may ask you a broad question of this kind—would be the effect of the Baghdad Rail way coming down to Koweit, or elsewhere, upon your own boats and trade ?—That is a question I should not like to answer right away. 249. I say it is a broad question ?—Yes, it is. 250. And, therefore, difficult to answer ?—It would facilitate the quantity of cargo undoubtedly.Evidence of Mr. F. C. Strick. 39 251. It would of course tempt the competition of German boats in the Gulf ?— Undoubtedly. 252. Supposing that arrangements were made with the German Government, or whoever controlled the Baghdad Railway, against rebates, preferential rates, and so forth, do you think that a certain advantage would come to the German boats from the fact of the line being virtually a German line?—It would increase their business. 253. In what way, exactly ?—In the produce between Baghdad and Basra, I mean. It would increase the quantity of cargo they would have to bring home. 254. Which kind of cargo ?— Grain principally. 255. Mr. Lloyd-George : How many boats have yon got in the Persian Gulf service?—We have got twenty. 256. What is the aggregate tonnage?—About 100,000. 257. What is the service? Is it done monthly?—Yes. You know we run under a pooling agreement with Buck nails. 258. If it is a monthly service between you, then yours is not monthly ?—We go monthly, each of us. 259. Does that mean a fortnightly service ?—Yes, as near as possible. 260. And you have got an arrangement with the Bucknalls, you say?—W 7 e have a pooling agreement which runs now for twelve months. The West Hartlepool Company is also in it, but then they only take a small share. 261. You started, of course, in a small way there ?—Yes. 26^. And it has grown gradually ?—Y r es. 263. Has it grown within the last two or three years ?—No, not lately. 264. Has there been any more tonnage put on lately ?—No. 265. What is the age of your youngest boat there ? Of course we have sold them and replaced them continually. We get rid of the old ones, and we replace them by larger boats more suitable for the trade. 266. That is the British method ; I know that perfectly well; we sell our old boats to the foreigner. When did Herr Ballin come in ?—About fifteen months ago, I think. Mr. Morley : What do you mean by when did he come in? 267. Mr. Lloyd-George: When did he come into the Gulf?—That is about the time. 268. We were told the last time that he came in four years ago, but the Germans were not there four years ago ?—-No. 269. The Hamburg-Amerika only came m about fifteen months ago ?—Yes. 270. Have they been cutting the rates ?—Yes, all round. 271. Y r ou have not had any understanding with them about rates, then?—No. I have had one or two interviews with Mr. George Lloyd. They are very anxious to come to an agreement with us now. 272. Is that Mr. Lloyd of BucknalTs?—No; it is Mr. Lloyd of the Board of Trade. 273. Myself?—Not yourself. I mean Mr. George Lloyd. He has given us a lot of information. Ballin was here about three weeks ago, and arranged a meeting between myself and Mr. Lloyd of Bucknalls; but as 1 had had one or two meetings with Mr. George Lloyd on the matter, I promised him I would do nothing whatever in the matter before communicating with him, and therefore I made an excuse not to attend the meetings. But since then, last week, Herr Ballin has been communicating with Mr. Lloyd and urging him to come to some arrangement with regard to an agree ment of rates. Mr. Lloyd, of Bucknalls, in fact made an arrangement to call and see me this morning about it, but I have not seen him yet. 274. That is an arrangement about rates?—For agreeing rates of freight. 275. That is not a suggestion that you should pool?—He wanted a pool first of all. That is Ballin’s main point, you know. 276. The pool not having come off for the moment, he suggested that you should agree about rates ?—YYs. 277. This is a suggestion that he has put in within the last few days ?—Y r es. It has been going on the last six months, on and off; he has been trying to get us to meet, and so forth, but we have generally kept him off. 278. What boats has he got on?—He has got about one a month. They are old boats principally. [376] M-10 Third Meeting, 11th March, 1908. 279. What size boats ?—3,000 tons. 2S0. Do they ply between Hamburg and the Gulf ?—From Hamburg and Antwerp, and they call at Marseilles. 281. 1 hey do not call at any British port, then ?—No. They have only called once on the homeward voyage to land 1,000 tons. 282. How did you pick up the continental trade for the Gulf?—It has been in existence for a good many years from Marseilles. 283. You used to pick it up at Marseilles ?—Yes, regularly. 28T You did not call at Antwerp or any of the other continental ports in the North bea ? Not until the Hamburg—Amerika Company came in. We used to bring the sugar to London for transhipment, but when they called, naturally the shipper gave the preference to the boat that called, and consequently we put in and bid against them every month. 285. Do you think that his boats are really paying him ?—No, certainly not. 280. He has not really trade enough to run a monthly boat ?—No. He gets sometimes about 300 or 400 tons of sugar at Antwerp when we do not go there, or at least during the month, but then we have got to contract ahead at Marseilles. We have got it for four years. He calls there regularly, and sometimes only gets 10 tons. 287. It is rather a cool proposal, is it not, for him with his 3,000-ton boat to come and propose to you that you should pool on the basis which he suggested some time ago? Yes. He does not suffer from modesty, I think. I may tell you he has made the remark, “ You must understand this is a philanthropic line.” tie told Lloyd, of Bucknalls, “ A\ e are going there, and we have got to go, so you can read between the lines if you like.” 288. W oidd you mind repeating that ?—In the course of a conversation he mentioned to Mr. Lloyd, of Bucknall Brothers, “ I know perfectly well there is no profit in the Persian Gulf business ; it has got to be looked upon as a philanthropic line, so to speak ; we are bound to go.” 289. He has said, “Ye are bound to go”?—Fes. So he said, “ You may read between the lines if you like.” 290. Do you think he is subsidized ?—Undoubtedly. 291. By the German Government?—Fes. Of course he would absolutely deny it, but the Hamburg-Amerika Company would not send their boats on that line to make a loss of about 30,000/. a-year—because they make every halfpenny of that. 292. Mr. Morley : Did he use language which went to this—that if you do not make a pool with him you will be bound to go ?—No. 293. Mr. Llovd-George : I should not think he could do that with his just one boat a-month. F 7 ou think he is heavily subsidized ?—I have got no right to say anything at all—no ground for saying anything at all. 294. It is only an inference you draw from what he says ?—Undoubtedly. 295. If he is heavily subsidized, would he have any motive at all for entering into pooling arrangements with you ?—His object is to get a certain amount of the trade. His difficulty is in selling any oi the Persian Gulf produce in Hamburg. There is no demand there as compared with what there is in England. 296. What about the grain, for instance ?—They cannot sell it so easily on the Continent as they can in London. 297. Would that apply to the sale of wool ?—That is only a small quantity, and that goes principally to America. 298. Does it ?— Fes, it is transhipped. 299. Would he pool the subsidies ? Did he propose that ?—No. 300. I thought he would not do that?—There was no mention about subsidy in the conversation. 301. The trade is increasing very steadily there, is it not ?—Yes, but the crop has been very bad lately. 302. That is temporary—at least, one can fairly assume that ?—Yes. 303. But there has been a steady increase in the trade through the years, has there not ? You have been making a trade there really ?—Yes. 304. ^ And the natural result has been that it has increased steadily every year ?— The Persian Gulf produce has become more generally known now than it has been in the past. The millers in England use a large quantity of the grain, which has hitherto not been taken any notice of at all.Evidence of Mr. F. C. Strick. 41 305. Is it of good quality ?—Sometimes. 306. That depends on the harvest?—It is cheap as compared with what the Black Sea grain is. 307. Has he threatened to put on another boat ?—No. 308. He has not ?—There have been no threats at all yet. 309. Are most of the goods shipped from this country to the Gulf Manchester goods ?—Yes. 310. Cotton ?—Cotton goods principally, but there is a large quantity of sugar from Marseilles and Antwerp. 311. But the Antwerp trade is such that it would not justify a boat being run even once a month ?—That is so. 312. The best trade is the Manchester trade ?—Undoubtedly. 313. And you have got that ?—Yes. VVe fill up with coal, as a rule, at Caidiff if we are short of cargo, whereas he cannot fill. 314. Coal for what purpose ?—To bunker the boats on the Persian Gulf. 315. He cannot get that ?—No. They tried German coal there, but so far it has not been any good there. 316. The quality is not equal to that of Cardiff coal, is it?—No. 317. And it could not compete, could it?—No. 318. So you have every advantage as against him ?—Undoubtedly so long as they are going to remain on the Continent, you understand. If he brings his boats back to London, that would be another matter. 319. How is that ?—Up to the present, with one exception, all their steamers have loaded direct for the Continent—that is, for the Suez Canal, Marseilles, Antwerp, and Hamburg. They have only called once at London, where they discharged a small parcel of about 1,000 tons. 320. Supposing he called at London, he could not get the Manchester goods, nor could he get the Cardiff coal, could he ?—He can get the Cardiff coal, of course, if he likes, by fighting. 32!. Hardly here, could he?—Yes. 322. Do you not pick it up at Cardiff ?—Yes. It would simply be a fight between the Hamburg-Amerika and ourselves then. 323. But he would pick up the Cardiff coal here, surely, plus the railway freightage, which would be very heavy from Cardiff to here ?—I beg your pardon ; I am supposing that he berths his boats at Hamburg for London, Cardiff, and the Gulf. 324. He would have to call at Cardiff ?—Undoubtedly. 325. So he could not pick up the coal here ?—No. 326. In any event he could not get the Manchester goods?—No. 327. And they constitute the bulk of the trade there ?—They are taking some by transhipment—a very small quantity, you know—in steamers loaded in Liverpool for Hamburg, where it is transhipped into the boats of the Hamburg-Amerika. 328. About the lighterage service in the Persian Gulf, is it good or bad ?— Lighterage ? 329. Yes, take that ?—Anything does for that. There are one or tw r o old boats out there. They are only about 18 feet on the bar, and some of the steamers draw about 21 ; consequently you have got to employ some old steamers. We send out from here to 330. To Bushire ?—No, not to Bushire, but to Basra. 331. What do you do at Bushire ?—We call there on the way home. 332. Herr Ballin picks up his outward cargo at Antwerp, does he not?—At Hamburg and Antwerp. 333. What sort of stuff could he get to bring back— grain which he could not take to Germany because there is no trade in it ?—He takes a large quantity of barley and paddy back. 334. The Hamburg-Amerika does that for Germany ?—Y r es. 335. Barley ?—Yes, barley. He has only a limited market for that barley ; but a large quantity of paddy has come in lately. 336. Now about the xManchester trade, has there been any question of the shippers asking for lower rates ? —They have always been doing that, but they are all bound up to us by contract. I entered into a new contract to commence next year for six years ahead with all the principal shippers. Mr. Morley : What contract is that ?42 Third Mp:eting, 11th March, 1908. 337. Mr. Lloyd-George : It is a contract with the Manchester shippers for Manchester goods. (To the witness) Does that insure the trade for you?—Yes. 338. It secures you the trade ?—Yes. 339. They are bound to send it by your line ?—Yes. 340. So the Hamburg-Amerika cannot possibly cut in ?—He may berth boats, if you understand me, and drop rates against us a little, but that is all. 341. Now about the lights in the Persian Gulf. Are there any lights there at all ?— I think not. That is a question I should not like to answer. 342. It is on the whole badly lit, anyhow?—It is, really. 343. Somebody suggested there might be a lighthouse at Muscat; would it be worth your while paying light dues, say at Bahrein? Do you call at Bahrein?—Me do on transhipment. Any small quantity that I have for Bahrein we tranship at Bushire. 344. Where do you call ?—We call at Muscat. 345. That will do. Would it be worth your while, in order to maintain a light house there, paying any light dues, or are you satisfied with the lighting?—We have never had any difficulty yet. 34(1. So you do not care ?—No. 347. There is no demand really for a lighthouse ?—No. 348. Are there enough buoys in the Gulf ?—The buoys are all shifting. The only buoys I know of are simply on the bar, but that bar is constantly shifting. 349. You have never had any trouble with your ships at all, have you?—You could not go there without continually running on the bar. The navigation there is very difficult ; the bar is always shifting. 350. If any buoys or lighthouses are set up there you must have some means of raising a revenue, and the only way to raise a revenue is by charging some sort of light dues, say at Muscat or Bahrein or at one of the other ports of call. Do you think it is worth your while ?—Undoubtedly—especially at the bar. 351. You mean it would be worth your while to buoy the bar?—YYs. 352. But about the lights, you do not care ?— We have never had any difficulty yet. 353. Mr. Morley : Do you have any trouble about customs dues with the Persian Customs at Bushire, and so on ?—No. 354. You do not go down the south side of the Gulf, do you ? You go to Bunder Abbas and Bushire, but those ports are all on the Persian and not on the Arabian side of the Gulf ?—We go to no other places, with the exception of Muscat. That is the only place we call at between Aden and the Gulf. 355. When you get into the Gulf, then, you do not call on the Arabian side?—No, we do not. 35G. You do not go to Koweit ?—No. 357. Supposing the Baghdad Railway were constructed and came down to Koweit or some place near Koweit, that would effect you materially, would it not ? Goods could then be brought overland all the way down the Baghdad Railway to the Gulf, and that surely would be a mode of transport prejudicial to your ships ?—I do not know, because Koweit has a splendid harbour. 358. I am not quite on that ; I am on what would be the effect of a land transport all the way down, say from Constantinople to Koweit, upon your shipping ?—It woidd affect the shipping to a very great extent, undoubtedly. It would be a question of freight. 359. It would be prejudicial to your ships ?—Y T es, it would. 360. Except that sea transport is much cheaper than an expensive long railway transport ?—YYs. You are talking more particularly about Manchester goods, are you not ? 361. Yes ; because you said that Manchester goods Avere the chief articles of commerce ?—And sugar. 362. It is French sugar from Marseilles ?—Yes. 363. And Manchester goods and Cardiff coal from here ?—Yes. 364. I rather want to know whether the trade in Manchester goods that you now carry would or would not be seriously affected by the Baghdad Railway ?—I do not think it would. 365. Because the expense avouM be too great ?—Yes. 366. Mr. Lloyd-George : Would not the Baghdad Railway rather develop the grain trade of Mesopotamia ?—Yes, certainly.Evidence of Mr. F. C. Strick. 43 367. And so improve, at any rate, your return cargo ?—Undoubtedly. 368. What else could you get there besides grain—wool ?—Liquorice root; and then in the season there are generally about 50,000 tons of dates. 369. Mr. Morley : Dates are a great article there, are they not ?—Yes, for about two months in the year. 370. They find their way in large quantities, we were told, to America?—Yes, we take three cargoes every year. 371. To America ?—Yes, to New York direct. 372. Mr. Lloyd-George : Which is the West Hartlepool Company ?—It is located at West Hartlepool 373. They trade in the Persian Gulf, do they not?—They have got a small share in our pool. 374. Are they not raising some difficulties in the way of arriving at an arrangement about rates ?—They have not a voice to say on the matter. That is left entirely as between ourselves and Bucknalls. We manage the business. 375. Mr. Morley : The Indian trade is not in your hands, I think ?—Not now. 376. It is chiefly in the hands of the British India, is it not ?—Yes. 377. They tranship from the P. and O. at Bombay or Karachi, and then send it to the Gulf ?—Yes ; but a very small quantity goes up there now, because they have got more cargo than they can carry themselves at Bombay. 378. I do not think I understand?—They have got more cargo than they can carry themselves at Bombay at the present minute. There is very little transhipment cargo up the Gulf. 379. The P. and O. do not go near the Gulf, do they ?—No. 380. It is all transhipped into the British India ?—Yes, but the British India only take a small quantity of cargo. 381. Mr. Lloyd-Geohge : Do you carry any mails ?—No. 382. Is there any mail worked there at all ?—Yes, by the British India. 383. The mails are carried by the British India from Bombay ?—l^es, and they take time for it. 384. Could you carry the letters in less time there ?—We have a regular service, and of course we could. 385. How often do they run up ?—Once a week. 386. Sir Edward Grey : I am sorry I was not able to be here at the beginning, so I may be asking questions that have already been asked. Have you thought very mucb about what the effect of the Baghdad Railway would be ?—I have not. 387. You have not taken it into your calculations yet ?—I have not. 388. I supx&gt;ose if it developed Mesopotamia very much it would increase the amount of trade in the Persian Gulf?—Undoubtedly. 389. Have you any idea why the Germans are taking so much more active interest in the Persian Gulf trade than they did some years ago ?—My private opinion is that it is a political move and nothing else. 390. What do you mean by a political move ?—To get a status there. 391. To get a status in the Persian Gidf ?—Yes. 392. With the object of doing what afterwards?—I do not know. 393. You do not think it is simply for the sake of commercial development ?—No. 394. Supposing the Baghdad Railway was going to develop the interior of Mesopotamia veiy considerably, the Persian Gulf trade would be a much more important trade than it is now ?—Yes. 395. Therefore it might be from that point of view a commercial move on the part of the Germans foreseeing that the Gulf trade would become a very important thing, and consequently that it would be very desirable that they should be well into it before the development occurs ?—Yes, possibly. 396. You have been conscious that they have been taking a much more active interest lately ?—Yes. 397. Have freights been reduced since they took a more active interest ?—Yes, both outward and homeward. That is where they are very anxious to come to an arrangement with us now. 398. Have you been asked already what your idea is of the arrangement the [376] N44 Third Meeting, 11th March, 1908. mermans wish to propose ? First of all, they wanted ns to go into a pooling agree ment, and for the present they say they would be contented with one-quarter of the trade. I think Mr. George Lloyd has made a report on the Gulf. I gave him a lot of in ormation from time to time, and 1 told him that I would not make any arrangement with them before communicating with him. Within only the last few days HerrBallin has written to London and expressed a desire, if there was no chance of making a pooling agreement, that an agreement of rates should be come to. 399. that would be a less formidable thing than a pooling ?—Yes. 400. What would happen simply from an agreement on rates? I suppose not much would happen ?—It would raise the rates of freight, and, of course, if an arrangement was come to on that basis we could limit the number of his sailings. At the present moment they have got one boat a month. 401. It would not necessarily alter the proportions of the trade ?—No. 403. And it would not have any political consequences ?—I do not think so. 403. Do you think a pooling arrangement would have any ?—It would be altogether complicated. 404. It is too complicated to have a pooling arrangement, you mean ?—Yes. That is admitting one into the trade at once. 405. So you think the real question is whether or not you come to an agreement with Herr nallin about rates ?—Yes. 40b. I hat is the practical question which you have to consider?—Yes. 407. Sir 0. Hardinge : Are the rates of the Hamburg-Amerika Line at present lower than yours ?—They are. They take any rate they can get to the Continent so long as they can fill their boats up to Hamburg. 408. then they are lower ? Yes. If they call at London it would be a direct fight at once. . 4 °9- Mr. Morley : We have heard something on this Committee about the desirableness of putting wireless telegraph stations in the Gulf ; have you thought of that at all ?—I have not. 410. Not at all ?—No. Of course, any points that you want me to look into I will do so with pleasure. . 411. ^ on might just find out whether there is anything to be said about providing wireless telegraph stations in the Gulf, would you ?—Yes. 412. Now about lights, it has been suggested to us that a light on Musandim promontory and various other lights would be very useful; you answered the President of the Board of liade in a general way, but would you mind asking your captains both about lights and wireless telegraph stations ?—I will do so, certainly.' 413. Mr. Lloyd-George : If you had an arrangement about rates would that involve an arrangement as to what ports you should call at for your cargo ? For instance, would it involve an arrangement that you should not go to Antwerp to pickup the Continental trade, and that they should not come here to pick up yours ?—That is what I expect they will stipulate for. (The witness withdrew.) Evidence of Mr. E. Lloyd, Managing Director of Bucknall’s Steamship Lines. 414. Mr. Morley : Are you the Managing Director of the Persian Gulf branch of Bucknall Brothers ?—I am a partner of Bucknall Brothers, and the Bucknall Steam-ship Lines have a steam-ship service with the Persian Gulf. I am Managing Director of the whole of the affairs of the Bucknall Steam-ship Lines. 415. Will you tell us where those lines work?—Yes. We have a line running from this country and the Continent to South Africa. 41G. From which part of the Continent?—From Hamburg and Antwerp. Then we have a line running from New York to Australia and New Zealand ; a line running from New York to the Far East, Manchuria, China, and Japan ; a line running from India (Calcutta and Ceylon) to the United States; and, during the wool season, we have a line running from Australia to this country and the Continent. We have usuallyEvidence of Mr. E. Lloyd. 45 forty to fifty steamers of from 0,000 to 10,000 tons each trading for us over the world generally. The Persian Gulf business is a small part of the business, but it is an important one in many respects. -117. We here to-day are more concerned with the Persian Gulf. In what respects is that business important ?—It is important to us in that it has been a line that we have had for a great number of years, and we have had lots of ups and downs. Then it is important in that it is so small, and we are able to give personal attention to it, and have a knowledge of things which perhaps is denied to us over more comprehensive trading. 418. Will you tell us more particularly, then, apart from all these great operations of yours, what you do in the Persian Gulf ?—In the Persian Gulf we work more or less in conjunction with the firm of Frank C. Strick and Co., and we sail alternately with them, sending steamers out to the Gulf and loading steamers home from the Gulf. 419. You say, “more or less in conjunction with them”; would you tell us precisely what you mean ?—I do not know that in all our operations we are precisely of the same way of thinking. Sometimes we have our differences, when perhaps it might be said we are not entirely in conjunction with them. But I think you may take it that at the present time, at all events—shipping arrangements do not last very long without some upheaval—we are perfectly friendly and are running together with them in the Persian Gulf trade, meeting as far as we can the undesirable opposition of the Hamburg-Amerika Line there. 420. Your conjunction would be very close as against the Hamburg-Amerika?— Quite close. 421. To what extent has the Hamburg-Amerika affected you ?—It has affected us in two ways—in one way in so far as cargo which it has carried both out and home in its steamers would have been carried by us; and in the other way the very fact of its being in evidence brings the rates of freight down, which is not welcome to us. 422. Cargo that would otherwise have been carried by you ?—Has been carried by them. 423. But it is not very large in extent, is it ?—No, it would not be of great volume. Taking the cargo home from the Gulf first, I think they have loaded twelve steamers in the year. 424. That is one a month ?—About one a month. I cannot fix the date from the Gulf because tidal questions have a bearing there as well, but with more or less regularity they have loaded twelve steamers. You mb ht put them perhaps at about 4,000 tons each steamer; that is 50,000 tons of cargo, I should say, that we should have provided tonnage for and should have carried. It might have acted in another way. We have had to send some of our steamers from the Persian Gulf down to India to load home; if we had had this 50,000 tons of cargo perhaps they would not have done that. 425. Do you, then, unlike Strick Brothers, have an Indian trade with the Gulf?— We have no Indian trade with the Gulf. A steamer having got to the Persian Gulf, and finding we cannot get cargo home for her, we have to send her down in ballast to India in order to load her home. 426. From India?—Yes. 427. Do you take what Mr. Strick takes—Manchester goods ?—Yes, we share that trade jointly with him. 428. And you do nothing that he does not do ?—Practically you may take it that we do nothing that he does not do. 429. Do you take sugar at Marseilles ?—We have the contract for the Marseilles sngar. My firm have always handled that contract, at least for many years now. 430. Do you think the Hamburg-Amerika could not hold its head above water without Government aid ?—Do you mean as a whole, or do you mean in connection with the service in the Persian Gulf ? 431. In connection with the Persian Gulf ?—I am quite convinced on that point. I would not like to say there is Government aid direct to its trifling trade in the Persian Gulf. I have spoken to Herr Ballin on this very business. You know Herr Ballin, of course. 432. By name, well ?—Herr Ballin has told me that he looks upon it as a philan thropic side of the Hamburg-Amerika operations. 433. He is ironic when he says that ?—Of course. He meant to say that he could make no profits and hoped for no profits in the trade. 434. Why does he carry it on then ?—On account of policy. It is a political line. He used that term to me.46 Third Meeting, 11th March, 1908. 485. What does he quite mean by (hat?—It means that the line is directed by some force behind. He has never taken up that line for any advantage it would be to the Hamburg-Amerika Company, which is too great to notice a thing of the kind. 436. Directed towards what exactly ?—As I understand, towards the development of German commerce in that quarter of the globe. 487. Do you think that is with a view to the completion of the Baghdad Railway one of these days—to prepare the way for that ?—I would not say it is with a view to that, but 1 dare say it is part of the same programme. I think probably the comple tion of the Baghdad Railway may also have ulterior objects—something beyond that. I think the shipping might be viewed as running almost parallel with the completion of that railway. 438. 11 you could choose from your own point of view of your own interests I suppose you would rather the Baghdad Railway was never heard of ?—Yes, I think so, so far as I understand the position. 439. It cannot he other than more or less injurious to you ?—So I understand ; but I would not like to speak with any degree of definiteness, because I am not well acquainted with the local conditions there. I have had my manager of the Persian Gulf department out in the Persian Gulf, and if it were of any interest to you I should be very pleased, of course, for him to come before you. He was over there two years ago, or three years ago, and I think he took a very intelligent observation of many of the features affecting English commerce out there. 440. Ion are at present holding your own with a vengeance against the Hamburg- Amenka : ^ es, ve aie doing that. Y\ e shall always be able to do that so long as we do not mind the losses. 141. Sir C. Grey . I hat is Herr Ballins point of view too ?—There must come an end to it some day. \\ e cannot hope to drive them off it as we should do in an ordinary way of business ; that is beyond us, and we do not dream of that. Therefore we have to look for one of two things—either that they will see its inutility from a' commercial point of view and withdraw, or that we shall be driven to make arraime- ments with them. &amp; . ^ ki n d of arrangements?—Arrangements to work at agreed rates and a division of the trade possibly. 443. Would that be injurious to the trade—1 mean to the people who produce Manchester goods, for example ?—Not to the Manchester goods trade, I think, at all. 1 think it would affect more particularly the hardware trade, in so far as that is an article of export. Germany does not export any cotton goods in competition with Manchester, l understand. 444. But steel and iron they do ? It might be injurious to anything of that chaiacter, and it might be injurious to English interests in so far as it would establish a permanency in German markets for Persian Gulf products. Until the arrival of the Ham burg-A me n ka Line of course the German markets lacked that facility; with the arrival ol the Hamburg—America lane there has been given an impetus to Hamburg as a centre of trade for that. I have seen Persian Gulf products which formerlv came tt i 0n , an ^ fhen were transhipped as required to Germany, now going direct to Hamburg. . . M t r - Llovd-George : The bulk of your business is outside the Persian Gulf is it not ?—Entirely. 446. Mr. Strick, I think, is more or less confined to the Persian Gulf, is he not ?— 1 should sa} it is the major portion of his trade. He has a business with India and he runs a line there—I do not know how often, but he goes once a month or something like that. &amp; II '. H he were driven out of the Persian Gulf the major part of his business would • 1 think the major part of his business would disappear. Hare the Hamburg—Amerika up to the present done anything more than carry German trade to and from the Persian Gulf ? Have they attacked the British trade in the Gulf ?—-No, _ they have not made an attempt to attack. They have taken some goods, 1 think in fact, I am sure of it—from Manchester by transhipment to Hamburg. Only to-day, speaking up to date, 1 had a telephone message from Manchester that the Hamburg-Amerika Line were offering to take goods from Manchester through to the Persian Gulf at a rate below that which we have in force ; and our agents at Manchester were asking me for instructions what to do under the circumstances—were they to see the cargo go by transhipment to Germany.Evidence of Mr. E. Lloyd. 47 440. Does that refer to Manchester goods ?—Yes. 450. Manchester goods which are sent to Germany to be transhipped?—No r Manchester goods simply for carriage, which would be shipped in our steamer from Manchester ordinarily, but owing to the offer of a lower rate of freight to the shipper by the Hamburg-Amerika Line, the shipper says, “ I might as well book these goods with the Hamburg- Amerika Line and save my 5s.,” or whatever it may be, per ton on the freight. 451. How are the goods taken from Manchester to Hamburg in the first instance? —By transhipment; I think by water. 452. Entirely by water ?—I am not sure whether they do not sometimes send them across country to Goole or Grimsby, and then take the shorter water route. 453. Could you find that out? —I could find that out.* 454. I should rather like it if you would ?—Yes, I will. 455. Mr. Morle y : Have the Manchester shippers invited the Hamburg-Amerika to call there ?—Shippers would always do that. 456. Mr. Lloyd-George : Naturally they would do that; it is to their advantage to have as many lines as possible for their trade ?—Yes, and to create competition. At the same time I do not think they have any real desire for it; I think it is simply to point an argument that they do it. 457. Still, up to the present they have not attacked the British trade with the Persian Gulf directly ? —No, not directly. They have made—I must say this in justice to them—no attack upon the British trade. Herr Ballin spoke very strongly to me on that point, and in fact he resented our interference, as he called it. They had stepped upon the scene to develop German trade and German connections. 4-&gt;8. If they are carrying British produce at a lower rate, to that extent they are developing Manchester trade with the Persian Gulf?—As a shipowner desiring to get a higher rate I could not assent to that. 459. No, you could not assent to that proposition ?—It would have a disturbing effect, at all events. I do not know that any more goods would go by reason of bs. per ton in the freight being saved temporarily. 460. I think we had it from Mr. Strick that the trade with the Persian Gulf has grown very considerably during the last twenty years ?—Very considerably ; I should say during the last ten years too. 461. During the last ten years ?—Yes; I should say there has been a considerable growth. 462. What about the last five years ?—I would not like to speak about those without reference. I presume you have some data on that point. 463. I think we may take it that it has grown. Has your aggregate tonnage grown in the Gulf ?—We do not ear-mark the tonnage specifically for the Gulf. We make use of the steamers as they come round. 464. You do not send any specific steamers down there, then?—No; we do noi own steamers particularly marked for it, although we keep two more or less in it regularly, and we supplement those with other tonnage as required. 465. Are those your older boats ?—There are two modern boats, and two older boats. 466. Why do you consider the prospect of the Baghdad Railway as being injurious to your trade in the Gulf?—I have expressed an opinion that I have formed upon information given to me by my manager of that department, but I do not think I could now give^ you the grounds upon which 1 have formed that opinion. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the intentions of the railway, nor where it connects up, and I can only say that I have a general opinion that it would not be an advantage to our shipping business. 467. Would it not develop the trade in the Gulf ?—Perhaps you could tell me where it would connect up in the Gulf from Baghdad. 468. Assume, jf you like, Koweit ?—I should have imagined it would be otherwise, but probably I might say that the apprehension of its being controlled by German influences might have been one reason for my manager giving me the impression that he did. 469. kou mean that if special through rates are given to German ships that, of course, would hit you very hard ?—That would be so. If Germany got control of the [376] * See Question 798, p. 71. 0t 48 Third Meeting, 11 th March, 1908. railway, we should assume that, in the same way that they grant special terms on the German State Railways, which we feel in other trades, so they would be used against British shipping here in the same way as you know it is being used from Hamburg to East Africa. 470. Yes, and they are giving special rates for the Levantine trade?—Yes, they are for the Levant. Therefore the view which I have formed may be anti-German. 471. If you could pick up your trade there on equal terms with the Germans, surely it would be an advantage to you ?—I think it would, and so would anything that would give facility of trading. 472. It would increase the quantity of goods brought from the interior?—Yes. Speaking generally, I think that the opposition I have expressed to the Baghdad Railway must have been anti-German, probably. 473. Do you know anything about the lighting in the Persian Gulf?—Not in detail, except that it is unsatisfactory. 474. Would it be worth your while paying any sort of light dues in order to improve the lighting in the Gulf ?—I should think not. 475. It would not be worth while ?—No ; we have run through for so many years without any mishap there that I would prefer to continue it, and let some of the new comers see the disadvantages of that benighted navigation. 476. What about improving the buoys ?—I think something might be done in that way—indeed, I think it ought to be done. 477. But it could not be done unless you had a revenue ?—Exactly. The revenue could be raised on the goods that go in there. It should be a service which should be performed by the local authorities. 478. What sort of local authorities?—They have some sort of local authority at Bushire, which is Persian, I suppose. I do not know that they would ever apply the money, but they might collect it on the goods. 479. on prefer that it should be collected on the goods rather than on the ships ? —I think it would be unusual to collect it from the ships, and I do not think you could get much from the ships. 480. For the buoys, do you mean ?—Yes. YY&gt;u see the shipping is so small in extent there. 481. You would not want very much of a revenue to improve the buoys, would you?—If it were a small matter, probably we should not complain. 482. What is your aggregate tonnage in the course of a year in the Gulf trade ?— I should think it would be 60,000 tons. I should not think it was more ; it would be about that, I should say. 483. Y\ hat about the facilities for landing goods at Bushire ? Do you know any thing about that ?—Yes, I understand that they are extremely unsatisfactory. We had a scheme in hand some few years ago for coming to some sort of an arrangement with the Sheikh there to make a Landing Company, but it did not succeed. 484. \\ as that due to any difficulties he put in your way?—I think it was due to local jealousies there. 485. Do you call at Bahrein ?—Yes, if there is anything for us we have done so, but there is no regular need for calling there. There is only a certain amount of shell trade, I think, at Bahrein, and that is, I think, chiefly for German account. I think the German market deals with the shells more than the English market does. 4S6. The Hamburg—Amerika Company is a Company which is well in with the Government, is it not ?—With the German Government, undoubtedly. 487. They are not directly subsidized, are they ?—I do not know in what way they get their support, but that they get it we have no sort of doubt at all. 488. What kind of support do you mean—moral support or financial support ?—I think both. 489. Both ?—Yes. I think moral support goes a long way. The mere fact that they are persona grata with the Kaiser, if you like, brings all the banks to their back with support. 490. Do they need any banking support now with their profit of a million and a quarter a year ? 1 ou see it was a million and a quarter last year, although there was a drop, as in the previous year it was a million and a-half ?—I think those extravagant profits were due largely to the Russo-Japanese War. 491. In this last year ?—I think their profits are on the wane. 492. I know they are a quarter of a million less than last year ?—I think part of the profits last year would be balances brought forward from the previous year. 493. 4ou do not think it is a bond fide trading profit, then ?—No, I am sure it is not—not to that extent.Evidence of Mr. E. Lloyd. 49 he ist to ey is, iat BS. ad in to ITS W- at ue be at he 3? Id in Id be y- id th to ;o, &gt;11 ik le ^y -I at ik a re 36 of is 494. Mr. Morley : Have you had any trouble with your boats about quarantine in the Gulf ?—Occasionally we get trouble. 495. What sought of trouble?—They take it into their heads to imagine that 'we have plague on board with some of the crew, and then you are told to lie off. Of course, you have no redress and no appeal. We simply lie there in patience until somebody can get ashore with stronger influence, when we get rid of this plague very easily. 496. You can get rid of the plague by influence, you say ?—Certainly; and then we get admitted. 497. Captain Slade : Where would you fix the terminus of the Baghdad Railway ? —I have no knowledge on that point. 498. Have you not formed any opinion ?—No, not at all. 499. Not what is the most likely place ?—No, I have not. 500. Do your ships go up to Basra ?—Yes, every ship goes up to Basra. 501. What water do they draw going up?—Loaded, they would draw anything from 21 to 23 or 24 feet. 502. And have you no difficulty on the bar with that draught ?—We never cross the bar with that draught. We cross the bar at about 17 feet. We keep a steam lighter out there. 503. That is what I was coming to ; what arrangements do you have for lighterage there?—We have a steam lighter of about 1,400 tons, a small steamer that we keep in the Persian Gulf. She awaits the arrival of each steamer, and if the steamer is beyond the bar draught she relieves her of the cargo. 504. Then practically the deepest draught ship that wdll take the bar at Basra is 17 feet?—I think you may take it at 17 feet, but then that draught w r ould not be sufficient for ocean-going ships, so that you may consider it is essential to have a certain amount of lighterage in doing the Persian Gulf trade. 505. Sir E. Grey : It was your manager, you said, wdio had gone into the question of the Baghdad Railway ?—Yes, and I think he could speak with greater advantage than I could on it, because he has local knowledge which I do not possess. 506. There is a feeling in the East that, apart from the question of any special rebates or special favours given to trade in a particular country on which you could put your finger, the mere fact of the control of communications favours the merchants, and so forth, belonging to the country which has the control ?—I should think that would follow. 507. As a general idea, would you say that trade follows the control of the means of communication ?—I have always held that trade follows the flag, and that means practically the same thing ; it is synonymous, I think, with your expression. 508. Of course it could not be the flag in this case ?—If it were an English interest it would represent the English flag, and if it were a German interest it would represent the German flag. 509. If you had a railway which was German all the way through, do you think the German merchants would eventually do all the trade, and that our people would not go there ?—I think that must be so. German shipping would develop the trade to the exclusion of British shipping. You see, they make railway rates which are applicable only to German shipping loading at Hamburg at the present time ; there are railway rates in existence which are not available for British ships, and which are only available for German ships.50 Fourth Meeting, Tuesday, 17th March, 1908.

Sir Louis Dane, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Secretary to the Foreign Department of the Govern ment of India, attended as a witness and was examined. Evidence of Sir L. Dane. 510. Mr. Mo rle\ : You have been for a considerable time in charge of the Foreign Department in India?—Since November 1902. 511. You know that this Committee has been called upon to consider British Intelests in the Persian Gull, and possibly also the expediency of railway concessions following the arrival of the Baghdad Railway ?—Yes. 512. In 1907 this language was used by the Foreign Office to the India Office after the Russian Convention was signed : “In these circumstances, it seems advisable that His Majesty’s Government should take into early consideration the question of a possible attempt to extend the Baghdad Railway into Southern Persia, with a view to determining whether a Concession of this nature to other Powers should be opposed, or whether it should be forestalled by timely action on the part of His Majesty’s Govern ment, who, by securing prior rights of construction, might render an extension of the Baghdad Railway under foreign auspices economically undesirable.”* Have you any observation to make from the point of view of the Government of India on that way of stating the case ? Ihe Government of India, of course, have been very much interested in this, and have been thinking about it for the last four years. We have had several routes surveyed in Southern Persia, and there was considerable difference of opinion as to what was the best thing to do ; but if I may be allowed to state my personal opinion, I venture to suggest that it might be desirable to do something of this kind as regards that—a railway from Mohammerah or Hawdzeh via Ahwaz to Shiraz with a branch to the sea. 513. Perhaps before you go to that, in this same paper from the Foreign Office to the India Office certain suggestions were made ?—Those practically comprise almost exactly what we had been considering for a considerable time, but there was a great difference of opinion. oi l. r l he first is a railway from Bunder Abbas to Shiraz. What do you say to that . J -—1 would not put that in the first place, though there is a possible line there. Captain A\ ilson has surveyed that line and found it quite a possible line. If I might ventuie to have an opinion at all, I should think it would be better to begin at the further end, from Mohammerah. 515. But would you mind taking these routes, as they are mentioned in the Foreign Ollice letter, not as one thing being more desirable than another, but because they are in that order on the paper ?—The route from Bunder Abbas to Shiraz would be very useful in a way commercially, but 1 do not think it would be so commercially * Quoted from Foreign Office Confidential Memorandum (9161), Appendix 2, p. 163.Evidence of Sir L. Dane. 51 useful as the other route, and I do not think, judging from what one hears from the Indian Intelligence Branch, it would be strategically so desirable. 516. What would be the economic advantages or commercial advantages?—Of the Shiraz to Bunder Abbas route ? 517. I do not say “ advantages,” but what would be the working of it ?—Of course, at present the great difficulty is that the only route by which we can get the trade in is from Bushire, which is a most impossible route. It can only be covered by mules, and that with the greatest difficulty. Any railway that enables you to get to Shiraz, that is, on the Persian plateau, from which there is a road traversable by wheeled vehicles to Isfahan, would be an immense advantage so far as trade is concerned. It would get over the most expensive portion of the route. The question really seems to be which is the best commercial route to adopt to reach Shiraz. ! he Bunder Abbas-Shiraz rout© would undoubtedly be a very good route, and it is feasible. But at the same time it does not prevent the intrusion of a foreign railway, by which I mean a railway not constructed under British auspices, from the west. There is another feasible route, which was surveyed by Captain Hopkins as long ago as 1902 he is a railway expf.it, with great experience in hill lines—which commences from Mohammerah and^ passes through a place called Behbehan, and eventually reaches Shiraz through this route (pointing on map)* The ruling gradient of that line would be 1 in 40, and it would have this advantage, that it would not only take up all trade that now goes to Bushire, but it would probably take up a good deal of the trade which at present goes up the Shat-el-Arab, and if that line w^ere constructed it would render it practically impossible for any foreign line to be brought into that south-western corner of Persia. 518. Why ?—Because it cuts right across the line coming from the north down to the Gulf, and if one such railway from the west were constructed upon a suitable alignment, it would be—at least I am speaking of course from my own opinion—almost commercially impossible to make a second line. It would occupy the whole ground. 519. By a line coming from the north you mean the Baghdad Railway, for example?—No, I am speaking from the Persian side. There is a possibility of the Baghdad Railway being taken across the Shat-eTArab into Persia, and so to the Gulf, but as far as I know the Germans have not got a Concession for that. The great object, as far as commerce goes, in those parts, is to get British goods on to the Persian plateau, at Shiraz for preference ; and no doubt an extension of our commerce would invariably lead to an extension of our influence. 520. Why do you prefer Shiraz ?—It is one of the most fertile portions of Persia. It is w 7 ell within the neutral zone/ Our influence there is practically predominant, and it is a very good centre, not only for distributing goods, but also, practically, as far as the information in the possession of the Government of India goes to show, it is astride of any eventual extension of the Baghdad Railway, or a line connecting with the Baghdad Railway, into Southern and Eastern Persia. There is, of course, a northerly route through Yezd and Kerman to Kermanshah, but that is of course now entirely beyond any possibility of British action. 521. By reason of the Convention?—Yes. 522. Sir C. Hardinge : We can go right up to Yezd?—Yes ; but you cannot go from Yezd to Isfahan. That is what I mean. Perhaps I might mention to you that the possibility of a railway of this kind was seen by Sir Frederick Goldsmid years ago, but it never was taken up until 1902, when Captain Hopkins, at his own expense, made this survey. I believe he is a thoroughly reliable railway engineer—at least he has been employed on a great many hill projects—and I suppose, as far as it goes, his word may be taken as a fact that there is a possible route from Mohammerah to Shiraz by Behbehan. 523. Mr. Morley : You have thought no doubt a great deal, and constantly in Indian Councils, of the possibility of uniting the Indian Railway system with the Baghdad Railway?—Yes. In existing circumstances the feeling at present prevailing in military circles in India is that it is undesirable to do it, if we can possibly avoid doing so. ... 524. You regard the Baghdad Railway from a military point of view as an entirely inconvenient appearance ?—We should very much sooner not have any railway theie at all; but as it seems a certainty that it will come there, of course we are very anxious to make it as innocuous as possible from an Indian point of view. 525. What has India to fear precisely ?—India has to fear two things. The first. [376] * See Appendix 10, p. 270. P* See Appendix 10, p. 270. 52 Fourth Meeting, 17th March, 1908. which is the most obvious, but probably the most remote contingency, a line being extended from the Baghdad Railway through Persia to the Afghan and Baluchistan frontier. 1 he difficulties of the route are such that, as far as one can see, it is not likely that that would take place for some years. We have also got to guard against what we have always apprehended as a more immediate consequence, and that would be the formation of a port, nominally a commercial port, at the head of the Gulf, but which, in the course of time, would attract foreign squadrons there, and inevitably lead to a demand for an increase of British naval strength in those waters. 520. A demand by whom ? I he public generally, also the Indian Government no doubt, and it might also lead to a demand on the Government of India for an increase of the subsidy they pay of 100,0001. a-year towards the British Navy. Of course, we were informed some years ago—I dare say you remember, Sir—that we should have to be prepared, in the event of an outbreak of war with a European Power, for the loss of the command of the sea east of Aden for a considerable period, which might even extend to two months. Assuming that there was a commercial port at the head of the Gulf, and that a foreign squadron or squadrons were kept cruising in the Gulf, there might be a certain amount of risk (and, of course, one cannot say how serious the risk would be) of these squadrons appearing upon the coast of India, and possibly even bombarding an Indian seaport. Any such result would have a most disastrous effect upon native public opinion in India. Any intelligent native in India has in the past held it as an axiom that we are supreme upon the seas, and if, even for a temporary period, they found a foreign squadron able to bombard an Indian port, it would be a very severe upsetting of their preconceived notions. Of course, I do not suppose for an instant that any serious damage could be done b} T a small squadron of that kind. As soon as we recovered command of the seas, at any rate, it would be swept off the Indian seas. But the amount of damage that would be done in the ideas of the people would be very great indeed, I think. 527. But then in this Committee we are not so much concerned with the ideas of the people ; but as to precise military or great commercial disadvantages ?—It would be rather a serious military disadvantage if the people of India got an idea that we were not sufficiently strong to hold our own upon the seas. That is what I mean. In the event of any war upon the frontier, if they held those ideas in the interior we might be hampered by having to keep more troops in India. 528. What do 3^011 say as to the other question which has been mooted abroad, as to the possibility of linking up Russian railways with ours, bringing the Russian railways down to the Hindustan frontier, and so on ?—The feeling that is generally held by the Government of India at the present time, I believe, is that we have not yet sufficiently tested the real feeling in Russia towards ourselves. 529. I am not thinking of the feeling in Russia, any more than I am thinking of the opinion in India. I was rather wondering what the view is as to possible schemes of linking up ?—The Indian opinion would be dead against it. 530. The opinion of the Government of India ?—The Government of India would be undoubtedly strongly against it, because the feeling now is that it would take Russia a very considerable time before she could construct a railway from the north down to the neighbourhood of Seistan. We are in a position to construct a railway from Nushki to Seistan'' within eighteen months, and it would take Russia, according to the opinion of our experts, four years to cover the same ground. If we allowed Russia to come down to the limits of our zone it practically carries her over the worst part of the route in the event of any friction between ourselves ; and the feeling undoubtedly is that b}? - allowing her to make such a line we should have given our main position away very seriously^ whereas, if we can only prevent Russia from making any railway at all in that direction until we are certain that she is genuine in her desire for friendship with Great Britain, and would not give us away in order to secure more favourable terms from Germany or some other Power, we are in a most satisfactory and safe posi tion, so we very much prefer that we should remain defended, as we are at present, by the somewhat inhospitable wastes which Russia would have to traverse. At any rate we have this advantage over Russia, that we can make a railway from Nushki to Seistan in eighteen months. The lowest computation as far as we can make out of the time it would take for Russia to make a railway is four years, the reason being that Russia would have to travel for 300 or 400 miles over very difficult country indeed, whereas we have only to lay the rails down on what is practically a natural railway formation, as the route traverses a stony desert. If j'ou allow Russia to come down here, let us say to Khaf, where her telegraph line is to end, she will have got over the worst part of the distance.Evidence of Sir L. Dane. 53 531. Sir 0. Hardinge : You cannot prevent her doing that ?—No, we cannot prevent her coming down to a point north of Khaf, but all I can say is we should be very sorry to see her encouraged to do so, because there would be, no doubt, at once a demand on the part of the military authorities in India for a construction, not of this railway from Nushki to Seistan, but of a railway from Bunder Abbas to Seistan. 532. Mr. Morley : But consider, you are not quite free to scheme as you like : what you have got to contemplate is the possibility of a German movement from the Baghdad Railway towards your frontier. This linking with Russia is thought of by Russians as a way of counteracting the Baghdad Railway ?—Yes. 533. Supposing it to be possible that there should be a German movement to make railways and to send trade through the neutral zone, how are you going to meet that ?—I venture to suggest that we should obtain this Concession, a railway from some point near Basra towards Shiraz. If we obtain that it would be exceedingly difficult for German}' to start any railway at all. 534. That is really the point. What Concession would you, from the point of view of the Government of India, advise us to seek? - From the point of view of the Government of India, I would say first seek this Concession, Mohammerah to Shiraz, with a branch to the sea, with a port somewhere between the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab and Bunder Dilam to cover the case of the Karun ceasing to be navigable. Then, if at any time our interests were sufficiently consolidated in Persia to justify us in advancing that line further to the east, with a view of linking up with Indian railways, or, if we were satisfied of the good faith of Russia, with Russian railways, there is nothing to prevent your coming on in this direction to the east. 535. Through the neutral zone ?—Through the neutral zone, and into our own zone at Kerman. But this small length of railway from Shiraz to Mohammerah would not endanger the military position at all, according to our military experts. It is a line which at present you need only hold by our commercial interests in it, and if you had to give it away there would be no such serious loss of face as far as India is concerned, as would cause any popular unrest there. It is a line which from Shiraz to Kerman, and Kerman to a place called Bam, and from Bam to Seistan, has been surveyed and is a possible route. Then, supposing for the sake of argument that we felt ourselves sufficiently strong to continue that line to the east, you could carry it along that alignment; as far as we know, short of an alignment passing through the Russian zone, it is the best alignment that we have yet found. Then it would be also possible to make a line from Bunder Abbas through Bam to Seistan. 536. What is the immediate value of that ?—The immediate value of that is that, supposing the Russians commenced their line from the north, at present Lord Kitchener and his advisers do not wish to make the line from Nushki to Seistan, because they say that if the Russians obtained possession of Seistan we should then have facilitated their advance upon India. 537. But Seistan is now out of it ?—Seistan is included, according to the Conven tion, in the British sphere, but of course at present we want to see how that Convention will work for, say, five or ten years. 538. But, you see the Convention has been signed, and I think 1 can say most of us make all our computations upon the notion that the Convention is going to be observed, and if you will allow me to say so without offence, I observe that you quote the Indian military authorities, who have not yet accepted in their hearts the Russian Convention. There is the point?—We sincerely hope that the Russian Convention may be observed. 539. That is not it. We here assume, for the purposes of the argument, that it is going to work ?—It probably will, but I am only now voicing the military view. My own feeling is that I have always thought this through line would be a very useful line, and in fact my personal opinion was in favour of this line from Nushki to Seistan. But I only tell you that the military authorities, with Lord Kitchener at their head, are dead against it. They quite agree that we must hold Seistan, but they propose to hold it by a railway from Bunder Abbas to Seistan. The reason of that is, they say, supposing they could not hold Seistan they would then retire down this railway to the sea, and still leave the Power that had occupied Seistan with these 430 miles of desert to cross before they get to Nushki. They do not doubt the Convention ; they hope and trust that it will be immensely to our advantage, but the feeling that they have is that until it has been put to an actual test they would sooner not take any steps towards facilitating an advance of a Russian railway towards Seistan, if they could possibly avoid doing so.■HHHHHBBnnBBBBV 54 Fourth Meeting, 17th March, 1908. 540. Are they equally alive to what I have already mentioned—the possibility of a German railway ?—Yes, they are quite alive to that. 541. I Low do they propose to meet that ?—The only way they propose to meet it is this. I hey admit that the only way they can do that at present is from the commercial point of view ; that if we can make a commercial line to Shiraz from the west we forestall anything the Germans may do there, and for the Germans to make a second line through the same tract of country, which we already field as ours, could not seriously be described as a commercial proceeding. 542. \\ ith regard to a through route, what do you all feel upon that, a through journey being possible from Europe ? It says here, “ While passengers would hesitate to tia \(1 bj- the Baghdad Railway with the necessity of breaking the journey on arrival at the Peisian Gulf, the convenience of a through carriage from Calais to India could not fail to make itself felt.” ;: ’' What do you say upon that ?—Personally ? 543. No, not at all; the Government of India?—There again there are two schools. I here is the civil school, who would welcome an arrangement of that kind. . ^ through route ? A through route ; but the military school, as 1 say, are terribly opposed to anything of that kind. They do not want to be compelled to extend their railways beyond Nushki. o45. Sir E. Grey : Then the first step you would advise would be to get a Concession from Mohammerah to Shiraz for a railway ?—Yes. 54G. Then you have covered the west dank?—Yes. 547. At the far end ?—At the far end. 548. And any linking up with the Baghdad Railway or other through routes would then have to be with us ?—With us. 049. You would leave open the question of railways to the east of Shiraz until you saw how the Convention worked ?—Yes. . Supposing the Russians took the same point of view that we are taking now, which is that there was a considerable risk of German competition, and that it was desirable therefore to occupy the ground as far as railways were concerned, and they came to us and said that they wished to promote Concessions in their own sphere, and in the neutral sphere, in co-operation with us, how could we meet them ? I gather you would say not on the east side at ah, for the military reason ?—Y 7 es, I would say there could be no commercial railway in the east, south of Meshed. Any railway constructed there could not possibly be put forward for commercial reasons, unless* it was to be a railway to link up with the Indian railways. But the line that has appeared to me ior some years as a very suitable line for the Russians to work is the one that they are working on now, the line from Kazvin to Hamadan. ooI. \\ here is Kazvin ?—Kazvin is west of Tehran. Thence to Hamadan. From there pi obal &gt;ly through Kermanshah to Khanikin. That entirely lies within the Russian sphere of interest. At one time they were rather keen on it. 552. That would be a feeder to the Baghdad Railway ?—Yes, the main artery of trade at present is from Baghdad by Khanikin and Kermanshah into Northern Persia, /liat ^uuld give Russia practically the control of the whole trade of Northern and iNorth-western Persia. 553. Assume that the Russians were to take the view that they did not desire to see the aghdad Railway made, which they do not ?—A great many other people do not either. ^ ^ o54 And that, therefore, they are not prepared to promote any feeder of the Baghdad Railway, and that their desire rather was to have an independent thing down to the Persian Gulf; what would you say to a proposal from Russia that she should make her line from Julfa, say, to Kazvin or Tehran, and come from there to Khoramabad, and join up with a railway which we should make from Mohammerah up to nieet it T • All our reports say that that country is almost impossible. It is a most terrible country from Dizful north to Khoramabad, and the first thing vou would have to do there would be to pacify the Lurs. For years we have been trying to make a road through there, and we had two officers wounded and very nearly killed in the attempt, and since then we have had to go very slow on account of that.' * Appendix 2, p. 164. t I should hke to add that this would not be as direct a through line via Russia to India as the Isfahan route. It is diilicult and the fact that Russia was going to make it would hardly prevent the Germans from makmg the Baghdad line hrsi. If n was the only line we made, it seems possible that at a time of friction with Russia alone or with Germany we might have to abandon it, and with it the Karun tract and so let Russia down to a port on the Gulf. There would, however, be no harm in securing the Concession for a line v ia Shuster, which was expressly mentioned by Nasir-ud-din Shah in 1888, which would prevent anothe? Rower from coming down too close to the Gulf.—A. Dane. werEvidence of Sir L. Dane. 55 555. Is it a very difficult country on account of the ferocity of the Lurs ?—A very difficult country indeed. It is terribly hilly, and you cross the hills at right angles. Besides, if I might venture to say so, if the Russians are really anxious to do it, and we must let them come down into the neutral zone, why not let them make their railway up to Isfahan, and then let us link up with our proposed railway from Shiraz. Then, whether you take your railway to Mohammerah or to Bunder Abbas, you would have the southern end of the line under British control, which, as far as India is concerned, would greatly allay our fears as to the good faith of Russia. 556. Sir C. Hardinge : I do not see how that could be done from Isfahan to Shiraz ?—It is a perfectly practicable route. It is very nearly flat. There is a gradual ascent, which goes up from the Isfahan plateau, which I think is about 3,500 feet. It works up gradually to 6,000 feet, and then drops down to Shiraz. The route from Mohammerah to Khoramabad, or from Mohammerah by Ahwaz to Isfahan, is really only used by very few travellers, partly on account of the difficulties of the country, and very largely on account of the predatory habits of the tribes. But the main route into Persia is from Bushire to Shiraz, and from Shiraz to Isfahan. 557. Why not a railway from Bushire to Shiraz?—That again is absolutely impossible without a mono rail, for instance. I may tell you they have sometimes to unload their nudes to get up and down even. 558. Sir E. Grey : The Russians are looking into this question of occupying the ground in Persia, and from the same point of view as vre are ?—Yes. 559. \\ hat would you say, therefore, to our making a definite proposal to the Russians that they should come down to Isfahan with a railway, and that we should apply for a Concession, which we should expect them to support, for ourselves from Mohammerah to Shiraz, and Shiraz to Isfahan ?—Assuming that the Russians have got to come, I think from an Indian point of view we should have less apprehensions from that than any other possible line you could suggest. It is rather a circuitous route, but at the same time it is the main trade route in Persia. 560. According to you, then, it is the only way of reaching the Gulf ?—It is the only way of reaching the Gulf really, except at prohibitive expense through the Lurs country. Our records are sufficient to show that the cost of making a railway through the Lurs and Bakhtiari country would entail a very serious preliminary expenditure in dealing with the tribes. 561. \ou could tame the tribes in time, but you could not tame the hills ?—Xo. 562. If I understand the hills really make the railway almost impracticable, of course it is not a practicable route ?—Yes, that is my opinion. These various routes have occupied the attention of the Government for years, and, as far as 1 know, we have not been able to find a decent route north of Dizful. 563. You said the gradient would be 1 in 40 (Question 517); that is a pretty steep gradient?—\es, but 1 in 40 we regard fora metre-gauge railway (because it has to go through difficult country, and that gauge would have to be used) as quite commercially practicable. It does not seriously inconvenience us. 564. You could not run long trains over it?—Xo, but for a very considerable time 1 should say short trains would be able to carry all the trade. 565. 1 in 60 is considered an obstacle in England ?—I should think one train three times a week would be sufficient for all the trade in Persia for some time to come. ^ It is astonishing the number of camel loads and mule loads that can be put on a single metre-gauge truck. 566. As to the effect of the Convention on railways, the Russians cannot bring a railway, or get a Concession for a railway, to go anywhere near Seistan without actually violating the Convention ?—That we are quite aware of, but the unfortunate tiling is. that they have got inside their sphere the most difficult part of the route, and if they have made a railway down to the limits of their sphere, you wall see there is an open stretch of country which they have been driving horses and carriages across, and I am sure that, rightly or wrongly, the Government of India, for what it is worth, would certainly come up w ith a proposal to construct some kind of countervailing railway at once. 567. From Bunder Abbas to Seistan ?—Yes. 568. The whole of which would be in our sphere ?—Yes, but it would be a very expensive thing. ^ It is a very good route, only crosses one pass—the Gishu Kotal — which is about 4,500 feet high. That could be negotiated by a short tunnel It is a. [376] Q50 Fourth Meeting, 17th March, JOGS. very good line, bnt it would cost a good deal of money, and the return would be for a considerable time small. . 569. So that it comes to this really: what we ought to do is to occupy oursi as quickly as possible with covering the ground by Railway Concessions to the west ol the neutral zone?—To the west of the neutral zone, getting as many Concessions as you can without of necessity carrying them out. T i- nf 570. And getting the Russians interested in that too?-From an Indian point of view there is no doubt that would be much the most economical, because rightly or wrongly—I suppose it is force of habit-we regard any advance ot Krissm towards our frontier as rather a terrifying thing, even though there is a Convention, and when people get terrified they generally want to spend money. 571. Anyhow, that is a clear line of objective for us to take. 572. Sib C. Hardinge: The only point I should like to ask is, if there is a line built from Mohammerah to Shiraz, would there be ^“7 usebmklln 8 ® ^ Bunder Abbas to Shiraz as well?—If you made a line from Mohammerah to Sh , would not make the line from Bunder Abbas to Shiraz. I would make the hi e Bunder Abbas to Bam eventually, the object of it being that &gt;' oin ' hl fG'® the west be based upon the sea, and you would have an intermediate point between that and what the military authorities say is our ultimate strategical line of Persia also based on the sea. That at any rate is the present idea. So that it a 1 ower were coming from the west and moving on your line of railway, suppos: „ toned out of the western section of the line, we should still be m a strong position, with a base upon the sea at Bunder Abbas, for defending the eastern section. 573. General Ewart : If a through line was constructed from Xusliki to Shiraz, would it really dip down to Bunder Abbas?—It would not dip down ^ 15 “ n dy Abtes. Bunder Abbas is a very important port, absolutely in our ‘ sp l^j ’ and at the present moment we have practically 90 per cent, of the trade there. t would not come down at all to Bunder Abbas, but would throw off a branch to Brat port from the vicinity of Bam. The main line would run from Koh-i-Malik biah to Nasratabad Tope. From that it runs across the Lut, the desert there. That a ay was supposed to be an impossible section, but we put telegrap i ■ • . and sank wells, and it is now a caravan route. From there it runs u Pj° ® p&lt; ? int }'** east of Kerman. We should not necessarily run into Kerman, because that in o a dip. Then it goes up to Saidabad, and from Saidabad up to Lake Linz, and i i Lak G? 4 n/ That 0 is practicable, you say?—I have not had the advantage of going over it, but 1 have spoken to Captain Hopkins, who made the survey in 1902, and also Mr. Uobbs who was Deputy Secretory of the Foreign Department for some time, and he travelled over the country in 1903. 575. Me. Mobley: That was the officer who was in the Afghanistan Mission?— Yes, and he, so far as a layman can offer an opinion on * yGi.L.'' r.artGof'Persia Captain Hopkins said. It also passes through one or two habitable paits ol ersia, round Kerman and Sirjan, really, for Persia, fairly fertile tracts , believ - e 576 When you say for Persia, Persian tracts are not necessarily fertile . 1 be the country has been described as a desert with salt or a desert withou salt, surrounded by barren mountain ranges. That is to say, all this southern and eastern ^ton Of course, up in the northwest and the extreme north the Russians in then sphere have got a very rich country. 577 . Sm C. Hardinge : Seistan is very fertile ?—Seistan has immense potentiali ties. But at the present time it is the most unpleasant place to reside in on th6 e 578 1 ' Why is that ?—The wind blows for 120 days m the year, and attains a velocity of OO^miles an hour. If by any chance the wind happens to drop you are consumed by biting animals of every conceivable description, and owing to the force of the wind it is very difficult to create trees or any other amenity of that kind except low scrub. 579 Sir E. Grey: Then do vou include amongst Seistan s potentialities that this wind may cease ?-No. It is a horrible place, but it grows a very good kind of wheat, and, as you know, we have had most elaborate surveys to.a de o . think the total irrigation at present at Seistan is something like 1 20,000 or idO.OOl ) acres,Evidence of Sir L. Dane. 57 and we could increase it to something like 950,000 acres of wheat. The advantage of Seistan is that it is the only place, as far as one knows, anywhere within this area in which you could create a granary that was capable of maintaining a very considerable force locally. . 580. And for the sake of growing wheat people would not care how bad a place it was to live in ?—-That is the case with a very considerable portion of the 1 unjaub. 581. Sir W. Nicholson : You mentioned this railway from Isfahan to Shiraz as dropping down from Isfahan to Shiraz ?—Rising from Isfahan to Shiraz. # 582. No, excuse me, the height of Isfahan is 5,330, and the height of Shiraz is 5,200 ?—Might I be allowed to look ? Isfahan, I am almost certain, is not 5,000. 583. Yes, 5,330, and the other place is 5,200 ?—Yes. 584. And I understand the midway place, or nearly the midway place, is nearly 6,000?—Yes. . . T . . 585. So that would be an extremely difficult line, would it not? I am simply saying that the gradient of that line both ways would be more severe than the gradient from Mohammerah to Shiraz ?—No, I do not think so. 586. Yes, going up north. Would it be as severe?—Of course I have never been over it, but our road reports show that at any rate we know they are driving wheeled vehicles from Isfahan. 587. Of course they use mules, but they are bad roads ?—They are bad roads. It is reported as a feasible line. I have not any very definite information about that. 588. You refer to the idea that if the Russians came south to Khaf, and seemed to be proceeding towards Seistan, the military authorities and the Government of India would press for an extension of the railway from Nushki to Seistan (Questions 530, 531, 539), and its prolongation from Seistan to Bunder Abbas ?—They would press for a line from Bunder Abbas to Seistan. The present advisers of the Government of India I cannot conceive asking for an extension from Nushki to Seistan in any conceivable circumstances. 589. They would press for a line from Bunder Abbas to Seistan?—^ e s. 590. But what possible effect, except a deleterious effect, from a military point of view could the construction of such a line have on the defences of India ? I am only speaking from the notes I have seen. The idea is that, especially since Seistan has come within the British sphere, we ought to make some attempt to prevent some other Power occupying it, and the only way we could do that would be to base our operations upon the sea*at Bunder Abbas, so that, if we were forced to retire, we should still leave the Power who turned us out with this desert to cross. That is the theory. 591. You know, from a military point of view, to isolate a considerable force and come back to the sea at Bunder Abbas is rather opposed to ordinary principles ? Where doctors differ—and also soldiers—I should not presume to suggest anything ; and of course strategical ideas have an unpleasant habit of changing about every three years, I understand. 592. Strategy never changes ?—But the ideas that are put forward do change. For instance, may I take an illustration from the very case you are talking of. W e were dragged into that Nushki Railway, which cost us 80 lakhs of rupees, because it was considered to be a necessary extension. Now any such extension is anathema. 593. You surprise me, because I was a member of the Committee when the extension to Nushki was most strongly pressed on the Home Government by the Viceroy of India?—I can quite remember it. I know Lord Curzon was very strongly of that opinion, and, if a layman may be allowed to have an opinion about strategy, I have always been of opinion, possibly through being an ultra-sanguine person, that it was the proper thing to do in case of necessity, more especially as the Ameer was willing to let us make a railway by the Helmand. 594. Mr. Morley : Was he willing?—Yes, he offered us a railway along from Nushki by the Helmand to Seistan, and a fort there. 595. Sir E. Grey : This was more than three years ago ?—More than three years ago. 596. Now we must wait another three years ?—Possibly, it may come to that. But it is very embarrassing. You write upon what you believe to be the idea, and you find that it is entirely at variance with the idea which at present prevails. 597. Mr. Lloyd-George : I think I understood from your evidence that, in your judgment, from a purely commercial point of view, all roads are equally bad, I mean * I was speaking from memory, and had given the elevation of Kashan, 3,200 feet, for Isfahan.— L. Done.58 Fourth Meeting, 17th March, 1908. from the point of view of making those railways pay ?— This would be the most likely to pay, from Mohammerah to Shiraz, so far as we can make out. This is another tract like Seistan, which is capable, by irrigation, of becoming a valuable wheat-producing tract, ft may have oil. Mr. D’Arcy has spent many thousands of pounds in trying to prove it. He has not succeeded yet, but there are very good shows of oil there. It would take not only the Bushire trade, but also a considerable amount of the trade which at present goes up to Baghdad. 598. So that really this railway might be made to pay in course of time ?—It is really impossible to say that, because I have no confidence in the estimates which have been put forward. The estimates unfortunately are often exceeded. But this is more likely to carry a considerable volume of trade than most of the lines that one can think of Persia. 599. And the line from Bunder Abbas to Seistan would not pay commercially ?— No, this would not^ pay at present at all. We have got a trade route from Nushki to Seistan, which carries but little Persian trade. GOO. This would not pay?—Yes, that would pay almost as well as the other, the only difference being that, by this line, you would tap a very considerable portion of the Baghdad trade. 601. What would this railway cost? Have you any idea at all?—Of course I was not prepared with any paper upon that. It is a thing I could not tell you. I would sooner not give you any answer upon that point. I can get you the figures. G02. Mr. Morley : I think you might get us the figures.—Yes. G03. How many miles is it?—That also I could not say straight off. It is a fairly direct route, but there are gradients in it, and that always means extra length. 604. Sir E. Grey : To get the Concession would cost nothing?—What I ventured to put forward in a note was to get the Concession for these lines to Shiraz, and from Bunder Abbas to Seistan, to earmark the Concessions, and sit tight. 605. Mr. Lloyd-George : So long as we get them from the right people who would not part with them for a sum of money. Is your view that the Government should take them, or that they should be taken out by private individuals ?—1 think in the neutral zone you would probably, under the Convention, have to put forward a private individual. 606. You must be sure of him first?—I should think it would not be impossible. 607. Mr. Morley : I think now, if the railway question, so far as Sir Louis Dane is concerned, is disposed of, I should like to ask him a little on the other question—of British interest in the Gulf, beginning with Muscat. There will not be too many questions, but very important points arise which Sir Louis Dane will be able to tell us something of. (To the witness) About Muscat, the Government of India consider it important to have a preponderating influence there, do not they ?—Yes. 608. Why ?—Because, in the first place, that influence we have always had, and in India we become rather oriental, and we do not like to see anything altered if we can possibly avoid it, and, in the next place, the situation of it renders it very important from our point of view. 609. But is not your preponderating influence a joint influence ?~ You are not exclusively influential there. There is France ?--Theoretically it is a joint influence, but, practically, the Government of India preponderates very largely. We very fortunately took over the duty of paying an annual subsidy that Zanzibar is supposed to pay to Muscat. I see it is mentioned in this note. We have also been very accommodating in the matter of loans for steam-yachts and other purposes, and the Sultan of Muscat looks to us. There was one case in which we lost our preponderating influence for a time, that was the Bunder Gisseh coal depot. But at present the Sultan looks to us to protect his interests, and there is no doubt that the great bulk of the traders in Muscat are British Indians. 610. Do you consider, now that the flag question is settled between France and India, that the presence of a French Consul at Muscat is prejudicial to our interests? This is a way of testing the preponderance ?—So long as we maintain our present position and influence with the Sultan I do not think the French Consul is capable of doing us much harm. But we should very much sooner have no Consul there.Evidence of Sir L. Dane. o9 611. Of course. The Government of India consider it desirable that we should obtain control of the Customs. What would you gain by that?—We should gain this, that we should hold all the purse-strings there, and the person who holds the purse strings has generally the preponderating influence. V)12. Then why has not the Sultan accepted the proposals hinted to him ?— Because, like most of us, he is subject to mixed motives. He knows perfectly well that if we had control of his Customs, as well as giving him this annual subsidy, he would be entirely dependent upon us, and even the Sultan of Muscat does not entirely appreciate the position of a dependant. 613. What is the exact arrangement that you propose for controlling his Customs? —Two arrangements were proposed : one was that in consideration of an annual advance he should hand over the Customs to us to manage entirely. That I am afraid is at present hardly possible. It might have been possible three or four years ago, but at present, after the flag incident and one thing and another, I do not think we could secure that. But I do think we might secure—Major Cox told me there was a possibility of it—a modified control, that is to say, that the Sultan would, in consideration of our guaranteeing him a certain annual income, agree to our lending him a Customs officer, who would control the Customs. 614. Now I come to a matter that is of great importance, the arms trade, of which Muscat is the centre ?—Yes, as far as we are concerned in India, it is. 615. That is an enormously important question, because if it is mismanaged it may lead to a claim for international control in Muscat ?—Yes. 616. The Brussels Act you, I am sure, are well acquainted with ?—I am not, perhaps, as well acquainted with it as I ought to be. 617. Well, we shall assume that you are. Muscat now is outside of the Brussels Act ?—Yes. 618. Do you think it is desirable that it should be brought within the Brussels Act and that a representative of Muscat should attend the next Brussels Conference ?— As far as we are at present concerned in the Government of India, we should very much sooner see it not brought within the Brussels Act. 619. On the ground, I presume, that if she is brought within the Brussels Act that opens the door to international control ?—Yes. The reason why we did not protest more vigorously was that papers were sent to us showing that the Foreign Office had suggested that it should be done, and in the face of that we felt a little difficulty about expressing a strong opinion that it should not be done, though we had entertained a very earnest hope that it would not be done. 620. Of course, France and other Powers have a right to trade in arms at Muscat ? Yes, unfortunately. Commercial Treaties allow imports of all kinds on a duty of 5 per cent., and of course that includes arms. 621. What idea have the Government of India had of stopping the traffic, it being granted that France has a great interest in keeping on the trade ?—We have made two or three ineffectual attempts to try and induce the French Government, or at least to suggest that the French Government might be induced to stop it. 622. What sort of arguments have you used to induce the French Government to stop this ?—Principally humanitarian, and also personal interest. At the time of the Morocco incident—or rather, first of all I will go back to the time of the Anglo-French entente ; we then suggested that, as there was a general settlement of our differences with France, possibly it might be desirable to settle this Muscat business. But, unfor tunately we were told that that, being a very thorny subject, could not be introduced. Then in regard to the flag question, we have also suggested that as we had been very complaisant with regard to the flag question, and that we had perhaps given up points that on a strict interpretation of the Award we might have held to, the French might be complaisant on their side and agree to put a stop to this trade, or at any rate to limit it very considerably. But I am afraid from reading these papers it looks as if the French Government were not disposed to be complaisant 623. Would you tell us what is the general procedure under the Brussels Act for stopping the arms traffic, or controlling it at the point of entry rather ?—All the arms have got to be brought into a go-down. In fact, rifled arms cannot be imported at all except for the use of one of the Signatory Powers, and other arms are put into what we call a go-down. 624. A go-down is a warehouse ?—A warehouse, yes, from which they can only be exported under certain conditions. 625. The trade in arms between Muscat and Africa is not very large, is it ?—The trade in arms between Muscat and Africa is very small indeed, as far as we know. [376] R60 Fourth Meeting, 17th March, 1908. 626. And the Sultan now has got power enough to suppress that if he liked ?— He could not. How could he do it ? You see the Act does not extend to it, and I do not think the Sultan could do it of his own motion. 1 am sure the French would object at once if he began to put any restrictions upon the import and sale of arms in his territories. 627. This is a trade between Muscat and Africa, remember, that I am talking of ? —Yes, but I do not see how the Sultan alone could do it. Of course, a boat can clear from there and may be going anywhere, and the trade is mainly carried on, unfortunately, under the French flag in these boats which sail from a place called Sur, in which the French have rather a lively interest. But the bulk of the trade is not to Africa, it is to the Persian and Turkish coast. 628. The bulk of the trade, I suppose, is to Arabia and to Afghanistan and to Persia and the tribes on the north-west frontier ?—Yes. 629. That concerns you ?—Yes. 630. That is the traffic that is especially prejudicial to our interests, I take it ?— For four or five years we have been driving at this—ever since the first Gulf rifles began to appear upon the frontier—and every possible conceivable and inconceivable suggestion has been made with a view of putting a stop to it, because we recognize it is the most dangerous trade that could possibty exist for India. 631. Has the Sultan got powers, as things stand, to put it down ? You seem to say he has not ?—He has already given us powers of stopping and searching Muscat boats. He has prohibited trade in arms with Persia, and with the Trucial Chiefs and with Bahrein and with India, because all these countries have prohibited the importing of arms. He has allowed us in his territorial waters to stop and search all boats believed to be carrying arms. He has not as yet been able to prohibit the trade with the Turkish strip of coast here, because, though I understand the Turks regard it as an improper trade, as far as our information goes they have never formally prohibited it. That was one of the things we suggested, that the Turks might have agreed to make their prohibition overt, so that we could at once get the Sultan to proclaim all the trade with the Turkish and Persian coast. If that were done we should then be in a position to stop and search practically any boat, except a boat carrying foreign colours unfortunately, within the Persian Gulf. If it had arms on board they must be contraband, because there would be no port then in the Persian Gulf which would be open to the trade. But Sir Nicholas O’Conor was never able to arrive at the point, that the Porte could be approached in that way. Then we have a right to search all boats in Persian territorial waters and seize those carrying arms, and carry them to the nearest Persian port to cause them to be condemned. Then as far as it is possible to stop the trade by blockading we have done a great deal. We now hope to do something more by utilizing the telegraph line which runs along the coast of Mekran to Jashk, with a cable to Henjam. For that the Navy co-operate ; they generally have one or two gun-boats during the running season, that is from October to May, cruising up and down that coast. Hitherto they have never succeeded in capturing a single boat, because as soon as a gun-boat appears upon the horizon the arms are deposited overboard, and then recovered at a suitable time. But now we hope that by utilizing the telegraph line, with telephones and some camel watchmen, we shall be able to indicate to the officer in command of a gun-boat where a cargo is about to be run. The Afghan traders collect at a certain point. I think, especially if we can get wireless telegraphy, which I hope that you, Sir, will shortly receive proposals for 632. Are you speaking to me as Secretary of State ?—- Yes. That would greatly facilitate it. At present if we try signalling with flags, immediately this is reported the whole length of the coast, but if we could signal by wireless telegraphy, with the ships cruising off the coast, they might be able to come and intercept the cargo. However, so far as it goes we have not succeeded in capturing a single boat loaded with arms, though we know they are there. This year we adopted a rather dangerous but successful expedient. We used our influence with the Sultan of Muscat and got him to prohibit the landing of Afghans at Muscat. That has, of course, entirely disorganized the arrangements of the traders, and they have not been able to run arms at all. How long we shall be able to continue this somewhat dubious expedient I do not know. The French cannot possibly object to what we do with regard to the Afghans, especially as a good many of them are people who live for the most part of the year in our territory, and if we can stop the traders getting into Muscat for a couple of years we shall for that period disorganize the trade. Then I suppose the Afghans will come down to the coast and send Baluchis and Persians across. In the meantime, we hope His Majesty’s Government may be able to do something more.Evidence of Sir L. Dane. 61 633. I see from a Memorandum* here the Indian revenues contribute 5,760/. a-year to the Sultan ; what for ?—That is the position. When Zanzibar was separated from Muscat, Zanzibar was then more valuable than Muscat —the revenue was greater—and in order to equalize matters Zanzibar was to pay Muscat that amount. At that time Zanzibar was more or less under the Government of India, and in order to give us a hold over the Sultan of Muscat, instead of Zanzibar paying it, we paid it. 634. I only mentioned that, because one suggestion is that, in order to compensate the Sultan of Muscat for the profit he gets out of this arms-running, that 5,760/. should be doubled ?—We propose to raise it to 15,000/. a-year, and it would be cheap. 635. You are going to give him 15,000/. a-year; what for ?—As compensation for the loss of his customs on arms, if he can prohibit the trade. 636. What is he going to do ?—As a matter of fact, I had great difficulty in getting the military authorities in India to realize it for some time, but it is the most dangerous thing we have been confronted with for some time. Four years ago they did nob believe that these arms came from Muscat. Then we had actually to buy arms and bring them into India to prove that they did come. Now that the tribes are importing thousands in a year, it is a simple sum in arithmetic that if the last time we attacked the Afridis 1 in 10 were armed with rifles, and we had to employ so many thousands of soldiers, how many troops will be required when 9 out of 10 Afridis are armed with good rifles. At present they cannot get arms anywhere else. 637. We had evidence on this Committee about the arms in another connection ?— I am afraid it is beyond my wits to suggest how you can stop the import of arms at Muscat if you cannot get the French to agree. But I should certainly much sooner have the evils we know of, rather than allow an international control at Muscat. 638. Sir E. Grey : You would like us to drop the Brussels Act ?—Very much. 639. Mr. Morley : I have no more to ask about Muscat. I want to ask you a question or two about Bahrein. By our Treaty with the Sheikh—we had something about it at our first meeting—he engages not to correspond with foreign countries, or to receive their agents, or alienate territory we have there. In that you would admit the elements of a Protectorate ?—Yes. 640. Those are the features of a Protectorate ?—Yes. 641. The Government of India has proposed to make our position stronger by establishing a British jurisdiction over foreigners ?—We would rather put it by bringing to the notice of foreigners the fact that we do exercise a jurisdiction. 642. But surely you assented to, if you are not the authors of, a proposal in Council ?—Yes ; we want to get that Order in Council in order to make the matter perfectly clear. At present we are proceeding in the informal sort of way that we generally do, but it seemed that the time had come when we ought to put ourselves on a more legal footing. The Sheikh at present is quite ready that we should deal with all foreigners’ cases. He raises no question at all. But what we are afraid of is that our jurisdiction might very easily be challenged, and then there would be a very awkward conflict, whereas it seemed to us, if w r e could get this Order in Council passed before any serious case occurred, that we should be in a stronger position to meet an objection. 643. Why does the Sheikh of Bahrein object to our control of his Customs ?—For the same reason as, I am afraid, in the case of the Sultan of Muscat. Nobody likes to be protected against his will, and also he does not want us to know what his income is. 644. How do you expect or hope to induce him to accept it ?—There again we have been trying for a very long time. He has been cajoled ; he has been bullied ; he has been flattered, and we have resorted to all the devices of Indian political action, and Major Cox, who is a most excellent officer, wrote to me shortly before I left that he hoped to be able to carry this through. The Sheikh at any rate is not going to farm his Customs again through these Hindoo dealers. 645. What would be the particular advantages of obtaining this control ?— We should then control all the Sheikh’s sources of income, and could stop the arms trade. Personally, I am not so keen in Bahrein as I am in the case of Muscat. I believe that as regards Bahrein we are in a very strong position already, thanks to the Germans and the Persians themselves. 646. You have no means to propose as a means of strengthening our influence ?— Not beyond what I have already suggested, that we should take means of making it known we have jurisdiction. We could, of course, compel him to hand over the * Appendix 3, p. 201.62 Fourth Meeting, 17th March, 1908. Customs to-morrow, but it would be a very forcible proceeding, and there is no particular object in it. It would be desirable to have it, because it would strengthen our position, but as regards the legality of our Protectorate, I do not think it is absolutely necessary. 647. Sir E. Grey : We do actually exercise jurisdiction over foreigners at Bahrein now ?—In civil cases, practically all cases are dealt with by the British Political Agent there. With regard to criminal cases, recently in nearly every case, they have been made over to the English Political Agent to be dealt with by the Sheikh. 648. How long has that been going on ?—One of his Courts has been going on for fifty years, a civil Court. The facts are correctly given in that precis. 649. It makes a considerable difference when you come to notify foreigners of the fact that you do the thing?—That is what we were aware of, and we hoped it might be done before there was any conflict. 650. Why do you want an Order in Council ?—Simply because we are afraid that our position may be challenged, and it would look worse to assert it by an Order in Council after the dispute had arisen than it would beforehand. We want certain minor things done now, and we thought we might be able to work in the question of foreign jurisdiction witli these other matters which are non-contentious. 651. You make out the Order in Council reciting what we already do ?—Yes, exactly. (‘•52. Sir C. Hardinge : I should like to ask if there is anything we can do at Koweit to strengthen our position there at all any more than we have already done ?— I venture to think you have done everything that is really necessary at the moment. The Sheikh of Koweit, Sheikh Mubarak, is a very difficult man to deal with. Of course, what he would like would be an open Protectorate and a subsidy, but I do not think it is necessary at present to go to that extent, leaving altogether out of the question, as not concerning us, the effect it would have upon the Germans. I think you have got a very strong position in Koweit now, and there is no doubt that that last Agreement has been most satisfactory to the Sheikh. Also when you allowed us to seize those two pirates who had been pirating Koweit dhows, and dragging them through the mire of the Koweit streets for the delectation of the Sheikh and his people, it had a very good effect upon them. Then we handed them over to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, who at present is on the closest possible terms with the Sheikh of Koweit. What there is between them we do not know, but it looks as if they had some understanding. 653. Did he execute these people ?—No, they happened to be persons connected with members of his own tribes, I believe, so they have been placed in durance vile, where they will possibly die by natural causes. 654. Sir R. Ritchie : The present Government does not recognize the right of our Consular Agents to protect the Bahreinese ?—No, nor does the Turkish Government. 655. There is a case which has occurred. Do you think it would agitate the Sheikh of Bahrein if he found that we did not protect his subjects?—He would object very strongly. He would expect us to do it. In fact, our not granting full Consular protection to Bahreinese and Koweit subjects is a source of great difficulty, and our great difficult/ with the Trucial Chiefs is that we have not been able to do it to the same extent as regards them. I am sure that the protection they get in their trade with Turkish and Persian ports is one of the points they most value in their connection with us. It is not complete. In fact, if we could insist upon the Persian Government recognizing not only our good offices, but Consular protection, it would be the most satisfactory thing we coidd do. 656. That is the standing difficulty of our protection, both in Koweit and Bahrein ? —Exactly. At Koweit we have great difficulties. We have insisted upon it in Persia two or three times. In Turkey we cannot insist upon it. It wordd raise the whole question of the status of Koweit, which I believe everybody agrees it is better to leave as undecided as possible. [Adjourned.]Fifth Meeting, Thursday, 19th March, 1908. PRESENT: The Right Hon. J. Morley, O.M., M.P., Secretary of State for India (in the Chair). The Right Hon. Sir E. Grey, Bart., M.P., Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. The Viscount Esher, K.C.B., G.C.V.O. The Right Hon. Sir C. Hardinge, G.C.M.G., G.C.V.O., Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Sir R. Ritchie, K.C.B., Political and Secret Secretary, India Office. Captain E. J. W. Slade, M.V.O., Director of Naval Intelligence. General Sir W. G. Nicholson, K.C.B., Quartermaster-General. Major-General J. S. Ewart, C.B., Director of Military Operations. Captain Sir C. L. Ottley, K.C.M.G., M.V.O. (Secretary). Mr. Pardoe Thomas (Manager of Bucknall Brothers’ Persian Gulf line) and Mr. George Lloyd attended as witnesses and were examined. Evidence of Mr. P. Thomas. (Mr. A. Wilson Fox, C.B., of the Board of Trade, was also present.) 657. Mr. Morley : Will you tell us your relation to the firm of Bucknall and Sons ; what office you have with them?—I am the Manager, and I had the pleasure of inaugurating their Persian Gulf business. 658. When was that ?—Eleven years ago, in 1897. _ 659. In those eleven years Bucknall’s share of this business has grown ? \es y from one steamer to, roughly speaking, about twenty steamers a-year. It was not twenty last year. Last year was a bad year. 660. What is the increase due to in your view ? Energy on your part, of course ? No, Sir, fight. We had to fight our way into it, and to a very great extent we created it 661. I know, but what achieved victory for you, apart from energy ?—The cargo formerly used to go from Bombay, via the Bombay Conference lines, and by other means. We were the means of establishing a direct service without calling at Bombay. 662. What route do you follow?—From Manchester to the Thames, then to Marseilles, and on to the Gulf. 663. What is the average size of your boats?—3,500 dead weight cargo on Conference account, 5,500 dead weight cargo on non-Conference account. 664. That is a little too technical for us. Will you kindly explain ?—A steamer, 4,000 to 5,000 tons dead weight, w^ould give about 3,500 tons dead weight capacity in our cargo. We use those small steamers because it is difficult to cross the bar. 665. Of which river are you speaking ?—The Shat-el-Arab, 16 miles across; where we have a spring tide there is 16 to 18 feet draught of water. Therefore our steamers are restricted as to size. We have also adopted that size for the purpose of forming a Conference, but there have been times when we have been able to send up light draught ships, averaging up to 5,500 tons cargo. 666 . What foreign competition have you had?—We first of all had the Russian line, which started about 6 years ago. They send about three steamers per year. 667. Has their number increased as yours has ?—No. 668 ! What else?—The Austrians have sent about two steamers a-year. They [376] S64 Fifth Meeting, 19'ih March, 1908. send one particularly on what are called the date tides. Of course you know that dates are a large commodity, brought home in September and October, and they send one steamer for that, and one steamer generally for other cargo. 669. Then what do the North Germans do ?—They started about nineteen months ago, and they have sent out on the average a steamer a-month. 670. Do you consider that that steamer, going once a-month, has been a profitable enterprise for the Hamburg-Amerika line ?—Disastrous, I should say, for them. I estimate the loss at from 30,000£. to 40,Q00L a-year. 671. You estimate that as the loss to the Hamburg-Amerika?—Yes, to Germany. They profess to say that it is State-aided. 672. They have not said it is State-aided ?—They have said the loss is not for their account. 673. Who said it, and to whom, did he say it ?—It was, I believe, given by Herr Ballin, to a very great ship-owner in the City of London. 674. What other ships find their way there ? Of course the British India do, as we know ?—The British India mail-boats go there every week. I should give them about 1,400 or 1,500 tons, and were it not for the subsidy they could not possibly look at it. 675. The British India could not ?—No. 676. Without the mail subvention?—Yes; they profess, I understand, to lose money as it is. I could enlarge on that if you would give me time. 677. Tell us please ?—I think it is about time that the mail did not go via Bombay. Then we should control the Persian Gulf. You will excuse me for saying so, but it is the merchants and the steam-ship lines that control the Persian Gulf. It has been a neglected country. Everybody has passed it by, until now they find there is money there, or fancy so. We have kept it for the British flag entirely without assistance. Of course that is with Messrs. Strick; we work on equal terms with Messrs. Strick. 678. You and Messrs. Strick are a combine?—Yes; and as regards everything I say, you may take it Messrs. Strick take as six out of twelve. I served Mr. Strick for four years before I went to Bucknall’s. I think the mail ought to be inaugurated from Basra to Suez or Aden, to be picked up there. Why it should go to Bombay, and from Bombay to be sent across to Aden when we are waiting for our documents (which, after all, is the life of the business), we have never been able to quite understand, because the trade, as you are aware, with the Persian Gulf in India, is, comparatively speaking, small now compared to what it is between the Gulf and the United Kingdom. 679. You have not met North German competition, only the South German ?— The Hamburg-American line. 680. That is the only North German competition ?—The only, we term the other Austrian. 681. You work between Manchester and the Thames, and what else ?—Marseilles. 682. To Marseilles ?—Yes. 683. Where you pick up sugar ; and anything else?—We have had the contract with the “ St. Louis ” for ten years, practically ever since I was with Bucknall’s, and I think it is justice to them to say that we had a conversation with them twelve months ago last Whitsuntide, when they gave us the preference for the contract for another seven years rather than accept the German terms 684. Is your trade affected by the peculiar position of Great Britain in the Gulf, that is to say a Protectorate in one or two places, and joint rights with other countries in a place like Muscat ? Do those considerations affect you ?—I am afraid we have not felt that we have been protected. You will excuse me if I speak frankly. 685. Do speak frankly ?—We have lacked any assistance from Great Britain. 686 . What assistance would you like ?—There have been times when we could have not allowed the maladministration which goes on in Persia, and in Turkey particularly, in the way of Customs, in the way of not granting us facilities, in the way of downing every effort we make. 687. Turkey and Persia ?—Turkey and Persia. When you come to England on a matter of that sort they shrug their shoulders for fear of international complications, with Russia presumably. 688 . There might be complication, might there not, if they came too stiffly on Persia, which is an independent country, and Russia the same ?—I think you have done something lately. I speak again rather critically. You have done something withEvidence of Mr. P. Thomas. 65 regard to ourselves by which I think, if you look at the map, you have practically given our trade away to Russia. 689. How ?—The bulk of our trade, the Manchester trade particularly, which is the most valuable trade, comes up to Basra, goes up to Baghdad and finds its way b } 7 this route through Khanikin to Hamadan, and you have all that part of Persia, which is the rich part of Persia. None of the cargo comes this way ; that goes to Bunder Abbas. You have practically placed that within the sphere of Russian influence. Up here ('pointing on the map) they put countervailing duties and octroi and all sorts of things upon us, and if you are not very careful we shall have it here. 690. Do you mean that you anticipate that they will displace a considerable amount of British trade ?—I expect we shall have such countervailing duties or obstacles placed upon us along this coast that it will make it possible for Russia to supply either our cargo through Trebizond or supply their own cargo, rather than that the merchant should ship his goods via Baghdad to Hamadan. 691. Will you state that in another way ?—Yes, I will go gently. A bale of goods from a Manchester warehouse delivered to our ship is not intended for Baghdad. 692. It is delivered to your ships at the Manchester Ship Canal?—Yes. We carry it to Basra : we send it to Baghdad. It is intended for Hamadan. I say you have given away a sphere of influence and given them the control and the possibility of placing countervailing duties on us which will make it possible for Russia to supply either our cargo through Trebizond or supply their own cargo rather than we can afford to take that bale of goods out via Baghdad to Hamadan. The Baghdad trade is Persian trade. Of the quantity of goods used in Mosul, I should think the bulk of the goods find their way down to Trebizond. There are 40,000 or 50,000 people in Baghdad, but that does not represent the hundreds and thousands of tons of cargo and the thousands of yards of cloths and cottons that go from Manchester. 693. How do you expect the completion of the Baghdad Railway, if it ever is completed, to effect what you are saying ?—It will never be completed unless England completes it. 694. Never mind ; let us suppose for a working hypothesis that it is completed ?— It could not pay. We can always carry by water cheaper than they can by rail. You mean the same bale of cargo carried to Trebizond and then sent on by rail ? 695. \es. —We can beat them. Railways from here would never pay, except a short distance railway from Baghdad to Kerbela for pilgrim traffic. The only railway I should like to see is one from Kurna. Kurna is the confluence of the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers. We ought to have that. We ought to have the privilege of having a settlement there. I say that if you strike the centre of Mesopotamia up to Baghdad you may have one of the richest lines in the world with canals there to-day. You only have to open the ends of them to irrigate a country that would feed England. 696. Wheat growing ?—Wheat growing, or barley for instance. It is a magnificent wheat country if it can only be cultivated. There is the land for us. It is desert. I have crossed it, and it is practically derelict. We have not yet been able to dam the Nile, and I am sure we shall not be able to dam the Euphrates and the Tigris. The river breaks its banks and loses itself. 697. Will you kindly force your mind to contemplate the Baghdad Railway as being somehow or other made ?—Yes. 698. Tell us, apart from this bale of Manchester goods—you must often have thought about it what in your opinion would be the general result of the railway being completed ?—Except that Germany may exercise an influence politically when the break-up of the lurkish Empire should come, nothing. If you mean speaking of the effect on trade, nothing. 699. Would not you alter your policy in some respects, I mean the policy of your ships and so forth ?—No. 700. Do you mean if the Baghdad Railway came down to Koweit you would go on sending your boats just the same ?--I do not believe there is a mad man who woutd do it, any more than you would make your docks for London at Southend. You would carry your goods as far up the water as you could, and Kurna is the point. 701. What would become of us after we got to Kurna ?—If we had a railway from Kurna, and you ran it as far as Amara 702. This is in Turkish territory?—In Turkish territory; you rim it to cut you straight across to Kerbela, so as to influence the pilgrim traffic, which is very consider able, and then up to Baghdad. That railway I am convinced would pay by reason of passenger traffic. Of course, for some years the antipathy of the Hindu, or the Believer to travel by railway would have to be surmounted, but it would come as naturally as■aaraBBMMttiffli 66 Fifth Meeting, 19th March, 1908. they travel in India to-day. That is what Germany wants. She does not want the Baghdad Railway. 708. hat does she want ?—She wants that railway that I suggest. 704. She really wants, does she not, the territory that you have described as a great centre of production, and so on ?—Yes. 70o. And you think that we should anticipate that by making this railroad ?—Ybs. 706. How many miles ?—As the crow flies, 220. 707. What about the gradients, and so forth ?—No gradients. A) 8 . All level ?—The plain that Nebuchadnezzar looked upon, as far as eye could see, absolutely rolling prairies, only dried up for want of irrigation. 709. The cost of irrigation would be very heavy, would it not ?—I have passed over mauy miles of canal which have only been allowed to run to rack and ruin by Turkish misrule. 710. Who made these canals ?—Once more, Sir, Nebuchadnezzar. I have proof of what I tell you, Sir. Weisbuch, and Kulderwey, and Andre, the German excavators there, with whom I stayed, could give you proof of that. 711. Is there anything you want to read to us there?—No, I was taking something out in order that I should not forget it before you dismissed me. 712. 4 ell us what it is ?—Coaling stations. That is more important, to my mind just now, if I might suggest it to you, in the Gulf than anything else, because I assume that once Russia has reached as far as we will say Mohammerah, as she will do 1 13. Russia ?—Yes. She will soon be there. She wants a warm water port in Asia, and she has got it. She will make it at very much less cost than she ever made Vladivostock. Therefore I think you want something to check that, and the Island of Kharak I have long considered to be the best spot. It is not an ideal spot; there are no ideal spots iu the Gulf. It is opposite Bushire, 29 miles to the north-west, with fresh water and palms, and it should make a good coaling depot. Then there would be one at Koweit, under the protection of the Sheikh of Koweit, who is a pretty good friend of ours, and one at Ormuz, at the mouth of the Gulf. 714. Then you would have three stations ?—Yes ; but they do not cost much. 715. Never mind ; you would have three—Ormuz, Koweit, and .Kharak ?—Yes. 716. Y\ hat ships would go there to coal?—I am speaking from a strategic point of view, for men-of-war, but of course we could go there, as far as that is concerned. We have always had to base out supplies of coal on the river bank at Basra. 717. At great inconvenience?—At great inconvenience; robbery, spoliation— every obstacle is placed in the way of development by the Turk. I am not prejudiced, Sir, it has burnt into my skin, and you must excuse me. 718. Anything else besides the three coaling-stations?—Yes, I think you should try to get control from the Belgians, if possible, or leave them with it; at any rate you should have a pier at Bushire. Now they land in small boats. I do not want a pier where steamers could go alongside, because that is impossible, but a pier with a bund, as we call it in India. That would facilitate our shipping considerably. Then they will not even allow us to have a telephone at our offices on the river side at Basra. It is an infernal machine to them. 719. They regard it as that ?—Yes, and instead of having one of the finest river wharves, which could be easily made, we are subject to all the whims and caprice of Turkish officials, who are paid out of fines, and we have trouble with quarantine doctors who put on a quarantine, very often an unauthorized quarantine, and make us pay say 50/. to come out of it. We wonder why we stay there ? Well, Sir, some of us must put our hands to the plough, and we do not intend to go back. 720. Is there anything else now you would like us to know?—I am afraid I could go on all night expatiating about the Gulf. 721. No, only some few more minutes ?—I would like to put my little knowledge entirely at your disposal. 722. Sir E. Grey : What do you think brought the Hamburg-American line into the Gulf? What was their object?—Political reasons. 723. And what do you think the political reasons were ?—That Russia might have a say with England in that part of the world. I have always been of the opinion that Russia wants a warm water port. She cannot get it anywhere else. 724. Yes, but then I was only on the point of the Germans. YY&gt;u think the German Government somehow or other, makes up the loss to the Hamburg-Amerika line ?— Yes.Evidence oe Mr. P. Thomas. 67 725. It does not provide that in order to get Russia a warm water port; it provides it for German reasons ?—Yes. 726. What are the German reasons?—I think in Germany, from my experience of them, they generally like to checkmate us as far as possible in the expansion of commerce and colonization, and they imagine that Mesopotamia lends itself to them entirely. I believe that is the reason they started with the railways in Constantinople. I think their system has been for the last eleven years, since I have been back and forth, to try and get control of Turkey. Ostensibly they started it, possibly, because France had Beyrout and Aiexandretta. 727. Then you think the Hamburg-Amerika line has been brought into the Gulf in order that Germany may be ready for development in Mesopotamia ? 1 think if you sat down to-morrow, and you had any difficulties as regards a suzerain Power in the Gulf, Germany would step in, as she has in Morocco, and say she haa a stake there, 728. You think what Germany would care about, as far as the railway is concerned, would be the lower end, and she would not bother about the other end ?—I do not think she would be so foolish as to spend the money. 729. Wiiy spend the money on the lower end ?—Because they have laid themselves out to grab Asia Minor, if I may use the expression. Every railway in Asia Minor to-day is in German hands. 730. But what do you think they are going to do now with the Baghdad Railway ? They are still pushing on at the lower end and not touching the other ?—They fear England. The time is not quite ripe. 731. You said that you had not got the assistance you wanted in the Persian Gulf. What assistance have you asked for in the last eleven years ?—In 1901 I came home overland—from Baghdad to Damascus. A French engineer came into my camp, and after a long talk I found out he was prospecting for the Baghdad Railway, and we caused it to be known. We wrote up to the Foreign Office to say we have something to tell them immediately I arrived. We were told that if Mr. Thomas was wanted he would be sent for, and I have never heard anything more of it since. 732. That is another matter. My question was this : you said you had not had the assistance in the Persian Gulf?—We have not had assistance. It is £ s. d. after all. I suppose now I may touch upon commerce. If you want anything sent to the Gulf or Aden, you put it up for competition. You use the competitors’ quotations, German quotations, or French quotations, or whatever they may be, to cut us down. From a business point of view, from a broker’s point of view in the City, serving you faith fully, it may be right, but from the point of view of your interest in the Gulf, it is w T rong. You might have assisted us. We do not ask charity, but we do ask assistance. You have not held out a hand to us for twenty-rive years. 733. Do you mean a subsidy ?—I do not say a subsidy. There are ways and means. You can have all the cargo going there, you have had it in the past, and you have passed it. 734. I still do not see what the particular assistance you ask the British Govern ment for was ?—I think that if you had shelled out your peas in such a way as to enable us to have a few of them, instead of restricting yourselves to one or two British lines—it has been impressed on you that it is necessary to give them K.C.M.G.’s and other things ; they have to be the be-all and end-all of the Govermnent, and they have done nothing there. They have not shifted 50 tons in the last ten years. My trouble is to get cargo, my trouble is to fill my ships. 735. What I want to know is how have you been disappointed in the assistance given by the British Government ? I cannot believe that trade in the Persian Gulf depends on K.C.M.G.’s and things of that sort. It must be something much more than that ?—It depends on our efforts in getting cargo, and working cargo. I want you to understand that the trade in the Persian Gulf is not a trade that is open to every man. I hold the trade in the Persian Gulf in my hand. The trade is done with the men with whom you can stay, the men you can visit. It is not every 7 man’s trade. You can count on your two hands the houses in the Persian Gulf that rule the trade, and stand in with us. 736. Mr. Morley : What nation are they?—British many of them, in Manchester. Several Baghdadese originally in years gone by. I make the assertion still, Sir, that your Government has done nothing. Even when we have asked assistance over a question of our being fined by these Turkish officials, we have had to put up writh it. [376 j T■mhbbbhbhBHHBB 68 Fifth Meeting, 19th March, 1908. t0 , gi ? backsl Jf esl1 - W e are supposed to have a British territory in Bahrein.

No, certainly not. If the flag is to influence nothing we are justified in giving it up as hopeless and making the best of it, but if it had not been for the British lines lighting year in and year out there would be no Persian Gulf for Great Britain. v V 39 ' \ r ?'

You know Major Cox ?—I knew Major Cox when he was at Muscat, but I think he will te you himself that m view of his difficulty vis-a-vis to Tehran he is, comparatively speaking, helpless. It is not the Resident at Bushire, it is Tehran. Sir llenry Drummond Wolff did as much as he could. y 740. Sir E. Grey : 1 think you spoke of there being a shortage of buoys at Bahrein. Do you suggest that the British Government should buoy those channels ?_ les, 1 do. It is a very small matter. You could buoy the Shat-el-Arab. But there are ways and means of making the Turk do it, and the charges that could be levied drpdJ' t re %i ea /’ i th * at i 1S a jr reat wllarf wareb °n 6 e at Basra, would pay for the dredging of the Shat-el-Arab, and assist everybody. .j T' , Sl f c Hardinoe : How m your opinion would a Russian countervailing duty affect the bale of Manchester goods that you talked of going to Hamadan?—Of course it is according to the size of the countervailing duty, but they could crush it. Persia an^isTossible 7 lmP ° Se W imp ° Sed * 0D c °nfines of f A mi 0n the . nort i he . rn frontier ?—On the northern frontier. „„„ t / fh, 'V 1 ,' 18 ln tbeir ° wn territory. If you read the text of the Treaty you will . ee that the Treaty expressly mentions the independence and integrity of Persia and it is not a, partition of Persia, it is merely a self-denying ordinance ?—But I do not think that would prevent a Russian expressing his willingness to grant a 500 0001 loan to-day for the advantage of controlling the customs on the Persian frontier ’ T , ' 44 - Yf they cannot impose duties, considering what the trade in Persia is ?— ( m 001 °,^ n haVe lm P° sed them in tbat way in Persia if we had lent them o,UU0,0(J(J/. some years ago. * i.

Yes; I was not referring to your particular line at the moment. I meant the general steamers trading to Persia rather than through Bombay. What do you estimate the saving m time will be ?-We could do it in 14 days from Basra to London with the mail, via Brindisi and Suez. -^unuun 749. What is it now ’—More than three weeks. That is everything in the world especially when money is at 8 per cent. 8 ’ 750. 5ou said something about wanting buoys to be put down. Is there any othei P| ac e besides Bahrein which you want buoyed ?—Yes, at the bar at the Shat-el-Arab, the mouth of the Basra River. It is absolutely essential there.Evidence of Mr. P. Thomas. 69 751. At Bushire ?—No. 752. There is one buoy there now, is there not?—There is one buoy there now, but as a matter of fact, as you appoach Bushire you can see the entrance as it were through the inner and outer harbour. It settles itself. A man without a pilot would know enough not to go inside at certain states of the tide. He would not attempt it. 753. Then what do you say as to the reef in the centre, the Shah A11 am shoal? —That does not affect us. Of course there is one very great point that we have in the Gulf. We have not a single lighthouse 754. I was coming to that. Have you formed any idea where you require lights ?— I do not think we want more than three, and I should like, if I may, to send you word of those. I should like to study the distances. You do not want them everywhere. You want the economically necessary points, because there are very high points of land in the Gulf. 755. I am asking you from yoiir practical knowledge, of course.—Yes. I should like to consider that. I could give it. 756. Do you consider that those lights should be put up by the British Govern ment ?—No. I think the Turks should put them up out of the duties they impose. You see I am selfish. I think we might afford to pay for passing lights as we term them. I think that would be reasonable. 757. Mr. Morley : We have not yet found out, I think, what the cost of a light might be expected to be.* Have you any idea ?—I see the one at the Fastnet cost 84,000L I do not suppose we should require anything like that. 15,0007, was the cost of the one at Strumble. 758. Captain Slade : Supposing these lights were put up and the British Govern ment paid a large proportion of the money, would you view the levying of light dues in the Gulf with any favour or not ?—I think we should expect to pay a fair share, but give us an opportunity, would you mind, of consulting you over it. Do not let the Turk place it on us. 759. lou do not mind paying it to the British Government, but you do not want to pay it to the Turk ?—No. I say do not let the Turk impose it on us. He would impose so much that we could not stand it perhaps. 760. General Ewart: As regards Mohammerah being the principal objective of Russia, have you any idea of the route they would come across to get there ?—From Tehran to Hamadan. And then we come to Burujird, and then to Dizful, and then to Shuster (where Daniel was), and thus to the Karun. 761. Mr. Wilson 4ox: Do I understand you to say that if there was a railway between Baghdad and the Gulf it would be cheaper to carry goods by river in such circumstances ?—Baghdad to Kurna ? 762. \ es. Do you say that it would be cheaper to carry goods by river between Baghdad and the Gull ?—That depends upon freight of course, but allow me to remark that in December last year the freignt was, we will say, zero. Three weeks afterwards it was put up ; of course you cannot double zero, but if it were one it would be now two. The freight from Baghdad is three times what it was at the end of last year. I can see from the money that Lynch Brothers have been drawing in for years past it could be carried at less freight than it would pay a railway to run. 763. Supposing the Germans had a railway from Baghdad to the Gulf could British steamers running on the river there compete successfully for the trade to Baghdad ?—Give me Kurna, and allow me to run a line of boats, and if the Germans have a railway I will run against them. On the other hand, if you give me the railway and allow me to run to Kurna I do not want my line of boats. 764. You mean to say if you had the control of the working of the railway rates ? —Yes. From Dresden to Johannesburg is one thing, from Baghdad to Kurna is quite another. 765. Supposing the Germans had that line what ultimate prospects would there be of fighting the railway rates if the British steamers were still plying the river ?— British steamers are not plying the river. 766. But supposing they were ?—The Turks are plying the river. 767. But we have some steamers on that river?—You only have the right to have two, and one in reserve ; and the Turks have seven, and they are building two. It only wants a German to get hold of that line and he will wipe them out. * See, however, Appendix 6, p. 218.70 Fifth Meeting, 19th March, 1908. 7(38. Supposing Great Britain had those six steamers on that river could those British steamers successfully fight the German railway rates on a business footing ?— They could in the Tigris, but they could not on the Euphrates. I have given you a plan of a railway which will tap both. 709. Take the river above Baghdad going up to Samara?—Mosul. 770. What advantage would it be there to have steamers competing with the railway that is coming into Baghdad ?—But you could not run up to Mosul all through the year. Beyond Baghdad the river becomes a torrent for some part of the year. 771. Could you run up to Samara ?—Do you mind showing me Samara. 772. It is here?—That is below. 773. No, it is above Baghdad ?—From Baghdad to Mosul. I have never heard of Samara. I beg your pardon. It is a small place compared with Kut-al-Amara, below Baghdad. Mosul is the principal place above Baghdad. 774 . So that you do not think that steamers there would be much use?—No; nothing but a pair of stern-wheelers would do. 775. Now, I should like to ask a question about the Hamburg-Amerika com petition in the Gulf. They have only started eighteen months?—Nineteen months. 77(3. And therefore they have been at a disadvantage in competing with you, who have been established for some time ?—Yes. 777. What do you think their prospects are there of getting a fair proportion of your trade away from you if they go on ?—In other words, how much have we lost ? 778. No, in the future how much will you lose?—I could run for the whole of the next seven years without losing a penny piece on the present basis. 779. Then you do not think they are going to take it from you ? Is that so ?— No ; but they are disorganizing. The reason I hold it is that I hold by contract. Then if the contractors find at the end of five years from to-day there is a line still steadily pegging away and they are willing to take a contract for 20s. instead of 30s. or 35s., as the case may be 780. Then there is no room for you both?—Then there is no room for us both. You see the trade is a restricted trade as yet. I have not seen it increase outwards. 781. But the German trade has increased outwards ?—No. 782. A little ?—No. 783. At least their trade to Persia has?—Then it is simply cargo displaced from Marseilles. 784. Both their imports and exports increased last year?—Excuse me ; I should not believe them if they said so. 785- I can only speak from the figures I have before me ?—I know there are 5,000 tons of grain in warehouse in Hamburg at this moment, which they have not been able to sell. 78G. Still, I suppose they have taken some of your trade ?—From Antwerp—yes. 787. If they had not come at all, you would be carrying the trade they have got now ?—They have sent out several lots of German sugar. They have financed it themselves. 788. They cannot get export cargo?—They cannot cut in. It is a peculiar thing; you have to lose a lot of money and stick to it a long time before you can induce people to use a new sugar when they have been used to the old sugar. 789. What do you say as to the pearl trade ?—In 1900 a man named Wonckhaus went out from Hamburg and settled at Lingah. I met him on the mail-steamer from Lingah to Bahrein. He confided to me that he was a practically self-constituted German Consul, and that he had sent home reports week by week, and ultimately some notice had been taken. Then he secured a little parcel of shells Bom the British India representative, and gradually for years past the button trade has been resolving itself to Hamburg, Germany, and Saxony, and he has been enabled by the German lines running to Bombay to secure the control of that trade. 790. They carry them at a lower freight ?—28*-. 791. Would you take that ?—I would not pass my door to go up to Hamburg and back for the sake of another 5s. a-ton. 792. Is that a rate which you consider a business rate?—Yes, for them. I would be quite willing to let Hamburg take the shell trade. It is a deck trade. 793. Supposing the Hamburg-Amerika line came to Liverpool and Manchester, what effect would that have on your trade ?—We should have to lower our rates, probably. 794. Supposing you did, do you think they would be able to compete very severelyEvidence of Mr. P. Thomas. 71 with you ?—If the Government go on paying the bill, yes. If they left the Hamburg- Amerika line, no. 795. Lord Esher : Did I understand you to say that owing to the recent delimita tion of the spheres of influence it might he cheaper one of these days to bring a bale of goods from Manchester to Baghdad across by land rather than by the Persian Gulf ?— Yes ; not to Baghdad, to Persia. The bale now comes through Baghdad to Persia. It will reach the same spot in Persia. 796. Then a little later you said you thought that if the Baghdad Railway was completed, even then you would be able to compete with it by sea. Those two state ments seemed to me to be inconsistent ?—They are quite consistent. 797. How?—We should carry to Trebizond the Manchester bale and the Russian transport would arrange it. They do not take it on rail; they take it on camel and mule, which is very cheap compared with the rail, and deliver it by caravan at the point you speak of. You asked me what a railway would charge. I say we should beat the railway charge. 798. I see your point?—I was asked by Mr. Lloyd to mention this. I think Mr. Lloyd-George asked him how Manchester cargo was taken from Manchester to Hamburg. Would you kindly convey to Mr. Lloyd-George that it is taken by Currie’s line from the Manchester Docks to Hamburg and there delivered to the Hamburg- Amerika line. Mr. Lloyd is not quite in touch with these things ; he has so many other things to attend to. Mr. Morley : About the Russian imposition of hostile duties, you do not forget in the Convention the Article saying “ the Governments of Great Britain and Russia have mutually engaged to respect the integrity and independence of Persia, and sincerely desiring the preservation of order throughout that country and its peaceful development as well as the permanent establishment of equal advantages for the trade and industry of all other nations.” Therefore, Sir Charles, am I not right in this ; if they did what Mr. Thomas apprehends, they would be infringing this article ? Sir C. Hardinge : Yes. (The Witness withdrew.) Evidence of Mr. G. Lloyd. 799. Sir E. Grey : Mr. Lloyd, you know Mesopotamia very well ?—Yes, very well. 800. You have travelled in Persia too ?—Only in the Gulf ports. 801. You know the Persian Gulf?—Yes. 802. You have been there quite recently ?—Yes, I w T as there all last year. 803. What is your view of the German competition ? Do you think it is going to be pretty serious ?—Yes, I think it is going to be very serious. It is already serious, I think. It is not only in the future ; it has already begun to be serious, more in its nature than in its quantity. 804. Will you tell us why you think they have started it ?—I think it is political. I think it is done with a political motive to create an interest in a part of the world which is connected with its Islamic policy, with its Eastern policy in Constantinople. They have no trade there, so there could be no trade motive for going there- 805. It is really to complete their Islamic policy ? Yes, and also with reference to the possibilities of the Baghdad railway in future. 806. You have met Germans of course ?—l r es. 807. Do they talk freely about what their views are?—No, they are not at all disposed to talk. 808. Did you meet Mr. Wonckhaus?—Yes. I saw a great deal of Wonckhaus down in the Gulf. 809. He is by way of being an ordinary trader in the Gulf?—l r es, he is an ordinary trader. They have asked him to take up the Consulate once or twice, but he pretends not to be disposed to do so. 810. Is he subsidized ?—I think he undoubtedly has been. I think both the German firms in Mesopotamia have been, and probably are. It is impossible to ascertain for certain. It is known that they started on a capital of about 15,000/., and [376] TJ72 Fifth Meeting, 19 ih March, 1908. developed a turnover of about 80,000/. in one year. That looks rather as if they were subsidized. It is very difficult to do that in a country of that kind without help. 811. His object, or the object of the German Government in encouraging him, is the same as the object in encouraging the Hamburg-Amerika line, to work up the trade in the Gulf in order to have a vested political interest in the Gulf ? Yes. If you want to make up a trade you must have a selling point. Wonckhaus works in Basra and one or two points in the Gulf. 812. Mr. MoRiiEY : He lives at Lingah does not he?—No, he lives at Borasjun. 813. Sir E. Grey : Herr Ballin has lately approached the British ?—Yes, within the last three months. 814. His proposals first of all were for a pool, that they should come to a partnership arrangement, that is to say a shipping pool, which amounts to a partnership. Since then that has been changed to a rate agreement ?—Yes, which, on the whole, is more dangerous. 815. What is the danger of a rate agreement ?—It is the same danger as you have with Germans all over the world. W hen the Germans underquote you under the minimum rate agreement with Germany you have no possible means of detecting the underquote. If you take a through rate which they now quote from a port in inland Germany, say Elberfeld, they quote a through rate, say, from Elberfeld to Uskub, in Macedonia. They quote for the railway from Elberfeld, warehouse charges for Hamburg, for the steamer to Salonica, and over the inland railways from Salonica to Uskub. How can you possibly determine that apportionment ? The German Levant line has a rate agreement with British lines to charge minimum rates. How can you determine what portion of the through rate, say, 25s., which is quoted through Irom one inland port in Germany to another inland port in Macedonia, goes in ships ? It is impossible to determine that. It is impossible to get the secret apportionment list, which is not in the possession of shippers, and which it is very difficult for Government to get. I believe a copy has been got by Government. But that interesting document proves that if the shipping Companies are actually getting the rate that they have agreed to take with the British lines, there is nothing left either for the German State Railways or the Oriental Railways, at least, there is about Is. That does not satisfy the ambitions of two large railways. A rate agreement with German lines is subject to that difficulty all over the world, and they continually underquote, and it is not thoroughly understood by our shipping Companies yet. 816. Do you suppose that Mr. Strick understands it?—I rather doubt it. 817. He might understand the danger is there?—I think he might understand the danger is there. I do not think he understands how great the danger is. Shipping Companies are apt to think the Germans are playing fair when they are not. It is absolutely impossible to check it. That is very likely to be extended over the Oriental railways through to Asia Minor. Some people say it has already begun, but it is very conceivable they will start the same thing. It is one of their objectives. It is a very fine policy to do so, especially as their object is to sell a cheap class of goods in the Persian Gulf, which they can manage better than the heavier goods that we sell. 818. You think the result of a rate agreement between the Germans and us would be to transfer a great deal of the trade to Germany !—Yes ; it has happened already. It has happened, for instance, in the Levant trade. 819. Because the German rate would be about the minimum agreed upon with the Companies, but it would include the railway rates; that they would bring goods from the inland towns at the same rate as our Companies brought them from the ports. It amounts to that ?—It amounts to that. It means that the Germans can very easily underquote our Companies when they are in agreement with them, without any fear of detection. 8'20. Our Companies always having some railway rate to add ?—Yes, of course. We give no subsidized rates in England over the railways for export. 821. What do you anticipate would be the result on British trade of the making of the Baghdad Railway if the Baghdad Railway was completed in German hands ?— Completely in German hands ? 822. Yes.—I think again you would get an extension of this through rate. I do not think it would be very marked for some time. It is rather a broad question, and rather hard to answer. 823. Do you think goods could ever go from Europe to Mesopotamia by the Baghdad Railway instead of going round by sea ?—No, I do not think land carriagemmm BBHi Evidence of Mr. G. Lloyd. could ever compete successfully with the carriage by sea, unless the railway was sufficiently subsidized, as it probably would be. 824. Why should it be subsidized if the Germans had got their ships in the Persian Gulf?—If by that time they are maintaining a large line in the Persian Gulf purely for the Baghdad trade alone they would probably not subsidize both. They would probably subsidize one at a time or send that service back. It would have served its purpose by that time. 825. You think the position is serious so far as British trade is concerned ? I think if you want to keep your trade at all it is extraordinarily serious. I think if they come to a rate agreement you may say goodbye to your trade, not immediately, but say in seven years or so. 826. What steps do you suggest should be taken to meet that?—I suggest that you should give some form of assistance, whatever form you think desirable, to the Companies to enable them to continue the fight. I used to think the Germans would never defeat us in the Persian Gulf. Everything points the other way. The Germans suffered defeat at Madeira, for instance, and they are probably seeing what terms they can make with us. If you study the Ham burg-American balance sheet I think you will admit that this is a favourable time for us to continue warfare and not to make aoreements with them. Herr Ballin said they hoped to remedy that position of affairs by making agreements very favourable to themselves. They had made some and were trying to make others. They have countermanded their American liner and four ships they had already ordered, in view of the bad trade. That is not exactly the time in my opinion to make terms with your enemy. 827. Do not you think the British Companies could beat them off without assistance ?—I do not think there is the slightest chance of it. They offer you every assistance in looking at their books, and prove they have not made any profit for the last two years. We have seen the British India returns, and we know they are making a heavy loss. That is partly owing to a fast mail service. W r e know they make a loss, and we know they are well run. I know by hearsay that these lines are also not doing well. They have not made a loss, but one of these lines has passed its ordinary dividend, and the other is a private concern, and you cannot tell, but they have offered to show us their books, which are duly audited, to prove the case. The advantage you get if you continue the fight is a very big one at the moment, because all our trade in the Persian Gulf is suffering from one thing, and that is that it is purely one trade. It is purely a Manchester trade, and the Germans are building up round us very ably a variety of trade in every form of article, and if by chance you got your Manchester trade hit, which experts say is going to happen before very long, owing to Indian and Japanese competition, your trade goes. Many people say the Manchester trade is already doomed in the East. 828. Mr. Morley : You mean in the Gulf ?—No, generally speaking in the East. 829. Sir E. Grey : Doomed by Indian and Japanese competition ?—les, India is already knocking Manchester completely out in many markets. ] herefore by giving low rates for a few years, you would give manufacturers a chance of developing a trade in cheap articles. They could not do it if for lack of assistance you put the seal of your approval upon the making of another shipping ring down in the Gulf. Shipping rings restrict trade, and they have never done anything else. 830. What else do you think is required in the Gulf?—I think lighterage is one of the most important things, and lighting, and the development of roads, of course, from the ports. . . 831. Lighterage is rather a thing to be done by some shipping firm getting a Concession, or some private firm ?—I should think one of the shipping Companies, or all the British shipping Companies engaged in the Persian Gulf, could possibl}^ take up the lighterage, and find it remunerative. 832. Who would you get the Concession from ?—I should think that would have to be obtained by force. It would require very little. I should think if you gave a mandate to the people at Bushire to settle that matter it could be dealt with. If you gave them an order to settle the matter with the hamieldash it could be settled. It is a matter which is a festering sore in all these ports. He is an individual who levies a very unjust and purely arbitrary toll on all goods that come in, and he sends out lighters to the ships at his own sweet will, or keeps thern^ back, according to the bribe you give him. That gentleman has to be got rid of. He is not a Persian official. T he right to do this is farmed out to him at so much a year by the Persian Government.74 Fifth Meeting, 19th March, 1908. 833. Then it is rather a subject of negotiation with Tehran?—Yes, I should think a matter like that would be better dealt with locally. I should think it could be settled, by dealing directly with the hamieldash. • V ^ We were §* ve M a j° r Cox an order he would ask what steps he would be entitled to take, and what assistance he should have ?—Those steps would have to be defined probably. 835. What steps would they be ?—I am not really qualified to speak of all the steps ; I have not thought them out, but T should think probably he could take on the lease from the hamieldash before he got his footing. 836. Major Cox could take it ?—Some British agent, some agent for the shipping Company. i ^ &amp; 837. But how would he get it ?—By paying a larger sum down for the farming than the hamieldash at present gets. He runs it very badly, and you could make it pay veiy much better than the hamieldash does, by proper management. 838 You said it would require force to begin with, but this is not force ?—It is a narrow definition. I think you might first of all try to make it worth the while of the hamieldash to transfer it. I think he would do it. I think later on, when he found t/e )Lltl ^ a were making a good thing out of it, he would try to get it back again, and then you would have to put your foot down. 839. Putting your foot down means a gun-boat ?—I do not think it means even that. 840 \\ ho would do it ? I think the shipping Company would. Sir James Mackay told me he would be only too delighted to take up the lighterage question at once because there was a mint of money in it. 841; So that it would mean instructing Major Cox to go to the hamieldash and trv to negotiate?—res. 843. And where else is the lighterage question urgent ?—In a lesser degree at .Kasra or Hayir, but I think Bushire and Bahrein are the two most important places. . . at 18 ^ le system of lighterage at Basra ?—It is only a few yards ; it is up a river, but m these other parts of the Gulf you very often have ten miles and a rough sea between the ship and the shore. ... . 1 t ^ le British India Company could get the lighterage at Bushire so easily, it it is simply a question of inducing the Persians to sell, I do not quite understand why they have not tried it already?—Because I do not think there has ever been a e mte scheme, and there has been no definite promise of support from the British Government. I hey have never understood it was a matter in which the British Government was interested. It has been a matter that has been wanting attention for some time, and I do not think it has come up for attention so far as I am aware, t imk the Indian Government have spoken of it once or twice, probably verv often. Mr. Morley : Not very often. 845. biR E. Grey : You have been all through Mesopotamia ?—Yes. 846. lou think there are enormous potential developments in Mesopotamia? — Enormous, probably unparalleled, I should think. 847. 4 he last witness we had told us that in his opinion what the Germans reallv cared about was a line from Mohammerah to Amara and to Kut-al-Amara, and then across to verbeta. He did not think they would make the upper part of it?—I do not think he spoke with knowledge, if he spoke of a line from Mohammerah to Kurna. There con d be no possible question of a line from Mohammerah to Kurna, if I understand the question. In fact, I will say definitely I am sure there could be none. ^ ^ e ? ailse y°' njean it is not practicable ?—There is no conceivable object. It is no piactica e. do not see the object in building a line from Mohammerah to ikurna it you have got to compete with river traffic. 849. How about a line from Baghdad to Mohammerah?—That would depend on which side of the river the Germans decided to build the railway. At present, as the Concession runs they have to build it on the other side of the river, on the right bank. I hat was probably when they had Koweit as an objective. Now that that is altered Vf/ might probably try to bring the line down the other side, but then there is the difhcuity of its being m Persian territory, which would always be a great difficulty. oou. 1 he view of the witness we had just now was that this would be a paying line, and the object of the Germans was to make a railway there in order to get the pi gum traffic .-—The hue between Kerbela and Khanikin is probably the most important part of the Baghdad railway. That is what he was referring to. That lineEvidence of Mr. G. Lloyd. 75 on the lowest estimate would probably repay the capital outlay in two years, possibly in one. 1 hat is rather a large order, but I think I could prove it on paper. It is absolutely the most important piece to British interests. In any other hands it could prove very, very detrimental to us, politically and commercially, if the road or the line to Khanikin went into Russian or German hands. There is no Concession out between Klianikin and Kerbela, and there is one out from Sandidje (Sandia) to Baghdad. That is an important point if we ever wish to make a railwav to Ivhanikin. 851. Why should it be so important politically? It would be commercially important if it tapped the^ pilgrim traffic —Yes, and the pilgrim traffic has a certain political importance. It is important commercially and politically. You cannot separate the two on that line, or, indeed, anywhere in Mesopotamia. Where you are commercially predominant you will be politically predominant, and now that the important towns in Central Persia, which are the objectives of our caravans going up there, are in the Russian zone, it seems to me to be of paramount importance that we should maintain our rights on the road to Khanikin as far as the Persian frontier. It is in no way a Russian interest or a German interest. The figures of the trade are 750,000k per annum of British trade, and I think 142,000k was the last figure I saw of Russian trade, which is the next best thing. It seems to me purely a British interest, and not a Russian or German interest. 852. The important thing being that the British make the line from Baghdad to Khanikin ?—Y 7 es, or a point below. You would come across the Germans in your path if you tried to make a line from Baghdad. But you could make up a very good case for claiming to make a line from a point slightly below Baghdad to Khanikin. On its merits you could probably make a good case. There would probably be difficulties, because the Germans expect to be able to make the line to Khanikin, but you have every right to build a line to Khanikin. 853. Where else can the Baghdad Railway come out to the Persian Gidf besides Koweit. Do you consider Koweit is the best place ?—I suppose probably it is the best place. There are a few difficulties, marshes, and so on. Um-Kasr is very unlikely for various reasons, and Basra. Now that they are not likely to go to Koweit, Basra is the most likely one they will go to if the Germans build it at all. I think it will be unlikely for the Baghdad Railway to be built beyond Baghdad for a certain time. But they would only be anxious to get to the head of the Gulf where, if you look at the Concession, I think it is paragraph 37, you will notice the very strict wording of the Concession as regards the construction of ports, docks, and quays, which the Germans are given on the Persian Gulf. There are no clauses regarding the levying of dues, and the Germans would be in a position to charge foreign shipping any dues they liked. That is a point to remember always there. The most-favoured-nation treat ment rates there could be obviated, as they are obviated elsewhere, very easily. They could put difficulties in the way of our trade. But once they get there, I admit you would be probably turning your back on the Gulf in any case, so it would not be of any great importance. 854. Supposing they were bound morally by a most-favoured-nation clause or an equal rate clause, what difficulties do you anticipate ?—I could draw you up a list of ways in which these things can be evaded and are daily evaded, but I should be rather puzzled to give you a list of them at present out of my head. 1 could quote you several instances of rate evasion, and, as I said before, of shipping rate evasion, but it is not very easy to give a categorical list from memory. But there are many ways. It is very obvious that there must be many ways of giving preferential treatment to your own cargo and your own shipping in a place where there are no restrictions as to your power of dealing with the shipping, and the power behind you is an Oriental Power. 855. Mr. Wilson Fox : What chances are there of developing other lines of British trade, except Manchester goods, in Southern Persia ?—I think if you took up the matter soon, and you had low shipping rates, and only in that case, there are many trades which could develop in Mesopotamia. 856. But it would have to be brought to the notice of British manufacturers here who would be likely to be exporters as to what lines of goods it would pay them to go into for the purposes of that trade ?—Quite so. There are many ; there are all forms of hardware, machinery, agricultural implements, and so on. 857. Who does that now ?—Germany does all the hardware entirely. They have taken all that from us. That has gone entirely; we practically do not do any. [376] Xmmmm 76 Fifth Meeting, 19th March, 1908. Germany has taken away all that form of trade by judicious and clever imitations of British goods, as she does elsewhere. She has been most successful. 858. But is it a question of goods which the natives think more useful and more attractive than ours ?—No, it is because the people do not know, and they are apt to buy the cheapest thing. Most of them cannot read, and they have an old habit of always asking for English goods. I suppose it is the only thing they know; they have never heard of any other nation except England. The German is asked for English goods, and he shows them something with a trade-mark on it. He says that is English, and the man cannot read. 859. But you still think we can do more trade than we are doing?—Infinitely, there is no question about it. 860. Lord Esher: Have you seen the last Hamburg-Amerika balance sheet?— Yes. 861. When was it issued ?—I do not know. I have got it here. 862. Is there any trace of a subsidy in it ?—You cannot trace the subsidy. 863. How do you suppose that if a subsidy is given it is covered up there in the balance sheet?—It is said to be paid into the Emperor’s private purse, and paid out; but again there are different ways of doing it. The trade is subsidized over the German State Railways to begin with, as we know. That is openly admitted. With regard to the subsidy to the Hamburg—Amerika line, we made very careful inquiry when I was at Constantinople to try and ascertain what it was, and the answer we got was that it was done through the Emperor. 864. Does the balance sheet of a German Company appear audited in the way in which the balance sheet of an English Company appears ? Is there any certificate by the auditors ?—The published balance sheet gives you about as little information as to the figures as any document could possibly give. There is no means, as far as I know, of tracing the subsidy. 865. It would be very difficult in one of our balance-sheets for any subsidy to appear without it being able to be traced ?—No, I think you could put away a very large sum without it being shown. Sir W . Nicholson : If you are building a certain number of ships you can show they have cost you less than they have. The auditor does not examine your pay bills for your workmen, or the amount you pay for angle iron and iron sheets, and so on. ^ ou say you have paid 10,000L when really you may have paid 15,000L No outsider can detect that in a balance sheet, at least I think not. 866 . Lord Esher : It is my ignorance. I am very surprised. I should have thought it would have been very difficult to conceal a Government subsidy in the balance sheet of a Railway Company or a large shipping line here in this country ? I think it is certainly so in Germany. I think it is very possible in England. Sir W. Nicholson : Balance sheets of American railways are the most beautifully drawn up documents in the world, and yet they are said to conceal things and not to disclose full information. 867. Lord Esher: I should have thought any firm of auditors here would have been bound to detect any subsidy, and if so, that they would insist that it was noticed in some way in the balance sheet. Do you say it would not be possible to find it out in a German balance sheet ?—I think in a German balance sheet it might be absolutely impossible from the amount of information they give you. 868 . Sir E. Grey : Supposing Mesopotamia becomes developed in the course of time, and irrigated, I suppose that would increase the Gulf trade very much, would not it ? A great deal of trade would go in and out of the Gulf ?—I suppose it must have a tendency to increase trade. I do not see why it should necessarily increase the trade of the Southern Gulf ports at all, or very little. It will increase the trade of Basra and Baghdad very enormously, but I do not think it would naturally have much effect upon Bushire or upon the southern ports.mmmaamamm aammmammmmmrnmmammmmm Evidence of Mr. G. Lloyd. 77 869. There would be more trade going up and down the port ?—Yes, a great deal more. There must be a great deal more ; I beg your pardon. 870. Would you mind my putting a leading question ? You have studied the whole thing and thought about it very much. \Y hat would your policy be now with regard to the Gulf? Could you just sum it up as to the actual steps that you think the British Government ought to take. You have told us one or two. You think we ought to do something at Bahrein ?—I think the question of Bahrein is a step we ought to go into afresh as regards defining our position there. I think lighterage ought to be gone into all over the Gulf to give facilities for our communications. The Muscat questions are practically settled. The lighting is very important, and the lighterage. I think those stand out clearly. I think there are a great many things. 871. And supporting the shipping to tide over this critical moment?—It seems to me you must keep open your communications down there, unless you are prepared to spend a very much greater amount of money on your naval squadrons in those waters. Unless you keep your strength and your communications open and strong, both in the Gulf and in the country behind the Gulf, I think you may be faced with very large naval expenditure. 872. Mr. Morley : What do you mean by the country behind the Gulf?—In Southern Turkey, where our interests are paramount, in the Province of Iran, in Southern Mesopotamia. If you let any Power come down into Mesopotamia south of Baghdad, or indeed cut across your line from Baghdad to Khanikin (because that would disintegrate your position just as much in the long run), I think absolutely you may say good-bye to your position in the Persian Gulf within quite an appreciable period, not in 60 years, probably 20 years or 15 years; and if our power were gone in the Gulf, it is not difficult to imagine what our position as regards India would be. It would be considerably weakened, and that is why I feel that this steamer question in the Gulf is one of much greater importance than it appears. It is a question which affects our communications down there, which are being threatened on every side—railway, roads, and now steamers. The Germans have felt our position, politically, throughout the Persian Gulf as regards Koweit and the terminus, and they have now taken a wise course and determined to attack us commercially, and to have interests in the Gulf, where they had none, and to attack us, as they have done very successfully in some parts of the East, through these cheap trades. Wherever they can they make rate agreements with British Companies and underquote them systematically, and then we are surprised to find our markets going. Our markets do go as regards cheap trade We maintain our magnificent figures as regards the Manchester trade in the East, but that is where commerce is standing on one leg ; it is not safe. We have seen a sign of it in the returns already; the trade is being attacked, and directly the Manchester trade is attacked it goes. That is why the communications are very important, I think, and why I think it is deficient in the Gulf as regards our communications, unless we are prepared to do something to strengthen them, and see if we cannot bring the Germans to better terms with us. Perhaps we might be fortunate enough to drive them to markets where they have real interests and not fictitious ones. 873. You said a moment ago that if our interests were impaired in the Persian Gulf it would have a very grave effect on our position in India. I do not ask the question controversially, but would you mind saying how ?—If you lose your commerce in the Gulf in my opinion, you have only to read history with regard to the Gulf to see that trade and politics, ever since the days of the Portuguese, have gone absolutely hand in hand. If you lost your commercial position you would very likely lose your political strength and prestige, and with that you have less power to maintain your strategical advantages there. 874. You think our prestige would be so impaired ?—By a loss of our commerce ? 875. No. Supposing the Hamburg-Amerika operations and the kindred opera tions succeed in beating Sir James Mackay and Mr. Bucknall and so forth, you think that that would have a serious effect on our prestige in India ?—Indirectly, inasmuch as the Persian Gulf position is a very important one to India. I believe that is accepted, is it not ? 876. Would you mind telling me exactly how ? What is the importance to India ? What is the amount of it in volume ?—The importance, I have always understood, of the Persian Gulf to India is a strategical one, and for the maintenance of that strategical position, preventing any one else coming in and making ports, docks, or naval bases in the Gulf, you have got to make a strong political position there.78 Fifth Meeting, 19th March, 1908. 8/7. l am not contradicting or arguing there. 1 only say I do not see now the direct ielation between all this in the Gulf and our great power and so forth in India ? I meant merely that to safeguard India you have got to keep other Powers out of a stiong position in the Persian Gulf, and you cannot do that if you lose your political hold, and your commerce and your politics go hand in hand. Therefore they all hang together. That is what I meant to convey. [Adjourned.]Sixth Meeting, Wednesday, 25th March, 1908. PRESENT: The Right Hon. J. Morley, O.M., M.P., Secretary of State for India (in the Chair). The Right Hon. Sir E. Grey, Bart., M.P., Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. The Viscount Esher, K.C.B., G.C.V.O. The Right Hon. Sir 0. Hardinge, G.C.M.G., G.C.V.O., Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Sir R. Ritchie, K.C.B., Political and Secret Secretary, India Office. Captain E. J. W. Slade, M.A .0., Director of Naval Intelligence. General Sir W. G. Nicholson, K.C.B., Quartermaster-General. Major-General J. S. Ewart, C.B., Director of Military Operations. Captain Sir C. L. Ottley, K.C.M.G., M.V.O. ( Secretary ). Mr. H. F. B. Lynch, M.P., and Major James Archibald Douglas attended as witnesses and were examined. Evidence of Mr. H. F. B. Lynch, M.P. (Mr. A. Wilson Fox, C.B., of the Board of Trade, was also present.) 878. Mr. Morley : We all know, of course, in a general way, your interests in the Persian Gulf. Is there anything you would like to tell us more particularly as to how you are acquainted with it, and so on ?—Only that I have travelled there pretty extensively. My first journey was in 1889, when I went from the Gulf of Alexandretta to Killis, which is the place where the Baghdad Railway is to enter Mesopotamia, and through Urfa to Diarbekr, whence I floated down the Tigris in a raft to Baghdad, and thence proceeded to the Persian Gulf. That was my first visit to those regions. 879. But would you mind telling us rather more generally than biographically : I will put it in this way, how do you think the Baghdad Railway, when it is constructed, will affect your interests in the Gulf and in Mesopotamia ?—I suppose my interests in the Gulf are interests of river steamers. I have very little share in the trade of this country with those countries, at all events in the export trade. The export trade has fallen very largely into the hands of the natives of the country themselves. 880. What do you do on your river steamers ?—We carry goods. 881. What do you carry ?—All kinds of goods from Europe and India, mainly piece goods. 882. Where do they come into your shipholds ?—At Basra. 883. And what do you do with them?—We carry them up to Baghdad. 884 . How many days ?—That is about three or four days, I suppose. 885. Suppose the Baghdad Railway were made, how do you expect you and your partners would be affected ? How do you expect it would affect this transport of goods from Basra to Baghdad ?—The main effect that it would have as regards trade there is that it would open up these countries to the markets of Central Europe. Never forget that these railways in Turkey are constructed by means of kilometric guarantees, that is to say, that they have their interest guaranteed. There is no such guarantee with steamer enterprises. The steamer enterprise has to pay its way. In the case of the railway enterprise it does not make any difference whether it pays or not. 886 . How exactly would the construction of this railroad bring the goods of Central Europe? I mean what goods?—The goods of Austria and Germany: all [376] • Y80 Sixth Meeting, 25th March, 1908. goods that are at present brought in connection with the Anatolian Railway in Asia Minor and with the railway in Europe which you know more familiarly as the line crossed by the Orient Express. This line goes from Vienna to Buda-Pesth, from Buda- Pesth to Belgrade, from Belgrade to Sofia, from Soha to Constantinople. There is to be a bridge over the Bosphorus to connect this railway with the Baghdad Railway. 887. Would you tell us what are the goods which you take in your steamers, and what would be the competition in those goods from Central Europe ? Are they goods of a kind in which the competition of Central Europe would be very active ?—Yes. 888 . As for example ?—As for example piece goods, as for example sugar. That of course is not a British product. That is about the only product which is sold in very considerable quantities in those countries which does not at present come from Great Britain. 889. That is taken by other lines from Marseilles into the Gulf ?—Yes, by British lines. 890 ; Then it goes into your ships ?—Yes, and so up to Baghdad, and from Baghdad by the Khanikin trade route into Persia. 891. Would that trade be affected by the Baghdad Railway?—I should think it certainly would be. 892. Of course you do not include France in Central Europe ?—No, but Central Europe produces sugar as well as France. 893. No doubt. Then it would injure the French sugar people ?—I should certainly think so. \ ou see the Baghdad Railway would have to carry some goods. Given a railway with the interest on its capital paid it can carry goods at nominal rates. I do not wish to suggest that it would pay to carry the goods by railway from Central Europe to Baghdad as against sea carriage to Basra and river carriage from Basia to Baghdad. Certainly not. But if you go and subsidize that railway as against river transport and enable them to carry the goods practically for nothing, there is every reasonable prospect of supposing that competition from Central Europe would ensue, and that such competition would fall upon British goods. 89-f. Apart from this subsidy, if that is the right name for it, w r ould your river transport successfully compete with the railroad ? Could you do it cheaper than they could ? From C entral Eiirope, certainly, there is no question of it ; but as regards the question of river communication from Basra to Baghdad, I cannot say to what extent a railway would compete with the river steamers. That is very largely a question of the channel, but I think the Committee could get very valuable information about that^—I have come here to inform the Committee not in my own interests, but in national interests in connection with the railway along the Irrawady. I imagine there is a railway^along the Irrawady at present, but I have not gone closely into that. 895. You have heard, I am sure, of proposals made we will say to tap the Baghdad Railway at Khanikin, or elsewhere. How would that affect you in your traffic ?—Do you mean from the side of Russia when you say to tap it ? 890. lo tap it by a third party. Any set of capitalists might come, or we might come and demand from the Persian Government a concession for a railroad tapping the Baghdad Railway. Coming down, you mean, from the Persian frontier to Khanikin. 897. How would that affect you?—-I cannot see how that could affect British trade in any way. 898. It would not affect you?—No. In connection with that I should like to say that that is the only railway in those regions which I consider would pay without a kilometric guarantee. 899. Which railway?—The railway along the Khanikin trade route. Years ago my father endeavoured to get a concession for that, and we made out the Statutes ; the whole thing went a considerable distance, and we all of us made up our minds' that that railway would pay without a kilometric guarantee because of the pilgrim traffic; there are the pilgrims coming down to Kerbela that way, and all the region round Hamadan is a very fine grain-growing district. You would have three sources of supply. Y ou would open up the region round Hamadan on the one hand ; secondly, you would get the pilgrim traffic; and, thirdly, you would carry all the trade -which passes up the trade route, mainly Manchester goods. 900. You come into the Gulf where ? Where do you start from, rather?—We come into the Gulf at Basra; we start at Baghdad. Then we have a branch line up the Karun from Mohammerah, which is a little way below Basra—some 20 miles. The River Karun goes up to the base of the Persian mountains, and we have one service on the Karun and another service on the Tigris. 901. Have you any observations to make about the Gulf itself ? You have often81 Evidence of Mr. H. F. B. Lynch, M.P. been in its waters? I cannot say I have made as thorough an exploration of the waters ol the Persian Gulf as 1 have of other parts of Persia. I think the best modern, up-to-date authority on that is Mr. Lovat Fraser. I should have several observations to make on that question as regards, for instance, the line which has been drawn delimiting the British sphere ; but I do not know whether that is a subject which the Committee wishes me to speak about. 902. Yes, go on ?—For instance, I have not quite understood myself upon what principle that line has been drawn to Bunder Abbas. Bunder Abbas is not a port in any sense of the word, and if you want to control the head of the Gulf what you have got to do is to get the islands of Kishm, Henjam, and Larak within your sphere. Those islands command the entrance to the Gulf ; and by drawing the line to Lingah, a little further west of Bunder Abbas, you would have at all events removed a fruitful ground of diplomatic difficulties. 903. That is of course, as you know now, past history ?—That is past history, but I think the Committee might possibly not lose sight of the great importance of those islands in connection with Persian Gulf questions. 904. If precautions were taken to prevent the controllers of the Baghdad Railway from establishing discriminating rates, would that modify your aversion to it?— Discriminating as between different countries ? 905. Of course, what is said is that, as the Germans made the road, they would naturally discriminate against non-Germans ?—That would not remove my objections. 906. Putting it broadly, your objection is an objection to competition ?—No, not at all, if you mean competition as between river and railway. 907. What is it ?—There are many objections. 908. Will you enumerate them as shortly as you can?—1 have drawn out a Memorandum on that subject.'^ I should like to hand this in to the Committee. It has been got out rather hastily. There are Annexes of the facts upon which it is based, and I have stated the grounds, 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, from which I should certainly infer the building of the Baghdad Railway cannot be in the interests of this country. 909. Can you tell us meantime, orally, the pith of that ?—The pith of that is this, that first of all the Baghdad Railway must impose a tremendous strain upon the finances of Turkey, and therefore the effect of it must be to drive Turkey into a financial position which will be very serious for the future independence and integrity of the Turkish State. That I consider to be one of the principal objections to the Baghdad Railway. 910. Now the second ?—In connection with that, the only way in which you can build the Baghdad Railway on a proper basis is in connection with a scheme of irrigation. If you irrigate Mesopotamia, and thereby bring a great population into the country and increase the wealth of the country, you render it possible to put a railway there on sound economical lines. Therefore I regard the. Baghdad Railway system as necessarily bound up with an irrigation scheme, and I think the irrigation scheme should precede the railway scheme. 911. Who is going to do the irrigation?—I think the Baghdad Railway under their concession possess powers to that effect, but of course as to who is to do it, I suppose an independent concession could be got. You know Sir William Willcocks has been trying very hard to put that through. He is in Constantinople now. I should say the irrigation scheme should certainly precede any railway scheme. 912. Now the third objection?—There is the great objection that this railway is a strategical railway. We think of the Baghdad Railway to a great extent as a railway through Asia Minor, through Baghdad, and so to the Persian Gulf. But it is not entirely that. The Baghdad Railway is a railway with two great arms. They separate at Kill is ; one arm goes to Mecca and Medina, and the other goes to Baghdad and the Persian Gulf. The Mecca and Medina branch enables Turkey, especially in connection with the Baghdad branch, to mass troops at any moment on the Egyptian frontier. There is a branch line to the Gulf of Akaba, and at any moment that Sir Edward Grey wants to bring friendly arguments to bear at the Dardanelles, I imagine that the Sultan would reply by bringing similar friendly arguments of a strategic nature to bear on the frontiers of Egypt. I think that is a serious aspect of the question to this country. 913. Rather problematical, is not it? However, I will not argue with you. \\ hat is the fourth objection?—Then, from the point of view of British trade, it cannot, it seems to me, be desired in any way. The only effect from the point of view of British trade can be competition with British trade on the part of Central European trade. That I think is perfectly certain. At present the trade of Mesopotamia amounts to * AppendiX'9, p. 263.82 Sixth Meeting, 25th March, 1908. about millions sterling a-year. By far the larger proportion of it is British and Indian trade. The main element of foreign trade in it is sugar from Marseilles, which we do not produce. Obviously a great inroad would be made on that trade, on the manufactures of India and Great Britain, by the* completing of this railway, and if you want to increase trade from Great Britain and India with Mesopotamia, the way to do it is to improve the course of the Euphrates and Tigris so as to enable bigger river steamers to be put on, to enable those steamers to navigate at all seasons, and also to irrigate the country, and therefore to bring a greater population on it. That is the interest of British trade. Nobody would dream of building the Baghdad Railway from the point of view of British interests. If you cannot help it, that is another question. 914. Have you a fifth objection ?—I do not know whether I have got any more. Of course, if there is a branch of the Baghdad Railway up into Russia, adjoining the Russian possessions, that would enable Russia, again, to bring down troops into Mesopotamia, and therefore I imagine that the Turkish Government would hardly be favourable to that. Of course, it takes the whole Turkish position in Asia Minor in flank if the Russians can send down troops into Northern Mesopotamia. The Turkish main army corps is at Erzinjan. Erzinjan is just west of Erzerum. Of course in sending down the troops there, it takes the whole position in flank. 915. The Turkish steamers compete with you on the river ?-■ The Turkish steamers take the greater part of the cargo. 910. Where do they get their cargo from ?—From the same sources as our cargo. 917. Do they convey British merchandise?—Certainly. 918. Largely ?—Largely. 919. Any German merchandise ?—German merchandise is practically non-existent. It is just beginning. They have got now a monthly line of steamers to the Persian Gulf, the Hamburg-Amerika line. 920. Yes, we have heard of that ?—It is purely in its infancy. It is a very very small affair at present as regards the imports into that country. 921. Sir E. Grey : What would you recommend now as the proper British policy to pursue, putting the concrete points that we should make our objective ?—As regards our policy towards the Baghdad Railway ? 922. Yes, and policy generally. As regards the Persian Gulf question I mean. The Baghdad Railway is one part of the Persian Gulf question, and Southern Persia is another part of it?—Quite so. I should recommend that the British Government should strengthen their hold, as far as possible, upon the Persian Gulf. 923. How would you do that ? We are all agreed upon that, but the particular steps ?—I think the only way, it seems to me, you can do that is to continue even more strenuously the course that you have been at present pursuing, that is to say, possibly you may do something in the way of lighting the Persian Gulf, and you may do some thing in the way of buoying. After all, they are only questions of that kind. Policing the waters you do already extremely efficiently, so as regards the waters of the Persian Gulf itself it would be to continue the same policy you are at present pursuing. I do not know whether there is any special policy which has occurred to Mr. Lovat Fraser in his recent journey to the Gulf, but I have nothing to bring forward to the Committee. 924. As regards the Baghdad Railway, what do you say we can do there ?—As regards the Baghdad Railway, my strong advice would be to do nothing to assist it. If we can prevent the Baghdad Railway being built, it is certainly not a British interest that it should be built. But it is a British interest, if it must be built, then, that we should have control over certain sections. As regards the first question, is it probable, is it possible, that this railway will be built ? I have always been of opinion, as I think you know, and still remain of that opinion, that the Baghdad Railway can only be built with the assistance of England. I have got out a financial statement which I will hand to the Committee, showing exactly the finance of the Baghdad Railway, showing I think plainly that it would be impossible to raise the money for the Baghdad Railway without coining to England—coming to England, that is to say, to get the security free. The only security after all, to put it broadly, upon which the money market of Europe will lend money to Turkey is on the security of the Ceded Revenues. You have got your hold on that, because if you were at any time to refuse your consent to the continuance of the extra 3 per cent, customs duties, Turkey would be in the position of having no revenues upon which to borrow money to pay her army in Macedonia. Therefore I do not see how Turkey can give that security unless she comes to a prior arrange ment with you that you will give your consent to make the 3 per cent, permanent.83 Evidence of Mr. H. F. Ji. Lynch, M.P. That is as regards the point as to whether the Baghdad Railway can be built without us. llien, if for any reason you should not desire to stand in the way of the railway, I should like to put it in this way, that Germany should not have the control of 'the line beyond Killis Ivillis is the point of bifurcation of the two great sections, one running to Mecca and Medina and the other running to the Persian Gulf. There is a railway at present from Aleppo to Damascus in the hands of the French, and the railway from Damascus to Mecca and Medina is, I think, in the hands of the Sultan entirely. I do not know whether the northern section is, but any way the Damascus-Aleppo section is at present in the hands of the French, and it is the standard gauge of railway, and I imagine if we cannot control the Killis-Aleppo section we should at all events make arrangements for the French to do it, and not the Germans. Then it seems to me that from Killis to the Persian Gulf ought either to be under British control or under Anglo-French control. In that connection I would like to say this, that I do not think it can be taken for granted that the line to be followed by the railway will be the present projected line. The present projected line crosses the Euphrates just east of Killis, and it crosses a most inhospitable region inhabited by the Shammar Arabs to Mosul. The railway between the passage of the Euphrates and Mosul would become a kind of Manchurian Railway, that is to say, a railway which has to be very heavily policed, and it is questionable whether in the long run that line will be adopted. That is the reason why I point to Killis as the spot where control should commence, because obviously the better plan, if any of us in this room had to build the railway, even in the interests of the Turks, would be to take the railway down the Euphrates ; then, if you look at the map, you will see the Euphrates approaches to within thirty-five miles of Baghdad. You therefore simply build your branch to Baghdad, and then later on build your line north of that to Mosul and the northern regions. That seems to me to be the natural line for a railway to follow in those regions. So I do not think it can be quite taken as certain that the line as at present projected will be built in that form. There are other reasons, but mainly for that reason, or at all events for that reason in a great degree, I should certainly advocate that the non-German control should commence at Killis. 925. Of course it is at present a German concession, the whole thing ?—Y r es. 926. That is taking away pretty well three-quarters of it from the Germans ?—Is it ? You mean that the Killis-Persian Gulf section would be three-quarters. 927. Of the length of the whole Baghdad Railway ?—Are you taking the length of the whole of the Baghdad Railway, including the Syrian section ? 928. I was not coming to that part. That is either Turkish or French. I was taking it from Konia ?—Do not you take the Baghdad Railway as from the Mediter-' ranean ? Take the whole of it, from Constantinople to Konia. 929. We call that the Anatolian?—l r es, but the through railway is the Baghdad Railway. 930. It is a separate concession to the Baghdad Railway ?—You go in your through carriage. 931. l r es; but Asia Minor having been the objective of the Germans, it must mean telling the Germans they must give up practically half Asia Minor?—Asia Minor 1 take it to be the region which the Germans have got to the extreme eastern limit of, that is to say, they are very nearly at the Taurus. 932. You take the whole of Mesopotamia from them?—Certainly; not let the Baghdad Railway come under German control into Mesopotamia. 933. It is a big operation of disgorging ?—But I may tell you this, that after all it is not a view unfamiliar to the Germans. I think I told you some time ago that my colleague, Colonel Picot, had an interview with the German Ambassador in Constanti nople, and the words he used were: “We will not put a trowel into the soil of Mesopotamia without coming to some arrangement with you.” I thiuk they understand that. The problem is entirely different in Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia cannot be colonized by white people. It is an entirely different problem to the problem of Asia Minor, Asia Minor being a high upland habitable by white people, and Mesopotamia being a second India. They are entirely different regions—different parts of the world. 934. Have you anything to say on the Persian side ?—That is a question again of policy, if you want to develop the neutral sphere. 935. Yes, that is the point I want ?—Then there is only this main consideration which it seems to me you have to bear in mind. Apparently, there has been an idea that when you get your goods up to the Russian sphere the Russians will allow those goods to pass freely into their sphere along their roads and along their railway. I- think that is an erroneous idea. I do not think that that will be what will take place. [ 376 ] Z84 Sixth Meeting, 25th March, 1908. I made a little Memorandum on that subject, but in order to resume it I should like to say this, that in the case of railways certainly the Russians will introduce their zone system if they should build one, their zone system being that thay charge considerably less rates proportionately for longer distances than they do for short distances. That will be a move which 1 do not see how England could meet with her commercial policy, even il you controlled the Baghdad Railway, which you would after all only control in a private capacity and not as a State enterprise. But supposing Russia does not build her railways (and 1 always think that railways are very remote), if we are content to regard those as remote, then let us fake into consideration what would be the effect on British trade if the road system were to fall into Russian hands. A\ hat are the facts at present? We have a road, as you know, which Sir Charles Ilardinge and myself were mainly responsible for, and which we made in connection with the Bakhtiari Chiefs, and of which the Bakhtiari Chiefs take all the revenues. We send up our goods along it to Isfahan, and we have got a carriage road from Kum to Tehran in the Russian sphere, and the carriages go practically all the way to Isfahan. The Isfahan-Kum section will have to be improved. I want you to put to yourself this situation. Supposing we sell that road to the Russians as being in their sphere, then it does not mean merely selling a road, but a road with the right of transport; and therefore naturally the Russians will put their transport on to that road. Our goods come up on our Bakhtiari road through the neutral sphere to Isfahan ; and they have to be handed over, not as at present to our own people at Isfahan, but to a Russian transport Company. I think you can readily see that in that suppositious case every kind of obstruction and difficulty would be put in their way. I he Russians would say there were not sufficient carriages to carrv them forward. 936. That is if you sell the concession ?—Yes. 937. I he concession is preserved at present ?—It is preserved. I merely use that to answer your question. I should like to say what we ought to do is to develop our existing concessions in Persia, and to build a road, which I should think was certainly necessaiy, fiom Bunder Abbas to Kerman. That I think certainly should be built, because there is no proper communication between Bunder Abbas and Kerman* and even if there is a good trace to be found from Bushire to Shiraz —1 have not travelled that way myself, I have always been told that it is a veiy precipitous section of country if it can be built I should recommend that what we can do to develop the neutral zone should be done, and that we should press up to the border line of the Russian sphere, and do it as soon as possible, before the Russians can get in with their concessions. 9*j8. Doing it with roads, not railways?—Roads, not railwavs. I suppose we should guard ouiselves. I here is a pledge on the part of the Shah Nasir-ud-din vffiich the British Government, I believe, hold to be binding, that when railways are given to Russia in the north, England shall enjoy similar rights of railway construction in the south. ° ‘ i ARD j N GE : lou talked about selling your road concession from e iran to Isfahan, but I do not think you can. I think there is an agreement that vou ia\ e with us that you cannot sell that road. You cannot part with that concession at all to anybody ?—I have no desire to sell it. pardon° 1 ^ t0 POint ° Ut 1 think that is S0, ~ I do not think 80 ; 1 be S y° ur . , h 41, In . consideration of the assistance which we gave you?—We cannot sell Without paymg you a certain sum of money. I think that is the case. 941. You have a concession, have you not, for a road from Ahwaz to Khoramabad and through Lunstan ?—Yes. 943. Linking up with Sultanabad ?—Yes. ^ ^ you thmk you will be able to make that road?—Yes. I received letters ot er day that I was reading last Sunday, to the effect that two or three caravans Pp &lt; ,.v eC tT t ! y ^ 0 me u t V 0Ugh ' i 11 s yP rised me vei T mu ch in the present condition of sia that they had come through from Khoramabad. But of course great measures enter ^isT 11011 W ° U d 36 necessar y it would be possible to go on with that 945. Do you know that road at all ?—I only know it as far as Dizful. —None 068 breserd an y £ lea 4 difficulties as far as Dizful for railway construction ? hoo 947 ‘ Y ? U d ? n0t kno 7 an y th mg further beyond that ?—Except I know from ling continual reports, from reading, and hearing from travellers coming through.mmammmmm ammmtmmammmmmmammmmaaam Evidence of Mr. H. F. B. Lynch, M.P. 85 I understand there is absolutely no difficulty either in the way of road construction or railway construction in that region. The only difficulty arises from the Lur tribes. I think you may take it that there are only two really suitable avenues of ingress into Persia. One is by the Khoramabad route and the other is by the Khanikin route. Those are the two easy passages into Persia, and the only two. 948. Then if that were so, if there was a direct road from Ahwaz to Khoramabad and going up to Tehran, that might very well take away the whole of the road traffic by Baghdad and Khanikin, might it not ?—No, I do not think it would. It would take away a portion. 949. It is much shorter ?—And it does not go through a Turkish custom-house. It has that advantage. 950. And it does not have to go up the Tigris ?—It does not have to go up the Tigris. No doubt it would have a great effect in that direction, but I do not think it would oust the Baghdad route. That is my opinion. To give you the reasons of that, a great number of these people, you must remember, have their head-quarters in Baghdad. A number of these goods go to Baghdad and are divided up there. 951. But would it not be possible that Mohammerah would take the place of Baghdad in those circumstances ?—They would go up the river to Ahwaz in those circumstances, and Ahwaz would take the place of Baghdad in that respect, but it would take so many years, and Baghdad has a population of 100,000 people. 952. Supposing eventually there was a railway constructed in Persia, that it was possible to construct a railway from, we will say, Mohammerah through Ahwaz to Khoramabad, linking up Tehran and the Russian railways at Julfa, would not such a railway be a very serious competitor to the Baghdad Railway ?—A competitor from the point of view of what ? 953. Passengers ?—Passengers to and from India ? 954. Such passengers as would otherwise come down by the Baghdad Railway ?— And presumably would be going to India or the Far East? 955. Yes.—Yes, I should think so. Of course you would avoid all the torrid zone. It is a frightfully hot journey, almost a prohibitive journey, from Basra to Killis, especial^ if you go right to Mosul, and then across the desert to Killis. 956. That part of the railway would be merely from Dizful ?—Quite so. 957. And I imagine it would also be the quickest route ?—I think certainly it would be the quickest route. 958. Captain Slade : I should like to ask some questions about what you said as to improving the waterways. What sized steamers are they that you run up the river ?—About 210 feet long by, I think, 40 feet broad. 959. What draught ?—A draught varying between 2 ft. 6 in. light and 4 ft. 6 in. fully loaded. 960. What increase of size had you in your mind when you said you thought you could run larger steamers ? —Very much larger. 961. What wunild that entail in the way of improving the river? Would it entail very large engineering works ?—It is difficult to say, for this reason. These are the difficulties you have to encounter. They are of two kinds. First of all there are very abrupt bends in the river bank at certain places. There is a place called the “ Devil’s Elbow.” That is the main obstacle. No vessel longer than 210 feet—that is the maximum—can get round the “ Devil’s Elbow.” That is one of the difficulties you have to contend with, and the other is that the river being so extremely shallow for seven months in the year—a river flowing through an alluvial bed in many channels— your steamer cannot draw more than from 2 ft. 6 in. to 3 feet during seven months of the year, and during that time she can carry practically no cargo, and the only way in which you can carry any cargo is by putting practically no cargo in your steamer, but putting the cargo in your barge, which is tow T ed alongside. 962. Then it would necessitate considerable engineering work ?—It would. On that point I am really not competent to speak, because I have had no experience on the Indian rivers, which have been a good deal trained. The Indus has been a good deal trained, and I do not know what the cost has been. 963. Supposing you could put on a very much improved class of steamer, then, taking the line up the Tigris, the railway coming down the Euphrates would tend to improve your trade, would it not ? The railway follows the course of the Euphrates more than the Tigris, does it not ?—No, the railway at present is not going to follow the course of the Euphrates at all, is it ? 964. From Baghdad down, the last section on this small map ?—Yes.86 Sixth Meeting, 25th March, 1908. 965. An improvement of the Tigris with the railroad would help your trade very considerably ?—Any improvement in the course of the Tigris would help the river service very much, and of course the river service, as I said before, does not get a kilometric guarantee. You know there is a scheme now for restoring the dam at Hindiyeh on the Euphrates, but I fancy it is going to be inquired into this spring. There have been negotiations going on as to who is going to do this dam. 966. Mr. Morley : Who will inquire ?— I think our Consul-General has an idea of going up there. Possibly Sir Charles Hardinge would tell you more about that than I can tell. 967. Captain Slade : Do you find great difficulties with the Turkish authorities in your trade on the river ?—There are obstructions constantly put in the way of defective custom-house accommodation, absurd quarantine regulations, everything wrong-headed of that kind, but nothing in the way of deliberate obstruction. We work very well together. 968. Sir W. Nicholson : You were speaking of the irrigation of the delta of the Tigris and Euphrates, and suggested that that should precede and not follow the railway ?—Yes. 969. If they had irrigation at all, they would have to make dams or bunds at various parts of the river?—Yes. 970. These divert the water into the country, and consequently absorb a great deal of the water in the river ?—Yes. 971. Consequently your navigation, it seems to me, from Basra to Baghdad will come to an end. At any rate, it is very difficult to keep water in the river in those circumstances. 1 speak of navigation in the Ganges and the Jumna, where it is extraordinary difficult, because canals take almost all the water. You say that during the hot weather this river has got very little water in it. Obviously if you irrigate there will be less water in it ?—As I understand, what you would do is what, for instance, is proposed to be done in the case of the Karun. A Dutch engineer of experience has been there. I have seen his plans. They provide that, in addition to irrigation, the channels of the Karun shall be improved rather than impaired. How is it done ? by much the same methods as the ancients employed in the case of Lake Moeris in Egypt. 972. If you do what has been done at Assouan you can do that?—It is the country for basin irrigation, as I think it is called. You have pockets of land even lower than the waterway of the river, and pockets higher. You have little hillocks and little ranges which render this sort of thing possible, at least so I understand. 973. Sir W. Nicholson : Are you aware that in a similar river in India, namely, the Indus, which is a large river, before they built the Indus VaUey Railway, the Punjaub Government maintained a large fleet of river steamers to go from Mooltan to Karachi, and since the railway has come the whole of the river traffic has been destroyed and everything is carried by railway?—You have to make your choice. ^lou can elect. You may say : It is not worth my while to go in for the expense of supplying water to the river during the summer ; it is better for me to carry on the trade by means of a railway. But I do not think you would come to that conclusion in the case of Mesopotamia, because you have got these two magnificent waterways which run from one end of it to the other, and to neglect that as a means of water carriage is, I should think, unwise. 974. Mu. Wilson Fox : Supposing the Baghdad Railway came down to the Gulf, your position on the Tigris depends on whether you can compete with the Germans against their railway rates?—You mean that if the German goods rates of freight were so low that, therefore, our steamers would go empty ? 975. Yes?—That is so. 976. Supposing the Germans got a concession for the six Turkish steamers on the Tigris which are at present running, what would be your position then, with the Germans holding more than half of the river traffic and all the railway traffic between Baghdad and the Gulf ?—You mean holding the river and the railway ? 977. Yes ?—I think our position would be a very uncomfortable one. In fact, I should think it would necessitate the steamers retiring. 978. That would drive you out ?—I should think so. 979. You have a steamer on the lower portion of the Karun River ?—Yes. 980. And a Persian has got a steamer there also ?—Yes. 981. When you have opened out this road to which Sir Charles Hardinge alluded upEvidence of Mr. H. F. B. Lynch, MP. to Sultanabad, I suppose that traffic on the Karun River would become more valuable— when you have got your road from Sultanabad to Mohammerah ?—No, from Sultanabad to Ahwaz. 982. Yes. When you have got your road from Sultanabad to Ahwaz will your river traffic then be more valuable than it is now?—Certainly. The river traffic at present on the Karun does not pay. , . 983. And when that road is completed it is likely to ?—If the road is anything like the success that the Bakhtiari road has proved it certainly will. 984. And it is in respect of that, 1 suppose, that it would be to your advantage to acquire that other Persian steamer ?—Do you mean in the ordinary course of business, where two persons compete and one tries to buy the other out ? 985. Would it be more beneficial to you to have the whole of the traffic on the Karun River, or to share it with the Persian, as you do now ?—Of course if we have the whole of the traffic, with no competitor, obviously it would be better for us. 986. And then there is a danger, I suppose, of some other country getting the Persian’s concession ?—Of working with him ? 987. Yes.—Certainly. 988. With regard to this road from Ahwaz to Isfahan, I understand that you either made or repaired that road ?—We made it. 989. But you have not got a concession for that, have you ?—Certainly. # 990. How long have you got a concession for that?—For twenty-five years. It is a matter of debate between us and the Foreign Office, but I think it is twenty-live years. . 991. But for the other road up north you have got a concession for a longer period ?—Yes ; but the concession for the other is with powers to enlarge into a carriage road. You see it is not our road. It belongs to the Chiefs. 992. And you made it for them?—For them, only they have to pay us back m so many years, and therefore it is only theirs to that extent. _ # . 993. Therefore in that corner of Persia the roads are practically in British hands for a considerable number of years ?—Yes ; practically as long as we like. 994. Mr. Morley : You said just now that the Turk has got six steamers on the river as against your three?—Yes, and he is sending two more, that will make eight. 995. Eight Turks against your three ?—Yes. 996. And is the tonnage equal, or what ?— There will be four equal and some slightly less. (The Witness withdrew.) Evidence of Major J. A. Douglas. 997. Sir E. Grey : You know all this part of Persia, I think? T have been up as far as Dizful from the south, and I have been down to about thiity miles south of Khoramabad from the north. I have not been to the part in between. . . 998. Is it a good route for a railway, or a practicable route ? I believe it is. the actual route by which I went was not, but there is a way round which I belie\e, fiom all I heard, is a comparatively easy route as far as Khoramabad. . 999. Then supposing there is going to be railway access to the Persian (.rult, w hat do you think is the route that had better be chosen for it ? I believe that is the easiest route. 1000. Mr. Morley : Which is the route ?—From Ahwaz-Dizful up to Khoramabad. 1001. Sir E. Grey : Do you know the country north of that ?—les, I have been in a good deal of the country to the north. There is Dizful; then it w ould go round here, follow the river more or less, and then it will run east to Khoramabad. 1002. Going north of that, how would the railway run supposing theie was a route coming down from Julfa ? Supposing, for instance, the Russians wanted access to the Persian Gulf, and we said we were prepared to make a railway from the head of the Persian Gulf to Khoramabad that way, how would they come down to join it — I presume they would come by Hamadan and Burujird. They have made a load theie from Kazvin to Hamadan, a new' road. 1003. What about the country from Mohammerah to Shiraz ?_ Supposing the Baghdad Railway is made, and there was a question of continuing it so as to make a through railway route to India, is it practicable from Mohammerah to Shnaz : 1 [376] 1 A88 Sixth Meeting, 25th March, 1908. think it is very difficult. It is fairly easy for a certain way, but then these hills to the west of Shiraz, I believe, are very difficult. I have never been in them myself. I have been in Shiraz, but I have not been in that country. 1004. Sir C. Hardinge : If this railway from Dizful, instead of going up from Mohammerah, went up the valley of the Karkah River up to Kermanshah, would it not be much easier for the Russians to link up from Kermanshah to Hamadan than from Hamadan to Khoramabad ?—I suppose it would. 1005 Was Colonel Elliot in Persia at all when you were there ?—I never heard of his being there when I was there. 1006. Because I have a map drawn by him here, and that is the line that he has drawn out. Up the Karkah to Kermanshah, and then join on to Ilamadan, and from Hamadan to Tehran; but you say it is easier to construct the railway from Hamadan to Kazvin ?—It is not easy to construct a railway from Hamadan to Kazvin. Kazvin is about 4.000 feet, and the road goes over a pass of about 7,000, and it is a very steep rise for about 4,000 feet on the northern side of that pass. 1007. You know the road on the north of Hamadan to Tehran?—Yes. 1008. Is it easy to construct a railway ?—By the direct line ? I have not been over it, but it looks as if there would be no great difficulty. 1009. That looks as if it would be the easiest route : up the Karkah to Kermanshah, then to Hamadan, and from Hamadan to Tehran ?—It is fairly easy as long as it follows the valley of the Karkah River, where the river is fairly big, but I think there would be some difficulty in getting through the hills at Kermanshah. 1010. But I thought engineers as a rule liked a narrow valley?—Yes, they do not mind a narrow valley. It is expensive, but I believe engineers rather like narrow, rocky valleys. 1011. Do you know the road from Tehran to Shiraz ?—Yes. 1012. From Tehran to Isfahan is quite feasible, is it not ?—Quite feasible. 1013. And from Isfahan down to Dehbid is quite feasible, is it not ? There are no great difficulties ?—There are no great difficulties. 1014. And how is it between Dehbid and Shiraz ?—There are no great difficulties there It would cost rather more than the northern part of the railway. Of course there is a difficulty in the elevations. Here it is about 8,000 feet high, but it is level. 1015. There is no great difficulty in constructing a railway from Shiraz to Tehran ? — I do not think so. 1016. It has always been assumed that when the Baghdad Railway reaches Khanikin a railway to Tehran would follow as a matter of course ?—Yes. 1017. So on that point of construction in the neighbourhood of Kermanshah or Khoramabad you have got to tap an easy line from somewhere between Khanikin and Kermanshah to Tehran?—Yes. 1018. It makes Kermanshah really the objective from the south ?—Yes, it does, that line running up that way. I believe it would be possible to build a line further to the east by Khoramabad and Burujird. But of course it is not an easy line from Khanikin to Kermanshah. There is a very high pass there to be got over. 1019. Sir W. Nicholson : It is a very considerable elevation to go up from Isfahan and Shiraz, which are about 5,200 or 5,300, to the pass which is 8,000, so that you have to go up and then down again. That would add very much to the expense of the line and the expense of moving traffic along it ?—Between Shiraz and Isfahan ? 1020. Yes.—It would add to the expense of the line. 1021. It would also add to the expense of haulage. To haul a thing up 3,000 feet and then let it down the other side is not economical, is it ?—No. 1022. Have you been to this pass ?—Yes. It is not a pass. It is not at all a rapid ascent; you go up quite gradually to it. 1023. And then down again ?—And then down again quite gradually. It is not really a pass ; it is only high ground. But I think I am right in saying it is 8,000 feet. [Adjourned.]Seventh Meeting, Monday, 30th March, 1908. PRESENT: The Right Hon. J. Morley, O.M., M.P., Secretary of State for India (in the Chair).

Wilson Fox, C.B., of the Board of Trade, was also present.) 1024. Mr. Morley : As you know, we are here inquiring into the conditions and so forth of British interests in the Gulf. You were at Bombay for a little time, were you not?—Yes. I was for a long while Secretary to the Government of Bombay ; and I was Private Secretary before the conduct of affairs was handed over to the Govern ment of India, so I remember the earlier time. 1025. All the affairs of the Gulf in those days were in the hands of the Govern ment of Bombay, and not in the hands of the Government of India, I think ?—Until the seventies they were practically under the Government of Bombay, because the Gulf was so far removed from Calcutta that the Government of India rarely interfered, and the despatches meant for the Home Government in those early days used to come under flying seal to the Government of Bombay and so home to the Foreign Office. 1026. But the affairs of the Gulf and British interests in the Gulf were regarded then as a very material interest of India, were they not ?—They were, and they were also very material to Bombay in particular. 1027. And to India ?—Yes. 1028. Will you tell us about Muscat? Muscat, of course, is not actually in the Gulf, but what is your view about our interests there ?—I look on Muscat as the key of the whole position. Our relations with the Sultan have guided our whole policy in the Gulf. Those relations have been vitally altered of late by our Agreements with France, and the position cannot be understood without reference ( 1 st) to what it was before 1862, when we regarded Muscat as under our exclusive influence and tutelage; ( 2 ndj after 1862, when we tried to secure a predominant influence in the joint Protectorate ; (3rd) in the present century, when we have forged fresh fetters partly in the Bunder Gisseh case and partly in the late submission of the flag question to The Hague Arbitration Court. It will be remembered that the Muscat Imami were once the strongest power in the Gulf, and in 1784 owned Zanzibar, Ormuz, and Kishm, besides other positions on the coasts. We entered into Treaties with them in 1798 against the French. The Seyyids, as the rulers of Muscat were henceforth called, continued to increase in power90 Seventh Meeting, 30th March, 1908. until perpetual disputes about the succession broke up their rule. In these disputes we established our influence as friends and arbitrators, and I pass on rapidly to &lt; t&gt;o, when Seyvid Saeed, who had lost Bunder Abbas and Kishm, died at the Seychelles on his way to Zanzibar. Instantly, one son who was at Zanzibar, Seyyid Majid, became de facto Ruler of Zanzibar, while Thoweyni took his seat at Muscat. Then the brothers began to quarrel with this division, and they agreed that the holder of Zanzibar should pay 40,000 dollars a year as compensation to the Ruler at Muscat. After Ihoweym s death it was not paid, and then the Governor-General oi India, Lord Canning, he d an inquiry and arbitrated, settling what was to be paid by the Ruler of Zanzibar lor sharing in the partition of the dominions of the Oman. W hen this was done, it was held that it might be .necessary to agree with France, which had an interest in Muscat and Treaties with Muscat, as to recognizing this partition A second and more potent factor influenced the action of the Government 1 hat was that at Zanzibar itself-and I may say that Zanzibar was then under Bombay- the French established a warehouse, which was a^ place that could accommodate troops. We at once said, “What is this? This is an'independent place, and France said “Very well; perhaps v r e 'might come to an agreement to recognize the independence of Zanzibar.” Accordingly the Agreement of 1862 was made by which France and England jointly guaranteed the independence of Muscat and ol Zanzibar. At the time we never quite understood why Muscat was dragged into it. We could have allowed Zanzibar’s independence to be guaranteed, but we did not like the other part of the joint guarantee, for this reason—because we had been working for years and years so as to increase the authority and possessions of Muscat, m order that the very superior influence which we had over Muscat might operate on these poitions of territory given to it. For a little while this Agreement, bringing m France as guaranteeing the independence, constituted a difficulty which perplexed us in 1 m la, where we had to deal with it by the light of our own intelligence, because the Home Government did not much interfere in those days. So we proceeded at once to try and establish, notwithstanding this Agreement with France, our predominant influence at Muscat. I need not say in detail what we did ; we paid money, and we settled disputes Now I come to the third and present period. We went on establishing our predominance, and suddenly, a few years ago, France occupied a place for a coaling station. We were frightened, and we proceeded to ask France what she meant. The result was we had to fight France, taking our stand on the Agreement of 1862, and urging that their acquisition infringed the joint guarantee of independence. Thereby we shook the whole fabric of the special influence over Muscat which we had been slowly building up by giving money, and by recognizing successions and all sorts of things for about thirty years. There was just one chance left. 1 he \ital pro- montorv known as Cape Musandim, with its two inlets, Elphmstone and Malcolm, might still be' saved if it belonged to the pirate coast and not to Muscat. M e had long regarded the promontory as outside the limits of Muscat. krom khoi Kalb a to 1 ib &gt;a the coast forms part of the Shargah territory. From Dibba to Rams, south of lib &gt;a, it was known that the Shihuh tribe were in possession, and a strong case might be made out for regarding this important cape as the pirate coast over which we exercise an exclusive Protectorate, and therefore outside the joint Protectorate of 1862. But when we came to the question lately before The Hague, the French asked for a map, or I think themselves gave a map, in which they put down the limits of Muscat and the boundaries. We had carefully avoided a map ; we did not m the least want a map. 1029. Had you not better tell us, if I may interrupt you for a moment, exactly how all this bears upon our reference to-day ? I apprehend that the measures &gt; 011 could take to protect and maintain our influence at the entrance of the iiilt vitally depend on whether we have a free hand, and can, as has been proposed by some, put up telegraph stations and get a lease of, or keep our hand on, the important posts m that promontory without thinking of the French claims to a Protectorate with us 1030. But you regard Muscat, though not actually in the Gulf, as essentially an element in Gulf politics ?—Yes. A most vital spot inside the Gulf is the Cape Musandim. . „ 1031. Do you feel that we ought to exert ourselves to retain a sort of supremacy in Muscat apart from that ?—May I come to the end of what I was saying—that lately we have told France, and committed ourselves to it, that^ Cape Musandim Bom lias Dibba to Tibba is part of Muscat. We were always hoping to prove that it was not part of Muscat, because then we would have been free to have hail direct relations with the local Chiefs for establishing positions there. I do not think it is realized how w^e compromised ourselves by this map that we gave in. It has been proposeo thatEvidence of Sir W. Lee-Warner. 91 we occupy tins ('pointing to the map). We lately had a flag up there, hut we took the flag down. Why ? Not because it was a territory which we had said that France would protect as well as ourselves, but because the naval authorities said, If the flag is there you will have to defend it. I do not think that at the time the flag was put up anybody contemplated that the promontory was an essential part of Muscat covered by the Agreement of 1862. My point is that it is an excessively vital matter that France and England have jointly guaranteed the integrity of that part of Muscat, and that we can no longer go away and say it is pirate coast and not Muscat. 1032. All this being granted to you, how do you propose to deal with Muscat ? Remember, what we are about is to see whether we can, or how we can, baffle the designs of any other commercial Power to get into the Gulf and depose us. What operations in Muscat have you in your mind?—I think we have tied ourselves' up by these two recent actions—the action taken when France occupied Bunder Gisseh and this recent Hague Conference business. We have so tied ourselves up in regard to this part of Muscat, which is all-important to the Persian Gulf, that I think we shall be forced to regard it as part of the country over which France has the same rights as ourselves, i.e., a joint Protectorate. That is merely my point for what it is worth. Only four years ago proposals were made to us and considered by the Foreign Office and by the India Office, all of which were based on the supposition that we could do what we liked at Musandim. The old theory was that we might treat it as if it were a part of the pirate coast, where we could do as we pleased. Now we are forced to act as if France was in the same position as ourselves ; and if that is the case, I do not think that the Government of India have realized the change that has occurred. That is why I went back to show how, in the old days, we worked to enlarge the influence of Muscat, thinking we could command it. Then came the blow of 1862— the joint Agreement with France. Then we in India edged away from it, and built up our special influence without France ; but suddenly we are brought back at the end of the century to the position which France obtained in 1862. I do not think we can do anything on the promontory at the entrance to the Gulf, save in regard to the telegraph. We can put a telegraph post up, because in 1864 we made a special Treaty to that effect; but anything else, like the planting of a flag, or, as we hoped a few years ago, getting a concession from the local tribe there, such a concession as has been got at Koweit—we are barred from doing. 1033. Talking of Koweit, you have told us about Muscat; will you now tell us what views you have about Bahrein ?—We hold a strong position in Bahrein. 1034. Strong in what direction?—We have an absolute right, free from all entanglements, to maintain our Protectorate and declare it; and I would not hesitate to do everything to make it perfectly clear that Bahrein is under British protection, and only British protection. 1035. Why do you attach this signal importance to Bahrein ?—Its position is important. I must not talk about it strategically, for I know nothing of that; but the main political danger you have got to avoid is international complications inside the Gulf, and those might arise out of the pearl fisheries, of which Bahrein is the centre. Again, it faces the Arab coast of El Katr, between Odeid and Katif, which is not under the effective rule of Turkey, although there is a Turkish garrison at El Bidaa. We ought to consolidate our Protectorate over Bahrein, and make public arrangements for the exercise of our jurisdiction there over British and foreign subjects. We must exercise an exclusive control over Bahrein. 1036. Do you think that is the standing view of the Government of India ?—Yes, I think so. 1037. 1 only want to ask you one more question, aud that is on quite a different point. There are several Agents of the Indian Government in the Gulf; can you tell me exactly what view the Government of India has taken of the different amounts paid to the Political Agent of the Indian Government, and the ordinary Foreign Oflice Consular officer ?—Are you referring to the differential payment—the higher rate of salaries ? 1038. Yes. I only ask that question because there may be a discussion a little later as to the division of the charge for the guardianship of British interests in the Gulf, and I want to know what your view, or the view of the Government of India, is of the different salaries paid to the Indian officer, say at Bushire, and the Foreign Office Consular Agent ?—I think that the Indian Government compare the salary of their officer at Bushire, or anywhere else, with the salary of officers in the same Department as himself, serving them in other parts of India. [376J 2 B92 Seventh Meeting, 30th March, 1908. 1039. In other parts of India, you. say ?—Yes. The Foreign Department is a special service in which there is a scale of pay for military officers in political employ. The whole rate of payment of these officers serving the Government of India in political employ is higher than that of officers of a similar military rank serving in England and under different conditions. 1010. Do you know, as a matter of fact and figure, what is the difference ; is it 00 per cent, more ?—You must tell me whom to compare with. For instance, mention was made of Bushire ; I do not ever remember an officer of the Foreign Office being at Bushire whose salary 1 could compare with that of the Resident sent from the Indian Foreign Department. If I should compare the Bushire Resident’s pay with that of an Ambassador anywhere, of course the Ambassador is paid very much more. 1041. I am not on that point at all—far from it.—I must compare like with like. 1 want to know what officer I am to compare him with. 1042. Sir Charles Hardinge : There is a Consul at Basra ?—Basra is an important place in its way, but we always regarded Bushire as a far more important charge. 1043. Lord Esher, : Is there a Representative of the Indian Government and also a Representative of the Foreign Office at Bushire?—No. The Indian Government Officer is also Consul-General. He is a Political Agent under the Indian Government, which, in the old days, meant a great deal more than a mere Consular Agent. The Foreign Office recognizes him as a Consul-General, and he has certain duties in that capacity to perform. 1044. Is there any place in the Persian Gulf where there are two officers—one representing India and one representing the Foreign Office ?—I think not, but there are, of course, Consuls in some parts of Persia who are paid direct by the Foreign Office. 1045. Mr. Morley : At Isfahan we have one, and he is paid a certain rate, and the man at Tabriz and Tehran is paid another rate ? Yes ; but at present confusion reigns, and we have got this joint arrangement by which India and the Home Government contribute moieties to certain charges. 1046. Lord Esher : I did not quite understand why it was considered necessary to have two officers—one representing the Foreign Office and the other the Government of India ?—There are not two in the same place. But here an Indian officer and there a Foreign Office official. 1047. Then, if there are not two, how is it determined whether an officer repre senting the Empire, if you like, in the Persian Gulf, should be Indian or English ?— Largely by past custom ; ordinary places like Meshed and Bushire, with Bunder Abbas and Ahwaz, are still occupied by Indian politicals, while Tehran, Isfahan, Tabriz, Mohammerah, &amp;c.. are filled by British Consular officers. 1048. It is accidental then?—It has been a matter of arrangement with the Foreign Office who should go, and where. 1049. But it is not based on any principle as to whether a Representative should be Indian or a Representative of the Foreign Office?—Till lately, India paid for those it sent itself; but by the joint arrangement the two Offices have to agree. The system does not work well, and personally I never thought that it would. 1050. 8ir E. Grey : \\ hat do you think we ought to have done at the mouth of the Gulf if our hands had been free ?—I should like even now, our hands being what they are, to make use of our Agreement with Muscat for a telegraph station. I would like to be in e\idence there, and to have a station on Sheeps Island, or somewhere near Musandim, which would be a valuable outlook in the event of trouble hereafter, and would cost very little. That we can do under an Agreement we have, specially providing for telegraphs. If we had been in other respects free, I should like to have got from the local Sheikhs a right—a foreshore right or other right of occupa tion—which would have given us the power of going to Elphinstone Inlet or Khor Law i, or to w hatever the naval authorities hold to be the best port barring the road to any other power. The country is barren, but the harbours on either^ side are magnificent, and I would have secured them for ourselves, whether for offensive or defensive purposes at the entrance to the Gulf.Evidence of Sir W. Lee-Warner. 93 1051. The climate is very bad ?—The climate of those two places, I believe, is very bad —it is very hot. But still, at a pinch, the positions might be useful. 1052. How do they compare with the places on the opposite side, Henjam and Bassidu ?—There again 1 should most certainly strengthen our position. To begin with, on the opposite side we have got none of the embarrassment of Agreements with France or any other Power. We had from Muscat in the old days a station at Bassidu, and that station on Kishm 1 hope we shall maintain and strengthen. At Henjam we have got some rights, I think. 1053. Sir C. Hardinge : We have got a telegraph station? — Just so. We have got a telegraph station the exact limits of which, whether two square miles or what nobody quite knows ; but, at any rate, we have got the best part of the ground, where the water supply is. I would stick to that water supply and let nobody else get in there ; in fact, 1 would try and extend my acquisitions in Henjam, and above all j protect the Arabs settled there and not allow the Persians to come in and tax them. \ I would maintain the status quo. We are at Henjam and Kishm, and it is I important to exclude others from interference. Let us hold our independent position, avoiding international fetters, whether under plea of sanitation or arms traffic, or other alleged common interests. We may profit by our mistakes in Muscat. 1054. Sir E. Geey : Have you got any views about railway concessions in the southern part of Persia ?—No. I think it is very important for us to keep such a direct hold of Mohammerah as we have got. We have told the Sheikh that as long as he behaves properly he can rely on our good offices. I should be glad to extend those offices, and I think that within his area it may hereafter be necessary to think of a possible railway running to the river side. But as to the alignment of a Southern Persian railway, 1 have no views worth giving. 1055. You attach great importance to the Persian Gulf ?—1 attach immense import ance from the Indian point of view to the Persian Gulf. \\ hen I think of Karachi, so close by, I should view with great alarm any foreign ships of war coming and going about those waters. We have hardly defended Karachi, and it is a most important port. 1056. It is from the strategical point of view you have been speaking then, really ? —Yes. I also attach immense importance to the trade, because India, losing as it thinks it is losing, its trade with some of our Colonies, or its opening for its traders there, and not feeling quite comfortable about the attitude of Natal and other Colonies, expects her rulers not to impair her ancient trade with Persia and Arabia. I look on it as a most sacred trust; I look on ourselves as trustees for maintaining for India, quite apart from England, the export and import trade with the Persian Gulf. 1057. Mr. Morley : I wish you could give us, though perhaps you have not the material with you, further and better particulars, if I may say so, as to the exact nature of the Indian trade and the amount of it ? —The amount I should have to get up. 1058. It is not fair to ask you that now ?—There are pearls and horses, and at least three-fourths of the foreign trade of Muscat is with India. 1059. In what sense is the pearl trade an Indian trade ?—Merchants in Bombay finance it, and manage it. _ ^ i i 1060. Who buy the pearls ?—Their agents in the Gulf. The Bombay people are much interested in the trade. r 1061. By the people at Bombay do you mean European dealers there ? No. 1062. Do you mean Indian traders, then ?—Yes. I shoidd think most of the Delhi pearls came from the Persian Gulf, and I should think that the valuable peails possessed by hundreds of native Chiefs came for the most part from the Gulf. A sentimental value attaches to the Gulf trade, which has inspired the poeti} and prose of India. 1063. Mr. Wilson Fox : 454,613Z. worth of precious stones and pearls go from the Gulf to India. 1064. Sir E. Grey : India sends cotton goods to the Gulf, I presume ? les, and, of course, it would send more if times improved. 1065 If necessary the trade could be developed, and you would expect India to send a much larger amount ?—Yes. It would be the natural and proper country for it to trade with. The Bombay mills even supply the Japanese markets. 1066. The British India Company, I think, takes the trade between India and the Persian Gulf?—Yes, and it is an important link in the trade. But native boats carry their share.94 Seventh Meeting, 30th March, 1908. 1067. The Hamburg-Amerika Line has lately been sending steamers there, has it not ?—Yes, I am sorry to say it has begun to claim its share. 1068. Do you look upon that with apprehension ?—Yes, I do not at all want it, nor anything else that would injure the native Indian trade and the lucrativeness of it. One would be afraid that the German trade would be subsidized, and that it would not be a fair competition. 1069. Sir C. Hardinge : What would be the effect, in your opinion, of the predominance in trade of a foreign flag in the Gulf ?—Politically I should think it would be excessively weakening to us. You must remember that some of the most rowdy elements we have in Indian society, and the people who make the riots, are the Arabs who come down from the Gulf to Bombay in the course of this trade. At present they have a wholesome regard for us as the great world Power. If they got accustomed to the sight of foreign competitors, they would carry their tales to Bombay and find a credulous population who would exaggerate our decadence. The pirates and other lawless tribes in the Gulf would play off one Government against another. The Afghans and Pathan tribesmen would supply themselves with arms. We should lose not only influence, but checks which help us to keep the peace of India. Apart from this political weakening, there would be a cry that we were losing for the Indians their commercial advantages in seas peculiarly their own. 1070. Then you think it is a very serious Indian interest that the trade should not get under a foreign flag ?—I do. 1071. Do you think it is even more an Indian than an Imperial interest ?—I always speak primarily from an Indian point of view, for others are better able to judge from the point of view here. I fancy the trade to Europe is at present small; what it may be when you have the Tigris and the Mesopotamian traffic in the future I do not know. At present it is an extremely important trade for India ; it is a trade in which money is made by leading influential natives, and it is a sacred trade beyond that. For there are the pilgrimages to Kerbela and other shrines. India’s heart goes out to Persia ; they are linked together, and it would have a very bad effect all round upon us to have any but our own flag predominant there. 1072. Do you think if there was any risk of that, and it could be obviated by a subsidy, that a subsidy should be given ?—That opens a question of political economy. I do not like subsidies myself. I think every effort should be made to save the trade by other means. 1073. Mr. Morley : Do you think you would lay a burden upon the general taxpayers of India in order to benefit the pearl dealers of Bombay ?—No, and therefore I did not advocate giving a subsidy. 1074. But Sir Charles asked you the question?—I said it introduced other considerations which make me pause in my answer. I hope that the trade may be saved by other means. 1075. Sir C. Hardinge : About Cape Musandim, do you not think that the fact that we and France guarantee the integrity of Muscat is a sufficient safeguard that no one else will go there, because after all it is an uninhabitable spot even for a telegraph station, and I understand you could not keep telegraph clerks there during the hot weather ?—It is very hot, I know ; I am not sure about Khor Kawi. Our Agreement with France is certainly sufficient at the present moment, but times change. You must bear in mind what started us there—it was the fear of France. Our first Treaties with Muscat were in 1798, and they were engagements by which we arranged, I think, to exclude France. Things go up and down. I would quietly prepare for the possibilities of the future. 1076. But at the moment you do not think it is necessary to do any more ?—For the moment, no; I only want the facts borne in mind, because I do think it has not been remembered that we have admitted Musamdim to be Muscati. I have lately heard it argued that Musamdim is not part of Muscat, but we have estopped ourselves using that argument. 1077. Mr. Wilson Fox: The British India Company carries the pearls and precious stones from the Gulf to India, does it not ?■—I think a quantity of pearls come down otherwise, in dhows and other native craft. 1078. But there is no reason why the Germans should control that trade from the Gulf, is there?—I thought the question was as to the effect of seeing German vesselsEvidence of Sir W. Lee-Warner. 95 going about to all these ports, and the British Indian vessels disappearing. That was what I thought was very dangerous. 1079. As regards the actual trade, and I cannot see any reason why the Germans should control a particular trade in the Gulf if there is business in it. It is open to Indian merchants or to British merchants to develop that trade, and I cannot under stand why the Germans are getting hold of it?—Do you mean to say you cannot understand by what means they are making it profitable ? 1080. Why is it they are controlling this trade, which is open equally to us to control, and which is open equally to the Indian people to control ?—1 do not know that they are yet controlling it, but I should be afraid of the effect of subsidies taking the trade away from Indians, and legitimate traders being driven out of the field by such influences. I should not be at all afraid of Italian, or German, or other vessels coming in, if they were coming in on equal terms, because then I should feel that we could take care of ourselves. (The Witness withdrew.) Evidence of Colonel C. E. Yate, C.S.I., C.M.G. 1081. Mr. Morley : You were formerly Consul at Muscat, I think ?—Yes. 1082. For no great length of time, was it ? — No, for a short time. 1083. For a year ?—Only during one cold weather season. 1084. Where in Persia have you been ?—In Persia I have been all over the whole of Eastern Persia and in Bushire and Tehran, and I have travelled up to Kazvin. The only part of Persia I have not been in is the purely western part. 1085. Were you there officially ?—I was there as a traveller and officially. I was Consul-General at Meshed for five years. 1086. And at Seistan?—Yes. I spent a whole winter in Seistan, and I travelled all over Eastern Persia—everywhere 1087. You know, what we are busy about here, namely, considering, among other things, how British interests might be affected by the Baghdad Railway if it were completed. Can you tell us any views you have upon that ?—I look on it first of all as essential for us to obtain control of the Baghdad-Khanikin branch line, so as to secure for us equality of treatment for English imports with Russian exports when the Baghdad Railway comes to be made. That is one point, I say, that we should keep in mind before us, namely, the importance to us of the Baghdad-Khanikin branch line. The Khanikin branch is the line that runs to Kasr-i-shirin. 1088. Where are you going to take your line to from Khanikin ?—To Tehran. The Russian line presumably will come down from Tehran, and^ what I propose is that if we, as I presume under the Convention we do, give to Russia the sole right of the construction and control of a railway from the north to Kasr-i-shirin, we should come to terms with Russia and ask them to agree to back up our claim, in the event of the Baghdad Railway being made, to the right of construction from the head of the t Persian^Gulf to Baghdad and up from Baghdad to Kasr-i-shirin—that we should make it a condition of giving to Russia full control of the lines north of Kasr-i-shirin, that she should agree to back up our claim to control all the lines south of Kasr-i-shirin, and throughout the Baghdad province. 1089. What would be the particular advantages to us ?—I am talking now not of the internationalization of the Baghdad Railway ; but I am taking it that under present circumstances it is our object to get the control of the line from the Gulf up to Baghdad, and not only up to Baghdad, which is a point a great many people take but I say that our position in Baghdad city is so peculiar that ]t would nevei do for us to' have divided authority with any other foreign Power in the city of Baghdad ; and therefore our share of the Baghdad Railway, if w r e take it up, should be from the entry of the line into the Baghdad province, and that we should have the control of it throughout the Baghdad province, so that we should have complete command of the branch line from Baghdad to Khanikin, m order that our trade should have an equality of treatment with Russian trade on that line. 1090 Would you be afraid without such an Agreement of discriminating rates against' us ?—We might have that; it is impossible to say. Russia might try to hamper our imports. It will be the main outlet for Russian exports, and if we secure the other half of the line from Kasr-i-shirin southwards, we should be able to come to terms about equality of rates. |'376] J L96 Seventh Meeting, 30th March, 1908. 1091. Now, what is your next point ?—I think that is the main point. Another point is that we should not he content with the small section from Baghdad city down to the Persian Gulf, because first of all there is the large pilgrim traffic that already exists between India and the Holy Places close to Baghdad, and there is already a large Indian population resident there. 1092. Is there ?—All about Baghdad, yes ; near Kerbela and round there there is a very large Indian population. 1093 W hat do you call “ very large ” ; what sort of figure ?—I would not like to say ; I cannot give you the numbers. 1094. But it is considerable?—It is considerable in comparison with the local population. If we give financial assistance or political assistance for the construction of the Baghdad Railway, we ought to try and get command of that railway from a point above Baghdad, where the canals for irrigation will take off from the river. 109.;. Do you think the construction of the railway, apart from this or that tapping of it, will be advantageous or disadvantageous to us in India, for example ?—I see nothing advantageous to us in the Baghdad Railway at all. 1096. No advantage ?—No ; but if we cannot stop it and we are bound to draw into it, then these are the points on which I should say we ought to go in ; these are our objects and the aims we should have. I take it that as a concession for develop ment would accompany a concession for railway construction, we should think of the work that India has done in the construction of the Uganda line. We should take into consideration that owing to the heat of the weather in Lower Mesopotamia there is no possibility of the employment of European labour, and there is no local labour to be got. 109”. Is there no local labour to be got?—I do not think so; at any rate, not enough for a railway, unless you bring it down from the North; and I should think it would be all occupied in making the railway in the North. Consequently, I take it that no Government except the Indian Government could really make a railway from Mosul down through the Baghdad province to the head of the Persian Gulf; at any rate, not anything nearly so cheaply or so well as the Indian Government could. 1098. If there is not poprdation enough to supply labour for the construction of the road, I presume still less is there, or as little is there, to cultivate the land ?—That is so. That is why I say I look to India to supply the labour for the construction of the railway, and to supply the labour for opening out the irrigation canals, provided that a concession for development accompanies the concession for the railway. 1099. Then it would become a kind of Indian annex ?— Yes. I look to India to supply the labour for it, and I look to Lower Mesopotamia as a field for the employment of our surplus Indian labour. 1100. That is to say, India is supposed on your theory to have enough spare labour, or enough men in search of labour, and that land enough is not to be got in India, and so they must go to Mesopotamia to find employment, and to increase the wealth of the world ?—I will not say “must,” but we know what they did in Uganda ; we found enough labour to build the Uganda Railway. 1101 . I am not denying it for a minute ; I was only wondering wdiat your view was ?—I look on Low r er Mesopotamia—I do not say Upper Mesopotamia—as the most promising field for the employment of Indian labour. I do not quite know where the dividing line between Upper and Lower Mesopotamia is, but there is a line of hills called Jebel Sin jar that lies across the plain nearly opposite Mosul. If we take the country south of that, I think that is the field we can look to for colonization by Indian labour. 1102 . Now please tell us about Muscat ?- -What am I to tell you about Muscat ? Is it regarding the arms traffic ? 1103. The arms traffic is one thing, but we are more especially concerned with the commercial interests of British shipowners, Indian traders, and others, in the Gulf. To what extent do you think a firmer assertion of our position in Muscat is desirable or essential ?—It is the greatest aim w^e can have. We have lost two opportunities. After the Treaty of 1862, by which we agreed with France to guarantee it, we had the chance in, I forget the year- -it was the year when u r e gave over Madagascar to France—of including Muscat in the Zanzibar Agreement. We failed, and we lost it. I remember writing about it at the time. We had another chance the other day in the Egyptian and Morocco Agreement of including Muscat, but the Government would not take it up. So we have lost two chances of getting free of engagements that worry us in Muscat. I hope if we get a third that we shall take it. 1104. In what way do you find that they worry you?—If we only had not thisOBBHH9E W MwaaMHram Evidence of Colonel C. E. Yate. 97 Treaty with France in Muscat we could abolish this arras traffic to-morrow. Under the terms of the Treaty with France of 1844, which is a general Treaty, there is no limita tion to any merchandize, and arms can come in. If we could only come to terms with France! I was looking at a Report of mine of 1902 in which, after exhaustive inquiry into the arms traffic at Muscat, I make this recommendation at the end of the Report—“ that the only effective plan that I can think of is for us to induce the Sultan to formally propose by a joint note to England and France the exemption of arms and ammunition from the operation of the treaties, and I would also add liquor as well, as I believe His Highness is really anxious to stop the importation of that. On the receipt of such a note from the Sultan direct negotiations could then be opened by us with France, and Persia, who is equally interested with us in the stoppage of the traffic, might also be induced to add her representations to France as well.” That was written in 1902, and of course a good deal has been doue since then. The arms traffic is the most dangerous thing we have to India at the present moment from there, and it is most essential to stop it. 1105. What are the dangers of the arms traffic to you ?—Because the Afridis and all the frontier tribes come down and get arms there, not only Martinis, but Lee- Metfords. Martinis w'ere then selling at 33 rupees, that is, some 21. each, and Lee-Metfords were selling at 167 rupees, that is, some 111 . each ; but an Afridi will give quadruple that to get hold of any rifle. 1106. It must have occurred to you, I am sure, very often, as an extraordinary thiug that these Afridis and others, who are said to be always hungry, and so on, can find the money to buy these expensive weapons?--It is ; but they do it, because they have got the weapons, as we know to our cost. 1107. What is the evidence of the extent of the sale of arms from the Gulf?— I give a good deal of that evidence in my Report of 1902, showing how the men come down to the different ports and go to Muscat; the arms are run across in dhows to little ports in Persian Baluchistan, and they are a danger to us in British Baluchistan. I had, when I was there, to send armed troops to help the Persians to keep Persian Baluchistan in order. Now the Persian Government can no longer keep Persian Baluchistan in order, because the people there are all getting these arms. All that militates against us in British Baluchistan, and it will add very greatly to our difficulties. I sent in two companies and a couple of mule guns and cleared up every thing, but the forts are very strong there, and once these men are armed with rifles we shall no longer be able to do that. We shall have to send a brigade. The arms question is a very serious one in Persia and in British Baluchistan. 1108. Lord Esher : What type of xAfridi can afford to give 40£. for a rifle ?—Not 40L, but something over 10L He would give double that easily. I cannot say how they get it, but they do get their money. 1109. How do they get their ammunition ?—At Muscat too ; 100 rounds of ammu nition are included, and they can get as much more as they like. 1110. From the same source?—Yes. 1111. 1 did not quite understand whether you thought that the Baghdad Railway would be advantageous or disadvantageous to India?—I do not see any advantage to India at the present moment from the Baghdad Railway, and I should like to try and counterbalance the Baghdad Railway if I could by opening up the Karun Valley. 1112. Then afterwards you told us about the large use of Indian labour, for instance, in making the railway, which might lead possibly to a large settlement of Indians ?—That is what I say. 1113. Would that be advantageous or disadvantageous to India?—I do not know that it would make very much difference. We made the Uganda Railway, and it did not then make very much difference to India. It is a new outlet for Indian labour, that is all. 1111. Beyond that, you do not see any permanent advantage to India in a railway running there ?—Strategically or commercially, do you mean ? 1115. Commercially; I am not thinking of it strategically.—Commercially, the sea line is always the cheapest. 1 am only supposing the Baghdad Railway is a thing that is coming and is coming to last, and really is going to be made. As it is not being made there just now, I should like you to start at once and work up the Karun. 1116. Sir E. Grey : I suppose if Mesopotamia was developed—because, I assume that with the railway would go irrigation—and trade increased very rapidly, that would be a benefit to India, as it would be an outlet for Indian trade ?—Certainly ; I should look forward to that if the country was developed.98 Seventh Meeting, 30th March, 1908. 1117. Why do you think it is absolutely necessary in order to secure equal terms with Russian trade that we should have the branch from Baghdad to Khanikin ? Would it not serve the same purpose if we had control of the line from Baghdad to the Gulf— we should still hold the outlet ?—But the trade might go the other way. 1118. How do you mean?—It might go north from Baghdad up through Asia Minor. 1119. Your suggestion was that the Russians should bring it down to Kasr-i-shirin, and we should have a branch from Baghdad ?—They should have the right of construc tion from the north to Kasr-i-shirin, and we should have the right of construction to the south from Kasr-i-shirin—at least, not that we should have the right, but that we should ask Russia to agree to back up our claim for that when the subject came up for consideration. 1120. Supposing we had the line from Baghdad to the sea alone without that branch, surely that would enable us to secure all the trade ?—I do not think so. 1121. All the trade coming for the north would have to go over the line up to Baghdad ?—From the sea it would, but not what comes down from Asia Minor. Our position in Baghdad is very important, and is so much superior to that of any other Power—Germany, France, or Russia—that we shoidd have complete command on all sides of Baghdad, and not only on one side from Baghdad to the sea. 1 122. The trade coming down to Baghdad by railway in order to go up through Khanikin into Persia would not be British trade ?—It might not be, but as long as we had command of the Khanikin railway we should always have something to negotiate with, either with Russia or with Germany. It would be something in our hands ; we should have some powers that we could negotiate with. 1123. So we should h ave if we had it from Baghdad to the Gulf, because British trade would all go in by the Gulf ?—Then, do you not see that, if we had not the other route, British trade might be seriously handicapped between Baghdad and Khanikin and up to Tehran; whereas, if we had the control of the whole line up to Khanikin, we could negotiate on equal terms. If the Russians do construct a railway from Tehran to Kasr-i-shirin, looking at the map I think you will see that the line from Kermanshah conies into the neutral zone, so we always have a sort of little screw there ; it is not entirely in the Russian sphere. 1124. What do you mean by the development of the Karim River? What steps are you suggesting should be taken for the Karun route ?—We have got two routes from the Karun—Ahwaz to Isfahan and Ahwaz to Burujird. The road from Ahwaz to Isfahan has already been made, but the road from Ahwaz to Burujird has not yet been made, owing to the lawlessness of the country. I should say the first thing we ought to do is to tell the Resident at Bushire to enter into negotiations with the tribes and to try and come to terms with them the same as Lynch Brothers came to terms with the Bakhtiari tribes for the Isfahan road—he should come to terms with these other tribes for the construction of the road to Burujird, so as to be able to carry out that concession at once. 1125. Do you know that country?—No, I have not travelled it ; and that is why I speak with reserve. I should advise you to lose no time, but at once to start and enforce the concession which we already have. Then as to the line along the Karun 'V alley itself up to Dizful, which I think you will see marked on the map, and which is, I take it, a very easy line for a railway, I should ask for a concession for a railway from Mohammerah or wherever we suggest to start it. W T e might start it at Ahwaz where the rocks come, but at any rate I would ask for a concession up the Karun Valley to the foot of the hills at Dizful. It might run through Shustar to Dizful, but still I would apply for that concession at once, so as to be beforehand with anybody else; and if we followed the precedent of the Baghdad Railway and got a concession for irrigation as well, we could then put a stop to the Germans, who are trying to get the same—we should oust them. 1126. If the railway could be continued beyond Dizful, it might be linked up with the north ?—It might, but of course it would be an expensive business taking it through the hills. That is why 1 say make the road there, where we have got the concession, and afterwards we can carry the railway through. You see Burujird is in the Russian sphere, and we cannot hope to do that, but we can at any rate make the road. 1127. If the existing concessions are maintained, do you think we can enforce that concession ? \\ hat do you think of a railway coming right down from the north and coming out at Mohammerah—that might be an alternative route, might it not ?—That might be, and by starting the railway in the Karun River now I think we might put a spoke into the wheel of the Baghdad Railway.Evidence of Colonel C. E. Yate. 99 11^8. Y ould you advocate a railway beyond Dizful ?—It would be a little costlv to make it through the hills beyond that. 1129. Supposing it could be carried further, what would you say to an arrange ment by which we should link up with the Russian railways?-! think that probably would oust the Baghdad Railway altogether. That would be a most effectual check. 1 think, d we can only get a railway up to Burujird, we should be able certainly to have a very good balance against the Baghdad Railway. IRjO. Have you got any other views about railways in Persia, either in the neutral zone or m our own zone ?—In Eastern Persia I do not think a railway could ever pay. It is niipossible to bmld a railway from Bushire to Shiraz—the cost is prohibitive. J he on \ possibility I see of doing it at a reasonable cost is up the Karim Valle} . It we can get a concession in there, and be beforehand with anybody else, and ousl t le Hermans from their irrigation scheme, I think it is of the highest importance, and the thing we ought to try to do at once. IPd . Sir C. Hardinge: You are aware, I suppose, that the Germans have got anothei concession, a right to construct the branch from Baghdad to Khanikin ?— les. . V ' J “’ . here fore it is only by coming to terms with Germany that we could get it. res; but I would say that by making an arrangement with Russia we can get Russia to back us up m coming to terms with Germany. That is my suggestion, not to give the right of a railway to Russia for nothing. ^} e , ^ ave .S°t nothing at all in hand; we have got nothing to give to Russia ^ \\ c ha\ e gi\ on it already. ^ ou see we have given it away for nothing. 1 b&gt;l . I hat is a matter of opinion ■} It is a matter of opinion. But we have a liltlc m hand, because pait of the line from Kermanshah to Kasr-i-shirm goes through the neutial zone, and so we have a little screw that we can put on in coming to terms theie, and I think that would also be a screw in the future, the dim future, to back up our claims as against the German claim. 11 .&gt;5. But if it goes to Kasr-i-shirin it may not necessarily go to Kermanshah ?— I mean for a line coming from Tehran in the north to Kasr-i-shirin, the Russian line. 113(5. It passes rigid through the Russian sphere up to Kasr-i-shirin ?—If I may show it to you on the map you will see that a little bit comes into the neutral zone, anil they 1101113 have to ask for permission to make that little bit through there (explaining on the map). H-• SlR d REY • Do you mean that the country is impracticable for it to go through there {pointing) ?—I cannot say that. I can only say from the look of the map that it is not practicable. I have no better authority than that, as 1 have never been there. I only opine that it is so. As I say, any little thing that we can have by which we could get the Russian support for our claims for the Baghdad Railway I feel would strengthen our hands in the future. [Adjourned.] 2 D [370]DIGEST OF EVIDENCE IN ORDER OF WITNESSES [Note .—The numbers given rejer to questions and answers.~] Evidence of SIR R. RITCHIE, K.C.B., Political and Secret Secretary, India Office. BAHREIN. (a.) Declaration of Protectorate. Our status is governed by the undertaking of the Sheikh not to enter into any agreement or correspon dence with any Power other than Great Britain; not to consent to a resident agent of any other Govern ment without the assent of the British Government; and not to alienate territory except to the British Government, 37. 73-75. It is a quasi-Protectorate, 38. Under the Treaty of 1801 the Chief, as independent Ruler of Bahrein, bound himself to abstain from war in support of slavery, and the British Government engaged to maintain the security of his territory, 79; thus renewing the engagements of 1820, 80. We accepted him as independent Ruler of Bahrein, 80. The British Political Agent is the only foreign Representative, and the Sheikh cannot receive another, 53. Our position has frequently been challenged by the Turk and Persian, but we have refused to listen to either. They deny our claim to protect Bahreinese subjects in Turkey or Persia, 39. We interfere to a certain extent in the administra tion of Bahrein, and recently intervened in favour of German and Persian subjects, 40-42. At present, the Indian Government say that a Court composed of a representative of the Sheikh and the Political Agent exercises jurisdiction over British subjecis and foreigners, 51, 52, 54, 55; but we have no Order in Council, 52. The Indian Government’s proposal that we should, by Order in Council, assume jurisdiction over foreigners would he a great advantage, 19, 50. We should have to make a communication to the Powers concerned. 48. Until an intimation is made to the foreign Powers we have not really a Protectorate in the sense that we desire, 62. As the Order in Council would limit the Sheikh’s present jurisdiction over foreigners, it would be necessary to first come to an agreement with him, 59-61. There should be no difficulty in squaring the Sheikh, and this would strengthen our position in any intima tion to foreign Powers, 63, 70 A declaration of Protectorate would be based on the Treaties of 1880 and 1892, 64. The point is that we should first ascertain from the Government of India that the Sheikh will be willing to give us jurisdiction over foreign subjects, 81. (b.) Arms Traffic and Control of Customs. Bahrein is not a distributing centre for the arms traffic. Only a certain amount from ships calling go to the mainland in dhows, 43. The Sheikh has always refused to give up his customs, 70, 71. He has been offered a guarantee of a fixed sum in return for handing over his customs, but he will not look at it, 71. Compensation to him would take the form of cash, 72. (c.) Bank. The Imperial Bank of Persia could not operate at Bahrein, as its charter limits it to Persia, 46. (d.) Pearl Fisheries. Bahrein is an important place, and wealthy in itself because of the pearl traffic, 45. It is in connection with the pearl fisheries that a foreign Power might challenge our position at Bahrein, 65. The pearl fishe ies in territorial waters belong to the Sheikh, 66; it would be easier to deal with an interloper if it was recognized universally that w’e had a Protectorate, and a right to action in the Sheikh’s interest, 67. MUSCAT. Arms Traffic and Control of Customs. The one thing we are afraid of at Muscat is inter national control. At present the French alone besides ourselves have a voice there. A collection of lighthouse dues might lead to a claim for repre sentation by Germany and others, 5. Muscat is the distributing centre of the arms traffic, 6, 43. At the forthcoming Brussels Conference endeavours are to be made to induce the Powers who have Treaties—France, the United States, and Holland— to give up their right to trade in arms. If they consent w r e shall induce the Sultan to prohibit the import of arms, and he will have to be compensated to the extent of 12,000/. per annum. 6, 13. Any Power contributing to this compensation would claim a right to supervise the illicit trade in arms at Muscat, 8. In order to avoid international control we shall have to compensate the Sultan ourselves. 14, 15. The procedure about arms proposed for Muscat is to have a bonded warehouse, which no arms can enter nor leave without proper licences. This requires a capable administrator, who should be British. 11. Theie is no objection to the Indian Government taking steps to get an Indian Customs official appointed as Head of the Customs at Muscat, 16 ; but care must be taken not to offend the French. 17, 18; and a subsidy will have to be guaranteed to the Sultan, 27, 28.102 Sir R. Ritchie, K.C.B. We shall have to make a bargain acceptable to the Sultan. It may be a losing bargain to us, as the Sultan hates giving up his customs, 29. At present the Sultan, when short of money, gets an advance from the customs farmer. Under British control he would receive a regular sum every month. He will not like the idea, 30. It is doubtful if better collection will be an induce ment to the Sultitn, 31. W e practically admit Musandim to be Muscat territory. The advantage of hoisting the British Hag there remains to be seen, 32, 33. We have a promise from the Sultan not to alienate Musandim without our consent, 35. Miscellaneous. El Eat ?'.—El Katr is interesting because we have allowed the Turks to maintain a military post at El Bidaa, though we have repeatedly told the Porte that we do not recognize their jurisdiction, 82. The \Vahabees .—The question turns on quarrels of the tribes in the interior. We should do nothing except on the coast, 85. The proposal of the Indian Government to send an agent to the Wahabee capital has been forbidden by successive Secretaries of State, 86. Koweit .—The Sheikh is practically under our pro tection. We have guaranteed him against the Turk, the only person who would attack him. 87. The Turks have certain shadowy rights over him, which we have endeavoured to make more shadowy, 88 . In 1902 His Majesty’s Government undertook to defend Koweit, provided the Sheikh complied with their wishes and followed their advice, 89. lie accepted that undertaking, 90. We are not sure whether we shall want Warba. We have a right of pre-emption, but the Sheikh’s rights are uncertain. If he has rights, that would give us control of Warba Roads to the south of Warba Island. But that would only block the southern approach to Um Kasr, and there would still be possibility of access by the northern channel, 92. When we asked the Turks to withdraw from Bubiyan, we did not ask them to withdraw from Um Kasr, 93. Bassidu .— It has never been decided whether we have sovereign rights at Bassidu, or whether we are merely owne-s of the freehold subject to Persian sovereignty, 97. We fly the flag there. 98. Abu Musa .—The Germans have been told that Abu Musa is under our protection, 101 ; and that all com munications must pass through the British Consular Representative, 102. They have not disputed that, 103. The Treaties of 1892 with the Trucial Chiefs and Bahrein have been published in Hertslet’s Treaties, 104; these Treaties constitute a Protec torate, 10 3. Trucial Chiefs .—The Trucial Chiefs do not admit a foreign agent, nor correspond with foreigners nor foreign Powers direct, 108. In the case of the Trucial Chiefs we have such a rough country, and so few dealings, that we have no difficulty in inter- preriug the three conditions of our Agreements, 109. T he Treaties with the Trucial Chiefs meet all con tingencies that are likely to arise, 110, 111. Evidence of SIR J. MACKAY, G.C.M.G., K.C.I.E. Shipping and Trade in the Persian Gulf. The bulk of the trade in the Persian Gulf is carried in British ships. 112. The lines running to the Persian Gulf are: The British India, with a subsidized fast mail and sub sidiary weekly services to Basra, carrying British merchandize by transhipment from Bombay and Karachi, as well as Indian g’oods ; the Anglo-Algeriau Company (Messrs. F. St rick and Co.), Bucknall Brothers, and the M est Hartlepool Company, which, between them, carry 90 per cent, of the trade with London; Messrs. Andrew Weir, who charter occa sional steamers for homeward cargo; the Haraburg- Amerika Line (for details see separate heading); a Russian line from the Black Sen, sending two or three steamers a-year; also a small native Company running occasionally from Bombay to Basra. Steamers from Europe call at Marseilles, Port Said, Port Sudan, Djiboutil, Aden, Muscat, Bunder Abbas, Bahrein, Bushire, and Basra, the principal port of discharge. The greater part of the homeward cargo comes to the United Kingdom, 114. Steamers from Bombay call at all ports in the Gulf, outward and homeward, and carry many native pas sengers, mainly traders and pearl dealers, as well as Arab horses, 114, 115. There is a very large traffic between India and the Gulf; it is largest between October and May, 115. trade out and home goes on all the year, but is largest between October and May, 115. 1 he lecent inciease of shipping in the Persian Gulf is probably due to the doubling of the British India Company s services by contract with the Indian Government, and does not necessarily imply a &lt;&gt;’reat increase in trade, 222. The Hamburg-Amerika Line. 1 he Hambuig—Amerika Line send about one steamer a month to the Persian Gulf with a little outward cargo from Hamburg or Antwerp, though a fair quantity of homeward cargo is brought entirely for the continent. They do not cali at English ports, 114. They must have lost from 3,000/. to 5,000/. a voyage, or from 30,000/. to 50.000/. a-year, 116, 117. 1 heir entry into the Gulf was not a commercial speculation, 118. The trade is not worth it, 167. Their intention was probably to establish a claim to the Gulf trade in view of the ultimate completion of the Baghdad Railway to Basra or Koweit, when the German railway would feed German ships, 128. They are “pegging out a claim,” 129, 130, 163, 170, 172. They have probably a subsidy, but it does not appear in their accounts, 163. The subsidy may be indirect. The continuance of the Persian Gulf line may be one of the conditions of the mail subsidies to their other lines, 164, 165. If supported by the German Government, the Hamburg—Amerika Line will eventually drive British shipping from the Gulf, 127-130. 1 here L not much to object to in a rate agreement between the British Companies and the Ilamburg- Amerika Line, 122. A combine of this character should not lead to a transfer to the German flag, 239. Possibly the reason for approaching the British lines is that the subsidy from the German Govern ment was for a few years only, and has expired, 177. The reason is probably commercial, 193. ^ The British India Company has not suffered from German competition, 119; and is not affected by Herr Ballin's proposals to the English lines 142. t he I lambin g-Amerika Line have told the British India that they have no intention of entering the Bombay trade, and that their sole object is to carry on trade between Basra and Europe, 158. This is done possibly to secure their neutrality for the moment, 159. If the Hamburg-Amerika Line acquired a monopoly of the European trade they would probably eventually run a line from the terminus of the Baghdad RailwaySir J. Mackay, G.C.M.G., K.C.I.E. 103 to Bombay, and would endeavour to make a rate agreement with f ie British India Company, 144. If the whole of the British shipping in the Gulf were replaced by German shipping it would not make much difference to Indian trade, though it would be important p &gt;litically, 147-150. Seventy-five per cent, of the Indian trade in the Gulf is with Mesopotamia, which is the objective of German competition, 155-157. Government Subsidies and Assistance. The claim for a subsidy to the British lines is that it would be given not for commercial but for political reasons, to enable them to fight the Germans with their own weapons. 174, 175; and to protect our trade against subsidized rivals, 227. By enabling British shipping to hold its own for a year or two it might be possible to stop the Germans from continuing to run, 179 ; or to ascertain whether they mean business, 181. The British India Line would not complain if a subsidy were given to the English lines, as they would then have a case for a subsidy to British East Africa, 238. In no case is a subsidy given to a line from the United Kingdom or India to a foreign port such as Basra except for mail purposes, 131. There is no case for a mail subsidy for British ships going to the Persian Gulf, 235, 236. The mail at present reaches Basra via Bombay in nineteen days. A steamer could not proceed direct through the Suez Canal in that time, 237. India ought not to contribute towards subsidizing a shipping line from the United Kingdom to the Gulf, as she already does her share in subsidizing two lines from Bombay and Karachi, 135, 145, 146, 153, 154. Lights, Lighthouses, and Buoys. All steamers using the Gulf would be glad to pay light dues, as there are at present no lights at all. Light dues should give a fair interest on capital, and provide a sinking fund, 135, 136. The British India Company maintains buoys in the Persian Gulf, 130. A few years ago an offer from the Hamburg-Amerika Company to share the cost was declined. 130. The Baghdad Railway and Railway Con cessions in Mesopotamia. The Baghdad Railway is a matter of intimate con cern to India, 147. The increase in trade will be tremendous when the railway is made into Meso potamia, 233. Miscellaneous. As the trade between India and the Persian Gulf is practically as great as between Great Britain and the Gulf, and an enormous number of Indians travel backwards and forwards, it is a fair charge for India to bear half the cost of the Consular establishments there, 135, 139. Evidence of Mr. F. C. STRICK. Political Considerations. The reason the Germans have recently taken an interest in the Persian Gulf is probably not com mercial but political, to secure a status there, 389- 393. Possibly it might be due to their foreseeing that ultimately the trade would become very important, and a consequent desire to get a footing before the development occurs, 395. Shipping and Trade in the Persian Gulf. Strick’s line has been established twenty years, 242. Starting from small beginnings, it has grown gradually, 261, 262. There are now about twenty steamers with an aggregate of about 100,000 tons, 255, 256. The service to the Persian Gulf is monthly under a pooling arrangement with Bucknall Brothers, which lasts for twelve months, 257 ; the West Hartlepool Company also having a small share, 260; but no voice in the question of rates, 372-374. The ships principally proceed from Manchester and London, calling at Marseilles and Djiboutil, to the Persian Guif, 243: where they touch at Lingah, Bunder Abbas, Bushire, and Basra, the port of dis charge, whence they usually proceed direct to London or the continent, 244; calling sometimes at Marseilles, 245. Goods for Bahrein are transhipped at Bushire, 343. The bulk of the goods from England are Manchester goods, 309. The Manchester shippers are bound to the British lines by contract. A new contract with ah the prin- [376] cipal shippers commences next year, 336. This secures the trade, 338. From Marseilles and Antwerp a lot of sugar is shipped, 310. The Antwerp trade would not justify a steamer once a month, 311. When short of export cargo ships fill with coal at Cardiff for bunkering steamers in the Gulf. 313, 314. German coal has been tried there, but without success, not being equal to Cardiff coal, 315, 316. The produce of the Gulf is becoming more gene rally known in England, and English millers take a good deal of the grain, which is cheaper than Black Sea grain, 304, 305. Besides grain, liquorice root and dates (for two months in the year) are brought from the Gulf; three cargoes of dates are taken every year to New York direct, 369-371. The Indian trade is in the hands of the British India Company, 376. The British India Company take very little cargo from England by transhipment at Bombay, because they have more Indian cargo than they can carry, 377-380. Occasionally, if short of cargo from the Persian Gulf, the ships of the British combine call at Karachi, but generally speaking they have left the trade alone since the fight between the Hansa Line and the P. and 0., 246, 247. The Hamburg-Amerika Line. The Hamburg-Amerika Line commenced running fifteen months ago, 266. Their ships are principally old 3,000-ton boats, running once a month fr &gt;m Hamburg and Antwerp to the Gulf, calling at Mar seilles, but at no British port, 281. They only get small cargoes of sugar from Antwerp,. 2 E104 Mr. F. C. Strick. and scarcely any from Marseilles, where the British lines have a contract for four years ahead, 286. Formerly the sugar from Antwerp was brought to London for transhipment, but, when the Ilamburg- Amerika Line commenced calling at Antwerp the shippers gave them the preference, and the British lines now put in and bid against them every month, 284. The Hamburg-Amerika Line import barley and paddy to (iermany, 3o5-335. They have been cutting rates all round, outwards and homewards, 270, 397. Their rates are lower than the British rates, 407. They are now anxious to come to a rate agree ment, and recently Herr Ballin approached Mr. Lloyd, of Bucknall’s, on the subject, 273. Herr Ballin wanted at first to pool the trade, stating that they would be content with a quarter of the trade; but, as that was declined, he suggested a rate agreement, 275, 276. The object of these proposals is to get a share of the trade with England, where there is a better market for Persian Gulf produce than in Germany, 295. Already the Hamburg-Amerika Line get a small quantity of Manchester goods, carried from Liverpool to Hamburg, and there transhipped, 327. The Persian Gulf branch does not pay the Hamburg- Amerika Company, 285. The line is undoubtedly subsidized, 290; there is no proof of this, 293. Herr Ballin stated that it was a “ philanthropic line,” and that he was “ bound to go there,” 287-289. So long as the Hamburg-Amerika Line confines its operations to the continental trade, the British lines have the advantage; but, if they came to London, it would be another matter, and there would be a direct fight, 318, 408. Government Subsidies and Assistance. The British lines trading direct with the Gulf could carry the mails quicker than the British India Company, 384. Lighterage. There are only 18 feet of water on the bar of the Shat-el-Arab, and some of the steamers draw 21 feet; there are one or two old steamers out there used for lighterage, 329. Lights, Lighthouses, and Buoys. The Persian Gulf is badly lighted, 342. There is no real demand for a lighthouse, 345-347. It would be worth while to buoy the bar of the Shat-el-Arab, as the navigation is very difficult, and the bar is always shifting, 348-352. The Baghdad Railway and Railway Conces sions in Mesopotamia. The trade in Manchester goods would not be seriously affected by the Baghdad Railway being brought to the Gulf, 357-365. The grain trade of Mesopotamia would be de veloped, which would improve the return cargo, 250, 366, 388. It would tempt the competition of German steamers, 251. The fact of the line being virtually German would increase the amount of cargo, principally grain, which they would bring home, 252-254. Evidence of Mr. E. LLOYD, Managing Director of Bucknall Steam-ship Lines (Limited). Shipping and Trade in the Persian Gulf. None of Bucknall’s steamers are definitely ear marked for the Persian Gulf trade, though two are more or less regularly in it. which are supplemented as required, 464. In the Persian Gulf Bucknall’s work in conjunction with Frank Strick and Co., running alternate steamers against the undesirable opposition of the Hamburg- Amerika Line, 419. Their cargoes are similar to those of Strick, cotton from Manchester and sugar from Marseilles being the principal articles of export, 427-429. The trade has grown considerably within the last ten years, 460. Bucknall’s have no regular Indian trade in con nection with the Persian Gulf line, but ships with insufficient cargo from the Gulf sometimes go to India to load up, 425. The Hamburg-Amerika Line. The Hamburg-Amerika Line have taken cargo from the British lines and have brought down rates of freight, 421. They send one steamer a month of about 4,000 tons—say, 50.000 tons for the year. Owing to this competition the British lines have had occasionally to send steamers to India to load home, 425. Hamburg is now a centre of direct import for Persian Gulf produce, which formerly came by transhipment from London, 444. The Hamburg-Amerika Line have not as yet made any direct attack on British trade in the Gulf, but have taken goods from Manchester to the Gulf by transhipment at Hamburg, 448; these goods being taken to Hamburg by the Currie Line, 798. The Hamburg-Amerika Line stand well with the German Government, and probably receive both moral and financial support, 488. Without Government aid their Persian Gulf line could not hold its head above water, 430, 431. Herr Ballin spoke of it as “ a philanthropic side of the Hamburg-AmeriVa operations,” meaning that he could make no profits, and hoped for no profits in the trade, 432, 433. He described it as a “ political ” line, meaning that it is directed by some force behind, 434, 435 ; pre sumably directed towards the development of Ger man commerce in that quarter of the globe, 436. It perhaps forms part of the same programme as the Baghdad Railway. The shipping might be viewed as running parallel with the completion of that rail way, 437. Herr Ballin resented the interference of the British lines, and stated that his Company had stepped upon the scene to develop German trade and German connections, 4o7. British lines are at present holding their own against the Hamburg-Amerika line, and can do so as long as they don’t mind losses, 440. Eventually either the Hamburg-Amerika line must withdraw or come to an agreement with the British lines, 441. Such an agreement would not affect the Man chester goods trade, as the Germans do not compete in this line, but it would be injurious to the British hardware trade, 443, 444. The profits made by the Hamburg-Amerika Line the year before last were largely due to the Russo- Japanese war, 490.Mr. E. Lloyd. 105 Lighterage. At Bushire the landing- facilities are unsatisfactory. Bucknalls had a scheme for forming- a landing Com pany there, but it failed owing to local jealousies, 483, 484. At Basra, where there are only 17 feet of water on the bar, Bucknalls Keep a steam lighter of 1,400 tons, which relieves heavy-draught steamers of their cargo, 502, 503. As the draught of ocean-going ships is too great to cross the bar, it is essential to have a certain amount of lighterage in connectiou with the Persian Gulf trade, 503, 504. Lights, Lighthouses, and Buoys. The lighting in the Persian Gulf is not satisfactory, 473; but it would not be worth while paying light dues to have it improved, 474, 475. Something might be done to improve the buoys, 47G; but dues should be levied on the goods by the local authorities and not on the ships, owing to the small extent of the shipping, 477-482. Quarantine, Occasionally there is trouble about quarantine, 494. When the local authorities imagine there is plague on board, the ship is told to lie off. There is no redress nor appeal. Ships lie there until somebody can get ashore with stronger influence, when the plague is got rid of very easily. 495, 496. The Baghdad Railway and Railway Con cessions in Mesopotamia. The Baghdad Railway would probably be in jurious, 438, 439. If Germany controlled the railway, special terms would probably be granted, as on German State Railways, which would be detrimental to British shipping here, as in East Africa and the Levant, 469, 470. A German railway would develop trade to the exclusion of British shipping, owing to special pre ferential through rates. 509. If equal terms were granted to British traders it, would be beneficial to British shipping, 471, 472. BAHREIN. British ships call at Bahrein when necessary, but the trade is mainly in shell, which is chiefly in the hands of the Germans, 485. Evidence of Sir L. DANE, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Secretary to the Foreign Department of the Government of India. Baghdad Railway and Railway Concessions in Mesopotamia. From an Indian military point of view the Baghdad Railway is undesirable, 524. India has to fear, first, an extension of the Baghdad Railway through Persia to the Afghan and Baluchi frontiers, though the difficulties of the route render this unlikely for some years ; and. secondly, the formation of a port, nominally commercial, at the head of the Gulf, which would attract foreign squadrons, and lead to a demand for an increase of British naval strength in these waters, and a demand on the Indian Government for an increase of their subsidy to the navy, 525, 526. Indian military opinion is opposed to linking up the Baghdad Railway with the Indian railway system, 523, 544. Civil opinion in India would welcome such an arrangement, 543. Railway Concessions in Northern Persia. Indian opinion would be dead against linking up the Russian and Indian railway systems, 529. Under existing conditions, India is secured by the fact that it would take Russia at least four years to lay a railway to the neighbourhood of Seistan, whereas we could make a railway from Nushki to Seistan in eighteen months, 530. If Russia were allowed to make a railway up to the limits of her zone it would bring her over the worst part of the distance separating her from India. We prefer to be defended by the inhospitable wastes which Russia would have to traverse. 530, 536. The Russians should not be allowed to construct a railway south of Meshed ; no such line could be built on commercial grounds unless linked up with the Indian railways, 550. If the Russians should make a railway to the limits of their sphere, the Indian Government would propose a countervailing railway in their own sphere, from Bunder Abbas to Seistan, which is a good route, but costly, and likely to yield only small returns, 566-568. This line is preferred to a railway from Nushki to Seistan, as a means of holding Seistan, as, in the event of a reverse, our troops could retire along it to the sea and still leave 430 miles of desert between the Russians and Nushki, whereas the Nushki-Seistan Railway, if constructed, would eventually facilitate their advance, 539. For the Russians, the most suitable line com mercially is from Kazvin to Hamadan, and thence through Kermanshah to Khanikin, which would be entirely in the Russian sphere and would give them control of the main artery of trade from Baghdad into Northern and North-Western Persia, 550-552. This would have the disadvantage, from the Russian point of view, of acting as a feeder to the Baghdad Railway, 552. The alternative of a Russian line from Julfa through Kazvin, Tehran, and Khoramabad, joining a British line from Mohammerah, would not act as a feeder to the Baghdad Railway, but is probably im practicable owing to the ferocity of the Lurs and the difficulty of the country north of Dizful, 554, 560-562. It would be preferable to let the Russians build a railway to Isfahan, linking up there with a British line from Shiraz, which is a practicable route; then, whether the British terminus is at Mohammerah or Bunder Abbas, the southern end would be under British control, which would allay Indian fears as to the good faith of Russia, 555, 556, 559 (See below, “ Railway Concessions in Southern Persia,” as to details of proposed British line from Mohammerah.) We ought to obtain as many Railway Concessions as possible west of the neutral zone, without the necessity of carrying them out, at the same time interesting the Russians in them so as to keep them away from our frontier, 569, 570. Railway Concessions in Southern Persia. The existing main trade route to the interior is an almost impossible mule track from Bushire, 517, 556.106 Sik L. Dane, K.C.I.K, C.S.I. A railway here is impossible without a mono rail. 5 &gt;7. , Commercially, what is required is a route by which British goods can be conveyed to the Persian plateau, 517; preferably to Shiraz, 519 ; because it is one of the most fertile portions of Persia, is in the neutral zone, is a good distributing centre, and is astride of any eventual extension of the Baghdad Railway into Southern or Eastern Persia, 520. Shiraz is in communication with Isfahan by a road for wheeled vehicles, 517. A line from Bunder Abbas to Shiraz has been surveyed by Captain Wilson and is possible, .il4. A route from Mohammerah to fthiraz would be better than from Bunder Abbas, as it would not only take the present Bushire trade, but would divert a good deal of the trade from the Shat-el-Arab, and render the intrusion of a foreign line into that south western corner of Persia commercially impossible, 514. 515. 517. A feasible route was surveyed in 1902 by Captain Hopkins, a railway expert, from Mohammerah via Behbehan to Shiraz, the ruling gradient being 1 in 40, 517, 518. . This gradient is commercially practicable tor a metre-gauge railway, ;)63, 565. This line could ecentually be linked up, if de sirable, with the Russian railways (for detail of the proposed linking up with the Russian railways see Railway Concessions in Northern Persia ”) or with the Indian railways, 534. The proposed line to connect it with the Indian railways has been surveyed by Captain Hopkins, 535, 574. It runs from Nushki via Koh-i-Mahk Sian to Nasratabad Tope, thence across the Lut desert to a point east of Kerman, but not necessarily entering Kerman owing to the dip: thence it runs via Saidabad and Lake Niriz to Shiraz, 573. A branch should eventually be constructed from the vicinity of Bam to Bunder Abbas, the object being strategical, so that if we were turned out from the western end of the line by a Power coming from the west along the railway we should still be in a strong position, with a base at Hunder Abbas foi defending the eastern section, 572. This branch would not pay commercially, 599. The first step to be taken to forestall the Baghdad Railway should be to obtain a Concession for a railway from Mohammerah or Hawizeh to Shiraz, with a branch to the sea, 512, 545; and with a port between the mouths of the Shat-el-Arab and Bunder Dilam to cover the case of the Karun ceasing to be navigable, 534. . The Concession would have to be obtained for private individuals, and not for the Government, 605. BAHREIN. (a.) Declaration of Protectorate. Practically all civil cases, and nearly all recent criminal cases, concerning foreigners at Bahrein have been made over by the Sheikh to the English Political Agent t &gt; be dealt with, 647. An Order in Council is required to put ourselves on a more legal fooling. The Sheikh has no objection to our dealing with all foreigners’ cases, but our jurisdiction might be challenged, and if the Order in Council were passed before any serious case occurred our position would be stronger, 642, 650. The Order in Council should recite what we already do, 651. (b.) Customs Administration. The Sheikh of Bahrein objects to our controlling his Customs for the same reason as the Sultan of Muscat. He does not like to be protected against his will, or that we should know his income, 643. Major Cox hopes to carry this through. The Sheikh is not going to farm his Customs again through the Hindoo dealers, 644. By obtaining control of the Customs we should control the Sheikh’s sources of income, and stop the arms traffic, 645. This matter is less important at Bahrein than at Muscat, as we are in a strong position there already, thanks to the Germans and Persians themselves, 645. (c.) Consular Protection. The Sheikh of Bahrein would object strongly if he found we did not protect his subjects. If we could insist upon the I’ersian Government recognizing not only our good offices, but Consular protection, it would be most satisfactory, 655. MUSCAT. Arms Traffic and Control of Customs. The Government of India consider it important to have a preponderating influence at Muscat owing to its siruatiou, 607. 608. Theoretically our influence there is a joint one with France, and in the case of the Bunder Gisseh coal depot we lost it for a time, but practically the Government of India preponderates largely : they pay the annual subsidy that Zanzibar is supposed to pay to Muscat; they are accommodating in the matter of loans; the Sultan looks to India to protect his interests; and the bulk of the traders in Muscat are British Indians, 609. So long as we retain our present position and influence, the French Consul can do little harm, but we should prefer not to have him there, 610. By obtaining control of the Customs we should hold the purse-strings and thereby ensure a pre ponderating influence. 611. The Sultan dislikes the idea because he knows it would make him entirely depend on us, 612. Two arrangements have been proposed: one that in consideration of an annual advance the Indian Government should take entire charge of the Customs, which we could not secure now ; the other, which is possible, that we should secure a modified control, the Sultan, in return for a guaranteed annual income, agreeing to our lending an officer to control the Customs, 613. The Government of India would prefer that Muscat should not be brought within the Brussels Act, 618; as this would open the door to international control, 619. The Indian Government have two or three times suggested that the French Government should be induced to stop the arms traffic, 621; but without success, 622. Unless the French agree it is impossible to stop the arms traffic, but even its continuance is preferable to international control at Muscat, 637. The Sultan has no power to suppress the arms traffic himself, and the French would object if he made the attempt, 626. The trade is carried on mainly under the French flag from a place called Sur. Ihe bulk of the trade is 'to the Persian and Turkish coast, to Arabia, Persia, Afghanistan, and the tribes on the north west frontier, 627. 628. Many suggestions have been made to stop this trade, which is most dangerous to India, 630. The Sultan has prohibited the trade in arms with Persia, the drucial Chiefs, Bahrein, and India, because all these countries have prohibited the import of arms, but not with Turkey, because Turkey has not prohibited it. If Turkey would prohibit it we should be able to search any boat in the Persian Gulf, except those under foreign colours, as they would107 Sir L. Dane, K.C I.E., C.S.L necessarily be contraband, since no port in the Persian Gulf would be open to the trade The Sultan has given us the power of stopping and searching Muscat boats, and we have a rig'ht to search all boats in Persian territorial waters and seize those carrying arms, and carry them to the nearest Persian port to be condemned, 631. There are usually two gun-boats on the coast in the running season—from October to May. Hitherto they have not been successful, because when the gun-boat appears in sight the arms are thrown over board and subsequently recovered, 631. By using the telegraph line along the coast to Jashk, with telephones and some camel watchmen, it is hojied to inform gun-boats where cargoes are to be run, as Afghan traders collect at, those points, 631. Wireless telegraphy would greatly facilitate it; at present flag signalling is used for communicating with the gun-boats. No boats with arms have yet been captured, though known to be there, 632. This year the Sultan of Muscat has been induced to prohibit the landing of Afghans at Muscat, which has disorganized the arrangements of the traders, and no arms have been landed ; but it is a dubious experi ment, and eventually the Afghans will send Persians and Baluchis across instead, 632. It is proposed to compensate the Sultan for the loss of the revenues from arms running by raising the 5,760/. paid to him by the Government of India for Zanzibar to 15,000/., 634, 635. Miscellaneous. Koweit .—Everything that is really necessary at the moment has been done, 652. There is a difficulty about Consular protection to Koweit subjects. We have insisted upon it in Persia two or three times. In Turkey we cannot insist on it without raising the question of the status of Koweit, which is better left undecided, 655, 656. Evidence of Mr. P. THOMAS, Manager of Bucknall Brothers’ Persian Gulf Line. Political Considerations. The Anglo-Russian Convention has given away our trade to Russia. 688; the cargo that goes to Baghdad finds its way through Khanikin to Ilamadan and Northern Persia, and as this has been placed in the Russian sphere, the Russians are in a position to place duties against our merchandize in favour of British or Russian goods brought by Russian trans port from Trebizond, 689-692, 797. Shipping and Trade in the Persian Gulf. Bucknall’s Persian Gulf bine was inaugurated in 1897. 657, 658. It has grown from one to about twenty steamers a-year, 659; cargo was originally sent by Bombay, but Bucknall’s established a direct service to the Gulf, 661. Bucknall’s form a combine with Messrs. Strick, 678. Steamers run from Manchester to the Thames, and thence to the Gulf via Marseilles, 662; where they pick up sugar, and where the St. Louis Company have given the Combine a contract for seven years rather than accept the German terms, 683. The ships are of 4,000 to 5,000 tons dead weight, 664; and are of this small size in order to cross the bar of the Shat-el-Arab. where the spring-tides give 16 to 18 feet of water, 664, 665. In addition to the Combine the British India mail boats go to the Gulf every week with 1,400 to 1,500 tons of cargo. They are dependent for profits on the mail subvention. 674-676. The Russians send three steamers a-year, 666; and the Austrians two a-year, one in the date season (September and October) and one for other cargo, 668. The Hamburg-Amerika Line. The Hamburg-Amerika Line started nineteen months ago, and have sent on an average one steamer a-month, 669. Their loss is estimated at 30,000/. to 40,000/. a-year, 670. Herr Baffin has stated that the loss is not for their account, 671-673. They entered the Gulf for political reasons, 722; to enable Germany to assert a stake in the Gulf, 727. The British Combine could run for the next seven years without loss, owing to contracts, but the Hamburg-Amerika Line is disorganizing, 779. If the Hamburg-Amerika Line came to Liverpool and Manchester the British lines would have to lower their rates, 793; and it would be very hard to com pete with them if still supported by the German Government, 794. There is no room for both, 780. Ihere are 5,000 tons of grain in warehouse at Hamburg, which they have not been able to sell, 785. They have taken away some of the Antwerp trade from the British lines, 786; but cannot cut in as regards the export cargo, 788. The Germans, through the instrumentality of a man named Wonckhaus, have secured the shell trade, but it is only a deck trade, and should be left to them, 789-792. Government Subsidies and Assistance. The British Shipping Combine have lacked assist ance from the British Government, 685; which might have prevented the Customs’ maladministration in Persia and Turkey, 686. When approached the Government shrugs its shoulders for fear of international complications, 687. Assistance does not necessarily mean a subsidy, 733. It might be given by sending Government cargo to the Gulf or Aden by the British lines, instead of putting it up to competition, and so cutting down rates, /32. The mail should go from Basra in British ships to Suez or Aden instead of via Bombay, 677, 678, 746- 748; reducing the time from three weeks to fourteen days, 748, 749; especially as the Gulf trade with India is small as compared with the United Kingdom, 678. The British India Line, which at present carries the mails, is dependent on the Government subven tion, 674-676. Navigation on the Tigris, Euphrates, and Karun. Goods could be carried on the river at Jess frei'&gt;-ht than it would pay a railway to run, 76z. Messrs. Lynch have a right to have two steamers on the river with one in reserve. The Turks have seven steamers, and are building two, 767. If Great Britain had six steamers they could beat 2 F [376]108 Me. P. Thomas. the German railway rates on the Tigris but not on the Euphrates, 768. Steamers could not run above Baghdad to Mosul all the year, as the river is a torrent for part of the year, 770; nothing but stern-wheelers would do, 774. Lighterage. A pier with a “bund” is required at Bushire, 718. Lights, Lighthouses, and Buoys. There is not a buoy at Bahrein, 736. The British Government should buoy the channels there. 740. The Turks should be made to buoy the Shat-el- Arab, paying the cost from the charges levied for the use of “seafs” or wharf warehouses at Basra, 740. Buoys are essential here, 750. There is not a single lighthouse in the Persian Gulf, 753. About three are required at economically neces sary points, 754. The Turkish Government should pay for them out of the duties they impose, 756. The shipping might expect to pay a fair share of the cost in light dues, but would like to be consulted first. The Turks should not be allowed to impose dues, 758. Quarantine. Unauthorized quarantine is often imposed, and it is sometimes necessary to pay 501. to come out of it, 719. Baghdad Railway and Railway Concessions in Mesopotamia. The Baghdad Railway will not be completed unless England completes it, G93; and could not pay in competition with water transit, 694. Railways here would not pay, except a short one from Baghdad to Kerbela to take ihe pilgrim traffic, 695. The Baghdad Railway would increase German influence politically on the break-up of Turkey, but would have no effect on trade, 698. We should obtain the privilege of a settlement at Kurna, the point of confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates, 695; which would form the terminus of warer-borne goods, 700. A Concession should be obtained for a railway from Kurna through Amara and Kerbela to Baghdad, 695, 702; a distance of 220 miles. 707; without gradient, 707 ; tapping the Tigris and Euphrates, 768 ; and traversing a magnificent wheat country, 696; with canals already in existence, 695, 709; and only requiring the ends to be opened for irrigation, 695. This would be one of the richest lines in the world, 695; and this, not the Baghdad Railway, is what Germany wants, 702-704. MISCELLANEOUS. Coaling Stations —Coaling stations should be created at Kharak, Ormuz, and Koweit for strategical purposes, in anticipation of Russia gaining a port in the Gulf, such as Mohammerah, 712-716. Evidence of Mr. Gr. LLOYD. Political Considerations. German competition is already serious and is going to be very serious, 803. Its object is politically connected with German Islamic policy, to create an interest, 804, 805. Mr. Wbnckhaus is an ordinary trader. 809 ; he is probably subsidized, 810 ; the object of the German Government in encouraging him is to have a vested political interest in the Gulf, 811. In Mesopotamia if a country is commercially pre dominant it will be politically predominant also, 851. If we let any Power come into Mesopotamia south of Baghdad and cut across the line from Baghdad to Khanikin, we may say good-bye to our position in the Gulf, 872 The loss of our commercial position in the Gulf would have a serious effect on our prestige in India, 877. The Germans have felt our political position in the Gulf, and have now wisely determined to attack us commercially through cheap trades, as they have done successfully in other parts of the East, and to have interests in the Gulf where they had none. Wherever they can they make rate agreements with British Companies and underquote them system atically, and then we are surprised to find our markets going. Our markets do go as regards cheap trade. Manchester trade is maintained, but there are signs that it is not safe. That is why our communi cations are important in the Gulf, and inadequate unless we do something to strengthen them and bring the Germans to better terms with us, 872. The Hamburg-Amerika Line. Herr Ballin has approached the British shipping lines in the Gulf with proposals for a rate agreement, 813, 814. The danger of a rate agreement is that it is impossible to detect when the German firms under quote the minimum rate, owing to the fact that they quote through rates from an inland town in Germany to an inland town in the country of destination, and it is impossible to determine what portion of the through rates goes to the ships; this is not yet understood by our shipping Companies, 815, 819. That system is very likely to be extended over the Oriental railways through Asia Minor, 817. The result of a rate agreement would be to transfer a great deal of trade to Germany, as has already happened in the Levant trade, 818. If there is a rate agreement, British trade will disappear in seven years or so, 825. Government Subsidies and Assistance. Some form of assistance to enable the British Com panies to continue the fight with the Hamburg- Amerika line is desirable, 826. A study of the Hamburg-Amerika balance sheet indicates that it is a favourable time for us to con tinue warfare and not to make agreements with them, 826. No subsidy can be detected in the Hamburg- Amerika balance sheet. 862. The subsidy is said to be paid through the Em peror ; but there are different ways of doing it, 863. The trade is subsidized over the German State railways. 863. The British Companies could not beat them off without assistance, 827. At present the Persian Gulf trade is purely a Man chester trade, and if this is driven out by Indian and Japanese competition, which is probable, our trade goes. By continuing the fight we should enable manufacturers to develop a trade in cheap articles.maammammmm Mr. G. Lloyd. 109 827-829; such as hardware, machinery, agricultural implements, &amp;c., as the Germans are already doing most effectively, 827. The Germans have already taken the hardware trade from us, 8f)7. We can do more trade than we are now doing, 859. Lighterage. Lighterage is one of the most important require ments in the Gulf, 830. Bushire and Bahrein are the most important places, and in a lesser degree Basra or Dayir, 842. At present the lighterage at Persian ports is in the hands of the Hamieldash, who farms it from the Persian Government, and levies an unjust and arbi trary toll on all goods, and sends out lighters to ships or not according to the bribe given him, 832. One of, or all of, the British Shipping Companies in the Gulf might take it up and find it remunerative, 831, 870. To obtain the Concession it might be necessary to use force, though it would require very little, 832. Probably it could be obtained by paying the Hamieldash more than he at present gets, 837, 838. The British Agent should receive instructions to negotiate, 841. Lights, Lighthouses, and Buoys. The lighting of the Persian Gulf is very important, 870. Baghdad Railway, and Railway Concessions in Mesopotamia. If the Baghdad Railway were completed entirely in German hands there would be an extension of the through rate (see the Hamburg-Amerika Line), 821, 822. Goods could not go from Europe to Mesopotamia by the Baghdad Railway, as land carriage could not compete with water carriage unless heavily sub sidized, 823. The Germans w r ould not subsidize the Hamburg- Amerika Line and the Baghdad Railway simul taneously, 824. There could be no possibilhy of a railway from Mohammerah to Kurna. There is no object in it, as it would have to compete with river traffic, 847, 848. To build a line from Baghdad to Mohammerah would involve the difficulty of its being in Persian territory; the present Concession for the Baghdad Railway being a line on the right bank of the river, 849. Koweit is probably the best terminus for the Baghdad Railway on the Persian Gulf. Um Kasr is unlikely. Basra is the most likely terminus, now that Koweit is improbable. It is not likely that the railway will be built beyond Baghdad for a time. But the Germans would be anxious to get to the head of the Gulf eventually, and their Concession would enable them to charge foreign shipping any dues they like, 853. There are many w^ays in which they could evade a most-favoured-nation clause, 854. The line between Kerbela and Khanikin is prob ably the most important part of the Baghdad Rail way, and should repay the capital outlay in two years, or even in one, 850. It is most important to British interests, 850; owing to the pilgrim traffic, 851. Now that the important towns in Central Persia, the objectives of our caravans, are in the Russian zoue. it is of paramount importance for us to maintain our rights on the Khanikin road as far as the Persian frontier, the great preponderance of trade on this road being British, 851. In any other hands it would prove very detri mental to us, 850. The important thing is that the British make the line to Khanikin. If built from Baghdad we would find the Germans in our path, and there would be difficulties, but we could make a very good case for a hue from a point slightly below Baghdad to Khanikin, 8 &gt;2. Evidence of Mr. H. F. B. LYNCH, M.P. Political Considerations. To control the head of the Persian Gulf, the islands of Kishm, Henjam, and Larak should be included in the British sphere. By drawing the line delimiting the British sphere from Lingah a fruitful ground for diplomatic difficulties would have been avoided, 902. The British Government should strengthen their hold in the Persian Gulf by pursuing their present policy even more strenuously, by lighting, buoying, and policing the Gulf, 923. The idea that British goods will be allowed to pass freely into the Russian sphere in Persia is erroneous. On their railways the Russians will introduce their zone system, and on their roads transport difficulties will be raised, 935. We should develop our existing Concessions in Persia, and develop the neutral zone, 937. Roads should be built rather than railways, 938. Shipping and Trade in the Persian Gulf. The export trade has fallen very largely into the hands of the natives, 879. The import trade is brought by British lines to Basra, then by river steamers to Baghdad, and thence by the Khanikin trade route into Persia, 888-890. The trade of Mesopotamia amounts to about 3^ millions sterling a-year, mainly British and Indian, including also sugar from Marseilles, 913. German merchandize is a very small matter, 919, 920. There is a monthly service of German steamers to the Gulf, 919. Navigation on the Tigris, Euphrates, and Karun. The Tigris steamers carry European and Indian goods, mainly piece-goods and sugar, from Basra to Baghdad, taking three or four days, 881-884. There are six Turkish steamers, and two more are being sent out, 994. They take the greater part of the cargo, 915. If the Germans got control of the Turkish steamers, as well as of the Baghdad Railv/ay, Lynch Brothers would be driven out, 976-978. The best way to increase British and Indian trade with Mesopotamia would be to render the course of the Euphrates navigable by larger steamers and to irrigate the country, and so attract a larger popula tion, 913.110 Mr. H. F. B. Lynch, M.P, The dimensions of the present steamers are : length, 210 feet; breadth, 40 feet; draught, from 2 ft. 6 in. to 4 ft. 6 in.. 958, 959. The obstacles to navigation are the sharp bends in the river and its shallowness for seven months in the year, 961. In Mesopotamia navigation should not be entirely sacrificed to irrigation, 973. Lynch Brothers have a separate service up the Karun from Mohammerah, 900, 979. There is a Persian steamer also, 980. The Karun River traffic does not pay, 982. If the road from Ahwaz to Sultanabad is con structed the river traffic ought to increase, 982, 983. Quarantine, Absurd Quarantine Regulations, but no deliberate obstruction, 967. The Baghdad Railway and Railway Conces sions in Mesopotamia. The main effect of the Baghdad Railway would be to open up the countries served to the markets of Central Europe, 885, 886. It will ultimately connect with the European railway system by a bridge over the Bosphorus, 886. The railway would not compete against transport by sea; but, subsidized by kilometric guarantees as against river transport, goods would be carried for practically nothing, and the resulting competition from Central Europe would fall on British goods, 886, 893. The objections to the Baghdad Railway are :— First, its injurious effect on Turkish finances. 909. Second, irrigation ought to precede railway con struction, 910, 911. Third, its connection with the Hedjaz Railway at Killis renders it a strategical menace to Egypt. 912 Fourth, the injurious results to British trade from Central European competition, 913. Fifth, if linked up with the Russian Railways, the Turkish main strategical position at Erzinjan, in Asia Minor, could be taken in fiank by Russian troops sent into Northern Mesopotamia, 914. It is not a British interest that the Baghdad Rail way should be built. It can only be built with British assistance. Money for this purpose can only be raised on the security of the Turkish ceded revenues, on which England has a hold, since if England refused consent to the extra 3 per cent, custom duties, Turkey could not pay the army in Macedonia. 924. If the railway must be built, Germany should not have control beyond Killis. The sections from Killis to the Persian Gulf and from Killis to Aleppo should be under British or Anglo-French control, 924. The present projected route from Killis to the Persian Gulf would have to be heavily policed between Killis and Mosul. A better route would be to follow the Euphrates, with a branch to Baghdad and Mosul, 924. A railway from Baghdad to Khanikin and Persia would not affect British trade in any way, 895-897. This railway is the only one in these regions which would pay without a kilometric guarantee, 898. It would open up the fine grain-growing district of Hamadau, would take the pilgrim traffic to Kerbela, and carry all the trade up the trade route, 899. Railway Concessions in Northern Persia. Lynch Brothers have a Concession for a road from Ahwaz through Luristan to Khoramabad and Sul tanabad, 942. 943. As far as Dizful there are no difficulties for railway construction, 946. Beyond that the main difficulty arises from the Lur tribes, 947. The routes through Khoramabad and Khanikin are the only two easy passages into Persia, 947. A road from Ahwaz to Khoramabad and Tehran, not passing through a Turkish custom-house, would divert a portion of the traffic by Baghdad and Khanikin, 948, 949; but would not entirely oust it owing to the large number of traders in Baghdad, 950. A railway from Mohammerah, through Ahwaz, linking up through Khoramabad and Tehran with the Russian railway at Julfa, would compete seriously with the Baghdad Railway in passenger traffic, being a much cooler and quicker route, 952-957. Miscellaneous. We should obtain Concessions for roads, not rail ways, 937, 938. Lynch Brothers’ Concession for the Ahwaz-Ispahan (Bakhtiari) road is for twenty-five years, 990. In that corner of Persia the roads are in British hands practically for as long as we like, 993. Evidence of Major J. A. DOUGLAS. Railway Concessions in Northern Persia. The easiest route for a railway from the Persian Gulf to Northern Persia is from Ahwuz via Dizful to Khoramabad. 999. 1000. It could connect with an extension of the Russian railways from Julfa via Ilamadan and Burujird, 1002, 1018. The Russians have made a new road from Kazvin to Ilamadan, 1002. Railway construction from Hamadan to Kazvin is not easy. Kazvin is 4,000 feet; there is a pass 7,000 feet: and on the northern side of the pass there is a very steep 4,000-feet rise. 1006. A route up the Karkah River to Kermanshah, and thence via Ilamadan to Tehran, is fairly easy in the valley of the Karkah River, but it would be difficult getting through the hills at Kermanshah, 1004, 1009. From Khanikin to Kermanshah would not be easy. There is a high pass to cross, 1018. From Hamadau to Tehran there should be no great difficulty, 1008. There is no great difficulty in constructing a rail way from Tehran to Shiraz, 1011-1015. Between Isfahan and Shiraz the ground rises about 5.200 to 8,000 feet, but the slopes are quite gradual, 1019-1023. Railway Concessions in Southern Persia. The construction of a railway from Mohammerah to Shiraz would be very difficult, owing to the hills west of Shiraz, 1003.Sik W. Lee-Warner, K.C.S.I. Ill Evidence of Sir W. LEE-WARNER, K.C.S.I. Political Considerations. One danger we have to avoid is international complications inside the Gulf, 1035. Great importance is attached to the Persian Gulf from an Indian point of view—strategically, owing to its proximity to Karachi, and commercially, owing to the large trade with the Gulf, 1055, 1056. It is a trade in which money is made by leading influential natives, 1071. The holy places, such as Kerbela, give additional importance. India’s heart goes out to Persia, 1071. Politically, the predominance in trade of a foreign flag in the Gulf would be weakening to India, 1069. It is a very serious Indian interest that the trade should not pass under a foreign hag, 1070. We should make every effort to save the trade, 1072. Shipping and Trade in the Gulf. The rich native merchants in Bombay finance the pearl trade, 1059. Most of the Delhi pearls, and those of the great Maharajahs, come from the Gulf, 1062. India sends cotton goods, and could send more, to the Gulf. 1064. The British India Company carries this trade, which is very important, 1066. The Hamburg-Amerika Line has entered the Persian Gulf trade, 1067. One would be afraid that the German trade would be subsidized, and that it would not be fair competi tion, 1068, 1080. BAHREIN. We have an absolute right to maintain our protectorate and declare it, 1034. One danger to avoid is international complications in the Gulf, which would centre on the pearl fisheries, 1035. Bahrein is opposite the country we must watch— from Ujair to Odeid and the El Katr coast—which we have not recognized as under Turkish protec torate, though there is a Turkish garrison, 1035. YVe ought at once to make our arrangements for jurisdiction over foreigners, 1035. MUSCAT. Arms Traffic and Control of Customs. Muscat w’as always regarded by the Indian Government as the key to our predominant position in the Persian Gulf, 1028. In very early times the Indian Government estab lished this predominance, 1028. What started us there was the fear of France. The Treaties of 1798 with Muscat excluded France, 1075. The Agreement of 1862, by which England and France jointly guaranteed the independence of Muscat, was a blow to our position, 10i8. Nevertheless, the Indian Government continued to work up an influence independently of France, 1028. The recent demand by France for a coaling station at Bunder Gisseh, and the subsequent admission on our part that the Musandim promontory from Ras Dibba to Tibba is Muscat territory, and not part of the Pirate Coast as previously assumed, dealt a further blow at our predominance, 1028-1032. Our position in the Gulf vitall}' depends on our freedom of action to put up telegraph stations, obtain leases, hoist our flag, or obtain Concessions in the important ports of the Musandim promontory, 1029-1032. We are now forced to act there as if France were in the same position as ourselves, 1032. We ought to have a telegraph station on Sheeps Island or somewhere near Musandim, 1050. It would be valuable in case of trouble hereafter, would cost very little, and we are entitled to it under an Agreement providing for telegraphs, 1050. Had our hands been free we ought to have obtained rights over Elphinstone Inlet, Malcolm Inlet, Khor Kawi, or whichever is the best port, so that no Power could step in wi.hout infringing them. 1050. Ttie climate of Cape Musandim is very bad, 1051. Our Agreement with France is a sufficient guarantee that no one else will go to Musandim, 1075. For the moment no further action is necessary, 1076. MISCELLANEOUS. Salaries of Foreign Office Consuls and Indian Government Agent*. — L'he Indian Government compare the salaries of their Agents with those of officers in the same Department serving in other parts of India, 1038. There is a scale of pay for military officers in political employ which is higher than that of officers serving in England under different conditions, 1039. It is a matter of arrangement with the Foreign Office whether a Foreign Office or Indian Representa tive is appointed at each place, 1048. This arrangement does not work well, 1049. Bassidu and Henjam. —We have none of the em barrassment of an Agreement with France or any other Pow'er on the north side of the Gulf, 1052. At Henjam we have a telegraph station, the limits of which are undefined; but we have the best part where the water supply is, 1053. We should try and extend our acquisitions in Henjam and prevent the Persians from charging the Arab settlers against the Persians, 1053. We should maintain the status quo, 1053. Mohammerah .—It is important to keep such direct hold as we have. \\ r e have told the Sheikh that so long as he behaves properly he can rely on our good offices, 1054. Evidence of Colonel C. E. YATE, C.S.I., C.M.G. Baghdad Railway and Railway Concessions in Mesopotamia. From the point of view of India theie is nothing advantageous in the Baghdad Railway at. all, 1095. If it resulted in a large increase of trade, that would benefit India, 1116. [376] If it cannot be prevented, it is essential for us to- obtain control of the Baghdad—K Irani kin branch, so as to secure equality of treatment for British imports with Russian imports when the Baghdad Railway is made, 1087, 1089, 1123. We should come to an agreement with Russia, by which they would construct and control a railway 2 a112 Colonel C. E. Yate, C.S.I., C.M.G. through Persia to Kasr-i-Shirin, and in return we should ask them to support our claim, in the event of the Baghdad Railway being made, to construct and control a line from the head of the Persian Gulf to Baghdad and Khanikin, 10tf8, 1132. The Russian line has to pass through the neutral zone between Kermanshah and Kasr-i-Shirin, and we should make use of this to bring Russia into agreement with us, 1133-1137. If we give financial or political assistance towards the construction of the Baghdad Railway we ought to get command of the railway from a point above Baghdad, where the irrigation canals will take off from the river, 1094. It is not sufficient for us to control the line from Baghdad to the Persian Gulf only. Our position in Baghdad is so important that we should command all sides of that city, 1121. We should then have something in hand to nego tiate with Germany and Russia, 1122. The labour supply in Mesopotamia is insufficient, and, owing to the heat, European labour cannot be used, 1096, 1097. Consequently Indian labour must be employed, as in Uganda, both for the railway and irrigation works, 1098, 1100. No Government could make the railway from Mosul to the Persian Gulf so cheaply or so well as the Indian Government, 1&lt;&gt;97. Lower Mesopotamia is a promising field for the employment of Indian labour, 1099-1101. Railway Concessions in Northern Persia. We should counterbalance the Baghdad Railway by opening up the Karun Valley, 1111, 1115. We should lose no time in enforcing our Concession for a road from Ahwaz to Burujird, 1125. We should instruct the Resident of Bushireto enter into negotiations with the tribes for the construction of this road, as in the case of the Bakhtiari road, 1124. We should make the road first, as we have the Concession, and afterwards we might carry the railway through. Burujird is in the Russian sphere, so that at present we cannot make the railway, but we can, at any rate, make the road, 1126. We should also obtain a Concession for a railway combined with a Concession for irrigation up the Karun Valley from Mohammerah or Ahwaz to Dizful, so as to forestall any one else, 1125. This would put a spoke in tho wheel of the Baghdad Railway, 1127. If we could link up this line v/ith the Russian railways we should oust the Baghdad Railway altogether, 1129. Railway Concessions in Southern Persia. In Eastern Persia no railway would pay. The cost of a railway from Bushire to Shiraz is prohibitive, 1130. MUSCAT. Arms Traffic and Control of Customs. A firmer assertion of our position in Muscat is the greatest aim we can have. We have lost two oppor tunities of getting free of the engagements that trouble us at Muscat, viz., after the Treaty of 1862, when we guaranteed the independence of Muscat jointly with France, and during the recent Anglo- French Agreement, 1103. If we could come to terms with France we could abolish the arms traffic, 1104. The only effective plan is to induce the Sultan to formally, perhaps by joint note to England and France, exempt arms and ammunition from the operation of the Treaties, 1104. The arms traffic is most dangerous to India because the Afridis and frontier tribes get not only Martinis but Lee-Metfords. 1105. The rifles are conveyed in dhows to the different ports in Baluchistan, It is no longer possible to keep order in Persian Baluchistan and that adds to our difficulties in British Baluchistan, 1107. The arms question is very serious to Persia and British Baluchistan, 1107.113 DIGEST OF EVIDENCE BY SUBJECTS. [Note. The Numbers given refer to Questions and Answers.^ EVIDENCE:— Political Considerations. Mr. F. C. Stride :— The reason the Germans have recently taken an interest in the Persian Gulf is probably not com mercial but political—to secure a status there, 389-393. Possibly it might be due to their foreseeing that ultimately the trade would become very im portant, and a consequent desire to get a footing before the development occurs, 395. Mr. F. Thomas :— The Anglo-Russian Convention has given away our trade to Russia, 688; the cargt» that goes to Baghdad finds its way through Khanikin to Hamadan and Northern Persia, and as this has been placed in the Russian sphere, the Russians are in a position to place duties against our merchandise in favour of British or Russian goods brought by Russian transport from Trebizond, 689-692, 797. Mr. G. Lloyd :— German competition is already serious, and is going to be very serious, 803. Its object is politically connected with Cerman Islamic policy, to create an interest, 804, 805. Mr. Wonckhaus is an ordinary trader. 809; he is probably subsidized, 810. The object of the German Government in encouraging him is to have a vested political interest in the Gulf, 811. In Mesopotamia, if a country is commercially pre dominant, it will be politically predominant also, 851. If we let any Power come into Mesopotamia south of Baghdad, and cut across the line from Baghdad to Khanikin, we may say good-bye to our position in the Gulf, 872. The loss of our commercial position in the Gulf would have a serious effect on our prestige in India, 877. The Germans have felt our political position in the Gulf, and have now wisely determined to attack us commercially through cheap trades, as they have done successfully in other parts of the East, and to have interests in the Gulf, where they had none. Wherever they can they make rate agree ments with British Companies and underquote them systematically, and then we are surprised to find our markets going. Our markets do go as regards cheap trade. Manchester trade is maintained, but there are signs that it is not safe. That is why our communications are important in the Gulf, and inadequate unless we do something to strengthen them, and bring the Germans to better terms with us, 872. Mr. H. F. B. Lynch :— To control the head of the Persian Gulf the Islands of Kishm, TIenjam. and Larak should be included in the British sphere. By drawing the line de limitating the British sphere from Lingah a fruitful ground for diplomatic difficulties would have been avoided, 902. The British Government should strengthen their hold in the Persian Gulf by pursuing their present policy even more strenuously, by lighting, buoy ing, and policing the Gulf, 923 The idea that British goods will be allowed to pass freely into the Russian sphere in Persia is erroneous. On their railways the Russians will introduce their zone system, and on their roads transport difficulties 'ill be raised. 935. We should develop our existing Concessions in Persia, and develop the neutral zone, 937. Roads should be built rather than railways, 938. Sir W. Lee- Warner :— One danger we have to avoid is international com plications inside the Gulf, 1035. Great importance is attached to the Persian Gulf from an Indian point of view, strategically, owing to its proximity to Karachi, and com mercially, owing to the large trade with the Gulf, 1055, 1056. It is a trade in which money is made by leading influential natives, 1071. The holy places, such as Kerbela, give additional importance. India’s heart goes out to Persia, 1071. Politically, tin. predominance in trade of a foreign flag in the Gulf would be weakening to India, 1069. It is a very serious Indian interest that the trade should not pass under a foreign flag, 1070. We should make every effort to save the trade, 1072. Shipping and Trade in the Persian Gulf. Sir J. Mackatf: — The bulk of the trade in the Persian Gulf is carried in British ships, 112. The lines running to the Persian Gulf are: The British India with a subsidized fast mail and subsidiary weekly services to Basra, carrying British merchandise by transhipment from Bombay and Karachi, as well as Indian goods; the Anglo-Algerian Company (Messrs. F. Strick114 Shipping and Trade in the Persian Gulf. and Co.). Bucknall Brothers, and the West Hartlepool Company, which between them carry 90 per cent, of the trade with London ; Messrs. Andrew Weir, who charter occasional steamers for homeward cargo; the Hamburg-Amerika Line (for details see separate heading); a Russian line from the Black Sea sending two or three steamers a year; also a small native company running occasionally from Bombay to Basra. Steamers from Europe call at Marseilles, Port Said, Port Sudan Djiboutil, Aden, Muscat, Bunder Abbas, Bahrein, Bushire. and Basra, the principal port of discharge. The greater part of the homeward cargo comes to the United Kingdom, 114, Steamers from Bombay call at all ports in the Gulf, outward and homeward, and carry many native passengers, mainly traders and pearl dealers, as well as Arab horses, 114, 115. There is a very large traffic between India and the Gulf; it is largest between October and May, 115. Trade out and home goes on all the year, but is braest between October and May, 115. The recent increase of shipping in the Persian Gulf is probably due to the doubling of the British India Company’s services by contract with the Indian Government, and does not necessarily imply a great increase in trade. 222. Mr. F. C. Stride:— Strick’s line has been established twenty years, 242. Starting from small beginnings, it has grown gradually, 261, 262. There are now about twenty steamers with an aggregate of about 100,000 tons, 255, 256. The service to the Persian Gulf is monthly, under a pooling arrangement with Bucknall Brothers, which lasts for twelve months, 257 ; the West Hartlepool Company also having a small share, 260 ; but no voice in fhe question of rates, 372- 374. The ships principally proceed from Manchester and London, calling at Marseilles and Djiboutil, to the Persian Gulf, 243; where they touch at Lingah, Bunder Abbas, Bushire, and Basra, the port of discharge, whence they then usually proceed direct to London or the Contineut, 244 ; calling sometimes at Marseilles, 245. Goods for Bahrein are transhipped at Bushire. 343. The bulk of the goods from England are Man chester goods, 809. The Manchester shippers are bound to the British lines by contract. A new contract with all the principal shippers commences next year, 336. This secures the trade, 338. From Marseilles and Antwerp a lot of sugar is shipped, 310. The Antwerp trade would not justify a steamer once a month, 311. When short of export cargo, ships fill with coal at Cardiff for bunkering steamers in the Gulf, 313, 314. German coal has been tried there, but without success, not being equal to Cardiff coal, 315, 316. The produce of the Gulf is becoming’ more generally known in England, and English millers take a good deal of the grain, which is cheaper than Black Sea grain, 304, 305. Besides grain, liquorice root and dates (for two months in the year) are brought from the Gulf; three cargoes of dates are taken every year to New York direct, 369-371. The Indian trade is in the hands of the British India Company, 376. The British India Company take very little cargo from England by transhipment at Bombay, because they have more Indian cargo than they can carry, 377-380. Occasionally, if short of cargo from the Persian Gulf, the ehips of the British combine call at Karachi, but generally speaking they have left the trade alone since the fight between the Hansa Line and the P. and 0., 246, 247. Mr. E. Lloyd :— None of Bucknall’s steamers are definitely ear marked for the Persian Gulf trade, though two are more or less regularly in it, which are supplemented as required, 464. In the Persian Gulf Bucknall’s work in conjunction with Frank Strick and Co., running alternate steamers against the undesirable opposition of the Hamburg-Amerika Line. 419. Their cargoes are similar to those of Strick, cotton from Manchester and sugar from Marseilles being the principal articles of export, 427-429. The trade has grown considerably within the last ten years, 460. Bucknall’s have no regular Indian trade in con nection with the Persian Gulf line, but ships with insufficient cargo from the Gulf sometimes go to India to load up, 425. Mr. P. 'Thomas :— Bucknall’s Persian Gulf line was inaugurated in 1897, 657-658. It has grown from one to about twenty steamers a-year, 659. Cargo was originally sent by Bombay, but Bucknall’s established a direct service to the Gulf, 661. Buck nail’s form a combine with Messrs. Strick, 678. Steamers run from Manchester to the Thames, and thence to the Gulf via Marseilles, 662; where they pick up sugar, and where the St Louis Company have given the combine a contract for seven years rather than accept the German terms, 683. The ships are of 4,000 to 5,000 tons dead weight, 664 ; and are of this small size in order to cross the bar of the Shat-el-Arab, where the spring tides give 16 to 18 feet of water, 664, 665. In addition to the combine the British India mail- boats go to the Gulf every week with 1,400 to 1,500 tons of cargo, rhey are dependent for profits on the mail subvention, 674-676. The Russians .^end three steamers a-year, 666; and the Austrians two a-year, one in the date season (September and October) and one for other cargo, 668. Mr. H. F. B. Lynch. The export trade has fallen very largely into the hands of the natives, 879. The import trade is brought by British lines to Basra, then by river steamers to Baghdad, and thence by the Khanikin trade route into Persia, 888-890. The trade of Mesopotamia amounts to about 3£ millions sterling a-year, mainly British and Indian, including also sugar from Marseilles, 913. German merchandise is a very email matter, 919- 920. There is a monthly service of German steamers to the Gulf, 919. Sir W Lee-Warner :— The rich native merchants in Bombay finance the pearl trade, 1059. Most of the Delhi pearls, and those of the great Maharajahs, come from the Gulf, 1062. India sends cotton goods, and could send more, to the Gulf, 1064. The British India Company carries this trade, which is very important, 1066.Shipping and Iiiade in the Persian Gulf—The Hambuhg-Amerika Line. 115 The Hamburg-Amerika Line has entered the Persian Gulf trade, 10G7. One would be afraid that the German trade would be subsidized, and that it would not be fair com petition, 10G8, 1080. The Hamburg-Amerika Line. Sir J. Mackay :— The Hamburg—Amerika Line send about one steamer a-month to the Persian Gulf with a little outward cargo from Hamburg or Antwerp, though a fair quantity of homeward cargo is brought entirely for the continent. They do not call at English ports, 114. They must have lost from 3,000/. to 5,000/. a voyage, or from 30,000/. to 50,000/. a-year, 116, 117. 1 heir entry into the Gulf was not a commercial speculation. 118; the trade is not worth it, 1G7. Their intention was probably to establish a claim to the Gulf trade in view of the ultimate com pletion of the Baghdad Railway to Basra or Koweit, when the German railway would feed German ships, 128. They are *• pegging out a claim,” 129, 130,163,170, 172. They have probably a subsidy, but it does not appear in their accounts, 163. The subsidy may be indirect. The continuance of the Persian Gulf line may be one of the condi tions of the mail subsidies t &gt; their other lines, 164, 165. If supported by the German Government the Hamburg—Amerika Line will eventually drive British shipping from the Gulf, 127-130. There is not much to object to in a rate agreement between the British Companies and the Hamburg— Amerika Line, 122. A combine of this character should not lead to a transfer to the German flag, 239. Possibly the reason for approaching the British lines is that the subsidy from the German Government was for a few years only, and has expired, 177 ; the reason is probably commercial, 193. The British India Company has not suffered from German competition, 119; and is not affected by Herr Ballin’s proposals to the English lines, 142. The Hamburg-Amerika Line have told the British India that they have no intention of entering the Bombay trade, and that their sole object is to carry on trade between Basra and Europe, 158. This is done possibly to secure their neutrality for the moment, 159. If the Ilamburg-Amerika Line acquired a monopoly of the European trade they would probably eventually run a line from the terminus of the Baghdad Railway to Bombay, and would endeavour to make a rate agreement with the British India Company, 144. If the whole of the British shipping in the Gulf were replaced by German shipping it would not make much difference to Indian trade, though it would be important politically, 147-150. Seventy-five per cent, of the Indian trade in the Gulf is with Mesopotamia, which is the objective of German competition, 155-157. Mr. F. C. Strick :— The Hamburg-Amerika Line commenced running fifteen months ago, 266. Their ships are principally old 3,000-ton boats, running once a month from Hamburg and Antwerp to the Gulf, calling at Marseilles, but at no British port. 281. 'They only get small cargoes of sugar from Antwerp, and scarcely any from Marseilles, [37 0] where the British lines have a contract for four years ahead, 286. Formerly the sugar from Antwerp was I r night to London for transhipment, out when the Ham burg Amerika Line commenced calling at Antwerp the shippers gave them the preference, and the British lines now put in and bid against them every month, 284. Hie Hamburg—Amerika Line import barley and paddy to Germany, 333-335. They have been cutting rates all round, outwards and homewards, 270, 397. Their rates are lower than the British rates, 407. They are now anxious to come to a rate agree ment, and recently Herr Ballin approached Mr. Lloyd, of Bucknalls. on the subject, 273. Herr Ballin wanted at first to pool the trade, stating that they would be content with a quarter of the trade, but. as that was declined, he suggested a rate agreement, 275, 276. The object of these proposals is to get a share of the trade with England, where there is a better market for Persian Gulf produce than in Ger many, 295. Already the Hamburg-Amerika Line get a small quantity of Manchester goods, carried from Liverpool to Hamburg and there transhipped, 327 • The Persian Gulf branch does not pay the Ilam- burg-Ameiika Company, 285. The line is undoubtedly subsidized, 290. There is no proof of this, 293. Herr Ballin stated that it was a “philanthropic line,” and that he was “bound to go there,” 287-2b9. So long as the Hamburg-Amerika Line confines its operations to the continental trade the British lines have the advantage, but if they came to London it would be another matter, and there would be a direct fight, 318, 408. Mr. E. Lloyd :— The Hamburg-Amerika Line have taken cargo from the British lines and have brought down rates of freight, 421. They send one steamer a month of about 4,000 tons, say 50,000 tons for the year. Owing to this competition the British lines have had occasional!} to send steamers to India to load home, 425. Hamburg is now a centre of direct import for Persian Gulf produce, which formerly came by transhipment from London, 444. The Hamburg-Amerika Line have not as yet made any direct attack on British trade in the Gulf, but have taken goods from Manchester to the Gulf by transhipment at Hamburg, 448; these goods being taken to Hamburg by the Currie Line, 798. The Hamburg-Amerika Line stand well with the German Government, and probably receive both moral and financial support, 4*8. Without Government aid their Persian Gulf line could not hold its head above w^ater, 4 30, 431. Herr Ballin spoke of it as “a philanthropic side of the Ilamburg-Amerika operations.” meaning that he could make no profits, and hoped for no pro fits, in the trade, 432, 433. He described it as a “political ’ line, meaning that it is directed by some force behind, 434, 435; presumably directed towards the development of German commerce in that quarter of the globe 436. It perhaps forms part of the same programme as the Baghdad Railway; the shipping might be viewed as running parallel with the competition of that railway, 437. Herr Ballin resented the interference of the British lines, and stated that his Company had stepped 2 H116 The Hamburg-Amerika Line—Government Subsidies and Assistance. upon the scene to develop German trade and German connections, 457. British lines are at present holding their own against the Hamburg-^, merika Line, and can do so as long as they don't mind losses, 4-tO. Eventually either the Ilamburg-Amerika Line must withdraw or come to an agreement with the British lines, 441. Such an agreement would not affect t he Manchester goods trade, as the Germans do not compete in this line, but it would be injurious to the British hardware trade. 443, 444. The profits made by the Hamburg-Amerika Line the year before last were largely due to the Russo-Japanese War, 4‘JO. Mr. P. Thomas :— The ITamburg-Arnerika Line started nineteen months ago, and have sent on an average one steamer a month, 6(59. Their loss is estimated at 30.000/. to 40,000/. a-year, 670. Heir Ballin has stated that the loss is not for their account, 671-673. They entered the Gulf for political reasons, 722; to enable Germany to assert a stake in the Gulf, 727. The British combine could run for the next seven years without loss owing to contracts, but the Hamburg-\merika Line is disorganizing, 779. If the Ilamburg-Amerika Line came to Liverpool and Manchester, the British lines would have to lower their rates, 793; and it would be very hard to compete with them if still supported by the German Government. 794. There is no room for both, 780. There are 5,000 tons of grain in warehouse at Hamburg, which they have not been able to sell, 785. They have taken away some of the Antwerp trade from the British lines, 786; but cannot cut in as regards the export cargo, 788. The Germans, through the instrumentality of a man named Wbnckhaus, have secured the shell trade, but it is only a deck trade, and should be left to them, 789-792. Mr. G. Lloyd :— Herr Ballin has approached the British shipping lines in the Gulf with proposals for a rate agree ment, 813, 814. The danger of a rate agreement is that it is impossible to detect when the German firms underquote the minimum rate, owing to the fact that they quote through rates from an inland town in Germany to an inland town in the country of destination, and it is impossible to determine what portion of the through rates goes to the ships; this is not yet understood by our Shipping Companies, 815, 819. That system is very likely to be extended over the Oriental railways through Asia Minor, 817. The result of a rate agreement would be to transfer a great deal of trade to Germany, as has already happened in the Levant trade, 818. If there is a rate agreement British trade will disappear in seven years or so, 825. Government Subsidies and Assistance. Sir J. Mackay :— The claim for a subsidy to the British lines is that it would be given not for commercial but for political reasons, to enable them to fight the Germans with their own weapons, 174, 175 ; and to protect our trade against subsidized rivals, 227. By enabling British shipping to hold its own for a year or two it might be possible to stop the Germans from continuing to run, 179 ; or to ascertain whether they mean business, 181. The British India Line would not complain if a subsidy were given to the English lines, as they would then have a case for a subsidy to British East Africa, 238. In no case is a subsidy given to a line from the United Kingdom or India to a foreign port, such as Basra, except for mail purposes, 131. There is no case for a mail subsidy for British ships going to the Persian Gulf, 235, 236. The mail at present reaches Basra via Bombay in nineteen days. A steamer could not proceed direct through the Suez Canal in that, time, 237. India ought not to contribute towards subsidizing a shipping line from the United Kingdom to the Gulf, as she already does her share in subsidizing two lines from Bombay and Karachi, 135, 145, 146, 153, 154. Mr. F. C Strick :— The British lines trading direct with the Gulf could carry the mails quicker than the British India Company, 384. Mr. P. Thomas :— The British shipping combine have lacked assistance from the British Government, 685; which might have prevented the Customs maladministration in Persia and Turkey, 686. When approached, the Government shrugs its shoulders, for fear of international complica tions, 687. Assistance does not necessarily mean a subsidy, 733. It might be given by sending Government cargo to the Gulf or Aden by the British lines, instead of putting it up to competition, and so cutting down rates, 732. The mail should go from Basra in British ships to Suez or Aden instead of via Bombay, 677, 678, 746-748 ; reducing the time from three weeks to fourteen days. 718, 749 : especially as the Gulf trade with India is small as compared with the United Kingdom, 678. The British India Line, which at present carries the mails, is dependent on the Government subvention, 674-676. Mr. G. Lloyd Some form of assistance to enable the British Companies to continue the fight with the Hamburg-Amerika Line is desirable, 826. A study of the Ilamburg-Amerika balance sheet indicates that it is a favourable time for us to continue warfare, and not to make arrangements with them, 826. No subsidy can be detected ih the Hamburg- Amerika balance sheet, 862. The subsidy is said to be paid through the Emperor; but theie are different ways of doing it, 863. The trade is subsidized over the German State Railways, 863. The British Companies could not beat them off without assistance, 827. At present the Persian Gulf trade is purely a Manchester trade, and if this is driven out by Indian and Japanese competition, which is probable, our trade goes. By continuing the fight we should enable manufacturers to develop a trade in cheap articles, 827-899 ; such as hardware, machinery, agricultural implements, &amp;c., as the Germans are already doing most effectively, 827. The Germans have akeady taken the hardware trade from us, 857. We can do more trade than we are now doing, 859.Navigation on the Tigris, &amp;c. —Lighterage—Lights, Lighthouses, &amp;c. 117 Navigation on the Tigris, Euphrates, and Karun. Mr. P. Thomas :— Goorks could be carried on the river at less freight than it would pay a railway to run, 762. Messrs. Lynch have a right to have two steamers on the river, with one in reserve. The Turks have seven steamers, and are building two, 767. If Great Britain had six steamers, they could beat the German railway rates on the Tigris, but not on the Euphrates. 768. Steamers could not run above Baghdad to Mosul all the year, as the river is a torrent for part of the year, 770. Nothing but. stern-wheelers would do. 774. Mr. H. F. B. Lynch :— The Tigris steamers carry European and Indian goods, mainly piece-goods and sugar, from Basra to Baghdad, taking three or four davs, 881-884. There are six Turkish steamers, and two more are being sent out, 994. They take the greater part of the cargo, 915. If the Germans got control of the Turkish steamers, as well as of the Baghdad Railway, Lynch Brothers would be driven out. 976-978. The best way to increase British and Indian trade with Mesopotamia would be to render the course of the Euphrates navigable by larger steamers, and to irrigate the country and so attract a larger population, 913. The dimensions of the present steamers are:— length 210 feet, breadth 40 feet, draught from 2 ft. 6 in. to 4 ft. 6 in., 958, 959. The obstacles to navigation are the sharp bends in the river, and its snallowness for seven months in the year, 961. In Mesopotamia navigation should not be entirely sacrificed to irrigation, 973. Lynch Brothers have a separate service up the Karun from Mohammerah, 900, 979. There is a Persian steamer also, 980. The Karun river traffic does not pay, 982. If the road from Ahwaz to Sultanabad is con structed, the river traffic ought to increase, 982, 983. Lighterage. Mr. F. C. Stride :— There are only 18 feet of water on the bar of the Shat-el-Arab, and some of the steamers draw 21 feet; there are one or two old steamers out there used for lighterage, 329. Mr. E. Lloyd :— At Bushire the landing facilities are unsatisfactory. Bucknalls had a scheme for forming a landing Company there, but it failed owing to local jealousies, 483,484. At Basra, where there are only 17 feet of water on the bar, Bucknalls keep a steam tighter of 1,400 tons, which relieves heavy-draught steamers of their cargo, 502, 503. As the draught of ocean-going ships is too great to cross the bar, it is essential to have a certain amount of lighterage in connection with the Persian Gulf trade, 503, 504. Mr. P. Thomas :— A pier with a “bund” is required at Bushire, 718. Mr. G. Lloyd :— Lighterage is one of the most important require ments in the Gulf, 830. Bushire and Bahrein are the most important places, and in a lesser degree Basra or Dayir, 842. At present the lighterage at Persian ports is in the hands of the hamieldash, who farms it from the Persian Government, and levies an unjust and arbitrary toll on all goods, and sends out lighters to ships or not according to the bribe given him, 832 One of, or all of, the British Shipping Companies in the Gulf might take it up and find it re munerative, 831, 870. To obtain the Concession it might be necessary to use force, though it would require very little, 832. Probably it could be obtained by paying the hamieldash more than he at present gets, 837, 838. The British Agent should receive instructions to negotiate, 841. Lights, Lighthouses, and Buoys. Sir J. Mackay :— All steamers using the Gulf would be glad to pay light dues, as there are at present no lights at all. Light dues should give a fair interest on capital and provide a sinking fund, 135, 136. The British India Company maintains buoys in the Persian Gulf, 130; a few' years ago an offer from the Hamburg-Amerika Company to share the cost was declined, 130. Mr. h. C. Strick :— The Persian Gulf is badly lighted, 342. There is no real demand for a lighthouse, 345-347. It would be worth while to buoy the bar of the 8hat-el-Arab, as the navigation is very difficult, and the bar is always shifting, 348-352. Mr. E. Lloyd :— The^lighting in the Persian Gulf is not satisfactory, 473; but it would not be worth while paying light dues to have it improved, 474,475. Something might be done to improve the buoys, 476 ; but dues should be levied on the g’oods by the local authorities and not on the ships, owing to the small extent of the shipping, 477-482. Mr. P. Thomas :— There is not a buoy at Bahrein, 736; the British Government should buoy the channels there 740. The Turks should be made to buoy the Shat-el- Arab, paying the cost from the charges levied for the use of “ seats ” or wharf warehouses at Basra, 740. Buoys are essential here, 750. There is not a single lighthouse in the Persian Gulf, 753. About three are required at economically necessary points, 754. The Turkish Government should pay for them out of the duties they impose, 756. The shipping might expect to pay a fair share of the cost in light dues, but would like to be con sulted first. I he lurks should not be allowed to impose dues, 758. Mr. G. Lloyd:— Tbenighting of the Persian Gulf is very important,118 Quarantine—The Baghdad Railway and Railway Concessions. Quarantine. Mr. E. Lloyd :— Occasionally there is trouble about quarantine, 494. When the local authorities imagine there is plague on board, the ship is told to lie off. There is no redress nor appeal. Ships lie there until some body can get ashore with stronger influence, when the plague is got rid of very easily, 495, 496. Mr. P. Thomas :— Unauthorized quarantine is often imposed, and it is sometimes necessary to pay 50/. to come ont of it, 719. Mr. H. F. B. Lynch : — Absurd quarantine regulations, but no deliberate . obstruction, 967. The Baghdad Railway and Railway Con cessions in Mesopotamia. Sir J. Mackai/ :— The Baghdad Railway is a matter of intimate concern to India, 147. The increase in trade will be tremendous when the railway is made into Mesopotamia, 233. Mr. F. C. Stric/c :— The trade in Manchester goods would not be seriously affected by the Baghdad Railway being brought to the Gulf, 357-365. The grain trade of Mesopotamia would be developed, which would improve the return cargo, 250, 366. 388. It would tempt the competition of German steamers, 251. The fact of the line being virtually German would increase the amount of cargo, principally grain, which they would bring home, 252, 254. Mr. E. Lloyd :— The Baghdad Railway would probably be in jurious, 438, 439. If Germany controlled the railway, special terms would probably be granted, as on German State Railways, which would be detrimental to British shipping here, as in East Africa and the Levant, 469, 470. A German railway would develop trade to the exclusion of British shipping, owing to special preferential through rates, If equal terms were granted to British traders it would be beneficial to British shipping, 471, 472. Sir L. Dane : — From an Indian military point of view the Baghdad Railway is undesirable, 524. India has to fear first an extension of the Baghdad Railway through Persia to the Afghan and Baluchi frontiers, though the difficulties of the route renders this unlikely for some years, and, secondly, the formation of a port, nominally commercial, at the head of 1 he Gulf, which would attract foreign squadrons, and lead to a demand for an increase of British naval strength in these waters, 525; and a demand on the Indian Government for an increase of their subsidy to the Navy, 525, 526 Indian military opinion is opposed to linking up the Baghdad Railway with the Indian railway system, 523, 544. Civil opinion in India would welcome such an arrangement, 543. Mr. P. Thomas :— The Baghdad Railway will not be completed unless England completes it, 693 : and could not pay in competition with water transport, 694. Railways here would not pay, except a short one from Baghdad t'» Kerbela, to take the pilgrim traffic, 695. The Baghdad Railway would increase German influence politically on the break-up of Turkey, but would have no effect on trade, 698. We should obtain the privilege of a settlement at Kurna, the point of confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates, 6t*5 ; which would form the terminus of water-borne goods, 700. A Concession should be obtained for a railway from Kurna through Amara and Kerbela to Baghdad, 695, 702; a distance of 220 miles, 707 ; without gradient, 707 , tapping the Tigris and Euphrates, 768 ; and traversing a magnificent wheat country, 696; with canals already in existence. 695, 709; and only requiring the ends to be opened for irrigation, 695 This would be one of the richest lines in the world, 695 ; and this, not the Baghdad Railway, is what Germany wants, 702-704. Mr. G. Lloyd :— If the Baghdad Railway were completed entirely in German hands there would be an extension of the through rate (see “ The Hamburg-Amerika Line”), 821, 822, Goods could not go from Europe to Mesopotamia by the Baghdad Railway, as land-carriage could not compete with water-carriage unless heavily subsidized, 823. The Germans would not subsidize the Ilamburg- Amerika Line ami the Baghdad Railway simul taneously^, 824. There could be no possibility of a railway from Mohammerah to Kurna. There is no object in it, as it would have to compete with river traffic, 847, 848. To build a line from Baghdad to Mohammerah would involve the difficulty of its being in Persian territory, the present Concession for the Baghdad Railway being a line on the right bank of the river, 849. Koweit is probably the best terminus for the Baghdad Railway on the Persian Gulf. Um Kasr is unlikely. Basra is the most likely terminus, now that Koweit is improbable. It is not likely that the railway will be built beyond Baghdad for a time. But the Germans would be anxious to get to the head of the Gulf eventually, and their Concession would enable them to charge foreign shipping any dues they like, 853. There are many ways in which they could evade a most-favoured-nation clause, 854. The line between Kerbela and Khanikin is probably the most important part of the Baghdad Rail way, and should repay the capital outlay in two years, or even in one, 850. It is most important to British interests, 850; owing to the pilgrim traffic, 851. Now that the important towns in Central Persia, the objectives of our caravans, are in the Russian zone, it is of paramount importance for us to maintain our rights on the Khanikin road as far as the Persian frontier, the great preponderance of trade on this road being British, 851. In any other hands it would prove very detrimeutal to us, 850.Baghdad Railway, &amp;c.—Railway Concessions in Northern Persia. 119 The important thing is that the British make the line to Khanikin. If built from Baghdad, we would find the Germans in our path, and there would be difficulties; bnt we could make a very good case for a line from a point slightly below Baghdad to Khanikiu, 852. Mr. IT. F. B. Lynch :— The main effect of the Baghdad Railway would be to open up the countries served to the markets of Central Kurope, 885, 886. It will ultimately connect with the European railway system by a bridge over the Bosphorus, 886. The railway would not compete against transport by sea, but, subsidized by kilometric guarantees as against river transport, goo^s would be carried for practically nothing, and the resulting com- perition from Central Europe would fall on British goods. 886, 893. The objections to the Baghdad Railway are:— First, its injurious effect on Turkish finances, 909. Second, irrigation ought to precede railway con struction, 910, 911. Third, its connection with the Iledjaz Railway at Killis renders it a strategical menace to Egypt, 912. Fourth, the injurious results to British trade from Central European competition, 913. Fifth, if linked up with the Russian railways, the Turkish main strategical position at Erzinjan, in Asia Minor, could be taken in flank by Russian troops sent into Northern Mesopotamia, 914. It i* not a British interest that the Baghdad Rail way should be built. It can only be built with British assistance. Money for this purpose can oidy be raised on the security of the Turkish ceded revenues, on which England has a hold, since, if England refused consent to the extra 3 per cent, customs duties, Turkey could not pay the army in Macedonia, 924. If the railway must be built, Germany should not have control beyond Killis. The sections from Killis to the Persian Gulf and from Killis to Aleppo should be under British or Anglo-French control, 924. The present projected route from Killis to the Persian Gulf would have to be heavily policed between Killis and Mosul. A better route would be to follow the Euphrates, with a branch to Baghdad and Mosul. 924. A railway from Baghdad to Khanikin and Persia would not affect British trade in any way, 895- 897 - This railway is the only one in these regions which would pay without a kilometric guarantee. 898. It would open up the fine grain-growing district of Hamadan, would take the pilgrim traffic to Kerbela, and carry all the trade up the trade route, 899. Colonel C. E. Fate :— From the point of view of India there is nothing advantageous in the Baghdad Railway at all, 1095. If it resulted in a large increase of trade that would benefit India, 1116. If it cannot be prevented it is essential for us to obtain control of the Baghdad-Khanikin branch, so as to secure equality of treatment for British imports with Russian imports, when the Baghdad Railway is made, 1087, 1089, 1123. We should come to an agreement with Russia, by which they would construct and control a rail way through Persia to Kasr-i-Shirin, and in return we should ask them to support our claim, in the event of the Baghdad Railway being made to construct and control a line from the head of the Persian Gulf to Baghdad and Khanikin, 1088, 1132. [:U&lt;»] The Russian line has to pass through the neutral zone between Kermanshah and Kasr-i-Shirin, and we should make use of this to bring Russia into agreement with us, 1133—1137. If we give financial or political assistance towards the construction ef the Baghdad Railway, we ought to get command of the railway from a point above Baghdad, where the irrigation canals will take off from the river, 1094. It is not sufficient for us to control the line from Baghdad to the Persian Gulf only. Our position in Baghdad is so important that we should com mand all sides of that city, 1121. We should th^n have something in hand to negotiate with Germany and Russia, 1122. The labour supply in Mesopotamia is insufficient, and owing to the heat European labour cannot be used, 1096, 1097. Consequently Indian labour must be employed, as in Uganda, both for the railway and irrigation works. 1098, 1100. No Government could make the railway from Mosul to the Persian Gulf so cheaply or so well as the Indian Government, 1097. Lower Mesopotamia is a promising field for the employment of Indian labour, 1099-1101. Railway Concessions in Northern Persia. Sir L. Dane :— Indian opinion would be dead against linking up the Russian and Indian railway systems, 529. Under existing conditions, India is secured by the fact that it would take Russia at least four years to lay a railway to the neighbourhood of Seistan, whereas we could make a railway from Nushki to Seistan in eighteen months, 530. If Russia were allowed to make a railway up to the limits of her zone it would bring her over the worst part of the distance separating her from India We prefer to be defended by the in hospitable wastes which Russia would have to traverse. 530, 536. The Russians should not be allowed to construct a railway south of Meshed ; no such line could be built on commercial grounds unless linked up with the Indian railways, 550. If the Russians should make a railway to the limits of their sphere the Indian Government would propose a countervailing railway in their own sphere, from Bunder Abbas to Seistan, which is a good route, but costly, and likely to yield only small returns, 566-568. This line is preferred to a railway from Nushki to Seistan as a means of holding Seistan, as, in the event of a reverse, our troops could retire along it to the sea, and still leave 430 miles of desert between the Russians and Nushki, whereas the Nushki-Seistan Railway, if constructed, would eventually facilitate their advance, 539. For the Russians the most suitable line commercially is from Kazvin to Hamadan, and thence through Kermanshah to Khanikin, which would be entirely in the Russian sphere, and would give them control of the main artery of trade from Baghdad into Northern and North-Western Persia, 550-552. This would have the disadvantage, from the Russian point of view, of acting as a feeder to the Baghdad Railway, 552. The alternative of a Russian line from Julfa through Kazvin, Tehran, and Khoramabad, joining a British line from Mohammerah, would not act as a feeder to the Baghdad Railway, but is probably impracticable owing to the ferocity of the Lurs and the difficulty of the country north of Dizful, 554, 560-562. *2 I120 Railway Concessions in Northern and in Southern Persia. It would be preferable to let the Russians build a railway to Isfahan, 1111 ^ 11 ^ up there with a British line from Shiraz, which is a practicable route; then, whether the British terminus is at Mohammerah or Bunder Abbas, the southern end would be under British control, which would allay Indian fears as to the good faith of Russia, 555, 556, 559. (See below, “ Railway Conces sions in Southern Persia,” as to details of pro posed British line from Mohammerah.) We ought to obtain as many Railway Concessions as possible west of the neutral zone, without the necessity of carrying them out, 569 ; at the same time interesting the Russians in them so as to keep them away from our frontier, 570. Mr. 11. F. B. Lynch :— Lynch Brothers have a Concession for a road from Ahwaz through Luristan to Khoramabad and Sultanabad, 942, 943. As far as Dizful there are no difficulties for railway construction, 946. Beyond that the main difficulty arises from the Lur tribes, 947. The routes through Khoramabad and Khanikin are the only two easy passages into Persia, 947. A road from Ahwaz to Khoramabad and Tehran, not passing through a Turkish custom-house, would divert a portion of the traffic by Baghdad and Khanikin. 948, 949; but would not entirely oust it owing to the large number of traders in Baghdad, 950. A railway from Mohammerah. through Ahwaz, linking up through Khoramabad and Tehran with the Russian railway at Julfa. would com pete seriously with the Baghdad Railway in passenger traffic, being a much cooler and quicker route, 952-957. Major J. A. Douglas :— The easiest route for a railway from the Persian Gulf to Northern Persia is from Ahwaz via Dizful to Khoramabad, 999, 1000. It would connect with an extension of the Russian railways from Julia via Hamadan and Burujird, 1002, 1018. The Russians have made a new road from Kazvin to Hamadan, 1002. Railway construction from Hamadan to Kazvin is not easy. Kazvin is 4,000 feet; there is a pass 7,000 feet; and on the northern side of the pass there is a very steep 4,000-feet rise. 1006. A route up the Karkah River to Kermanshah, and thence via Hamadan to Tehran, is fairly easy in the valley of the Karkah River, but it would be difficult getting through the hills at Kermanshah, 1004, 1009. From Khanikin to Kermanshah would not be easy There is a high pass to cross, 1018. From Hamadan to Tehian there should be no great difficulty, 1018. There is no great difficulty in constructing a rail way from Tehran to Shiraz, 1011-1015. Between Isfahan and Shiraz the ground rises about 5,200 to 8,000 feet, but the slopes are quite gradual, 1019-1023. Colonel C. E. Yate :— We should counterbalance the Baghdad Railway by opening up the Karun Valley, 1111, 1115. We should lose no time in enforcing our Concession for a road from Ahwaz to Buiujird, 1125. We should instruct the Resident of Bushire to enter into negotiations with the tribes for the construction of this road as in the case of the Bakhtiari road, 1124. We should make the road first, as we have the Concession, and afterwards we might carry the railway through. Buiujird is in the Russian sphere, so that at present we cannot make the railway, but we can at any rate make the road, 1126. We should also obtain a Concession for a railway, combined with a Concession for irrigation up the Karun Valley from Mohammerah or Ahwaz to Dizful, so as to forestall any one else, 1125. This would put a spoke in the wheel of the Baghdad Railway, 1127. If we could link up this line with the Russian railways, we should oust the Baghdad Railway altogether, 1129. Railway Concessions in Southern Persia. Sir L. Dane :— The existing main trade route to the interior is an almost impossible mule track from Bushire, 517, 556. A railway here is impossible without a monorail, 557. Commercially what is required is a route by which British goods can be conveyed to the Persian plateau, 517 ; preferably to Shiraz, 519; because it is &lt; ne of the most fertile portions of Persia, is in tbe neutral zone, is a good distributing centre, and is astride of any eventual extension of the Baghdad Railway into Southern or Eastern Persia, 520. Shiraz is also in communication with Isfahan by a road for wheeled vehicles, 517. A line from Bunder Abbas to Shiraz has been surveyed by Captain Wilson, and is possible, 514. A route from Mohammerah to Shiraz would be better than from Bunder Abbas, as it would not only take the present Bushire trade, but would divert a good deal of the trade from the Shat-el- Arab, and render the intrusion of a foreign line into tha; south-western corner of Persia com mercially impossible, 514, 515, 517. A feasible route was surveyed in 1902 by Captain Hopkins, a railway expert, from Mohammerah, via Behbehan, to Shiraz, the ruling gradient being 1 in 40, 517, 518. This gradient is commercially practicable for a metre-gauge railway, 563, 565. This line could eventually be linked up, if desirable, with the Russian railways (for details of the proposed linking up with the Russian railways see “Bailway Concessions in Northern Persia”) or with the Indian railways, 534. The proposed line to connect it with the Indian railways has been surveyed by Captain Hopkins, 535, 5 / 4. It runs from Nushki, via Koh-i-Malik Siah, to Nasratabad Tope, thence across the Lut Desert to a point east of Kerman, but not neceessarily entering Kerman owing to the dip; thence it runs, via Saidabad and Lake Niriz, to Shiraz, 573. A branch should eventually be constructed from the vicinity of Bam to Bunder Abbas, the object being strategical, so that if we were turned out from the western end of the line by a Power coming from the west along the railway we should still be in a strong position, with a base at Bunder Abbas, for defending the eastern section, 572. This branch would not pay commercially, 599. The first step to be taken to forestall the Baghdad Railway should be to obtain a Concession for a railway from Mohammerah or Hawizeh to Shiraz, with a branch to the sea, 512, 545; and with a port between the mouths of the Shat-el- Arab and Bunder Dilam to cover the case of the Karun ceasing to be navigable, 534.Kailway Concessions in Southern Persia—Bahrein. 121 The Concession would have to be obtained for private individuals and not for the Government, 605. Major J. A. Douylas :— The construcHon of a railway from Mohammerah to Shiraz would be very difficult, owing- to the hills west of Shiraz, 1003. Colonel C. E. Yate :— In Eastern Persia no railway would pay. The cost of a railway from Bushire to Shiraz is prohibitive, 1130. BAHREIN. Sir R. Ritchie :— (a.) Declaration of Protectorate. Our status is governed by the undertaking of the Sheikh not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with any Power other than Great Britain, not to consent to a Resident Agent of any other Government without the assent of the British Government, and not to alienate territory except to the British Govern ment, 37, 73-75 It is a quasi-Protectorate, 38. Under the Treaty of 1861 the Chief, as indepen dent Ruler of Bahrein, bound himself to abstain from war in support of slavery, and the British Government engaged to maintain the security of his territory, 79 ; thus renewing the engage ments of 1820, 80. We accepted him as independent Ruler of Bahrein, 80. The British Political Agent is the only foreign representative, and the Sheikh cannot receive another, 53. Our positioji has frequently been challenged by the Turk and Persian, but we have refused to listen to either. They deny our claim to pro tect Bahreinese subjects in Turkey or Persia. 39. We interfere to a certain extent in the administra tion of Bahrein, and recently intervened in favour of German and Persian subjects, 40-42. At present the Indian Government say that a Court composed of a representative of the Sheikh and the Political Agent exercises juris diction over British subjects and foreigners, 51, 52, 54, 55 ; but we have no Order in Council, 52. The Indian Government’s proposal that we should by Order in Council assume jurisdiction over foreigners would be a great advantage, 49, 50. We should have to make a communication to the Powers concerned, 48. Until an intimation is made to the foreign Powers we have not really a Protectorate in the sense that we desire, 62. As the Order in Council would limit the Sheikh’s present jurisdiction over foreigners, it would be necessary to first come to an agreement with him, 59-61. There should be no difficulty in squaring the Sheikh, and this would strengthen uur position in any intimation to foreign Powers, 63, 70. A declaration of Protectorate would be based on the Treaties of 18fc0 and 1892, 64. The point is that we should first ascertain from the Government of India that the Sheikh will be willing to give us jurisdiction over foreign subjects, 81. (b.) Arms Traffic and Control of Customs. Bahrein is not a distributing centre for the arms traffic. Only a certain amount from ships calling go to the mainland in dhows, 43. The Sheikh has always refused to give up his customs, 70, 71. He has been offered a guarantee of a fixed sum in return for handing over his customs, but he will not look at it, 71. Compensation to him would take the form of cash, 72. (c.) Bank. The Imperial Bank of Persia could not operate at Bahrein, as its charter limits it to Persia, 46. (d.) Pearl Fisheries. Bahrein is an important place, and wealthy in itself because of the pearl traffic, 45. It is in connection with the pearl fisheries that a foreign Power might challenge our position at Bahrein, 65. The pearl fisheries in territorial waters belong to the Sheikh, 66. It would be easier to deal with on interloper if it was recognized universally that we had a Protectorate, and a right to action in the Sheikh’s interest, 67, Mr. E. Lloyd :— British ships call at Bahrein when necessary, but the trade is mainly in shell, which is chiefly in the hands of the Germans, 485. Sir L. Dane :— (a.) Declaration of Protectorate. Practically all civil cases, and nearly all recent criminal cases, concerning foreigners at Bahrein have been made over by the Sheikh to the English Political Agent to be dealt with, 647. An Order in Council is required to put ourselves on a more legal footing. The Sheikh has no objec tion to our dealing with all foreigners’ cases, but our jurisdiction might be challenged, and if the Order in Council were passed before any serious case occurred our position would be stronger, 642, 650. The Order in Council should recite what we already do, 651. (b.) Customs Administration. The Sheikh of Bahrein objects to our controlling his Customs for the same reason as the Sultan of Muscat. He does not like to be protected against his will, or that we should know his income, 643. Major Cox hopes to carry this through. The Sheikh is not going to farm his Customs again through the Hindoo dealers, 644. By obtaining control of the Customs we should control the Sheikh’s sources of income and stop the arms traffic, 645. This matter is less important at Bahrein than at Muscat, as we are in a strong position there already, thanks to the Germans and Persians themselves, 645.122 Bahrein—Muscat. (c.) Consular Protection. Sir L. Dane :— The Sheikh of Bali rein would object strongly if he found we did not protect his subjects. If we could insist upon the Persian Government recognizing not only our good offices, but Consular protection, it would be most satis factory, 655. Sir W. Lee- Warner :— We have an absolute right to maintain our Pro tectorate and declare it, 1034. One danger to avoid is international complications in the Gulf, which would centre on the pearl fisheries, 1035. Bahrein is opposite the country we must watch— from Ujair to Odeid and the El Katr coast—which we have not recognized as under Turkish pro tectorate. though there is a Turkish garrison, 1035. We ought at once to make our arrangements for jurisdiction over foreigners, 1035. MUSCAT. Arms Traffic and Control of Customs. Sir R. Ritchie :— The one thing we are afraid of at Muscat is inter national control. At present the French alone, besides ourselves, have a voice there. A col lection of lighthouse dues might lead to a claim for representation by Germany and others, 5. Muscat is the distributing centre of the arms traffic, 6, 43. At the forthcoming Brussels Conference endeavours are to be made to induce the Powers who have Treaties—France, the United States, and Holland —to give up their right to trade in arms. If they consent we shall induce the Sultan to pro hibit the import of arms, and he will have to be compensated to the extent of 12.000/. per annum, 6, 13. Any Power contributing to this compensation would claim a right to supervise the illicit trade in arms at Muscat, 8. In order to avoid international control we shall have to compensate the Sultan ourselves, 14, 15. The procedure about arms proposed for Muscat is to have a bonded warehouse, which no arms can enter nor leave without proper licences. This requires a capable administrator, who should be British, 11. There is no objection to the Indian Government taking steps to get an Indian Customs official appointed as head of the Customs at Muscat, 16 ; but care must be taken not to offend the French, 17, 18; and a subsidy will have to be guaranteed to the Sultan, 27, 28. We shall have to make a bargain acceptable to the Sultan. It may be a losing bargain to us, as the Sultan hates giving up his Customs, 29. At present the Sultan when short of money gets an advance from the Customs farmer. Under British control lie would receive a regular sum every month. He will not like the idea, 30. It is doubtful if better collection will be an in ducement to the Sultan, 31. We practically admit Musaudim to be Muscat ter ritory. The advantage of hoisting the British flag there remains to be seen, 32, 33. We have a promise from the Sultan not to alienate Musandim without our consent, 35. The Government of India consider it important to have a preponderating influence at Muscat owing to its situation, 607. 608. Theoretically, our influence there is a joint one with France; and, in the case of the Bunder Gisseh coal depot, we lost it for a time, but practically the Govern ment of India preponderates largely; they pay the annual subsidy that Zanzibar is supposed to pay to Muscat; they are accommodating in the matter of loans; He Sultan looks to India to protect his interest!-, and the bulk of the traders in Muscat are British Indians, 609. So long as we retain our present position and influence the French Consul can do little harm, but we should prefer not to have him there, 610. By obtaining control of the Customs we should hold the purse-strings, and thereby insure a pre ponderating influence, 611. The Sultan dislikes the idea because he knows it would make him entirely dependent on us, 612. Two arrangements have been proposed—one, that, in consideration of an annual advance, the Indian Government should take entire charge of the Customs, which we could not secure now; the other, which is possible, that we should secure a modified control, the Sultan, in return for a guaranteed annual income, agreeing to our lend ing an officer to control the Customs, 613. The Government of India would prefer that Muscat should not he brought within the Brussels Act, 618; as this would open the door to international contro', 619. The Indian Government have two or three times suggested that the French Government should be induced to stop the arms traffic, 621 ; but without success, 622. Unless the French agree, it is impossible to stop the arms traffic, but even its continuance is preferable to international control at Muscat, 637. The Sultan has no power to suppress the arms traffic himself, and the French would object if he made the attempt, 626. The trade is carried on mainly under the French flag from a place called Sur. The bulk of the trade is to the Persian and Turkish coast, to Arabia, Persia, Afghanistan, and the tribes on the north-west frontier, 627, 628. Many sug gestions have been made to stop this trade, which is most dangerous to India, 630. The Sultan has prohibited the trade in arms with Persia, the Trucial Chiefs, Bahrein, and India, because all these countries have prohibited the import of arms, but not with 'lurkey, because Turkey has not prohibited it. If Turkey would prohibit it we should be able to search any boat in the Persian Gulf, except those under foreign colours, as they would necessarily be contraband, since no port in the Persian Gulf would be open to the trade. The Sultan has given us the power of stopping and searching Muscat boats, and we have a right to search all boats in Persian territorial waters and seize those carrying arras, and carry them to the nearest Persian port to be condemned, 631. There are usually two gun boats on the coast in the running season, from October to May. Hitherto they have not been successful because when the gun-boat appears in sight the arms are thrown overboard and subsequently recovered, 631. By using the telegraph line along the coast to Jashk. with telephones and some camel watch men, it is hoped to inform gun-boats where cargoes are to be run, as Afghan traders collect at those poh.ts, 631. Wireless telegraphy would greatly facilitate it; at present flag r-ignalling is used for communicating with the gun-boats. No boats with arms have yet been captured, though known to be there, 632.[370] Muscat —Miscellaneous. 123 This year the Sultan of Muscat has been induced to prohibit the landing 1 of Afghans at Muscat, which has disorganized the arrangements of the traders, and no arms have been landed, but it is a dubious experiment, and eventually the Afghans will send Persians and Baluchis across instead. 632. It is proposed to compensate the Sultan for the loss of the revenues from arms running by raising the 5,760/. paid to him by the Govern ment of India for Zanzibar to 15,000/., 634, 635. Sir W. Lee-Warner :— Muscat was always regarded by the Indian Govern ment as the key to our predominant position in the Persian Gulf, 1028. In very early times the Indian Government established this predominance, 1028. What started us there was the fear of France. The Treaties of 1798 with Muscat excluded France, 1075. The Agreement of 1862. by which England and France jointly guaranteed the independence of Muscat, was a blow to our position. 1028. Nevertheless, the Indian Government continued to work up an influence independently of France, 1028. The recent demand by France for a coaling station at Bunder Gisseh, and the subsequent admission on our part that the Musandim promontory from Ras Dibba to Tibba is Muscat territory, and not part of the Pirate Coast as previously assumed, dealt a further blow at our predominance, 1028- 1032. Our position in the Gulf vitally depends on our freedom of action to put up telegraph stations, obtain leases, hoist our flag, or obfain con cessions in the important ports of the Musandim promontory, 1029-1032 We are now forced to act there as if France were in the same position as ourselves, 1032. We ought to have a telegraph station on Sheeps Island or somewhere near Musandim, 1050. It would be valuable in case of trouble hereafter, would cost very little, and we are entitled to it under an Agreement providing for telegraphs, 1050. Rad our hands been free we ought to have obtained rights over Elphmstone Inlet, Malcolm Inlet, Khor Kawi. or whichever is the best port, so that no Power could step in without infringing them, 1050. The climate of Cape Musandim is very bad, 1051. Our Agreement with France is a sufficient guarantee that no one else will go to Musandim, 1075. For the moment no further action is necessary, 1076. Colonel C. E. Tate :— A firmer assertion of our position in Muscat is the greatest aim we can have. We have lost two opportunities of getting free of the engage ments that trouble us at Muscat, viz., after the Treaty of 1862, when we guaranteed the inde pendence of .Muscat jointly with France, and during the recent Anglo-French Agreement, 1103. If we could come to terms with France we could abolish the arms traffic, 1104. The only effective plan is to induce the Sultan to formally—perhaps by joint note to England and France—exempt arms and ammunition from the operation of the Treaties, 1104. The arms traffic is most dangerous to India, because the Afridis and frontier tribes get not only Martinis but Lee-Metfords, 1105. The rifles are conveyed in dhows to the different ports in Baluchistan, 1107. It is no longer possible to keep order in Persian Baluchistan, and that adds to our difficulties in British Baluchistan, 1107. The arms question is very serious to Persia and British Baluchistan, 1107. Miscellaneous. Sir R. Ritchie :— El Kntr. —El Katr is interesting because we have allowed the Turks to maintain a military post at El Bidaa, though we have repeatedly told the Porte that we do not recognize their jurisdiction, 82. The Wahahees. —The question turns on quarrels of the tribes in the interior. We should do nothing except on the coast, 85. The proposal of the Indian Government to send an Agent to the Wahabee capital has been forbidden by successive Secretaries of State, 86. Koivt-it .—The Sheikli is practically under our pro tection. We have guaranteed him against the Turk, the only person who would attack him, 87. The Turks have certain shadowy rights over him, which we have endeavoured to make more shadowy, 88. In 1902 His Majesty’s Government undertook to defend Koweit, provided the Sheikh complied with their wishes and followed their advice, 89. Re accepted that undertaking, 90. We are not sure whether we shall want Warba. We have a right of pre-emption, but the Sheikh’s rights are uncertain. If he has rights that would give us control of Warba roads to the south of Warba Island. But that would only block the southern approach to Urn Kasr, and there would still be possibility of access by the Northern Channel, 92. When we asked the Turks to withdraw from Bubiyan, we did not ask them to withdraw’ from Um Kasr, 93. Bassidv. —It has never been decided whether we have sovereign rights at Bassidu, or whether we are merely owners .of the freehold subject to Persian sovereignty, 97. We fly the flag there, 98. Aha Musa. —The Germans have been told that Abu Musa is under our protection. 101; and that all communications must pass throug'h the British Consular Representative, 102. They have not disputed that, 103. The Treaties of 1892 with the Trucial Chiefs and Bahrein have been pub lished in Rertslet’s Treaties, 104; these Treaties constitute a Protectorate, 106. Trucial Chiefs. —The Trucial Chiefs do not admit a foreign agent, nor correspond with foreigners nor tor' ign Powers direct, 108; in the case of the Trucial Chiefs we have such a rough country, and so few dealings, that we have no difficulty in interpreting the three conditions of our Agreements, 109. The Treaties with the Trucial Chiefs meet all contingencies that are likely to arise, 110, 111. - Sir J. Mackay :— As the trade between India and the Persian Gulf is practically as great as between Great Britain and the Gulf, and an enormous number of Indians travel backw’ards and forw r ards, it is a fair charge for India to bear half the cost of the Consular establishments there, 135, 139. Sir L. Dane :— Koweit. —Everything that is really necessary at the moment has been done, 652.124. Miscellaneous—Salaries oe Consuls and Indian Government Agents. There is a difficulty about Consular protection to Koweit subjects. We have insisted upon it in Persia two or three times. In Turkey we can not insist on it without raising 1 the question of the status of Koweit, which is better left undecided, 655, 656. Mr. P. Thomas :— Coaling Stations. —Coaling stations should be created at Kharak, Ormuz, and Koweit for strategical purposes, in anticipation of Russia gaining a port in the Gulf, such as Mohammerah, 712-716. Mr. H. F. B. Lynch :— We should obtain Concessions for roads, not rail ways, 937, 938. Lynch brothers’ Concession for the Ahwaz- Isfahau (Bakhtiari) road is for twenty-five years, 990. In that corner of Persia the roads are in British hands practically for as long as we like, 993. Sir W. Lee-Warner :— Salaries of Foreign Office Consuls and Indian Govern ment Agents —The Indian Government compare the salaries of their agents with those of officers in the same Department serving in other parts of India, 1038. There is a scale of pay for military officers in political employ, which is higher than that of officers serving in England under different con ditions, 1039. It is a matter of arrangement with the Foreign Office whether a Foreign Office or Indian Repre sentative is appointed at each place, 1048. This arrangement does not work well, 1049. Bassidu and tienjam. —We have none of the em barrassment of an Agreement with France or any other Power on the north side of the Gulf, 1052. At Henjam we have a telegraph station, the limits of which are undefined, but we have the best part where the water supply is, 1053. We should try and extend our acquisitions in Ilenjam, and prevent the Persians from charging the Arab settlers against the Persians, 1053. We should maintain the status quo, 1053. Mohammerah. —It is important to keep such direct hold as we have. We have told the Sheikh that so long as he behaves properly he can rely on our good offices, 1054.APPENDICES. APPENDIX 1. TERMS OF REFERENCE TO SUB-COMMITTEE OF COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE. TO consider the effect that the completion of the Baghdad Railway mav have on the situation strategical, political, and commercial—in Southern Persia and the 1 ersian Oulf, and the measures that it may be necessary to take in advance for the maintenance of British interests in those regions, either immediately or after the railway has reached Baghdad. The Sub-Committee will consist of the following :— Mr. Morley (Chairman). Sir Edward Grey. # Mr. Lloyd George. Mr. Winston S. Churchill. Lord Esher. Sir Charles Hardinge. Sir Richmond Ritchie. Captain Slade. Sir William Nicholson. Major-General Ewart. Sir Charles Ottley (Secretary). . * Mr. Lloyd George retired from the Committee on his appointment as Chancellor of the Exchequer, his place being taken by Mr. W. S. Churchill, President of the Board of Trade. March 1908.Part I.—General Summary. 127 As such a description of our status—which appears to represent a view widely prevalent abroad—may not improbably be adopted by foreign Powers when increasing interest leads them to assume a definite attitude on this question, it appears desirable to collect, in a form convenient for reference, the salient facts of our historic association with the Gulf, and to summarize the views expressed by the Government of India and by successive Govern ments at home views which are remarkable for unanimity, and which have now well-nigh acquired the sanction of an axiom in the direction of British policy. It is with this purpose that the present Memorandum, which is merely a compilation ot leading and largely verbatim extracts from authoritative sources,has been drawn up. The de jure position in the Persian Gulf is that of a sea open to the flag ot all nations, tiie northern shores and territorial waters of which are included in the dominions of Persia, while its western and southern coasts are partially owned and partially claimed by Turkey, or are in the occupation ot Arab tribes, who have entered into Treaty relationships of varying character, constituting a sort of veiled Protectorate, with Great Britain The islands in the Gulf are owned either by Persia or by Arab Chiefs (in the case of Bahrein under British protection); but upon one of the Persian islands, viz., Ivishm, Great Britain possesses a piece of land by virtue of an original grant from the Imam of Muscat, to whom the island once belonged. Outside the entrance to the Persian Gulf, but included in the same political system, are, on the northern shore of the Arabian Sea, the coasts of Persian Baluchistan, along which the overland wires of the Indo-European Telegraph Company run as far as Task, where a reserve of territory exists under an Agreement concluded in 1887 between the British and Persian Governments, and where a detachment of Indian troops, who had previously been stationed there between the years 1879 and 1887, was re-established in January 1898 in consequence of the murder of a British telegraph official and the disturbed state of Persian Baluchistan. To the south of the entrance to the Persian Gulf, but within the sphere of its political influence, the Arab State of Muscat has for years been predominantly controlled by British influence; its trade is similarly in Anglo-Indian hands, and its Ruler has not merely for years been subsidized by the Government of India, but in 1891 entered it:to an Agreement with the British Government not to alienate any portion of his dominions to any other Power. The de facto position upon the waters and on the shores of the Persian Gulf reflects a more positive British predominance than the preceding paragraph might indicate. In the early years of the nineteenth century the Slave Trade was rampant in the Gulf, and the vessels of the Indian Marine were engaged in a long and arduous struggle with the Arab pirates who infested its southern coasts. This conflict, which was conducted entirely by British agency and means, without any help from the Persian Government, resulted in the establishment of Treaty relations with the great majority of the Arab Chiefs, under which they bound themselves to observe perpetual peace and to refer all disputes to the British Resident at Bushire. The pax Britannica, which has ever since, with rare exceptions, been maintained, is the issue of these arrangements and is the exclusive work of this country. Of similar origin were the soundings of the channels and the surveys of the shores of the Persian Gulf, w hich the navigators of all nations owe to the labours of a long line of naval officers of the Indian service. During the nineteenth century British trade acquired almost a monopoly of the foreign commerce of the Gulf ports. Indian Bunias from Shikarpur and other parts of Scind have settled in considerable numbers at Lingah, Bunder Abbas, Bushire, and Bahrein. Before the advent of the Belgian Customs officials at the former ports, and to this day at Bahrein, they have farmed the Customs. Foreign imports and exports for the most part are conveyed to and from the Gulf in British ships, more than one Anglo-Indian Company (the “British India,” the “Bombay and Persia,” and the “Anglo-Arabian * * Two works, which would have been invaluable for reference, have not been available in the preparation of this Memorandum, viz , “The Official Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf,” by Mr. Lorimer, and a “ Trade Report on Mesopotamia,” by Mr. Lloyd.

Before the institution of the German service the statistics show that 93 per cent, of the numbers and tonnage of the steamers engaged was under the British flag. The protection of the pearl fisheries, which are carried on by the Arab tribes under the time-honoured conditions, is an important feature of British policy. This subject is referred to in a subsequent portion of this Memo randum, dealing with matters of commerce. During the last forty years the maintenance of the submarine cables of the Indc-European Telegraph Company from Eao to Jask, and of the land lines from that place to Karachi, has also devolved upon the Indian Govern- ment, and has tended to increase an already preponderant influence over both the waters and the shores of the Gulf. Latterly there has been a deliberate hut necessary consolidation of our influence in certain quarters where trouble threatened or where rivalry was feared. At the north-west extremity of the Gulf the Government of India, under instructions from Ilis Majesty’s Government, have entered into engagements, dated 1899 and 1907, with the Sheikh of Koweit, by which he has bound himself and his successors not to receive the Representative of any other Power and not to alienate any portion of his territory to the Government or subjects of any other Power, while, on the other hand, he has granted to His Majesty’s Government certain prior rights in regard to the leasing of any portion of the foreshore of his territory. The first of these Agreements was dictated by the increasing encroachment of Turkish authority; the latter was due to a determination on the part of His Majesty’s Government to promote the participation of Great Britain in the Baghdad Railway upon favourable terms. At Bahrein a step was taken in the direction of protecting British interests and those of the local Sheikh by the appointment of a regular Political Agent, whose beneficent influence has already begun to make itself felt, notably in the settlement of judicial disputes. The more effective application of this influence is now under consideration, with a view to meeting the increasing requirements of European intercourse; while the reform of the Customs administration, and the proper control of the resulting revenue, has continued to occupy for some time the attention of the Govern ment of India. Such, briefly summarized, is the position that has been won by Great Britain, not without the expenditure of many millions of money and the sacrifice of many valuable lives, in the Persian Gulf. In its vindication this country has more than once been called upon to enter into military occupation of ports or islands in the Gulf. The Island of Kharak was occupied by Indian forces from 1838 to 1842. and again in 1856-7. Bushire was held during the latter years, as also were Mohammerah and Ahwaz, upon the Karun. The occupation of these places was an illustration of the vigour with which, in past years, our ascendency has been maintained. Their abandonment was a proof of the reluctance which has invariably been displayed to emphasize or to perpetuate those responsibilities. The situation of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf has been well described as unique; for although, with the slight exceptions referred to, she has at no time enjoyed, or even asked for, territorial acquisitions in those regions, she has for generations borne burdens there which no other nation has ever undertaken anywhere, except in the capacity of sovereign; she has had duty thrust upon her without dominion; she has kept the peace amongst people who are not her subjects; has patrolled, during upwards of two centuries, waters over which she has enjoyed no formal lordship; has kept, in strange ports, an open door through which the traders of every nation might have as free access to distant markets as her own.

Part II.—POLITICAL. NOTE. — The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and Consul-General at Bushire. This official qua Political liesident is under the Indian Government; qua Consul- General under the Foreign Office. The cost of his establishment is divided between the British and Indian exchequers. As a Consular officer, the Political Resident receives His Majesty’s commission as ■Consul-General for the Provinces of Fars, Khuzistan, and Luristan, and the district of Lingah, and for the coasts and islands of the Persian Gulf, being within the dominions of Persia. He resides at Bushire, and receives an office allowance of 12(P. from Foreign Office funds. The judicial powers and jurisdiction of the Political Resident are exercised, by virtue of his commission as Consul-General, under the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council. The Resident exercises an undefined but considerable influence upon the political affairs, more especially external, of Muscat, the Trucial States, Bahrein, and Koweit, at which places the Representatives of the Indian Government are under him. (a.) Muscat, including the Musandim Peninsula. At Muscat there is a Political Agent appointed by the Government of India, who also holds a commission as Consul, under the Foreign Office. The cost of the establishment is borne by Indian revenues. Neither the coast-line nor the hinterland of the dominions of the Sultan of Muscat has ever been delimitated or accurately ascertained. In the British Counter-Case, presented to The Hague Tribunal in the Muscat Dhows Arbitration in 1905, it is stated that the southern limit on the coast-line of Arabia reached by the Sultan’s dominions is near Has Sair or Sajir. At Rakhiout (16° 45' north by 53° 25' east), a place near this point, the Sultan’s Vali has built a fort. From Rakhiout up to the town of Muscat, the coast-line is continuously and admittedly under the sovereignty of the Sultan of Muscat. North and west of the town of Muscat the coast-line is under the undoubted dominion of the Sultan as far as Khor Kalba. The Sheikh of Shargah claims authority over the coast-line north of this point as far as Ras Dibba, as being part of the territories of the Jowasmi tribe. For many years this district—which is known as the Batineh coast—has been regarded as feudatory of the Sheikh of Shargah, and the coast itself as subject to the Maritime 'truce which will be mentioned hereafter. This territory has never been under the sovereignty of the Sultan of Muscat, and it is admitted in the French Case in the Muscat Dhows Arbitration that it is under the government of the Sheikh of the Jowasmi, residing at Ras-el-Kheimah. The following passage, which constitutes an important admission on the part of His Majesty’s Government, is a verbatim extract from the British Counter-Case above referred to :— “ From Ras Dibba to Tibba (Tibat) the coast forming the promontory of Musandim is claimed by the Sultan of Muscat, who has certainly before and since 1864 exercised authority on that coast by his Pali and in other ways; and his rights on the coast are recognized by the Sheikh of Shargah and the Jowasmi.” A detailed account of the territory in question, which comprises Elphmstone Inlet and the Maklab Isthmus, is contained in a letter from the Political Agent at Muscat, dated the 2nd July, 1902. A Minute by Lord Curzon, dated the 6th October, 1902, also deals with the question. Major130 Appendix 2.—Part ll. Mr. Lorimer, March 25, 1905.

Cox expressed the view that the Sultan’s jurisdiction was of so uncertain and ineffective a character that it would be open to His Majesty’s Govern ment either to recognize or to ignore its existence, as might be found most convenient; but Mr Lorimer, who made investigations on the spot, con troverted this view. The passage quoted finally disposes of all future ambiguity as to territorial jurisdiction. The predecessors of the present Sultan occupied territory for a good many years on the Persian coast from Bunder Abbas to Lingah with the Island of Kishm, under a Pirman of the Shah of Persia, to whom they paid rates or tribute. In 1855 a lease for twenty years was granted at an annual, rent. In 1868 a new arrangement was made for seven years, also at a rent, hut, on the occasion of civil war in Muscat in 1868, the Shah cancelled the lease, under powers given by the Convention, and resumed occupation of the territory in question. Gwadur is an enclave on the confines of Persia and Baluchistan, which has for over 100 years formed part of the dominions of the Sultan of Muscat, to whom it was granted by the Khan of Khelat. It extends for a radius of one stage (about 10 or 15 miles) from the town of Gwadur. In this territory is a station of tlie Indo-European telegraph, but it has never been occupied by Great Britain. The British connection with Muscat is of long standing. Treaties of Friendship and Commerce, as well as for the suppression of slavery, have been concluded with successive Imams of Muscat on different occasions since 1798. In that year the first engagement was entered into between the East India Company and Saiyid Sultan for the exclusion from his territories of French influence, which contemplated finding in Muscat a coiivenient basis of attack upon India in the war then being waged between Great Britain and France. At a later date, on the death of Saiyid Said in 1856, dispute arose between his two sons as to the possession of Muscat and Zanzibar, which had hitherto been united under the same Buler. This was referred to the arbitration of the Viceroy of India, then Lord Canning, who, after careful inquiry, decided that the two States should remain separate, being divided between the two brothers, but that Zanzibar, in virtue of its superior wealth, should pay to Muscat a yearly subsidy ot 40,000 crowns (5,760/. ). At a subsequent' period, in 1873, the British Government, in return for Agreements concerning the suppression of the Slave Trade, successfully concluded with the Bulers both of Muscat and Zanzibar, undertook to relieve the latter of this payment, which has since that date been made by the Government of India almost without intermission ii: ’ to the reigning Sultan of Muscat. The Sultan was to receive this subsidy ‘•'so long as he continued faithfully to fulfil his Treaty engagements, and manifest his friendship towards the British Government.” It appears, indeed, that since the time of Saiyid Said no Sultan of Muscat has been able effectively to establish his position without obtaining the recognition of the British Government. Throughout this period the Government of India have on several occasions been called upon to intervene in the dynastic disputes of the Muscat State. Claimants or pretenders have been interned in India, have been prevented from attacking a reigning Sultan, have been given allowances, and have been otherwise treated with marks of wise and beneficent interest. Thus, in 1874, in 1877, 1883, 1886, 1888, 1890, and again in 1895 and 1896, His Majesty’s Government afforded the Sultan valuable and effective support in the maintenance of stable government. This catalogue of services rendered by the British Government to successive Bulers of Muscat, and notably to the present occupant of the throne, the annual payment of a subsidy contingent upon the loyal fulfilment of Treaty obligations, and the history of the influence thereby exercised by Great Britain for a period of over half a century upon the fortunes of the State at once explain and justify the existence of a positive political predominance on the part of Great Britain that is shared by no other Bower * * (1.) There was an intermission in 1888-90, consequent on the deatli of Sultan Seyyid Turki, and penning' the complete recognition of his successor. (2.) There was a very short intermission from December 1898 to September 1899, pending' the settlement of unpaid balances of indemnity (arising out of losses to British subjects during Abdullah-bin-Saleh’s rebellion) and of two loans. (British Counter-Case, Section VIII.)Political, (a.) Muscat, including Musandim Peninsula. 131 in the affairs of Muscat. M hile not compromising the independence of its Soveieign, which hoth the British and hrench Governments have reciprocally bound themselves, by a declaration made in the year 1862, to respect, this condition of affairs has yet been the inevitable outcome of the physical situation of the country, of its continuity to the shores of India, and of its close proximity to the waters of the Persian Gulf, in which British interests, political and commercial, have exercised so commanding an influence. In the poits and territory of Muscat itself this predominance has been accentuated b\ the facts that the trade of the British dominions with Mffscat amounts to about five-sixths of the entire trade of the country; that the latter is almost exclusively in the hands of Indian traders, who are British subjects, that the commerce and interests of any other country are relatively insignificant, that the share ot the trade enjoyed by the three other Powers with whom Muscat has direct Treaty relations, viz., America, Prance, and Holland,- amounts, if added together, to less than one-seventeenth of the entire trade of the country. The relations of amity which have been above recorded culminated in 1891 in an Agreement voluntarily entered into by Seyyid Feysal-bin-Turki, G.O.I.E., the present Sultan, following immediately upon the conclusion of a new Commercial Treaty between Great Britain and Muscat, by which he undertook ne\eu to code, to sell, to mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation, save to the British Government, the dominions of Muscat and Oman or anv of their dependencies. * In 1894 a French Vice-Consul was appointed at Muscat, and this official made it his first aim to alienate the sympathy of the Sultan from Great Britain. The action of Franee was believed to be inspired to a large extent by Bussia, who was credited with designs of an aggressive naval policy in the Gull. It would be tedious to retail the circumstances under which this action was exerted. Suffice it to say that matters reached a crisis in 1899, when it transpired that an Agreement had been concluded with the French Govern ment, in March of the preceding year, for the lease of a coaling station at Bunder Gisseh, a place five miles south-east of Muscat. This action was held to constitute a violation of the Agreement of 1891 with Great Britain. Owing to this and the breach of other Treaty stipulations, and of personal assurances formally entered into by the Sultan, a Memorandum was presented to him on the 3rd February, 1899, by the Government of India, which, after recapitulating the engagements of the Sultans of Muscat to Her Majesty’s Government, and the acts of friendliness and of material support afforded to them, particularly in checking the attacks of hostile tribes on Muscat, made the following demands upon the Sultan :— (a.) The abrogation of a cession of a piece of territory for a coaling station to France (to which he had agreed without the knowledge of Her Majesty’s Government). (b.) The dismissal of a confidential adviser, Abdul Aziz, who was notoriously inimical to British interests. (c.) Payment of interest on certain sums due as an indemnity to British subjects. (d.) Cessation of the levy of taxes on British subjects which were not compatible with his Treaty engagements. (e.) The issue of orders to his subjects for the exclusive use of the Muscat flag. Under threat of force the Sultan formally complied with these terms, and wrote to the French Consul declining to receive Abdul Aziz (who w r as the Consul’s Munshi) as French Agent. About this time the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown was sought as to certain aspects of the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862, engaging Great Britain and France to respect the independence of the Sultan of Muscat. * * The dates of the respective Treaties are: United States of America, 1833 ; France, 1844; Netherlands, 1877. An Arrangement respecting trade jurisdiction, wrecks, &amp;c., was concluded by the Portuguese Governor-General of Mozambique in February 1826. [376] 2 Mag»a—————————————Ml 111MMIMJLL 132 Appendix 2. —Part II. They expressed themselves as follows :— “ 1. The Declaration of 1862 does not in our opinion require the British Govern ment to abstain from exercising a preponderating influence in Muscat, so long as that influence is not exerted in any way inconsistent with the independence of Muscat. For instance, the subsidy, and the terms on which it was made payable, involved no breach of the Declaration. “ 2. We think that the British Government would be justified in punishing or even deposing a particular Sultan who broke his engagements with the British Government. The undertaking contained in the Declaration is an engagement to respect the inde pendence ol the Sovereigns of Muscat as representing the country, and does not carry with it an inability to punish any particular Sovereign for breaches of Treaty or of international law. For this the consent of France is not necessary. But it would be a breach of the Declaration if after deposing a particular Sultan a successor were set up who was not independent. “ We should add that, whilst the question whether the Sultan could consistently with the Declaration be required to dismiss a particular adviser must depend on the special circumstances of the case, it is hardly compatible with the independence of Muscat that the Sultan should be compelled to accept Ministers and advisers who are acceptable to the British Government. “(Signed) RICHARD E. WEBSTER. ROBERT B. FINLAY. “ Law 0fleers Department, March 8, 1899.” With regard to the Erench coaling station at Bunder Gisseh, Her Majesty’s Government expressed both to His Highness the Sultan and to France the view that the sale or lease of any piart of His Highness’ dominions to a foreign Power was not only a breach of the Sultan’s Agreement with Great Britain of 1891, hut was also inconsistent with the Declaration con- Vide Bi^ish Counter- eluded between the British and French Governments in 1862. The Govern- Arbitration^ ° WS ! nent of tlie ^ rencl1 Republic accepted the British reading of the latter instrument, viz., that neither State might accept any cession or lease of Muscat territory; and it was agreed that France should be free to establish a coal depdt on the same terms as those granted to Great Britain, viz., on sufferance, and such a depot has been established in Muscat Harbour on a portion of the ground originally allotted to Great Britain for the purpose. The result, therefore, of British action was to prevent a lease or cession of territory to France in contravention of the Declaration of 1862, which would otherwise have taken place. In other words, the British protest, so far from being a breach of that Declaration as argued by the French Government, prevented its breach by France. Grant of French flags to Muscat Dhows, France has always refused to permit the exercise by the war-ships of any other Power of the droit de visite on the high seas as regards ships carrying the French flag, and, by only partially ratifying the Brussels General Act in 1892, she preserved this claim to resist the right of search. The French officials in Obokh, Madagascar, and the Comoros have granted, from time to time, French ships’ papers and flags to subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, and the same course has been taken by the French Consuls at Aden, Muscat, and Zanzibar. Most of the Omanis Avho thus received French papers belonged to the district of Jalani and the towm of Sur, within Muscat territories. These men were neither of French nationality nor naturalization; they bad no authority from the Sultan to change* their allegiance, and they had no permanent residence or settlement in°French territory, but merely paid fleeting visits thereto for the purpose of renewing their licences. Many of these flagholders engaged in the Slave Trade. Moreover, on returning to the waters and territory of Muscat, they claimed that the Sultan was not entitled to board or search their vessels, or to exercise any jurisdiction over them, and that they w^ere entitled to be treated as French proteges, and to be exempt from his laws as regards customs, quarantine, and other matters. The Sultan of Muscat never admitted that the grant of French flao-s or papers was warranted by Treaty or usage, and made repeated protests on thePolitical.—( a.) Muscat, including Musandim Peninsula. 133 subject. He appealed to His Majesty s Government, who on several occasions made representations to the Prench Government. I inally, it was decided that the whole question of the grant of French flags to subjects ot the Sultan should be submitted to the arbitration of the International Court at The Hague. The following two points were submitted to the decision of the Tribunal which met at The Hague on the 24th July, 1905 : W The SC( ?P e of the reciprocal Declaration made by Great Britain and France in 1862 in relation to the issue by France to subjects of the Sultan of papers authorizing them to fly the French flag; and (b.) The nature of the privileges and immunities claimed by subjects of the Sultan who Aieie owners or masters of dhows and possessed French papers, or were members of the crew of such dhows, and their families, especially as to the manner in which such privileges and immunities affected the jurisdiction of His Highness over his said subjects. The results of the Award may be summarized as follows :— 1 lance may icneu the licences to fly the French flag granted to owners of dhows before the 2nd January, 1892. But no licences given since that date are valid unless the grantee was a bond fide French protege before 186J. # This decision will, it is believed, reduce the number of French flagholders to ten or twelve at the utmost. Moreover, the licences in question cannot be transmitted oi transferred to any other dhow, even if belonging to the same owner. I hus, it would appear that if one of the licensed dhows were to be lost oi disable d, the owner, in order to obtain a new licence, must prove that he comes ^under the category of those who were bond fide French proteges before 1863. Such proteges must now be scarce, and the number of French flagholders should, in the course of a few years, be reduced to vanishin 0, point. Muscat Customs. The administration of the Muscat Customs is under the direct manage- Administration Report ment of the local Government. In the last few years the Sultan has shown on the Persian Gulf a ready inclination to profit by Western ideas, and there is every reason to ^ oliticaI Residency and hope that enlightened progress will ultimately be made in the matter of the ^iToSor 1 Agency Customs. At present the system by which sudden calls on the State Exchequer are met by drafts upon the Customs Superintendent is liable to place that oflicial in frequent difficulties, and to prevent him from doing full justice to his charge. The Sur Customs should be an important factor in the Sultan’s revenue, but the French flag question made it impossible for some time for the Ruler of Muscat to bring the administration of Sur to that state of reasonable efficiency which its importance as a trade emporium demands. The Gwadur Customs, too, are a source of annoyance to the Sultan. Ever since the late Khoja contractor was ousted from the Customs farm, and the collection of customs dues resumed by the Sultan, constant dissensions have occurred between the mercantile community and Customs officials regarding the tariff.f Letter from Political Agent, Muscat, to Resident in Persian Gulf, No. 352, dated September 11, 1901. lor many years the Indian Government have been desirous of placing India Office, the Muscat Customs under the superintendence of a British official. In Februai 7 14, 1905. 1905 they suggested that an arrangement should be proposed to the Sultan of Muscat for the appointment of a British head Customs officer. This official was to be nominated by the Indian Government and appointed by the Sultan. But, although a servant of the Sultan, it was to be stipulated that, in cases of important differences of opinion between him and His Highness, the latter should agree to accept the friendly arbitration of the British Political Agent. Another feature of the proposal was a guarantee by India of the Muscat Customs revenue to the extent of 20,000 dollars a-month. * * The year 1863 was taken as the date at which, in virtue of legislation by the Ottoman Porte, and of the Prauco-Moroccan Treaty of that year, the creation of new protegds was regulated and limited. t The 8ultan visited Gwadur in person in February 1904 for the purpose of bringing about a settlement, in which he appears to have been unsuccessful.

Circumstances were apparently favourable for such an arrangement, as the Sultan had become dissatisfied with his own administration of the Customs. Owing to disputes he was unable to obtain from -that source sufficient funds even to send a steamer to Zanzibar. It appeared, however, to Lord Lansdowne that any considerable change in the internal adminis tration of Muscat would afford the French Government grounds of complaint or a pretext for a counter-move. He considered that an arrangement might be made of a less far-reaching character than that proposed by the Govern ment of India; and, in any case, he thought that the matter should be deferred until the conclusion of the Muscat arbitration. Later in the year the Sultan applied to the Indian Government for a loan, and it was suggested that compliance with this request might afford a reason for bringing up the question of a reorganization of the Customs. Negotiations were, however, then in progress for carrying into effect the Muscat Arbitration Award, and Lord Lansdowne considered that, pending their conclusion, it was inadvisable to deal with the loan on the proposed basis. He limited his approval to the grant of a small advance, in relief of the Sultan’s pressing financial difficulties, repayable from his subsidy, without political conditions.* Although the Sultan had promised to borrow only from His Majesty’s Government, advances were obtained by him from M. Goguyer (a French merchant), the Khojas (Muscat subjects), and various firms, against future payments of customs dues. In August 1907 the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reported that a further sum had been borrowed fiom M. Goguyer against the security of these dues. It seemed to him a good opportunity for official remonstrance, unless it might be considered better to wait until the termination of the French flag case. The control of the arms traffic may not improbably evoke a wish in some quarters to internationalize the Muscat Customs Administration. It is perhaps, therefore, not unfortunate that in view of the state of the Sultan’s financial affairs, and the recent conclusion of the Muscat Arbitration Award negotiations, occasion may soon occur for reviving the proposal to reorganize this Dejiartment under Britisli auspices. The Musandim Peninsula. The following description of the Musandim Peninsula is taken from Lord Curzon’s book on Persia:— “ Fifteen miles from the extreme point of Ras Musandim the promontory again narrows to an isthmus, named Maklab, not more than half-a-mile in width, by which it is united to the mainland. On the eastern side of this isthmus a splendid bay, called by the natives Ghubbeh Ghazireh, and by the English Malcolm’s Inlet, sweeps in from the sea. On the western side'is an even finer natural harbour, more completely landlocked, and providing anchorage for the largest vessels, known as Elphinstone’s Inlet. The station of Khasab, at the entrance to this wonderful cove, has before now been recommended (amongst others by Sir Lewis Felly) for permanent occupation by the British, as a naval base in the Persian Gulf. Here the entire British fleet might safely ride at anchor. “ When the telegraph cable was first being laid to the Persian Gulf in 1864, it was taken by what was then thought the shortest and best line from Gwadur to Cape Musandim. Entering Malcolm’s Inlet, the wires were stretched across the Isthmus of Maklab, and re-entered the sea in Elphin- * * The following- loans have been made to the Sultan of Muscat from Indian revenues 1902. 1,50,000 rupees (10,000/.), advanced to Sultan for purchase of yacht. 1904. 30,000 rupees (2,000Z.), on condition he was not to borrow elsewhere. 1906. 20,000 rupees (1,333Z.), sanctioned, but apparently not taken advantag-e of by His Highness. These sums are being repaid by deductions from the Sultan’s subsidy. In September 1906 (the latest information received) the balance due from the Sultan to the Government of India on account of the above was stated to be 49,791 rupees (viz., 31,791 rupees on account of the advance for tli© yacht; 18,000 rupees balance due on the other two loans).■EMHBnH mammm atOTMBHBBHOnBMHBBaMBMMWBBMMa Political —(a.)

But the drawbacks of the site, arising froni tlie hot climate, the sterile neighbourhood, and the suspicions of the native tribes, compelled a retreat from the course adopted; and, in 1869 the cable was diverted to Cape Jask and Henjam.” In a despatch dated the 2nd May, 1901, the Government of India wrote :— “ The harbour of Elphinstone Inlet, on the western side of the Musandim Promontory, possesses many advantages, but we consider it less suitable (than Bassidu and Henjam) for our ultimate naval station at the mouth of the Gulf, because of its total lack of supplies and the uncivilized character of the aboiiginal inhabitants. Me should, however, see no obiection to the hoisting of the British flag on the Isthmus of Maklab, not necessarily with the v iew of ulterior occupation, but in order to anticipate seizure by any other Power. J J he question of the measures to be taken to prevent the occupation of the anchorage s ol this promontory by some other European Power was again raised by the India Office at an inter-Departmental discussion on various questions connected with the Persian Gulf on the 14th Julv, 1902. The Government ol India, to whom the Report of the Committee was communi cated, recommended in a despatch dated the 2drd October, 1902, that the British Resident in the Persian Gulf should be authorized to effect a reoccupation of^ the deserted telegraph buildings at Elphinstone Inlet by hoisting the British flag and posting a native Agent there. The Admiralty who were consulted by the Foreign Office, stated on the 31st January, 1903’ that the Eoids Commissioners saw no objection to the proposal. On the 21st January, 1904, the Government of India embodied in a furthei despatch the conclusions arrived at by the Viceroy and the Naval Commander-in-chief on the East India Station, after Lord Curzons tour in the Persian Gulf, as to the selection of naval positions. Amongst other recommendations it was proposed that, in order to &gt; prevent any foreign flag being planted in the harbours of the Musandim Peninsula, Elphinstone Inlet should be reoccupied. It was suggested that the best way of effecting this reoccupation would be to erect a'’flagstaff on the isthmus which commands Eiphinstone and Malcolm Inlets and on Telegraph Island, in the former inlet. It was also proposed, on the advice of the Admiral, that a flagstaff should be planted on Sheep Island, in the anchorage of Khor Kawi, on the western side of the peninsula, which is not only very commodious, but which might, it was suggested, some dav be useful as a coaling station. In a Beport dated December 1903 Bear-Admiral Atkinson-Willes had furnished details of Khor Kawi :— The Khor appears capable of sheltering several large cruisers besides a number of small craft. Its strategical position is excellent, and, in con junction with the Islands of Kishm, Henjam, Larak, and Hormuz, it will form a strong position for the control of the entrance to the Gulf.” On the 26th November, 1904, the Viceroy reported that the flagstaffs had been erected. On learning that the flagstaffs had been erected on the sites in question, the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty demurred to the action which had been taken. They formulated their objections in the following terms:— “My Lords cannot admit that the fact of their having offered no objection to the proposal to reoccupy Telegraph Island by placing there a Native Agent in charge of a hritish flag can be held to cover their unsolicited acquiescence in the proposed further distribution of flagstaffs in the district, one being on the mainland. ‘‘ 1 he original proposal was simply a case of reverting to a state of things which had previously existed without question, to the renewal of which there was a reasonable answer in the event of objections being raised by European Powers, and in which here could be no question of territorial expansion, as the so-called island is nothing but a rock. As regards the other flagstaffs, it is a very different matter, and my Lords felt hat if the flag was not intended to denote British territorial expansion, it not only meant nothing, but was a possible source of international complication.” [376] 2 N136 Appendix 2.— Part II. In view of this expression of opinion the question was submitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence, and their decision was conveyed to the Government of India in a despatch dated the 19th May, 1905. It was to the effect that the hoisting of flags was open to the objection that it would not confer upon this country any special rights in the places selected, unless it were accompanied by a specific proclamation of protectorate or annexation. On the other hand, an open assertion of British claims to these places might excite the jealousy of other Powers, and give rise to political complications. His Majesty’s Government preferred to adhere to the alternative method of making it clear that they would not tolerate the occupation by any foreign Power of any port or territory in the Persian Gulf, and, in this connection, attention was directed to Lord Lansdowne’s declaration, made in the House of Lords on the 5th May, 1903, that “ we should regard the establishment of a naval base or of a fortified port in the Persian Gulf bv any other Power as a very great menace to British interests, and we should certainly resist it with all the means at our disposal.” In these circumstances, His Majesty’s Government had arrived at the conclusion that the flagstaff's on Sheep Island and the Maklab Isthmus should be abandoned, while, in view of the result of Mr. Lorimer’s recent inquiries, which tended to confirm the claim of the Sultan of Muscat to sovereignty over the territory in question, the Govern ment of India were requested to furnish their views as to the maintenance of the flagstaff on Telegraph Island, which had been the site of the original cable station. The Government of India replied in their despatch of the 26th September, 1907, that the flagstaff might conceivably be useful in certain circumstances, having regard to the German desire for an increase of influence in the Gulf, and for a telegraph line to the east; and as neither the Sultan of Muscat nor any foreign Power had ever taken exception to its existence, it seemed very improbable that any international complications would arise from its main tenance in the future. The Government of India had already given it as their opinion that the erection of the flagstaff could not be regarded as con travening in any way the provisions of the Treaty of 1862, which binds both England and Prance not to trench on the independence of the Sultan of , Muscat; and, in these circumstances, they recommended that no action should be taken beyond merely leaving the flagstaff on Telegraph Island where it was. No decision has yet been arrived at on this recommendation. The flagstaffs on Sheep Island and Maklab Isthmus were actually removed in October 1905. In October 1907 an Inter-Departmental Committee, consisting of three delegates from the Admiralty and representatives of the Foreign Office and India Office, was convened to report on the feasibility of the Germans securing an outlet for the Baghdad Bailway on the Persian Gulf independently of British co-operation. The Committee formed the opinion that such a consummation was feasible, and they concluded their Beport in the following terms:— “ We do not, however, feel confident that we possess the means absolutely to debar Germany from acquiring an outlet on the Gulf; and this outlet, though at first com mercial, might eventually be transformed into a strategic base, but by steps so gradual and clandestine as to render protests difficult or impracticable. In these circumstances we cannot but express the opinion that it is in the highest degree desirable to come to terms with the promoters of the railway. “ Finally, we would advocate that all steps which His Majesty’s Government may consider feasible should be taken to consolidate the advantages we already possess at the entrance to the Persian Gulf, notably at Musandim Peninsula (where the harbour accommodation and water supply are adequate) and at the Islands of Kishm and Henjam.” The Admiralty stated, in a letter dated the 9th November, 1907, that “ their Lordships concur in the Beport of the Committee, and they consider that, from a naval standpoint, it is most desirable that effect should be given at once to the Committee’s particular recommendations relating to the steps to be taken by His Majesty’s Government in the establishment of a definite position .... at the entrance to the Persian Gulf.” The Government of India suggested in their despatch of the 21st January,Political.— (a.) Muscat, including Musandim Peninsula. 137 190 L&lt;, that it might be found desirable to erect a lighthouse on Musandim Peninsula. Further correspondence on the subject took place in the course of the year, and was forwarded to the Foreign Office in the India Office letter of the 29th September, 1904. It appeared that the Government of India were ol opinion that the light might be placed either on the rocky point of Cape Musandim or on one of the islands called the Quoins that are situated at a little distance from it; they considered that there were political advantages in placing the light upon a point oi the peninsula, and they were accordingly disposed to prefer this locality. The British India Steam Navigation Company, who were consulted on the subject, expressed the view that a lighthouse at the extremity of the Musandim Peninsula would be of considerable help to shipping. They recommended that it should be constructed on Cape Musandim rather than on one of the Quoins Islands, provided that the land south of the point would not render the light invisible to ships proceeding up the Gulf. On the 21st September, 1904, the Viceroy telegraphed to inquire whether it would be possible to secure the services of an expert through Trinity House to examine the scheme and also to report on the general question of the lighting of the Persian Gulf. This telegram was referred to the 1 oreign Office for Ford Fansdowne’s observations, but action appears to have been suspended upon it until the question of the flagstaffs at Musandim had been settled, and, as the ultimate decision in regard to the latter was that they should be removed, the lighthouse question appears to have been allowed to drop. The erection of a lighthouse might be of considerable service, both Lighthouse, nautical and political, at Musandim. With regard to the erection of lights and the improvement of harbours in general, the British Besident in 'the Persian Gull has expressed the view that, apart from their utilitarian aspect, they would undoubtedly do much to strengthen our already predominant position. The subject will be reverted to in Part III of this Memorandum (see p. 178). If a lighthouse is built at Musandim a wireless telegraphy station might Wireless likewise be established. This would be of much advantage to passing Telegraphy, vessels for purposes of signalling, and it is worthy of consideration whether similar stations should not he established at Bassidu, Bahrein, and on Kubbar Island, near Koweit, and wireless installations supplied to His Majesty’s ships in the Persian Gulf, with a view to the easier and more effective suppression of piracy. (b.) The Trucial Chiefs.* The British Government maintain no Political Officer in “ Trucial” territory, but a Native Agent in the employ of the Bushire Residency is stationed at Shargah, and moves from place to place as is required. The so-called “ Trucial Chiefs,” who rule over the Jowasmi, A1 hu Ali, and Beni Yas tribes, are six in number, and they respectively reside at Bas-el-Kheimah, Amulgavine, Ajman, Shargah, Dabai, and Abu Dthabi. All these places are situated on the Pirate Coast, which is part of the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf, and extends from a point between Tibba and Shuam to El Odeid. The Sheikh of Shargah also claims authority over the coast-line on the Gulf of Oman from Khor Kalba as far as Pas Dibba, on the ground that it is part of the territories of the Jowasmi tribe. These Chiefs are called the “ Trucial Chiefs ” on account of the Treaties Aitchison’s Treaties of Maritime Truce concluded with them between 1835 and 1853, by which vol. x. their internecine strife upon the sea was stopped. They are all new independent, and, since the isolation of the Wahabees in the highlands, they have been exempted from the tribute or blackmail for the payment of which they were formerly directly or indirectly liable to the Wahabee Chief of Nejd. In the beginning of last century an expedition was sent to the Persian * A Report on this subject by Colonel Kemball will be found in Persia and Arabia,” Part 12, p. 343 (March 1903).138 Appendix 2. Gulf to punish the Jowasmi for certain aggressions on British ships, and to co-operate with the Imam of Muscat, who was then at war with them. The expedition resulted in the conclusion of a Treaty in February 1806, binding them to respect the flag and property of the British, and to assist vessels touching on their coast. This Treaty appears to have been concluded without reference to the Wahabees. The spread of the Wahabees in Oman soon threatened the Ruler of Muscat with destruction, and the British Government determined to support him, and to destroy the piratical fleets as the only means of preserving the peace of the Gulf. A strong force was dispatched in 1809, which took Ras-el-Kheimah and other places and destroyed the boats of the pirates. Notwithstanding these measures, piracy increased to an intolerable extent, and an expedition was therefore dispatched to the Persian Gulf, under Sir W. Grant Keir, in 1819 for the purpose of completely crushing them. In 1820 the first general Treaty was signed between the British Govern ment and the Chiefs, and of these or similar Agreements there have been in all no fewer than eight. In 1839 the Maritime Truce was concluded, and was renewed from time to time until the year 1853, when it was succeeded by the Treaty of Perpetual Peace, which lias lasted ever since. Under that Treaty it was provided that there should be a complete cessation of hostilities at sea between the subjects of the signatory Chiefs, and a “ perfect maritime truce for evermore”; that, in the event of aggressions by any one by sea, the injured parties should not retaliate, but should refer the matter to the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, and that the British Government should watch over the peace of the Gulf and insure at all times the observance of the Treaty. In 1892 a further Treaty was concluded separately with each of the Trucial Chiefs, by which they agreed (1) not to enter into any Agreement or correspondence with any Power other than the British Government; (2) not to consent to the residence in their territories of the Agent of any other Government without the assent of the British Government; (3) not to cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation any part of their territory save to the British Government. So long ago as 1823 Captain McLeod, reporting on the Jowasmi tribe (being then at Ras-el-Kheimah and Shargah), described them as “ possessing no articles of export, since their pearls are generally purchased by merchants on the spot, and the produce of their country is not even sufficient for their maintenance. Their only employment is fishing, diving for pearls, and importing dates, grain, and other necessaries of life, which they purchase with the price of those pearls. They are very poor, and perhaps can never find much employment in commerce unless in carrying for others, although it is said they at one time possessed a very extensive trade.” Lieutenant (now General Sir Arnold) Kemball, writing in 1845, remarked:— “ Upon the success of the pearl-fishing and the profits of the carrying trade which it brings into operation must depend the means of obtaining the positive necessaries of life and those trifling luxuries desirable to an Arab. It is needless to observe how materially their own condition, and, by an easily deduced corollary, the safety of the Gulf, might be affected by the failure of a single season. Hence the anxiety and care attended with great expense which has been devoted by our Government to the maintenance of perfect tranquillity and security on the pearl banks.” In his Report dated April 1863 on the tribes of the Persian Gulf, Colonel Pelly, who was for many years British Resident, wrote as follows :— “ The settlements of these tribes are mainly dependent for subsistence upon the proceeds of their pearl-divings; they possess little territory. As to the pearl banks, these are held in common by the tribes, and thousands of boats collect there during the diving season to keep the peace Men must export what they can produce or spare, or else they must go without imports ; if men situate like these Arabs do not export salt fish and pearls, they must either turn pirates or starve.”Part II.

Bombay possession of the Portuguese, who were eventually deprived of if by^ TOl '^' dependent feheikh of hJejd. During part of the seventeenth century, and for thp Ve f T 5 ars - m ot the ^'hteenth, Bahrein paid tribute to the Shah of Persia. ith the death of Karim Khan in 1779 the influence ot Persm began to wane, and the petty Chiefs of the Gulf, whose lawlessness had been controlled by the strong hand of Nadir Shah and his immediate successors, were soon involved in contests for superiority. A section of the Arab tribe of Uttoobees, which had been already settled at Ziobara for some years, and had increased so rapidly in wealth and power as to be virtually independent, took advantage of the disturbed state of ans to attack Bahrein in 1782. In the following year they accomplished the subjugation of the island, of which, under varying fortunes, they have retained possession ever since. , j v C Under the resolute rule of Syed Sultan, the influence of Muscat had been steadily increasing, and in 1799, at the instance of the Beglerbeg of rars, the Imam fitted out an expedition which ended in the reduction of ■Bahrein and the deportation of members of the leading families to Muscat. i G i W , e . sca P e d w ere not slow to make overtures to the Wahabees, and in ioUl by their aid recovered the island. The influence of Syed Sultan proved, indeed, on his death to have een no more than personal; the ascendency in the Gulf was left with the aha bees, and the Uttoobees, no less than the other Chiefs of the littoral, were for some years completely under their control. In 1805, however, they ired of their allegiance, and were also disinclined to share in the piratical L 3 ^ 6 ] 2 O 1799 180 U 1805.140 Appendix 2. 1815. 1820. 1822. Mr. G. Willock, No. 1, January 25, 1822. schemes which the Wahabees systematically encourasred. Their Sheikhs accordingly inquired from the British Resident in the Gulf whether if they retired from the mainland, and withheld their allegiance from the Wahabees, the British Government would supply them with a vessel or two, so as to enable them to remain undisturbed at Bahrein. The Resident recommended that the request should be granted, but the Bombay Government declined to interfere in the matter. In 1815 the Imam of Muscat attacked the island, but was repulsed with great loss. At this time tbe Uttoobees had so far departed from their former policy as to encourage pirates to resort to their ports in order to dispose of their plunder. In 1820 General Keir negotiated a Treaty with the brother Chiefs Suliman and Abdulla, who then ruled over the island, stipulating that every possible discouragement should be given to pirates, and admitting them to the benefit of the general Treaty with the friendly Arabs concluded about the same time. In 1822 an Agreement was made by the British Resident at Bushire with the Prince of Shiraz, recognizing Bahrein as a dependency of the Province of Fars. This Agreement was entirely contrary to the views of the Government at Bombay, and letters were written to the Prince of Shiraz disavowing the Treaty in strong terms and announcing the recall of Captain Bruce. l\ot only did the Indian Government disavow the Treaty, but Mr. G. Willock, British Representative at Tabreez, reported that— “ Mirza Baugur, Anhie, who had been deputed to Court to obtain the ratification of the Treaty, did not meet with a favourable reception; and His Majesty the Shah, whilst refusing his accordance to the stipulations, expressed his displeasure that the Prince of Shiraz should have entered into any engagements with the British Government without his knowledge and injunctions.” Mr. Grant Duff, No. 247, September 26, 1906. 1825. 1831. 1839. . 1845. The Treaty Avas therefore not ratified either by the Shah or by the Government of India. This is an important point, since as late as 1906 the Persian Government based their claim to Bahrein on the Treaty of lb22. In 1824 the British Government mediated with success between Bahrein and the kindred house of Rahman-bin-Jaubir of Demaum. In the following year Suiiman died, and was succeeded by his son Khalifa, but the latter’s uncle, Abdulla, managed to retain all real power in his own hands. The Imam of Muscat was in favour of active intervention on behalf of Khalifa ; the Governor of Bombay warned him of the evils which would flow from such a step, but his advice proved unavailing. As, however, Khalifa was prompt in his opposition to the common enemy, the Imam was utterly routed, and the IJttoobees, elated by success, took the initiative, and protested their unwillingness to agree to any terms of peace which were not guaranteed by the British Government; finally, in 1831, the desultory warfare w r hich had ensued fizzled out from inanition. In 1839, on the irruption of the Egyptian army into Nejd, Sheikh Abdulla won over the Commander, by the promise of an annual tribute, to undertake that he would not encroach on Bahrein. The British Government, who at this time were watching with anxiety the progress of the Egyptian troops, expostulated with the Sheikh on the way in which he was sacrificing his independence; he admitted, in answer, that he would be prepared to drop all further connection with the Egyptian Pasha and “avow himself a dependent of Great Britain ” in return for a guarantee of protection. The speedy withdrawal of the Egyptian army from Nejd made any further negotiations on this subject unnecessary. The dissensions amongst the various members of the ruling family of Bahrein had by this time reached such a pitch as to give the greatest cause of anxiety for the safety of the Gulf. jK halifa' died in 1834, and was succeeded by his son Mahomed. Between the latter and his great-uncle, Sheikh Abdulla, there had always been jealousy, and in a short time civil war broke out, and finally led to the discomfiture of Abdulla and his expulsion from the island. In 1845 the British Government exerted their influence at Bahrein,Part II. Political.—( c.) Bahrein. 141 when they objected to the interference of Persia, and ordered the exiled Sheik!i Abdulla to abstain from disturbing the peace of the Gulf. In 1847 the ruling Sheikh, Mahomed-bin-Khalifa, offered allegiance to 1847. Great Britain, which, however, was refused, though he was assured of the continuance of the good-will and friendship of the British Government. In lb4S Abdulla died, but the feud with the Khalifa family was 1818. vigorously maintained by his son, Mahomed-bin-Abdulla; and the history of the period which intervened up to the time (1859) that the latter was 1859 declared a public enemy and confined by the Government of India in the fort of Assurghur resembles in every essential the history of preceding davs. Piratical outrages were frequent; tiie Besident’s advice was asked only to be disregarded ; Agreements were broken as soon as made; trade languished j the common people were oppressed; the Whhabees, egged on by a restless ambition, aided and abetted Mahomed-bin-Abdulla; and, finally, when a descent on Bahrein was imminent, the British Government were compelled to expel the rival Sheikh from his asylum at Demaum. Shortly afterwards the ruling Sheikh, on being remonstrated with on account of certain lawless acts, declared his allegiance first to Persia and afterwards to Turkey. He was compelled by the British Besident to raise the blockade of the Wahabee ports which he had instituted, and, in 1861, a 1861. “ Perpetual Treaty of Peace and Priendship ” was concluded with him. By this the engagements entered into in 1820 were declared to be valid and in force, the Chief as “Independent Buler of Bahrein” bound himself to abstain from prosecuting war, piracy, and slavery by sea, and the British Government on their part engaged to maintain the security of his territory against foreign aggression. Her Majesty’s Government, having concluded this Treaty with the Sheikh as an independent ruler, informed the Persian Government of what Mr. Hertslet’s Memo- had taken place, and refused to concur in a proposal made by the Shah that randum of March 1874 &gt; the sovereignty of Bahrein should be transferred to the Persian Crown. Sir P * 13 ' H. Bawlinson, then Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, expressed in forcible 1869. terms how indispensable the maintenance of the Sheikh’s independence (of Persia) was “ to the successful working of those plans of maritime police in the Persian Gulf which we have been at so much pains and expense to establish.” In 1868, in consequence of the intrigues of the Persian Government, 1868. who had encouraged the piratical faction, it was necessary for the Indian Government to take forcible action against the offending Chiefs, and a naval demonstration took place. In November 1869 further measures had to be 1869. adopted, two of the Chiefs w T ere incarcerated in an Indian fortress, and, finally, Esa-bin-Ali, a member of the Khalifa family, was installed as ruling Sheikh of Bahrein, and has remained in power ever since. In ..870 the Government of India wrote a full despatch reviewing the history of the island and emphasizing the importance of allowing no Persian claims to sovereignty to pass without firm remonstrance. The Duke of Argyll, then Her Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for India, coucurred in this view. In the autumn of 1871, during the progress of the Turkish expedition 1871. against Nejd, the murder of a Turkish messenger by order of the Chief of Bahrein reopened the question of the Ottoman claim to the island. This claim Her Majesty's Government had already refused to recognize on three occasions, in 1839, 1851, and 1870. At the request of Her Majesty’s Ambas sador, the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs eventually repeated the verbal assurances, formerly given by Aali Pasha, that the Porte did not entertain any intention of obtaining supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, or the independent tiibes of Southern Arabia, nor contemplate any attack upon them. (Vide Sir H. Elliot’s despatch No. 399 of the 4th November, 1871.) In October 1873 a question arose regarding the enforced enlistment of natives of Bahrein into the Turkish army. A note was accordingly addressed to the Turkish Ambassador on the 14th April, 1874, which, after drawing his 1874. Excellency’s attention to previous communications, distinctly stated that Her Majesty’s Government did not admit the claim of Turkey to consider Bahrein as part of the Ottoman Dominions, and that, if natives of that island applied142 Appendix 2. 1888-9. Telegraphic, November 10, 1892. sador reminded the Porte that, Bahrein being under British proiection, Her Majesty's Government could not admit Turkish interference with the natives of the island. 1892. A landing of Turkish troops was again apprehended in 1892, hut the Porte was once more informed that British ships would oppose any such attempt. 1892. In 1892 an Agreement was made with the Chief of Bahrein providing against (1) conclusion of Treaties with foreign Powers, (2) residence of foreign Agents, (3) cession of territory. 1893. The question of British protection of Bahreinese in the Ottoman To Sir C.

In 1895 we forcibly dispersed, in the interests of the Bahrein Sheikh, a settlement of malcontents who had established themselves at Zobara, on the El Katr coast, under the Turkish flag. The Turks protested, but Her Majesty’s Government stated in reply that “ they did not recognize Turkish jurisdiction on the El Katr coast, and must repeat once more that all Turkish claims to Bahrein, which is under the protection of the Queen of England, are totally inadmissible.” The intervention of British Consuls in Turkey on behalf of Bahreinese was again insisted upon in li&gt;96. In 1898 the Indian Government formally recognized Sheikh Hamed as successor-designate to the Chiefship of the island. to British Consuls in Turkey for protection, the latter could not refuse their good offices on behalf of such persons. To Sir H. Layard, In June 1879 the British Ambassador at Constantinople was instructed No. 763, June 5, 1879. to make representations respecting a reported proposal to establish a Turkish Sir II. Layard, No. 504, coal dep6t at Bahrein, and to urge the Porte to disavow the project. Action was also taken by the Indian Government in order to induce the Sheikh of Bahrein, in the event of the proposal being made to him, to act upon the advice of the British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. An attempt was actually made in 1880 by a Turkish vessel to establish a coaling station at Bahrein, but was frustrated by the Sheikh, who refused permission for the undertaking. As a result of this incident, the Sheikh was induced to conclude a Treaty with the British Government by which he undertook to abstain from entering into negotiations with any other Power, and to refuse permission to any other Government to establish agencies or coaling depots on his territory. In 1888-9 the Turkish claim to Bahrein was reasserted and refuted The Ottoman Government were informed that any attempt to land on the island would be opposed by force {vide despatches No. 15 of the 26th January, 1888, and No. 121 of the 17th April, 1888, to Sir W. White). 1892. A question of British protection over Bahreinese in Turkey arose in 1892 To Sir 0.

In January 1905 the Government of India appointed Captain Prideaux, an officer of the regular political service, to succeed Mr. Gaskin, who was of lower official status. Subsequently they conferred upon Captain Prideaux the personal and local rank of Political Agent. An assistant surgeon was also appointed at this time, and, in addition to attending on the Agency staff, he is in charge of a hospital, recently erected at the cost of certain British Indian merchants, in com memoration of Her late Majesty Queen Victoria; a guard, consisting of four officers and twenty-four sepoys, was stationed in the island ; and a launch was provided to enable the Agent to visit the outlying portions of his charge, and for service in the suppression of piracy in the shallower water which a British gun-boat cannot reach. The use of the launch will confirm our title to police the pearl banks.143 Part II. Political.—( c.) Bahrein. The reason for these measures was explained by the Government of India in a despatch dated the 21st April, 1904: — The protection of the British Government had converted the island from a scene of chronic external aggression and intestine feud into a relatively peaceful and flourishing centre of industry and commerce; but, secure in the gratuitous enjoyment of the benefits thus conferred upon him, and oblivious of the past vicissitudes of the Khalifa family, the Chief had been induced, by the very moderation of the British Government, to the belief that his relations with them were of a kind involving no corresponding obligations on his part. The incorrectness of the Sheikh s attitude had been conspicuously noticeable in connection with the question of the customs revenues (a point dealt with under a separate heading of this Memorandum). The Government of India weie not then disposed on this account to have recourse to coercive measures, in the hope that the object in view would be effected by means which, if slower, might not prove less effective. They apprehended that the Sheikh would not be slow to recognize the significance of the means in question, and that a suitable officer would be able to bring pressure to bear in connection with the customs question or any other matter. Apart, however, from affairs of domestic interest, the need for a more definite assertion of our position had recently come into greater prominence owing to the establish ment of an enterprising German trader on the island, and by reason of the growing interest in this quarter displayed by foreigners of other nationalities. 1904. Ihe expectations of the Government of India as to the reformation of the Sheikh were unfortunately destined to be disappointed, and his incapacity as a Ruler found concrete expression in disturbances which took place in November 1904, when a German clerk was assaulted and several Persians India, offi™ were wounded. November 29, 1904. In the case of the German, as a result of the action of the British Agent, India Office, full compensation was paid and condign punishment publicly inflicted. As Jan uary 18, 1905. to the Persians, the Sheikh remained obdurate, and a naval demonstration took place. A Memorandum of demands—including payment of a fine, the lOO') banishment of certain individuals, the formation of a guard for the bazaar, aj • , ’ and an admission that sukhra, or forced labour, should not be imposed on 1905 ^ lj foreigners—was presented to the Sheikh, and acceptance of it was enforced. India' Office, October 20 1905. On the 27th July, 1904, the French Ambassador communicated a private iqoa Memorandum to Lord Lansdowne, suggesting that, as French citizens had established themselves at Bahrein for the purpose of pearl-fishing, the catTbTM I C C0 T mUIli ' jurisdiction of the French V ice-Consul at Bushire should be extended to July 27 , 1904. that island. The India Office were disposed to agree to the proposal, provided the India Office, August 31, French Vice-Consul addressed his representations to the British Political 1904 - Agent. On this point the Government of India stated that they would only India Office, recognize the French Vice-Consul at Bushire as Vice-Consul for Manama September 8, 1904 (Bahrein) on the clear understanding (1) that his exequatur be obtained from His Majesty’s Government; (2) that his dealings be with the British Political Officer alone; (3) that he should acquire no extra-territorial jurisdiction. The Government of India further stated that they preferred postponement of the question until our position as regards the pearling banks had been established, especially as it had been raised in connection with the proposed pearling enterprise of the French, to which the Arabs objected. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf stated that, subject to Inclosure in India the conditions suggested by the India Office, the appointment would perhaps Office, October 15 , 1904. be a useful recognition of our quasi British Protectorate over Bahrein; and be should for this reason have recommended acceptance, if the motive had not been the admitted desire of French merchants to gain access to the pearl fisheries. The Government of India were of opinion that the best solution was to drop the question, and this seems to have been done. 2 P [376]144 Appendix 2. 1898. Government of India’s despatch of April 21, 1904. India Office, June 8, 1904. 1900. 1901; 1903. 1904. 1906. 1907. Bahrein Customs. The administration of the Customs at Bahrein, which is a minor centre of the arms traffic, has for a considerable time engaged the anxious attention of the Government of India. They are at present leased to and farmed by British Indian Banias. So far back as 1 898, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf broached the subject with the Chief, who gave Colonel Meade to understand that he would not renew the farmer’s lease without first communicating with him. Despite this understanding, the lease was subsequently extended for a period of two years. Shortly afterwards the Sheikh again promised not to enter into any fresh contract without first informing the Resident. But in January 1900 Colonel -Meade reported that the Sheikh had again departed from his engagements, and had prolonged the lease for a further term of two years, without previous intimation. A remonstrance was made, and the Chief expressed regret; but, nevertheless, when in 1901, at the instance of Sir N. O’Conor, it was again suggested that he should employ a British subject to supervise the Customs, he once more declined to accede to the wishes of His Majesty’s Government. On the occasion of his tour in the Persian Gulf in 1903, the Viceroy spoke seriously about the matter to the Chief, and pointed out to him the necessity of a change in the existing arrangements. The Sheikh asked for time for reflection; but this only resulted in his reasserting his unwillingness to redress the abuses which had called forth complaints. The conclusions formulated on the subject by the Government of India are indicated in their despatch of the 21st April, 1904:— “ The need for reform is clearly indicated by the figures given in Colonel Kemball’s letter. The Chief’s present income from his Customs is 1,16,200 rupees, while the revenue which may be expected under an efficient system is estimated at 3,50.000 rupees. The practicability of the change is proved by the example of Muscat, where, in partial compliance with our wishes, the Sultan has taken the Customs administration under direct management, and has already reaped considerable benefit from the arrangement. The matter is obviously one to which we cannot remain indifferent. Committed, as we are, to the support of Sheikh Hamed, it is incumbent on us to take measures to insure that, on his accession, he may find his house in order, and may not be burdened with a heavy legacy of debt accumulated by the improvidence of his predecessor. For this reason we consider that the question is not one which can be allowed to drop, even if it were possible to overlook the Sheikh’s repeated breaches of faith and his persistently contumacious attitude with regard to it. In fact, the reform of the Customs administra tion of Bahrein has become a test case of the nature and degree of the influence which the British Government may reasonably claim to exercise over the Ruler of those islands.” In August 1906 a further attempt was made b)/ the Resident to induce the Sheikh to intrust the collection of the customs to the Government of India for a specific sum, in place of farming them out to the Bania-British Indian contractors. He declined to adopt this course, and the matter was temporarily allowed to drop. It is suggested that the real ground of the refusal is to be found in the fact that Bahrein is the centre of a large smuggling trade. Judicial Powers exercised by the Political Agent at Bahrein. The Government of India raised this subject in their despatch of the 14th November, 1907, which is now under consideration, and of which the following is an extract:— “ the Agent has at present the powers of a Magistrate of the 1st class, as described in ‘The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898,’ in respect of offences committed by native Indian subjects of His Majesty in the Island of Bahrein and on the southern shores of the Persian Gulf. He also extends his good offices* to European foreigners in any disputes between them and the Chief of Bahrein or his subjects. * Vide Secret despatch from Secretary of State, dated June 21, 1901.145 Part II. Political.—( c.) Bahrein. Next, he holds a Court, composed of himself and a representative of the Chief, for the tiial of cases in which the accused is a Bahrein suhiect or a foreigner who prefers not to invoke British good offices, and the other party is a British or foreign subject who does so. . . &lt;£ Pinall} , he controls a local Court of Arbitration for the adjustment of civil disputes between British subjects and proteges, on the one hand, and Bahrein subjects or persons of any other nationality, on the other hand. This Court has been in existence for ever fiftv years. He also, on occasions, issues hills of health, signs marine protests, and legalizes signatures on behalf of British Indian subjects. Strictly speaking however, he has no legal authority for undertaking these latter duties. ith a view to define and regularize the powers exercised over British subjects by the Agent, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has put forward the suggestion that he should be appointed to be a Justice of the Peace and endowed with the powers of a District Judge in direct subordi nation to the High Court of Bombay. We concur in this recommendation but, v ith i efeience to clause 2 of ‘ Hie Indian Poreign Jurisdiction Order in Council, 1902, we understand that it would first he necessary for Bahrein to be declared by His Majesty in Council to he a territory in which jurisdiction is exercised by, or on behalf of, His Majesty through the Governor-General in Council. We would accordingly request that, if His Majesty’s Govern ment see no objection, the necessary Order in Council may be passed providing for the exercise of jurisdiction in Bahrein. “ P ut further, in view of the increase of foreign shipping and foreign interest generally in the Gulf, and of the establishment of foreign firms and missions in Bahrein, which has already caused practical difficulties, it seems desirable that, if possible, in maintenance of the status quo in the Gulf, provision should he made in the Order in Council for the exercise hv the Political Agent of jurisdiction over foreigners in Bahrein, before foreign interests have so largely developed as to render the assumption of the legal duties of a Protecting Power a matter of greater intricacy and difficulty, involving, perhaps, as in the case of Zanzibar, diplomatic representations to foreign Powers. Bahrein has been under sole British domination since 1820, and on several occasions we have had to interfere by armed force, either to prevent the Chief of Bahrein from attacking his neighbours, or them from attacking him. or to settle matters relating to the Chiefship. ’ In 1880, by a Treaty published for public information, the Sheikh bound himself to abstain from making Treaties of any sort with any State or Government other than the British, and to refuse to permit other Powers to establish Diplomatic or Consular Agencies or coaling depots without the consent of the British Government. This Treaty in itself constituted a sort of protectorate, which has pci haps been lipened into maturity by the open and regular exercise of protectorate powers, more especially in the recent cases of attacks on Persian and German subjects in Bahrein “ -H His Majesty’s Government consider it feasible in the circumstances to assume jurisdiction over foreigners in Bahrein, we would recommend that this should be done, and also that the Order in Council should, if possible, be so framed as to enable the Political Agent to perform the functions of a notary public.” Summary. The political position at Bahrein may he summarized as follows: His Majesty’s Government have repudiated the Persian claim to sovereignty nine times—in 1822, 1825, 181*4, 1848, 1861, 1862, 1869, 1906, and 1907, and the Turkish claim nineteen times—in 1839, 1851, 1870, 1874 (twice), 1875, 1876, 1879, 1888, 1892 (twice), 1893 (three times), 1895 (twice), 1896, and 1905 (twice); while in 1871 the Grand Vizier of Turkey gave a formal assurance “ that the Porte entertained no intention whatever of obtaining the supremacy over Bahrein.” On the other hand, His Majesty’s Government have themselves had direct relations with Bahrein since 1805; these relations have become146 Appendix 2. Jurisdiction over Foreigners. Administrative Reforms. Customs Control. Financial Reform. Public Works. increasingly intimate in character, and have found concrete expression in a series of Treaties concluded in 1820, 1847, 1856, 1861, 1868, 1880, and 1892, and having as their objects the suppression of piracy and the Slave Trade* the regularity of the succession to the throne, the protection of the island against foreign control or aggression, and the assertion of British pre dominance. His Majesty’s Government have repeatedly, and with increasing authority, intervened in the internal affairs of the island, notably in 1845, in 1859 when the rival Sheikh was incarcerated in an Indian fortress, in 1861 in 1869 when a naval demonstration took place, in 1898 to recognize the ruling Sheikh’s son as successor-designate to the Chiefship, and again in 1904-5 forcibly to effect the punishment of offenders who had assailed German and Persian subjects, and to remove certain abuses affecting public security and the welfare of foreigners. Moreover, in virtue of the Treaty of 1861, the British Agent has exercised important judicial powers in the island for over fifty years; for nearly a century the safety of the pearl industry, of which Bahrein is the centre, has been assured by British ships; and British Consular protection has been regularly afforded to Bahreinese in Turkey and in Persia. It would now seem to be matter for serious consideration whether the time has not arrived to regularize the position at Bahrein by a more definite assertion of British predominance. The Government of India, in their despatch already quoted (see p. 144), have set forth the arguments in favour of the exercise of jurisdiction over foreigners, and the advantages of adopting such a course before foreign interests have so largely developed as to render the assumption of the legal duties of a Protecting Power a matter of greater intricacy and difficulty. The question arises whether it would not he more practicable and be less likely to evoke hostile comment if the assumption of these duties (which would probably necessitate a notilication to foreign Powers) were accom panied by various administrative reforms, which, carried out under British control, would conduce to the general prosperity of commerce, check the traffic in arms which now exists, and gradually place the revenue of the Sheikh upon a more stable footing. That such reforms are desirable has been recognized by the Government of India in earlier despatches; unfortunately, though steps in the right direction have been taken, no substantial improvement has been effected since the Native Agent was succeeded by a British Agent in 1900. Writino* this year, Mr. Zwemer, an American missionary resident at Bahrein, asserted that— “Oppression, blackmail, and bribery are universal, and, except; in commerce and the Slave Trade, English protection has brought about no reforms in the island. To be ‘ protected ’ means here strict neutrality as to the internal affairs, and absolute dictation as to affairs with other Govern ments.” It is much to be regretted that the negotiations for the control of the customs proved abortive, and, in view of the increasing importance of Bahrein, it is worth while considering whether the Sheikh should not be offered a large subsidy in return for the customs, which, under British control, would, no doubt, give a far greater yield. It is eminently desirable in the inrerests of the island that the finances should be reformed, in order that certain public works, and more especially harbour accommodation and the construction of a pier, may be undertaken. The development of trade on any considerable scale is largely dependent upon the execution of such works. Moreover, it is incumbent upon the Government of India to take timely steps to provide against a deficit on the demise of the present Sheikh, to whose successor, Sheikh Hamed, they are committed. The Customs question has also separate importance in connection with the arms traffic. It should be Dome in mind that at one period Bahrein was renowned for its fertility, and that it is capable under wise government of becoming so again. It possesses an excellent water supply, and the climate is far more suited to Europeans than that of Kishm or Muscat. Situated about half-way147 Part II. Political.—( c.) Bahrein. between Cape Musandim and the mouth of the Shat-el-Arah, in geographical position it possesses advantages as a trade centre which are superior to those of any other place in the Gulf under present conditions. Some idea of the commerce of the island may he derived from the fact that the export of pearls from there was 475,000/. in 1901, and the total trade of Bahrein increased 30 per cent, between 1905 and 1906, when it reached 1,454,000/. exclusive of pearls. Of the steam tonnage entered in the port in 1906, British vessels represented 100,983 tons; American, 3,943; and German! 6,205. It a British “Commissioner” with commercial aptitudes could be appointed to control the customs and gradually to facilitate the establish ment of a trade emporium and of an open market, such action would go far to promote the commercial interests of this country. Moreover, such a state of affairs could not fail to attract in still greater numbers than at present the merchants of Lingah and other places, where the appearance of the Belgian Customs officials has given rise to much dissatisfaction. It appears very desirable to anticipate German action by opening a bank at Bahrein, and some Bombay house might be approached in this connection, Free Port under British Control. Bank. Balnein being the centre ol the pearl industry, and in close proximity to the coast of El Katif, which is infested with pirates, the installation of wireless telegraphic communication between the island and His Majesty’s Wireless ships would prove of value, while the commercial advantages of establishing Telegraphy, telegraphic intercourse with the outside world are apparent. Writing in 1904, Sir N. O Conor, who had been consulted in regard to Sir N. O’Conor, No. 511 the steps which were in contemplation for improving the status and position June 28,1904.’ of the British Agent, replied that he had felt strongly for some years past that we were losing the opportunity of asserting our supremacy at Bahrein, that he sincerely welcomed the proposals of the Government of India, and that he undertook that the Turkish Government should raise no serious difficulties. Sir Lewis Belly, writing in 1863, strongly advocated the establishment of a free port under British control in the Persian Gulf. He wrote as follows:— “ The case of Hormuz is a precedent for a like station ; the interferences, incertitude, and want of accurate knowledge of the market all round the Gulf point to the alleviation of these evils by the creation of a general entrepot at a convenient point, where all vessels would, if they pleased to call, find cargo ready, whereto all boats finding a favourable chance for exports from their several jurisdictions could run a cargo in a tew days, and whereto all trade might converge, as circumstances admitted, from ports subjected to sudden, hut not permanent, arbitrary interference. ‘ My respectful suggestion to Government is that the formation of a port so concentrating all our interests would do more to create and to develop the trade of the Gulf and Bussorah line, and would do more to keep the Government accurately informed as to their relations and the condition of commerce in the Gulf, and would further do more to keep the maritime Arabs quiet, and to afford an issue for whatever capabilities of trade may be possessed by Arabia, than could all the reports, all the figured statements, and all the amicable interviews of all the Residents and all the native authorities that ever had, or may have, place round these waters. But the port must be really free, and all tribes and people must know and feel it to be free, and that, once there, their goods and persons are secure and unmolested. Let the authorities of the port limit their functions to keeping the peace, removing obstacles, enforcing valid contracts, and punishing mercantile crime; for the rest, leave all to private enterprise, and leave trade free as the tide to flow in and out. I think that thus only can we practically test the commercial capabilities of the Gulf.”148 Appendix 2. Aitchison’s Treaties, vol. x. India Office, September 17, 1879.

Koweit, His Majesty’s Government have recognized continuous Turkish influence. On the other hand, it is north of El Odeid, to which, in 1878, the Sheikh of Abu Dthabi was allowed to assert his rights of possession, and which now forms the western limit of the territories of the Trucial Chiefs. The greater part of the country between El Katif and El Odeid is sparsely inhabited by Bedouin tribes who find pasturage there for their flocks. On the coast are fishing villages, such as Ujair, Zobara, Khor Hassan, El Bidaa, and Wakra, the most considerable being El Bidaa. The question of sovereignty over El Katr has never been definitely decided, and to some extent this region has been regarded as debatable land, between Oman on the one side and the Wahabee power on the other. At one time the Chief of Abu Dthabi is said to have exercised authority on the actual peninsula. Later the Uttobees, having settled there and at Bahrein, became paramount. These in turn had to pay religious tithe to the Wahabee Amir, who established a Governor of his own at El Bidaa, and threatened to occupy the Bahrein Islands in 1851. This was prevented by the appearance on the scene of British vessels of war, and an arrangement was come to by which the town of El Bidaa was restored to the Bahrein Chief. There was considerable correspondence in 1872 about a Turkish expedition to Nejd. As a result ihe Turks remained established in the El Hasa district, and at El Katif on the coast, while a military post was created at El Bidaa, and has been maintained there ever since. A question was raised at this time as to certain rights claimed by the Sheikh of Bahrein over the mainland coast, and in regard to the status of El Odeid. The British Resident, Colonel Felly, was of opinion that, while Bahrein should be acknowledged to possess certain rights in regard to pasturage, &amp;c., those rights should not be held as empowering the Sheikh to put to sea for the purpose of coercing any port in El Katr. He regarded El Odeid as properly belonging to Abu Dthabi. In a Memorandum by the Lev. Mr. Badger on Turkish claims to Oman, he wrote that the native annals of the province incontestably pro ye that it became independent of the Baghdad Khalifate in the tenth century, and had never since been subject to foreign rule except to the Persians for a short time lie went on to say that the same was true of the Arab Chiefdoms in the Persian Gulf, and that their independence was virtually admitted by Turkey in 1847. On the 7th May, 1883, Lord Granville wrote to Musurus Pasha that “ the claim of the Porte to rights of sovereignty over the El Katr Coast has never been admitted by Her Majesty’s Government.” In 1895 Her Majesty’s Government forcibly dispersed, in the interests of the Bahrein Sheikh, a settlement of malcontents who had established them selves at Zobara, on the El Katr Coast, under the Turkish flag (see p. 142). The Turks protested, but Her Majesty’s Government stated in reply that they did not recognize Turkish jurisdiction on the El Katr Coast {note verbale of the 12th August, 1895). The present position is, therefore, that we have refused to recognize Turkish authority in El Katr, although we have acquiesced in the continued presence of a Turkish post since 1872 at El Bidaa. We did, however, object to an attempt by the Turkish Government to appoint a Mudir at Wakra, a point south of El Bidaa ; and after considerable pressure they cancelled the appointment. The Government of India were not completely satisfied with this result, and desired to i*ound off their relations with the various Arab Chiefs by making an agreement with the leading Sheikh of El Katr. A formal Agreement was concluded in 1868 with the then Sheikh, by which he bound himself to take no hostile action by sea, and to refer all disputes to the British Resident. On the death of this Sheikh, his successor, Sheikh Jasim, applied for a renewal of tbe Agreement, but this was refused (in 1882) on the ground of the nature of his relations with the Turks. In 1901 the Government of India expressed forcibly their view that a Treaty should be negotiated with Sheikh Ahmed, in anticipation of the death of Sheikh Jasim, who had then reached an advanced age. An opportunityPolitical.— (cZ.) El Katr, or Guttur. 149 of making such a Treaty had arisen through the disturbance of the status quo by the Turkish Government, who had appointed officials to Wakra and other places on the coast. The Government of India at first proposed that a Treaty should be entered into with Sheikh Ahmed on the lines of the existing Treaties with Bahrein and the Trucial Chiefs, by which he would be debarred from parting with territory to others than the British Government. Although in deference to British remonstrances the Turkish Government had at length withdrawn their interloping officials, the Government of India remained'’of opinion that the position of Great Britain should be consolidated by the immediate conclusion with Sheikh Ahmed of a Treaty similar to the former one (of 1868), if the stricter form of Treaty with Bahrein and the Trucial Chiefs were held to be inadmissible. The principal reasons adduced in favour of this course were:— 1. The El Katr Coast, lying as it does been Bahrein and the Pirate Coast, constitutes a break in the continuity of British maritime influence. 2. 1 he absence of a Treaty does not facilitate, and may considerably increase, the work of His Majesty’s ships in suppressing piracy and maintaining the peace of the Gulf. In this connection it is observed that one objection to the extension of Turkish authority in those regions is the inability of the luiks to establish a strong Administration, which is eminently desirable in a distiict which, owing to its proximity to Bahrein—the centre of the pearl fisheties affords exceptional inducements to pirates and marauders. These considerations did not, however, overcome the disinclinations of Sir N. O'Conor, No. 516 His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, who was keenly alive to the June 28 A904. difficulties which such a course might provoke with the Ottoman Government. His Excellency laid stress upon the multiplicity of pending questions with Turkey, such as the energetic action being taken to secure the removal of the Turkish post from Bubiyan Island, and he was distinctly of opinion that, under existing circumstances, the conclusion of a Treaty as proposed would be inopportune. It was decided that the question should be submitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence, who do not appear to have recorded any definite opinion. In a Minute dated the 5th Eebruary, 1905, Eord Lansdowne wrote as follows:— “ I feel strongly that the time has come when all these questions should be considered, not as we have been in the habit of considering them—piece meal and as they arise—but as parts of a Persian Gulf policy, the principles of which should be carefully laid down for our guidance.” (e.) The Wahahees. To appreciate the present political conditions and recent history of Arabia it is necessary to go back to the year 1742, which marks the rise of the remarkable Wahabee movement, which was at the bottom of all the political changes that the peninsula has seen since that time. Colonel Belly alluded to the subject in the following terms :— “ It is this Nejd power, occupying the wide centre of Adnan Arabia, and composed of nomadic or only partially stationary Arab tribes, some now in revolt and some now used for quelling revolt, that threatens or dominates all round the shore-line from the back of the Euphrates and Shat-el-Arab, down along the Pirate Coast, and thence round Cape Musandim, alon^ Muscat, Oman, to Bas-el-Had, on the Aden line. “ It was a Kazee or Mullah of Bussorah, named Wahab, who (or whose son), permeating these tribes with the metamorphic agency of a religious idea, fused them into an aggressive mass, which, cropping out along the shore-lines of Muscat and the western coast of the Persian Gulf, compelled all these subdued tribes into plunder and piracy. Hence the once notorious appearance of the maritime Arabs as pirates; hence our expeditions to the west coast of the Gulf; and lienee the Itas-el-Kheimahs and Beni-bu-Alis blending with our colours. An Arab Sheikh endeavoured to explain to me150 Appendix 2. Aitchison, vol. x, p. 116. Lord Lansdowne to Sir N. O’Conor, October 1, 1901. Mr. Brodrick’s telegram of February 8, 1904. Sir N.

Viceroy’s telegram, May 20, 1904. the nature of this unenduring Wahabee power by likeninor it to the agency of Lord Clive in conquering India with a sepoy army. The leading tenets* of Wahab’s faith seem to have been those common to prophets, to proclaim himself and the unity of the Creator and kill or plunder his immortal creatures.” British Relations with the Wnhabees. [Communicated by the India Office.] In April 1866 the then Wahabee Amir, Imam Abdullah-bin-Fysul, entered into a voluntary engagement with the British Government (in the form of a declaration, which was not signed on our side), by which he bound himself— 1. ]STot to oppose or injure British subjects residing in territories under his authority. 2. Not to “ injure or attack the territories of the Arab tribes in alliance with the British Government, specially on the Kingdom of Muscat, further than in receiving the zukat that has been customary of old.” With the decline of the Wahabee power and the withdrawal of their influence from politics on the coast, the above engagement ceased to be of practical value, and all relations between the Wahabees and ourselves came to an end. It is worth recording that in October 1901, at a time of serious intertribal disturbances in the interior of Arabia, we came to an under standing with the Turkish Government that we would do what we could to discourage the Sheikh of Koweit from aggressive action, on the under standing that the Turks would endeavour to restrain the Amir of Nejd. The successes of the present W ahabee Amir, Abdul Aziz bin-Saoud, over his rival the Amir of Nejd (Abdul Aziz-bin-Rashid) again brought the Wahabee question to the front. In February ]904, when the Government of India were considering a proposal to send an Agent to Riadh, the Wahabee capital, for the purpose of collecting information on Central Arabian affairs, Mr. Brodrick telegraphed to the Viceroy as follows:— “ No steps should be taken to enter into closer relations with Nejd, or send Agents there, without previous sanction of His Majesty’s Government.” Sir N. O’Conor, who was consulted, while recognizing the advantages of obtaining fuller information as to affairs in the interior of Arabia, held that the moment was not opportune for the action suggested ; and to this opinion the Government of India, after receiving the views of Colonel Kemball, the Resident in the Persian Gulf, subscribed in a despatch dated the 24th March, 1904. They considered, however, that, in view of recent developments of the situation, there was reason to think that “ it may shortly be incumbent on us to take a more lively interest in the affairs of Central Arabia,” and they added that “later, .... when the political situation in Nejd has developed, and, above all, if the present representative of the Waliabee family .... succeeds in establishing and extending his ascendency, which from the latest accounts received seems to be not improbable, we think that it may be desirable again to enter into relations with our old ally.” The successes of Bin Saoud in April 1904 led the Turkish Government to send troops and guns to the assistance of Bin Rashid. Bin Saoud there upon wrote to the Resident in the Persian Gulf on the 2nd May, 1904, protesting against the Turkish invasion and soliciting the protection of Great Britain for himself and his country. At the same time, the Resident received from Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit a letter addressed to the latter by Bin Saoud, in which he hinted that, if he failed to obtain British protection, * What most offended the rigid monotheism of Wahab’s philosophy was the almost universal visitation of shrines, invocation of saints, and honour paid to the tomb of Mahommed. The use of the rosary, of jewels, wine, and tobacco were all abominations to be eschewed. 0u the other hand, the prophet married twenty wives, and died at the age of 95, after begetting eighteen children.Part II.

The most important of the Trucial nets, the Shiekh of Abu Dthabi, conferred personally with the Sultan of uscat on the situation, both rulers regarding the prospect of Bin Saoud’s visit with considerable apprehension. t 376 ] 2 It Lord Lansdowne to Sir N.

Major Cox to Govern ment of India, February 4, 1906. Sir N. O’Conor, March 20, 1906. Mr. Morley’s despatch, April 13, 1906. The Government of India addressed the Secretary of State on the subject in a despatch dated the 11th January, 1906, in which they pointed out “ how very serious to our prestige and influence the consequences might be if Bin Saoud should attack the Pirate Coast Chiefs or the Sultan of Muscat, or succeed in extending Ins influence over them, and how important it is that we should prevent, as far as lies in our power, such a contingency, especially now that the Wahabee Amir has recognized the suzerainty of the Sultan.'* They accordingly proposed that inquiry should be made, either through Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit or through the Sultan of Muscat, as to Bin Saoud’s intentions, with a view to ascertaining &lt;£ whether he is prepared to stand by the engagement of his predecessors not to oppose or injure British subjects residing in his territories, and not to interfere with the Arab tribes in alliance with the British Government ” ; and that, failing a satisfactory assurance on his part, he should he warned that interference in those localities would he regarded as an unfriendly act, and that “ suitable measures would be taken to frustrate it.’’ “ These measures,” the despatch concluded, “ might amount, in our opinion, to a more stringent embargo on the import of arms at Koweit and elsewhere on the Arabian coast of the Gulf, or even, in the case of an attack being imminent, to actual armed assistance from British ships to the Sheikhs threatened, as might he necessary.” In communicating this despatch to the Foreign Office, some doubt was expressed as to the practicability of the Government of India’s suggestions, and it was suggested that no steps should he taken, “ in the absence of any urgent necessity caused by Wahabee action,” until Sir N. O’Conor had been consulted on the proposal to approach Bin Saoud otherwise than through the medium of the Turks. Meanwhile, on the 19th January, 1906, Captain Knox, the Political Agent at Koweit, had talked the matter over informally with Mubarak, and after inquiring as to the truth of the reports regarding Bin Saoud’s intentions, gave the Sheikh a hint that any interference by the Wahabee Amir in the affairs of States in Treaty relation with us would not he likely to And favour with the British Government Mubarak replied that he regarded Bin Saoud’s plans as designed merely to extort money from the Sheikhs on the coast, and that he had himself written to Bin Saoud strongly advising him against persisting in any such attempt. Major Cox, in reporting this conversation to the Government of India, suggested that he should be authorized to inform all the Trucial Chiefs that the Government of India “ would not regard with complacency the intrigues of any of them with Bin Saoud.” The Government of India telegraphed on the 15th March, 1906, supporting Major Cox’s suggestion, wdiich was approved, with the concur rence of the Foreign Office, by Mr. Morley’s telegram dated the 9th April. As regards the warning to Bin Saoud contemplated by the Government of India, the Foreign Office adopted the views of Sir N. O’Conor, who had been consulted and had recommended in a despatch dated the 20th March, 1906, that any such warning should be conveyed direct to Bin Saoud, and not through the agency of the Sheikh of Koweit or the Sultan of Muscat. Sir N. O’Conor further suggested that Bin Saoud, in the event of his visiting the coast, should he met by a British vessel of war at one of the places which he proposed to visit, and told that no tampering with the engagements and Conventions of the Trucial Chiefs would he permitted. In conveying the decision of His Majesty’s Government to the Govern ment of India, the Secretary of State wrote as follows in a despatch dated the 13th April, 1906 :— “ His Majesty’s Government accept the view that a warning to the Amir would he necessary if he were to carry out his reported intention. They consider, however, that it would be better that such warning should be conveyed to him only in the event of his appearing upon the coast, and that it should then be conveyed to him directly as proposed by Sir N. O’Conor.” Bin Saoud’s reply to Mubarak’s letter of advice was communicated to Major Cox to Govern- ^ ie Folitical Agent, Koweit, on the 25th February, 1906. Major Cox ment of India, April 5, described it as a “ very courteous response.” The terms of Bin Saoud’s lfJ06 - letter, as translated from the vernacular, are obscure, but his apparent objectPart II. Political.—( e.) The Wahabees. 153 was to disclaim any intention of objectionable action. As a matter of fact, Bin Saoud did not visit the Pirate Coast. In April 1906 news Avas received of the defeat and death of Bin Bashid at the hands of his rival, Bin Saoud. On the 10th September, 1906, Major Cox again raised the question of entering into closer relations with the interior of Arabia. He drew attention to ove rtures that had been made by and on behalf of Bin Saoud with a view to the establishment of a closer connection between himself and the British Government, and recommended that the opportunity should be taken to come to terms with the Wahabee Chief on the folloAving grounds :— 1. That overtures had been made at various times by Bin Saoud himself, and by Sheikh Jasim-bin-Thani of Katr and Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit on Bin Saoud’s behalf, with a view to securing for the latter some measure of British protection, and that if we neglected these overtures Bin Saoud and his following might regard us with hostility. 2. That if a friendly understanding were to exist between the British Government and Bin Saoud, both the Sultan of Muscat and the Trucial Chiefs would be fortified by the knowledge that any attempt on the part of the Wahabee to make a descent upon Oman would involve a preliminary rupture between him and the British Government. 3. That if Bin Saoud Avere our friend he would be able to assist us in suppressing piracies in the northern part of the Gulf. 4. That such a friendly understanding would facilitate Major Cox’s dealings with the Trucial Chiefs, and would render it possible for our officers to make occasional tours in the Nejd country. 5. That the Arabs of Central Arabia, apparently driven to desperation by Turkish interference, seemed disposed to make common cause to throw off the yoke, and Avere apparently trying to secure the support of the Sheikh of Koweit and even of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. Bealizing, however, that they were not strong enough to stand alone, they saAV the necessity of enlisting the support of a Christian Power, and if we did not respond they might approach some other Power. It may be explained that, in addition to the overtures of Sheikh Mubarak and Sheikh Jasim, the subject had also been broached by an emissary of Bin Saoud himself, one Musaad-bin-Suweilim, who arrived at Bahrein in January 1906 and informed the British Agent there that Bin Saoud now felt himself strong enough to turn the Turks out of Hassa and Katif, and then wished to enter into Treaty relations Avich the British Government, allowing us, if Ave desired, to keep a Political Officer in Hassa or Katif in return for our protecting him trom a sea attack by the Turks. Major Cox’s letter of the 16th September, 1906, Avas sent home for information in the ordinary course, without comment, in October 1906. On the 9th November Mr. Morley informed the Government of India by telegram that “ His Majesty’s Government maintain view that their interest and influence should be confined to coast.” “ No steps,” the telegram added, “ should be taken to enter into relations with Nejd or to send Agents into interior Avithout my previous sanction.” Bin Saoud lost little time in renewing his application. In October 1906 he sent a further message through Sheikh Jasim, in which his proposals were set forth in greater detail. This message, which was delivered by Sheikh Jasim to the interpreter of the British Political Agent, Bahrein, Avas thus reported by Captain Prideaux on the 17th November, 1906 : — •‘The resources of Nejd are stated to have been strained to the utmost by the recent internecine wars, and Bin Saoud considers that the oases of Hassa and Katif were always the most profitable possessions of his Wahabee ancestors. He is anxious, therefore, to recover the two districts, and he proposes that a secret understanding should be arranged between the British Government and himself, under which he should be granted British protection from Turkish assaults at sea, in the event of his ever succeeding in driving the Turks, unaided, out of his ancestral dominions. In return for this protection the Amir is willing to bind himself to certain Agreements (probably similar to those of the Trucial Chiefs), and to accept a Political Officer to reside at his Court. The details of this secret Treaty he wishes to Major Cox to Govern ment of India, September 16, 1906. Mr. Morley’s telegram, November 9, 1906.

Mr. Morley to Govern ment of India, May 3, 1907. he settled or discussed at an interview which he is ready to give me, either in person or with his brother representing him, at some convenient rendezvous in the desert. Bin Saoud is determined to make an effort to obtain possession of Hassa and Katif, for without the additional revenue which he can derive from these tracts he admits that lie is unable to control the tribes who menace the highways of commerce and pilgrimage. He proposes, there tore, in the first place, to apply to the Sultan for the Ai utasnrrif-lik (Governorship) of the districts, and to throw off the Turkish yoke as soon as he considers the moment favourable after establishing himself. If his application is refused, he will invade the districts as soon as he is ready, and, having captured them, he will appeal openly to the British Government for pro tection. If he fails, he will never betray the secret understanding between himself and the Government. Possibly he will not make his attempt even for four or five years more.” In forwarding Captain Prideaux’s Report to the Government of India, Major Cox, in a letter dated the 24th N ovember, 1906, urged the necessity of an “authoritative” reply being returned to the “references made through the local officers by Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit and Sheikh Jasim of Katr on behalf of Bin Saoud—references which have in no way been courted, but which I cannot leave unanswered without incurring among the Chiefs con cerned a reputation for personal negligence or discourtesy, which would be prejudicial to my work in other ways.” these papers were sent home for information in the ordinary course by the Government of India without comment in January 1907. In a telegram dated the 9th February, 1907, the Government of India were asked for an expression of their views as to the answer to be returned to Sheikh Jasim. They replied as follows on the 15th February :— “ We are sending despatch reviewing situation in Eastern Arabia, and suggesting that answer be conveyed to Bin Saoud to the effect that British Government, while anxious to maintain friendly relations with him so long as he comports himself in a manner consonant with British interests and our engagements with Arab Sheikhs on coast, see no necessity at present for making him any formal promises of the protection which might even have effect of stimulating Turkish opposition to consolidation of his authority. Answer might be conveyed orally through Sheikh Jasim or such other agency as our Resident in the Persian Gulf may recommend.” The promised despatch was sent on the 21st February, 1907. In it the Government of India reviewed the position of His Majesty’s Government in regard to Nejd affairs since 1904. They expressed the view that matters were rapidly approaching a crisis, which would compel us to make up our minds as to our policy towards Central Arabia. They considered the pros pects of Turkey re-establishing her authority in Eastern Arabia to be remote,, and even contemplated the prospect of the Turks disappearing altogether from the whole of Arabia south of Zobehr. At the same time they hel l that the establishment of the Wahabee power would be a menace to our position at Koweit as well as on the Pirate Coast. In regard to the question imme diately at issue, they recommended that a reply should be returned to Bin Saoud’s overtures in the terms set forth in their telegram of the 15th February. Sir N. O’Conor, who was consulted, took the view that it would lie most unwise for His Majesty’s Government to entangle themselves with Bin Saoud or in any other way to interfere in the internal affairs of Arabia. The reply of His Majesty’s Government to the Government of India’s representations was conveyed in Mr. Morley’s despatch of the 3rd May, 1907, in the following terms :— “ After carefully considering, in consultation with His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, the views expressed by your Excellency’s Government as to the general situation in Central Arabia, His Majesty’s Government see no reason to modify the policy laid down in my predecessor’s telegram of the 30th December, 1904, and repeated in my telegram of the 9th November, 1906, that British interests and influence in those regions should be strictly confined to the coast; and they agree with Sir N. O Conor that it would be most unwise for them to entangle themselves155 Part II. Political.—( g.) The Wahabees. with the Wahabee Amir or in any other way to interfere in the internal affairs of Arabia. “The terms of the reply which, in paragraph 11 of your letter, you propose to return to Bin Saoud appear to His Majesty’s Government to be open to objection, as implying an approval of the consolidation of the Wahabee power, and consequently a certain interference in Arabian affairs. No such communication should therefore be made. But if Major Cox finds it impossible to avoid giving some answer to those who have approached him on the M ahabee Amii s behalf, he should inform them, as Bin Saoud’s proposals involve considerations which it is impossible for His Majesty’s Government to maintain, that no reply is to be expected.” So fai as is known, Bin Saoud s advances were not renewed durin 0, the year 1907. &amp; (f.) Turkey and Koweit. Turkey. Ujair, in the district of El Katif, is the most southerly point to which, with the important exception of Koweit, His Majestv’s Government have recognized continuous Turkish influence. This influence was confirmed by the expedition to Nejd in 1871, with the result that the Turks have remained established at El Katif and in the El Hasa district ever since. Ihe administration is disorderly, and, owing to the half-hearted co-opera tion of the local authorities, British naval officers have been repeatedly thwarted in their attempts to capture pirates, with whom this district is a favourite resort. The Arabian coast north of Kafcif, all the way to Koweit Bay, is without a single large settlement. _ Mostly barren and in the hands of the predatory and warlike tribe of Bin Hajar, it is very uninteresting and entirely unproductive. North of Koweit, Turkish territory extends to the western shore of the ! Island of El Khizo, and includes Eao, where there is a British telegraph office, on the Biver Shat-el-Arab. Much correspondence took place between 1887 and 1897 respecting the creation of fortified works at Fao, and Her Majesty’s Government energetic ally opposed these works. A full statement on the subject is contained in an India Office Memorandum dated the 21st June, 1897. Captain Smyth, who was sent on a special mission to the Persian Gulf -Foreign Office, Library in 1904, reported as follows :— -^ 0 ' 879 9. Confidential. &lt;e Eao is not a fort in any sense of the word; there are no fortifications and no guns.” Piracy on the Shat-el-Arab has formed a continual source of anxiety to the British authorities charged with the security of life and property on the Persian Gulf. Koweit. The family of the present Sheikh have ruled at Koweit for about 301 Oolony 1 Felly’s Report years. Originally the Sheikh’s progenitors dwelt in a small fort, called 0 pn Moomgussur, situated at the head of the Klior Abdulla, near Bunder Zobeir. They were once the pirates of the north of the Persian Gulf, and were expelled from their former stronghold by the Bussorah authorities. They came down the Bubiyan Creek and settled on the southern shore of the ‘‘Bay of Grane,” where they built a fort or “ kote,” whence the name Koweit is derived. Limits. The limits of Koweit have never been accurately, or, indeed, even India Office, May 12, approximately, defined. The claims of the Sheikh extend on the south as r37fil ' 2 S156 Appendix 2. far as Musalamiya Bay, but the British Resident was of opinion that they could not be supported, and that tin’s place was clearly within the sphere of Turkish influence.

Much correspondence took place in 1902 in regard to the nature of these claims, owing to a forward move of the Turks, who erected at fort at Um Kasr and established a military post at Ras-al-Geit, on Bubiyan Island. As regards Safwan, it was considered doubtful whether the Sheikh’s claims could be maintained, as they rested upon the shifting allegiance of migratory tribes. In a report on Urn Kasr, Captain Smyth, who made a special survey of the proposed trace of the Bagdad Railway in 1904, observes that he learned on the spot that the old fort ol Um Kasr is generally held to have been built by the grandfather of Sheikh Mubarak, and that it was occasionally occupied during the spring months by Arabs from Koweit. Mr. Wratislaw, His Majesty s Consul at Bussorah,’ 1 ' stated that, while it was highly desirable to secure control over Um Kasr, the Sheikh had only a very shadowy claim to it, and it had been uninhabited for many years. On the other hand, the Turks seemed to have little claim beyond that of actual occupation. “His claim to Bubiyan Island,” Mr. Wratislaw continued, “is in my opinion good. For some months every year regularly it is used as a fishing- ground by Arabs acknowledging his authority, and by no others.” The claim to Subiya was supported by His Majesty’s Government, and, with a view to forestalling an apprehended advance of the Turks, it was occupied by the Sheikh of Koweit. It was pointed out by the Government of India that if Subiya were surrendered Kathama Bay would have to follow suit, and the Turks would then threaten Koweit town. Fail aka Island, in Koweit Bay, is indisputably within the jurisdiction of the Sheikh ; it has been peopled by his subjects, the Avazem tribe, ever since the occupation of Koweit 300 years ago. ^ A\ hen Colonel Felly visited Koweit some fifty years ago he described it as “ a clean, active town, with a broad and open main bazaar, and numerous solid stone dwelling-houses, containing some 20,000 inhabitants, and attracting Arab and Persian merchants from all quarters by the equity of its rule -and by the freedom of its trade Under the fostering care of a succession of common-sense Rulers, and by means of a policy wisely originated and systematically pursued, an Arab band of pirates now appear as the masters of the thriving port, the refuge ot the oppressed, and the peaceful, free home of all.” He recorded the following opinion on the prospects of the port of Koweit:— “ On the whole, and without endeavouring to change trade from any present channel, I would bear Koweit in mind as a convenient point for a telegraph station, for a coal depot, for the meeting of sea-going and river steamers and other craft, and as a possible future port of importance.” I lie present importance of Koweit is principally due to its suitability as a terminus tor the Baghdad Railway.']' Attention will be directed to this aspect of the question after the political status of Koweit and the relations of the Sheikh with His Majesty^’s Government have been taken into consideration. In his Report on the tribes around the shores of the Persian Gulf, Colonel Felly classified Koweit among the “ territories nominally recognizing the suzerainty of the Turkish Government, but practically independent under their own Chiefs,” and in a later paragraph he emphasizes the nominal character of the suzerainty. Colonel Felly wrote as far back as 1863, but his definition of the statut of Koweit expresses in a nutshell the attitude His Majesty’s Government have consistently adopted on the question. * Basra. f See also p. 162 respecting Khor Musa, in Persia.EMnanna^Ban j they ere of n the dence rward tied a dkh’s ee of r ey of arned built h pied His le to m to 1, the 1 my shing and, was nent )Uow )n of since ed it TOUS ;ting and ssion and rs of ome t of any or a •iver v as this ions into lulf, dng lent inal itut .ent Part II.

But since it is practically under Turkish No. 307, influence, it is doubtful whether we could deny the latter.” On the -Bid January, 1899, the Sheikh signed an Agreement (to be kept absolutely secret) pledging himself not only to cede no territory, but to receive no foieign Hepresentative without ^British sanction. In return for this be was promised the good offices of Her Majesty’s Government, and a payment was made of 15,000 rupees from the Bushire Treasury. rega Turkisn law precluded irom holding landed property, ^ uijc ^ if the Sheikh were suspected of having agreed to a British Protectorate, the Turkish authoiities would attempt to dispossess Mubarak of his property neai Pao. Hie hope was therefore held out that the British Government would do what they could ” to protect him and his brothers in the matter. In 1901 rumours of Turkish concentration threatening Koweit raised the larger diplomatic question. In July 1901 Sir P. Lascelles had had a conversation with I)r. Rosen, of the German Foreign Office, upon the prospects of the Anatolian Railway and the general situation. An expression used by his Excellency describing the Sheikh as “ technically a subject of the Sultan but enjoying a considerable amount of independence, which on a previous occasion had passed without comment (see Sir F. Lascelles’ No. 156 of the loth June, 1900), now drew from the German Hepresentative an assertion that the Sheikh was “ merely a subject of the Sultan.” It was therefore pointed out to Sir F. Lascelles that the German Govern ment might take advantage of his language to argue that the Sultan could dispose of the territory of the Sheikh. The view that the Sheikh was simply a subject of the Sultan was one that His Majesty’s Government was totally unable to accept, and his Excellency was instructed to use language of a more explicit character. Sir N. O Conor was at the same time authorized to state, if occasion arose, that it Koweit were threatened His Majesty’s Government would use force to prevent attack. Important communications now took place at Constantinople and London. Considerable pressure was being exercised on the Ottoman Government by the German and Russian Embassies, and, though a proposal of the Vali ot Bussorah'- - * to use force against the Sheikh had been rejected by the Council of Ministers, Tewfik Pasha informed Sir N. O’Conor that Koweit was regarded as an integral part of the Ottoman Empire. A warning given by the Commander of the “ Perseus ” to the Captain of a Turkish corvette off Koweit that no troops would be permitted to land was largely magnified in transmission, and occasioned further protests. Tewfik Pasha inquired on the 29th August whether His Majesty’s Government intended to establish a Protectorate, and on the same day the German Embassy in London received a pressing instruction to state that a British Protectorate would be contrary to the Treaty of Berlin, and that, in view of her interest in Koweit as the future terminus of the Anatolian Railway, Germany would be compelled to regard such a proceeding as an unfriendly act. The reply in each case was that His Majesty’s Government had no such intention, Sir N. O’Conor adding the reservation “ provided that lurkey did not force our hands by interfering with the Sheikh.” Subsequently the German Ambassador called to say “that if by threats of force His Majesty’s Government prevented the Sultan from landing troops at Koweit, they were refusing to recognize the Sultan’s authority, with which they had stated (in a Memorandum communicated by the King to the German Emperor) that they did not desire to interfere in those parts, and that the German Government considered that Koweit formed unquestionably part of the territories belonging to the Sultan.” Currie, July 17, 1897.

Telegrams were also communicated by the Turkish Ambassador pro testing against the reported intention to declare a British Protectorate and describing the Convention of 1899 (the terms of which had leaked out) as without validity, but the Sultan bad meanwhile been advised by the German Government to be satisfied with the assurances given to Count Metternich, and to ask for their repetition. On the 6th September, 1901, Sir N. O’Conor was sent for by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The assurances given by His Excellency on this occasion were considered by the Ottoman Government “ of a nature to terminate the present controversy,” and Anthopoulo Pasha was instructed to ask for their confirmation. The following note was accordingly addressed to him:— “ The Marquess of Lansdowne to Anthopoulo Pasha. “Your Excellency, “Foreign Office, September 11, 1901. “ I have taken note with satisfaction of the telegram from the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, communicated by you on the 9th instant, in which his Excellency states that the Turkish Government will not send troops to Koweit, and will maintain the status quo there, on condition that His Majesty’s Government will abstain from occupying that place or establishing a British Protectorate there. “ I have pleasure in confirming the assurance which has been given to his Excellency by His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople that, provided the Turkish Government abstain from sending troops to Koweit and respect the status quo there, His Majesty’s Government will not occupy that place or establish a British Protectorate over it. “ I am, &amp;c. (Signed) “ LAKSDOWNE.” In a Secret telegram dated the 7th September, 1901, Lord Lansdowne, while pointing out that “ the situation requires very careful handling, as our arrangement with the Sheikh is not very precise, and it was entered into without the knowledge or concurrence of the Porte,” instructed Sir N. O'Conor that “we cannot recede from our position, and if the Porte should insist on raising the question of their rights, we may have to convert into something much more precise the present indefinite understanding with the Sheikh.” In view, however, of the assurances recorded in the note quoted above, his Excellency did not communicate these instructions during 1901, and the controversy rested for the moment on the basis of a mutual maintenance of the status quo The Turkish Ambassador expressed himself well satisfied with this state of affairs (October 1), and on the same day Sir N. O’Conor was assured by the Minister for Foreign Affairs “ most positively that the Imperial Government had no intention whatsoever of occupying or attacking Koweit.” An understanding was arrived at that the two Governments were to co-operate in maintaining the peace, Turkey endeavouring to restrain the Amir of Nejd, while His Majesty’s Government would do what they could to discourage the Sheikh from aggressive action, and Mubarak was told that the good offices of His Majesty’s Government would be extended to him only if he followed their advice. On the 9th September, 1901, a further communication was mule to Count Metternich. A Memorandum upon various subjects, including Koweit, drawn up by Lord Lansdowne for the King’s personal use, and handed by His Majesty to tbe German Emperor at a recent meeting, had elicited a formal reply from the German Government which Count Metter nich had lately left at tbe Foreign Office. It was now explained to his Excellency that the Memorandum, which Lad been hastily prepared, was a purely informal and unofficial document. 1 he statement which it contained respecting Koweit was a repetition of Sir N. O’Conor’s language in 1909, which was to the effect that Her Majesty’s Government had no desire to interfere with the Sultan's authority as it exists in those parts. There could be no doubt that this authority was of a very limited description. The Sheikh belonged to a class of native Chiefs enjoying a large measure of practical independence with whom His Majesty’s Government found it necessary to have direct relations for the sake of the maintenance of tranquillity and the protection of British trade. Therefore^ To Sir P. Lascelles, Nos. 304 and 312, September 11 and 12, 1901.© Part II. Political.—Turkey and Koweit. 159 although i eaclj to maintain the stntus quo, His Majesty’s Government had been unable to acquiesce in attempts recently made by Turkey to impose on the Sheikh conditions from which he had hitherto been free. They had considered it a mattei for direct and friendly discussion'with the Porte, who now regarded the incident as closed, and Count Metternich was informed of the assurances exchanged. Hord Lansdowne subsequently said to Count Metternich that it was necessary to bear in mind that where minor Pastern States were concerned it was not unusual to find that they owed a divided allegiance to more than one power. I he German Memorandum states that ICoweit has an importance for Germany merely as the proposed terminus of the Baghdad Railway, and gives an undertaking that the Manager of the Railway Company will be instructed to come to an understanding with the British Government when the time for purchasing land for a railway terminus and a landing-place at Koweit shall have come. Count Metternich afterwards confirmed this assurance in con versation with Lord Lansdowne, adding that the railway might be made five years or fifty years hence, or not at all, but that when it was made it was important for Germany to find a peaceful condition of things in that part of the Gulf. In consequence of a threatened attack by the Amir of Nejd and Turkish troops upon Koweit, the Commander of His Majesty’s ship Pomone,” at the request of the sheikh, landed guns for the fort at Jehara, and made arrangements for the defence of the town. Instructions were given to him to desist from these preparations as soon as Koweit was no longer threatened. Representations on the subject were made by the Turkish Ambassador, who demanded the re-embarkation of the guns and the restora tion of the status quo. He was informed, in reply, that His Majesty’s Government considered their proceedings to be justified so long as danger of attack existed; and subsequently he was told that the guns had been re-embarked. Early in 1902 the Turks departed from their engagements to maintain the status quo, and occupied posts at Um Kasr and Ras-al-Geit, the latter on Bubiyan Island, which is a place of strategic importance, as commanding the approaches to the Khor Abdulla. The Sheikh of Koweit regarded this as a disturbance of the status quo, and put forward claims of territorial jurisdiction to both places; and British war-ships were ordered to Koweit in January. The Government of India took a very serious view of the Turkish action, which, it was surmised, was inspired by Germany. They pointed out that, with the shores of the mainland and of Bubiyan Island in the hands of a single Power, the anchorages below Um Kasr :i: ' could at any time be converted into an impregnable harbour. Sir N. O’Conor made repeated representations to the Ottoman Govern ment, but they proved entirely futile in their effect, in so far as the withdrawal of the post on Bubiyan was concerned. As regards Lm hasrand Bubiyan Island, Sir N. O’Conor informed the Porte that the Turkish occupation could not be regarded as in any way prejudicing the Sheikh’s rights and authority over them. He intimated that, if the Ottoman Government proceeded to bring matters to a crisis, he would advise his Government not to allow further encroachment, and, if necessary, to prevent it by force. The Turkish advance to Subiya was arrested, probably owing to the presence of British war-ships. In October 1902 the Government of India reported a request made by Sheikh Mubarak for the gift of two or three guns, presumably to be placed at Jehara for the protection of Koweit against land attack. They proposed to give a refusal, but to intimate to him that His Majesty’s Government undertook to defend the Koweit district, provided he complied with the injunction already conveyed to him to observe his engagement to His Majesty’s Government and to follow their advice. Lord Lansdowne con- * It has been suggested that the importance of Um Kasr and Warba Roads is minimized, because the approaches through the Khor Abdulla are becoming silted up. But this appears to rest merely on hearsay and inexpert information. 1901. To Sir F. Lascelles, No. 321, September 28, 1901. To Sir F. Lascelles, No. 337, October 16, 1901.

A telegram to this effect was accordingly sent to the Govern, ment of India. In reference to an Arab raid from Nejd, made with the cognizance of the Vali of Bussorah,* pressure was brought upon the Porto to caution the Yali and a warning given that His Majesty’s Government would not allow an attack upon Koweit. The importance of securing the withdrawal of the Turkish post from Kas-al-Geit, and of asserting the Sheikh’s claim to Bubiyan, and if possible to Warba, was emphasized by an Inter-Departmental Committee in October 1907. After entirely concurring in the views of the Government of India, the Committee continued:— Admiralty, November 9, 1907. To India Office, November 12, 1907. (xovernment of India, February 4, 1904.

Bank. 1 “We therefore recommend, if diplomatic considerations permit, that the Sheikh of Koweit should be invited to specify the nature of his claims to M arba Island, to which he is understood frequently to have referred; and that the continued occupation of Bubiyan Island by a Turkish post, in derogation of the Sheikh's territorial claims (which have been recognized and supported by His Majesty’s Government), should be neutralized by the establishment forthwith ol a Koweiti post, with the countenance of His Majesty’s Government, on Warba Island, or, if that should prove undesirable on the northern shore of Bubiyan Island. If practicable, we would even recommend the establishment of posts on both islands. “We desire to emphasize the importance which we attach to the effective assertion of the Sheikh’s territorial claims to Bubiyan.” The Admiralty concurred in these recommendations, and Sir E. Grey was of opinion that, while it would be desirable to assert any rights which the Sheikh might possess in respect of Warba Island, his jurisdiction over Bubiyan should be resolutely supported by His Majesty’s Government on the grounds so forcibly stated by the Government of India. It was decided, in the first instance, to ascertain the nature of the Sheikh’s claim to Warba, and this is now being done. On the 15th October, 1907, a Secret Agreement was signed with the Sheikh of Koweit, granting to His Majesty’s Government, for a yearly rental of 4,000/., a perpetual lease of a portion of the foreshore at Bunder Shweikh (near Koweit), which is held, on topographical and hydrographical considera tions, to possess greater capabilities as a railway terminus than any other place on the Persian Gulf. The Agreement includes rights of pre-emption m regard to Has Kathama, Warba, and any territory over which the Sheikh may exercise jurisdiction. This Agreement, and the appointment in 1903 of a British Political Agent to reside at Koweit, have done much to strengthen our position. Further measures which may be considered advisable are the construc tion of a lighthouse on Failaka Island or on Kubbar Island (which is con sidered necessary for navigation purposes) and the erection of a wireless telegraphic apparatus, as proposed at Musandim, Bassidu, and Bahrein, for the more effective suppression of piracy, and as a signal station for passing snips. It might also be of service to trade if a bank were opened at Koweit. It should be observed that a delicate point in our relations with the feheikh is the extent to which we can ignore the traffic in arms which nominally he has prohibited. (g.)

At the same time, he pressed Foreign Office Memo- Jl .

While 1905 ' expressing himself able to deal with the Persians, he feared an attempt to coerce him might be made by some other Power, either acting alone or in co-operation with the Shah’s Government. His Majesty’s Government undertook to protect Mohammerah against naval attack by 'a foreign Power under any pretext, and also, so long as the Sheikh remained faithful to the fehali and followed British advice, to continue to give him good offices and support. At a meeting held on the 22nd March, 1905, the Imperial Defence Committee decided:— “ That ., it is important to secure the good offices of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, and tbe possibility of supporting him in certain cases against the Shah should not be excluded ; but we must be the judges of the merits of any dispute which may arise.” +- 'at BeceiaiPer HOT His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran reported Mr. Marling, No. 18, that Messrs.

Persia. . ^ Most of the authoritative statements on the protection of our interests m Southern Persia and the Gulf have been rendered largely irrelevant by the conclusion of the Anglo-Bussian Convention ; while another factor, of perhaps corresponding import, is the rise of German influence at Tehran—too recent to admit any definition of its ultimate effect. In these circumstances, it is peculiarly hard to write upon the situation S'S it is affected on the Persian littoral of the Gulf; existing information is largely beside the point; the future trend of events is remarkably obscured. It has accordingly seemed advisable, in considering here the Persian question in relation to the Gulf, to avoid larger and indefinite issues, and to direct attention exclusively, and that only on general lines, to (a) a description162 Appendix *2. Position at Bunder Abbas, &amp;c Admiralty, August 7, 1903. of the coast-line, and (b) the development of trade routes and railway- communication. The first subject could obviously not be omitted in a Memorandum of this character; the second is suggested hy the declaration of the German Government that their interest in Persia is purely commercial. Without seeking to impugn the sincerity of this limitation, it may he doubted whether, at the present clay, a distinct line can he drawn between political and commercial relations, the more so since in other quarters German policy has shown such conspicuous success in using the leverage of commercial enterprise for the promotion of political ascendency. It has been ]ustly said that Persia governs her coast on sufferance. Proverbially timorous of the sea, and possessed of a single vessel ol* war—the “ Persepolis ”—under foreign command and at present unseaworthy, the Persians owe their authority, such as it is, to the past exertions and actual presence of British naval officers, who have rendered navigation secure, and thus contributed in no small degree to the revenue of the Persian exchequer. To show that this statement is not overdrawn, it may be recalled that there is not a single really Persian village or town from Mohammerah, on the Shat-el-Arab, to Gwadur, on the Baluchistan border. Excepting Bushire, every town, village, and island is inhabited hy Arabs, with a very small sprinkling of Persian blood among them, over whom the Persian Government would he incapable of asserting authority should any concerted rising take place. Only a few years ago there was a temporary overthrow of Persian authority at Lingah; the Sheikh of Kishm would like to declare his independence ; and for some time it was an open question -whether the Arabs of Mohammerah would submit to the extension of the new customs regime to that port. Within the past six months there have been serious disturb ances at Lingah and Bunder Abbas, and British naval action has been taken against pirates at Dayir, on the Persian coast. The most striking feature of the Persian coast is the absence of good harbours. Bushire, Lingah, and Bunder Abbas are merely open roadsteads, where a landing can sometimes be effected only with difficulty, and for days it maybe impossible to work cargo. At Bushire cargo can, indeed, he brought alongside the custom-house in almost any weather, provided the lighters can approach the steamers, which remain at over 2 miles from the shore. The position could he immeasurably improved by dredging. At Bunder Abbas a good harbour could be constructed by utilizing the deep water of the Clarence Straits, which separate the Island of Kishm from the mainland. The importance of Bunder Abbas, with the adjacent Islands of Kishm, Henjara, and Hormuz, as a naval station, was the subject of much official correspondence between 1900 and 1905, and was emphasized hy an Inter- Departmental Committee which met in October 1907. A point of the Persian coast which calls for special mention on account of its suitability as a terminus for the Baghdad Railway is Khor Musa, near the Shat-el-Arab. This khor was surveyed by two British naval officers in 1903. Turning now to the subject of trade routes and the development of railway communication, the ports which command caravan routes are Bunder Abbas, Bushire, and Mohammerah, while Bussorah, :i: ‘ in Turkish territory, is a principal artery for trade in transit to Persia via Baghdad and Kermanshah. The Bunder Abbas roads to Kerman and Yezd are very insecure on account of brigands, and the road from Bushire to Shiraz is arduous and difficult. The transport rates are subject to great fluctuation ; but, striking an average, Mr. Whigham, in his book “ The Persian Problem,” points out that, whereas it costs SOs. a ton to carry goods from London to Bushire, the transport thence to Shiraz (183 miles) costs 87s., and the charge from Bushire to Ispahan may be estimated at 10/. The Ahwaz-Ispahan road, constructed for the Bakhtiari Khans by Messrs. Lynch, has brought Ispahan within much closer proximity to the sea, and, in point of distance, is a great improvement on the Bushire-Shiraz- Ispahan route. The opening of roads is indeed desirable in order to feed the trade of the * Basra163 Part II. Political.— (h.) Persia. GuH; but it lias been forcibly urged that no marked development of commerce can take place until railway construction has been entered upon, and that a single line joining Bunder Abbas or Bushire with the plateau would be of incalculable service in this connection, since it would reduce the time of the journey from the coast to Ispahan from thirty days to twenty- four hours, and the cost of transport from 1 01. a ton to ] L Moreover, it is by no means improbable—the German Minister for Foreign Affairs alluded to the contingency in conversation with Sir E. Grey— that the promoters of the Baghdad Railway may seek to secure an extension across the Turkish frontier, and the situation which now causes anxiety to Bis Majesty’s Government in Mesopotamia may perhaps find a counterpart in the south of Persia. That such a consummation would be prejudicial to our interests does not appear to require demonstration; and a Concession of this nature should assuredly be forestalled by the acquisition of prior rights, Acquisition of prior to which, in virtue of undertakings of the late Shah* and his predecessor, rights lor Railway Bis Majesty’s Government are already in some degree entitled. Construction, The most natural route for a railway would perhaps he the prolongation of the Khanikin branch from Baghdad via Kermanshah, Sultanabad, and Ispnhan to Yezd, with branches to Bizful and Mohammerah and to Kerman and Bunder Abbas. The provisions of the Anglo-Russian Convention would occasion some deviation from this line, but the trunk line could be modified to meet the exigencies of the political situation, while a beginning would necessarily be made with the branches which rest on the sea. For the present, questions of actual construction are premature; it is only desirable, in order to guard against a needless surrender to German competition, to enter a caveat at Tehran. The following letter, dated the _!5th September, 1907, contains the views of Sir E. Grey on the subject of railway construction:— “ I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to state, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, that he has recently had under consideration the effect which the signature of the Anglo-Russian Convention is likely to exercise, sooner or later, upon the question of railway construction in Persia. “ As you are aware, the Convention provides that neither of the Contracting Powers shall, without previous arrangement between them, oppose the grant of Concessions supported by the other within the limits of the neutral zone, where equality of commercial opportunity is likewise recognized to the subjects of third Powers. “ It may, indeed, safely be surmised that other Powers will not be slow to appreciate the changed situation, and to seek to turn it to advantage. “ Although the Russo-Persian Railway Convention has still some years to run, the question of future railway construction in Persia and the pledges made to His Majesty’s Government by the two late Shahs must not be ost sight of, and a timely decision should be taken as to what Concessions it would be most conducive to the interests of British policy to obtain for railway construction in Southern Persia. “ In these circumstances, it seems advisable that His Majesty’s Govern ment should take into early consideration the question of a possible attempt to extend the Baghdad Railway into Southern Persia, with a view to determining whether a Concession of this nature to other Powers should be opposed, or whether it should be forestalled by timely action on the part of His Majesty’s Government, who, by securing prior rights of construction, might render an extension of the Baghdad Railway under foreign auspices economically undesirable. “Sir E. Grey is unwilling that the history of the Baghdad Railway Concession, which at one time could have been secured to British enterprise, should find a counterpart in Persia. Moreover, the extension of the Baghdad Railway, as &amp; foreign undertaking, in the direction of the Indian frontier would, on strategic grounds, appear to be inadmissible; the grant of sucli a Concession would compel the opposition of His Majesty s Government, and a sharp diplomatic conflict would ensue, whereas by the exercise of foresight such a crisis might be averted altogether. _ . . } £&lt; Turning now to the question of what specific action His Majesty s * See Annex (B), p. 191. [376]164 Appendix 2. Government should take to the end in view, it appears to Sir E. Grey that a British Concession for a railway from Bunder Abbas to Shiraz might prove financially advantageous, while it would seem to offer no strategic objections from the point of view of the defence of India. Such a line would absorb all the traffic which has hitherto passed from Bushire and Ah waz to the north of Persia, and would result in the material improvement of the port of Bunder Abbas, now in the British sphere, and greatly increase its value and importance. The Concession might include the right to con tinue the line to Ahwaz or elsewhere in Arabistan, and. to effect a junction with the Baghdad Railway—such extension to be left to the discretion of the concessionnaire. &lt;£ An alternative scheme, which deserves examination, is whether it would be either desirable or practicable to unite the Indian railway system with the Baghdad Railway. “ This scheme raises strategic considerations which fall within the province of the Government of India and the Committee of Imperial Defence. “ It may well be thought expedient, for strategic reasons, to oppose altogether the progress of railway construction towards the Indian frontier. Be this as it may, it would appear that the difficulty of meeting German competition in the neutral zone in Persia is likely to increase from year to year, and it may prove that a railway such as that referred to would, in British hands, be the most effective means of anticipating a German com mercial advance into Southern Persia in the future, thus becoming the source of protection rather than of weakness in the defence of India. “ As to the economic aspects of the scheme, it may be regarded as likely that the existence of such a line would make British co-operation in the Baghdad Railway more welcome to the Germans, since it would increase the volume of through traffic. While passengers would hesitate to travel by the Baghdad Railway with the necessity of breaking the journey on arrival at the Persian Gulf, the convenience of a through carriage from Calais to India could not fail to make itself felt; further, the economy of time would be considerable, and of especial value in the transmission of mails. “ The objections of the Russian Government might be such as to render the enterprise inadvisable, though these objections could not fairly extend to the British ‘sphere’ of influence; but, in Sir E. Grey’s opinion, there is no reason to believe that they would prove insurmountable if on mature con sideration the enterprise should be deemed advantageous. “ Sir E. Grey is of opinion that the whole question should be submitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence, in order that His Majesty’s Govern ment may be in a position to decide upon a definite line of policy “ The subject of British participation in the Baghdad Railway may possibly be raised on the occasion of the approaching visit of the German Emperor to this country ; and, both on this account and for the reasons already explained, it is desirable that a decision on the questions raised should not be unduly delayed.” (i.) Bassidu. . NoTE.—The India Office letters of the 30th October, 1901, and the 7th January, 1902, deal with the limits of British jurisdiction at Bassidu. The India Office letter of the 10th July, 1901, deals with British Government buildings. The Admiralty letter of the 21st March, 1902,‘incloses a report on the Islands of Kishm and Hormuz, Bassidu is situated at the western extremity of Kishm Island, which lies parallel to the Persian coast, from which it is separated by Clarence Strait. It has a good anchorage, for vessels of moderate draught, about a third of a mile off shore. Eor landing purposes there is a low stone pier, about 80 yards in length, extending to low-water mark. It was once a flourishing Portuguese Settlement, and the ruins of the old town are still in existence. 1 he British occupation appears to have begun in 1820, under a verbal giant fiom Sultan Syed Saeed of Muscat, who then exercised jurisdiction India Office, March 20, °ver the island. r J his was confirmed by Agreement with his son and successor, 1899 * Sultan Thoweymee, in 1864.

The Government of India, in their despatch No. 66 of the 2nd May 1901, state:— ^ M e already possess a plot of British territory at Bassidu on Kishm Island. ^.... Tour Lordship is aware of the conditions under which we hold possession of Bassidu.. Though we no longer use the place as a coaling depot, we keep an agent there, who flies the British flag There are no independent local Chiefs with whom we could enter into relations. With the exception of the tract in our possession at Bassidu the islands are under Persian authority.” Again, the Government of India wrote, in their despatch No. 92 of the 29th May, 1902 :— The circumstances connected with the British occupation of Bassidu are already known to your Lordship. The Settlement dates from 1820; but our occupation has for many years been indicated only by the presence of a native coal agent, who, however, has habitually flown the British flag.” The place was for many years (from 1823 till 1879) the head-quarters of the Indian Marine j and it is one of the healthiest places near the entrance to the Gulf. On the 6th May, 1903, the India Office stated that the Bussian Consul at Bushire had made inquiries as to the nature of the British position at Bassidu, and had been informed of the situation by the Prench A^ent at Lingah. In the Admiralty letter of the 21st March, 1902, a report is inclosed from Rear-Admiral Bosanquet, in which he says:— “ Kishm is, in my opinion, the most important strategical position in the Persian Gulf, from a naval point of view, and its possession would be very important to us as a port for our mercantile marine and a coaling station for our ships of war.” On the 19th November, 1902, a Conference, consisting of delegates of the TMreign Office, India Office, War Office, and Admiralty, was held at the Foreign Office, and amongst other recommendations as to the methods in which the extension of British influence could be most successfully prosecuted, and to the best advantage for general purposes, it was advised that “ we should reassert our claims at Bassidu.” It does not appear that any very definite action has been taken in pursuance of this recommendation, though it is recorded in the Minutes of the Committee of Imperial Defence. An Inter-Departmental Committee of delegates from the Foreign Office, India Office, and Admiralty, in submitting a report (dated October 1907) on the terminus of the Baghdad Railway, recommended incidentally that such steps as His Majesty’s Government might consider feasible should be taken to consolidate our position at the entrance to the Persian Gulf, including Kishm. It has been suggested that the ruined buildings at Bassidu should be pulled down, and a small meteorological station under a British-Indian subject established. A depdt for stores for the ships of war in the Gulf might also be created, and it is worth considering whether a wireless Depot, and Wireless telegraphic apparatus should not be installed for convenience of com- Telegraphy, munication.

In January 1903 Colonel Kemball, the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, reported that, in consequence of the short-sighted policy of the Belgian166 Appendix 2. India Office, July 23, 1903. Foreign Office Memo randum of July 30, 1903. Inclosure in Colonel Ross to Tehran of August 19, 1888 (see Government of India Proceedings, September 1888). India Office, April 14, 1904.

Customs officials, trade had to a large extent been diverted from the Persian port of Lingah, and local merchants were endeavouiing to arrange with the Bombay and Persian Navigation Company to make the Island of Abu Musa a port of call, apparently for the purpose of facilitating their pearl business. Colonel Kemball was apprehensive lest such a conjuncture should result in a territorial claim to this island being advanced by the Persian Government, who, in 1888, had laid claim to and hoisted their flag on the adjacent Island of Sirri. Incidentally it may he mentioned that, writing on the 28th April, 1888, Colonel Boss, then British Resident, had expressed a decided opinion that no valid claim to Abu Musa could be advanced by the Persian Government, while any attempt to assert their authority in a practical form would probably lead to disturbances. Colonel Kemball stated that the island undoubtedly belonged to the Jowasmi Sheikh of Shargah (one of the Trucial Chiefs under British protection). In the winter it was usually visited by people from Khan and Shargah for purposes of fishing and grazing. In the pearling season these people were in the habit of migrating, and the sole inhabitants remaining were three men whose duty was to tend the date trees belonging to Sheikh Salem, the uncle of the Sheikh of Shargah. The Jowasmis did not fly a flag on the island, and Colonel Kemball submitted that it might be well to advise the Sheikh of Shargah to do so as a sign of ownership. This course was approved by the Government of India, and on the 30th April, 1903, Colonel Kemball reported that the Sheikh had issued orders accordingly. The Government of India at the same time instructed the Resident to furnish his observations on the expediency of advising the Sheikh of Has- el-Kheimah to adopt a similar course in regard to the Island of Tamb, which apparently belonged to that section of the Jowasmis. (In 1888, on the occupation of Sirri, the Sheikh of Shargah had urged that the Persians should be prevented from pursuing a similar course at Tamb.) Colonel Kemball replied that the Persian Government had never asserted sovereignty over the island; that the Sheikh of Shargah. in his existing capacity as Ruler of Ras-el-Kheimah, claimed it as an appanage of the Jowasmis of the Arab Coast, urging that it was visited hy his subjects on account of the good water supply and for purposes of grazing; that the Sheikh was in possession of documentary evidence, in the shape of three letters from two Arab Sheikhs of Lingah, admitting the claim of the Jowasmis of the Arab Coast as against that of the Jowasmis of Lingah; and, dually, that in one of these letters, written in 1877, the Sheikh of Lingah had conceded that the Persians had no property there, nor any right of inter ference, save with the consent of the Chief of Ras-el-Kheimah. The Government of India hereupon directed that the Chief of Shargah should be advised, as in the case of Abu Musa, to hoist his flag on the Island of Tamb. In April 1901 the Viceroy of India telegraphed that the Belgian officials in charge of the Persian Customs had placed guards on Abu Musa and Tamb. forcibly removed the Arab flags, erected new flagstafis, and hoisted the Persian flag in both islands. The Sheikh of Shargah, on hearing of this encroachment, declared that he could not tolerate the action of the Persian authorities, and, in virtue of Treaty relations, appealed to His Majesty’s Government to take the necessary steps with a view to preventing such interference with his territory. Major Cox, the British Resident, in commenting subsequently on the irresponsible action of the Customs officials on this occasion, wrote as follows:— “ I would observe, in conclusion, that signs are not wanting to my mind to incline me to the belief that if we do not maintain a vigorous policy in connection with these islands in the Gulf, it will not be long167 Part II. Political.—( j.) Abu Musa, Tamb, and Sirbi. before we are confronted with difficulties in regard to the adjacent pearl fisheries, the preservation ol which under the time-honoured conditions lias always been one of the fundamental features of our policy in these waters.” The Go\ernment of India took a serious view of the incident, and proposed to dispatch a gun-boat to the islands, with a representative of the Sheikh of Shargah on hoard, to haul down the Persian flag, reinstate the Jownsmi flag, and remove the guards to Persian territory. It was decided, however, in the first instance to make representations to the Persian Government, and on the 24th May His Majesty’s Minister reported that they hau telegraphed orders to Bushire to remove the flags and guards from Abu Musa and Tamb, while reserving their right to discuss with His Majesty’s Government the respective claims to the island. The following is the text of a note addressed by His Majesty’s Minister to the Persian Government on the 15th June, 1904 :— “ Your Excellency, “ I have had the honour to receive your note of yesterday’s date respecting Tamb and Abu Musa, and shall be happy to transmit to the Government of India any proofs with which you may favour me that the claims of the Persian Government to the ownership of these islands outweigh those of the Sheikh of Shargah. “ Your Excellency must, however, understand, that I cannot agree to the suggestion, of which I hear for the first time, that this Trucial Chief should not be permitted to replace his flag pulled down by the Persian Customs officials, and I would remind you in this connection that we have not insisted upon the Persian Government removing their flag from the Island of Sirri till the controversy between the two Governments as to the ownership of the island, which originated many years ago, has been reciprocally settled. The position would have been different if the Sheikh of Shargah had removed an existing Persian flag from Tamb and Abu Musa. What he did was to hoist his own flag upon the islands, which were not yet formally occupied by any other Government, and he has the right to fly it as the first occupant, till his lawful possession of these islands is disproved.” In June 1904 Major Cox entered into communication with the Chief of Shargah, as Head Sheikh of the Jowasmi, respecting the rehoisting of the Jowasmi flags. Flagstaff's were erected on both islands and guards stationed there, and the Chiefs and inhabitants of the Pirate Coast were glad, and felt assured that the British Government would protect them against enemies and would maintain their honour, and the people highly praised the British Government. M. Isaus, the Belgian Director of Customs, informed Sir A. Hardinge, in May 1904, that the Persian Minister for Foreign .Affairs had told him that the Persian claim to Tamb and Sirri was sound, but that to Abu Musa was more doubtful. No further Persian claim to Tamb and Abu Musa has been reported since 1904. Sirri. In June 1904 the Government of India instructed the Besident in the Persian Gulf to forward a report on the actual situation at Sirri, which the Persian Government had occupied in 1888, as it might be convenient to reopen the question of the legality of the Persian occupation if the Persian Government should afford an opportunity by questioning the status of Abu Musa and Tamb. Major Cox reported that His Majesty’s Government had never in any way admitted, or withdrawn their original objections to, the claim of the Shah’s Government to the ownership of the island ; while it was equally clear from the records of the Residency that the Jowasmi Arab Sheikhs of the Pirate Coast had never voluntarily dropped their claim to proprietary rights over Sirri any more than over Abu Musa and Tamb. As late as 1895 the said Sheikhs had declared that, although the Chief of Shargah on their behalf had duly represented to the British Government that the ownership of the island was vested in him, as Chief of the Jowasmis, the British Government had refrained from moving in the matter, and [376] 2 X Sir A.

A full precis of the correspondence relating to the occupation of Sirri is contained in a letter, dated Bushire, the 19th August, 1888, from Colonel Boss to Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran (vide Government of India Proceedings, September 1888, No. 104). Sir Arthur Hardinge, in commenting on the correspondence between Major Cox and the Government of India, deprecated raising the case of Sirri, unless the Persian Government forced the question upon His Majesty’s Government, since the latter were face to face with an occupation in which they had acquiesced for very many years, though they had not formally recognized it. He added that M. Naus had consented to strike out Sirri from the list of Customs ports enumerated in the “ Beglement Douanier.” Pabt III.—COMMERCE. (a.) The Pearl fisheries. The pearl fisheries constitute so important a factor in the general policy of His Majesty’s Government in the Persian Gulf, that considerable space is allotted to the consideration of this subject, and the three principal papers which hear upon it are quoted in extenso. These are— (I.) A despatch from the Government of India dated the 10th March, 1904 ; (II.) A Report submitted by the Law Officers of the Crown to Lord Lansdowne, dated the 11 th Eebruary, 1905; and (III.) A despatch to the Viceroy from the Secretary of State for India, dated the 31st March, 1905. I. “ In the course of our recent examination of problems connected with the Persian Gulf, the question of the pearl fisheries that have so long existed there has come under our notice. Important questions, both of policy and international law, are involved; and although none of these has fortunately hitherto assumed an acute shape, it seems to us desirable that the matter should be considered now, in order that we may know bow to act should any sudden or unexpected development occur. We therefore address you on the subject. “ The approximate limits of the pearling grounds in the neighbourhood of the Arab littoral are indicated on the inclosed copy of a chart of the Gulf. In addition to those marked, there are also shoals in the neighbour hood of Kharak Island, and at other points along the Persian coast, which are regularly exploited, and frequently yield considerable returns. We are immediately concerned, however, only with those lyinu on the Arabian side of the Gulf&lt; Along this coast lie the territories of the several TruciaJ Chiefs, the Peninsula of El Katr, the Island of Bahrein, the Turkish Province of El Hassa, and the domains of the Sheikh of Koweit. The pearl banks appear from time immemorial to have been open, without distinction, to the Arabs of the entire littoral; and though there are no definite inter tribal limits, the external boundaries of the fisheries are well known. Intrusion is resented ; the principal Chiefs have in the past expressed the view that the fisheries are common property, and that no Chief has therefore the right to grant any Concession to outside parties; and, believing as they do that the shallower waters are dependent on the deeper for their supply of shells, their objections relate not only to interference on the shoals which are habitually fished by their dependents, but also to the exploitation of the deeper waters beyond. “ His Majesty’s Government are aware of the close relations which exist169 Part III. Commerce.—( a.) The Pearl Fisheries. between the Arabs of this coast and the Indian Government. Since 1843 we have held from the Trucial Chiefs Agreements to refrain from any breach of the peace at sea, and in 1892 the Sheikhs conclnded fresh compacts, binding themselves not to enter into any Agreement or correspondence with any Power other than the British Government; not to consent, except with the permission of the British Government, to the residence within their territories of the Agent of any other State; and not to cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give occupation of any portion of their territories, save to the British Government. In respect of El Katr, we have at present no formal Conventions. We have declined, however, to recognize Turkish pretensions on the peninsula, and the leading Chief has on more than one occasion approached our officers in the Gulf with a request that he may be admitted to closer relations with the Indian Government. Bahrein has for long been, to all intents and purposes, a British Protectorate; while, in the case of Koweit, though the Turks have laid claim to certain ill-defined rights of sovereignty, we have always asserted that the Sheikh enjoys a large measure of practical independence, and His Majesty’s Government have promised him their good offices. The maintenance of the maritime peace in the Gulf is an object which, for more than a century past, we have steadily kept in view in all our dealings with the Arab tribes. To secure this object we have prohibited the use of armed boats by the Chiefs, and have taken upon ourselves the duty of policing all these waters. A necessary corollary of this policy is that the Chiefs cannot themselves adopt forcible measures for the preservation of their monopoly in connection with tiie pearl fisheries. It is clear, therefore, that we on our part owe to them an obligation to defend their rights so far as they can reasonably be substantiated. This duty carries with it incidentally the advantage that, if our right to police the pearl banks is recognized, a large area of the Gulf becomes at once practically British waters. “ In the past we have on more than one occasion intervened to prevent the intrusion of foreigners. In 1863 a British steamer appeared in the Gulf with trained divers and scientific appliances, but the steps which were at once taken by the Ilesident, with the approval of the Bombay Government, sufficed to frustrate the attempted encroachment. In 1874, and again in 1890, Her Majesty’s Government, on the advice of the Government of India, declined to countenance proposals made by British Companies to exploit the fisheries. In 1894 support was refused to an application by a British subject to the Persian Government for pearling Concessions in the Gulf. In 1899, in connection with the alleged grant of certain privileges to two Europeans by the Persian Government, the Mushir-ed-Dowleh was informed by Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran that no contract could be recognized which would have the effect of interfering with the rights exercised by Chiefs under British protection. In 1901 Sir Nicholas O’Conor, hearing of a project which was under the consideration of the Porte to tax the fisheries, acquainted Tewfik Pasha with the objections which Her late Majesty’s Government saw to any action which would interfere with the prescriptive rights of our protected tribes. In 1902 our local officers declined to countenance the project of a British Indian subject, who proposed to obtain facilities for pearling in Abu Dthabi waters. Efinally, in 1903, Colonel Kemball reported that two Frenchmen, named Dumas and Castelin, had arrived in Bahrein with the intention of prospecting the pearl banks round that island. The Chief refused to entertain their proposals, and subsequently the strangers left the neighbourhood, one for Turkish Arabia, and the other for Europe, where it was believed that he intended to engage a professional diver. He has, however, not yet reappeared. In connection with the last-mentioned case, we have informed our Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that we entirely approve Sheikh Esa’s attitude, and that, in the event of either of these Frenchmen returning to Bahrein, the Chief should refuse to render assistance of any description ; that any other Chief who may be similarly approached should return a similar response ; and that the Government of India should at once be informed of any renewal of the project, or of any like attempt. We inclose, for your information, a copy of the recent corre spondence on this subject. “ We have thus succeeded hitherto in staving off outside interference.170 Appendix 2. Me recognize, however, that our position in the matter is in certain respects difficult, and that in the future the same success may not attend measures which in the past have sufficed to attain our object. The question involves considerations, firstly, of private, and, secondly, of international law. Our rights in restraining foreign interference are, it appears to us, at any rate commensurate with those of the Arab tribes concerned, since these have agreed to leave the protection of their interests in our hands; and the question which we may hereafter be called upon to answer, whether in defending a civil suit in a British Court or in meeting an international claim, must be the same, namely, the extent of the rights and jurisdiction possessed by the Arab Chiefs. The chart which we inclose shows that the pearl banks extend to considerable distances from the mainland or from any island. Within the 3-mile limit it seems evident that no difficulty need be encountered, and that the rights over the pearl banks, and the jurisdiction required to assert those rights, are indisputable. Beyond this zone, however, the case is less clear. We understand that it has become an uncontested principle of modern international law that the sea, as a general rule, cannot he subjected td appropriation. At the same time, we believe that it is admitted that portions of the sea may be affected by proprietary rights on the part of the States whose territories it adjoins, and that such rights have been more especially recognized in the case of fisheries to which the inhabitants of a neighbouring State have established a claim through immemorial exercise of the right of fishing. There can be no doubt that the rights of which they now claim the exclusive enjoyment have been exercised by the Arabs of these coasts from time immemorial; and we consider, therefore, that the fact of these fisheries being in part outside the limits of territorial waters need not necessarily constitute a conclusive bar to the claim. In the pearl fisheries of Ceylon we have a precedent for the exercise of jurisdiction beyond the 3-mile limit under the Colonial Act of 1811, which authorizes the seizure and condemnation of any boat found within the limits of, or hovering near, the pearl banks extending from G to 21 miles from the coast; and it may be observed that, in the recent Behring 8 ea Arbitration, the United States of America cited the Ceylon precedent as justifying their exercise of possession in, and control over, seal fisheries beyond the zone of territorial waters as ordinarily recognized by international law. It is also worth noting that the above contention is supported by the authority of the Swiss publicist, Yattel, who in his “ Droits des Gens ” remarked, in discussing the question as far back as the eighteenth century, “ Qui doutera que les pecheries de perles de Bahrein et de Ceylan ne puissent legitimernent tomber en propriety ? ” We believe, therefore, that our claim to exclude all foreign pearling vessels from the limits of the fisheries at present worked by the tribes within our protectorate might, if challenged, be defended with a reasonable chance of success. “ There remains, however, the case of foreign exploitation of deep waters outside the sphere in which we believe that it may be shown that immemorial usage and occupation have conferred prescriptive rights. In this still wider area we doubt whether we possess claims in support of which we could appeal to any law or international practice, and we fear that possible detriment to the pearl banks in which we hold prescriptive rights would furnish no valid ground for objecting to legitimate foreign enterprise outside the sphere of Arab occupation; but by authorizing the Chiefs to abstain from all intercourse with such interlopers, and to utilize the powers which they possess of interdicting the importation of foreign diving appliances, of refusing to lend any assistance in men, boats, or in any other form, or, if necessary in the last resort, of removing any such foreigner from their territories, we might succeed in putting such serious impediments in the way of such enterprises as would discourage outsiders from engaging in them. “ The question is fortunately not one in which we are at present called upon to decide as to the exact nature of the rights or the precise limits of the jurisdiction which the several Chiefs possess, and which we, as the paramount Bower, are bound to assert and maintain on their behalf; but in view of the possibility of further attempts, whether by British Companies or by foreign capitalists, we think it advisable to be prepared in advance.171 ■ Part III. Commerce..—( a.) The Pearl Fisheries. We shall therefore be glad to know whether His Majesty’s Government concur in the views above set forth, and to receive any instructions which it may he deemed advisable to issue for the guidance of our local officers in the event of renewed adventures of a more determined character.” II. “We were honoured with your Lordship’s commands, signified in Sir Eldon Gorst’s letter of the i.9th October last transmitting to us the accompanying papers, relative to the question of the steps to be taken to prevent foreign interference with the rights enjoyed by the tribes on the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf in the pearl fisheries, and requesting us to favour your Lordship with our opinion— “ 1 . As to the legal rights of the tribes within, as also without, the 3 -mile territorial limit. “ 2. As to the procedure to he followed in expelling interlopers, and dealing with their boats and fishing appliances. “ We have taken the matter into our consideration, and, in obedience to your Lordship’s commands, have the honour to report— “ 1. That the tribes have a right to the exclusive use of the pearl fisheries within the 3-mile limit, and in any other waters which may justly he considered territorial. “ As regards the fisheries beyond territorial waters, we think that a distinction must be drawn between the banks where the tribes have practised pearl fishing and the deep waters in which no such fishery has been carried on by them. “ As regards the pearl banks, we think that, as a matter of international law, they are capable of being the property of the tribes to the exclusion of all nations. In addition to the passage cited from Vattel, reference may he made to PuffendorfFs treatise ‘I)e jure Naturae et gentium,’ Book IV, chapter v, section 7, and to the recent work of Professor Westlake, ‘ Inter national Law,' Part I, chapter ix, at pp. 186 and 187, and the case of the protection of the Ceylon pearl banks is a striking illustration of the assertion of this right in practice. Whether such rights in fact exist with regard to these particular pearl banks in the Persian Gulf is a question the answer to which cannot be given with any certainty, as it depends on the evidence available of historical facts with reference to the enjoyment of these fisheries by the tribes and the exclusion of others from them. As far as we can judge, upon the materials before us, we think that there are grounds for asserting the existence of such an exclusive right, and we do not think that in point of law the fact that the enjoyment was by the tribes in common would prevent the acquisition of the right in question. Having regard to the relations of His Majesty’s Government with the tribes on the west shore of the Persian Gulf, we think that the existence of this exclusive right may be properly maintained on their behalf by His Majesty’s Government. “ With regard to the deep waters in which pearl fishing has not been carried on by the tribes, we think the case is different. There is here no defined area at the bottom of the sea over which the right of fishing has been exercised to the exclusion of other nations, as there is some ground for saying was the case with regard to the pearl banks. We cannot see that the right claimed by the tribes to exclude other nations from these deeper waters could be asserted with any reasonable chance of success. “ 2. Having regard to the importance of piotecting the deeper waters and to the fact that for the reasons above indicated it cannot he regarded as certain that the right, even to the pearl banks, could be established to the satisfaction of any International Tribunal, we think that it would be preferable to discourage foreign interference by refusing supplies, Ac., as suggested in the papers before us. If such measures prove inadequate it may be necessary, having obtained the authority of the Chiefs for this purpose, to compel the removal of vessels engaged in fishing on the pearl banks. Of course, measures of this kind must be taken with caution, as172 Appendix 2. international complications might result from any precipitate action. It might also he practicable—whether it should he done or not is a matter of policy—to raise the question in a form suitable for decision by The Hague Tribunal. “ Fishing within the territorial waters may of course he prevented. “ Generally. We desire to add that, having regard to the importance of the question to the tribes, and the fact that we cannot be certain of establishing the right claimed, it is probably desirable that the fishing by foreigners should, if possible, be indirectly stopped without raising the question internationally. “We have, &amp;c. (Signed) “B. B. Finlay. “Edward Carson.” III. “ On receipt of your Excellency’s letter of the 10th March, 1904, on the question of the pearl fisheries in the Persian Gulf, I entered into communi cation with the Foreign Office with a view to obtaining the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown upon the legal and international points raised by your Excellency’s Government. “ 2 . I inclose herewith, for the information and guidance of the Government of India, a copy of the correspondence.'^' “ 3. Your Excellency will see that the Law Officers of the Crown have no doubt as to the rights of the tribes in such waters as mav justly he considered territorial. Outside territorial waters, they are inclined to hold that the exclusive rights of the tribes might be maintained to banks in regard to which their exclusive possession is capable of historical proof; but they consider that the point is not free from doubt. In regard to the deeper waters, they are of opinion that there would be no reasonable chance of asserting with success the right of the tribes to debar other nations from dredging. “ 4. In these circumstances, I agree with the general conclusion at which the Law Officers of the Crown have arrived, viz., that it is not expedient to raise the question internationally by forcibly preventing vessels of foreign nationalities from fishing on the hanks. The object in view may probably be attainable by indirect methods.” Summary. The situation in regard to the pearl fisheries may be summarized as follows:— The Law Officers of the Crown have laid it down that outside territorial limits, in the deeper waters, there would be no reasonable chance, on grounds of international law, of asserting with success the right of the tribes to debar other nations from dredging. On the other hand, it is apprehended that dredging operations, if carried out on scientific principles, even in the deeper waters alone, would seriously endanger the success of the pearl fishing on the hanks, in regard to which the tribes may establish exclusive rights. The conclusion formulated in 1905 was accordingly that foreign vessels should not forcibly be prevented from fishing on the banks, but that the object in view might probably be attainable by “indirect methods,” i.e. :— “ By authorizing the Chiefs to abstain from all intercourse with such interlopers, and to utilize the powers which they possess of interdicting the importation of foreign diving appliances, of refusing to lend any assistance in men, boats, or in any other form, or, if necessary, in the last resort, of removing any such foreigner from their territories.” It can hardly be maintained that this solution is satisfactory; the pursuit of such a course, even if effective in its immediate object, might not * * Not printed.Part III. Commerce.—( a.) The Pearl Fisheries. 173 improbably give rise in practice to a sharp diplomatic conflict, and result in the serious discomfiture of His Majesty’s Government, whose guiding principle of free trade m the Gulf would appear as of varying interpretations, while its assertion would clearly be sacrificed to meet the^ exigencies of a critical situation. With the rapid extension of German enterprise in these regions the pearl fisheries are not unlikely to receive considerable attention within the next few years, and it appears eminently desirable to determine whether a situation at pi esent fraught with danger and uncerrainty cannot be regularized in a manner likely to conciliate conflicting interests. His Majesty’s Government are at present on the horns of a dilemma- on the one hand, they cannot prevent dredging operations by foreigners; on the ot er, they are faced with the knowledge that such operations will render destitute a large number of Arabs, who, in default of the pearl fisheries must either starve or turn pirates (see p. 138). For the welfare and the tranquillity of these tribes His Majesty’s Govern ment are by prescription responsible; to secure these objects British lives and money have been sacrificed on a large scale; and to abandon now the policy of a century would be both misguided and pusillanimous. An alternative course would be to approach foreign Governments and to Safemiardin? nf thp explain the peculiarity of the situation; the measures taken in the course of Peripheries the last 100 years to suppress piracy and to maintain order; the interest of all who frequent the Gulf in the tranquillity of the tribes inhabiting the coasts ; the complications to which the introduction of scientific appliances in the pearl fisheries would inevitably give rise; the justice and expediency of securing to the Arabs, under time-honoured conditions, the exclusive enjoyment of ^ a necessary means of livelihood ; and, finally, the prospect of establishing, in the Island of Bahrein, a free mart where merchants of every nation could purchase on equal terms the pearls supplied by native enterprise.(b.)

The report was accompanied by detailed statistics. The main conclusions arrived at were as follows: The enterprise involved, on the admission of the master of one of the German vessels, a dead loss of 1 , 000 /. every voyage, a statement confirmed by the annual report of the Company in Hamburg, thus affording substance to the contention that the service rested upon State aid. It was expected that the earnings of the second year would fall short of those of the first, as British firms had been aroused by competition to increased activity. Statistics alone, however, hardly expressed the spirit of competition engendered by the visits of these steamers, for the monopoly of the service enjoyed by a single firm, Messrs. M onckbaus, in fosteiing theii own com-Appendix 2. Commercial Development Lighthouses. Musandim 178 mercial development, coupled with the keen interest taken in the success of the scheme by the German Government, had aroused an antagonistic feelin? amongst the important British firms in the Gulf ports. Uncertainty as to the ultimate aim of the new undertaking had kept the European mercantile communities in a state of somewhat nervous anticipa tion. Overtures by the Deutsche-Orient Bank of Hamburg to native British traders in Bunder Abbas, an ostentatious forward policy in Lingah, including the flying of the German flag over two native boats, the endeavour to inaugurate relations with the Arab Coast, as well as financial operations in Bushire, and many rumours of other forms of enterprise had added to the perplexity with which the future of German identification with the politics and commerce of Persia was generally regarded. Certain points were indicated in conclusion as deserving of attention with a view to meeting the special forms of German competition :— 1. Reform in the local working of the Bank of Persia. 2. Lighterage from British steamers in British-owned lighters. fi. Gieater regularity in the sailings of British vessels from Persian waters. 4. Establishment of a British Company for transport over the great southern road. 5. More attention to export trade from Southern Persia via Bushire. 6. Hie forestalment of all German schemes of concessions in the valley of the Karun. J 7. Close attention by those firms concerned to the tendencies of German develop ment in the Gulf. ^ 8. The pushing of British sugar and Indian indigo. Action in regard to the first two points is being taken through the India Office and Board oi Trade respectively. The further desiderata, excepting 4 and 6 , might be dealt with by the Board of Trade. Point 4 would require careful consideration, and might perhaps be discussed with Messrs. Lynch Point 6 is already likely to receive the attention of His Majesty’s Legation who have reported fully upon an irrigation project of a Dutch engineer on the Karun. It is incidentally recommended in Mr. Chick’s report that the Imperial Bank of Persia should open a branch at Bahrein. This course is open to objection, since it might lend colour to the contention that Bahrein is Persian territory. On this ground it would seem preferable to encourage the establishment of some bank not connected with Persia—say, the branch of a Bombay house. (c.) Lighthouses [Communicated by Mr. Lovat Eraser.] The following notes are based on conversations with officers of the Navy and Indian Marine, and also with commanders of mail steamers of the British India Company ; further, with political officers. There are at present no lights in the Gulf at all, except a verv small one (a beacon) at the southern point of Koweit Harbour. There is a general consensus of opinion that a light is chiefly wanted on Has Musandim, at the entrance to the Gulf. Eor manifest political reasons this is also desirable. Such a light might be placed—(a) on one of the Quoin Islands; (h) on Musandim Island, the actual point separated from the mainland ; (c) on the mainland behind. All three places are lonely, the climate is bad, supplies would have to be brought from elsewhere, and perhaps there might at first be danger from the local tribesmen. * The replies to these objections are that the location is not more lonely than the island lights in the Bed Sea, the climate can hardly be worse than that, and supplies in the Bed Sea are furnished from Suez. The Musandim light would he actually in sight of Bunder Abbas. I doubt the danger ; steamers * See also p. 137 and Appendix 4. t A Report on Lights in the Persian Gulf was drawn up in 1872 for Kurrachee Harbour.

As to the relative sites, the Quoin Islands are low, and might he difficult of access. The Navy and Mercantile Marine favour Musandim Island ; it would also be a little safer. On political grounds, the mainland is favoured. Mail steamers make Musandim at night going up; in the daytime coming down. No tramp steamer dares to approach Musandim at night. The nautical reasons why a light is very necessary are that it is often very thick and foggy at the entrance to the Gulf, where the water is very deep, and vessels cannot run into soundings. Next, a light is badly needed on one of the islands between Lingah and Bushire. Alternative sites are (a) Ras A1 Mutaf, ( 6 ) Sheikh Shuaib, (c) Keis, (d) Farur. Taking first Farur, it is 465 feet high, with a peculiar outline, having a small peak in the middle. Sailors say they can make it out in the thickest weather. Sheikh Shuaib and Ras A1 Mutaf can generally be located bv soundings. Opinion seems to be in favour of Keis, because it is a sufficient distance from Bushire, and because a good course can be shaped thence, up or down. Thirdly, a light is required on Kubbar Island, south of Koweit, for making Koweit Harbour. The little beacon on the mainland at Ras A1 Arz is very insufficient. All authorities, nautical and otherwise, are in favour of Kubbar Island, which is the property of the Sheikh of Koweit, and easily sup j died. As to Bahrein, there is an outer buoy, but it is difficult to make. Sailors would like to see this buoy replaced by a lightship. The landing is bad, and very shallow for a long distance. Captain Prideaux, the Political Agent, has worked out some sort of scheme by which it might be improved greatly at a moderate cost, I think by reclamation of part of the foreshore. This might be a cheap and useful method of creating additional interests. Bahrein trade is very promising, but better facilities are greatly needed. I think it was here that the “ Viceroy of India ” was stuck on a rock for an hour or two, an incident which passed unrecorded. At the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab there is a buoy laid down by the British India Company, but it is difficult to pick up, almost impossible at night. It ought to be replaced by a lightship. At Bushire there should be a light by the telegraph station. Quite apart from political considerations, lights are badly needed in the Gulf. Navigation there is attended with great danger at night, especially since the speed of mail steamers has been accelerated. (d.) British Cobles. [Communicated by the India Office.] General.

Fao .—The rights of the British Government at Eao were defined in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 3rd September, 1861, “ for the establishment of telegraphic communication between India and the Ottoman territory.” Clauses III-V of this Convention ran as follows :— “ III. His Majesty the Sultan authorizes the establishment on Ottoman territory, at the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab, of a British telegraph office, with a staff, which shall not exceed in number fifty persons, placed under the exclusive orders of a British station-master, and which, as well as the apparatus and all the instruments requisite for working the submarine line, shall be at the expense of the British Government. “ IV. The aforesaid British office shall be located in the same building occupied by the Ottoman station at the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab, with a view to facilitate the combined operations of the common service. “ The apparatus of the Ottoman service and that of the British service at that joint station shall be placed in separate compartments, but in close proximity to each other, and shall not be connected.181 Part III.

The Direction-in-Chief of the mixed station shall devolve on the oman Administration, but without the right of interfering in the internal administration of the British office.” 2. Bushire. As regards our cable stations in Persian territory, the leading document is the Agreement made with the Persian Government in December 1862 for the construction of a line of telegraph via Khanikin on the Turco-Persian frontier, through Tehran overland to Bushire, as an alternative to the line through Turkey to Pao, and thence by cable vi&amp; Bushire to India. It was decided at the time not to make formal application for landing rights on Persian territory for the cable down the Gulf; but an understanding was arriveo at with the Persian Government, in pursuance of which the Persian Minister of Poreign Affairs sent the following instructions to the Governor of Bushire on the 18th May, 1863 “ As you already know, by desire of His Majesty the Shah, the Persian Government are about to construct a telegraph line from the frontier of Kermanshah to Bushire, and the English Government, as they may feel disposed, are at liberty to join their telegraphic wires, which are to be brought by submarine line, to the Persian wires ; it is therefore necessary that they should have a telegraph station on the coast, and His Majesty has ordered that a station should be erected for this purpose at Resheer,* under the directions of the Prince Itizad-u-Sultaneh, which is to be given to the British Government for an annual rent. In the meantime, as the English cable may shortly reach Bushire, and on its arrival they may require a place at once in which to keep their stores and materials before the regular station is completed, you will now at once, after communicating with the Resident and ascertaining the exact spot where the cable will be landed, proceed to erect a building according to the accompanying plan given by the Prince in a suitable position, and get it in readiness, so that they may not suffer in convenience.” .Task .—Landing rights at Task were held to be implied in Article II of the Angio-Persian Convention of the 2nd April, 1868, in which provision was made, in view of the possibility of accident to the Gulf cable, for the “ construction and efficient working of a line of telegraph between Gwadur and a point between Task and Bunder Abbas.” Article II of this Convention contained the provision that “ the English Government will pay annually to the Persian Government the sum of 3,000 tomans for leave to lay down the line of telegraph on these coasts and places which are under the sovereignty of Persia.” The possession of land for a cable station at Jask was, moreover, set forth in the “ Jask Agreement ” of the 2oth Eebruary, 1887, from which the following clause is quoted verbatim:— “ That the telegraph establishment, which is situated at a distance of 300 yards from the point, take possession of 600 yards more to the north of the telegraph establishment, ?.&lt;?., 400 yards from the present boundary fence, * Situated cm the Bushire peninsula, some 6 miles south of the town (Curzon’s “ Persia,” vol. ii, p. 235).182 Appendix 2. between which and the telegraph establishment is a distance of 200 yards, making a total from the end of the promontory to the limits of 900 yards; at the end of these 900 yards a wire boundary will he drawn, and the Government of Jask shall have no right whatsoever on any account whatever to interfere in the interior of those limits.” The Agreement also contained the following clauses :— “It is agreed that if any of the defendants of Jask, other than the true, positive, and salaried servants of the telegraph establishment, in order to take sanctuary or protection, penetrate within the limits, the telegraph officials shall have no right to protect them; on the contrary, they should place them without their boundary, and hand them over to the Government of Jask. “ Any merchant, native or foreign, who may have shops within the limits must pay the usual customs dues on that which he imports in order to trade, buy, or sell.” Chahbnr .—British rights at Chahbar are presumably covered by Article II of the 1868 Convention, by which, in return for an annual payment, the British Government obtained “ leave to lay down the line ot telegraph on these coasts and places which are under the sovereignty of Persia.” Hcnjaw .—The telegraph station at Hen jam w r as established in 1869, on the diversion of the cable from Cape Musandim ; it was abandoned in 1881 and reoccupied in April 1904. As regards the ownership of the island, it should be observed that in 1868, when the question of a telegraph station had arisen, Colonel Belly reported that in his opinion Henjam was a possession of Muscat; but the Government of India of the day elected to proceed in their negotiations for a telegraph station on the assumption that the island belonged to Persia. The Concession granted to the British Government in 1868 was embodied in the following Minute by the Persian Minister of Poreiirn Affairs, dated the 29th March, 1868:—“With respect to permission for the cable telegraph station on the Island of Angaum (Henjam), the number of persons to be employed, and the extent of accommodation to be provided on the said island in accordance with the Memorandum dated the 14th March, and the plans forwarded to the Persian Foreign Office on the 28th of the same month, after being approved by the British Mission, the Persian Ministers, in order to strengthen the friendly relations between the two Governments, will give permission and authority in the manner indicated, provided that the number of employes and extent of the buildings are not allowed at any time to exceed those explained in the Memorandum received from the British Legation.” When our telegraph station was re-established in 1904, in connection with the scheme for establishing telegraphic communication w*ith Bunder Abbas, Sir A. Hardinge informed the Persian Government that “ there is no intention on the part of the Government of India to support any such claim (i.e., to Henjam) of the Chief of Debai [whose subjects the local Arabs claimed to be], or to repudiate the authority of the Persian Government.” The Persian Government, however, chose to assert their authority by sending a Customs officer to the island, much to the resentment ot the local Arabs. A controversy arose with the Persian Government as to the limits to be assigned to our telegraph station and as to the position of a Persian Customs office on the island. The dispute still remains unsettled. Bunder Abbas .—As has already been stated, the Convention of the 2nd April, 1868, empowered the British Government to “ make arrangements with regard to the construction and efficient working of a line of telegraph between Gwadur and a point between Jask and Bunder Abbas.” The question of bringing Bunder Abbas into telegraphic connection with the outer world was definitely raised in 1901. In their despatch of the 21st January, 1904, Lord Curzon’s Government stated that when the Viceroy was at Bunder Abbas, during his visit to the Persian Gulf, “ he was earnestly pressed both by the local traders and also by183 Part III. Commerce.—(^.) British Cables. the Salai-i-Moazzam, Governor of the Gulf ports, to lend his assistance to the connection of Bunder Abbas by telegraph with the outer world ” ; and it was accordingly anticipated that the proposal would prove acceptable to the Persian Government. Difficulty was, however, encountered, and, in \ie\\ of the obstructive attitude of the Persian Government, the cable u as earned back to Ilenjam under the authority of the Concession of i860. Subsequently, this reconnection with Ilenjam being a fait accompli, an Agreement was signed on the 13th May, 1905, by Sir A. Hardinge and the Persian Minister for horeign Affairs for the construction of “a line of telegraph to connect the Indo-European telegraph station at Ilenjam with Bundei Abbas across Kishm. Ihe line was to belong to the Persian Govern ment, but the Indo-European Telegraph Departments were “ to provide the engineers and materials necessary for the construction.” In the second paragraph of this Agreement it was provided that, ‘‘as soon as the line is complete, and the cost of materials and charges of the engineers and tele graph ship have been paid, the line shall be handed over to the Persian .Ministry of telegraphs. Ihe charges to be incurred were not to exceed 75,000 rupees, the payment of which sum wns guaranteed by the Persian Government, It should be added that the Persian Government has not vet paid back the cost of construction, and the line has, in consequence, not yet been handed oyer. The cable house at Bunder Abbas is in charge of an employe of the British Consulate, who receives an allowance from the Indo- European Telegraph Department, but the site of the proposed telegraph office has not yet been settled, the question, like that of the station on Henjam Island, having formed the subject of a prolonged controversy with the Persian Government. Muscat.— The cable from Task to Muscat was completed in 1901, in accordance with an Agreement concluded with the Sultan of Muscat in 1865, stipulating that “ the British Government shall be at liberty to construct one or more telegraphic lines, and to erect telegraph stations in any portion of territory subject to the sovereignty of His Highness, both in Arabia and Mekran, which shall be most convenient to them.” The Sultan of Muscat also agreed to “ afford protection to the best of his ability to the lines of telegraph, the telegraph stations, and the persons employed in their construction and maintenance.” British Rights at former Telegraph Stations in the Gulf. 7 elegraph Island .—Telegraph Island, which lies in Elphinstone Inlet, off the Musandim promontory, was occupied in 1864 “without reference either to the Sultan of Muscat or to any other authoritv” (Minute by Lord Curzon, dated the 6 th October, 1902, forming an inclosure to the Government of India’s despatch of the 23rd October, 1902), for the purpose of erecting a station on the Gulf cable. The station was abandoned in 1869, when the cable was diverted from Musandim to Task and Henjam. Since that date the island has not been occupied by us in any way. The question of our status on Telegraph Island, which appears to be little more than a rock, arose in 1904 in connection with the proposals for selecting naval bases in the Gulf, which were the outcome of Lord Curzon’s visit to those regions. On the 24th August, 1904, His Majesty’s Government sanctioned a proposal of the Government of India to erect flagstaffs on three points at Cape Musandim, of which the site of the old buildings on Telegraph Island was one. The flagstaffs were erected, but, as a result of representations by the Admiralty, it was subsequently decided that two out of the three should be abandoned. It was recognized that Telegraph Island, in view of its occupa tion from 1864 to 1869, stood in a different position from the other sites selected, [376] 3 B184 Appendix l\ * Basra. t and the orders of His Majesty’s Government conveyed in Mr. Brodrick’s telegram to the Viceroy, dated the 31st March, 1905, approved the maintenance of the flagstaff on Telegraph Island “ as a sign of the con tinuance of our occupation of the spot, which first took place in connection with the operations of the Eastern Telegraph Company.” In a despatch dated the 19th May, 1905, the Government of India were requested to reconsider the question of maintaining the flagstaff. They were informed that “the opinion of His Majesty’s Government with regard to the flagstaff on telegraph Island was based on the conclusion,” formulated in the Government of India’s letter of the 23rd October, 1902, “that the juris diction of the Sultan of Muscat over the Makhlab Isthmus and Musaudim promontory was of so uncertain and ineffective a character that it would open to His Majesty’s Government to ignore it ” ; recent local inquiries had materially affected this view of the Sultan’s position, and it was therefore requested that the Government of India “ will again take the question into consideration in the light of the further information now in your possession,” and would inform His Majesty’s Government of their conclusions. It mav be added that, apart from Captain Lorimer’s “local inquiries,” which were alluded to in the despatch, the circumstances had been further modified, inasmuch as the British “ Counter-Case” in The Hague Arbitration regarding Muscat had admitted the sovereignty of the Sultan of Muscat in the Musandim promontory. On the 26th September, 1907, the Government of India recommended that no further action should he taken in the matter, beyond leaving the flagstaff on Telegraph Island where it is, and this proposal is now under the consideration of His Majesty’s Government. Part IV.—CONCLUSION. Mr. T. J. Bennett’s paper {verbatim extracts). Lieutenant Low’s “ History of the Indian Marine.” Sir J. Malcolm’s “ History of Persia.” The political connection of England with the Persian Gulf may be said to begin with the defeat of the Portuguese at Hormuz. The Council at Surat came to an agreement with Shah Abbas, and dispatched a fleet consisting of five ships, which co-operated with the Persians in reducing Hormuz and compelling the Portuguese to take refuge in Muscat. Their power had been rudely shaken by their expulsion from Gombroon, the modern Bunder Abbas, which had become an important trading station on the mainland opposite Hormuz; this was followed by their expulsion in 1622 from Hormuz itself. Prom this time the influence of the English was steadily consolidated. On condition that they maintained two ships of war in the Gulf to safeguard navigation, they were to receive half the customs of Bunder Abbas, and their goods were to be admitted duty free into that port. Their position was, indeed, so far from being an exclusive one that a French and a Dutch factory were established there before the end of the reign of Shah Abbas, who died in 1628. But it is clear, nevertheless, that as time went on the English did acquire an exceptional status in the Gulf, and that at a very early period in the history of the English connection with these waters there may be found the germ of the larger responsibility and influence which this country was afterwards to assume there. The Persians, who at all periods of their history abhorred and dreaded the sea, were glad to secure an under taking from the East India Company at the time of the expulsion of the Portuguese from Hormuz to maintain two ships in the Gulf to protect trade, and six years later the Surat Council went in excess of this stipulation in sending five vessels to revive and increase the trade with Persia, and carry on naval operations against the Portuguese. The rivalry ot the Dutch soon became as embarrassing as that of the Portuguese had been. They sent eight ships to Bussorah,' :!: ' where the English185 Part IV. —Conclusion. had opened trade in 1635, and almost ruined the factory there; at Bunder Abbas they proved such bad neighbours that the Company were forced to remove the hulk of their property to Bussorah,* and though the factory was retained until 1761, for the last century of its existence it was the seat of a very insignificant business. . ^|. )e closing of the establishment at Bunder Abbas was almost immediately followed by the opening of a factory at Bushire, which has since become the political and commercial head-quarters of the British in the Gulf. Ihe Pirman of Ivarim Khan, under which the Bushire factory was established in 1763, was granted to one Price, as “Governor-General for the English nation in the Gulf of Persia,” and to a certain Benjamin Jervis, Besident, in response to a demand for “a grant of their ancient privileges in these kingdoms.” It concedes not only an unbounded, but a virtually exclusive, liberty of trade to the English. A site for a factory, as well as a garden and burial ground, was granted. The servants of the English were to be exempt from the local jurisdiction, and the English were to hoist their own colours, as they had been allowed to do at Bunder Abbas, and to have twenty-one guns for saluting. Taken in connection with a new Eirman, granted in 1788 by Karim Khan’s nephew, who expressed his desire that the English merchants should “sleep in the cradle of security and confidence,” it shows that towards the end of the eighteenth century England had attained a position in the Gulf to which none of her competitors could lay claim. the service that Great Britain rendered to humanity by preserving the peace of the Gulf during the nineteenth century has already been indicated. It found formal embodiment in the maritime truce at first imposed upon the warring Chiefs on the coast in 1836, renewed from time to time, and made perpetual in 1853. In her efforts to put down the Slave Trade Great Britain had no help from any other Power. How extensive it was may be gathered from the fact that in the early thirties the annual imports of slaves into Kurrachee alone amounted to between 700 and 800. The work of policing the Gulf may be less arduous than it was in old days, but the spirit of piracy is latent, and a break in the continuity of British vigilance would be followed by a return of the old disorders. The beneficial effects of our past policy in this regard are frequently seen in the manumission at the Consulate of Muscat of slaves claiming their freedom under Sir Bartle Erere’s Treaty of 1873. jTn one other noteworthy respect Great Britain has contributed in a very substantial degree to the peace of the Gulf and the countries adjacent—in the help which the British authorities, political and naval, have given in the repression of the Arms Traffic. The predominant position which Great Britain has gradually acquired, and the policy evolved from the rights and obligations upon which that predominant position rests, are forcibly demonstrated in a series of official despatches and public statements included in the records of the past half- century. Erom these a selection of three has been made, viz., an extract from a despatch from the Government of India, written in 1870 and entirely approved by the Duke of Argyll as Secretary of State for India; a declara tion made by Lord Lansdowne in the House of Lords in 1903; and a despatch from Sir E. Grey to His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg!!, dated August 1907 :— I. “ Apart from the positive engagements which we have contracted w r ith the Arab Chiefs, and from which it is neither possible nor desirable that we should recede, the present is not a time when we can encourage the revival of old and unfounded claims such as those which Persia now puts forward [to Bahrein]. During the years of peace that have followed the establish ment of our supremacy in the Persian Gulf, trade has enormously increased, and the predatory Arabs have embarked in peaceful and mercantile pursuits ^ Basra f The subject of “ Quarantine ” is dealt with in a separate Memorandum, Appendix 3, p. 205.186 Appendix 2. on the faith of the security which our protectorate affords. British steamers now ply weekly from one end of the Gulf to the other, and our subjects have embarked lari»e capital in the pearl fisheries on the coast and in the commerce of Mesopotamia, Persia, and Arabia. Every day the importance of the Gulf as a commercial highway between Europe and the East is increasing. Even if the political engagements which we have contracted admitted of such a course, and Persia were possessed of an adequate naval force, it would be almost impossible and certainly impolitic to commit to her the guardianship of these vast and varied interests. Any indication on our part even of a desire to do so would probably be followed by the decline of trade, the out break of hostilities, pirac&gt;, and plunder, and a return to the disorder and lawlessness which during the last half-century we have so successfully restrained.” II. “ The noble Lord asked me for a statement of our policy with regard to the Persian Gulf. I think I can iiive him one in a few simple words. It seems to me that our policy should be directed, in the first place, to protect and promote British trade in those waters. In the next place, I do not think that he suggests, or that we should suggest, that those efforts should be directed towards the exclusion of the legitimate trade of other Powers. In the third place—I say it without hesitation—we should regard the establish ment of a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and we should certainly resist it with all the means at our disposal. I say that in no minatory spirit, because, so far as I am aware, no proposals are on foot for the establishment of a foreign naval base in the Persian Gulf. I at least have heard of none ; and I cannot help thinking that the noble Lord waxed almost unnecessarily warm at the idea of such a foreign intrusion, with which, so far as I am aware, we are not at present threatened. Well, the noble Lord then touched upon a series of points connected with our commercial interests in the Gulf. It is impossible, to my mind, to dissociate our commercial and our political interests.” III. “ I have to-day authorized your Excellency by telegraph to sign a Convention with the liussian Government containing Arrangements on the subject of Persia, Afghanistan, and Thibet. “ The Arrangement respecting Persia is limited to the regions of that country touching the respective frontiers of Great Britain and Russia in Asia, and the Persian Gulf is not part of those regions, and is only partly in Persian territory. It has not therefore been considered appropriate to introduce into the Convention a positive declaration respecting special interests possessed by Great Britain in the Gulf, the result of British action in those waters for more than a hundred years. “ His Majesty’s Government have reason to believe that this question will not give rise to ditficulties between the two Governments should develop ments arise which make lurther discussion affecting British interests in the Gulf necessary. Por the Russian Government have in the course of the negotiations leading up to the conclusion of this Arrangement explicitly stated that they do not deny the special interests of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf—a statement of which His Majesty’s Government have formally taken note. In order to make it quite clear that the present Arrangement is not intended to affect the position in the Gulf, and does not imply any change of policy respecting it on the part of Great Britain, His Majesty’s Government think it desirable to draw attention to previous declarations of British policy, and to reaffirm generally previous statements as to British interests in the Persian Gulf and the importance of maintaining them.Pakt IV.— Conclusion. 187 Ilis Majesty s Government will continue to direct all their efforts to the preservation of the status quo in the Gulf and the maintenance of British trade; in doins^ so, they have no desire to exclude the legitimate trade of a nv other Power.” It is abundantly clear from the passage quoted that the vital issues involved in the maintenance of British predominance in the Persian Gulf are appreciated , ^ hut, none the less, the recent activity of the Germans in j pushing their interests in these regions his been so marked that there is . reason, under existing conditions, to fear a serious diminution of our I influence first commercial, but eventually political; and this process cannot but be accelerated if the Baghdad Bailway is completed under German auspices alone. it would seem, accordingly, that the moment has arrived when a policy of constructive action might advantageously be substituted for one which is defensive in character, and practically limited to a declaration, urbi f't orbi, that ITis Majesty s Government will resist by force anv attempt to establish a fortified base in the Persian Gulf—a consummation which is scarcely likely to arise, and which, since the destruction of the Russian fleet and the conclusion of the Anglo-Russian Convention, has passed outside the range of practical diplomacy. Lord Lansdowne’s declaration of May 1903 was made primarily as a warning to Russia, who was then suspected of harbouring designs upon Charbar. It was also intended, though this contingency was considered less likely to arise, to prevent the construction of a fortified terminus of the Baghdad Railway. It is, however, practically certain that the Germans will not stir up a hornet’s nest by doing precisely what His Majesty’s Government are publicly pledged to resist. A policy of gradual commercial absorption has far more to commend it, while, on the other hand, it cannot give rise to legitimate protests on the part of His Majesty's Government. But the whole history of the Persian Gulf, whether in the time of the Portuguese, the Hutch, or the English, has shown that commercial prosperity inevitably leads to political hegemony, and in these circumstances it is matter for grave con sideration whether, on political grounds, exceptional measures should not be taken to facilitate British enterprise in the Persian Gulf, and to neutralize the efforts being made to undermine our existing position. It is to draw attention to these measures that the present Memorandum has been drawn up, and, even if the precise proposals which have been indicated do not meet with approval, it may confidently be said that some change of policy will be called for to meet the exigencies of an altered situation, and that opportunities should be seized or created in order to consolidate our position, and to turn to advantage by timely action the few years which may remain before the advent of the Baghdad Railway.

IN 1822 a Convention was concluded between Captain Bruce, then Resident of the East India Company in the Persian Gulf, and the Vizier of the Prince Governor of Fare, admitting the right of Persia to Bahrein. This Convention was never ratified, but, on the contrary, the arrangement was entirely disavowed by the Government of Bombay, who, as a public mark of their disapprobation, removed Captain Bruce from his post. 2. The India Office have stated that, in 1825, the Persians laid claim to the sovereignty of Bahrein, and that the British Government refused to recognize the claim. 3. Sheikh Abdulla of Bahrein was, in consequence of family dissensions, driven out of the island, and sought to enlist the sympathy of Persia. It was reported to Her Majesty’s Government, in 1844, that the Persian Government intended to take partin the disputes. The Persian Prime Minister was consequently informed that, unless Persia could show a clear and indisputable right to the sovereignty of Bahrein, she must be prepared to encounter, in any scheme of the kind, the active opposition of the British Government. To support further representations, arguments were supplied to Colonel Sheil showing generally the grounds on which Her Majesty’s Government were unable to recognize as valid the claims advanced by Persia to the sovereignty of Bahrein. 4. In February 1848, the Persian Government objected to British interference in the affairs of Bahrein, but were informed that the British Government could not recognize as valid the claims advanced by Persia to the sovereignty of the island. 5. An understanding was arrived at, in 1861, between the Government of India and the India and Foreign Offices, that Bahrein should be regarded as independent and as subject neither to Turkey nor Persia. Subsequently a Treaty was concluded with the Sheikh (as an independent Ruler) for the suppression of piracy, and Her Majesty’s Government refused to concur in a proposal made by the Shah that the sovereignty of Bahrein should be transferred to the Persian Crown. 6. In 1862 the Persian Envoy at Paris complained of the seizure, by British authorities, of a vessel belonging to the Sheikh of Bahrein. Lord Cowley informed him that Her Majesty’s Government could not recognize any claim on the part of Persia to question their proceedings in regard to Bahrein. 7. In reply to a complaint made respecting the proceedings at Bahrein of the British Resident, the Persian Minister in London was informed, on the 5th March, 1869, that the Sheikh of Bahrein was an independent Chief, with whom the British Government had Treaty engagements, and whom they must hold strictly to the performance of those engagements. 8. In the course of negotiations relative to the status of Bahreinese in Persia, the British Charge d’Affaires was instructed, in February 1906, to inform the Persian Government that His Majesty’s Government had never admitted ownership or sovereignty of Persia over Bahrein, and such a claim was wholly inadmissible. He was further to state that His Majesty’s Government considered the island and its inhabitants to be under British protection, and must decline to entertain any further representations on the subject. 9. In 1907 the Persian claim to the sovereignty of Bahrein was again urged, on the ground that it had been acknowledged in the Agreement made in 1822 by Captain Bruce. The British Minister at Tehran reminded the Persian Grand Vizier that this Treaty had been expressly disavowed by the British Government, and that Captain Bruce had been recalled. Sir C. Spring-Rice added, in a later note to the Grand Vizier, that the Shah himself had refused to recognize the stipulations of the Treaty, which had never been ratified.Annex (A). 2gg (2.)

In 1874, m reference to a claim made by the Porte to enforce conscription against natives of Bahrein resident in Bussorah,* the Turkish Ambassador was referred to the communications of 1851 and 1870, distinctly stating that Her Majesty’s Govern ment did not admit the claim of Turkey to consider Bahrein as a part of the Ottoman dominions, and that, if natives of that island applied to British Consuls in Turkey for protection, the latter could not refuse their good offices on behalf of such persons. . An 7 lh74 a pn-atical attack was made upon Bahrein by the Beni Hajir tribe instigated by Nazir-bm-Mobank and other Bahrein exiles, who signed a'Petition ckming the protection of the Purknsh Government. A Memorandum on this subject was handed to the I oite by the British Ambassador, in which it was stated that the British Government could not recognize any rights or pretensions of the Porte over the island. m At Ah . e erid 187 ^ the British Ambassador at Constantinople spoke to the Turkish .Minister, r atvet Bey, about the supposed intention of the Porte to cause a lighthouse to be erected at Bahrein, and pointed out to him that Her Majesty’s Government would not allow the independence of Bahrein to be interfered with from any quaitei, and that any claim on the part of the Porte to sovereignty over Bahrein would not be acquiesced in by them. 7 - 7n i87l&gt; steps were taken by the Governor of Bussorah* to enforce the claims of El Katr merchants against Bahreinese. Sir H. Elliot addressed a note to the Turkish Government on the subject, reminding them of the determination of Her Majesty’s Government to piotect Bahrein against any attack upon its independence. 8. In 1879 the British Ambassador made representations to the Porte respecting the imposition, by the Turkish authorities at Bussorah,* of double taxes on vessels arriving horn Bahrein and Muscat on the ground that those places were Turkish ports He reminded the Porte that His Majesty’s Government had never recognized the ports as belonging to Turkey, and protested against the assumption that they were Turkish ports. ^ 9. Ihe 1 urkish claim to jurisdiction over Bahrein was renewed in 1888, and the Ottoman Government were consequently informed that any attempt to effect a landing at Bahrein would be opposed by force. They were also informed that any claim of the Porte to jurisdiction over the Chief of Bahrein could not be admitted, as Her Majesty s Government regarded him as an independent Ruler, with whom they were in Treaty relations. .10. A question arose in 1892 of the British protection of Bahreinese at Bussorah.* Acting upon instructions, the British Ambassador at Constantinople addressed a note to the Porte, stating that, as Bahrein was under the protection of Her Majesty the Queen of England, no interference by the Ottoman authorities with natives of that island could be admitted. 11. In the same year (1892) a landing of Turkish troops in the island was appre hended, and the Porte was accordingly informed that such action would be opposed by British ships of war. 12. A further communication was made to the Porte in 1893 on the subject of British protection of Bahreinese. This pointed out that the refusal of Her Majesty’s Government to recognize the sovereignty of the Sultan over the island had been consistent and undoubted. It went on to say that, having regard to the engagements towards the Chief of Bahrein undertaken by Her Majesty’s Government, they must continue to maintain the right of their Diplomatic and Consular Officevs in the Ottoman 1839.

The British Ambassador, speaking subsequently to the Grand Vizier on the same subject, stated that, by virtue of the Convention of 1861, the Sheikh of Bahrein must be regarded as entirely independent of Turkish sovereignty. In a further despatch, Sir Clare Ford reported that he had informed the Grand Vizier that the claim of the Porte to treat Bahreinese as Turkish subjects when in Ottoman territory was inadmissible by Her Majesty’s Government, who would extend their protection to natives of Bahrein whenever occasion called for it. 13. It being the reported intention of the Al-bin-Ali tribe to form a settlement at Zobara, with the support of the Turkish Mutessarif of Hasa, the British Ambassador at Constantinople was instructed, in May 1895, to inform the Porte that the formation of such a settlement would constitute a menace to Bahrein. He was also instructed to state that, if the project were proceeded with, the Government of India would be compelled to take measures for the protection of the Chief of that island. Later in the year, in the course of a further remonstrance addressed to the Porte respecting the action of Turkish officials on the El Katr coast, the statement was reiterated that all Turkish claims to Bahrein, which was under the protection of Her Majesty the Queen of England, were totally inadmissible. A Memorandum on this subject was communicated to the Turkish Ambassador on the 23rd August. 1895. It was stated therein that Her Majesty’s Government did not admit that this part of the coast was under Turkish jurisdiction, but that Bahrein was under British protection, and Her Majesty’s Government could not allow any interference with or attack upon it. In a further Memorandum, communicated to the Turkish Ambassador in the following year, it was re-stated that Bahrein was under British protection, and that the Turkish claim to jurisdiction over that portion of the coast of the Persian Gulf in which Zobara was situated could not be admitted. 14. In February 1896 a note verbale was addressed to the Porte by the British Ambassador, requesting the issue of instructions to the Vali of Bussorah* to admit the right of the British Consul to intervene on behalf of Bahrein subjects. The note reminded the Porte that the Chief of Bahrein was under the protection of the Queen of England, and it was, therefore, quite inadmissible that the natives of Bahrein should, when on Ottoman territory, be treated as Turkish subjects. 15. Attention was called by the Porte in 1905 to the measures taken against Bahreinese for the ill-treatment of a German subject. Lord Lansdowne informed the Turkish Ambassador, in reply to his representations on the subject, that it was a matter of common knowledge, and well known to the Turkish Government, that His Majesty’s Government had direct relations with the Sheikh of Bahrein, and that the island and its natives were under British protection. He went on to say that His Majesty’s Government were within their rights in taking measures to obtain redress for the outrage committed there. This statement was repeated later in the year to the Turkish Ambassador, when he was informed that His Majesty’s Government must decline to entertain any further representations from the Turkish Government on the subject. (3.) Turkish Declarations. At an interview, on the 25th April, 1871, between M. Pisani (chief Dragoman to the British Embassy) and the Grand Vizier (Aali Pasha), in reference to a contemplated Turkish Expedition to Nejd, Aali Pasha said the British Ambassador might give the most positive assurances to Her Majesty’s Government that the Porte entertained no intention whatever of obtaining the supremacy over Bahrein. On the 10th December, 1871, an assurance was given, in reference to the Nejd Expedition, by Server Pasha, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, to M. Pisani (first Dragoman of the British Embassy), to the effect that the Sublime Porte had no intention of attacking or obtaining any supremacy over the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf. * Basra.19] ANNEX (B). 1 ersian UndeHaLmgs respecting British Railway Construction in Persia. that no ^o leeill ent of the 11th November, 1890, the Persian Government engaged ‘ the rene™^ he A ^ “ Persia for ten years, on the termination of which period of this en^alementl ]m , me&lt;Jiate ly discussed between the two parties.” The term VizL'info?S tTe PHtth d Ph 0d ! ?• be . en , s ‘ nce Prolonged up to 1910, but the Persian Grand “ Persia won ?I nit h t ( diargd d Affaires in 1902 that he had intimated to Count Lamsdorff that terminate in 1910” a “ re ° ° ^ furt ^ er re newal of the Railway Agreement with Russia, which would Minister‘for Ibireion^Aff 1 ^ 61 ’ ^ ie t * len (Nasir-ud-din), in an autograph rescript to the construction in SoiAhern^ersi^iif th^foUovrin^terms:— preferential rightS in rogard to railway him Ihis n verv t ! 1 nL 00 T ?nd8 n tO ^ E f ellenc P the Minister Plenipotentiary.

We say so now that they may know it.” On the 4th April, 1900, the British Charge d’Affaires at Tehran was instructed to remind the rersian Government of this engagement, and to “make sure that the Shah, i.e., Nasir-ud-din’s successor, the late Muzaffar-ud-din Shah,” was aware of its “ existence.” Mr. Spring-Rice accordingly commumc^ted a copy of the rescript of 1888 in an official note to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs requesting that it might be laid before the Shah. Both the Grand Vizier, to whom a second copy of the communication was given; and the Minister of Foreign Affairs promised that this should be done at once, and Mr Spring-Rice subsequently learnt from the Shah’s doctor that the matter had i to / dls Majesty, and that the latter had seen the document. On the 11th April, 1900 the British Charge d’Affaires, at a farewell interview with the Shah, who was about to start for Europe, thought it best not to mention the subject; but, on withdrawing, he was informed orally by t le Giand A izier tliat the rescript liad been laid before the Shah, “ who regarded it as of binding force. Ihe Grand Vizier added that for the next ten years the question of concessions would not arise owing to the Russian Railway Agreement, but that if the Russians raised it, the Shah would produce his father’s promise to Great Britain. The Minister for Foreign Affairs told Mr. Spring-Rice that this was the answer to his official note. ° . T . he Government of India, on the 2nd September, 1907, raised the question of whether the pledges given in 1888 were affected by the recently concluded Anglo-Russian Agreement. The following reply was sent by telegraph on the 25th September, 1907:— “ In the opinion of the Foreign Office, His Majesty’s Government would be justified by the wording of the 1888 pledge in asking permission to construct a line in Southern Persia, in the event of Russian Government obtaining a Concession to construct one in the north, though they would clearly be prevented by Anglo-Russian Arrangement regarding Persia from constructing a railway as far as Tehran. ° J “ Our position, both in our own and the neutral spheres, is now stronger than before signature of Convention, as Russian Government have, by the new Arrangement, undertaken not 'to oppose Concessions supported by His Majesty’s Government in British sphere, nor without previous discussion in neutral zone either.” 3 D [376] ‘jggga192 Appendix 2.

Question of British Consular Representation in El Hasa and Katif IV, Moharamerah Page 199 205 211 212 Part I.—THE ARMS TRAFFIC. (Communicated by the India Office.) ^ P°. ait 1 io ! 1 i n re g ar d to the arms traffic on the various sections of the Persian Gulf littoral is briefly as follows :— i i ^ us ^ at - Muscat has for many years been an emporium for tbe arms traffic and the trade has now attained to such dimensions that in 1906-7 the total value of the imports of arms and ammunition amounted to 112,338/. The situation is go^ eined by the fact that the Sultan of Muscat has Commercial Treaties with France Holland, and the United States, under the terms of which it would be impossible for him to impose special restrictions on the importation of arms and ammunition into his dominions without the consent of the Powers in question. The result is that arms flow freely into Muscat, and are thence distributed thioughout Persia, Arabia, and Afghanistan. From the last-named country a con siderable proportion of the arms find their way to the tribesmen of the Indian North- II est Frontier, with results which have been described by the Government of India as “ constituting a grave menace to the peace of the border.” To such an alarming extent has this process been going on that in February 1907 the Government of India estimated that out ot the !L7d,000 men belonging to the frontier tribes no less than 94,000 possessed breech-loading rifled arms. The view is pretty generally held that, until Muscat is closed to the importation of arms it will be impossible to place any effective check on the export trade by native dhows to other ports on the Gulf littoral. 'Hie total number of rifles imported from Great Britain into Muscat reached 13,831 in the year 1900. During the two following years there was a marked decline, but in 1904-5 the total number of imported rifles was believed to be not less than 20,000. Recent figures point to a still more remarkable increase, and the custom house returns show that, during the quarter ending the 30th September, 1907, some 10,000 rifles and 7,000,000 cartridges were shipped from the United Kingdom to Muscat. Besides the imports from this country there is known to be a considerable trade with the port of Marseilles. The Government of India calculated in February 1907 that, whereas in 1899-1900 only about one-seventh of the imports were from France, by 1905 the proportion of French arms had risen to two-fifths. M. Go°*uver a local French merchant, who has from time to time lent large sums of money to 'the Sultan, is known to be deeply involved in the arms traffic. Another French merchant M. Caracalla, was reported in July 1906 to have arrived at Muscat, with the apparent intention of taking part in the trade. In the returns for 1906-7 Belgium appears for the first time as an importer of arms into Muscat, though it is believed that rifles of Belgian manufacture have for many years past been imported in considerable numbers.

India Office] to Foreign Office, October 19, 1898. Govern ment of India’s letter of March 31, 1904. Mr. Brod- rick’s telegram of June 24, 1908. Govern ment of India’s letter of February 21, 1907. In 1897 the Government of India determined to make an effort fco check the arms traffic at Muscat, and, accordingly, in January 1898 joint representations were made to the Sultan by the British and Persian Governments, urging him to co-operate in the suppression of the traffic. His Highness fell in with the suggestion, and on the 13th January of that year issued (1) a Notification warning his subjects that the importation of arms and ammunition into India and Persia was illegal; and ( 2 ) a Proclamation authorizing British and Persian vessels of war to search, within Muscat territorial waters, vessels carrying the British, Persian, or Muscat flag, as well as Muscat vessels in Indian and Persian waters, and to confiscate arms and ammuni tion intended for Indian and Persian ports. The right of search does not extend to the vessels of other nations, and, as has been stated above, the terms of his Commercial Treaties render it impossible for the Sultan, without the consent of the Treaty Powers, to impose any general restriction on the import of arms into Muscat. In the same year, 1898, with a view to imposing a further check on the arms traffic in Oman, rules were issued requiring all British subjects possessing arms within the Sultan’s territory to register the same at the British Consulate. It may he doubted, however, whether this measure has done more than throw the trade to an increasing extent into foreign hands. In the same way it seems not unlikely that the action recently taken by the British India Steam Navigation Company to check the smuggling of arms in small quantities by the Company’s steamers in the Gulf may only result in diverting traffic of this kind to vessels which are not placed under such restrictions.* It may be added that the import of arms at Gwadur, the Sultan of Muscat’s dependency on the Mekran coast, was prohibited by a Proclamation issued by 11 is Highness on the 3rd March, 1891. In March 1901, the Government of India proposed that the terms of the Muscat Proclamation of 1898 should be extended so as to cover the export of arms to Turkish ports, and to the territories of the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit, and of the Trucial Chiefs, as well as to “ Indian and Persian ” ports, which already fell within the scope of the Proclamation. This proposal was not carried into effect, it being at the time held undesirable, in view of the Sheikh’s position in regard to the warfare in Central Arabia , 0 to impose any fresh lestrictions on the importation of arms at Koweit. The necessary arrangements with Turkey also presented some difficulty. The Government of India have also from time to time recommended— ( 1 .) That the French Government should he approached with a view to their being induced to agree to the total prohibition of the arms traffic at Muscat; and ( 2 .) That the Porte should be asked to agree to our patrolling the Turkish littoral against arms smugglers, or at least to declare the illegality of the traffic. Neither of these suggestions has hitherto borne fruit. The question was passed in review by the Government of India as recently as February 1907, and the conclusion at which tiiey arrived, after a careful and detailed examination of the case, was that the arms traffic would continue to flourish and increase until an Agreement with France was arrived at, and a complete prohibition was enforced against the importation of arms and ammunition into the territories of the Sultan of Muscat- The whole question will come up for discussion at the forthcoming International Conference at Brussels. Under the Brussels Act of 1890 for regulating the traffic in arms, any one of the Signatory Powers that has occasion to authorize such traffic in territories of its own lying within the region affected by the provisions of the Act, is required to establish a “ public warehouse,” under the control of its local Administration, in which all imported arms must he deposited, and from which they may not be withdrawn without the previous authorization of the Administration. There seems no hope of obtaining the consent of France, and the other Powers having Treaty relations with Muscat, to the Sultan’s prohibiting, proprio motu, the import of arms into his dominions. The only remedy for the present evil would, therefore, appear to be to bring Muscat, at the forthcoming Conference, within the scope of the Brussels Act of 1890, and to enforce there the provisions requiring the establishment of a warehouse under proper supervision. If this is done, two questions will arise:— (a.) What inducement shall be offered to the Sultan, a Sovereign whose indepen- * See below, under Koweit.201 Part I.—The Arms Traffic. -donee has been guaranteed by Great Britain and Prance,, to accept restrictions on a tiamc amounting to 112,338/~. per annum, and yielding a customs revenue of 5,617/. per annum ? (b.) How will it be possible to provide efficient machinery for carrying out the provisions of the Act, without admitting a system of international control inconsistent with the maintenance of the present political predominance of Great Britain ? Hie control of the arms traffic would presumably be vested in the Sultan’s Customs Department. There is thus afforded an additional argument in favour of the Government ol India s proposals,! renewed during the present year, that they should acquiie the control of the Customs Administration of Muscat, guaranteeing the Sultan a minimum income of 20,000 dollars per mensem (25,600/. per annum at the rate of exchange current in 1907). It has been suggested that a suitable compensation to the Viceroy’s Sultan for the loss of income entailed by the prohibition of the arms traffic would be telegram of to double the present subsidy he receives from Indian revenues (5,760/. per annum), and to raise it gradually, as may be necessary, to 15,000/. per annum. It is to he ’ feared that if other Powers contribute towards the compensation paid to His Highness, they will obtain a locus standi for interference in the Muscat Customs Administration, which would constitute a serious disturbance of the status quo. 2. Bahrein. On the 30th April, 1898, the Sheikh of Bahrein, on the advice of the Govem- Besident in the Persian Gulf, agreed “absolutely to prohibit the importation of arms mentof into Bahrein territory or exportation therefrom”; and to enforce the prohibition, he ! nc ^ as issued on the same dav— . f er of J July 7, (1.) A IS otification declaring that the import and export of arms into and from the Islands of Bahrein was absolutely forbidden, and that in future all arms and ammunition imported or exported would be seized and confiscated as property of the State. (2.) A Proclamation conferring on British and Persian vessels of war permission to search vessels carrying the British, Persian, or Bahrein flag in Bahrein territorial waters, as well as Bahrein vessels in Indian or Persian waters, and to confiscate all arms and ammunition (weapons of war) intended for Indian or Persian ports, or for the Islands of Bahrein. v The effect of the prohibition at Bahrein was at once perceptible in the customs returns, the total value of the imports of arms and ammunition, which had amounted to 30,849/. in 1897, falling to 313/. in the following year. In October 1905 the Sheikh of Bahrein addressed a Memorial to the Government of India, in which, among other alleged grievances, he complained of the fact that he was ooliged to interdict the sale of arms, and was thereby deprived of an advantage enjoyed by all the Arab Chiefs along the Arabian coast. He was informed in reply, in May 1906, that the restriction Govern- on the importation of arms at Bahrein had first been imposed in 1895 by himself on ment of his own initiative, and his attention was drawn to the measures he had himself India’s spontaneously taken from time to time to stop the traffic. It was also pointed out to him that the Sheikh of Koweit and the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast had similarly 1906 . prohibited the traffic of arms in their territory, and he was given to understand that the Government of India would not consider for a moment the possibility of cancelling or modifying the Agreement he had concluded with the British Govern ment on this point. There seems good reason to believe that a considerable amount of illicit arms Major Cox traffic goes on at Bahrein. Writing in December 1906, Major Cox furnished evidence to Govem- that the port was rapidly rising to importance as a centre of the trade. The business me “ t in arms there, hitherto confined to one dealer, had been taken over by a Company, December two of the shareholders being friends of Sheikh Esa and opponents of customs 2,1906. reform. He added that the business had been largely extended, and Bahrein was being used as a distribution centre for supplying Persia. 3. Koweit. —On the 24th May, 1900, the Sheikh of Koweit entered into an agree- Govern ment with the British Government, by which he engaged ‘‘absolutely to prohibit the m e“tof importation of arms into Koweit or exportation therefrom.” To carry out this [^trerof engagement he issued on the same day (1) a Notification declaring that “the importa- July 5? tion of arms and ammunition into Koweit and the territory under my control, and 1900. the exportation of the same are absolutely prohibited,” and that ‘ all arms and ammunition imported into any parts of Koweit territory, or exported therefrom, in * i * Value of imports of arms and ammunition in 1906-7; 5,617/. represents 5 per cent, (the amount of tte customs duty at Muscat) on this sum. f See p. 133.202 Appendix 3.

In spite of the above Notification little serious attempt has been made to check the import of arms into Koweit. In April 1904, at a time when tribal warfare was in full progress in the interior of Arabia, the Government of India pointed out that no airangements had as yet oeen made with the Porte for the combined suppression of the traffic, and that the importation of arms was proceeding briskly. In view of the support rendered by the Turks to Bin Rashid, Amir of Nejd, one of the warring Chiefs of the interior, the Government of India were anxious that no additional check should be imposed on the arms traffic at Koweit, which afforded the main source of supply to the rival Chieftain, Bin Saoud, Amir of the Wahabi. It was explained that this did not involve authorizing the Sheikh of Koweit to import arms, or even relaxing measures actually in force, but merely letting matters remain as they were. His Majesty’s Government accepted this view, and the Government of India \\eie informed on the _4th June, 1904, that fresh measures for the prevention of the importation of arms at Koweit would for the present be deferred. The latest reports of the Political Agent at Koweit show that a large and increasing traffic in arms is being carried on at that port. Major Knox, in his Trade Report for 1906-7, drew attention to the large increase during the year in the value of the arms imported in country sailing-boats, and remarked that “the well-known dislike of the British authorities to this traffic, while it has had no effect in checking the import of arms and ammunition, has had the very unfortunate result of losing to a British Company (the British India Steam Navigation Company) the- freight on 13 lakhs worth of goods.” Major Knox found it necessary in May 1906 to remind Sheikh Mubarak formally of his Arms Prohibition of 1900, and to request that it might be more strictly enforced. The Sheikh did not take the reminder in good part, and the Resident in the Persian Gulf gave hi§ opinion that the question was one which might at any time endanger the good relations between the Sheikh and the Political Agent. Major Knox put the case still more strongly in a letter to the Resident. “ The Proclama tion,” he wrote on the 3rd July, 1906, “ is not worth the paper it is written on, and is only a cause of friction.” 4. Trucial Chiefs .—At the close of 1902 the Trucial Chiefs entered into engagements respecting the arms traffic, similar to those of the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit. 5. Turkey .—The importation of arms and munitions of war of all kinds into Turkey was prohibited by an Imperial Decree which was notified to the British Embassy in February 1862. The orders issued under this Decree to the custom-house authorities were communicated to the British Embassy by the Ottoman Government ou the 11th lebruary, 1863. They forbade absolutely the import into any part of the Ottoman Empire of all arms and ammunition, except “ les armes de chasse et de luxe, les armes blanches, tels que sabres, epees et couteaux, et la poudre de chasse en petite quantite, destines a 1’usage prive”; and stated that all contraband articles would be confiscated by the State. On the 4th October, 1893, the Porte made a fresh communication to the Powers, inclosing the Regulations which had 'oeen accepted in the Turco-German Commercial Treaty just then concluded, and notifying them as those in force. The acceptance of these Regulations was not at the time considered opportune by Great Britain and the other Powers, but it would seem that, nevertheless, the Turkish Government continued to regard the Regulations as those in force in the Ottoman dominions. In their despatch of the 30th July, 1903, the Government of India recommended that an endeavour should be made to come to an arrangement with Turkey permitting vessels under the Turkish flag to be searched for arms by British ships of war, or, failing this, that the Porte should be asked to notify formally to His Majesty’s Government that the importation of arms into Ottoman dominions without special licence was prohibited. Sir N. O’Conor, who was consulted on the matter, drew attention to the notifica tions that had already been made by the Turkish Government, and suggested that they might sufficiently serve the purpose the Government of India had in vKw. As regards the right of search, Sir N. O’Conor wrote :—“ In conversation with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, I gathered that the Turkish Government would be203 Part I.—The Arms Traffic. tot «fatThe nvf, 1 ? to'T^ T n ^ end T 0Urs t0 su PP ress the ‘raffle in arms, for a reciprocal Rrivileap • Ur 1S ^ V( ; sse ^ s . «ould only be conceded in excbanee practice wm/bl ^'n r •’ i arran gement wdiicli, howrever one-sided it mi^lit prove in practice, would, in principle, be open to obvious objections ” or inunftions'of wa. 88 i ‘n* PerSian Governmeil t issued a Decree that “no arms territory without The u ■ 38 3U c nS \ Ca P S ’ ? un PO«tor, &amp;c., should enter Persian L ufol^his Diree l, P tn m « 10 i n ,°t Great GOT ernment.” In announcing the wrote L the Lf Jufy ^ ^ Aff&amp;irS introdneincp C m • + July, 18bl. bmce the right of purchasing arms and iVthrou^tltor own ,nt0 - n ersla b ? lon f to t,ie Persian Government, who exercise exclusively confineT to^ 31 ^ apP ° m ed ° fficials ’ and if this absolute right were not wet atowed ti m J : ‘ ^ Gove,,n ™“t, and everybody who thought fit to do so great tovlmmentr n • u SU and in troduce them into the country, this r\sultCt“ .

An action was brought by Messrs. Pracis, limes and Co., who had shipped a consignment of arms bv the Baluchistan, against the Sea Insurance Company, Limited, to recover a loss under a policy of marine insurance on the consignment. This loss the Company had refused to pay on two grounds(1) That the plaintiffs had, when effecting the insurance concealed a fact material to the estimation of the risk, viz., that the importation of arms was forbidden by Persian law ; and (2) that the adventure was illegal, as bein'* m contravention to the law ot nations. Mr. J ustice Bigham, in giving iud&lt;*ment for the plaintiffs, held that “ the import of arms was not illegal according to the law ol lersia, as that law was administered in practice and enjoined,” or, in other words that no real prohibition existed on the importation of arms into Persian ports. As* regards the legality of the act of seizure, the question was determined by the further action brought by Messrs. Pracis, Times and Co. against Captain Carr, R.X. the officer who had seized the “Baluchistan,” for wrongful deprivation of property. [376] 3 G 1 Mr. Thom son to Lord Granville, July 12, 1881 Sir M.

Mr. Justice Grantham, who tried the case in the first instance, found for the defendant, and his judgment, after being reversed by the Court of Appeal, was finally upheld by the House of Lords, on the ground that the seizure had taken place in Muscat territorial waters, and was, under the Sultan’s Proclamation of January 1898, justifiable according to the law of Muscat. On the 1st January, 1900, the Shah promulgated a law reaffirming the prohi bition against the importation into Persia of arms and ammunition, as well as various other commodities. The case of the British steamer “ Hathor,” on hoard of which arms were seized at Bushire in November 1900, led to an Order in Council being issued, on the recommendation of the Law Officers of the Crown, by which the Persian Law of the 1st January, 1900, was made applicable to British subjects, in so far as the provisions respecting arms and ammunition were concerned. It may be said generally that the efforts of the Persian authorities to put down the traffic have been quite ineffectual. “Possibly,” wrote Mr. Grant Huff in July 1906, “ when M. Naus has received the launches, now building for the Persian Government at Bombay ” (since supplied) “ something may be done by the Belgian officials to check the arms traffic. But there is no present likelihood of the Persian Government taking the slightest trouble to put an end to it. Even if they desired to do so, I doubt if they have the power.” The Government of India have done their best to check the trade at the Persian ports. In 1900 a Vice-Consul was appointed to Bunder Abbas, where “ it was hoped that the presence of a British officer might lead to the display of greater vigour in the repression of the illicit importation of arms along the neighbouring portions of the Persian coast.” In 1902 measures were concerted with the Persian Governor- General of Mekran to prevent the importation of arms into Persian Baluchistan, and to impose restrictions on their possession in that province. A further Conference on the subject took place between the Persian officials on the Mekran border and the British frontier officers in 1906, and the desire to cope with the illegal traffic in arms was one of the reasons which led, in the same year, to the temporary appoint ment of Lieutenant G. H. Osfdvie as Vice-Consul at Bam. But the nature of the country is such that, once the consignments are landed and clear of the coast, it is virtually impossible to -catch the caravans conveying them into the interior. This view is confirmed by the Report furnished by Lieutenant Ogilvie, who travelled through Persian Baluchistan in June 1906 on his way to take up his duties at Bam. He said that the local Persian authorities w r ere quite incapable of dealing with the traffic, and that the Afghans employed in smuggling arms up country from the coast were invariably well armed, and could overcome any opposition offered to them with the greatest ease ; and he explained in a later Report that “ the communications in Baluchistan are so unspeakably bad that large caravans, when once they have left the coast, can travel without any fear of inter ference, even if such interference were contemplated by the authorities, and with the utmost secrecy.” It may be added that the Sirdars of Persian Baluchistan are not beyond the suspicion of having a pecuniary interest in the trade. As recently as November 1907 further measures were introduced by the Govern ment of India, at the suggestion of Mr. New, of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, for dealing with the arms traffic on the Mekran coast. These measures included the creation of a small corps of camel sowars to patrol the coast between Jask and Chahbar, in order to collect information about the movements of Afghans, expected consignments of arms, &amp;c., which they will communicate without delay to British ships engaged in the suppression of the trade. How far these measures will be successful remains to be seen. Eor the present the situation may be summarized in the words used by the Government of India in their despatch of the 21st Eebruary, 1907. “ We regard it as certain,” they wrote, “ that effective action for the suppression of the arms trade cannot be taken by the Persian authorities. On the coast, the Belgian Customs officials are few in number, and although, perhaps, willing to give assistance for the suppression of the traffic, they have not the means at their disposal really to take efficient measures to deal with the evil. Inland, as is well known, the Persian authorities are powerless outside the towns, and large caravans can travel by unfrequented routes without the slightest risk of interference.”Part II. —Quarantine. Part II.—QUARANTINE. 205 (Communicated by the India Office.) A. 1 he sanitary defence of the Persian Gulf,” wrote Dr. Theodore Thomson in his Report of the 12th July, 19h6, “has in the past received, and still continues to receive, considerable attention, not only in the interests of countries adjacent thereto, but also because it is maintained by some authorities that cholera and plague are particularly likely to invade these regions by reason of their nearness to, and frequent communication with, India, and thence to extend over-land to Europe. This view was voiced by M. Barr&amp;re, one of the French Delegates at the Inter national Sanitary Conference of 1897, when he classified the Persian Gulf, along with the Red Sea, as the ‘ routes naturelles des maladies pestilentiellesi In relation with this aspect of the matter the question of what measures should be adopted with a view to guarding against the suggested danger to Europe was discussed at the International Sanitary Conferences of 1894, 1897, and 1993; and in each of the Con ventions drawn up at these Conferences clauses were incorporated embodying measures intended to secure this end.” Stated briefly, the Regulations framed under the Paris Convention of 1894, which had special reference to cholera, have in the main been a dead letter. The Regulations contemplated the establishment of a number of sanitary stations, under the control of the Turkish authorities, in the Persian Gulf, and the enforcement of quarantine against arrivnls. The British Government, in adhering to the Convention, refused to accept the Appendix containing the Persian Gulf Regulations, on the grounds (1) that the posts were unnecessary; (2) that Turkey and Persia were too far off to maintain effective control; and (3) that the great expense entailed in establishing the ports would fall chiefly on British shipping, which formed 98 per cent, of the shipping in the Gulf. The scheme was not carried out. When plague appeared in India in 1896 the Constantinople Board of Health* discussed at great length and on repeated occasions the question of new ports and the regime to be applied in the Gulf ports. It w T as ultimately decided to establish a permanent port at Fao, and to repulse plague-infected ships from Bussorah.f A Com mission was sent to Fao to select a site, but nothing further was done, and Fao remained a sanitary office with no lazaret and no sanitary apparatus. In the Venice Sanitary Convention of 1897 provision was made simply for a sanitary station near Bussorahf and another at or in the neighIjourliood of the Island of Ormuz or of Kishm, near the entrance of the Gulf, these stations to be under the control of the Constantinople Board of Health. The establishment of the Ormuz station was to be subject to an agreement between Turkey and Persia. The Indian authorities objected to the proposed station at Ormuz on political grounds, holding that it would give the maritime control of the Persian Gulf to Turkey, and might become a means of harassing British shipping. The proposals were, however, accepted by the British Government, and Persia also ratified the Convention, subject to the reservation that the station at the entrance of the Gulf should be under the Persian flag and should have Persian guards. The provisions of the Venice Conven tion, in so far as they relate to the Persian Gulf, have remained, like those of the 1894 Convention, a dead letter. No lazaret was established at the entrance of the Gulf, and the Bussorahj' lazaret remained, to quote the words of Dr. Clemow, “ the sole and very imperfect quarantine station in those regions.” The Paris Sanitary Convention of 1903, which was ratified in April 1907, provides for the Bussorahj* station as before, and for a sanitary station at Ormuz, both to be under the control of the Constantinople Board of Health. The Convention was signed by the British Delegates, subject to reservations which, it was hoped, would result in the abandonment of the Ormuz scheme. These reservations were (D that the establishment of the Ormuz station should be deferred until the Board of Health * This is a body of international composition, Great Britain being represented on it by Dr. JF. G. Clemow, Physician to His Majesty’s Embassy at Constantinople. Dr. Dickson, Dr. Clemow’s predecessor. Physician to the British Embassy, thus described the Board in January 1898: “Notwithstanding its nominal international character, the Board is in reality a Turkish Department, guided by the real or pretended will of the Sultan, and administered by its Turkish members;” and the British Government has always con sistently maintained the view that the Board “is not independent of the Turkish Government, .... and that the Porte is responsible for all measures adopted on its advice.” | Basra.206 Appendix 3. Sir F. Bertie to Sir E. Grey, December 3, 1906. Mr. Brod- rick to Govern ment of India, September 8, 1905. Viceroy’s telegram of November 6, 1905. had been reformed in the manner provided by the Convention; (2) that nothing should he done to carry out the scheme until the Mixed Commission, on which we, with other European Powers are represented, should have unanimously voted the necessary funds. Doubts were at the same time expressed by His Majesty’s Govern ment, through the British Delegates, as to the necessity for a station near the entrance of the Gulf, which was not proved by the experience of recent years, and as to the suitability of Ormuz, with its unhealthy climate, as a site for the purpose proposed. The Persian Government made a further proposal, in the form of a “ Declaration Additionnelle ” to the Paris Convention, that the station at tbe mouth of the Gulf should be controlled by Persia, and should be placed on the Island of Henjam instead of Ormuz. In this connection Dr. Eaivre was sent by the Drench Government in the early part of 1905 to the Persian Gulf, to ascertain and report whether the Island of Henjam would or would not be more suitable as a site for a “sentinel” station near the entrance of the Gulf than the Island of Ormuz. He reported in September 1905. Stated briefly, his recommendations, which went beyond the terms of his reference and dealt with the whole question of the sanitary defence of the Gulf, were as follows :— 1. That Inzarets should be established at Henjam and Eao, to be controlled respectively by the Persian Government and by the Constantinople Board of Healtli ; and 2. That sanitary stations for purposes of “ observation ” should be erected at Bunder Abbas, Lingab, Bushire, and Mohammerah, under the control of the Persian Government, and at Bussorah, Koweit, Bahrein, Debai, and Muscat, under the control of the Constantinople Board of Health. Dr. Eaivre’s Report did not reach His Majesty’s Government until December 1906. In the meanwhile it had been decided in November 1905 that Dr. Theodore Thomson, of the Local Government Board, should visit the Persian Gulf on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, and report “ on the sanitary requirements of those regions in respect, not only of Persia, but also of Europe, as well as on the question of the need of a sanitary station and the suitability of Ormuz, Henjam, or other sites for the purpose.” The Government of India, who were consulted as to the proposal, agreed that it might be advantageous at any future discussions for the British Government to have at its disposal expert information independent of that collected by Dr. Eaivre, but expressed the earnest hope that “ British opposition to establishment of sanitary station will be uncompromisingly maintained.” It may here be noted that the objec tions of the British Government to the establishment of an international sanitary station in the Persian Gulf, as classified by the Eoreign Office in April 1906, are (1) political, in so far as the station would introduce a certain amount of international control in a sphere of British influence; (2) commercial, as placing within the reach of other Powers a ready means of hampering and restricting the shipping trade with Bombay and Kurrachee, against which a lair pretext for quarantine can always be found, and through which the bulk of English as well as the whole of Indian trade with Persia; (3) sanitary, it being considered that the proposed station, far from acting as a check upon disease, would serve rather to spread that insalubrity which it would be destined to prevent, by subjecting the crews and passengers on the vessels detained, the large majority of which would be British, to the dangers of a pernicious climate and unhealthy surroundings. Dr. Thomson left for India, on his way to the Gulf, in January 1906. His Report, which will be discussed hereafter, was submitted in the following July. The terms of the Persian “ Declaration Additionnelle ” to the 1903 Convention (viz. (1) that the station to be established at the entrance of the Gulf in accordance with the Venice Convention of 1897 should be under Persian, and not international, control; and (2) that it should be placed on the Island of Henjam, and not Ormuz) were communicated by the French Government to the British Ambassador at Paris in December 1905, with an intimation that the Persian proposals were favourably viewed by them. These proposals did not commend themselves to the British Government, partly on the ground that any such arrangement would defeat the object of the British reserves, viz., the postponement of the scheme for a station at the entrance of the Gulf, and partly because they doubted the ability of the Persian— Part II. —Quarantine. 207 point 01 mT Grant 'o'ldf writ^f ^ t 11 , 1 ' 18 for the P llr P 0Se * In regard to this latter r did notS “ the’re k th? r Tr T f hran 0,1 thu 15th &gt;'ovembe?, 1905, said that or any other sanitary measures!'he‘n-S^oui ^ pr ° v . lsio ” s of «'e Convention, quarantine arrangements are under Euronp-iri pn ’ ln those ports where the its present Government” The French Govp 11 10 ’ ■ i0 oa ' as Persia remains under noint and in snnnnrf of fi n • nc 1 ^ovunment, however, continued to press the aSerthe Pe ian nrZJ l . ® r^ 80118 ‘° r ''; hlch Great Britail ' &gt;' ad decided not to P 6 i eisian proposal was tlie incapacity of the Persian Treasure tn tm, X'to'rati yThe p S a°ris Ur (? ed offer '' ere ded^d/P^rsia mi ^ whicli vould rause still fn?th e !?

Sir C. Spring-If ice at the end of 1906 explained the position to Dr. Schneider SirC. President of the^ Tehran Sanitary Council,§ who promised to do his best to prevent Spring-Rice the question being again raised. Dr. Schneider observed, however, that it would to Sir E ‘ greatly facilitate his task, should the matter be brought before the Sanitary Council ? rey ’ if the Government of India would consent to improve the conditions under which’ 1*1907 quarantine measures were at present carried out in the Gulf, i.e., by increasing the European personnel and by supplying disinfection stoves and rat-destroyino* apparatus at each of the live ports (viz., Mohammerah, Bushire, Lingah, Bunder Abbas, and Jask), instead of at Bushire only. Dr. Schneider added that the Persian Government had not the necessary funds at their disposal, and that the expense would necessarily fall on the Indian Government. * In his despatch of the 27th April. 1906, to Sir F. Bertie, Sir E. Grey wrote: “The unsatisfactory state of Persian finances makes it hard to believe that that country would be teady to incur the necessary expenditure, and it would seem clearly indicated that she is relying on outside assistance, and that the scheme may be said to have originated rather in St. Fetersburgh than in Tehran.” t Dr. Thomson further considered that there would “ be advantage to commerce in also fully emfinnino- the sanitary station at Bunder Abbas.” 1 i f &amp; f Basra. $ This body was instituted by the Shah in 1904 as a result of the cholera panic. lr. comprises the European physicians of the Shah as well as several Legation physicians and Persian doctors.

B. ft will be convenient at this stage to give a brief account of the quarantine system hitherto administered in the Persian Gull by officers of the Indian Government. In September 1904 Major Cox, after examining the old records regarding the sanitary control in the Persian Gulf, reported that “ since 1864, and probably before, it has been entirely in our hands; but our control seems to have come into existence auto matically, and I can trace no original arrangements witli the Persian Government.” The appearance of plague at Bombay in the autumn of 1896 rendered it imperative to adopt quarantine precautions in the Gulf. The resources of the Persian Government were unequal to the inauguration of adequate measures, and the task was, with the consent and at the desire of the Persian Government, undertaken by the British Residency at Bushire. After some difficulty, quarantine was placed on satisfactory and efficient footing at Bunder Abbas, Lingah. and Mohammerah, for which the services of assistant surgeons were lent by the Government of India, as well as at Bushire. In August 1903 the Government of India reported that three assistant surgeons were employed exclusively on quarantine duties at Mohammerah, Bunder Abbas, and Lingah, while at Bushire and Jask the duty was done by the assistant surgeons attached to the Residency and the telegraph station respectively. The cost of the quarantine establishment at the first three ports, estimated at 1,480 rupees a-month (1,184/. per annum) was borne by the Persian Government, while a charge of about 310 rupees a-month (272/. per annum) fell upon Indian revenues in respect of the quarantine duties discharged by the doctors at Jask and Bushire. The assistant surgeons were placed under the immediate orders of the Residency Surgeon at Bushire, who was in the executive charge of the quarantine arrangements. Financially, control was vested in the Customs Administration, to whom all fees were made over bv the quarantine officials. Attempts have from time to time been made to undermine the position of the British Quarantine Administration. On the 6th August, 1903, Sir A. Hardinge telegraphed that the Russians were pressing the Persian Government to take the Gulf quarantine arrangements out of the hands of the British doctors and to place them under the Belgian Customs Department. Six days later the Government of India telegraphed that they had “positive proof” that, the Persian Government intended to carry out this suggestion, and recommended that the “ strongest protest should he made against a change so injurious to British interests,” and that His Majesty’s Government should resolutely resist the “ principle that quarantine arrange ments in the Gulf can be subverted, without our knowledge or consent, or that a body of foreigners can be put in expressly to hamper British trade, the tonnage of which is oyer 90 per cent, of the total.” The Persian Government, on being approached by Sir A. Hardinge, disclaimed all intention of removing the British doctors ; but the British Minister was informed by the Persian Minister for Foreign. Affairs that certain complaints against the manner in which they administered the quarantine “ had suggested to the Shah the idea that it might be advisable to establish some closer supervision over their work.” The question was aijain raised in February 1904 by Colonel Kemball’s complaints of interference by the Customs Department in the executive work of the quarantine. The Government of India recommended “that a vigorous protest should at once be made against the disturb;) nee of existing sanitary arrangements, ’ but Sir A. Hardinge preferred to reserve any strong remonstrance until we were confronted with some definite act of encroachment bv the Persian Government itself, further interference on the part of the Customs authorities, coupled with the activity of M. Bussiere, a doctor in the employ of the Customs Department, and attached to the French Vice-Consulate, and also, as subsequently appeared, to the Russian Consulate, at Bushire, again raised the question in an acute form. Repre sentations were made by Sir A. Hardinge to the Persian Government and to M. Nans, the Head of the Persian Customs, with the result that in September 1904 the Grand Vizier promised to send telegraphic orders to Bushire that the Custom-house officers should abstain from interfering in the quarantine auministration of the Gulf ports. The actual text of the instructions sent to the Director-General of Customs, Bushire, was as follows: “You are to abstain as far as possible from all interference with quarantine. Recommend this especially to Bussi&amp;re. At the same time this does not deprive you of the right to report to Tehran any steps by the quarantine officials which may be prejudicial to the Persian Government.” The Grand Vizier told Sir A.209 Part II. —Quarantine. Hmlinge at the same time that he proposed to reopen the question on M. Naus’ return Irom leave. Nothing further was done, however, and the settlement of the ca^e remained tor the time being undisturbed. Aiising out of these incidents, Sir A. Hardinge, in a despatch dated the Sir A. Ibtu August, 1904, proposed that, in order to strengthen our position, the Govern- Hardinge ment or India should decide “ (1) itself to pay the salaries of the Indian doctors in |: 0 Ij0r( ^ tie Gu ports ; and (2) to depute for these duties European rather than, as at ( wne present, native Indian assistant surgeons.” The Government of India doubted the August 16, advantage of raising the former point, unless it was pressed by the Persian Govern- 1904. ment, they considered, moreover, that the “ delegation of quarantine functions to Viceroy’s British-paid officials seems to involve greater derogation from Shah’s dignity than telegram of employment of British officers paid by Persian Government.” The latter recom- 27 ’ mendation, however, was accepted, and the Government of India telegraphed, on the 31st December, 1904, that steps were being taken to provide “ suitable Europeans to replace the present assistant surgeons at Mohammerah and Bunder Abbas as soon as possible,^ and that it was also proposed c&lt; to carry out a like change at other ports in the J (isian Gull if suitable men can be obtained.” In March 1905 the Government of I ndia v ere able to report that the necessary measures had been taken in regard to Mohammerah and Bunder Abbas, and that arrangements were being made for similar action in respect of the other ports. During the year 1906 the question was again to the front. In the middle of September the Darya Begi, Governor of the Persian Gulf, wrote to the Residency Surgeon at Bushire, in his capacity as Chief Quarantine Officer for the Persian Gulf, informing him that the Persian Government would require the Persian flag, as well as the quarantine flag, to be flown, not only on all boats employed in quarantine work, but also on all ships undergoing quarantine in Persian ports. This step was believed to be the outcome of the action of the Russian Consul-General, who had informed the Darya Begi that Russian vessels would, in future, recognize no quarantine authority unless covered by the Persian flag, and that no correspondence would be carried on with the quarantine authorities in English, but only in Persian or Erench. A similar communication was made by the German Consul. Negotia tions took place between the British Legation and the Persian Government, with the result that the latter tacitly dropped the requirement that ships in quarantine should fly the^ Persian flag, on finding that it was contrary to the general practice in other countries. They showed a disposition, however, to maintain their attitude as regards the flying of the Persian flag by boats engaged in quarantine duties. In December 1906 the Russian ship “Trouvor” refused, on the advice of the Russian Consulate, to admit the quarantine officer on board at Bunder Abbas to carry out the inspection laid down by the Venice Convention. The same thing occurred at Lingah, but at Bushire the “ Trouvor ” fulfilled the usual formalities. The Russian Minister at Tehran at first attempted to argue that the conduct of M. Ovseenko, the Russian Consul at Bunder Abbas, was perfectly correct, but he finally agreed to send a telegram to M. Ovseenko enjoining a general compliance with the quarantine rules. Eventually it was settled between the British and Russian Ministers that the question should be disposed of by the Tehran Sanitary Council, and, on her return to Bunder Abbas the “ Trouvor ” accepted the inspection of the Sanitary Officer. Further instances of interference on the part of M. Ovseenko occurred in March 1907, in connection with the British steamer “ Madura ” and the Russian steamer “ Euphrates.” C. In his despatch of the 1st January, 1907, reporting conversations with the Q . President of the Tehran Sanitary Council, the British Minister at Tehran (Sir C. sprin -Rice Spring-Rice) recommended that Dr. Schneider’s suggestions for the increase of the toSir^E. 1Ce European personnel and the improvement of the apparatus of the quarantine stations Grey, in the Gulf should be submitted to the Government of India for their consideration. 29 Q Uary 1 ’ These proposals, it may be noted, went somewhat beyond those made by Dr. Theodore ’ Thomson in his Report of 12th July, 1906, inasmuch as Dr. Schneider contemplated improvements at all five of the Gulf ports, whereas Dr. Thomson’s recommendations, so far as the coast of Persia was concerned,* were limited to perfecting the existing sanitary stations at Mohammerah and Bushire, and possibly improving the station at Bunder Abbas. * Dr. Thomson also proposed the establishment of a station at Koweit, on the Arabian side of the Gulf.210 Appendix 3.

The Government of India, in a telegram dated the 6th February, 1907, expressed their agreement with Dr. Thomson’s recommendations, and their willingness “ to bear, for tire present, the cost of necessary preliminary measures, including supply of disaffecting apparatus at Gulf ports, reserving right of subsequent recovery from the Persian Government in case of Persian ports, and subject, in the case of Koweit, to acquiescence of Sheikh in proposed arrangement.” In April 1907 the British Minister at Tehran telegraphed that an attack might shortly be anticipated upon our control of the quarantine in Southern Persia, and that he trusted that steps would be taken to secure the maintenance of existing arrangements. He subsequently explained that his apprehensions were based upon (1) the impending retirement of the President of the Tehran Sanitary Council who was friendly to British interests, and the possibility of his being replaced by some one hostile; and (2) the frank hostility shown towards our quarantine officers both by the Russian Consul at Bunder Abbas and by the Belgian Customs officials. Sir C. Spring-Rice recommended, in addition to the improvements of the sanitary service on the lines indicated in his despatch of the 1st January, that a communication should be made to the Russian Government to the effect that, in view (1) of the predominance of British trade and shipping; (2) of the impossibility of securing an efficient Persian service ; and (3) of the necessity for good administration, His Majesty’s Government exnected that the Russian Government would offer no objection to the continuance of the present system. His Majesty’s Government decided to postpone making any representations to the Russian Government until the estimates of the cost of the proposed improvements had been received from the Government of India. The outbreak of plague at Bahrein in April 1907 brought into notice the deficiency in the disinfecting equipment of the southern ports, and lent adaitional urgency to the question of improving the sanitary defence of the oulf. With a despatch dated the 19th May, 1907, Sir C. Spring-Rice transmitted a Memorandum by Dr. Schneider, President of the Tehran Sanitary Council, on the measures he recommended for the improvement of the quarantine service. These measures included the appointment of commissioned officers of the medical service to all five ports, and the provision of a stove and Clayton apparatus (for destroying rats, &amp;c.), as well as a reserve stove, at Bush ire. Sir C. Spring-Rice added, in a telegram dated the 30th May, that the Sanitary Council, while strongly approving the measures proposed, did not possess the necessary personnel, appliances, or funds to carry out the scheme, and would be very grateful for the assistance of the Government of India. Sir C. Spring-Bice expressed himself strongly in favour of the proposed improvements being undertaken by the British Government, and in this view the Foreign Office concurred, the following statement of policy being made in Mr. Mallet’s letter of the 21st June, 1907 :— “ During the eleven years in which the control of quarantine arrangements in the Gulf has been in British hands, the Government of India have spent large sums on the service, which would be entirely lost if any change in the control w r eie now to be made ; and Sir E. Grey entirely agrees with His Majesty’s Minister in considering it of great importance, both politically and commercially, to endeavour to maintain the status quo by improving the efficiency of the medical service.” In July 1907 the Sanitary Council reported in favour of an extended scheme of improvement including sanitary stations at Bunder Abbas, Bushire, Mohammerah, Jask, and Lingah, with a mobile service under a European doctor. The Russian representative on the Council proposed that the sanitary service should be in “ strict collaboration with the Customs,” who should use the five small steamers they had recently acquired; he also desired the appointment of the French doctor of the Russian Consulate at Bushire as Inspector-General. Representations were made to the Russian Government, on the 24th July, in which it was pointed out that His Majesty’s Government considered “ the present quarantine arrangements as one of their special interests in the Persian Gulf and a part of the status quo.” (In the 27th July the Russian Minister at Tehran assured Sir C. Spring-Rice that the proposal of the Russian doctor had been made without his knowledge, and that care would be taken to prevent the recurrence of a similar incident. On the 7th November, 1907, the following measures were actually sanctioned by His Majesty’s Government:— 1. The provision of four stoves at Jask, Bunder Abbas, Lingah, and Mohammerah, under the charge of the present assistant surgeons; and of one stove at Bahrein211 Part II. —Quarantine. sSsa-SEnffst zsar.&amp;ass 4 , ™ •*?,- '«• r expenditure on them at about 333/ eStlmated at 1 ’ 2ML ’ and the aimual recurring ?• Il'p Cnnint' ?

(Communicated by the India Office.) the question of British Consular representation in El Hasa and Katif vias raised Govern- by the Government of India in 1904. In a despatch dated the 31st March of that year, Lord Curzons Government represented that the Indian merchants of Bahrein, letter of trading with the mainland, were subjected to many vexatious restrictions bv the March 31 , lurkish Customs farmer, and that official regulations at the Katif custom-house had 1904 - been so used as to destroy the British trade previously established at that place. It was pointed out, in illustration, that the Bania community of Katif had, in 1900, been reduced from one of 70 or 80 persons to a single trader, and, further, that those still desirous of carrying on trade at the port had, in the same year, expressed their willingness to pay, in advance, the cost of maintaining a British Agent to protect their interests on the spot. This request, it was added, was repeated during Lord Curzon’s visit to the Persian Gulf in 1903,f when the British Indian merchants of Bahrein petitioned his Excellency for the appointment of a British Representative to protect their interests at Katif. The Government of India accordingly recommended (1) that the Political Agent at Bahrein should be appointed Vice-Consul for El Hasa, and (2) that a Native Consular Agent should be stationed at Katif. Sir N. O’Conor, who was consulted, thought that these suggestions should not hr N. be pressed for the moment, and his view was accepted by His Majesty’s Government &lt;9,Conor 40 J ^ ’ Lord Lans- * At Jask the quarantine duties are discharged by the assistant surgeon attached to the Eastern June^S Telegraph Department station.

Mr. Spring- Rice, No. 15, March 20, 1900. Mr. Spring- Rice, No. 17, March 27, 1900. In communicating this decision to the Government of India, Mr. Brodrick wrote as follows, in a despatch dated the 5th August, 1904 :—“ It will be seen that His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, . . . . , having regard to the interpretation which the Turkish Government might place on the appointment of a Consular officer for El Hasa, and to the objection they would feel, at present, to recognizing such an officer, does not consider it advisable that effect should be given to the suggestion that the Political Officer at Bahrein should be invested with Vice-Consular jurisdiction over the Turkish district of El Hasa. Eor similar reasons, Sir N. O’Conor is of opinion that the present moment is unsuited for appointing a Native Consular Agent at Katif, and he suggests that the consideration of this proposal should be deferred till the result is seen of the representations which he has addressed to the Turkish Govern ment, in regard to the grievances of the Indian traders, which formed the subject of the Government of India’s letter of the 31st March, 1904. These views are approved by His Majesty’s Government.” In September 1901 the British Consul at Bussorah' :;: ' reported that the necessary instructions had been sent to the Mutessarif of Hasa, regarding the abatement of the excess duties at Katif, of which British Indians had complained; and Mr. Brodrick informed the Government of India, on the 20th December, 1904, that he had intimated to the Eoreign Office that, “ if practical effect is given to these orders, it will be unnecesary to press for the appointment of a Consular Agent at Katif.” The question has not subsequently been raised. Part IV.—MOHAMMERAH.t Sheikh Khazal is the acknowledged Head of the Muhaisen tribe of the Chaab Arabs, livim;- on both sides of the Karun, from near Shuster to its junction with the Shat-el-Arab near Mohammerah, and on the left bank of the Shat-el-Arab from Mohammerah to its mouth, and between the Tigris and the Shat-el-Arab to the west, and to the Jerrish River on the east. As regards the Persian Government, the position of the Sheikh, who murdered his brother, Sheikh Mizal, in 1897, has always been that of a great feudal Prince, who in smaller matters has thought it well to humour the Central Government while remaining at the same time extremely jealous in matters touching his quasi-indepen dence. His attitude to British interests has been friendly, and in striking contrast to that of the Persian officials in South-west Persia. Ever since 1898 the Sheikh has shown himself nervous about his position in the event of the break-up of the Persian Empire, and anxious to obtain guarantees regarding the independence of his territories in certain eventualities. In November 1899, when Sir M. Durand visited the Karun, the Sheikh made a request for assurances. While declining to afford guarantees of the nature desired, Sir M. Durand intimated to him that “ he might rely upon our help whenever we could give it without ill-faith to the Persian Government.” The intention formed by the Central Government in 1900 to include Moham merah in the newly organized Customs system increased the anxiety of the Sheikh to obtain some kind of guarantee, the more so since rumours were prevalent that the contemplated changes would be used as a pretext for putting an end to his power as that of the last of the great feudal Chiefs of Persia. Pears were also entertained that if the Sheikh were forcibly-to resist any such attempts the Persian Government would retaliate by their favourite method of intrigue, and endeavour to crea.te dissension in the Chaab tribe by setting up the nephew of Sheikh Khazal, Sheikh Aboud, who resided at Ahwaz, and was not on the most cordial terms with his uncle. In March 1900 a Memorandum was communicated to the Persian Government by Her Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires. In this paper it was stated that the British Consul-General at Bushire had recently called Lord Salisbury’s attention to the state of affairs at Mohammerah. In order to avoid difficulties in the future his Lordship thought it best that there should be a clear understanding of his views as to the ports of Mohammerah, Bushire, and Bunder Abbas, and other ports of the Gulf. The control of these ports by a foreign Power might lead to a state of tilings which Her Majesty’s Government, in the interests of the Indian Empire, would be t See also Appendix 2, Part II, (y). * Basra.Part IV. —Mohammerah. 213 brume! to re sist . o^Hiis liad been recognized by the Persian Government, who, on the ok c &gt; )ei, 1897, gave a written promise that the customs of Southern Persia slmild never be placed under foreign control and supervision. Her Maiesty’s Government must hold the Persian Government to the strict observance of this engagement. As the Persian Government were aware, far the larger part of the trade of the ah()yc-mentioned ports was British. This trade imposed certain duties upon Her Alejesty s Government, and they could not pass without notice any measure likely ^V tS P osl ^ on anc l prospects. It was from this point of view that the Marquess of Salisbury desired to inform the Persian Government that, in view of British interests m the trade of Mohammerah and in the navigation of the Karun, Her Majts y s Government must insist upon their right to be consulted before any change were made in the administration of the customs or in the position of the S km mi. n claiming such a right of consultation, the Persian Government could ha\e no doubt as to the anxiety of the British Government for the preservation of order, the maintenance of the Persian sovereignty, and the improvement of Persian resouiees. In all these the interests of Her Majesty’s Government were second only to those ot Persia herself. I he reply of the Persian Government was verbal:— •‘Not only in Mohammerah, but in every part of Persia where British interests vcie concerned, the Persian Government, before taking any steps of importance, would consult the British Government, but Persia could not give a definite Agreement 'with regaid to a special point of her territory, as such an Agreement might appear to others like a consent to partition.” On the 10th May, 1900, Lord Salisbury addressed a despatch to Her Maiestv’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran, in which he wrote as follows “ Yo11 should take any opportunity that may offer itself to explain that Her Maiesty’s Government have no desire to diminish, but rather seek to uphold and confirm, the authority of the Persian Government in the southern provinces, and that it is in the interest of Persia, as well as of Great Britain, that they endeavour to prevent the intrusipn of other Powers.” The annexed extracts from a despatch, dated July 1901, from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, show in some detail how the question of giving a British assurance to the Sheikh arose :— “ 1 be Sheikh is evidently nervous about the designs of the Persian Government, and looks to us for assistance and protection. “ If a Russian Consul-General should come to Bushire the Sheikh may, should such support be withheld by us, be tempted to coquet with him, or at any rate to modify to some extent the friendly relations which he has hitherto cultivated with the British Resident at Bushire. “ It is undoubtedly important that he should continue to be our friend and to be guided by our advice, and I am therefore anxious to be able to give him such assurances of support as will prevent his looking for help elsewhere. “ I shall visit him in the coarse of the tour to the Persian Gulf ports which I hope to undertake next October, and I should be grateful if your Lordship would instruct me as to the language which I should hold to him in reply to the questions which he will almost certainly put to me in regard to possible difficulties between himself and the Persian Government. ‘‘My idea is that we should endeavour to persuade him to come to a fair arrangement with the Persian Customs, as it is impossible that M. Naus, in reorganizing that service, can allow so important a port as Mohammerah to remain beyond his control, but that we should, in view of possible Russian activity in Southern Persia, attach him to ourselves by a promise that we will not let his political authority over his tribesmen be destroyed or undermined by the Persian Government. “ I am fully aware of the difficulty of supporting local quasi-hereditary Chiefs who are subjects of the Shah against endeavours by the Persian Government to weaken their positions and extend the power of the Central Government at their expense. Seistan is a case in point. “ At the same time our neglect or reluctance to do this may be taken advantage of to the detriment of our interests by our rivals, and it is clear that Colonel Kemball thinks that some definite assurance of assistance in certain contingencies should be given to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. “ I would propose to urge him to be loyal to the Persian Government, to come, with the help and, if necessary, mediation of His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, to an arrangement with the Customs which would indemnify him for the loss of their administration by himself, and to trust to us to protect him against any attempt from Tehran—in my opinion, a very improbable one—to diminish or encroach upon his authority as Chief over his people. If we give him an assurance that we shall so protect him, we ought to be prepared, in the unlikely contingency of such an attempt as I have suggested, to send a gun-boat to Mohammerah and to let the Persians know Mr. Spring- Rice, No. 27, April 5, 1900. Sir A. Hardinge, No. 118, July 28, 1901.214 Appendix 3. that we shall not acquiesce without good reason to the deposition of the Sheikh, or in interference by the Governor-General of Arabistan in the internal affairs of his tribe. “Your Lordship can, of course, judge better than I to what extent the grant cf such an assurance is in accordance with the general policy of His Majesty’s Government in Southern Persia, and how far it would be wise and safe to give it. It is clear'that the Sheikh is, perhaps, unnecessarily anxious about his future, though no doubt he is more or less trying to bluff us into gi ving him pledges of support; but I would venture to submit that the time' has come for us to decide how far we are prepared to back him up, should the Persian Government, perhaps at Russian instigation, determine to destroy his, so to speak, autonomous position, and what counsel Colonel Kemball and I should give him should he appeal to us, as he seems disposed to do, for our advice.” Sir A. Hardinge, No. 167, December 5, 1902. Sir A. Hardinge, No. 65, April 7, 1904. Consul McDouall, No. 1, August 25, 1904. The upshot of this correspondence was that Sir A. Hardinge informed the Sheikh on the 7th December, 1902, under instructions from Lord Lansdowne, that “ we shall protect Mohammerah against naval attack by a foreign Power, whatever pretext for such action may be alleged, and also, so long as you remain faithful to the Shall and act in accordance with our advice, shall continue to give you our good offices and support.” This assurance was really necessitated by the urgency of arriving at a solution of the question, as Sir A. Hardinge reported in March 1902 that the Russians had been making offers for over a year to reduce the Sheikh of Mohammerah to subjection by force, and that they had been pressing the Persian Government to adopt towards him an uncompromising attitude. The assurance was actually given after an Arrange ment about the Customs had been concluded, largely owing to the friendly intervention of His Majesty’s Government; but it was probably only in consequence of this assurance that the Sheikh consented to avoid friction and to make the new Arrangement work smoothly. On the 24th December, 1903, Sir A. Hardinge addressed a note to the Sheikh confirming the assurance of 1902, and adding that he might rest assured of the support of the British Government so long as he on his side observed the conditions of the Arrangement made with the Persian Government. In 1904 a Russian decoration was conferred on the Sheikh and a Commercial Mission was sent to Mohammerah. One of the principal reasons for avoiding a conflict between the Persian Govern ment and the Sheikh of Mohammerah has been the fear that such an event would raise the much larger question of the Turco-Persian frontier dispute. Mohammerah and the surrounding district have always been a bone of contention between the Turks and the Persians, and only recently the Sheikh expressed his apprehensions to His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire in regard to recent developments at more northerly points of the frontier. The views of his Majesty’s Government are explained in the subjoined despatches. “ Sir Edward (drey to Mr. Marlinq. “(No. 21.) • “ kh, “ Foreign Office, February 25, 1908. “ 1 have received your despatch No. 17 of the 28th ultimo, in which you forward telegraphic correspondence with His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire relative to the apprehensions of the Bheikli of Mohammerah in regard to recent developments on the Turco-Persian frontier. “I concur in your opinion that a gun-boat need not be sent to the Shatt-el-Arab under existing conditions, and 1 consider that when an attack appears more imminent the precise action to be taken by His Majesty’s Government can be determined. “ It would, however, be advisable, in order to allay the Sheikh’s apprehensions, to inform him that His Majesty’s Government are fully alive to the situation, but that they do not anticipate Turkish aggression in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah, and you should instruct Major Cox accordingly.” “ Sir Edward Grey to Sir N. O' Conor. “ (No. 75.) “ Sh’, “ Foreign Office, February 25, 1908. ” I transmit to your Excellency herewith a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran, relative to the apprehensions of the Sheikh of Mohammerah in regard to recent developments on the Turco-Persian frontier. “As you are aware, His Majesty’s Government have been content to allow the Russian Government, as being more closely concerned, to take the lead in regard to making any proposals for arresting the Turkish encroachments so long as they are confined to the northern portion of the frontier ; but it is desirable that your Excellency should clearly understand that the position would be materially altered if there were to be an advance of Ottoman troops to the south, more especially in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah. In this district His Majesty’s Government are not prepared to recognize any other frontier than that laid down by thePart IV. —Mohammerah. 215 mediating Commissioners in 1850, as indicated in red on the accompanying sketch map ; and in this connection I may recall the admission made by the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs to Her Majesty’s Ambassador on the 18th November, 1893, to the effect that ‘ the Turkish Government laid no claim whatever to Mohammerah.’ “ Any disturbance of the status quo at Mohammerah would affect British interests, and might not improbably lead to the active intervention of His Majesty’s Government, who have given the Sheikh certain assurances in regard to his territory. “ Your Excellency should accordingly instruct His Majesty’s Consuls at Bagdad and Bussorah* to furnish by telegraph early information of any aggressive designs in the district in question.” In January 1908 the British Consul-General at Bushire reported that the Sheikh India Oil! was anxious that His Majesty’s Government should guarantee himself and his own 25^1908^ family as heirs in the enjoyment of their present position. Sir E. Grey considered that it would be advisable to maintain an attitude of reserve on this subject. March 18, 1908. APPENDIX 4. LIGHTS AND BUOYS REQUIRED AT PORTS IN THE PERSIAN GULF. Statement by the Director of Naval Intelligence. THE aids to navigation which it is desirable should be provided in the Persian Gulf are indicated below :— Mashat (Chart No. 2869). A light on Maskat Island would be of use for making the port at night. Jaskk Bay (Chart No. 2862). A light on Cape Jaskh would be useful both for entering Jashk Bay and also for vessels bound to and from the Persian Gulf along the coast of Baluchistan and to Karachi. A buoy to mark Mason Shoal would be useful* Ejitrance to Persian Gulf (Chart No. 753). From a navigational point of view, a light on the Persian shore on the point south-west of Taru would be preferable to one on Musandam Island, as it is the less dangerous side and the tide is not so strong. If desirable for political reasons to place the light on the other side, the east point of Musandam Island is considered to be the best place. Bayider Abbas (Plan on Chart No. 2837a). A light on Kishm would be useful. The buoy marking the 3-fathom line off Bander Abbas to be securely moored Linga (Chart No. 35). A small light is shown from a minaret when a mail steamer is expected. This light might be made permanent. No buoys are required. Shah Allum Shoal (Chart No. 28376). A light-vessel to mark this 2^-fathom shoal would be useful, as it lies directly in the track of vessels bound from Linga to Bahrein. 3 K * Basra.216 Appendix 4. Bahrein Harbour (Charts No. 20 and 3380). A good light on Fasht-ad-Dibal, to assist vessels making Bahrein at night, is desirable. A light on Muharrach Island would also be required. Bushire (Chart No. 27). A light is required at Bushire. This light might be placed on Rishahr Point, about 4' south of Bushire. Properly moored buoys are necessary to mark the channel into the inner anchorage. This channel was buoyed in 1904, but the buoys very shortly disappeared. There are also two buoys marking the inner anchorage, but little reliance can evidently be placed on them. Kuweit (Chart No. 22). The beacon on Ras-al-Arz should be lighted. A good light on Jezirat Kubbar is desirable. Fao (Chart No. 1235). A light-vessel should be moored about 4 miles to the south-east of outer buoy. Some additional buoys in the river to Fao would be useful. The buoys and beacons at present in the Persian Gulf are unreliable. The cost of maintenance of these lights and buoys is considered to be roughly about 6,000L a-year. No estimate can be given as to cost of erections. These recommendations are only provisional, and, if it were decided to adopt all or any part of them, it would be necessary to re-survey the localities in order to verify our knowledge, which is based for the most part on very old surveys. It is impossible to say definitely that the actual positions selected are the best possible without calling for a report on each place from some responsible officer after visiting the proposed sites. APPENDIX 5. THE PROVISION OF WIRELESS TELEGRAPH STATIONS IN THE PERSIAN GULF. Statement by the Director of Naval Intelligence. IT is quite possible to establish two stations, which will cover the whole Gulf satisfactorily. One of these should be at Henjam, at the cable station, or at Basidu, on British-owned territory, and connected to the cable station by a land line. The other would be at Bahrein. By this means not only would we connect two British stations, but we should put Bahrein, which is a rapidly growing market, into com munication with the outer world. We would by this means keep the control of the telegraphic communications in British hands and materially assist the development of Bahrein. It would be necessary to instal apparatus in each of these places that would give power sufficient to cover 300 miles. Similar stations in this country canbe put upforabout 5,000L, and if we add 20 per cent, for freight and extra charges we might estimate I2,000Z. for the two. They would have to be entirely self-contained in every way, and would have to produce their own power. This would be the least that would be of any use. A better arrangement would be to have a 500-mile station at Basidu, a 300-mile station at Bahrein, and a 500-mile station at some point in British India that is inIZO Appendix 5. 217 for ^ This . would mean a probable cost of 14,0001. ror me Uult and 7,8001. for the Indian station.

T ai\/t Admiralty, June 10, 1908. 1 ^ AM commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to transmit herewith a copy of a letter (No. 436/1462), dated the 5th ultimo, which has been received from the Commander-in-chief on the East Indies Station, respecting the possibility of establishing wireless telegraph communication between Bahrein Island and Henjam, and to request that it may be laid before the Sub-Committee which is considering the Persian Gulf question. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) C. I. THOMAS. The Secretary, Committee of Imperial Defence, 2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. Commodore Sir G. Warrender to Admiralty. (No. 436/1462.) Sir, “ Hyacinth f at Bombay, May 5, 1908. WITH reference to Admiralty telegram (No. 19) of the 19th March, 1908, on the subject of the proposal to connect Bahrein Island with Henjam by wireless telegraphy, I have the honour to report as follows :— 2. No difficulties have been experienced in the Persian Gulf due to climatic conditions. Atmospherics have occasionally interrupted communication, but “ Hyacinth ” and “ Proserpine” were in constant communication with one another for nearly three weeks, 100 to 150 miles apart, and were only interrupted one night during a storm 3. No actual experiments with earth have yet been made either at Henjam or Bahrein. The former place has a hard and rocky soil, which might render suitable earths, in the usual manner, difficult. At the latter place, where the ground is soft and sandy, and water very close to the surface, I apprehend no difficulty. At Butcher Island, in Bombay Harbour, where the soil is dry, hard, and rocky, 7 miles from the ship, an experimental wireless telegraphy station was established, the * See Enclosure, which contains the result of experiment.218 Appendix 5. earth being coils of 2-incli wire laid on the bare ground. Good results over this short distance were obtained. 4. There was no opportunity for carrying out experiments by “Highflyer” and “ Proserpine,” as the former ship had to return to Bombay for repairs to her crank shaft; neither have I been able to send a ship to Bahrein since the receipt of the above telegram. The Secretary, Admiralty. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) G. WARRENDER, Commodore, Commander-in-chief. APPENDIX 6. THk COST OF THE PROPOSED LIGHTHOUSE AT RAS MUSANDIM.

Estimates have, however, been drawn up for constructing and maintaining lighthouses on Sokotra Island, and at Cape Guardafui, points which possess certain features in common with Ras Musandim. In December 1900 the Indian Government drew up a scheme under which the Chief of Sokotra was to lease a site for a lighthouse on Ras Radressa, and to protectAppendix 6. 219 9 i A e!

J Note.— The above details of cost were obtained from the Board of Trade, and Foreign Office Library, supplemented from 1 arhamentary Reports on the “ Finances. Administration, and Condition of Eo-ypt.” The descriptive details are from the u Admiialty Light List, Charts, and Sailing Directions.” ° The conditions of Ras Musandim are more nearly approached at Sanganeb, the most southerly of tlm above, than at any other Egyptian lighthouse. Sauganeb is a detached reef some 15 nautical miles from Port Sudan. Figures showing the exact cost of maintaining individual Egyptian lighthouses are not available. In 1896, Morice Pasha, when discussing with Lord Cromer the question of an increase in the number of Red Sea lights, mentioned that the annual cost of the six lighthouses then illuminated in the Red Sea was £ E. 5,022, which, together with £ E. 4,090 for the steamer “Aida,” made a total annual charge of £ E. 9,112, the whole Budget for the Mediterranean and Red Sea being £ E. 26,934. In the Budget for 1902 £ E. 4,500 was provided fer the Red Sea lighthouses in respect of salaries of keepers, the amount being distributed as follows :— Newport £ E. 552 Zaffaran # # 711 Ras Gharib # # .. 660 Ashrafi # # 705 Shadwan # # • • 660 The Brothers .. # # # # • • 660 Daedalus • • • • • • • • 552 The life of the lighthouse-keeper in the Red Sea is very trying, and frequent reliefs are necessary ; it was recently found necessary to increase the wages. It is understood that the lighthouse-keepers are mainly Europeans. (An account of an [376] 3 L220 Appendix 6. accident to the Djedalus Lighthouse, in 1900, gives the names of three keepers who escaped, all of whom were Englishmen.) If it were decided to erect a lighthouse at Ras Musandim, arrangements for visits and inspection by a ship would have to be considered. Possibly an agreement could be made with one of the Shipping Companies trading in the Gulf, or with the Perim Coal Company, which is understood to render the service of the Ottoman lighthouses on the east side of the Red Sea. From the above it would appear that the cost of constructing a lighthouse on Ras Musandim would probably be from 40,000L to 50,000Z., and that the cost of maintenance might be reckoned at between 3,000L and 4,000h per annum. A light due of Jd. per ton on the 580,324 tons of shipping that entered Muscat Harbour in 1905-6 would produce a contribution of 1,209/. towards this. C. L. O. APPENDIX 7.

TRADE is carried on throughout the year, both out and home ; the special imports to the Gulf consist of cotton goods, coal, coffee, petroleum, sugar, wood, rice, gunnies, metals, and tea. Exports. Principal exports from Basra: wheat, barley, seeds, dates, liquorice root, ghee, wool, &amp;c. ; from Bnshire : opium, gum, tobacco, dried fruit, cotton, and horses. About 90 per cent, of this trade is carried by British vessels. As a rule there is very little outward cargo to the Gulf, but British vessels secure most of what is offered. Full cargoes can usually be obtained for the homeward voyages. German vessels are usually able to secure fair cargoes of grain homewards, from Basra to continental ports, at lower rates than generally demanded.Appendix 7. 221 Seasons, y t ar is fr ? n ; Se P te ^ber to December.

German Shipping. , Hamburg-American Company have now a monthly service between Hamburg and the Gulf, and their agents in the Gulf—Robert Wbnckhaus and Co.—are doinl their utmost to develop the trade ; they have agencies at Bunder Abbas, Lingah Bahrein, Bushire and Basra. It is believed that their commission on steamer earning and the profits [?] of the import and export trade is not sufficient to keep Europeans at these ports as they do, and the general belief is that they are financially assisted bv the steam-ship Company, or from some other source. ^ It is unquestionable that the Hamburg-American Company are losing heavilv on every voyage of their Gulf steamers. &amp; ^ German trade is bound to increase so long as their steamers run in the Gulf trade, and such increase must be to the detriment of British trade, which hitherto has practically had a monopoly.222 Appendix 7. If the Hamburg-American line can afford—presumably owing to State aid—to go on running at a loss, it stands to reason- that they will in time force some of the British lines to retire. The merchandize carried in the German vessels is no indication of the trade of Germany with the Gulf, for it consists largely of goods which she carries for other r/uropean countries. In the annual report for the Hamburg-American line, 1906, the Directors state, re I ersian-Arabian service which was inaugurated that year, “ We hope that our new enterprise, which at first will demand considerable sacrifices on our part, will prove profitable to German commerce and industry.” The enormous profits made by the Hamburg-American line during the Russo- Japanese war are probably still being used to maintain this position. Some details might possibly be obtained of this. Lines Trading in the Persian Gulf. Between the United Kingdom and the Persian Gulf— (1.) Biitish India Steam Navigation Company (Limited). (Goods are tran shipped at Bombay or Karachi.) (2.) Anglo-Algerian Steam-ship Company (Limited) (Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co.). Monthly. (3.) Bucknall Steamship Lines (Limited). (4.) AVest Hartlepool Steam Navigation Company (Limited). (5.) Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. have also come into the trade recently, and charter occasional steamers for homeward loading. Lines between Hamburg and Persian Gulf— (1.) Hamburg-American Steam Navigation Company. Monthly. Lines between Black Sea and Persian Gulf— (1.) Russian Steam Navigation Company (Limited). Lines between India and Persian Gulf— (1.) British India Steam Navigation Company (Limited). A weekly mail and also cargo service. (2.) Bombay and 1 eisian Steam Navigation Company (Limited). According to cargo offering. The Russian Steam Navigation and Trading Company of Odessa receives a subsidy for its Persian Gulf service. This Company used to maintain seven sailings to the Gulf, generally between September and March ; lately it does not appear to have kept up this number of sailings, and it is rumoured that the subsidy has been, or may be, withdrawn. ^ J Ports of Call. Steamers from Europe en route to the Gulf usually call at Marseilles, Port Said, Port Sudan (?), Djibouti (r 1 ), and Aden, according to cargo offering. They call at Muscat, Bunder Abbas, and Bahrein, provided they have cargo for these ports. All steamers call at Bushire. The terminal port, and port of homeward loading, is Basra. Homeward-bound steamers usually call at the same ports, but this depends on the cargo offering, By far the greater portion of cargo shipped homewards is to the United Kingdom. Steamers from Bombay call at all ports in the Gulf, both out and home. British India Steam Navigation Company. Line No. 13 :— Bombay, Karachi, Muscat, Bushire, Mohammerah, and Basra (weekly), calling at Koweit fortnightly.224 Appendix 7. Basra. For the year 1906 the exports from Basra amounted to 1,644,2201., the imports being valued at 1,387,589L Chief Imports. Barley. Dates. Gall-nuts. Hides and skins. Horses. Opium. Seeds. Wheat. Wool. Most of the grain comes down to the coast in February, as soon as the river is high enough. More than half the export of dates went to London and Mediterranean ports. The sugar imported is mostly from Germany, Belgium, France, and Russia. The four vessels of the Hamburg-American Line which visited the port in 1906 carried imports to the value of 108,6501., and took exports to the value of 87,800Z., besides 3,550 tons of grain, value 13,100Z.

Bushire. During the year, 21st March, 1906, to the 21st March, 1907, there were many complaints concerning the inefficiency of the landing arrangements. The Hamburg- American line inaugurated a line to Persian Gulf ports during the year. The drift of their cargoes was towards Basra and Baghdad, not Bushire, where no appreciable difference was remarked in the quasi-monopoly of the carrying trade hitherto enjoyed by British steamers. Only five out of the seven German ships which called at the port on their way up the Gulf took in export cargo on their voyage down. Imports. Of the total imports the United Kingdom and India together showed a percentage of 70 per cent, as against 65 per cent, in 1905, due chiefly to the very great advance of Indian enterprise. French imports, 102,019Z., of which 97,987Z. represented sugar.Appendix 7 . 225 Austrian imports increased by 36,282i. ; this increase was made up almost entirely y e import ol guns and ammunition for the Persian Government. ^ ussian imports have decreased during the year, due to the non- importation of Ku^sian sugar, and the much reduced imports of kerosene and piece goods. . . im P OTt s from Germany were valued at 24,4591., a falling off of 8051.

This place derives its whole importance as a commercial port from the fact that it is situated at the base of the main caravan tracks to Seistan and the towns in central and south-eastern Persia. From October to March the caravan trade into the interior is at its briskest. During the year 1906 trade generally showed a decrease, due to the unsettled state of the country, following on the illness and death of the Shah. The following lable gives the value of imports and exports during the year 1906 :— Imports. Exports. £ £ United Kingdom .. 90,948 8,563 India 106.184 109,513 Franee .. 41,246 Germany 28,549 Austria-Hungary.. 31,643 United States 30 Russia .. 3,616 10,178 Turkey and Turkish Arabia 1,556 9,388 China 7,462 1,080 Belgium.. 4,144 Japan .. 34 Italy .. 882 Java 7,463 Mauritius 44 Egypt .. 24 355 Sweden.. 4,022 Switzerland 81 125 Muscat .. 1,761 561 Persian ports 21,782 267 Arabia . . 490 Bahrein .. 1,153 Arab coast 2,579 Other countries .. * * j 462 135 Totals .. 351,933 144,387 Thus India and the United Kingdom accounted for 55'9 per cent, of the imports, and 81 ’7 per cent, of the exports in 1906. The fall of imports of tea into the port is due to the efforts made by Russia to divert the tea trade from the Gulf ports to the Batoum-Julfa and Batoum-Ashkabad routes, and the advantages of cheap transit dues and quickness of delivery afforded by these routes, are mainly responsible for the extinction of the considerable importation at Bunder Abbas and transit of tea via Yezd to Northern Persia. The amount of sugar imported has increased largely, and for the most part consisted of French and German varieties. Austria-Hungary supplies most of the soft sugar (crystals). The export of gum almost doubled that of 1905, the greater portion being shippedAppendix 7. 227 y ussian stops for Odessa. The considerable increases in the percentages of goods supp le by r ranee and Austria-Hungary are due to the large quantities of sugar imported from these countries. It is noteworthy that Russia’s import trade has wim e d to vanishing point; indeed, were it not for the heavy subsidy from the ussian Government, the ships of the Russian Steam-ship Company from Odessa cou d not profitably continue to visit the port. German trade has not yet secured a ooting locally, and the increase of 4'G per cent, in the total imports secured by her is mainly due to large consignments of sugar, all of which, however, arrived in British bottoms.

A British linn has been appointed agent for the Standard Oil Company of New York ; this is with a view to replacing the Russian oil which has hitherto been imported by British Indians. In August 1906 a local German firm became agents for the Hamburg-American Company, of which Company four vessels brought on an average 738 packages to the port between August and December. A considerable quantity of the cargo carried by the German steamers has come from France, Austna, Fast Africa, and Afuscat, while much of the cargo, which in previous years has been simply shown as imported from India by the British India Steam Navigation Company, has come really from Europe, including Germany, being transhipped at Bombay. Seventy-one British steamers visited Bahrein on the voyage up the Gulf. Thirty-seven British steamers called on the return journey. 1,200 pilgrims were brought back from Jedda by three vessels of the Bombay-Persian Navigation Company in Alarch and April. 1,000 pilgrims were taken away by three steamers of the same Company in November and December. 120 were carried by two steamers of the Hamburg-American line.

'I'HE following Memorandum has been written with the object ot showing the position of British 1 rade in the Persian Gulf. Before stating the facts, as far as they are available, it may be permissible to refer to the steps which it might be possible for H.M. Government to take to strengthen the commercial position ol Great Britain in the Gulf:—237 SECTION (A). STEPS WHICH MIGHT BE TAKEN TO STRENGTHEN THE COMMERCIAL POSITION OF GREAT BRITAIN IN THE PERSIAN GULF. , Tr'^ e Combine trading in the Persian Gull has recently been approached by Herr Ballm with the object of ascertaining whether those Companies would be isposed to enter into some arrangement with the Hamburg-Amerika Line with a view to sharing profits in some form or another. ^uch an arrangement, if carried out, might result in serious consequences to British commercial interests in the Persian Gulf, and also to British exporters in the United Kingdom, if the amalgamation was presently dominated by German interests. Should the capital or the personnel of the Directors and the Management become argely German, the amalgamation might become, for all practical purposes, a German concern, even though all the vessels might not be flying the German flag. The whole policy of the amalgamation would probably be directed to secure for Germany as much of the trade of the Gulf as possible, and generally to push German interests, commercial and political. It is now, however, understood that Herr Ballin does not proceed with his original proposal, but that he has put forward another proposal, namely, that the British steamship lines trading in the Gulf should enter into an arrangement with the Hamburg-Amerika Line with the object of avoiding rate cutting. . Though this last suggestion of Herr Ballin’s does not on the face of it seem fraught With such danger to British interests in the Persian Gulf as his first proposal, there is a not inconsiderable danger ot the Germans getting the best of any arrangement fixing minimum rates of freight, and in consequence damaging the trade of the “Combine,” and of British exporters to the Gulf. And should these he the results, the German line will have succeeded in avoiding the cost of fighting the “ Combine,” and in getting the better of them by other means. The^ dangers, from a British point of view, which should be carefully guarded against, if indeed they can be guarded against, in making any agreement between British and German shipping lines as to minimum rates of freight would appear to be as follows:— (a) The German shipping lines are in close connection with the German Govern ment. The German railways are State railways, and they give low rates for goods for export. These rates can easily be obtained by any exporter. In the event of competition between British and German goods in a neutral market, competing merchants and manufacturers would have to take into account :— (1) Railway carriage to port of shipment. (2) Sea carriage thence to port of delivery. Assuming British and German ships to come to an agreement as to (2), it is then possible for German manufacturers to go to the State railways and get (1) reduced. As things are, British manufacturers could not get a similar reduction. The German trade would increase, and the British share fall. Consequently the amount of goods which the British steamship lines would have oflering would decline, and they would be precluded by their agreement with the German lines from endeavouring to tempt more freight by lowering charges. (b) There is a further and more serious danger. In the effort to develop trade with the Levant and East Africa, the Germans have established a system of through rates (combined railway and shipping) from inland towns of Germany to numerous ports in the Levant and East Africa.238 Appendix 8. Inasmuch as the system has been successful, and applies to Syrian ports, and in the north to Haidar Pascha, it appears highly probable that it may be extended to the Persian Gulf. The division of these through freights between tne railways and the favoured shipping companies is kept secret, but it is well known that the railway share is very low, much lower than the ordinary charge for the carriage of similar goods, and probably lower than the actual cost of carriage. from \h« l C S exten !, the lilles *° the Levant and East Africa practically receive subsidies wfth ^ German Government. The Levant lines are alleged to be in an agreement with British lines as to minimum freights, but inasmuch as the German through rates ere described are weight rates and not measurement rates, and the division of the t rough rate is kept secret, it is impossible to tell how much the German lines actually receive A ton weight of textiles may measure anything from 1 to 2| tons ; with only weight ton rates quoted in the German rate books, and with no knowledge of the ivision between the railways and the shipping companies the British shipowner finds rLlly charging 01 qmte ’ imp ° SSlble t0 tel1 what the Germari shipping companies are 11 T AluJ h[l f ng World ” and the “ Manchester Guardian” have both recently a eged that, under cover of these through rates, the German Levant lines are actuallV carrying some classes of goods, especially textiles, which constitute the most important pait of British trade with the Levant and with Mesopotamia, at much less than the mmnnum rates agreed on with the British lines, and such evidence as is available suggests that there is a measure of truth in the charge. Pnl/b the lT e i Ut ° f a M a f een J ent between British and German lines to the Persian fl . ’ 1 W ° + U d b , e P 0ssi ) )le b* ‘the Germans, by the highly probable extension of the rough rate system to the Gulf, to violate the agreement with little risk of detection or rather of conviction. ctcotiuu, ,•« wE ma I bG P omt ®b 0 ut that even if an agreement as to freights is entered into, there is nothing to prevent the Ham burg-Amerika Line from receiving a subsidy. 1 ,, + t Urt ! 1 1 er, when 1 on ? ethe “ Combine ' hys ente,, ed into an agreement not to charge ess t lan the agreed minimum rates, they would be prevented from making in the future any reductions which may appear desirable to meet such reductions in the cost of transport as the Germans may obtain by the development of the Baghdad Railway. t&gt;V, S . t j heiefore f ? r government to consider whether by some means or another utish companies should be induced to continue to act independently of the Hambuig-Amei ika Line for at least two or three years. Ibe present opportunity of opposing the Hamburg-Amerika Line in the Gulf under such favourable circumstances is not likely to occur again. It is obviously an inconvenient time for Herr Ballin to fight, or he would not‘ show such anxiety to come to an immediate arrangement with the Combine. J He no doubt has been carrying on the Persian Gulf trade at a considerable loss and as German commercial and financial prospects are not so good now as they were’ is difficulties ^ the immediate future may be greater than they have been in the past.’ His export trade to the Gulf is very precarious, and his commercial interests there are not so numerous nor so well established as those of Great Britain. ater, when the Baghdad Railway is in a more advanced state than at present, the prospects of the Hamburg-Amerika Line will be brighter, and, further, by then the Breimans may have improved their commercial interests in Southern Persia. t seems highly probable that Herr Ballin is anxious to tide over the next few years, during which time his trade is not likely to increase much, without incurring unnecessarily heavy losses. » i p- ^ be is able to keep his line of steamships in working order, pending the com pletion of the Baghdad Railway, and the general improvement of German commercial prospects in Turkish and Persian territory, he may then be in a position to become a very serious competitor with the British Combine, and perhaps even compete with t le Bntish India Steamship Company running between the Gulf and Bombay. It may not be possible to get rid of the Hamburg-Amerika Line from the Gulf even after hard struggle^ but acute competition, at any rate for the next two years’ would probably enable this count™ o -x- • o ’ would probably enable this country to acquire a more favourable position in Southern ase if the British Combine and the Hamburg-Amerika Line Persia, than would be the case entered into an alliance. If Herr Balhn is forced to fight the Combine, he might be assisted by receiving a subsidy from the German Government, or by the Shareholders in the Ham burg-Amerd? a me consenting to spend the profits made elsewhere upon bolstering up the Persian239 Section (A). Gulf trade, or favourable railway rates might be given by the German State railways to goods destined for the Persian Gulf, though, as has been pointed out, the latter form of subsidy might be given, even if an arrangement was made with the British lines. , . other hand, Herr Ball in will have to spend more money than at present, if ue carries out Ids threats of further reducing freights, and of sending bis boats to Liverpool and Manchester to compete with the steamers of the Combine in those ports. So far as the British exporter is concerned he would of course be the gainer if open competition existed between the British Combine and the Hamburg-Amerika Line. It would therefore be a question for H. M. Government to decide— [a) Whether the Hamburg-Amerika Line should be opposed in the Persian Gulf for the next few years. (/&gt;) Whether it is desirable that any arrangement should be made between the Combine and the Hamburg-Amerika Line, and, if so, whether one could be devised which would secure that British interests should not be directly or indirectly damnified. Apart from the problem of meeting the competition of the Hamburg-Amerika Line in the Persian Gulf, it is suggested that it is worthy of consideration whether the steamers belonging to the Combine should not carry Mails between the United Kingdom and the Gulf, in order to give British traders in or with the Gulf the advantage of more frequent postal communication. At the present time there is one post a week, the mails being carried by the British India Company, via Bombay. This Company also delivers letters by a slower steamer at smaller places at which the weekly mail steamer does not stop. In the event of an arrangement being made with the Combine to carry mails, letters would get to Muscat in about the same time as the mails via Bombay, and it would no doubt be an advantage to British trade if additional postal facilities were available. Assuming that the Baghdad railway is carried down to the Gulf by the Germans, and that the portion from the Gulf to Baghdad is not in British hands, it would seem very desirable, if it were possible, for H.M. Government to promote the purchase of the Turkish steamers, six in number, which are at present running on the Tigris and Euphrates (in addition to the three steamers of Messrs. Lynch and Co.), and to obtain concessions for a period of years for a monopoly of the transit service on those rivers. It would appear to be very undesirable, from the point of view of British commercial interests, to allow the Germans to have the sole monopoly and control of the railway and river communications between Baghdad and the Gulf. In the first place, if the Germans had the control of the rates for railway and river traffic, they would manipulate them to the advantage of German traders, or give preference in other ways, to the disadvantage of British traders. If Great Britain had the control of the river communications, it would give her the means of fighting the German railway charges and arrangements. Again, it would be the object, and perhaps the duty, of the German officials of the railway, some of whom might be likely to be there as much on account of their com mercial as their railway experience, to push commerce in the interests of German exporters and importers, throughout the valuable trade districts of Mesopotamia. In these circumstances, it would be desirable for the British flag to be seen on the Tigris and Euphrates, if only for the purpose of demonstrating that Great Britain had not renounced her commercial activities in Mesopotamia. It would also seem desirable, from a commercial point of view, to obtain sole control of the Karun Elver traffic. At present there are two steamers on the lower Karun River, running from Mohammerah to Ahwaz. One belongs to Messrs. Lynch and the other to a Persian. Between the upper and the lower rivers is a waterfall at Ahwaz, over which the goods intended for the upper river have to pass by a light railway. This railway is in the hands of a Persian, who has a concession. Messrs. Lynch have to send their goods by this line in order to get them from the upper to the lower river. This river will become more valuable when the country quiets down, and better trade can be established to Hamadan and Ispahan, on the Luristan and Bakhtiari roads respectively. It might be inconvenient if the Germans secured the concession from this Persian It is also suggested that it would be very undesirable if a Foreign Power obtained concessions for the more important roads in Southern Persia leading to the principal borts.240 Appendix 8. . Should these roads be under the control of a Foreign Power high tolls might be charged, and preference given in various ways to the goods of that Power. And further, the trade ol the district, through which the roads passed, would piopably be taken away from Great Britain, owing to the opportunities of exercising their influence which the Power holding the roads would possess. It would^ seem desirable that Great Britain should secure concessions for the repairing, maintenance, and policing of the roads leading up from Bundar Abbas, from Busline, and from Mohammerah Also that landing, clearing, warehousing, forwarding, and delivery businesses should be established. It has been suggested that the British and Indian Governments should promote transport companies for this purpose. It may be added that the road out of Bag’hdad towards Khanykin, leading to Hamadan and Tehran is a very important one from a trade point of view, and if a concession for a portion of that could be acquired it might be a great advantage, or, possibly, a short line of railway could be built by the British from Baghdad towards Khanykin, and this perhaps might be linked up to a R-ussian line when it approached the Russian sphere. the lighterage atrangements in the Gulf are notoriously inefficient, and in the interests of the shipping industry should be improved- 1 he question of lighterage at Bushire is especially important. The work there is at present undertaken by a Persian or Armenian, who has contracted to effect the landing of merchandise at fixed rates. It would appear very undesirable that the lighterage should be done by the Geimans. and it is suggested that the British India Company might be asked to provide the whole of the lighterage service in the Gulf, or that that Company should ■undertake it in conjunction with the Combine. How far it would be necessary to obtain concessions for this purpose would be a matter for enquiry. 1 he purchase of the necessary lighters would be a comparatively small matter as regards cost, and the charges for the service might pay a reasonable rate of interest on capital expended. As regards provision of buoys in the Gulf, it is understood that the British India Company have already put down a certain number. But it would no doubt be in the interests of British shipping to have the matter carefully examined, and buoys placed wherever necessary. It is suggested that the British India Company 7 , by 7 agreement with H.M. Government, might perfect this service, and keep all the buoys in proper repair. With regard to the lighting in the Gulf, it is understood that this question is being considered by the Committee. Warehouses and storage depots are required on the quays of the principal ports for merchandise when landed, and for receiving it when brought from the interior for shipment. It is stated that goods have often to lie out in the open, exposed to the weather, ami suffer much in consequence. It is for H.M. Government to consider how far concessions can be acquired from the Persian authorities to enable the British steamship companies to erect suitable storage accommodation on the quays at Bundar Abbas, Bushire, Mohammerah, and Basra. It is stated that it would be desirable to provide better wharfage and harbour accommodation at Bushire and other ports. In view of the probable establishment of a German Bank at Baghdad, it would seem very desirable that a British Bank should be opened there. It would be a distilict disadvantage to British traders if their banking affairs were in the hands of foreigners, to whom their position and operations would become fully known, and their competitors advised. It is suggested that German schemes for obtaining concessions likely to be detrimental to British trade interests in Mesopotamia, Southern Persia, and the Gulf, should be anticipated whenever possible. Possibly a British Consular Officer might be stationed at Debai to which place much of the business formerly done at Lingah has been transferred. The Political Resident at Bahrain might be assisted by a paid Vice-Consul. It may, perhaps, be added that, although the interests of the British Combine, of the British India Steamship’s Company, and of Messrs. Lynch may clash in some directions, in view of the threatened German competition in Persia and the Gulf, these companies should be advised to act together so far as possible, concerted action being calculated to strengthen the British commercial position as a whole, and consequently, in the long run, the several interests of the parties concerned.241 SECTION (B). BRITISH COMMERCIAL POSITION IN THE PERSIAN GULF, AND GERMAN COMPETITION. At the time of Mr. Maclean’s Commercial Mission for the Board of Trade to Persia in 1903, and Colonel Newcomen’s Mission on behalf of the Indian Government in 1904, the only competition to be feared by British trade in the Persian Gulf appears to have been that of Russia. Since that time a marked difference is noticeable, and efforts are being made in many directions by the Germans to obtain a commercial footing in the Gulf. Thus, in August, 1906, a monthly service to the Persian Gulf was established by the Hamburg—Amerika Steamship Company. The German firm of R. Wonckhaus and Co., who had for some time previously been carrying on business at various ports of the Persian Gulf, were appointed agents of the Hamburg-Amerika Line in the Gulf; and it is of interest to observe that Mr. Wonckhaus acts as the German Consular representative at Basra. Further, the firm of Wonckhaus have acquired practically the whole of the mother-of-pearl shell trade in the Gulf. Again, the Germans have obtained a concession for a German bank in Persia, with a central office in Teheran and branches in other towns, and it is stated that the Deutsche Orient Bank intend to open a branch at Bagdad. Recently German agents have been in Persia and in the neighbourhood of the Gulf surveying the country, and inquiring into commercial matters with a view to obtaining concessions and increasing their commercial influence, it is also stated that more German Consuls are likely to be established in Persia. As an illustration of the anxiety of the Germans to push their interests in Persia, the following extract from the “ Times,” of February 12, 1908, is of interest:— “ The German School at Teheran .—According to a telegram from Teheran in the “Berliner Tageblatt,” the Shah has promised to pay an annual subsidy of £2,500 to the German school for a period of twenty-five years. This subsidy, which was to have been granted on the Emperor William’s birthday last month, is to be guaranteed by a lien on the Customs revenues. The school will be required to maintain a staff of teachers who have studied at a University and to form a training class for teachers in the Persian schools. This arrangement is regarded as securing for Germany an influence upon the younger generation in Persia.” It is reported by the special correspondent of the “ Times ” at Teheran on February 22, 1908, that the Persian Government had decided to remove all the Belgians in its Customs Service, and substitute Germans for them. He adds that though Ministers have denied this the matter has been seriously discussed in responsible quarters with the idea that its adoption might enable Persia to contract a small loan in Germany. The activity of the Germans in Persian and Turkish Territory, their expenditure of capital on railways, roads, and commercial advancement, combined with the development of Northern Persia by the Russians, points to a considerable expansion of trade in the Persian Gulf in the future, of which it is hoped that British traders and British shipping interests will be able to secure and retain a considerable share. Major Cox, H.M. Consul-General, writing from Bushire in December, 1907, points out that if British shipping companies and traders can only be induced to rouse them selves, and look to the weak spots in their armour, there is as yet no reason to be seriously apprehensive of the effect of the German competition lately inaugurated, but that it may rather prove a useful corrective and stimulant. He adds, however, that, having regard to the existing political outlook, the early capture of prominent commercial points of advantage is likely to assist Great Britain materially in combating the evident efforts of Germany to create vested interests on which she may ultimately base a claim to be associated with the political, as well as the commercial future of Southern Persia in the Gulf. (1.)—The Hambueg-Amerika Line and British Shipping in the Gulf. (a) The Hamburg-Amerika Line. In Augu.-t, 1906, the Hamburg-Amerika Line opened a monthly service ot steamers to the Persian Gulf. The ports of call of the Hamburg-Amerika Line are'42 Appendix 8.—Section (B). Muskat, Bundar Abbas, Lingah, Bushire, and Basra, and, if inducement offers Bahrein and Mobammerah. 1 he monthly sailings for the first year were effected by the following steamers in the order shown :— S.S. Canadia Tons. S.S. Savoia Tons, 2,614 „ Sicilia 2.926 Canadia .. „ Savoia 2,614 ,, Teutonia .. 3,060 „ Huugaria .. — ,, Assyria .. 2,530 „ Canadia — „ Savoia 2,614 „ Assyria 2,530 „ Sicilia 2,926 n the Annual Report of the Hamburg—Ainerika Line, 1907, the Directors say: Our Persian-Arabic service was among those branches of* our trade which were affected n u ^^“futting struggle, and, therefore, could not yield any satisfactory result ”; f 111 Vice-Consul at Bushire, Mr. Chick, thinks it improbable that any profit has been made by the line on any single sailing ; the master of one of the vessels is also reported as stating that each voyage brought a dead loss of £1,000. The cargo landed by them is said to have been much less than that usually carried in British bottoms : . that landed at Bushire being only an average of 900 packages per vessel, whereas a British steamer brings, as a rule, some 5,000-9,000 packages, and the record cargo has exceeded 1 7,000 packages. The import trade into the Gulf is of more importance than e xp°rt trade, and it is the former which the German Line seems to have the most difficulty in securing. The position of the firm of Messrs. Wonckhaus is of* interest in connection with the fortunes of* the Hamburg-Amerika Line. Mr. Chick states that at the time of the opening of the Hamburg-Amerika service to the Gulf in August, ermaU ^ ns ^ u C° ns in Southern Persia consisted only of Heinicke and Co., of Shiraz, and Wbnckhaus and Co. It appears that the latter firm, in or about 1896 began business at Lingah; in 1899 they opened a branch at Bahrein, extending their operations subsequently to Bushire, Basra, and Mohammerah. Ihey have also, apparently, native agents at Bundar Abbas, Debai, and Shahrgir. In January, 1908, H.M. Chargd dAffairesat Teheran reported that Messrs. Wonckhaus had leased a piece of land on the river bank at Mohammerah for eight years. Knowledge of the requirements of the European market and careful organisation have helped the hrm to compete successfully against native shippers, and to secure practically the whole w * i i t ^~ traC ^ e - °-f a g en ts of the Ham burg-Amerika Line, Messrs. Wdnckhaus have, it is said, been able to some extent to make the steamers specially foster their own commercial interests. Ihe persistence of the steamship Company in spite of the unprofitable nature of the enterprise, viewed in connection with the persistence during the earlier years of the activity in the Gulf (when their business is said to have been small out of all proportion to their expenses) of Messrs. Wonckhaus, has led to the belief that both undertakings are subsidised, and form part of an organized scheme for creating German trade interests, which may in due course be converted into political interests, in the I ersian Gulf. As bearing upon this point, it may be noted that the Hamburg-Amerika Line are reported to be prepared to meet losses of 3,000,000 marks over a period of three \ears m this enterprise, and that H.M. Consul at Basra, writing in April, 1907, quotes Mr. Wdnckhaus as saying that The Germans have come to Basra to stay, whether they win or lose.” It is believed that recently Herr Ballin told Mr. Strick (of the Anglo-Algerian Steamship Company, Limited) that the British Combine must be aware that the Hamburg-Amerika Line had made considerable losses in their attempts to engage in the Persian Gulf trade, but he knew that his competition had made it practically impossible for the British lines to do more than pay their way, if as much. (b) British Shipping in the Gulf. Originally, the British lines giving a direct service to the Gulf were three in number, viz. :— The Anglo-Algerian Steamship Company, Limited (Messrs. Strick and Company, Limited). The Bucknall Steamship Lines, Limited. The West Hartlepool Steam Navigation Company, Limited.243 Ihe Hamburg-Amerika Line and British Shipping in the Gulf. In December, 1907, H.M. Charge d Affaires at Teheran reported the opening of a serviceMessrs. Andrew Weir and Co., who contemplate making six voyages a year no [ e appended (Annex b) showing, so far as it has been possible to ascertain, t e financial position and standing of the second and third of these companies, as well as some information with regard to the Hamburg-Amerika Line. The Weir Company, !S a pnvate one, and these particulars have not been obtained in this case, nor in the case of the Anglo-Algerian Steamship Company. The Anglo-Algerian Steamship Company is run by Messrs. Strick and Company, Limited, and its total fleet consists, according to Lloyd’s Register, of 11 steamers with a total tonnage of 23,663 tons. Ihe Bucknall Lines are said to have a total fleet of 24 vessels, with a total net tonnage of 54,892 tons. The West Hartlepool Steam Navigation Company a total fleet of 20 vessels; total net tonnage 38,367 tons. Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co. own, according to Lloyd’s Register, six lines with a total fleet of 38 vessels and a total net tonnage of 83,135 tons. Far the largest of their lines is the Bank Line, consisting of 29 vessels and having a net tonnage of 61,711 tons. The first three lines work together as a Combine or Shipping Conference in their Persian Gulf trade. According to the Bushire Consul-General, the original arrange ment between the lines was that there should be two sailings of the Anglo-Algerian and Bucknall Lines combined for each sailing of the West Hartlepool Company. The British Indian Steam Navigation Company, Limited, send two vessels a week from Bombay to the Persian Gulf, one a fast one and the other slower. The Bombay and Persian Steam Navigation Company, Limited, are said to run between India and the Gulf according to cargo offering. Steamers from Bombay are stated to call at all the Gulf ports, both out and home. The mails for the Gulf from London are carried^ to Bombay by the P. and O. Company, and then to the Gull’ by the British India Company. A route for mails to Bagdad is vid Constantinople to Damascus, and over the Syrian desert. There are three British steamers, owned by Messrs. Lynch and Co., on the Euphrates, and on the ligris between the Persian Gulf and Bagdad under a con cession from the Turkish Government, and six steamers are run there by the Turkish Government themselves. The value of the trade passing between Bagdad and Basra is estimated at about £2,872,000 a year, and when the Bagdad railway is completed it will probably reach a much higher figure. On the lower Karun river there are two steamers running from Mohammerah to Ahwaz, one belonging to Messrs. Lynch and the other to a Persian. Between the upper and lower river there is a waterfall at Ahwaz. Goods destined for the upper river must pass over a light tramway, a concession in the hands of the Persian who has the steamer on the lower river. Merchandise destined for Ispahan by the Bakhtiari road (a distance of 270 miles) are discharged at Ahwaz. At present it is understood that it is practically only local traffic that takes place on the upper river. The through traffic which the upper river service was intended to create to Hamadan on the Luristan road is being killed at present by the disturbed state of the province of Luristan. Messrs. Lynch keep a steamer on the upper Karun at a loss in the hope that when the country quiets down a remunerative through traffic may be established to Hamadan and Ispahan by the Laristan and Bakhtiari roads respectively. (c) Russian Shipping in the Persian Gulf. A direct service from Odessa is given by the Russian Steam Navigation and Trading Company, which is said to be heavily subsidised by the Russian Government. A report from the Vice-Consul at Bushire in 1906 spoke of this Company as being likely to gain a large share of the trade of the Persian Gulf, especially in cotton piece goods and prints. The Consul-General at Bushire, however, in 1907 spoke of the share which the Russian line had obtained of the trade as meagre. Apparently they only give four sailings a year, and their cargoes are chiefly petroleum and sugar, [376] 3 R'2U Appendix 8.—Section (Bj. (d) The Competition between the I British and German Lines .— Defects in the British Service. Up to the advent of the Hamburg-Amerika Line, says the Bushire Consul General, the British direct lines had had the bulk of the carrying trade. Their only serious rivals were the Russian line already mentioned, and the practical monopoly which they enjoved appears to have had a prejudicial effect on the character of their service. A report from the Vice-Consul at Bushire, written apparently before the intentions of the Hamburg-Ainerika Company were known, speaks of the British Combine as not paying sufficient attention to the wishes and complaints of the local traders, and prophesies that if a new line, whether Russian, German, or British, comes into the trade, it will receive strong support, because of the dissatisfaction of the trading community with the present lines. Several reports which have been received from Bushire and elsewhere, suggest that the service supplied by the Hamburg-Amerika Line was, at any rate in the initial stages of the competition, much superior to that of the British lines, especially in the matter of regular sailings. The Consul at Basra stated, in April, 1907, that leading English merchants had informed him that the German line had done much better than they expected them to do ; and according to Sir W. Ward, the British Consul-General at Hamburg, the Hamburg-Amerika Line, by reason of the fact that they have trans-Atlantic services, will be likely to compete strongly for the large Mesopotamia trade to the United States, which consists chiefly of dates and wool. It is said that British steamers will not always stop at Mohammerah, causing in consequence great inconvenience to the Karun traders, whereas the German steamers will always stop if required. It is alleged that a British steamer will sometimes book space for cargo to be taken on board at Mohammerah ; then fill up that space at Basra, and sail straight down the river without touching at Mohammerah, thus leaving the exporters in that town in the lurch. Such policy appears very short sighted in view of the fact that the export trade of Mohammerah has risen between 1895 and 1906 from £43,000 to £115,000, an increase of nearly 170 per cent. Mr. Chick further points out that the British steamers give rise to frequent complaints owing to their sacrifice of the interests of Bushire to those of Basra. It may he noted that on specimen cards obtained from the Bucknall, Anglo-Algerian, and West Hartlepool Companies the steamer is in each case said to be at liberty to touch at any port or ports. Bushire is mentioned as a port of call on all three cards ; Mohammerah on none. It is also understood that the British steamers rarely touch at Bahrein. The sailings of the steamers of the British Combine also appear to have been very irregular, especially those of the Anglo—Algerian Line. In his report, dated 10th February, 1907, the Bushire Consul-General stated that at times three ver 5 sels of the Combine have been lying off the port within a few days of one another, while at other times there have been intervals of from six to eight weeks between their arrivals. The Board of Trade consequently communicated with the British companies, suggesting that they would do well to institute sailings at regular intervals, timing them, so far as practicable, just to precede the German monthly steamers. In reply, Messrs. Strick and Co. stated that they had already arranged for fortnightly sailings for the future ; Messrs. Bucknall said that they were collecting data, and hoped to write fully at a later date ; while the West Hartlepool Company stated that they were already doing their best in face of what they believed to be subsidised competition. In this connection Mr. Chick states that exporters at Bushire, for example, who wish to make September, October, or November shipments, can never count on an English vessel being available. The busiest time of the year is said to be from September to December, the date harvest lasting from September to November ; this is also the time that the caravan routes open. The British companies do not apparently print cards showing approximately the dates of the return of their vessels from Basra; but this is done by the Hamburg- Amerika Company; who also advertise freely by means of maps of Persia, calendars showing the corresponding dates of the Roman and Persian months, and the like. It was suggested by the Consul-General at Bushire, in December, 1907, that the British companies would do well to study these methods, and the suggestion was conveyed to Messrs. Strick and Co., Messrs. Bucknall Bros., and the West Hartlepool Company, at the time.245 The Hamburg—Amerika Line and British Shipping in the Gulf. It would appear^ that some remedy for the present condition of affairs lies in the a op ion, by the British Steamship companies, of a regular and convenient service in irect competition with the Hamburg-Amerika service, reliable and suitably advertised. n iT°V ( a S ° seem hhat, at certain times at least, more steamers might be run to the present. it seems desirable that calls should be made by the steamers, 1 P—, at Port Soudan; and it has been suggested that the Soudan Government s ou je approached with a view to arranging for some of their trade (dates and cotton) to e carried by these lines. I hey might also be asked whether additional steamer communication would be advantageous to the trade of the Soudan. (e) Freights. As regards freights, it appears that the rates charged by the Hamburg -Amerika ~! ne JP*® on whole somewhat less than those charged by the British combine ; and Mr. Chick states that the German line shows a distinct disposition to cut rates still ner. As to Bushire, a report from the Political Resident, dated December, 1906, stated that tne homeward rates of the British direct lines were then lower than those of the Hamburg—Amerika Line, except to Hamburg, to which poit a uniform rate was said to have been agreed upon. In his Consular Report for Bushne for the year March 21st, 1906, to March 21st, 1907, Mr. Chick states that the competition in August, 1906, caused the British lines gradually to lower their rates to the United Kingdom from the £1 10s. of 1905, to XI 5s. per ton, and later to XI per ton of 15 to 18 cwts. or 40 cub. ft. Freights to Hamburg by the British companies were also reduced, freight by British lines to New York by transhipment he gives as XI 17s. for carpets and XI L4s. for general cargo. . According to a report from the Basra Consul, dated 8th August, 1907, the British lines have had to lower their rates from the Continent to meet the rate offered by the Hamhurg-Amerika Line. They have, however, maintained their rates from the United Kingdom. I he rate from the Continent is 20s., but from the United Kingdom by the British lines 27s. 6d. to 35s. It is stated that the Hamburg-Amerika are offering to carry from the United Kingdom, but not direct, at 20s. Herr Ballin is reported to have told Mr. Strick that Manchester merchants had expressed their desire that the Hamburg—Amerika Line should call at Liverpool. (2.)—The Trade of the Persian Gulf. Tables are appended (Annex a) showing various statistics of the trade and shipping of the Gulf. The following statement shows the sea-borne trade of the Persian Gulf in 1906 :— Sea-borne Trade of the Persian Gulf, 1906. Direct Trade. Imports at Persian Gulf Ports from— £ United Kingdom ..

Note.— The Indian figures include a considerable quantity of British and Continental goods transhipped at Indian ports. The proportion of these goods coming from particular countries cannot be stated.246 Appendix 8. It will be seen that the total sea-borne trade of the Gulf in 1906 amounted to over £8,000,000, 79 per cent, of which was British and Indian. Both import and export trade appear to have grown fairly steadily since 1895, the rate of increase being rather greater as regards exports. Compared with 1895, the share of the United Kingdom alone in the whole sea-borne trade of the Gulf has fallen from over 34 per cent, to 28 per cent, in 1906 ; Germany’s share, though comparatively negligible, has increased from about 2 per cent, in 1895 to 4j per cent, in 1906. It is to be noted that the figures for India include a considerable quantity of British and continental goods transhipped for the Gulf at Indian ports. Detailed particulars as to the movement of shipping in the Persian Gulf as a whole is given in the statement on p. 26. In 1906 steam vessels comprised 93 per cent, of the tonnage engaged in this trade, most of them being under the British flag. The total entrances of shipping at Persian Gulf ports in 1906 amounted to 1.964.000 tons. Of this British (and British Indian) amounted to 1,685,000 tons, or 85 per cent. The total clearances of shipping at Persian Gulf ports in 1906 amounted to 1.793.000 tons. Of this British (and British Indian) amounted to 1,536,000 tons, or 85 per cent. It will be seen that the total movement of shipping amounted in 1906 to nearly 4,000,000 tons, of which the British (and British Indian) strire was 85 per cent. The movement of shipping has considerably more than doubled since 1895, in which year the British share was about i^4 per cent. The German share has risen from about 0.8 per cent, in 1895 to about 10 per cent, in 1906. The principal commodities in demand in Persia are Manchester goods and sugar. The French sugar and most of the Belgian is at present carried in British vessels to the Gulf. A certain amount of Manchester goods which are sent to Germany to be printed go from Hamburg by the Hamburg-Amerika Line to the Persian Gulf. Of the total import trade from the United Kingdom to the Gulf ports in 1906, about 69 per cent, is due to cotton piece goods, and nearly 8 per cent, to woollens, yarns and twist, and cotton yarns. It would thus appear that there may be openings for British export trade in other commodities. Of the exports from the Gulf to this country in the same year, dates account for nearly 33 per cent., raw wool for about 21 per cent., and gums for about 14 per cent. Barley, opium, mohair and seeds (in order of importance) together account for nearly 10 per cent. The trade between India and the Gulf has risen by about 14 per cent, during the five years 1901-2 to 1905-6 ; but the comparison is not exact, as the Bahrein trade is not separately showm in the earlier years. A considerable proportion (it is stated not less than about 60 per cent.) of the exports of cotton goods shown in the Indian statistics really come from the United Kingdom by transhipment at Bombay. The Manchester goods going direct to the Gulf by British steamers and also those going via Bombay probably amount to about £1,250,000 in value. The trade of India with Persia has fallen considerably, while that with the Turkish ports and Arabia has risen, during the five years. The principal exports from the Gulf to India appear to be precious stones and pearls (unset), provisions (chiefly dates), and salt. Grain and pidse, raw wool, and horses may also be mentioned, Exports of Indian produce to the Gulf (apart from cotton manufactures) appear to consist chiefly of grain and pulse (chiefly rice), tea, jute bags, indigo, and spices. Cotton manufactures form the principal article of foreign produce exported from India to the Gulf, sugar being next in importance. With regard to the German trade with Persia, the principal imports from the latter country in 1906 w r ere dates, gums, cereals, almonds, and shells; the principal exports from Germany, silk piece goods and manufactures, and woollens, as well as, in a smaller degree, cottons, motor wagons and aniline dyes. Turning to the trade of the individual ports (the figures for which include coasting trade and local trade between the States, etc., bordering on the Gult), the most notable facts are the growth of Bahrein and Mohammerah and the decline of Lingah and (to a smaller extent) of Bundar Abbas in recent years. The total trade of Bahrein in 1895 was about half as great as that of Bushire, but in 1906 it had increased considerably. This was due to the prosperity in the pearl trade.

Mr. Chick, in his report on the trade of Bushire for the year 1906-7, says that that port shows signs of developing greater importance as the port of entry for Southern Persia. The increase of the trade of Bushire he gives as follows :— 1905. 1906-7. £ £ Imports 761.932 863,842 Exports 469,941 598,421 Total.. 1,231,873 1,462,263 showing a total increase on the trade of the port of £230,390. 70 per cent of the imports and 54 per cent of the exports are due to the United Kingdom and India. 157 British steamers as against 140 in 1905, cleared from the port ; a fact due to the increased export cargo available there. [376] 3 S248 Appendix 8. (3.)—Roads. I he importance of the ports must depend to a considerable extent upon the road facilities which exist for the movement of merchandise from trade centres in the interior, and vice versd. A means of developing trade in the interests of Great Britain, and generally of strengthening our commercial position in the Persian Gulf, would be the acquisition of the control of the several important roads leading inland from the ports in the Gulf. It may be pointed out that it might become a serious matter for British trade in the Gulf if the principal roads leading inland from the ports were held by the Germans through concessions. In such circumstances, preference in various ways would probably be given to the goods of German traders, and the increase of German influence in the districts through which the roads pass would undoubtedly lead to increased German trade to the disadvantage of British. Mr. Maclean, in a confidential report to the Board of Trade, in 1894, laid great stress on the pressing need for better roads with greater facilities for transport. He suggested that the British and Indian Governments should subsidise companies for repairing some of the most important trade routes to the Gulf, and that they should police them, and establish landing, clearing, forwarding, warehousing, and delivering businesses. Colonel Newcome expressed the opinion that communications are the crux of commerce in Persia. Mr. Chick has suggested that the attention of His Majesty’s Government might be directed profitably to the promotion by British capital of improvement of transport in South Persia. He has also stated that “ the existence of a transport company, whether involving or not a concession, would imply important commercial influence.” Three very important routes are those leading from Bundar Abbas ; from Bushire ; and from Mohammerah. The road from Bundar Abbas to Kerman takes also the traffic from Yezd and parts of Khorassan, which cannot be tapped by any other route. The value of the traffic which passes over this road may be roughly estimated at £500,000. In his report in 1904 to the Board of Trade, Mr. Maclean suggested that the British and Indian Governments should subsidise a company for repairing this road which is in a fair state of preservation. Colonel Newcome suggested that the Indian Government should apply at once for a concession to construct a road for wheeled traffic from Bundar Abbas to Kerman, vid Minab, Rigan, and Bam; this, he thinks, would provide an enormous development of export trade, and consequently of import as well. As regards the road leading from Bushire, Shiraz, Ispahan, and Teheran, it has also been suggested by Mr. Maclean that the British and Indian Governments should subsidise a company for repairing and looking after this road. The value of the merchandise passing on the road at Bushire may be roughly put at about £1,324,000 a vear. Mr. Maclean states that nearly £1,000,000 value of merchandise (chiefly British) is shot on to the open beach at the caravan terminus of the Bushire-Shiraz road at Shief, where there is neither shelter nor water. Again, the Karun route of which Mohammerah is the port, which goes to Shuster and Sultanabad, is of much importance. Messrs. Lynch have a concession from the Persian Government for the making of this road from Ahwaz vid Sultanabad, Kum to Tehran. This concession is for 60 years, of which 12 years have passed. The portion of the road between Sultanabad and Tehran has already been made by Messrs. Lynch. The road when completed will probably pass through Burujird and Shuster, to Ahwaz. In view of the approach of the Baghdad Railway, it has been suggested that it might be advantageous to have this route between Tehran and the Gulf at Mohammerah, as an alternative to the Tehran, Hamadan, Kermanshah, Khanykin and Baghdad route. Accordingly, it may be desirable to secure a lease of as much land as possible at Mohammerah, in order to prevent the Germans obtaining a footing there. Messrs. Wbnckhaus have already leased from January, 1908, for eight years, a piece of land on the river bank at Mohammerah. Ispahan is reached from Ahwaz by the Bakhtiari road. This road was made by Messrs. Lynch for the Persian Khans, and it is understood that Messrs. Lynch have a concession for this road for about 20 years. Merchandise of the value of about £300,000 a year passes at Mohammerah. Messrs. Lynch also hold a concession for the road from Kum to Ispahan, and it seems to be desirable to obtain a concession for the read from Ispahan to Yezd, and on to Bundar Abbas. Further, having regard to the important position of the town of Bagdad, it is clear that the road from there towards Khanykin will be a very important one in the future. It would probably be of considerable advantage if part of this was in the hands of the British, or better still if a short line of railway could be made which249 Section (B).—(3.) Roads. peihaps might be linked up in the future to a Russian line running from the north. Ovei £1,000,000 of merchandise now passes on the route between Bagdad and Kerman, ah. Probably about half of the existing imports into Bagdad are destined for Persia vid Kermanshah. (4-) fHE Mother-of-Pearl and Oyster Shell Trade. According to information supplied by the agent of Messrs. Lynch Brothers at Basra, m Joly, 1907, this business is now practically monopolised by the German firm of Wbnckhaus and Company, except at B ahrein, where they are subject to the competition of Messrs. Gray, Paul, and Company. The staff of the firm of Wbnckhaus is^ said to consist at present of four Germans at Basra, two at Bushire. two at Lmgah, and one at Bahrein, besides native agents at Bandar Abbas, Debai, and Shargir. All these agencies (except that at Basra, which has nothing to do with the shell business) are said to be the result of careful trading in shells. During the last ten years the value of the moiher-of-pearl shell trade in the Persian Gulf in a normal year may be put at from £20,000 to £25,000. In a year of exceptional demand it has been as much as £30,000, although, owing to the fall in prices during the last tew years the value of the whole trade has sometimes been lower. . These figures represent an average yearly quantity of 2,500 tons of shells. The fieight on this would be worth about £2,500. Commissions and profits would probably amount to a further £2,500. This would put the value of the Persian Gult'sfiell trade, valued in Europe, at from £25,000 to £30,000 annually. It is evident from the relative figures of imports of* shells into the United Kingdom and Hamburg that 10 years ago the Germans had practically no direct share in this trade, but that since 1902 their share has been growing. In this latter period the fact of their activity in this trade is well known, and the figures given below, though somewhat incomplete, go to show that at the present time the Germans probably control the bulk of the trade. Value of the Shell Trade, 1897-1902-1906. Year. Exports from the Persian Gulf. Imports into the United Kingdom. Imports into Hamburg. £ £ £ 1897 55,200 44,000 1,400 1902 21,700 17,600 1,300 1906 18,000 3,200 17,200 Mr. George Lloyd, in a Memorandum forwarded from H.M. Embassy at Constan tinople in September, 1907, after his commercial mission to Mesopotamia for the Board of Trade, points out that the absorption of the mother-of-pearl industry of the Persian Gulf by Germany involves a danger which is not common to other trades in the Gulf, owing to the constant opportunities afforded for getting into touch with Sheikhs and Trucial Chiefs who, possessed of British protection and pledged to abstain from political relations with other Powers, would not be allowed to have such intercourse in any other way. This may lead, if allowed to continue, to political interference by Germany in a region where she has as yet no political interests of any kind. Mr. Lloyd suggests that a policy of “ no facilities” to German traders not provided, say, with introductions from H.M. Resident might be enjoined (informally and without putting anything on paper) upon the Sheikhs; the trade would thus gradually transfer itself to a British firm ready to take it up. Growing out of this obstructive scheme, it is suggested that a plan should be formulated to insure the proper, economical, and profitable working of the pearl-shell business by some firm of good standing and experience in the Gulf. According to the information given in the letter from Messrs. Lynch’s agent at Basra, mentioned above, the chief reasons which enable Germans to compete successfully in the trade are :— (a) That Hamburg has become a better market for the shells than London. (b) That the porterage and storage dues, etc., at Hamburg are some 10 per cent. cheaper than at the Port of London. (c) That the Hamburg-Amerika steamers quote cheaper rates of freight than the British steamers.250 Appendix 8. Mr. Lloyd suggests that no attempt should be made, if statements (a) and (b) be true, to divert the trade from Hamburg to London, but that the British lines should be urged to engage in direct competition with the German line with a view to capturing the shell trade by under-quoting the Hamburg-Amerika, and making Hamburg a port of call. This suggestion was conveyed by the Board of Trade at the instance of the Foreign Office to the three lines of the British Combine in January, 1908. A reply was received from the West Hartlepool Company stating that even at the present rates their Persian Gulf Line was very unremunerative, that they could not accordingly lower their rates, that the Hamburg-Arnerika Line received Government support, and that the porterage and storage duties in London were too high. (5.)—The Lighter Service at Bushire. The Lighterage Service in the Gulf is said by members of the Combine, by Sir James Mackay, by Mr. Chick, Mr. Maclean, and Mr. George Lloyd, to be very inefficient. In his Consular Report on the Trade of Bushire for the year 1906-7, Mr. Chick refers to the difficulties attending the landing of merchandise, due to the poor wharf and harbour accommodation and the inefficiency of the lighterage service, lack of lighters, refusal of lightermen to work, and their dilatoriness in unloading. The Customs administration, it is said, framed certain proposals, including the separation of the operations of (a) landing merchandise, and (6) passing it through the Customs and delivering it to the consignees, making the Shipping Companies responsible for the former and the Customs for the latter. Mr. Chick thinks it doubtful, in view of the high scale of charges proposed for the manipulation of cargo inside, whether the proposals will ultimately prove acceptable. In his confidential Report of November, 1907, Mr. Chick says that this is a question which demands Government attention, and in connection with which the action of the British Companies is urgently needed. Under the present system a native Persian or Armenian has contracted with the principal merchants to effect the landing of merchandise at fixed rates, the contractor binding himself to hire a certain number of lighters for the purpose. The working of the system has lately become most unsatisfactory, and more than once broken down, to the great detriment of trade ; the chief causes of failure being the inability of the contractor to provide the requisite number of lighters, and the growing insolence and independence of the boatmen who work and own the lighters—a spirit which is due to the attitude of the Governors, who no longer farm the Customs, and thus have no interest in suppressing any friction in the conduct of trade. Mr. Chick states that the German agents have openly spoken of instituting a lighter service of their own, a step which might lead to most disastrous consequences for the British companies, and it is urged that the companies should jointly institute such a service and forestall the Germans. The initial outlay would apparently be little more than £1,000 to £2,000 in the purchase of lighters, and, if possible, a small tug. It is said that there are no indications that the outlay would not be amply covered by receipts, on the contrary, it appears that there is considerable profit to be made out of such an undertaking. It may be noted in this connection that Mr. Maclean remarks upon the expensive, and perfunctory manner in which the landing, shipping, clearing, and delivering of merchandise is effected at Bushire, and observes that this could be more cheaply and efficiently carried out by an organised company possessing a few barges and a tug. (6.)—Banks. (a) The proposed German Bank at Bagdad. On the 20th May, 1907, H.M. Consul-General at Bagdad stated that it was a matter of common knowledge that the Deutsche Orient Bank had every intention of opening a branch in that city. A new bank is required, as banking facilities are not equal to the demand for them, the Imperial Ottoman Bank being at present the only one there. In consequence of this the Board of Trade at the instance of the Foreign251 Section ^B).—(6.) Banks. Office^ caused various directors and managers of Indian and Eastern banks to be interviewed, but none were inclined to take the matter up except the National Bank of India, who thought that they might do so if H.M. Government would contribute the sum of £2,000 a year. As regards the Imperial Bank of Persia, it is understood that, though the bank formerly had branches at Bagdad and Basra, it had withdrawn in 1903, owing to the hostility of the Imperial Ottoman Bank, with which there was now an understanding providing that the banks should represent each other in Persia and Turkey, the Persian Bank retiring from Bagdad and Basra, and the Ottoman not opening a branch in Persia. It is obvious that it would be to the disadvantage of British trade in and around Bagdad if British traders had to bank with a foreign bank, which would thus know their position, their course of business, their operations, etc., and be able to convey it to their foreign rivals. (b) The German Bank in Persia. In July,^ 1907, a concession was granted to the Deutsche Orient Bank to open a bank in Persia,^ with a capital of at least £200,000 ; the central office to be at Teheran, with branches in other towns in Persia. The bank is to be opened within three years from the date of the signature of the agreement. (c) The Imperial Bank of Persia at Bushire. Mr. Chick states that there is probably no town in Persia where a German bank could so easily obtain a sure footing as at Bushire. This is due to the unsatisfactory working of the local branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia. The fault is alleged to lie primarily with the management in London, who are said to be unacquainted with the requirements of modern commercial competition in Persia. It is suggested that the Bushire branch should be freed from the trammels of the Shiraz one, to which it is at present subordinate, and allowed to extend its operations to Bahrein. There were several spells during 1907 when the bank held up business in Bushire, where a great scarcity of money already prevailed, by the stoppage of business with Shiraz. Besides showing a lack of reciprocity, the bank is said to persist in its policy of avoiding discounting local promissory notes. This is said to be no longer necessary, as the bank has had long enough experience to be able to discriminate, and so to guard against fraud. Merchants of repute, British and native, complain of a lack of facilities in other branches of business. The Bushire Bank relies almost solely on exchange, and its rates are said to be excessive, and that with a competitor in the field it could not live on exchange alone. Mr. Chick states that the Deutsche Orient Bank has been quick in scattering its literature among the British firms in Bushire, and that Mr. Wonckhaus has chafed at the exorbitant demands and irregularity of the English Bank. It is urged by Mr. Chick that much could be done to render foreign competition impracticable, if the Imperial Bank would recognise the need for reform now while there is still time. 6 [37C] «) t&gt; T252 Appendix 8. - Section (C).

The attached statements have been compiled from the Keports of His Majesty’s Consular Officers stationed in the Persian Gulf region, supplemented by extracts from the British, Indian, and the Principal Foreign Trade Returns. As, however, the Consular Returns (in the absence of well organised statistical departments in the countries dealt with) unavoidably give the country from which imported or to which exported, irrespective of the actual origin or destination of the goods, and, further, quantities of Continental goods destined for the Gulf are transhipped at Bombay and Karachi, it follows that the United Kingdom and Indian figures are somewhat overstated, and the figures for Continental countries are correspondingly tmeferstated. It is impossible to estimate the amount of this error. Trade of the Persian Gulf. 1. IMPORTS. Country whence Imported. 1,000/. 1895. 1900. 1905. 1906.

Stride and Company, Limited, are not mentioned in the Stock Exchange Official Intelligence, and no information has been obtained with regard to their financial position. Financial Position of the Hamburg-Amerika Line. The Ordinary Share capital of this Company amounts to £6,250,000 ; Preference loans, £2,250,000. The Company also propose to obtain additional preference loan capital to the extent of £1,000,000 during 1908. The last issue of ordinary shares was made at a premium. The total tonnage of their fleets amounts to nearly a million tons. In the Financial Supplement to “ The Times ” for the 6th March, 1908, it is stated that the Board of Directors of the Hamburg—Amerika Line have only been able to recommend a dividend of 6 per cent, for 1907, as compared with the 10 per cent, distributed the year before. The net profits of the line last year amounted to £1,260,000, as compared with £1,615,000 in 1906. The sum to be written off is £890,000, as compared with £1,090,000. By its agreement with the International Mercantile Marine Company, the Hamburg-Amerika Line is under an obligation to payAnnex (b).— Financial Position, &amp;c., of the British Companies. 261 to that Company a sum equivalent to the current dividend on £1,000,000, while the International Mercantile Marine Company guarantees a sum equivalent to 6 per cent, on the total capital. With the 1907 dividend of 6 per cent, these transactions cancel each other, whereas last year the Hamburg—Amerika had to pay a sum of £40,000. . The decline in net revenue is stated by the Hamburg-Amerika Line to be attributable chiefly to the decrease of traffic during the second half of the year. The decline during the second six months is said to be due to the financial crisis in the United States, and also to the various freight tariff disputes, which, however, have recently^ been settled by agreement with the other companies concerned, to the satisfaction of the Hamburg-A merika Line. The Persian-Arabic service is admitted to be still unremunerative. ANNEX (c). Germany’s Interests in the Persian Gulf. Ihe following extract from the Munich “ Neueste Nachrichten,” on the subject of a lecture delivered by Dr. Th. Fischer, Professor of Geography at Marburg University, was forwarded to the Foreign Office by His Majesty’s Consul at Munich. Dr. Ih. Fischer, Professor of Geography at the Marburg University, raises a protest against an article which appeared in the geographical magazine “ Petermann’s Mitteilungen,” published at Gotha, and in which it was asserted that Germany had no material interests at all near the Persian Gulf, that no Germans resided there, and that, on the contrary, the owner of the only German firm in those provinces was the Belgian Consul, Puttmann. The Professor, who knows all about the conditions prevailing at the Persian Gulf, delivers himself on the subject as follows :— “The German imports to Bagdad are much more important than it is generally assumed by those who have no exact knowledge of the commerce in those places. The German firm, Messrs. Berk, Puttmann and Co., founded in 1894, alone import German wares to the value of £100,000, and have a yearly turnover, including imports and exports, of about £400,000 ; the firm, together with that of Lynch, belong to the foremost trading concerns at Bagdad. German commercial travellers have repeatedly visited those provinces, amongst other representatives being those of some South German chemical works, and that of a Dusseldorf hardware firm. Germany’s commercial relations with the Persian Gulf were up till now dependent on British and French shipping firms calling at Bombay. In the autumn of last year the Hamburg-Amerika Line successfully established a direct service with ports on the Persian Gulf—Bussorah,* Mohammerah, Bushire, the islands in the Gulf, Lingah, and Bunder Abbas. At the end of April last the Bussorah* Agency informed the Bagdad firms that the next three steamers of the Hamburg-Amerika Line could ship no more cargo. Since the establishment of the new line to the Persian Gulf, the German firm, Robert Wdnckhaus and Co., formerly at Bushire, settled at Bussorah,* with branches in all the ports on the Persian Gulf at which the Hamburg- Amerika Line calls. Messrs. Berk, Putmann, and Co. occupy now at those places a staff of ten German clerks. In 1894 a German Consul honoraire was appointed at Bagdad in the person of Herr Richarz, well known by Orientalists for his great linguistic talents. In 1 905 a German Consulate was established at Mosul, and the German Consul at Bagdad is now one de carriere. Let us hope that before long a Consular Agency will be established at Bussorah,* and that the Bagdad Consul will soon be put on the same footing as the British and Llussian Consuls-General there. It follows from all this that indeed it cannot be maintained that Germany has no material interests at the Persian Gulf.” * Basra.262 Appendix 8.—Section (D).— Annex (d). ANNEX (d). Note on Encouragement given by the German Government to German Export Trade in the East and Elsewhere. For a number of years past the German Government has been engaged in the active encouragement of the German Export Trade, and the development of the Mercantile Marine. Apart from the payment of “drawbacks ” in a comparatively small number of cases, and the regulations as to the “ improvement trade”—both of which are simply devices for mitigating the effect of a protective tariff—the methods adopted for the promotion of the export trade and, both as a means and a result, the encourage ment of the mercantile marine, fall under the following heads :— (a) Skipping Subsidies .—The first shipping subsidy law, which came into force in April, 1885, provided for 15-year contracts for a line of steamers to Eastern Asia (with a subsidy of £85,000 a year), a line to Australia (£115,000), and a branch line connect ing Alexandria and Trieste (£20,000). The contracts were made with the North German Lloyd from July 3, 1885. In January, 1890, a subsidy of £45,000 a year was authorised to the German East African Line from Hamburg vid Rotterdam, Lisbon, Naples, Port Said and Suez to East African ports. In 1892 the North German Lloyd abandoned its right to the subsidy of £20,000 for the Alexandria-Trieste service, which was unprofitable, but in the following year a new contract was made for a line connecting some south European ports with the East Asia and Australia lines at Alexandria—the subsidy being, however, only £4,500. In order to promote German trade with China a law of April, 1898, gave an additional subsidy of £75,000 to the North German Lloyd for an improved fortnightly service, and the Australian contract was renewed. In 1901 the subsidy to the German East-Africa line was increased to £67,500. We obtain thus the following totals :— Item. Service. Subsidy. Company. 1 East Asia and China Service £ 160,000 I North (Tftrmnn 2 Australia Service .. 115,000 J Lloyd. 3 South European Ports, Alexandria Service 4,500 4 German East African Service 67,500 German East 347,000 Africa Line. These subsidies are defended as being postal subventions, but they are subventions out of all proportion to the services rendered in the carriage of mails ; and, in fact, in a Government Memorandum of 1890 it was stated that “the annual sums to be granted as postal subventions cannot be regarded merely as payment for services rendered,” but “ as value also paid for important interests of German export industry, the requirements of the navy, and colonial policy.” There are postal subventions of a more ordinary type, of about £65,000 to the Hamburg-American Line and the North German Lloyd for the carriage of the American mails, and some small amounts. It may be noted that the Hamburg-America Line asserts that beyond the above- mentioned postal subvention it receives no Government aid whatever, and that its recent establishment of a service to the Persian Gulf has been undertaken entirely without Government support. Whilst this is probably true, it is, of course, a well- known fact that the relations between the Hamburg-America Line and the German Government are very close, and that much of the action of the line has been undertaken with the active approval, if not at the instigation, of the Government. In its Report for 1906 the Company stated that the Persian Gulf service had been carried on at a loss so far, but that it was hoped that the outlay would in course of time be warranted by the beneficial results to German industrial and commercial interests arising from this service. (b) Preferential Railway Rates. — Goods for export are very commonly carried on the German State Railways at rates considerably lower than those charged for theEncouragement given by German Government to Export Trade. 263 same goods when intended for local delivery. There are numerous preferential rates for the export of goods to the neighbouring European countries, and also similar rates for the conveyance of goods from the places of production in the interior to the various German seaports for export by sea. Further, there are certain important through tariffs, i.e., giving through rates for practically all commodities from German inland towns, (a) from Hamburg to Levant Ports, (6) from Bremen to Levant Ports, (c) from Hamburg to certain ports in Turkey in Europe, and thence by the Oriental Railways to inland points, (&lt;i) from Hamburg to East African Ports. In each case the through rate applies only to goods carried by one particular steamship line. The ordinary railway rates for export (for exports generally) are decidedly lower than those charged for the conveyance of the same goods for local delivery, and there is no doubt that the railway share of the through rates specified above is smaller than the rates charged for the same goods for export to unspecified places. Obviously, if the ordinary rates for the carriage of goods represent “ normal ” and reasonable rates, then the preferential rates for exports, and still more the railway share of the through rates represent export subsidies. In the case of the through rates it is not easy to determine the relations of the shipping companies and the State railways; but they are very close; and the conclusion appears to he that a low rate being fixed the railways take much less than their proportionate share. It may be noted that in spite of the efforts to develop these lines of trade, and in spite of the fact that the German East Africa Line—one of those favoured by through rates—receives a subsidy of £67,500, two of the lines thus aided—the German East Africa and the Hamburg-Levant—paid no dividend in 1906, though the Levant traffic was said to- have been satisfactory. (c) Commercial Attaches. —These are attached to German Consulates-General at St. Petersburg, Constantinople, New York, Chicago, Valparaiso, Buenos Ayres, Rio de Janeiro, Sydney, Johannesburg, Calcutta, Shanghai, and Yokohama. The number is apparently to be increased, as the Imperial Budget for 1907 allowed for commercial attaches double the sum granted in previous years. The attaches from time to time return to Germany in order to visit Chambers of Commerce, which have a definite status and organised relation to the Government in Germany, and individual firms of exporters. (d) Support to Private Undertakings .—The German Government has always been ready to support private enterprise, especially in such a matter as the establishment and development of German banks in Eastern countries where political support is needful. The present proceedings in Persia afford an illustration of this kind of action. An illustration of a different kind of aid to private enterprise is the assistance given to the German School at Constantinople. (e) Political Influence Abroad. —This hardly comes within the scope of this Note, but the ways in which pressure has been brought especially on the Governments of Oriental States to secure contracts and concessions for German firms is well known.

LYNCH, M.P. ^ * THE short time at my disposal before attending the meeting of the Defence Committee renders this statement but an unfinished and incomplete expression of my views. The questions of the Baghdad Railway and of Persia are inextricably interwoven. Great Britain is far better without the Baghdad Railway. It raises questions which we are probably not in the frame of mind properly to solve at the present day. The following seem to me to be fundamental propositions : — (1.) It cannot be built without imposing a tremendous strain on Turkish finances unless it be accompanied b} r great schemes of irrigation, which ought properly to precede it. Nor is the railway in the least essential to those schemes, since they would be based upon the two great waterways, Euphrates and Tigris, whose courses it is a distinct Turkish, as well as a British, interest to render better navigable than they are at the present day. (2.) Owing to the torrid conditions during the summer months that prevail in Mesopotamia, the railway would not be of much advantage to India, especially in the leave season when rapid access to Europe is desired. As regards trade with the regions which the railway would cross, such trade is at present almost exclusively British and Indian trade, with the exception of sugar coming from Marseilles. This trade is conveyed by sea to the estuary of the Persian Gulf, whence it is transferred to river steamers, British and Turkish. The railway would bring with it an influx of goods from Central Europe to compete with British and Indian products. (3.) On the other hand, the railway woidd be of great strategical importance to Turkey. It would enable her to mass troops in any one of three important regions, namely, Northern Mesopotamia, to check a Russian advance ; the Egyptian frontier, to answer any naval threat by Great Britain at the Dardanelles; lastly, in Arabia, which it would enter on two sides, that of the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. For the Baghdad Railway is only one part of a single scheme of w T hich the Hejaz Railway is another part. A glance at the map will show the importance in connection with Egypt of the Hejaz Railway, with its projected branch to the Gulf of Akabah. The same glance will, I think, also show the futility of the arguments of those who think that the Syrian part of the railway could be easily cut by a naval Power. In this connection I would remark that this question has been carefully considered by German military experts in relation to the similar line from Salonika to Constantinople in European Turkey. In a reverse sense it would enable Turkey to concentrate her Asiatic troops in the direction of the capital. As regards European Powers, the railway would enable Russia, when she has established her connections with it through Persia, to send down troops into Mesopotamia. If German ambitions in relation to the East, as expressed by their publicists, could ever be realized, the railway would perform the same function in relation to Germany. Hitherto it has been a fixed principle of British foreign politics to keep railways, especially from Russia, out of these regions. Keeping these propositions clearly in mind, I would next offer the following observations:— I would begin by a question : Is Turkey in a position to enter into vast strategical plans of this nature ? 1 should at present answer this question in the negative. I think they would involve her in ruin, leaving the fruits of them to revert to any creditor Power that might instigate her in this direction. Then I would ask the Committee to consider carefully what would be the bearing upon British interests of a highly developed modern State occupying the territories of Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, and parts of Persia. I annex the opinion of Captain Mahan on this subject (Annex (A)). Captain Mahan seems to have contemplated this danger as arising from Russia; and from the American point of view, with their desire of keeping the Suez route open, he has shown himself not unfavourable to Germany. But he is careful in either case to point out the danger to us. One thing seems clear: whether Turkey or Germany or Russia enters into effective use of the strategical position offered by the Baghdad Railway, we shall beMemorandum by Mr. H. F. B. Lynch, M.P. 265 forced into close alliance with such Power, and shall scarcely have an alternative policy. But is the Baghdad Railway inevitable ? Germany wants it, the Germans are obstinate, therefore it will be built. Such is the argument. But Great Britain can still prevent it if she really so desires. If the railway is ever built by means of kilometric guarantees, this can only be done by our connivance. The Germans cannot procure the money except on the security mainly of two branches of Turkish revenue, over both of which we have a hold : (1) the ceded revenues, as to which I annex a statement marked (B); and (2) the customs receipts. The ceded revenues have been increased owing to our consent to the 3 per cent, increase in the customs for the object of financing reform in Macedonia. But Turkey sued in forma 'pauperis for this increase, and our consent is only of a temporary nature. We never contemplated that she would use the increase to set free funds to be employed on strategical purposes for the benefit of German financiers. Should we agree to a permanent increase in the Turkish customs—the greater proportion of which is levied on British and Indian trade 0 —it will be through such complaisance on our part that the Baghdad Railway will be built. That weapon, in whatever direction it may be turned, will have been forged by ourselves. If, on the other hand, Great Britain decides not to oppose the railway and the heavy drain upon Turkish resources which it will involve, I trust that, in addition to remembering that it is her trade which will have mainly paid the piper, she will bear in mind the following considerations :— 1. To keep a jealous eye upon Mesopotamia, and to permit no step which might involve establishment there of any other European Power. The line will enter Mesopotamia in the neighbourhood of Killis (a place I know well), where it will bifurcate towards Egypt on the one side and the Persian Gulf on the other. Great Britain should seek to control the Killis-Aleppo and the Killis-Persian Gulf sections, or she might be inclined to come to an arrangement with France as regards the Killis-Aleppo section. The section Killis-Persian Gulf should follow the course of the Euphrates to the vicinity of Baghdad, whence a branch line would run to Baghdad, and later, perhaps, to Mosul and Northern Mesopotamia. This would obviate the passing of the wild, scarcely inhabited desert, such as is contemplated by the German “ trace.” But even if this longer and more perilous German “ trace ” were to be adopted, and the line were to be taken via Mosul to the Gulf, the Germans would still be in control of more than half the Baghdad Railway from Haidar Pasha to the Gulf. This is not an unfair reward for their enterprise. In Mesopotamia the enterprise has been all on the side of Great Britain. We have surveyed the country—including both the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers—in the course of two costly Government expeditions, and it is we who have opened up all the existing communications and trade. Mesopotamia is of the highest importance to us. It lies directly on the land routes to the Gulf and India, If restored to its ancient prosperity by irrigation, it would afford a vast field for Indian immigration, which would at the same time be a real boon for Turkey. Potentially it is a country of enormous wealth, capable of affording markets to Butish manufacturers when they commence to feel the restriction of their trade with China, which will be the inevitable outcome of the cutting of the canal across the central American istlnnus, as well as of the development of industrial conditions in Japan. 2. To give Germany a pretty free hand in Asia Minor, which alone is sufficient to absorb her energies for quite a century. Asia Minor is a country separated from Mesopotamia by great mountain chains, and enjoying totally different climatic and general conditions. 3. But always to do our utmost to maintain the Turkish State in Asia, and to prevent it from becoming the prey of the great military empires of Europe. * * How heavily the increased customs duties weigh on our trade can be realized by considering the following- facts— The freight out to Basra from the United Kingdom on a ton of Manchester goods is about 30 shillings. The increased customs dutns (3 per cent.) on the same ton of goods (the average value of which is about 100/.) amount to 60 shillings.266 Appendix 9. What is happening now in Turkey presents a strong analogy to what has already occurred in Persia. Just as Russian predominance in Persia was immediately due to the course taken by the British Government of the day, which in 1902 refused Persia a loan on the excellent security of the customs of the Persian Gulf ports—a transaction which, incidentally, would have enabled the Chancellor of the Exchequer to obtain a nest egg for old age pensions, as he could have borrowed at 3 per cent, and obtained 6 per cent.—so German predominance in Turkey is at present being established by means of loans to the Turkish Government, mainly in connection with railways. Should this process be continued, the results will be likely to be the same in Turkey as those which both parties in England have joined in deploring in the case of Persia. As regards Persia, the only course now left to us is to strengthen our hold over the communications in the neutral sphere, and not to release our hold over the communi cations in the Russian sphere. If we were to sell our roads in the Russian sphere to Russia, the obstructions mentioned in Annex (C) would certainly be put into force by Russia against British goods arriving over a British road upon their transference to the Russian road authorities. I annex two statements in this connection, the first giving reasons why we cannot rely on the open door in the Russian sphere (Annex (C)); and the second containing an extract from Captain Mahan as to the strategical con sequences of a Russian absorption of Persia, taken in relation merely to the distribution of our fleet (Annex G))). Should the Baghdad Railway be built, I regard it as of great importance that we should control the line from Baghdad to the Persian frontier. This might help us to come to terms with Russia as to the free passage of our goods into Persia by the Khanikin trade route, which the line should follow. This line would pay without a kilometric guarantee. Again, in this connection, I would point out the supreme wisdom of doing our utmost to maintain and strengthen the Persian State. It is the existence of these buffer States which enables us to hold India with comparatively a handful of men. March 25, 1908. ANNEX (A). Extract from “The Problem of Asia,” by Captain A. T. Mahan, pp. 71-72. Under conditions of war, the continuance of Egypt in its present tenure, and the security of the shortest route to the East, both depend ultimately upon the permanent political bias of the region now called Turkey in Asia, and in a subsidiary degree upon that of Persia. That this is so will readily appear if we imagine that instead of the existing misrule, Turkey in Asia—Asia Minor, Syria, and Mesopotamia—formed a highly developed modern State, with an efficiently organized army and navy. Nothing can be said now of the power of France in the western half of the Mediterranean that would not be as true, and truer, of the control of such a State over much greater issues. In its presence, if hostile, Egypt would be insecure, as she was in the days of the Ottoman vigour and the strategic importance of Egypt’s position is a commonplace of the ages. This imagined State, touching the Black Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and the Levant, would control the issues from vast territories to the outer world. It does not now exist; but the creation of such a political entity, and its development on healthy lines, are as much one of the problems of Asia, and as important, as China itself. The latter is primarily and chiefly a region simply of production ; the other, while not barren in this aspect, would fulfil the far more vital role of controlling com munications. In superiority of interest to the world at large, therefore, it far excels. ANNEX (B). The Ceded Revenues. Previous to the year 1907, considerable sums were borrowed by the Turkish Government on the securit} 7 of the Ceded Revenues—the best security that Turkey has to offer, inasmuch as these revenues are collected and administered by a European Administration—in order to defray the large deficits on the Macedonian budget, caused by the expenditure involved in keeping in Macedonia an army of from 60,000267 Memorandum by Mr. H. F. B. Lynch, M.R to 80,000 men. In 1907 the Powers, including Great Britain, gave their consent to a 3 per cent, increase in the Customs duties, to be earmarked for Macedonia. This extia revenue lias relieved J urkey from the necessity of finding the money by borrowing 01 i secu . rity ^ e ^ ec ^ Revenues. The British Delegate on the Public Debt, which administers the Ceded Revenues, made a strong stand in favour of making the Ceded Revenues a collateral security for the deficit on the Macedonian budget; but he was overruled by his colleagues, who are most of them either Directors of the Baghdad Railway, or more or less intimately connected with its fortunes—a striking fact which is by no means in the interest of the bond-holders, and against which I am surprised that the British bond-holders have not protested. I am confidentially informed on authority that it is believed that there is a secret understanding between Turkey and Germany, by which the share of the surplus of the revenues ceded to the Public Debt Administration accruing to the Ottoman Government has been earmarked for the Baghdad Railway, jhe following financial statements show the prospects of there being a surplus of the Ceded Revenues available for the Turkish Government at no very distant period.

But this low figure has been taken because certain items of interest payable on temporary loans have not been included on the other side of the account. Since the Ceded Revenues have now been freed for a period of years from the necessity of making provision for the Macedonian Budget, it is only reasonable to suppose that in 1909-10 the surplus would be available as security for loans in connec tion with the Baghdad Railway. It is estimated that the surplus for the year 1910-11 will be some £ T. 300,000, which will be quite sufficient for a loan of from 6,000,000/. to 7,000,000/. It is not, however, considered likely that the promoters of the Baghdad Railway will wait until that date before placing their loan on the money market. The course that will probably be adopted is to wait merely for the first favourable turn of the money market in Europe, when they will pay off the temporary charges of which the debit balance of the Ceded Revenues at present consists. It is very noteworthy in this connection that the last temporary advance, made on the 24th January, 1908, for a sum of £ T. 200,000 (which advance is included in the debit balance carried forward in the above statement for 1908-9), was made by the Baghdad Railway group. This group have evidently calcidated that this advance will about equal the estimated debit balance on the temporary charges to be carried forward in March 1909. In other words, the group expect that in March 1909 they will be practically the only important creditor on the Ceded Revenues Account. [376] 3 Z2CS Appendix 9. On the other hand, it seems evident that the Turkish Government would scarcely be in a position to offer the balance of the Ceded Revenues as security for a Baghdad Railway loan so long as they are in uncertainty about the 3 per cent, increase in the customs duties. At present the British Government have carefully guarded them selves in two ways. First, they have laid it down that reforms in Macedonia must be genuine reforms, and that certain improvements in the custom-houses and customs administration must take place. They have reseived to themselves the right to with draw their consent at any time should these conditions not be fulfilled. Secondly, they have limited their consent to a period of seven years. If, therefore, either at the end of seven years, or at any time during that period, the British Government were to withhold their consent to the continuance of the 3 per cent., the Turkish Government would not know where to go for money to defray the expenses of their army in Macedonia except to the Ceded Revenues. It would appear therefore that tbe British Govern ment are still masters of the situation as regards the financial aspects of the Baghdad Railway question. ANNEX (C). Reasons why the Open-Door Policy in Persia is a Fallacy as between Great Britain and Russia. Even though equality of treatment for the goods of all nations be secured by Treaty, it would be easy for Russia, while observing the letter of this stipulation, to get round it in such a way as to give advantages to Russian trade which could not be given by the British Government to British trade, unless we were to depart from all the principles of our commercial policy. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that Russia, under the Anglo-Russian Convention, were to build railways in hex sphere—and even roads with a monopoly of transport over them would suffice—say to Isfahan on the one side and to Kasr-i-Shirin, through Hamad an and Kermanshah, on the other. Suppose, further, that Great Britain were to answer this move by opening railways to Isfahan from the Gulf, and to Kasr-i-Shirin by the valley of the Tigris. We need only follow out the latter case to see how the thing would work. It costs at least as much in actual freight to place Moscow and Lodz goods on the Russian frontier at Julfa as it costs to place Manchester or Bradford goods at Basra. Further, it would cost as much, if not more, in freight to'' convey these Russian goods from the frontier by railway to Kermanshah as it would cost to convey British goods from Basra by river or by rail way to Kermanshah. Therefore, if equality of treatment were really meted out to both Russian and British goods, British goods would probably enjoy the same predominance in the markets of Kemianshah as they do at present, after the railway system has been completed by both Powers. But in practice this would not work out in this way. The moment that Russia had the railway to Kasr-i-Shirin in her possession, all she would have to do would be to extend the same zone system that is at present in operation in Russia to the Persiau Railway. This zone system consists in diminishing the mileage rate of freight according as the distance becomes greater ; or, in other words, it consists in making the rate proportionately less for long distances than it is for short ones. This rate would be so adapted as to secure that the freight on Russian goods to Kermanshah should be less in the aggregate than the freight on the corresponding British goods. It is difficult to see how Great Britain could under such circumstances substantiate a protest that her goods had not received equality of treatment in Persia. Moreover, suppose that the British Government were to depart from the principles of our commercial policy and apply the Russian zone system to our goods, it would certainly be found in practice that obstructions would be placed in the way of British goods, such as insufficiency of rolling-stock, delays arising from excessive formalities in the examination of goods which might not be delivered to the railway authorities in a perfectly sound condition, &amp;c. It might, however, be possible to overcome these obstacles in cases were lines controlled by Great Britain joined lines controlled by Russia. If it be objected that as regards the Russian zone system there is at present no reason why instead of drawbacks the Russian Government should not give subsidies to Russian goods sold in Kermanshah, the answer to such objection is that in practice this is difficult. The Russian merchant would have to certify to some Russian Consul that he had sold so many goods of such and such description and quality; and the Russian Consul would have to verify his statements. In practice this could not wellMemorandum by Mr. H. F. B. Lynch, M.P. 269 be earned out. But when Russian railway authorities actually handled the mods be easil '^it 116 ^ W ° Uld be Very dlfferent . as the necessary drawbacks in rates could y given. ANNEX (D).

They will be nnrthl e&lt; rl ^ bl ’ iel T^m? ° f ! he advantages and disadvantages of each to the two parties chmfly concerned.

If this be obtained, Rnm tV S UP0U the dank ] ndia ' sbe controls one issue of any possible railroad from the Mediterranean through the valley of Mesopotamia, and absolutely interposes tuecn it and its prolongation to India. Besides this, although the Persian Gulf has no such absolute control of _ the route to the East, via Suez, as is conferred by predominance m the Levant, it nevertheless does afford a flanking position, and entails t a w P U P mena p Ce m War - In addition, it may be remarked that the maintenance t ere b} Russia of a navy sufficient to be a serious consideration to the fleets of Great Britain, and to those who would be her natural allies upon the sea in ease of complica- \ i Farther East would involve an exhausting effort and a naval abandonment o the Black Sea, or of the China Sea, or of both. Naval divisions distributed among e three could not possibly give mutual support. Such a situation, contrasted with the secure, though long’, access to the China Sea coast, through territory either her own or under facile control, a nd with a fleet concentrated there, on the spot of greatest interest to the world, presents drawbacks so obvious that there is no motive in the good o Russia lor the other States to consent to an arrangement which carries with it hazard to them On the other hand, it appears unreasonable, and needlessly provocative of bad feeling, to object to her reaching the sea on the seaboard of China. ANNEX (E). Copy of Letter to Sir E. Grey from Mr. H. F. B. Lynch, M.P. De ar Grey, 33, Pont street, S. W., March 27, 1908. U ltb reference to the meeting which we both of us attended last Wednesday at the Deience Committee, I would venture to invite your attention to the Confidential Memorandum which I handed in at the same time. That Memorandum was got out in the intervals of a Committee at the House of Commons on the subject of rival o-as Bills of which the fumes were of a somewhat stupifying nature, so I hope you wall make allowances if it should be wanting in lucidity. _ It seems to me that in the question of the Baghdad Railway we are in danger of being carried away by too indulgent a consideration for the interests of other Powers who are newcomers in these regions of Asia. This tendency, which has, of course its good side, may carry us to lengths which we may have reason bitterly to regret in the future. There are two^ points which I think it is important to emphasize in connection with my cross-examination at the Defence Committee :— First, Sir W. Nicholson, who is a recognized authority on such matters, pointed to the Indus as illustrating the incompatibility of extensive works of irrigation and the keeping of the channel of a river in a navigable condition. But other 5 experts have come to a contrary conclusion ; and, not very long ago, I threshed out this very question with a Dutch engineer, Mr. Van Roggen, who, with the help of his own L 376 J 4270 Appendix 9. surveys, showed me that the irrigation of the Karun district would not involve any diminution, but rather an increase in the waters of the Ivarun for navigation purposes during the low season. He provided for a reservoir of water for the purposes of irrigation during the low season, which reservoir was to he filled by the river during the high season. If this be feasible in the case of the Karim, it should also be feasible in the case of the Euphrates and Tigris. To deprive Mesopotamia of two such magnificent waterways for navigation as the Euphrates and I igris undoubtedly aie would, it seems to me, be tantamount to robbing the country of what is, peihaps, its greatest natural asset. My second point is this : For a Power which, like England, is based upon the sea —the sea being for the purposes of this question the Persian Gulf—railways coming down into these regions from the centres of the great land Powers can scarcely be a matter for congratulation. Our interests lie in spreading upwards our commerce by the great natural waterways which issue into the Persian Gulf. We may be unable to prevent the obtaining of concessions by foreign Powers for the building of railways. But we ought to be able to prevent the assignment of Turkish revenues, over all of which we have a considerable hold, for the purpose of finding kilometric guarantees for such railways, and so enabling them to compete on absolutely unfair terms with our river communications. It cannot be expected that river steamers should hold their own against railways which are enabled to carry goods for little or nothing, owing to their kilometric guarantees. If, by relaxing our hold upon l urkish finances in order to please the Germans, we connive at the building of such railways, it seems to me that we are merely forging a weapon against ourselves. Yours sincerely, (Signed) H. F. B. LYNCH. APPENDIX 10. THE NUSHKI-SEISTAN HAILWaY project, the BUNDER-DILAM-SH1RAZ railway project. [Extracts from a Report, dated August 30, 1903, by Lieutenant L. E. Hopkins, R.E.] TVY r O railway projects recommend themselves:— The Seistan Railway. The extension of the Nushki Railway to Seistan, though expensive and ume- munerative, would place us at once in an advantageous position, which, with a railway from the sea to Shiraz, would be unassailable. To extend the line to Seistan all that is required is to make up one’s mind to spend so much money, in what is a purely strategical line, as an insurance investment. Seistan is (, f value to England in so far as it is coveted by Russia. It may also be urged in favour of the Seistan Railway that it is the most likely route for a trans-continental line and would run via Meshed. If the line is made to Seistan it would only require a little more money to run it right through, and so obtain as much advantage from the scheme as possible. If ever Indian railways are connected with European, this is the most likely route for such connection. As for the heat encountered, it is after^ all nothing approaching the heat of Bengal and the Punjab, in which we in India make rail journeys without complaining. Shihaz Railway. The Shiraz Railway project has, on the other hand, commercial possibilities which have already attracted attention in Shiraz. The Manager of tiie Imperial Bank there appears to think a good deal of the scheme, and lias been making inquiries as to a good alignment. Probably private capital would be attracted by the scheme.Appendix 10. 271 Alignment. The Bushire route is impracticable. Starting from Bunder-Dilam, a line following the Palvan Kiver is quite feasible, and would not meet great engineering difficulties. There would be a continuous easy ascent to the one pass, distant bO miles, from Shiraz, and having an altitude of 7.200 feet. With a ruling grade of -yV, this pass could be crossed without a tunnel. The length of line from Shiraz to Bunder-Dilam would be about 210 miles or less. The country passed through is well watered and well timbered. The Mamaseni. though notorious robbers, need not be considered a formidable obstacle. In fact, Nasir Khan, the Bakhtiari Governor of Behbahan, if backed up, would soon bring them to reason. The Bakhtiari and the Arabs would of course welcome any British enterprise. There is plenty of heavy oak timber for minor bridging and small wood for fuel. The presence of naphtha near Kamuz and of coal near Borayjun would seem to indicate the probability of coal being found in paying quantities in the district. The country is well watered by large mountain rivers, in great contrast to Bars and Kerman, and it is quite certain that settled conditions would tend to increase the cultivated and populated area to an enormous extent. Traffic Prospects. The present value of trade of Mohammerah and Bushire is perhaps 2,400,000/. Of this a million represents opium, pearls, gum, carpets, &amp;c. The balance is mainly imported cotton goods, sugar, and tea, which would be carried over the railway to Shiraz, and thence to Ispahan and Kerman. The profit obtained from a charge of 5 per cent, on 1,400,000/. for carriage to Shiraz would be 70,000/. Allowing half of this for working expenses, there remains a balance of 35,000/., which would justify a capital expenditure of 700,000/. at 5 per cent. This amount gives 3,333/. per mile for cost of construction. There appears to be every reason to suppose that a metre- gauge line, with 4 ^ ruling grade, could be easily built for that amount, with terminal arrangements. It is, I understand, a fact that there may be any day on the Shiraz— Bushire road as many as 10,000 pack animals, a sufficient traffic to make any reasonably cheap railway pay There are, in fact, good reasons for promoting a thorough investigation of the route, the best harbour, and the prospects of the line generally. Conclusion. Enough has been said to show that we have here to hand a scheme which will not only serve our purpose of assuring our position in Southern Persia, but will also provide a remunerative investment for British capital, in a fine natural country, where even British annexation would be positively welcomed by the inhabitants. APPENDIX 11. MEMORANDUM HANDED TO M. ISVOLSKY, OCTOBER 14, 1908. HIS Majesty’s Government have examined with much interest and careful attention the aide-memoire communicated by the Russian Government to His Majesty s Ambas sador at St. Petersburgh on the 2nd (15th) August on the subject of railway construction in Persia. . . Some misapprehension appears to have arisen in regard to the precise nature 01 the proposals of His Majesty’s Government, who, in approaching the Russian Govern ment, contemplated not actual construction, but rather timely co-operation in ear marking Concessions which otherwise might be exploited to the detriment of Gieat Britain and Russia. His Majesty’s Government attach the highest importance to a complete under standing with the Russian Government on this question. They consider, however, for reasons which will be indicated forthwith, that any Convention now concluded by the two Powers with the Persian Government should be of a protective character,272 Appendix 11. and calculated to assure to Great Britain and Russia a secure position as regards enterprises involving political issues whenever the time is ripe for construction. Apart from the uncertainty of the political situation, there are many factors, now unknown quantities, which, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, render impracticable, in existing circumstances, any definite scheme of railway development m Persia, such, for instance, as the absence, at any rate in Southern Persia, of all surveys, even of a preliminary character, as the ultimate constitution of the Bagdad Railway Company, and as the question of whether or not a branch line is constructed from Bagdad to Khanikin. Many developments of this nature must be awaited before a railway from Julia to Mohammerah can be built with adequate prospects of commercial success. Moreover, the principal obstacle to railway construction in the immediate future is undoubtedly to be found in the governing consideration of cost, and in the difficulty of securing the necessary capital. The Russian aide-memoire emphasizes the inability of the Persian Government to meet the requisite expenditure, and the reluctance of the Russian Ministry of Finance to afford pecuniary assistance for this purpose. His Majesty’s Government on their part are fully persuaded that no projects of railway enterprise in Persia in the present economic and political condition of the country would be sufficiently attractive to induce British capitalists to select them as a field for investment; while His Majesty’s Govern ment would not feel justified in guaranteeing a minimum rate of interest where the risk involved would be difficult to estimate, but undoubtedly considerable. His Majesty’s Government find some difficulty in appreciating the full inwardness of the suggestion contained in the Russian aide-me'moire that the question of an important external loan is intimately connected with that of a Railway Concession, and should be dealt with simultaneously. If it is considered that a loan should be made to Persia on more favourable terms than would otherwise be the case, in return for the grant of a Railway Concession, then an addition must be made pro tanto to the cost of constructing the railway. His Majesty’s Government are not convinced that such procedure would be financially expedient, and they incline to the belief that it would tend to simplicity if these distinctive operations were to be considered upon their respective merits. As regards the question of an external loan, a comprehensive despatch, of which the substance will shortly be communicated to the Russian Government by His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh, has recently been received from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran on the subject of the actual financial position of the Persian Government. Mr. Marling, after reviewing the principal aspects of the question, arrives at the conclusion that the resources of the Persian State are, if properly administered, amply sufficient to enable necessary expenditure to be covered by existing revenue, and he expresses his conviction that any large advance made to the Persian Govern ment from abroad might, in the long run, aggravate rather than effectually relieve the present financial stress. His Majesty’s Government consider that the efforts of Great Britain and Russia should be directed to impressing upon the Persian Government that the real interests of the State imperatively demand a policy of retrenchment and financial reform ; that such reform must constitute the bed-rock of all economic progress and commercial prosperity ; and that, as a preliminary step in the desired direction, the Persian authorities should make it their first aim to afford the financial Inspector full support and loyal co-operation. It is, in the view of His Majesty’s Government, only upon the establishment of financial equilibrium in the Persian Budget that the question of actual railway con struction in the country can be faced with due regard to the elementary principles of commercial prudence. This construction should, they consider, be carried out under such conditions that a minimum rate of interest upon the capital involved would be secured, without the risk of defalcation, by the Persian Government. His Majesty’s Government are of opinion that, in view of the important political interests at issue, Great Britain and Russia would be fully justified in informing the Persian Government that, in the event of railway communications being established in Persia, they would expect to have the refusal, upon terms equally favourable to any offered by third parties, of all Concessions which might be in contemplation. His Majesty’s Government are well aware of the existence of the Russo-Persian understanding which precludes the grant of any Railway Concession in Persia before November 1910.Appendix 11. 273 A somewhat similar arrangement is in force between His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government whereby, in the event of railway construction being undertaken north of Tehran, a Concession for a railway in the south would forthwith be accorded to a British Company. His Majesty’s Government would suggest that these Agreements might well be made the basis of a further communication to the Persian Government, and at the same time the British and Russian Governments might intimate the lines to which they respectively attach especial importance. The Russian Government have already acquainted His Majesty’s Government with their views on this aspect of the question. His Majesty’s Government, on their part, besides tbe^ southern section of a line which may be built from Julfa to Mohammerah, would specify, as the Concessions which most closely concern them, the lines Bunder Abbas to Kerman, and Bunder Abbas, via Shiraz, to Ahwaz, with the option to construct a port at Khor Musa. It is stated in the Russian aide-memoire that the lines in the Russian sphere should serve to maintain and develop Russian interests (a) by the chronological order in which they are built, and (b) by adjustment of Tariff rates on the Mohammerah Railway. His Majesty’s Government consider that the drawbacks, in existing circumstances, of entering into detail as to the adjustment of Tariff rates, the allotment of shares, or the constitution of the Board of Control, are obvious, and they submit that any attempt to settle these matters would be premature and likely to lead to future embarrassment. However far they might be prepared to meet the Russian Govern ment in regard to the order in which the several lines may be built (a point which may well be reserved for subsequent consideration), they cannot but feel that it would be well-nigh impossible, if the Mohammerah Railway is to be worked on a commercial basis, to assent to anything that could be regarded as a discrimination of Tariff rates in favour of Russian goods. In conclusion, His Majesty’s Government, animated by a spirit of sincere friendship towards the Russian Government, and impressed with the importance of avoiding any action which may prejudice the beneficial development of commercial and political relations between the two countries, venture to express the hope that the question of connecting Askhabad with Meshed by rail may be allowed, for the present, to remain in abeyance. They are apprehensive lest, in the existing state of political feeling in Afghanistan, an additional element of unrest might be introduced into a situation which is already not devoid of difficulty if this question were to be prematurely brought into prominence. Foreign Office, October 9, 1908. APPENDIX 12. BRITISH AND GERMAN SHIPPING IN THE PERSIAN GULF. MEMORANDUM PREPARED IN THE BOARD OE TRADE. IN February, 190S, the Board of Trade learnt that Mr. F. C. Strick, of the Anglo- Algerian Steam-ship Conqiany, had been approached by Herr Ballin, Managing Director of the Hamburg-America Line, with the proposal that the British Combine trading to the Persian Gulf (the Anglo-Algerian line, the Bucknall line, and the West Hartlepool line) should “pool ” freights with the Hamburg-America line. Mr. Strick, who was the dominant influence in the British Combine, wa^ informed that such an arrangement would be dishtsteful to His .Majesty’s Govern ment. In March the matter was considered, amongst other questions relating to the Persian Gulf, by a Sub-Committee of the Imperial Defence Committee, and Mr. Strick, a representative of the Bucknall line, and other witnesses were then examined. During March and April the Board of Trade had a number of interviews with Mr. Strick, and it was plainly intimated to him that any agreement whatever between the British Combine and the Hamburg-America line was undesirable. Discussion [376] 4 B274 Appendix 12. also took place as to whether any inducements could be held out to Mr. Strick to abstain from any suck arrangements. Among the suggestions were : Gulf (a.) A subsidy, either direct or indirect; and (b.) The grant of Concessions to work iron oxide at various places in the Persian During tin's period If err Pallin was pressing Mr. Strick to come to an arrange' ment; Mr. Strick endeavoured to postpone the matter, and in the meantime informed the Board that he would attempt to frame some scheme for a subsidy based on postal services. On the 27th April, however, he intimated to the Board that a represen tative of the Hamburg-America line avus in London and was making urgent representations to the Combine, coupling them with threats that, should an agreement not be reached, the Hamburg-America line would send boats to Manchester, Liverpool, and London, and, by making arrangements with merchants there for a monthly service 5 , strike at the combined English trade. The following day Mr. Strick and his manager called at the Board of Trade and stated that an Agreement might be entered into during the next two days. In the discussion efforts were made to induce Mr. Strick to modify the proposed'Agreement and limit its duration to one year. An understanding, of which a copy is attached (vide Appendix), was subsequently reached between the British Combine and the Hamburg-America line, the main features of which were as follows:— 1. The British Combine agreed not to go to Hamburg. 2. The Hamburg-America line agreed not to go to ports in the United Kingdom or to Marseilles, which was left to the British lines. 3. 1 he British lines and the Hamburg—America line were both at liberty to go to Antwerp. (Herr Ballin tried to stop the British Combine from going to Antwerp but Mr. Strick would not agree.) 4. The British Combine and the Hamburg-America lines agreed to charge identical freights, the rates being those hitherto ruling for the British Combine. 5. The Hamburg-America line undertook not to take cargo from England with transhipment at Hamburg. 6. It was agreed that no through rates should be given by either partv from inland points in Germany or the United Kingdom to the Gulf. It may be pointed out that I\ T os. 3, 5, and 0 of these conditions met some of the objections which the Board of Trade had urged. Mr. Strick professed unwillingness to make the Agreement, but he viewed with alarm the competition of a powerful and (as he believes) subsidized Company, which might involve him in a freight war and might come to Liverpool, Manchester, and London. He informed the Board that he would be prepared to enter into a conflict with the Hamburg-America line onlv if he received a subsidy of 25,000/. a-year. Mr. Strick admitted that such an Agreement would, during its continuance, prevent the British lines from meeting, by a reduction of rates, any cheapening of the cost of transport to German manufacturers by the establishment of special export rates on the German railways. He admitted also that, whilst at present the Hambtiro-- America line is not doing well in the Gulf, the great majority of the merchants the~re being British and preferring to ship by British lines, yet if the Hamburg-America line could maintain itself in the Gulf for a few years German trade w r ould undoubtedlv develop considerably. On the other hand, he urged that a continuance of the present competition, especially if the Hamburg-America line went to Manchester, would involve him in heavy losses, that the proposed Agreement was only for one year, and that there would thus be an opportunity for reconsideration. Mr. Strick was unable to offer any explanation of the anxiety of the Hamburg- America line to secure an Agreement, more especially as he did not expect their earnings under it to be much larger than before, though they would save some what by the abandonment of Marseilles. Two possible explanations were, however, suggested :— (i.) That to the Hamburg-America line the choice lay between such an Agreement, which would somewhat reduce their losses, and an extension of com petition involving for some time a much heavier loss (especially if the service should be extended to Manchester), and that at a time of falling profits and general financial stress the former alternative was preferred ; andAppendix 12. 275 (ii.) That the Hamburg-America line found its Gulf service much too costly, and was anxious to reduce the service whilst saving its reputation. The Agreement—though never formally signed—came into effect, and according to Mr. Strick has been carefully observed, hut not extended beyond the conditions indicated above, which, it may be observed, relate to both outward and inward freights. Strenuous eliorts Avere then made to induce Mr. Strick to prepare not to renew the Agreement from the 1st April, 1909, and to secure him Mining Concessions in the Island of Ormuz. Prolonged negotiations, in which the Foreign Office, India Office, and Board of Trade took part, followed, the final result being non-success in the case of Mr. Strick and the grant of the Concession to another British firm in December 1908. There were, however, other Concessions for oxide in the Gulf to which Mr. Strick attached importance, e.g.. at Abu Musa, in regard to which he has been in communication with the Foreign Office and the India Office, and at the Islands of Sirri, Little Tamb, and Nahiyu Farur. As, however, the title to these islands seems to he in dispute and it is not certain that oxide of really good quality has been discovered upon them, it is perhaps doubtful if there is sufficient in these Concessions, even if with the support of His Majesty’s Government they could be obtained, to induce Mr. Strick to A\ r ithdraw from his Agreement with the Hamburg—America line. At an interview at the Board of Trade recently Mr. Strick expressed a strong desire for Government support for any endeavour he might make to purchase the Hamidieh steamers on the Tigris and to run a service on that river; he believes that it will he financially profitable, and wished to know if His Majesty’s Government Avould support him even if he intended to run the service in competition with Messrs. Lvnch. He was informed that, so far as the Board of Trade were aware, His Majesty’s Government would probably be prepared to support any British firm, whatever its intention as to competition with Messrs. Lynch. Mr. Strick implied that if he could purchase these steamers it would make a considerable difference in his attitude towards the Hamburg-America line. Mr. Strick was also sounded as to whether, in case it should be impossible for him to refrain from renewing the Agreement from the 1st April next, there Avas any consideration which would restrain him from renewing it except in its present form and for one year only. In this connection a discussion took place as to the practica bility of Mr. Strick running a boat to the smaller ports of the Gulf—more particularly on the Arabian side—not merely for the conveyance of cargo, but also for an inter port mail. He estimated the net annual cost of such a service at 13,000/. to 14,000/. He was prepared to consider such a proposition, but pointed out that if Herr Ballin insisted on a five-year Agreement for pooling freights, and renewed his threat to come to London, Liverpool, and Manchester if his proposal Avas rejected, the British Combine would he put in an extremely difficult position. The negotiations have been somewhat delayed OAving to the known financial weakness of the Bucknall lines, and uncertainty as to their future. Their interests have noAV been acquired by Messrs. Ellerman. Mr. Strick has, hoAvever, informed the Board of Trade that the British Combine continues as before, and that the two Companies other than his own MIoav his guidance entirely. The change of ownership has, however, undoubtedly modified the position. Hitherto the British lines trading in the Gulf have been :— (i.) I he British India Steam Navigation Company, with a service of two boats a week from Bombay. (ii.) r Che Anglo-Algerian Steam-ship Company (Strick and Co.), with eleven A r essels, all engaged in the Gulf service. (hi.) The Bucknall Lines, with a total fleet of twenty-four vessels, of which only two or three Avere engaged in the Gulf service. (iv.) The West Hartlepool Steam Navigation Company, with a total fleet of twenty vessels, of which only tAvo or three are engaged in the Gulf Service. (ii), (hi), and (iv) formed the British Combine, but the share of the Bucknall and \Y est Hartlepool lines in the trade AA r as small, and when they required an extra boat for the Gulf service they chartered one from Messrs. Strick. The weak Bucknall lines have now been acquired by the poAverful Ellerman lines, who previously possessed eighty vessels and a capital of nearly 1,500,000/. It may be added that Messrs. Andrew Weir and Co., shipowners, of Glasgow, who have acquired the Hormuz Mining Concession, also do a little trade in the Gulf, but it276 Appendix 12. is understood that hitherto their operations have been limited almost entirely to speculation in grain. 'Idle Bonrd of Trade are now informed that a representative of Herr Ballin has recently been in London, and that the Hamburg-America line desires a renewal of the Agreement in a stronger form from the 1st April next. Herr Ballin wishes for a pool, or at least a more comprehensive Agreement than tiie present one, for a period of five years. It is therefore a matter for His Majesty’s Government to decide at the earliest possible date— (a.) Whether the Hamburg-America line shall be opposed in the Persian Gulf for the next few years; or (b.) Whether an Agreement between the British Combine and the Hamburg- America line shall be permitted, but an attempt made to secure that it shall not be of such a nature as directly or indirectly to damnify British interests. It appears to be clear that, if possible, any Agreement should be avoided, for the following reasons :— I. Maintenance of Competition —Prom the point of view of British traders it is obviously most desirable that there should he competition in the supply of transport facilities to the Gulf, and that nothing should be done to stereotype freights and conditions. Not only would an Agreement put an end to the stimulus of competition, but Agreement rates—depending on the consent of two parties—are likely to be less readily responsive to changes in trading circumstances than the rates of independent competing lines. II. Danger of the Agreement being manipulated to the Advantage of German Traders. —There is a not inconsiderable risk of German traders getting the best of any Agreement fixing minimum freights, and in consequence damaging the interests alike of the British Combine and of British exporters to the Gulf. The German shipping lines, and especially the Hamburg—America line, are in close connection with the German Government. The German railways are State railways, and they give low rates for goods for export. These rates can easily be obtained, even when no general rate exists, by any exporter. In the event of competition between British and German goods in a neutral market, competing manufacturers and merchants have to take into account— 1. Itailw r ay carriage to port of shipment. 2. Sea carriage thence to port of delivery. Assuming British and German steam-ship lines to come to an agreement as to (2), it is still possible for German manufacturers to go to the State lfailw T ays and get a reduction as to (1). As things are, British manufacturers could probably not obtain a similar reduction. The Germans would therefore have an advantage which would tend to give them a larger share of the trade of the Gulf, whilst the British lines would be precluded by their Agreement with the Hamburg-America line from aiding British exporters and securing more cargo for themselves by reducing freights. I ne further danger, the introduction of through rates (combined rail and shipping rates), such as have been adopted for the German Levant and German Last Africa services, is guarded against by the terms of the existing understanding but might easily revive under a new Agreement. These rates, since they start with the railways, are weight rates instead of measurement rates. The division between the shipping Companies and the railways is kept secret, though it is knowm that the railway shares are very low, often much lower even than the special export rates ; and these two circumstances render it almost impossible to determine what the Shipping- Companies are really charging. It has recently been alleged in the “Manchester Guardian and the Shipping M orld that in the case oi the Levant trade, especially in textiles, the German lines are carrying goods actually at much less than the minimum rates agreed on with British lines ; and such evidence as is available tends to support the charge. III. British Prestige in the Persian Gulf—At present the hulk of the trade of the Gulf, and the greater part of the transport, is in British hands. The Hamburo-- America line is playing only a small part at present; an Agreement will give it the position ot an equal in regard to the Gulf trade. There is no doubt that Germany isAppendix 12. 277 mnking strenuous efforts to push her trade in the Gulf region and in Mesopotamia ; there is no reason why her competition should be facilitated. It is not clear why Herr Ballin is so anxious to obtain an Agreement. It may be that the losses are so heavy—it is estimated by Mr. Strick that the loss incurred by the If amburg-America line on the Gulf service is at least 50,000/. a-year—that in a period of retrogression they can he neither concealed nor defended, and that Herr Ballin is endeavouring to secure something which will appear to justify the long and costly struggle which he has made. Prom this point of view, it may he doubtful if he would care to incur a rare war, or add largely to his losses for a considerable time by going to London, Liverpool, or Manchester. Or, alternatively, it is possible that he is preparing (or that his Government is preparing) for some further action whose success depends on tying the hands of the British Combine. There are three possible courses :— 1. ^ To allow the Agreement to he made in whatever form the parties choose to make it; 2. To enable the British Combine (i.e., Messrs. Strick) to fight the Hamburg- America line; 3. To induce Mr. Strick, in renewing the Agreement, to renew it only in its present form and only for one year. The second course involves the payment to Mr. Strick for so long as the struggle should last of an annual subsidy up to 25,000/. How long the contest would be, and in fact if the Hamhurg-America line would fight at all, is of course altogether uncertain. The third course involves the payment of a postal subsidy for an additional boat with an inter-port mail especially on the Arabian side of the Gulf. Mr. Strick estimates that he would need a subsidy of 13,000/. to 14,000/. a-year for that purpose —it might take the form of a guarantee of any amount up to that maximum. It should he pointed out that this service round the Gulf, especially on the Arabian coast, would help British traders to develop new markets on that side of the Gulf. The scheme involves competition to some extent with the British India Company, but the main purpose would be to serve ports at which the British India steamers seldom or never touch. It is, of course, possible that the acquisition of the Hamidieh service on the Tigris would induce Mr. Strick not to renew the Agreement with the Hamburg-America line, but this is by no means certain. Again, he might possibly be induced only to renew the Agreement in its existing form, and for one year only, if he could obtain concessions for working oxide in some or all of the Islands of Abu Musa, Sirri, Little Tamb, and Nabiyu Farur; but it has already been pointed out that there are difficulties in the way of this. Should Mr. Strick appear strongly inclined to enter an enlarged agreement with the Hamburg-America line it will be desirable to warn him that he could not in future count on any support from His Majesty’s Government in any schemes which he might form. But if in the absence of any more definite action by His Majesty’s Government such an agreement should be made, it might later prove necessary for His Majesty’s Government to take steps to promote transport competition, in the interests of British trade; and such steps would obviously be both more difficult and more costly than the action which is now possible.
