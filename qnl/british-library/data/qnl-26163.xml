He suggested that the amount of his pay should be increased from Rs.300 a month to Rs.370 as a personal concession, or, alternatively, that he should be granted a personal allowance of Rs.70 a month. The pay of the confidential Clerk f orms part of the divisible expenditure, and three-quarters is borne by H.M.G. The Colonial Office, in their despatch of 30th January, accepted the second alternative and approved the grant of a personal allowance of Rs.70 a month. * The Government of India have now written stating that , they consider the requirements of the case will be met by the grant of a personal allowance of Rs.50 per mensem. Sir Bernard Reilly makes out a convincing case far- some increase in the pay of M. Fernandes; and as the difference between the rate sanctioned by the Colonial- Office and the rate proposed by the Government of India is not considerable, it seems preferable not to re-open the question. The added liability to India would only be Rs.60 a year, and that only until Separation, viz. for one year. From demi-official consultation with the Colonial Office it is understood that they are disposed to abide by their former decision. It Is submitted that we should write to the Government of India accordingly, A • O . Financial Secretary . For the favour of concurrence in the draft*. 'i r ?/j fal*- 'TO4289 5000 12 35 d&gt; !

With reference to the despatch from the Chief Commissioner and Resident in Aden to the Secretaxy of State for the Colonies, London, ho. 352, dated the 20th November 1935, a copy of which is enclosed, I am directed to say that the case of iar.

Ihey never-the* less agree that he is deserving of some increase in his Pay.

Mr. Fernandes joined the Residency Office in April 1907. ne was promoted to the post of nead Clerk on a salary of Rs.200-10-300 in 1922 and to that of the Confidential Clerk in 1929 on the same scale of pay, the maximum of which he reached in 1932. 3. Since the control of the Political work has been transferred from the Indian Government to the nome Government, the work has increased both in volume and importance. Formerly our dealings were confined to the tribes in the Protectorate, how we have important relations beyond the Protectora?te extending to the Xemen as a result of the conclusion of the Treaty of San’a. The addition to my staff of a Second Political Officer and a Frontier Officer has further increased the political work which falls very largely on the Confidential Clerk. 4.

As stated above Mr. Fernandes* salary at present amounts to Rs.300/- per mensem which he has drawn for the last 3 years. I do not consider this sufficient remuneration for a man who holds a responsiole and confidential position and who has served Government for 29 yearsyears with ability and intergrity. in view oi this and oi the fact that his work had considerably increased as explained above* I sanctioned the revision ol his ps.y to Rs. 300-10-370 with effect from 1st October a 935 under the financial powers delegated to me as Chief Commissioner in the Government of India* Finance Department* letter imo* D-7877-Est-32 dated the 4th October 1932 permitting ml*.

WALTOR 343(!a 5000 1.3528 I am directed by Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister to transmit to you for the consideration of Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, a copy of a despatch from the Resident at Aden recommending increased rates of pay and an increase of staff for the Arabic Branch of the Residency. 2. The staff in cuestion are presumably servants \ of the Government of India although under the ^7 ^ agreement with that Government with regard to divisible expenditure, the pay of the Arabic Branch is met wholly by His Majesty’s Government. A pension contribution is also borne by His Majesty’s Government. 3. In the circumstances explained by the Resident, Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister is disposed to agree to the proposals, and would suggest the grant of a personal allowance to the Head Interpreter instead of the revised scale of salary. 4. pA*C^ THE UNDER SECRETARY OP STATE, INDIA OFFICE. 25 /Ai*vrT--vsrgVBefore asking the Lords Goimnis si oners of the Treasury to sanction the additional expenditure involved, which is estimated with * pension contributions to amount to approximately £200 per annum in all, I am to enquire whether the Secretary of State for India sees any objection to the Resident’s proposals* t I am, Sir, Your most obedient servant, r —— \ —— —'Copy ' NO. 313. r 1 .558 ! t pj j T he &gt; Ees idency, Aden. 28th November, 1934. Sir, I have the honour to address you on the * I subject of the clerical establishment of the Political I Branch of this Residency. 2. The present establishment, which has not M been increased since the Great War, consists of a Head I interpreter who acts as Head clerk of the Arabic Office, I an Accountant, and two assistant interpreters or 1 clerks. 3. With the increased contact with the Protectorate which has resulted since 1928 from the I reorganisation of the Political Branch of the Residency, 1 end tne substitution of Royal Air Force for Military I control, the work of the Political clerical branch has I proportionately increased, and it has been evident for I some time that the present clerical staff is insufficient! to cope with the many clerical and other duties con- ! nectea with Protectorate affairs, which are required P of it. 4. The conclusion of the Treaty of San’a resulting in frequent correspondence with the King of the Yemen and his^idfeSL-lr^frresentatives, together H with the addition to my staff of a 2nd Political Officer and a Frontier Officer, have now still further |i added to the work of the clerical branch and have made | an increase in their numbers essential. His Majesty’s Secretary of State for the colonies, London.0 l?1&gt; - 0 ?- o. The greatest need is for special clerks to deal with the translation of correspondence, and so leave the other clerks, who at present divide this duty, more free to deal with more important work. 6. I therefore request sanction to engage two extra assistant interpreter clerks whose chief duty would he the translation of correspondence, hut who would also he available a^ interpreters when required, both in Aden and to accompany either of the Political Officers or the Frontier Officer into the Protectorate. The question of their pay is dealt with helow. 7. The present graded rate of pay for the Head Interpreter was sanctioned hy the Government of Bombay in 1927 under Resolution No.86 of 12th April. In recommending this increased rate, Major- General J.H.K. Stewart, who was then Resident, mote, H His post is a very responsible one. In addition to dealing with the heavy correspondence work of the Arabic Office, he has practically taken the place of the Native Assistant to the Resident, whose post was abolished in 1900. He collects news from all available sources, assists at interviews with Arab Chiefs and notables and supervises the arrangements for their entertainment in Aden. He is largely consulted as to the nature of entertainment to be given and the amount of presents to be granted. This has to be done with a detailed knowledge of the status and idiosyncrasies of each Chief and notable of the numerous tribes in the Protectorate many of whom are difficult to deal with owing to their mutual jealousies, their avarice and their exaggerated idea of their own importance. The Head Interpreter has therefore constantly to exercise judgment, patience and. tact.' TheseThese responsibilities have now greatly increased for reasons which I have given in paragraphs 3 and 4 above, and I do not consider^She present pay of the Head Interpreter is adequate. I therefore recorrrnend that it should be increased by Rs.50/~ a month, or, as an alternative, that the present Head. Interpreter, Khan Sahib Muhammad Salim, who has held the post for 5 years, should be granted a personal allowance of Rs.50/- a month. 8. The other interpreters and clerks are at present included in the total establishment of 11 clerks allowed for the Residency Office under the above mentioned Resolution, and their graded pay varies according as vacancies occur in the various grades. 9. At the time when this Resolution was published, the pay of the clerical staff of the Political Branch was Dome by the Government of India. it is now wholly a charge against His Majesty f s Government. 10. I therefore recommend that the pay of the different grades of the clerical staff of the Arabic branch should be determined entirely separately from that of the English branch, which is still the responsi bility of the Government of India, and should be based on that laid down in Bombay Government Resolution No.86 of 12th April 1927. 11. I append as an attachment to this despatch a statement shewing the present graded rates of pay and those which I now recommend. 12. The total increased annual expenditure on this account will be £167. I have, etc. , (Sd.) B.R. Reilly.
