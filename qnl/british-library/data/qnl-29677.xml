Mr. Eden was the guest at lunch in Ahwaz on 7th January of Mizbah Fat end, the Governor-General of Khuzistan. 2. Mr. Eden thought that you might like to know that in the subsequent private conversation the Governor- General stated that this province was now quiet and contented. The Governor-General was convinced that, by cooperating with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company he was acting in the best interests of the Persian Government. The programme of improvements in housing and welfare envisaged by the Anglo-Irani an Oil Company would, he felt, result in the present happy conditions being maintained. Also, with the assistance of the Company, Ahwaz might well become one of the best towns in Persia in a very short time. 3. Mr. Eden replied that Great Britain wished to see Persia remain a free and independent sovereign state. There were certain realities in foreign affairs today and one of them was that Persia and Great Britain must work together. Satisfactory labour conditions and a contented people constituted the best means of resisting Communism. 4. Afterwards Mr. Eden told me that he had been impressed by the Governor-General who had a remarkable record of co-operation with British interests during [groups omitted ]. 5. Mr. Eden left Ahwaz by air for Abadan at 16.30 hours 7th January. [Copy sent to Middle East Secretariat]. [Note by Communications Department. Repetition of j&amp;issing groups is being requested].
