After compliments, Agha Mir^a Abu Talib Shademan son of late Agha Mohammed Baqir Behbehani died about two months ago in Bushire and as far as I know he possesses a house at Bahrein, but I am not aware whether he possesses anything else there. Having left two a fiiir i - . IWiMUHaniKV sisters and a wife as his heir. One of these two sisters is my legal wife and both Of them are unaware of their brother T s death. I request you that on safeguarding the interests of my wife kindly advise the ^Oxitical Agent there to enquire about the property and belongings of the late Mir^a Abu Talib either moveable or unmoveable and to let you know on rr iy behalf and also to take my wife’s share so as to enable me to send a Power of Attorney for their sale and remitting the proceeds for such action of kindness I shall remain grateful for ever.

Sir, dith reference to your letter IJo:479, dated 19th ' February 1932, I have the honour to inform you that enquiries wore made about the estate of the deceased, Agha Mirza Abu Talib Shademan, who is reported to have been a clerk in the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Ltd., and I understand that he has loxt nothing but a house, situated at Manama, Fariq Baqoha, in Bahrein. rhe house, too, it is said, had not been in his sole possession, lor Lahmood bin Kal Baqir, the brothor-in-law of the deceased, who is occupying the house at present, claims l/3rd of the house, while 3/4th of the remaining portion he assign^s to the heirs of one Kal Re ha, ^sho is said to have died in Bushire some 15 years ago# This division leaves only l/6th of the house for the heirs of late x^lia uirza Abu Talib Shademan, but Lahmood bin Kal Baqir could not produce any documentary proof to A O support these claims, and if Agha tfirza^Talib Jhademan has not died intestate, there would be no fear of his estate falling in the hands of wrong persons. i would advise Itaji habatullah to get a power of attorney from all the heirs of the deceased, duly attested by the dhara, appointing an agent in Bahrein to look after their interests, if none of them can personally attend the Court; or to authorise the Agency to dispose of the estate safeguardingI P.U.C.l Letter No.1011 dated the 8th Lhul Hijjah 1352(the 24th karch 1934) from ’Abdullah bln Jalawi,Amir of Hasa to Colonel Loch, Political A^ent,Bahrp.in , I P.
