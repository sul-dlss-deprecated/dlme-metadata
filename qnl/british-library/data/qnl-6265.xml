With reference to your telegram of 8 th October. The contingency alluded to is not adumbrated in any recent re ports from Koweit or Mohammerah. On the other hand recent changes in the political situation in Central Arabia al ready communicated to Government give reasonable grounds for the supposition that the Arabs of Nejd have been driven to desperation by the Porte’s persistent interference and may be disposed to combine in order to free themselves from the burden, and the Sheikh of Mohammerah may be interested as adviser and friend of Mubarek. I think they all realise however that they could not permanently succeed unassisted even as an Arab confederacy and must recognise the indis pensability of protective support from a Christian Power preferably ourselves, if we are prepared to give it in time and effectively.Ho: .2 4 of iPoe;. &amp; British I-osiden&lt;37 and J'iu jhire, Ooxobar l^ne.

Sir, ^ \ 0 T T the loth Septemter last I received a telegram from His iiajesty’s Consul at Bussorah stating that two tales oi piece goods, destined for Koweit and overcarried to Bus sorah in a British Indian steamer, had teen detained at the custom-house on the ground that Howe it was a Tur kish port and had no custom-house, and that, therefore, goods must pay import duties at Bussorah. the “ irector oi Customs at Bagdad was sa.id to te acting in this matter on the or— ders of the Central Customs.

Crow to inquire what had happened. Hr. Crow replied on the 26th instant to the effect that the agent had failed to induce the local Turkish authorities to allow the re shipment of the goods, and that the matter had been re ferred to the ~irector of Customs at Bagdad. Had I known that the goods were consigned to Sheik kubarek himself, I should have asked for your instructions inin the first instance. As the matter stands, if the fur bish authorities persist in their demand for payment of duty and refuse to allow reshipment, I should te ;^lad to learn whether you would wish me to mate representations to the Sublime Porte on the subject, insisting on the fact that Koweit is not a, furbish port, or whether I should simply asb that permission may be given for the goods to te reshipped. In the latter case it would no doubt be obvious to the furbish ~'overnment that we were endeavour ing to evade the main question of the status of Roweit, and such evasion would very possibly strengthen them in their attitude.

I have *ohe jionour to inform ^ ou tixat at a visit paid ’oo me bj Sheikh Mobarak txiis morning he informed me that certain Koweit merchants, subjects of his and trading in Basra,v/ere being pressed bj the Turkish axxthoril ies to take out certificates of nationality, p resumab ly Trxrki sh• 3. FFailing compl^Ciance,they were threat- -»ened with being expelled the town* 3. Sheikh Jlobaraic said that he had told these men tixat on no account should they accept such certificates and that t/u-y should prefer expulsion and come to him for orders and redress. 4. I suggested to the Sheikh that it would be advisable for me to consult jrou on tne subject and ohe Sheikh replied that txiat was wiraf he wished. 5. The Sheikh specially instanced the case of Hamad ul Khalid \Tl\o is one of the brothers, partners in tire firm of Ml Khatiiair. Tnls firm has extensive dealings all over the ' ulf, including Basra, and in India and theoretically, it would not seem thatthat there were any very grave objections to the Basra partner taking out a certificate of Turkish nationality, if the result would be to facilitate his business relations and to induce the Basra autho- -rities to leave him in peace. It would not affect the general question of Koweit independence, complete or partial,at all* 6. At the same time. Sheikh Mobarak v/ill not understand tliis and evidently feels very strongly on the subject and he may be aware of difficulties and indirect pressure that might be brought to bear if the point were conceded, 7, I have therefore the honour to solicit the favour of instructions as to the reply to be given to Sheikh Llobarak vis: what advice should be offered to Mm# I would also express my regret at the vague indications which are all that I have been •able to give as to the difficulty in which Sheikh llobarak finds himself. It did not seem to me ad visable to press him to be more explicit,until I knew what my attitude should be on the general question. 8, The merchant is in a difficult posi- -tion through no fault of his own.If he complies with the Turkish orders he is in difficulty with Sheikh llobarak.If he refuses, the Turks expel him. If this view of the question were placed before the Basra authorities by H.B.M's Consul, acting under in strict ions, they might be induced to recognise the injudiciousness of the order and the fact that non- -compliance with the order would hardly justify the expulsion of a peaceful trader. 9, Before however, such a remonstrance was addressed, it would be necessary to obt-ain some evi— -dance,more e&gt;rplicit than v/hat is at present ava.il- - able, of the nature of the certificate and the ex- -tent of pressure applied to induce the merch.uit tor z* t»aKe ujaem out.•Such evidence would not., I ijrua't, oe difficult \jO obtain through the Sheikh of Koweit f if it is considered adviable to contest the Turkish /i claim.

Curely if Mubarek does want us to do something he should give you rather more information. I mean that if the Government of India are to move in the matter they will require exact particulars of the names and descriptions of the merchants involved, the circumstances under which the certificate is being forced on them, the literal wording of the certificate - enough data in short, to give them an exact idea of the political bearings of the matter. Would it raise Hubarek’s hopes too high (for I doubt Government’s doing anything efficacious) if you obtained these facts fur from him? or should I approach Crow?

This form is however not tl to wether novel and was reported in ;C’ letter No.3Pb, dated the 3dth July 1907 to your address, when Sneikn llobarak reported that certain Koweit meron-uits trading in Basra had been warned bi tne then vfaii of Basra to take out certificates of Airkish n.^- -tionality or they would be expelled the town.

Sheikh I lobar ak now informs me that one Hammaid al Khalid,a member of the firm of A1 iihathair, one of our biggest pe ,rl merchants, hada claim of £?1000 which he sought bring before H,FI*the Wall of Ba^ra for redresa.His Fbccellenc: absolntel^ refused to entertain the clain»until Hamiaad took out a certificate of Turkish natio- -n ait:’.Hm;tfl, so it is rerorterl, took out the cer- -tificate, as otherwise he /ouli have been unable to recover the debt. 8 .

I declined to administer this rebuff to nc’ friend ^ahad al Khalid on the two grounds ( 1 )that I was not aware what view would be taken by juiy superior officers of H-amniad's action an 1(3) that I had no authority whatever to control the aci ions or coiuuent on the conduct of Arab merchants trading in Basra^ an l the dheikh laug,ning admitted the reasonableness of ui contention. 10 . Personally,! :*ui inclined to ioubt whether Hamiuad took out tne certificate of Turkish nationality v/iihout the Bheilih’s approval and am of the opinion that ne was probably directed to do so in tne hone that his action might induce the British imbassy to interfere and procure tne issue of instructions to His Excellency tne Wall of Basra not to disturb the status quo and thins ease the completion of the ^adhagiya sale which Sa is what Mobarsk; really has at heart. n. fo bring ihe history* of the ^adhagiya case up to date, I have the honour to pi ice on re- oori. the f vro that, it Sheikh kobarik’s request. on the 33nd instant, 1 addressed H.B.Id’s Jonsul it5^ Basra,’oriva'bel^ infonaing him ‘that# His }h:cellano' the Wall oontinned to throw obstacles in the vr v of The completion, of The sale of the ^adh&amp;gil/a property, that Vbiul Aziz bin Bilim bin B idar had been instructed b^‘ Sha ikh I.lobaraii. to prepare a Moqawala or prelimin ait contract of s -la/,to h^ve it signed the chief notables of Basra and then. v resent it to H.B.H* s Oon3ul, ba sra,in orler tn it the latter mipnt witness tne dooimient.l trusted that H.B.M's Jonsul, v/ould see his wc to comply with this reque it, as Sheiih Jlobarak was of the opinion that His Excellency the tali would probably then .rLthdraw his opposition. 1?. It iaai r also be of interest to record that I h ive been informed that the Fadhagiia pro- •oertj' macr give rise to inconvenient questions in the future is there is astawkward claim of iY-vqaf that hangs over the pronerttf.It atpears that tne original '^adhagi^a nro'certc was unioubtedlj Howkouf to the Haramain on the failure of natural heirs b: the will of tiie first ho Her. Tne property now sold to Mobarak is part of the alluvial soil thro\/n ur&gt; b^ the Shatt-el-Arab around tne origin u. property ani the contention of tne seller Ahmed az 3ah dr and other owners of the alluvial soil is that on Ip the original strip of land is Ilowkouf an i that the accretions can form tne subject of sale or transfer.To this the claimants on behalf of the Wakaf reply that alluvial soil follows tne laid ad jointing and that in any case, the date trees on the alluvial soil ire offsets from tne Wakaf property and therefore roMmouf.There is thus all the room for a cause celebre in which the Turkish courts and lawyers would revel,over the alluvial soil and it is alleged tnat this explains Ahmed Pasha tz Zahair*s wish to get rid of tne lajid.^ms 3t* 13.

It is only to be expected that the Porte should object, as the Persian Government does, to foreign nationalists possessing landedlanded property in tine country, and conversely should insist in cases where they do so possess property, on their agreeing to be amenable in respect of such property to the local Courts, and to refrain from invoking protection from dapitulations; but this end can be attained, and is in Persia without any condition of independent registration, and for this demand, apparently a new one, there seems no manner of justification. It can only be presumed that it is the outcome of the personal attitude of the present Wali, who has evinced several signs of aggressive activi ty in such directions (for instance in connection with the af fairs of n/akra) which if it cannot be checked is calculated to give us a good deal of incovenience in these waters. 4. I venture to hope that the Government of India will see grounds in the accompanying reports, for moving his majesty*s government to take such steps in the direction of representation to the Porte, as will induce the latter to discontinue this de mand for the independent registration of ^oweitis as lur^ish subjects, and to bring about an improvement of the attitude of their present Wall at Buareh.

The objections raised by the Wali were, as you are aware, on the ground that Sheikh Mobarak must first take out an Ottoman teskereh as a Turkish subject. Influence is, however being brought to bear on the Council of Ministers to have these objections removed, and the Vali himself has promised Mr. Crow to do what he can in the matter. The question,is, I may add, a different one from that of the Fao lands near the fort of koweit, which was settled satis factorily a few months ago, as reported in my despatch No.396, of the 20th May last. I have etc., Gerard Lowther, Inclosure 1 in No.l. Consul Crow to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 6 ).[Yv L Buesorah, February 12, 1909 With reference to my telegrams No.67 of the 29th December No .2 of the 8 th January, and No.3 of the 9th January last, I have the honour to report that I have proceeded to Koweit on the 29th ultimo by sea, my departure having been delayed two days in consequence of the weather, and returned overland on the llth instant. Major Knox was good enough to place his steam launch at my disposal, and Sheikh Mobarak provided me with camels for the return journey. As already reported by telegraph, my journey was in connec tion with the difficulties raised by the vali in regard to the transfer of the property of Fadaghia, situated in the kaza of Fao, and consisting of 430 jereebs (about 416 acres) of land lately purchased by Sheikh Mobarak of Koweit from Ahmed Pasha- es-Zoheir for £T.48,706. The vali would not allow the transfer to be made unless he, the Sheikh, registered himsilf as an Otto man subject. What the vali actually said when remonstrated with was that the person who wanted the transfer must produce papers of nationality, and, if an Arab, he must produae papers of Turk- isn nationality. In accoradance with your Excellency*s instruc tions, I suggested to the vali that 'nationality - koweit' on the transfer might be accepted in place of 'Ottoman Subject', but his Excellency refused to entertain the suggestion, and in sisted on the Sheikh describing himsilf as a Turkish subject in the transfer papers, and on his taxing out a nufuss teskereh At the desire of the Sheikh two preliminary agreements res which, signed by Abdul Wahab xirtas, as representative of the sellers, Zoheir Pasha and his wife, was executed in^presence at Bussorah and witnessed by a number of the Bussorah notables; thy other copy in blank being handed to me to deliver to Sheikh hobarax at Koweit for his signature and legalisation by His Ma jesty* s Political Agent at xoweit. These documents, duly executed record the fact of the sale having taken place and the receipt of the money, and are good and bj^ing as between the parties as well peoting the sale of the Fadaghia land were drawn up, one copy of themeJlvosthemselvas. They would form a basis for arbitration should oc casion arise, but they would have no validity in the courts of the Sheriat, nor would they, it appears, operate as a legal transfer of the land or take the place of the usual proceedings at the Tapoo Office, which are left over for completion until the val^s opposition in the matter can be overcome* I took the duplicate agreement to Koweit with me for sig nature as described, and availed myself of the opportunity to . discuss the whole question with hajor Knox and the Sheikh him self* It would appear that the vali*s opposition is premedi tated, and goes to the root of the whole matter. His Excellen cy has, according to Sheikh Mobarak, again raised the question of Koweitis who reside and trade at Bussorah taking out certi- ficates of Turkish nationality before their claims or complaints are entertained by the vali or the courts. In July 1907 Sheikh Mobarak appears to have reported to His Majesty^ Political Agent that the then vali of Bussorah, Hassan Bey, had notified certain Koweit merchants trading at Bussorah to register themselves as Ottoman subjects under penalty of expulsion if they refused. The merchant interested, however, left Bussorah of his own ac cord, and the matter dropped. Sheikh Mobarak also complained of the treatment accorded to Hammad-el-Khalid, a rich pearl mer chant of Koweit, who sought to recover £T.1,000 at Bussorah. The vali, according to the Sheikh, insited on the aan registering himself as an Ottoman subject before efcpe entertaining the claim and it seems that he acceeded to this demand in order to recover his debt. Major Knox is of opinion that Khalid was probably infetructed by the Sheikh to take out the nufuss teskereh with a view to bringing about our interference, and so obtain the issue of instructions to the vali which would assist the Tapoo opera tions in connection with the transfer of the Padaghia property, in which the Sheikh himself is deeply interested. The vali also wrote to Sheikh Mobarak, so the latter informed us, inviting him to send a deputy to the Turkish Parliament, but the Sheikh had not yet answered the letter. /■ Tue vali is undoubtedly doing his best to disturb the status v/ quo preiously arranged between His Majesty’s Government and the r SublimeSublime Porte in regard to the howeit question, and it is un likely that he will be induced to modify his attitude by any arguments of mine without special instructions from Constant!- ; T i nople. Moreover, in view of your Excellency 1 s-repert- telegram of the 2nd January, in which you say it would be inexpedient to raise the Koweit question at present, I hesitate to approach the vali directly on the subject without your Excellency^ instruc tions, as in view of his general attitude and his recent action in regard to Tapoo proceedings it would be difficult to do so without going into the whole question. It would perhaps tide over the difficulty if the vali could be instructed to give- grant facilities to the Sheikh for the transfer of his property in the present instance, failing which it seems not improbable that the Sheikh may cause the land to be registered in the names of his sons, and direct them to ta&amp;e out certificates of Turkish nationality for the purpose. In the course of a conversation which ^ajor hnox and I had with the Sheikh, I gathered that the latter entertained no great objection t himself to such a proceeding, but I presume it would be against our interests to permit him to do so in view of the complications itmight lead to after his death. It would certainly strengthen the contention of the Turks that howeit belongs to them. I have etc., F. E. Crow Inclusure 2 in No.l. Consul Crow to Sir G. Lowther. (Uo.42). Sir, Bussorah, July 12,1909. yesterday In conversation/with the vali yesterday I referred to the registration of the Sheikh of Koweit’s land at Fadaghia purchase 1 from Ahmed Pasha-es-Zoheir to which the late vali, Moharrem Ef- fondi, had raisdd objections on the ground that Sheikh Mobarak must take out an Ottoman Teskereh as a Turkish subject first, and I pointed out that the Sheikh was already the holder of large estates in the vilayet, which had been registered previously inin his nama without this difficulty, I said the taskerah precaution seemed to superfluous and meaningless, as according to the convention of 1867 foreigners could acquire land in Turkey, and that the arrange ment entailed their assimilation to ©ttoman subjects. His Excellency agreed, and said that Moharrem Effendi had blundered, but that the real difficulty arose from the matter having been misunderstood at the Sublime Porte, which imagined that the transfer referred to large tracts of Government land at Ghermet Ali claimed by Ahmed Pasha es-Zoheir, and regarding which litigation was proceeding between the latter and the Ottoman Government. The vali said he was in com munication with Constantinople on the subject, and hoped to settle the question shortly. He added, however, that Sheikh Mobarak de sired the land registered in the name of one of his sons, and had offered no objection to his taking out an Ottoman teskereh for the purpose, though he seemed to shrink from letting him appear personally at Hussorah to complete the formality. I said I hoped his Excellency would endeavour to smooth over the difficulty, and let the Sheikh register his land at Fadaghia in the same way as his other properties, and the vali promised me to do what he could in the matter. This is the first I have heard of the Fadaghia property being mistaken for that of Ghermet All. They have of course nothing to do with one another, and are situated in totally different parts of the district. I am informed privately that Ahmed Pasha-es- Zoheir and his family have been in possession of property at Gher met Ali for many years, and hold the title-deeds of the land. There is great enmity between his family and that of the nakib, with whom the vali is at present very friendly, and the claim now put forward to this property by the Government seems to be the result of an in trigue on the part of Seyyid Talib, the nakib’s son. It is possi ble the vali may have wished to mislead me, for it is quite certain that the Porte laid great stress on Mobarak-es-Sabah taking out a teskereh of Ottoman nationality, and gave orders to hold over the registration of the transfer of Fadaghia until the formality was completed. I am also informed that Ahmed Pasha-es-Zoheir has been en deavouring42- deavouring to settle the matter through the Council of State at Cons tantinople, and that he telegraphed recently that instructions were being sent to the vali to permit the registration of the transfer. The vali made no allusion to this in his conversation with yesterday. I have etc., F.E.Crow. 1 i /—s 1[Confidential!] No. 288, dated Busliire, the 30th January (received 8th February) 1910.

Trevor, LA., First Assistant Resident in charge of Residency, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department.^,- j- With reference to Foreign Department endorsement No. 1594-E.A., dated 7th October 1909, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copv of the No. C..7, dated the i8th January 1910 . mar ginally-noted letter on the subject of Sheikh Mubarak’s Fadhagiya property, which I have received from the Political Agent, Koweit. ^ &gt;r v j No. C.-7, dated Koweit, the 18th January 1910 (Confidential). From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To—The lirst Assistant Resident in charge of the Residency, Bushire. I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with your Second Assistant’s endorsement No. 2667, dated the 24th October 1909, regarding the claim advanced by the Turkish authorities for the registration of Sheikh Mubarak as an Ottoman subject as a proceeding necessary to the legal transfer of landed property purchased by him. 2. In my letter No. 444, dated the 7th August 1909, I reported that the Sheikh was inclined to leave matters in status quo and that the new Wali, an Arab by name Sayid Arif Bey, was not hostile, -whilst the question of Sheikh Mubarak’s registration as a Turkish subject had not been pressed. 3. I would now cast back to the purchase in February 1909 by Sheikh Mubarak of what is known as the Fadbagiya property of the az-Zuhair family, and would observe that this letter deals with the registration question arising out of the purchase of that property alone and not with the Sheikh’s Fao estates. In recent conversations the Sheikh mentioned tba^ the Turkish officials were not as complacent as formerly towards him and his properties and eventually he furnished me with copies (I have not seen the originals) of the sale-deeds of the Fadhagiya property, and it will suffice if the following points from them are noted:— (a) That the Fadhagiya property was shared by various members of the az-Zuhair family and therefore four separate sale-deeds became necessary. (b) That the purchase by Sheikh Mubarak was completed on the 21st Mohurrum 1327 (=14th February 1909), part of the price being paid on the spot in cash and part by drafts due at various dates, which the Sheikh informs me have all since been cashed. (c) That one Abdul Wahab al-Kirtas acted in all except one case as the attorney of the vendors. (d) That in each sale-deed is contained a condition that the vendor or his attorney, Abdul Wahab, shall arrange for the necessary transfers in the registers of the Land Revenue Office (the Tapu Office) of the Basrah Vilayet. {e) That Sheikh Mubarak entered into possession from the date of the purchase. 4. ‘It appears that immediately after the sale, which took place in the time of Mahrum Effendi as Wali, Abdul Wahab al-Kirtas applied for the necessary transfer in the Land Registers to be made to Sheikh Mubarak’s name. The transfer was refused by the Superintendent of the Tapu Office and Abdul Wahab accordingly on the 9th Shabat 1324 (22nd February 1909) complained by letter to the Wali of his subordinate’s dilatoriness. From a copy (which theSheikh has apparently succeeded in securing) of the orders and remarks passed on this petition, it appears that the Wali, Mahrum Effendi, forwarded the petition for remarks to the subordinate concerned, who replied on the same date that a telegram from the Ministry of the Interior at Constantinople prohibited the transfer pending further orders, to which the Wali appended the equivalent of our routine official remark c Noted *. Sheikh Mubarak’s explanation of this telegram is that Mahrum Effendi was inimical to him and hearing of his intended purchase of the Eadhagiya property telegraphed to Constantinople that the purchase was being made by Mubarak with British gold, and it was upon this falsehood that the Ministry of the Interior telegraphed the order to delay the completion of the sale. Tiffs delay was effected at Basrah by a refusal to register the land-transfer unless Sheikh Mubarak took out a Nationality certificate labelling him as a Turkish subject. The means of salvation were communicated to Abdul Wahab al-Kirtas, but he on behalf of Sheikh Mubarak at once said that such a course was unprecedented in the case of any well-known merchant or large landowner in Basrah and much less to be contemplated in the case of an influential Sheikh of Mubarak’s position who moreover held many other acres on the Shatt-el-Arab and had never hitherto been requested to conform to a regulation which was enforced but seldom and then only in the case of petty nobodies. 5. Abdul Wahab al-Kirtas continued trying at intervals to effect the transfer and Sayid Arif Bey, the Arab who succeeded Mahrum Effendi as Wali in May 1909, endeavoured to help him by getting the earlier order cancelled at Constantinople. Nothing however resulted, and Arif Bey was in turn succeeded in October 1909 by Suliman Nathif Pasha, the present Wali. Abdul Wahab addressed himself to the newcomer at the first opportunity and was told at once and very plainly that no transfer would be made until Mubarak had duly registered himself as an Ottoman subject. 6. Nothing further has happened and now, a year after Sheikh Mubarak took possession of the property, the price has been paid up in full, Mubarak pays the taxes, but the property still stands in the name of the az-Zuhair family and so far as the Turkish authorities and Courts are concerned is still their property. 7. Ahmad Pasha az-Zuhair, who is the head of the family and represents Basrah in the new Turkish Parliament, promised his good offices in Constanti nople, but from his ^ efforts, if indeed any were made, nothing has hitherto residted, and as Sheikh Mubarak pointed out “he has received his money, why should he trouble further about the purchaser and the property.” 8. Sheikh Mubarak now feels that he can do no more to settle the matter himself, that there is no hope of changing the present Wall’s (Suliman Nathif Pasha’s) attitude, and therefore requests that His Majesty’s Ambassador in Constantinople may be urged to take up the cudgels for him to obtain either a rescission of the previous orders or a definite exemption from the necessity for registration either of his property or his person as Turkish. 9. The above gives the story of the Sheikh’s difficulties from his point of view and much of the ground has already been covered in Mr. Consul Crow’s two despatches to Sir Gerald Lowther, dated the 12th February and 12th July 1909, though from a different aspect. 10. From the previous correspondence on the subject it will be apparent that, in spite of the sheikh s local efforts, Mr. Consul Crow’s endeavours, and the late Wali Arif Bey’s assistance, the demand for Turkish registration still continues. The question is a most important one as affecting the whole status of Koweit and one which would appear now to be capable of solution only in Constantinople or London. The Sheikh informed me that only one Koweiti has so far taken out a Turkish certificate of nationality, Hamid al-Khalid, whose case was reported in my predecessor’s letter No. 48 of the 27th January 1909. The Fadhagiya property sale-deeds stand in the Sheikh’s own name, but he informed me that the property known as Mutawiya, which he purchased from Sheikh Sadun of the Muniifich, stands in the names of Hamid-al-Khalid and the Sheikh s sons, Jabir, Salim and Hamed bin Mobarak. The transfer of this Mutawiya property was duly registered in the Tapu Office records, nodifficulty being made presumably because Hamid-al-Khalid had already taken out a Nationality certificate. The Sheikh said that his sons had not taken out certificates as is suggested likely in Mr. Crow’s despatches quoted above. 11. In discussing the matter, I informed the Sheikh that before His Majesty s Ambassador could even be asked to move on his behalf the very fullest information would be necessary, and seeing that all local efforts had apparently been unsuccessful it would be advisable to obtain from Constanti nople, perhaps through Ahmad Pasha az-Zuhair, details of what had passed there with regard to the matter. The Sheikh agreed to try and obtain the further information. 12. Meanwhile this report of the present situation is forwarded with the hope that Government being put in possession of all that is available may be able to re-examine a question which presents a very thorny problem and which will require a solution if the independence of the Ituler of Koweit is to mean anything more than the inaccessibility or freedom of his port from Turkish aggression and, it may be added, if our position in Koweit is to be made secure from incessant Turkish intrigue.DRAFT—(For Approval).

Ihe company were entertained j at a banquet at which the proceedings were enlivened by the iurk- .■ ish band. After the meal Abdul Wahab, the host, made a speech which has been reproduced in a local Arabic newspaper the 'Izhar S el Hakk'. The speaker after congratulating the Ottoman Mation on acquiring freedom and a Constitution, said no people had ever done so without gradually progressing to the attainment of the * highest happiness, glory and prosperity, and he was convinced Turkey would do the same. He then declared that certain dis honest officials in the past, in order to serve their own ends had succeeded in &amp;Kfc 2 tKgi±Rg estranging Sheikh --Obarak Fasha, Caimakam of Koweit from his country and his Government, and went on to eulogise the Sheikh in the following terms:- 'Who is Sheikh Lobarak Pasha es Sabah ? He is the free faith ful and zealous Ottoman now among us. excellencies, we all know him well and I need not detain you with an account of the Sheikh or his family, whose generous qualities have gained notoriety from the books of t idhat Pashaj^, the founder of our freedom, while more recently the Shei 'h himself has become famous for the lavish manner in which he has contributed both money and assist ance, as is attested by the official records of the Government' The speaker concluded his address ' by attesting to the fact I that throughout the course of past events and vicissitudes, the the Sheikh has never vravered or changed in his allegiance and fidelity to the Ottoman Government and nation”, and ended by say ing 'Long life to Sheikh .ubarek and our beloved neighbour, Sardar Arf aghazal H.K.The Rt.Hon'ble Sir G.A.Lowther, K.0. ..G., C.B., &amp;c &amp;c &amp;cKhan 72 Arfa Khazal^ who, although a PerRian by nationality, conducts self like an Ottoman in his acts and contributes both efforts and money to the establishment of peace and good order in our dear native land and that more especially in the time of the present Vali'. The party were then photographed, the Vali in the middle with - Khazal on his right and i. obarak on his left while the speaker, Kar- tass, stood in the foreground with his back to the camera. 1 called a few days a^o on the author of the speech, Abiul ¥ V/ahab el Kartass who quite admitted that he had his tongue in his : &gt;1 cheek when he delivered it. hr.Lyle of hessrs Gray Paukenzie and Go., who visited the Sheikh at Koweit shortly after his trip to Basra, informed me that Mobarak had told him that the Vali still refused to allow the registration of the transfer of the land he had purchased at Fa- daghie unless he took out a certificate of Ottoman nationality. Abdul Vahab Pasha, however, gave me a somewhat different account of the matter. According to him, strict orders have been received from Constantinople not to permit the registration of the transfer to hobarak at all. The reason for this opposition to what is really a very ordinary transaction is, so Abdul u'ahab informs me, that a misconception exists at Constantinople regarding the si tuation of the land to be transferred and that the Ministers be lieve it to occupy an important strategic position commanding Basra, moreover, they do not think Mobarak is buying the land him self but th&amp;t the British Government are financing him in the matter. Abdul V.’ahab says the Vali had sent in very favourable re ports, explaining how erroneous all this is, but he has not suc ceeded in overcoming the opposition of the ftinisters. As regards the question of the nufus teskere, Abdul Wahab told me this matter could easily be got over by the Sheikh putting the land in the name of hir blind son and taking out a certificate of Ottoman na tionality for his in order to satisfy Turkish susceptibilities. 1 informed Your Excellency in a previous despatch that Sheikh -o- barak proposed adopting this course when Lajor i^nox ani I dis- cussS^ matter with him last year at Koweit. 1 do not myself think the Vali is as obligingly disposed to settle the question inin the way the f.heikh suggests as Abdul -'ahab Pasha would have me believe. As the deputy Ah^ed Pasha ee Zobeir, the seller or tbe land, is at Constantinople, he could, no doubt, satisfy the mi nisters as to the position of Fadaghie. 1 think they do not want to let Sheikh Mobarak acquire more ground here for purely poli tical reasons and the Vali, 1 think, is not likely to endeavour to induce them to change their minds as he fully appreciates the anomaly of the Sheikh’s position and loses no opportunity of ha ving a dig at me about the Aoweit question. Your Excellency may have seen a statement in the Frankfurter Zeitung that Ahmed Pasha ^obeir had sold large tracts of land at Basra to tie British Go vernment. An indignant denial of this was published by Zobeir’s ■ th* brother, Abd el Mohsin, president of the Municipality, in the Basra p newspaper ”lzhar el Hakk', but the statement no doubt, refers to the present transaction and cannot but tend to increase the Turk ish suspicions. The Vali, however, practises,the Turkish maxim about being i affable to ones friends and dissimulating with ones enemies and 1 hear Sheikh Mobarak has promised to assist him to get the stone required for his new road by using Koweit boats to bring the ma terial from Muscat, no charge being made for freight but the Vali paying the cost of the labour employed. Whether the Koweit fisher men will approve of this onerous arrangement is another question. In any case the Vali is cultivating good relations with his neigh bours to some purpose and, as long as continues on good terms with the powerful Sheikh of Mohammerah, it is unlikely there will be any armed disturbance in the Vilayet. There have been none of importance this winter* Early last month Falih es Seyhood, who is practically an outlaw, and who seems to have enlisted the good offices of Sheikh Khazal in order to effect a reconciliation with the Vali, came from M oh amine rah where he has been staying, to Basra arid asked for pardon, saying he was ready to pay arrears of taxes due and to give up the rifles of his Arabs to the Turkish Govern ment, to which he expressed his loyalty. The Vali communicated his application to the Minister of the interior but I have not heard with what result. Falih returned to Mohamraerah the Vali having given him to understand that he would be arrested if he re mained here longer than twenty four hours. SheikhSheikh Khazal has on his side reciprocated by maintaining a conciliatory attitude towards the Vali since his arrival and has not opposed the partial destruction of his house property on the Ashar creek road, which is included in the municipal scheme now being carried out by the Vali of widening the road and laying down a tramway to E^asra. Sheikh Khazal f s agent, Mirza Hamza, called on me and made some enquiries as to my own attitude in re gard to the properties of the Bohra and Khoja communities on the road which were being partly pulled down, 1 told Mirza Hamza that 1 had been in correspondence with Constantinople on the subject and H.Embassy saw no reason to interfere with the execution of the Vali’s project and that 1 had received instructions as to the limits within v/hich the Authorities could claim compliance with their designs without payment and the nature of the compensation which could be demanded under the regulations. ^he Sheikh’s agent took note of the date of the I*uilding law and 1 noticed that work was begun on his houses on the following day. 1 have etc., - (signed) F.hi.Grow.r: x v Wo. of 1910.

The account of his trip given by Sheikh Lubarek to Captain sha&amp;espe&amp;r ia very different from that given in Mr. Crow's report. I have furnished Captain Shakoapear with a copy of Mr. Crow's report and asked him to make further enquiries about the matter. It ia, however, sufficiently evident that the Sheikh’s emphatic statement that 'not one word had been broachod on the subject of his properties'* is not in accordance with fact. No doubt, however, the sheikh does not for a moment think that we believe such assurances.7$&gt; 3. It is evident from Ur. Crow's report that the new Vali{' of Busreh is trying to ingratiate himself with Sheikhs iihazal and kubare*. It does not seem desirable from our point of view that the two Chiefs should become too friendly arith His Excel lency and I have asited uis kajesty*s Consul Busreh to be so good as to let me Know if anything further transpires. It is very possible that Bheikh xdiazal finding himself in opposition to the Bakhtyari (and most powerful) element in the Persian Government, may desire to laa^e frionds with the Turks, but it hardly seems likely that Bheikh kubarek being on such friendly terms with Bin Baud could seriously contemplate any arrangement with the Tur&amp;s. In fact it seems possible that Sheikh kubarek is merely trying to throw dust in the eyes of the Vali. 4* It appears that nothing was actually settled regarding the registration of the Fadaghia property, and in fact that no immediate settlement is likely. Any further information re ceived will at once be reported to Government. I have the honour to be Sir, iour most obedient servant, (sd) A.P. Trevor. • . „ v £.ajor.

Sheikh Mubarak said his own men were engaged in their own occupations and there were none he could call on for service of the kind required, far from their homes, but if the Vali wanted Arabs there rveie Nejada Camel-men and the like from Central Arabia to be found in Kuwait ; the Vali said he did not want them, but Shaikh Mubarak’s own people over whom the Shaikh would have a hold, to which the Shaikh replied that he was sorry he could not help for the reasons already given.

I mentioned the rumour to Shaikh Mubarak during recent conversation and he informed me that a paragraph to the above effect had appeared in an Arabic newspaper in Basrah, having apparently been purposely inserted by the Vali, but that the facts were as follows:—The Vali had asked him to supply 20 or 30 men for gendarmerie in Hasa, for whom the Vali would provide a Turkish commander, pay, food, clothing, etc. ; the Shaikh had replied that he could not call on any of his people for such service as they were all engaged in their own vocations, boat-building, fishing, pearl-diving, trading, etc., that if Arabs were required, no doubt Nejada from Central .Arabia could be found in Kuwait, of the class of men who took service with well-to-do people; that the Vali had said he particularly wanted Kuwaitis over whom the Shaikh would have a hold, and to this he had replied regretting that he was unable to assist the Vali. 3, There is, however, a rumour in the town, which I think probably has its source in the newspaper paragraph mentioned above, that not only was a Kuwait detachment to be sent to Hasa but that a Turkish zabit and some men were to be posted to Kuwait. I have had no opportunity of asking the Shaikh regarding the latter, and on the face of it it seems most improbable. ' 1 G. QB. P., Simla.—No. C-1379 F. D. —9-6*10—40—H. C.

The Sheikh added that the question had come up in the Turkish Chamber and the orders of which Ahmed Pasha had informed him were the result. Without further confirmation I cannot help thinking that the last statement is probably embroidery added by the Sheikh himself to enhance his own importance. 3. The current bazaar version of these orders is given in my diary for this week.Extract from Koweit Political Diary, No. iq for the week ending iIth May jgio. 9th May 1910. It is reported that the Wall of Basrah has received telegraphic orders from Constantinople to grant Sheikh Mubarak Turkish registration papers for the Fadaghia and other landed property on the Shatt-el-Arab. The Sheikh has, it is said, received a letter from the Wall informing him of this. It is said the papers vrere refused to the Sheikh until he took Turkish nationality papers, and rumour suggests that he has complied with the demand ; hence the issue of telegraphic orders.

Confidential. u. f. s. to Major Trever. (Dated probably 30th September 1909 received 1/10 A. P. T.) His Majesty’s Consulate, Mohammerah, My dear Shakespear, The following secret information has been given me by Sheikh Atab, a local notable of good standing and for 20 years friendly and indeed intimate with the Consul here. I have no means of testing his authenticity, and send it to you for what it is worth : it may very likely be stale news, or not true. He came today from Failiyah, where he saw the son of the late Sheikh Sahm (Bin Budar) who is now a scribe of Sheikh Mubarek and who has formerly been imprisoned in Busreh by the Turks. This man was said by Mirza Hamza to be planning a movement towards the reunion of Koweit and the Ottoman Empire. Sheikh Mubarek’s son Jabir is said to favour such a move ment. Mirza Hamza also said that there was talk in Busreh to the same effect and that the Turks were thinking of sending an emissary to Sheikh Mubarek with this end in view; he was moreover believed to be not indisposed to consider the question. Yours sincerely, A. T. WILSON. May ?oth, igio. My dear Wilson, I note from the file that on or about 30th September 1909 you wrote to Shakespear, u. f. s. through Trevor, relating some information given you by Sheikh Atab regarding a reported rapprochement between Koweit and the Porte/ Have you heard anything further on the subject since ? You might take an opportunity of sounding Sheikh Atab and let me know result. Your sincerely, P. Z. COX.My dear Colonel Cox, MOHAMMERAH; 25th May igio. Please refer to your demi-official letter of the 19th May, received 24th, regarding Sheikh Mubarek and the Turks. I happen to have seen Sheikh Atab a day or two ago, and he mentioned this topic to me, but had no more to add. The general opinion is that the present Wali has had orders to humour the Sheikh of Koweit and effect a rapprochement. The two are on very friendly terms and certainly the Wall’s behaviour to Mubarek contrasts strongly with his attitude to Sheikh Khaz’al. Yours sincerely, A. T. WILSON. c. c. B.

I have the honour to submit below some details which Sheikh Mubarak communicated to me in the course of a more than usually frank conversation and which, in view of the recent appointment of Nazim Pasha, one of the able leaders of the new r£gm&lt;f in Turkey, to be Viceroy de facto of the three Vilayets of Mosul, Baghdad and Basra, may be of interest to Government. 2. Sheikn Mubarak said that once in a conversation the present Wali of Basra had suggested that the construction of a land telegraph line from Basra or TVT a °u t0 , ^weit wouJd be a great convenience to the place; it would bring Mubarak himself into closer touch with his properties on the river and with the \\a 1 and would afford the Koweit merchants greater facilities in their commercial ea in g s - _ Sheikh told me he had disparaged the idea saying that apart from the initial expense which presumably would fall on the Turkish Government tnere would be constant trouble with the Bedouin, who wo ild certainly be always cutting the wire and harassing the telegraph officials; also there was little chance ° fr em - e * tS * or Koweit had a regular weekly post which SU -? r i 1 ^ 3 nee&lt; ^ s an&lt; ^ rare instances when a telegram was necessary it could easily be sent by post to Bushire and telegraphed thence or even direct to udj • water ' boats ^ways running to and fro thence. He said he thought the Bedouins would be an insuperable obstacle to a land wire whilst a sea cable which was the only way over that difficulty would be enormously expensive and would naturally have to be a British undertaking. He added that the Wali even discussed tfce possibility of connecting A 1 Hassa with Koweit and thence with B a sr a by a land wire and perhaps in the dim future running a line to Riadh and Hajl. I asked the Sheikh if it was possible that the Waff could be speaking seriously of s-uch schemes which he must be aware are at present quite impracti* cable for he has by now experienced at ieast some of the certain opposition of the Bedouin tribes. He said he did not know, but that Suliman Nathif Beo- was a great talker . &amp; 3. Another interesting detail was that the present Wali had dropped addressing the Sheikh as Kaimakam ot Kcweit, the previous practice of Turkish officials in their communications to him, and now he was usually styled “ Rais ” — “ Hakim ” of Koweit. or 4* He also said that the Wali occasionally asked him why he had made himself subject to the English when his real interests were bound up with Turkey. VO 12 0 L . The Sheikh said he replied to this insinuation by explaining that he was not subject to the English Government; there was an old friendship between Koweit and the English from the time of his forefathers, and it was natural when the English had so much to do with the Persian Gulf; kept the peace there between various conflicting interests and safe-guarded the pearl-banks; when most of the trade in the Gulf was English or with Indian ports; when numbers of Koweit vessels traded directly with Bombay and Malabar coast ports; when their officers everywhere in the Gulf and India helped his subjects, as well as those of other Persian Gulf Chiefs, in their difficulties away from home. ^ He was friends with the English as he was with the Wali and other Turkish officials. 5. I give the above for what it is worth, but venture to think that our posi tion in Koweit is probably far more closeW watched now by the new Turkish Government than it ever was before the Constantinople revolution. With refer ence to paragraph 2 above and the Wall’s ideas on telegraphic connection it may be noted here that the Sheikh has more than once asked me why the British Government does not instal a telegraph office here, more particularly a wireless station for the use of the Political Agent. I have always explained that these schemes cost money and the British Government requires that they should pay their expenses; an office only to give the Political Agent better communication was quite impracticable, but if there was a fair prospect of sufficient return for the outlay from public use and the Sheikh himself desired it, no doubt they would consider the project. The subject has never been pursued beyond incidental conversation on the merits of quick communicaiion and it is doubtful whether an office here would pay expenses for a long time after installation. * G.C.

A communication was made by my confidential employe Abdul Aziz el Salem with the Wall of Busreh for the Tapoo documents, and the tfali ordered Abdul Aziz el Balem to go to the place whore the landed property was situated, take surveyors with him and ascertain the area of the land so that it may be recorded in the Tapoo.

Sh aikh Khazal called on me yesterday, &amp; took occasion, as is not uncommon with him now, to discuss his friend Mubarak's action at some length. He sale, that Mubarak, though he went up to Kut el Hi rang go greet the Wali, £ had his private secretHary Abdul /2 iz bin Salim playing round the Wali all the last two days, had failed to achieve his object- the registration of the Hedclaghia lands . ihe Wali had insi r ted on him registering all his sons as Turkish subjects as a preliminary condition. Mubarak offered him his daughters, % Kasir, as a substitute, but the Wali was not satisfied with this. Fow it appears that Mubarak is absolutely fed pp with the 'Turks &amp; says he is not going to have any more to do with them, or see the Wali any more: he will come up the Shatt el Arab as usual but never again bother the Wali. As you know, Mubarak has twice been on board the Turkish vessel the Marmaris, but Shaikh Khazal says that it wil 1 - not recurr The Siizikh expressed some nervousness as to the possibility of -the Turks beginning to annoy Mubarak like they nave been annoying him hims&amp;lf. He emphasized, &amp; told me to tell the Resident, that Ifubarak was simply an Arab, with Arab ideas, &amp; that we must not pay too much attention to his little political games with the 'Turks: it was all his simpliciby. X expect that Mubarak asked him to say a good word .•for* him to us. as he is perhaps a little nervous as to The Shaikh told me that he had good information that, tne g aa dun were getting disorganized, &amp; that Mubarak woula be able to scatter them without firing a shot, same as ikhe Shaikh of Mahommerah did to the people of Hawizeh- vvaibed till dissensions among them had done his work lor him.7 1 No. 1719 (Confidential), dated Bushire, the 26th June (received 4th July) 1910.

XT „ ^ , , _ ment of India a copy of an interesting 0 ‘ 3 ’ ate 151 une ,9I °‘ letter* from the Political Agent at Kuwait in which he discusses the interest evinced by the present Wali of Basrah in matters concerning Kuwait, and the policy to be expected of the new regime of which Nazif Bey’s attitude is undoubtedly an index. Copy of a letter No C,’j6 y {ConfidentialP) dated Kuwait ) the 15th June 1910, from Captain IV. H. /. Shakespear, LA., Political Agent % Kuwait, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to invite a reference to certain items in my diaryf for the current week relating to the reported in- T extract attacnea. * * iiti* c t~^ t • terest ot the present Wall 01 Basrah in matters concerning Kuwait I have referred to the same subject in recent reports dealing with other matters but as further information seems to point to the fact that the question of the exact status of Kuwait as between Turkey and Great Britain before very long will inevitably be forced upon us for some definite solution, I am led to put before you such information as has so far come to my knowledge and brought me to this conclusion. 2. In October 1909 I heard from Muhammerah that Shaikh Mubarak’s Secretary, Abdul Aziz bin Salim bin Badr, was reported to be trying to bring about a closer union between Kuwait and the Turkish Government. I did not credit the report at the time and have had no reason to do so later, for the man himself was imprisoned by the Turks for some considerable time in Basrah and has no particular cause to regard them with affection, though no doubt he might be willing to act as their tool for a substantial consideration. Shaikh Mubarak also trusts him more than any other person of his entourage which I think would be unlikely if he knew or had the slightest reason to suspect him of any intrigue. He is, however, always employed as the Shaikh’s confidential agent in matters at Basrah. 3. In October 1909 the present Wali, Suliman Nathif Bey, arrived at Basrah and at once began to show his mettle by summary orders for the general improve ment of local conditions in Basrah. He also began cultivating Shaikh Mubarak’s friendship most assiduously. Meetings between the Wali and the Shaikh became far more frequent than has been the case with former incumbents; and, wherever possible, the Wali has done his best to attract Mubarak with assistance in matters which closely affect his pocket. The Shaikh in discussing the Wali to me said that though the Wali was always talking about impossible schemes he had undoubtedly done much for Mubarak himself, especially in regard to his properties at Fao where he had put an end to all difficulties in the repairing of his date-garden embankments, encroachments by the Turkish military authorities, etc., by going down himself and issuing the requisite orders in person. He had also obtained from Constantinople the rescission of the suspensory orders which had created so much of the difficulty about his Fadhagiya property. 4. Against these benefits we have the reported proposals of the Wali to connect Kuwait and Basrah by telegraph, to despatch Turkish officers in charge of Kuw'aiti gendarmerie to A 1 Hasa, the Wall’s insistence on the registration of the Shaikh’s sons as Turkish subjects as a preliminary to the legal transfer of his Fadhagiya property, and the latest rumours of a Turkish detachment for Kuwait itself, the offer of official Turkish recognition of Mubarak as respon sible for practically the whole of North-West Arabia, enquiries as to the flag2 the Shaikh flies, etc. Kuwait which formerly scarcely ever figured In Arabic newspapers now finds mention under the heading of Basrah News in the Cairo papers over the signature of the Basrah correspondent. 5. As bearing on this subject it may be of interest to note here that the items in my diary were obtained from a local source but curiously enough were con firmed almost exactly in conversation with M. Toukholka, Russian Consul at Basrah, during his few hours’visit to Kuwait. He said to me that he was much interested in Persian Gulf politics, and having but lately arrived in Basrah, where he constantly heard the position of Kuwait discussed, he was naturally desirous of seeing the place and its ruler, to use his own words “ he had no instructions to pursue any active policy at Basrah for the place did not really affect Russia, and consequently he had very little to do officially. Thus he was afforded the oppor tunity of seeing our position in regard to Kuwait, the Baghdad Railway, Muhammerah and the Persian Gulf generally from the point of view of an inter ested on-looker.” He said he had heard in Basrah that Mubarak used to fly a flag which was exactly similar to the Turkish with the exception that the Kuwait flag carried three white stars but that within the last two years Mubarak at the request of the Wali had reverted to one star! He informed me that his own introduciion from the Wali to Mubarak bore the superscription of ” Kaimmakam of Kuwait,” and that the Wali had frequently mentioned the position of Kuwait in conversation; he had said that the policy of the new Turkey was to maintain the ” status quo, ” which, so far as Kuwait was concerned, he was convinced the ^ Turks regarded as implying distinct subjection to them, and that to prevent the possibility of Kuwait vanishing beyond their hold, as they considered had already happened in the cases of Maskat and Bahrain owing to their own negligence they would probablv make some serious effort to establish in Kuwait an indubitable j visible sign of their predominance. He thought we should have a very difficult question to solve more specially as the new Turkish Government was a vastly different affair to the one to which the Powers had become accustomed under the regime of Abdul Hamid. His own experience in Macedonia and Albania less than six months ago before his appointment to Basrah had shown him the differ- ence very plainly. , ^ at t ^ ie ^ a t Basrah was undoubtedly working for his own coun« try s good and that he was supported whole-heartedly by Nazim Pasha. The latter though styled Wali of Baghdad had been sent out by the Turkish Govern ment with a promise of generous support and had been given a free hand first 10 re-organ,ze thoroughly the Vlth Army Corps, and, when that object had been achieved and an effective weapon been thereby supplied, to consolidate Turkish power in the southern vilayets and amongst the Arabs. _ M.

He gave me the impression of an energetic man really anxious to see things by travelling about himself and inclined to be garrulous as to his own experiences. ° I have reported M. Toukholka’s conversation in to show that in Basrah at least the status of Kuwait among officials. some detail above in order is discussed fairly freely varinni 5 ht lkh Mu a ara ^ himself talks , t0 - me °P en, y of the Wali and his various schemes and makes no secret of his own opinion that the Wali is endea- vourmg to bring about some way of introducing Turkish influence into Kuwait. time rnmn S XS 1 ! 1 ’ Se a .

Extract from the Kuwa it Political Diary No. for the week ending igth June 1910. 14th June. is reported that the Wali of Basrah proposed to send a detachment of Turkish soldiers with 3 officers to be permanently stationed at Kuwait and that Shaikh Mubarak has agreed saying there would be no objection. It is said that the Wali has been making enquiries as to what flag the Shaikh flies, and that he has promised Shaikh Mubarak a Firman giving him the control of Najd Hasa Katar, Katif, etc. ' '4 H.B M CONSULATE, BASRA. 17 1910 Ky dear Shakespear, -our 1 t*;er of M«,y 31.

In reply to your letter No. 1280 of May 22nd last on the subject of the registra,tion of Sheikh Mubarak’s property at P’adaghiya, I have the honour to state that, according to inform ation I have received her©, orders were sent by the sublime Porte to the effect that Sheikh Mubarek may transfer his property in the names of his four sons, as he asked in Moharrem Bey’s time, provided he registers them as Ottoman subjects. I understand Sheikh Mubarek has on many occasions applied to have the land transferred in the names of his sons but that he does not agree to take out Teskeras or Ottoman nationality for them and on his recent visit to Basra on May 31st last, he proposed tp the Vali to transfer the land to one or several of his womenfolk. The Vali however, 1 am told, said he could not do this as it was not in accordance with the instructions he had received, and he suggested that, if Mubarek wanted it done, he should make a fresh application to that effect, which the Wall professed himself willing to forward to Constantinople.1 » No. 1880 (Confidential), dated Bushire, the 10th (received the 18 th) July 1910.

Captain ShakespenrVs present communication seems to me to confuse two hypotheses, or aspects of the question, which need to be distinguished, and to introduce a third which is new to me. (i) The first of these is that the Yali of Basrah is technically and legally correct in his attitude towards the transfer question (as Captain Shakespear suggests in paragraph 6 of his letter No. 35 of 8th June) and is merely interpreting against the public, including Sheikh Mubarak, the provisions of a law of general application in the Basrah Vilayat,—a dead-letter under the old regime but strictly enforced under the new,—which permits of no transfer of landed property in the said Yilayat except on the condition that the acquirer decdares himself to be of Turkish nationality. (ii) The second hypothesis is that the Vali’s attitude is not based on any such law of general application in the Yilayat, but is merely an arbitrary departure from ordinary usage devised in the hope that by throwing Sheikh Mubarak into a state of apprehension lest his bargain should otherwise be upset and himself possibly put to great loss, they will drive him to declare Irmself orhis sons to be of iurkish nationality. (iii) The third and to me new aspect of the question is indicated in para- graph 2 of Captain Sbakospear’s present report, namely, that the .Basrah authorities do not primarily and positively contend that Sheikh Mubarak must, necessarily declare Turkish nationality ; he might declare French, English or any other nationality if he enjoyed it, but that “Kweiti” is no nationality and that for Sheikh Mubarak Turkish nationality alone is indicated. 3 . If the position with which we now have to deal were that indicated in (iii), then it would seem that it might be possible for us to induce the Porte in a friendly way to accept the definition “ Koweiti ” as a nationality for purposes of registration in the case of land-transfers, in order to avoid the raising of awkward issues. A recent report, hov\ever, from Mobammerah seems to indicate that hypothesis (iii) must he eliminated. Lieutenant Wilson writes that the Sheikh of Mohammerah informs him that the lands in Turkish limits which he purchased last year, known as Umm-el-Tuwail ih (an island above Failiyeh) have not yet been registered, the present Yali having refused to permit it, and that the Sheikh has decided to wait on events and let the registration remain in abeyance until he sees what action we are going to take to see Sheikh Mubarak through his present difficulty. It would appear, therefore, that it is either contingency (i) or (ii) with which we have to reckon. In the former case, if we make enquiries from the Porte they will probably reply that their Vali’s action is not directed against Sheikh Mubarak'but is merely the interpretation of existing landdaws appli cable to the Basrah Vilayat; that Sheikh Mubarak is under no obligation to buy property in the Basrah Vilayat, but that, if he does, be must fulfil the same preliminaries and conditions as other persons ; and that unless he complies the transfer cannot be recognised by the'i urkish Courts and so the property must be considered as still belonging to the persons in whose name it has hitherto stood. We should then be confronted with the issue indicated in tlie concluding paragraph of my letter of 19 th June. 4 . If on the other hand the position indicated in (ii) is the one with which we have to deal, the issue is simpler and we seem to have good reasons for objecting on the ground that the invidious treatment of Sheikh Mubarak and thedeparture from past usage involved, constitutes an infringement of the sfahis quo in regard to Koweit affairs which the Porte has undertaken to observe. The Mohammerah report above mentioned, however, seems to point to hypo thesis (i) as the correct one. 5. It goes without saying that I entirely endorse the Political Agent's view that if the main question of the status of Koweit is involved we^have everything to lose by delaying to face the issue, and that the longer we do so, the more difficult will it become to get it settled in the way we desire.

Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Kesidont in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of the correspondence covered by your Second Assistant’s endorsements Nos. 1652 and 1668, dated 21st and 22ud ~ « - i i ' si - ' 7 | V ^ June 1910 respectively. ^ f ^ , , , 2. I would first correct a possible misunderstanding to which the latter p&amp;rt of paragraph 6 of my letter No. C.-35, dated the 8th June 1910, may give ri&gt;e. When I said “ Turkish nationality ” I meant the sentence to apply only to Mubarak and Koweitis for of course other nationalities such as English, Trench, etc., are accepted, hut in the case of Koweitis, the Turkish officials will’ not accept “ Koweit 1 but insist on “ Turkish ” nationality. ^ ^ 3. With reference to your letter No. 165'&gt;, dated 19th June^ 1910, to the Government of Indi i andjespecially to paragraph o thereof, 1 w&lt; u d venture to submit the following observations resulting from a thorough ‘ discussion of the whole subject with His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah In \our letter you ft r see the possible alternative of advisii.g Sheikh Mubarak to re-sell the property and of having to indemnify him for any loss thereon. With ail deference 1 would venture to deprecate any such course and for the following reasons : (o) The Sheikh is certainly alarmed about this property, but at the same time I am inclined to think now he is not improbably exaggera ting that alarm for our special benefit as a means of forcing our hand to free him from Turkish attentions. (6) Mr. Consul Crow considers that the possiblity of the sale being repudiated is an extremely remote one seeing that the sale deeds bear the signatures of most of the notables of Basrah as well as the cachet of the British Consulate. (&lt;?) The property is so large that a buyer would he difficult to find who would purchase it as a single lot and there is besides the grave objection in the advice of a re-sale of an appearance of weakness on ourpart in sustaining the Sheikh’s claim. 4. In my humble opinkpiit would be far more advantageous to maintain the position of our special interests in Koweit, the Sheikh’s long-cOntinued in dependent status, whilst pressing npon the Porte that the recognition of Koweit as a nationality should suffice for the “ Tapu ” Office, i he Porte is, I admit, not likely to agree, but as there seems no immediate risk of the Sheikh losing his property, it would seem worth while to state the 1 above as definin' to some extent what is the actual status quo in Koweit. 5. The question of the status of Koweit must come up before many years, and it seems fairly obvious that the Turkish officials have realised the powerful lever they possess for raising that issue in the registration question, which goes directly to the root of the matter on the point of nationality. The regis tration of any of Mubarak’s family, whether the women or sons, would seem undesirable as likely to admit the principle that Koweit nationality is unrecog nisable as against Turkish. Tor the same reason the taking out of Turkish “ Teskerehs *’ by Koweit subjects is to be deprecated, and though the Sheikh denies it I hear from other sources that many Koweitis with 1 business or land in Basrah have already done this. Under the new order of things this practice is likely to grow and in a few years hence it seems to me there will be far greater difficulty in insisting on the independence of Koweit than is the case at present, and it is for that reason that I would urge that the question should not be avoided.DEMI OFFICIAL Msunommerah.

To His H&amp;oellanoy Mubarok Pasha ol Cubah. A.C. I hope that you will always bo in good health. I bog to inform you that I have learned from persons whom X consider relaiblo that Ahmed Pasha el Zohoir has been convinced by eertain parties to abandon the execution of the settlement ok on the presumption that the value (paid) is less than what is the aorth of the land and that the 'Taah' river fromtage) has not been included in the measurement and such nx nonsense. He has made up his mind to send surveyors to take measurements and if the survey ors are prevented from doing this, they will then turn out the farmers through the Government because he holds Govennment papers and the Government makes the land over to the party holding Govt papers without making a reference to the Courts. A certain friend of his has given him advices -and I think it must have been Abdul Wahhab el Qertas - (stating that) the matter will result in ^ litigation and it is advisable that he should wait and ho will of course receive a letter from Sheikh hubarek to effect a seitle- * ment add that he should write that he has been deceived in the valuation -nd the land is more than the measurement and the •Tash* has not been included in the measurement and that either he should mafte a second measurement with an addition of so much money on every jarib, or, if he did not agree to this course, the land should bo restored to him (Ahmed) and the value to be refunded by instalments in the course of 10 years. This is what his friend hastold him. Ahmed Pasha has kept quiet qccordingly. The object of these devilish temptations is that Abdul Wahhab el Qefctas should intervene in the matter and be benefitted through hfts intervention by (the forsaking of) the bk claim which you have against\ &amp; a^alnat him t in the same way that he was benefittod from the f. S600 Turkish Pounds which was due to you by him, and which he took in lieu of brokerage when you purchased the lands* And Ahmed Pasha will probably not agree even if you pay him a larger amount than the value of the property, and the truth or falseness of this news will become evident to you whenever you wioh to record his statement in the Govt Office for the purpose of taking out documents* This is what was necessary to be stated to you* J.i v V-v • (sd) Abdul Hamid el Glioaibi* \ V P*S* I shall let you know anything fresh that may take place* V ' \(Translation of Enclosure No* 1)• Oopy of a letter received from a Busreh merchant who ia a friend . of mine* Sir* 9 The circumstances add proceedings of the people of Basra are not hidden from you* Not a single man exists amongst them who may possess nobleness* This story is too long and I pray God to improve their condition, because all their proceedings are directed by wordly covetousness* A few days ago Ahmed Pasha el Zoheir xame to our side and met with Seyyid Taleb and Xuouf el Mandi and they convinced him to refuse absolutely the settlement of (the affair) of the el Fadaghia, to nullify the purchase and to refund the money he had received by instalments within fifteen years* In my opinion this is an intrigue of Xusuf and Taleb in these days* Xou may write to Taleb to use his endeavours and speak with Ahmed and also to use his influence with the Vail to effect a settlement of the el Fadaghia and I dl not deem it ad visable that the settlement should be delayed any further* because delay has evils. The doings of the house of Zoheir are well known - to all the World and to yourself* Talbe and Xusuf have been trying for some time past to bring about annoyance between you and the Wall and it appears that they have found a course to do this in connection with the matter which occurred in the vicinity of Zobeir viz the plunder which took place 2 days prior to the Vali f s arrival at our side* Taleb Ahmed and Xuuuf convinced Saadat Bey that all these plunders have been committed by order of Sheikh hubarek and he even wrote you a letter from MslpnB—npm iiohawwalah on this question. The tfali summoned Saadat Bey yesterday and he made the Wall to understand that this plunder had been done by your order and the Vali has eent you a strong telegram because he has a changeable mind and he has not firmness of mind. The clique are determined to create annoyance between you and the Vali and you should know how to reply to him* He believe* that the 4 t Zobeir■ 20 I Zoboir question is a fabrication and the cause which has greatly contributed to his annoyance is that you wrote previously that you wished the el Fadaghi* to be settled in the names of your elder sons and he wrote to the Porte and obtained a reply* bu$ you stated afterwards that you wished the settlement to be made in the name of leaser and your daughters* This is what has disturbed him* O % Hnoyed.

Now in this your letter you have abandoned what you had asked for and requested that the bargain should be made in the names of your son, Naser Bey and his sisters only. This I cannot represent to the Sublime Porte because it is different from your request and it becomes necessary for them to draw their attention to what had been written by Mahram dffendi, and if you desire that a reference should be made to the Sublime Porte you may in that case being forward an argument against that point. It is xx to be regretted that I cannot say anything agdinst my previous statement, accord ing to which I obtained an order from the Jjublime Porte, lou have large properties in these parts and it is possible for you to give orders that those properties should be registered in the names of your son Naser Bey and let the Padaghia bargain to be made as arranged and thus put an end to this question- This is what has crossed my mind, and you will naturally know what is advisable for you.

Under these circumstances I believe that I myself, my sons, my town, my subjects, the inhabitants of Jioweit and my properties are under the protection of the British Government; but as I saw their interference and the intrigues used by them according to reliable information which I have received from my Agent at Busrei and from certain merchants of Busroh who are on friendly terms wil me, I send you herewith, the copies of those informations.

Yesterday evening, the Shaikh requested that I would come and see him as he had received some important news. On arrival, he had read to me a letter from his Basrah Agent as well as some other secret news to the same effect, one Utter being from a man whom I know to be one of the most influential men in Basrah and whose name he begged me to keep absolutely secret. 3. As will be apparent from the Shaikh’s letter and enclosures, there is reason to believe that Ahmad Pasha az Zuhair (who has just returned from Constantinople) is likely to question the sale of the Fadaghia property either on account of inaccurate measurement or inadequate price. Whatever pretext may be used, it seems tairly certain that some method of re-opening the question of the original sale is to be employed, and Shaikh Mubarak will then find himself in the position, already foreseen, of being unable to appear in a Turkish Court of law to uphold his just rights, while the courts or the “ Tapu ” office have the legal power to declare Ahmad Pasha as owner and to give him possession. 4. The Shaikh himself thinks that the course, which Ahmad Pasha is re ported to be contemplating, must undoubtedly have the support of the Vali, if it was not actually suggested by him, in order to force Mubarak into accepting Turkish nationality. Abdul Wahab el Kertas was Ahmad Pasha’s attorney in the sale to Mubarak and the latter then forgave him a debt of ^T.2,500 in return for his good offices as broker, but Abdul Wahab still owes the Shaikh a consider able sum. The Shaikh considers he is no longer to be trusted and that he is quite capable of posing as the friend in need of either party, being governed in his choice solely by the amount he is likely to receive for his services. Ahmad Pasha, if he lias the covert support of the Vali, is hardly likely to resist the temptation of bleeding Mubarak, or, if he objects to that process, of prosecuting a claim for the property, worth it must be remembered some ^*50,000. The preposterous nature of his reported proposal to consider the sale void and to return to Mubarak the purchase price in 10 years gives an idea of what is con templated when it is noted that Mubarak has already long since paid over the full price, been in possession a year and a half, and spent considerable sums in improvements, drainage, buildings, planting, etc., on the property. 5. From other secret letters the Shaikh showed me, it appears that Ahmad Pasha az Zuhair, Yusuf al Mandil and Sayid Talib (son of the Nakib) have realized that by misrepresenting matters to the Vali so as to damage Mubarak they have a very good opportunity of keeping themselves in funds at Mubarak’s expense. These are three of the most influential men in Basrah, two being Parliamentary representatives, and as the Shaikh truly said, the Vali,who is already inclined to credit Mubarak with intriguing with the English, is almost certain to accept the dicta of such prominent men, however impro bable the story may be. The enclosures to the Shaikh’s letter contain evidence that these three men may be acting in concert, both in the matter of delaying or preventing registration of his property, and also in poisoning the acting \ ali’s (Saad Bey’s) mind over the Zobeir incident referred to my in my letter No. C-43, of the 12th July 1910. The Shaikh is justified in his fear, and I think His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah wml confirm my opinion that, should these three prominent men support any improbable story with their collective influence, there is no doubt that the Turkish officials would accept their view, almost without question. 6. The Shaikh was particularly frank with me, because I think he is now more thoroughly alarmed than he has hitherto been. He has held out against all the Yah s persuasion to register his children as Turkish subjects ; the Vali, therefore, though outwardly friendly, is undoubtedly chagrined at his failure : consequently, an atmosphere particularly favourable to the usual methods of 1 urkish intrigue now exists. 7 * 1 did my best to reassure the Shaikh, enjoining him to be especially careful in his dealings with the Vali so as on no account to rouse active hosti- hty* assured me he would not register either himself or his children as 1 urkish subjects without the consent of the British Government but he looked to us to assist him in this present difficulty. au r| e as ^ ec ^ rn y advice as to w'hat course he should pursue in the event of A mad Pasha az Zuhair actually sending men to resume possession of the radaghia property whether accompanied by Turkish officials or without them. 1 replied 1 could hardly advice him without reference to the Resident, but I was | UI j e , ^, . k e .. a . s we ll to warn his fellahin and agent on the estate (Shaikh baleh bin Brahim living at Dora) that on no account should there be any show of force or active hostility. Should an attempt be made to resume possession, fiis agent might endeavour to gam time by treating the intruders hospitably explaining that he^ had no orders from his master and that without them he cou d not leave his charge, whilst requesting them to address the Shaikh direct in the matter. The Shaikh had a letter drafted to this effect at once, and I trust that in the circumstances my action will meet with approval. In view of the Shaikh’s extreme anxiety, I would solicit the favour of ins- structions, for the Shaikh certainly anticipates some such move very shortly. *-*• Since the above was drafted, the Shaikh has sent me a copy of the last communication from the Vali on the subject of this property, of which I nave the honour to enclose a copy with the Shaikh’s own letter. It will be seen that the Vah s offer of assistance differs materially from that described in Mr. “ Crow s letter No. 20, dated the 6th June 1910, to your address.

Firstly, he asked me to beg for the x ension 0 f w j re an( ^ j excusec ] m y se ]f suitable excuses and xp aine t 0 him the disagreement of my subjects (to such a course) and diverted us mm . p]j s only hope depended on the second matter, viz^ the obtaining of or ers o r the settlement of my property, the el Fadaghia, so that he may con vince m e to register it in the names of my elder sons, Jaber, Salem, Naser and ama and take out Turkish papers of nationality; but I asked that it (the property) should be (registered) in the names of my son Naser and his seven sisters who are minors and that he (Naser) should be appointed as their rnT ^ uarc ^ an ^ ecau se he is nearly pious and possesses the noble knowledge (Iheology), and it was my intention to leave him with his sisters in an isolated property. My elder sons possess the property at Fao which is a large one, and which will be sufficient for them. I tried much to convince him but he could not be convinced. . Now there has occurred the intrigue which I feared would take piece in the affair, viz. y that Ahmad Pasha az Zuhair has arrived from Constantinople and learned about my disagreement with the objects of the Vali and the Vali’s annoyance against me for my failure to comply with his objects ; and he has begun to meddle with the affair and to bring about causes, basing his action on the Government Tapu which he has in his possession The local Government also renders him assistance on the strength of the official Government Tapu. My papers being of the ordinary from, are not to be considered as reliable. All these actions are taken by the Vali with the o )ject of frightening me to yield to his demands. I however do not care for their vain action by the good graces of the High Government, and l depend on righteousness and hold reliable docu ments from them and have shown them copies thereof, and they contain the testimonials of all the leading men of Basrah and the British Consul, Mr, Crow. Under these circumstances I believe that 1 myself, my sons, my town, my subjects, the inhabitants of Kuwait and my properties are under the protection of the British Government; but, as I saw their interference and the intrigues used by them according to reliable information which I have received from my Agent at Basrah and from certain merchants of Basrah who are on friendly terms with me, I send you herewith, the copies of those informations. Inshallah, they wall be perused by you and you will endeavour to solve this question a dav sooner (i.e., at an early date). I will not absolutely proceed beyond your opinion, idea and consent, and shall not agree with the Vali in his object as regards the taking of Turkish papers of nationality. In the same way that I am obedient to your orders and consent in refusing to take Turkish papers of nationality, you may safeguard my rights and my property on which I have spent a large sum of money, for making watercoures and burrowing, and also protect me from the dodges. I have described all the facts to you, hoping to receive the assistance of the British Government at the earliest time. Please defend me against vain intrigues and afford me your kind regards. May you ever be preserved. (Translation of Enclosure No. i.) Copy of a letter received from a Basrah merchant who is a friend of mine. Sir, The circumstances and proceedings of the people of Basrah are not hidden from you. Not a single man exists amongst them who may possess nobleness, ihis story is too long and I pray God to improve their condition, because all their proceedings are directed by worldly covetousness. A few days ago Ahmad Pasha az Zuhair came to our side and met with Sayid Talib and Yusuf el Mandi and they convinced him to refuse absolutely the settlement of (the affair) of the el Fadaghia, to nullify the purchase and to refund the money he had received by instalments within fifteen years. In my opinion this is an intrigue of Yusuf and Tahb in these days You may write to Talib to use his endeavours and speak with Ahmad and also to use his influence with the Vali to effect asettlement of the el Fadaghia and I do not deem it advisable that the settlement should be delayed any further, because delay has evils. The doings of the house of Zuhair are well known to all the world and to yourself. Talib and Yusuf have been trying for some time past to bring about annoyance between you and the Vali, and it appears that they have found a course to do this in connection with the matter which occurred in the vicinity of Zobeir, viz., the plunder which took place 2 days prior to the Vali’s arrival at our side, Talib, Ahmad and Yusuf convinced Saadat Bey that all these plunders have been committed by order of Shaikh Mubarak and he even wrote you a letter from Mohawwalah ou this question, The Vali summoned Saadat Bey yesterday and he made the Vali to understand that this plunder had been done by your order, and the Vali has sent you a strong telegram because he has a changeable mind and he has not firmness of mind. The clique are determined to create annoyance between you and the Vali and you should know how to reply to him. He believes that the Zobeir question is a fabrication and the cause which has greatly contributed to his annoyance is that you wrote previously that you wished the el Fadaghia to be settled in the names of your elder sons and he wrote to the Porte and obtained a reply, but you stated afterwards that you wished the settlement to be made in the name of Naser and your daughters. This is what has disturbed him. (Enclosure No. 2.) 4th Jemadi I 1328, 12th June igio. To His Excellency Mubarak-es m Subah Pasha, Kaimmakam {Deputy Governor) of Kuwait. Sir, I have duly received your esteemed letter dated 27th Jemadi I 1328 and I understood what you have stated. I cannot say that it is hidden from you as to what troubles I took to untie the knot formed by His Excellency Mahram Effendi. My hand nails are still feeling the pain, and as a result 1 obtained an irade from the Sublime Porte that the el Fadaghia should be placed in the name of your four sons and you had also requestsd for this. Now, in this your letter you have abandoned what you had asked for and requested that the bargain should be made in the names of your son, Naser Bey and his sisters only. This l cannot represent to the Sublime Porte because it is different from your request, and it becomes necessary for them to draw their attention to what had been written by Mahram Effendi, and if you desire that a reference should be made to the Sublime Porte you may in that case bring forward an argument against that point. It is to be regretted that I cannot say anything against my previous statement, according to which I obtained an order from the Sublime Porte. You have large properties in these parts and it is possible for you to give orders that those properties should be registered in the names of your son, Naser Bey, and let the Fadaghia bargain to be made as arranged and thus put an end to this question. 1 his is what has crossed my mind, and you will naturally know what is advisable for you. Salaams. (Sd.) SULEIMAN NAZIF, Vali of the Province of Basrah. (Enclosure No. 3 .) It is stated that the Vali is annoyed against Shaikh Mubarak because he (the Shaikh) wrote to him (Vali) that he wished to register el Fadaghia in the names of his elder sons and the Vali accordingly wrote to Constantinople and received a reply, and that Shaikh Mubarak has then written to the Vali that he wishes to register it in the names of Naser and certain ladies. Another cause which has contributed to his annoyance is that he has been told that the Bedouins who had plundered the people of Zobeir are the Arabs of the Shaikh/ b / 5 snd that the latter had sent them to do so in consequence of certain proceedings taken by the people ot Zobeir against Shaikh Mubarak. For these reasons the Vali is greatly annoyed. May God improve the situation. It is said that the Vali’s annoyance has been brought about by Ahmad Pasha az-Zuhairwho repudiates the sale and wishes to use certain means which he has m view. (Translation of enclosure No. 4 .) Dated 28th Jemadi II1328, Jth June tgio. To Hts Excellency Mubarak Pasha es Subah. After Compliments.—\ hope that you will always be in good health. I beg to inform you that I have learned from persons whom I consider reliable that Ahmad Pasha az Zuhair has been convinced by certain parties to abandon the execution of the settlement on the presumption that the value (paid) is less than what is the worth of the land and that the &lt;f Tash ” (river frontage) has not been included in the measurement and such nonsense. He has made up his mind to send surveyors to take measurements, and, if the surveyors are prevented from doing this, they will then turn out the farmers through the Government because he holds Government papers, and the Govern ment makes the land over to the party holding Government papers without making a reference to the Courts. A certain friend of his has given him advices —and I think it must have been Abdul Wahab*el-Kertas—(stating that) the matter will result in litigation and it is advisable that he should wait, and he will of course receive a letter from Shaikh Mubarak to effect a settlement and that he should write that he has been deceived in the valuation, and the land is more than the measurement and the “ Tash ” has not been included in the measure ment, and that either he should make a second measurement with an addition of so much money on every jarib, or, if he did not agree to this course, the land should be restored to him (Ahmad) and the value to be refunded by instalments in the course of 10 years. This is what his friend has told him. Ahmad Pasha has kept quiet accordingly. The object of these devilish temptations is that Abdul Wahab-el-Kertas should intervence in the matter and be benefited through his intervention by (the forsaking of) the claim which you have against him, in the same way that he was benefited from the 2,500 Turkish pounds which was due to you by him, and which he took in lieu of brokerage when you purchased the lands. And Ahmad Pasha will probably not agree even if you pay him a larger amount than the value of the property, and the truth or falseness of this news will become evident to you whenever you wish to record his statement in the Government Office for the purpose of taking out documents. This is what was necessary to be stated to you. (Sd.) ABDUL HAMID-EL-SHOAIBI. P. S .—I shall let you know anything fresh that may take place. C. C. B. P , Simla.— No. C 2$66 F. D.— 10-8-10.— 44 - E.

This Sheikh Jasim had seen that similar subscriptions had been got up in Egypt, Jeddah, Beirout and elsewhere, but whether he was requested to raise these subscriptions in Bom bay and Bahrein or whether he did so of his own initiative it is difficult to say. It is believed that he perhaps wished to ba given a Turkish title. 2• Muqbil adh Thakair has been a personal friend of this family 'A1 bin Brahim ,, for many years, and It is almost impossible for an Arab to refuse a request made him by a friend. On receipt of this letter he accordingly ojsoke to Yusuf Kano and Kusaad bin Khalifa, who may be considered as the next twc influential merchants, and both of them promised to subscribe. Other merchants were then called to f uqbil's house and subscriptions were given. Muqbil A few days later/and Yusuf Kano went to Muharraq to patch up a quarrel between two other big merchants, Yusuf Fakhru and Shahin bin Saqar. After settling the points in dispute Muqbil again asked for subscriptions when these two and other merchants of Muharraq also gave according to their means. Muqbil and Yusuf llano also went to Hadd to collect subs criptions • The total collected was about Rs. 12 , 000 /- but it has not7 yet been remitted to Sheikh Jaoim w Al bin BrahiTn”. 3. I ras informed of the movement from its start by Yusuf Kano, who also* gave me the names of the principal subs cribers, but being so certain it has* no political signification in Bahrein ± did not consider details would be of much interest. There were probably 150 subscribers altogether and a partial list is given in the Basrah paper J&gt;‘/y /i &lt; dated the 30th Jamadi ul Awwal, Ho Shiahs subscribed though they would pro- bfebly have done so if they had been asked, 4. 1 would add that Sheikh Jasim became the leader Arab merchant recently on death of his uncle n Abdul Aziz bin Ali A1 Brahim' in iombay, and 1 believe his corresnondence still is continued in the name of this deceased Abdul Aziz. 5. 1 wi&amp;l keep a special look out for any pro Turkish proclivities and will address you again on the subject shortly.No. 2081 (Confidential), dated Bnekire, the 81 st July (received the 8th August) 1910 .

Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gull, Bushire. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of a copy of your letter No 1880 , dated the 10 th July 1910 , and as it s°ems of importance to define clearly the groun ] s of the Turkish insistence on nationality certificates I venture to submit below some observations which I trust will make the various points clearer. Mo _ 2. It will be convenient to separate what the Turkish officials are legally ' entitled to insist upon from what appears to be their present practice :— (!) Hypotheses (i) and (ii) in your letter under reference are both partially correct, for the acquirer of land must declare his nation ality at the time of registering the transfer of the property. For example, an Englishmen acquiring land in Basrah would declare his English nationality and the same would be duly entered in the “ Tapu ” Office registers when the transfer to his name was i applied for. In any subsequent suit regarding his land the fact t of registration in the “Tapu ” Office books would give the Eng lishman the right and opportunity to defend or enforce his rights by appearance in the proper Turkish Court. He would, however, sue or be sued in a manner exactly similar to any Turkish subject, his Consul not having the right to assist him in any way, nor could he plead any rights under the Capitulations. Thus, \ with the transfer recorded, he becomes, for all matters concerning i that land, practically a Turkish subject, though enjoying his own nationality. If he neglects to have the transfer to his own name recorded, ne has no right to appear as a party at all in any Turkish Court. The courts will only, recognize and hear those foreigners in whose names the land actually stands in the “ Tapu ” Office hooks, while Turks, of course, always have the right to appear by virtue of their nationality. This example will show what is the legal position of a foreigner acquiring land in Basrah. ( 2 ) The authorities in Basrah, however, go beyond this legal position and insist on Turkish nationality certificates being produced by all and sundry, under threat of refusing registration of transfer. They rely on the natural ignorance and fear of legal technicalities prevailing among the Arabs and Persians who wish to acquire , land in the Basrah Vilayat as well as their apprehension of losing property already paid for, without a possibility of legal remedy. This belief is sedulously fostered by the authorities amongst the ignorant, but no such preposterous demand is made from an -English, French or other subject who is certain to make enquiries and ascertain the legal position. So successful has the misre presentation been that several wealthy and well educated men connected with Basrah, with whom I have discussed the matter, refused to believe that I could personally acquire land in Basrah and have the transfer registered in the “ Tapu ” Office in my own name without first becoming a Turkish subject myself. 3. In addition to the above, the authorities refuse to admit that Koweitis or indeed any Arabs at all have any separate nationality—they claim that all Arabs, ipso JactOf are the Sultan’s subjects and therefore Turks in nationality. Consequently, in pursuance of the new regime's efforts to consolidate the Turkish Empire, the opportunity is apparently being utilized in the case of the landed classes, (at all events in these outlying provinces), to force an outward and visible sign of Turkish nationality upon Arabs who hitherto have regarded them selves as more or less independent, though owning religious allegiance to the Sultan as the Khalif of Islam. The matter is an intricate one which the general ignorance of even well- educated Arabs, combined with the Sheikh’s tortuous methods, makes none the easier to elucidate, but I trust that I have given its bearings sufficiently clearly above to show that recognition by the Turkish authorities of “ Koweiti ” as a distinct nationality would go far towards a permanent settlement of the present as well as the larger question of the whole status of Koweit./7^.

Since then Ahmed Pasha has returned from Constantinople to Busre^u Sheikh hubarek in a letter wiiich reached me yesterday through the Political Agent encloses some letters xiih from friends in Busreh alleging thit Ahmed Pasha in collusion with intriguers at Busreh intends to repudiate the sale of the Fadaghia property on the grounds among other pretexts, that an inadequate price was paid fot it. Information has. also been received by LIubarek that Ahmed Pasha intends sending surveyors to the property to carry out measurements of the ground and that if interfered with^Mobarek* s cultivators he will receive assistance to eject fhern from Govern ment. It ie believed by the bheikli that fhe it i- tin tali who is putting up this intrigue with a view to coercing him in regard to the registration question. It is possible also that a certain clique in Busreh are devising this means of bleeding the Sheikh now that they see that he is in difficulties with the Walfc. Sheikh Mubarek reiterates his determination under our advice to continue to refuse to register either himself or his sons as Ottoman subjects, but he explains that the subversion of the salo will put him to very great pecuniary loss and urgently repeats his appeal for protection of his interests. In a simultaneous report the Political Agent considers that the Sheikh's apprehen sions regarding.the contemplated repudiation of the sale of the Fadaghia property are well founded and remarks that having regard to the recent bombardment of Zain and theturn the Fadaghia affair is now taking the Sheikh is now thoroughly alarmed. With reference to my telegram No. 6 io dated 7 th June. I shall be glad to be placed in a position to make Sheikh some reassuring communication. : e Cox.Telegram P. To Foreign Simla. No. Jk 2 Dated SOth July 1910, In case of reference from Horned I inform you of following. On July 7th I received a telegram from Consul Bucreh to the effect that according to local report some Arabs from Koweit had last month attached and plundered come Zobair Arabs and that 4 of latter had been killed. Incident was said to be regarded gravely by the Busreh authorities and it was suggested that Mubarek should be advised if report was true kBX to punish offenders and reassmre V/ali. Instructions in sense desired and purport of telegram were telegraphed to Political Agent Ivowei^K He now replies th&amp;t Sheikh nad already informed V/ali that offe dors were a party of Bedouins on their way to raid the Umtair; that they had been fired on out side Zobeir and had retaliated by seizing some donkeys but there had been no casualties. The Sheikh denied cognizance or responsi bility for what had taken place but had used his influence to re cover donkeys and restore them. Shakespear considers that offender do come within category of noweit arabs but that it is improbable that raid was deliberate or comraitifced unprovoked. He adds that Sheikh realises so thoroughly how prejudicial it would be to his interests to anger the Wali needlessly now hat it is extremely unlikely that he was in any way a party to the raid. Sheikh Aubarek complains that same clique who are intriguing in Busreh inregard to Fadaghia question are using present occur rence to increase ill-feeling against Lubarek in the mind of the Wali.1 / / 7 ^) No. 2164 (Confidential), dated Bushire, the 12th (received 22 nd) August 1910 .

From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to the correspondence, regarding Sheikh Mubarak’s affairs on the Shatt-el-Arab and his relations with the Basrah Yali, Suliman Nathif Bey, ending with your Second Assistant’s endorsement No. 1970 , dated the 20 th July 1910 , I have the honour to give below some further information communi cated to me by the Sheikh this morning. 2. The Sheikh said he had recently sent his Secretary Abdul Aziz bin Salim to Basrah at Ahmed Pasha az-Znhair’s request and on his return a day or two ago he related the following account of what passed during his visit. Abdul Aziz met Ahmad Pasha first and the latter after some preliminaries admitted that the Yali had instigated him to impugn Mubarak’s title to the Fadnghia property. Ahmad Pasha had himself remonstrated with the Yali, pointing out the absurdity of repudiating the sale in the face of the sale-deeds held by Mubarak, which bore, besides his own signature, those of all the Basrah notables as well as that of the British Consul. He also objected to compromis ing bis own good name in what from his own side would be a thoroughly bad case. However, the Vali offered to send the Turkish gun-boat “ Marmaris ” to eject Mubarak s men from the Fadaghia gardens by force if they should refuse a hint to leave quietly. In short, the whole of the story already detailed was confirmed categorically by Ahmad Pasha himself as having btten suggested by the Vali who promised his utmost support. Ahmad Pasha apparently valued his own reputation too much to fall in with the Vali’s suggestions, and told the Sheikh s Secretary he would have no hand in any such ignoble scheme. The Sheikh appears to be thoroughly satisfied with the assurance and remarked that he no longer feared Ahmad Pasha making any difficulties over the Fadaghia property. 3 . Subsequently Abdul Aziz saw the Vali, who appears to have opened the interview with a general complaint against Mubarak for putting him in a false position with his superiors in the Turkish Government. On Abdul Aziz’s enquiring how this could be, the Vali said he had telegraphed to Constantinople that Mubarak had agreed to the Fadaghia property being registered in the names of his four sons, who would all take out Turkish Nationality certificates and moreover that two of them would enter the Turkish Army ! Abdul Aziz then appears to have taken the Yali rather severely to task pointing out that he, though himself a Turk and so not likely to minimize any of Mubarak’s acknowledgments, was also the Sheikh’s interpreter (for Turkish) and his Secretary and he never remembered Mubarak ever admitting either verbally or in writing anything which could by any stretch of imagination be construed into the substance of this telegram. The conversation was a long one of much to the same effect and seems to have been not without effect on the Yali, who as the Sheikh graphically described it “ had no word and became completely silent.” Subsequently the Vali appears to have discussed with Abdul Aziz the agreement beween the lurkish and British Governments for the maintenance No. C .-52 (Confidential), dated Koweit, the 3 rd August 1910 .of the statm quo in Koweit, alleging that the British Ambassador in Con stantinople was always urging this plea upon the Turkish Government in any little matter which came up between Koweit and Basrah whilst the British representative in Koweit who must be aware of Mubarak’s raid upon Zobeir made no effort to prevent or dissuade him from harrying Turkish subjects. 4. I am inclined to credit the truth of most of the above for the Sheikh was particularly frank and seemed considerably less anxious than he has been for some time. The conversation described in the last paragraph above would seem to point to some strictures having been passed on Suliman iVathif Bey by the Turkish Government, whether at the instance of His Majesty’s Ambassador or not I am of course not in a position to conjecture. The Sheikh told me some little time ago that he had news from Baghdad that Suliman Nathif Bey was to be transferred from Basrah, being replaced by Fakhri Pasha from Aleppo, and he sincerely hoped the news would prove true A letter which I received from the Political Resident at Baghdad confirmed this rumour, though the latest news from Basrah states that the Yali has given the lie to the report which first reached Basrah in a Baghdad newspaper. 6 . On the score of workable relations between the Sheikh and the Basrah authorities, it is to be hoped that Suliman Nathif Bey will be moved shortly; for, though his energy in making improvements in the Basrah roads and in appre bending vagabonds or bad characters may be laudable, his methods in dealing with powerful chiefs like the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah certainly appear to lack tact, savoir faire and appreciation of their position and will almost as certainly lead to trouble both for Turkish officials and ourselves, if he is permitted to pursue his present irresponsible course.No. 2083 (Confidential), dated Bushire, the 31st July (received 8th August) 1910.

Later news is to the effect that the Shaikh has alluded to these reports in conversation. He corroborates the first rumour but claims to have replied to the Wali that his own local affairs occupied his time fully and that he had no desire to extend his responsibilities. With regard to the second report, Shaikh Mubarak expressed the view that there was nothing in it ; he thought ir. was only the Wali letting his tongue run away with him as he is in the habit of doing. 3.

On 20th July Colonel Cox telegraphed as follows. Begins. Please refer to my letter 1880 of the 10th instant. Ahmed Pasha el Zohair x x 'If x x and would invite reference to my telegram of the 7th ultimo in this connection, rinds. It is not clear whether the action of the Vali in demanding the registration of the Sheikh’s sons as Turkish subjects is merely the strict carrying out of provisions of law of general application in the Basrah vilayet, which had become a dead letter under old regime, or is an arbitrary departure from ordinary usage, adopted in the hope of compelling Sheikh Mubarek to declare himself or his sons to be of Turkish nationality, as part of general policy of more active interference in Koweit affairs. The recent attitude of the Turkish authorities appears to have genuinely alarmed the Sheikh, and we should be glad if the real intentions of the Porte in regard to Sheikh’s Fadaghia property can be ascertained, and if we can be authorised to make to him some reassuring communication. Colonel Cox’s letter 1880 has been sent with Foreign Secre tary's weekly letter by last mail. ISO Last year the Sheikh of Mohammerah purchased some lands above Failiyeh in Turkish limits; the Vali has declined to permit registration and Sheikh khazal is letting the matter drift till he sees what settlement is arrived at in Sheikh Liubarek’s case.H B M CONSULATE, BASRA 4 August 20 1010 Many.thanks for your letter of.the 6th and the extract from your diariea.

From— Lieutenant-Colonkl P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. In continuation of my telegram No. 813 , dated 2 nd September 1910 , I have the honour to submit the result of the enquiries made by the Political Koweit Agency letter No. c.- 65, dated uth sep Agent, Koweit, from Sheikh Mubarak tember 1910. \i y j ^ as to how the registration question in con nection with his properties on the Shatt*el-Arab had been solved in the past. 2 . The present position is recapitulated by Captain Shakespear in the concluding paragraph of his report, and it will be remarked that in the last transaction put through the transfer of part of the Mutawiah property from Uamid-al-Khalid to the Sheikh nationality certificates were insisted on, and the difficulty got over by the acceptance of such certificates by one wife and two concubines of Sheikh Mubarak. 3 . The attitude assumed by the Turkish authorities in this case and in respect of the Fadaghia transaction is not compatible with the position claimed by Mr. Crow and accepted by Vali Suliman Nazif Bey’s predecessor, as set forth in the papers quoted in my telegram of 2nd instant, but in existing circumstances the settlement of the difficulty by the registration of the property in the names of the same three ladies, or the Sheikh’s blind son, seems the simplest solution ; though the fact that the formal good offices of His Majesty’s Embassy should take the form of such a suggestion seems.to me to bear a some what inconvenient aspect in reference to onr attitude upon the question of the status of Koweit, an aspect which the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah may not impossibly regard as indicative of a change of policy on our part. Eor this reason, should the solution of the Fadaghia question assume the above shape, I venture to advise that, in order to maintain a consistent atti tude locally, we inform Sheikh Mubarak that we learn that the Porte are inclined to compromise with him on those lines, and that as his financial interests are so strongly concerned, we do not propose to complicate matters by raising anv objections. &lt;2 ^ ■ No. C .-55 (Confidential), dated the 14 th September 1910 . P f .From— Captaim W. H. I. Shakespear, LA., Political Agent, Koweit, ^o—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, I haveNlie honour to invite a reference to the Government of India’s telegram No. 482 - 8 ., dated the 21 st August 1910 , a copy of which was forward ed to me under your Second Assistant’s endorsement No. 2273 , dated the 23 rd August 1910 . 2 . On my return to Koweit I brought up the subject of his properties on the Shatt-el-Arab in two interviews with the Sheikh. Sheikh Mubarak tells me that originally there were five properties named respectively Kutizain, Gherdilan, Ajerawiya, Fao and Sufieh in the joint possession of the Subah family, and a small one Farhaniya (also known as Dowasir), which has been Mubarak’s in his own separate right from a very long time. The first five were redistributed as the result of the agreement come to between Sheikh Mubarak and his nephews in September 1903 , a copy of which is already on the Residency records. As a result of this agreement Mubarak gave up his interest in the other four estates for the exclusive right to Fao, retaining of course the small separate one of Farhaniya, which was already his own. Thus we have now only to deal with the Fao estate the Facjhaniya estate and the gardens subsequently purchased. 3 . Both the Fao and Farhaniya estates were inherited, and as regards them no demand has ever been made for registration in the “ Tapu ” Office books and they have never been so registered. The Sheikh says his title to these two consists of documents from his forefathers of the nature of testamentary, gift or mutual agreement deeds.4. Prom the end of 1907 to beginning of 1909 he purchased what is now described as the Mutawiah property from Sheikh Sadun of the Muntifich and Abdur Eahman Beg, his brother. The property consisted of two main divisions known as Shaleh and Hizan, but the vendors owned portions in each division. Sheikh Mubarak purchased first Atdur Rahman’s land directly from him, and, no difficulties being made by the Turkish authorities as to nationality certifi cates, had it registered at once in the “ Tapu ” Office books in the names of his four sons. Por various reasons he did not wish to purchase direct from Sheikh Sadun and therefore, though he provided the money, the sale-deed was drawn in the name of Hamid-al-Khalid and the transfer effected to this man’s name in the “ Tapu” Office. This is the same man who was reported by my predeces sor as forced to take out a Turkish nationality certificate to protect himself in his trade*dealings in Basrah. Some time subsequently, the Sheikh saw no use in leaving this land in Hamid-al-Khalid’s name and therefore had fresh sale- deeds made out authenticating a sale from Hamid to himself and had the trans fer duly registered in the “ Tapu ” Office bocks in the names of three of his women-kind (one being the mother of Sheikh Jabir and the other two concu bines;. On this occasion, which I am now told occurred some time last year, the authorities insisted on nationality certificates and accordingly these docu ments were taken out for the three women. 5. There remains only the Padaghia property which consists of portions named Al-Kharam, Al-Bashiya, and Padaghia, but the whole is now always called Padaghia. This property was purchased from Ahmed Pasha az-zuhair’s family and four sale-deeds were executed, all of which were witnessed by most of the notables in Basrah. It was a condition cited in these deeds that the trans fer in the “ Tapu ” Office books should be carried out by the vendor party, the vendee paying all expenses. It is in this case that the Turkish authorities are obstructive by demanding that this property must be registered in the names of the Sheikh’s four sons and that they shall all take out Turkish nationality certificates. 6. To recapitulate, the Sheikh’s properties now consist of— (a) The Pao and Parhaniya estates acquired by inheritance and not re gistered in the “ Tapu ” Office. (&amp;) The Mutawiah property of Shaleh and Hizan acquired by purchase in 1907-08 and duly registered in the “ Tapu ” Office partly in the names of the Sheikh’s four sons, who did not take out nationality certificates, and partly in the names of three of his women, for whom nationality certificates were taken out some time last year. (c) The Padaghiya estates acquired by purchase in 1908-09 and as yet not registered owing to Turkish officials insisting that Sheikh’s four sons should take out nationality papers and the transfer be made to their names.No. Q S y'Yof 1910.

Viscount Morloy is inclined to share the pinion expressed by Sir G. Lowther in his despatch of 6 th July that M it would seem very dangerous for us to interfere in the matter”. But inasmuch as it is important both that the Sheikh should believe in our power to help him and that he should not be induced to commit himself or his successor to Turkey, Kis Lordship would suggest that, if the position at Constantinople is such as to warrant any hope of success, his Majesty T s Ambassador should be instruct ed to use his good offices to secure the registration of the property in the name of the Sheikh’s blind son or of one or more of his women-folk.

The attitude of the Basrah authorities towards this question is another of the factors which combine to bring me to the opinion expressed in my No. 1029, dated.2nd November 1910. telegram that the present position is \ . 1# impossible ’, and Captain Shakespear’s views as expressed in this present communication have my entire concurrence. No. C - 64 , Confidential, dated Koweit. the 25 th October 1910 . From—Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. . I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence regarding Sheikh Mubarak s I adaghia property ending with your Second Assistants endorsement No. 2793, dated the 19th October 1910. 2. As you met the Sheikh at Mohammerah in person no answer is required to the query addressed to me in Captain Crosthwaite’s endorsement No. 2659 dated the 4th October 1910, to which I have not been able to reply earlier owing to the Sheikh’s absence from Koweit. 3. Since his return, however, I have discussed the subject with the Sheikh and it appears that subsequent to his meeting with you and after the despatch of your telegram of the 14th October to the Secretary of State, attachment of the date crop at Eadaghia was actually carried out, a number of Turkish soldiers being posted in the gardens and all shipments stopped. The Sheikh tells me that he then again sent his Secretary to the new Vali pointing out the injustice of the procedure in view of the facts known to all that the property really belonged to Sheikh Mubarak, that he was ready to pay the revenue due, and indeed that though prepared to do so for a long time the offer had been declined by the Turkish authorities. Einally, the ^Sheikh informs ine the revenue was actually accepted and a receipt passed for the amount citing that the “ revenue for the Eadaghia property standing in the name of Ayesha Khanum had been received from the hand of Abdul Aziz bin Salim bin Badr.” The Sheikh seemed pleased with this subterfus-e and said that the attachment was then immediately removed by order of the Vali. 4. It was of very urgent importance that the attachment should be raised as early as possible and the Sheikh may have cause for self-congratulation in having effected it by his own unaided efforts; but it is impossible to avoid the reflection that as a solution of a very important question involving ultimately the whole status of Koweit, it is an exceedingly poor substitute for the recog nition of “ Koweiti ” as a distinct nationality, distinct that is to say from Turkish. The difficulty has been tided over for the present, but the Sheikh is still left exposed to the machinations of the Turkish officials at Basrah and is still unrecognised officially as the rightful owner of the property. 5. In submitting this report, I have the honour to solicit your utmost support in recommending to His Majesty’s Government that no really perma nent solution of the difficulty is possible until at least the recognition of “ Koweiti ” as a distinct and separate nationality has been obtained^from the Turkish Government. The Sheikh again expressed his faith and reliance on British support, but, considering his age and the extent to which his j^atience has already been tried in this far-reaching matter and one which at present also so closely affects his pocket, it is, in my humble opinion, one deserving of the most urgent consideration, if His Majesty’s Government ’still attaches importance to the maintenance of our special position in Koweit and to the possibilities of the port, both commercially and strategically in the near future.

Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Calcutta. Government of India in the Foreign Department, Thinking that it may be of interest, I have the honour to attach a trans lation of an extract from a book published »The Book of Midhat Paaha” by Ali Hyder bin j n Turkish OU the life of Midhat Midhat Pasha, bearing on the question of the status of Kuwait from a Turkish standpoint. The book, of which I give the name in the margin, was lent by the late Vali of Basrah to Shaikh Mubarak for perusal at the time when they were on friendly terms, and the latter had it with him during my last visit to Kuwait and had an extract made of this passage, to which he had alluded in conversation with the Political Agent and myself. u Memorandum on the dependence of the village of Kuwait on the High (Turkish) Government and its annexation to the Province of Basrah. The village of Kuwait is situated on the coast of a part of Nejd and is 70 miles distant from Basrah by sea, consisting of 500 houses. All its inhabitants are Musalmans and w^ere not connected with any party. When the former Vali, Nameq Pasha, intended taking measures in the direction of their protection and annexation to the Province of Basrah, he made it a rule not to subject the inhabitants to any inconveniences, and separated their administration (from others) ; and when he saw that they would pay no tax and customs duty, he left them in their original state. They are originally from Hejaz and came to this place five hundred years ago being accompanied by a section of the Mutheir. Prom their family was Subah the First who founded Kuwait and collected people there until the place was brought to its present state. Their present Shaikh and Headman, Abdullah-es-Subah, is of that descent. All the said inhabitants profess the Shafai religion and the principles of their administration are based on the precepts of the Shera. Their Alem (priests) Kazis (Judges) Muftis (superior Judges) Governors and Teachers are all chosen from amongst themselves, and, as their status has proved advantageous to them since that time, they have continued to remain as an independent community, carrying out their orders by themselves. They have no places for cultivation and their business is confined to maritime trade, and they are familiar with diving operations in the Bahrain and Oman waters. Their boats—both large and small—exceed 2,000, and most of their large vessels make voyages to India and Zanzibar being engaged in maritime trade. This commuuity adopted a peculiar flag for its boats, which in a short time went abroad under that colour for commercial purposes. Some time after they did not feel secure against foreign highhandedness; and in order to ensure tbe safety of their voyages and travels, some of them used the English Flag, while some others flew the Flemish (Dutch) colours, as they felt constrained to hoist those flags. In these circumstances they took measures to associate with and preferred cases for foreign protection, and they were the first who asked for it. Whereas this practice imperilled the Province of Baghdad and whereas great dangers threatened the position of Basrah in particular, Midhat Pasha, who was at Basrah, perceiving those dangers, frv-**- l rwl# i (Ijxjo d-2 summoned their headman, lectured them and explained to them the situation and the dangers, giving them advice and describing the things from which it was necessary for them to abstain. They agreed that he should furnish them with a “ Sanad ” (bond) in which he might assure them of the non-recovery of customs duty and other taxes, and appoint Abdullah-es-Subah to the post of Kaimmakam (Deputy Governor) of Kuwait (stating that) he should remain as the head of the Government of that country and that the Kazis and the Muftis should retain their posts, the administration should be carried on on the old principle and formal orders should be obtained from the Porte to the Authorities (in the above sense) and Hutti Sherifies for the Imams (high priests) of the principal mosques. The requisite formalities were observed for declaring their dependence and they at once discontinued foreign flags and changed them for Ottoman colours. rS.

The telegram stated that the date grove which Mubarak-es-Subah, Pasha, wdshes to purchase and which he wishes to register in the name of his four sons, comprises seven thousand seven hundred and twenty-four Donums and its value is forty-eight thousand odd Turkish Liras ; that the greater part of the value has been paid and the aforesaid Mubarak Pasha wishes to register his four sons in the roll of registered individuals, and wishes, at ter taking out Turkish passports, to settle the registration in their favour, before the formalities for the enlistment for his two sons in the Army are observed. J For this reason, it is not desirable to delay the registration and in view 7 of the reports received the postponement and delay of the registration are inadvis able, and compliance with the request of Mubarak-es-Subah will lead to enhance his sincerity and friendliness. This is what we understand, and the tone of the communications received is favourable to this (course) and it is desirable that compliance should be made in due time. If the said parties are registered in the roll of registered individuals and took out Turkish passports and if two of them underwent enlistment, you should execute the registration of the date grove in the names of his sons. An authority has been given by the Ministry of Interior according to their communication and to the proceed ings of the special committee of deputies (which was formed) in connection with this. And the Vali and the office of registration had been advised as per memorandum to do the needful and to report the result. 1 Office of the Inspector of Registration. Letter No. 7.

This property was likewise found, on inspection, to be in excellent condition, and in no wise dangerous. iho British Consul-ceneral hereupon visited the President of the municipality and protested vigorously against the wanton destruction of property on a false pretext of danger to the public. The conclusion drawn by nis majesty’s Consul-General was and other reports, in which you enumerate repeated instances of the arbitrary and vexatious treatment of British subjects in Asiatic xurAey, and, further, draw my attention to l number of incidents of political aggression, ail tending to thatthat, in tho absence of funds to meet the coot of legal ex propriation, the procedure complained of had been adopted. Notwithstanding that lour Excellency had in the meantime made urgent representations through the i inistar of the In terior, an extensive demolition of ^ossro Lynch's property, including their Chief office, was begun on the 7th /Uigust, and more recently Lis Majesty's Consul-General has reported that the property of liritiah subjects already demolished and threatened means a loss of some £ 5000; while he learns that it is proposed to enforce further expropriations, at groat loss to many jritish subjects resident in Baghdad. on the B9th oeptember lour Excellency reported that British- Inuian property at i.azimia and herbela had likewise been demolish ed, and that the Wall had declined any indemnification on grounds which are wholly unconvincing. i*is majesty's Government must emphatically protest against this procedure; they must further, in view of the fact that it has originated with the i/ali, hold the Ottoman Govemmant them selves responsible for the damage already inflicted, and, after receiving a kx report as to its precise extent from his Majesty's Consul-General, your Excellency should present a detailed claim to the Ottoman Minister for Foreign affairs. Before leaving the question of these expropriations, I think it necessary to advert to tho rumoured intention of the ^fali of Baghdad to cause a new road to be constructed through the middle of the grounds of Lis majesty's Conaulate-aeneral, where as by maxing a slight deviation it might be made to follow an existing road; it is true tliat after lour excellency had made representations to the -ublime rorte, the v/ali asserted to His Majesty's Consul-General that no interference with the Consulate buildings had been in contemplation: I feel constrained to ob serve that the local evidence to fcga the contrary effect is of a conclusive character. Two further cases of unwarrantable interference with British interests^13 intaroate ii.'ive also racontly occurrod at Baghdad in tho first of tiisse oases Messrs Abdul Ali, the British- Indian firm already referred to, were suddenly ordered to sell the ioe manufactured by them at a reduced rate of 10 paras a kilogramme instead of £0 paras an o^e, their usual charge: I understand that owing to non-compliance v/ith this arbitrary order the local authorities have threatened to close by force two ice factories belonging to dritish iridian subjects. In the second case two dritish firms, -.;essrs nloc^ey Cree &lt;i do. and Messrs hlaney and Molomon, vere informed tuat they must transfer their factories to the outskirts of the to^’n, on the ] retext of a regulation 46 years old concerning steamengines and boilers, whereas lour Mxcelloncy has pointed out to me, the factories in question are run by smokeless oil-engines, which are in no respect dangerous. There is clearly, therefore^ no gtaxux ground whatever for the application of the regulation to these factories, ana its enforcement would be wholly un reasonable and very burdensome to th© owners. xour excellency should insist upon satisfaction being accord ed to all these uritish subjects and afford to them the full and effectual protection of his Majesty’s Government, who cannot admit a continhance of the oppression to which th y are being subjected, iou should add that ais majesty’s government cannot be expected to acquiesce in the helplessness expressed by tne Ottoman ^inisfeer for foreign affairs with regard to the illegal proceedings of the Baghdad authorities, and that such helplessness on tiie part of the central authorities amounts to an abdication of government. 1 have already furnished lour excellency with full instructions on the subject of the forcible and unjust intervention of the Ministry of fublic .tforxs and in the dispute which has arisen between the Mmyrna-Aidin Hallway Company ana the Gociete doe Quais: it is matter for graUe conoern to his Majesty’s Government that, apart from this particular incident, the Board of this Companymm. 270 Company aiiould be Gompollod to complain tiiat M for the past t.vo years the attitude of the ministry of Commerce and Public &lt;Vor^s has been increasingly overbearing and harassing', and that they should have claimed tile active protection of nis Majesty's uoverniaent 'not only on account of the im ortant material interests involved in the present case, but also in vie»v of the systematic and continuous attempts which are now being made to encroach on the Company’s rights and privileges as laid down in its Conventions *ith the Imperial Ottoman government”. I pass now to the incidents of political aggression. On the :50th Kay 1909, I informed xour ..excellency that the i’urxs had some time previously occupied the island of ZaKhnuniyeh which lies some 10 miles south-east of ujair; that they had hoist ed the Turkish Flag on a fort, find had arranged to keep a guard there; that the bhaikh of Bahrein nad protested to *.io Majesty’s government against this occupation, his father having built the fort, where he uaea to xcop a garrison fifty years ago; and that the island, which had no permanent inhabitants, had been regularly visited for purposes of fishing, by natives of sahrein• 1 do not propose to enter upon a detailed review of British relations with the chaiidi of danrein anu tne irtiicial Cliiefs, since the matter is one which in no wise concerns the Ottoman Government? X need simply observe tnat tnoae relations have been the founda tion of the maritime peace which has now been maintained in the Persian uulf for well-night a century. Moreover, as tfour Excellency is aware, in i.overaber and December 1871 the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs himself gave assurances that his Government had no intention of attaching or obtaining any supremacy over bahrfcin or the independent tribes on tne coast of the rersian Gulf, and similar assurances iiad already repeatedly been given to iler Majesty’s ambassador at Constantinople• cut apart altogether from the assurances of the Ottoman Go vernment to which I have referred, Ujair, in the district of Ml ivatifia tile moat southerly point which His Hajasty's ifOvernment hive ever recognised as being under Vur/vish in fluence on the coast of the i ersian oulf. in these circumstances lour excellency vas instructed to request the Ottoman uovernment to withdraw the garrison from Za*hnuniyeh on the ground of terminating a disturbance of the status quo; and your representations were to be based not only on the title of the iihaiith of Bahrein to the island, but also on the fact tnat it is situated some distance to the south-east of Ujair, the furthest limit of Ottoman jurisdiction# Although the ottoman minister for /orei^n Affairs informed xour excellency that the garrison had been aithdrawn in June 1909, it has since been reinstated in the island, and, according to the latest reports, has quite recently been reinforced; and the Ottoman authorities in regard to this question seem sot upon disregarding your ^xceHoney 1 s repeared representations on the subject. 1 have accordingly to instruct ¥our excellency to request that orders may be issued for the immediate and permanent with drawal of the garrison# The next point upon which 1 desire to address Your .^xcell- encly is the treatment to which t^o Shaikh of ivoweit has been subjected by buleiinan Hazif Bey, the late wall of uus^orah, with regard to the property which he purchased in the course of last year, from Ahmed Pasha-el-Zoheir at a price of *:T48,000 which was duly paid down# When however bhaiidi ..ubarak took steps to register the transfer at the Turkish Land Office he was informed that he must register himself as a Turkish subject: ouch a demand in reference to a transfer of land had never before been made. iour excellency should inform the liinistsr for Foreign Affairs that his Majesty's uovernment regard the conduct of the late Wall in this matter as an attempt to modify the status quo with regard to ^oweit, which is the basis of the understanding between2 r * bGtwoan iiia kajeBty*a Govarnwent ana the uttomiiji aovernmont in tnis important question. xt .ippoara, moreover, from reliable and circumstantial reports, that the lato Wall tried by tortuous fttiiE mothods to instigate the vendor of the ^edag-iia property to impugn ShaiJch x.ubarajt’s title. Tho vendor rawonatratod with the Wall, pointing out the absurdity of repudiating the sale in tho fice of the title deeds held by the dhalidi, which, b . ides the signature of the vendor, bore those of all the Bu 'dora&amp; notables as well as that of the Jritish Consul. his Majesty’s hovernaent rely upon the Ottoman viovernment to bring about a satisfactory settlement of the registration of tnio property; they have no/ wish to raise difficultios with regard to the past conduct of has an official who has been re called; but X must add that the,incident is vextious and serves to deepen the impression entertained by I; is ha Jo sty * s uovornraonl of ill-will on the part of the xuritish Officials* In his recent dealings with the S aihh of 1. oh ammo rah the conduct of the late Wall of Jusoorah has been in tho hip, est degree violent, xiKaat vindictive and unju t. It is mno.vn to his Aiajosty’s ooverntient from reports re ceived from ilia Majesty’s Consul at Jussorah that thore were no disturbances of importance on the Chatt-el-Arab l ist winte ', that tho Shaikh recently exercised his good offioes in the en deavour to promote a reconciliation betwennthe *'ali and an important arab chief of Turkish nationality, and that the Jhaik] has, in fact, carried his conciliatory at*itude towards Lazif bey so far as to acquiesce, without complaint in the dostructio] of houses belonging to him at Busaorah. It is further known through his Majesty’s Consul at -ohananerah that shaikh khazal has endeavoured to promote friendly relations between Nazif aey and the .Vali of Pusht-i-huh. Much was the situation at the end of ...arch last when the Chaikh and the wall appeared still to be on the best of terms. Shortly afterwards, however, the Wall brought against the Shaikh./-'''X zi?&gt;&gt; t &lt;r°l r l Chaiili, oar tain accusations into the nature of which it is un necessary to enter in detail, since lour Excellency is already familiar with it from the correspondence which has passed on the subject. j*o serious proof of the truth of these accusations was ever offered, nor was any opportunity ever given to the Shaikh to disprove the charges brought against him, which he was perfect ly able and tilling to do. On the contrary, the ;all totally ignored a friendly and conciliatory letter addressed to him by the oneixh, expressing the intention of proceeding to ^ussorah to discuss the matters in dispute, and, further, on the Shaikh^ arrival there on the Idth April, moat unjustifiably -and discour teously refused to receive him at ail. The iihaixh had no alternative but to return to . oharamerah. On the SE4th April the ^ali issued circular instructions to the local officials under his jurisdiction summarily to remove all headmen dependent on the hhaixh, and on the 05th April during the latter's absence at Ahwaz, the iurxish gun-boat M I.;armaris H acting on orders of iiazif hoy, shelled the village of Zain be longing to the ohaikh, which was afterwards looted and destroyed by Turkish soldiers, in the course of t^is attack the house of the onaikh's mother was burnt, and one of his wives died from shock caused by the bombardment• on the 26th April the Wall, in two official letters addressed to the Persian Consul at Bussorah, went so far as to threaten action against ;-ohar.mierah itself in the event of failure to comply with his demcinds. in spite of the injury and provocation w; ich he had received, ohai*h idiuzal continued to bo guided by the advice of Uis Zajestys Government by maintaining a conciliatory attitude, by restraining his agents and supporters from any aggressive action, and by adopting their suggestions with respect to the wording of his communications with the wall. The latter, on the contrary, displayed strong resentment at the attempts made by nis ajostys Consul at *&gt;ussorah, under instructions from uis najesty's Government2 It-- Crovamiaant, to promota an understanding between iiim the Shaikh. iiazif hey, It is true, finally accepted ShaiKh idiazal's explanation and agroed to considor the incident closed, but he unconditionally refused to express regret for the death of the Xjl Shaikh’s wife and the destruction of his mother’s house, or to pay any compensation for tho losses s ffered by the Shaikh in consequence of the unjustifiable bombardment of Zain. Further, at the very moment when he was considering the Shaikh’s explanations with which he o’wned himself satisfied, his Agents ere occupied in subjecting the Zhaikh to further petty annoy ances, in the matter of the renewal, contrary to the Mali’s promise, of the lawsuit against the servant of i.iirza i^araza, the Zhaixh’s Agent at Bussorah, of the unjustified destruction, for the tnird time since tlie dispute between the Jhaikh and the .Yali be^an, of the former’s house property on the ashar Creek and of the raid on hirza Hamza’s gHM house and the seizure of his pro perty, on the ground that he had disregarded a summons for debt which had been issued against him. There can be little doubt that Hazif Bey was the real instigator of these vexatious pro ceedings • A further injustice to the Chaixh has now been committed by registration of land in the vulayet of uusscrah in the name of the Shaikh or his representatives, a measure which appears to be actually contrary to Ottoman law. iour Excellency should bring these facts to the notice of the Turkish Government, and inform them that His majesty’s Government are bound, by agreement with the Shaixh, to use tneir good offices on his behalf in tho event of a dispute with a foreign Power, that they have most carefully considered the circumstances of his recent dispute with the ./ali of Bussorah, and can see no justification whatever for the harsh and aggressive action of the latter, especially in the matter of tho attack on Zain, nor for the recent decree of the Porte re. arding the the decree recently issued by the Bublime Porte forbidding the registrationregistration of land in the vilayet of iiussorah. iou siiould add that, in view of thoir obligations towards the bhaiiUi, they cannot allow tile status quo on the ,.&gt;hatt-el-Arab to be altered to his detriment, and you should express the hope that a satis factory arrangement will be arrived at with the ohalJch, who has displayed anxiety to live on good terms with his neighbours and has shown, throughout recent e/ents, great self-restraint i and patience, in marked contrast - as .uia iajesty’s Government observe with regret - with the attitude of the Turkish authori ties • These occurrences, which individually have been the sxxa cause of painful surprise to ilia Majesty's Government, have produced, in their cumulative effect, an unfavourable impression as to the present attitude of the local Ottoman authorities, - an attitude which appears to be one of hostility and aggression. ^is ..lajeaty's Government cannot believe that this attitude has the approval of the Central Government, o • is based upon their specific instructions. X therefoue have kita xcshkue decided to instruct you to communicate a translation of this despatch to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in order that his excellency may be fully apprised of the views of Hia Majesty’s government and of their causes of complaint: in taxing this step your Ex cellency should explain that his Majesty*s Government nave decided to maxe friendly representations, believing that the Ottoman Government will redress the grievances referred to, for a situa tion of very considerably gravity would of course arise if they proved to be the result of deliberate and unfriendly policy.

This suggestion appears to me to be one that would never be accepted by the present Ottoman Government, with its chauvinis tic tendencies.

It must have been anticipated that the despatch, whenever, com municated, would be made the occasion for anti-British feeling; and the fact that one such explosion has already been manufactur ed in connection with the wholly irrelevant question of the British hote to the Persian Government seems to His Lordship to be rather a reason why His Majesty’s Government should persist in their firm policy. Their object, as Lord Morley understands it, is less to secure an adjustment of the particular incidents in question than to impress upon the Turkish Government in a manner that shall preclude further misunderstanding the importance which they at tach to their interests in those regions and their determination to see that they are respected. The incidents are indeed, in themselves, of varying degrees of magnitude; but their cumulative effect is very considerable, and the force of cur protest is proportionately greater. His Lordship apprehends that this ad vantage will be almost wholly lost, and the probability of His Majesty’s Government attaining their object Jjreatly diminished, if the general protest is long deferred and if His Majesty’s for India Government of Sir E. Grey’s despatch of 17th October. Viscount Morley ventures to suggest that Sir G. Lowther’s AmbassadorAmbassador proceeds by means of piece-meal representations in the meantime , while the policy of financial starvation, re commended as an alternative by Sir G. Lowther, seems no more likely to be successful in Turkey than it has been in Persia. Lord Morley is conscious that there may be other consider ations, lying outside his competence, which outweigh those here suggested.

The Shaikh is taking steps to find out if he can who is responsible for it. TRANSLATION. (Accuracy not guaranteed.) Extract from the newspaper Junub, dated Tehran, the 21st Zil-IIadj 1328, No. 1. (To the Editor) If you want news of this side, thank God, everything is in order. The only thing to be considered is that, owing to the lack of protection and troubles consequent thereon, the people find no other way out of it but to become British subjects. Prom the month of Bajab one thousand and odd Arabs have taken their “ Tazakarah ” (passport or registration certificate) from the British Consul. A few applications from those who have become British subjects have reached the Consul, saying that though they have become British subjects they have no certain means of protection and therefore, solicited some assurance on the subject. Many of those who have turned British subjects or serve the British, Musalmans or non-Musalmans, openly induce other men to become British subjects. Men also for their own comfort try to obtain “ tazakarahs ” for them selves in numbers. Of these, Meshedy Ahmed, Peshkar (Nazir) of Haji Bais-ut-Tujjar has paid Us. 500 to obtain British certificate, but yet he has not been accepted. He got a reply that 80 men should at one time apply for the “ tazakarah ” when they w r ill get the document. He is now trying to pay Rs. 1,000. Those who have obtained the “ tazakarahs ” are endeavouring to create trouble. It is possible that they must have received instructions accordingly (from the British). One of the instances that would have led to trouble was the keeping open of their shops on the day of death of Hazrat Amir (Ali). The “ Hukumat ” (Deputy Governor) sent his men to tell those who had opened their shops to cease their work on that day, lest it should lead to trouble but they sent back the “ Hukumat’s ” men with abuse, and beat one of them. Of those who induce people to become British subjects are Hussein Jamadar and Yusuf. Pirst of those who became British subjects and sold the name and respect of their children w r ere the above two men, though their elders were all in the2 service of the f ‘Hukumat,” and they earned their bread in the Persian land. Because Hussein Jamadar was in the service of the “ Hukumat ” he had the chance of thinking himself over all. This “ Nimak-baharam ” (dishonest man) whose flesh and bones have received their sustenance from Persia has only for the sake of his own freedom gone to “ kafirs ” (those who have no religion) and become their slave, though he was for a great time Deputy Governor at Bander Buzieh, Mashur and Hindijan. This Hussein Jamadar openly in the town and among Arabs and their Shaikhs induces people to his aim. On the 26th Ramazan in (Mohammerah town) Bazaar he paid a visit to son of Haii Arak Khan in the shop of Khudadad clothseller. He said to the youth, “ Your father has under him 4,000 Tufangchis and why should you be such a ‘ Baighairat ’ (shameless creature). With this pomp and money why should you pay 90 per cent, on dates etcetera, and whv should you fear a black (negro) Ghulam of the Sardar (Shaikh of Mohammerah) when you see him Come you and your followers, let us go to the British Consul and I will obtain for you ‘ tazakarah ’ as British subject. Then you will have to pay taxes 10 per cent, and not 90 per cent. When this is done the Sardar (Arfa’) will fear you and not you the Sardar.” The youth replied that he feared he might not be accepted or that the matter might not be approved otherwise that he was much obliged so that he might be freed from unbearable trouble. Hussein Jamadar said, “ Why should you not be accepted ? Do you not know that a few of your own tribe went to the Consulate and under false name of Bahreinis obtained the ‘tazakarah.’ Let us go to the Consul and do you bring with you the names of people of your tribe, and say to^ the Consul that as he has freed many of your tribe from trouble he might do the same in your case and that of the remaining of your tribe and that you will pay everything on account of telegrams etcetera for the purpose. I will take the ‘ tazakarahs ’ for youi: you should be at ease. This V 617 g0od for you es P ecial] y&gt; because Abadan is now the property of the British and you also are a resident of Abadan Island.” _ JS ow the Oil Company, in accordance with a political object, is continuously bringing Indians and Europeans into Arabistan under the pretext that they are employes. They have also an establishment in the Shatt (River) of Bahmanshir. As soon as they get permission to bring steamers in the River then everything is finished. The Agents and Ministers (of Persia) should be delighted to see this because they will have rest then. Sits, there is a copv of a tour history with Saiyid Muhammad Taqi, Agent of Durat*ul-Naiaf Journal which he obtained in Mohammerah and if you will look into it you will find out whether the Company is an Oil Company or a Political Company. The Company s employes are all sepoys, soldiers and officers of the Army' Note the goods which they import and see if they are for oil or for bombs If anv ot you who has a good knowledge of Arabistan comes, and goes into Company’s affairs he will find the actual state of affairs, otherwise you will shortlv hear that the 16,000 miles of Arahistan have become similar to the 400 Islands of Bahrein and surroundings. I lease send an emissary to go into the affairs of the Oil Company and also that of Lynch, which latter Company have acted t ishonestly with the Customs, give trouble to natives and exceed their powers • then you will come to know the facts. H both these firms go beyond their rights the Agent should inform Tehran that arrangements be made to ston them and that the‘‘Hukumat” should also not allow such things Jenab (means Sardar Arfa) gets 5,000 Tomans annually as “commissionery” (?) from the Oil Company not that he gets this amount from the (United Kingdom or its people. For God’s sake enquire from the Minister of Foreign Affairs and tell him that if at any time the Oil Company Z others ask for any fresh rights he should first look at the original Agreements and see what rights he can grant, according to those documents, after full enquipr into their requests from the men of this part of the country or from fwT h ° • kn °' ’ ^ he affairs full y- In the original Agreement it is clearly shewn that foreigners boats or steamers should not ply on the Upper Karan nnrl how is that the Foreign Ministry has allowed the Oil Company to run their steamers on the Upper River. As regards the Shatt of Bahmanshir orders are to the effect that neither Persian nor foreign boats should ply there and how is it that the Oil Company’s steamers work there now, without^ permission.Also why should the Oil Company run a lightning (Motor) Car from Shatt Bahmanshir to Masjid Suleiman which is about 30 farsakhs (105 miles) and travel in two hours the whole distance, though we have no sarhazes, man-o-war or anything of the sort in that part of the country excepting one customs boat. For the sake of your own honour j^lease do not keep this province without your Agent and do not allow the Political Company to go further than what they have done up to now. As regards Braim and Abadan we sent various telegrams (to the effect that the Company should not act without permission), but no attention was paid and the Company have done what they desired. Come and don’t allow the mouth of Shatt Bahmanshir to go into the hands of foreigners, without (the presence of your) emissary. In any case please ask the Ministers or request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to send an Agent or appoint a man, to always remain on the move and inspect the doings of the Oil Company.

From — Captain L. B. Haworth, I.A., His Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah, To— Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to forward herewith, for your informatioiarf copies of despatches, dated 28th December 1910 and 6th January 1911, respectively, and accompaniments from the Embassy, Constantinople, to His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, respecting the policy of the Committee of Union and Progress with regard to Mesopotamia. A copy has also been sent direct to the Political Agent, Kuwait. Translation of apart of an article on Basrah by Ismail Hakkt, Deputy for Baghdad, which appeared in the Tanin of 26th December 1910. In these parts there is no place so unhealthy and at the same time so important both commercially and politically as Basrah. Whatever may be said to the contrary, the political balance of Irak has shifted to Basrah during the last thirty years. At Ashar the first thing that strikes the eye is five or six fairly big steamers, but all fly the English flag. At whatever part of Basrah you look, a thousand different things connected with England will immediately strike your attention, and you will feel how deep the claws of English influence have sunk into our country’s flesh. The very hammals (street porters) adapt to their own dialect the naval and other technical terms which have been arabi- cised from the English, and decline and conjugate them. (Through ?) Though Shaikh Khazal, who holds sway in the part of Persia which extends from Kuwait and Mohammerah to the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, England is practically squeezing the sandjak of Basrah with a hand of iron, and by exercising an unceasing pressure, she is striving to catch it in a fowler’s net. To such an extent (according to a rumour which I have not been able to thoroughly examine) that she has even begun to confer British nationality or protection upon tribes both in the Mohammerah district at Ibade {sic.) for instance and in the Basrah district. As her influence is stronger in Persian territory, the rumour is of more weight for that part. In either case the harm to the Ottoman empire is evident; for the protected tribes on the further side of the Shatt-el-Arab both can, and continually do, pass over to the Ottoman side and under the encouragement of the protection they have obtained give rise to all sorts of difficulties.

I am directed by His Majesty’s Chargd d’Affaires to transmit to you here with copy of a despatch which he has addressed to His Majesty’s Principal Foreign office No. is, dated the 4 tii January 1911. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs respecting the policy of the Committee of Union and Progress with regard to Mesopotamia. Mr. Marling requests you to inform His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah of the contents of this despatch. No. 15, dated Constantinople, the 4th January 1911. From—C. Marling, To—The Right Hon'ble Sir E. Grey, etc., etc., etc. I have the honour to enclose translation of two articles recently published in the Tanin by Ismail Hakki Bey, Deputy for Baghdad, giving his views as to the policy Young Turkey should pursue in Mesopotamia. One of Ismail Hakki’s brothers, Hamdi Bey, resides at Baghdad and is one of the leaders pf the local branch of the Committee, while a second brother, Hikmet Bey, is on the staff of Beouf Pasha, the Ottoman Commissioner in Egyph He is one of the Committee’s “ experts ” on foreign affairs and their specialist on matters connected with the Arabian peninsular, Egypt, etc. Last year he was at one time the Committee candidate for the Ministry for Foreign Affairs but, perhaps fortunately for Young Turkey, has not yet been appointed to that post. His ideas, as shown in these two articles, are both crude and violent. He advocates disarmament on the same lines as in Albania, Macedonia and Syria, the prevention of arms smuggling by sending Turkish ships to the Persian Gulf and the “ cutting off ” of the poisonous trade by putting an end once and for all to the seditious existence of Kuwait or by at least blockading it by land and sea. ” The first of the latter two alternatives would seem to mean that Turkey should militarily occupy Kuwait by a coup de main. Ismail Hakki Bey and his friends are no doubt animated by the best of intentions but past experience of Albania, Macedonia, and the Hauran leads us to expect they will act with haste, rigour and violence. The inevitable result will be a disaffected Arab population and, as it is well to lay the blame anywhere except in the proper place, that is, the wrong policy of the Committee of Union and Progress, their disaffection is to be set down to English intrigues and machinations aimed at transferring the Caliphate to some Arab centre under British influence. The Committee imitating the French revolution in its hunting down and destruction of aristocrats, evidently intends meting out a similar treatment to the Arab Shaikhs. Ismail Hakki Bey would “ punish the principal Shaikhs on the spot ” probably by court martialling and hanging some of them, would exile in virtue of the arbitrary decisions of secret courts-martial, the bulk of the Shaikhs of the second degree, and would reduce the small Shaikhs to the position of headman and the tribesmen to that of Egyptian fellaheen. By applying the military steamroller he would complete the levelling down process within a year, so as to defeat the fell designs of foreigners, who have interests in Mesopotamia and are looking on it “ with hungry eyes. ” Ismail Hakki Bey further talks of the “ Political meaning impossible to conceal in the importation into Arak of so many arms of English manufacture, ” but con veniently ignores that the distributing centres are Jibuti and Maskat rather than Kuwait, that England has gone to enormous trouble and expenditure to stop the arms traffic and that she even risked a conflict with France in her attempt to check arms running at Maskat, while he has evidently little notion of the extreme difficulty of preventing smuggling along the El Hassa coast line not to mention the Shatt-el-Arab, Khor Abdullah, etc. The frequent mentions of “English, Englishmen and English arms” are calculated to poison the minds of the Turkish public and to convey the impression of Great Britain’s hostile designs on Mesopotamia. He is evidently desirous of focussing public attention on Kuwait and Mohammerah. His account of, and the inferences he draws from, the encounter between the forces of Shaikh Mubarak and SadunPasha may be described as fantastic. That the result of his propaganda on the subject of Kuwait has been effective is shown by the Grand Vizir’s remarks on that question to Sir Henry Babington Smith and there seems little doubt that he and his committee friends intend creating a “ Kuwait question. ” Hakki Pasha’s remark that “ articles in the press must not betaken too seriously ^ cannot itself be taken too seriously. For Ismail Hakki Bey’s articles have been published with the consent and approval of Hussein Jahid Bey, Djavid Bey, Minister of Finance and other such, whose influence under a Committee Government is greater than that of the Grand Vizir. Ismail Hakki Bey’s remarks about Mohammerah are interesting and instructive as shewing the Committee point of view in such matters. He would induce Young Persia to allow Young Turkey to despatch troops to punish and “ level ” Shaikh Khazal, the “ rebel against Persia. ” The value of his assur ance that the Turkish Troops would not remain at Mohammerah may be guaged by the prolonged stay of the Ottoman forces that years ago occupied Passova and other districts in the neighbourhood of Urumia. His plan of “ extirpating all the Shaikh’s interests ” in the Basrah region of seizing his property and repressing his agents with the greatest severity, while Persia will not protest and England cannot, opens up a very unpleasant vista of rather serious friction between us and the committee Government of Young Turkey. I am sending copies of this despatch and its enclosures to His Majesty’s Consular Officers at Baghdad and Basrah, with instructions to the latter to inform His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah of its contents. I have, etc., C. MARLING. Inclosure in Mr. Marling's despatch to Foreign Office No. 15 of 4th January 1910. The Tanin of December 24th contains a long article by Ismail Hakki Deputy for Baghdad, on the “ Causes of Unrest in Irak.” After speaking of the manner in which that part of the Empire w^as neglected for centuries, and of the venality of the officials wffiose sole aim was to fill their own pockets, he continues. It was not only through the weakness of the army and the confusion prevailing in the Government that the tribes became so daring. The uninterrupted importation of arms from Kuwait reinforced them and increased their boldness. The erroneous, self-seeking policy adopted by most of the Valis of Basrah under the old regime not only caused a blaze in Irak, but also set fire to the Kuwait question, which tends to disturb even our foreign relations, and the terrible effects of which have increased daily during the last seven or eight years. The first thing to do is to strengthen the army, a step wffiich is now being taken. Not only must the VI Army corps be kept there permanently, but we ought also to send there a well organised punitive force. Again, as all the brigands have gathered along the banks of the rivers it is essential that armoured gunboats should be sent, both to keep order on the rivers and to transport troops. For a long time our expeditions have attacked loyal tribes, while brigands have been allowed to return to their tribes. Justice and policy demand that punishment should be meted out to the real offenders; for innocent tribes, seeing they are punished anyhow, take to brigandage v r ken opportunity offers. Arms must be collected and the arms traffic stopped ; but this policy must be applied to all the tribes, or its effect will be nil. Many of the tribes are 3019 f. D.willing to give up their arms, if the Government will protect their lives, property and rights but as long as their neighbours are armed they are compelled to carry weapons in self-defence. “ To prevent the importation of arms our ships must always he present to stop smuggling in the Gulf of Basrah, and the poisonous trade must be cut off either by putting an end altogether to the rebellious life of Kuwait or by at least blockading it by sea and land.” It goes without saying that as all these measures do not come within the scope of the existing laws, martial law ought to be proclaimed in a few sanjaks which are hot beds of sedition. But let me not be misunderstood. There is no comparison possible between town life and the life of the Bedawin in Irak. The town populations are quiet and obedient and can be governed by the ordinary laws, but the tribes are beyond the application of say the Criminal Code. It would be mistaken policy to proclaim martial law unnecessarily in the towns for it would irritate the very people whose hearts we need to win whereas the town folk are strongly in favour of the severe punishment of the tribes. If there is any opposition to the proposal for military expeditions I would repeat that the present state of affairs cannot go on, In winter Irak is more favourable to military movements than Anatolia, In a year the VI Army corps will be able to carry out its punitive duty but then it will be too late* for in that one year there may occur events so terrible that not a centurv will ’ suffice to obliterate their effects. The moral and economic importance of the Hauran to the Empire cannot be compared with that of Irak. In the first place there is political meaning impossible to conceal in the importation into Irak of so many arms of English manufacture, secondly a continuous influence is exercised from the Persian Gulf to Irak by way of the Tigris and Euphrates. It is true that there is freedom of trade but let us think of the political effects for people, who are watching their opportunity of attacks made on the life and property of a friendly Government in the course of freedom of trade. A few months ago an English engineer travelling by way of the Tigris to Hindiewas stopped by a brigandand ordered to pay toll. He had nothing less than a Turkish lira and the brigand had no change but the latter—honest fellow—gave the Englishman thirty or forty bullets as change with the advice that they should be shown to Nazim Pasha. E ow it may be that not every Englishman or every engineer passing that way will be as well acquainted with the local custom. Perhaps he will say “ what is this toll ? I shan’t pay ” and will eventually “ eat ” a bullet, I do not wish to speak here of the diplomatic difficulties which might arise from the difficulty experienced in punishing the murderer. As to the financial side of the question let me only say that, however much the expedition costs, it will, if successful, pay for itself many times over in regular payment of taxes, etc. In order that the punishments may have proper effect the measures taken must be fixed and adapted to individuals. With regard to the Shaikhs who are as influential as princes or as an Indian It a j ah, when the worst have been punished on the spot, the minor offenders, when their past crimes have been brought to light by courts martial, might perhaps be sent with honour to one of the islands in the Mediterranean. Shaikhs of the second degree mio-ht receive a lighter punishment; for instance it should suffice to prevent their returning to Irak for a certain length of time. As to the small Shaikhs, they will naturally sink to the level of a small Government official, to that of a moukhtar. The tribes are accustomed to rally round great names and every Shaikh of note is the centre of attraction. Now this attraction must be broken for the sake of the salvation of the Empire. There used to be tribes and Shaikhs in Egypt; now there are only fellahin. In Irak too w^e must put an end to the present system and leave only fellahin. 1 If the policy pursued by the old regime is continued rest assured that we shall lose Irak which is in a worse state than the Yemen, for foreigners who have interests there are looking on Irak with hungry eyes.The following is a very slightly abridged translation of an article by Ismail Hakki, Deputy for Baghdad, which appeared in the Tanin of 28th December 1910. The Political Importance of Basdah, Kuwait and Mohammerah. At present there is no order in Basrah, in the sense in which a civilised person understands the word “ order.” The state of affairs which had gone on for years has been changed for a few months by the zeal of the strong hand of discipline, but if the administration of Basrah goes on as at present, and if a few wasps’ nests which surround the neighbourhood and are extending their poisonous influence to Basrah itself, are not completely destroyed, the brigand age in and around the town will continue until stopped by the firm and ruth less hand of a foreigner. The few months of discipline and order which we have spoken of with praise and thankfulness are only a temporary and superficial expedient against a chronic disease. If we seek the seat of the trouble which will destroy Basrah, we shall find it limited chiefly to two spots—Kuwait and Mohammerah. There is no writer on international law who could define the political position of Kuwait. Officially it is a Caza and the Shaikh, Mubarak es Sabah, bears a purely Ottoman title—that of Pasha, and at present he flies the Ottoman flag as a sign of allegiance, but there is nevertheless a doubt as to his position in practice. Until seven or eight years ago Kuwait had been Ottoman without doubt or fraud : but pressure was brought to bear upon it by a covetous Commandant and it took refuge with the English, and the correspondence with the Subiime Porte—for what reason we know not—carried on with England gave rise to an embarrassing situation. Now Kmvait from our point of view is Ottoman territory without doubt, but in consequence of that correspondence the Ottoman troops who were intended to inflict the necessary punishment did not enter Kuwait, and the question of letting troops enter it remained in abeyance. Finally, Mubarek es Sabah and his subjects being Sunnis, he is in a position which w ould not allow him to fly the British flag even if he wanted to do so. He lives in a constant state of fear, owing to the fact that be killed his brother and usurped the position of Shaikh. The Shaikh has a good deal of property, a large part of which is in the sandjak of Basrah and this gives the Ottoman Government a powerful weapon to bring pressure to bear on him whenever necessary in order to get its words harkened to and its objects fulfilled. Having realised this the Shaikh recently evinced the loyal desire to take out certificates of Ottoman nationality for himself and his sons ; hut owung to his own fickleness and to the encouragement of the British Consul at Kuwait he changed his mind and simply made the strange proposal to take out certificates of Ottoman nationality for his daughters. Now as to the influence of Mubarak es Sabah (who has now r become a millionaire) upon the internal state of our country. As I have said before the sole dep6t of prohibited arms in Irak is Kuwait. Moreover Mubarak Pasha—as is usual in ignorant countries—follows a double faced policy; in order to show loyalty to England also he is not content with merely importing rifles and cartridges into the country, but with the object of showing that he is capable by himself of chastising all the tribes he sets currents flowing towards the interior and kills and robs men of the most important tribes. Last year this man, having collected from all sides a force of four thousand horsemen and more than ten thousand Arabs, attacked Sadun Pasha and his men ; but rumour says that Sadun Pasha, with about four thousand men of the Montific and az-Zafir tribes whom he had managed to get together, killed some four thousand of the enemy and put them to flight. It is wmrth noting that at that very moment an English officer appeared, photographed the slain and took pictures of the battle field. Humour adds that Mubarak subsequently tried to make out to the English that this rout w T as a complete victory but, owing to the evidence of the British officer, the English avoided being deceived (“ responsibility relies on him who relates”). On gaining this victory Sadun Pasha and his subjects w’ent as far as Kuwait and wanted to plunder Mubarek’s goods and treasure; but accordingto his own account he gave up the project in order not to involve the Govern ment in political difficulties. Nevertheless the men of Mubarek finding the as-Zaffir tribe alone three or four months ago, revenged themselves by seizing several thousands of their camels and withdrew. The tribes attacked and plundered are gathered under Ottoman allegiance and those who attack them also fly the Ottoman flag. (Whereas a three star Ottoman flag had previously waved over Kuwait, a flag with one star has recently begun to be used. Mubarek used to explain his use of three stars as a sign of his extraordinary affection for Yildiz “a star” and “ Ottomanism. ”) The duty of the Government therefore is to take the due of the oppressed from the oppressor and to punish the party which disturb peace and order. As to the attitude of England, we would ask whether it is just that our hands should be tried in the fulfilment of these duties. Even if, to suppose the impossible, Kuwait is not ours, what Government is there which would allow a neighbouring State to bring 16,' 00 troops into her territory and to steal the property of half her subjects ? The English Government has taken up the attitude of preventing us from exercising the right of punishment in our lands : could she wink at such a tax made in her territory or in a neighbouring place ? Kuwait is not English (and God forbid it ever should be) so we cannot ask England to punish the Shaikh. Are these acts of brigandage to remain for ever unpunished ? Is a petty Shaikh to have an authority which not even the greatest Emperors possess in our time ? To protect and defend murder, robbery and plunder ill becomes a civilized, constitutional country like England : so we pass over the matter, attributing it to lack of information on the part of the Central British Government or to the excessive zeal of the local British officials. There is another point. Our tribes who suffer these attacks will try, in Arab fashion, to take their revenge to-morrow or the next day and will surround Kuwait and put pressure upon it. Sadun Pasha told me this himself but added that he had postponed the execution of this project in obedience to the Govern ment’s orders. What diplomatic result will this inevitable and reasonable attack have ? Will the British Foreign Office be able to object if an oppressor not under their protection falls in the process of retaliation into the pit he dug himself ? The Foreign Office ought to think of this now ; it is essential to have recourse to diplomatic means in time in order not to be confronted with a fait accompli. The Mohammerah question is of a quite different nature and form. Here we are in the presence of one who is openly a Persian subject. About 10 years ago the person now called Shaikh Khazal -was of no importance, all the power was in the hands of his brother Shaikh Mizal, who, knowing the tyranny and trickery of his brother, did not favour him at all. Angry at this, Khazal took refuge with a slave named Sultan, making himself out to be in danger and begging to be saved, and Sultan put an end to Mizal’s life with a bullet. The dead man’s supporters dispersed and Shaikh Khazal reigned alone. It is curious that, although a murderer cannot inherit from his victim, all the deceased’s lands in Ottoman territory were transferred to the new Shaikh, i.e. y to the murderer. It is true that as the murder took place in foreign territory the murderer’s guilt is not legally established in the eyes of the Ottoman Government but the question raises a very subtle point in private in ternational law. Anyhow, since that time this Shaikh has increased his power and influence daily. On the other hand, as he knows in his con science that he is guilty of murder he has rasied the slave Sultan to a position of trust, and is compelled to surround himself with guards. He goes now here without having 40 or 50 armed men with him. His castles and lands in Basrah too are veiy numerous. During the old regime, and for a while under the new, his representative in Basrah had almost as much influence as an Ambassador. Most of the Yalis became the Shaikh’s faithful friends and as for the officials he gained some with money and some by threats, so that there is not a whisper in Basrah to-day which does not reach Khaz’al’s ears at once. On this account an extraordinary terror reigns in Basrah. No one dares to speak of the Shaikh’s misdeeds in any public place for there are many of the Shaikh’s spies about who carry the news tohim. And woe to him who has spoken against the Shaikh. For in Basrah the Shaikh has bands of men and very trusted men, to whom he pays 70 or 80 pounds a month and if these men cannot manage to tear the offenders in pieces in the streets at night, they bring about his ruin in a very short time by means of all sorts of calumny, false wit nesses and reports. Against these attacks the Valis themselves are impotent. It is a matter of common knowledge that those who made Basrah a sort of prison for the last Vali were men who were taking revenge on behalf of Shaikh Khazal because the Vali had taken certain measures, not against the Shaikh but against his men ; upon which the Shaikh’s creatures in Basrah laid a thousand different plots and caused a great difference to arise between the military and gendarmarie on one side, and the Vilayet and civil authorities on the other. The political and international position of the Shaikh is gradually taking on another aspect. Recently he went into the interior to punish certain rebellious tribes, and rumour says that he is going to come to blows with a branch of the famous Bakhtiaris. If he wins, his influence will increase still more ; if he is beaten, it is anticipated that great political difficulties will arise, for the British Government has taken the Shaikh—if not officially, at least privately—under its protection. I have seen with my own eyes a private communication from the British Consul at Basrah in which he says : “ as you are aware, from events in Persia, the Shaikh of Mohammerah is under British protection whereas in our eyes Shaikh Rhazal and his tribes are Persian subjects and it would naturally be unpermissible for either ourselves or Persia to allow any act or circumstance which might disturb the status quo. It is strongly suspected that if Shaikh Khazal were defeated England would openly declare a protectorate over the Shaikh of Mohammerah and even actually take 07er the policing of the whole of Shiraz and Persian Arabia urging lack of security and danger to her commerce as an excuse. When Russia has established troops in the North of Persia on the pretext of restoring order it will of course be impossible for England to remain with arms folded in the South. As an instance of the increasing favour shewn by England to the Shaikh we may note the fact that last week he was given the order of the K.C.SI. with the attendant ceremonial and pomp. A Major belonging to the British army was especially sent with this order, and the Shaikh, acting exactly like a Rajah, gave the order a salute of guns. The results of this state of affairs fall on us with a terrible shower. In our opinion none of these acts of protection is official. If once we hear that they are official, we must protest with all our might and prevent them by all possible means. Persia has been divided, it is true, into English and Russian spheres of influence, but both parties have undertaken to safeguard the terri torial integrity of Persia. Now a declaration of protection and an act of interference in the interna? order of Persia would be diametrically opposed to the maintenance of its territorial integrity. In the second place the Gulf of Persia and the Shiraz and Hamadan districts were considered as a neutral zone when the division into spheres of influence took place and the effect of the Anglo Russian agree ment on those parts must be considered nil; so that in acting in that fashion the British Government would be acting contrary to agreement, not only towards Turkey, Persia and the other powers, but also with regard to Russia. Thirdly, the Anglo-Russian agreement was not confirmed by Persia or any other interested power, and was not communicated, I think, to the Ottoman Government; so that from our point of view it is officially non-existent. Therefore, the question of safeguarding those Ottoman rights which are injured at Mohammerah and of extinguishing the fire of revolt which runs in an unceasing stream from Mohammerah into Ottoman territory is a private matter between the Ottoman and Persian Governments. The Russian Government’s confirmation of the clause in the agreement by which British rights in the Persian Gulf are to be safeguarded cannot affect any third party — cannot therefore bind the Ottoman Government and the safeguarding*^ of British rights cannot possibly mean the trampling under foot of Ottoman10 TV hat steps must the Ottoman Government take to punish this Persian neighbour of hers ? There are only two alternatives; either for Ottoman troops to go and put out the fire or for us to take such defensive measures '-that when the fire comes it may not burn our land. This needs official diplomatic negotiations with the Persian Government. That Government ought to consent to our troops going and punishing a man who is a rebel against Persia too, and to our presenting Persia with a quiet, submissive country free from all traces of tyranny and brigandage. We should do this not merely out of friendship for Persia but to ensure our internal peace and order, so we should not expect Persia to be grateful. But will Persian diplomatists be able to show sufficient patriotic daring as to consent to such a fait accompli ? Let them rest assured that our troops have not such habits as not to leave the place they have entered. When we have given our word we will keep it. If this measure, which would probably be exposed to diplomatic difficulties, cannot be carried out, then we must have recourse to the second scheme—the defensive. First of all, all the Shaikh’s interests must be extirpated, and as “ property is a part of life ” his lands, property and goods must be seized and all his men, however high their social position, must be followed up and repressed with the greatest severity. The Persian Government is not so wanting in skill and political knowledge as to complain on behalf of a Shaikh who, from its own point of view, is deserving of punishment: and as for England, she has no official legal standing to warrant her opening her mouth to attack us for repressing the Shaikh’s followers. No attention has ever been paid to the communications in the form of “advice” made to us by the British Consul on behalf of the Shaikh’s men, and the Consul has been told that such communication rested on no right or authority. On the other hand, in order that our rights of sovereignty should be manifest on the Shatt-el-Arab, and that those men, of whom half belong to the Shaikh, should be prevented from flowing over to the Ottoman side of the river, there must be no lack of our gunboats and warships both on the Shatt-el-Arab and in the Gulf of Basrah generally. We have to-day many ships which are of no use in Greek waters, but which would play an important role in the Persian Gulf and on the Shatt-el-Arab. If these ships are sent we shall need a dock and a repairing yard for them. It has been seen, then, that the question of the Gulf of Basrah and the Shatt-el-Arab is so delicate and urgent as to require that a plan should be drawn up by the civil, military, naval and foreign department officials combined and carried out by them conjointly. We have shown how terrible the danger is. There is not a moment to lose. Rest assured that neglect and indifference may very shortly put quite a different political aspect on Basrah and the surrounding parts. 9.*'' S. G. P. I.—3019 F.

Shake spear, Political Agent, Kuwait, British residency t Consulate General, Baghdad,4th September,1911, Sir I ufive the honour to enclose for your information some items Ox news relating to Basrah and Baghdad received in this Pesidency, / j&amp;v 2 ths nor, our io o* St Your most obedient SerwanConridential . The new Tali of Baghdad,Jalal Bey,from Adanah,arrived here on the 26th Augusfc. T'ith a promphihude worthy of TT azim Pasha him- -self he has already proclaimed a large part of his policy and embarked on decided action, He has dismissed the Christian i.Iayor of Baghdad and replaced him by a .luhammadan ; and he lias given out that,if the Municipality does not work satisfactorily,he will have it abolished. It is said that he did something of the kind at Adanah, The Tali's Barman of Appointment was publicly read at the Sarai on the 20th August,and the reading of it was followed by a speech from himself. I have not yet a full report of the speech in my hands,and the newspaper reports of it are incomplete; but the bali seems to have said that a great street will be made through the middle of the town to carry an electric tramway; to have com- -plimented Col. Javad Bey,who was TT azim Pasha's municipal engineer and whose services he has himself maintained,on his previous good work; to have disappointed the important Oriental Christian ele- -ment by not referring to them specifically,while on the other hand his speech was garnished with pious Muhammadan expressions; and to have made slanting allusions to foreigners against whom,he said,'an iron door' must be closed at Basrah. The 'iron door' phrase is not reproduced in the published accounts of the speech. He is also said to have remarked that 'the hand coming from the South must be warded off'. attached. The substance of the Tail's Barman of Appointment is The street indicated by the Tali would cost l.T.10,000,if the houses,etc.to be removed were fairly expropriated,and the Munici- -pality is now l.T.20,000 in debt,exclusive of the advance of 1.T.10,000 which it has received from the National Bank of Turkey on account of a loan not yet concluded. But nothing so base as finance enters into the calculations of would-be reforming Turkish officials. By the 'iron door' at Basrah,! suppose nothing more formidable can be meant than the 'Marmaris' gun-boat,the 200 ' T izam infantry already there,and so many of the 900 at Baghdad as could be spared. JalalJalal Bey also seems to be entering into close relations with the late associates of fazim Pasha, his reappointment of Col, Javad Bey as municipal engineer is announced in the local press, ne has taken ’Abdul £adir Pasha,iChadhairi,the principal agitator against TT azim Pasha's recall, into his confidence; and the house which he inhabits belongs to that prominent character or one of his nephews.Cpnriclenuial . A N E X Lf E E . Abstract of the barman of Appointment of Jalal Bey to the V r ilayat of Baghdad, read at the Sarai on the hOth August 1911. 1. The V'ali is to turn the rivers of Mesopotamia to account (? by means of navigation and irrigation). 2. At least 3,T,40,000 will be granted annually by the Department of Public Yorks for Baghdad purposes. 3. The Yali is empowered to appoint and dismiss all civil officers,except those of the ordinary Judicial and Shar'i Depart- -ments. 4. The Yali is to reorganise the Police and open a Police School if possible. (This refers to '’Police' 1 proper,not to Gendarmerie) . 5. The Gendarmerie are to be entirely under the Dali’s orders,and all Gendarmerie correspondence with Constantinople will be conduct&gt;- -ed through him in future. 6. In case of urgent or important internal questions the Yali is authorised to summon the Yali of Basrah to Baghdad for consultation 7. The Yali is to formulate a scheme,with the least possible delay for the settlement of the nomad tribes upon the land. 8. Two regular regiments at Baghdad and one at Basrah are to be at the Yali’s disposal: and,if at any time he thinks it necessary that the Padifs or the Ihtiyat should be called out,he may,without previous reference to Constantinople,request the Inspector General of the 4th Inspectorat to summon them to the colours. remarks on above. The 8th provision is a novel one and seems certain to lead to friction between the civil and military. It and the 5th provision do not appear to place the relations of Baghdad and Basrah on a definite or satisfactory basis,but secret instructions in ampli- -fication of them may exist. The arrangement that the Inspector- -General should call out Padifs is curious.iNO. 4 February 1:1912 Paraphrasd of .tel^ram i^o. 10 Feb* lat to Eabaeay Constantinople and repeated to Bushire.

Wonckhaus &amp; Co., on behalf of the Baghdad Railway Company. Despatch No. 55 , dated 31 st October 191 t. From—His Majesty's Consul, Basrah, To—His Majesty^ Ambassador at Constantinople. With reference to mv telegrams Nos. 148 and 149 of the 23rd instant, I have the honour to report to Your Excellency that Mr. C. Darby, the local manager of Messrs. Strick, Scott &amp; Co,, Limited, of London, informed me on the 23rd instant that the Vali had requested him to tender for the dredging of the Bar at the entrance to the Shatt-al-Arab. The Vali told Mr Darby that he would obtain a concession for him and spoke of purchasing two dredgers at a cost of ^50,000 each. He stated that a company would have to be formed in accordance with Turkish law, and registered at Constantinople, but that there would be no difficulty about this. The Vali did not press for an immediate answer, and Mr. Darby has reported the Vali’s conversation to his London Office. The proposal is interesting as showing that the Turkish Government is still preoccupied with the Bar. It may be mentioned here that a dredger, brought out some years after Midhat Pasha’s achievements in the Gulf region, has been rusting for thirty years on the bank of the river opposite Basrah. It has been reported for some time past that Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co., the local Agents of the Hamburg-America Line, are endeavouring to acquire land in Basrah on behalf of the Baghdad Railway Company. I am now in posses sion of reliable information that this firm has been in negotiation with Abdul Wahab Pasha, one of the Deputies of Basrah (my Despatch No. 53 of the 18th ultimo), for the purpose of a plot of ground on the river between Maghil and Ghermet Ali owned by the Zuhair family. When Baghdad Railway material arrives in Basrah, a depot will be necessary for storing it, pending its despatch to Baghdad. Abdul Wahab Pasha departed for Constantinople on the 26th instant, and it is stated that no sale has been effected, but l am without definite information on this point. A German engineer of the Baghdad Railway, wffio passed through Basrah a few weeks ago, stated that the company would shortly send out twelve steamers and twenty-four barges, to convey railway material from Basrah to Baghdad. I am informed that Emin Bey, the local agent of the Idareh-i-Nehrieh, states that the Baghdad Railway Company has arranged to send out six steamers, which will work in connection with the Idareh steamers. According to Emin Bey, three of these steamers will ultimately become the property of the Idareh. Pos sibly no definite arrangements have been made yet. I transmit herewith a translation of the decision of the Administrative Council of the Basrah Vilayet of August 10th, 1911, respecting the proposed sale for ^T. 180,000 of the “ Senieh ” date gardens at Dawasir, to Jasim bin Ibrahim, a member of a pearl-dealing firm established in Bombay. I am informed that, before applying for this land, Jasim bin Ibrahim took the precaution of havinghimself registered as an Ottoman subject in the Turkish Consulate at Bombay. The decision not to sell this land was mainly due to the “ patriotic ” efforts of Jelal Bey, the then Vali of Basrah. An article, said to have been inspired by Jelal Bey, was published on August 18th. in a local newspaper, “ Ar-Reshad,” denouncing the proposed sale of the Dawasir date gardens. Enclosures with Basrah Despatch No. 55 of October 31, 1911. Decision of the Basrah Administrative Couyicil^ No. 804 of July 28 ) 1327 {August 10, /p//). Translation. July 19, 1327. The telegram of the Ministry of Finance of August 1, 1911, and the obser vations of the Official of “Transferred Lands” have been read. The date gardens of Dawasir and Aradah include a large tract of four thousand jenhs under cultivation and one hundred and fifty jeribs uncultivated. According to the sums paid for its lease for the thirteen years ending with the year 1329, a yearly revenue of ^T. 5,249 is obtained in addition to tithes. In this district, the value of land is gradually increasing, and it is certain that the value of the date gardens in question will be doubled or trebled. The question, whether this land should be disposed of or not, contains considerations of extraordinary importance and nicety. The land is situated near the mouth of the Shatt-al* Arab, and apart from the increased value which it will acquire in the future, it is a set-off to the land on the opposite bank, in the Jezirat-al-Khidhr, called Abadan, which is in the possession ot foreigners. If sold, no matter to whom, there is no doubt that it would ultimately pass into foreign hands, that it would cause political and administrative dangers, and that it would have far-reaching effects upon the future affairs not only of the Vilayet of Basrah, but of all Irak. There fore, its remaining in the control of the State is essential, and a reply shall be sent to the Ministry of Finance that the application of the aforesaid customer, who formerly resided in Bombay, involves the dangers mentioned, and has been rejected.

During my recent visit to His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah, I learnt that this so-called appointment has appeared in the Basrah Annual Budget for some five years ; as it has never actually existed, it appears to be merely a modest addition to some Basrah official’s emoluments. 3. I also met Shaikh Sir Mubarak-as-Subah at Mohamerah and took the opportunity of questioning him. He denied all knowledge of any such appoint ment, and indeed of any Turkish official in Kuwait; he added that he had no intention of ever permitting Turkish officials to reside in Kuwait. Telegram P.

I have the honour to report tho otopa which have been taken by the various Arabs communities of the Persian Gulf to give expression to their sympathy with their co-reli- gionists, the Turks* in the letters * present embarrassment# by subscribing considerable sums of money in aid of the Turkish Government, or of relief organization*. 2 . At Koweit a sum of Rs.1,54,000 was subscribed, in general aid. At Bahrein He.1,04,100 were contributed especially in aid of Turkish sick and wounded; while from Debai Rs.43,000 were forthcoming in aid of the Turkish Government. It seemed natural that the Arab communities of the uulf should seek to evince some practical sympathy for their co-religionists, and, as in 1910, the movement being Resident’s letters Nos.1887,2078,2198( based rather on dated 10th July, 31st July and 14th f &amp; religious senti ment than political sympathy, it was not thought expedient to discourage it in any way.3. It ia interesting to note that the deputation sent by the Bahrein community to Busreh to arrange for the remittance of their subscriptions to Constantinople con it sidered/a wise precaution to telegraph to the Turkish Go vernment from Bushire announcing the total amount and the Vide Residency Diary entry No#1203 | December 1912« } object or the subscription before they proceeded to Busreh; where they anticipated with good reason and later experienced consi derable difficulty in keeping the money out of the hands of local officials. In this connection the Sheikh of Bahrein is reported to have expressed himself indifferent to the destination of his subscription, so long as he got a receipt for it, whilst Sheikh Mubarak frankly expressed the belief that not more than one third of the total amount subscribed at Koweit would reach its intended destination. 4. Ihese contributions have all been mentioned to the Government of India incidentally in the diaries of the several Political officers concerned but it has seemed con venient to bring the incidents, in their collective bearing, to the notice of Government, especially as a report regard ing the Koweit contribution furnished to His Majesty^ No.3 dated 18th January 1913.} Embassy by His Majesty*s Consul, Busreh, seems possibly liable, if read by itself, to create an erroneous impression.
