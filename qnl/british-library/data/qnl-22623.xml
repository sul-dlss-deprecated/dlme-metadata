I am now informed that whilst the new rsturn includes details of the separate items requested it still relates to disposals and not to REFINERY output, i.e. products manufactured, and that it is not clear whether the input figures are in fact the quantities fed into the Refinery during the nonth or whether they relate to the actual production of crude oil in Bahrain and imports from Arabia, It is stated that the whole ' gives a comprehensive picture of the trade of the island but apparently disregards the actual operations of the Refinery. The Ministry of Fuel and power have therefore supplied a draft pro-form indicating exactly what they would like to have about Refinery operations, and add that it is modelled on the lines of a return collected by the Petroleum Administrator for War, Washington, from all refineries during the war, and is now in use for all Sterling Oil Companies. 3. I should be grateful if you would now send me monthly details of your Refinery operations as in the attached pro-forma, together with the detailed return of shipments which is still required.

To The Chief Local Representative, Bahrain Petroleum Company Ltd., Awali, Bahrain Island. Dear Sir, I should be grateful if you would let me have the figures of petroleum products ex ported (a) to India, and (b) to Pakistan, du ring the year 1948. 2. I'should also be grateful if you would arrange in future to show exports of petroleum products to India and Pakistan separately in the Monthly Reports of Petroleum Product Exports that you send me. Yours faithfully, Political Agent, Bahrain.2,2 r 5 1. in January, 1937, India Office wanted, for the information of the Petroleum Department, details of oil shipped from Bahrain as also their destinations intimated to them every month (vide pages 118, 119 of vol. XIV). Although some attempt was made to comply with l.O.'s request nothing came into fruition until 1.0. sent a reminder in November (p.54 of Vol. XV refers). From then onwards office had been obtaining the required information from the d . of C. and forwarding it to the India office. 2. India Office, in July, 1941, wanted a statement of bunker deliveries (p.76 Vol. XVII) also. And till j JU' A July, 1943, we have been sending a con solidated monthly statement showing figures for oil exports (received from Director of Customs) and Bunker deliveries ( ' ' Bapco). Now it was that 1.0. requested the monthly export figures under various heads to be tele graphed to them at the end of each month. Consequently! Bapco were asked to supply the figures. As the figures received from Bapco and D. of c. did not agree (vide flag 'A' of note-sheet Vol. xviii), the former was asked to send a statement showing details of exports also every month and the latter was informed that his figures were no longer required. From then onwards the statement assumed its present form (vide specimen form at p.239, Vol. xviii). 3. From paragraph 1 above it will be seen that even before the war we had been sending monthly statements of oil exports to l.o. - it was not started as a wartime measure - in some other concise form, if not in the present form. We may, however, ask 1.0. whether they require such statements now? p/6From Uie Political Agent, al</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000239_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/426</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000239</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/426</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 10/7 [10/1 A I] BAPCO: oil shipments'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1945/1949</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2013-11-26T11:06:31</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (294 folios)</extent><extent>The documents in the file are arranged in chronological order.
