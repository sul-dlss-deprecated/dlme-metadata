On 27-2-29, the Government of Bahrain issued a proclamation stating that ail persons born in Bahrain of foreign parents would be considered as Bahrain subjects unless registered at liis Britannic Majesty f s Political x^gency. H. B. M f s Political xigent issued a similar notice, No. 180/1929 dated 27th February 1929. The Bahrain Government, in the usual way.re-issued their proclamation on 30-3-33. I enclose copies of both proclamations.- 2 - r Persians are foreign subjects and their status in Bahrain is in every way similar to that of other foreigners such as Iraqis, IJejdis, Omanis, Syrians and other nationalities. The offspring of such foreigners who are born in Bahrain are treated as Bahrain subjects unless they wish to retain the nationality of their parents in which case they must be registered at h. B. M’s Political Agency. The order has been enforced for the last four years though it appears that the Persian Government have only recently become acquainted with the fact. T 7ith regard to (b): the Bahrain Petroleum Co. is an American company and it is not the custom of the Bahrain government to interfere with the interior economy of any foreign companies which may be working in Bahrain. The labourers in the company are neither enlisted or discharged by the Bahrain government and the statement that the Bahrain govern ment v/ere dismissing all Persians employed in the oil company is both ludicrous and absurd.

January 1929; so thnt this decision was nine months' older then the agreement of the status quo .

I also recorded In that note actions contrary to previous practice and the atatus quo on the part of the British Consul- General at Bushlre and the British Consulate at Mohannerah, documents and dates being quoted, In such a way that no roon was left for any doubt; and I followed this up with *y note of the 86th Azar 1309 (Beoeutier 17th 1950) No. 86041, my note of the 28th Dey 1509 (January 18th 1951) Ho. 7101214, and sy nots of the 30th lafand 1309 (21st March 1951) Bo.33565, together with proofs and documentsj I gave a reply to every objection raised | by Hie Britannic Majesty’s Legation; and I proved by decisive arguments that, previous to the action of British reir esentativee contrary to the status quo , no step contrary to the ffit^tus ,aaa had been taken by the rep resentatIves of Persia in any circum stances; or, if such a step had bean taken, let the Bri is;; Legation prove the faet with evidence and documents.

The facts are: (i) On the 27th Itebruary 1929 the Government of Bahrain issued an f Alan (Proclamation) ordaining that persons born in Bahrain of foreign parents would, unless registered in the Agency, be considered for all purposes as subjects of the Bahrain State. On the 30th March 1933 the Bahrain government reissued their ’Alan of the 27th IVbruary 1929. These ’Alans apply to Persians in the same way as to other foreigners residing in Bahrain.

I as set out in (ii) of naragraph 1 o^ ^owle’s letter to ^ehran of 7th June. rv here seems to us force in the objection taken In paragraph 2 of that letter to emphasising the American connection of the Bahrain Petroleum Comnany and it is clear that the Bahrain Covernnent themselves take exception + o any suggestion that they might be regarced as copying the Persian Government! No doubt Mallet, in the light of the Resident’s reply, will independently have reached this con clusion.

British protected persons ( in? its true sense) performed under the Bahrain Order in Council, -he idea underlying the Proclanation of the Bahrain C-ovemment v/as that the children born oi foreigners residing in Bahrain are, at any rate •while in Bahrain, Bahrain subjects for all purposes, but it was recognised that as the Shaikh had handed juris diction over foreigners to the British Government (i.e. the Agency Courts; and also as there might be cases in which individuals might prefer to remain under the jurisdiction of the Agency Courts, it was necessary to avoid making the Proclamation definitely compulsory.I quote from memory, per- 3. A few ( haps a dozen or so^) people have M register- ed” themselves. But registration in this matter has a too legal tang. In practice they are simply noted in a hook ( so that the Bahrain Government and the Agency Courts know, which authority is to deal with them) as being foreigners, who, though horn in Bahrain, wish to remain under the jurisdiction of the Agency Court. 4. 'he real virtue-of the 3?roclamation is that the children of Persians (who are the chief foreign community residing pennanently in Bahrain) become subject to the jurisdiction of the Bahrain Courts, for thev do not register in the Agency, and so in the process of time the British protected Persian ( who is a perfect nuisance and a fruitful source of petty litigation in the Agency Court) will by a natural process cease to exist. 5.

Dear Gastrell, I return the letter from the Resident to Laithwaite, I have no suggestions to add and I agree that it would be best to leave the matter as it is at present. 2. The Bahrain Government regards all persons born in Bahrain of foreign parents as being subjects of Bahrain unless they are regis tered at the Agency. In this respect we define a 'foreigner* as a person not born in Bahrain or a person born in Bahrain but registered at the Agency as a foreigner. This regulation of ours is * weak in one point, we have made no provision for minors. I think it would be un desirable to issue another proclamation on the subject at present but if you approve I will send out a circular to all departments stating that minors will be assumed to belong to the nationality of their father until of age. 3. Sooner or later there must occur a test case on the subject, already we have dealt with several young Persians born in Bahrain in our Courts but there has been no complaint at the same time I feel sure that sooner or later there will be a complaint.The regulation has been in fcrce for several years and has been running smoothly.

With regard to your statement aade to the effect that the proclanation in question is of benefit to Persians since their status as foreigners la thereby assured sad thus they enjoy the privileges extended to foreigners, 1 should state that this statement does not sees to be a logical argument since, as all the inhabitants of Bahrein, with the exception of those who have actually the nationality of a foreign pews*, are considered as Persian subjects whether or not they have registered their naaea somewhere, 1 aa at a loss to understand how it la possible to naae a number of lersian* resident in ?$ahreia ae /foreigners- 2 - /* for*ign«re 90 aa to «»Xc to enjoy the prllrllegea to which you have alluded and of vfeicfc one $«y aoaelet in the dleolaeal of foreigners from the aenrloe of the oil Ooupeny. 8.

My My dear Lai thwaite, * ;/ith r^erence to India Office letter No. P.L. 3918/33 of the 4th July, 1933, I enclose a copy of a despatch from Hoare at Tehran on the subject of certain complaints received from the Persian Government regarding the treatment of Persians in Bahrain. 2 . I should perhaps explain, with regard to the last sentence of the draft reply enclosed in this despatch, that Koare has not consulted us on this point in separate papers. He doubtless felt that to send us the draft for our concurrence was a / sufficiently clear method of consulting us. 3. The despatch was of course written at a time v/hen Hoare still hoped that we would authorise his proposals for taking a strong line with the Persians. Our present policy is, however, to; be as unprovocative as possible. Bait quite apart from this, we feel that it would be advisable to omit trie last paragraph of the draft. It may perhaps be said that we could hardly be more unsuc cessiul than we are at present in our j efforts to heip Bahrainis in Persia. Je are, however, under an obligation to the Shaikh of Bahrain to conduct his i relations with foreign countries, including Persia; and when or own current relations with Persia are farrly good, and some one ol goodwill such as Feroughi is at the Persian Ministry fir Foreign Arrairs, a certain amount of satisfaction -or at least explanation-can occasionally be obtained from the Persians by semi-official methods bn questions concerning the interests of the Shiakh. We think, therefore, that it w be a mistake to take the initiative in xje making this impo for the future, as would almost certainly be the case if t h final/ * * H ■.final paragraph of the firaft were allowed to remain. 4. Further, though this particular correspondence only concerns Bahrain, the Persian might conceivable, wishing to go one better than us refuse in future to entertain semi official repr sentaions regardig the affairs of any of the Arab Shaikhs; ?nd we should be in a weak position Arab proteges vis-a-vis jbtmdutexxxamxMaxBXKMinBt/ if we had to admit that, ow; ov.'ing to our own action, we were no longer in a position to represent their views to the Persian Government in any sjape or form. 5* Finally it is perhaps worth while pointing out that in this business of Bahrain nothing is ever wuite H on all fours’ 1 , for the simple reason that while Persia claims Bahrain, Bahrain does not claim Persia. Owing to this lack of symmetry , t u quoqu e retorts of the king suggested in the last paragrph of t he draft are never entirely watertight 6 . vVe propose, therefore, subject to your concurrence to tell Hoare that the letter a s drafted can now be sent to Mo 1 tamedi, hut with the omission of the last paragraph.

Government of India do not a tJ ree v/ith the contention in paragraph 3 of Political resident*s letter that the Bahrain Government's proclamation of x929 infringes the unrestricted grant to bis Majesty's Government of juris diction over all foreigners. The proclamation:operates as a Bahrain nationality law conferring the status of a Bahrain subject on a person born in Bahrain to a foreign father with a right in such person to opt for the foreign nationality of his father to the exclusion of Bahrain nationality by registering in the Agency. Bo exception can therefore be taken to this perfectly legitimate and normal application of the jus loci , and in view of what passed in x929, they a to ree with the Political Resident that there is no necessity for the exchange of formal communication between the iolitical Agent and the Bhaikh of Bahrain as suggested in paragraph 2 of foreign Office le t ter2 &amp; letter of the j.6th November 1933* 3* Government of India are however of opinion that in order to implement the mode of opting for Bahrain nationality, which was provided in the Pro- -clamation, it was necessary for the Shaikh to secure from the British authorities an agreement to register persons born in Bahrain to a foreign father who present themselves for registration. The documents of j.929 forwarded by Political Kesident show that such agreement was duly secured. Since however the agreement was entered into by the local authorities without reference to higher authority and might theoretically be repudiated by the former without reference to the latter, it might be desirable to issue formal instructions to the local authorities that where registration is applied for in pursuance of the 1929 arrangements it is not to be refused. The issue of the above has been authorised. H.*£. .Metcalfe • Foreign Secretary to the Government of J-ndia. PHV 1 ) INDIA OFFICE, 7/HI IEHALL, S.W. 1. p.Z. 5811/34. 5th October 1934.

Sir, With reference to the Government of India 1 s express letter of 3rd September 1934, F.118-N/33, and connected correspondence regarding the registration of foreigners in Bahrein, I am directed by the Secretary of State to forward for the information of the Government of India copy of the letter from the Foreign Office noted in the margin, and to say that, he accepts the view of the position stated in paragraph 2 of the Government of India's letter under reply, and agrees as to the desirability of the issue of the formal instructions suggested in paragraph 3 of that letter. He would be glad if the Government of India would arrange for the necessary action to be taken in this connection. 2 . The Government of India will, however, observe that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has suggested consideration of the desirability (a) of framing definite nationality laws in a reasonably complete form for Bali rein (and other States in a similar position in the Persian Gulf area); and (b) of revising the Bahrein Order in Council on the same general lines as the recent draft Koweit Order in Council. 3./ ^ foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, NETJ DELHI.4-/ 2 . 3* The Secretary of State is disposed prima facie to think that in the circumstances discussed in the Foreign Office letter of 16th November there might be some advantage both in the preparation of a definite nationality law for Bahrein (and possibly also Koweit) and in a revision of the Bahrein Order in Council on the lines suggested. Such a nationality law would presumably take the form of a proclamation or decree issued by the Sheikh expressly and in terms as a nationality law; and would include a provision on the lines of the Sheikh of Bahrein’s proclamation of 1929 ? and a further provision that the descendants of Bahreinis born abroad for one or perhaps two generations should be considered as Bahrein subjects. Before considering the matter further he would, however, be glad to be favoured with the views of the Government of India and the Political Resident both on the question generally and in particular on the probable reaction of the Sheikh of Bahrain (and the Sheikh of Koweit, if it was though! desirable to approach His Excellency with a view to the preparation of a nationality law in respect of his State) towards action on these lines. Should the Government of India and the Resident see advantage in such action, and should they anticipate no difficulty with the Rulers in question, the Secretary of State would then propose to arrange, in collaboration with the Foreign Office, for the preparation of drafts of a brief nationality lav/ and of a redraft of the Bahrein Order in Council, the texts of which would be communicated to India and to the Gulf for examination locally.4 . Copy of this letter is being sent to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (j$d.) J. 0. WALTON.Copy. E 6207/2369/91. Foreign Office, S.W.l. 16th November, 1934. Sir, With reference to India Office letter No.P.E.5811/34 of the 5th October 1934, regarding the registration of foreigners in Bahrain, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to request you to inform Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare that he concurs generally in the views expressed in that letter and in the action which Sir Samuel Hoare proposes to take in this matter. 2. While, however, Sir John Simon is prepared to accept the view put forward by the Government oi India in paragraph 2 of their express letter No«F.118-N/33 oi the 3rd September to the India Office that the Shaikh's proclamation of 1929, which was reissued in 1933, to the effect that persons born in Bahrain of foreign parents shall be considered as subjects of the Bahrain State unless registered at the Political Agency, should be regarded as a Bahrain nationality law, he considers that it would nevertheless be more satisfactory if this proclamation were to be issued expressly and in terms as a nationality law so that there could be no doubt as to its character. It appears to him desirable for other reasons also that Bahrain and other similar protected States should have definite nationality laws in a reasonably complete form. Bahrainis are to be found in other parts of the world, many of them have children bom there, and their right to British protection depends on whether they possess Bahrain nationality. It is quite undefined at the moment to what extent Bahrain nationality must be held to be retained / Under Secretary of State, India Office.retained in the case of persons born abroad. 3. There is one further point arising out of this correspondence to which Sir John Simon wishes to invite the attention of Sir Samuel Koare. It appears to have been assumed by the Political Resident and by the Government of India that the present jurisdiction exercised by His Majesty's Government over foreigners in Bahrain rests upon Shaikh Isa's letter of the 16th July 1909. Sir John Simon feels some doubt as to whether this is in fact so. It is quite true that in that letter Shaikh Isa requested that His Majesty's Government ''should exercise authority in all cases in which the foreigners only are concerned, but not in other cases'. Sir Samuel Hoare is aware, however, in 1912 the Shaikh explained that he did not intend to include in the designation 'foreigners' the dependents of petty Arab potentates in the Persian Gulf, a condition which was eventually accepted by His Majesty's Government in IS19. Now, under Article 8 of the Bahrain Order in Council, the Political Agent was given jurisdiction over, inter alios, 'foreigners with respect to whom the Shaikh has agreed with His Majesty for, or consented to, the exercise of jurisdiction by His Majesty'. It would appear, therefore, that immediately subsequent to His Majesty's Government's acceptance of the Shaikh's explanation in 1919 the position was that the Political Agent could not exercise jurisdiction over all foreigners, since His Majesty's Government had agreed with the Shaikh to except from that term the subjects of the Arab rulers referred to above. In practice, however, this arrangement proved unworkable, notably in regard to Nejdis, and in 1920 it proved necessary, without the Shaikh's consent, to issue a notice announcing that all foreign subjects, including Persians arid subjects of Arab rulers and Chiefs, other than those ox Bahrain, were, while in Bahrain, entitled to British protection. There thus resulted a position in which His Majesty's Government, in apparent conflict with Article 8 of tne Bahrain Order in Council /fp - 3 - Council of 1913, were claiming jurisdiction over certain foreigners with respect to whom the Shaikh had not consented to the exercise of jurisdiction by His Majesty. But this anomalous position may perhaps be regarded as having lasted only during the brief remainder of Shaikh Isa’s rule. The present Shaikh, Shaikh Hamad, has never, so far asSir John Simon is aware, demurred to the exercise oi jurisdiction by the Political Agent over all the foreigners in Bahrain, nor to the terms of the 1920 notice establishing t&amp;at jurisdiction, even though he may not speciiically have agreed with His Majesty's Government for the exercise of such jurisdiction. Strictly speaking therefore, the position appears to be that the present jurisdiction of His Majesty's Government over all foreigners in Bahrain rests not on Shaikh Isa's letter of 1909, but on the Political Agent's notice of 1920, as subsequently accepted, or not demurred by to by the present Shaikh of Bahrain. 4. The point is perhaps an academic one in relation to the present case. Nevertheless it will be seen from the foregoing review that the position with regard to juris diction over foreigners under the existing Bahi ain Order in Council is too uncertain and indefinite to be satis factory at the present time with the development of the Bahrain Oil concession and of the nrab coast air route, when the presence of an increasing number of foreigners in Bahrain is to be expected, and it is particularly desirable ttet there should be no question about the matter of jurisdiction. The Bahrain Order in Council in its present form makes the jurisdiction of the British courts depend upon the agreement of the Shaikh, and the ohaikh s agreement to the jurisdiction which His Majesty's Government at present actually claim is left rather as a matter of inference. Sir John Simon would suggest, thereiore, tk* for / SI#!t r - -4- for the consideration of Sir Samuel Hoarej that the Bahrain Order in Council should be amended on the same lines as the recent draft Kuwait Order in Council, and that the Order itself should specify in terms who are the persons who are subject to the jurisdiction of the court; and that as in the case of the Kuwait Order, the assent of the Shaikh should be obtained to the terms of the Order in Council as revised. In this connection Sir Samuel Hoare will recall that, when the revision of the Kuwait Orderin Council in respect of this point was undertaken, that Order was found to be out of date and unsatistactory in many other respects, and nearly all the criticisms of the iormer Kuwait Order in Council apply also to the existing Bahrain Order* Sir John Simon would, therefore, suggest further that, if the proposal to revise those provisions of the Bahrain Order in Council which deal with the juriddiction of the Agency courts over foreigners in Bahrain is accepted by Sir Samuel Hoare^ the opportunity might be taken to make a thorough revision oi that Order on the lines of the new Kuwait Order in Council.

(6) Foreigners whose Governments prohibited the ownei*fciil.r or real property by foreigners in the countries of those Governments to be prohibited owning land anu property in Bahrain except within the limits required tor their residence, trade or craft* 4. Clauses (1) and (2) are those suggested in paragraph 3 oi India Office letter quoted above* 5. The reasons for (6) are two-fold* (a) to meet the danger under (4) of registration en fljjit ty Persians * h0 on the issue of the Nationality haw would certainly prefer to come under the agency as foreigners than under tlie Bahrain Government. Under (6) Persians would have to choose between continuing their Persian nationality ana parting with their property, and those oi substance ii»ore liKely ( to cling to their property than to their nationality* (b). To give the Bahrain Governuent soroe much needed satisfaction in treating Persian subjects in Bahrain exactly the /-3 th« - with regard to property * as isahrain auhjecta are treated in J. ereia. In this coimection it may be noted that clause (6) la less drastic than the rersian law since it does not force foreigners who wish to retain their status as such to leave the country. 6* To pursue the analogy of (6)| in principle there would appear to he nothing to prevent the Government of India promulgating a similar law which would present ±eraiana owning properly in India in the same way th±&lt;t Britisn Ixuiian sno. ^cfs are not allowed to own property in Persia. This is, however, a mat*ar which is outside tho scope of this letter. 7. British subjects, British Indian subjects, Americans, and other foreigners, whose Govemitients allowed tlie po^sesaion of land by foreigners, would not be affected, anti the measure vis a vis the Persian Government being reciprocal could easily he defended. Saudi subjects micht be affected but I am not clear what the Saudi Government law is on the subject of foreigners owning property. 8. Clause (5) would not of course affect Persians who do not own property, and who ore of course in the majority, and there would he the possibility of these registering Eft at the hgency, while I think it is generally agreed (vide paragraph 7 of xay letter HO.308-C of 17th November 1934) that it would be a good thing for Bahrain! Persians gradually to come unaer the authority of the Shaikh. To prevent such imhq registration it would be feasible to increase the registration fee over that of He.l/- per annum which ia required from British Indian subjects. In principle there would appear to be no objection to this administrative measure since the Agency is kept up by His lajesty’s Government for the bene lit of Britieh and British Indian subjects am not foreigners.

Z« 29 / 35 » FOREIGN OFFICE, ( S 4931/762/91) S. W. 1. 30th August, 1935. Dear Clauson, You will remember that I discussed with you the other day the question of the proposed Bahrain nationality law. I explained that although the matter had been fully gone into on receipt of the copy of Fowle’s express letter iio.244-S of 2nd March forwarded with your official letter P.Z.1826/35 of 19th March, we had unfortunately omitted by an oversight to give you our observations at the time. 2. To remedy this lapse I now enclose: (1) a copy of a minute by Beckett of 27th March in which he comments in detail on the Resident's proposals; (2) a copy of a memorandum of Baggallay on the Persian aspect of the proposed law. e 3. We have now received your further official letter P.Z.2494/35 of 13th August, and notice from the enclosure therein that the Government of India are in agreement with Fowle's proposals. Their express letter does not, however, introduce any new consideration, and with one exception I do not think it is necessary for us to add anything at this stage to the expression of our views as set out in the enclosures to this letter. 4. The one additional point on which we feel we should comment is the suggestion in paragraph 8 of Fowle's &gt;/ ?; express letter of 2nd March that in order to prevent a mass registration of Persian subjects at the Agency the custanary registration fee for foreigners might be raised as compared with the 1 Rupee per annum required from British Indians. We notice that the Government of India approve/ tson, Esq2 . approve this proposal, but we do not ourselves like it at all, as it introduces an el eauent of discrimination (albeit ostensibly against non-British foreigners as a whole). This seems to us indefensible upon any ground, but we should be particularly loath to subscribe to the reason which Fowle cites in the third sentence of paragraph 8 of his express letter. It is clearly in our interest to possess jurisdiction over all foreigners in Bahrain, with the consequent obligation of undertaking the registration of foreigners through our representative at Bahrain, and we could hardly justify an increase in the fee charged to foreigners on the ground that the Agency existed solely for the benefit of British and British Indian subjects. 5 . we should be grateful for an opportunity to see the draft of any reply which you may propose to send to the Acting Resident. 0 . jf you agree, it might save time and a good deal of correspondence if we were to have a meeting in due course, which Beckett would be prepared to attend, to discuss the terms of the proposed legislation. It might be better, though, for a draft of the nationality law, and of any separate law to deal with the possession of real property by foreigners, to be available for consideration at the meeting; and if you agree with the suggestions in Beckett 1 s minute of 27th March you may like to consider asking Colonel Loch or one of your legal advisers to take steps to have the necessary draft or drafts prepared. Yours sincerely, (Sgd. ) J. G. WARD1840/7 6 2/91) I will deal separately with points lTos.1-4 of paragraph 3 of the Political Agent* s despatch on the one hand and point 5 on the other. Points 1-4 are the lines upon which a future Bahrain nationality lav/ should be framed. Eventually a draft of the proposed law in a form suitable for enactment will have to be prepared and this I understand is to be done jointly by the Foreign Office and the India Office. I do not see any objection to points 1-4 as far as they go but they require a good deal of expansion and there are a number of points which require thinking out before we can get to the stage of actually drafting a law. I do not think we have got to te stage when the text of a draft law could be produced yet, but I shall set out below certain suggestions in this connexion which might, I think, be put to the India Office for consideration. I am not attesting to put them out in the language or theform of a law yet, but I think what I have put down will assist towards further consideration of the points which the draft law must eventually cover* My suggestions are as follows:~ (l) All persons born in Bahrain before or after the date of this law are Bahrain nationals except persons, whose fathers at the time of those persons 1 births possessed the nationality of another state and who are registered at the Political Agency (a) within one year of the date of their majority, if then resident in Bahrain or within one year of the date of the commencement of their residence/f in residence in Bahrain, if not then resident in Bahrain: or (t&gt;) within one year of the date of this law if they are already of age and resident in Bahrain. The periods of one year specified in (a) and (b) above may be extended at the discretion of the Political Agent. (2) All persons born abroad before or after the date of this law of fathers possessing Bahrain nationality at the time of those persons* birth and whose father or grandfather was born in Bahrain are Bahrain nationals except persons whose fathers were resident abroad during the minority of such persons and who, if resident in Bahrain, might have been registered at the Political Agency under (a) or (b) of Article 1* (3) A person who possesses Bahrain nationality shall lose it. (a) if he voluntarily acquires by naturalisation the nationality of another State and an order cancelling his Bahrain nationality is given by the Ruler of Bahrain, either on the application of that person or proprio motu ; (b) if he also possesses the nationality of another State and an order cancelling his Bahrain nationality is given by the Ruler of Bahrain on the application of that person. (4) (i) A woman who marries a Bahrain national shall acquire Bahrain nationality and a woman of Bahrain nationality who marries a foreigner shall lose/lose Bahrain nationality if and when she acquires the nationality of her husband but not otherwise. (ii) A woman who as acquired Bahrain nationality by marriage shall lose it when divorced or a widow is she acquires or possesses another nationality. Bahrain nationality may be restored to her by an order of the Ruler of Bahrain given on her application. ( 5 ) The Ruler of Bahrain may grant Bahrain nationality to any person resident in Bahrain who applies for it and may subsequently cancel the grant if such person ceases to reside in Bahrain. As regards 5 , 1 see no objection to the proposal in principle, but 1 do not think that this matter should be treated in the nationality law itself, though it may well be treated in another law which will be published and come into force at the same time. This proposal will also require aigood deal of development and thinking out before it can reach a legislation form. In this connexion the following points have occurred to me. The text speaks of “owning land and property 11 . I suppose, however, that in the first place only real property is intended. Secondly, there are in western systems of law at any rate at least two different forms of ownership of real property (in the loose sense) i.e. the possession of the freehold and the possession of land upon a lease, and it may be necessary to make it clear whether or not both these two things are being covered. There are restrictions on the ownership of real property by foreigners not only in Persia but in a number of other countries, viz. Saudi Arabia. Further, even in some parts of the British Empire, for example some of the Austra lian States, foreigners are unable to own the freehold of land, though I think they can hold land under lease. The position is the same in a number, though not in all,of the States of the United States of America. Restrictions in fact on the ownership of land by foreigners are fairly common. Supposing, therefoie, uhat this proposal is adopted, it may be a question of some judgment whether a given class of foreigners falls under it or not and it may be desirable that the text of the law should provide that the classes of foreigners who come under this provision should be those notified by the Political Agent in some foim or other. Further it will be necessary to have reasonable provisions enabling foreigners who at present own land in Bahrain and will cease to be able to do so under this future law to dispose of their interests under reasonable conditions. One observation occurs to me in connexion with the personal letter of the 17th November from the Political Resident to the Indian Foreign Secretary. It may be true, as he says, that it is desirable that Persians in Bahrain should be brought under Bahrain jurisdiction, but I think it is clear that it is only desirable that they should be brought under it as Bahrain nationals and not otherwise. We do not want Persians in Bahrain as foreigners not possessing Bahrain nationality to come directly under the native jurisdiction. Such a state ox affairs would in my opinion be likely to lead to trouble, because */e carry international responsibility for the manner in which foreigners are treated in Bahrain. (Sgd.) W.E.Beckett. 27th March 1935.Proposed restrictions on the ownership of real property by foreigners in Bahrain* Discussions are at present going on regarding tne proposed enactment of a new Bahrain nationality law, by which any person born in Bahrain of loreign parents be regarded as a Bahraini subject unless he is registered as a foreigner at the British agency, and the simultaneous enactment of legislation providing that foreigners whose own governments forbid foreigners to own real property shall be forbidden to own land or property in Bahrain except within the limits required for their business, trade or craft (see India Office letter P*Z. 1826/35 of February 13 (E 1840/762/91) enclosing a oooy of a telegram from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf). 2. As foreigners in Persia are unable to own real property except for their own residences or business purposes, the effect of this prohibition will, it appears, be most keenly felt by the Persian colony in Bahrain, against whom it is in fact directed, and many of them will have to get rid of their property unless they accept Bahraini nationality* 3* Although there is no objection to placing this choice of disagreeable alternatives before the Persians in Bahrain, it is on general principles desirable that those who have to get rid of their property should be allowed to/to do so under conditions not more onerous than those imposed on foreigners in similar circumstances in Persia in the past. Um The position in Persia appears to he that foreigners, or at any rate non-Moslems, were originally unable to hold real property at all. Article 5 of the Russo-Persian Commercial Treaty of 1828 however gave Russian subjects the right to own property in Persia for their residences and warehouses. Through the operation of most-favoured nation clauses Article 5 became the charter for all foreigners in Persia to own property for their own residential and business purposes, (but for no other). 5. The general prohibition seems to have been disregarded, however, and on January 29th, 1931&gt; the Persian Government felt it necessary to pass a law requiring all foreigners to dispose of their agricultural property (see E 3341/2040/34 (1931). This law only gave the foreigner three months in which to do so, but contained certain safeguards (in theory at any rate) to ensure that he received a proper price. 6. The position of Persians in Bahrain is different from that of Bahrainis in Persia, in that the former will have some choice as to their nationality and the latter have had none (but have at the same time had no difficulty about keeping their property if they accepted the outward and visible signs of Persian nationality). But it would be fair that such Persians as elect to retain their own nationality under the new Bahraini nationality law should be allowed to dispose of their real property on terms more/more or less similar to those of the Persian law of January 29th 1931* 7 . There is one apparent precedent which might be regarded as a reason for granting less favoux’ab &gt; &gt; terms than those of the law of January 29tn, 1931. to the Persians in Bahrain, i.e. the treatment of certain British subjects who have been required of late to dispose of their real property in Persia. But the precedent is not a true one and it is therefore desirable to explain the circumstances of these cases, if only to dispose of them: 8. On September 7th 1929, the Persian Government intoduced a new nationality law which, with supplementary articles passed on October 21st 1930, provided that certain persons who were Persian subjects under the new law, but had hitherto been foreign subjects, could opt for their foreign nationality within one year from the passing of the supplementary articles. Those who did so were subjected to no penalties as regaids any real property they might possess within the limits allowed by Persian law. Many British subjects omitted, however, through ignorance or ineptitude to tarze the necessary steps to divest themselves of their Persian nationality within the prescribed period and after much discussion the Persian Government agreed at the end of 1932 to grant a further period of grace during which such British subjects might shed their Persian nationality 9 . The Persian Government insisted, however, that this change of nationality should take place, not under/under those articles of* the law which were originally applicable to the British subjects in question (and under which they would have been free to choose either Persian or British nationality and to have kept their property), but under the article (Article XIII) applicable to natural-born Persian subjects who wish for any reason to acquire a foreign nationality. One of the conditions attached to the acceptance of applications under this article is that the person concerned shall dispose of his real property to Persian subjects within a period of one year, even if such property can be held by other foreigners (e.g. for residential and business purposes). This is a longer period than was allowed in the law of January 29th, 1931 , but there are on the other hand no safeguards for the owners 1 interests. The Persian Government declined to waive this condition in the case of the British subjects who proposed to take advantage of the period of grace, but there can be no doubt that they were within their legal rights in doing so and that there is no real comparison between the Persians now in Bahrain and those British subjects who were obliged through their own dilatoriness to appeal for leave to divest themselves of their Persian nationality under Article XIII.

In the event of their own Government not allowing Bahrain Objects to hold property, foreigners would have under the proposed Nationality Law (or subsidary law) (i) to become Bahrain subjects, or y llth, 1935, and s. x}. M EP—4003 h P—&lt;M-480)—20-7-34—2,00,000.(ii) to lose their landed property, ^hose who have landed property will in all probability seek to become Bahrain subjects; otiose who do not hold handed property may flock to the Agency to register as foreigners. This is undesirable and can only be prevented by imposing an high fee for registration. An high fee might bear hardly on poor British subjects and protected persons and it is desirable to avoid hardship to them without discrimination against other foreigners. 4. I venture to suggest the folloY/ing device for prevent ing hardship to British subjects and protected persons (and also to other foreigners in Bahrain) while making it possible to im ose a heavy fee for registration as a foreign subject under the provisions of the proposed Bahrain Nationality law. All British subjects may (voluntarily) register the births of their children under King’s Regulation Nosi of 19P2 (The Births, Deaths and Marriages Regulation 1$22) under the Bahrain Order-in-Council. It is not clear, however, whether the term British subject includes British protected persons. n The Birtns, deaths and Marriages Registration Act, 1836* speaks only of British subjects, but in the definition of n British subject* in the Bahrain Order-in-Council, it includes British protected person. Personally 1 should interpret the position as oeing that for the purposes of Bahrain British protected persons are included. 5. In any case, foreigners (i.e., persons other than Bahrain subjects) may register the births of their chii-dren in a Register kept in the Agency and a few (American, ’Iraqis and so on) have done so. No Persians have done so as the} hoid /Bahrainrain to be a part of Persia, so do not register as foreigners, though they gladly accept the position of foreigner for the surcose of recourse to the Agency Courts* 6 . I suggest thet a’l those vjhose births have been thus registered (see paragraphs 4 and 5 above) in the Agency should be deemed for the purposes of the proposed Bahrain Nationality Lav: to have retained their foreign nationality. It is possible that a clause to that effect in the Bahrain Nationality ^ might be considered necessary. 7 . Any person born in Bahrain other than those who are deemed to have retained their foreign nationality as in para graph 6 above could be required under the Baiirain Nationality | 'Lavr to pay a fee of Rs.25/- for the registration of their foreign nationality in the Agency, ^his fee should prevent a rush for registration by foreigners without landed property. 8 . It would be essential to keep the procedure suggested in paragraphs 6 and 7 above confidential as otherwise tnere | would be likely to be a rush of applicants to register in the Agency between the tine that the proposals become known and the time that the Bahrain Nationality Law comes into force.

It is hereby enacted and decreed that foreigners in Bahrein whose Governments prohibit in their respective territories the ownership of immovable property by persons other than their own nationals may be prohibited from owning such property in Bahrein whether in their own name or in the name of any other person for their benefit except within the limits required for their residence, trade or craft. 2. The Bahrein Government may from time to time notify the Governments whose nationals in Bahrein will be subject to the prohibition laid down in Article 1 and such prohibition will have effect from the date on which the notification in question has been published by the Political Agency in Bahrein. 3. A foreigner who is a national of a Government which has been notified under Article 2 and who already at the date cf publication of the notice owns immovable property covered by the provisions of Art.l, may continue to own it for one year from that date. At any time after the expiry of one year the Bahrein Government may compulsorily acquire the property or may put it up for sale, but the price to be received, in either event, by the owner shall not be less than the sum determined by the valuation prescribed in Article 4. 4./2 . 4. Within 3 months of the date of the notification laid down in Article 2, every foreigner to whom the provisions of Article 3 apply shall submit to the District Court a list of such immovable property. A copy of the list shall be given to the Bahrein Government, which may thereafter appoint an assessor. The owner shall in that event have the right also to appoint an assessor. The assessor, or the assessors jointly, shall assess the value of the said property and shall make a report to the District Court- Should the assessors fail to agree, the District Court shall appoint a third assessor whose decision shall be final. The District Court may determine in each case the period within which the assessment shall be completed. The cost of the valuation shall be paid by the owner of the property.r Captain 0. A.

Cutting from f, Messager de Tehran' regarding the law of ownership by foreigners of agricultural property in Persia. This project was passed into law by the Majlis without alteration of the text on 7th., June, 1931. 2. Copy of Memorandum from Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs regarding ownership by foreigners of immovable property in Persia.Translation. From the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs addressed to His Majesty’s Legation. Dated Tir Mah 19th,1308 (July 10th, 1929) No. 4637. C ircni ar Memorandum. In view of the fact that fcy virtue of treaties foreign subjects have no right to own immovable property in Persian territory, except within the limits required for their residence, trade, or craft; and also, owing to the fact that some foreign subjects have, contrary to the treaties, acquired certain immo vable property, and it is evident that official quarters cannot legally consider them (the foreign subjects) as the owners of such properties; and seeing that the office for Registration of documents and Properties, in spite of the law for the Universal Registration of Land in virtue of which the registration of Inmovable property within Persian territory is obligatory, is at present refusing to accept applications made for registration of immovable properties which have been acquired by foreign subjects in contravention of the stipulations of the treaties; and seeing that should any claim relating to such properties be put forth in the Adiieh (Justice) courts direct, the latter courts cannot legally recognise the foreign subjects as the owners (of the said properties) or give in any way judgments recognising their ownership; notwithstanding the fact that the foreign subjects who have, contrary to the stipulations of tn- trtaties acquired certain immovable properties have themselves acted against their own interests; yet as the Persian Government have always been and are still desirous that as far as possible foreign subjects residing in Persia should not sustain losses, therefore the Ministry for Foreign Affairs finds it necessary »rm» the fact that a period of one year is given to them from t memorandum in order that any of them rtf 1 :he d re sent circularwho, contrary to the provisions of the treaties, may be in possession of immovable properties should, within the said period, transfer the said properties to Persian subjects in any way which they deem advisable and in accordance with interest and expediency. Otherwise at the expiry of the said period, the Government itself will take necessary action with a view to selling the properties in question by auction for the account of the persons concerned.

Will you please therefor^ consult ?'r. Belgrave personally and confidentially on this point and submit a draft Notification which I will se'd h 0 'is Majesty's Government for their approval. The main point to decide is, of course, whether any other country besides Iran should be notified.

A final point arises which, as far as T know, has not yet been considered, i.e. how the sanction for the application of the Property Law is to be legally effected. Since the individuals concerned are foreigners this sanctioij must come from us, presumably from r&lt; new King’s Regulation which will have to be issued under’ Article 70 (b) of the Bahrain Order in Council.

A point arises, which, so far as I know, has not yet been considered, i.e. how sanction for the application of the Property Law is to be legally obtained. Since the individuals affected are foreigners this sanction must derive from us, presumably in the form of a King* s Regulation under Article 70 (b) of the Bahrain Order in Council applying the local Property Law. If this presumption is correct I suggest that a draft King 1 s Regulation may be prepared by the Foreign Office. &gt;■' 3 tdd Lett 5 . I note from the enclosure to India Office Printed Letter No. P.Z.2827/36 dated the 28th April idSG, that it has been agreed that the fee for registration for the purposes of Articles 1 and 2 of the Nationality Law should be fixed at Rupees 25 and that the Foreign Office are preparing a dr&amp;it Amending Order in Council. 6 . With reference to paragraph^ of the India Office letter referred^ to in my paragraph 1 above. I enclose a copy of a draft ^tter which it is proposed to address the Shaikh after personal negotiations. Loch considers, and I agree, that it would be preferable to leave him to write a simple letter of acceptance couched in his own words. 7. Owing tothe necessity of keeping the proposal secret if until the laws are actually brought into force in order to prevent prior mass registration, and the impossibility of preventing leakage should the proposal be communicated to the Shaikh (and through him to his family) at the present stage.the draft laws have not been put before His Excellency# The Adviser, Bahrain Government, has, however, been consulted fully by the Political Agent on his draft laws and my foregoing recommendations relating thereto. I suggest that advantage should be taken of the Shaikh 1 s presence in England during his forthcoming visit to put the matter before His Excellency. As his Adviser will be with him. His Excellency should have no difficulty in replying and I think we can assume that he will raise no difficulties. , The text of the two laws and the k »tv Bahrain Government Notification would then be sent by the bnaik to his representative in Fahrain for immediate promulgation. At the same time His Majesty’s Government would telegraph me repeating Political Agent, Bahrain, that this was being done, and the Political Agent would arrange for the simultaneous publication of the King’s hegulation and Amending Order in Council referred to in my paragraphs 4 and 5 above. taken before the two laws can be brought into force. A. As I have no comments to offer on the two drafts (except that I prefer the alternative text suggested for Clause S (c) of the Nationality Law) His Majesty’s Government will presumably now finally approve of the two drafts.

VI My dear Claueon, ^ ^ In paragraph 3 of our official letter 3 1885/30/91 of the 8th April about the new Bahrain laws respecting nationality and the ownership of real property by foreigners we asked that a. certain interval, say at least two months, should be allowed to elapse between the publication of the j law about property and the intended notification bringing it into force against Persian subjects, and added that a further communication might follow regarding certain aspects of the question as affecting Persian subjects. The present letter is intended to be regarded as the further communication in question. 2. When the suggestion was first put forward in 1935 that the Bahrain Government might retaliate for the treatment of Bahrainis in Persia by placing before a substantial number of the Persian colony in Bahrain the unpleasant alternatives of (a) becoming Bahraini nationals or (b) remaining Persian nationals at the price of registering at the Political Agency and losing the right to own real property, we raised no objection because, leaving aside the expediency of retaliation, there appeared to be nothing in the legislation by which it was proposed that these objects should be attained that it was not perfectly permissible for any State to incorporate in its system of law if it wished to do so. We therefore contented ourselves in the main with purely legal and technical suggestions, only opposing the proposal that there should be discrimination as between British subjects and other foreigners in the matter of the fees to be paid to the Political Agency for registration and urging that safeguards with regard to the forced disposal of real 'Clauson, Bsq. property/0 * a ^' 2. property not less adequate than those contained in the Persian law of June 7th, 1931, regarding the ownership of agricultural property by foreigners should be incorporated in the property law. Our views on these aspects of the question were set out in Ward’s letter JS 4931/762/91 of the 3Cth August, 1935, to you, and the enclosures to that letter. (J, 3. It is, however, necessary, now that the legislation is on the point of cowing into force, to take account of the probable reactions of the Persian Government. v e cannot expect them not to be annoyed, for they are clever enough and suspicious enough to guess that the measures are mainly directed against Persian nationals, even if the reasonable period for which we have asked is allowed, for the sake of appearances, to intervene between the promulgation of the legislation and the 'notification'* of Persian nationals. But owing to the care which has been taken over the drafting of the laws, there is, fortunately, no provision to which they can point as constituting discrimination against Persia or any other country, or as amounting to a breach of any contractual obligation, or even as being, in the abstract, of an unreasonable or oppressive nature. Indeed precedents for many of the provisions are to be found in their own legislation. Provided therefore that no discrimination takes place in fact, we ought not to have any insuperable difficulty in finding an answer to any Persian complaints. 4. This question of discrimination in fact is, however, one with which we feel we ought to deal at this point, especially as we do not seem hitherto to have placed our views on the political aspect of the question on record in writing. The property law is permissive as regards notification, i.e. it leaves it to the discretion of the Bahrain Government whether to 'notify' a foreign Governmentor not. I ' i L^ dS) 3 * w e expressed no objection to this at the time since it is always desirable to make provision for the exceptional case. But in general could not, of course, agree to discrimination taking place against Persia in practice. In other words, if any other Government were brought to our notice or that of the Bahrain Government (especially by the Persian Government) as fulfilling conditions similar to those obtaining in Persia, we should probably be obliged to ask that the government in question should be 'notified 1 *. 5. Whether or not a foreign government fulfils the conditions of the Bahrain law in a question of fact, to be decided in each case on the facts. The Bahrain Government cannot be expected to be acquainted with the laws of all the countries in the world in regard to the ownership of property by foreigners. Moreover many States have different rules according to thcJpersonal characteristics of the foreigner concerned (e.g. whether he is a Moslem or not) and others have different laws in different parts of their territory (e.g. in the United States of America). In any case many States restricting the ownership of property by foreigners may have no nationals in Bahrain, and others again may have no Bahrainis in their territory. 6 . For practical purposes the Bahrain Government would probably meet the required standard of non-discriminif£bn if they were to 'notify** the Government of any country which had been cited and confirmed as fulfilling conditions similar to those obtaining in Persia in the matter of the ownership of real property by foreigners and in which either (a) resident Bahrainis were in practice restricted by the local municipal law in respect of the acquisition and ownership of real property or, alternatively which had (b) nationals resident in Bahrain who, in the absence of 'notification**, would enjoy greater advantages than Persian nationals/# A t ' 1 I nationals. Either condition might prove a sufficient basis for 'notification' from the point of view of meeting Persian complaints cf discrimination. 7. In actual fact, as there are presumably no restrictions on the ownership of real property by Bahrainis in British India or the other Arab States of the Persian Gulf, the only countries which really come into the picture are Saudi Arabia and Iraa. 8 . A copy of 'Regulations in respect of Landed Property in the Hejaz' issued by the Saudi Arabian Government in October 1934 was sent to the India Office under cover of Foreign Office letter i$ 69 8 2/68 49/25 of the 3rd December, 1934* On the 18th January, 1934, the Saudi Arabian Government issued an official communique which was intended to be an interpretation of certain points in the aforementioned regulations and a copy of this communique was sent to the India Office under cover of Foreign Office letter B 1013/4C3/25 of the 13th February 1935. In addition Foreign Office letter E 1461/403/25 of the 8th April, 1935, forwarded a copy of a despatch of the 12th February, 1935, from Ryan, summarising the position generally. 9. The effect of these regulations seems to be that no foreigner, not even a Moslem foreigner, may acquire or own real property in the Hejaz (except that a Moslem foreigner may acquire it for the purpose of converting it into a 'Waqf') but that these restrictions do not apply in other parts of Saudi Arabia. 10. So far as we can ascertain without further reference tc the Embassy in Bagdad, the acquisition and possession of immovable property by foreigners in Iraq is governed by (a) 'The Immovable Property (Consent to Alienation) Proclamation,' No.58 of 1919; and (b) the 'Law for the Registration of Immovable Property in the name of Juristic Persons,' No.34 of 1929. Copies of theforegoing onaetTrent? are enclosed for reedy reference, together with a copy of a despatch No.00/1344 of the 30th September, 1927, from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Colonial Office, which treats of the oueation generally. 11. The position revealed by these documents is semejvGVpt obscure, but seems to be that persons other than M Arabs of the occupied territories' (presumably now 'Iraqi subjects') may not, whether Juridical persons or individuals, acquire real property without the permission of the Viniatry of Finance, which is not however as a rule withheld when the property is required for some legitimate purpose and is situated within the limits of a town or village. 12. 7.’e suggest that it might be prudent for the Bahrain authorities to make enquiries as to the position of the Bahrainis in the Hejaz (if any) or Iraq in regard to the ownership of real property. We will r?t the same time ask His K&amp;jenty'e Representatives at Jedria and Bagdad whether they (or the Consul at Basra) have any information on the subj ect. Yours ever, (Sgd.)

Sir, I have had under consideration your despatches Nos. 3, 26 and 40 of the 6th January, the 29th January and the 12th February respectively, regarding the recent Saudi Regulations on the subject of the ownership by foreigners of real property in Hejaz. 2. The explanatory communique issued by the Saudi Government (a translation of which was enclosed in your despatch No. 26 of the 29th January), and the record of your Bey conversation with Fuad/Hamza ^as reported in paragraphs 7 and 8 of the memorandum enclosed in your despatch No. 40 of the 12th February), suggest that there is now less danger of a rigorous and inequitable application of these regulations. Should, however, the Saudi authorities proceed against British subjects or protected persons who have been suffered in the past to acquire ownership of land in the Hejaz despite their foreign nationality (class (1) in paragraph 6 of your above- mentioned memorandum), I fear that it will not be possible to do more than to urge in their favour the general tolerance which, in default of direct evidence or of written permission, must presumably have existed to make the acquisition possible, and in the last resort to press for a reasonable opportunity for them to sell their land under equitable conditions. The regulations themselves do not expressly refer to the case of\iL persons who have been suffered in the past to acquire ownership of land in the hejaz, but as pointed out in paragraph 3 of my despatch No. 446 of the 11th December, 1934, it would presumably be open to the Saudi Government to maintain that such ownership was contrary to the law as reaffirmed in article 4 of the regulations. At the same time their contention would surely be weakened by the fact that 'previous Governments” in the form of the Ottoman and Hashimite regimes did in fact tolerate the acquisition of land by Indian and other Moslem 'foreigners”. I am unfortunately not in possession of any information which would answer the enquiry at (b) in paragraph 3 of your despatch No. 3 as to the attitude adopted under the Hashimite regime towards the ownership of land by foreign i.ioslems, but it appears at least to have been tolerated since cases have survived into the present regime. 3. As regards the case of British subjects or protected persons in class (II) in paragraph 6 of your memorandum, viz., those owning land in the Hejaz, who at the time of acquisition were Ottoman subjects, but who have subsequently become aliens vis-a-vis the Saudi State ( e.g . Palestinians and Cypriots), it would not be possible to invoke the Treaty of Lausanne since the Eejaz did not become a party to it and the Saudi Government are clearly under no obligation to observe its provisions. The most that could be done on behalf of this class of person v;ould be to insist on their obtaining a fair and reasonable opportunity to dispose of their land, such as the regulations themselves appear to allow. It now seems possible, however, from paragraph 3 of the translation of the Saudi communique enclosed in your despatch No. 26 that these persons will be allowed to retain their properties indefinitely, subject to the tax imposed by article 11 of the regulations. 4. I assume from telegram imo. 7 of the 16th February from the High Commissioner for Transjordan to the Secretary of-3- State for the Colonies (repeated to .you as telegram No. 4) that the position of the Hashimite properties has now been satisfactorily settled, and that there is no longer any danger of the regulations being applied in their case.

JE 1461/403/257 Do. 1. A.ijyan to Sir John Simon — (Beceived Earch 4. ) (Do.40.) Jedda, February 12, 1935. Sir, miiTi reference to my despatch No.26 of the 29th January, I have the honour to state that on the 6th February I discussed at some length with Fuad Bey Hamza the effect of the Saudi regulations on real property promulgated last October, and of the interpretative communique of the 18th January. as this discussion was ol a general nature, exploratory on my part and explanatory on the part of Fuad Bey, I do not think it necessary to record it in detail. The principal tning that emerged from it was that Fuad Bey, who had nothing to do with the promulgation of the regulations, is greatly embarrassed and has been trying uo make the best of a bad job. His conversations with the foreign representatives, several of whom have shown interest in the subject, may encourage him to make a further effort to undo the mischief wrought by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and others in his absence. 2. Another fact of some importance which emerged from my conversation with Fuad Bey is that the Saudi Government have made the mess, in^o v^nich they have got themselves by their ill- considered legislation, still messier by trying to import into it conceptions and one or two terms derived from the former Ottoman legislation on one particular kind of property, viz., Government or 'Miri' land. This was, as you are aware, the subject of elaborate Turkish legislation,(see Young’s Corps de-a- an Droit ottoman , Yol.VI, p.45 ff.), which defined the quasi- proprietorial rights of private occupants oi land, the fundamental ownership of which was vested in the State. It dealt, inter alia, with the nature of the titles, which occupants could acquire. I do not know whether that legislati was ever applied in the Hejaz, but there is certainly no machinery now in existence in this country which could give effect to its principles, even il tne position as regards the legal character of all titles were not, as Fuad Bey confessed to me, hopelessly confused. 3. I have embodied a snort general account of my conversation with Fuad Bey in paragraph 7 of the enclosed memorandum, which I have thought it advisable to circulate to the posts indicated in it, in view of the repercussions of this question in various directions. 4. As the enclosed memorandum brings the whole situation up to date, and as the special question of Hasnimite properties is now tne subject of separate telegraphic correspondence, I am not sending copies of this covering despatch to any other British authority. I have, &amp;c. AifDEEW KYAh. Enclosure in No.l Iviemorandum by Sir Andrew Ryan on Foreign Cnnersnip of neal Property in the Heiaz . TBE Saudi regulations on real property, which were mentioned in paragraph £41 of the Jedda report for October and have been referred to in later reports, have proved to be of wider interest tnan was anticipated. I am therefore circulating this general account of the matter for the benefit of tne above posts, although some of them are already fully or partly aware of the facts.-3- 2. The regulations in question were published in two instalments in tne Umm-al-Q,ura of the 19th and 26th October last. They reasserted the principle that no foreigner may acquire real property in the Hejaz, subject to a relaxation already admitted by Regulations promulgated in 1931 and reincorporated with slight alterations of form only in the regulations now in question. This relaxation was that a foreign Moslem could acquire property for tne sole purpose of converting it simultaneously into a Wakf, but only a Wakf, for the perpetual benefit of Moslems in the Hejaz. 3. What was really new in the regulations was the provision regarding persons who had acquired their property as Ottoman subjects but who had become aliens vis-a-vis Saudi Arabia. Such persons were required to sell their property to a Saudi subject or to convert it into Wakf, as above, within one year and were deprived, by an ooscurely worded article, of the right of disposal m the meantime. It was provided that the period might be prolonged on application to the Government, subject to tne payment of a tax of lb per cent, per annum of the income from the property during any extended period allowed. Foreigners inheriting property were similarly required to sell it to a Saudi or convert into Wakf. 4. The basic principle tnat foreigners may not acquire real property in the Hejaz was incorporated in an Ottoman Law of 186V, the famous 'Law of Sefer,' which conferred on foreigners the right to hold real property in the Ottoman Empire, except in the Hejaz, subject to their Governments adhering to an instrument known as the Protocol of Sefer. The principle has more than once in the recent past been reasserted by the Saudi authorities. In itself it cannot be contested on any ground of international law or special treaty enabling British subjects to acquire real property in the Kejaz. Nevertheless two classes of question arise, as follows:--4- (a) In practice many British subjects and protected persons were in tne past allowed to acquire property qua Moslems. Can they now be deprived ol' rights which they acquired by tolerance under previous regimes? (b) Many persons who were Ottoman subjects and nad tnere_Lore a clear legal ngnt to acquire property are now subjects oi States other than Saudi Arabia which have emerged from the ruin oi tne Cttoman Empire. Can they now be compelled to part with their property? And, if not protected in any other way, are they protected by article 23 of the Treaty of Lausanne? 5. Arising out oi earlier correspondence regarding the regulations, I drew the further attention of His Majesty's Government to the questions at (a) and (b) above in a despatch i. o.3 of tne bth January. Shortly after I had done so, the Saudi Government issued a communique dated the 18th January, which was by way of remedying the grievances created by the regulations of last October, which it purported not to amend but to interpret. The main points in this communique were as follows;- (a) The regulations rested on a basis of Islamic principle applicable only to the^ejaz, not to other parts of Saudi Arabia. (b) The Government were considering possible legislation to enable foreigners to hold Government ('Miri') property 'by way of long lease and other proper Sharia means.' (c) The Government did not wish to tahe retroactive measures against persons, now aliens, who, as Ottoman subjects, had acquired property underthe Turlcisn regime or persons who had acquired it under the Hashimite regime. It had therefore given them tne right of applying for an extension of the period of one year. 6. This communique has not placated the interested foreign missions, least of all perhaps the Iraqi Legation, wnicnapart from its general mteresx, is specially interested in the case of tne properties owned by members of the Hashimite family. Certain restrictions on the exercise of their rights by memoers of that family were removed in l^CC and it is now suggested that the regulations oi last Cctober m^r undo the effect of that removal of restrictions. 7. I discussed the whole subject unofficially with Fuad Bey Hamza on the 6th February. He admitted that the article in the regulations which deprives owners oi the right of disposal oi their properties pending sale or conversion into Wakf was badly worded and said that it did not mean that they could not let their property. He said that the provision of the communique mentioned at (c) in paragraph 5 above was intended to be promissory, i.e., that if applications were made for an extension of time they would be granted, and granted for an indefinite period. He admitted that the special 15 per cent, tax remained in force. He was vague on various minor points I raised, including the unfortunate political effect of the action of the Government in so far as it might affect the interests of tne Hashimites. Incidentally he admitted that the state of tenures in the Hejaz was hopelessly confused and that, though the law refers to Government or T, Miri lT property, which was the subject of important Turkish legislation, it would be very hard to say what the tenure of any property was. 8. Fuad Bey made no secret of the fact that he disapproved of the regulations, which were promulgated in his absence. He\ -6- told me that he had had them by him for a long time, but had always been unwilling to see them promulgated both for economic and political reasons. He has had to face so much criticism by the foreign representatives, although I do not think that any mission has taken the matter up officially as yet, that he may make a further effort to remedy thesischief. In any case, I am inclined to think that Ibn Saud would find some means of meeting the special grievance of the Hashimites, but at present those of the family who are not Saudi subjects are in the same position as other ex-Cttoman owners of property.

Similar letter sent to Colonial Office.234/136/8) (E 968/403/25) i Sir, with reference to my despatch No.3 of 6th January, relative to the recent Saudi legislation on real property in the Hejaz, I have the honour to forward herewith a translation of a communique of 18th January, which the Saudi Government circulated officially to the foreign missions here on the same date and which was published in the 'Umm-al- otura” on 24th January. It purports to interpret the regulations promulgated last October and is obviously intended to have a reassuring effect. I believe it to be the work ol Fuad Bey Hamza, who was away when the regulations were issued and on his return realised that they were too drastic. Fu a d Bey told me himself on 21st January that the communique was one of the fruits of his labours at Riyadh and claimed that it removed every objection to the regulations. I hope to discuss the matter more fully with him when he next comes to Jedda, but in the meantime I think the position is that he has had to compromise with the authors oi the regulations. Tne result is not very satisfactory for the reasons stated in the following paragraphs. 2. hub-paragraphs (1) and (2) of the communique deal with the acquisition of property by foreigners. The former reaffirms the principle that, so far as the Hejaz and the Hejaz only is concerned, foreigners are precluded from acquiring property. The following sub-paragraph foreshadows some measure of relief for foreigners, who are Moslems, but Right Honourable Sir John Simon, GGSI., KCVO., etc.^ Q 2 ' (W) vIV but it contemplates only measures to enable such foreigners to possess Government owned property e.g., under long leases. Both sub-paragraphs represent the attitude of the Government as being in conformity with Shari'a law but, so far as I am aware, that law as such does not preclude any Moslem from acquiring property in the Hejaz in full ownership. In any case, the communique does not meet the difficulty of foreigners, who, being Moslems, were allowed in the past to acquire property, despite the provisions of the Ottoman law of 1867. 5. Sub-paragraph 3 of the communique deals with properties owned by persons who, at the time of acquisition, were Ottoman or Hashimite subjects and were therefore entitled to own property, not only under the Shari*a but under the former civil law. It holds out to the owners a hope of favourable consideration of applications under Article 11 of the recent regulations and this is probably intended as a definite promise. It is not, however, so worded. Moreover, it does not set aside the rule in Article 8, which appears to limit the right of the foreign owner to the full enjoyment of his property pending sale to a Saudi subject or conversion into Wakf or the rule in Article 11 itself that a special tax of 15^ of the income from the property must be paid during any period of grace allowed. 4. I hope to be able to report further on the subject when I have been able to discuss it more fully with Fuad Bey Hamza. In the meantime I would advert to two papers which have reached me since I wrote my despatch under reference. 5. The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India wrote me a despatch on 24th December, No.F. 366-N/34, a copy of which has presumably been communicated to you by the India Office. This despatch crossed a copy of my despatch under/u nder reference, which to some extent answered it. I am endeavouring to form an idea of the scale on which Indians own real property, although I foresee great difficulty in obtaining exact information. You are doubtless considerin^ representations are to be made, they should be made in concert by all the Governments whose nationals are affected. For myself, I may say that, while I try to Keep in touch 6 . You have probably been furnished also with a copy of a confidential despatch No.TC/l2o/o4 of 2&lt;dnd December , addressed by His Majesty's High Commissioner for Transjordan to the Colonial Office regarding the effect of the Saudi regulations in regard tc Hashimite properties. It will be remembered that in the early summer of 1933, Ibn oaud removed the restrictions previously imposed on the enjoyment of their properties in this country by members of the Hashimite family, with one exception. For several years before that decision was taken, His Majesty's Government were consistently unwilling to intervene officially in the matter out, having regard to the instructions given to me at the time, I am assuming that there can be no objection to my sounding Fuad Bey personally and cautiously on the question whether the regulations of last October and the enclosed communique apply to Hashimite properties. I am inclined to think that Ibn Saud will find means to treat their case as one apart. 7 . I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosuie to His Excellency the Viceroy of India (Foreign and Political Department), His Excellency the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Singapore, and to His Majesty's High Commissioner for Transjordan, Jerusalem. the suggestion of the Government of India that, if any with my colleagues in regard to such matters of common interest, I prefer separate action in the conditions prevailing here.

It has been observed that the object of tne provisions of the Regulations concerning the possession of landed property in the Hejaz issued on 29th Jumad-ath-Thani 1353 (8th October, 1934) has been misinterpreted. The Governmen therefore find it necessary to explain its object and scope and to define its mode of application. 1. The fundamental reason which caused the Government to prohibit foreigners fnm possessing landed properties in the Ilejaz was the establishment of a position which has continued to be respected from the beginning of Islam and the observance of the rules of the holy Shari 1 a, so as to put the Islamic holy country in a position of security against its passing into the hands of foreigners. Consequently the districts that come under the provisions of the said Regulations are the territories of the Hejaz within its boundaries as recognized by the holy Shari'a; but, in the territories of His Majesty the King, other than the Hejaz, the freedom of possessing landed properties by foreigners is not governed by the provisions of the Regulations concerning the possession of landed property in the Hejaz. 2. In addition to the facilities allowed to foreigners under the provisions of the regulations concerning the possession of landed property, as regards their ability to dedicate the landed property for perpetual charitable purpose, the Government of His Majesty the King contemplate giving consideration to a proposal for a regulation enabling the foreign Muslims to secure the enjoyment of Government landed properties located in the areas v/here it is prohibited for foreigners to possess landed properties, that is by way of long lease and other proper Shari’a means.3. Inasmuch as many individuals, who were Ottoman subjects, have possessed, during the time of the Ottoman Government landed properties in the Hejaz, as ttere was no prohibition except in case of non-Ottomans of that time, and others have likewise possessed some landed properties in the time of the Hashimite Government; and, as immediately alter the decline of the Ottoman Government many of the landlords have Decome foreigners under the Law of Nationality 01 Sa'uai Arabia; and as the Governmental His Majesty do not desire to make the provisions of the new Regulations retioactive; as ohey do not desire to deprive those people, who acquired (their properties) by legal ways, of their legal rights acquired under the provisions of Regulations duly observed during the time of the Ottoman and the Hashimite Governments, the Government of His Majesty have assured to ouch persons the freedom of enjoying the landed properties belonging to them in a legal way under Article XI of the said Regulation. The Government declare that they accord to such persons the right to apply for extension of their enjoyment of their landed properties provided they apply for the same. 13th Shawwal 1353 (Sealed) Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 18th January, 1935.NO DISTRIBUTION.

Effect of real property regulations has been somewhat mitigated by a recent communique on which I have reported by despatch. Language of communique is unsatisfactory but FUAD HAMLA assured me on February 6th that intention was to grant application under Article 11 of regulation automatically and for an indefinite period. Even so, regulations if enforced strictly, would compel Hashimites to make application under Article 11 and to pay 15 per cent tax on income. I agree His Majesty^ Government should adhere to past policy of not intervening officially, but I can see no objection to my supporting Iraqi representative to the extent of making informal representations. Indeed when discussing general position of foreign ownership with FUAD HAMZA on February 6th I drew his attention to political undesirability of applying measures which might spoil the eiiect of Ibn Saud ! s gesture in favour of Hashimites in 1933. This action was based on correspondence ending with your telegram No.49 of 1933. It would in my opinion be useful if I were given discretion to continue to use my influence discreetly, whilst leaving matters mainly in the hands of my Iraqi colleague with whom I am keeping in touch.

No Bahrain subjects are known to ovm real property in the Kejaz and therefore,in my opinion, the question of reciprocal action in connection with the Ilejaz does not occur. A very few Bahrain subjects own property in Iraq but I understand that no action has been taken by the Iraq Government affecting their property and as no complaints have been made to the Bahrain Government about the pro perty of its nationals in that country, I suggest that no action should be taken in the case of Iraq. ^ _ adviser to the Government.C-QflFIDfcailAL No* C/558-1*a/24 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 17th July 13S7* From Captain T.

INDIA OFFICE, 17th June, 1937. ;ir lb I am directed Dy the Secretary of State for India to forward for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, a copy of an Express Letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, regarding the disposal of the fees levied in accordance with Article 3 of the Bahrein (Amendment) Order in Council, 1937- 2. The Marquess of Zetland presumes that some direction should now he given to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf regarding the deduction of a certain percentage of the fees levied, and that the concurrence of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury in the terms of this direction should he obtained. No information is available which would enable His Lordship to calculate the actual percentage v/hich it will be necessary to deduct in order to cover the cost of administration; nor does it appear that such a calculation would in any case be possible except in the light of experience. He would accordingly suggest for the consideration of Mr. Secretary Eden that Their Lordships should be invited to concur in the issue of a direction to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the effect that he should deduct such percentage of the fees as may from time to time be required for meeting the expenses of administration, such as the payment of any extra personnel in the Political Agency, and that the balance of the fees should be handed to the Bahrein Government. r ‘ Secretary of State, gn Office, • W.l. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,Li* -y 3ai) Bushire Printed Letter No.1169 dated the 4th June 1933. Complaint by the Persian Government of the ill-treatment of Persian subjects resident in Bahrain. P. A. Persian Government’s complaints embodied in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the note of the Persian Foreign Minister are:- 1. The British Adviser did not give permission to Persian subjects to enter Bahrain and declared that it would be given after a month’s time. 2. The British Adviser fined a certain Muhammat Aii Gulshan one hundred rupees for being in possession of half a bottle of cognac. 3. British Consul (P.A.) bound over Meshedi Hussein and Meshedi Abbas of Kazeruni and Brothers not to frequent one another’s society at night. /. Under the Bahrain Government Passport regula tions in force Persian subjects arriving in Bahrain are dealth with in the same manner as other foreign nationals and British subjects. No one is allowed to land in Bahrain without a proper visa for Bahrain The specific c se referred to by His Highness the Persian Foreign Minister in which Persians were not given permission by the Adviser to land in Bahrain is not known to us, but taking a general view of the case those who were not permitted to land could not have been in possession of p visa for Bahrain. The facts were fully explained by His Britannic Majesty’s Minister^ in paragraph 7 ofwmmrnm 3 his note dated 24th September 1932 to the facilities given to Persians by the Bahrain Government. Perhaps Adviser will be able to enlighten you on the subject matter of above complaint, if there had been any such case as referred to by the Persian Government. 2. Criminal Case No. 439 of 1932 which is herewith submitted will give you the -facts of the complaint ';o. 2. The fine of Hs. 100 imposed on Muhammad Ali Gulshan was on a charge of smuggling a bottle of BAA^iDY the import of which is strictly prohibited. It would appear from your judgement passed imt the above case that you let the accused off with a light punishment taking the facts into consideration that he was s stranger in Bahrain and that his mother was ill. Perhaps you are aware that British subjects in Persia are severely dealt with for slight offences s nee the abolition of capitulations^* surely Persian Government has no cause to complain of reciprocal treatment of their subjects in foreign countries especially when the offender wxx in question'received a lenient punishment. 3. I have enquired about this^complaint from tne vernacular office where no such case seems to have been registered. Perhaps the Adviser could throw some light on this subject pi ease.

P.A . 1. The question of the nationality of persons born in Bahrain of foreign parents was raised by Colonel Barrett, Letter c/18 of 31-1-1929;for purposes of the Bahrain Order in Council and the Political Resident directed that persons Letter Wo:354 of 10-2-29; born in Bahrain of foreign parents unless registered at the Agency,should be treated as Bahrain subj ects. 2, On receipt oi this decision the P.A issued a notice on the 27-2-1929 and the Bahrain Government an *alan on the same date embodying the P.R f s decision. 3. As a result of these two notices several ’Iraqis registered the births of their children who were born in Bahrain. ^ P- 3 t- 4. The Bahrain Government »alan was republished on the __ p n 30th March 1933 and the Agency Notice was republished on the 10th April 1933. ^ 5, Wo provision for such registrations exists in the Bahrain Order in Council. The P.A is a 'Registrar of Births and Deaths'under the Births,Deaths and Marriages Registration Act,1886,which was extended to Bahrain by King’s Regulation No:l of 1922. Under the Act of 1886, he is only empowered to act in respect of British . ^ 6 . The registration ot British subjects is governed by 'The Bahrain (Amendment) Order in Council,1922'. In August 1931^the Government of India ruled that the term 'British No:F 0 132-N/31 of 1-8-31; subject' includes a 'British Protected person' and directed that in future the latter class of persons should be registered in addition to 'British*10 (0. i subjects' proper. c Tile ■ Politica l Resident represented the matter to Letter tfo:1762 of 1931.:the Government of India pointing out that there was a very large floating population in Bahrain and that their registration would present serious difficulties. He recommended that registration should be confined to British subjects as heretofore. No reply from the Government of India is traceable. 8 . At present only British subjects and subjects of Indian States are registered in the Agency under the Order in council. 3, $ fa 0. ^ A U ^ /e (?)

Registration of British Subjects is carried out under 'The Bahrain (Amendment) Order-in-Council,1922' dated the 1st April 1922. 4. For purposes of registration under 3 above,the term ’British subject’ includes ’British Protected Persons subjects of Indian States’ but does not include other ’British Proected Persons* in view of the difficulty that would be involved in establishing a person’s claim to British protection. 5. The following Acts and Orders are in force in regard to the registration of births and deaths of persons to whom the Order in Council applies (i). The Births,Deaths and Ferriages Act,1886. (ii). Agency Proclamations of 27-2-19‘ :5 9^nd 10-4-1933 Pszfnfo (^i).

The Act of 1586 applies to pure British subjects end the Notices and Alans of 1929 and 1933 apply to foreign ers „ 7. For purposes of Registration of B- 5 rths, Rri ti sh SHbjects.may /be divided into the three following categories:I Z(i) (*)- Pure British Subjects. (t;. British Protected Persons,svbjsets of Indian States. (c). Other British Protected persons. (• Births occurring in the families of Persons in Category (a) are registered under the provisions of the Act of 1886. (ii). Births occurring in the families of Persons under pategcry (b) cannot be registered, even though the pa-rents are registered under the Order-in-Council,but the Child can be registered as a British Prejected Person in accordance ^ ^ ‘i (U. 1%2&gt;) vith the instructions received under Secretary’ c Endorsement ^ Pi (hX zti) Fo:P389 dated the 2nd December 1924. (iii'. Persons ^ailing under Category (c) are not register- ed and,therefore,their children cannot be registered,without specific orders, 8. It will be observed from the above,therefore,that may be held to include 1}he Alan* of 1929 and 1933/**** 'Other British Protected Persons.,i.e.,those not included under 7(a) and 7(b) above, 9. fihee the isfcue of the Alan of 1929 some ’Iranis ajnd an American Missionary have registered the births of their children. In the case of the Tragis a separate register was opened and a fee of one rupee was charged for the rpgistrtation. The birth of Revd Haklen’s child was wroi o*iv registered in the Register of Births under the Act of 1886, 1C. As they stand,the Agency notices and Bahrain Government Alans are open to question,and in order to regularize the matter,it may be considered uesirable for the Bahrain Government to issue a ’nationality and Kesiucnce T.av ’ which would define Bahrain subjects. As soon as this ras done it could be legalized by the issue o^ a Kind’s Regulation which could be applied under the Order-in-Council to foreigners. 11.
