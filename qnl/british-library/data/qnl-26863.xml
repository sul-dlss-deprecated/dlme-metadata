His Majesty*s Embassy present their compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and have the honour to invite their attention to the following matter. 2. According to a report received from the Koweiti authorities, the local Iraqi authorities at Fao cut down during April and May, about 700 date trees on the properties of the Ruler of Koweit in order to make a road. 3. No intimation seems to have been given to the Ruler of the intention of the Iraqi authorities to act in this manner and the representations which his agent made to them when the work began were disregarded. 4. The Koweiti authorities state that, in addition to the 700 trees cut down, about 350 trees were so seriously damaged that they are expected to die. 5. The Embassy request the Ministry to be so good as to supply them with information concerning the circumstances in which these trees have been destroyed and, if the facts are as stated, would be glad to know what steps the Iraqi authorities concerned propose to take with a view to compensating the Ruler of Koweit for the loss which he has suffered.

My dear Baggallay, Thank you for your letter No. E 6267/28/93 of November 8th about the felling of a number of date trees on property claimed by the Shaikh of Koweit: You will see from a letter from the Ambassador (437/12/38) dated 15th November to Powle, a copy of which has been sent to Baxter, that the Iraqi Government have formed a committee to assess the damage and to determine the compensation to be paid. Provided reasonable compensation is awarded this seems, on the whole, to be a more favourable form of settlement than that suggested in paragraph 7 of your letter (E 5236/28/93) of 15th September and if youragree, I propose now to await the decision of the committee.

I now write to let you know that your assumption was correct. The Embassy would certainly use their discretion in a case of this kind, and would make representations on their own authority if they were satisfied in their own minds that this was the right course, and was not repugnant to the spirit or letter of any instructions already received. 3.

With regard to the merits of the case, nothing in Ward’s statement to Baggallay can get over the fact that the Basrah Port Authorities, without making proper enquiries as to whcmthe land belonged and thereafter approaching the owner for permission, acted in an extremely arbitrary way, the result of which was considerable damage to the Shaikh’s property. 4. de Gaury tells me that on the 27th September Garstin, who was then acting as Director of the Port in Ward’s absence, informed him - de Gaury - that he / I. P. Gibson Esquire, The India Office, London.he - Garstin - had written to the Iraq Ministry of Finance admitting the error of the Port in cutting down the trees in question without authority, in consequi of this the Mutassarrif of Basrah had received instruc tions to form a Committee to assess the amount of compensation which the Port should pay to tne Shanch. The Mutassarrif informed him - Garstin - oi the Committee formation. Garstin showed the correspondence in question to de Gaury. 5. This is satisfactory, hut at the same time m order to keep the local Iraqi authorities up to the mark I think it would he advisable for the Embassy to take the matter up with the Iraq Government.

It is poteiblc that the ;^udir has eoaie kind of standing autho ity to eut down trees r?t his discretion In or» er to mak roads. If so, tae limits within which he should act must heve been laid down, and it aust in particular hftve been specified wheth r or not coiape&amp;s^tlon to the landowner is due. 4 .

He feel here that some action should be taken now if the Sheikh's data is not to go by default. Mo doubt, in nozio&amp;l clrcusBCt&amp;nees, the proper course, if liability to compensation in such cases is admitted,/admitted, would be for the Sheikh to apply for his compene&amp;tion by whatever is the normal procedure. In this case presumably to the Port administration who apparently agree that compensation is payable by them to the owner. In the absence ot dispute, the normal procedure would not, we imagine, be the institution of legal proceedings, but if the authorities were to dispute the Sheikh's title, then the oistter would no doubt have to be decided by the competent court. Alternatively, if the Government disclaim responsibility for the action of their officials, and the Sheikh's remedy is a cleia against the 4udir or Coster, he would have to take the matter to the competent court straight away. We do not of course want to run the risk of the matter coming before a court just when we are getting the Iraqis to apply Land Settlement to the Sheikh's estetes, and the alternative seems to be to take the natter up through the diplomatic channel. If the Sheikh's title is so uncertain that he wo Id be ill- advised to go to court, it would be rather difficult for us to take the natter up on the footing that he hasa clear case for corapeneetion* It would anyway be rather premature to lodge anything like a formal diplomatic claim againpt the Iraqi Govern .ent at this Btage» but we thin* you should nake enquiries as to the position. » rlma facie this would be quite natural, since both the persons involved in the destruction of the trees arc officials of the Iraqi Government. Unless you see objection, therefore, we shall be grateful if you will now draw the attention of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to what has hapnened, end try to find out if they are prepared to pay compens tion; if so, how much; and if not, why not. 7. An alternative, which you raif;ht conri^er, is that the Sheikh should claim compencation as the owner from the Port Authorities, and the latter should reply that they are prepared to pay compensation to the owner ( and perhaps say how much) but cannot pay it to the ciheikh until his ownership is established. Then we could let the matter rest there till the Land Settlement procedure is under way, possibly informing the Iraqi Government of the position and saying that the Sheikh/Sheikh will let the matter rest till his title la confirmed hy the Land Settlement procedure* an then claim* This woulc * of course, only be worth doinfr if you could make sure that the Fort Authorities would in fact be prepared in principle to pay coraoenaation and free to do so and would not disclaim all liability.

The Embassy have not yet sent us their comments on Fowle's express letters C/354 of the 21st June, and 406-S of the 19th July, but I discussed the matter with Sir John Ward of the Port of Basra when he called at the Foreign Office the other day. Ward says (in strict confidence) that the road was urgently needed, and that Coster went ahead when he was told by the Mudir that there was n\^ objection. It would have involved intolerable delay if the permission of the owner had been sought. Ward added^ that the Port authorities did not know that the land in question was claimed by the Sheikh, It apparently lies outside the bund, which the British forces - to Ward*s own recollection — built in 1916, and if it belongs to the/ I RECo. POL. Of Pt ' R.T. Peel, Esq., M.C REflo. ML. DLPt. 1 SEP 1938 IJDIA OFFICE _the Sheikh must certainly have been 'jumped' by him since then and a fortiori since 1914. The Port authorities had always envisaged having to pay compensation to the owner when it was established who it was. Anyway the date palms, which grow in brackish water, are of the poorest variety, do not produce dates fit for export, and can be worth very little. 3. It is possible that the Mudir has some kind of standing authority to cut down trees at his discretion in order to make roads. If so, the limits within which he should act must have been laid down, and it must in particular have been specified whether or not compensation to the landowner is due. 4. If, however, this is not the case, and if the proceedings by the Mudir or Coster, or both, were simply illegal, Iraqi law will presumably provide a remedy, either against the individuals responsible, or possibly (though we doubt if this is likely) against the Government. 5. We agree with you that some action should be taken now if the Sheikh’s claim is not to go by default. No doubt, in normal circumstances, the proper course would be for the Sheikh to apply for his compensation by whatever/ 6116 . » * ' y , 1958whatever is the normal procedure. In the absence of dispute, this would not, we imagine, be the institution of legal proceedings, but if the authorities were to dispute the Sheikh’s title, then the matter would no doubt have to be decided by the competent Court. ,Ye do not of course want the question to come before a Court just when we are getting the Iraqis to agree to apply Land Settlement to the Sheikh’s estate. 6. The alternative to action on these lines is to take the matter up through the diplomatic channel. If the Sheikh’s title is so uncertain that he would be ill- advised to go to Court, it would be rather difficult for us to take the matter up on the footing that he has a clear case for compensation. In any case, it would be rather premature to lodge anything like a formal diplomatic claim against the Iraqi Government, but we see no objection to the Embassy making enquiries as to the position. This would be prima facie quite natural, since both the persons involved in the destruction of the trees are Iraqi officials. If you concur, therefore, we propose/^ ,'f '«&gt; - fl - L^I ^ kJ- ^ ^ ^ “-rjTw ‘t - ^ n «*h* W h 7. u t 4^./ / t propose asking the Embassy to draw the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs at once to what has happened, and try and find out if they are prepared to pay compensation; if so, how much; and if not, why not. 7. I should add with regard to the last sentence but one of your letter that, in our view, if the Sheikh has no valid title to the piece of land concerned, he would be unable to get compensation for the cutting down of the trees, whatever the action now taken to defend his rights.

I immediately went to see Mr. Coster of the Port who denied this, and said that on the contrary he had asked for authority from the Mudir, who had categorically, but only verbally, assured him that there was no objection to the cutting, and that the Shaikh had agreed to it. He, Mr, Coster, had twelve years’ experience at Fao, and was always most careful to do what was correct. On receiving the Mudir *s assurance that he could proceed, he had given the Mudir w a free hand” with accompanied by his son and agent, Shaikh Mohammad The Hon* bis Lieut-Colonel Sir Tren chard Fowle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E,, political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I R 3-2 with the labour arrangements, only assuring himself that the names on the labour roll were of those of aotual men. 4. This arrangement was, he said, not satisfactory. Wark was unduly prolonged and some of the men, were tenants, who were not actually working. He, therefore after a little time, changed the system, took it out of the Mudir’s hands, and made it by contract. There was then a fonn of strike. No one wanted to work. He implied that he was sure that the Mudir was behind this strike. 5. Mr. Coster, eventually, by threatening to bring in outside labour broke the strike. He described the high handedness of the Mudir, who, as I saw for myself had two revolvers strapped to his waist, and Who, he told me, obtaining ammunition from some of his Pont officers, almost daily lets off rounds in the air, to encourage working parties, emphasize his remarks, and so on. He thougit that the Mudir was a little mcd, and that association with the late Censral Bekr Sidqi in the Hammar Late operations had helped to turn his head. 6 . However that may be it seems to me extraordinary that the Mudir should not have obtained written sanction from the Shaikh for the extensive cutting of trees, or if he felt he had the power to do so, issued a written order or instruction on the s\i)jeet. With Mr. Coster I visited the places where trees had been out, and X wes also shown the water round many trees in spoil ditches made by the Mudir, which standing water will soon kill Ihe trees, unless it is piped away. Mr. Coster said he realized this, and wished to put in pipes but the Mudir forbade it. 7. in the case of the Qasr section he told Mr. Coster, so the latter said, that work having finished at Bungalow and Qishla, he would like to level offlevel off 'the Shaikh** roai' to the ^a*r. There wa* t as Mr. Coater understood it f no question of outting trees, but he did in fact out son* 180 from the right side of the road, where the trees belonged, not, as on the left aide of the read, to the Ta*ab, but to the Shaikh. 8 . HaJi AhJoad as-salim, the Mudir, was employed at Vho and at Siba in the pact, and my predecessor Colonel !4or© had some years ago to ta'i® active steps, and visit the shaikh’s estates, to counter his machination there, and he has, according to Coster, given It out that he has beaten the Shailch onoo, end will do bo again. This is I presume is a threat to obtain money, blackmail in fact, and the shaikh’s son tells me that he felt it wise to give him £30, since the cutting, and bos promised him Rs. 1,000/- perlodiceHJ 9. as Coster was only on the 18th quite unnecessarily prevented by the Mudir from building some small works in connection with incinerators in the village, this 'hush money' seems fc&gt; have started working successfully, 10 . Coster himself also constantly referred to the MUdir as having now been shown as plotting to 'squeeze the lemon', Coster being the lemonJ 11 . I refrain from adding more unpleasant details. A change of Mu dir would appear advantageous, and Coster, whose letter of explanation, in reply to that of the shaikh’s lawyer (a copy of which he showed m® but which has not yet readied me) does not agree with his verbal explanation to me, should I think be warned to be more careful in future. With the memory of difficulties in which he involved us all in 1936 - see your telegram No.T/43, doted TUtfait, 26th April 1936, fresh inhis memory, and his twelve years* experience, he would I think have been wise to distrust the uudir more tte* he appears to have dome.

An immediate and personal telegraphic request was made to the Mutasarrif of Basra, to stop the cutting, but the work was carried out swiftly by large gangs of coolies and seems to have bee i completed by the time the Mutasarrif *s counter ordo? if any had reached the Mudir. Some 1000 trees have been cut or ruined and a detailed report is being submitted to the authorities concerned.^73 199. RELATIONS WITH IRAQ # There are indications that these are slightly on the mend, as the following will show: (a) The Rulers son Shaikh Mohamed al Ahmad, who is now in residence at Pao having 'been put in charge of his father’s gardens, seems to he making excellent progress both in his relations with the fellaheen and with Government officials: He is now his father’s sole Agent since the dismissal of Mr. Agoob Gabriel. The latter, there can be no doubt now believed in the old adage of ’’divide and rule' and seems to have done his best to ’’queer relations’’ between the Shaikh and the Mutasarrif and the Shaikh and his fellaheen. In the process he would appear also to have come out very well financially himself* the Shaikh having lost over a lac of rupees in litigation since he employed Mr. Gabriel, and got practically no rentals into the bargain, especially in 1935* (b) Seyed Hamid Beg al Naqib would appear to be “fathering” Shaikh Mohamed in no uncertain fashion, and with his wide experience as landlord of extensive estates in Basra, to be giving the Boy wise advice. Already he has taken Shaikh Mohamed to see the Mutasarrif at Basra, and pleasant letters have passed between Seyed Hamid, the Shaikh and the Mutasarrif. (c) The Shaikh told the writer on 26.10.35- that he was making a great effort especially by means of his old friend Seyed Hamid Beg al Haqib to bring about better relations between himself and Iraq, and urged me to further his efforts towards this end by every means in my power. He added that if only Iraq would treat him better, and appreciate his point of view more generously he for his part had many ways of showing his gratitude. It was a 'trait” of his, he said, to repay a person who did him a kindness, by a double kindness, so why not to a Government doing the same. It is early perhaps to buoy oneself up with hopes in this matter, but signs are not wanting that persons on both sides are working for a better understanding. ^(cj On 23rd July, the Shaikh was informed by Mr. Gabriel, his lawyer and estate agent in Basra, that the Mutasarrif had made an official written demand for the sum of I.D.7500/- hemg &lt;^|jl 'taxation due', it was said, from the Shaikh's gardens in the Fao Nahiya. As it was not made clear what this fresh demand for taxation represented, the Shaikh was advised by the writer to get his lawyer to enquire officially from the inutasarrif as to how exactly the demand had been arrived at. Furthermore, as the Shaikh's gardens are free from all taxation' under His Majesty's Government's guarantee of 1914, the Shaikh was also advised to resist the demand until reference had been made to His Majesty's Government. full report has been made to Bushire, of this surprising new attempt to 'get at' the Shaikh - more especially as H.E. Nuri Pasha on his recent visit to London promised that as soon as he returned to Iraa he would set about the question of seriously getting the Iraq Government to confirm the Shaikh's 'title' to the 5 properties on the Shatt al Arab, exempted by His Majesty's Government from taxation for ever in 1914. It is not without significance that Nuri Pasha was in Basra in the latter part of July, and just about the time •when the Mutasarrif sent in this fresh demand.enclo..

The Embassy were inclined to think that the Iraqi contention was reasonable, and the Foreign Office had sorae trouble in explaining to them the position under international law, under which foreign sovereigns are entitled to bring actions as plaintiff in the Courts of another State in spite of the fact that they cannot be sued as defendant, owing to their exemption from jurisdiction. We hoped, however. that the whole question had been disposed of since it was subsequently ruled by the Iraqi Minister of Justicem j? 2 (flag B) that it was unnecessary for the Sheikh’s lawyer to have sent the Power of Attorney to the Ministry of Justice for endorsement, and the Power of Attorney was thereupon presented and accepted hy the Court without objection. In spite of this the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs have returned to the charge and enquired how the question of service of judicial documents on the Sheikh now stands, and whether the Sheikh still insists on his refusal to accept service, and since the Iraqis have now repeated their enquiry in writing it is necessary to send instructions to the Embassy as to how they should reply. Mr. Helm^sent over a draft telegram of instructions to Baghdad for our concurrence. I have drafted a reply to Mr. Helm suggesting certain amendments which are, I think, self explanatory.Draft Paper.

Mr* Lloyd has already informed the Land registry that no authentication of the agent's Bower of Attorney is required, and that if there were any doubt regard ing Colonel uia&amp;san’s seal and signature, he would elucidate it personally. This, I understand, is in accordance with estab lished practice. Ho reference has, in fact, Been &amp;ade to Judge Lloyd, and so far as he is aware, the Power of Attorney has been accepted. 7. Mr. Brower is at a loss to understand the purpose of the note from the Ministry of April 9th, unless it may be regarded as the prelude to an Instruction to the Land ogistry in Bagdad to the effect that the lower of Attorney is not to be accepted without the inis try 1 a approval. He adds that there would be no legal justification for such a step. On the other hand, as you are aware, the Government feel very strongly that the privilege which is now being claimed on behalf of the shaikh of Kuwait la one sided and unfair. a.

The Ministry for Foreign Affairs present their compli ments to His Britannic Majesty’s ISmbassy, Bagdad, and, with reference to the Embassy’s note No. 721 dated 11th December, 1954, have the honour to state that a power of attorney signed by the Shaikh of Kuwait has been submitted to the Ministry of Justice for authentication. In this power of attorney the ohaikh appoints solicitor Agob Gabriel as his agent with full powers to enable him to safeguard his property, except however, the power to accept service. This means that under this power of attorney the agent cannot accept service on behalf of his client, on whom service will have to be effected through the diplomatic channel* As the Embassy must be aware, from the contents of the Ministry’s note No. 8037 dated 21st October, 1934, addressed to the Charg6 d’Affaires, the Shaikh has refused to accept service even through diplomatic channels. This refusal on the part of the Shaikh results in obvious ham to the interests of Iraqi subjects. It has therefore become a requirement of justice to postpone the authentication of this power of attorney until the question of effecting service on the Shaikh is settled. It is neither fair nor just that \ he should have the right of instituting legal action against others while, on the other hand, he refuses to stand in the position of defendant.

S.W.l. 15th February f 1935, My dear Bateman, We are most grateful for the explanation, contained in your letter of the 30th January, of the position regarding the Power of Attorney of the agent of the Sheikh of Koweit. 2. It is clear that we rauat, for the moment, leave this matter for local treatment, and we much hope that you will be able to dispose of it in some satisfactory way. You will of course remember that the present postponement of the Fao cases expires on the 28th February and before its expiry you will no doubt take steps, if necessary, to secure a further postponement. 3. We do not for the moment wish to express any definite view on your suggestion (see last sentence of paragraph 6 of your letter) that it may be better, after the Fad&amp;aghiyah case has been settled, to revert to the pre-Faddaghiyah procedure. Indeed we could only do so after consultation with the India Office. Provided however that the Iraqi Government and the Iraqi courts admit (1) the ordinary principles of international law as regards the immunity of foreign sovereigns from the jurisdiction, and (2) that the Sheikh of Koweit is a foreign sovereign, we are provisionally inclined to think/ C. H. Bateman, Esq., M.C(£3 think that in future both we and the Sheikh miwht do well to admit that there is an exception to this mile as that, in future proceedings which fall strictly within this category, the Sheikh should not endeavour to put up a probably useless plea of iminunity from the jurisdiction. The exception would not however cover claims by his tenants or employees working on his gardens for their wages or anything of that kind. If these people should have grievances they would have to take them up through the diplomatic channel and not tljrough the courts. 4. Even so, we feel that we must go on hammering at or the Iraqi courts to take the line that, oecause the Sheikh has not submitted to the jurisdiction in a case which comes within the exception, they will obstruct him in some action which he brings as plaintiff. It is entirely The Iraqi courts are perfectly well able to proceed with actions involving the title to land, i.e. those coming within i the exception, even if the Sheikh were wrongly to plead immunity and refuse to accept the documents served on him, by adopting suitable rules such as the courts of nearly all countries have for Substituted service” where it is impossible to serve a defendant in the ordinary way. This instead of interfering with other quite distinct actions. Yours sincerely, (3d) A. K. Helm. regards actions involving a title to land in Iraq, and the point that it is entirely wrong for the Iraqi Government improper for the Iraqis to connect the two things in this way. is the manner in which they ought to deal with this pointCONFIDENTIAL.

S.YM 7th January, 1935. cent by air w wu My dear Laithwai te , in accordance with your request, I write to give you a brief statement of our provisional views on the enclosures in your official letter No.P.Z.7724/24 of the Eoth December about the Fao estates of the sheikh of Koweit. 2. This correspondence appears to show that it had been the practice of the sheikh to issue a power of Attorney in each particular case as it arose, and that this arrangement worked satisfactorily. The recent difficulties may well have arisen from the issue by the Sheikh of a general power of Attorney and from its terms. 3. Humphrys has, as you know, secured the postponement of the Fao cases until the 28th February, It seems doubtful however whether the general question of the date gardens can be disposed of before that date, and we have been wondering whether it might not be possible/ Laithwaite, Hsq., C.I.E.possible to arrive at some arrangement whereby the Fao oases can proceed in advance ol a settlement o^. the general question. It seems to us that a possible ooi- se, unless too much damage has already been done, would oe xOi the sheikh to seek to return to his previous practice of issuing individual powers of Attorney, and to withdraw the general one. In that event the sheinii would have to issue a Power of Attorney for each particular matter, and where it was a case of bringing an action as plaintii- he would have to authorise his agent to receive seivice of legal documents relating, but of course relating only, to the particular action v/hich he wished to bring. \, r e do not of course know whether it would be possible to induce the Iraqis to return to their previous practice of recognising such individual lowers oi Attorney, out if they did, things could go forward in much the same way as they did before. 4. i understand that you will consider this suggestion which we can perhaps discuss further at the meeting which we hope to hold shortly in order to discuss the general question of the date gardens, and that in the me an time /meantime possible Attorney you will ask Dickson to send home as soon as a translation of the 'general' Power of Yours ever, Cc - « ,Jfy' In any further communication on this subject, please quote n N,&gt; - C. auu address —not to any ptrson b)/ nawief but to— ' “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1 Q u jUh/ / , / i ' THE Under-Secretary of State for ^Foreign A ffairsjpresents his compliments to ^ —Ss, S&gt;^ u J StVlX and, by direction of the Secretary 1 of State, transmits herewith cop r of the under-mentioned paper.

The main points in it, that the demand for the Shaikh 9 s personal appearance at Basrah to take oath there in the loe&amp;l f Iraqi Court was probably a political move by the 'Iraqi Gerr erament, and the refusal of the 'Iraqi Ministry of Justice to confirm the Shaikh's Power of Attorney te his Agent, I have already touched on in para graph 2 of ay telegram Ko*993 of the 19th Norember 1934* I am sending coplee of this letter to His Majesty's * Secretary of State for India, the Gcwernment of India' and the Political Agent, Kuwait* I have the honour te be.

(o) Letter No .Nil, dated the 13th October 1934 from Kemal Beg as Aanuwi, Lawyer to Mr,Gabriel. 2. I should have liked to have sent these particular letters to you by the mail which is due to leave on Saturday the 3rd November, ae the refusal of the Iraq S Minister of Justice to confirm the rhaikh’s Power of Attorney obviously has close connection rtl th the demand that the Shaikh should go to Abul Khasib (Basra) and personally take oath, but I fear this will not bo possible as they (letters) cannot be translated in time for me to do this, owing to other important work in hand. 3. Shortly the position is this. In the last year and a half and since th© haikh has been obliged to employ a lawyer in Basra to defend his interests against the various- 2 - various foms of intrigues niocl attacks that have developed # he has had occasion to give ordinary Powers of Attorney(8 - against well known Basra residents and merchant a for the recovery of certain debts, as well as administer particular house and garden property owned by him. ^aoh ower of Attorney so given dealt with the partiouler and specific case which it was intended to cover and no more, and contained clauses authorizing the lawyer to serve and accept legal documents# 4. The above Powera of Attorney were all registered in this Agency and later in Baghdad without difficulty. 5# On October 10th 1034, and. at the tine when it became necessary for the Phaikh to Institute special proceedings against his recalcitrant ^ao fellahs, the shaikh gave his lawyer a P'leneral ^ Power of Attorney (referred to in the Shaikh’s enclosed letter) authorizing the latter to re- present him in the Administration of his exempt properties in Iraq, including such things as the collection of debts, and rents, the engaging of fresh fellahs and dismissing bad ones, the issuing of loans, the repairing of garden walls, digging of « water channels, registration of properties etc., etc., but he, the Shaikh specifically forbade the lawyer to part with or sell any properties or portions /thereof, and also forbade him to accept service of any documents emanating from the Courts, in respect of his ownership or title to such properties# The Shaikh clearly 1 (although he has mentioned nothing to me personally) acted as he did, because to his lawyer in Basra, to enable the latter to proceea (a) The question of ownership axil title to his ^property was now involved seeing that the fellaheen against whom his lawyer was proceeding (see old corres pondence connected with the Pao troubles generally and recently with the *0ath rt question) were the self same fellaheen who, at the instigation of3 (o) instigation of a certain person or parsons in the background gave so much trouble in and were actually challenging his, the shaikh’s title to portions of 4his Fao iistate^ (guaranteed to him and his successors by His Majesty’s Government) which they claimed as theirs. He feared that if once his o.ui tenants (instigated as be believes, by the Iran Government)were allowed openly and in the Courts to contest his title” to his property the Iraq Government would be quick to follow up their advantage, encourage other claimants (those in the Fadda&amp;hiyeh case for instance) to come out into the open and dispute his (the . haikh’s) right to ownership once mor© / and lastly would probably themselves try and drag into the Courts the whole question of the taxation of his exempted gardens, which from His Majesty’s Government’s point of view would be undesirable in the extreme. NQiiS. The Ghaikh could not forget that a similar error of judgement had cost him his B&amp;tjHIYiSH garden, for which he was later blamed by His Majesty’s Government. He was not sure whether he could trust his lawyer, Mr.Gabriel, who after all was more likely to look after his own interests before those of the Shaikh (if threatened from certain quarters) and in the present Court case might actually try and pay up to the Iraq Government in order to keep a' on the right side of them. I myself suggest the probability of a 'plot” in Minister of Foreign Affairs in Baghdad and Minister e are the prime movers, the objective being to oroe the ihaikh to agree to accept direct service see on himself through his lawyer without having to the roundabout and to them dangerous route ofroute of H.M’s .^iibaesy. They clearly hope to force the bhai’rch to make a false step and defend himself and his title in the local Courts by means of his lawyer, instead of with the assistance of His Majesty’s Government. 7* X further suggest that the recent order of the Basra Court, calling upon the shaikh to take a certain oath gave the Iraq Government the opportunity they sought, for we see the Minister of Foreigi Affairs acting in collaboration with the Minister of Justice, on the one hand ordering the shaikh’s lawyer to inform the shaikh direct that he must appear in person to swear oath before the Abul Khasib Court by the 29th October, on pain of losing his oases against 55 fellahs (here is the effort to short circuit H 0 M f s Embassy), while on the other hand, and to make the Shaikh’s discomfiture doubly sure we see the Minister of Justice deliberately refusing to legalize the Shaikh’s General Power of Attorney, authorizing his lawyer to proceed against his tenants, on the excuse that the said Power of Attorney does not authorize the lawyer to accept service of legal documents on behalf of his master, (here is the effort to get the Shaikh to himself defend his title to his property, and dispense with the assistance of Pis ?lajesty’s Government). 8. In other words the Iraq Government as good as says to the Shaikh 'Unless you allow your ?ao fellahs to dispute 'your title to your Fao Estates (held by you 'for over 100 years end guaranteed to you by you 'His Majesty’s Oovemmmt) we will not allow/to 'proceed against any of them for the recovery 'of money advances, or ’’dates' due to you as 'landlord'. 9. *jLthougi 1 have not, I fat r, marshalled my facts as clearly as I might have, I think I have said enough to enable/to enable you to drrw the attention of the yjabassador at Baghdad to what appear* to be a neat and clever plot to panic the shaikh into making a false move, as well as place His Majesty’s Gov*run ant in a false position. 10.

After Compliments, I beg to enclose, herewith, copy of a letter received from my Agent, (Mr. Grab riel) at Baara, together with a copy of ita enclosure, contents of both of which I ask you to kindly note. Actually I drew up a general Power of Attorney in favour of my abovementinned Agent, giving him powers to deal with whatever properties belong to me, and to defend my rights (in the Courts). But I regret to say that the Iraqi Ministry of Justice har; refused to confirm the said Power of Attorney on the ground that it lacks authority for him, my Agent, to accept direct service of documents etc. (on myself). This refusal of the Ministry of Justice to confirm the said Power of Attorney will assuredly deprive my Agent of all power to protect my rights in any legal way, as he states in his abovementioned letter. As regards the question of my^eing served by the Iraq Oovernment with documents etc., in respect of cases which concern me, the matter has already bean settled, and I have agreed that this should be done through the British Embassy at Baghdad. And for this reason my Agent hf s not bean given authority by me to accept service of documents etc., himself. I trust therefore that the Iraq Grovernment will confirjn my Power of Attorney (as given to my Agent by me). Otherwise my ri$its will be outraged, seeing that he, my Agent, will be unable to take any action in defence of my rights, so long as the aforesaid General lower of Attorney is rejected by the Minister of Justice, Baghdad.

Th j non-confirmation of this power of attorney means that my hands will be restrained by the shackles of the Law, and that I shall in no way be able to defend your Ibcoellenoy’s rights. This will of course lead to the loss of your rights continuously and irretrievably. I would, therefore, ask that your Excellency kindly take necessary steps to (a) obtain the confirmation of the Ministry of Justice to the said power of attorney, and (b) get the said Ministry, by an order of the Ministry for iforsi^i Affairs, to agree to the administration of the - ♦ oath on your Excellency indirectly, and to notify this to the Court of Abul Khasib, before Monday the 29th October 1934. failing the above your Excellency's rights will no doubt be lost, with the still worse consequence that our opponents will be encouraged to further outrage, and will refuse to hand over the just rights of your Excellency But Your Excellency is of course the best judge in weighing the pros and cons of the matter. finally I repeat my request with importunity that try your Excellency nhould^and find a remedy for the problem, before the 29th October 1934, otherwise 'all efforts will be useless after Basra is destroyed” (old Arab proverb).

But the Minister refused to sign on it, on the ground that the Attorney (yourself) ought to have the absolute right of both effecting service as well as of being served with legal documents etc. Pis view being that so long as it is not made possible for service of documents to be made direct on the attorney or on the Shaikh through his attorney, it is impossible to allow the Shaikh (through his Attorney) to proceed against other persons. Usual Ending*COPY. (£ 7316/274/93) q - ,j ! 13th December, 1934. 'OREIG^ T OFFICE, 3.W.I. My dear Humphrys On looking through the recent correspondence between us about the date gardens question, ending with your telegram No. 264 of the 6th December, it occurs to us that, perhaps owing to the fact that we have always had to send you instructions by telegraph, with the conse quent need to be as brief as possible in our explanations, we may have failed to make our position regarding the Sheikh of Koweit 1 s immunity from the jurisdiction of the Iraqi courts entirely clear. At least, the last two sentences of your telegram referred to above suggest that there is still some misunderstanding between us. 2. We are advised that we must start from the fact that there is a rule of international law that foreign sovereigns and governments are exempt from the jurisdiction of the courts of other States. This rule is recognised by the municipal laws of other foreign countries; and, whether or not Iraq has incorporated express provisions in her Code to this effect, she will ultimately be obliged to recognise it also, as she is subject to the general rules of inter national law, and in cases where His Majesty’s Government are themselves concerned, they will have to insist on respect for this rule on the part of the Iraqi Government. 3. This exemption from the jurisdiction of foreign courts may however be, and indeed probably is, subject to an exception which is important in the present case and which/ Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Francis Humphrys, G.C.M.G., G .C . V .0which is mentioned 'below; but perhaps I should first explain the position in cases where this exception does not apply. In such cases we are advised that the foreign sovereign can never be sued as defendant unless he voluntarily chooses to submit to the jurisdiction of the foreign court in question, but that he can nevertheless, when he chooses, sue as plaintiff. In other words, precisely the circumstances to which the Iraqi Government profess to object in the case of the Sheikh of Koweit r s suits apply generally in connexion with proceedings brought by and against foreign sovereigns. Other foreign States accept this position as following from the rules of general international law, and Iraq will have to realise sooner or later that she must do the same. I assume that the Iraqi Government do not dispute the character of the Sheikh of ICoweit as a foreign rovereipn; if they did tc dispute this, we should, of course, have to insist strongly on our view to the contrary. 4. I come now to the exception to which I alluded above. Where a foreign sovereign owns real property in the territory of another State, there may be an exception made to the rule which I have described in the preceding paragraph, in so far as actions relating to the title to such property in the courts of the other State are concerned. It is not possible to say finally whether such an exception does in fact obtain, because authorities on international law differ as to the degree of immunity conferred by sovereign status as regards the ownership of land, but the possibility that this may be so, or that the Iraqi Government may be able to claim that it is so without our being able to prove that it is not, lias to be taken into account. As a result, we are bound/IT' 'bound to consider that, so far as the actions 'brought in the Iraqi courts as regards land are concerned, it is probably true to say that the Sheikh had no right to deny the Jurisdiction of the Iraqi courts. Even assuming, however, that this were so, is it any reason for the Iraqi Government to interfere and make trouble in connexion with the actions which the Sheikh has brought as plaintiff? Their attitude is really only explicable on the assumption that they wish to make things difficult for the Sheikh, because he has denied the Jurisdiction of their courts in the cases in which he would have been defendant. We can- well understand that they may not wish to admit the Sheikhas right to deny the Jurisdiction of their courts in cases relating to title to land in Iraq, but they can quite well avoid committing themselves on this point, and there seems no reason for them, from this point of view, to make diffi culties in connexion with the actions which the Sheikh brings as plaintiff. It would hardly in fact be in the Iraqi Gov eminent 1 s own interest to assist the conduct of the actions brought against the Sheikh, since they wish (or profess to wish) to assist us in reaching a settlement and presumably they do not therefore want matters to come to such a point that, owing to the complete failure of the Sheikh to obtain satisfaction in the Iraqi courts. His Majesty’s Government have to make claims against the Iraqi Government in order to secure compensation for uim. Yours ever, ( Sgd. ) G.W.

Minister for Foreign Affaire has assured me that Iraq government intends to abide by the promise made by King Feisal in London in 1933 that they would explore every means in co-operation with the Embassy to find by diplomatic action out of court satisfactory safeguard for Sheikh's title to his proper^ties legitimately covered by our undertaking given him in 1314. I have no reason to doubt the Iraq government's sincerity in regard to cases brought against Sheikh, the hearing of which they have consistently postponed at our request. In regard to the other matter however, such as Sheikh's dealings with his tenants or with the produce of his gardens for other (Dnjmercia.l transactions carried out in Iraq, they cannot agree that the Sheikh should be free to institute civil proceedings in Iraqi courts, while himself refusing to appear as defendant through his authorised representative in Basra, in cases which might be brought against him. This attitude appears to me both reasonable and inevitable. It v/ould be unjust in Iraqi eyes that a neighbouring ruler with large landed and commercial interests in Iraq snould be allowed to pick and chose the occasions on which transactions of his agents in Iraq should or should not be subject to the jurisdiction of Iraqi courts.In any further conAnunication on this subject, please quote No. cation on this subject, please quote and address —to any person by name, but to— “The Undersecretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.

Court has already withdrawa order for appearance of Sheikh but this does not advance Pao cases as Iraqi government will not forward documents -or administration of oath unless Sheikh agrees to accept service of all pending juaicial documents, fhis s^eiis to be their only motive and their refusal to confirm power of attorney referred to in your paragraph 2 is only another step in the same direction. Theie is no attack upon his status as an independent ruler. Your paragraph 3. It he,s not been suggested that Sheikh’s status is in any doubt or that it has lacked official support from His Majesty's Government, j-he comment in in'- telegrain had reference only to his claim to immunity from jurisdiction because, he is an in dependent ruler. I an; satisfied that the best we can do in present circumstances is to secure postponement of these cases until Fadjjfyah case is out of the way.

If not you should at once endeavour to get them to do so, postponement beyond November 29th being in any case essential. Meanwhile it appears useless to pursue question of jurisdiction on present legalistic lines. Position is that late and present King of Iraq both undercook to ensure that Sheikh’s possession of his date gardens would not be dis turbed, and means of giving practical effect to these under takings are being actively pursued. These undertakings presumably indicate desire to assist Sheikh, and justify assumption that Iraqi Government do not wish to support elements in Iraq who are endeavouring to disturb his possession. But recent attitude of Iraqi Ministry of Justice, particularly as regards Fao cases, is entirely inconsistent with Royal undertakings, and can only be explainedexplained by desire to make matters as difficult as possible for Sheikh as plaintiff in order to force him to admit jurisdiction of Iraqi courts as defendant. I there fore consider that means must he found to make Iraqi Govern ment face realities of posit ion. While first necessity is to secure postponement of Fao cases, you should also take early opportunity of representing to Iraqi Government above view of situation, and of making it clear that His Majesty’s Government cannot believe that policy of Iraqi Government in this matter has completely changed and that the assurance of two Kings of Iraq are now to be taken as repudiated as might be inferred from Nuri Pasha’s note of October 21st.

They have taken up the attitude that they will not attempt to serve any judicial document on the Sheikh unless he agrees to accept all pending documents. They have refrained from touching upon the question of jurisdic tion and have never admitted even tacitly the Sheikh’s claim to immunity from process (see paragraph 4 of Mr. Ogilvie Fortes despatch No. 530 of 27th October). On the contrary I am informed that whatever the status of the Sheikh as a foreign ruler may be the Iraqi courts would not admit ira. unity in cases arising out of the title to immoveable property in Iraq. His Majesty’s Government hm/e hitherto merely transmitted the Sheikh’s claim that as an independent ruler he- is not subject to the jurisdiction of the Iraqi courts 0 They have not given official support to it. If the argument is to be used it would be necessary to state his claim in an official communication and to give detailed reasons for supporting it* This would be likely to bring the matter to a head v/hile Faddaghiyah case is still in the air 9 which is r I suggest, undesirable* , . ~ L , ^ Addressed to Secretary ot btate for Foreign Affairs No. 245 r repeated to Resident, Persian Gulf at Bahrain No. 33.,Notes Minute Paper.

SUBJECT. Sheikh of KoweitCs Fao Date Gardens . Iraqi demand that the Sheikh should appear in person to take an oath at Basra^ Copy of to FOR INFORMATION. The position is explained in the minute at P.Z.6846/34. / In reply to our telegram of 6th November -which we sent on that paper the Political Resident telegraphed on 7th November (P.Z. 6900/34) that the delay in obtaining from the Sheikh the particulars which are required for a settlement of the Faddagiyeh case with the Iraqi Government was due to the Sheikh himself, but that the Political Agent would endeavour to obtain and forward these particulars the following week. Even if the Political Agent has already succeeded in obtaining this information^there will not be time to allow for its consideration by the Departments here and for a settlement^to be ——^ reached with the Iraqis/of the Faddagiyeh case I before/ 2730 1000 4.34before 29th November when the Fao cases are due to come up again before the Basra Court. In these circumstances it is to be hoped that the Baghdad Embassy will be able to obtain from the Iraqi Government the indefinite postponement of these cases for which they have asked. cJs&lt;r The Political Resident ^telegraphed to Baghdad on 7th November (P.Z.6897/34) suggesting inter alia that the claim of the Iraqi Government that the Sheikh should take an oath at Basra might be resisted on the grounds that the Sheikh as an owner of property in Iraq was in the same judicial position as other rulers who owned property in foreign countries andvhe would not be required by an English Court to visit this country to take an oath in such a case. H.M. f s Ambassador at Baghdad criticised this suggestion in his telegram of 11th November (P.Z.6985/34) but the Baghdad telegram seems to be disposed of by the F.O. telegram of 10th November to Baghdad (P.Z.6986/34). The F.0.consider-^ that there was atee force in the Residents argument, and that the Iraqi that the Sheikh ought to accept service either of all documents emanating from the Iraqi Courts or of none, was not legally as good as it appeared. The F.O. view is that the; Sheikh was quite consistent in contending that the Iraqi Courts could not entertain an action against him as defendant without his consent (i.e. in the Faddagiyeh suit) while at the same time appearing as plaintiff in the Fao cases, since the Sheikh’s appearance in Court gives jurisdiction. They point out that the English Courts while refusing to entertain actions brought against foreign sovereigns nevertheless entertain actions brought by them as plaintiffs. It seems doubtful, however, whether this argument will make much impression on the Iraqis. /-A The/* [7 A Minute -V~' Paper. Department.

His Majesty*a Government in the United kingdom have no financial interest in the Fao cases, whichever way they go, whereas a Judgment against the ShaiJch in the pending Faddaghlyah actions might involve His Uajeety c e Government in considerable financial liability. The Iraqi Government have, in deference to representations froa His Majesty*a Embassy, agreed to postpone the hearing of the Fao eases for one month from 29th October, and I have ashed them to grant a further postponement sine die. 5. There are, however, wider issues raised In the letter froa the Iraqi Government which need consideration apart from their immediate bearing upon the pending lend suite. 1 invite ' % ^ , • /• The night Honourable air «J oim Simon, G.0. •/« X., K.

Tour telegram No* 32 of March 24th, 1935, approved this procedure. 4. The fact that this course of action hae successfully suspended all movement in the Courts, and that the lav suite are postponed indefinitely, does not imply that the Iraqi oovem- mont have accepted the contention that the .shaikhs are not subject to the jurisdiction of their Courts. The postponement is dm to the fact that the Iraqi law governing service of judicial documents provides no legal method of serving then on the Clmikh if he refuses to accept then. This flaw in the lav has not passed unnoticed by tho Iraqi Ministry of Justice and it is fairly certain that legislation will he passed in the future which will provide s legal method of overcoming mere refusal by non-residents to acoept service. *hen such a legal remedy is created steps will probably be taken to serve all pending documents upon the Shaikh and the suits will be called for trial, 5, It appears to be Imperative that the Shaikh should, in Ills own interests as well as those of ills Majesty's Govern- ment in the United Kin* dom, stand Ms ground until the Faddagh- lyah settlement is effected, or the suits pending against him are otherwise disposed of. but the obvious disadvantage of /thisthis courts© is that ho will find hi© hand© aoro and aoro tiod oo tlao gooo on xmct ho will he unable to take legal action In reapeei of hie large eatatea in Iraq,* The reaietanoe of his cultivators will be encouraged and stiffened ae soon aa hia ultimate helpleesneae to invoke tm law in protection of hie righto is revealed and its inpllcation* are realised* It eeo&amp;e clear that a final reply to the Minis tor for Foreign Affairs’ letter of October Slat auat be delayed until all attempts to settle the Faddaghiyah case out of Court* either by buying off the plaintiff* or by Iraqi Government legislative action, have ended in auoeeee or failure* The present poeltlo however* cannot be indefinitely maintained and the dlfficultie of the halkh will undoubtedly increase* end increase rapidly as a result of the Iraqi Government using his own weapons against him* Ultimately* end once the Faddaghlyah ease is out of the way, it seems to me that he must give way on the question of immunity* and the sooner he can do ao the better* unless there are wider reasons of policy involved of which I am unaware, 6 * If these views are accepted 1 suggest that the position should be explained to the Shaikh sad that he should be urged to expedite to the utmost the submission of the Information called for in India Office telegram to the Honour able the rolltleal kealdont in the Persian Gulf ho. 2H9&amp; of able the Political resident in the Persian Gulf.

Point (A) is a legal argument which might have been pu t to the Court by the Sheikh's lawyer but which only the Court is competent to decide. His Majesty's Emoassy is not in a position to argue legal details of the case or to challenge correctness of a ruling - given by the Court. Point (B) is answered by paragraph 1 ox my saving telegram. The Sheikh's posit ion is unique inasmuch as he has already refused in other cases to admit the jurisdiction of the very Court whose (?aid) he now seeks. Hypothetical cases cited are not anaiagous. In normal conditions paragraph 2 of your telegram would correctly summarise the situation but the Sheikh has already refused to accept the jurisdiction 0i Iraqi Court and Iraqi Government will noo allow him uo pici*. and choose cases on which he would be willing to accept the Court's judgment. The position is of such delicacy that in my opinion he should have sought His Majesty's Govern ment's advice before taking precipitate action which has led us into these further difficulties.

Please see the Political Residents telegram of 25th October at P*Z.6647/34 and the subsequent correspondence on the file on the subject of suits by the Sheikh cfKoweit in the Iraqi Courts against certain of his Pao fellaheen. The SheiMiis claiming from his fellaheen certain payments in kind (dates) which are owing to him and in the 48 cases out of 53 in which pleadings have already taken place His Excelle ncyi 1 to-«■* 4^ the payments in question have been confirmed by the Courts. It appears, however, that the opposition lawyer has alleged that the correct quantities of dates have in fact been delivered to the Sheikh 'and has challenged His Excellency to take an oath that he has not received them. In previous cases of tMo- kind-the Sheikh has been allowed to take an oath before the Political Agent at Koweit, but the Iraqis now claim that he must appear in person at Basra to take the oath. The Sheikh has no objection to taking an oath of the kind required at Koweit, but for His Excellency to appear before the Iraqi Courts, quite apart from the incon-venience involved, prejudice his position as an independent sovereign. Prom Bagdad telegram No.6 Saving of 24th October, a copy of which has now been received (P.Z£846/34), it appears that the Iraqi Government argue that 'as the Sheikh has consistently refused to accept service of judicial documents emanating from the Iraqi Courts when the document might be to his disadvantage, he cannot expect to be given an opportunity of accepting service when he believes it to be in his interests to do so. They say he must either accept service of all documents or none.' The/The documents of 'which the Sheikh (acting on the advice of H.M.G.) has refused to accept service are, of course, those relating to the attempt being made by- judicial action in the Iraqi Courts to dispossess him of his Faddaghiyeh properties. As the Charge d 1 Affaires says, the Iraqi attitude is quite logical, but, in view of the negotiations between H.M.G. and the Iraqi Government for the settlement of the Faddaghiyeh case out of Court, the line taken by the Iraqis seems to be somewhat sharp practice. Ogilvie-Forbes has succeeded in obtaining a written promise from the Iraqi Government that the hearing of the Fao cases will be postponed for one month and he hopes to be able to get the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs to extend this period sine die . We must, I think, agree with Mr. Ogilvie-Forbes that it would be unwise for the Sheikh, in order to save the Fao cases, to accept service of all judicial documents and thereby endanger our chances of settling the Faddaghiyeh case out of Court and that he must therefor^ maintain for the present his attitude of refusing to accept service until the Faddaghiyeh case is out of the way. The settlement of the latter is being held up at present by the delay in obtaining from the Sheikh the particulars asked for in para.2 of our telegram of 28th September (P.Z.5818/34fin the attached file) and it is therefore a matter of urgency that these particulars should now be obtained at the earliest possible date. In these circumstances a reminder telegram to the Resident asking him what the position is as regards the obtaining of the information required from the Sheikh is submitted. This telegram might be repeated to Bagdad. tr tfc, Cff-myS* IrtA+y fV'tw/t' k' A flu14—6130 10292 (2) In any further communication on this subject, please qiKite No. :ation on this subject, please qiKite \c V* Vo!&gt;0 \ and address —not to any person by name, but to-| “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.

Reference your Express Letter 953-8 of 9th October 1934 regarding the administration of the oath to the Shaikh of Kovfeit* The reply which I have received to my representations to the Iraqi Government is that as the Shaikh has consistently refused to accept service of judicial documents emanating from Iraqi Courts when the outcome might be to his disadvantage he cannot expect to be given an opportunity of accepting service when he believes it to be in his interests to do so. They say he must either accept service of all documents or non«e. If he will accept all pending and future judicial documents they will send a form of oath for administration in Koweit. Their attitude is quite logical and I consider that as the Shaikh has denied the jurisdiction of the Iraqi Courts in the other pending land cases he should not have brought the Pao cases in the Basra Courts without first having asked our advice on the matter,. Ris position is now gravely prejudiced. It will obviously be unwise for the Shaikh, in order to save the Pao cases, to accept service of all judicial documents and thereby endanger our chances of settling the ^ddaghiyah case out of court and he must maintain for the present his attitude of refusing to accept service# In order to provide against the Pao cares being decided against him in default I have with some difficulty secured a verbal promise from the Iraqi Government that the Court will postpone hearing them for a month# I am seeking written confirmation of this. In order to make the fullest possible use of this breathing space the shaikh should be urged to provide immediately the information required/required regarding hie propertiee In Iraq fo that ve may preps on with the settlement of the T?addaghlyah case* I am informing the Iraqi Government that the issues raised in their reply will need discussion with His Majesty's Government and the r haikh and a separate despatch will follow on this point as soon as possible# I am sending a copy of this to the foreign Office# ( 8 gd) OGILVIE-POFBES•'-PV 1 In any further communication on this subject, please quote ^ No. £ yv$. and address— nt&gt;t to any person by name, but to— “The Undef-Se&lt;retary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.

I em not alarmed about swearing this oath, for wh?t I have claimed is my rightful property, but it is quite impossible for me to be present personally as desired by the Court. Tills fact is well known to then (the Iraq officials) but they are endeavouring to make me lose my rights by making such trifling excuses, else why tdiould they object to my taking the oath indirectly through yr,u as was done before. I would refer you to Colonel Dickson’s letter to me, Ho.423, dated the 23rd nebi* Than! 1352 (14/8/33) and my reply to him, No.H/3/1130, dated the 24th Kabi’ Thani 1352 (15.8.33) from which you will perceive that the Iraq Government had once asked through the British Embassy, Baghdad, that an oath be sworn by me indirectly* After Compliments Tith reference to my letter NO.R4/1585, dated the After many rroceedings the abovementioned dates In a previous letter I wrote to you, I requested— 2 *• I b«g t therefore, to request that you will kindly take up this matter and do your best to ^et it settled before the date specified (for me to present my self before the Court) so that wo may not lose our rights.

I wrote to Your brcell^aicy previously to the effect that the Ministry of Justice had notified the courts here that the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs objected to th conveyance to Your Excellency of the form of oath which was to be sworn by Your Excellency in connection with the cases lodged against certain n Taaba' fellaheen of Fao. Headings had taken place for 48 oases out of 53 oases of precautionary distraint originally lodged against some of the 'T aba' fellaheen of ^ao. The result in them all was that Your ^coHency*a rights were confirmed, and the correctness of the ’Pledge . anads*which X had last year obtained from the said fellaheen was proved • and consequent ly your Excellency’s right of ownership. The opponent’s lawyer, however, alleged that the correct quantities of dates have been fully delivered. But as there was no way to prove such delivery against the i^anads we hold, save by production of signed receipts, and as the fellaheen were unabl to produce such receipts, their lawyer demanded that Your rbcoellonoy should taken an oath that you have not received the correct quantities of dates mentioned In the Canada which we hold and ihich have been ahovn to the Court. Owing to the objection of the Ministry of Justice which acted in conformity with the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to the administration of the oath to Your Excellency through ths British Consul at Kuwait, the Court has now decided that Your Excellency should be present prsonally at the Court on the 29th October 1934 to s^wear the oath required from Your Excellency. The opponents’ lawyer knew perfectly well that his clients, the fellaheen had not paid the correct quantities- 2 - quantltios of dates, but aa he knew also that the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs had objected to Your bccelleney swearing the oath indirectly and waa sure that Your ICxcellency would never appear before the Court personally, he tried to prove his allegation by any m^ans. Your ixoellency is well aware of the great difficulties end obstacles, with which I have been confronted since the tiine Your ^bccellency entrusted to me the administration of your vast properties, and how I succeeded in obtaining from your opponents those legal documents which proved Your ■JCC 0 llency , a rights. Now if these rights are going to be lost in such an unfortunate way, there will by no means by which to recover your rights and to protect your properties in future; and the fellaheen and 'Taabeen ' will no doubt be encouraged to usurp Your .^xoGllency* s rights. I beg, therefore, to request that measures necessary for insuring the consent of the Ira&lt;!i Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Your luxcellency swearing the oath indirectly through the British Consul at Kuwait, as is the procedure followed by all the courts of Iraq, be taken immediately, and that the Ministry’s consent be communicated to the courts here before the 29th October; otherwise the court will no doubt consider that Your iiroellency is evading the oath and will decide on the rejection of all our oases because of Your Excellency’s failure to appear on the day specified# Again I request that the matter may be put right while there is time, otherwise we will lose our rights and with them Rs*6000/- approximately, which we have paid as expenses and fees of the distraint and oases and which should be incurred by the opponents, when decision is. issued in our favour after Your Excellency has taken the oath required.

But two days ago the Iraqi Ministry of K reign Affairs notified the Court that they d: did not agree to Your Excellency taking the oath through them. Bala news has spread amongst tm mob quicker than lightning.

His Excellency the Mutasarrif of Basra, Tahsin Beg Ali, accompanied by some half a dozen members of his Staff, one prominent Basra merchant and one journalist, arrived at Kuwait on 26th March by land route. The visit was a private and unofficial one. The Mutasarrif and the members of his Staff were accommodated in His Excellency the Shaikh 1 s Dasman Palace and the others with a prominent Kuwaiti merchant. During the Mutasarrif’s two days stay at Kuwait, calls were exchanged between the Political Agent and the former. The Mutasarrif appeared favourably impressed by the Arab hospitality accorded to him by the Kuwaitis in general and their Ruler in particular; and the distinguished visitor, at a parting speech, took the opportunity of expressing his gratitude to His Excellency the Shaikh and people of Kuwait and among other things remarked that he was astonished to see the 1 Iraq . 1 s lack of courtesy towards her harmless neighbour, particularly in falsely accusing the latter of originating the smuggling when in reality his own countrymen were at fault.

You, no doubt, are aware that the Mutasarrif, Basra, who relieved i.bdul lazzak al Hilmi (See para 2 of my No.258, dated the 15/19th October, referred to above), was himself relieved after about one month’s sojourn in Basra. 4. The latest incumbent, one TAHSHEN BEG ALI, I under stand from a certain British official in Basra, to be rather of the same ’kidney’ as was Abdul Razzak, and so may be ex pected to ’return to the charge* where the Shaikh of Kuwait is concerned, as soon as he settles down.

H.R.P.Dickson, Lt.-Colonel, Tolltical Agent, Kuwait;2*r1) Translation of m article which appeared in the 'Al-Ahali' newspaper, dated the 2nd December 1933, issued at Baghdad. AL-SDBAH MEDDLING. The Al-Subah have now turned their attention to the political task of creating dissension among the different clas ses of Fellaheen, so that they can preserve their control over those lands, which they have seized from the legal owners by means of their well known methods. e understand that their (the Al-Subah f s) agent at Basrah has been seducing some of the Fellaheen (from the right path) and has begun to give them large presents for the sole purpose of getting them against those who are only claiming their ri$its. This indeed seems to be a new way of doing things, which may easily be copied by others who want to devour the rights of the Fellah. We bring this to the Government’s attention and ask them to seize hold of the hands of the man who is trying forcibly to remove the veil from the eyes of justice. THE FAD FELLAHEKN. There is much excitement among the fellaheen at Fao similar to what is happening on the Fadda^hiyeh Estate against the Al-3ubah. The latter are cleverly playing fast and loose with the rights of the Fellah so as to gain their own ends. We learn also from local sources that the Al-Subah have so ex tended their severe regime as to bring about a general feeling of restlessness among the fellaheen, this, Inspite of their (the Fellaheen’s) undoubted rights and proved documents. We ask the High Authorities to take necessary action against Al-Subah and compel them to follow the right path and carry out the usual engagements, which exist between them and the Fellaheen. We also ask the Government to protect their subjects from the intrusion of such foreigners.

A further 06 of the Shaikh’s leading fellahs or sarkals (headmen) came down to Kuwait accompanied by the shaikh’s lawyer, and in a notable interview with the Shaikh confessed that they had been deceived and led astray and wanted to resume their old relations with him.

Lastly he urged theiu to come direct to him should they ever have any other complaints or feel they had a grievance and not pernit theme elves to become the tools of mischeif makers, who wished ill both to the Al 3ub*h and themselves, etc. etc. (a) The signing in Kuwait of w Il-cinaxa 3 ' f (agreements) -»*ao t and hv r*^ 5.- 3 - 8 th October all exoitemont rany be said to have died down a,fain, and the situation to have returned to as near normal as could be expected# 6 # The shaikh tells me that as a result of all this trouble he has, unfortunately, lost in stolen dates, fruit, lucerne grass, firewood, oto, approximately i'is t 10 , 000 ; and that he has paid out in presents at Basra, Siba and ?ao (including lawyers fees) close on Rs.^Q, 000 /.., all of which he bitterly said, could have been saved him, had the ♦Iraq Government pi eyed the game and come to hie assistance in the beginning by taking action against the ringleaders in the movement against him, as he had originally asked. 7# The Shaikhs lawyer, Mr.Gabriel, who visited Kuwait as recently as 7th to 9th October also told me in recapitulating recent events that a most serious situation, in fact a deliberate and organized attempt to dispossess the ohalkh of his ^ao lands had been fortunately safely frustrated. The chief trouble maker in the piece, he said, had been the late Mutasorrif, who, advised that the 'Law of Limitation' would frustrate hi- fe in his efforts to oust the shaikh by direct methods, had deliberately gone to work to get the fellaheen to revolt, declare the shaikh to be no landlord of theirs, to testify that they themselves were the original and true landlords, to refuse to pay rental, and lastly to appeal to the ’Iraq Government to assist them get justico# 8 # All would have gone well for the I^utasarrif, added the lawyer, had he not made the tactical error of sending verbal orders to the 'Ta’abB” (fellahs) to refuse to hand over to the shaikh any dates or jjroduoe generally from his property, and to claim protection from the ’Iraq Govern ment against the Jhaikh, who was an Interloper. These orders were, he said, actually given to the JIukhtar of FaoWP ( 7 &amp;) 4 - Fao pasaed tham on to tho Jhaiidl.s fellaheon. The r&amp;elicks lawyer countered tht novo by IsoMdlately writing officially to the Mutasarrif end in- vitlng hin to deny that the said orders had bean issued by him. He added in hia letter that he had been told by the Luhhtar hi .self and the recalcitrant fellahs that ho (the J'utasarrlf) had issued such orders* The l.utacarrif in a dilecraa was forced to deny the story. 'Ihis saved the “situation, but the Mutasarrif tc the end tried to revenge himself on the lawyer. 9 * another factor in righting the situation was the straightforward conduct of the ^aiELMaKma of Siba, in whose administrative area the shaikhs Fao lands lay. He apparently and contrary to the Mutaearrif’s orders mentioned above, issued urgent instructions to the fellahs that unless they ceaaed acts of sabotage and agreed to pay their landlord his rightful dues, he would proceed most rigorously against their ringleaders. 10# These contrary orders from different administra tive superiors caused uncertainty and an early split among the fellaheen, and gave the Shaikhs lav’yer, as well as the Shaikhs Agent, the opportunity they nought. They visited the fellahs and by diplomatic and tactful means made them see the error of their ways. It was at this juncture that they were persuaded to go to Kuwait and make their peace with the Shaikh. 11 . The k haikha lawyer added Tihat the affair has ended as successfully as i t has by the *iole efforts of the shaikh,himself and the ^aii&amp;doton of Siba. He was most strong on the point that neither the Covornment of ’Iraq nor the late Uutaearrif gave any assistance or help at all from the beginning, on tha contrary apparently did all in their power to attack the Shaikh and wrest his property from him. In his (the lawyer’s) opinion had nothad not the Assyrian question ooiae up and distracted attention in .Baghdad, nothing short of a British warship at Fao would have restored the situation* 12, As it is, the lawyer, Mr,Gabriel, gave it as his considered view that the ’Iraq Government would come back to the attack with even greater vigour as soon as they \ had cleared up the Assyrian mess, Hts underground inform ation fiom Baghdad, which had rarely been at fault, he said, convinced him that the trouble was only scotched, not ended, 13, I apologize for the length of this letter, but I am most anxious that you get a true picture of recent happenings and what people are thinking about, for I regret to say that I also take the view that wo shall hear more of this Fao business later if not this year than next, and probably just before the antes ripen once more, 14, Tn conclusion, I note that in some quarters there is a tendency to think that the whole 1 ’ao trouble is nothing more than a noisy dispute as to what percentage of the produce the fellahs should pay the Shaikh. I trust that ray above remarks will show that the trouble has had a much deeper and significant origin. The mere fact that the Sheikh has gone 'all out' to ovoid the ’Iraq 'Courts' and arrive at a direct settlement with his tenants, was because he and his lawyer, Mr .Gabriel, realized in time the trap they were being shepherded into. Although a settlement has been arrived at, it should be realized that the Shaikh has given away much in money and prestige and, it will take him sonetl a to recover the ground ho has lost with his j tenants.

He added, ho ever, that they appeared more subdued than before, and to be distinctly impressed with the support which the Agent was receiving from the ftudir of &amp;iba and Kao, as instanced by the presence of the Police.4 . It appears that the ringleaders who were at the bottom of the original trouble recently went to Basra to complain to the Mutasarrif against the action of the vaimak&amp;m, shatt-al-Arab f for his support to the Shaikh of Kuwait, but had got no change. 5 # On the fec€ of it, therefore, matters seem to be progressing quite favourably, although I think it is perhaps premature to say definitely that the trouble has been scotched for good. 6 # Without doubt Baghdad has moved in the matter, and the f/rutasarrif has been told pretty plainly to stop the trouble. 7 .

A copy of the Bagdad despatch was sent to you last night private letter to Rendel, dated 3rd August, Ogilvie-Forbes states that when he, in company with Dickson, took up this question with the Iraqi Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior, both ministers professed to have heard nothing about it and promised immediate action. Ogilvie- Forbes appeared to be pretty confident that the Iraqi under cover of our official letter No. E 5011/308/93. , 2. You may also be interested to know that in a CC Government J.G. Laithwaite, EsqGovernment would actively discourage the movement among the fellaheen since, apart from any question of their feelings towards the Sheikh, they would be alive to the danger of a 'peasants' revolt' spreading to gardens in which they themselves are interested* 3. In view of this and of the hope held out by the Iraqi Government’s note of 9th August, we are rather averse, unless you feel very strongly about it, from pressing the Iraqi Government further at present provided of course that it is clear that their instructions are not being carried out. But we realize the urgency of the matter and think it would be worth while as a first step to follow up the suggestion which we discussed yesterday that Dickson might be asked to report by telegram on the present position, with special reference to the instructions which the Iraqi Government state that they have issued to the local authorities.

I have to inform Your ’2xoellenoy that every year 9 at this season, the palm fronds are cut from the trees and when this takes place we normally send special boats from Kuwait to bring our share of the palm fronds| for our own house—hold use, through our local representative. This is done under the control and check of Fee Cue toms department as Your Ihceellenoy la aware from the lists, which you annually receive from the Director of Fao Customs. This year according to our usual custom we sent our boats for the above purpose, and our 'Fellaheen* actually began to out the palm fronds according to usual custom but certain 'Fallaheen* who in the past have given us a certain amount of trouble started spreading false and malicious stories by means of which they were able to induce the loyal ’Fellaheen' to refuse to deliver to us our share of the palm fronds. We, although we knew about the doings of these evil persons, and their apparent determination to create disturbances, decided to move slowly and patiently in the matter. We therefore instructed our Fao Representative to take up a reasonable attitude and attempt to placate the 'Fellaheen' in case they should have any serious grievances.Th« ring loaders war® able, however f counter hie effort* by spreading reports that the autho rities (In Basra) were behind then and would help thezt* R* t our representative, was obliged therefore to write a letter to us whloh you will find herewith In original* tfe, for our part, in spite of the written report Of our representative to the effect that the 'ITallaheon' were still refusing to deliver our share of the palm fronds, for a while decided to postpone direct action in the matter* Bat when we saw that our tenants parslstod in their determination to create trouble and refuse to pay us our duos we instimeted our Basra lawyer to put the case officially before the authoritios for their consideration and action* He the lawyer duly inf©m»a the ludir of Sifco (Faoj who sent for our Fao Agent and ashed him for a full report on the case, and espoel&amp;lly what had b*en th&amp; customary procedure In the past* Our repr sentative appears to have explained everything to him fully, and the Modi* thereupon wrote to the * ukhtar* (head :tum) of Fao ordering him to Instruct the Fallaheen' to deliver over to us our usual ;.haro, to look nxt± after the gardens in their charge properly, to prevent water from flooding the palm areas (by keeping the protective dyke* in order), and to drive away all straying or unknown animal®* The *Uukhtar* informed them acoordlngly, but we regret to say that not ing at all has resulted from these instructions* ubooquontly the Assistant to the Polloe Commandant of Baare Liwa visited the Fao Administrative Headquarters, and sent for all our '•Fellaheen', and asked them to reply to certain questions which he put to them* The latter were divided into twn Wthe first party replied honestly and gave the true history of everything that pertained to our property but the second party, elmsisting of the ring leaders and disturbers of the peace, did not give him any clear cut or satisfactory reply* At one time they said that they were the real owners of the land, and at another that they had a right to take for their own use three quarters of the total produce, and again that they the palm fronds were theirs to dispose of and not the landlord’s* After this enquiry the iolioe Officer returned to Basra, but his investigations have had no result except that some of the loyal 'Fallaheen' have now delivered a smell portion of the palm fronds* We heard that on the 25th Kabi Awal 1352, the Mudir of Siba himself again visited Government Headquarters at Fa©, and made further enquiries Into the matter, returning the same day* ve have now been informed that as a result of this visit the 'Kukhtar' cut down any palm fronds at all, nor to deliver any to in spite of the fact that it is our firm belief that these communistic activities are not happening just of themselves, but at the deliberate instigation of some person in the back ground, are averse to taking any direct action to protect our gardens from damage, or we could do this in normal cirou stances (by sending armed servants to overawe the rebellious fellahs), until we have reported the matter in detail to Tour Excellency and have asked you to refer the whole unfortunate business to those in authority in Iraq who are our neighbours and a friendly government, pointing out that lastly tha* never gave more than one quarter to the landlord, and / of F&amp;o sent for all our 'If’allaheen' and

They appealed to Government for assistance in obtaining some revenue from the tribesmen in occupation of the lands, and it was necessary to have recourse to a Government Commission to consider the whole problem of their rights in the land * As far as I am aware, they were not deprived of anything to which they had an effective title* 3* It would seem, therefore, though one would naturally hesitate to advise the Shaikh to disregard the advice of his lawyer,/ The Honourable The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. r'llawyer, that the Shaikh might he told that the position does not on the face of it seem to he quite so precarious as Mr* Gabriel appears to imagine, and that, by waiting for the I^nd Settlement, which is in progress in parts of ’Iraq and will eventually extend, throughout the country, to reach Fao, he would thereby at any rate save himself a great deal of trouble and expense. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your obedient servant, (Sd*) G.Ogilvie-Forbes.?n) Note by Legal Secretary on Lieutentaat-Colonel T* C. Jbwle’e confidential despatch No*640-S of 10th The dangers envisaged by Mr# Gabriel are of so hypothetical a nature that it is not easy to advise# Certainly a Tapu title 'would be a better one than reliance upon an Ottoman firman* However, the Shaikh and his dependents have been in quiet and uncontested possession of the Fao estates for so long that I cannot see from what quarter a claimant can arise with proof of better title than the Shaikh possesses. Mr* Gabriel himself appears to consider the position safe enough in law# What he apparently fears is a rising of the fellaheen, attively encouraged and supported by the 'Iraqi Govern ment* This would be an extra-legal movement, and, if it occurred, His Majesty's Government would presumably have something to say on the matter* Owing to the system of inheritance operating under Mahomedan law, the preparation of Tapu deeds for this large estate would be a matter of great difficulty# It would result in profit, no doubt, to Mr. Gabriel, but the Shaikh is wise, I think, to hesitate before embarking on it. I think he would be better advised to wait until the comprehensive land settlement, which is now being carried out throughout ’Iraq, reaches Fao, when, after a careful survey of the land has been made, he should, have no difficulty in obtaining complete title deeds from the Settlement Commission# June 1933* 27.6.33.P 7.

The Shaikh as you know returned from Bahrain yesterday afternoon after a most stormy journey of 4 days. I met him on the jetty (Arab fashion) and called formally on him this morning. 3. I was able to discuss your Confidential No. 715-3 of 23rd Juno, but not your No.547-3 of 25th Bay - the latter question the i haikh promised to talk over on Saturday next ( 8 th July)• 4 . I come now to the point of this letter. Do you remember the note which I gave you at lushire (dated 8 th June) on the i haikh of iuwaits Fao instates. You sent a copy to aghdad under your Confidential No.640-3, dated the 10th June. 5 . I would ask you in particular to refer to oaras 5 to 11 of my note. 6 . The Shaikh it seems on his return from Bahrain, was presented with a hunch of letters from his YAO Agent, the gist of which was that the fellaheen of his FAO estates, had started giving serious trouble, and were in fact behaving in exactly the way that I foreshadowed might/ The Hon’bl© Lt.-Colonel T.C.W.Fowle, C.B.15., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,- 2 - might happen in para 6 of my 'Note on the !

Many acta of 'sabotage'* have taken place, such as cutting down trees, etc., and about two thirds of the fellaheen had refused point blank to ?ive the bhaikhs Agent, firewood, palm fronds (soaf), fruit, fodder, etc. etc., which is normally sent to Kuwait at this time of the year, for the use of the shaikhs household, end which is the Shaikhs absolute ri *ht to collect. 8 . ’fhe fellaheen in other words, had started an intensive ,f non-cooperation’* campaign, and in reply to the Agents protests appear to have everywhere given the same reply, namely, 'The Iraq Government is our Government, and not the Shaikh of Kuwait, we are the owners of the soil, and have been born and bred on it. ^ur Government (IRAQ) is going to help us, and will make us the link s U or proprietors instead of the Ghaikh oi iuiwait. 9 . According to the Ahaikh, the gent further made report that he had ^one to the Kudir of ?ao and com plained officially against the fellaheen and their behaviour That the liudir had sent for the 'liukhtars' (headmen) and told them they must behave themselves, end uxy the Shaikhs share quietly and in orderly manner; but that so far nothing had happened. 10. The shaikh, who, I could see, was greatly wor- rled and excited about the matter, added that he had Just received a telegram from his Agent to the effect that there were sifdaa that the trouble was spreading to hi a/Vv - S - his fedda^iyah fell&amp;heen, and a sited for orders* 11. The Shaikh gave it as hie positive opinion that the uclir of l?ao himself was at the bottom of the trouble, and that he was acting under the secret and ex press orders of the Mutasarrif, Basrah• In other words just the prophesy, which L!r*Gabriel made to me,/before I came over to Bushire, appears now to be coming true inerery 4 e*a detail* 12 * ‘fhe shaikh urged me to report the matter to you without delay, remarking, 'This is what I get for being e the friend of you ’ ihiglish 1 '* 13* The Kudir was of course (Turkish fashion) out wardly pretending to help his agent, said the Shaikh, but in reality was himself stirring up his tenants to act as they were doing* 14* personally in vitiw of what r.Gabriel told me at the end of hay, and knowing the pleasant methods of the modem Iraqi Officials, I am zayself convinced that what the Shaikh has told me is the correct interpretation of the business* It is merely a new form of attack on the part of the IR&amp;Q Government on the shaikh of Kuweit. The danger of course lies in its underhandedness. They will, of course, indignantly deny all responsibility and will call for a report* This will, no doubt, show con clusively that the shaikh of Kuwait has been oppressing his fellaheen for years, and that the poor devils have been driven to 'to kick' at last, (the common method adopted in the oa&amp;e of the 'A1 3aadun')* Government will then deem it right to interfere out of an honest and disinterest ed desire to see justice done to their Iraqi subjects etc \ etc* and no one can say how the matter will end* Yours sincerely, ^d.H.R.r.Dickson.At'** e \ S u fl 1 A y Telegram Fro a ^ To G.T.C.

His Majesty's Government have learnt with great concern of the attitude and activities of the fellaheen on the Sheikh of Koweit's Fao Estate who are not only indulging in a no-rent campaign but are new reported to have committed acts of sabotage and intimidation. Mudir of Fao has already warned fellaheen at request of Sheikh's agent, but without ■v-i r*' ri ult As Iraqi Government are aware. Sheikh of Koweit is in special treaty relations with His Majesty's Government who regard themselves as under a particular obligation to safe guard his interests. They therefore take a most serious view of this development, and count on the Iraqi Government to issue immediate instructions to the Mutessarif of Basra to give the Sheikh’s agent at Fao all such support as is necessary to preserve his rights and bring the situation under effective control.

Theae, as you are aware, are the largest hy far of all the 'Shaikh’s properties on the fJhatt al Arah, and + he^ stretch aone 7 miles alon* the rltfktt bank of the rlve^, till the sea ia reached. 3* Speaking from memory these properties which were smaller then than they are now (much fresh land haring been acquired from the sea since) were {?iren to one of the early 'Ihaikhs of Kuwait some 20© wars aro, as a deed of gift by one Shaikh ^aohid al Saadun, as a reward for the Al 'hibah assistance in a desert war, and in particular for an act on the field of battle when the then Shaikh of Kuwait, eared the life of the donor. 4* Such deed of gift is known as a ‘rabbiyah', and has down to the present time been considered unassailable under Ottoman T,aw. Hence the rarious later Shaikhs of Kuwait hare newer attempted to take out H apu papers for their ?ao v states. 6 . Mr. Gabriel pointed out that in his opinion, itwa« wry neoensary to-rtny for the nhailch to t«Ve out T a pu deedn for theae 'ao iSatntea, not beoauae thr original 'wahhlyeh* deed' oould he oonteeted, hut hecauae 1+ aaa evident all round that the ’1«M Oovemwent eerr Intereated in hrlnfrlnp: preaaure on the '^alMia of «malt for political with Kuwait then there would hare been no uanre at all , hut. aa an ‘Iraqi he had to admit that the contrary wn» t- &lt;• oaoe, and it waa clear that the ‘Iraq Government waa acting and might continue to act in a diatinotly unfriendly manner *• Vipuc ^ 1 wii# ^•H|?®5*o 6. ^hen * aiiked T'r. aab-lei what waa the form auch danger might take, he replied ae followa. ^here would bo no attack, on the line that the Shaikh* of Kuwait had no ' atm deedfi. that line of procedure need rot be feared in haw, but uhat was to prevent the Kudir of ?ao, acting on aeoret order* from Baghdad (throat the Mutmsarrif, ^kiarnh) and atidring up the fellaheen tenante to commit acta of 'aabotage ',(auch aa cutting down palm treea and selling thwm same), refusing to pav rente to their landlord, and lodging a complaint to government that they, the fellaheen, were the original owners of the soil, and that their lands had wrongfully been given over to the Shaikhs of Kuwait, and claiming that ouch lands be restored to them again, (Irish fashion). *n unfriendly ^raq could easily make it convenient to encourage such eomnlaints, and even assist the ^ellaheen to bring their case to the Courts and supply them with expert leral advice'. If ouch were to happen said Kr.Cabriel, there is reasons. In his words:' had 'YWi been on friendly terms no/3- lli 3 5S ■ no knowing what mipht bo th© eTonttial re atilt of etich nroeeedlnre# hut he opined that it waa quite on the card* that the 'thalkh of Kuwait would find him»elf ewentually deprived of all his ^ao propertlee. In Mi same way that many Baadun ownere of vast eetatee on the ^uphratea, hn recent veare found theweelvea deprived of half and even no re of thilr lande *hich had reverted to the trlbee (fellaheen) who irlpinally cultivated the lande # and had for centuries been looked upon aa ’•earakeel',l*e. tenants oi the land. t o counteract atioh a poeeihle move on the Government ’a part Mr. Gahrlel «ald It was imperative for the present ?*haSkh to take out ‘ apu papere. l*he preat difficulty in doins thla eald Hr. Gabriel, wan that the hoira to-day numbered two or three hundred aoula. inclndlnp a host of women, and that the ^aikh would find it moot difficult to pet hold of all their names, and have them Included in any '’apu deeds taken out. He had nevertheleaa advised the ^alkh to authorise him to tnke action on the above lines but for the present the Shaikh, apart from pointing out the almost insurmountable difficulties of such procedure, had done nothing. 9. After Mr. Gabriel’s departure the halkh dis missed the matter with me, and said he quite saw the wisdom of Mr. Gabriel’s advice but felt the di fioul^ies were too preat. and action on his part would be interpreted by the manv members of his family to an attempt to rob them of their rights. He was therefore real! afraid to act, and must be plven time to think. 9 10. A curious thin* recently happened in connection with these ^o ’states. ^arly in Va 1033, the 'utasarttf, Basrah, sent a committee down to 'ao to examine and value the 'haikh '* '%o nrowty. X oMnot eee wh«t rlf^t he hadto do thlt^ but he dirt nevqrniSlejJL- n, he property conoiet* of over 6,000 ^ja^iba'’* ^ y#a* or t^o awro a f jariV nas worth easily «s«1000/- # This would have «ade the ^ao pro pert lee worth T!e.60,00,000 or approximat eJy &amp; 400,000/-. AsmiatiniB: that the value sf lard has fallen by half, which 1 do not think is the case, then the value ©f the property would to-day be approxina ely * P00,000/-. r ^he Thitasarrlf f s comwlttee after waklnft their aec^et investigation valued the ^states a 4 ^ ^4,000/- ©r A 64,000/-, an obviously ridiculous firure. bir 1» an open secret in B*erah to-day.
