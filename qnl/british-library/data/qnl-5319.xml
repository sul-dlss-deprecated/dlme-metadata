'UZ^C^CA Sir, V\ ith reference to the instructions issued by the Auditor General under Fundamental Rule 74, I have the honour to state that with effect from 1st January 1922, from which date the Fundamental Rules came into force, a leave account of all officers prescribed in Fundamental Rule 76 should be kept in the form referred to in para. 33 ol the instructions. Fhe leave account of all gazetted officers 'will be prepared by Audit officers from the Histoiy of Services, but in the case of non-gazetted officers their leave accounts are re quired to be prepared by a reference to the service books. 1 would request therefore that leave accounts may be opened in respect of non-gazetted officers serving in your office and in the offices subordinate to your administrative control. If necessary, I can assist by preparing the account of a few officers, if a few service books are sent to me. It would be convenient if the leave accounts were pasted at the end of the service books of the official concerned. I would also request that when the work is completed an intimation may kindly be sent to this office, so that I may arrange, if necessary, for the inspec tion of the leave account along w\tl\ the service bock by an officer of the Audit Department.

Ai ran genient has been made for the printing of these forms by the Press and Forms Manager, Bengal, and they may be obtained bv requi sition on that officer. The number assigned to the forms have been noted against each, and they should be introduced as soon as possible. 2. In order to efford facilities to the new system of audit the following instructions should be noted for guidance :— (i) In the annual establishment returns to be furnished in future, the names of all temporary men in service on the date to which the returns relate, indicating which of them are officiating in tempo rary and which in permanent vacancies should be shown. (ii) As soon as an establishment is brought on to a time scale of pav the initial pay statement should be prepared and forwarded to this office. (in) In the pay bills the names of the men holding permanent posts should he entered in order of seniority as measured by substantive pay drawn, and below those will be shown the posts left vacant and the men officiating in the permanent vacancies. This proce dure should also be observed in preparing the annual establish ment returns. The instructions at foot of the establishment bill and the absentee statement forms should be carefully noted in preparing the bill, and the absentee statement columns 6 and 7 of the bill need not he filled in by the drawing officer, but as sayings and extra cost will have to he worked out separately by this office for purposes of audit, a complete leave statement should invariably be furnished with every bill, (iv) The periodical increment certificate should invariably be furnished with the bill whenever necessary. (v) All changes in the scales of the permanent establishment due to retirements, transfers, deaths and consequent new appointments and increases and decreases of scale should be shown in the absentee statement. The number of permanent posts left un filled each month should also be shown in the absentee statement, and if there is no unfilled post in any month the fact should be recorded therein.2 . * The absentee statement should be divided into sections corresponding to sections in the bill, and arrangements affecting each section should be shown together. In the case of amalgamated establishments for which hills are drawn for more than one centre the necessary information should be furnished in the consolidated establishment lists and absentee statements. Pay of establishments for which annual establishment returns are sent to this office and of those for which no annual returns are sent should be drawn on separate bills. As it will not be possible for you to obtain the new forms in time, I would request that the information required for audit may kindly be furnished n existing form of bills and absentee statements in respect of the pay bills for July 1922. {vi) (vii) (viii) I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, U.

Estimate for the year 1922-23 from which it will be seen that separate provi sions have been made in the Estimates for Supplies and Services ” and “ Contingencies.” This distinction between “ Supplies and Services ” and “ Contingencies ” has been reintroduced as under the new arrangement intro duced by the Reforms these two heads have become separate units of appro priation and are to be shown separately in the Budget and in the accounts. The general principle followed in differentiating between the two heads is laid down below. Supplies and Services .—Comprise charges which are incurred for the technical working of the department concerned, i.e., charges which are not merely incidental, but represent the main and proper activities of the depart ment, e.g., Rewards to Informers, Purchase of apparatus, value of and freight on European stores, Books for a Public Library, Exhibits for a Museum, etc. Such charges are for the most part peculiar to the department in which they are incurred. Contingencies .—Comprise those charges which are incidental to the management of an office as an office, e.g.&gt; purchase of ordinary books and periodicals, purchase of stationery, etc. Such expenditure is of much the same kind whatever the department be to which the officer incurring them belongs. I would request, therefore, that you will be good enough to examine the detailed heads included in the Budget Estimate under the group heads “ Supplies and Services ” and “ Contingencies ” in the light of the above remarks and report to me within a fortnight of the receipt of this letter whether any modification in the classification is necessary. 2. As “ Supplies and Services ” and “ Contingencies ” have become separate units of appropriation, charges incurred under these heads are to be recorded separately in the audit registers and in the accounts. With a view also to the saving of stationery I would request that henceforth charges falling under these two heads may be drawn in two separate sections, two separate memo randa of allotment and expenditure being shown on the bills. The second memorandum may be in manuscript until the form is revised. The contingent expenditure incurred by you up to date should be distributed between the^two heads, and a statement showing the amounts of the original bills and how they are distributed between the two heads should be furnished to this office so as to enable me to correct my audit registers, etc. Imperial Secretariat Buildings.

As regards the sorting and donkey hire, I beg to say that one-third of present donkey hire rates seems to me sufficient, but the matter could be considered when the Ardhiya rates are reconsidered.

RESOLUTION, S'* 1 The Government of India have had under consideration the question of the applicability of the revised leave rules published with Resolution No. 1367- C.S.R., dated the 29th July 1920, to officers subject to the Indian Service Leave Rules, who were on leave on the date of their introduction. Under the opera tion of Article 4, Civil Service Regulations, the benefit of any change in the leave rules made during an officer’s leave cannot accrue to him until he returns to duty hut it has been decided, with the approval of His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, to make an exception to the general rule and to allow the benefit of the new rules to all officers who were on leave on the z9th July 1920 and who elect to come under them. Such an officer may therefore cancel the unexpired portion of his leave from that date and substitute for it any period of leave to which he will be entitled under the new r rules. Ordered that the Resolution be communicated to the severel Departments of the Government of India (including Financial Advisers), all Provincial Governments and Minor Local Governments, the Auditor-General, the Heads o Departments subordinate to the Finance Department, all Account ants-General, the Comptroller, Assam, the Chief Auditors of State Railways and Government Examiners of Railway Accounts, the Examiner of Accounts, Military Worxs Services, the Examiner, Government Press Accounts, the Contioller of Mar Accounts, the Audit Officer, Delhi Province, the Examiner of Customs Accounts, the Deputy Accountant-General, Central Revenues, Simla, the Auditoi, Government of India Sanctions, the Audit Officer, Bombay Development Scheme and to the Assistant Audit Officer, Delhi.

Sir, In continuation of paragraph 2 of Mr.Hau's letter Ho. 962-B.B.,dated the 19th July 1921, I am directed to say that that the Government of India have decided to adopt the practice obtaining in the India Office of acquainting an applicant for commutation of pension before final orders are issued, of the capitalized value payable to him, and of giving him the option of accepting or refusing the amount within a given period. This procedure is proposed because applicants for commutation have notealways the means of knowing to what amount they will be entitled and it is reasonable that they should be so informed before the transaction is finally completed. 2. I am to suggest that a similar procedure might be Madras adopted by the Government of Bombay etc., , if they Bengal consider it desirable and to forward herewith a specimen draft form which may be adopted for general use in this connection.

His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India has been pleased to decide that additional pensions shall be granted to military officers who have held certain high civil posts and have fulfilled the conditions stated in the follow ing paragraphs. 2. The additional pensions will be of two classes; a higher pension of £200 a year and a lower pension of £100 a year. Their grant will be subject to the condition that the total pension of an officer receiving the higher class additional pension shall not exceed £1,000 a year and that of an officer receiving the lower class shall not exceed £900 a year. 3. (a) The pensions will be earned by approved service of the following kinds in a qualifying post:— (i) Three years’ substantive service ; or (*i) Three years’ continuous officiating service ; or ^ (Hi) Three years’ continuous officiating and substantive service. (£) All privilege leave, an d 11 leave which, under the terms of the resolution of the Government of India in the Finance Department No. 1260- G. S. R., dated the 21st December 1921, counts as privilege leave, will, if taken during such service, count as service. 4. The posts qualifying for the higher pension will be all civil posts which now carry a pay of not less than 114,000 a month. The posts qualifying for the lower pension will be all civil posts which now carry a pay of not less than ±t3,000 a month. 5. The period of three years’ service prescribed in paragraph 3 above is an absolute minimum, and no portion of either class of additional pension will be admissible to an officer who has held a qualifying post for a shorter period. A period of three years, spent partly in a post or posts qualifying for the higher, and partly in a post or posts qualifying for the lower class additional pension, will, however, entitle an officer to a lower class pension. 6. An officer serving in a post on a progressive or time-scale pay rising to a maximum of R3,000 or of R4,000 will be entitled to count as qualifying for a lower or higher pension, as‘the case may be, that portion only of his service during which he has drawn the maximum pay of the post. 7. These rules will apply w ith effect from the 1st April 1919 to all officers who retired from civil employ after the 4th August 1914. They will apply to an officer who retired from civil employ before that date if he was recalled during the great war for fuither civil employment in a qualifying post in India and completed in all three years’ service in such a post.Obdered that the Resolution be communicated to the several Depart ments of the Government of India (including the Financial Advisers), all Provincial Governments and Minor Local Governments, the Auditor General, the Heads of Departments subordinate to the Finance Department, all Accountants General, the Comptroller, Assam, the Chief Auditors of State Railways and Government Examiners of Railway Accounts, the Examiner of Accounts, Military Works Services, the Examiner, Government Press Accounts, the Controller of War Accounts, the Examiner of Customs Accounts, the Deputy Accountant General, Central Revenues, Delhi, the Audit Officer, Bombay Development Scheme, the Audit Officer, Delhi (New Capital), and the Auditor of Government of India Sanctions.

Enquiry has been made whether officers with families who have submitted application to retire on proportionate pension but are compelled to proceed on leave before your orders are received in order to avoid travel in hot weather will if you sanction retirement subsequently be entitled to receive cost of nassap'o money. Para. 5 of our Resolution of 8th November 1021 does not provide for the case as it is not contemplated that retiring officers should leave India before sanction to retirement Is received. Ve are inclined to think special consideration due to officers with families in circumstances mentioned and discretion should be yiven to local Hovernments to decide whether in individual cases pratuity should be granted to officers on ground that their denarture before receirt o^ sanction was unavoidable. Ooncyession would be confined £ to officers with families compelled to leave in interests of families. Gratuity would be payable in London on receint of your sanction to retirement.Telegram T’rom Secretary of State. To Viceroy (-iome Department). Dated London, the 23 th Fehrnary 1022 .

Jb'unds, Service ana Ofcner. Dated Delhi, the 29th March 1922. RESOLUTION. In paragraph 3 of Finance Department Resolution No. 1559-E. A., dated the 16th August 1921, the Government of Inh'a have issued general orders on the question of compensation to officers of the Services on account of low rates of exchange. As several representations have been received as to the position, in regard to these orders, of those services and appointments from which exchange compensation allowance has not been expressly withdrawn, it is necessary to amplify the orders to remove all doubts on the question of this allowance. 2. The position of the various services may briefly be explained as follows:— (1) In pursuance of the general policy of Government that exchange compensation allowance should cease to be admissible on the occasion of a revision of pay of a service or appointment previous ly entitled to the concession, the allowance had already been withdrawn prior to the Report of the Public Services Commis sion from the Indian Forest Service, the Indian Police (except those officers who were recruited before 1906) and from the great majority of officers in the Indian Political Department, the Public Works Department and certain other services. (2) At the introduction of revised scales of pay as a result of the Report of the Public Services Commission, exchange compensation allowance was specifically withdrawn from other services, e.g. r the Indian Civil Service and the Civil Veterinary Department. The allowance^ was also definitely held to be inadmissible to the Indian Medical Service at the last revision of the scale of pay. (3) In certain other services, such as the Indian Educational Service, the Ecclesiastical Department and the Indian Audit Department, no definite pronouncement was made at the time of introduction of the revised rates of pay, as at that time the question did not immediately arise owing to the high rates of exchange then prevailing. 3. The absence of definite orders in cases falling under the third category has given rise to doubts as to the intention of Government. The whole vquestion has therefore been considered, and the Government of India, with the approval of the Secretary of State, now desire to reaffirm the principle adopted in the past and adhered to in revisions of recent date that exchange compensa tion allowance should cease to be admissible to services and appointments the pay of which has recently been revised. From the date of'introduction ot revised rates of pay, the allowance is therefore declared to ba inadmissible to— (i) The Indian Educational Service; (ii) Officers of the Indian Audit Department and the Ecclesiastical Department previously entitled to exchange compensation allowance; (iff) Residents in the Indian Political Department, (though the pay of 1st Class Residents has remained unchanged, the pay of the service, as a whole, has been revised). (iv) Officers of the Indian Police Service, except those appointed prior to 1906 who retain the right to the allowance; (v) Officers in all other services and special appointments in respect of whom no specific declaration of inadmissibility has been made at the time of revision of pay. 4 The terms of paragraph 3 of the Finance Department Resolution No. 1559-E. A. of the 16th August 1921 will in such cases operate to safeguard officers against actual loss of emoluments. 5. The Judges of High Courts were entitled to exchange compensation allowance under the Statutory Rules sot forth in Articde 543 of the Civil Service Regulations, under which every judge is allowed to draw, in addition to his salary, any exchange compensation allowance which may be sanctioned for public servants generally. As the allowance has now been generally withdrawal, the statutory rules will be amended and Judges will not be entitled to any allowance calculated on pay earned after the 1st April ,1922. Any person, however, who as Chief Justice or Judge drew exchange compensa tion allowance before this withdrawal of the allowance from public servants generally will be protected from actual reduction of emoluments, owing to such withdrawal, by the grant of personal pay as provided in paragraph 3 of Resolution No. 1559-E. A., dated the I6th August 1921, when, and for so long as, he holds the same or a similar post on the same pay. 6. Officers serving on contract in which exchange compensation allowance forms part of the terms of the contract may retain the right to the allowance during the period of their existing engagement. 7. Jt has been brought to the notice of Government that in consequence of the omission to announce the w ithdrawal of exchange compensation allow ance, audit officers have in some cases passed the allowance w r hich has thus been draw n by officers not entitled to it under the present orders The Govern ment of India are, however, pleased to declare that such amounts shall not be recovered, but such allow ance shall cease to be drawn on pay earned .after the 1st April 1922. 8. Officers who, on the 1st April 1922, are on leave and in receipt of leave salary which includes exchange compensation allowance, should continue, during leave, to draw excuange compensation allowance, instead of personal allowance in lieu thereof. Ordered that a copy be forwarded to the several Departments of the Government of India ; to all local Governments and Administrations; to the Financial Adviser, Military Finance ; to the Auditor General ; to the Control ler of the Currency ; to the Mint and Assay Masters, Calcutta and Bombay.

GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. FINANCE DEPARTMENT. Simla, the 25th September 1923. RESOLUTION. The Secretary of State in Council is pleased to prescribe, with reference to Fundamental Rule 84, the following rules to regulate the grant of leave to officers lor the study of scientific, technical or similar problems, or in order to undertake special courses of instruction. They have effect from the 1st January 1922. Rules for the grant of additional leave to Officers for the Study of Scientific, Technical or Similar Problems, or in order to undertake special Courses of Instruction. The following rules relate to study leave only. They are not intended to meet the case of officers deputed to other countries at the instance of Government, either for the performance of special duties imposed on them or for the investi gation of specific problems connected with their technical duties. Such cases will continue to be dealt with on their merits under the provisions of Rules 50 and 51 of the Fundamental Rules. The rules apply to the Arclueological Depart ment, the Sanitary and Bacteriological Departments (other than as regards officers of the Indian Medical Service, to whom special rules apply), the Botanical Survey (including the officers of the Royal Botanic Garden, Calcutta), the C ivil \ eterinary Department, the Factory Department, the Geological Survey, the Agricultural Department, the Meteorological Department, the Railway Department ;Traffic, Locomotive and Engineering Branches), the Telegraph Department, the Zoological Survey, the Education Department, the Public Works Department and the Forest Department (except in respect of continental tours, to which special rules apply). The rules may be extended by the authorities em powered to sanction study leave under Rule 1 to any officer, including an officer of a Provincial Service, not belonging to any of the departments mentioned above, in whose case the sanctioning authority is of opinion that leave should be granted in the public interests to pursue a special course of study or investigation of a scientific or technical nature. Note.— -Ihe extension of these rules to the Public V orks Department does not affect the existing rule under which officers of less than 12 years’ service are allowed to visit engineering works when on leave in Great Britain, travelling expenses only being reimbursed. 1. Extra furlough for the purpose of study leave may be taken either in or outside India. It may be granted to an officer of any of the departments named above by the Local Government or Administration under which he is serving, provided that when an officer borne permanently on the cadre of one province or department is serving temporarily in another province or department the grant of leave is subject to the conditions (a) that the sanctioning authority can make local arrangements to carry on his work in his absence, and (5) that the sanction of the province or department to which he is permanently attached is obtained before leave is given. Study leave should not ordinarily be granted to officers of less than five years service or to officers within three years of the date at which they have the option ol retiring, or, if they have the option of retiring after 20 years service, within three years of the date at which they will complete 25 years’ service. Nor should it be granted to officers who are about to retire on proportionate pension. 2. The grant of study leave should be made with due regard to the exigencies of the public service. In no case should the grant of this leave, in combination with ordinary leave, involve an absence of over two years from an officer’s regular duties, or exceed two years in the whole period of an officer’s service ; nor should it be granted with such frequency as to remove him from contact with his regular voik or to cause cadre difficulties owing to his absence on leave. A period of 12 months at one time should ordinarily be regarded as a suitable maximum, and should not be exceeded save for exceptional reasons.2 3. An officer whose study leave is combined with any other kind of leave should be required to take his period of study leave at such a time as to retain, at its conclusion, a balance of other previously sanctioned leave sufficient to cover the period spent in returning to duty. 4. When an officer has been granted a definite period of study leave and finds subsequently that his course of study will fall short of the sanctioned period to any considerable extent, his absence from duty should be reduced by the excess period of study leave unless he produces the assent of the sanctioning authority in India to his taking it as ordinary furlough. 5. Except as provided in Rule 6, all applications for study leave should be submitted with the audit officer’s certificate to the Head of the Department through the prescribed channel, and the course or courses of study contemplated and any examination which the candidate proposes to undergo should be clearly specified therein. C&gt;. Officers on furlough or other leave in Europe or America, who wish to have part ot it converted into study leave,-should address the High Commissioner for India and should attach (1) a statement showing how they propose to spend the study leave, and (2) documentary evidence that their application for the particular course of study or examination proposed has the approval of the proper authorities in India. Similarly, officers on furlough or other leave in Europe or America who desire to have it extended for purposes of study, should address the High Commissioner, but in addition to the above requirements they must support their applications with documentary evidence of their having obtained the approval of the authorities concerned in India to their applying for an extension of leave. 7. A study allowance will be granted for the period spent in prosecuting a definite course of study at a recognised institution or in any definite tour of inspection of any special class of work, as well as for the period covered by any examination at the end of the course of study. The rates as at present fixed are 12^. a day in the Cnited Kingdom, H. a day on the continent of Europe, and 305. a day in the United States of America. These rates are liable to revision. The rate to be granted to officers who take study leave in other countries, including India, will be specially considered by the High Commissioner or the Government of India, as the case may be, in each case. In no case will subsistence allowance be granted in addition to study allowance, and ordinarily travelling expenses will not be paid, but in exceptional cases claims will be considered on their merits by the Government of India or High Commissioner. 8. Study allowance will be admissible up to 14 days for any period of vacation. A period during which an officer interrupts his course for his own convenience cannot be considered as vacation. In the case of an officer retiring from the service without returning to duty after a period of study leave the study allow ance will be forfeited. If the officer is under civil leave rules the study leave will be converted into furlough to the extent of the furlough standing to his credit at the date of retirement. Any balance of the period of study leave mentioned above which cannot be so converted will be excluded in reckoning service for pension. 9. Officers granted study leave are ordinarily required to meet the cost of tees paid for courses of study. In exceptional cases the High Commissioner or the Government ot India, as the case may be, will be prepared to consider pro posals that such tees should be paid by Government. 10. On completion of a course of study a certificate on the proper form (which may be obtained from the High Commissioner) together with certificates of examinations passed or of special study, shall, when the studv leave has been taken in Europe or America, be forwarded to the High Commissioner. When the study leave has been taken in any other country certificates of examinations passed or oi special study, which should show the dates of commencement and termination of the course, with any remarks by the instructor, shall be forwarded to the authority which sanctioned the leave. In the case of a definite course of study at a recognised institution the study allowance will be payable by the High Commissioner or in India, as the case may be, on claims submitted by the officer from time to time, supported by proper' certificates of attendance.' When the programme of study approved under Rule 5 does not include or does not consist entirely of such a course of study, the officer shall submit to the High Com missioner or to the authority in India which sanctioned his leave, as the case may be, a diary showing how his time has been spent, and a report indicating3 fully the nature of the methods and operations which have been studied, and including suggestions as to the possibility of applying such methods or operations to India. The High Commissioner or the sanctioning authority in India, as the case may be, will decide whether the diary and report show that the time of the officer has been properly employed, and will determine accordingly for what period the study allowance referred to in Rule 7 may be granted. 11. Study leave will count as service for promotion and pension, but not for furlough or any other leave. It will not affect any leave which may already be due to an officer ; it will count as extra furlough, and will not be taken into account in reckoning the aggregate amount of furlough taken by the officer towards the maximum period admissible under the Fundamental Rules. 12. During study leave an officer will draw half average pay as defined in Rule 9 (2) of the Fundamental Rules, subject to the maxima and minima laid down in Rules 89 and 90, ibid. The rate of exchange prescribed by the Secretary of State in Council for the conversion of leave salary (other than that admissible during the first four months of a period of leave on average pay) shall apply to study leave allowances. An officer may, subject to the approval of the proper authorities being obtained as required by Rules 5 or 6, undertake or commence a course of study during leave on average pay, and, subject to paragraphs 7 and 8, draw study allowance in respect thereof, provided that study allowance is not drawn for an aggregate period exceeding two years during the whole of an officer’s service. This rule applies to military officers in civil employment taking leave under the Fundamental Rules. A military officer taking leave under military rules will draw the furlough pay admissible to him under those rules ; if on com bined leave he may be permitted to commence a course of study before the end of his privilege leave, and draw for such period the study allowance admissible under Rule 7, without forfeiture of privilege leave allowances, the full amount of study leave taken being, for all purposes of record and subsequent calculation of leave, post-dated as if it commenced at the end of the privilege leave. 13. On an application for study leave in Europe or America being sanctioned by the Government of Madras, Bombay or Bengal, the local Government should inform the High Commissioner ot the particulars of the case. When such leave is sanctioned by any other local Government or Administration a report should be made to the Government of India, who will inform the High Commissioner. It will be necessary for the officer concerned to place himself in communication with the High Commissioner, who will arrange any details and issue any letters cf introduction that may be required. In all cases in which study leave in any other country is sanctioned the particulars should be reported to the Government •of India.

A, —Travelling Allowance. 10' Officers travelling on duty in the United Kingdom may, when away from headquarters, draw daily allowance at the rates stated in Eule 7 for periods not exceeding fourteen days at one place. After that, if still detained on duty in the same place, half rates only are allowed, unless special sanction is oh rained. 11. Eor the first day of a journey away from headquarters, or of the return journey thereto, or when sucli a journey is completed in one day, only half rates of daily allowance are admissible. Local journeys in the vicinity of head qua’ters do not entitle an officer not otherwise eligible for the allowance to these rates. B. —Subsistence Allowance. 12.

'When sent from India on deputation, an officer may be granted daily allowances in this country from date of landing to date of re-embarkation at two-thirds the rate of daily allowanceistated in Rule 7, when not in receipt of the full allowance admit ted by that rule and in lieu of the rates allowed by Rule 10. This would be in addition to travelling expenses where allowed. In cases or doubt, Heads of Departments may decide as to the application of this rule. 14. Cancelled. 15. In eases where officers on leave undertake work at their own request travelling expenses may be granted where such duty involves travelling, but other allowances are not called for. 17^FD—-1,640— 21*8-23—OCTSCopy of a letter No*F.261-5-.B5* Publicdated Sl^la # the 1st October,1923 # from the Offg, Joint Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department, to the Chief Secretary to the Government of the Punjab, Qnployment on foreign service may be recteoadd as private employment in the case of Officers who are on leave pre paratory to retirement.

Audit, etc. RESOLUTION. The Governor General in Council has read with interest the report of the Public Accounts Committee on the accounts of the year 1921-22. He fully shares their confidence in the value of the scrutiny of the Committee in bringing defects to light and suggesting remedies, and is glad to have an opportunity of expressing his appreciation of the service already rendered by the Committee in the first year of its effective working. 2. The Reforms, under which the control of a large part of the expendi ture from the revenues of India has devolved on a body outside the executive Government, have necessitated a new conception of the 'objects and methods of audit and have given a newer meaning and a more real importance to appro priation audit. In order to make the control of the Legislative Assembly effective, it is essential that for each vote there shall be designated an officer responsible for watching the expenditure, so as to ensure as far as possible that sanctioned grants are not exceeded, and if an excess is, for unforeseen reasons, unavoidable, to see that supplementary grants are obtained as soon as possible after the probability of an excess is foreseen This ques tion is under investigation. Meanwhile, the Government of India have considered the best method of minimising the difficulties pointed out, in paragraph 3 of the Committee’s report in the way of their getting full oral explanations of excesses in expenditure. They have come to the conclusion that the only practicable way for the present is to impose this duty on the several departments of the Government of India in respect of the expenditure on the various branches of the public service under their control. The Depart ment on whose request the Assembly votes a certain sum of money for certain purpose is in a real sense responsible for the expenditure and the Governor General in Council consequently directs that, for the pre sent, each Department shall be held responsible for devising means for watching the progress of expenditure and for explaining to the Committee any excesses in expenditure. For this purpose, each Department should scrutinise carefully all the audit and appropriation reports as soon as they are received from the audit officer, and get without delay whatever explana tions are necessary from its subordinate officers, in order that an officer of the Department may be able to appear without further notice before the Committee whenever called upon to do so and give any explanations necessary. In certain cases it may possibly be more advantageous to make the chief head of a department under the Government of India partly responsible, e.g., as regards the heads Income-tax, Salt and Customs, the Central Board of Revenue may with propriety be held liable to give the necessary explanation. Similarly for the various special departments, officers, like the Director General, Posts and Telegraphs, the Surveyor General, or the Inspector General of Forests may be held responsible. In such cases, one of the latter officers mav be associated with a representative of the Department concerned in appearing before the Committee to give the required information. In so far as the supplyv\ 2 t ' M of information regarding irregularities discovered in audit is concerned, it will be helpful to the^Departments if the Committee can arrange to go through the reports as soon as they are available and indicate the points on which they will require detailed information or justification. It is hoped that such a proce dure will be possible as otherwise the Departments which have to collect the detailed information from their subordinate officers stationed at remote places may have to undertake a great deal of labour to obtain particulars which are not eventually required by the Committee. 3. The Governor General in Council has also considered the question to which reference was made in the Assembly, of expediting the preparation of the audit and appropriation reports. He has no doubt that the Auditor Gene ral will do his best to meet the wishes of the Assembly in this matter ; hut it seems very doubtful whether, at the earliest, it would be practicable to get the reports* ready before the January or February following the close of the year, particularly as the Committee has desired that the reports should deal \\ith the expenditure in greater detail than at present. Even if it were possi ble to have the appropriation reports in February— and if it were practicable for the auditor of Home Accounts to send his report with regard to expenditure incurred in England by the India Office and the High Commissioner for India so early—it would he difficult if not impossible for the Public Accounts Com mittee to hold continuous sittings in February and March to examine the accounts with sufficient fullness. It would moreover he extremely inconven ient for the officials whose task it will he to explain excesses to spare sufficient time for this purpose when they are pre-occupied with the Budget and the sittings of the legislature. Consequently it appears that the earliest convenient time for the Committee to meet would be in April or May. Their report cannot therefore be placed before the House till the autumn session, and for all practical purposes it would be sufficient, as well as more economical and convenient to the members themselves, if they met shortly before that session, as in the present year. Arrangements will however be made to summon the members somewhat earlier in future so as to have more time for meetings before the beginning of the legislative session in order that the report can he placed before the house at the opening of the session, and preliminary sittings can he arranged in February or March as soon as the audit reports become available in order to enable the Committee to indicate the points in regard to which they require detailed information. 4 . The Governor General in Council has given his most careful considera tion to the various recommendations made by the Committee in their report and the opinions expressed by them as shown in the proceedings of their meetings ; and he is glad to find himself in agreement with the Committed on almost all the points noticed by them. He desires that the particular attention of the several Departments of the Government of India and of officers subordinate to them should be drawn to the comments of the Committee. The more important of these are dealt with below in the order in which they occur in the report. 5. Paragraph 9 of thr Report .—The principle of this recommendation is accepted by the Government, viz., that no changes in classification should ordinarily he made which will have the effect of accounting for expen diture under a head other than that in which funds have been provided for it. 6. Paragraph 10 of the Report.— T £\\e question of the necessity or suita bility of having separate grants for expenditure in England will be considered in consultation with the Auditor General. It will be seen that at present in some cases {e. g., Stamps, Railways, Irrigation, Posts and Telegraphs, Civil Works, Superannuation allowances, Stationery and Printing) the expenditure in England is included in the Indihn grant; while in the ease of the other items all expenditure in England is collected together in two grants under the control of the Secretary of State and the High Commissioner respectively. One of the chief difficulties in the way of splitting up English expenditure and including the portion relating to expenditure connected with a particular demand under that demand is that the High Commissioner would have a number of separate items of expenditure, more or less small, under his controland could not re-appropriate from one to the other without the sanction of the Assembly. Similar difficulties in the case of Chief Commissioners’ provinces in India have necessitated the constitution of certain demands based not on tne object of expenditure, but on the areas in which the expenditure is incurred, e.g , there are in the Demands for 1923-24) nine separate territorial Demands, viz. —N.-W. P., Baluchistan, Delhi, Coorg, Ajmer and Merwara, Andamans and Nicobar Islands, Bajputana, Central India and Hyderabad for each of which a total sum is voted by the Assembly, though the grant is distributed in detail among the various account heads. The total expenditure voted under any particular head can be obtained from the Budget Estimates, and is also shown in abstract form in the beginning of the Book of Demands. 7. Paragraphs lo -19 of the Report. —The. Governor General in Council accepts fully the procedure recommended by the Public Accounts Committee in respect of supplementary grants and excesses in expenditure 8 . Paragraph 20 of the Report. —As has already been pointed out, the question of making a particular officer responsible for expenditure under each vote and of the measures to be taken to make such responsibility effective are already under investigation The question of control by means of limiting money issues will also receive careful consideration, but in the absence of a system of central issues as in the United Kingdom a solution is not easy. Disbursements from Central Revenues may occur in any of the treasuries in India or in England and may be brought to account in the books of any of the provincial Accountants General or in the Home Accounts. One of the consequences of the large number of disbursing centres is that accounts cannot be absolutely up to date and it is often not possible to asceitain at any moment the exact' ex penditure debitable to a particular vote. As how ever, the total grants voted by the Assembly are distributed among various sub-heads and funds are allot ted separately to the actual disbursing authorities, the Governor General in Council is of opinion that some improvement may follow' if these officers realize the absolute necessity of obtaining funds from the Assembly where their sanction is necessary, and from the executive Government in respect of non-voted items, before incurring expenditure, except in circumstances of such emergency as to justify the incurring of voted expenditure before the necessary vote can be obtained from the Assembly. The various Departments are therefore directed to take the necessary steps for this purpose and to obtain the previous approval of the Finance Department where for reasons of emer gency it is proposed to incur voted expenditure in anticipation of a supplemen tary vote. 9. Paragraph 21 of the Report. —The Governor General in Council has carefully considered this question and agrees with the opinion expressed in the last sentence of this paragraph xvhich runs as follows : — “ Ordinarily the executive should, it is suggested, have power to vary the expenditure within a grant so long as they spend it within the purposes of the grant, and the remedy for preventing abuses of the power of reappropriation is to split up the vote where such abuses occur into two or more votes.” This is not only convenient in practice, but strictly correct in theory from the constitutional point of view as under Section 67-A (6) of the Government of India Act the Assembly assents or refuses its assent to the demand as a whole ; any reduction effected is a reduction of the whole grant and so long as the executive keeps within the total granted the Assembly is not concerned further with details of the expenditure. Cases in which expenditure is incur red for purposes not approved of or specially disapproved of by the Assembly or the Standing finance Committee would in the unlikely event of their occurring at all be brought to notice by the Auditor General in the audit and appropriation reports. In view also of the pow T ers of intervention of the Stand ing Finance Committee the Governor General in Council is of opinion tlmt unless the present procedure is proved by experience to lead to evasion of parliamentary control, no change is called for. 10. Paragraph 22 of the Report. —The question of sub-division of the demands finder Posts and Telegraphs will be considered, and if any alterationis found feasible, it will be given effect to as soon as possible. The similar question in the case of Railways must be considered in connection with the question of sepai ating the Railway Budget from the ordinary Budget, 11 . Paragraph 23 of the Report. —The question of the possibility of amplifying the appropriation reports is being considered in consultation with the Auditor General who is generally responsible for their preparation and will doubtless do his best to meet the wishes of the Committee as far as possible. Any considerable elaboration of the reports w T ould however mean not only delay but increased work in accounts offices, a good deal of which at any rate would probabh not give results commensurate with the labour involved. The Governor General in Council has noted the desire expressed in the debate in the Assembly that the appropriation and audit reports should be circulated aruomr members of the Legislature and the Finance Department will arrange to make them available to any member who desires to have them. For the sake of convenience, the Auditor General has already arranged to have all the civil expenditure , excluding railways, posts and telegraphs and military expenditure) of the Central Government dealt with in one appropriation report. He has been asked to make a similar arrangement as regards the audit irregu larities. At present the various Provincial Accountants General (of whom there are 8) deal with a certain number of Central heads of expenditure ; and each of them compPes separate reports with regard to the expenditure brought to account by him. In addition to these are the reports compiled by the Ac countant General, Central Revenues, who deals entirely with central expendi ture, the major portion of which is accounted for by him. It is felt that it would be much more convenient if the last named officer consolidated all the reports into one. 12. Paragraph 25 of the Report. —The Governor General in Council accepts this recommendation and desires that, all authorities who are competent to sanction revisions of pay should bear in mind that retrospective effect should not be given except in special circumstances 13. Paragraph 27 of the Report .— 'Khz Government agrees with the opinion expressed by Ihe Committee. 14. Paragraph 28 of the Report. —The Government of India have since examined the figures and are satisfied that the excesses noticed are due almost entirely to the difficulties pointed out in paragraphs 11 to 13 of the Report. The modified procedure accepted in paragraph 7 of this Resolution will have the effect of minimising similar exce'ses in future 15. Paragraph 29 of the Report.—Ihe suggestion is accepted. The Home Department vull in future watch the expenditure. 16. Paragraph 30 of the Report. —The Governor General in Council is of opinion that expenditure only on Committees appointed by the Assembly and reporting to it should be charged against the vote for the Assembly. The Auditor General will be asked, if he has no objection, to record under another head the expenditure on Committees appointed oiherwise whatever their compo sition and whether they are appointed by Government on their own initiative or at the initiative of the legislature. 17. Paragraph 31 of the Report. —The attention of the Chief Com missioner, Delhi, is drawn to the remarks of the Committee in this paragraph. 18. Paragraph 32 of the Report- —The Auditor General will be asked to instruct all accounts officers to inform the administiative heads of the depart ment who are responsible for watching the expenditure of any adjustment made or likely to be made in the accounts as soon as the information is avail able. 19. Paragraph 33 of the Report. —The Auditor General has since examined the question of the classification of ‘Miscellaneous’ expenditure and has issued necessary instructions to accounts officers. 20. Paragraph 31 of the Report. —The Auditor General has already instructed the Accountant General, Central Revenues, to show the information required in his appropriation report.5 % 21. The Director General, Posts and . Telegraphs, should consider the remarks in paragraphs 35-36 of the report and the minutes of the 7th meeting of the Committee. 22. The attention of the Railway Board and the Financial Commissioner, Railways, is directed to the points raised in paragraphs 37—10 and the minutes of the 5th and 7th meetings. 23. As regards the other matters referred to in the proceedings of the Committee, the Governor General in Council is in general agreement with their views. He desires particularly to draw the attention of administrative departments to two recommendations, viz., the necessity of previous consult ation with the Finance Department before any commitment involving a financial liability is made, and the desirability of informing audit officers of the exact nature of the disciplinary action taken by administrative authorities in the case of irregularities discovered by audit. The responsibility for discipli nary action will rest with the administrative authorities and ultimately with the Government of India, but the Audit department is entitled to information as regards the actual action taken. He has also directed that no delay should occur in communicating to the spending departments the grants sanctioned by the Assembly. 21. The question raised by the Auditor General about the fixation of the initial pay of accountants in the Military Accounts Department, which was discussed by the Committee in their meeting on 21st March 1923, has been carefully considered by the Government who feel that in the circumstances it is not possible to reduce the rates of pay already sanctioned except as part of a general reduction of salaries. They have however withdrawn certain con veyance allowances that had been sanctioned for certain accountants in addition to pay. Okdered that the Resolution be published in the Gazette of India. A. C.

Sir, I have the honour to state that agreeably to the instructions contained in paragraph 56 of the 'Notes and Instructions regarding th® Income Te.x Lav/ and v-^les' on pages 98-99 of the Income Tax Manual, each time a salary bill is prepared, it is accessary to ascertain what an officer's total income up to date is, and at what rate the tax has been deducted and to consider what his t^tal income from salary is likely to amount to by the end of the year and what is the rate of tax appropriate to such total income. ’Then an efficer is transferred, the total salary drawn up to date and the total amount of income tax deducted should be noted in his Last Pay Certificate. When an cfficer reverts from a higher rat* of salary to a lower rate, §r where, for example, on account of the absence of tin officer on leave in England, the rate of tax applicable to the total salary likely to be drawn by him in ^India during the whole Income Tax year is lower than what would have been the case if he had drawn his salary in India throughout the year, the tax must be deducted at the rate appropriate to the probable total annual income, having regard to the total drawn up to date and the rate at which salary is likely to be drawn for the rest of the year. Anyexcess deduction in previous months due to the fall in rate should also be adjusted in the first pay bill in which tax is deducted at the lower rate. Similarly if an officer is promoted to &amp; higher salary and the result is that the rate appro priate tc his probable total income is increased, not only should tax at the higher rate be deducted in subsequent pay bills, tut any deficiency in previous deductions due to the rise in rate should also be made good in the first pay bill drawn after his promotion.

No. F.-868—22. —The following reprint of the rules relating to premature retirement on propor tionate pension, which were made on the 15th January 1924, by the Secretary of State in Council, in virtue of the powers conferred on him by Section 96-B (2) and (3) of the Govern ment of India Act, in which certain verbal in accuracies contained in the version of the rules published in the Gazette of India, dated the 19th January 1924, have been corrected, is published for general information. 2.

Apart from amplifications and clarifications, the only changes of substance made in those orders are the following : — (i) It has been made clear that the rules apply to members of the services specified. how r ever and wherever they were appointed, but that previous service in a provincial or subordinate service cannot be counted for propor tionate pension by officers promoted from such a service to an all-India service. (Second Schedule, para graph 1). Passage-gratuity is made admissible officers who retired as the result of an application submitted while thev were on leave out of India, if their leave commenced before the date of the issue of these rules. After that date passage-gratuity will—as was originally intended—be admissible only to an officer whose application is submitted while he is on duty in India. (Pule 3 (2).) (iii) Provision has been made for the refund by instalments of passage-gratuitv paid to officers who are subsequently permitted to return to dutv. (Ruls 11 ( 8 ).) (iv) Conditions have been prescribed under which acceptance of further employ ment under the Crown may involva suspension or reduction of propor tionate pension. (Rule 9.)

The Local Government may further, at its discretion, require a second medical opinion or direct the applicant to appear before a Medical Board. (b) The certifying Surgeon or Board shall subject the applicant to a strict medical examination, requiring him to give such information as to his health and hab ts as is usual in the case of persons proposing to assure their lives in assurance companies, and shall report in the following form: — — have carefully examined and UL of opinion that he W Q J ai e - i8 - i n good bodily health and the prospect of an average d uration of life, is not • J i iaa ■ ^.-therefore, ~ recommend compliance with his application to be allowed to capitalise a portion of his pension.

The lump sum payable on commutation shall be the amount certified by the Audit Officer to be admissible according to the table of present values appended to this Schedule.

Simla, the 31st May, 1924. RESOLUTION. The Government of India have had under their consideration the question of the grant of advances to Government servants for house building and for the purchase of motor cars, motor boats, motor cycles and other conveyances the grant of which is regulated by the rules laid down in articles 155 and 156-8 of the Civil Account Code, Volume I. 2 . The practice of making these advances is one of long standing, and the Govern ment of India have no present intention of abolishing this concession. Under the existing orders, however, no interest is charged on such advances. Recent experi ence has shown that advantage is being taken of the concession to an extent which was never contemplated when the system was introduced, and the burden imposed on the public revenues in the shape of loss of interest amounts to a large sum of money every year. Moreover, in certain instances which have come to the notice of Govern ment the system of free advances is proved to have encouraged extravagance and run ning into debt. The Government of India therefore have come to the conclusion that it is desirable that a moderate rate of interest should be charged on such advances. • 3. Local Governments have been con sulted and after a consideration of their views the Government of India have decided that advances of the kinds described in paragraph 1 of this Resolution which may oe granted on or after the 1st July 1924 will be repayable with interest at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum. No interest will be charged on advances previously made.

R. Rau, Esquire, M.A., Under Secretary to the Government of India, T • * All Local Governments (including Minor Local Governments;. Subject Procedure relating to the payment of pension. I am directed to say that the attention of the Government of India nas been drawn t r the desirability of improving the procedure relative to the payment of pension in view of a case which recently happened of payment to a wrong person on account of mistaken identity. 2. It appears that .in applications for pension, proper names are frequently written illegibly and consequently there is a possibility of mistakes occurring m payment, and it has been suggested that to prevent such mistakes the details recorded against items 1,2,3,4 and 14 of Form No. 25, Civil Service Regulations, items 1 and 11 of Form No. 26, and items 1,4,8, and 14 of Form No. 22 should be enterea in bi^cK capital'* by heads of offices cr otherefficers concerned. The Government of India have accepted the suggestion and I am to request that , with the permission of nxc Excellency the Governor in Council, necessary instruction*! may be issued-on the subject. 3. The procedure indicated in Article 3^8 of Civil Account Code, Volume II, is alse susceptible of improvement. According to the existing procedure v/hen a pensioner presents himself to draw hio pension for the first time, the Treasury Officer takes hbs signature cn the Collector's half of the Pension Payment Order. As regains^ literate pensioners, it seems unsafe to depend entirely upon personal marks as th^s^ are often scanty and somev/hat indeterminate. A fraudulent pensioner having pa^o-u muster on the first occasion will have no further trouble, since his signature on the receipts will ever after be compared with the signature he gave on his lirst appearance As the existing procedure is defective, the Government of India have decided that a.n future, when completing the pension application Forms, the Head of tne office should take two spare copies of the applicant’s signature. These should be sent teethe Accountant General concerned, who would retain one copy in his office and pas^e „he tether copy on the disbursing officer’s half -i the Pension Payment Order. Treasury Officer will then be in a position to compare the pensioner's signature, &lt;n his first appearance, with a signature known to be genuine.

Delhi, the 1st January I925 m Sir, • In continuation of this office circular letter No. Bk.-1314, dated 2nd February 1924., I have the honour to state that in addition to the two classes of advances which have been already declared in the above letter to be “ Inevitable advances”— viz., “ Advances to officers on transfer ” and “ Advances for Law charges in connection with Privy Council Appeals ”, it has been decided that the following classes of advances should also be treated as falling under the same category of “ Inevitable advances ”, and in these cases also a certificate of the existence of funds need not be obtained before they are sanctioned. This office will review the actuals as soon as the accounts of a month are completed and obtain additional grants from the Controller of the Currency, if there is any likelihood of the grant being exceeded. I. Advances to public officers in the Civil Department [Article 159 (b), C. A. Code, Volume I]. (i) on arrival in India on first appointment. (ii) on return from («) leave other than leave on average pay not exceeding 1 months, (5) deputation out of India. u % fr V TI. Advances to a Survey Officer for joining his first appointment. [Arti cle 159 (c), C. A. C., Volume I]. III. Advances to receivers of wrecks [Article 159 (/’), C. A. Code, Volume I]. IV. Advances to patients proceeding to a Pasteur Institute [Article 159 [h\ C. A. Code, Volume I] or on returning therefrom (granted by the Director of the Institute). V. Advances to officers and men on the move of the headquarters of a Government. VI. Advances to the Administrator General for charges on account of management of estates (Section II of the Administrator General’s Act III of 1913). VII. Advances drawn for meeting deficiencies in remittances [Articles 136 (a) and 138 (a), Resource Manual].2 VIII. Advances to land acquisition officers for payment of compensation for land (Rule 14 App. C. A. Code, Volume I). 2. It has also been decided that in addition to those mentioned in para graph -1 of this office letter quoted above, the certificate procedure need not be applied to the following classes of cases, as they are mere accounts adjustment and they may, therefore, he omitted from future Demands for grants :— (1) Pension advances. (2) Revenue Survey advances. (3) Opium advances in the United Provinces. (4) Advances for the purchase of quinine in the United Provinces and Central Provinces. (5) Advances for stock (purchase) of Ganja in Central Provinces and Coorg. (6) Advances for rasad arrangements of His Excellency the Governor in the Central Provinces. (7) Remittance transactions, treated as 0. B. advances ; for want of information as to whether they are local or foreign. (8) Advances for the Hyderabad Railway Police. 3. Besides the heads referred to above, there is a large number of heads in each province which will continue to be treated as optional advances. In this '' office letter quoted above, they have been divided into two groups : — (i) Grants which should be distributed among disbursing officers, who may sanction advances up to that limit, without further reference to the Audit Officer (Paragraph 2—I. of the circular letter quoted above), and (ii) Grants which are not distributed and information regarding the , existence of funds must be obtained before an advance can be sanctioned (Paragraph 2—III. of ibid.) Instances^ items falling under each group have been shown in this office letter quoted above. Account officers have been vested with discretionary powers in the matter of treating a particular advance under either of these two groups. 4. It has further been decided that contingent charges in connection with Railway Police at Hyderabad, which are wholly recoverable from His Highness the Nizam’s Government should be adjusted directly under the Head “ Account with Indian States—Hyderabad.” 5. It will be seen that “ Revenue Survey Advances ” have now been transferred from Class I of “Advances Recoverable ” as shown in paragraph 2 —I. of this office letter quoted above to the class of advances to which the certi- ficate procedure is not applied, and paragraph 3 of this office letter No. Bk.- / 1314, dated 2nd Pebruary 1924, should be regarded as modified accordingly.

It has been represented to the Government of India that the existing practice of keeping the accounts of the year open for a considerable period after the actual close of the year causes sometimes an excess over the grants sanctioned by the Legislature under any particular demand and that the Controlling Officer is powerless to prevent an excess caused by such adjust ments because he knows of it too late to take steps to obtain another grant m time The Government of India recognise the difficulties of the system, for while it is desirable, as far as possible, to ensure that expenditure .s generally booked in the accounts of the year to which it relates it is important to provide for ample machinery for paying attention to the rights of appro priation of the Assembly and* the Provincial Legislative Councils. After careful consideration and consultation with the Auditor General, they have come to the conclusion that the adoption of the principles enunciated below will serve to mitigate considerably the inconveniences of the present system. 2. The Government of India wish to emphasise the fact that the accounts are kept open beyond the 1st of March for the definite purpose that as far as possible all the transactions of the year may be entered in the accounts of the year, but it is not essential that transactions relating to earlier years should be booked in the accounts of the latest year which are still open. If it is impossible to have any expenditure booked in the accounts of the year to which it relates, owing to the fact that the actual incidence of the expendi- ture is under dispute, it ought to be charged to the accounts of the year m which the final decision is taken, though at the same time, all possible efforts should be made to expedite the decision as far as possible. On the other hand, adjustments should not be made in the accounts of the past year if the disbursements could not have been reasonably anticipated in time for a grant being obtained from the proper authorities, namely, in the case of voted expenditure, the Legislative Assembly and the Provincial Councils, as the case may be. This implies that when demands (original or supple mentary) for appropriation of the necessary amounts for the expenditure are being placed before the Legislature suitable provision should always be made for anticipated liabilities, and the provision that adjustment should not be made in the previous year’s expenditure in certain circumstances should not be used as a cloak to conceal the results of defective budgeting. The onus of proving that the disbursements could not have reasonably been anticipated should lie on the controlling officer. In all cases where the ex penditure could have reasonably been anticipated as for example, recurring payments from one Government or Department to another and payments which, though not of fixed amount, are of a fixed character, etc., the Accounts Officer will automatically make the adjustment in the accounts before they are finally closed. A. C. McWATTERS, Secretary to the Government of India,Ordered that copies be forwarded to Provincial Governments and Minor Administrations; to the High Commissioner for India; to the several Departments of the Government of India; to the Financial Adviser, Military Finance; to the Financial Adviser, Posts and Telegraphs; to the Central Board of Revenue; to the Private Secretary to His Excellency the Viceroy; to the Military Secretary to His Excellency the Viceroy; to the Auditor General; to all Accountants General; to the Comptroller, Assam; to all Chief Auditors of State Railways; to the Heads of Departments sub ordinate to the Finance Department; to the Deputy Controllers of the Currency, Calcutta, Bombay and Delhi; and to the Audit Officer, Indian Stores Department.

MACLEOD, Esq., I C.S., Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, All PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS and MINOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. Subject: —Applicability of Fundamental Ride 45 to a Government servant leave. on A case has been brought to the notice of the Government of India, in which an officer provided with a Government; residence who was paying a provisional rate of rent sublet the residence during leave on that rate. During his absence the standard rent of the building was fixed at a figure which was higher than both the provisional rate of rent and 10 per cent, of the emoluments of the officer. The question which then arose was whether the officer in question should not be made to pay the full standard rent limited to 10 per cent, of his emoluments, as it is nowhere definitely laid down that Fundamental Rule 45 is applicable to Government servants on leave. The Governor General in Council has decided under Fundamental Rule 8 that Fundamental Rule 45 applies to Government servants on leave and that in such cases the officers on leave are liable for the full assessed rent subject to the 10 per cent limit.

Sir, I have the honour to state that it has been decided by the Government of India, Central Board of Revenue, that rewards for passing language examin ations are not taxable at all unless by the conditions of his employment the assessee is compelled to pass the examination. Where they are taxable, they are taxable as salaries and tax should he deducted at source. In regard to examiner’s fees, if the conduct of the examination is part of the assessee’s duties, the position is precisely the same as in regard to rewards for passing an examination. Even if it cannot be said that the assessee is under any obliga tion to do the work for which the fees are paid, the fees will be liable to tax if the w r ork done can be regarded as incidental to the exercise of the assessee’s profession, occupation or vocation, but in the latter case, they should he taxed as “ Income from other sources ”, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, H.

Sir, I have the honour to state that it has been decided by the Government of India that for purposes of Appropriation audit in the Account offices as well as in the offices of the Departme tal Controlling officers who have to watch the progress of expenditure against sanctioned grants, it is desirable that drawing officers should record the correct head of classification on each bill drawn by them and that controlling officers should intimate the proper classification of expenditure to drawing officers under them. This decision will take effect from the 1st April 1925. 2. I would request that the above decision may accordingly be given effect to in respect of all bills presented for encashment on or after the 1st \pril 1925. To Heads of De« partmenta only. 3. In recording the heads of classification, it is desirable that not only the major and minor heads but also each primary and secondary unit of appropria tion as shown in the budget estimates of the year to which the charges relate should he given in ihe bills and when a bill contains charges appertaining to various units under the same or different Article 13 (e). Civil Account Code, Volume I] major and minor heads, the amount chargeable to each unit should be distinctly shown in red ink. [As the appropriation audit now forms a very important item of work both in the Account offices as well as in the offices of the departmental control ling officers who have to watch the progress of expenditure against sanctioned grants, I would request that the importance of recording the correct heads of classification may be impressed upon all disbursing officers under your control.] I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, M.

Classification of receipts, etc. Delhi, the 18th December 1924. RESOLUTION. The Auditor General has suggested to the Government of India that for purposes of appropriation audit in the Account offices as well as in the offices of the departmental controlling officers who have to watch the progress of expenditure against sanctioned grants, it is desirable that the officer drawing each bill should record the correct head of classification on the bill itself. The responsibility for the correct classification of charges rests finally with the audit office, but the Auditor General is of opinion that chances of mistakes would be mb imised if the proper heads of account were pro minently shown on bills by tiie drawing officers and the audit office was left merely to check these classifications. 2. The Government of India have decided to give effect to this suggestion -with effect from the 1st April 1925 All controlling officers should intimate the proper classification of expenditure to drawing officers under them and instruct them to record the c'assification on bills presented by them for encashment. 3 . In the standard bill forms now under preparation space has been left for showing the classification. In the case of forms vhich are not standardised, a similar arrangement should be made when the existing stocks of the forms in question are exhausted and a new stock is being printed. (Sd.) A. C.

In so far as the officer using the car is himsfelf held responsible for damage etc. It is of course open to him to protect himself by insurance, but this must be done at his own expense and not at the expense of the State. 2 .

The Secretary of State has directed that these observations should be brought to the notice of local Governments for their information and guidance. 2. His Lordship has pointed out—a fact which is, he observes, perhaps insufficiently recognised—that in the absence of a specific provision enabling him to vary or depart from the terms of the Fundamental Rules, it is not, in view of their statutory character, within his competence to relax their provi sions in favour of individuals. In the circumstances, His Lordship considers that the only means available for giving effect to such a proposal would be to make an amendment in the relevant rule of such a character as to cover all cases, a course the serious objections to which are patent.

In view of the very material rise in the cost of passages, the Government of India- sanctioned the. introduction, in 1922, of a system for granting advances to Government servants of non-Asiatic domicile to*enable them to purchase passages for themselves and their families. The scheme is outlined in the annexure to Finance Department Resolution No. 88-A., dated the 29th January .1923. The introduction, however, of the passage pay scheme, prescribed in rule 12 of the Superior Civil Services (Revision of Pay and Pension) Rules, 1924, asr a result of the recommendatious of the Lee Commission, necessitates a change in the above scheme. The Government of India accordingly sanction the adop tion of the modified scheme set forth in the annexure. 2. The form of the Agreenfent to be furnished by officers coming under the Passage Pay Regulations and receiving an advance under this scheme will be prescribed in due course. No. 3379-A. Obdered that the Resolution be forwarded to Provincial Governments and Minor Administrations, to the several Departments of the Government of India ; to the Financial Adviser, Military Finance ; to the Financial Adviser, Posts and Telegraphs ; to the Central Board of Revenue ; to the Military and Private Secretaries to His Excellency the Viceroy ; to the Auditor General ; to the Heads of Departments subordinate to the Finance Department ; to the Deputy Controllers of the Currency, Calf*utta, Bombay and Delhi. Ordered also that the Resolution be forwarded to the High Commissioner for India. P. R. RAU, Under Secretary to the Government of India. #* • * * \ . L2FinD—2,385—11-4-25—GIPS(W* r\ ANNEXURE. Rules regulating the grant of advances to pay for the passages overseas of certain Government servants of non-Asiatic domicile and their families. 1 . In these rules “ family ” means a Government servant’s wife, letritimate children and step children residing with and wholly dependent upon him. 2 These rules apply only to gazetted Government servants of non-Asiatic domicile holding substantively a permanent post in any of the Civil Departments or m the Military Accounts Department ; and to Military Commissioned officers (including Military Assistant Surgeons with commissioned rank) of non-Asiatic domicile in civil employ. Provided that, in the case of officers who are entitled to passage pay under Rule 12 of the Superior Civil Services (Revision of Pay and Pension/ Rules, 1924, an advance will be admissible only when they have exhausted their benefits under the Passage Pay Regulations. Advances in these cases, if sanctioned after 31st March 1925, will bear interest at 5 per cent, per annum. 3. An advance may be made to a Government servant for the cost of passage by*sea from a port in India .to a port outside Asia of himself and members of his family and also for the cost of the return voyage. The advance for members of the family will be admissible even though they do not accompany the Govern-' ment % servrmt on the voyage. 4. The amount of each advance shall not exceed four months’ pay of the Governmeni servant or Rs. 6,000, whichever is less, subject to the further con dition that it shall not exceed the amount actually required at the time for the purpose for which it is granted. It should be a sum expressed in whole rupees, being a multiple of thirty-six. 5. When an advance has previously been sanctioned, the amount of a further advance should be so regulated that the total amount outstanding will not exceed the limits mentioned in Rule 4. For the purpose of recoveries, each advance shall be treated separately. 6. The sanctioning authority will be the Department of the Government of India, or other subordinate authority to whom the power may be delegated with the consent of th'fe Finance Department, or the local Government under whose administrative control the Government servant is serving. 7. An advance will not be admissible to a Government servant who does not intend returning to civil duty on the expiry of the leave, and the Govern ment servant shall submit with his application for the advance a certificate that he intends to return to civil duty on the expiry of the leave. The applicant should at the same time state whether he has taken, or intend^ applying for, an advance for the same purpose under the rules regulating the General Provi dent Fund or any other similar providefit fund rules. 8. {a) Advances will be recovered in thirty-six equal monthly instalments by compulsory deductions from pay, commencing from' the first payment of a full month’s pay after the advance is granted. Except as provided_in clause {h) of this rub\ no recovery .will be made from a Government servam while he is 071 leave. A borrower may, howeyer, make repayment in less than thirty-six instalments or may repay two or more instalments at the same time. (6)“If the Government servant retires, or applies for and receives permis- sion to let ire on the expiry of his leave, the outstanding balance of the advance will be recoverable at once, but where undue hardship is likely to result from eompellina payment in one instalment, a ^Department of the Government of India or the High Commissioner for India may permit a relaxation of this rule to the extent of allowing monthly recoveries to be made from the pension or leave salarv admissible to the Government servant at a rate not less than halt the monthly amount of such pension or leave salary. In applying this ru e consideration should be given to the amount which will be handed over to a provident fund subscriber on his retirement. ( C ) The borrower will submit to the audit officer concerned or, if the advance is paid in England to the High Commissioner for India, within three weeks of the receipt of the advance, receipts showing the amount of P^^^from passages. Where, however, the monev for passages dias to be remitted t India to England (or vice versa), the time for submission may e extwo months. In the event of failure to comply with this rule, the amount advanced shall be recoverable at once. If the receipts produced are for an amount less than that advanced, the balance shall be recoverable at once'. 9. Subject to the conditions of these rules, the Commissioner may sanction an advance to a Government servant on leayp drawing his leave salary in London for the cost of return passages to India of the Government servant and his family, provided no advance for the same journey hds been previously made. 11 10.

Provident Fund withdrawing the whole amount standing to his credit in the I. C. S. Provident Fund under rule 15 (2) of the Fund Rules in order to take a single payment insurance policy payable in sterling in the United Kingdom may be allowed in the event of the policy maturing before his retire ment to pay into the sterling branch of the Fund the sum realised from the insurance company which is payable to the Fund under rule 15 (4). In reply, I am to say that there is no objection under the Rules to the sum realised from a policy expressed in sterling being paid into the sterling branch of the Fund. If the policy lapses, however, the amount of premia which falls due under the same rule with interest thereon, should be repaid into the rupee branch, as the amount was withdrawn in rupees from that branch. 2. As regards your enquiry whether policies premia towards which are paid from contributions to the I. C. S.

In reply to your letter No. 183-W.M.V.-10, dated the 19th June 1925, I am directed to say that the intention was that the 10 per cent, limit mentioned in the last sentence of Finance Department letter No. F.-259-C.S.R., dated the 3rd January 1925, should be interpreted as 10 per cent, of the emoluments last drawn by the officer. 2 . It has however been brought to the notice of the Government of India that such a ruling would not be in consonance with a literal reading of Funda mental Rule 45 which would necessitate the “ emoluments ” of an officer on leave being interpreted as his leave salary.

RESOLUTION. j No. F.|21-II-C.S.R.|24.— The Secretary of State in Council has been pleased to sanction the grant of the concessions mentioned below, to civil officers who rendered military service in the Great War :— (1) If a civil officer who served with the Forces during the Great War, and who was granted sick leave during that service (other than the 3 months’ absence on full pay allowed to officers wounded or invalided), has reason to think that the amount of civil leave earned by him in respect of his military service was less than the amount debited in his leave account in respect of the same service, his leave account will, on his making application, be examined and, if such should be found to be the case, the excess debit will be cancelled. (2) Sick leave taken by an officer during military service will count for pension up to a maximum of two years (as in the case of special disability leave) irrespective of whe ther he was eventually invalided from military service or not. If he was invalided from military service, any such period of sick leave allowed to count for pension should be deducted from any period of disability leave that might otherwise be admissible to him on his release from military service. 2. Pensioners who retired before the date of this Resolution, who have reason to think that their pension will be increased by the concession now sanctioned, should make an application for re-calculation of their pensions to the authority which sanctioned their pension. Any increase of pension which may be admissible as a result of the concession will have effect from the 5th July 1925. Ordered that the Resolution be published in the Gazette of India (Part I). A. C.

The Government of India have reason to believe that the intention under lying clause (4) (c) of rule 20 of the General Provident Fund Rules is not correctly understood. Several instances have been brought to their notice in which the first instalment towards the repayment of an advance granted from the Fund has actually been recovered from the subscriber’s pay for the following month. The rule requires that the pay from which the first instalment is recovered should represent a full month’s pay and not that a full month should elapse between the date on which the advance is granted and the date on which the 1st instalment should be recovered. Even though the pay bill for the month in which the advance is made may have been sent to the treasury, it ought not to be impossible to intimate the necessity for the recovery of the first instalment therefrom to the Treasury Officer before payment is actually received. If for any reason, the recovery is not effected in time, the 1st and 2nd instalments should be recovered together from the subscriber’s pay for the following month. (Sd.) A. C.

In cases in which an officer who does not return to duty actually uses the return ticket or tickets for the journey back to India the cost of the same will be re covered from him unless the Governor General in Council is satisfied that the officer was pre vented, by circumstances, beyond his control, from returning to duty. There may be cases in which the High Com- m's loner arranges return passages for° officers returning to India for a short spell of duty prior retirement. If in any such case the return half of the ticket or tickets is not utilised, it should be returned to the Audit Officer con cerned in India. If the officer does not actually •i oln duty, the entire cost of the return passage, or the cost of the journev to India only, accord ing as the return half of the ticket or tickets is or is not used, will be recovered from him. When an officer takes return passages for himself and his wife children and returns to duty in India leaving his wife ni ' (1 children at home or when an officer ■while on duty in India sends his wife children out of Asia on return tickets of which the second halves are not utilised, he should return the unused half of the return ticket or tickets to the Audit Officer concerned in India. If, however, the second halves of the return tickets are actually utilised, the officer should make a declaration m due course to the Audit Officer that the tickets have actually been utilised. No refund will be made by a Steamship Com pany under this rule except to the Audit Officer, who w r ill make the necessary adjustment of the amount between the officer and the Government if the cost of the passage involved or any por tion thereof has been borne by the officer.
