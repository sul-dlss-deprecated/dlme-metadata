KCOODS I have the honour to forward for the orders of the Hon'ble the Political Resident, a translation of a letter dated 50th Rabi al Hiani, 1546, addressed by His Majesty the King of Hejaz and ITejd to my prede- protesting cessor/against Captain Alban's action in asking the Amir of Qatif to send Kejdis to Balirain to answer a claim against them in the Bahrain Courts. 2. His Majesty refers to two cases. In the first case Kaji Abdul Nabi Bushiri, a Persian, sued Mahomed bin Abdulla bin Tuwaim of Qatif for R! 872/8/-. On 15th Rabi al Awal = 12th September, 1927, Captain Alban asked the Amir of Qatif to send the defendant to Bahrain to appear before the Court. In a letter dated 14th Rabi al Awarp but which must have been written later, the Amir replied that the defendant admitted an account with Haji Abdul Ifabi but denied that the total claimed was correct. The Amir said that the defendant was ready to have his case settled by the Shara Court in Qatif, and askedasked that Abdul Habi should appear ti ©re either in person or by agent. In the second case a Qatifi named Ahmad bin Haji Mudan had been sued in the Agency Court by Haji Abdul !Tabi Bushiri for a sum of 1020/-. He duly appeared before the Court and the case was referred to arbitration in March 1927, &amp; compromise was reached whereby Ahmad Ha j i Mudan agreed to pay the plaintiff 700/- plus court fees. Hie arbitrators permitted the defendant to pay his debt by four instalments within a period of four months. He left for Qatif without paying his debt. On 27th June, as the defendant had paid no instalments Captain Alban asked the Amir of Qatif to recover the money from him. On 5th Muharram = 5th July, the Amir of Qatif replied saying that he had summoned the defendant and he had promised to go to Bahrain. The defendant actually came to Bahrain and promised to produce a surety for his debt but- absconded without doing so. On 12th Huharram = 12th July Captain Alban informed the Amir and asked him to recover the whole debt of It! 778/- and also to punish the defendant for absconding. On 28th Habi al Awal the Amir Mohammad Abdul Rahira as Suwailim sent a reply to Captain Alban to say that the defendant Ahmad bin al Haj Mudan had appeared before him and was ready to have his case tried before the Shara Court in Qatif. The Amir accordingly asked that Abdul Kabi Bushiri should either appear before him in person or send an agent. !5. Captain Alban's action in these two cases isis in accordance with tlie practice of the Bahrain Political Agency for several years past. I have looked up the records, and find the following precedents:- (a).Case Mo. 844/523 of 1924. Ibrahimji Ghulam Hussain, Indian of -Manama vs Mimad Hassan, Fejdi of O.atif. Hie Political Agent asked the Amir of Qatif to send the defendant to Bahrain. Hie Amir 0 f Qatif replied that the man was sick but would appoint an agent. Hie case was settled by the agent on behalf oft. defendant. (b ). Case ITo. 491/935 of 1924. Mohamad Amin bin Mohamad Sharif, Persian of Manama vs Mohamad Amin Zainal Amadeh Persian of Damam under Qatif. On demand of the Political Agent, Abdur Raliman bin Suwailim^Amir of Qatif sent the defendant to Bahrain to contest the suit. (c ).Case Ho. 438/1960 of 1924 Shahbuz bin Dorab Persian of Manama vs Saud bin Ibrahim Saihati, a iTejd subject. In this case the Bahrain Qadhi found the defendant guilty of theft and ordered him to -return T* 140/- to the plaintiff. Defendant fled to Qatif. On demand by the Political Agent, the Amir of Qatif recovered the money from defendant's kinsfolk as, he said, the defendant himself had no' property and was insane. \ (d).CaEe ITo. .191/309 of 1925. Hashid AbViur Raliman IQian, Persian of Moharraq under Balirain vs'' Ali Ahmad Badi, a Ifejd subject of Jubail. Abdul la bin Jilawi, Amir of Hasa sent the defendant to Bahrain to contest the claim for &gt;! 1156/12/- (e).Case ITo. 425/659 of 1926, Mohamad Tayab Kfiunji, Persian of Manama vs Abdul Latif bin Ibrahim, Persian of Damara under O.atif. On being asked by the Political Agent, the Amir of Qatif sent the defendantdefendant to Bahrain to defend a claim of B! 4972/4/- brouglit against him. (f ).Ca6e Ho. 389/1*551 of 1926, Mohamad Rafi agent of Yusuf Lutfally IQiunji, Persian of '.ianaraa vs Haji Zusa bin Ali, a Balirain subject. On being requested by the Political Agent, Shaikh Abdulla bin Jilari, Amir of Hasa sent the defendant to Bahrain for the hearing of the case against him. Tliere another cases, but those quoted will suffice to show that whatever the regulations observed between nations may be the local aistom has been for the Ifejd Amirs to send defendants to Bahrain to defend suits brought against them. Shey have also on occasion executed a decree an#remitted the decreed amount to Bahrain for payment to a plaintiff. To revert to His Majesty Abdul Aziz bin Baud's letter, the case of Ahmad bin Haj MUdan was parti cularly bad as this case had been decreed against the man after he had agreed to arbitration. Hie man promised to give security for the payment and then absconded without doing so. 4. Business relations between Bahrain and the neighbouring mainland territories, Qatif, Jubai1 jo—^ Hasa are very close, as Manama on the Bahrain Islands is the steamer port for these provinces. there a/ro It naturally follows that/numerous commercial suits of which the cause of action arise in Bahrain. Jt lias hitherto been customary for the these Political Agent to settle/either sitting alone or as a Joint Court with the Ruler-of Bahrain. Hie neigbhouring Rulers and their officials have hitherto acquiesced in this procedure. 5. The signature of the Treaty of Jeddah appear^ 'however to have induced His Majesty the King of Hejaz and Ifejd to Insist on matters 'being settled in /I 1 i, in aocordance with international custom^in the country in which the de fend ant arises. So long as honest Amirs and Oadhis are appointed at at Qatif, Jubail ai d/lias a I do not think that objection can be raised to this procedure even though it is a departure from the custom hitherto followed, but I submit the question for orders. 6. Direct correspondence has always been carried on between the Political Agent and the Ifejdian Amirs on would routine matters and it/certainly be a hardship to merchants if for any reason objection be raised hereafter on the ground that this also not in accordance with the practice between independent nations. To regularise the position I venture respectfully to suggest, that the proposal which was being considered as far as back as 1912^before the Turks lost the ^ country to the Wahabis^that the Political Agent, y/qoH Bahrain, should be aoDointed Vice Consul for Hasa ^ and Qatif should be revived but that his status should be that of Consul. I make this suggestion both on the ground that it will give the Political Agent a better standing vis-a-vis the Amirs and that It will recognise his position as an officer of equal status with the Political Agent and His Majesty's Consul at Muscat. Hitherto the Wahabi Amirs have conducted business in the same manner as the petty Shaikhs of the Gulf littoral. The Treaty of Jeddah appears however to have altered their outlook, and has led the King of Nejd to claim affairs should be carried on according to the regulations observed between independent nations. I have the honour to be.

From Major C.C.J.Barrett, G.S.I.,0.1.E., Political iigent, Baiirein, To Tlie Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, sir . I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your endorsement No.234-S dated the 5th June 1928. I have never had an opportunity of meeting H.M.AMul Aziz Mn Saud so it is difficult to give an accurate forecast on the question of a possible counter claim by him for a Hejdi Consul at Bahrein. Judging from the trend of his policy however I do consider that a counter clp.im of the sort mentioned by the Government of India, is a 0 danger which has to he considered, 2, You may remember that last year Bin Saud made a veiled attempt to establish a Consul at Kuwait and at Zubair^empowered to visa passports. I left Kuwait while the correspondence on the subject, was still continuing so I am unaware of the conclusion reached. The attitude of Bin Saud in re Kuwait represen tation would, I think, be a guide to his procedure re Bahrein but in my opinion the best way to discover it would be in an informal conversation between H.M.Consul at Jeddah and the King himself. 3 My object is to obtain the right of direct cor~ re .pondenoe with the ^tilrs of Qatif and Haaea on matters ofintei est &lt;-.l fee ting Bahrein, Q,atar and Q,atif .These woi-c usually he connected with pearling and the trade in rice, dates and grain, I should also like the right to vi&amp;it C, u atif cs.nd Ujair, and Hassa the latter only with the special permission of the ioair, in order to discuss mat ter-- alfecting -briuish subjects, such as the recent ex- pmision o^. uiie Hindus from Qatif, in order to pave the vv&lt;*,v uo a settlement of questions at a personal interview, belore they have time to become of major importance. It would be impossible for H.B.M, Consul at Jeddah, who has no knowledge of Gulf conditions, to deal with such matters direct with His Majesty, 4* A little friendly correspondence is actually passing between myself and the neighbouring Mejdian -mirs but if His Majesty bin Saud wishes to invoke internation al law, I suppose it would have to stop. It is of inter est that His Majesty himself recently wrote me a letter direct recommending one of the Bowasir headmen to my con sideration^ and his protest of last year against Captain Alban was addressed to the Political Agent # Bahrein, 5 , At one moment the Kingdom of Hej az and Ke j d ap pears a« a power claiming to be treated^for instance^like Turkey, the next it is a Bedouin Sheikhship, acting much as any other of the Gulf principalities would act. His Majesty^ protest of 30th Rabi ath Thani against Cap tain Alban's procedure to which I referred in ray Ho.595/ V.O. of 14th December 1927 shows that the Bedouin Sheikh is liable without notice to become the great king. It is for this reason that I recommend that the position of the Political Agent vis a vis the coastal .amirates of Ke^d should be regularised if possible, I think that the best way of attaining the object would be by appointing the incumbent of the Political Agency to be Consul for qatif and Hassa in addition. I do not recommend that these additionala additional duties should give the Political Agent any right to champion the cause of Bahreinis living in Saudian. territory, but I do recoianiend that he be eapowered to settle commercial disputes between merchants residing in Bahrein on the one part and those of Hassa and ( ; atif on the other in friendly cooperation with the iinirs of the districts for which he is appointed. 6, The number of actual British subjects in Hassa, Ujair and L-atif at the present moment is negligible, I am told that there are 2Bohras at ^.atif and 1 Punjabi at Hassa, but none other. There are a few Iraqis and Kuwai tis in Government employ at Jubail, ^atif and Hassa and many Iraqis living in the Hassa oasis, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Po li t i ca3'^igent, Bahr e in.11 til t 1 '? qOKFIDMTIAL .

The second dated 24th Rabi 1 al Auwal 1346 No, 461_ asking him (the Amir of Qatif) also 1927 to send you another of my subjects named Ahmad bin al Hajj Madan to settle a case lodged against him in the Bahrain Court for a debt due by him. I was greatly astonished at this demand of yours because the Defendants are my subjects, living in ray country and the calling of them to your jurisdiction which is outside their country is, as you know, not in common with the regulations observed between nations and it conflicts with the judicial administration and its authority in my country. I therefor hope that such demands should not be^repeatecL, apd that the hearing of cases may be in the country 'of the Defendants according to the regulations observed between independent nations.

The second query is not clear. The proposal jin your telegram No, 90 was that the Political Agent, pahrain, should 'be made British Consul for Qatif and OJair, ( This is presumably apart from the question of his being appointed Consul at Bahrain, like the officer at Muscat). As Consul for Qatif and OJair and vis a vis Ibn Saud he, like say, the Consul at Jeddah,^represent the interests of British and British protected subjects, which covers not only Bahrainis but also foreigners in Bahrain, whose interests are in his care, 3. The P,A. Bahrain has not visited Hasa in recent years. The last Political Agent who visited Hasa was I laJ or Dickson, who, in 1919 spent a month at Hofuf, a week at Qatif and visited OJair three times to meet Ibn aud, ( Subsequently, as an Iraq officer. Major Dickson | irisited OJair twice, accompanying Sir Percy Cox, the last occasion being in 1923. On that occasion Major Daly accompanied the party to J&amp;atoaxa OJair and spent i a night there). i I 'I.
