Us \(b) In connection with Kuweit,an interesting move may be proposed at some time in the future by the 'Iraq government.An outline of it was given by the Acting Collec-^ tor of Customs,Basrah. Disclaiming all responsi Dility, and (2$\ saying that he was thinking only of British interest in the maintenance of the blockade,he put forv/ardthe idea oi limit ing imports to Kuweit.He suggested that goods were imported there and consigned to Sa'udi Arabia;but that their real destination was Syria.Control,he suggested,would be simple, most of the large import operations in Kuweit are financed by Basrawis,working through 'Iraqi banks. The scheme is ingenious,and the excuse specious.ine idea of controlling Kuweit imports by financial regulations in 'Iran,is certainly novel.Suspicion is attached to it, however,by the fact that the very person who put forwarU the suggestion,Abdul Wahhab al Ha'amah.xs one of the most prominent 'Iraqi supporters of the ?°^ e ^ton that Kuweit i c -noft of 'Iraa.lt is possible that on the pretext ox axu ing' the British blockade of Syria, the * take the first step towards integrating financia of the two countries. ^ . , . , ^ v-nwoit The presence of a branch of a British bank would negative this scheme almost completely.

Bank are reluctant to negotiate for a mut. concession on the basis of these terms. if however they can be assured that (provided their conduct of business is satisfactory) opening of any other British or foreign bank during first five years of their establish ent would be discouraged by Shaikh and Government of India, they wo a propose instead to send to Kuwait suitable British member of their staff abroad with managerial experience and some knowledge of Arabic who would be supplied in due course with necessary nucleus of trained clerical staff4. Bank enquires whether action on these lines would be acceptable. If so, they wo ild instruct their Chief Manager at Tehran to communicate by telegram through Minister with you regarding arrangements. anxious not to commit themselves to anything so rigid as draft agreement /(and in particular to loan contemplated in clause , ; arid in the hope of avoiding this they are not asking for concession on the lines of clause 18. , I think it wo ild be reaoona le to give them assurance for which they ask in return for which they would probably accept most of remaining stimulations in draft agreement. 5.

Johnson, Manager of the Khorrainshahr 'branch of the Imperial Bank of Iran, on the 15th October, 1941, at 10 a.m. \ 1. Mr. Johnson informed the Shaikh that he had been instructed by the Directors of his Bank to come to Kuwait to examine the possibility of it being in the interests of the Bank to open a branch office. He desired to know V whether such a proposal would be acceptable to Kis Highness V. t The Shaikh welcomed the proposal and said he was agreeable to the suggestion on the terms that were already known to the Political Agent. Mr. Johnson said that he was aware of the conditions a&amp;d that with the exception of two clauses they were acceptable to his Directors. He regrettec that his Directors were unable to see their way to agreeing to the 6th clause which provided for the grant of a loan to His Highness, and said that they wished it made clear in clause 15 that they could withdraw at any time during the period of the contract if in their opinion it was to their advantage to do so. His Highness said he was prepared to agree to clause 6 being in abeyance during the war, but he desired it to come into force when the war was over and peace had again come. He declared that he was in no need of a loan now but no one knew what the future held. In regard to the alteration of clause 15 he had no objec tion but did not think that the Bank would wish to withdraw as he felt sure that there would be ample business for them 2. Mr. Johnson stated that he would inform his Directors of the course the interview had taken and hoped that it would be possible for them to accept His Highness* condition in regard to clause 6. 3. The Shaikh stated that he would arrange for Mr. Johnson to meet some of the leading merchants at the house/house of his Secretary, Abdulla Mulla, on Thursday the 16th. Mr. Johnson took leave of His Highness saying that he would coramunicate with him through the Political Agency and remarked that the early New Year would, he trusted, see the opening of the Kuwait Branch of the Imperial Bank of Iran.CONFIDENTIAL.

Major, Political \gent, Kuwait.^ ,.l, \\&gt; )jj± The Bank, which opened on 28th, February 1942, experienced at first a short period of inactivity. Quite a number of the larger merchants and sarrafs, however, soon opened current accounts and on the Bank f s halfyearly balance on 20th. March, twenty days after opening,51 ^ accounts were established. By 20th, September this number had increase^* to 95 and at date to about 150. The withdrawal of King Edward V11 rupees in the early part of 1942, which the Bank handled on behalf of the Political Agency provided the Bank with an opportunity for increased contacts with the public, and the Financial Department of the Kuwait Government first opened an accountin April 1942 by paying in 4 considerable sums of King Edward V11 rupees. As a result of discussions between the Political Agency and the Government a decree was issued in May 1942 making notes and coin readily interchangeable without charge. This provided a facility in money payments which benefited both the Bank and the public. Foreign exchange business, which in Kuwait principally consists of buying dinarb on Iraq, and selling rupees on India has developed satisfactorily. Owing to the wartime increase in the price of gold, quantities of sovereigns appear in the.Kuwait bazaar. These are sold jS in Iraq and thus provide in part the necessary cover for sales of rupe^i on India. In addition sales of goods to Iran also create^ a supply of rial notes in the market which are disposed of in Iraq. — v There is therefore a considerable exchange business,on the lines indicated above, passing through the Bank, but with restrictions in the export of goods fron» India it is not to be expected that transactions will continue on the same scale. In conclusion, the writer considers that the initial success of the opening of the Branch in Kuwait is due partly to what may be termed a wartime boom, arising from inflated prices, increased consumption in neighbouring countries, large expenditure by the Forces, etc. Before being able to arrive at a definite conclusion regarding prospect! in Kuwait, we must wait for more settled conditions after the war and we look forv/ard to future development when the Kuwait Oil Co. begins production on a large scale.

Weightman,Esquire, GIE.,IGS. ,Joint Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department , (reference Residency printed letter No.lll-S dated ./ 24th January 1942.) Major T. Hickinbotham, OBE, Political Agent, Kuwait*to f\S&gt; noted dated 26th February 1943 by Political AgenttKu-wait.* The negotiations which were initiated by you for the opening of a branch of a reliable bank in Kuwait were terminated on the 17th of December 1941 by the sign ing of a 'Banking Agreement' between the Shaikh and a representative of the Imperial Bank of Iran* 2* Mr* E.S* Matheson, who was appointed to open the new branch, arrived in Kuwait in the middle of Jan uary 1942 and immediately proceeded to negotiate for suitable premises* No suitable building being available in the business quarter of the Town the lease of six small store rooms was acquired with the assistance oi the Shaikhs Secretary and their inner walls were removed to form a banking chamber, strong room, entrance hall, and office for the Manager. The construction of bank furniture was undertaken by a local carpenter and his work was supplemented by purchases in Basra of special equipment. The Bank Manager and his wife were my guests until a suitable building could be made avail able for their temporary accommodation by the Kuwait Oil Company pending the completion of alterations in a house belonging to Shaikh Abdullah al Jabir which had been leased as their permanent dwelling* 3. On the 28th of February 1942 the Bank opened for business and from the first there was a steady desire on the part of the more substantial merchants to deposit money and open accountse On the 20th of March 1942 there were fiftyone accounts on the books of the Bank, six months later the 'Tnnmber had increased to ninety five and is now, so the Manager informs me, about one hundred and fifty. The largest depositor was at one time the Saudi Arabian Trade Agent who deposited Rupees thirteen lakhs of his Government’s money in the Bank. 4. As much assistance as possible has been given to the Bank by this Agency. In the early part of 1942 the Bank undertook, at the suggestion of the Agency,the withdrawal of King Edward VII rupees to give the populace an opportunity of increased contact with the Bank and to familiarise the ignorant of which there are tens of thousanas in Kuwait with the interior of a banking premises. As a result of pressure from the Agency the Financial Department of the Kuwait Government opened a deposit account in April 1942. In May 1942 the Bank, and the Army authorities who were at that time making large purchases in the town found themselves embarrassed by the demand for payments to be in silver coin as rupee notes of all denominations were at a considerable discount. As the Bank Manager pointed out that rupee coin was tiresome to handle, difficult to transport, and expensive to obtain from India, I discussed the question with the Shaikh and in May the Kuwait Government decreed that from then on- 2 notes would be interchangeable with coin without charge. Cooperation between the Kuwait Government, the Bank, and some of the more far-sighted merchants ensured that the Kuwait Government’s decree was implemented and in a very short time notes were readily accepted. In fact notes and cheques are now preferred to coin for all large pay ments. 5. The Bank is now established and many wonder how the business community managed without the facilities offered by a bank for so many years. Bills can be negotiated on the spot instead of over one hundred miles away in Basra, drafts on India can be purchased immediate ly on telegraphic advice from merchants agents in India, over-drafts on good security can be obtained at reason able rates of interests, and time and accounting can be saved by making use of the bank’s cheques for local business and personal payments. i' rom a political point of view the establish ment of what is in everything but name a British Bank is a major success. From a business point of view the more the local merchants deal with a British bank and through it with British business houses the more will our trade expand. From a propaganda point of view the value of the Bank is very great as an example of the fairness of British methods and as an example of British stability. 6. The Bank is doing abnormally well partly owing to the high prices now ruling and partly to a brisk foreign exchange business. However it is not to be expected that the favourable conditions will be maintained. There are dark days ahead for the Bank as well as for the rest of us but the Bank is now firmly rooted and will stand the financial storms and depressions with the happy prospect to look forward to of the reopening of the Kuwait Oil Company after the war and the prosperity which a large oil development always beings in its train. ---oooOooo^Ae ' Jrn/ie)(rr/ ? ^Jan/i op t jicm, (INCORPORATED IN ENGLAND) telegraphic address “ B ACTRI A ' -v' / ^ '.y?'//tva/,4 27th September (PEItSJAN GULF.) //U5.

As you will no doubt be aware, we have for a considerable number of years been established in Bagdad and in Basrah, with which towns Kuwait has many business connections, and it has been suggested to us on more than one occasion that we should assist the business community of Kuwait by opening a Branch there. We are, of course, aware that there is already a Bank established in the Principality, but feel convinced that there is sufficient business to justify our open- a Branch. We shall be very grateful for any advice or assistance you may be able to afford us, particularly as to the steps we should take to obtain permission to open such a Branch. This letter will be presented to you by our Manager at Basrah, Mr C. Kerr, who will be able to amplify its contents and give you any details you may wish to have. I am. Sir, Yours faithfully.

I have explained to Mr. Kerr that the Imperial// Ban* of Persia hold a monopoly of which there are yet some 35 years unexpired. Since the original mono JOly, which was for 15 years, banking business in Kuwait has grown out of all proportion and, since ohe extension of the monopoly, to an even greater extent still. 3. In these circumstances the demand for another banx to operate in competition is bound to come, and indeed it appears to have come. I propose/ therefore, to reply to the letter that until the merchants of Kuwait show sufficient interest, or ask for the opening of another bank little can be done in the matter. Before replying I should be grateful for confirmation. Yours sincpi^ly. H.E.Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE.,C3I., Political Resident, Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain.CON FI}); V TIAI PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY.^ BAHRAIN, 2Srd February, 1949. j (179/2/49) Please rerer to your demi-official letter No. C/20(4/11) of the 8th February about the desire of the Ottoman Bank to open a branch in Kuwait. 2. The Shaikh of Kuwait has given a written undertaking that no permission will be given by the Kuwait Government to any bank other than the Imperial Bank of Iran to open a branch in Kuwait for a period of 30 years from December, 1941. This monopoly was strongly criticised by Sir Evan Jenkins during his recent visit here, but it was presumably granted by the Shaikh with our concurrence^if not encouragement, and I do not think we can possibly suggest to him that he should go back on it. Unless, therefore, the Imperial Bank of Iran on their own account consent to the opening of a branch in Kuwait by the Ottoman Bank, which 1 presume is most unlikely, there appears to be nothing further to be said in the matter. I would suggest, therefore, if you see no objection, that you should reply to the Ottoman Bank's representative that the Imperial Bank of Iran hold a monopoly in Kuwait until the end of 1971 under which it is impossible for any other bank to open a branch there without their consent and that of the Shaikh.

The following is the circulated statement by the Rt. Hon. Lord Kennet, P.C., G.B.E., D.S.O., D.S.C. (the chairman): — In our accounts this year public deposits show a small decrease of £485,000. The decrease is a continuation of general post-war movements, well marked in Iran. Bills payable have increased £850,000, due to increased activity under several headings. Credits and guarantees are £1,400,000 more, an increase of more than 30 per cent. Most of that was due to more business in Iran and at Beirut. Balance-sheet Items The biggest change in our balance-sheet is an increase in our cash and money at call and short notice of £2,500,000 to £11,000,000 and a reduction in our investments by £3,000,000 to £4,800,000. These changes are connected^ 1 deal later with the new regulations for bank ing in Iran. These came into force on March 21, 1949, and although our financial year ended on March 20, it was necessary to strengthen our position in advance to prepare for the new procedure which requires us to transfer a larger proportion of our deposits to the Bank Melli Iran. The balance of £500,000 was required for financing foreign trade. Bills discounted, and advances, &amp;c., at £7,400,000 were £900,000 more than the year before. Most of this increase was in the busi ness of our branches in the Persian Gulf and the Lebanon. There is a new item this year on the assets side—Iraq Government Treasury Bills £350,000. These are three months’ Bills to help the needs of the Iraq Government for short-term loans. Our statutory deposits of £1,385,000 with the Bank Melli Iran are £350,000 less than the year before, corresponding to the reduc tion of our deposits in Iran which I have mentioned. _ ^ Our balance-sheet shows a very liquid posi tion. Our statutory deposits with the Bank Melli Iran under the new regulations, as under the old, provide for proportionate withdrawals as deposits decrease. The value of our bank premises stands in the balance-sheet unchanged at £1,000, accom- panied by a statement of their estimated value. Our profit of £105,411 compares with £100,349 last year, a small increase of £5,062. We have added £50,000 to our reserve account, raising it to £1,100,000. After pn viding for a final dividend of 6 per cent, we make a small addition of £5,911 to the carry forward. ‘ Trading Conditions Trading conditions in all our areas have been good. There are, however, signs of the pre vailing change to a buyers’ market, more . marked in some places than others. Thi* true of consumption goods in parti^ ,ar » °f which stocks are accumulating. Capital goods, such as machinery and factory equipment, are still a good market, but about these, too, the British exporter is feeling the pressure of his competitors, and is likely to feel it more in the future. For many goods British prices are comparatively high. It is where sterling is the only currency available, which is not always convertible to the currencies of cheaper sup pliers, that orders at such non-competitive rates are placed in the United Kingdom. It is not always appreciated by British ex porters that they reap a great advantage from the services of British banks trading overseas by way of information, advice, the safeguarding of their interests, the promotion of trade, and the introduction of foreign buyers to British markets. Our managers are on the alert thus to promote British trade. For crops, the base of all commerce, pros pects are good, particularly in Iraq and Iran, where there have been excellent rains. We have all joined in heartfelt congratula tions to his Majesty the Shah and his people on his miraculous escape from the attempt on his life by a fanatical youth. How greatly we rejoiced when we heard of his Imperial Majesty’s escape from death or mortal injury. His people cannot spare him ; that his Majesty sustained several bullet wounds shows how narrow was his and their escape. Iran’s Seven-Year Plan Iran has now embarked upon its seven-year plan. The plan is still in the formative stage ; the execution of it will be in the hands of capable Iranian administrators, with the help of foreign experts. All phases of national economic life are being examined with a view to their improvement. The plan is designed to transform this ancient country and to raise its people to higher standards of life by exploiting its natural resources. The past year has been an epoch in our his tory. Our 60-year concession from the Iranian Government ended on January 30, 1949. The period, with its two world wars, was one of change. These are some of the chief. A Period of Modifying Agreements Since our establishment the change from a legal system based on religious law and pro vincial governments more or less independent of the Central Government, into a modem State, ruled from the centre, with a modern legal system administered by civil courts has taken place. Sixty years ago Persian currency was metallic silver; now it is an inconvertible note issue managed by the Bank Melli Iran. During those 60 years, the advantages allowed us by our original concession lapsed or were modified by agreement between our selves and the Iranian Government, with but one exception, exemption from certain taxes. When our concession came to an end we neither asked, nor wished to ask, for any new concession, or for any renewal of our exemp tion from taxation. Conditions in modem Iran make it unnecessary. We were and had for long been ready to carry on our business in Iran under the ordinary law, without any sort of special treatment. A new situation, however, arose when at this time the Iranian Government contemplated legislation and regulations affecting foreign banks which would have involved the fulfil ment by us of conditions which we should have been unable to fulfil, and would thus have resulted in our having to withdraw from busi ness in Iran. Sir Kinahan Cornwallis, accompanied by Mr. Musker, our London sub-manager, visited Teheran on the occasion and placed our posi tion before the Iranian Government. In the result the Iranian Government was able to adjust the new proposals in a manner which, to the best of our belief, will make it possible for us to continue in business in Iran, although under conditions which restrict its amount and with that, the services which we can render to the commercial, industrial, and agricultural communities of Iran.Efi EOT OF THE NEW REGULATIONS We continue in Iran therefore as a bank of deposit authored to deal in foreign exchange, and with authority to maintain our existing branches. Our capital in Iran has been sub stantially increased under a guarantee of repatriation on six months’ notice at the same rate of exchange as that at which it was trans- 11 15 required by the new regulations *1 , 5 1 5 u pe , r cent -.°f ol,r total public deposits kCPt Wlth th « Bank Me,li Iran ^ an interest-fiee account. We believe that so severe a restriction upon the business of a bank is without precedent in its severity. With this limitation of our business, we have to reduce some of our services in the interests of economy; and we are, in due course, closing OU u a t Arak and Bushire, and our sub-ofhce in the bazaars at Teheran. The Iranian Government considers it desir able that we should omit the word “ Imperial ” from our title. Our business outside Iran has developed m recent years, and before long shall have fewer branches in Iran than outside it- E° r some time we have contemplated changing our title to one more appropriate to our business, and as this is now the wish also °^ tbe ,? m P er i al I ran i a n Government, we are takmg the necessary steps to change our name East ”^ e BntlS ^ ® an k °f I ran and the Middle When we have obtained the approval of the Privy Council to a Supplemental Charter effecting the change, we shall hold the special meeting of members needed to approve it. Improving Economic Position in Iraq I In Iraq conditions are more stable than a year ago, politically and economically. Under the ab'e guidance of the present Prime Minister -H.E Say,d Pasha Nuri as-Said-many steps have been taken, and more planned, to improve the organization of the country and the conditions of life of the people. Many econormes have been undertaken and it has been decided to balance revenue and expendi- ure. A new Banking Law will soon come into l ^ he dl ? ft has bee n under discussion and the law when passed should be no great impediment to our normal business The Statutes of the Iraqi National Bank have been r&gt;m n i U r J hlS f tate Bank wi]1 act as a Central Bank and shortly take over the management of the currency.

During the past year new regulations have been made by the Syrian Government for the control of foreion SSor P ng fh WhlCh , have benefited business ^ iatro . ductlon of these regulations most of the foreign exchange business of the country was done in the bazaars and did not come to the banks. It is with deep regret I branch° Mr^n ^ the m ana ger of that branch, Mr D. A Green, died last July as the result of wounds received in an air raid. L f. banon our branch in the capital, Beirut, continues to prosper, and during the year we have opened a new branch at Tripoli pil 1 ^ ,s n ° w the headquarters of the Iraq etroleum Comptiny. Owing to inactivity at Haifa, business formerly done there has tended Lebanon. New regulations t P^ th e control of foreign exchange, similar to l h „A e ,l n Syna ’have been made in the Lebanon and they too have stimulated business. New Branches aJX Government of his Majesty King Abdullah of the Jordan has given its consent to the opening of a branch of this bank in the capital at Amman. Our branch there should be open for business in a few months; it will be a useful addition, complementary to our business in the adjacent Arab States, where our services seem to have been appreciated In another important area of our activities' K B ! rSia D n u G P lf) our chain of branches, ft? wait » Bahrein, and Dubai, has been extended by the opening of a branch, with the consent of His Highness the Sultan, at Muscat We are the first bank to establish itself in his territory and we are satisfied that the existing vo him e oi trade justifies our decision. The development of oil-fields in the Persian Gull continues apace. This area is said to contain the world’s biggest undeveloped reserve of mineral oil and we are now well placed to its future banking requirements. I he development of the area is transforming the lives of the inhabitants of those barren lands in which the oil is found, and there is an excellent opportunity for British trade to step m and supply the wants of the inhabitants, which mpw, because of oil revenues, both direct an ^» redirect, must naturally increase. Our relations with all the rulers in the Persian Gulf are cordial and friendly. Modernization of Staff Facilities 1 he arid and hot climate of the Persian Gulf makes it necessary for us to do all that we can to ameliorate the conditions of our staff in that area, and this has our attention. We 3re constructing new modern air-conditioned offices and houses for our staff at Kuwait and Bahrain, and we expect them to be completed in the coming year. Our thanks are due to the staff who have worked hard in the bank’s interests often under pioneering conditions. I again visited some of our overseas branches in Iran and the Persian Gulf last autumn, and can testify from what I saw that we have a staff worthy of our con fidence.r The British Bark of Iran &amp; The Middle East fbf •kUj- I O^J \ * • * * t A ^ *j\c' TELEGRAPHIC ADDRESS: ' BACTRIA ' IN REPLY PLEASE QUOTE , ^ r* OUR REP ^.-LlLL H.M.
