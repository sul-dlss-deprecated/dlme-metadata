Russian force. —No operations against the Turkomans have apparently been undertaken as yet by the Gurgan force, but arrangements for the installation of a hospital at Astrabad, and the organisation of camel transport are in progress. As far as is known by the Eussian staff here General Madritoy has not yet left Askhabad. It is considered possible that General Kuropatkin may be giving the Turkoman a chance to make their submission before proceeding to extremities against them. Half a company of the 732nd Saratov militia (drujina) company reached Meshed on the 17th instant. The men, who are of good physique, include a fair proportion of the professional classes—barristers, engineers, actors, etc., and are armed with the Berdan rifle. They were employed in the suppression of the Jizak disorders during last summer. The headquarters of the 1 st Semirechia Cossack, including machine- gun (2 maxims) and signalling detachments and band arrived here on the 22 nd instant. 101. Arms traffic. —Hajji Ghulam Hussain, who is reported to have expended 10,000 tumans recently in the purchase of arms at Tehran, has arrived and is said to have brought some arms with him and to be expecting other consignments. It is understood that he is on the look-out for wealthy Herat arms- buyers. The finding of these arms presents great difficulties as not only are the traders able to secure the connivance of the police by liberal payments, but the rifles themselves are despatched piecemeal by various otherwise innocent caravans, a favourite device being to let in a rifle barrel into the woodwork of a pack-saddle. 2,500 rounds of ammunition are also reported to have been despatched a few days ago to Sarakhs by Karbalai Muhammad Taqui, a trader of that place, concealed in “ kishmish” loads. This matter will be brought to the notice of the Provincial Director of Customs and of the Eussian Military authorities. 102. Governor- General. —Kamran Mirza, Naib-as-Saltana, the new Governor-General of Khorasan, has arrived at Gui-i-Khatmi on the outskirts of Meshed where he will await the end of the.month of Safar before entering the city. ji Herat and Afghanistan. 103. Germans and adherents .—Little news of importance is to hand this week. The inconsiderate behaviour of these gentry and their retainers is not conducing to their popularity with the people of Herat. 101 . Reliefs. —A jamadar and 20 sowars have been despatched in relief to Gulran, at which place 100 hhawanin are stationed in addition to the regular cavalry. The latter are at present 50 under strength owing to the despatch of an escort to Kabul. A risaldar and 65 men of the regular cavalry has been detailed to proceed to Anardarra on relief. 105. Training. —The infantry of the garrison are to carry out in turn one practice of musketry for which 5 rounds per man has been allotted. Sappers continue to construct trenches, gun-emplacements, etc., at Ghurian (near Herat). The Naib Salar intends to practise the infantry at this work in the spring. i:j *; o L ] FO-ac.J .....106. Equipment .—The Herat tailors have been ordered to supply 50 workmen per week to prepare uniforms for the troops from the cloth received from Kabul. 107. Khawanin.—^Q Naib-ul-Hukuma has detailed Habib alia Khan head of the khawanin, to patrol the frontier from Gulran to Anardarra to check the numbers of these sowars actually present on duty. Russian Turkistan. 108. Turkomans. —Swakhs Turkomans have received word from Afghan istan that any who care to emigrate will be settled on Government (khalsa) land, and are reported to be much encouraged by this news. Ihe Russian authorities are said to be taken strict measures to prevent emigration. 109. Semirechia .—Further rounding-up of mutinous bands is reported with the capture of arms, cattle, and very large numbers of sheep. In one district the Kirghiz have handed over 1,400 horses as a mark of obedience, and the levy of workmen continues. A portion of these are to be utilised to rebuild the Russian settlements destroyed in the disorders. The Kirghiz from Issyk Kul district are being ejected and will be settled in the Naryn region. 110. Central Asian -Congestion of freight, owing to shortage of rolling-stock, is noted, and Samarkand and several smaller stations have been temporarily closed as‘ regards freight traffic. The railway authorities are elaborating schemes for dealing with cotton and other commodities in order to prevent deterioration from weather and delay. Meshed ; 23rd December 1916 } E. A. F.

IGN SECRET Letter Dated INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING THE 30th DECEMBER 1916. Mo. 'i o 9 FEIi Khorasan and North=East Persia. 111 . Russian Force. —There is no news of any action as yet against the Yomut Turkoman by General Madritov’s force, nor has the Eussian staff here received intelligence that the General has arrived on the scene of action from Askhabad. According to the papers General Kuropatkin has started on a tour in the course of which he intends to pass some days at Askhabad, and it is possible that the object of this stay may he a consultation as to the measures to be taken. Although estimates vary considerably as to the strength in the field which the Turkoman can put up, the general trend of Eussian military opinion here is that the troops composing the Gurgan detachment are in excess of the requirements of the situation. The following is the disposition of the troops composing the present Khorasan detachment, which, in the absence of any special circumstances calling for change, is likely to obtain for some time :— Meshed. —General Headquarters. Headquarters 1 st Semirechia Cossacks with 2 machine guns. 2nd squadron of above at Meshed and on line Meshed-Gaudan. 3rd squadron of above at Meshed and on line Meshed-Turbat- i-Sheikh Jam (At Turhat-i-Sheikh Jam, 40 men of this squad ron). J 3rd company, 732nd Saratov militia. Turhat-i-Haidari. —4th squadron, 1 st Semirechia Cossacks, holding town and line Turbat-i-Haidari-Meshed. Kain. —1st squadron of above at Kain and on line Turbat-i-Haidari-Eum. Kuchan.—\ 3rd company 732nd Saratov militia. 112. Arrests. —According to a report from Amghan, the Eussians have arrested the katkhuda of Bezd in the Pain Jam on suspicion of communicating secretly with the Kaudani Ilbaigi’s people and through them with the Germans in Herat. An arrest has also been made near Kariz in connection with the arms I traffic. 113. Suspect. —An Indian in destitute condition, giving his name as Hashim Ali and stating that he is a returning Mecca pilgrim, was detained yesterday pending investigation. It appears possible that he is a deserting follower from Mesopotamia. 114. Arms traders. —Certain Heratis who have arrived with opium for sale and who are credited with the intention of purchasing arms with the proceeds are under observation. * Herat and Afghanistan. 115. Artillery reorganisation. —The fodder question appears to have upset for this winter the scheme of the Naib Salar for the horsing and training of his 6 batteries. On the representation of the Naib-ul-Hukumat that the presence of so large a number of horses in the city would exhaust the stock of forage ^urgent orders have been issued by the latter for the supply of revenue grain in kind to Herat), the Naib Salar unwillingly consented to send the horses out to the districts for the winter, and orders have been issued for the despatch of the horses of 5 stables to Oba, 4 stables to Ghurian and 1 stable to Shaflan. Ten artillerymen w ere sent with each stable to ensure proper care ofthp animals. Sufficient animals have been retained at Herat to horse 3 selling which appear to be » abeyance, have been sent out to surrounding villages to “ brl t ^ n i’ in is required grain. There is at present no evidence to show whether this gram is lequireu for norma', expenditure or for any special purpose. ^ l 1 6 Munitions —The Commander of the Artillery having J e P°^. e , If additional^ aT^tcfuit to 'complete ^'personnel necessary for their manning. \ It may he worth noting that this is the WhTtetedteatte-Ihe tvppIcs to the defence of Herat (reference paragraph 93). While mclicatin tne unlikelihood of any offensive movement of the Herat troops it pomts to the possibility of their being called upon to act defensive y. . -no Trmmun Instruction in the use of the maxim is being given to men other than ^those of the regular maxim battery, 100 selected gunners me^lso being given special drill with fields and mountain guns with the view of acting as instructors to other units of the garrison. ^ 119 Hospitals .—Following on his inspection of the military hospital the Naib Slaf Zf directed the Enrolment of 20 intelligent and web-educated youths to undergo instruction in ambulance work. He has piomisetl an increase in the pay of the hospital staff. 120. Germans and adherents.—Latest news from Herat points to no movement for the present on the part of the German party, the discontent of wblse Persian servants increases. Neither Wagner nor Kazim Beg appear to enioy much local popularity. . „ ., , 121 Discipline The Naib Salar has forbidden the wearing of blankets by Afghan troops at parade, which unsoldierly practice, he states, tends to make them ridiculous in the eyes of foreigners present at Herat- Russian Turkistan. 122. Turkomans .—Reports from Sarakhs state that the lo °^ ^ u ^omans have been called upon by the Russian authorities to supply 60,000 puds o, wheat and that this amount is in process of delivery. The present garrison of Russian Sarakhs is given at 200 Cossacks with 1 maxim; that of Pul-i-Khatun at 200 men. ^ # 116. Railway construction.— A rumouv h current that the Russian proiect the construction of a branch line from Tejen to Sarak s. 117. Central Asian Railway.— The accumulation of a large quantity of kerosene at Erasnovodsk for want of cistern cars is noted. The management of the line are calling in all empty cisterns and propose to dispose of the accumulation by running special trains. , 118 Supplies.—The probable shortage of grain in Turkistan for the native population and the fact that cultivators, fearing scarcity of grain for food purposes, are decreasing the area formerly under cotton in favour of cereals form the subjects of questions before the Duma. The fact that the Bokharan authorities are making demands on outside grain from Turkistan, while cornering their own abundant supplies, is adversely criticised. . , 119 Disorders .—General Kuropatkin has confirmed 4 out of 32 death sentences pronounced by a Military Court at Samarkand on participators m the Jizak disorders, but has substituted 10 years’ penal servitude in the case of28 othors. In the case of 84 other persons condemned to death on the same count he has confirmed three sentences and commuted the remainder to terms of penal servitude from 12 to 4 years. Considerable reductions have also been made in sentences of penal servitude and imprisonment passed on 21 individuals in the Katta Kuighan District. E. A. E. REDL, Lieut.-Colonel, G.S.O.

A caravan carrying goods from Duroh to Kala Kah (25 miles west of Farah) was recently attacked by some 28 robbers who had come from Washir in Zamindawar to raid Kainat. The people of Kala Kah attacked the robbers, and four or five casualties occurred on each side. The caravan loads were recovered. Subsequently the robbers carried off 15 camels from Kala Kah. The Governor of Farah proposed to send 200 sowars to exterminate the robbers, but ‘ ‘ the Colonel has reported the matter to Kabul for orders ’ ’! The Kazi of Farah who had been summoned to Kabul left the capital without permission and has been taken back in custody. Two Kadkhudas of Farah, named Abdur Rahim Khan of Dizzak’and'Mohsin Khan, have been refusing to pay revenue. They were threatened with military punitive measures, but as both are ‘ ‘ Khans of big tribes 5 5 their cases have also been referred to Kabul. A Darwish has been perambulating in Chakhansur and Farah, inciting the people to make trouble on account of the execution of the two Indian traitors in Sistan. See Diary No. 47 (item 11 ). Sardar Ata Muhammad Khan, Sanjerani, of Lha,:ar Burjak, returned to his home on about the 19th December. I understand that he did not go further than Kandahar. He has been ordered to strengthen his fine of posts against the British. F. B. PRIDEAUX, Lieut.-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain.

News from Afghanistan. Agricultural disturbances are still occurring in Farah and Lash Juwain. The Governor of Chakhansur is said to have been ordered from Kabul to tour along the frontier after Nauroz and tc build forts wherever necessary. He has also been directed to repair the disused Tarakkun canal and to construct a ‘ band ’ for it. Sistan Race Meeting. The first race meeting in Sistan was held this week with great success. It extended over three days and all High Persian Officials, Sardars and Khans attended it by my invitation. Events were framed for all classes and grades of British and Persian Government employes and also for the horse-breeders of Sistan. The programme included an exciting camel race. The totalizator earned 145 Tomans, from which the stakes were given. Three suitable horses were acquired for the Levy Corps and two others were purchased by officers. We hope to have another meeting before the advent of the hot weather. A School for Sistan. Taking advantage of the pressnce of all the Sardars and Kadkhudas of Sistan j in the town, a leading Revenue official, Sadr-ul-Udaba, convened a meeting this week to discuss the question of opening a Modern School at which, among other subjects, English and Hindustani are to be taught. A committee was elected over which Sartip Muhammad Reza Khan (now occasionally styled “ Hashmat- ul-Mulk ” in succession to his brother who has assumed the title of “ Hisam-ud- Dauleh ”) is to preside as chief Director. It is anticipated that an income of about 160 Kharwars (Tabrizi) of grain, worth about 1,280 Tomans, will be annually contributed, towards the support of the institution, and with the first year’s subscription a building will be constructed. I hear that the Consulate is to be asked to import the Indian teacher. The scheme seems to be very worthy of our support. Insecurity of the Roads. See Diary No. 51 of 1916. The discussion over the Khidri robbery case has been dragging on, as the Governor has alternately been protesting that the crime occurred outside his jurisdiction (which we know is not the case) though only four miles from Khidri, and holding out hopes of settling up as soon as the claims are satisfactorily proved. The Deputy Governor of Khidri, Muhammad Nasir Khan, came into Birjand twenty-one days after I had demanded his recall. There now seems to be no chance of recovery of the looted property though the Governor is said to have despatched an influential Khan, Kadkhuda Ismail Bahluri, to negotiate with the Herat authorities on the subject. jl. i i 0 0 u.-. i ^ ^ * INDIA FOREIGN SECEET/.r Letter.

Persian officials. —Referring to paragraph 2 of Diary No. 47 the Consulates- General are agreed that the present Rais-i-Nazmiah should continue in office and each will send a message to Kamran Mirza to that effect soon after his arrival at Meshed. 2 . Husain Kuli Khan, the Rais-i-Gendermah, was dismissed during the week by the Wazir-i-Maliyah but was reinstated on a protest by the Russian Consulate- General. to whom he appealed for assistance. He is on good teims wdth this Consulate also, and the intercession was made on grounds of personal regard. 3 . It is reported that Kamran Mirza summoned the Governor of Kuchan and the Chief of Bujnurd to meet him at Sabsawar, but that each refused to appear on account of disturbances which claimed his attention. 4 . In compliance with suggestions made to him by Mu shar-us-Salt an ah and the Mutwali Bashi, Kamran Mirza has agreed to summon Sardar Makhsus, the Governor-designate of Turkat-i-Haidari, to Meshed to answer the objections raised against his appointment by the Mullas and citizens of Turk at, vide paragraph 4 of last week’s diary. 5 . Khabir Khakan, the Director-General of Telegraphs, has appealed for assistance to this Consulate-General in view of intrigues which are in operation against him in Tehran. He is a good friend of ours, and steps are being taken to prevent his dismissal. 6 . The arrival of Kamran Mirza at Sabeawar on Monday, 4th instant, is reported. 7 . Agha Haidar Ali Khan of the Persian Foreign Office has been appointed Karguzar of Sabsawar. 8 . Persian affairs. —Referring to paragraph 7 of Diary No. 48 it seems that Muhammad Ibrahim Khan and Farhad Khan have not succeeded in arranging their difficulty with the Rais-vt-Tvjjar and that they will remain at Chinaran pending the arrival of the new Governor-General. 9 . British affairs. —Referring to the case of the Imperial Bank of Persia and Shuja-ud-Daulah, the late Governor of Kuchan (paragraph 3 of Diary No. 43), Tumans 2,000 odd have been received from the sale of certain produce of the debtor’s lands at Kuchan and paid to the Bank ; wdiile another Tumans 3,000 is actually in the hands of the Karguzar and wdll be similarly disposed of on return of the debtor from Chinaran, whither he had gone in connection with the dispute referred to in paragraph 8 above. Telegrams have been sent by the Mushar-us-Saltanah and also by the Karguzar ordering his return for the immediate payment of this Tumans 3,000. 10 . Russian affairs.- —Necessary orders have been issued by the acting Governor- General for the supply of fodder, etc., for the Russian Cossack regiment, w'hose departure from Meshed forms the subject of a recent military report. 11 . Arfa-ul-Mumalik, Head Munshi of the Russian Consulate-General, has been dismissed during the week. 12 . Persian and German intrigues. —The Babi section of the Meshed community have joined the democratic party and are attending their meetings. This is a new departure. 13. News from Turhat-i-Haidari. —The British agent reports the restoration of amicable relations between him and the Russian Consul, who has asked him to urge this office to support the appointment of Sardar Makhsus as Governor. The Consulates-General in Meshed have mutually decided however to allow* the Persian authorities to arrange this matter among themselves; neither having any special reason for interference. INDIA ENCLOSURE III j FOREIGN SECRlTAHYT. js H 14. Urns from i/ero!.-Two thieves with two stolen mares ^ “ a result of co-operation between Shuja-ul-Mulk, the Governor of Bakers, and the Afghan frontier officials. They have been imprisoned by the Naib-ul-Hukurmh on being sent to Herat. 15. Three more Russian Turkoman families from Russian Sarakhs have arrived at Gulran. Their elders have been sent to Herat, where they are being accommodated with the Turkomans whose arrival has already been reported. 16. Two packages of books have been received from Kabul for distribution among the troops, Mullas, etc. They are supposed to contain prayers, etc., re a mg to the question of jihad. 17. The Naih-ul-Hukumah has allotted certain Khalisa (Government) lands near Herat for the Turkoman emigrants referred to above, and has arranged to give them advances for cultivation purposes, to be repaid at harvest times. 18. Under orders from the Naib-ul-Hukumah the Governor of Anar Darah is sending secret agents to discover the intention of the British in Sistan and to estimate the number of their troops in that neighbourhood. 19. A letter is believed to have been received in Herat from Raja Pertab saying that he has arrived at Killa-i-Nau en route for Herat. 20 . Kazim Beg has had a fall from his horse and is under medical attention. It is said that he was formerly a schoolmaster in Syria, and that Haji Ahmad, who accompanied him to Afghanistan, was one of his pupils. 21 . Three men, believed to be Austrians, who talk no Russian or Persian, have been sent to the Naib-ul-Hukurmh by the Governor of Bala Murghab to whom they were brought by frontier guards from Jarkhu Nil. One is clothed in Khaki and the others in some blue material with caps to match. Their ages are said to be 18, 22 and 35. They appear to be escaped prisoners. 22 . On 28th ultimo Wagner made an excursion towards Badghist to Killa Perwanah, where the Austrian surveyor is working. He returned in the evening to Bagh-i-Kertah, having been watched by the sowars of the British agent. 23. The Persian servants of Wagner are displeased on account of a letter which their master has received from Persia advising him not to attempt to cross the frontier, which is at present too well guarded. ’ 24. Vide paragraph 14 of last Week’s diary. It may be definitely assumed that “ Jawash ” is a distortion of the Turkish “ Chawush ” (sergeant) and that “ Bayerl ” is the name of the person referred to. He has written to Wagner asking him to obtain orders from the Naib-ul-Hukumah for his despatch to Herat as his host Brigadier Ghulam Muhammad Khan will not let him go although he is now well enough to travel. 25. News from Karez. —Proceedings typical of the condition of this part of the country are reported from Dasht Dagharu. A ’number of sheep were stolen from certain Makus (Taimuris) who traced them to the camp of Samandar Khan, an Afghan robber chief at Jamrud. The owners complained to Shaji-us-Saltanah, the Governor of Jam, who sent an agent to recover the sheep, which was done. Shaji then himself took 40 sheep as revenue and 15 more as a reward for having recovered them and returned the remainder to the owners. The latter, who are resi dents of Bakharz, complained to Shuja-al-Mulk saying that they had already paid all revenue due to him, but he declined to interfere. 26. Hostilities are imminent between Shaji-us-Saltanah and Mir Baki Sultan on account of the former having imprisoned one of the latter’s men and having declined to release him when asked to do so. It is believed that Shaji is creating disturbance purposely at this time so that he may be unable to come to Meshed to meet the new Governor-General. 27. Shuja-ul-Mulk has severely punished some of his sowars who failed to arrest certain robbers in Buzhghan, for which purpose they had been sent there.They surrounded the village, but the thieves nevertheless succeeded in escaping, and have now made their way to Jamrud in Shaji-us-Saltanah’s territory. 28. Paragraph 12 of Diary No. 48. Husain Arab has reached Sa’dabad and it transpires that he is not Mustafa Arab. His papers have been examined and he is found to be a Kandahari known as “ Arab.” 29. Condition of the Country. —Further activity is reported on the part of the Zushkis and Daulatabadis who plundered the people of Nukandar village to the extent of Tumans 100 . Another gang seized the Governor of Bakmaj and held him until ransomed for Tuman 60. 30. The Chief of Bujnurd has been asked by Mushar-us-Saltanah to assist in the capture of the robber Khuddu, vide paragraph 21 of Diary No. 49, but he has replied that he can do nothing as Khuddu declines to give battle. 31. In connection with paragraph 29 above Haji Riza Khan, Sarhang (Lieutenant-Colonel) has been sent out with 60 men to bring the offenders to book. Should he not succeed within 20 days, pickets are to be posted in some of the villages. Meshed : W. G.

Kamran left Sabsawar for Nishapur, en route to Meshed, on the 11 th instant. 2 . Referring to paragraph 4 of Diary No. 50 it has now been decided not to call Sirdar Makhsus to Meshed but to allow him to proceed direct from Sabsawar to Turbat in company with an official specially deputed by the Governor-General- elect to enquire into the charges against him. The Amin-ut-Tujjar and other prominent Turbat people are now prepared to receive him as Governor. 3 . Murtaza Kuli, the Governor of Sabsawar, has been in danger of losing his post but will retain it thanks to intercession on his behalf by the Russian Consulate- General, to whom he applied. He is quite satisfactory to us. 4. Muhakkak-ud-Daulah, Karguzar of Meshed, has been granted the Shir Khurshid medal of the First Class for good services. 5 .

There is scarcity of charcoal in Meshed town, and the friends of Munshi Nizam are contemplating the organisation of a disturbance in connection therewith which they propose to use as a means of obtaining his appointment as Rais-i- Nazmiah. 11 .

Bulatoff, the newly-appointed Russian Consul at Birjand, is staying in Meshed en route to take up his post, visits have been exchanged between him and this Consulate-General. 14.

A meeting of democrats took place during the week in the house of one Meshdi Taki, and the Cabinet said to have been established by Nizam-us-Saltanah at Kermanshah was discussed. According to what was said its members are :— Nizam-us-Saltanah, Prime Minister. Salar Azam (son of above), Foreign Secretary. Adib-us-Saltanah, Minister of Posts, etc. Haji Ismail Tabriz!, Minister of Education. Haji Saiyid Mehdi, Home Secretary. Shahzada Sulaiman Mirza has been entrusted with the task of publishing the formation of this cabinet throughout Persia. It was stated that Malik-us-Shura {vide paragraph 11 of Diary No. 49) had objected to it on the ground that all democratic societies in Persia had not been consulted ; but that a reply was given to him pointing out that although his objection is correct in principle the democrats of Khorassan do not deserve to be consulted as they had raised no Mujahidin to help the common cause. The meeting agreed that this charge was a fair one, and a circular was drafted there and then, copies of which will be sent to Nishapur, Sabsawar, Bujnurd, etc., instructing democrats to submit lists of all fire-arms in their possession and to buy more, especially from Russian troops, as opportunity offers, with a view to the formation of Mujahidin levies. This matter will receive attention. 17. Hews from Turhat-i-Haidari. —Telegrams have been sent to the new Governor-General urging the retention of the present Rais-i-Nazmiah in office. He has refused to hand over charge without orders from his departmental superior in Meshed (see paragraph 7 above). 18. M. Samsonoff, Russian Political Officer with troops, is expected in Meshed shortly. 19. News from Herat. —Two more Turkoman families from Russian Sarakhs have asked for permission to reside in Afghan territory, and their case is being considered by the Naib-ul-Hukumah. 20 . The Naib-us-Saltanah has informed the Naib-ul-HuJcumah that military officials are not to be employed in the collection of revenue, which is civil work, and the military officers who were so engaged have been recalled to Herat. 21 . Certain Turkoman families who were given Khalisa land near Aliabad have petitioned the Naib-ul-Hukuma for a change of residence, and he has promised to allot to them other lands near Herat. 22 . The three Austrians whose arrival was reported last week (paragraph 20 of Diary No. 50) visited Wagner and returned to Chahar Bagh. Subsequently Wagner prevailed upon the Naib-ul-Hulumah to let them live with him at Baeh-i- Kertah. 23. A messenger sent several months ago to Baghdad from Herat by Paschen ha-&gt; returned, bearing a letter to Wagner from a German officer (possibly Niedermayer) with whom he had travelled, in company with Turkish troops, from Baghdad to Sultanabad. I he messenger claims to have come to Herat from Iraq via Meshed, with the letter concealed in a hollow stick. ^ 24. Kazim Beg has again asked the Naib-ul-HuJcumah to arrange for him to cross the frontier, and the A aih has told him to wait until the frontier guards are changed. 25. On the 6 th instant Wagner visited Ziarat Gah, some three farsakhs from the town. He seems to have given grave offence to the local inhabitants by mounting upon the roofs of their houses to photograph the mosque without their consent. Ihis matter was reported to the Naib-ul-Hukumah, who reprimanded Wagner, much to his indignation. .26. Bayerl (paragraph 24 of Diary No. 50) has arrived in Herat. He admits having been unable to cross the frontier.27. Photographs of Kazim Beg and Maulvi Barkat-ullah have been procured by this Consulate and are being distributed to British and Russian officials. y 28. News from Kariz. —Shaji-us-Saltanah has declined to assist in the emigration of certain Turkomans who had come to him from Russian Sarakhs wishing to become domiciled in his territory. 29. Vide paragraph 26 of Diary No. 50. Shaji has released Mir Baki Sultan’s man after fining him Tumans 250. 30. M. Papov and the British agent visited Turbat on the 8 th to confer with M. Lemansky regarding Shaji and Mir Baki Sultan, and as a result Shaji was called in to Turbat on the 10 th, where he swore not to work against British and Russian policy in future. 31. The Afghan robbers, mentioned in paragraph 27 of last week’s Diary (five in number), are in Hassanabad village. Shaji-us-Saltanah is said to be taking steps for their arrest. 32. Mir Aftab, a Peshawari resident of Meshed, having been detected in attempting to dispose of fire-arms through agents in Karez district, has been given one month to settle his affairs and leave for Peshawar. 33 . Condition of the Country. —The sowars of Muhammad Ibrahim Khan of Shirwan, in response to a request from Mushar-us-Saltanah, besieged Karbalai Husain and his men in Daulatabad (vide paragraph 29 of Diary No. 50). They succeeded in arresting three men, but the remainder escaped with their leader and plundered the village of Jaghark, carrying off Tumans 200 in cash. They have not yet been captured. 34 . A party of Zushkis have entrenched themselves near Dizbad in Nishapur district as a headquarters for their depredatory undertakings. The Mushar-us- Saltanah has telegraphed to Tehran and Kamran Mirza urging active measures without any delay. 35 . A disturbance took place in Meshed town on the morning of the 14th. An assistant of the Gendarmah was misguided enough to fire his revolver into a mob who were opposing the purchase by him of charcoal for the Peshkar-i-Maliyah. One Riza Allaf, a petty merchant, was killed by the discharge. A serious riot was feared, but the offender having been arrested the people dispersed on a promise that justice would be done. W. G.

Persian Kamran Mirza, the new Governor-General, reached the environs of Meshed town on the evening of the 20 th instant. He will not enter the city during the mourning month of Safar. He was met by representatives of both Consulates-General, as usual, and received Khan Bahadur Mubarak Ali Shah, Attache of this office, with marked cordiality. 2 . Mudir-us-Sultan, the recently appointed Persian Consul at Askabad, has been dismissed, and the previous Consul reinstated. 3. Referring to paragraph 7 of Diary No. 49, the Karguzar of Meshed has received a reassuring telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, telling him that the Minister is well satisfied with his work here and has paid no heed to the complaints of Dabir-us-Sultan and others against him. 4. Persian affairs.—Vide paragraph 35 of Diary No. 51. A meeting of Police Commissaries was held during the week to discuss the fate of the gendarme, and it was unanimously agreed to oppose his execution, by force if necessary. 5. The Minister of the Interior has instructed the Governor-General of Khorassan invariably to inform the representatives of Foreign Powers in the event of any disease appearing in epidemic form, and also to report without delay to the Sanitary Committee in Tehran. 6 . On the evening of the 19th instant Haji Saiyid Asadullah Kazveni, an influential and enlightened Mujtahid and friend of this Consulate-General, arrived from Kazvin. Large numbers of people took part in his reception. 7. Referring to paragraph 2 of Diary No. 43, Shaukat-ud-Daulah, the murderer of Nasrat-ul-Mulk, who is still in confinement here, has been summoned to Tehran by the Minister of the Interior, it having been apparently decided to deal with the case there. 8 . On account of the unsettled condition of the Shirwan district and the inability of the Government of Kuchan to deal with the situation, the district has been transferred to the Government of Bujnurd. Adl-ud-Daulah, the Governor, and other Kuchanis, have protested against the change, urging that the Chief of Bujnurd is alone responsible for the raids of Khuddu and others, and that he will now raise trouble elsewhere in order to extend his territory still further. Adl-ud-Daulah, asking for the orders to be rescinded, begs for Tumans 3,000 and 5,000 rounds of ammunition to enable him to take more active measures against the robbers. The people of Shirwan on the other hand have telegraphed to the Central Government their appreciation of the transfer. The Minister of the.Interior has replied to the Kuchanis declining to reconsider the question or to admit their right to protest. He points out that had they been zealous in the interests of their country they would long ago have dealt with Khuddu ' and the other robber bands. He has also telegraphed to Bujnurd urging the Chief to turn his attention to Shirwan affairs. 9. Russian affairs. —M. de Beauvais, 1 st Secretary to the Russian Consulate- | General, has presented a pair of embroidered curtains of red broad-cloth to the Shrine. Ihis gentleman is very active, but shews no desire to interfere with our position or interests in Meshed. He has recently received some special grade promotion for good services. 10. On the 19th December, the/ete of His Imperial Majesty the Czar Nicholas II, a parade of Russian troops was held at 10 a.m. and in the evening a state banquet was given at the Russian Consulate-General, after which the healths of His Imperial Majesty and His Majesty King George were drunk. During the day a telegram2 of congratulation from Kararan Mirza was read by the Kargnzar in the course of the official reception by M. Nicolsky. 11 . Vide paragraph 9 of Diary No. 48. The Russian telegraphist at Nishapur J has commenced work, orders permitting his employment having been issued. 12 . A Russian Engineer, apparently engaged in railway survey work, lias visited Persian Sarakhs recently and received supplies from the Governor. He has left for Pul-i-Khatun. 13. Kaufmann, the son of the German merchant who was killed by a in Meshed more than a year ago, recently returned to Meshed from Askabad, to which town he had been deported, disguised as a Kurd. He has been arrested and imprisoned by the Russian Consulate-General. J 14. Vide paragraph 5 of Diary No. 43. News has arrived from Tehran that His Majesty the Shah has conferred upon M. Nicolsky the 1 st class medal of shir and Khurshid. 15 Persian and German intrigues. —Early in the week a report was published in the town that hostilities had ceased, and the immediate result was a small and very temporary fall in the prices of sugar and rice. A secret meeting of democrats was held on the night of the 18th at which [the report was discussed and a somewhat violent speech was made by one Shaikh Muhammad Sultan, who upbraided those present for not having worked with sufficient zeal in Turkish interests. It was decided to collect subscriptions to help the Turkish cause which are to be sent to an agent in Kum. A further meeting took place on the 21 st evening when some letters were read which had just been received from Tehran. They contained nothing oi special interest beyond that the relations between Nizam-us-Sultanah and the Turks and Germans were unimpaired, and that the latter were only waiting for a further supply of machine guns and ammunition to attack the Russians again. These meetings were attended as usual by our representative, masquerading as a democrat. 16. News from Turbat-i-Haidari—Vide paragraph 17 of Diary No. 51. The Nazmiah question is still unsettled. 17. Sardar Makhsus, the new Governor, has arrived, but the majority of the people took no part in his reception. 18. News from Herat. —Certain Khassadars who had been dismissed from service have been granted land and takavi advance by the Naib-ul-Hukumah. 19. Six Turkoman families have received similar favours, but their chief is displeased because they have not all been granted land in one place. The Afghan policy is obviously to distribute them in order to prevent subsequent possible combination in opposition to the Government. 20 . Miya Dad Khan, the Sadbashi of Dahana-i-Zulfikar, has brought to the Naib-ul-Hukumah two Turkomans, reporting that they are from a party of seven which have come from Russian Sarakhs with 600 sheep, and that he has sent the remainder with the sheep to the Governor of Gulran. The Naib has ordered an enquiry, believing the sheep to be stolen property. 21 . The Naib-ul-Hukumah has ordered revenue grain to be conveyed from Gulran for storage in Herat. 22 . It is reported that Wagner has paid a reward of Tumans 25 to the messenger mentioned in paragraph 23 of Diary No. 51. 23. Bayerl was asked why he could not cross the frontier. He replied that all the news which Wagner had received was false : that he had heard while at Chakhansur that the Allies would eventually emerge victorious from the war : and that they would not be able to cross the frontier until peace was made. 24. Wagner has apparently tried to obtain from the man in charge of Gazargah Shrine a certain stone affixed to the grave of one of the ancient kings.The custodian refused to hand it over, and his action has been approved by the Naib-ul-H ukumah. 25. One of Wagner’s servants is said to have stated that his master is in correspondence with some person in Meshed. Further enquiry will be made on this point. 26. Wagner and Kazim Beg are now reported to be on the best of terms* 27. The Naib-ul-Hukumah abused the messenger mentioned above for having taken his letters direct to Wagner instead of first bringing them to him in order that he might use his discretion in regard to passing them on or not: and informed him that he was not to go again to Bagh-i-Kertah or to hold any communication with Wagner, on pain of being sent in chains to Kabul. 28. News from Karez. —Shaji-us-Saltanah has presented Tumans 10,000 to Kamran Mirza as Peshkush. He borrowed the greater part of the sum from local people. 29. Vide paragraph 18 of Diary No. 49. Enquiries are still proceeding regarding Haji Mahmud Herati who is also believed to be engaged in illicit arms traffic with Herat. 30. The British agent has returned to Karez from Turbat-i-Jam. 31. The Naib-ul-Hukumah of Herat is said to have issued an order forbidding any Persian subject to enter Afghan territory and directing that all their claims should henceforth be settled on the frontier. 32. Owing to reports of smuggling of arms at Zorabad the British and Russian agents have arranged each to post one of their sowars as detectives, one at Musabad and the other at Gosh Laghar, for the present. 33 . Condition oj the Country. —A further raid is reported by the robber Khuddu, this time on the village of Killah Safid in the Sac Walayat district. Two persons were killed. The Chief of Bujnurd however {vide paragraph 8 above) has sent out 100 sowars with orders on no account to return until they have captured Khuddu and his compainons. A late report states that Khuddu has been wounded in a fight with some of the Rais-ut- Tujjads men. 34. The general impression produced by the German peace proposals seems to be that they are a sign of wealmess on the part of our enemies. Meshed : 23 rd December 1916. W. G.

I hear that the German at Kala Kang has temporarily postponed his departure, having received a message from some other German who is on the way to Chakhansur requesting him to await his arrival.

See Diary No. 49 . Motasim-us-Sultaneh, when calling on me on the 18th instant, informed me that he had been telegraphically told by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs that he should not have refused to call on General Tanner, and that he should take the earliest opportunity of expressing his regret for his failure to do so. • Insecurity in Kainat. A Consulate Secret Service employe who was carrying 1,770 krans from Birjand to Ahwaz for payment to other men has mysteriously disappeared, and it is feared that he must have been attacked and made away with, as he is a man owning landed property. News from Afghanistan. The Deputy Governor of Anardarra recently visited Chah Laila near the border. It is said that he was enquiring into the case of looting of sheep from Kainat. See Diary No. 50.

Russian force. —Geneial Loginov, Commanding Russian tr ops in Khorasan, lias received orders to detach the 2 squadrons of the 2nd Semirechia Cossacks quartered in Meshed and at posts from Turbat-i-Haidari to Gaudan to Astrabad. This regiment is thus transferred from the Khorasan io the Astrabad force in tolo* and the 1st Semiieckia Regiment will have to find alt duties from the Perso-Russian frontier to Sehdeh. As at present contemplated no change will be made in posts held along the line, but the reserve of 2 squadrons at Turbat-i-Haidari will betaken up in finding the Russian garrison at Meshed and the posts previously held by the 2nd Regiment. General Loginov has pointed out the shortage of troops at his disposal entailed by this measure and it is possible that infantry militia may be sent to garrison the towns. The punitory measures against the disaffected Turkomans in the Astrabad region make great demands on mounted troops, and it is evident that the Cossack regiment mentioned in last week’s summary (paragraph 40) is not forthcoming from Turkistan where the only regular Cossack regiment not sent to the front—the 6 th Orenburg Cossacks—has been sent to suppress the disorders in Semirechia. Official reports have been received by the Russian Staff here of the death of a Cossack and the (slight) wounding of an officer in a recent skirmish near Astrabad. Rative rumour reports severe fighting with heavy Russian loss. Although since the change of command of the Astrabad force casualty reports affecting the 2nd Semirtchia Cossacks only have been received here, it is most probable that early intelligence would be received of any events of importance. 55. Arms smugglers.— from Zorabad indicate suspicious conouct on the part of certain Taimuri savors, adherents of Kusrut-ul-Mulk at that place and at Musabad. They aie supposed to have assisted suspicious persons over the bolder and to be engaged in arms traffic. They are being watched. A British subiect, Mullah Mir Aftab, a Peshawari Pathan, appears to have been detected by the Russian Agent at Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam and the Butish A-ent at KarisJn smuggling rifles to Afghanistan. According to the report ot the former he attempted to hrihe the Russian interpreter to silence, saying that as the rifles were destined for use on the British border against the infidel English, the interpreter should as a good Musulman give him his countenance. The matter is under investigation. 56. Deserters. —A local agent has brought in two Indians in destitute condition who state that they are sweepers employed with British Artillory in Mesopotamia and that they deserted from Basrah. They say that they were originally drafted to Basrah from Ludhiana Jail. They are under detention pending investigation. , , „ , 1 D Herat and Afghanistan. 57.

Khasadars. —An officer ■C i n o V fh P Military officers and non-commissioned officers were recently summoned by the Naib Salar. He promoted several of them on the spot and detailed them for service at the frontier posts of Kafir Kala, Dahna-i-Zuluqar, ara Tapa and Maruchak. A drill instructor for khasadars, who requested exemption on the ground of sickness in his family, was dismissed the service with contumely. 60. Officers .— At a recent durbar the Naib Salar assured his officers that the only requisite for promotion was capacity and zeal, and that family interest or recommendation would have no effect in future. The officers are reported to be much encouraged by this utopian prospect. Arrangements have also been made that the officers of 2 battalions will attend durbar in rotation daily, in order that the Naib Salar may become personally acquainted with all officers under him, 61. Instruction .— Orders have been issued for 24 well-educated sepoys from each battalion to receive special instruction in drill. Six other specially intelligent men per battalion are to be trained to replace the Kabul instructors who will be promoted to higher rank. Instruction of the Taimani sapper recruits has begun and the barracks of 2 companies of the Kandahari battalion have been vacated for them. The Naib Salar has introduced route-marching. 62. Munitions.—Two kharwars of powder—description not stated—were received with the ammunition convoy from Kabul reported in paragraph 46. 63. Recruiting rumour .—Much alarm has been caused among the towns people by a hitherto unconfirmed rumour that the Naib Salar is about to put into effect the exaction of 1 per 8 of men of military age at Herat. 64. Disorders .—From native reports bad relations obtain between Turkomans and Russian soldiers in Tejend, Sarakhs, etc., districts, isolated soldiers being killed by Turkomans when opportunity offers, and reprisals being taken by the Russians. Four dead Turkomans were found near Sarakhs whose deaths were attributed to this cause. According to a private letter received by a member of the native staff of this Consulate-General a large body of Turkomans were in reserve to rush the town of Tejend in case the attacks of their comrades on the railway had been successful. During the tour of General Kuropatkin in Semirechia he counselled moderation and calmness in all his speeches but he said there must be no question of the Kirghiz ever again holding land in the districts where the revolt had been most severe. At the same time he deprecated hysterical revem e on harmless individuals and stated that any such measures would be severe'y punished. Some disorder having occurred at Taskent over the issue of meat, with a threat to wreck the butchers’ shops, an order threatening the severest penalties by the military courts has been published. Russian Turkistan. Meshed ; The 2oth November 1916. E. A. F. REEL, Lieut.-Colonel, G. S. 0.SECRET 1 i 9!7 1 1NTELUGENCE SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK END NQ THE 2nd DECEMBER 65. Russian ,/brce.—Two squadrons of tlie 1st Semirechia Cossack Regiment with 3 officers arrived at Meshed from Turbat-i-Haidari on the 29th nltimo. On the 1st December, Headquarters, 2 squadrons and 2 machine guns of the 2nd Semirechia Cossacks left for Astrabad via Thrjnurd and Gunbad-i-Kabus. They are expected to take about 20 days en route. Posts occupied by the 2nd Regiment have been taken over by the 1st, the arrange ment generally being that the 2 squadrons based on Turbat-i-Haidari find the posts on the line Meshed-Turbat-i-Haidari-Rum, and the 2 squadrons based on Meshed, posts on the line Gaudan-Meshed-Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam. The Khorasan force is at present decreased by 2 squadrons formerly practically in reserve at Turbat-i-Haidari, and 2 machine guns from Meshed. General Loginov has been informed that a company of the 732nd militia from Khojent (presumed strength about 200) will be sent to Meshed but the approximate date for its arrival is not known. Much sickness, chiefly malaria, prevails among the Russian troops in the Astrabad region, and according to an official report received here last week 13 deaths had occurred at Astrabad from this cause. According to local native rumour the revolted Xomut Turkoman are stated to be assisted by Turkish and German officers. This is probably fantastic ; at the same time it is quite probable that their agitation has been fostered by agitators in Turkish and German pay. 66 . Escaped prisoners .—Russians at Shahrud arrested on the 6 th ultimo one German and one Austrian escaped prisoner, who had reached that place from Turkistan by way of Bujnurd. 67. Marauding Turkoman.—Abtoil Hussain Khan from Bujnurd is reported to have taken 70 savars against Yomut Turkoman wTlo have been raiding flocks in Bujnurd territory. 68 . Unrest —According to reports from Pul-i-Khatun and Sarakhs a good deal of secret traffic in letters, and communication between Tuikomans, Afghans, and Baluchis is proceeding in the North-East angle of Persia. There is talk of a further Russian call for ‘ s recruits ” from the Turkoman in the Sarakbs region. Herat and Afghanistan. 69. Kabul .—A letter from Kabul dated the 8 th November, presumably referring to despatch of arms and munitions, states that there was nothing of interest to report. 70. Khasadars.—'UhQ Naib Salar has given orders that the title of ' Khasadar ” is to be discontinued and that these men are m future to be refeired to as sepoys of the 10 th Infantry. 71. Taimanis —160 Taimani recruits have been quartered in the vacated barrack of the Kandahari infantry and are under training as sappers. Orders have also been issued to the officers of the Ghaznichi infantry battalion to arrange quarters in their barracks for two companies of sapper icciuits w o are expected to join shortly. 72. Training.—All Herat infantry are now engaged in route-marching. The officers have been instructed to extend the marches to a maximum o 73. Transport .—The Naib Salar has been inspecting and classifying the Government ponies. He is anxious to eliminate all white hoises rom e Artillery. l,..,.. ,n E Khorasan and North-East Persia. 8 miles. INDIA F74 Germans and adherents* — Vagner caused a false alarm by remaining absent for the whole day on an alleged shooting expedition from which he returned, however, at sunset. One of the Austrians at Herat is reported to be an expert surveyor and is said to have carried out surveys of several routes in Western Afghanistan. From Russian sources, Barakatulla has entered into relations with lurkomans from Russian territory. Whether correct or not this intelligence should have the effect of making the Russians anxious to lay hands on him for their own sake. They have also heard that Wagner has recently re-opened correspond ence with Inayatulla Khan, with whom he had had no relations lor some time, and that Raja Muhendra Partap had something in the nature of a triumphal progress through Afghanistan, apparently when proceeding from Kabul to , Mazar-i-Sharif. Betters from Partap, dated iMaz r r-i-Sharif, have been received at Herat. Russian Turkistan. 75. Central Asian Exclusive of damage caused to property of employes, the loss suffered by the Central Asian line in the Jizak summer disorders is estimated at 67,888 roubles. During September the railway received 4,286 loaded goods wagons from other Russian lines, and returned approximately the same quantity. During the month, excluding passenger baggage wagons and trains for the service and upkeep of the line, 13,775 goods wagons were loaded on the line. 76. Military ZaSoMr.—Reports have been received from Turkomans who are employed in the Pskov Government in charge of Chinese labourers that they are well and contented. Labour parties continue to be formed in Semirechias where, however, this work as well as the horse mobilisation has been impeded by heavy snow. E. A E. REDL, Lieut*-Colonel 3 G. S. O.

Prom reports from Sarakhs 400 Turkomans were collected for guard duty and despatched to Merv. Some 40 individuals attempted to oppose this measure but were unable to do so. 30 of them are reported to have been subsequently arrested and sent to Merv, and it is rumoured that some 25 other arrests have been made in this connection. 700 are now being called tor. Many Turkomans are no doubt opposed to this measure ail fi some 30 families are said to have crossed safely to Afghanistan from the Sarakhs region to escape the exaction. Working parties continue to be formed in Semirechia, and General Kuropatkin has arranged for the employment of 3,000 Kirghiz on the Tashkent line. ( 1,620 Meshed, The 9th December 1916 .} E. A. P.

In addition a regiment of Orenburg Cossacks with 4 machine guns are expected to join later, and the force will be still further increased by the headquarter and 2 squadrons, 2nd Semireehia Cossacks, with 2 machine guns now on their way from Meshed. The arrival of J company, militia infantry, with 1 officer is expected here in a few days, 2 officers and J company having remained at Kuchan 87. Escaped prisoners .—An arrival from Bed-i-Sukhta in the Sarakhs district reports having seen a party of 7 Austrians in that neighbourhood. He reported the matter at the village whereupon 7 Berbens set out on horseback to search for them but were unsuccessful in finding the men. The intelligence is satisfactory inasmuch as it proves that our efforts to ensure the co-operation of the Berberis have had some result. 88 . Suspects .—A local agent brought in an apparently destitute Afghan arriving from the direction of Tehran. A careful search of his person only revealed a paper dated 2 years back stating that he was a Khasadarof Chakan- sur, who from his own account had been to Mecca and returned via Baghdad, Kirmanshah, and Qum. He was detained here for some days but nothing further could be elicited from him. The supposition that he might be a return ing German messenger is discounted by the fact that the man had practically no money at all. With reference to the 2 Indians mentioned in paragraph 56, a telegram confirmatory of their identity was received from Ludhiana Jail, and it would appear that they were members of one of the penal companies despatched for work in Mesopotamia. They were despatched to Sis tan at the end of last month in charge of a Hazara levy party. 89. Arms According to the report of a reliable agent, the Baluchi headmen of the section domiciled near Garmab in the north-east corner of Persia who at times graze their flocks within the Russian frontier Jan and Gul Muhammad (reference Intelligence Summary for 22nd April, paragraph 3)- maintain a regular and lucrative traffic in arms with Turkoman from °y e ^ the Russian border, as many as 200 rifles of various sorts changing hands within a month. Judging from the number of arms available in this part of the worl I should imagine that this total is considerably exaggerated, but there seems to be no doubt that these men supply all the arms they can get hold of. ioget ler with other suspicious persons in the same line^ of business, I have brought their names to the notice of the Russian authorities.

Bayerl has reached Herat with an escort furnished by the Governor of Farah. The Austrian prisoners, mentioned in paragraph 78, who are 3 in number, have been transferred to the Bagh-i-Karta after some argument on the subject between Wagner and the Afghan authorities. 91. Artillery reorganisation. —The IsTaib Salar having completed the apportionment of horses to batteries, has turned his attention to the personnel. He assembled all the artillerymen and selected from them 6 batches of 150 men each. He has thus formed 1 maxim, 3 mountain, and 2 field batteries with an establishment of 150 men and 110 horses each. From the remaining men he selected 4 men to serve each gun in the fort, and announced his intention of enlisting additional men for the artillery in the near future. The measure has caused discontent among the men, many of whom are uprooted from their previous surroundings, and they are reported to be heaping curses on the Germans and Turks at whose door they lay the initia- i tive of the unpopular reform. 92. Remounts .—30 horses have been received from Badghist and passed by the ls T aib Salar as fit for service. He has ordered that all artillery horses be exercised for 20 days with clothing on up to a maximum of 8 miles, after which time they are to be saddled up and given harder work. 93. Progress.—Addressing his officers at Durbar recently, the Naib Salar expressed his satisfaction with the strides towards efficiency made by the Herat garrison in a short period, and declared his confidence in their ability to give a good account of any enemy who might come against them. 94. Khasadars. —The Sartip of the Kafir Qala khasadars with his 2 sons was discharged from the service after inspection bj the Naib Salar. 95. Orderlies.—In pursuance of the recently introduced practice of frequent change of the unit employed on orderly duty, a company of the Logari has been replaced by one of the Kandahari battalion for this purpose. 96. Farah. —Ammunition (S. A.) received at Farah from Herat is reported as 94 boxes with a total contents of 16,920 rounds. The remaining boxes brought by the convoy were sent on to Kandahar. 400 recruits have been enlisted. The hlaib Salar has requested permission from Kabul to summon the Mazari battalion to Herat for his inspection and dismissal of inefficient men. 97. Ohor. —A company of infantry has reached Ghor and is being used by the Governor to coerce the inhabitants to supply recruits on the basis of 1 man in 50. This they are now doing “ willingly.” 98. Supply of munitions. —A report having reached the Russians that guns and ammunition had been despatched to the frontier near Yazdan, I requested the Herat agent to verify the rumour. He reports that it is untrue. Russian Turkistan. 99 Disorders.

Persian officials. —Shahzada Muhammad Hashim Mirza has been appointed Rais-i-Aukaf of Khorassan, to reside at Meshed. He is a prominent democrat who has already once been deported from Meshed. The matter is receiving attention. 2 . In consequence of a rumour that Kamran Mirza had appointed Mudabbir- ul-Mulk as Rais-i-Nazmiah of Meshed in supersession of the present incumbent of the post, Mushar-us-Saltanah communicated with Tehran ; and Kamran Mirza has directed that the present Rais should continue to serve until his arrival. 3. One Muhammad Riza Khan Yawar has been appointed Naib-ul-Hukumah of Khaf. He has joined his post. 4. Vide paragraph 1 of last week’s diary. It is now said that Kamran Mirza has sold all his property for Tumans 25,000 to pay the journey expenses of himself and suite from Tehran to Meshed. This report has still further increased the uni versal feeling of anxiety which exists regarding his appointment as Governor-General. It appears moreover that Naiyir-ud-Daulah is trying to return, and that his reinstatement would be a welcome alternative to the public. 5. Persian affairs.- —The Government troops which had been sent to Shirwan in connection with the dispute between the Rais-ut-Tujjar and Ibrahim Khan (tide paragraph 3 of last week’s diary) have been recalled, the case having been compromised and peace restored for the present. It is hoped that the robber chief, Khaddu, who was giving trouble in this neighbourhood, will soon be induced to come in to Meshed. 6 . Certain minor Shrine officials have taken sanctuary in the Shrine during the week as a protest against the proposal of the Mutawa i Basin that a quarter of their salary should be deducted monthly as a contribution towards payment of the debts of the Shrine. They propose to telegraph to Tehran if the scheme is not abandoned. 7 . British affairs. —A curious incident had occurred which fortunately termi nated in a friendly compromise. On 23rd September last, a M. Kogan, Russian subject and representative of the firm of Samsonov in Moscow, entered into an agreement with the Imperial Bank of Persia that they should pay him the value of 120,000 roubles in Persian money at 225 krans per 100 roubles within five days, on condition that the Manager should receive notice from his agent at Moscow within that time that M. Samsonov had paid to him 120,000 roubles. On the fourth day an otherwise mutilated telegram was received by the Bank wherein the words “ pay Kogan 120,000 roubles” were plainly decipherable. The Manager, however, declined to pay on the ground that the cypher number which is invariably required for payments was not clearly readable ; and a request was therefore made for the telegram to be repeated. The repetition arrived in due course some days later, but meanwhile the value of the rouble had fallen to 175 krans per cent, and a considerable loss was inevitable. After much discussion and friendly correspondence between the Consulates-General it was decided that each side should bear half the loss. This solution seems equitable in view of the fact that the Telegraph Department accepts no responsibility. 8 . Russian affairs. — {Secret.) An interesting proposal was made by the Mutawali Bashi to M. Nicolsky during a visit recently to him. It was suggested that, with a view to remove some of the anti-Russian feeling which still exists locally as a result of the bombardment of 1912, M. Nicolsky should ( 1 ) obtain from the Czar some suitable gift to the Shrine ; and ( 2 ) cause the barrier of the Shi me sanctuary to be restored to the position it occupied previous to the bombardment. The Mutawali Bashi urged the serious consideration of these two points. 9. Some days ago a batch of Russian Cossacks Were fired upon in mistake for robbers by the people of Sultanabad, a village in the neighbourhood of Nishapur, and one of their horses was killed. The villagers, discovering their mistake, bpgged f ENCLOSURE Hi j FOREIGN SECRET MA LI Letter. 2 fj A b Vfor pardon and handed over a good horse to replace that killed. The Cossacks took an inventory of the rifles in the possession of the offenders, and the Rais-ut-1 ujjar who owns the village has been asked by the Cossack commander to hand them over to him. This matter is under discussion. 10. On November 13th certain Barbaris brought a German to the Karguzari mistaking it for this Consulate-General. M. de Beauvais, who happened to be there at the time, examined the man and found him to be an escaped prisoner, a non commissioned officer, who had come across the frontier from biberia through Turkestan. lie was escorted to the Russian Consulate-General. 11 . Persian and German Intrigues. —It is reported that one Sattar Khan, a pro-Turk, who was ejected from Meshed two years or so ago on account of his views, has been appointed Governor of Khar Waramin in Tehran district, and that he has sent agents to Tun and Turbat-i-Haidari. The British agent at lurbat has been warned. 12 . It seems that Saiyid Ali Riza of Baghdad, an ea^-dervish entitled Imam Hazrat Hujjat-ullah Wahdi Sirri, has been induced by the Turks to proclaim himself Imam Mahdi, and that he has already secured followers m various places. His agent in Meshed, one Haji Taj, has been interviewed by a member of this Consulate staff. The Haji says that he was with Saiyid Riza in Baghdad, and ^aat he sent him to work among Persians for the unity of Islam ^ under The centre of this movement in stated to be Bursa in Anatolia, and the zanur or “ appearance ” of the new leader of Islam is to take place on 10 th Safar in Kufa. Haji Taj admits that this is a new scheme on the part of the Turks to replace that for a jehad which had failed. He appears to have made converts among the middle class people here, including the democratic element, and an address delivered by him in the Shrine on the 17th produced some little excitement among the com mon people. It is not known here to what extent the movement has succeeded in other places. 13. Malik-us-Shura, vide paragraph 12 of last week’s diary, is believed to be in favour of the claims of Saiyid Ali Riza. 14. News from Turbat-i-Haidari—The prisoners Abdul Kadir and Shamshir Singh arrived on the 8 th and left on the 10 th for Rum where they are due on the 18th. No hitch seems to have occurred regarding the escorts provided by the Russians. The appointment of Sardar Makhsus is not popular, both mullas and laity are protesting against it. 15. News from Herat. —A Haji who has just returned from Mecca, et ccetera, via Tehran, was interviewed by the Naib-ul-Hukurmh on the 4th instant. The Naib asked particularly about the state of affairs in Tehran ; whether it was true that the Turks had occupied the city and that a son of the Sultan was there. The Haji replied that it was all untrue, but added that the presence of Turkish troops at Hamadan had caused some consternation in Tehran. 16. Wagner called on the Naib-ul-Hukumah and asked leave to go out shooting. The Naib refused, saying that the Amir’s permission w r as necessary. Kazim Beg received a similar reply to a request to be allowed to visit Bala Murghab, a frontier post. 17. Wagner visited the Naib Solar and asked for orders to be issued to the frontier officers to pass him into Persia. The Naib replied that he had applied to the Amir for permission and expected a reply shortly. Wagner thereupon said that he could wait no longer and would go without permission, whereat the Naib expressed his surprise and displeasure, adding that Wagner had hitherto been respected by the Afghan officials but would lose their respect by such improper speeches. (Fom the above it seems likely that the Afghans had been persuaded that the recent Turkish attack in Western Persia would succeed and that their attitude towards their guests has changed in view of its failure.) Kazim Beg has exercised his transport ponies during the week, apparently with a view to a journey before long. He and Maulvi Barkatullah have photo graphed the various shrines of Herat.18. Tide paragraph. 17 of last week’s diary. Great difficulty is experienced in regard to the transport required for the revenue grain, only 200 camels having as yet been procured. The Government animals are being requisitioned for this work. 19. Vide paragraph 13 of Diary No. 44. Sixteen more Ghazni men have been sent in to Herat by the Governor of Anardarah. It seems that three were wounded in the fight with our men and the remainder were not fit to travel, hence their detention at Anardarah. They have 26 rifles and some ammunition. Orders have been issued for them to be set at liberty. 20 . News from Karez .—The Governor, Shuja-ul-Mulk, has received orders to engage 100 special sowars to guard the frontier against Afghan robbers ; such sowars to be personally responsible in the event of any robberies occurring. He has replied that 100 are not sufficient and that he could not hold the men responsible as desired. 21 . On the 12 th instant between Khaf and Karat a band of Afghan robbers attacked a caravan of Khafi travellers but the latter succeeded in beating them off with a loss of one killed and a few wounded. 22. Condition of the country .—Seven murders are reported from the neigh bourhood of Gunabad during the week, robbery being apparently the object in each case. 23. A raid was committed by a band of robbers on a small village near Bajgiran some few days since. Money, sheep and cattle were plundered. A telegram has been received by the Karguzar of Meshed reporting the event and asking for guards to be appointed. 24. In the direction of Turbat disorder also seems to be rife. The Persian post envoy was attacked between Mahulat and Tabas and his bags stolen. This road is said to be infested with outlaws. W. G.

Shahzada Hasham Mirza’s return to Meshed, at least in any official position, has been prevented. 2 . The Governor of Sabsawar has left Sabsawar for Tehre.n, leaving the local police officer to carry on the government. His object, apparently, is to avoid the necessity of entertaining Kamran Mirza on the latter’s passage to Meshed. 3. Ajdan Hazur, the Karguzar of Sarakhs, has left Meshed for Sarakhs, taking with him an assistant from here. 4. Musaddik-i-Diwan, the Kargnzar of Darajez, has also left for his post. Before quitting Meshed he begged the Karguzar here to work for the dismissal of the Russian agent at Darajez who is in league with the local governor. The Karguzar promised to see what he could do. 5. Saiyid Ali Khan, a Commissary of Police in Meshed town, has been dismissed and has taken refuge in the Shrine with the object of intriguing against the Rais-i-Nazmiah. 6 . Persian affairs. —^Regarding the matter mentioned in paragraph 20 last week under “ Karez New’s, ” a telegram has been received by the acting Governot General from the Ministry of the Interior ordering him to make arrangements for guarding the frontier people from Afghan robbers by other means if Shuja-ul-Mulk professes inability to do so. But the Persian Government decline to supply more than 100 sowars whereas Shuja requires 200 . Mushar-us-Saltanah is replying to the Government that Shuja is the man for the work and that his recommendations should be accepted. 7 . Paragraph 3 of last week’s diary. The recall of the Persian troops from Shirwan has been cancelled owing to the attitude of Khuddu, the robber chief. A fight has actually taken place between them and Khuddu’s men in which there were three or four casualties. The Government troops have been ordered not to return until they have captured Khuddu. Meanwhile Muhammad Ibrahim and Farhad Khan of Shfrwan have come in to Chinaran, where they are to be met by messengers from Meshed, pending the settlement of their dispute with the Rais-ut-Tvjjar. 8 . Russain affairs.—The Russian Government is somewhat uneasy in regard to the emigration of Turkomans into Afghanistan. M. Nicolsky asked whether we knew anything of the matter as he had heard that no less than 200 families had emigrated. He was informed that so far as our information went the number of families w?ts 65 only. 9 . A Russian telegraphist has been sent to the telegraph office at Nishapur but has not yet been allowed to work, orders not having reached the Persian officer in charge. 10 . Persian and German intrigues.—It having been reported that Abdullah Mirza a late Commissary of Police in Meshed, who had been deported by the Consulates General some time ago, was likely to return here, steps have been taken to prevent this. 11 It is reported among the local democrats that a separate peace between England and Germany is on the point of conclusion, and they are much elated accordingly, seeing in this the approaching ruin of Russia. 12 . The British agent at Karez has intercepted a letter written by one Taj Muhammad in Herat to Mirza Abdurrahman Khan of Sa’dabad near Karez winch states that the person addressed will soon be visited by Husain Jan Arab.

News from Herat,—The leaders of the 65 Turkoman emigrant families referred to in paragraph 8 above have arrived at Herat, their names are Arna Bardi and Yaldash Bai. 14. The Naib-uLHuJcumah is purchasing horses for Government stables. During this week 22 were brought in from Kila-i-Nau, but of these the i\ aib selected two only, rejecting the remainder on account of the price asked being higher than the condition of the animals demanded. 15. Two servants of the Governor of Kila-i-Nau were attacked by robbers near Badghist and one of them escaped and made his way to Herat. The Naib-ul- Hukumah then sent sowars to the spot and six of the robbers were captured, four of whom appear to be Government sepoys, 16. The messenger mentioned in paragraph 11 of Diary No. 43 and in previous reports has left with the intention of returning to Kabul. He has been paid 40 Kabuli rupees by the Naib-ul-Hukumah for his expenses. 17. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has ordered winter clothes and posteens to be provided for his German and Turkish guests. From this it appears that they will stay at Herat for the winter. It is now thought that Kazim Beg and Wagner are really friendly and that their quarrel, previously reported, was mere pretence. They have several times been seen in company with one another during the week. On the 13th instant they took photographs together at Gazargah. 18. Kazim Beg was asked why they were exercising their ponies if they had decided to remain in Herat for the winter. He replied that it was necessary to be ready to start at any time in case any part of the frontier might be left un guarded by their enemies. 19. On 13th instant Haji Ahmad, Kazim Beg’s Nazir, and Nasrullah, Wagner’s servant, visited Mustafa Arab. The latter gave him £5 in English gold. 20 . Nasrullah has induced the Naib-ul-Hukumah to release a Sistani (who had stolen two mares from Russian territory three years ago and had been imprisoned for the theft) on the ground of his Persian nationality, representing to the Naib that he had been in German employ. Nasrullah has taken the Sistani to the Bagh-i-Kartah. 21 . The Naib-ul-Hukumah and Naib /SaZar visited Wagner on the 15th at the Bagh-i-Kartah. They discussed various news concerning the w*ar and condoled with Wagner on his. inability to leave at present, saying that the present strict guarding of the frontier by the enemy would not continue indefinitely. 22 . On the 15th Kazim Beg suggested to a sowar that he should kill the British agent for a reward of 10,000 krans, promising him also the title of a Ghazi and the approval of the Amir. The sowar, however, pointed out that both Kazim and the British agent were guests of his Government and moreover the agent was a Kandahari and a Musalman. He added that he knew him well and was not so well acquainted wdth Kazim : and the incident ended in each threatening to report it to the sowar s superior officer. 23. The arrival cf a fresh Austrian, it is said from India, is reported. He appears to have come t&gt;?d Quetta to Kandahar, disguised as*a muleteer, and from thence to Herat. Wagner received him with great satisfaction. Special enquiry will be made regarding this man. 24. Saiyid Riza, servant of Bayerl, whose departure w’ith his master was previously reported, has returned to Herat. He states that they were unable to cross the frontier and both became ill at Farah where Bayerl has remained. The latter ordered Saiyid Riza to return to Herat and inform Wagner that it was impossible to cross, the frontier being too well guarded. 25 26 25. The fact that the liberty which the German party in Herat formerly enjoyed has recently been somewhat curtailed is confirmed from private sources. 26. Neivs from Karez, —The soivar bringing British and Russian mails from Herat and Karat have both been fired upon by Afghan robbers during the week, but each escaped injury , .3 near Dagham. He will be suitably dealt with. 28. It is reported that about 10,000 Afghans of the Kandahari Sukzai tribe have been permitted to settle near Kuhsan, where good water exists Their men are m possession of firearms. plundered sheep and camels brought them into Zurabad district, where a party of .Russian Cossacks and Turkomans attacked them and killed 16 recovering all the stolen animals. &amp; 29. A theft was committed from the house of the British agent on the night of the 17th instant. Three horses were carried off, but they were subsequently recovered, the pursuit of the thieves being at once taken up. 30. M. Papov, Russian agent, has returned to his post. 31. Shuja-ul-Mulk continues to make such efforts as he can to hold the various *Afghan robbers in check, and appears to be assisted to some extent by the Afghan frontier officials. 32. Condition of the country.—Zushki robbers are still active on the Kuchan road ; during the week they captured the headman of the village of Muhammad- abad and obtained 280 tumans from him as ransom. A servant of Haji Husain Agha, a respected resident of Meshed, has been arrested and brought to the police office. Papers have been found on him proving that he has been instrumental in supplying the Zushki robbers with arms and ammunition. Enquiry is proceed ing. 33. Two hundred sheep were plundered during the past week from Mehrabad, a village in Khaf district, but prompt action by local sowars brought about their 34. Khuddu s men have plundered a caravan at Shuruk near Shirwan and carried off goods valued at 2,000 tumans. rr ^? m m Af ?l' an T folloWerS of Mir Baki Sultan, a former Deputy Governor of lurbat-i-bhaikh Jam, crossed the ( frontier into Russian territory and having ■nmnnprprl sTippti anrl r*amola VkT&gt;r&gt;nrYV&gt;4- V i* j • . i ® recovery.

Persian officials. —The Mutwali Bashi is trying to persuade the general public to participate in the arrangements proposed for the reception of the new Governor-General, Kamran Mirza. The general feeling, however, is against response to his persuasion. 2 . The appointment of Sadarzada as Naib Karguzar of Nishapur, which was proposed, has been vetoed by a protest from the Russian Consulate-General. 3 . It seems likely that the present Governor of Darajez will be dismissed on the arrival of the new Governor-General, and the former incumbent, Mansur-ui- Mulk, reinstated. 4 . Persian affairs. —Several influential Mullas of Turbat-i-Haidari, with followers the party aggregating about 40 persons, have arrived in Meshed to test against the appointment of Sardar Makhsus as Governor. The Russian Consul at Turbat, before their departure, bound them over to be responsible for any disturbance which might take place in Turbat during their absence. 5 Secret enquiries have been made during the week by the Persian Foreign Minister from the Karguzar regarding the Kuchan road ; and it is reported that the Russian Legation at Tehran has also been approached on the subject. The Hais-ut-Tujjar, who has apparently done nothing, is to be asked what step he proposes to’take for the repair of the road, for which beholds the contract. 6 Mushar-us-Saltanah, the acting Governor-General, has applied to the Russian Consulate through the Karguzar, for a pass to send 2,000 cartridges to the Governor of Tabas, but as yet no reply has been received from the Consulate. The cartridges are urgently required owing to the unsettled condition of the district of Tabas. 7 Russian affairs. —Dabir-us-Sultan, a land-owner of Kuchan and a Russian vroteae having lost case of land dispute with some Kuchanis, has commenced an intrigue against the Karguzar of Meshed, whom he holds responsible for his defeat. Up to the present his efforts have not met with success. 8 Persian and German Intrigues. —Munshi Nizam, the well-known intriguer, who has more than once been suspected of pro-Turk activities, has gone to Sabsawar to meet Kamran Mirza with the object of obtaining from him the post of Rais-i-Nazmiah. The Consulate-General are determined that he shall not be appointed to this or any other post here. 9 A recrudescence of democrat activity is reported. A secret meeting was held at night in the house of the brother of Malik-us-Shura {vide paragraph 13 of Diarv No 47 and previous reports) which was attended by an agent of this Consulate. A discussion upon Russian Caucasian policy was the principal feature of the meet ing and it revealed the ignorance of the speakers on the subject. This discussion Allowed bv mutual exhortations to persevarence and expressions of en couragement in view of the approaching fulfilment of the prophecies of Haji Taj and others. . 1 10 Haii Taj [vide paragraph 12 of Diary No. 47 and previous reports) has written from Nishapur to his agent in Meshed to have some black flags inscribed with the war cries of Islam in apparent preparation for a religious war. 11 . A second meeting of democrats took place on the night of the 30th November and was attended by the representative of this Consulate. A recent disturbance in Tehran was discussed and it was mentioned that two pro-Russians Sardar-ud-Dauleh and Amin-uz-Zarb, had been killed therein. The services of Sattar Khan (paragraph 11 of Diary No. 47) to the democratic cause were highly extolled^as ^ said that Ma i ik _ us -Shura (paragraph 13 of Diary No. 47) has reached Tehran Safely and that he will shortly publish a newspaper the appearance of winch will be a sign that matters arc prospering.

News from Hera(.-The Naib-ul-Hukumah has ls f'ed strict orders reearding the care of Government mrawnserms ; pointing out that they are built iTZ comfort and convenience of travellers and should be maintained by the public in accordance with the principles of mutual assistance. Vide paragraph 14 of last week’s diary. The Naib-ul-Hukumah seems to have been'mor! fortunate in regard to a batch of 70 The in from Chakhchuran, only three having to be rejected as unfit for purchase, remaining 67 have been acquired and placed in Government stables. 13 A Herati upon whom were found some letters in the Hebrew character has been sentin to the Naib-ul-Hukumah from Chihil Dukhtaran. He is remanded for further enquiry. 14. Saiyid Reza, whose return to Herat was mentioned last week, states that he and his master first tried to cross the frontier at Anar Darah, as we had expected. TTg vino- failed there they went to Chakhansur where both became ill as reported. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has sent medicine to Bayerl (this seems to be his ran an “ Jawash ” his name) at Farrah where he is being entertained by BrigadieT-Genera! Ghulam Muhammad Khan. The Naib desires that Bayerl Jawash should return to Herat when fit to travel. 15. One of the Austrians in Herat has made a map of the country from Kam to Herat, which Wagner showed to the Naib-ul-Hukumah. 16 Raiah Pertab is still at Mazar-i-Sharif. He has sent registered letters to Wagner and Kazim Beg, in the latter of which he remarks with appreciation upon his treatment by the A aib-ul-Hukumah of Mazar. 17 News from Karez. —It appears that of the Afghans mentioned in paragraph 27 of last week’s diary only four were killed and that the remainder succeeded m returning to Jamrud with some amount of plunder, a share of which they gave to Mir Baki Sultan. Shaji-us-Sultanah, the Governor of Jam, demanded his share but Aziz Khan, the robber chief, replied that there was none for him. Mir Baki Sultan has been visited by the Russian agent at Turbat-i-Shi ikh- i-Jam, M. Lemansky, whom he asked to pardon him for past offences. The man would be of much use to us were he definitely to change his [attitude, and it is hoped that something may come of this. On the other hand the conduct of Shaji- us-Sultanah seems to be changing for the worse, as there is evidence of his having assisted Afghan robbers to esc?.pe arrest. 18. The British agent at Karez has intercepted incriminating letters written by Haii Mahmud Herati of Meshed which shew this person to be actively assisting Turkish interests. The matter is being investigated, subsequent to which suitable action will be taken. 19. Mirza Abdul Hamid, the Amin-i-Tazkara of Turbat-i-Shaikh-i-Jam, who was arrested by the Russians and sent to Meshed some time since, has been appointed to a similar post at Karez. 20 . Condition of the Country.—-Vide paragraph 21 of Diary No. 45. A message has been received from Muhammad Zabih Ullah, the Zushki robber chief, intimating that he will never again attack Jagark, on 'account of its connection with this Consulate-General. It seems that the Zushkis are supported by Haji Mirza Yayha, Mirza of the Meshed Shrine and that Haji Hussain Agha is the patron of the band known as the Shikaris. The acting Governor-General himself remarked on this appalling condi tion of affairs, with a smile, a few days since. 21 . Further conflicts are reported from Shirwan between the Persian troops and the outlaw Khuddu, and general distress prevails throughout Khorasan on account of outlawry. W. G.

December 1st. —Brigadier-General C. 0. 0. Tanner and Captain Saunders left Sistan for Birjand via Lutak, from which place they will motor along the west side of the Hamun. December 2nd— 2 nd-Lieutenant Crossfield, 19th Punjabis, with the Indian prisoners Abdul Kadir, Shamsher Singh and Ali Asghar (deserter from Mesopotamia), reached Sistan en route to India. It seems almost certain that there have been two parties of Germans in Chakansur. I believe that the Governor, Sardar Gul Muhammad Khan, brought down two or three members of the Mission in his train from Kandahar. I also believe that Colonel Fakir Muhammad Khan of Herat, son of Ghulam Ahmed Khan Brigadier of Chakansur, brought two Germans with him, who I think must be' Bayerl and Saiyid Biza. The latest information which has reached me suggests that these two men left for Herat on about 22 nd November with a large caravan of merchandise brought from Nushki. It remains to be seen Whether they do not attempt to slip across the border at some point up the road. Of the other party of Germans it is said that they have provided themselves with fakirs' disguises, and that they still intend to make a dash for Sarhad and Mekran. This egregious individual, Motasim-us-Saltaneh, has distinguished himself by refusing to call on General Tanner, though all the other heads of Departments called after the General had called on the Deputy Governor. The Karguzar has never exchanged visits with the Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, as he claimed on arrival here that the new-comer should be called on first; Now, however, he claims to be of higher rank than the Deputy-Governor himself and consequently entitled to receive the first call in all circumstances. I told him that the master was not of sufficient importance to refer to Tehran by telegraph for a ruling, as the British Military authorities have no need for corresponding with him officially. It is reported from Chakansur that a large Afghan caravan carrying goods from Nushki has been attacked and looted at Madari Padshah in Afghanistan. The Jalaudar's name is Jalal Khan. It is rumoured in Koh Malik Siah that Khalifa Khair Muhammad, the notorious leader, who once sacked the Girdi rest-house, is now on his Way back to Afghanistan from Mekran with a caravan of arms and ammunition. 1916.

The Brigadier has been told that he will be held personally responsible that none of these rifles is earned over the berder. One breech-loading gun is also said to have reached Kala Kang. Insecurity of the roads. A large mule caravan was attacked by robbers near Khidri on the northern border of Kainat on the 1 st instant. A Cavalry Jemadar of the Kermanshah Consular Escort was caught, beaten and robbed of 1,000 Tomans m cash, his Government rifle and all his personal effects. A British Indian merchant of Meshed named Muhammad Husain Hakkak lost turquoises and cash valued at 4,540 Tomans. Four other traders including a Hindu lost 1,432 Tomans, ^hore were 59 mules in the caravan, of which 30 belong to Shaukat-ul-Mulk. The robbers proposed at first to carry off 10 of the Shaukat s mules, but on being fold that they belonged to the “ Amir of Kainat,” took 10 others instead. The leader of the robbers is said to be Zal Beg Baluch, an old employe of Shaukat-ul-Mulk. The Deputy Governor of Khidri, Muhammad Nasir Khan, has behaved exceedingly badly in the case. He made no attempt to pursue the robbers and made no report to Hisam-ud-Dauleh. The Jemadar, ISur Muhammad Khan, heard in Khidri that the Deputy Governor was in league with these robbers. We have claimed compensation from the Governor, and I shall recommend to His Majesty’s Minister the deportation of Muhammad Nasir Khan to Tehran if the money is not promptly paid up. The Birjand Karguzar. See Diary No. 42. Itisam-ul-Mulk has heard from his son at Sarakhs that a new Karguzar has been appointed to Sabzawar. Evidently the Russians objected to his appointment, as I anticipated they might. The Karguzar presumes that he will now stay on in Birjand. We still however hear rumours of Nabil-ud-Dauleh being under orders for this district. The Agricultural 'prospects. The first rain of this winter fell in Birjand on the 13th December, and a slight shower fell in Sistan en the 14th. The Helmand is in strong flow and the bund at Kohak has not been repaired in good time. There is consequently a deficiency of canal water in Sistan. F. B. PRIDEAUX, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain.SECRET. ' 191 / 51 5 MESHED INTELLIGENCE REPORT, DATED THE 16TH NOVEMBER 1916. As a favourable opportunity recently presented itself for a short visit to Transcaspia I proceeded thither cm Tabadkub, Amirabad, Karatigan, Khwaja Bolan and Dushakh in view of the reputed scheme for the construction of a railway to Meshed by this route. (Reference—Captain Blair’s notes forwarded with M. A.’s despatch of 20 th January 1913 and route sketch accompanying it.) Hailxjoay construction scheme in North-East Persia .—As far hack as 1912 a line from Dushakh to Meshed was mooted and Russian engineers carried out a preliminary survey. The war no doubt caused this to fall into abeyance but during the current year, as reported in Meshed Diaries and Intelligence Summaries, 2 engineers have been carrying out investigations in the North-East corner of Persia, as far south as Kanz, and by the Sabzawar road to Astrabad. They have just returned to Russia and although consi derable secrecy is observed, from several sources it appears fairly certain that they are prepared to recommend the construction (a) of a line from Dushakh to Meshed via Chacha, the valley of the Ab-i-Garm, and Tabadkuh. (It is evident that this alignment will involve the tunnelling of the mountain range over which passes the track between Tabadkuh and Amirabad, and on my way I was unable to see any deviation by which this expense could be avoided. I have since heard that the tunnel has been considered practicable and that early steps towards its realisation are probable.) ( 6 ) of a line from Bandar Gaz through Astrabad and Sabzawar to Meshed. It is apparently considered that the exploitation of the Mazandaran forests will repay the outlay on this. No information is available as to when this second scheme will be seriously consi dered. 2 From Dushakh I proceeded by rail to Askhabad and Erasnovodsk, returning to Askhabad and thence to Meshed. Little activity was to be noted along the C. A. line and considerably less than the normal amount of rolling stock was seen. Operations against the TwricmoB.—Although not apprehending any ious trouble the Governor of Krasnovodsk considered that the Hurkomanwould never have occurred to the Turkomans unaided. The Russian Customs officials scattered alonj* the frontier with small detachments of Frontier Guards are living in considerable anxiety at the present time. ^ 3. Turkistan garrisons* —I was unable to obtain a satisfactory estimate of the total of llussian troops in Turkistan at the present moment and was informed that it was difficult for the staff to determine at any given moment as the numbers are continually changing. I should, imagine, however, that there must be at least 30.0Q0 exclusive of Semirechia. General Narbut in formed me that the approximate principal frontier garrisons were as follows : Askhabad Kushk Kerki Tennez 3.000 4.000 2.000 3 000 They are all militia (“ drujiny ” ) and guns are of old pattern. They are by this time fairly well trained and the majority of the men I saw about did not appear inferior in physique to the average Russian soldier. According to General Narbut, General Kuropatkin is satisfied with the internal situation and it appears probable that the Russians have sufficient military strength immediately available to suppress promptly any local rising. There appears to be no undue anxiety with regard to the Afghan attitude although their measures are carefully watched. General Narbut stated that with the small number of troops in the country a hostile movement on the part of the Afghans would seriously embarrass them at first, but that large reserves could be sent in at comparatively short notice. 4. Local supply resources. —Partly, I imagine, owing to faulty organisa tion, and partly to the depression of the ruble, some difficulty is experienced in obtaining food and other supplies for the population although no distress seems apparent. Quantities purchasable by individuals are strictly limited by the authorities, white flour is unobtainable, and it is possible that there will be a difficulty about fuel as the winter becomes more severe. A local committee of merchants has been formed to obtain and regulate the sale of sugar and various supplies and groceries. Rutter of a most inferior quality costs 3 rubles a pound and is only to be had in small quantities; potatoes are un obtainable. Forage, vegetables, etc., could be imported from Persia in sufficient quantities, but owing to the depression of the ruble and the tariff fixed by the Transcaspian authorities, the Persian importer can only sell at Askhabad at a heavy loss. Generally speaking, however, the inhabitants are no worse off— possibly better—than in many parts of Russia. 5. Railway construction .—In the short time available I was unsuccessful in obtaining any information of interest regarding the construction of local lines. As far as I can ascertain the Semirechia line has been completed to Aulieata and the track prepared as far as Pishpek, but work on this section is delayed for want of rails. Presumably the unrest in Semirechia has put an end to any work on the line for the present. There seems no reason, however, why Austrian prisoners should not be utilised a little later for this work as they were for the Kaghan-Termez line. 6 . The majority of prisoners have been sent from Transcaspia to Turkistan. I saw none at all at Krasnovodsk and very few at Askhabad. Those seen were carefully guarded. I called on Colonel Tsvietkov to ascertain if he had been able to complete the translation of Chaush’s Diary which I sent him some weeks ago. He informed me that all Hungarians having been sent to Tash kent, he had sent the document there for translation. Narbut, who in addition to his duties as Officer Commanding the Askhabad garrison, is in command of the 7th Frontier Guard District has kindly furnished me with their latest information as to the khasadar posts on the northern Afghan frontier, a translation of which I append. E. A. F. REDL, Lieut.-Colorieli o. s. o.SSCEET INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING THE 19TH NOVEMBER 1916. Khorasan and North-East Persia. 40. Astrabad Force. —Half of the 20th Horse Mountain Battery has been added to General Volkovnikov’s force and despatched to Gunbad-i-Kabus. The further addition of a Cossack Begiment is under consideration. Desultory fighting has been in progress with the Turkoman in the Atrek region and hostilities are expected to continue until these have been severely punished. Yomut sections living on the Busso-Persian frontier are proving the most troublesome and have definitely thrown off any semblance of alle giance to Bussia. 41. Khorasan Detachment. —Orders have been issued for the withdrawal of the posts of the 2nd Semirechia Cossacks—about 45 men in all—stationed at Nishapur and Sabzawar to Meshed. General Loginov has returned to Meshed after an inspection of the 1st Semirechia Cossacks at Turbat-i-Haidari. 42. Askhabad road. —Bobbers are again active near Bajgiran. Beyond the robbery of fourgons and native travellers, an Armenian travelling by carriage was recently relieved of a considerable sum of money and all his personal effects. The recrudescence of highway robbery is attributed to the powerlessness of Adal-ad-Daula, Governor of Kuchan, who _ beyond the few Government savarsat his disposal has no means of restraining the Kurds, and no personal influence over them to assist him. 43. Fscaped prisoner.—An escaped Austrian soldier has been brought in by Berberis who were apparently making for the British Consulate-General as the advisability of bringing these gentry in has been impressed on them. In ignorance of the topography of the city, however, they took their man to the Karguzari whence he was transferred to the Bussian Consulate- General. I am informed that Mir Baqi Sultan has been harbouring one or more Austrians near the frontier within the last week, and a party of 11 was reported on the Dushakh road within the Bussian border a few days ago. Necessary action in both cases has been taken. On a recent journey to Dushakh I could gain no confirmation of the reputed passage of the German and Turk last July. On the other hand the nature of the country in that region lends itself to avoidance of observa tion. ^ U. Consular changes.—A species of general pest among the Bussian Consular officials in North-East Persia is in progress M. Bravine has arrived here from Biriand en route for Khoi, and his rebel M. Bulatov is expected from Tehran shortly. M. Byeshetov, Diplomatic Agent at Askhabad, proceeas to Astrabad in relief of M. Grigoriev who is posted to Petrograd, and M Mikhailov is to be transferred to Barfrusb, being relieved at Turbat-i-Haidan by M. Antipov from Kasvin. Herat and Afghanistan. 45. Germans and adherents — Wagner has apparently fallen out ■with the Afghan authorities owing to a request to be furnished with facilities for quitting the country.

Receipt of guns. —On the 3rd instant Colonel Walidad Khan arrived with the consignment of guns and ammunition from Kabul. Twelve muzzle loading Kabul-made mountain guns reached Herat for which 109 camels were employed. In addition 366 boxes of ammunition carried on ponies were received. These included 40 rounds per gun, the balance consisting of small- arms ammunition. The camels also carried sufficient cloth and drill for uniforms for 4,000 men. A further consignment of ammunition and cloth from Kabul is expected shortly. t. 47. Recruits. —72 Taimani recruits have been sent in by the Governor of Chakcharan for enlistment by the Naib Salar. 4S. Khasadars. —In accordance with an order of thd Naib Salar that 20 men of each flag of Khasadars are to be sent to Herat in rotation for inspection, 20 Khasadars recently reached Herat from Kafir Kala. The Naib Salar dismissed II of the 20 as too old for efficient service. He has ordered that a drill instructor bo sent to each Khasadar post to drill the men on the spot till the spring when they will be relieved by regular infantry. Russian Turkistan. 49. Disorders —Near the end of October a determined attempt was made by Turkomans to destroy the Tejen railway bridge. They were repulsed with loss by the troops on the spot who were subsequently reinforced from Askhabad. A smaller -wooden bridge was burnt and the telegraph cut, the latter proceeding leading the Kussians to suspect German instigation. . ^ rom all accounts the revolted Kirghiz in Semircchia, to which province a visit has just been paid by General Kuropatkin, are in a bad way, having been forced by the various pursuing detachments to take refuge in the hioffi hills where they suffer severely from cold and hunger. The troops had received orders to give no quarter and appear to have accounted for very lar^c numbers of the Kirghiz with little loss to themselves. , I 1 n . 11 tl ; e , ls ?y k Kul region 2,000 (apparently) Eussians are reported to have been killed during the revolt and another 1,000 to have disappeared. In the Tokmak region also a number of victims is reported and 1,000 Russian houses were burned^ Many inhabitants of both sexes were taken prisoners by the Kiighiz and these are gradually being released by the troops. Very drastic legislation is contemplated for the future, measures being taken to exclude the Kirghiz foi ever from districts -where the revolt was most severe.

An attack was made recently by Turkomans upon the Pristav of Sarakhs by night. The Pristav, however, had a maxim gun ready and repulsed the attacking party with a loss of 10 casualties. It appears that the Persian customs officer at Pul-i-Khatun is encouraging anti-Russian feeling among Turkomans. 2. Russian Cossacks from Turbat have forcibly collected 30 rifles from Zorabad village. Afghanistan affairs. 1. In addition to the 2 battalions of infantry permanently stationed in \ Maimanah orders were issued two months ago to raise two more locally. As a result one battalion of 600 men has been completed and 400 have been enrolled for the second. 2. Every effort is being made for the collection of stores and provisions at Maimanah and the balance of annual revenue taxation is to be exacted in kind and not in cash. Contractors have also been appointed to collect and purchase supplies for the road stages. Report from Herat. 1. News from Herat also continues to shew that preparations for war in Afghanistan proceed with unabated attention, but there is nothing in this week’s report to suggest anything beyond a defensive attitude on behalf of the Government at present. It seems unlikely that military action will be undertaken junless the Turks meet with a great success in Western Persia or elsewhere or the promises of the German Mission are in some way fulfilled. There is reason to think that Afghan feeling in regard to the war is more religious than political. 2. The company of the new Herati regiment which was formerly reported as being in readiness to proceed to Ghar left Herat on 21st October with 8 camels carrying men’s kit and two carrying ammunition. 3. The Naib Salar has had black bulls eyes painted on the white walls in the vicinity of the parade ground and aiming drill is being assiduously practiced from tripods fitted with sandbags from a distance of 100 yards. 4. One Jemadar and 30 men of the artillery are proceeding to Gharian in relief of a similar detachment there. 5. The Governor of Shahrah has sent 51 men for enlistment in the new corps of sappers and miners and has promised to try to obtain 30 more. The Naib-ul-Hukumah informed these recruits that they are enlisted in behalf of their country, nation, and religion for three years and that he hopes they will perform good service. 6 . The British Agent learns that 84,000 rounds of B. L. ammunition is to be sent to Chakansur and Kandahar starting on 27th October, and that 160 camels have been hired for the transport thereof, and escorts have been arranged. The farm an on this subject which has been issued to the Naib Salar from Kabul states that a consignment of ammunition to replace this will soon reach him. 7. M. L. rifles have been issued to the Infantry and Artillery drill ins tructors at Herat, and 3 packets of ammunition to each sepoy for musketry practice which began on the 25th October. Eive rounds per man are to be fired daily. W. G. GREY, Lieut.-Colonel, Meshed ; for G. S. 0.r Meshed. ~ “ T . r ENCLOSURE IJ The 4th November 1916. ) S. G. P. I., Delhi—No. 410 C G. S.-14-12.16.-30.

A special messenger to Maimanah reports that the military strength of the place is :— 12 guns (mountain, probably). ' 3 infantry battalions of 600 strong each (two originally there and one newly raised, vide paragraph 1 of last week’s report), and part of a fourth for which 200 men are still required. The completed regiments are supplied with German magazine rifles but the ammunition supply for them is limited at present to 15 or 20 packets per rifle. The recruits have no rifles as yet: more are expected from Kabul. 2. Warlike preparations continue, but no fresh sign of movement or change of attitude are reported. 3. The ammunition mentioned in paragraph 6 of last week’s report has been despatched to Karah and Kandahar. There were 702 boxes and 160 loads, some camels carrying four and some six boxes. Forty loads were for Farah and 120 for Kandahar. They were unaccompanied by any rifles. 4. The Naib Salar has inspected the drill instructors at musketry during the week, and specially promoted three of them for good shooting. 5. The Governor of Tawashalan (not marked on any map at hand) has sent 62 men of the Taimani tribe to the Naib-ul-Hukumah saying that he sends this number according to the Naib’s order to provide one from every 50 men of the local community. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has sent these men to the Naib Salar for enlistment wherever they may be required. 6 . The Turk Kazim Beg has inspected the infantry in garrison on the 31st October.

Dated No. 97 M 22 DEC 1916 27 JAN 1917 1 Persian officials. —Agitation against the appointment of Kamran Mirza continues, and there have been rumours of numbers of traders and mullas intend ing to take sanctuary wherever they could find it. The telegraph office was at one time decided on, but no person coming forward to bear the expenses nothing has as yet come of the movement. The Prime Minister has- telegraphed to Mushar-us-Saltanah to say that he is not responsible for the appointment, that it is entirely the Shah’s doing. 2 . It appears that Kamran Mirza, in virtue of his new appointment, signs himself “ Governor-General of Khorasan and Sistan,” which shews that Sistan is also to be under him. This has given rise to further apprehensions. 3 . Persian affairs. —The Persian troops recently sent to Shirwan (vide para graph 13 of Diary No. 42) have not been paid, and are in consequence oppressing the inhabitants. 4 . Secret .—The Karguzar has received a cypher telegram from the Foreign Minister ordering him to recover Nawakal or animal-tax from foreigners. 5 . Secret. Complaints have been received by the Minister of the Interior against Mushar-us-Saltanah, and also protesting against Kamran Mirza’s appoint ment in the form of telegrams to which seals were affixed. Orders have come to the Karguzar, in cypher, to enquire whether or no these ^eals are genuine. This is supposed to be a trick on the part of Asadullah Zawarzada, a leader of the “ Union and Progress -Society.” 6 . The Ashura, or tenth of Muharram, passed off quietly. 7 . British affairs. Secret.—A cypher telegram has been received by the Karquzar from the Foreign Minister directing him to make certain enquiries into the conduct of Mirza Hassan Khan, the British agent at Karez. He is asked to report whether or not it is true that the agent has arrested some Austrians and Germans and sent them to the British Consulate-General at Meshed. Also whether he is not a very troublesome person who habitually arrests innocent persons and hands them over to the Russians. A full report is called for. 8 _ Secret. M. Nicolsky has telegraphed to Tehran protesting against the appointment of Kamran Mirza and suggesting that someone else, Ain-ud-Daulah for instance, should be appointed in his place M. Nicolsky has been told here that his reference will have no result owing to Kamran s patronage by the bkah, w r hose confidence he enjoys. 9 Relations are somewhat strained between M. deBeauvais, the Consulate Secretary and Mushar-us-Saltanah, the former accusing the latter of doing nothing to help Russian interests. 10 . The Russian Minister has directed M. Nicolsky to grant a month’s pay to all the Consulate establishment on account of dearness of provisions. 11 The local value of the rouble has now fallen to Tumans 15 per 100 roubles, and Uplahts have been made to the Russian Consul-General by f the Persian owners of houses and caravanserais inhabited by Russians in Meshed that they cannot accept the rents as originally feed m roubles. M. Nicolsky has reported the matter to Tehran. 12. German awl Persian Wr^s.-Malik-ush-Shura, vide paragraph 9 of Diary No 44, left for Tehran on 7 th November Before leaving Meshed he arranged a secrect meeting in his house of all local democrats and addressed them at some length. He said that it had been foretold that this would be a propitious vearTor Muslims and a disastrous one for infidels ; and added that the year would be a good one for the democrats as in it many of them would be appointed to high enclosure, in I INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Receivedoffices of State. He urged them to take courage and wait patiently: for better times, which were now close at hand, and ended by promising to send them instructions from Tehran from time to time in regard to their future conduct. 13. News from Karez. —The British agent visited M. Popov on the 5th instant. The latter informed him that he was leaving the nexh day for Turbat-i-Haidari, under orders from Meshed, there to meet General Loginov *, and said that he was to explain to the General what he had against M. Mikhailov, their agent at Turbat. M. Popov authorised Mirza Hassan to make use of the local Cossacks when necessary for the arrest of Germans or their agents; and asked him to take charge of the Cossacks in the event of the Russian doctor leaving the station. M. Mikhailov has been obstructive to us : it is hoped that he may perhaps be removed from Turbat as a result of this enquiry. 14. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —Sirdar Makhsus, the newly-appointed Governor, has detailed Zulfikar Khan as his Naib-ul-Hukumah. 15. The Russian General Loginov was expected from Meshed on the 5 th instant. 16. News from Herat. —The four Sarak Turkomans whose arrival in Herat was reported in paragraphs 10 and 18 of Diaries 44 and 45 have been promised land in Sansawar and Obeh, by the Naib-ul-Hukumah, who has also issued an order to the Frontier Officer to assist them in their emigration movement. 17. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has arranged for the hire of 2,000 camels at Government charges to bring in the revenue grain. 18. Yar Muhammad Khan, Frontier Officer, has reported the arrival of 65 Russian Turkoman families on the frontier near Chihil Dukhtran. These are being sent to Herat, a request from Russian officials for their ejection from Afghan territory having been refused. 19. Nasrullah, Wagner’s servant, has discovered a spy, a native of Khokand, and the Naib-ul-Hukumah has had him searched and imprisoned. It is believed that he is a Russian secret service agent. Wagner has also dismissed one of his grooms, apparently on a similar suspicion. 20 . On the 29th ultimo the Naib-ul-Hukumah was heard to say that it was very bad policy on the part of the Russians to oppress the Turkomans as they are doing and thus cause them to emigrate wholesale. 21 . Wagner has presented a horse to Saiyid Mustafa, who is apparently still pretending to be indisposed. 22 . It has transpired that Kazim Beg, on his arrival in Herat on 21 st ultimo, did not visit W T agner, but the latter called upon him on the following day. Their conversation being in French was not understood by those present, but it ter minated in a dispute and Kazim Beg drew his revolver and was with difficulty restrained from shooting his visitor. Hence Kazim’s desire to live elsewhere than in the Bagh-i-Kertah, reported last week. 23. Wagner s servant, Nasrullah, stated to a shopkeeper on October 31st that his master would shortly leave for Tehran, but other information is that both W agner and Kazim will remain in Herat for the present, until the Turks advance upon lehran in tact. -—- - S J ? 8 attempted to cross unconfirmed. mLnecT ^ “ reP ° rt ^ Amir ’ S Hfe taS been attem Pted, but it is as yet3 aes, 'ions ant, iaii, was tbat, saiy fie inted stant, Herat Hand lerto 28.

Condition of the Country. —Forty sheep have been plundered from various people in the Chinaran district during the week by robbers of Daulatabad and Isjil. 30. The action taken at Khaf against Afghan robbers continue : during the week a band of 16 who were travelling towards Robat have been pursued by Government sowars. Meshed ; The 11th November 1916. W.

The tribe were first induced to elect a Sardar in succession to Khalil (or Halil) Khan, and their choice fell on Nazir, elder brother of the late Sardar. The lady, w r ho was the favourite wife of the late Hisam-ud-Dauleh, named Jamil-us-Saltaneh, died at Birjand on the 13th November. She belonged to a Tabas family and left no children. She inherited, I understand, nearly all her late husband’s movable property, cash and jewels, and she has bequeathed them to the present Hisam-ud-Dauleh. See Diary No. 44. On the 13th November Basir-us-Saltaneh wired from Tehran to Hisam-ud-Dauleh that he was leaving shortly for Birjand as he had at last been appointed Director over the two Districts. (Note .—I have received confirmation of this news from His Majesty’s Legation just after the close of the week.) See Diary No. 45 . His Majesty’s Minister has telegraphed to me that he is taking steps to have Mirza Ali Akbar Khan prevented if possible from proceeding to Birjand. ( 1 ) The Brigadier of Chakhansur, Ghulam Ahmad Khan, has informed one of my Agents that the Afghan Karguzar in Meshed, Abdullah Khan, who has held his post for very many (? 30) years, is being dismissed by the Amir; also that the Resaldar-Sarhaddar on the Bussian frontier has been dismissed. ( 2 ) Sardar Ata Muhammad Khan of Chahar Burjak was sent off to Kabul in custody about the 5 th November. He is apparently charged with having connived at the recent attacks by Baluch raiders on caravans taking loads from Nushki to Herat. I think it is a fact that he accepted Panchek, as the Sardars of Sistan have so often done. ( 3 ) The new Governor of Chakhansur has ordered the remeasurement of all lands and the revision of revenues. He is taking bribes freely. News from Sarhad.

( 1 ) A spy reports that the two Germans (one perhaps is really a Turk) at Kala Kang have been getting their camel-saddles'overhauled, and that the Afghan soldiers of the guard over them believe that they will again be leaving for the south shortly. A later report (which requires confirmation) says that the Germans have left* for Herat. ( 2 ) Two Indian seditionist prisoners, named Abdul Kadir and Shamsher Singh, were made over to Captain Walker, 28th Light Cavalry, by a Russian escort at Rum on the 18th November. The German Prisoners. Hormuz Kersasp, alias Hasan Ali, and Abdul Aziz, the two Indians who were captured with Lieutenant Voigt, were tried by a military court on the 25th Novem ber and found guilty. The orders of the Government of India are now awaited about them. Afghan Medical Arrangements. The Brigadier of Chakhansur has sent me a message to the effect that an Indian doctor at Herat, whose name I believe is Ahmed Ali, had asked him to get from Sistan a quantity of drugs, the list of which was enclosed. I was obliged to reply that our dispensary could not supply the drugs, but that, if he wished and was ready to pay for them, I would try to procure them from India. The Brigadier has since replied that he did not care whether the doctor got the drugs or not. The people of Chakhansur, of course, are given free access to our dispensary, and our medical officers have, not unfrequently, visited notables and officials in Afghan Sistan at their own houses, when requiring medical or surgical treatment. I do not know whether Dr. Ahmed Ali has ever applied to the Meshed Consulate General for assistance. I believe that he was expelled from the Lahore Medical College probably for taking part in a strike. F. B. PRIDEAUX, Lieut.-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain.*.CONFIDENTIAL. 1 917 J 223 Put away Meshed Diary No. 45, for the week ending the 4th November 1916. 1 . Persian officials. —The late Governor-General, Nasir-ud-Din Mirza, whose recall was mentioned in paragraph 1 of last week’s diary, has finally left for Tehran after a stay of three days in Bagh-i-Gul Khatmi near Meshed where he had halted in hope of reinstatement in his late post. 2 . Mussaddik-i-Diwan, Karguzar of Sarakhs, has been transferred to Darajiz in a similar capacity, and Mudir-us-Sultan, the late Karguzar of Kuchan, has been appointed Persian Consul in Askhabad. 3. Sirdar Makhsus has been reappointed Governor df Turbat-i-HaidarV Khaf and Gunabad. Tun is mot in his district. 4 . Persian affairs. —A dispute has occured between the Rais-ut-Tujjar and the Shrine officials owing to the former having forcibly annexed land belonging to the Shrine. Such complaints against the Rais are not infrequent. 5 . The Meshed townspeople are preparing a petition to present to the Shah in connection wdth Kamran Mirza’s appointment as Governor-General. They urge that he has too many dependents, for the support of whom they will have to pay, and beg that His Majesty will be pleased to appoint some one else and to defer the change until Nauroz, at least as this will be the third Governor-General of Khorassan in one year. 6 . The Minister of the Interior has ordered the re-establishment of the Police force in Nishapur which was abolished a month ago. This is very satisfactory. 7 . The export of grain to foreign lands has been prohibited by the Persian Government. 8 . British affairs. —On November 2 nd Shamshir Singh and Abdul Kadir, Indian seditionists, who had been arrested in Russian territory, arrived from Askhabad under Russian escort and were brought to His Britannic Majesty’s Consulate-General. Arrangements are being made for them to be forwarded to Rum on the 5 th instant, there to be handed over to our own people. Meanwhile they are confined in the Consulate buildings. 9 . A scurrilous article on British policy in Egypt has recently appeared in the Kabul journal “ Siraj-ul-Akhbar” headed “ Endless British lies.” It sketches the supposed history of the British occupation of Egypt according to the ideas of the writer, and dwells on the absurdity of supposing that the Egyptians could have taken pleasure in the recent defeat of the Turks near the Suez Canal after the manner in which they had been treated by the British. 10 . A recent edition of the Meshed paper “ Chamanff reprints an article published in the Russian “ Achaksuz,” which purports to give the true version of a speech lately made by Bethman Holloweg in the Reichstag. It indulges in bitter abuse of the British, pointing out among other crimes committed by what is called the chief enemy the fact that they held back from the war themselves as far as possible, sending Indians and Colonials into the fighting line. The fact of such an article having appeared in a Russian paper is being brought to the notice of the Russian Consul-General, and the Karguzar of Meshed is dealing suitably with the Editor of the “ Chaman ” for having reprinted it. 11 . Russian affairs. —On 1 st instant a communication was received from the Russian Consul-General giving the text of a telegram from his Minister in Tehran describing the recent victory over the Turks in the vicinity of Hamadan. This news has been sent to Herat and generally published for information. 12 . M. Nicolsky is reported to have told Mushar-us-Saltanah that he must remain in Meshed when the new Governor-General cpmes as he (M. Nico s y) cannot work with Kamran Mirza. The Mushar is said to have replied tha e 13. On the 3 rd instant a parade of Russian troops was held in honour of the 14.

Turk asked him to give him quarters in the town as he did not wish to reside near Wagner. This the Naib promised to do, and both he and Barkat have since moved into the Chahar Bagh. It transpires that the Jemadar who escorted these persons from Kabul had orders to take them to the Afghan frontier ; from which it would appear that they will remain in Herat for a few days only. 15 Vide paragraph 22 of last week’s diary. It is now reported that the three Austrians who had quitted Kabul with this party were arrested four stages out and taken back to Kabul. Kazim Beg is said to have been respomible for this Which, if true, gives further evidence of his growing distrust of the German and Austrian element in Afghanistan. ^ 16. It is now stated definitely that Kazim Beg has with him two servants named Haji Ahmad (a Turk) and Nur Muhammad (a Persian). 17. On 27th October Kazim Beg received a letter from Rajah Pertab announcing his safe arrival at Takht-i-Pul near Mazar-i-Sharif. 18. Vide paragraph 10 of last week’s diary. Three more Turkoman chiefs have arrived in Herat and are staying at the Chahar Bagh. Naib-ul-Hukumti has ordered that certain Turkomans who came to Gulran from Turkestan may be given land on condition that they do not return to Russian territory nor hold any communication with their former homes m future. 19. It appears that the export of loaf sugar from Russian^ Turkestan to Afghanistan has been prohibited, and a heavy rise in the price is expected m consequence. 20. News from Karez.—During the week nothing of importance has occurred. The British Agent has arranged with certain tribesmen towatch the frontier i n his neighbourhood for the arrival of members of the German Mission and has appointed a secret agent of his own to watch the Kam road at Kal-i-Sang for the same purpose. ^ , 21. Condition of the Further trouble from Zushki robbers is reported, this time from Jagharq, the summer residence of this Consulate-General. Muhammad Zabih-ullah, the robber chief, peremptorily ordered the village headman to pav Tumans 200 and failing to receive more than Tumans 50 demanded a rifle, threatening the village with attack in case the demand was not complied with. Our good offices have been asked for and an appeal is being made on behalf of the villagers to Mushar-us-Saltanah. 22 The rouble has greatly decreased in value during the past few days and a consequent lull in the Nishapur cotton market is causing some anxiety. 23 A disturbance is reported from Daulatabad, a village in Chinaran district, which was attacked by Shikari robbers. Two villagers were killed in the defence which seems to have been successful. This and other similar events are attributed to advantage taken by thieves of the change of Government. 24. Arrangements are being made to refer the case of Rr.is-ut-Tujjar and Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, mentioned in paragraph 27 of last week’s diary, to th« local courts of justice. 25. In agreeable contrast to the events above reported is an account of active measures taken at Khaf against a band of Afghan outlaws. Three have been arrested and the remainder forced to disperse and escape in different directions across the frontier. 26. Robbers recently attacked the Passport frontier post at Bolan at night and carried off Tumans 500 in cash with all the personal effects of the Passport Officer whom they wounded. No arrests have yet been made. 27. A raid upon Ibrahimabad in Tabas district has been committed by robbers of the Farsi tribes. They are encouraged by the insufficiency of Government sowars, called Karasuran. Meshed, 4th November 1916. W. G.

Hutchinson, Political Agent, Chagai and Sarhad, and T. Keyes, Political Officer, Mekran Mission, assisted General Tanner in the settlement. Major Keyes is going on to Gusht where he will negotiate the settlement with the Gamshadzais. I hear that the Governor of Chakhansur has written to Kabul that it is impossible for his German guests to break through our cordon. He has proposed that they should return to Herat or Kandahar.

I hear that Malik Muhammad Sanjarani, the murderer, was being taken to Kandahar from Chakhansur. At Alaili he was assisted by Nazar Khan Reki to escape.

I hear from Duroh that the Afghans who came into conflict with Lieutenant Wahl’s and Lieutenant Crossfield s parties travelled up the border as far as Asparan, about 35 miles north of Bandan, and thence to Anardarra. The Afghans, who were 17 in number, told the people of Aspaian that they had lost three men killed and one taken prisoner, three of them veie wounded. They said that they all were natives of Ghazni. Captain Blackwell has just enlisted 50 Bahluli nomads experimentally in the Infantry contingent with the Hazaras. He reports that they seem good material.

No report has been rendered of the number of Russians wounded in the previous operations but the death of one man from wounds received on that occasion is reported. 29. Russian appointment.—In view of the distance of Astrabad' from General T nmoov’s headquarters at Meshed the command of the Russian force in the Astra- Wl region has been entrusted to Major-General Yolkovnikov. I am informed that this officer had been on the retired list previous to his appointment. o 0 Emdemic —There is unfortunately this amount of foundation to the sorts’of death and sickness among the rifle company quartered at Shahrud that Jweaths of three men from malaria have been officially reported during the week. These men who belong to a Siberian reserve formation are, according to Persian statements, exceedingly young and it is to be feared tfcat no great degree of effi ciency can be expected under adverse sanitary conditions. 11 Dismissal of Governor-General. — Nasr-ud-Din Mirza, Governor-General nf Khorasan and Sistan, has been relieved of his appointment and yeturns to Tehran ®*« Mazandaran shortly.

Persian officials—The Governor-General, Nasir-uH^nTMirza, has been recalled and is to be succeeded by Kamran Mirza, Naib-us-Saltaneh. He leaves on th&gt; 30th for Tehran, and Mushar-us-Saltaneh is to carry on the current work until the arrival of Kamran. Certain officials are somewhat apprehensive m regard to their chances of remaining in office, notably the Mutawalli Bashi and Aojd-ws- Saltaneh, the Peshkar-i-Maliyah, who seem to think that the ^ew Governor- General will arrange to absorb their duties. The former has enlisted the services of Agha Zada, chief local Mujtahid, m his behalf, who has telegraphed to Tehran, and the latter has arranged with the local democrat committee to support him m case a crisis arises. 2. Muazid-ul-Wazara, the new Rais-i-Tazkarah, has arrived in Meshed. Ha visited this Consulate-General on the 27th instant. 3 .

Three men oi the Kharaoti tribe from Ghazni have been sent in to the Naib-ul-Hulcumah by the Governor of Anar Darrah with two rifles. They appear to have escaned from the conflict reported in Sistan Diary No. 40 of 30th September. On the 20 th instant Wagner, having heard of these arrivals, asked to see the rifles, which were duly sent to him for inspection. 14. Wagner has found a stone of some interest (possibly inscribed) m the rums of the Herat Musalla (place of prayer). He has had it cut and packed m a box, and is practising the conveyance of the box on two mules, much as a takht-i-rawan is carried. It is supposed that he hopes to remove it as a curiosity. 15. The Naib-ul-Hukumah is shewing great regard for mullahs in these days. He visits them constantly, and it is believed that the question of jihad is being discussed. 16. Saiyid Mustafa has been spreading false news during the week regarding the supposed successes of Turkish troops in Persia. These have duly been contradicted. 17. Sardar Abdul Majid Khan, Governor of Shabar Ghan, having been summoned to Kabul on account of some mistake he had made, fled to Russian territory. His two servants came to Herat with three horses, and the Naib Solar has imprisoned the men and sent the horses to the Government stables. 18. On the 17th instant the Naib Salar was heard to say that he had given up the idea of taking leave at present: that this was a time for holy war and not for taking leave of absence. Saiyid Mustafa is also said to have recommended a land-owner not to sell his grain at this moment as it would be much more valuable in a month’s time. This is understood to mean that the country would be involved in war before long. 19. The messenger referred to in paragraph 11 of last week’s diary is still in Herat: he is said to be awaiting orders from Kabul. 20 . Saiyid Mustafa visited Wagner on the 19th instant notwithstanding that he had been forbidden to leave' his quarters. 21 . Strict orders have been issued by the Naib-us-Saltaneh to the local government to exercise special vigilance in regard to spies, and it is believed that frequent efforts are being made from outside to discover the actual state of affairs in Afghanistan. 22 . On 21 st instant the Turk Kazim Beg, Maulvi Barkatullah, and two servants, escorted by a jemadar and 22 men of the Risalah, with their baggage loaded on 22 Government ponies, reached Herat. The servants’ names are Haji Ali and Nur Muhammad. The party has been accommodated in the Bagh-i-Kartah. It was at first reported that three Austrians also accompanied them, but this, is now contradicted. Pertab Singh is not with them. He is said to have separated from his friends at Daraj Kul and to have proceeded via Takhta Pul to Turkestan ; and that he will then enter Russia in disguise. A telegram confirming this was received in Meshed yesterday. Kazim Beg is apparently preparing to leave Herat very shortly. 23. Wagner had a bad fall from his horse on 20th instant and injured his head. He seems to have since been confined to his bed. 24. News from Karez. —The British agent seized two German magazine rifles in the house of Ismail Jamshidi at Takiabad on the 18th instant. Arrangements are being made for their disposal, which will be subsequently reported.25. A selected person has been posted by the British Agent in each village of Turbat-i-Jam District to watch for suspicions arrivals, and Russian Cossacks have been withdrawn from Abbasabad, Karat, and Khaf and posted in Langar, Karez-i- Nau, and Kariman, ten in each place. 26. Three Austrians, escaped prisoners from Samarkand, have been arrested by. sowars of Shaji-us-Saltaneh, the Taimuri chief, and brought to Turbat via Mahmudabad on 20 th instant. They are being forwarded to Meshed. These are perhaps the men referred to in paragraph 22 above. 27. Condition of the Country. —Referring to paragraph 13 of Diary No. 42, no conflict has as yet taken place between the Government troops and Muhammad Ibrahim Khan’s men at Kasimabad. The latter appear to be prepared to fight to the end and the former are shewing signs of pusillanimity. Meanwhile Adal- ud-Dowleh, the Governor of Kuchan, is trying to effect a peaceful solution of the affair. 28. Zushki robbers have committed still further raids in the hills of Chinaran District. It is presumed that the local authorities are in league with them. 29. A murder, apparently for purposes of plunder, has taken place outside the town of Muhammadabad. Police enquiry is proceeding.

K nj 5 i 9 1 e Meshed Diary No. 42, for the weeYendiHg the'T4th October 1916. 1 Persian officials. —Muhakkak-ud-Dowleh, the new Karguzar of Meshed, arrived on the afternoon of Tuesday, the 10 th instant. He visited this Consulate- General on the 13th. 2. Muazzid-ul-Mamalik, Chief Passport Officer at Meshed, has been dismissed and Muazzid-ul-Wazara appointed in his place. The latter has left Tehran to take up his post. 3 . Ithisam-ul-Mulk, Karguzar of Birjand and Kainat, has been transferred to Sabzawar, and Nabil-ud-Dowleh, Karguzar of Sabzawar, will succeed him. 4 . A rumour has been current during the week that the Governor-General is shortly to be dismissed and that he will be relieved by Kawam-us-Sultaneh, brother of the Prime Minister. 5 . Shuia-ul-Ayaleh has been appointed Bais-i-Ijra (Executive Officer) in place of Shahzada Ala-us-Sultan dismissed. The latter has left for Tehran. 6 . Persian affairs. — Vide paragraph 2 of last week’s report. Shaukat-ud- Dowleh has been re-arrested by the Governor-General in consequence of the receip of orders from Tehran. He is said to have been advised by the local authorities to offer money to the Prime Minister. 7 . The Mutawali Bashi having received a bribe from a Shrine official defendant in a dispute with a townsman, and appearingjlisposed to settle the case m the defendant’s favour in consequence, the complainant, arrayed m a shroud and ho d- ; n2 a copy of the Kuran in his hand, came to MwjtaM Agha Zada m an excited state, asking either that the latter would kill him or do Him justice. This seems to be a new method or demanding attention. 8 . In the course of a congratulatory Id visit paid by the Attache of the Consulate-General to the Governor-General on Monday, 9 th instant, His Excellen y complained of the treatment he is receiving from the Prime Minister. He said th 7 for instance, the latter would not put up funds for the payment of more than an SS number of police, requiring him to pay f^.f^—hudXwkh fs pocket He added that apparently some one, probably Naiyir-ud-JJoule , . intriguing against him in Tehran, and that he will be obliged to resign if the British LuthSes win not support him. The Attache promised to refer his remarks. 9 The Rais-i-Adaliyah has been obliged to complain to Tehran against the action of the Governor-General in having 0 P e y d yy o y* °9y^ t \f abol ° hment order to increase his Mudakhilah. The complaint has resulted m the abolishment of the court mentioned. The Rais has himself opened the courts, one in the upper a “ d °“ e “ ^ portion of the main street in Meshed known as the Khaiban. This is a convenient arrangement. 10. Russian affairs.-Vide diary of 30 th September More seizu^ ingots emanating Born Russian territory have been m ^;. been deported to Russia in connection with their importatio 11. M. Kal, the Second Secretary to the Russian Consulate-General, has proceeded to Russia on one month’s leave. cotton stuffs is prohibited. _ . 13. With reference to paragraph 4 are coming! Khan, the late Governor'of Shirwan, on j^ ear n t&gt; . b te Farhad Khan, wired to the Russian Consul-General that he, wi^ his subordinate rm ^ .2 thousand persons of their tribe if he would arrange to give them some land. &lt; It appears that the troops are really sent to support the Rais-u - against Ibrahim Khan and Farhad Khan, who were plundering his property and that the Rais has also asked help from the Sardar of Bujnurd, who has sent 80 sowars. 14. Referring to the report of a theft in the Russian chancery in the diary of September 30th the Rais-i-Nazmiah, during a visit paid to him by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General on the 12 th, complained bitterly against the Governor-General for having called upon him to make good the value of the property stolen, some 800 tumans. He remarked that there ought to be a special govern ment fund for the purpose of such restitutions, and that m any case it was most unfair to ask him to pay who had only held office for a few days. He added that the real thieves appear to have been Russian Cossacks, two of whom were actually sleeping at the door of the room in which the alleged theft took p ace. The Rais-i-Nazmiah also mentioned that M. de Beauvais, First Secretary of the Russian-Consulate-General, had found a Cossack in his room the previous night who could give no satisfactory reason for his presence there. 15. Persian and German Intrigues. —The local democrats have held no secret meetings for some 15 days, but about ten persons, some of whom aie preachers, have newly joined their committee. 16. News from Kariz.—N caravan of 67 camels bearing wool and spices, the property of Haji Behbud Herati, and Haji Hussain Ali Kandahari, a British subject, arrived on the 4 th instant en route to Meshed. 17. Kurban Ali Khan, the Afghan Rais-i-Maliyah of Farah, with eight servants, arrived en route to Meshed on pilgrimage on the 6 th instant. 18. Three hundred Barbaris were observed on the 8 th instant to be proceeding in the Muhsinabad direction by an unauthorised route. The British agent informed M. Papov at once, fearing that they might have some German agents or papers among them, but the Russian agent was unable to search them on the spot. He, however, wrote to Turbat-i-Jam directing them to be searched there, and the British agent also sent information to our news-writer at Turbat-i-Jam. It is probable that these Barbaris merely took an unauthorised route in order to avoid paying the usual passport fees. 19. News from Herat. —The Naib-ul-Hukumah has issued strict orders to the Governor of Kuhsan to search carefully all caravans going to Meshed, with a view to prevent the exportations of sugar and specie. 20 . On the night of the 1 st instant a band of robbers attacked some shepherds who were encamped with their flocks close to the town. The shepherds beat off their assailants with a loss of two killed and four wounded and the Naib-ul-Hukumah, on hearing of the occurrence, sent out medical assistance with an armed party. 21 . With reference to paragraph 18 of last week’s diary, the Naib-ul-Hukumah has ordered the Governor of Gulran to send the headman of the Russian Turkomans to him for enquiry as to their business etcetera. 22 . About 1,000 Barbaris have arrived during the past week en route to Meshed for pilgrimage. They are being provided with rahdaris here. 23. Wagner has recently been heard to remark that the preparations for his journey are now complete but that he hesitates to set out on account of fear lest his enemies should catch him and take the valuable papers which are in his charge. His servants say that all is ready and that they are expecting orders to leave at any moment. 24. Wagner visited the Naib-ul-Hukumah on the 30th and remained with him for about two hours. It is not known what passed at the interview. 25. Following upon an altercation which took place in the bazar between one of his servants and an Afghan sepoy, Wagner is said to have told his men invariably to ride in the bazar and not to heed the protests Afghan people might make against their speed or careless riding ; that the Afghans are a mean-spirited race, as they hael invited Germans to their country to lead their troops against Russia and thendeclined to fulfill their part of the contract; and that in consequence of their timidity the German Mission had been forced to disperse. 26. The Naib Solar sent a risalah sowar to Saiyid Mustapha Arab on the 2 nd instant to escort him to the frontier with orders to leave Afghanistan. Saiyid Mustapha replied that he was ill and unfit to travel; and it has been arranged for him to be inspected daily by the local Indian doctor, Hospital Assistant Muham mad Ali, who will report on his condition. 27. A messenger who had been sent with a communication from Germans in Kabul to Tehran has returned with a reply. The subject of the correspondence has not yet trahspired. 28. Wagner has spread reports during the past few days that Turkish troops have reached Nishapur and are on the point of entering Meshed which has been evacuated by the Hussians. 29. Wagner requested the Naib-ul-Hukumah on the 5th instant to provide him with a guide and to give the necessary orders for facilities for him to cross the frontier. The Naib-ul-Hukumah has promised to reply later. 30. The Austrian Bayerl, with his servant Saiyid Eiza, two horses and a mule, left Herat with necessary orders for the Governor of Anar Durrah and Chakhansur to allow them to cross the frontier. The British agent has instructed an employe to watch their proceedings and report the route taken. 31. The German party in Herat now consists of the following persons : — “ Captain ” Wagner, Miazu (an Austrian ?), Hinder (an Austrian), Kranzah (an Austrian), Bawidross (an Austrian), France (cook) (an Austrian), with servants : — Nasr-ul-Lah Khan, Tehrani, . Muhammad, Arab, Abbas Ali, Isfahani, Agha Karim, Isfahani, Kaka, Shirazi, and five Barbaris and Heratis as grooms. Wagner’s description is given as: — Middle-sized, round face, reddish cheeks, no beard, moustache thin and yellow, fair-haired, small green eyes. 32. Condition of the country.—$ ms robbers attacked a village near Tabas. Imad-ul-Mumalik with a force engaged them and 25 men were killed or wounded in the encounter. The incident has spread a panic in the neighbourhood. 33 . Sharf, one of the Darajiz Begs, has been murdered while en route for Killah Reza Kuli, it is believed, by the relatives of Muhammad Husain Beg whose life he had taken. 34 . Fourteen camels belonging to one Meshedi flahlul, part of a caravan which was carrying wheat from Sangher to Gurmab, were carried off by a gang of robbers across the Russian border. The matter has been referred by the Karguzar of Sarakhs to the Pristov of Russian Sarakhs. Meshed ; ' W. G.

Persian officials. —Mushar-us-Saltaneh and the Mutr.wali Bashi are said to be intriguing against the Governor-General and to be trying for Shua-us-Saltaneh, one of his brothers, to be appointed in his plane. 35 . Persian affairs. — Vide paragraph 2 of Diary No. 41. Shaukat-ud-Dowleh has been re-arrested by telegraphic orders from the Prime Minister who directs that he being a murderer can only be released on payment of 8,000 tumans. Of these 4,000 are to go to the Prime Minister and the remainder to the local Govern ment for payment to the heirs. The arrangement already made is therefore cancelled, but the criminal is not in a position to pay this new sum. 3 . British affairs. —Shuja-ud-Dowleh is imprisoned in the Ark or citadel by order of the Prime Minister in connection with the claim of the Imperial Bank of Persia against him. The Minister has ordered a list of all Shuja’s property to be made out and sent to him by the Karguzar. There appears to be a prospect of some substantial payment being made at an early date. 4 . Secret. — X cypher telegram has been received from Tehran by the Karguzar in which he is directed to make careful enquiry regarding fortifications which are said to be in course of erection by British officials in Seistan. A report is to be furnished as soon as possible. 5 . Russian affairs.—{Secret.) M. Nikolski, Russian Consul-General has sug gested to the Karguzar that the Persian Government might now give him the 8 hir Khurshid medal of the first class as it is many years since he received that of the second class. The Karguzar is said to have applied to the Government for the decoration accordingly. 6 . Vide paragraph 14 of Diary No. 42. The Rais-i-Nazmiah eventually paid compensation from his own pocket to the amount of 200 tumans and has ordered six of the town Commissaries to pay 600 moie between them thus making up the 800 required. The Rais has visited M. Nikolski in connection with this affair and protested against being made to pay for a crime committed by Russian Cossacks. The Russian Consul-General replied that he could not take up the case against his countrymen. This charge made by the Rais appears to have come to the ears Russian military authorities, who blame M. Nikolski for having listened to it. The incident is unfortunate as in addition to the possible injustice involved it has tended to increase the want of harmony which already exists m the Russian community. 7 . Efforts are being made to obtain through M. Nikolski the reinstatement of Mirza Saiyid Reza, the late Karguzar of Bujnurd. This man is the uncle of the late Karguzar of Meshed and is said also to have connived at the escape and concealment of German and Austrian prisoners. 8 . Persian and Genmn ^r^.-Malik-ush-Shura, a democrat who was deported to Buinurd some time since at the instance of both Consulates-Geneia), having become ill there obtained permission from Tehran to return to Meshed an has just arrived. His movements will be carefully watched. 9 Herat news -The Afghan Frontier officer at Chihil Dhukhtaran has reported do the S-ui Hukumah tfat the Russians intend to compel^^ refugees residing in their territory to return to A g is not given. 10 Several Turkoman families of Panjdeh and the neighbourhood are applying to be domiciled in Afghan territory giving out that the Russians are oppre^smg them and threatening to force their men to enter military serviee. The ul-Hukumah to whom the applications were made has not yet replied to them. 11. With reference to paragraph 27 of hist weekV; 'kyy messenger to Tehran from Kabul was sent by the Naib-us-Saltanah (Aasiullah ;;; : 13 ■,; 6 with ' v onElC ^ T SECRETARY’S i 1 . *83 m 1Khan) to enquire whether the German and Turkish agents now in Kabul had been s 3 nt by their Governments or were there merely on their own responsibility. 12 . The Naib-ul-Hukun ah and the Naib Balar visited Wagner on the 6 th instant. On coming out of the house the Naib-ul-Hukumah oidered the Jemadar commanding the guard to erect winter quarters for himself and his men near the gate, from which it seems that Wagner’s departure may ^ve b een ] ostprn d. During this visit various papers were inspected sc me of which the messenger had brought from Tehran while others were produced by Wagner himself. 13. Vide paragraph 30 of last week’s diary. The employe mentioned returned to Herat on the 7 th instant reporting that Bayerl and Saiyid Reza had proceeded via Robat-i-Mir Dad towards the locality specified. 14. Wagner sent two letters to the Naib-ul-Hukumah on the 7th requesting that they be forwarded to Kabul by his private dak. One was addressed to the Naib-us-Saltanah and the other to a doctor whose name is not known. 15 The people of Ghor are reported to have declined to supply men for service in the local corps of Sappers and Miners. It is also said that the inhabitants of Pusht Rud, a village in Farah district, are discontented and have refused to pav revenue. In Sabsawar also a dispute has arisen in connection with the payment of duty on wool, and it is believed that the employment of military force will be neces sary for its collection. 16. It is stated that a force consisting of one company of infantry from the new Herat regiment, one squadron of cavalry and four muzzle loading mountain guns, is about to be sent to Ghor. Two guns are also to be despatched to Killa-i-iSau, two to Ghurian and two to Sabsawar ; and ammunition to the Chakhansur frontier. 17. Some German agents are reported to be coming to Herat from^ Kahul shortly. It is believed that Rajah Pertab Singh, Karamatullah, and Kazim Beg are referred to here. 18. News fvofYi Kariz. —On the 10 th instant the British agent \isited Haji Shuja-ul-Mulk, the Governor. The latter is arranging to effect a meeting with certain Afghan and Persian officials with a view to take measures to reduce thieving and snuggling on the Perso-Afghan front er. His idea is to disperse the Afghan settlers on both sides of the boandary and to comp A them to live further from it. ( Vide paragraph 14 of Diary No. 41.) 19. Thirty-two Cossacks proceeding to Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam from Khaf, Karat, and Abbasabad, have passed through Kariz during the past few days. 20 . Vide Diary No. 33 , dated 12 th August last. Mir Baqi Sultan has now written to the Afghan authorities from Gak offering to reside in Afghanistan, and has received a reply that he would be treated like other refugees. Nothing seems to have come of the advances made previously by him to the Russian Consul-General here. 21 . Saiyid Ahmad, arms smuggler, has been arrested by our agent on his return from Herat and is now in custody. His disposal will be reported later. 22 . Condition of the Country. —Zushki robbers have been active in the neigh bourhood of Chinaran during the week. No steps have as yet been taken to deal with them. W. G.

See last week’s Diary entry, item No. ( 2 ). Two spies have come in from Kala Kang with rather discrepant stories of the Germans now in Afghan Sistan. One says that they have marched along the whole border from Boundary Pillar No. 90 opposite Bandan to Tarakku, considering the best point at which to cross into Persia • while the other says that they have been to Rudbar and that he believes that they will try to reach Sarhad by crossing the Saindak-Mashki Chah road near Bortdiar. An ez-Thanedar of Chagai Levies, formerly stationed at Mashki Chah butnow living near Chahar Burjak on the Helmand, named Sher Jan Sinjeram, has given the Afghan authorities an undertaking that he will safely conduct the Germans Is far as Bampur. It is said that an escort of 15 Afghan camel sowars will accom pany the party. The Deputy Governor, Sistan. See Diary No. 39 . The quarrel between the Deputy Governor and the Karguzar has resulted temporarily in the victory of the latter, who has exu taut y shown me a telegram from a friend of his in the Foreign Ministry at Tehran announcing that Rukn-ul-Wizara was being recalled as the result of his representa tions. I have begged His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran to get this order rescinded, if possible. The Sistan Field Force. I am informed that Brigadier-General Tanner was to leave Saindak on 16th October, reaching Khwash on 19th and returning to Saindak on 28th. I hope that he will be able to pay Sistan a visit early in November. The Customs Department, Sistan. The Director of Customs, Sistan, has gone to Koh Malik Siah to enquire into charges brought by the British Trade Agent and the other Persian officials of th place against the local Customs Director.

I hear that a third German of some importance has joined the other two at Chahar Burjak. The two spies’ stories, mentioned last week, may therefore relate to the move ments of two different parties. * I think that the 1 st German arrival must be Bayerl, alias Chaush, who probably is accompanied by his interpreter Saiyid Reza. ( 2 ) I understand that Lieutenant-Colonel Dale left Khwash for Sistan on the 21 st October. He is to be president of the Military Court which will try Hormuz Kersasp alias Hasan Ali, and Abdul Aziz. The Deputy Governor, Sistan. See last week’s Diary. On the 24th instant the Deputy Governor received a telegram from Ilad-us-Sultanah, an assistant in the Foreign Ministry, telling him that he was to be retained in office here. I hear that the Karguzar has been trying to get Sartip Muhammad Reza Khan, now styled Hashmat-ul-Mulk, reappointed to the office. It has also transpired that Basir-us-Saltaneh, the late Finance Agent in Sistan, promised Hisam-ud-Dauleh to get Rukn-ul-W izara removed, and Mirza Reza Khan, late Finance Agent in Birjand, appointed Deputy Governor of Sistan in his place. Basir-us-Sultanah recently telegraphed to Hisam-ud-Daulak asking for 300 tomans on receipt of which, he said, the desired arrangements would be carried into effect. The Governor seems, however, to have become sceptical, as he showed the telegram to Major Heron ana declared that he was in no way privy to the plot. Possibly he fears that his brother Sartip Muhammad Reza has a better chance of getting the appointment than his own nominee. The Provincial Fiance Director. A telegram has been received by the Acting Finance Agent in Sistan announcing that in revenue matters Birjand and Sistan are separated, and that Mubashshar-ul-Mulk has been appointed Director m Kainat. It appears from this that Basir-us-Sultanah is not coming, and Major Heron has been informed by Hisam-ud-Daulah that the reason is that the Persian Government would not make him Provincial Director over two districts. I have received a second telegram from Ebtehaj-us-Sultan asking me to sup port his candidature for the appointment. Shaukat-ul-Mulk. See Diary No. 38. His Majesty’s Minister has informed me that Hisam-ud- Daulah’s story about Shaukat-ul-Mulk having prepared to ]om the Turks is untrue. He had in fact made preparations to fly to Barfarush. I am surp to hear also from Tehran that the Russian Minister Las actolly suppo a proposal of the Minister for Foreign Affairs tha . offended the sent back to Birjand as Governor. Perhaps Hisam-ud-Daulah La s offended the Russians owing to his dilatoriness in settling the Russian Bank s claim agai .s father’s estate. F. B. PRIDEAUX, Lieut.-Colonel, H. B.

Sistan and Kain Consulate Diary No. 45, for the week ending the 4Ih November 1916. German Emissaries. A spy has reported that the Germans on the Helmand have come down to the Shela and sent scouts out to discover what point is the safest at which they can issue from Afghanistan. A later report states that the Germans have returned to Kala Kang. The German Prisoners. The Director, Criminal Intelligence Department, Simla, has suggested that Abdul Aziz is Basant Singh, the leader of the Indians sent by Germany to Baghdad. The prisoner Jan Muhammad now declares that his real name is Chet Singh. He was born in Berozepore District and not in German East Africa as was formerly stated. He was a prisoner at Euhleben, and entered German service in order to gain his freedom. Muhammad Yunis, who states that his real name is Shuja-ullah, and Muhammad Hussain say that they were given £100 by Raja Partap Singh out of simple charity to enable them to escape from the country and return to India ! These two men have been recognised by a clerk in the Consulate, who was a student contemporaneously with them in Lahore about four years ago, and who remembers their mysterious disappearance when, as now transpires, they went off into Afghanistan. The Customs Department, Sistan. See last week’sDiary. The Director of Customs has returned from Koh Malik Siah. He has reported to Meshed that the complaints against ms subordinate are well-founded and has recommended the man’s recall to Meshed. Russian Affairs. M. de Bravine, the Vice-Consul, has left Birjand for Meshed, taking all the Consulate archives with him. He has also discharged his Mtmshi Basin, an old man, who might have been superannuated with advantage perhaps ear le .

F. B. PRIDEAUX, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain.SECRET. Intelligence Summary for the week ending the 14th October 1916. Khorasan and North-East Persia. 11 . Russian troops. —The Russian Military Agent corrects his information of the preceding week. The number of machine guns with the force is 10 , not 12 , 4 being at Astrabad and not 6 as previously stated. 12 . Indian prisoner. —I have received a reply from Ahwaz stating that the prisoner Saiyid Ali Asghar had actually deserted from the Supply Depot there. I am arranging to send him down under Russian escort for delivery to our cordon on the first favourable opportunity. 13. Arms smuggling. —Four Baluchis with 8 smuggled rifles from-Meshed were arrested by the Persian Customs at Pul-i-Khatun. These were part of a consign ment of 20 or 30 rifles that they had ordered, and were probably destined for the Sarakhs Turkomans. Although no large number can be obtained from here, the persistence shewn in obtaining the few available points to the unsettled frame of mind of these Turkomans. Herat and Afghanistan. 14 . Germans and their adherents. —I have received a telegraphic summary from Simla of the cypher which we captured on Mirza Agha. It is addressed to “Tupfer,” signed “ K. Hein ” under date of 6 th August, and deals chiefly with the difficulties experienced on the Chinese frontier owing to the Russians watching the roads. From it it is apparent that the German who proceeded in that direction is Hentig, and not as I had imagined Reyer. The arrival of the Austrian Bayerl at Herat on the 5 th August is reported. Mirza Agha was sent to Transcaspia some two weeks ago. I have suggested to the Russian Military Agent that the Transcaspian authorities might be able to elicit from him the German intermediaries at Tehran and he is communicating with Askhabad on the subject. News received from Herat this week points to the proximate flight of the German party there. Bayerl, accompanied by a servant named Saiyid Riza who is described as a small, exceedingly dark man, actually left Herat on the 7th instant bv the Kandahar road. He was provided with letters for the Governors of Anardarra and Chakansur to permit his crossing the frontier in proximity to these points. It is possible that this may be intended as a blind but all concerned have been informed. Wagner is reported to have asked the for a guide to the frontier S and for instructions to frontier officials as to his crossing it '''‘thout hindrance. There lis further mention of the information collected by the German Mission having been entrusted to him for conveyance so that capture is specially important. In the last 24 hours two persons have been reported to me here as answering to his description . Orders were given by the Naib-ul-Hukumat for the deportation across the frontier of the German Agent Saiyid Mustafa, but he evaded their execution on the plea of serious illness, I instructed the British newswriter to procure a complete list of the German party remaining at Herat, which he gives as follows .

Military. —An order was issued from Herat some weeks ago that one man per 50 of the Taimani tribe should be enlisted as sappers, sarwans, and saises for the transport. The Governor of Barsi has sent in 60 men but no others have as yet complied with the order. An agent at Kabul reports that 13 mountainguns left the capital on the 23rd September for Mazar-i-Sharif. Russian Turkistan. 16. Transcas'pia. — General Kalmakov, the acting Governor, has visited various Turkoman centres and reports that his speeches were received with loyal hurrahs. On the other hand rumours of the disaffected attitude of the Sarakhs Turkomans in particular come to hand from native sources, and more than one fracas over the enlisting of the Turkoman guards is stated to have occurred. I General Kuropatkin recently arrived at Askhabad on a tour of inspection. According to the papers a considerable quantity of flour is being smuggled to Afghanistan from Yolatan and its neighbourhood. 17. Military labourers.—The first party of labourers in rear of the armies, 1,040 strong, left Tashkent for Orenburg on the 1 st instant. Everything possible is now being done to popularise the movement and the departure was accom panied by considerable ceremony, General Kuropatkin and other high officials being present. Relations were allowed at the departure platform, and a special tele gram was sent from Kazalinsk for publication in the press to the effect that all were well. The parties are being organised in bodies of 1,000 workmen under a native commandant with subordinate officers, interpreters, 3 mirzas, and cooks, who together make up the add 40. 18. Disorders in Semirechia. —I note for the first time in the Turkistan News of the 4th October the first direct account of the Kirghiz revolt. Merke and the Chu valley are said to be the centre of the Syr Darya Kirghiz bands which are apparently being dealt with satisfactorily by troops. Much disorder occurred between the 13th and 18th September in the Prjevalsk district, the town itself and a few other places alone escaping pillage. The Issyk Kul monasterv was plundered but the monks succeeded in escaping. Troops were converging on Prjevalsk and also against the rebels in the hills near Tokmak and Naryn. Militia were approaching Sergiopol from the direction of Semipalatinsk, followed bv a Cossack regiment and a battery. A second Cossack regiment was moving on Pishpek from Aulieata. It is thus apparent that a number cf troops, even if of reserve formations, are likely to be locked up for some time on this task. 19. Turkistan officials. —General Madritov succeeds General Galkin as Military Governor of Syr Darya. Since the arrival of General Kuropatkin a regular holocaust of officials high and low has ensued. Besides Generals Galkin and Gippius already mentioned, General Geppener, Assistant Governor cf Syr Darya, has been deprived of his post, the Chiefs of Police of the Russian and native portions of Tashkent, the Chief of Police of Samarkand, a number of Police Pristavs several high and various subordinate Russian civil officials, and a host of native office holders have been dismissed. General Kuropatkin has published a strong order against briberv extortion and kindred offences among members of the Russian administration.'^ ? It is probable that a certain tension prevails among Transcaspian officials at the present time. 20 . Railways.—The Bokharan (Kaghan-Termez) line has been included in the regular sytem of Russian railways as regards passenger and goods traffic. E. A. F.

Engagement with Turkomans. —Between the 5th a'nd the 10th instant the portion of the 1 detachment under General Loginov, quartered in and near Astrabad, were under the command of Colonel Gabaev, somewhat sharply engaged with a considerable body of Turkomans, most of whom appear to have belonged to the Goklan section. On the 5th October Cossack patrols north of Astrabad on the Karasu stream were fired on from cover by Turkomans, the strength of whom was estimated at about 300. In the first exchange of shots two Cossacks were wounded,' and subsequently two dead Turkomans were found on the spot. Beinforcements of all arms quickly arrived on the scene and a position commanding the crossing of the stream was occupied. This was subsequently attacked by about 2,000 Turkomans who were beaten off, it was presumed with considerable loss, and who retired to Ak Kala on the Gurgan River which they occupied. The Russian force, having with them the battery of four field guns and four maxims, attacked the Turkomans on the 15th instant in this position and completely routed them, the Turkomans fleeing towards the Caspian. The Russians occupied Ak Kala, but at any rate the majority of the force has since returned to Astrabad. On the Russian side a rifleman and a Cossack were killed, but the number of wounded has not been reported. The Turkomans were believed to have suffered severely from the machine-gun and artillery fire, but as they were successful in removing their casualties no estimate of their loss is to hand. Colonel Gabaev believes that sufficient punishment was inflicted to deter the Turkomans from further aggressive action. His opinion is not, however, shared by the Russian staff here. 22 . Frontier affairs. —The Perso-Russian frontier in the vicinity of Pul-i- Khatun and Sarakhs is in an unsettled condition, frequent raids of cattle and looting of caravans on a small scale occurring. The Baluchis who were grazing their flocks within Russian territory in this neighbourhood have returned to Persia. 23 Escaped prisoner. —An agent whom I had posted near Xorabad arrived m great indignation a few days ago. He had discovered an Austrian, apparently an escaped prisoner from Russian territory, and either a doctor or posing as one, wandering among the frontier Baluchis. He has induced this man to accompany him to his village with the intention of seizing him there and bringing him to Meshed when he encountered a Cossack patrol of four men who took the prisoner from him. I see no reason to doubt this man s statement, but the Russian Military Agent has hitherto received no report of the Austrian s capture. Yuldash Khoia ato Saiyid Yunis, who had been brought here by the Russians for conveyance to Transcaspia, escaped a few days ago from their lock-up but was recaptured the same evening by the Persian police and handed over to the Russians. 24. Reported epidemic. —Arrivals from Shahrud report that several of the Rus sian soldiers there have died from some epidemic disease and that a number are sick. As the staff here have received no confirmation it is to be hoped that it is, like most Persian reports, untrue. Herat and Afghanistan. 25 Germans and their adherents.—Reports received confirm the departure of Bayerl towards Chakansur. Wagner is apparently hesitating at departure, possibly on account of intelligence received from a messenger who recently arrived from Tehran, and possibly on account of the risk of capture of the information reputed to have been entrusted to him. 26. Afghan troops.—It is again reported that khassadars have been orderedfrom frontier posts to Herat for training, but no mention is made of this by the Heiat news-writer.2 subject to subsequent confirmation. I have received telegraphic information from India that mountain guns together with a large convoy of ammunition have left Kabul at the beginning of the month for Herat, some of the ammunition being destined for Maimana. These are presumably the guns and stores of which tl ere has been talk at Herat mr some months and to escort which a detachment of soldiers was sent to Kabul some two months ago. The people of Ghor are reported to have raised objections to furnishing recruits for the Sappers and Miners. 27. Transcaspia .—General Kuropatkin after inspecting Askhabad travelled to Krasnovodsk, and was returning without again stopping at Askhabad. He was reported to be about to inspect the Turkoman guards collected from the Sarakhs Turkomans. The fir st party of these guards from the Askhabad District left Askhabad on the 14th instant, “The district furnished 2 , 2 C 0 men of whom 600 were selected by lo j for guarding the railway (apparently the C. A. line). The local paper cannot be accused of undue enthusiasm as it states that “ the disposition of our Turkomans, at any rate, is fairly good.” About 500 men have been collected at Pul-i-Khatun and another and probably more numerous contingent at Sarakhs. Two Kussian solders have been found killed near Tejend and their death is attributed to Turkomans. 28. Disorders .—Eighteen natives of the Toi Tiyube Division of the Tashkent District have been tried in connection with the recent disorders. Ten were acquitted and eight sentenced to death. The troops are apparently gradually restoring order in Semirechia ; many of the malcontents are attempting to escape into Chinese territory and they are said to be short of all provisions except meat. Nevertheless travelling is still risky, until some 200 persons are collected when they are escorted along the post-road by a sotnya of Cossacks. The papers dealing with events in that region during the latter part of Septem ber repoit frequent Kirghiz attacks on small settlements which defended themselves and in some cases were rescued by troops. On one occasion it was decided to remove the inhabitants to a place of safety, but the Kirghiz subjected the fugitives to a fusillade from the heights, and in crossing a swift stream, the bridge over which had been destroyed by the rebels eleven women and children were reported to have been drowned.

' ! 916 Meshed Diary No. 40, lor the \^eek ending September 1916. Persian officials. —Adal-ud-Daula has appointed Farjulla Khan as his Naib- ul-Hukumat for Shirwan. The appointmentis a popnalr one as the people had asked for him as Deputy Governor. Farjulla is said to be a respectable man and it is to be hoped that his presence will restore some measure of tranquillity to the district. Nabil-ud-Daula, Karguzar of Sabzawar, called on me yesterday before return ing to his post. He is a relative of Mushar-us-Saltana and I am informed that the latter has sent a cypher telegram to the Minister for Foreign Affairs at Tehran asking him to arrange an exchange between the Karguzars of Sabzawar and Birjand. Musaddak-ud-Daula has requested an inerview with me. M. Nikolski informs me that before leaving Tehran he had paid the Governor-General Tumans 1,000 for the post of Rais-i-Nazmia here, and that this explains the difficulties which Salar Nusrat suffered at the hands of the Governor-General. The latter has not done so badly out of the deal, as Salar Nusrat paid Tumans 800 to retain the post which he has now been obliged to vacate. I am told that the new incumbent is an expert at anthropometry and modern detective methods. He is, however, sufficiently conservative to have summoned his subordinates and informed them that he had paid Tumans 1,000 for the post and borrowed another thousand to live on in the meantime, and that he expected from their zeal that he would be reimbursed in record time. Persian affairs .—Raza Khan, the Governor of Daragez, and his cousin, Zabardast Khan, have been quarrelling and it was expected that the tranquillity of the district would suffer in consequence, but from later reports they appear to have made up the difference. The Governor-General recently had a telegraphic interview with the Prime Minister. He requested, inter aha/that the pay cf military sowars, which has been withheld since Nauruz, be disbursed without delay, that the reduction of the Meshed police force to half its strength should be countermanded, as also the abolition of a police establishment at Daragez, Nishapur, and Tursffiz and that the Maliyat be ordered to disburse pay punctually and to recover full rates tor revenue grain. The question of the police establishment is an urgent one. The establishment of 240 men for a city of the size of Meshed is far from excessive and half the number would prove totally inadequate. The abolition of all police m the other three towns mentioned, will hardly conduce to the security of life and property. There has been a disquieting number of robberies m Meshed, several of them m the Argor European quarter, and because the police force is manifestly inefficient as it stanas, it is open to doubt whether the halving of its numbers pan be regarded as a panacea. 1 hope that it will be found possible to induce the Persian Government to leav ' things as they are. A force of 50 sowars, 40 sarhaz, and 20 artillerymen with a gun, left for Shirwan two days ago, apparently with the object of repressing the activities of larhad Khan and Khadu. British affairs— Lieutenant-Colonel Grey left Askhabad on the 28th October and his arrival here is expected on the 2nd October, for which date arrangements for his reception are in progress. The produce of Shuja-ud-Daula’s land is being sold at Kuchan and handed over to the Agent of the Imperial Bank, from whom a report is awaited ^e actuaUaie of land, in fulfilment of the Bank’s claim presents the di cu y I I)U r C hasi. have come forward with the exception of Dabir-us-Su an, w o i n j at a low rate and pay by instalments-an ideal arrangement for ^ P“V . ^ the meantime Mushar-us-Saltana is attempting to recover r , pehalf of proceeds of the estate during the last two years when it was attached on behalf the bank.

The Sabzawar Karguzar has his men were fired upon, fortunteiy ™ n( ? ut 1 en . ec 1 b -^ f}ip a OV ernor-Genera 1 been posted in the matter and action will also be taken with the Governor Genera Russian affairs.—The Chancery of the Russian fl®”^\7om tn hTn methods of the Rars-i-Nazmia have been baffled by the foot-prints left by the marauders. Several seizures of gold ingots, apparently emanating from Russian territory, have blen made lately. Ghe Customs ^arrestedsome men outside he to Wr , in nossession of ingots weighing m all about 15 lbs., others were rouna on Turkomaiis whose capture led to the search of ^e^f a jadrd in which quite a number were discovered. Their origin is so far a myst y. Russian Cossacks have confiscated 27 rifles from Barbaris at Kariz-i-Nau. The Russian railway engineers have now proceeded to Astrabad in their automobile. By this time they appear to have fairly thoroughly investigated the north of Khorasan as well as part of the Kanz district. The Pristav of Russian Sarakhs, escorted by Cossacks, was recently fired on bv a band of some 60 Turkomans who subsequently decamped. .No casualties appear to have been caused on either side. This is very probably a sequel of the military labour recruitment. According to the papers, the Turkomans conscripted for this purpose are, as a special privilege gained by the gallant conduct of the Turkoman Cavalry Regiment, to be employed as armed railway, forest, and other guards, and not as manual labourers. General Kuropatkin has treated the deputies of Tashkent to some very plain speaking, addressing himself particularly to the native representatives. He pointed out that for some 50 years Russians and natives had lived on excellent terms side by side and that the latter had prospered very materially under Russian rule. At a time like the present all were bound to make sacrifices for Isar and country but the native population of Turkistan had so far had no call made upon them. They were now asked, not to fight but to release Russians engaged m indispensable work in rear of the armies, to take their place in the ranks Ihis was the Tsar’s will and it would be carried out at all costs. It remained for the natives to shew by their attitude whether they stood with their Tsar or m the camp of his enemies. Not only would any persons who engaged m disorders such as had taken place at Jizak suffer severe personal punishment, but the land in such places would be confiscated. The question of the confiscation of some 2,000 desyatin in the Jizak district was already receiving his consideration. Natives engaged in such work will receive free rations and a ruble per day in addition. No specific accounts of the Kirghiz disturbances in Semirechia have come to hand, but they appear to have been sufficiently serious even if sporadic. Russian lives have been lost. The Tsar has published an ukase calling out the Semirechia Cossack Militia for internal defence, and Siberian troops appear to have been sent into the region. It is rumoured that a robbery has taken place at the Russian Bank at Meshed, but the matter is being kept quiet and no details have yet been received. The field battery, three companies of infantry, some sappers and maxims (number not specified) and upwards of a hundred men for the “ m ^unted scouts,” the whole under the command of Colonel Gabaev, have reached Astrabad. At present they are in considerable difficulties for want of Persian currency for supplies. Some cheery optimist sent the scouts without horses, which should be Bought on the spot, and Colonel Gabaev can only find a limited number, for which Rubles 600 a head is asked.Persian and German intrigues. —After a third and very peremptory telegram from General Loginov, the four Indian prisoners were despatched on the 23rd instant to Rum where they will be taken over by our troops. I shall be glad to hear that they have been safely received. The protocol from Turbat-i-Haidari has only just been received and contains colourless statements giving us no further information than we had already received from Kariz. A petition put in by Muhammad Yunis has been forwarded and has been transmitted to me by the Military Agent (copy enclosed*). On seeing the milk-and- * Appsn ix. water effusion from the “ Servant of Humanity ” I at once suspected that it was not the original document seen by the British Agent concerning which such secrecy had been observed, and the reply to a telegram to the Agent converts the doubt to a certainty. I do not think that the original has been sent here at all. So much for M. Mikhailov ! Some letter-sr in the vernacular, found on the prisoners at Kariz over a month ago, have just reached me through the Military Agent. They do not appear from a cursory inspection to contain anything of importance, but I am having them carefully examined. Haji Karam has been handed over to the Russians and, together with Mirza Agha and the Austrian brought in by our man to Kariz, has left for Askhabad. The latter, whose name is Yosh, professes to know no German and there is no one here capable of coping with him in Hungarian or the unidentified dialect which he speaks. When Chaush fled from Shabash he left a saddle-bag behind and a kind of diary, which it contained, has been brought to me by one of my men. As it appears to be in Hungarian I have sent it to Askhabad where Colonel Tsvietkov can supervise the translation and give us the earliest news of its contents. I am informed that the former Meshed Kargumr, Muazzaz-ud-Daula, who is now without employment at Tehran, has written to some of his friends here to assist in the escape of Austrian prisoners from Russian territory. He is stated to be intimate with ’ Arfa-us-Saltana, the personal assistant to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. A fresh list of some of the more energetic local democrats includes the names of five preachers of some influence. Munshi Nizam has been warned by the Deputy Governor-General to leave the neighbourhood of Meshed ; otherwise he will be arrested by the Russians, have not yet heard of his departure. Two German subjects — Herald, manager of Stucken and Co., and Krause, a small shopkeeper — have been ordered by the Russian military authorities to leave the country. They have been here since the beginning of the war. lire Austrian dentist Rohrlich has been permitted to remain. News from Ka,riz.—M: Popov, the Russian Agent, is recovering and has been visited by^M. Lemanski, Russian Agent at Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. Yuldash Khoja has now been identified with Saiyid Yunis of whom frequent mention has been made in these diaries but concerning whom itt e is ac ua y known. He is being despatched under escort to Meshed. The action taken by the Russian and British Consulates-General, with regard to the deposition of the M’amur and the recall of Shajji-us-&gt;. a tana, ave resu e in the latter’s being left at his post. News from. Herat.—Wagner has been taking photographs of the troops and isiting Saiyid Mustafa. The latter was placed under a guard and not permitted o visit the Bagh-i-Karta. Afga/n guards have been ordered to give Wagner the alute to which his rank of Captain entitles him. Both he and his servants have &gt;een industrioifkly spreading the rumour that 500 German sowars wi s or 7 re , derat from Persia. He has caused the overhaul of his pack-saddles and seen to the •ondition of his animals’ shoes. His servants also have laid in long coats such as ire worn by nomad tribes.G. M.

Two men namely Mirza Muhammad Ah and Sardar Shamsher «k«h were sent by Raja Mohmdra Partap to the Russian Government to make some dink matic relations They were received there with great honour and respect The Governor-General, Tashkand, made all possible arrangements for their con venience and comfort. The papers they carried were fully studied by His Majesty’s Government and it was promised that satisfactory answers with men will be sent to Raja at Kabul. Beth Mirza Muhammad Ali and Sardar Shamsher Singh were stayed at hotel as State guests. Motor car and carriage were fixed for their excursion. Mirza Muhammad Ali is my brother and is a meat friend of the Russian Governor and a Russian General at Tirmiz. Since three months they might have returned. I am Mirza Muhammad Ah’s brother and if the Governor-General comes to know of me he will certainly do me a great kindness. I am going through Persia seeing the big cities of Meshed and Tehran, etc,, for the sake of pleasure. I have no letter or paper with me but an address of some people in Turkey for my introduction. I have a great fondness for doctorship and I have a mind not to return back until the completion of my studies. There have been sent two other men to Tashkand as Raja’s men who would speak something to Russian Government on behalf of Raja. One of them is the same Sardar Shamsher Singh and the other Shaikh Abdul Kaclir. I hope that they both would be at Tashkand or they might have left it and have returned back to Afghanistan. We people belong to that class of mankind who wish for peace everywhere and for the fulfilment of this purpose we are making efforts. We have no bad motive, but we w i s h progress and prosperity. For this purpose we are representing our selves to big men in Russia, Turkey, etc. We are not criminals but we are the well-wishers of Humanity. Turkey, Russia, Afghanistan, Germany all mmt make a general brotherhood and with all big states make bucly relations that there may not remain a little suspicion for any future trouble which may deva state the whole world. We are not making against any Government but we are trying for their stability on a very firm of Humanity. Our body of men may be known as “ Servant of Humanity:’ We are not the servants of anybody but servants of God and His people. If the Germans are in Afghanistan here are some English also. It must not be imagined that in spite of His Ma es y Amir’s neutrality any Afghan subject be doing something which may be hostile X to Russian or Lgllh Government are^y more than ality but servants of Humanity. (Sd.) MUHAMMAD TUNIS KHAN. Meshed ; *) Dated the 30th September 1916. j Received from Russian Military Agent. E. A. F. REDL, Lieutenant-ColonelCONFIDENTIAL. Meshed Diary No. 41, lor the week ending the 7th October 1916. 1. Persian officials. —Muhakkak-ud-Daulah has notified by telegram to the Mushar-us-Saltaneh his appointment to be Karguzar at Meshed. 2 . Shaukat-ud-Daulah, the murderer of Nasrat-ul-Mulk, has been released on a security of 4,000 tumans which Haji Husain Agha will pay in case Shaukat fails to do so. It is announced that this money will be distributed among the heirs of the deceased. 3. Trouble is said to have arisen between the Karguzars of Meshed and Sistan owing to the latter’s claim that he is not the subordinate of the former but is under the direct control of Tehran. He has neglected to answer certain queries from Meshed regarding a certain raid of Afghans upon the people of Chakansur. 4. Persian affairs. — Vide Diary No. 40. It has been said that the troops sent to Shirwan are designed to recover revenue money which had been stolen by the attendants of Ibrahim Khan, the late Governor of Shirwan. 5 . The recent Municipal elections have resulted in the election of 16 commis sioners of whom Haji Muhammad Jafar Kashmiri, the head of the local democrats, is one. 6 . The Wazir-i-Maliyah has telegraphed to the MaliyaJi Peshkar in Meshed directing him not to recover the annual duty of 2,000 tumans on the Nishapur turquoise mines during the war, owing to the export of these turquoises to Europe being suspended. British affairs. —^Lieutenant-Colonel Grey arrived at Meshed on the 2 nd instant and assumed charge on the 3rd of the office of Agent to the Government of India and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General. The usual arrangements for reception were made, all Government Departments bein grepresented. The Russian Consulate-General sent out a representative and the Russian military authorities provided a band .and guard-of-honour at the place of rendezvous. The usual official visits have been made and returned during the week. 8. Secret.- —Ghulam Raza Khan, head munshi of the Karguzari, after an un successful attempt to induce the Mushar-vs-Saltanah, to telegraph to the Foreign Minister information that Barbaris were being recruited here for the 106th Pioneers, telegraphed to this effect on his own account. The Mushar is much annoyed. Ghulam Raza is known to have anti-British and Russian sympathies, and his movements are being carefully watched. 9 . Notwithstanding the fact that urgent instructions had been issued to the local Government by the Ministry for Foreign affairs for the settlement of the case of the Imperial Bank versus Shuja-ud-Dowleh, the Minister of the Interior has now ordered the Governor-General to confiscate the Tchalsa lands in his possession and to recover the price of produce which he has received during the past two years. This is receiving attention. 10 . Russian affairs. —Fourteen Turkomans, Russian subjects, came recently to the mill at Tajik and demanded supplies. The local Naib-ul-Hukumah ordered the villagers to offer armed resistance until the arrival of sowa^rs to their assistance, but the sowars refused to move without extra pay. 11 . Vide last week’s diary. It appears that a plan which had been made to rob the Russian Bank was frustrated before accomplishment. 12. Herold, the manager of Stucken and Company whose deportation by the Russian military authorities was reported last week, has on reconsideration been allowed to remain. 13. Secret. —The Mushar-us- Sultanah has sent a cypher telegram to the Persian Foreign Minister asking him to refer to iashkent the question of therelease of certain persons, and Gunabad, who were including the Post Master and Naib Karguzar of deported to Russia as prisoners some time since. Tun 14 News from Kariz.—On 27th ultimo Mirza Abdul Husain Khan, Customs Inspector ^withHai i Mahmud Herati and the British agent, visited the Afghan frontierTn connection with a report that smuggling was to take place Nothing was dTscovered, but the Inspector remarked that on return to Meshed he intended to suggest that Afghans located on the Persian side of the frontier should be compelled to reside further inland where they could not assist the smugglers. 15. The Russian agent at Turbat-i-Jam has arrived to spend a few days i n M psVi pd . 16. News from Herat.—The towns-people of Herat have written to the Amir thanking His Majesty for the appointment of the Naib-ul-Hukumah and the Naib- Salar whom they wished to have. A gracious reply was received which gave much pleasure to the recipients. 17 A Panjah-bashi with some khassadars who had been sent to Ghor or to collect revenue', have been ordered to return to Herat, where they are to be enlisted in the Kandhar Battalion. 18. The Governor of Gulran has reported to the Naib-ul-Hukumah the arrival at Gulran of a number of Russian Turkomans who are detained there pending receipt of orders for their disposal. 19. Orders have been issued from Kabul to enlarge caravanserais the Kandahar road. Brick-makers are to hand but bricks are not yet ready. 20. The Naib-ul-Hukumah is reported to have remarked that he regretted to hear that the Turks had advanced recently in Persia ; that it was not advisable that the Turkish dominions should adjoin those of Afghanistan ; and that the independence of Persia was advisable for Afghanistan. 21. The other of the two sick Austrians mentioned in last week’s diary also recovered but was ordered by Wagner to ride and again became ill in consequence of his exertions. 22 . Wanger seems to be busily engaged in packing his effects. He has had five strong boxes made by a local carpenter to replace his old ones. He has taken photographs of the Jama Masjid and the various barracks during the past few days. This and other similar rumours suggest that the report in Diary No. 39 regard ing the entrustmen^ to him of the survey work is not without foundation. 23. Saiyid Mustafa Arab is reported to be ill. He has received a letter from an unknown writer in Meshed which was sent out with the post of Abdullah Khan the Afghan agent. 24. Wagner’s servants have spread information to the effect that their master has received a letter stating that the Turks have occupied Tehran where the Sultan of Turkey’s son has arrived. 1 25. Wagner’s servants have also announced the receipt by their master of a letter from another German officer who had been to Bokhara and Samarkand with a Mir of Takhtah Pul in Turkestan to incite the Turkomans to rise against the Russians, saying that he had succeeded in his mission. 26. The account of the expenses incurred in connection with the Ilbaigi Kaudani has been made up. It amounts to Krans 96,000, and the Naib-ul- Hukumah has sent it to Kabul, being displeased at its excessive total. 27. Condition of the Country. —Rioting is reported from Nishapur where the inhabitants are said to be sadly in want of police. A fight among the servants of Naiyar-ud-Dowleh resulted in the death of two men before it was quelled by the Governor’s sowars. 28. Zushki robbers have raided the village of Chahish, eight miles from Meshed, and carried off money and sheep. A party of Afghans under the robber chief Muhammad Sharif plundered some cattle from Rabat Kamai in Khaf district, andG. M. Press, Simla —No s C569 F.D.— 7-11-16—29—M-D. the village of Sanghan. Also Agha Jan, the late MubasHr of villages, while passing through the pass Dahanayi Daroongar near Darajez with some sowars, came into conflict with road guards. A fight ensued in which one man was killed and one wounded. A local disturbance has also taken place at Turshiz. These reports all point to the extreme inadvisability of reducing the police forces.

Captain Wise, Sistan Levy Corps, with his two troops, arrived at Sistan from Dashtak. See last week’s diary. On the evening of the 4th October the party of gun runners appeared in the Bandan Bud near the Gardan Shutar pass. Lieutenant Crossfield engaged them with his detachment from Bandan, but the Afghans got away over the hills and succeeded in crossing the frontier during the night. Major Hawley reached Tabasain from Aliabad at midnight, and got to Chah Hamza at day break. He however saw nothing of the Afghans. A patrol of Levy Camel Soivars, sent out from Sistan, picked up the trail of the Afghans at Karbasu, 50 miles west of Labi Baring, on the 6 th October and followed it to Tabasain, proving that the party had proceeded by zigzag tracks to two miles south of Madeh Karez, and thence, avoiding all water-holes in the march of 30 miles, northwards to Gardan Shutar pass. An empty water-skin and some cartridges were found on their road by the Levies. Colonel C. 0. 0. Tanner reached Saindak on the 5th October, relieving Brigadier-General Dyer, who left for India the same day. The Indian prisoners coming from Turbat-i-Haidari—Jan Muhammad, Muhammad \ r unis and Muhammad Hussain, with Muhammad, son of Fateh Muhammad, Sindhi of Larkana who escaped from this Consulate last March— reached Birjand on the 2nd October.

( 1 ) The Indian prisoners from Turbat-i-Haidari left Birjand for Shuspon 10 th October in the charge of Lieutenant T. V. Brenan, Sistan Levy Corps. From Shusp to Bandan they will be brought on by Captain Blackwell, and from Bandan to Sistan by Captain E. H. Brenan. The last-named officer left Sistan for Bandan on 14th October. ( 2 ) On 1 st October, a spy from Kala Kang reported that he had seen two German subjects there. The new Governor had sent for Sardar Ata Muhammad Khan and ordered him to arrange for the safe departure of the Germans out of Afghanistan. The Sardar had taken the two men to Chahar Burjak whence, it was believed, he would forward them after the Id (October 9). The spy was sent back to Chahar Burjak ; he has not sent in any further news yet. The Birjand Karguzar. The Karguzar of Meshed has order the Karguzar of Birj and, Itisam-ul-Mulk to proceed to Sabzawar on relief by Nabi-ud-Dauleh. The Birjand Karguzar has, appealed to me, through his Sistan colleague, to assist him in getting the orders cancelled on the ground that his sons are also employed in Birjand, and that one of them is under Major Heron’s treatment. Persian officials seem to assume that they can always rely on our overlooking their acts of unfriendliness, whether out of generosity or simple blindness, I cannot sa y- Itisam-ul-Mulk came down to Birjand in June 1914 having been turned out of his appointment at Sarakhs by the Russians. Last year he gave me no help in the conversations with Shaukat-ul-Mulk regarding the German mission, and after the late Governor’s departure he has consistently sided with the enemies of Hisam-ud- Dauleh. I have therefore told Motasim-us-Saltaneh that I see no reason for inter fering on his behalf. Itisam-ul-Mulk will have an uncomfortable time at Sabzawar, I imagine, as the ^ Russian consular service possess good memories for enemies as well as friends. The Provincial Finance Director. I have received a telegram from Ebtehaj-us-Sultan, who left Sistan on 6 th October 1915, asking me not to oppose his candidature for the vacant appointment here. We used to find this official very unaccommodating, and I do not think that he would make our labours in feeding the troops any easier. I was therefore glad to be able to reply that it was useless for him to apply for the post as Basir-us-Saltaneh was coming back. F. B.

M. Lemanski, Russian Agent at Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam, (a decaved Polish gentleman formerly employed m the Russian Bank and subsequently tutor to the son of the Sardar of Bujnurd) visited me yesterday and confirmed my suspicions that these two seditiomsts had put up a strong bluff which was nearly successful in securing their release by M. Popov, the Russian Agent at Kariz. The fact that two of their party—now detained at Termez on a second visit—were received with all honour by General Marson, the late Governor- General of Turkistan, presented a letter inscribed on a gold plate addressed to the Tsar and were ceremoniously reconducted to the Afghan frontier, could hardly fail to influence subordinate officials ignorant of the, actual facts. 3 . About a week ago I arrested a suspicious Indian on the outskirts of Meshed. After relating various improbable experiences he eventually confessed to being Saiyid Ali Asghar of Naya Bazar, Bhagalpur, employed with the Supply Column 6 th Cavalry Brigade at Basra and transferred to Supply Depot, Ahwaz, whence ’ he deserted. He writes excellent English. I have so far received ~ ‘ reply to a telegraphic enquiry addressed to Ahwaz. no 4 . The vernacular letters written by the prisoners Muhammad Hussain and Muhammad Tunis are addressed to friends at Herat requesting them to intercede with the Afghan authorities for their release. They include a petition from Muhammad Sindhi to me adducing his voluntary surrender as a proof of good intentions. (Reference Meshed Diary No. 40.) 5 . Herat and Afghanistan. —The British Agent at Herat sends the following military information:— (a) A farman has been received from Muin-us-Saltana ordering the utmost despatch in the completion of the strength of artillery horsesdo 2 , 000 , the sale of Government ponies, and the despatch to Kabul of all Government donkeys except 100 . On receipt of this order the Naib-ul-Hukumat directed Murad Khan, the official in charge of the stables, to sell the ponies and to purchase mules in lieu without delay. (b) Orders have been issued for all guns to be taken to the Arsenal in turn for overhaul and repair. At the time of writing the maxim battery was in the hands of the arsenal artificers. (c) Two mountain guns are to be on parade daily for instruction of gunners. Apparently drill, not firing practice, is implied. (d) 2,800 kharwars of forage to be obtained in land instead of the revenue tax and from Government lands, and to be stored in the Government godowns at Herat. This does not affect the order for the normal storage of fodder at sarais on roads. (e) The pay of the men of the Herat Signalling Class has been raised from PtS. Kabuli 12 per mensem to Rs. 14, with the idea of popularising the military service. I fr I in6 . An agent at Kabul writes to me under date of 13th September that 43 mountain guns in the capital have been made ready for despatch to outside stations but that they had not yet been sent oh. 7. Russian Turkistan. —With the exception of Semirechia, Turkistan and Transcaspia seem to be free from disorder at present. Troops w ere sent to Semirechia from Tashkent as well as from Siberia. An official order ordering all natives of Turkistan to shew respect to officers and officials has now been rescinded except in the case of the Semirechian province. The degree of outward politeness and subservience is thus apparently a kind of barometrical record of political feeling —the greater the sans gene the more peaceful the condition of the district. 8. General Kuropatkin has made a tour of the principal towns of Ferghana. He received the Amir of Bukhara at Tashkent on the return of the latter from Yalta. General Galkin has handed over his functions of Military Governor of Syr Darya and left the province for Russia. 9. The Turkoman Khansha Gul Jamal personally presented General Kuropatkin with 10,000 rubles subscribed by the Turkomans of Transcaspia towards Russia’s aerial fleet. None the less many rumours of Turkoman discontent are still rife. 10. It is rumoured at Herat that the German officer who was reported to have escaped from Afghanistan into Russian territory has written from Bokhara saying that his work — which is to stir up the Turkomans against the Russians—is pro gressing favourably. I have again brought this to the notice of the local Russian military and political authorities, as there is reasonable ground to believe that at least one of the Germans (more probably Hentig but possibly Niedermayer) successfully made his way to Bokhara. From the first, however, the Russians were not hopeful of laying hands on any one who had entered their domain. Meshed ; ) E. A. F.

Meshed Diary No. 39, for the week ending the 23rd September 19(6. Persian Officials. Shuja-us-Saltana has been appointed Governor of TurshiV In common with his brothers, the Rais-i-Kushun and the Governor of TnrW.t Haidari, he is a democrat. T he resignation of Salar Nusrat from the post of is now a accompli and Musaddak-ud-Daula has been appointed in his place The Russian Consul-General withdrew his objection to the latter’s appointment at the instance of Mushar-us-Saltana. The Governor-General sent a report of an unfavourable nature to Salar Nusrat to Tehran in which he apparently accused him of being the tool of the Russians and English. This came to the ears of the Salar who thereupon considered that it was time to quit. I have little doubt that his real cause of offence was his refusal to make mudaldial for the powers that be. He has been of the greatest assistance to us during his tenure and I hope that the fact will be borne in mind should a question of a further appointment for him arise. Agha Mirza Ismail Khan is appointed Rais-i-Maliyat at Meshed in the place of Mustaufi-ul-Mulk who is transferred to Kariz Taiyabat. Shahzada Muhammad Ali Mirza, Rais-i-Maliyat at Sabzawar is dismissed and Agha Moaz-ud-Din appoint ed in his place. The above changes have been carried out under orders from Tehran. Persian Affairs. —Mushar-us-Saltana called on me in connection with Shaji- us-Saltana’s recall. He stated that the report of the latter’s beating the second mamur almost to death, of which he had informed us last week, had proved to be untrue, but that Shaji had assembled 300 of his tufangchis and threatened the mamur with them. He represented that such gross disrespect to the Governor- General’s authority could not be passed over and hoped that I should raise no objec tion to Shaji’s recall. I replied that if the facts were fully substantiated no other course but his dismissal would be open, much as it was to be regretted from the point of view of the tranquillity of the province and of our operations. I have just received, however, from General Loginov a declaration signed by the mamur in question and countersigned by the Russian Agent at Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam that the mamur was perfectly satisfied with Shaji-us-Sultana’s conduct to him which had been all that could be desired. The Russian Consul-General has been furnished with a similar copy. The Attache has now gone to interview the Deputy Governor on the subject. • I am informed that the authorities hope to recover Tumans 10,000 from Shaji over this matter and while the total seems most improbable it is quite likely that he will be required to contribute to the good cause. The present regime has the disadvantage that three persons have to be provided for, the Governor-General, his father-indaw the Farash Bashi, and the Deputy Governor-General. The Minister for Foreign Affairs telegraphs in cypher to Mushar-us-Saltana to verify the states of the military establishment, to ascertain what percentage of the troops is really effective and to check the numbers of men reported under going treatment in hospital. He asks for a detailed list of all persons in military employ. The maliyat have been notified to honour Mushar-us-Saltana’s cheques for mamurs employed. He has also requested the Karguzar to furnish a list of all Russian cotton firms in Khorasan. The Wazir-i-Maliyat has directed that the present establishment of sonars of the department should be curtailed from 250 to 100, of whom 50 will be employed in the districts.

An agent who has just returned after imprisonment in Afghanistan was cross ing from Termez to Afghanistan on about the 15th May. 'While he was on the haul/ three Indians, one a Hindu and two Muhammadans, arrived escorted with all honour by the Governor and the Pristav. The Governor made his fare wells on the Russian side and the Pristav accompanied them to the Afghan bank where Afghan officials received them. The Indians’ servants informed the agent that they vmre a mission from Afghanistan who had been in Russia for about two months and were now returning to Kabul. The agent subsequently ascertained that the party had been the guests of Muhammad Usman Khan, Naib-ul-Hvhjtmat of Mazar-i-Sharif, and had been forwarded on their way to Kabul with all despatch. The statement eventually made by Haji Karam is enclosed.* From the circumstances set forth it is evident that he * Vide Appendix . has no recent information of the Germans’ movements. The democrats here are holding frequent meetings. Their numbers have been recruited by arrivals from Tehran, Haji Rmad-uz-Zakrin, vauza hhwan and preacher being one of them.

He also confiscated their money but afterwards restored it, giving each man an additional 10 krans. He asked Shuja- ud-Daula that 1,000 krans might be paid to them as they were to go to Rahul In company with Shuja-ud-Daula he visited the Governor and expressed his gratitude to the mehmandar, who then handed the Governor all papers relating o the Germans with which he was entrusted. Shuja-ud-Daula subsequently left or Kabul with an escort and 100 camel-loads of baggage. Wagner rode some distance with him and presented him with a horse and a magazine rifle. He also sola him four other horses, and suitably rewarded the followers who were returning to kabu .

F. REDL, Lieut.-Colonel, G.S.O., His Britannic Majesty's Officiating Consul-General and Agent for the Government of India in Khorasan.APPENDIX I. Karez, 17th August 1916. Sm, With due respect we beg to state that we are from amongst the same people, two of whom were sent to Tashkent by Eaja Mahendra Partap a few months ago! These people’s names were Mirza Muhammad Ali and Sardar Shamsher Singh. They had an envelope with them which contained greetings engraved on a gold plate to His Most Imperial Majesty the Czar. These messengers had another letter to the Governor-General in Tashkent begging him to send these messengers to your Government. The object of this mission was that a friendship may be cemented between Russia, Afghanistan and India. In his messages Raja Sahib wished to be invited to Russia to settle affairs with the Russian Government. These messengers returned with very hopeful answers. They were very much honoured by the Russian Government in Tashkent. They were treated as state guests. A promise was given to them that a man would be sent to Kabul with answers to all the questions they had put. In fact illness of one of Raja Sahib’s messengers obliged them to return soon. No sooner had this message reached Kabul, that a man from Russia would come to Kabul, orders were given by the Afghan Government that when this honoured messenger of the Russian Govern ment reaches the Afghan territory he may be treated with due honour and respect, and immediately conveyed to Kabul. Now Sir, as it may be known to you these negotiations have begun. Up to the present moment they have been kept quite secret by your Government and by ours, hence it is indispensable in your interests and in ours that these things may now also be kept quite secret from all other Governments while at present friendly to you or not. Up to the present time Afghans have their political relations only with the English. And what Government does not wish to extend its relations ? Raja Mahendra Pratap insisted upon the Afghan Government to establish relations with its august neighbour. The Afghan Government asked him to make efforts for this noble cause. Consequently Raja Sahib sent the above mentioned gentle men, Mirza Muhammad and Sardar Shamsher Singh for bringing into fact a material relation beween Russia, Afghanistan and India. They came back very hopeful and another couple is now sent to Tashkent, which must have reached there up to the present time. These gentlemen’s names are Izzat Mund Shaikh Abdul Kadir, B.A., and Sardar Shamsher Singh. Now see these negotiations have set forth, and Raja Sahib who has been to Turkey and knows the inner thought of its official circle, and wishes for the amalga mation of Turkey in this alliance. He is sure that Turkey would certainly accept his proposal in this matter. Russia and Afghanistan can prove of unlimited value to India and it is in the interest of these two Kingdoms too that they may be friends with India. Now as Raja Sahib knows that Turkey would be willing to join this alliance he has sent us as his messengers to Turkey to impress upon the Turkish Government the necessity of establishing friendly relations with Russia and thus complying with his efforts that he is making now in the Ear East. At the moment of our depature he was sure of a complete success from the Turkish point of view. Now, Sir, our stoppage in Persia is causing a fatal delay in this holy mission, hence we hope our matters would be settled as soon as possible aiid we com eye very soon to the Turkish soil 5 iall tliat no other Government, whether at present al y } formed of' any of these things. We beg to remain, Sir, Your most obedient Servants, MOHAMMAD HUSSAIN, AND MOHAMMED TUNIS.

I am a native of Baghdad, which I left about two years ago to escape being forced to serve in the army. I came to Kermanshah, where I later took service with the German Mission and become groom to the armourer (Friedrich). The Germans there at that time were Niedermeyer, Vogt, Wagner, Chaush, Friedrich, “ Zainal Bey ” (Seiler), Fasting, an Austrian “ minister,” a doctor (Niedermeyer) and another German whose name I do not know. At Kirmanshah Niedermeyer divided his band into two parties. The first which he accompanied to Tehran, included himself, Vogt, Wagner, Chaush, the Austrian and the German whose name I do not know. The second party, with which I was detailed, comprised Friedrich, Seiler, Dr. Niedermeyer, Fasting, and proceeded direct to Isfahan. Paschen joined us after we had been at Isfahan for some time. We had about 100 sowars there. Niedermeyer divided the parties for Afghanistan as follows :—- 1 st party, Paschen and Wagner with some 30 sowars who went ahead. 2nd party, 2 German officers who left towards Kirman. 3rd party, Niedermeyer, Vogt, and Chaush followed the first. Friedrich, Fasting, Dr. Niedermeyer, and Seiler remained at Isfahan, where the latter was German Consul. My services were transferred from Friedrich to Chaush. When we reached Bushruyeh we found Paschen and Wagner there as the Russian troops had taken their baggage. We halted for some days and then continuing by desert routes eventually reached Afghanistan safely. We marched at night and halted by day. I cannot remember the names of the places we passed, but the foilowing are some of them. Nain, Anarak, Chahar Deh (near Tabas), Bush ruyeh, and Yazdan. We were accommodated in a garden at Herat for some two weeks while the Governor reported to the Amir and then left for Kabul with an escort of 30 or 40 Afghan sowars. We reached Kabul after 23 days and were lodged in the Bagh-i-Babar. For two weeks no one was allowed to go out nor any people to come to us but after that time the officers went out riding escorted by sowars. (Paschen went back to Persia from Herat and never joined us at Kabul.) Chaush had died on the way to Kabul and I then served Niedermeyer as groom. After some three weeks at Kabul the Persian grooms intrigued against me and the Germans believed them when I was accused of theft and caused me to be imprisoned at Sherpur. I was still in prison when they left. Niedermeyer gave me a cheque* on Baghdad treasury for £ 6 , two months wages, and fined me my \\ ages foi foui months. On my release from jail I was brought before Muin-us-Saltana who ordered my denortation As I was penniless some Turkish officers (Mahmud Sami, Commander, Afghan troops, Nasif Effendi, employed at Military School, and Ah Efiendi also employed in schools) subscribed £5* As I was sick on entering Persia and lay with my face covered I escaped notice. *]S[ote. £3 in English gold found on prisoner. The cheque on Baghdad he gave to a companion who denies receipt of it at present. E. A. F. REDL, Lieut.-Col., Meshed ; 21st September 1916. 7 C536 F.D.— 25-10-16—28—M.D. G. S. 0. G. M. Press, Simla.—No.CONFIDENTIAL. j 5377 1916 j Meshed Diary No. 38, for the week ending the 16th September 1916. Persian Shaukat-nl-Mamalik, Governor of Turshiz, who had been ill at Meshed for some time, died on the 12 th instant. A general post among the Karguzars in the north of the province has taken place. Madir-us-Sultan has been transferred from Kuchan to Sarakhs, Mirza Mehdi Khan from Daragez to Kuchan, and Musaddak Diwan from Sarakhs to Daragez. I am informed that the Minister for Foreign Affairs proposed Muhakkak-ud- Daula for the Karguzarship of Meshed but that Mushar-us-Saltana has protested against it. The bakkals have made an unfortunate investment. They presented the Deputy Governor-General with Tumans 300 to be allowed to sell fruit in the city at their own prices, but after three days of this Utopian trading Kashaf-ul-Mulk Rais-i-Baladi, intervened, and the bakkals now complain that their money has been burnt. The Governor-General is apparently still determined to bring in Shajji-us- Saltana from Jam, and the latter complained bitterly to M. Lemanski on his arrival that this was his reward for assisting the Russians and English. Colonel Skuratt visited me on behalf of General Loginov to ask for my co-operation in keeping him at his post. I replied that M. Nikolski and I had already received the Governor- General’s promise that he would not interfere for the present owing to the special circumstances existing on the frontier ; however I again sent the Attache to enquire. The Governor-General stated that Shajji had beaten a second mamur “ almost to death.” I have received no report of such an incident and we are telegraphing for confirmation or otherwise. If it be true that Shajji has put himself in the wrong to such an extent, it will, of course, be impossible to intervene further, unfortunate as will be the effect on the frontier of his recall. He himself has informed the Russians that the Governor-General’s motive is to extort money from him, and as I have not heard that he has yet paid black-mail it is possible that this may be correct. The Russians on the spot aver that Shajji was in no way concerned in the first incident. {Secret). —Mushar-us-Saltana has received a cypher telegram from Vossuk-ud- Daula approving his work so far and encouraging him to lead the steps of the young Governor-General in the narrow way of good government. Although his present appointment is a modest one for his deserts, he can yet do most valuable work in it for his country. He exhorts him to act with courage in removing the abuses for which former Governors-General were responsible. British affairs. —Shuja-ud-Daulah still professes inability to complete the payment of even one instalment of his debt to the Imperial Bank of Persia. In conjunction with the Deputy Governor-General arrangements are being made for the sale price of his produce to be credited to the Bank’s agent at Kuchan. Messrs. Eberhardie and Leighton of the Indo-European Telegraph Department left for Tehran via Shahrud on the 11 th instant, and Mr. Hamilton starts immediately for the inspection of the line towards Tehran. Persian affairs. —The police of Daragez are reported to have received no pay for three months and as a telegram from the Governor and the Maliyat to Meshed has received no attention the men no longer attend to their duties. Daragez is not a model for good order at the best of times, and the temporary cessation of even inefficient police supervision is not calculated to improve it. By order of the Wazir-i-Maliyat, Tehran, the nawakil tax has been leased to Shahzada Murtaza Mirza, brother of Mustafa Mirza, the Governor of Turbat-i- Haidari. J mmm ___ Opf* i 01 0 Y/ith 1 Eosoivsd on 21 Lv '- # 1 JlU \ KDIA FOBEIGT! SECRETARY’S2 i if Russian affairs.-Geneml Loginov has receivodnofurtherinteW affairs in the Chikishliyar region. He imagines that post report was due to the migration of the Tur Oman Native report has it that Caucasus Musulmans ^ve been released from He service. A good deal of speculation has on the 35 natives tried for rioting at Tashkent in f 0 ' 116 ' 1 ? 1 ' , ^ labour scheme (Diary 36). Five were sentenced to death nine to 20 P servitude, others to lesser punishments, and 11 acquitted. J;®'f r “ n ^ 3 itade confirmed the death sentences in two cases, substituted u y P . , , . to the othrtbree, and remitted the sentences of 20 years’ penal servitude to too months’ imprisonment! It seems to be generally admitted that, however much individual officials may have blundered, the initial fault lies with the Ministry of Fomgn ormtro- ducing the scheme without having prepared the native population as to its inception and scope, or having thought out probable consequences beforehand. Russian railway engineers have recently been carrying out investigations m Daragez and Kelat regions. During the week they arrived here in a steam car. Persian and. German intrigues.—I had hoped that the Turbat-i-Jam prisoners would Edv be on their way to India, but the Military Agent has just received a telegram from'Colonel Gustehin that owing to conflicting statements the m eiro- eatorv had been reopened. I hope to be able to telegraph for our troops to take tCprisoners over on in a dav or so. I am not particularly satisfied with what have heard of M. Mikhailov’s conduct of the enemy. Apart from requesting our agent to leave the room while he conferred with an Indian prisoner, he has received from Muhammad Yunis and Muhammad Hussein a petition m English in which they set forth their complicity in, and certain doings of, the Germ Mission. He made no mention of this to our agent but it was shewn to the latter secretly by a third person. It seems abundantly clear that the two pnso e mentioned above are trying their hardest not to be sent to India. I have heard from Sabzawar that no traces of (the alleged) Niedermeyer and his companion have been found, and I fear that the zeal displayed by the Cossacks at Shahrud is not of the kind to cause an individual who in 1913 was ab e to perform the whole rites of a pilgrim at the Meshed Shrine undetected, to fall into their net. According to a Persian arrival they have a barricade across the road and carefully examine all passers-by. My informant asked them why they were doing this and they replied they were on the look-out for Germans. The fame of their proceedings will thus be spread far and wide Having heard that Haji Karara, the ex-servant of Kazim Beg, and the young Arab Saiyid Yunis had left Afghanistan for Meshed, I caused search to be made for them and the former was arrested yesterday^ At present he denies even his identity but he bore a rahdari with his name which stated that he was to leave the country by order of the Kotwal of Herat, and a Kurrami who saw him both at Kabul and Herat has identified him. Three English sovereigns were found on him but the most careful search of his clothing and effects has revealed no papers. It is not particularly likely that he would be the bearer of any as he had been discharged by his master. He was apparently making for Muhammerah. Khan Malik recently left Meshed for Tehran as. he was reputed to have been appointed Rais-i-Maliyat at Yazd. I am informed that the Russians have arrested him at Shahrud. During the past week the Democrats successfully floated a rumour, which enjoyed general credence, that Hussain Zada had assembled 5,000 sowars at Jandak, and was marching on Tabas. 3I have called the Russian Consul-General’s attention to the presence of Munshi Nizam at Mahammadabad at the gates of Meshed and to the fact that he is endeavouring to hire a house in the city. About a year ago the Russians asked permission to arrest him and take him to Russia, but the Minister replied that his deportation should suffice. Although it may not be easy to prove his complicity with German agents, there is not the slightest doubt that he has returned to this city in defiance of orders, and this should prove a 'primd facie reason for proceeding against him. News fom Kariz .—Some members of the band of Sarwar Khan have been arrested in Bakharz by Hazara sowars of Shuja-ul-Mulk. A caravan with some smuggled rifles was reported proceeding to Afghanistan via Khaf. M. Povov, who had received telegram to take action in the matter, sent for our agent and asked him to take the necessary steps as he was too unwell to attend to business. Shuja-ul-Mulk has received orders from the Governor-General to entertain 24 road-guards in Bakharz. Little can be done with such a number. He has presented Tumans 500 towards the rebuilding of the Russian dis pensary at Kariz, and has set men of his own to supervise the work. The agent is of opinion that the establishment of the new Russian posts will cause any fugitives of the German party to give that section a wide berth. News from Herat .—The abortive flight of the Austrians has led to strained relations between Wagner and the local authorities. The Naib Solar originally wished to punish the guard, but pardoned them at the intercession of Shuja-ud- Daula. The strength of the guard has now been increased by 14 men, and no Austrian is permitted to go out unless accompanied by several soldiers. Acting on the orders of the Naib Solar, a sergeant of the guard one evening entered the room where ^Vagner and the Austrians were sitting and proceeded to count them. Wagner seized his rifle and threatened to shoot the sergeant if he did not immediate- lv withdraw. He angrily disclaimed any intention of bolting like a thief in the night, and said that if he left it would be in a manner befitting a guest of the Amir. The sergeant reported the occurrence to Shuja-ud-Daula who ordered him not to repeat the act, and said that he himself would inform the Naib Solar that all were present. Four of the escaped Austrians were brought in on the 2 nd instant, and the remaining five on the 6 th instant. The latter were stopped on the frontier near Kuhsan and are stated to have been brought back to Herat via Chihil Dukhtaran. The tenth man is the one brought in by our guide to Kariz According to present reports ten only attempted to leave. They have all been lodged at the Bagh-i-bhah and are not permitted to visit the Bagh-i-Karta. The Amir’s original orders were that these men were to be sent to Kabul, and their flight is ascn e o^ leu un willingness to proceed there. It is probable that they will be sen o va u no withstanding. The servants of the Austrians at the Bagh-i-Karta procured them a musician. On this coming to the ears of the Naib-ul-Hukumat he ordere t e un or una player to be chained and imprisoned. Wagner has been making observations and apparently plans from the ro ^ the Citadel, and has also made notes in various streets. The Amir has ordered the immediate return of Shuja-ud-Daula to Kabul, stating that arrangemen s s ou e made locally for a new mehmandar. Wagner is very displeased at this and told ms servants that he would also leave. It is believed that he will ry e ama The Darwish whose arrival was reported in bath, where he cut his hair and beard.

He had been to Chakansur but was advised by the .overnthe frontier as he would probably be arrested on the Persian side, and he now intends to cross from Herat. The head of the Herat workshops has reported that there is great scarcity of iron and requests that a stock be laid in from Maimana and Turkistan. T e Naih- 'ul-Hukumat has promised to inquire if any is procurable. The price of horse shoes has risen from 3 to 8 krans, and contmnes to increase. Orders have been given for the strict recovery of any outstanding balance of revenue, and special mamurs are being appointed to recover it within 20 days. A shortage of cash in the Treasury is behved to be the explanation of the step. A rumour is in circulation among traders that the Governor has forbidden the export of money to foreign countries and great anxiety is caused thereby. It is not, however, confirmed The Naib-ul-Hukumat has despatched 24 soldiers, all liable to capital punish ment, under guard to Kabul by the Hazarajat road. The Amir has summoned a noted wrestler from Sabzawar to Kabul, and the man is being despatched with an escort of khawanin sowars. Condition of country Shirwan robber Khaddu fled on the arrival of sowars sent by Adal-ud-Daula, but he is expected to reappear as soon as they have left.

Persian Officials. —Adal-nd-Daula has arrived at Kuchan but it remains to be seen how his first days will pass. Shuja-ud-Daula took refuge originally with the Eussian Agent at Kuchan till the latter received orders from his Consul- General to turn him out. He was reported to have collected a large number of tyfangchis, and Farhad Khan with some 300 mounted men was reported in the neighbourhood of Kuchan. Adal-ud-Daula halted in the neighbourhood of Chinaran till he had received a reinforcement of 70 sowars from here. Shuja is said to be on his way here but he is certainly moving by very short stages if this is so. Salar Nusrat, the Rais-i-Nazmia, has resigned his post chiefly on account of the difficulties placed in his way by the present administration. The immediate cause is the fact that he has had to pay up, mainly from his own pocket, compensation for’several robberies which have occurred here. On his protesting to the Governor- General the latter is said to have told him that he has only himself to blame if he neglects to make mudakhal from prostitutes, and other devious ways. His resignation has not yet been finally accepted. Mubasliar-ul-Mulk called on me a few days ago prior to leaving for Sistan where he informed me he had been appointed Rais-i-Molly at. He was anxious to set off as Khan Malik was trying hard to secure permission from Tehran to return there himself. The latter has been playing a somewhat mysterious game as about a fortnight ago he went the rounds of all his friends and acquaintances to bid farewell, stating that he was leaving the following day. He did not go, however, but has been living a sequestered life, hardly leaving his house by day and avoiding all usual haunts, and engaged in correspondence with the Wazir-i-Maliyat with the object of returning to Birjand, apparently for an enquiry into his conduct relative to the recent fracas, but possibly in hopes of reinstatement. He shewed a friend a letter he had received from Shaukat-ul-Mulk saying that the latter had given up the idea of returning to Sistan and Kain for the present, and saying that he would bear his friends in mind. In this connection Shahzada Muhammad Taki Mirza, late military mufattish at Birjand, recently stated here that the Turks will send Shaukat to Birjand as Governor as soon as they capture Tehran. Persian Affairs. —Nusrat-ul-Mulk is again in trouble with the Governor- General and it appears likely that the unfortunate young man will be^ extensively bled during the present regime. A man of his tribe, being ‘ ‘ wanted for killing a man, had established himself with some companions in &amp; sangar in the hills near Turuk. He had sent a British subject, Muhammad Ibrahim Hakkak, at whose village he had tried to take refuge a message begging him to intercede for him and a short time ago Mushar-us-Saltana requested me to use my influence with Hakkak to secure his good offices to have the man sent in without bloodshed. In the meantime the authorities had bound over Nusrat-ul-Mulk in the sum of Tumans 5,000 to produce the man. The Vamin was duly promised and the man was on his way to Meshed when he was seized by sowars of the Governor of the Kuh-i-Paiajat who told him that he would eventually receive the pardon but that he should make himself scarce for the present in order that Nusrat-ul-Mulk should be obliged to pay up the Tumans 5,000 for failing to produce him. A new police-station with an establishment of a Commissary and 23 men hr s been established in the Ark quarter.

There has been practically nothing of all this in the local others till quite recently. According to these the Governor of Samarkand has caused notices detailing the terms of the military la h«ur service andpena ies for disobedience to be posted up, and has also reassured the Russian pop that no recurrence of such outrages as occurred at Jizak is to be lea . In some parts, notably in Ferghana, workmen are said to have come forward vo nntarily in considerable numbers, and patriotic processions of the workmen, bearing the Tsar’s picture and flags, have taken place at Osh, ISamangan, Skobelev, and Kamnagan. Ad Vyerni the Military Governor of Semirechia addressed deputations of Kirghiz who are said to have left in a pacified condition after the scope and work ing of the measure had been explained to them. Thirty-five Sarts who pi iticipated in an attack on a Tashkent police-station on the 24th July are to be tried by court-martial. Turkomans are said to be paying up a money contribution with alacrity : at the same time I continue to hear oi the alacrity with which they are purchasing x rifles near Pul-i-Khatum One of the first acts of General Kuropatkin on assuming the Governor- Generalship of Turkistan was to order that all natives should rise to their leet on the entry or passage of an officer or official in uniform The version of the incident at Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam reported last week under “ Persian affairs” is given by the Kariz agent as follows. The Russian Pohtical Officer M Samsonov was, with two Cossack officers, the guest of Habibullan Khan, a son oi Shuia-ul-Mulk, when some time after dark firing in the vicinity was heard. The offender was. stated to be one of the men accompanying Sarhang All Khan, the mamur in the' case of Nusrat-ul-Mulk, and M. Samsonov sent a message to the mamur that the man with his rifle should be sent to him within two hours. The Sarhang replied that the information that the offender was his follower was false, on which M. Samsonov required him to leave Turbat-i-Jam. Ascertaining later that he had only repaired to a neighbouring hamlet he sent Cossacks to see the two of them some miles on their way and to return. The Cossacks, however, beat and disarmed them both. General Loginov, who was not quite clear as to what had actually happened, told me that he had received the report that the deported man had drawn his sword on a Cossack on which the latter beat and disarmed both master and man. Since writing the above General Loginov has informed me that he has just received a telegram from Askhabad stating that the Goklan Turkomans around Chiik shliyar and Gunbad-i-Kabus have risen, and that they have surrounded one of the frontier posts. As far as can be judged at present this insurrection is an isolated case but no further details are to hand. German and Persian intrigues.—On the 27th instant, our newswriter at Kariz was advised by special messenger from the newswriter at Herat that the exodus of the Austrians had actually begun, one party of four having started for Kuhsan and halted at Shabash. A man in our employ at the former place was watching their movements with a view to early report. Another 10 of them accompanied one of our men, who has been on the look-out for such an opportunity for seme time, towards the frontier. On the way most of them left him and he only succeed ed in bringing actually one Austrian soldier into Kariz, where he was arrested by the Russians. He reports that part of the remainder were making for Zorabad,and others for Karat, where there is already a Russian post, and after handing over his prisoner led a Cossack officer with some of his men towards the former place, while the Russian Political Officer, M. Samsonov, with a Cossack officer and party left for Karat. In addition Shuja-ul-Mulk has undertaken to issue orders in all his villages for the seizure of any that may come that way, and as the remainder of the Cossack cordon are on the alert and Birjand and Sistan have received early warning there should be a fair chance of laying most of these gentlemen by the heels. There has been no special mention of Wagner but it is | unlikely that he will have remained behind. I On learning that no papers had been found on the four prisoners captured at Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam I issued urgent instructions to the Kariz agent to make a most thorough search of their clothing and effects for hidden papers. He has been successful in finding a cypher communication sewn in a small cloth bag into the lining of the trousers of Mirza Agha. The search was conducted in the presence of the Russian Political Officer and their Kariz agent, M. Popov, who immediately took possession of the document and refused to allow our agent to make a copy for me. There have been several instances reported of similar high-handed behaviour on the part of M. Popov, (who has, the Russian Consul-General informs me, an extraordinarily difficult character) but in view of the paramount importance of good relations between our respective agents I have refrained frem taking official notice of them. In the present instance the Military Agent has telegraphed for the document to be sent to us at once, and he has also enquired why the prisoners are still at Kariz when the General Officer Commanding had directed that they should be sent to Turbat-i-Haidari without delay. One Muhammad Sindhi surrendered voluntarily here early in the week. The son of a Sindh Zamindar, he quarrelled with his father and set off for Mecca early in the year, eventually reaching Birjand, where having falsely given himself out as a secret agent of the Sindh authorities he was arrested by the late Mr. New and sent to Sistan where he was confined. After some months’ detention he escaped and returned to Afghanistan via Chakansur. He continued a career of systematic but very inartistic lying, with the result that he was suspected by the Afghans and confined at Kandahar, Kabul (where he saw Nasrullah Khan, who ordered his deportation), again Kandahar, and finally Herat (whence he was conducted to the frontier). From Kandahar to Kabul he was sent, together with Abdul Aziz (who assiduously read the Granth) and Hassan Ali, and although these avoided secret conversation before him he heard them say on one occasion “ If the British knew what we are doing they would cut our throats. ” He met von Hentig, the “ Rajah, ” Kazim Beg, and Maulvi Baraktullah at Kabul, but none of them would have anything to say to him. Deserted Afridi sepoys were with him at Kabul, whence he says they were sent back to their diomes. As he was in confinement when the Germans left Kabul he has no first-hand knowledge, and most of the information he picked up seems on comparison with later statements to be incorrect. He is the “ suspected person ” wffiose forthcoming deportation from Herat was reported in a recent diary. I propose sending him to Turbat-i-Haidari for conveyance to India with the Turbat-i-Jam prisoners. An Austrian soldier, who escaped from Merv, was arrested here in the course cf the week. The Democrats are doing much talking but the recent searches by the Russians have made them nervous. They receive many cipher telegrams and have learnt to their satisfaction that the Turks near Hamadan have killed 35,000 Russians. “ Your sick friend from Plamadan to Kazvin, but he is not cured and left for Baku via Resht ” is a sample of their efforts, “sick friend” standing for Russian troops. They are looking to hear of trouble in the Caucasus. News from Kariz .—The coming of the Russians to Turbat-i-Jam has caused much flutter among the unlawful dovecots. Mir Baki Sultan has left Gak for Khatai in Zorabad district, many Taimuris following him. They marched near the Hari Rud in order to escape to Afghanistan if necessary. Sarwar Khan is also alarmed and has shifted to Dahan-i-Doab in Jamrud, whence he will go towards Zorabad and perhaps cross the Afghan border. The Russian Political Officer, M. Samsonov, with an officer and 20 Cossacks reached Kariz on the 24th August. Visits were exchanged with Shuja-ul-Mulk who invited the Russians to dinner.Ijlii.'f ii K Six Herati pilgrims have been plundered by Afghan robbers in the Dasht-i- Dagharu Robber! also attacked the tenants of Shuja-ul-Mulk at the vrilage of Dagharu and looted their cattle and effects. ' News from Herat.-VU newswriter has been informed by a third P^^hat the Germans Mehmmdar (presumably Shujamd-D^la explmncd th A s attitude with regard to the Germans as follows. While anxious to .tie p the TuS Government it must be realised that Turkey is very far from Afghanistan, ffis people Ire Zt prepared for war and German promises of arms and ammunition muld not be otherwise than ineffective in view of the distance and impossibility of transport Afghanistan on entering the war on these conditions w ould, isolated as she is find hlrself between two powerful enemies--England and Russia. If the German forces could approach Afghanistan the Afghans would be ready to ioin them As regards the Mission, they were welcome to stay as the Amir s guests as long as they liked. If they wished to depart no obstacle would be put in their way. On this the Germans elected to leave Afghanistan. He has also been informed that the German passing by the name of the “Minister son” left the Turkistan party at Panjshir with servants towards Kashmir with the object of reaching Chinese territory possibly Tibet. Semayer with two followers left the same party at Maimana making for Russi™ territory• The party at present at Herat is said to consist of Wagner, 16 Austrians and 21 followers, Persians, Berberies, and Arabs. They had 2o horses, S^mules, a riding camel and two donkeys. They have, however, sold some of the horses. On the 21 st August the Austrians requested their Mehmandar to procure them musicians as they were feeling very down-hearted. On an excursion they had found an inscribed stone which they requeted him to have knmg , Their servants have been spreading the news that the English supplied the feha of Mecca with arms and ammunition with the object of getting Mecca into their hands. The statement was received with some scepticism as it was thought possible that the German Emperor, if victorious, would take Mecca himselt. From the 23rd August they began to pay up some of their servants, ordered clothes to be made and made various purchases, among other things buying up old Afghan clothes and headgear from their servants as well as native shoes.- (The Austrian taken at Kanz wore Afghan clothes over uniform ) ihey were also asking for English saddles. The Austrian “ Chaush ’’ and another known as “ Mirza ” were expected to leave shortly for Persia via Anardarra. (On the 27th the newswriter sent the special messenger to Kariz as detailed under heading “ Persian and German intrigues.”) It was stated that the Germans had entrusted Mirza Agha with a letter for Tehran on delivery of which he would be liberally rewarded. Presumably this is the document found on him. Orders have been given for the deportation from Herat of Haji Karm and Saiyid Yunis, the young Arab, of both of whom previous mention has been made, via Kahr Kila. The samples of coal from Karkh having proved satisfactory, a quantity has been ordered and samples have been sent to Kabul. News of the Jizak disturbances were received from muleteers and from a report by Risaldar Yar Muhammad Khan from Chihil Dukhtaran. They are substantially correct. The Pisaldar sent in two Lowanis caught smuggling in rifles from Russian territory. The rifles were confiscated and the men imprisoned by the iSaib-uL- Hukumat.

Persian officials. —Sliuja-ud-Daula has reached Meshed and visited me yesterday in connection with his debt to the Imperial Bank. At my request the Manager of the Meshed Branch was present, and certain proposals were made which the debtor retired to think over. As may be expected he professes that his inability to settle the claim is owing to the loss of his Governorship. The officer commanding the Gendarmerie, who escorted Adal-ud-Daula to Kuchan states that Farhad Khan would have attacked the latter en route had not he himself sent the robber a message that his men were trained according to the latest precepts of military science. Farhad Khan replied to the effect that a little later would suit him equally well. The officer is of opinion that in any case Adal-ud-Daula’s fears will prove too much for him. I exchanged visits with the Mutaivalli Bashi during the week. This official takes a singularly keen interest in the general course of the war, in regard to which he is well informed. I hear that he has been advising the ActiiTg Karguzar that the true policy is to pay an equal amount of attention to Russian and English cases. Mushar-us-Saltana, who has much to be grateful to M. Nikolski for his help in initial difficulties, unfortunately appears to have conceived the opinion that as long as the Russians are satisfied the rest of the world may go hang ! The incident at Sheikh Jam referred to in previous diaries has had one annoying consequence in that the Governor-General has summoned Shaji-us- Saltana to Meshed on the charge of intriguing against his mamur. I represented to the Russian Consul-General how much our joint interests on the frontier would suffer at the present moment when Shaji is developing promising energy in arresting members of the German band ; more particularly as he has earned unpopularity at Meshed for assisting the egregious English and Russians against the beneficent Germans. A sojourn here would thus be the most likely thing m the world to cool his ardour. We therefore both approached the Governor-General, who has promised to leave him at his post for the present, The Russians have complained against the Karguzar of Kuchan, Madir-us- Sultan and requested his exchange with Musaddak Diwan, the Karguzar of Sarakhs. Mirza Isa Khan Rais-i-Maliyat o£ Turbat-i-Haidari, is transferred m the same capacity to Bujnurd. He is reported to be well-disposed to both the British and Russian Governments. , Persian affairs. —Mushar-us-Saltana ^ is pressing Nusrat-ul-Mulk for the payment of Tumans 5,000 exacted from him for the non-production of Muhammad Meshmast, the “ wanted ” person. The people of Kuchan have thanked the Governor-General for the favour shewn them by the appointment of Adal-ud-Daula. Their thanks are probably as sincere and spontaneous as were their recent telegraphic requests for retention of Shuja-ud-Daula. Khaddu a notorious ruffian of Shirwan, has come in with a following and compelled residents of Shirwan to take sanctuary m the telegraph office as a protest 3' “al of Shuja-ud-Daula. The Governor-General has ordered smears to be sent against him, but no effective action has yet been taken, remains unpunished disorder m Shirwan will probably ensue. /c /TPp Minktcr for Foreign Affairs has telegraphed in cypher to the dispute between Barbans and Taimuns, etc. had »«££&amp; Pecsivsd on 13 NUV S 3 1 U with g I KID1A FOREIGN SECRETARY’S | Letter.

His detachment at Astrabad have informed him that they have sent a reinforcement to a small post near Chatli, they have no official information and the telegraph to the frontier is interrupted. During the course of the week General Loginov was notified thnii his force would be increased by 5 companies of rifles. 4 machine-guns. 1 light field battery. 160 mounted scouts. These would be based on Astrabad. There is difficulty, however, about accommodation at the latter and another place wall probably be fixed upon. The disturbances in Turkistan have entailed serious consequences on some of the chief officials. General Galkin, Military Governor of Syr Darya, has been placed on furlough •without pay pending removal from the service, General Gippius, Military Governor of Ferghana, loses his post for having taken upon himself to interpret the order for military workmen as voluntary and not compulsory — which probably accounts for the patriotic processions in Ferghana noted in last week’s diary — the Chief of Police of the native part of Tashkent and various other minor functionaries lose their appointments. Persian and German Intrigues .—I have only just received the cypher document found on Mirza Agha, wdiich we are unable to interpret by any German cyphers held here. Granting that the experts at one of the various centres to which it has been telegraphed can throw light on it, more than a week of valuable time has been lost by the inexplicable conduct of M. Samsonov in taking it with him for a tour in the country instead of sending it to headquarters at once. On the 2 nd instant, a local agent came to us in great excitement after meeting an acquaintance proceeding to his home on the frontier. This person had told him that he had guided two “ Germans ” to Mahmudabad, a village contiguous to Meshed. Disguised as mullas, and riding donkeys, they had left Sharifabad for Nishapur on the evening of the 31st ultimo. I immediately warned the Russians, who telegraphed a description of the individuals and their mounts along the line to Shahrud, and I also made arrangements for the neighbourhood of Sabzavar to be watched. It seemed difficult to account for these person^ presence as, as far as our information regarding the Germans at Herat v r ent, they would not have had time to have come so far, but this week’s Herat report opens another possibility. He states that Meder meye r. reported to have made for the Russian frontier from Maimana, had written to Wagner that he had reached Meshed in safety. The letter was received on the 27th ultimo by the hand of a Kabuli to whom Wegner paid Tumans 200, and to whom he presented a horse in order that he should proceed straight from the Bagh-i-Karta to Kabul without entering Herat. Another circumstance which gives colour to the probability of Niedermeyer’s presence is the fact that Munshi Nizam, a democrat and Germanophile, deported by the Russians from Meshed a year ago, has been at Mahmudabad for the last fortnight and more. He was Rais-i-Nazmia in 1913 when Niedermeyer visited Meshed,'and it is far from unlikely that the latter, finding the passage of the Russian frontier too risky, is attempting to get to Tehran or to the Turkish forces to the v T est of it. The nine men who left our guide on the way from Herat are reported to be eight Austrians and Haji Kami. They were turned back to Herat from Kuhsan by the Afghan authorities as they had no rahdaris. The four reported at Kuhsan are also said to have been turned back. ^ Apparently the Afghans recognise a difference between the member!* of the Mission — Government guests— and the ordinary refugee. The prisoners captured at Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam have only recently reached Turbat-i-Haidari as M. Samsonov took charge of them. The interrogatory is in progress and our. agent at Turbat-i-Haidari has just telegraphed to me that atthe request of the prisoner Muhammad Tunis, who professed to have a secret communication to make, the Russian Consul M. Mikhailov asked him to leave the room. During his absence Muhammad Tunis implored M. Mikhailov to have him - and the other Indians sent to Russia as they would probably lose their lives if * sent to India for trial. I have sent Muhammajl Sindhi to Turbat to-day. The democrats are particularly encouraged at the wildly pessimistic rumours of the military situation near Tehran. It is to be hoped that some definite military success will give us an opportunity to dispose-of these once and for all. I do not gather that they intend to do more than talk at present. News from Turbai-i-Haidari. —The Governor-General has telegraphed to the Governor to make enquiry in the case of Zulfikar Khan, who during his tenure as Governor of Khaf extorted Tumans 3,000 from the people under the pretext of fines. If the enquiry be not satisfactory (probably in other words if it does not clearly demonstrate Zulfikar Khan’s guilt) a special mamvr will be sent to recover the amount. It seems difficult to reconcile this with the statement that recently, when a candidate for the governorship, Zulfikar Khan was considered generally acceptable to the people, but it is not impossible that this is another variant of the art of raising the wind. The Governor has received the thanks of the Governor-General for action taken by him to arrest Afghan robbers who looted a caravan and pilgrims near Aliandeh. He has been informed that pay will be disbursed for 70 road guards, and that as soon as they are established he wall be held responsible for the safety of all roads in his jurisdiction, and will be liable to pay compensation for any property taken by robbers. He answered that as he had 103 farsakhs of road to watch, he could take no responsibility under a minimum of 100 sowars. The Governor-General has since telegraphed that he hears from the postal authorities that the road from Gunabad is still unsafe, and that he is deeply dis appointed in the Governor. The latter has received a private telegram from his friends that the annexation of Gunabad to Turbat is not advisable in his own interests. News from Kariz. —M. Samsonov left for Khaf en route for Turbat-i-Haidari * on the 28th August, taking with him the Austrian recently captured and the Turbat-i-Jam prisoners. Shuja-ul-Mulk, at the instance of his tenants at Mohmadabad, brought a complaint of high-handed conduct on the part of the Cossacks to the notice of the Russian agent. The latter has transferred the men to Abbasabad. On the 30th August the Governor of Khaf sent 25 soivars to intercept a party of Afghan robbers. The latter sent on their booty with one party, and with the remainder engaged the soicars from high ground, killing one man and four horses. The whole party then made good their escape to Afghanistan. On the 31st August a report was received from Turbat-i-Jam that 40 soivars had arrived to take possession of the property claimed by Nusrat-ul-Mulk from Shaji-us-Saltana. If the latter resists, serious consequences may follow, and it is possible that if pressed he may take refuge in Afghanistan. Shuja-ul-Mulk has put forward another complaint, this time from the villagers of Karat, against the Cossacks who, they state, take fodder and other supplies without payment. M. Popov, the Russian agent, has informed our agent that he is suffering from a nervous disability and instructed him to take Cossacks if necessary to arrest Germans without any reference to himself, as such demands wouid increase his ailment! 1 The Russians have placed M. Lemanski as their agent at Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam. This gentleman, a Pole originally in the employment of the Russian .Bank, served for about two years as the tutor to the son of the Sardar of Bujnurd. News from Herat .—Reading between the lines, there appears to have been some mutual recrimination between Shuja-ud-Daula and Wagner. At the instance of the former the Naib-ul-Hukumat issued orders to detain, at the frontier, the Austrians who had absconded from Herat. The following day Shuja-ud-Dau aasked Warner why he had not told him of the Austrians’ intention, to which Wagner re lied that, as Mehmandar, Shuja was or should have been fully cognisant of their movements Wagner’s servants have purchased two pairs of travel ing trunks Z ar^nging Russian saddles for Afghan ones The stone which is inscribed •,r 11 cnrarl ViPina rnt to renr 1 ^ rr^rfahlp ! The servants have also recently changed £ 50 in sovereigns for Russian gold. The flight of the Austrians has given rise to the curious rumour that they are Russian spies in disguise, and that those still remaining at Bagh-i-Karta are English. The four members of the German party who halted at Shabash were sent to Ghurian, whence the Governor sent to Herat for orders. The 1\ aib-ul-Hukwmt despatched cavalry to bring them to Herat. Wagner recently received and entertained with tea a darwish with long heard and hair. This man’s identity has not yet been ascertained. Among other purchases by the Germans’ servants is antimony, which, it is imagined, will be used for the make-up of any leaving in disguise. Certain indications shew that the A T aib Salar is not very certain of the temper of the Herat garrison. He negatived the proposal of, the Kabul drill instructors to introduce hill-climbing and marching-order drill mto the curriculum on the grounds that he had already had to consent to one parade a day only and did not wish to cause further discontent. He also prevailed on the Naib Salar not to blow a soldier convicted of murder from a gun in Herat, hut to send him to Kabul, where the punishment could be inflicted. He has issued orders for target practice to take place outside the city and for the relief of 300 Khawanin to proceed to Kabul. He has inspected 100 of the men to be sent. Condition of the country.— The Governor of Khaf has complained to the Governor-General of raids by Khawanin sowars and Afghan robbers genera ly. The former has telegraphed to Tehran requesting the entertainment of 100 sowars for Khaf. He also proposes to entertam 50 Karasuran sowars as a temporary * measure, as the Khafi soivars, receiving no pay, do not obey the orders of the Governor and many of them have left. Sharif, a notorious Afghan robber, was arrested at Khaf, where he had come to shoe his horse, there is a chance that his comrades may attempt his rescue. Bobbers appeared between Abbasabad and Miandasht and carried away some camels which were recovered by men of the Amniyat. The Shikaris are still active and no measures against them have been taken, I would call attention to the issue of the ££ Siraj-ul-Akhbar ” of the 16th July* No. 22 . It contains the last of a series of articles advocating ghaza, as well as an attack on the Sharif of Mecca and the English by implication. I am not aware if the circulation of this paper in India is permitted, but it certainly contains pro vocative and injurious matter. E. A. F.

( 1 ) It is reported from Eudi Mahi that 50 Baluchis under Juma, son of Bahadur, Shalibur (? Shuribur), the notorious raider—see Diary No. 1 of 1915— were seen at Gur Koh on about the feth August, and that a larger party are behind them. The object of the lashkar was said to be the attacking of our friends the Eekis and Ismailzais in pursuance of a blood-feud. ( 2 ) It is reported that a rigorous censorship is being exercised over all telegrams and postal matter arriving at and leaving Bam. The Governor, it is said, has received very strict orders from Kerman to punish persons discussing political matters in public places. (3) Information (un-confirmed) has reached our reporter at Eudi Mahi from Bazman that two Germans with a force have arrived at Vilayat-i-Gudar. Major Hutchinson, I believe, left Eobat for Kacha on 17th September. Brigadier-General Dyer is expected to reach Saindak from Khwash on 25th September. He is proceeding to India on sick leave, I understand, and his place is to be taken temporarily by Lieutenant-Colonel Tanner, 127th Baluchis, wio is The Karquzar of Sistan is fighting violently with the Deputy Governor.

I V—5 Persian Officials. -Adal-ud-Daula came to bid me good-bye on his departure to take up the Governorship of Kuchan. He was obviously nervous, which under the circumstances is not to be wondered at, as some two years ago, when occupy ing the same position, he fled to Meshed in fear of his life from Shuja-ud-Daula, and it is more than probable that his present arrival will not pass without incident! Shuja-ud-Daula is reported to have taken refuge with the Russian agent at Kuchan, and he has prevailed upon a number of men and women to seek sanctuary in the Telegraph Office. Among his grievances is the fact that ^he met the Governor General on his way to Meshed and paid a certain sum for pishkash to retain his appointment. Now he has lost both appointment and money ! Complaints (have been made to the Deputy Governor-General against the Passpot Officer at Chacha, who is reputed to be making money by various unfair means. A mamur has been sent to Chacha to investigate the affair. This Pass port Officer assisted the former Karguzar, Muazzaz-ud-Daula, in smuggling escap ed Austrian prisoners into Persia. Persian Affairs. —The Birjand Karguzar has telegraphed in cypher to the Central Karguzar that no attention is paid by Hissam-ud-Daula to orders from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Governor-General, or the Central Karguzari, and that Hissam has instigated Indian Military officers to telegraph false reports to the Persian War Office. I understand—subject to confirmation — that this official has now been dis missed, which may perhaps be regarded as a happy consummation. The Governor-General, at the request of Nusrat-ul-Mulk, recently despatched -a nmmur to take over certain property, the title of which was in dispute between Nusrat-ul-Mulk and Shaji-us-Saltana, from the latter. Shaji-us-Saltana request ed assistance from the Russian Commandant at Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam, who is reported to have beaten the mamur and disarmed his men. British Affairs. —Tumans 2,000 were paid up to the Agent of the Imperial Bank at Kuchan [out of the instalment of Tumans 5,000, apparently through Dabir-us-Sultan. At the same time I received a telegram from him, directly contrary to his former offer, stating that he refused to have anything to do with such a backslider as Shuja-ud-Daula, and I have a shrewd suspicion that he had ■received more than a hint from here to withdraw from the affair. Mushar-us- S alt ana has written stating that the property of Shuja will be confiscated and the proceeds paid to the Bank, and I have sent him officially a copy of the Persian Foreign Office Protocol as to the recovery of the debt and requested him to be .guided by that document. Russian Affairs. —Reports have been current that the Russian Government has postponed the date for the supply of military labour from Russian Musahnans, and the Russian Military Agent informs me that the 28th October has now been fixed. He infers from this concession that the Government recognised the serious possibilities of the situation. I understand from arrivals that the measure was to apply to the Caucasus also, and that opposition had also been manifest there, but I have no means of verifying this. At the same time Turkomans are still in search of arms and horses in Persia, •and I learn from a reliable source that certain sections have considered the possibi lity of migrating within the Persian border. It is noteworthy that the term recruits ’ is invariably employed by natives, and the belief that they are to be called upon to fight seems widespread and responsible for much of the unrest. Colonel Gustchin, while on leave, reported to the Tsar at his Stavka. His request that the Semirechia Cossacks might be given a chance of taking part in the major operations of the war was sympathetically received by both the Tsar and General Alexiev, which has given rise to the rumour that these troops will ' ffeselvod on 1 K 0 V J916 wifh !

Two points of interest which have transpired from, their preliminary statements 1 are that the German officer who arrived at Herat with the party from Turkistan is Wagner, and that Niedermeyer with another officer left the Kandahar party en route for Herat and was reported to have made for Chakansur. T ere appears reason to suppose that Niedermeyer s companion was von-Hentig but this is merely conjecture. The finger of the ubiquitous Mir Baki Sultan is involved in their adventures as in most frontier matters. The secret committee of the Meshed democrats have received certain letters from Tehran for Herat which are to be sent on by' special messengers. I hope that it may be possible to intercept some of these. One Muhammad kanm has made himself responsible for their despatch. Another member who is active is a poshtin-makei named Agha Abdur Bazak, who divides his time between Herat and Shahrud. The house of one Muhammad Jawad, Yazdi, has been searched by theBussians on suspicion, and his papers confiscated. Neivs from Turbat-i-Haidari. —A report was received at Turbat on the 15th instant that two parties of robbers had entered Babat-i-Kumai. The postal car, was detained at Gunabad as a precaution. Forty sowars were despatched trom Turbat as well as some from other places to the Babat. It is now intended to quarter ten serbazes at this place. The caravan with specie for the Imperial Bank reached Turbat-i-Haidari safely on the 20 th instant and left the following day for Meshed. After various displays of discourtesy on the part of the Bussian Consul, the Governor settled the question of precedence by paying the first visit himse L I do not imagine that this Consul will render the path of Mustafa Mirza particularly easy. There°are more rumours as to the transfer of the former, but they seem ta lack foundation.News from Kariz.—One Nurullali Khan, Makui, who imigrated from Persia to Afghanistan some time ago, has returned in disgust, having failed in obtaining any land. The Afghan contention appears to be that he is an undesirable alien. Sarwar Khan is apparently very uneasy at the arrival of Shuja-ul-Mulk at Kariz, having moved his mahalla to Dasht-i-Dagharu, and again to Pesh Robat. He is now said to be going to Zorabad. In consequence of a fracas between a Maliyctt sowar and the inhabitants of a village in the Bala Walayat of Bakharz, the Rais-i-Maliyat of Shahr-i-Nau proposed to send all available sowars to punish the villagers, who were preparing to resist. A messenger despatched to him by the Naib-ul-Hukumat of the district, warning him to desist from this action, was flogged by him, and the Naib-ul-Hukumat was only prevented from wreaking condign punishment on the Rais-i-Maliyat by the opportune arrival of Shuja-ul-Mulk. The Rais-i-Gumruk of Kariz has been J notified from Meshed that the export to Afghanistan of gold roubles has been declared illegal. / This traffic, involving a lucrative gamble, has grown to considerable propor tions lately. The establishment of the Cossack post mentioned in last week’s Diary is reported from Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam. News from Herat .—On about the 13th instant two letters arrived by post from Kabul, 1 for Shuja-ud-Daula, the Mehmandar of the Turkistan party from the Amir, and the other for Wagner. It was addressed in European characters but it is not known from whom it came. The Naib-ul-Hukumat and the Naib Solar visited Wagner the following day, and were closeted with him for two hours. News of the arrest of Voig4t’s party reached Herat on the 17th instant, and had the effect of enraging Wagner; He has purchased two donkeys, and it is surmised that he may attempt to use these for his escape, possibly in disguise. The Austrians are also expected to make off. An Arab by his own account, but possibly a native of Kermanshah, named Haji Karam, has been brought from Kabul by two sowars. He is said to be a dismissed servant of Kazim Beg, and it is expected that he will be deported to Persia. The Risaldar at Anardarra reported recently to Herat that two “ Government guests ” arrived at Anardarra and wished to cross into Persia. He stopped them but on their insisting that they had orders from Kabul and that he would be called to account if he interfered with them he allowed them to proceed. The date of this occurrence is not given. The Naib-ul-Hukumat has now instructed all frontier officials not to allow any person to enter or leave Afghanistan without a rahdari. The newswriter gives two rumours as requiring further confirmation ; one that a German has gone from Kabul towards Mengal district, the other that 15 other “Government guests ” are on their way to Herat from Kabul via the Hazarajat. The departure of Mirza Agha and his party has only recently become known and is reported by this Herat post. They were apparently escorted by sowars to Guiran and supplied with a Kaudani guide for Dahna-i-Zulfikar. The messenger sent by the Turkoman Sardar to his people has returned. T he Naib-ul-Hukumat rewarded him with 200 krans and directed that the letter be forwarded by post to the Sardar at Kabul. The Kaudani Ilba'gi is reported to have entrusted Tumans 5,000 to a trader to purchase presents from Panjdeh for his journey to Kabul. He is now said to have accompanied some officials to Kuhsan to take stock of his people and property in order that, if necessary, the revenue due from him may be assessed. The Naib-ul-Hukumat has given orders to the Governors of Kala-i-Nau, Bala Murghab, Ohakeharan, and Ghor, that all revenue grain collected should be stored on the spot, and not, as formerly, be despatched to Herat4 The Governor of Ghor has reported difficulty in recovering revenue without forcible measures. The Amir has finally decided that Khawanin sowars enlisted during his reign shall not receive any grain ration besides their cash pay. Those who wrsh to leave the service may do so. Their cash pay is totally insufficient to live upon. A Subadar with 8 drill instructors-recently arrived from Kabul and are mstruct- inffthe troops. The Subadar’s specialty is fortification, and trench-digging, in which matters he is instructing the sappers and miners. The remainder are employ- ed with the infantry, whom they have been drilling morning and afternoon. The strenuous life, however, is little to the taste of the soldiers, who have represented that with two parades a day they can neither attend to their family affairs nor heir subsidiary occupations. Brigadier Fateh Muhammad sKhan was the vehicle of this petition to the NaibSalar, who has given orders that the former daily parade be reverted to. The Naib Salar was very dissatisfied with the condition of the Government camels at a recent inspection The attendants were fined and flogged, and threaten ed with dismissal if an inspection a month hence did not reveal a very differentiate of affairs. Condition of the Country.—k good deal of indiscriminate looting is m progress iust now A band of some 35 robbers is operating near Robat-i-Kumai, and 15 Afghan robbers, after raiding Assadabad, also approached the former place to attack a caravan. According to the report of sowars of the Governor of Khaf, they retired over the Afghan border. A caravan was looted not long ago between Kasimabadand Fakharabad, 70 miles south of Turbat-i-Haidari and goods to the value of Tumans 3,000 were taken. The Shikaris are again active and comniitting assorted outrages in the Chinaran district. I am informed that a number of carriages with Tehran Persian refugees’for Meshed have been stopped at Shahrud, and according to a later account they have been turned back to Tehran. I was somewhat surprised to learn yesterday the degree of panic which prevails among the Russian non-official population, ascribable partly to the absence of official news and partly to the fantastic bazar rumours which they seem to absorb no less readily than do the.

August 28th. —Lieutenant Turner, 28th Light Cavalry, left Sistan for Shusp. Lieutenant Brenan, Sistan Levy Corps, left Sistan for Birjand with 45 Levy A telegram reached Birjand on the 27th August from Khan Malik to the effect that he was returning, and wished money to be remitted to him for the expenses of his jour tey. If he is coming, I presume it is only for the investiga tion of his charges against his predecessor, Mirza Beza Khan, whom Major Heron and I believe to be innocent of all misdemeanours. On tl e 29th August I heard from Meshed that Mubashshir-ul-Mulk was coming in the place of Basir-us-Saltaneh, whose appointment had first been announced. I have protested strongly to Tehran against this change, as Mubashshir-ul-Mulk’s earlier work in Sistan proved most unsatisfactory. See this Consulate Diary No. 9 of 1914 in particular. See Diary No. 11 . The Sindhi Muhammad, son of Fateh Muhammad, who escaped from custody in this Consulate last March, has surrendered himself to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Meshed. He tried to attach himself to the German Mission at Kabul, so I am informed by the Parsi prisoner Kershasp Hormuz, but he was naturally regarded with suspicion by them. I heard from General Dyer on the 28th instant that he had returned to Khwash after his long expedition against the Damanis. He has directed Colonel Dale to relieve him at Khwash and he hopes in the near future to visit Sistan and Birjand. The wireless installed at Khwash is now working satisfactorily. M. de Bravine has informed Major Heron that a Russian Military Attache is about to join the Vice-Consulate. See Diary No 24 Seth Sulaiman, of Messrs. Muhammad All and Brothers, has returned to Sistan on the completion of his contract. I understand that he has been paid about 30,000 Tumans for the 67 miles of road made by him. It appears that the prospects of running motor lorries between Nushki and Robat are not favourable, as certain sandy sections cannot be kept clear. I hear rumours that a railway from Nushki to Dalbandin is to be constructed at once. (1) A report from Duroh dated the 29th August states that, a section of the Ghazis is still in the neighbourhood of Lash Juwain.

I hear that the reason for Basir-us-Saltaneh’s disinclination Province is that he has accepted service under Hisam-ud-Dauleh in Tehran on 200 Tomans per mensem. to return to this as *private agent A local Disturbance. A serious fracas occurred in Sistan on the 7th instant between Persian soldiery and the Police, arising out of an attack led by Asadullah, Ferrash Bashi of the Customs Department, against the Police Station on the preceding night, in which three Afghan prisoners were released from custody. The Ferrash Bashi who is a Kaini from Sarbisheh had been assisted by his soldier brother and a number of other sarbazes who belonged to the same locality. Asadullah had been placed under open arrest by the Director of Customs pending the assembly of an official Majlis in the afternoon to investigate all the facts of the case. He availed himself of his liberty to lead a second and more violent attack on the Police Station soon after midday. The Deputy Governor, thanks to the presence of his newly raised Baluch soldiers and to the loyalty of the Eevenue gendarmerie, was able to arrest Asadullah and a sarbaz who had actually struck the Rais-i-Nazmieh. These men, on my advice and in my presence at the Deputy Governor’s house, were at once tried and flogged, with the concurrence of the Director of Customs' the Karguzar and the Military Sarhang. The official Majlis, (attended by the Consulate Dragoman) which afterwards met two or three times, found that the Sultan and the Naib of the Sarbazes were privy to the outrage and that the Sarhang himself had been remiss in his duty. All these three officers are therefore under arrest at the Deputy Governor’s residence, pending the collection of compensation for the Police Department and the Rais-i-Nazmieh for the damages suffered by them. It is unfortunate that out of about 200 sarbazes here, 150 are Kainis from the neighbourhood of Sarbisheh and adherents of Shaukat-ul-Mulk. Asadullah, the Ferrash Bashi, is notorious for his heavy drinking and for his truculence generally. He was the chief active participant in the outrage of December 1913 against the camel-men taking Colonel Haig’s baggage to Meshed. I tried my utmost then to get him punished but he got off scot-free as the Provincial Director of Customs in Khorassan professed inability to interfere between Tehran and Sistan, and the Tehran authorities seemed satisfied with the transfer of M. Paquet and the Chief Mirza Mubashshir-ul-Mulk, who were both apparently afraid to punish Asadullah. The Director of Customs, I hear, has independently wired to Meshed recommend ing Asadullah’s dismissal or transfer. An identical recommendation had been made by me. It is gratifying to report that in this case all the leading Persian officials, (other than Military) seem to have acted harmoniously and in support of the Deputy Governor ; the acting Revenue Director and the Telegraph Master took a particu larly active part in the second and later sittings of the Majlis. Afghan Ghazis. I heard on 5th September from Koh Malik Siah and from Chahar Burjak that 40 Afghan jambazes were proceeding to Afghan Robat for the purpose of attack ing some convoy on the Trade Route or rescuing our German prisoner.

No. 73 m 1916 Meshed Diary No. 34, for the week ending the 19th August 1916. Per wan ojficialsr Nasir-us-Saltana, son of Mohtasham-us-Saltana, late Minis ter for Foreign Affairs and himself an employe of the Foreign Department at Tehran, is reported to be a candidate for the post of Kcifguzar at Meshed. I visited and received a visit from Mushar-us-galtana during the week. The Tumans 7,000 pishkash leaven is working as might be expected and he is accumu lating much evidence of the moral turpitude of Shuja-ud-Daula, to add to which the conduct of the latter in whipping up telegrams from tribesmen, merchants, and others extolling his virtues is taken as an additional serious offence. Shuia will probably be summoned to Meshed shortly—he has already been told to come but pretexted urgent business—but it is very unlikely that he will yield to any argument save force majeure. On the other hand his successor-designate was very oppressive when Governor of Turbat-i-Haidari in 1913 and among other things entertained a tame brigand who committed the indiscretion of holding up the Guides Cavalry relief for the Meshed Consular Guard, an action which resulted in the capture of himself and several of his men by the incensed sowars ! From reports of one sort and another which have reached me there seems little doubt that Mutassam-us-Saltana, the new Sistan Karguzar, is intriguing against Hissam-ud-Daula in favour of Shaukat-ul-Mulk, and that he had a hand in the Birjand fracas with the object of discrediting Hissam. When here he was heard to say that he would do his best to ensure the reinstatement of Shaukat, and in his report on the Birjand affair he threw the whole blame on the shoulders of Hissam. The Karguzar of Persian Sarakhs has telegraphed to both the Governor General and the Ministry of the Interior, protesting against the recall of the Governor at the present moment when the frontier is very unsettled. To the Governor-General he has said that the Governor will come in with pishkash shortly. The present policy of the Governor-General in recalling every Governor or responsible official, good, bad, or indifferent, merely to profit by the pisJikash of their successors, or the amount they are willing to pay to retain their appointments, cannot but have the worst effect on the condition of the country. A case in point | is that of Shaji-us-Saltana (Haji Abbas Khan—Diary No. 33) who not only took the field against the Kaudani Ilbaigi and recovered looted flocks, but who has now, as will be seen from this diary, rendered us an important service, and I took the opportunity of impressing both on Mushar-us-Saltana and the Russian Consul-General my sense of the obligation under which his action has placed us. Basir-us-Saltana did not return to Birjand but continued his journey to Tehran from Meamai. Persian affairs. —The quarrel of Aghazada with the Shrine officials, in addition to the maukufa matters in dispute, was complicated by a personal quarrel between Rukn-ut-Taulia and the Aghazada. The former is reported to have paid the head Munshi of the Russian Consulate-General Tumans 300 to secure his interest in the matter, but if this be true the money appears to have been wasted as M. Nikolski, to whom the contending parties appealed, informs me that they have effected a reconciliation in accordance with his advice. The Governor-General, who now employs an official seal engraved ‘ Ayalat-i- Khorasan-i-Sistan” has called on the Raid-i-Knshun oi Birjand for an explanation of the part taken by his men in the recent affair. . ^ Khan Malik left Meshed for Tehran a few days ago. I understand that he will be stopped by the Russians at Shahrud and searched as he is suspected of pro- German sympathies. British affairs. —The offer of Dabir-us-Sultan to arrange the payment of an instalment of Tumans 5,000 on account of the debt of Shuja-ud-Daula to the Imperial Bank has been accepted, but in the light of the almost certain dismissal from office2 of the debtor it is very doubtful iftheaffair will go through. If it does not I cannot ask the Governor-General to suspend his action with regard to longer as on the face of it he has reason to be dissatisfied with the latter s conduct «-v-f o-ffcnva Russian affairs.—Paschen had possessed a paper on which was entered the names of the various druggists at Meshed (among them the American dispensary, which pointed to the innocuous nature of the document) On the initiative of the Russian military rgent, but against the judgment of the Consul-General, a per- quisition of the various shops was made and all correspondence carried oft. A othmg of the slightest incriminatory character was found. There is still uneasiness in Turkistant regarding the call for military labour, and there seems some chance that with an unfavourable conjunction of circum stances an outbreak might occur. The Russians are apparently _ taking precautions and the arrival of 200 Cossacks with machine guns at Sarakhs in this connection is renorted. It is also stated that the Governor of Tejend with the General Officer Commanding, 2nd Army Corps, recently visited that place. Turkomans continue to purchase arms on the Persian side of the frontier, and I have informed the Russian authorities of such details as have come my way Arrivals from the Caucasus also report unrest in this particular among the Musulman population. The Baluchis settled near Garmab are a possible source of trouble. A number of troops are reported to have passed along the Central Asian Railway from east to west but it is not very clear as to whence they have come as under present circumstances any considerable weakening of Turkistan or Transcaspian garrisons is unlikely. The'dispute of certain Russian subjects with Nusrat-ul-Mulk over Zorabad lands has been settled by the purchase for Tumans 2,450 by the Ilbaigi of Nusrat-ul-Mulk of the lands in question. Bokharan subjects at Meshed have been attending the Russian Consulate General with the object of securing the election of a new Tajir-Bashi. The first Secretary to the Russian Consulate-General was robbed a few nights ago, probably by his servants, of a box containing valuables to the amount of Tumans400. The Bais-i-Nazmia has just presented him with the sum in question, having levied contributions on the entire police force to stimulate their energies. He is an energetic man and his men appear to spend the night strung out at short intervals in the streets whistling like marmots. It is possible, however, that this practice discloses their presence to would-be malefactors. Persian and German intrigues .—Some months ago I placed a man whom we had previously employed at 'Turbt-i-Sheikh Jam to watch for passing Germans. He has been successful in detecting a party of four German adherents, and with the assistance of Shaji-us-Saltana arrested them. Our agent from Kariz proceeded to the spot and asked the Russian agent for Cossacks to take them to Kariz. Three Indians are reported among the party. Saiyid Yunis, Zia Khan, and Jan Muhammad—the latter most probably being the remaining bomb-expert since the capture of Hormuz and Abdul Aziz at Sehdeh. The fourth is a Turk, named Mirza Agha, who was arrested during the course of last year at Khaf by the Russians, but liberated for lack of evidence. No further particulars have yet reached me. I have arranged with the Russian military and political authorities that the prisoners be sent at once to Turbat-i-Haidari, where our agent can assist at an investigation, and that the captured Indians be sent subsequently under Russian escort to Rum to be handed over to our troops. The medicine-seller Mirza Hussain and the Shrine electrician Haji Amir are among the most energetic of the democrats in anti-Russian propaganda. There is talk of a general meeting but none has yet been held. The only points of interest in the protocol of Paschen’s interrogatory sup- I plied me by the Russian military rgent, beyond those already reported, are that the mission received favourable answers both from the Amir and the Governor of Herat to their letters requesting permission to enter Afghanistan, and that they awaited these before starting. Also that, according to Paschen, some fortification had been commenced at Kabul and 150,000 recruits had been enlisted.Mainly m connection with German parties, General Loginov has decide,! to post a supp ementary cordon to be in position by the 23rd August. The numb™ of men employed is not large, being 40 men under an officer at Turbat-i-ShriH, Jam, 10 men at Abbasabad 6 men extra at Kariz, where the Russian aaent at present has about 10 Cossacks, 10 men at Karat, nnd 6 men at Rui Khaf. 6 News from Turbat-i-Haidan.— Z a U-us-Su\tm, of Tabas was arrested by the Russians at Tun on suspicion. His Tun colleague havina with him, according to rumour, some £200 obtained from the Germans at Tabas last year, proceeded to Turbat-i-Haidari to the Russian Consul to secure his friend’s release, in which he has apparently been successful. The Russian Consul and the Governor have not yet exchanged calls although the latter has now been there some time. The question as to who should call first has been referred to Meshed. Such conduct at the present time is extraordinarily childish, and is not calculated to further our objects. Colonel Gustchin has return ed to Turbat-i-Haidari on the expiration of his leave, and M. Samsonov has left for Turbat-i-Jam in connection with the new Cossack cordon. News from Kariz. —A Customs sowar was attacked by Afghan robbers bpfwppn Khaf and Kariz and robbed of his horse and rifle. Six mahallas of the Taimuris who followed the Kaudani Ilbaigi to Afghanistan have returned, apparently more or less as fugitives, and have come to Jamrud whence they are going to Mir Bald Sultan at Gak. Muhammad Sarwar Khan, the head of the Hashtadani gang, is evidently alarmed at the coming of Shuja-ul-Mulk and has written to the latter’s son to make his peace. The son — Mustafa Kuli Khan—^replied that he must await his father’s arrival. Muhammad Sarwar Khan has apparently fallen out with other robbers, A band of 12 of these robbers have carried away four inhabitants of Rizah as hostages for four of their number arrested by Mustafa Kuli Khan. Customs sowars of Jam and Kariz have arrested a smuggler Muhammad Umar who was avoiding the main route. He is said to have rifles and a large number of gold rubles with him. News from Herat. —The party from Kandahar is confirmed as consisting of three Austrians only. Of one of these, who goes by the name of “ Jawas,” there has been previous mention, as he went to Kabul from Herat. Among their eight servants are said to be two Indian cooks, the remainder being Persians and Berberis. They have not received any pay from their masters for three months, but were recently given one month’s pay on account and told to be careful of it as their masters had little cash and no means of receiving more. Some of the servants are thinking of making off, and a man known to me is said to be trying to assist them to come here. Two of this party are reported to have made off to Sistan on riding camels, making for Kirmam No details as regards dates, identity, etc., have been given, but I have telegraphed this item to Sistan on the off-chance of its affording a clue. It is reported that sowars of the Governor of Sabzvar have brought in a Euro pean, either German of Austrian, who was trying to pass into Persia, but who had n© pass. He had made an unsuccessful attempt to escape by the way. He was sent to Shuja-ud-Daula at the Bagh-i-Karta by the Naib-ul-HuJcumat. From the fact that the mules of the Austrians are exercised daily and well fed with barley it is thought that they are to be used shortly in an attempt to leave the country. A rumour is current that the Amir has a secret understanding with the Germans at variance with his apparent line of conduct and that the presence of the Mehmmidar .'Shuja-ud-Daula with the party has considerable significance. 9 The Naib-ul-Hukumat has directed that the infantry company which supplies his orderlies should be relieved from a different battalion every two months, instead of remaining as at present an indefinite time at this duty.4 Some soldiers who accompanied the late I'M ^ Amjf tdio to Kabul have returned and reported that he is in great favour with the A &gt; ho has K appointed him Naib Salar at Kabul. Muhammad Sarwar Khan, the late Governor of Herat, has as yet received no appointment. Coal is reported to exist at Karokh and the Naib-ul-Hukumat has sent orders for specimens to be sent in for trial in the workshops. A suspicious foreigner, either an Indian or Arab, who was anxious to go to the Bagh i-Sa, was recLty arrested by the Kotwal. Orders have, however, been given for his deportation to Persia by the Kafir Kala road. E. A. F. REDL, Lieutenant-Colonel, G.

I have heard a story that two Germans with a guide had left Kandahar some time ago to march along the Arghandab river. They were attacked by robbers and looted of all their property, and the guide was killed. The Germans succeeded in making their way back to Kandahar, A Perso-Afghan Affray, A strange affair (even in the eyes of the unsophisticated Sistanis) occurred on the 12th August. There are nowadays 12 Afghan Military posts along the frontier between Mirabad and Deh Ali Mardan (a distance of 24 miles), to prevent un authorised crossings, even by villagers, who have until lately never been interfered with One of these detachments, comprising a Havildar and six sepoys, raided the Persian village of Milak en masse and attempted to carry off all the cattle. They shot the Persian Kadkhuda’s son, in retaliation for which the Persians claim to have killed one Afghan soldier and wounded another. The Afghans returned m greater force at night but found that Zaman Khan, the Kadkhuda, had discreetly removed all his people from the village. A remonstrance was duly addressed to the Chakhansur authorities, and a rather heated correspondence ehsued between the Deputy Governor of Sistan and the Karauzar who at present acts as Sarhaddar, owmg to the former suggesting to the latter that he should personally proceed to Chakhansur and expedite the settle ment of the case. On the 15th August, the Afghan authorities (Governor and Brigadier) sent then Karauzar, Abdu! Samad Khan, to Sistan to discuss the case w, h the Persian Karri,izar No settlement was reached and the Afghan returned to kala Kang on the 17 th August The Karguzar has been telegraphing to Tehran a good deal on the subject. I have not as yet learned what his proposals are. The Afghan Karguzar. A rather unfortunate incident followed upon the recent arrival of Aldus Samad Khan in Sistan.

Neivsfrom Afghanistan* (1) From Duroh I hear that the new Governor of Anardarra has arrested an Afghan named Khwaja Abdulla of Kala Kah for raiding into Kainat and killing a British subiectA Two of the man’s companions, named Khwaja Muhammad and Khwaja Kahmatullah, are said to have fled to Nahrud in Persian territory. It seems possible that the Governor is acting on some old repiesentation from Meshed concerning the murder of Hotak in 1914— for last reference see my Diary No. 27 of 1915; (2) Various news-reporters have expressed the opinion that the new Governor of Chakhansur will not be so friendly, or rather so neutral, towards our cause as Haji Sherdil Khan has beem A letter from Niedermeyer, which has been found among the papers of Voigt and his companions, confirms the report (see Diary No. 30) that the three Indians, or perhaps the two Austrians, Chaush and Grosser, had complained against the outgoing Governor.

Persian Officials. —The Karguzar has received a telegram from the Minister of Foreign Affairs ordering him to Tehran to confer on important matters and to appoint an official to act in his place. Mushar-as-Saltana has also heard from Tehran to the effect that the Karguzar is dismissed and has been instructed to arrange for the work to be carried on. {Secret).—Hhe Karguzar has sent a long telegram in cypher to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs stating that Birjand and the Kainat are in a bad condition, that the Perso-Afghan frontier is in a disturbed state, that the failure of the executive to despatch Shuja-ul-Mulk to the frontier is responsible for the prevailing disorder, and that the Governor-General and ffiis satellites are so busy filling their pockets that they pay no attention to public affairs. Although obviously prompted by pique, there is more than a substratum of truth in these strictures as far as this province is concerned. The Mullas of Meshed, headed by the Aghazada, and the traders under Rais-ut-Tujjar have petitioned Tehran against the Karguzar, and heads of departments have joined in the general outcry. Murtaza Kuli, Governor of Sabzawar, has returned to his post. He had no ready money with which to propitiate the Governor-General and has accordingly entered into an undertaking to pay him Tumans 100 per mensem—half the amount of his monthly salary—for the next twelve months. Iktadar-ul-Mulk, Governor of Kelat-i-Nadiri ; has been summoned to Meshed and dismissed, partly in connection with some adaliyat cases against him. Fateh-ul-Mulk, brother of Haji Shuja-ul-Mulk, succeeds him on the payment of Tumans 1,500. Shaji-ul-Ayala has definitely retired from the candidature for the Governorship of Khaf, and Muhammad Hassan Khan is said to have been appointed. The Khafis at Turbat-i-Haidari have been besieging our Agent to save them from this gentleman of whom, apparently, they had bitter experience in the past, and our Agent states that the Russian Consul has protested against this appointment. As a mere business transaction Zulfikar Khan, who would be acceptable to the people, would put up the same amount of pishJcash. Mustafa Mirza came to make his adieus to me before starting for Turbat-i-Haidari. He is prepared for intrigues by his predecessor, but as I hear that the latter has now left Turshiz for Tehran it is possible that he has abandoned hope of regaining the appointment. Khan Malik, late Chief of the Maliyat in Sistan and Kain, has reached Meshed. Persian Affairs. —In consequence of pressure brought to bear by both Consulates-General the Governor-General has prevailed on Shuja-ul-Mulk to leave for the frontier, and the latter paid me a farewell visit yesterday. He is, however, taking no sowars from here, and will be obliged to do the best he can with his own people on the spot. This will of course cost money and unless some settlement of his arrears and satisfactory arrangement for the future can be arrived at no permanent improvement can be hoped for. Nusrat-ul-Mulk, who was confined by the Governor-General for some days in the Ark on account of a claim against him by certain Russian subjects of Zorabad, has settled the affair by the payment of Tumans 500 and has been released. Dependants of the Rais-ut-Tuiiar domiciled in Kasimabad and in the Zafranlu Kurd district have refused payment of revenue, on which the maliyat confiscated their crops. A consequent fracas is not improbable. Presumably on account of congestion of the premises, something in the nature of a gaol delivery is in progress. Three thieves, one after undergoing amputation \ Hs ;3-vad on ' '&gt; 0GI 1316 with j INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S 1 Letter. No. Mof a hand and the others the severance of tendons, were set at liberty. Apparently others are to be operated on in the near future. British Affairs.—^' Governor-General expressed regret that he had not recovered the instalments due from Shuja-ud-Daula to the Imperial Bank of Persia but hoped to be able to do so within 20 days. I propose to broach the matter when visiting him to-day. Local detective talent has so far failed to discover the perpetrators of a burglary committed near the end of Ramadan at the residence of the accountants of the Imperial Bank, when these gentlemen were absent but a serbaz guard and servants were sleeping on the premises. Household property valued at lumans 80 was taken, and a claim has been submitted to the Karguzan. Russian Affairs.— According to reports from Kuchan, Dabir-us-Sultan, a Russian protege and owner of some 17 villages between Ruchan and fehirwan, is acquiring land in a very high-handed manner As he has the ear of the Russian Agent he has considerable local influence and the Governor is said to be more or less in his hands. Recently the Governor-General despatched ten mamurs to effect the arrest of Kerbelai Hassan, son of the late Haji Muhammad Ibrahim, and Dabir-us-Sultan had sufficient influence to prevent it up to the present. Thirteen armed Turkomans, described as jigits, recently came to purchase sheep at Kelat-i-Nadiri for conveyance to Russian territory. Many reports are reaching me that the Russians are instituting a recruiting campaign among various tribes of Turkomans. As the Turkoman horse regiment has been closely engaged on the Western front there is, no doubt, much wastage to make good. On the other hand the Turkomans are said to be very unwilling to supply recruits, asking what has happened to those already sent, and according to native rumour any attempt at forcible enlistment may provoke an outbreak. The native population of Turkistan and Transcaspia is also said to be uneasy in this respect. As, even long before the war, rumours were current that the Musalman population was to serve in the army, there is nothing surprising in a recrudescence of them at the present time. I am informed that the Russians have placed Turkomans along the frontier to look out for fugitive Germans, 15 men having been posted between Ak Robat and Pul-i-Khatun and another 15 near the latter place. The Prsitav of Sarakhs has made a tour of inspection of posts. Other Turkomans have also been placed among the Baluchis living inside the Russian border near Ak Robat to keep a watch on their proceedings. To some extent this is closing the stable^door after the horse is stolen, but any improvement in.vigil ance is 1° welcomed. Persian and German Intrigues. —Paschen was brought to Meshed at the end of last week and is shortly to be despatched to Tiflis. He has been undergoing frequent interrogatories at the hands of the Russian Military Agent, the completed results of which are promised me. M. Nikolski and I interviewed him at some length in the course of the week, and he answered most questions with apparent frankness, though no doubt some statements were made with an ulterior object. He is a man of considerable enterprise as the fact that since reaching Herat early last year he returned on three occasions into Persia, twice to Isfahan passing by Tabas, and the third time to Tehran, where he spent last Christmas, proves. His theory that the nearer to the enemy one goes the safer one is has served him well, his capture on the present occasion, due to the Rais-i-Nazmiah of Tabas who had previously helped him, being fortuitous. When going to Tehran he travelled by the ordinary post-waggon in his usual costume, merely removing his military buttons, etc., from Sharifabad and back, along the line of Cossack posts to Sabzawar and through Shahrud, without undergoing any question at the hands of the Cossacks. On the present occasion he passed with his interpreter and servant a little to the south of Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam and was resting at Daulatabad when Cossacks from Kariz actually conversed with his servant. Near Turbat-i-Haidari he passed a Cossack patrol on a parallel track 200 yards off ; his servants wanted him to make off but he saw that a bold course was the only safe one and proceeded quietly onhis way, the Cossacks, beyond looking in his direction, taking no further notice I have brought these statements to the notice of General Loginov who is isstiinv strict orders m the matter and as an increase of zeal in the future is to be expected it would be advisable that any British travellers along Cossack cordons should be provided with passes in Russian on which it would be as well to specify any arms earned. Ismail the interpreter escaped at Tabas before the arrival of the Cossacks— no doubt by collusion with the Rais-i-Nazmia as he was confined in the same r “ m “ Paschen. t According to a statement of the latter, made at Turbat, this official offered to let him go for Tumans 5,000 but as the money was not forthcoming he preferred the safer course, merely retaining Paschen’s remaining gold—£120— and his armoury. The servant Amin and a Persian guide borke out from a hut near Tun where they were confined by the Cossack escort. Paschen said he had no papers but if any such existed it is probable that Ismail, who was to make for Baghdad, took them with him. The Germans who entered Afghanistan with him were Cap Hentig, Focht (Vogt?), Wagner, and Reyer, as well as a Turk an Indian “ Prince ” whom they addressed as “ Kumar Sahib. 51 persons are mentioned in Herat reports this week. According to Paschen the Germans were thoroughly disgusted with the pusillanimous conduct of the Amir, and left in consequence. The statement that the remaining Germans were likely to await the end of the war in Herat was most probably made to disarm suspicion. I hope to receive the necessary documents in time to furnish a detailed report of his statements by next week. A report from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam states that two Germans crossed the Persian frontier apparently about the 20th instant, and having disguised themselves in Kalat-i- Darwish, a village neur Jamrud, started for Meshed. It is also reported that, two Turks crossed near Zulfikar and made for Meshed. P ° News from Turbat-i-Haidari.—The Russian Consul has sent his congratulations to Mustafa Mirza on his appointment, and begs him to start as soon as possible. News from Kariz—The telegram regarding the raid on Hindu village is confirmed. Apparently the Customs office was looted and the official fled. Other villages have been threatened by the Hashtadani robbers. Mustafa Kuli Khan, a son of Shuja-ul-Mulk, had arrived at Mohsinabad and was collecting Bakharzi and Hazara sowars although hampered by want of funds. Bahluri Taimuris, fearing reprisals of the Hashtadanis, have dispersed, some proceeding to Aliyak, and others to Arzana in the Bala Wilayet of Bakharz/ ■The Hashtadanis raided flocks at Tayabat, but on the arrival of some of Mustafa Kuli Khan’s men fled, abandoning their booty. They subsequently extorted money with threats from villagers of Karat. Some dissensions are said to have arisen among them. News from Herat .—Although various reports giving the arrival of all German parties have come to hand during the week, the newswriter at Herat, writing on the 27th ultimo, states that the arrival of the Turkistan Ge]man party on the'evening of the 21st ultimo is the only one that has taken place. The size of the escort and the number of retinue and animals are no doubt responsible for the other statement especially as the neighbourhood ofjthe Bagh-i-Kartah, where they are accommodated , is closely guarded. Actually only one German officer, who passes by the name* of “ Masrur,” with three Austrians, has arrived, their progress from Kabul somewhat resembling the little nigger boys of the nursery rhyme. On the authority of a person accompanying the party, four German officers and several Austrians originally started from Kabul via Turkistan. As soon as this province was reached a German officer known as “ Rais ” (most probably Rever) disappeared mysteriously on foot. Four days later four of the Austiians departed with equal mystery and apparently also on foot. One stage before Mazar-i-Sharif a second German officer left with a Persian servant. He was an expert Pushtu scholar and is, I take it, the man whom my agent followed to Chacha. ;ain Niedermeyer, ? Kazim Beg and Several of these4 arriving at Herat is accounreu iux their mounts. Masrur was acco: ponies, and an escort of 33 sowari and 44 sowars from Maim: na. * Masrur mmseu is a siuve^x ^ swimming on the way, is taken for a naval omcer. Having heard nothing of the arrival of the Kandahar party the Naib-ul-Hulcuma sent an express rider in the direction of Ghor with a letter addressed to Habibu lah Khan Achakzai, the Ghulam Bacha of the Kandahar party, enquiring as to their movements. Focht is reported with this party. Kazim Beg and the Indian prince are said to have remained at Kabul, as well as Maulvi Karamat-ulla. A caravan between Kala Nao and Pul-i-Pari has been robbed. A renort having reached the Naib-ul-HuJcuiunt that a gang of thieves were quartered in the shrine of Gazargah, he rode with an escort in person to the place and laid five thieves by the heels, others escaping to the hills. Amongst those arrested is one Mangal Khan, described as a British subject. A trader having been robbed at Pul-i-Malan, solars have been sent to trace the thief or in default to recover a fine from the villagers. The Naib-ul-Hukumat has ordered that the Kaudani Ilbaigi be furnished with letters of recommendation. The Naib Solar has received a farman from the Muin-us-Saltana that Herat battalions are to consist of 400 rank and file. The establishment of officers is to be one Colonel, one Kumaidan, four captains, and four subadars. In the artillery a captain is to command each section of guns with two jamadars to assist. Officers are rejoice I at this change as it means increased promotion. Condition of Country .—The Amin-i-Tazkara of Bakharz reports to the Karguzaf that life and property in this district are unsafe owing to the Hashtadani robbers. Zafranlu Kurds have telegraphed to Meshed complaining of the tyranny of Shuja-ud-Daula. It is possible that this is a manifestation of an intrigue by Bais-i -Tujj ar. E. A. F.

Persian Officials-The Kargumr paid his farewell visit in a very chastened tame of mmd and left for Tehran on the 9th instant. Up till the last moment he contemplated sending in a telegram asking for his retention, sealed by many I visited the Governor-General early in the week. Among other matters which came under discussion was the condition of Bakharz and the question of entertainment of somws under Shuja-ul-Mulk in which he requested our support I pointed out that both the Russian Consul-General and I had brought the matter more than once to the notice of our respective Legations, and that no doubt it would be attended to in due course. The best course of action for recovering the Imperial Banks instalments from Shuja-ud-Daula was also discussed. Mushar-us-Saltana, on visiting me shortly afterwards, stated that his work was now progressing favourably and he hoped to meet with no more interior opposition. He nolds the seals of the karguzari, and the work will be actually transacted by the Muaven under his direction. y Muazziz-ud-Daula is, with some effrontery, hopeful of returning here as Karguzar, and is desirous of enlisting the Consulates-General on his side There was question earlier in the week of the dismissal of Shuia-ud-Daula from the Governorship of Kuchan and his replacement by Adal-ud-Daula who would pay Tumans 7,000 for the post. Certain matters which the Russian Consul General had been pressing against the former having been adjusted, the affair is still unsettled though it is probable that the Governor-General will find difficulty in resigning so rich a pishkash. I requested him to postpone the change if possible till some agreement had been arrived at relative to the settlement of the Imperial Bank s debt, as if its recovery is difficult now, it would be one hundred times more so if Shuja-ud-Daula be ejected at this moment. Haji Abbas Khan, head of the Taimuris at Turbat-i-She ikh Jam, has been summoned to Meshed by the Governor-General, who is credited with the intention of appointing his brother in his place. I am informed that Basir-us-Saltana, late JRais-i-Maliyat of Sistan, who had reached Meamai on his way to Tehran, has received orders to return to enquire into the matter of the late fracas at Birjand. Persian Affairs. —There is some matter relating to wakf property in dispute between the Aghazada and the Shrine officials, and the latter, who are trying to turn the AgJmzada out of Meshed, apparently have the ear of the Governor-General. As far as I am aware the Aghazada has always been on good terms with, and has assisted, both Consulates-General here. The students in the city are strongly in his favour. Mnshar-us-Saltana has written to the Sistan Karguzar that on the receipt of his telegrams steps have been taken to prevent a recurrence of the acts which led to the fracas at Birjand, and he hopes that matters will soon be set right. The police at Daragez have shot a thief confined in the prison there, who, according to their account, was brought out of prison to shew where he had con- 'cealed stolen property, and then endeavoured to escape. A number of malefactors have been released from prison here after the fingers of their right hands had been severed. British Affairs.- —As intimated above, the money owing to the Imperial Bank by Shuja-ud-Daula is proving difficult of immediate recovery. I have just received telegrams from Shuja-ud-Daula and Dabir-us-Sultan on the matter, in which it is stated that the former is unable to pay two instalments amounting to Tumans 10,000 at once but Dabir-us-Sultan is willing to insure the payment of Tumans 5,000 C428FI) !

The proposal will be submitted to the Manager, Imperial Bank of Persia, at Meshed.- Russian Affaivs- —I heard from Sistan that the Russian telegraphists have been objecting to the use of the telephones during a very restricted time in the day by our troops, and requested the Russian Consul-General s mediation. He has ascertained that there will be no objection to their use for 01 dinary military purposes before 7 a.m. and after 9 p.m. daily. He stated that the same difficul ties had occurred with their own troops. I received a petition for assistance in the case of three Berberis who had been disarmed by the Russians, brought to Meshed, and imprisoned, apparently as the result of a quarrel with a Russian subject. I have requested the Russian authorities for information on the subject, but Berberis have been lawless lately, and it is quite possible that these individuals are in the wrong. A reliable agent who had proceeded to the frontier near Pul-i-Khatun in connection with Hun fugitives, thought so seriously of the demeanour of certain Sarakhs Turkomans who were not only buying rifles on the Persian side of the frontier, but also holding meetings at which resistance to the Russian authorities was mooted, (in which case it seems likely that they would have the assistance of the border Afghans in that region), that he returned post-haste to inform me,, and I have passed on the information to the Russian Consulate-General for such action as they wish to take. During the whole of the week the Musulman recruiting stories mentioned last week have been growing in intensity, and Musulman Russian subjects here have been foremost in strong anti-Russian talk. Early in the week rumours of serious disorders in Turkistan, destruction on the railway, etc., have been rife and great excitement on this account prevails. The actual facts of the case are that manual labour in rear of the armies is a necessity at the present moment for the repair of railways, bridges and other work. The scheme for attracting labourers from Persia proved a failure, and the Russian authorities called on the Musulman population of Turkistan and Transcaspia for a supply of labourers. This was actually believed to be, or twisted by agitators into, a demand for recruits for the field armies, and caused great alarm and opposi tion. Rioting occurred at Jizak and Samarkand, which was repressed by troops, I understand from Russian official sources* without difficulty, and the demand for the labourers has been affirmed by the authorities who are continuing their scheme undeterred by the opposition. There appear no grounds for believing that damage has been done to the line.- At the same time this agitation at the present moment is unfortunate. T^e gar risons at the frontier points of Sarakhs and Pul-i-Khatun, which had fallen very low, have been slightly increased and now stand at about 100 and 50 Russians respectively. A battalion is reported to have been taken from Kushk for suppres sion of disorder. The mail-cart between Sarakhs and Tejend is reported to have been looted recently by robbers. Persian and German intrigues. —The local Democrats are much gheered by exaggerations of events in North-West Persia which have reached them, and look forward to a Persian republic in the near future. They are holding no regular meetings as yet. One Talib Khan of Sabzavar, who had distinguished himself by anti-Russian propaganda, was arrested by the Karguzar with a view to deportation but was released by the connivance of the Rais-i-Nazmia. Acrimonious correspondence on his account has had the effect of embroiling the central Karguzar and Rais-i- Nazmia here. Since the promulgation of the new order by General Loginov great zeal is being exercised by the Cossacks in searching all travellers on the Tehran road, at Fakhr-i-Daud, Bagh-i-Shah, and Shorab. News from Anm.—Sarwar Khan is repairing the old fort at Hashtadan with the object of defending himself there against his enemies. He has received 24 rifles from Herat.3 Mir Baki Sultan has sent a message to the Russian agent at Kariz savins that he wishes to make his peace with the Russians. He recently sent ™ a message to the same effect which I communicated to the Russian Consul-General who is inclined to accord the favour asked on guarantees of future |ood behaviour A report has been received that Sultan Khan son of Gul Muhammad Khan earned away a woman of the Haftbala, a section of the Alizai Afghans—some 50 families of whom are domiciled in Hashtadan, with another 200 families in Ghurian. The Haftbala assembled to attack Sultan Khan who joined Sarwar KW and a fight is said to be in progress. * The railway engineer is reported to be carrying out hia investigationa near Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam. News from Herat—The German officer and Austrians in the Bagh-i-Karta, which is on the Kandahar road, have been doing much riding, chiefly towarda Kandahar, escorted by cavalry sowars. The Austrians, who are infantrymen, are thought to be being given instruction in riding, with a purpose. The neighbourhood of the garden is very strictly guarded and great secrecy is observed, any persona employed in the vicinity being warned that curiosity will be severely punished. While out riding one of the sowars asked an Austrian what they intended to do, with apparently no arriere pensee, but on return he was reported, arrested, and'very severely beaten by orders of the Naih Salar, who pressed him to confess the name of the person who had told him to ask the question. He replied that it was an idle question, on which the Naib Salar ordered that he should be imprisoned and beaten daily till he confessed. The servants of this party are buying up gold rubles. They have also ordered Jews to obtain Turkish gold for them, as their masters will shortly require it. On the other hand guard huts are being built for the escort and the German officer is said to be gardening l The correct name of the ghulam bacha of this party is Shuja-ud-Daula. He is a young man of about 20, intelligent and said to be devoted to the Amir, with whom he is a great favourite. The Naib-ul-Hukumat received a reply on the 1st instant to his letter to the ghulam bacha of the Kandahar party, Habibulla Khan Achakzai. He gave the itinerary of his party as Ghor, (where one German was said to have disappeared), Tulak, Adraskand, Anardara, and Sabzvar, whence they were coming to Herat. As it was heard that they would arrive on the 6th instant, the Naib-ul-Hukumat ordered his master-of-ceremonies, with an escort, to meet the party at the Pul- i-Sabzvar. A report despatched on the night of the 6th instant, which reached me yesterday, says they actually arrived on the evening of that day, but that the party consisted solely of three Austrians and three Indians. Vogt was known to have disappeared by the way but nothing is yet known of any others. They were met by their comrades of the northern party and escorted to the Bagh-i-Karta. One of the Austrians wo arrived with the northern party is said to be an escaped prisoner-of-war who reached Herat from Bala Murghab and who was subsequently sent to Kabul as an expert wireless telegraphist. He gives himself out to be the son of an important merchant. The party is reputed to have had 120 baggage ponies on setting out from Kabul, of which only 80 reached Herat, and it is surmised that the balance went with members of the party who separated by the way. The Amir is reported to have sent a German {sic) from Kabul with 200 sappers to open up a gold-mine discovered at Tulak by one of the Germans. If this discovery relates to the tour of the Kandahar party, as is probable, it would point to the presence of Niedermeyer, as he is an expert geologist, and it was (officially) to obtain material for an ambitious work on the subject that he visited Khorasan in 1913. Other sources than the newswriter state that several Germans fiom the Kandahar party disappeared by the way, but the name of Vogt is the 011 ly one given. One informant says that some Germans from this party went to Gulran.The Naib-ul-Hukumat has deputed four Khans to insure immunity from robberies on the roads of Badghiz. They will be held responsible for any that occur. A faction fight occurred between the Nurzai and Achakzai, in which two men were killed and others wounded. At the request of the Governor of Sabzvar, the Naib-ul-Hukumat despatched a special mamur to investigate the affair. The latter returned with two headmen of each section, who have been imprisoned pending enquiries. The Naib-ul-Hukumat has had photographs taken of the Mus’alla, the 'Ark, the Jama Masjid, andlhe shrine of Gargazah, but whether as a souvenir for the Germans or as an offering to the Amir is not known. Owing to the ’Id there is little general news from Herat this week. Condition of the country. —Prices for bread and other necessaries in Meshed have been to some extent reduced. The Governor-General has forbidden the export of sugar, and all merchants are doing their best to get round this edict. As indicated above, the most exaggerated reports, both regarding the move ments of the Turks and the state of affairs in Turkistan, are rife. Shuja-ul-Mulk has left for Bakharz, and pending the sanction to a sufficient establishment of frontier sowars will do his best to restore order. It is reported that Shuja-ud-Daula has taken steps to remedy the oppression of the people of Shirwan by his Naih-ul-Hukumat, and also that he intends to lay hands on Farhad Khan, a robber, disposing of some 150 sowars, on the demand of the Kussian Consul-General, but this requires further confirmation. The Khoris of Kelat-i-Nadiri have rebelled against the Governor and as they have fortified themselves at Khor he is unable to arrest them or to stop raids on their part, E, A. F.

Appendix to Meshed Diary No. 33 for week ending the 12th August 1916. Protocol of the interrogatory of the German subject, Wilhelm Paschen, Captain in the 89th Regiment of the German Army, 31st July 1916. “ I arrived in Persia about one year and three months ago by Baghdad, Kasr-i- Shirin and Kermanshah. There were 12 of us : Captain Niedermeyer, Lieutenant Hentig, Captain Wagner, Lieutenant Focht (Vogt), Lieutenant Reyer, Military Surgeon Niedeitoeyer, Acting Consul at Isfahan Seiler, Lieutenant Paschen of the 89th Regiment (my brother), Lieutenant Winklemann, Dr. Bekker, and a Turkish officer Captain Kazim Beg. We came to Persia in order to pass through to Afghan istan, to which country we were entrusted with a Mission by the German Emperor and the Sultan of Turkey. Seven of us reached Afghanistan, i.e., Niedermeyer (Captain), Hentig, Wagner, Focht, Reyer, and Kazim Beg. Of the others, my brother returned to Baghdad with the German Mission, and the remainder at tempted to proceed southwards in Persia through Kerman and I have no idea what has become of them. We seven all reached Afghanistan together. We knew that the Russians had placed outposts to prevent our passage to Afghanistan, and therefore sent on three of the Austrians ahead as scouts towards Kain. These scouts were driven away by the Russians. In our party there were altogether.80 persons, counting Austrian soldiers, Persian sowars, servants and others. We obtained the Persian sowars from Tehran. We and our guides were provided by the Persian Government with papers and documents. Niedermeyer obtained all these documents, as the greater part of our party accompanied him to Tehran from Kermanshah, in order to obtain the necessary papers, and the rest of us travelled direct from Kermanshah to Isfahan where we met the Tehran contin gent. From Isfahan we marched together via Nain, Anarak, Tabas, Bushruyeh (where we halted for two weeks) thence to Duhuk Sheileh, Kazal, Durush, Takhta- van, and Yezdan. The Persian authorities assisted us saying that Persia was a ! neutral country and therefore passage was free to all. However we asked for no special assistance as we were well provided, and paid for such necessaries as we required on a generous scale. At Tabas I saw the Governor, Imad-ul-Mulk, but I do not remember the names of other governors. I can only say that all gover nors between Isfahan and the Afghan frontier came out to meet us and declared themselves our friends : they would probably do as much for you if you were passing that way. When our Austrian patrol was at Kain, the Governor of Sistan \ (Shaukat-ul-Mulk) sent a telegram to ask for what purpose they were there and why they had armed people with them, to which the patrol answered that they were going to Afghanistan and were armed for self-defence. We sent our baggage and cash on ahead with some Austrian scouts, with the idea that if we met with resistance from the Russians we should be able to make our way through singly to Afghanistan, where we should find our baggage awaiting us. Unfortunately there were no officers with these scouts and when attacked the men were able to save nothing. Among _ the baggage was specie to the amount of £600 sterling, and Tumans 18,000—nine packs of Tumans 2,000 each. From Yezdan we proceeded to Para and thence to Herat. Five khans ai )d a | number of sowars were sent from Herat to meet us as our arrival had been communicated to the Afghans from Germany and Turkey two months previous y. We remained at Herat for eight days, after which I returned to Isfahan by the same road in order to deliver a letter to Seiler. I returned to Herat again from Isfahan, the journey, going fand returning, having occupied about two months. When I returned to Herat our party was already at Kabul. I was ordered to remain at Herat and subsequently never proceeded to Kabul. 1 can say no ring of the object of our journey to Afghanistan although you m all probability know that it was to involve Afghanistan in the war. The Amir was then, and probab y is now, disposed to join in the war, but he demanded the fulfilmen o cer am conditions (I cannot say what these were) from Germany and lui T ey Now all officers wish to leave Kabul, as one day the Amir says he is for us and the next against us. Twice before this Niedermayer had made up is mm to leave, but each time the Amir detained him by giving positive assurances, u again backed out of them. Before my departure from Herat I received a letter from Niedermeyer saying there was no hope and that we must all leave, e or■*!»R Isfahan, but I do not know if they have left or not. Niedermeyer also stated- in his letter to me that the Amir was unwilling to let them go in case circumstances should change and Afghanistan should declare war, in which case they—the German officers—would be necessary to him. On leaving Herat I obtained the consent of the Governor, but declined any pass as the mirza might talk about it to others and the British Agent would also come to know of it, in which case I might be caught by the Russian Cossacks at Kariz or the British mounted troops. At Herat I saw 13 Austrian escaped prisoners, and it is said that there are over 50 of them at Kabul. From Herat I rode by Daulatabad, near Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam, and passed three farsakhs to the south of Turbat-i-Haidari, thence to Inzi, whence I struck the main track from Turshiz to Tabas. (I omitted to say that from Berlin an Indian Prince, with whose name I am not acquainted, accompanied us to Afghan istan.) On this last occasion I was accompanied by my Turkish servant and inter preter Ismail and by another servant, also a Turk, named Amin. At Tabas I, together with my two servants and a chance Persian guide, was arrested. Ismail escaped at Tabas, after which the remaining three of us were sent to Bushruveh, and handed over there to Cossacks. Two days later, i.e., one stage before Tun, my servant Amin and the Persian guide escaped. I may add that the terms on which the Amir consented to take part in the war were exposed in a long cypher telegram of He actually said six. ten * pageg&gt; despatched to Berlin&gt; f f j am not mistaken in February of the current year. When I twice proceeded to Isfahan and to Tehran, I followed the following route : from Yazdan to Duhuk, Tabas, Shurab, and Pulband, but there were Russians about and I was obliged to turn off southwards. I returned by the same route. The second time, when going to Tehran, I travelled by Kuhsan to Sharifabad whence I proceeded by the main road in post-waggon. On my return journey I again passed by the post-road to Sharifabad, and thence by Kuhsan/ 5 (Signed) WILLIAM PASCHAN. The abo\e is the exact translation of Paschen , s statement, taken down in my presence by a Secretary of the Russian Consulate-General. It is not a matter of very great importance, but he distinctly stated that he had twice gone to Isfahan from Herat and once to Tehran and I so reported it originally. It appears, however, possible that he counted the journey on which he was captured as his second journey to Isfahan. J J Paschen^told us that his journey to Tehran took place in December of last year and that the Contract, of the contents of which he was ignorant, was sent to Berlin last February, but he has since stated otherwise to the Russian Military Agent who has interrogated him on several occasions and who states that each time he becomes more talkative. He last stated that he left Herat on the 18 th December for Tehran where he handed the Contract ” to his brother for conveyance to Berlin. Of the detailed contents he was unaware, but he professed to know (possibly he had heard from Niedermeyer) that in it the Amir had bound himself to— (1) fortify Kabul and a number of frontier points in accordance with the demands of German officers; (2) increase the establishment of the army; (3) introduce a new system of organization on the advice of Niedermeyer. As he had shown no signs of fulfilling these terms the Germans left in disgust. few (Pays ^ Uss ^ an Militar y Agent will furnish me with the results of his enquiries in a Meshed ; The 8th August 1916.

He asked “ Who are you ? ” and received the reply “ I am Captain Wise; are y ou Mr New ? ” This story seems very circumstantial but Major Heron and Captain Wise do not credit it.

This however seems to refer to Paschen’s party. 1 As four “ Germans ” including Jan Muhammad have been recently captured at Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam, six “ Germans ” have reached Herat, and four ‘ Germans ” were captured at TSehdeh, it seems that all the Germans who reached Kandahar from Kabul in June and July must be accounted for. The Political Situation. Fragments of news about the crisis in Tehran and the advance of the Turks from Hamadan have been unofficially reaching Sistan during the week. These, combined with our uncertainty regarding the strength and intentions of the Ghazi “ students ” at Kadeh, have induced Captain Bennett to move his 120 Infantry into the Bank compound, which can be made impervious to a surprise attack. Our 300 Levies, who hitherto have been living in Sarahs and private houses all over the town, have now been concentrated in the Camp lines, formerly occupied by the Cavalry. Hisam-ud-Dauleh. under instructions from Tehran, telegraphed to the Deputy Governor here on the 13th August, ordering him to enlist 300 soivars (horse and camel) and send them to Kainat. Bukn-ul-Vizareh tells me that he hears that* troops have been called for from all parts of Persia to be sent to Tehran and that Persia in effect is mobilising. News from Afghanistan. (1) Information from Chakhansur confirms the belief that it was a section of the Ghazi students and Gurg outlaws from Kadeh who attacked the Persian post on the 18th July, vide Diary No. 30. This band subsequently came into conflict with some troops from Lash-Juwain, and one of the Ghazis was captured and sent to Farah. Mulla Sher Muhammad, one of the leaders, then went to Bandan Kumal Khan with 30 followers, and announced his intention of attacking some Thana on the Nushki-Robat Trade Route.

Ihe differences between the contending officials have dvanced a step further inasmuch as the adversaries have been telegraphing denunciations of one another to Tehran, Mushar-us-Saltana and the Mutawali Bashi {vide Diary No. 21) demanding the Karguzar’s dismissal, and the Karguzar reporting to his Foreign Office that since the arrival of the new Governor-General the Mutawali Bashi has been interfering in matters of State and particularly in those concerning the Foreign Department. He accuses him of receiving bribes for his influence with his young relative in the cession of Governorships, that of Daragez to Raza Khan being likely eventually to result in the loss of Daragez district to the Persian Government. (Fide Diary No. 25.) {Secret.) The Governor-General has severely reproved the Karguzar for his opposition to the Mutawali BashL The Karguzar recently informed the Attache to this Consulate-General that the Russian Consul-General had promised him his support at Tehran and he requested ours. Unlikely to be true as I considered this statement, I spoke to M. Nikolski on the matter and he informed me that he had no intention of moving either for or against the Karguzar, as although the latter was an exceedingly corrupt official he displayed great zeal in settling Russian cases. I replied that while concurring with the first remark our experience with the prompt settlement of cases was not so fortunate as his. i Badi-ul-Mamalik has now left for Tehran and the Russian Consul-General, who has been interesting himself in smoothing the difficult path of Mushar-us- Saltana, informs me that he is in hopes, that the existing arrangement may work satisfactorily. The Governor-General has now by common report recovered some Tumans 60,000 on account of cession of Governorships and appointments. A difficulty has arisen in respect of that of Khaf, as Shaji-ul-Ayala was unable to pay up his entire pishkash in cash and the appointment is once more in the market, Zulfikar Khan being a rival candidate. 1 The Rais-i-Baladi, Kashaf-ul-Mulk, who*has very satisfactorily performed his functions in the town for some years past, is threatened with dismissal in favour of Mussadak-ud-Daula, who is paying Tumans 1,200, but the former has been informed by Mushar-us-Saltana that on consideration of his paying half the above amount he will be allowed to retain his appointment as a reward for his former good service. Much dissatisfaction is being caused in the town by the overbearing demeanour of the Governor-General’s retinue, chaniakdars and others. Shahzada Jabs Mirza has been appointed Governor of Sar Wilayat on payment of Tumans 1,500, and Nusrat Khakan Governor of Radkan and Kuh Payajat. Murtaza Kuli, Governor of Sabzawar, has arrived here, as also Agha Muin-us- Sadat from Tehran, the latter for inspection of the adahya. M. Nikolski recently informed me that Mushar-us-Saltana had recommended Mirza Ali Asghar to his good offices, that the latter had visited him and thap all things considered, he thought he would do little harm at Kuchan. The Mirza himself visited me yesterday and expressed the most unexceptionable pro-entente sentiments, bitterly lamenting that owing to departmental intrigues he had been invested with the character of a German supporter by his enemies-. In the meantime, owing to the departmental squabble, he is precluded from joining his appointment for the present. British Affairs.' —The instalments owing to the Imperial Bank of Persia by Shuja-ud-Daula (Diary No. 28) have not been recovered by the Karguzar within the stipulated period. Russian Affairs.—Secret. It is reported that Mashadi Abdalla, the Russian . Tajir-Basld, who owes some Tumans 14,000 to Nayyir-ud-Daula, has been instructed eceivcd on UDiA FOREIGN SECRETARY'S Letter. No. J ®2 by the Consul-General to withhold all payment till the compensation claimed by The matter is under discussion between the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Sheikh Jawad, the leading democrat, has applied for a passport to travel via Russia to Tehran and it is said that the Russian Consular its issue M Nikolski, however, informed me a few days ago that he as gom 0 to issue it but that he was giving instructions for the watching of Sheikh Jawad on his way through Transcaspia and Russia. The Russian Consulate-General recently presented 110 passports taken out by Persian workmen who had agreed to proceed to Russia but subsequently retused, and demanded the return of the fees, amounting to Tumans 240 paid for these. The Passport officer refused on the ground that the stamps were defaced but was ordered by the Karguzar to comply with the demand. The Russian railway prospecting engineers returned from a further tour towards Karatigan and have now left towards Kariz.. They were observed near the town taking observations from the roofs of buildings, presumably settling the most convenient point of entry for a projected line. The Russian officer captured at Sabzawar and the Austrian soldier have been brought to Meshed en route for Russia. The Russian Consul-General confirmed to me the capture of two Austrian prisoners by the Sardar of Bujnurd. He was very pleased at the celerity with which the capture was effected at the instance and by the means of the Persian authorities. Persian and German Intrigues. —The enquiries made by the Russian Consul- General of his agent at Daragez re the reputed European refugees, produced, as i was not surprised to hear, no result. Reports shew that some seven persons, of whom four are said to be Europeans, have passed through Radkan to the Hazar Masiid range, where they intend to lie low and to be joined by others, as occasion serves, until a good chance of escaping presents itself. Somewhat fabulous as these unsubstantiated reports sound, I am attempting to have the matter elucidated by means of a local emissary. The Central Defence Committee of Democrats has sent a lengthy communication to its adherents here bidding them be of good heart during the present evil days The tyranny of Britain and Russia has reached its zenith and the day of trmmp of Persia is at hand. Certain editors of Persian newspapers, particularly that ot the Asr-i-Jadid, incur severe contumely for the lies published by them concerning RUP.p.P.ssfts : as a fact the Germans are everywhere victorious ! Two members of the party Mirza Hussain (medicine-seller) afld Haji Amir (manager of the Shrine electric plant)—recounted their recent experience m Russia, where, far from observing any signs of rejoicing at victories, the population wore a most dejected air. Democrats are recommended to use cypher for their correspondence. News from Turbat-i-Haidari—It is again reported that the transfer of the Russian Consul is imminent. Not long ago, in the company of Mirza Muhsm Khan, he made a second descent on the Post Office and scrutinised all letters for Meshed He selected two written by Prince Arguvan Mirza, a relation of Shahsada Mustafa Mirza, and one from Haji Majid, a Tabrizi Turk, opened and read them, and subsequently replaced them. Sardar Makhsus has left and proceeded towards Tehran as far as Turshiz, where he is expected to remain in the hope that the Russian Consul (vide Diary No. 23) may report unfavourably on his successor and he may be recalled. The Karg'izar is acting pending the arrival of Mustafa Mirza. The latter has appointed one Asadulla Khan as Naib-ul-Hukuma for Gunabad. Orders have been issued for the entertainment of 10 sowars at Riibat Kumai, and five at Amram. M. Samsonov left in the direction of Rum, it is understood to investigate the alleged killing of two Persians by Cossacks, but was recalled by telegram at an early stage.News from Kanz.—lt is reported that most of the Taimuris who emigrated with the Kaudam Ilbaigi, and who belong to the Khalili and Muhammad Darwesh sections, have returned. Shaji-ul-Saltana and Mir Baki Sultan are said to have become reconciled and Mir Baki has accompanied the former to his residence at Mahmudabad near Jam. A general conference of the Hashtadan robbers has taken place at which it was proposed to raid Kariz before Shuja-ul-Mulk was likely to arrive. On the protest of certain Gargab Afghans the motion was abandoned and plans of revenge on the Bahluri Taimuris were substituted. The latter have sent their families from Karat to Shahr-i-Nao and are themselves prepared for hostilities. The Hashtadani robbers have sent a message to a wealthy man of Mashhad Biza named Mulla Haji Muhammad to send them Tumans 2,000, failing which they will raid the village. Haji Muhammad then hid his valuables. Further recruits are reported to have joined the Hashtadanis. A telegram from our agent at Kariz has just been received through Turbat-i- Jam that the Hashtadani robbers have commenced operations and have raided the village of Hindu, four farsakhs from Kariz, and that general raiding in Bakharz is feared. In concert with the Bussian Consul-General I hope to secure the speedy despatch of Shuja-ul-Mulk. News from Herat .—The Herat news-writtor under date of 21st instant states that the northern German party had reached Karokh and were expected very shortly. He adds a rumour that the party reported to have proceeded via Ghor had joined them at Kala-i-Nao. Beyond that he makes no mention of the southern party. Naik Muhammad Ibyahim of the 124th Baluchistan Infantry came to me yester day stating that with another man of his icg’ment he had been despatched to Meshed via Kandahar and Herat for recruiting. At Kandahar he was arrested, but his companion managed to escape and return to India. After 15 days’ detention lie was permitted to proceed which he did in company of the Germans leaving Kandahar for Herat. His idea was that the party would try to cross the Persian frontier and that he could then by some means give information to the nearest British post. At Girishk, however, son e suspicion was aroused concerning him and in spite of his denial of any connection with the Britsh Government he was ordered to leave them. He proceeded quickly to Herat where he was again arrested and detained on suspicion for 10 days. On his release, when starting for Meshed he saw the Germans, who had apparently just arrived and who were being accommodat ed in or near the ’Ark. The date would be the 20th or 21st instant. Tne party consisted of four German officers, a Colonel, Major, Captain and Lieutenant, five Austrian or German soldiers, two Panjabi Musalmans from Amritsar (possibly two of the homb-experts whose arrival in Afghanistan was reported from Sistan), a Persian Jarnshedi and another Persian guide. They were accompanied by an escort of 11 Afghan sowars under a Dafadar, a Mehmandar and 11 servants. The party' was well mounted and provided with mule transport, horses and riding camels, and m ere everywhere treated with great civility as befitting guests of the Amir. The Naik had much conversation with the Dafadar, sowars, and servants, who all assured him that the Amir’s orders were formal that the Germans should quit the country. They were not expected to remain at Herat more than a few weeks, and it was said that they w ould leave by the Ghurian road and make their way to Tabas, and thence to Yazd. He was struck by the ignorance that appeared to prevail as to present conditions in Persia. They said that there were Bussian troops at Kariz and British at Birjand ; therefore they intended to give these places a wide berth and to travel principally at night and by byways. He had some conversation with the German officers, w'ho spoke Turkish fluently and who express - ed dislike of Afghanistan but expected to find Persia much pleasanter, 'it is oFcourse possible tLat they had penetrated the Naik’s identity and wore telling him what they wished him to believe, but he appears convinced that they wore actually very badly informed and spoke in good faith. At present I know r ro more of this Naik than what he says he is, but I see no reason to doubt him. He is certainly a remarkable linguist as, besides Hindustan^ Bussiao, and Arabic, all of*which he speaks fluently, he claims to speak Turkish, Pushtu, Persian and some English. As far as I can see he deserves great credit for his initiative and intelligent report. • ■I received a letter last night from an agent at Herat stating that “ all the Germans have arrived ” which I take to include the northern party also. So far no confirmation from the news-writer has reached me. Among the Kandahar party appears to be one “ Chaushan Austrian formerly at Herat. Some 50 dervishes of the order of Lai Shahbaz Kalandar have suddenly appeared in the vicinity of Herat. It is said that the Amir has turned all able-bodied men dicants out of Kabul, but there is some idea that these men are in reality spies, or perhaps propagandists. The Indian doctor at Herat is reported to be the correspondent of. several Indian newspapers. The Tanr-bashi of Herat has reported to the Naib-ul-Hukumat that a caravan from Meshed was stopped by the authorities at Kariz for being m possession of gold rubles. The money was eventually returned but some was abstracted. The Tajir-bashi entered a strong protest. Naib-ul Hukumat has received afarman from A aib-us-Saltana th&amp;t the Kaudani Ilbaigi be sent to Kabul. The latter has been warned to make his preparations. The Naib Solar has ordered that the troops be paid and pay has been disbuised to most of the artillery. It is expected that after Ramadan a company from each battalion will be sent to the frentier to relieve the Biasadars in order that these may be drilled at Herat The 50 artillerymen deputed to bring the guns left with 100 camels under a captain for Kabul. The two Hazara deserters were sent with them. These men were seen at Herat by Naik Muhammad Ibrahim, with their rifles, but he ^fram ed from communicating with them. He states that the deserted Afndi double- company are being employed as instructors to Afghan troops. Comparatively good drill is carried out at Kandahar, less good at Herat. Condition of country. —Kuchanis are complaining of oppression at the hands of Shuia-ud-Daula and Dabir-us-Saltana. Zushki, Shirari, and Daulatabadi robbers are again active, and a recrudescence of Turkoman raids on the Shahrud road is feared, the guard at Dasht having asked for help from the Sardar of Bujnurd. The Barbaris, since the death of Saiyid Ahmad Ali Shah, are out of hand. They carried oh an Ismaili girl and have threatened other Ismailis. His Britannic Majesty’s Ojfg. Consul-General and Agent to the Government of India in Khorassan. A strong hand is obviously needed in the province and though it is early days to judge too harshly of the present Governor-General, less regard for money-making and more regard for public affairs would be advantageous. M. Cornelis, the Chiei of the Customs, crystallised his attitude with some success by remarking II est etonnant ce jeune homme, il mange plus que tous les autres.” E. A. F.

Id-ul-Fitr .—The usual ceremonial visits in plain clothes were paid to the Deputy-Governor (and Ivarguzar), the Directors of Revenue and Customs and the Telegraph Master. The Chief of Police was unable to receive on account of illness. There is no military officer of sufficient standing to be entitled to a visit now in Sistan. The new Karguzar , Motasam-us-Saltaneh, arrived on the afternoon of August 1st. He called on me on August 3rd. He makes no secret of the fact that he is a Democrat, but declares himself to be y&gt;ro-English. He informed that but for the hostility of the Russians he w T ould have been sent to Tabriz as Karguzar. M. de Bravine has informed Major Heron, on the authority of General Loginov, that Motasam-us-Saltaneh has come to Sistan in order to assist the Germans in corresponding with the Afghan Government. Deputy Governor of Sistan, and ordered to send reports of important matters direct to Tehran. Hisam-ud-Dauleh has sent me a mild protest on the subject of the appoint ment, mentioning that he has heard that Rukn-ul-Wizareh has been accepting bribes. On hearing later from Major Heron that I favoured the appointment he has intimated to us his acquiescence in it. left Birjand, as reported last week, on the 26th July,, will be replaced by Basir-us- Saltaneh, who I believe is now some where on the road between Meshed and Tehran. I presume that this officer will visit the capital before returning to this Province. The absence of a Director at this time of year is likely to cause some inconvenience locally and to interfere with the full collection of revenues if the Central Govern ment do not quickly delegate sufficient powers to the Revenue Naibs at Birjand and Sistan. The Revenue Office at Birjand was locked up by Khan Malik at the time of his departure. I am informed that there are no Germans in Chakhansur now. If any were there recently, they must have gone northwards. Two of my news-agents, however, declare that no Germans have recently been in that District. I still receive reports about the robberies committed by the ghazis at Kadeh. A caravan of Ghilzais is said to have been looted, and two of the Ghilzais killed. Some of the ghazis are said to have appeared at Chahar-Burjak and to^ have declared their intention of attacking Robat. I do not place any credence in the threat. t The Karguzar of Sistan. 1 The Deputy Governor of Sistan.

August 5th .-—Telegraphic news has been received from Sehdehof the capture of a small German party on the 5th August by Captain Wise and a party of Baluch Levy sowars who were proceeding from Birjand to Sehdeh. T„e prisoners are named : (1) Voigt, who claims to be a Lieutenant in the 4th Regiment of Guards Artillery, Potsdam ; (2) Kershasp, son of Hormuz, alias Hasan Ali, a Parsi native of Bombay (Cumballa Hill), who says that he was studying chemistry in Berlin and was arrested on the outbreak of war, in consequence of which he became a German subject; (3) Abdul Aziz, who claims to have been born in Geimm East Africa, but who knows as much English as German and is certainly a Sikh in disguise and possibly a deserter from the Indian Army ; (4) Voigt’s servant, nationality not stated. The last-named has stated that his party travelled from Kandahar via Girishk, Akhtoba, Ghor, Parjuman, Farah Rud to Daulatabad, Khos, Anardarra and Chah Rig. Tnree Austrians, Chaush, Grosser alias Ghulam Reza, and Dumardovitch, left the party at Parjuman, presumably for Herat. Jan Mohammad, an Indian, also left the party ' on the road near Darband.” News from Narmaskir and Sarhad. (1) Mr. Dormer has heard that General Sykes left Kerman for Shiraz via Yazd on the 26th July with 600 to 700 Indian ranks Infantry, Cavalry and Artillery. (jy.

Tne third was arrested by Mr. Dormer’s Line Ghulams at Fahreh on the 3rd August. (3) Mir Jehind is said to be corresponding frequently with Sardar Saiyid Khan of Bampur.

Ifr CONFIDENTIAL Meshed Diary No. 30 for the week ending the 22nd July 1916. Persian Dissensions, not unconnected with private interests continue among the principal officials of the province, with, it mav be imamnpH’ an unfortunate effect on public affairs. ° ’ The Governor-General is still on bad terms with his PesUar, incited therein by his brother-in-law the Mutawah Bashi, who is anxious to secure a lion’s share in the management of the affairs of the province. The latter official has also quarrelled with the Karguzar and has recommended his dismissal to the Governor- General. Moshar-us-Saltana is anxious for the Karguzar’s dismissal and regards the Mutawali Bashi with disfavour. Something in the nature of a triangular duel is thus in progress. The Russian Consul-General recently visited the Governor-General and recommended that the confidential retainer Badi-ul-Mamalik be dismissed on the ground of his having previously served Salar-ud-Daula. The Karguzar has approached the Attache of this Consulate-General with a request that our influence might be exerted in his favour. It was intimated to him that the settlement of some 14 cases, some pending for over a year, and others of an exceedingly trivial nature, would at any rate demonstrate his desire to perform his obligations vis-a-vis the British Government. As matters now stand he leaves all such cases to his Ajdan, an exceedingly remiss official. The Governor-General is reputed to have paid a sum of Tumans 40,000 to secure his appointment and the nomination of the following Governors goes some way to recoup him. Shahzada Mustafa Mirza is appointed Governor of Turbat-i- Haidari, Tun and Gunabad, on payment of Tumans 8,000. Raza Khan, brother of the late Mas’ud Khan, is confirmed as Governor of Daragaz, peshkash Tumans 4,000 in addition to Tumans 2,000 to the Mutawali Bashi and lesser sums to Moshar- us-Saltana and the Karguzar. Shaji-ul-Ayala to be Governor of Khaf, peshkash Tumans 5,000. The direct appointment of officials to the Khorassan maliyat from Tehran is causing much dissatisfaction and the idea of dispossessed officials taking hast in the British Consulate-General was mooted. Najd-us-Saltana has protested on general grounds and more particularly against the appointment of Mirza Ali Asghar ; more, I imagine, on account of its being a direct appointment than of the incumbent’s germanophile proclivities. Agha Mirza Hassan Khan, Mustauji-ul- Mulk, Rais-i-Maliyat Meshed, has arrived, and Saiyid Abul Kasim has left to take up his appointment as Amin-i-Maliyat of Radkan and Chinaran. Persian Affairs. —The two Herati would-be gun-runners Mirza Abbas Kuli and Saiyid Hussain (Diary No. 28) duly arrived here and proceeded to purchase rifles. I was at first in hopes that we should be able to arrange to seize them when leaving with their spoil, but as it appeared that they w ere sending the rifles by ones and twos with various caravans, I passed the matter on to the Russians with a view to their deportation. The latter arranged their arrest through the Rais-i-Nazmia, in w hose custody they are at present. Two maliyat sowars of Khaf, who had come in toI J I ' t r: I; 1 i I his honour.

The Governor of Radkan was warned to be on the look out, and the Russian Consul- General informed. , j + The latter tells me that he has telegraphed to his Agent at Daragez, but as the original report stated that the Agent had been privy to the passage of these persons it is not very likely that anything will come of this step. The Sardar of Buinurd is stated to have telegraphed to the Russan Consul- General that, as requested, he had arrested three Austrian escaped prisoners, and to have received the reply through Moshar-us-Saltana that they should be handed over to the Russian Agent at Kuchan. I have heard nothing personally on the subject from the Russian Consul-General. In this connection I may mention that General Loginov expressed the greatest indignation at the manner in which Austrian prisoners are permitted to wander freely about at Tashkent and other places, not only as contrasting with the treatment of Russian prisoners in Germany and Austria, but also as putting a premium on the escape of enterprising individuals. Certain local mullas have tried unsuccessfully to have a service of mourning held in memory of Agha Saiyid Muhammad of Najaf, who declared jehad on the British and subsequently died. News from Turbat-i-Haidari.—^ appointment of Mustafa Mirza ha* disposed of the last hopes of Sardar-i-Makhsus. His energies are now centred on aXect withdrawal to Tehran as having feathered his nest fairly while at Turbat-i-Ha’dari, he has the more reason to dread the squeezing which would result from a digression to Meshed. Twentv-five Cossacks left Turbat for Tabas on the 7th instant to take over the German who, we hope, will prove to be Paschen. The Russians inform that a telegram has been received from Tiflis directing that the German agitator ” is to be sent there. Basar-us-Saltana, Rais-i-Maliyat of Sistan, and the Karguzar designate of Sistan, reached Turbat on the 7th instant on their way respectively to Tehian and Sistan. News from Kariz.—Two blood-feuds appear likely to complicate still mrtiier the troubled state of the border, the one on account of the death of the son. of Do Muhammad (Diary No. 27), and the other for the death of the son of Mini Khan. Dost Muhammad is reported to be collecting his men to take revenge on Bald Sultan, and Miru has been recently joined by a notorious Afghan roDDei Kundal Khan with 30 to 40 adherents. In the meantime Ishak, the brother of the Kaudani is reported from Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam to have come with some 30 Taimun followrs to Kalata-i- Ismail Khan and to Kala Shir with the avowed object of collecting the harvest, but is suspected of more sinister designs. Sliaji-us-Saltana, the head of the Jai Taimuris, ‘wrote to Mir Baki Sultan proposing a meeting to concert action re g a ™ m P Ishak but Mir Baki replied that the matter did not concern him. As ne is nknown to be in communication with the Ilbaigi, the Hashtadan gang and Samandar Khan, his action has caused great alarm among the Jamis, who are taking refuge in and fortifying the old fort. It is stated that Paschen, before crossing the frontier, stayed for a night or two at the mahalla of the Kaudani Ilbaigi at Shibish. News from Herat .—The German party from Kandahar was expected to arrive at Herat about the 16th instant. It is rumoured that some at any rate of them were marching via Ghor. It is fairly evident that they did not arrive as soon as was expected as we should have received information before this. The Naib-ul-Hukumat received a report from Maimana that the northern party had left for Herat on the 5th instant. This party is reported to have divided at Kala Nao. All preparations for the reception of the Germans have been made, both the Bagh-i-Shah and the Bagh-i-Karta having been made ready. Guards of eleven men per battalion have been told off for them, a mehmandar has been appointed and forage issued from the Government store for their transport animals. It is stated that each German party is accompanied by a ghulam bacha whose duty it will be to report their proceedings to the Amir at the conclusion of the journey. The Indian doctor has been in trouble for taking a fee from a patient. The Naib Salar abused him roundly in Durbar for such conduct when he was well paid by Government for his services and when the .medicines for which [he had dared to charge were a government issue. He was ordered to refund the fee on the spot. The Chief of the city police has proposed that the strength of the force be increased to eight hundred men. With the addition of one hundred sappers and miners, the Kotwali force would then be able to undertake all measures of discipline and sanitation in the town, and free the military for their regular duties. The proposal has been put back for further consideration when the infantry cadres are complete. The Naib Salar has instituted a class of instruction in military signalling. Among the pupils is the former Brigadier Fateh Muhammad. One hundred and sixty horses purchased for government purposes have been brought in from the northern districts. The overbearing demeanour of the four colonels who recently arrived from Kabul is the subject of much unfavourable comment among inferior officers and rank and file. It is possible that these officers are attempting to introduce the rudiments of discipline among the Herat troops. Fifty artillerymen have been paid up and with horses and camels despatched towards Kabul to assist in bringing in the new battery. The following measures bearing on military efficiency are said to have been ordered : (1) The register of the inhabitants of Herat has been called for with a view to collecting a further proportion of recruits. (2) Artillery horses to be inspected and all unserviceable animals cast. Young horses kept well exercised and ready for hard work. Orders given for the purchase of one thousand four hundred horses and the entertainment of extra grooms. (3) Thirty thousand kharwars of corn together with barley and forage to be stored in military godowns. Condition of the country .—Apart from Khaf, Jam and Bakharz, the Afghan border is in an unsettled condition generally. Afghan robbers have raided a village in Zorabad district but on pursuit by the local Ilbaigi the looted property was recovered. Two merchants have been killed by Afghan robbers on the Sarakhs road.

July 28th. Captain E. H. Brenan and Lieutenant T. V. Brenan, 11th Essex Begiment, have reached Girdi en route to Sistan, where they will be employed with the Levy Corps. J A military disturbance in Birjand. A slight disturbance occurred at Birjand on the 23rd July owing to information reaching the Persian troops that Khan Malik, the Revenue Director, was leaving for Sistan without settling their arrears of pay. Khan Malik was found in the house of the Birjand Karguzar, whence he was compelled to proceed to the Governor’s residence, where a majlis was held, at which apparently the Director made proposals which did not satisfy the officers. He offered to send up 2,000 Tomans directly he reached Sistan, whereas the pay is 6,000 Tomans in arrears. On leaving the Governor’s house Khan Malik and the Sistan Karguzar applied to Major Heron for guards, in consequence of which two Hazaras were posted at each of their houses. On the 25th Major Heron proposed to withdraw the guards as the situation appeared to be quite calm. Khan Malik, however, did not concur in this view and announced his intention to sleep in the British Vice-Consulate for the night, and to leave Birjand the next day for Meshed. This programme he duly carried out; we hope that he will not be sent back. The Birjand Karguzar, who was always very subservient to Shaukat-ul-Mulk, is trying to make mischief for Hisam-ud-Dauleh by declaring that he was assaulted and wounded by the soldiers, for whose acts the Governor is technically responsible. He has also probably accused the Governor of being privy to the disturbance. It seems impossible to ascertain the true facts as regards this. German Emissaries. See last week’s diary. I hear that the four Germans (one German and three Indians ?) had accompanied the Ghazis from Kala Bist to Kadeh. The Germans then came to Kala Kang, the Military Headquarters of the Chakhansur District. News from Afghanistan. See last week’s diary. The leaders of the Ghazis are said to be Ghulam Muhammad Nur Zai and Mulla Sher of Garmsel. Some Gurgs and men of Farah are with them. Ghulam Muhammad has previously raided the Baring-Bandan road. Mulla Sher is described as a notorious robber, though he sometimes takes trade caravans to Nushki The outlaws have already committed several outrages in Afghanistan, for instance— (1) they have looted at Chah-i-Khak the caravan of one Khan Muhammad and three companions coming from Herat; (2) they have stolen two horses, one pistol, and 80 Tomans from a Herati trader; (3) they have carried off 30 head of cattle from the Bazi tribe of Chakhansur.2 News from SaTluid. 1 The name of the British officer whose death was mentioned last week is Lieutenant Leslie-Smith.

Persmn &lt;#CT&lt;rfs.—Intrigue is already rife among the entourage fl f tt,.. n General, its most serious manifestations being directed against Peshkar, whom Nahd-es-Saltana, assisted supplant. The resignation by the former of his post aThtad S “f ° US to Khorassan, on the pretext of his objection to direct appointments to the i™’ “ from Tehran, is taken as an additional proof of his desire t,, * * (J ®P a F tment Sultana’s appointment.

Salar Nusrat, the present Rais-i-iVamM, has been called on to contribute a sum of Tumans 800 to continue in his post and has assented to the exaction The Governor-General has not made a favourable start as regards public opinion. His action m lowering the price of bread and other necessaries for a few hours on the day of his arrival was resented generally as an unworthy trick rices still rule \cry high, and the act.on of a Saiyid, who on the Governor-General’s passage to die uhrme on a recent occasion bawled out disrespectful remarks and escaped down a side-alley, may be taken as some indication of the opinion of the people, many of whom now openly regret Naiur-ud-Daula ! The Karguzar is very anxious as to his tenure of his appointment th» attractiveness of which has been enhanced in the new budget by an addition of Tumans 200 per mensem to the emoluments. It is heard that four serious candidates have come forward at Tehran, the most enterprising bidder having effored Tumans 4,000 for the post. Moshar-es-Saltana is anxious to secure the appointment for his son-in-law ’ltla-ul-Mulk. U The office of Rais-i-Mahyat at Kuchan has been filled by the appointment oi Ah Asghar Khan, who, having rendered signal services to the Turks on their occupation of Ramadan, and having been dismissed from the charge of the malivat ot that town for having, m conjunction with the Governor, handed it over to the lurks, would seem a singularly unsuitable candidate for a responsible post in tho Russian sphere. He is expected here shortly. ^ Shahzadeh Ali Khan, late Amin-i-maliyat at Shahrud, has been nom inn fori Rais-i-Maliyat at Daragez and Kalat. „ Persian Affairs.—The estate of the late brigand Muhammad Kurshabadi killed some months ago near Nishapur, has been the subject of several cypher telegrams from the Foreign Minister to the Karguzar. The latter replied that the whole of the jewels and valuables, to the amount of over Tumans 100,000, had been removed by Muaful-ul-Mulk, Peshkar to the Governor of Nishapur, Kavam-ul- Islam, and Motmad-ul-Ayala, acting on orders of the Governor. The house had been ransacked in the search for cash which was duly discovered and taken. Rifles found were taken oyer by the Russian troops.

He referred them to his brother Muhammad Yusuf Khan, Naib-ul-Hukumal of Bakharz, who in turn referred them to his father at Meshed. Ore the 9th instant Muhammad Yusuf Khan himself left for Meshed by his father’s orders. The frontier is thus without any responsible authority what ever. It is reported from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam that the well-known Afghan robber Aziz Khan, with some others, has joined Mir Baki Sultan at Gak. Bobberies in that neighbourhood have already commenced. The Bussian doctor has returned to Kariz from Turbat-i-Haidari. His assistant has apparently been insubordinate and will be sent to Meshed for trial. News from Herat .—A recent arrival from Mazar-i-Sharif informed the newswriter that the Germans had reached that place three days before his departure and that they were expected to start for Herat two days after he had left. (Unfortunately no date is given.) They had been travelling very leisurely and in con siderable comfort having with them a Mehmandar and supplies from Kabul. They had been treated with great respect by the Naib-ul-Hukumat of Turkistan. Twelve Austrian prisoners of war, who had escaped from Bussian territory, had been detained atMazar in order to accompany the Germans to Herat. The rumour is current at Herat that under secret agreement with the Amir the Germans and Turks will remain at Herat for some time and will assist in leading the Afghan troops to the assistance of the Sultan of Turkey. The Austrians at Herat are apparently in ignorance of the movements of the German parties as they have been anxiously interrogating muleteers as to their whereabouts. The Naib-ul-Hukumat has consented to the young ArabYunis, whose deporta tion he had ordered, remaining till the arrival of the Germans, when he will be attach ed to their party. Both the northern and southern German parties are expected to reach Herat very shortly. Orders have been received from the Amir that the two Hazara deserters at Herat are to proceed to Kabul with their rifles. The Turkoman Sardars have left for Kabul escorted by a Dahbashi of Khawanin as Mehmandar. Before leaving they stated that others of then relatives would shortly reach Herat. Yar Muhammad Khan, Risaldar at Chihil Dukhtaran, has reported to the Naib-ul-Hukumut that two Bussiau officers recently visited him to enquire as to a Bussian soldier reported to have been kidnapped by Afghans. He replied that such an act was most improbable, but that he would make _ enquiries. T ie A T aibul-Hukumut directed that the matter should be thoroughly investigated and that greater precautions were to be taken in future. The Governor of Anardarrah reports that a Khan of Kain with 14 families of his relatives has reached the frontier and asks to be permitted to emigrate to Afghanistan. The N aib-ul-H ukumut directed that full enquiries should be made with a view tc the submission of the case for the orders of the Amir. A farman has been received from the Amir directing that all cases of persons in receipt cf Government allowances be thoroughly investigated m order that the matter may be put on a proper footing. At a recent Darbar the NaibSolar informed his subordinates that both in war materiel, discipline, and drill, the troops were woefuHy behindhand and that behoved all concerned to assist in preparing for the moment Hers as to they might very probably be dragged. On the enquiry of one of his officers as to why bespoke with such certainty he replied that the condition ° a “ in these days was analogous to that of a pregnant woman. In either case even tualities were to be expected. It is new reported that a further large convoy of rifles and military stores are on the way from Kabul to Herat with the battery which is expected.The Naib-ul-Hukumut has been ordered by the Amir to carry out a strict inspection of the Khawaviin sowars, especial attention being directed to the age and fitness of the men for service and to the condition of their horses. three hundred picked men of this force are tobe senl to Kabul after the inspection which will take place after Ramadan. The Naib Solar has carried out an inspection of 'the cavalry which recently returned from frontier service. Out of four squadrons inspected he dismissed 100 men as no longer fit for service. As infantry recruits do not come forward readily and as great keenness to enlist in the cavalry exists, the Naib Solar has ordered that until the infantry cadres are complete recruits for cavalry will only be accepted on the payment of 1,000 krans and the production of a suitable charger. Masons and carpenters have been despatched for the repair of the barracks at Chihil Dukhtaran, and a well-digger has been sent to Chashma Tarbar. Condition of the country .—The news of the Turkish advance became generally known here early in the week and popular imagination naturally supplied various exaggerated additions. It was received with satisfaction by less reasonable members of the community, but no great excitement was caused thereby. Interest in the matter has considerably dwindled by now, and the Manager of the Imperial Bank informs me that not only local but also Herat merchants are trading with confidence. The restless condition and the absence of supervision on the Kariz frontier and in Bakharz has been referred to above. , Daragez is reported to be in considerable disorder. Zabardast Khan, the uncle of Raza Khan, the candidate for the Governorship, has sent some Daragezi Kurds of the opposing faction to Meshed, where they have been imprisoned by the Governor-General without inquiry. He also seized four “ suspected ” persons who had arrived from Russian territory, and after stripping them of their property sent them off secretly to Radkan. E. A. F.

Levies were ordered out from Girdi to assist in the search. It was afterwards ascertained that one of the patrols was met by Captain Pemberton m the last stage of exhaustion three miles south of Madeh Karez on the 3rd July. One of the last two missing Sowars turned up in Neh on the night of the 6th July. The other was rej orbed to have gone mad of thirst and to have sho+ himself.

I have already informed H's Majesty’s Minister that I would like to have Rukn-ul-Wizarah, the outgoing Karguzar, confirmed in this appointment, of which he has been holding charge since last February. Failing the last named, Mirza Keza Khan, late Revenue Director at Birjand, seems a more promising candidate than Zabiullah. A fghan News, Two companies of Infantry have been sent from Kala-i-Rang (near Chakhansur) to Kala-i-Fath (on the Helmand near Chahar Burjak). Perhaps they are intended to control the actions of the Germans on their arrival from Kandahar. Baluch Robbers of Afghanistan, See Diary No. 25. The name of the leading Baluch Maldar killed was Nasr-ud-Din. The leader of the robbers was Shahmir, Zarakzai. The latter is reported to have moved his encampment from Sartik (16 miles east of Duroh) to Lanu, said to be 12 miles further east. Mulla Ali Mazar, a relative of Nasr-ud-Din, is said to have killed two Zarakzais already in revenge. The Shaukatiyeh School in Birjand. The annual examinations before visitors were held on the 27th June. The Governor and Europeans in Birjand were invited, but the former excused himself on the plea that his mother was dangerously ill (she has just been attacked by paralysis). He however sent a donation of 500 Krans. Shaukat-ul-Mulk sent a telegram regretting his inability to attend. Some comment has been passed on the faci that neither the Headmaster nor Khan Malik, who spoke in praise of Shaukat-ul-Mulk, the founder of the school, made any reference to Hisam-ud-Dauleh’s gift.The Telegraph Master, Birjand. I am informed tliat Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s monthly subsidy to Sartip Husain Kuli Khan amounts to 30 Tomans. The Health of Sistan. Fever is prevalent in Sistan, especially in the riverain tracts. It is also radns at Koh i-Malik Siab, Hurmak and Girdi; so much so that we have great difficulty^ in keeping up serviceable detachments at those posts. Not only camels but men are also dying there.

The sickness at all these posts is so great that some measures have to be devised for combatting it* The Karguzar-designate of Sistan. I hear from Meshed, on Russian authority, that Motasim-us-Saltaneh is a Democrat and has instructions from his leaders to report all movements of British troops in this part of Persia to the Germans ! It is astonishing that so many Democrats should be regaining office—-the new Commander of the Troops and Sarhaddar is also said to be one. Are they financed from abroad ? German Emissaries. It is rumoured that two Austrians (?) reached Lash-Jowain from Herat on the 11th July. They are expected at Kala-i-Kang. A German messenger is said to be at the latter place with a letter, waiting for them. Afghan News. See Diary No. 27. I hear that Haji Sherdil Khan, Governor of Chakhansur, and Sardar Muhammad Aslam, specially deputed from Kandahar to enquire into the circumstances of the Bareh Reg raid committed by Regis on a Herat caravan, have summoned Sardar Ata Muhammad Khan of Chahar Burjak to Kala-i-Kang, sowars having been sent to ensure his coming in. The Sardar is accused of having recovered and misappropriated ten camel loads himself. The case may possibly also account for the despatch of the two companies of Afghan Infantry to Kala-i-Fath, mentioned in last week’s diary. Amir Khan, brother of Sardar Ata Muhammad Khan, who was at Ladis on July 2nd, has perhaps gone to represent the Afghan claim against the Sarhaddis to General Dyer. F. B.

July 20^.-—The Consulate Attache, Khan Sahib Muhammad Hasan Khan Popalzai, left Sistan for India on sick leave. Overwork in connection with the raising of the Levy Corps is probably the chief cause of his illness. German Emissaries. I heard from India on the 19th July that six Germans, two Turks and eight followers, escorted by twelve Afghan’ sowars, left Kala Bist (on the Helmand, 200 miles above Bandar-i-Kamal Khan) on the 2nd July for Afghan Sistan. On the 21st July I heard that one German with three followers had reached Kala Kang about the 18th July. On the 22nd July I heard that several hundred Afghan students, calling themselves Ghazis, had arrived at Kadeh, about 25 miles east of Chakhanasur, with the intention of attacking the Kafirs in Sistan. Later. A second report estimates their number at 400. They have looted two small villages in Afghanistan on their way. The Governor of Chakhansur has sent his Serishtadar with 200 infantry to prevent them crossing the border. Another report states that 40 outlaws, Gurgs, left Kala Bist on the 2nd July travelling westwards towards Lash Juwain. Their two leaders were mounted on horses and the remainder on camels. Afghan Robbers. The Persian post proceeding from Bandan to Lab-i-Baring was attacked again about midday on the 18th July by a party of Afghans, four of whom were mounted on horses and six others on camels. The postal sowar was accompanied by two Persian Government jambazes, two Russian telegraph ghulams, Muhammad Khan, the Persian servant of an Indian Supply and Transport Agent stationed atNeh, and six other Persian travellers including .three women, mounted mostly on donkeys. , The jambazes, Muhammad Khan, who was mounted on a horsejand a Persian mounted on a mule all attempted to escape, but Muhammad Khan was wounded in the thigh and fell into the raiders’ hands. He was brutally murdered where he fell, his head being smashed in with stones. A jambaz shot dead one of the raiders’ horses. * The rest of the travellers were stripped absolutely naked, the four postal parcel bags were carried away, the envelopes of letters were torn open, and the raiders then made off. The postal sowars brought the letters into Sistan, and the other members of the party returned to Bandan with the news. It seems probable that this outrage was committed by a section of the Gurg outlaws mentioned sujpra. Afghanistan News. ‘ (1) It is said that Haji Sherdil Khan is being recalled from Chakhansur on account of complaints lodged against him in Kabul by the Germans. It seems to me that the Governor has maintained neutrality most strictly according to Afghan ideas. He has not allowed Germans to stay or wander about at pleasure in his S district, but he has not favoured us in any way with information about them. (2) The Afghan Karguzar from Chakhansur has told a Sistan friend that as soon as the Germans send an army to Kerman the Afghan Government will enter the war. An understanding to this effect has been arrived at. Received on V) d itP 1316 th INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter.

The following appointments are made : Agha Muazzaz-ud-Din Khan to be Rais-i-Malyat and Agha Hussain Kuli Khan Rais-i-Muhasbat at Sabzvar. Agha Hashim Agha to be Rais-i-Tahdid in Khorassan. The Governor-General is stated to have openly announced that any Candidates for Governorships must pay up the whole of their takdimi in cash in advance. The Governorship of Turshiz is placed at Tumans 4,000. This departure from the usual custom of a moderate payment in advance and subsequent instalments has caused universal indignation. At a recent meeting of democrats the cession of the Governorship of Tabatkan to the Darban Bashi of the Shrine for a cash payment of Tumans 1,200 evoked universal censure, as it was stated that such appointments went to the highest bidder without regard to his qualifications for the post. The Karguzar has again sent a petition in his favour to Tehran, embellished with the false seals in his possession. British affairs. —Lieutenant-Colonel T. W. Haig, accompanied by the Misses Haig, left Meshed on the 3rd instant for Isfahan travelling by Sabzvar, Shahrud and Tehran. From an early hour members of the European community began to assemble at the Consulate-General, to which the Officer Commanding the Kussian troops had sent the band of the 2nd Semirechia Cossacks. The travellers, under Cossack escort, proceeded to a point some two miles from the town, where the whole available mounted strength of the 2nd Semirechia Cossacks, with band, were drawn up under their officers to bid farewell to Colonel Haig. The Kussian Consul-General and his family, M. Cornells, the Chief of the Customs, and many other European, Indian, and Persian friends continued their way to Turuk, where final adieus were made. The whole demonstration was of a particularly spontaneous and cordial nature. The Officer Commanding the Russian troops had kindly made arrangements for Colonel Haig’s escort by successive relays of Cossacks to Sabzvar. A telegram has been received by the Governor-General from the Ministry ol Foreign Affairs through the Karguzar to the effect that although the property 01 Shuja-ud-Daula had been released from taukif, two instalments owing to the Imperial Bank of Persia had not been paid. The Governor-General was requested to enforce prompt payment and to take no excuses. He issued instructions to Shuja-ud-Daula to pay the money within 18 days, otherwise he would be summoned to Meshed, and at the instance of this Consulate-General the order was despatches to Kuchan by the hand of a special mamur. Persian affairs. —The Karguzar has written to the Governor-General requesting him to send a friendly letter to the Naib-ul-Hukumat at Herat respecting the property of Persians raided by the Kaudani Ilbaigi. He also mentioned that e had suggested to the Minister of Foreign Affairs that the intercession of the Britis i Consul-General be invoked in the matter, but that the former had replied that a letter from the Governor-General was the preferable course. Persian and German intrigues. —On the 2nd instant Imad-ul-Mamalik informed us that his father, Imad-ul-Mulk, had written to him that the German held by him at Tabas was “ Pasha Khan ” as Paschen is universally called.

News from Turbal-i-HoMari.—The Governor has received a telegram summon ing hinTto Meshed to pay his respects to the Governor-General. His supporters are bX m getting signatures to a telegram petitioning for the continuance of h^ appointment but a meeting which was intended to foster friendly relations with the mullas and to obtain their support proved a failure. The Russian Consul informed our agent that he had send the prisoners from Tabas to Turbat with all papers and effects, but it is apparent that Imad-ul-Mulk is awaiting instructions. News from Karez .—With reference to the embargo which the Persian authorities were supposed to have placed on the property of the Kaudam /toff*, thirty of his followers came to Jamrud with their camels and have been cuttmg e crops 7 and removing them to their encampment without let or hindrance. Two Jamis captured by the Ilbaiqi in his raid on Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam have been released by hhp at the instance of the Naib-ul-Hukumat at Herat and have returned to their homes. The Hazara sowars have captured one Zulfikar, an Afghan horse-stealer, in the act of making off with a stolen horse to Herat. The man, who is in the custody of Yusaf Khan, has been forced to send to Herat for two other horses which recently stole from Kariz. Two Heratis named Abbas Kuli and Saiyid Hussain have reached Kariz en route for Meshed. They are reported to have Tumans 9,000 cash for the purchase ol gold roubles and rifles for Afghanistan. The matter will be attended to m due course. The Rais-i-Maliyat of Kariz deposited Tumans 3,000 for safe custody with » merchant in Shahr-i-Nau. Certain thieves, who had got wind of this, broke the house and though unable to find the maliyat money made off with Tumans 1,000 belonging to the merchant. - r; ■ | | Ifl I One Miru, a member of the Hashtadan robber gang, finding the dead body of his son and suspecting the Bahlori Taimuris of the act, proceeded to their encampm at Karat with fifty armed men but found the Taimuris in superior strength He ttfatened to reJn and raid them if the murderer were not P-f“dwrthm fifteen days. He is now said to be collecting men for that purpose at Hashtad n.rfm-ir- 3 News from Herat. The A aib Solar has, in order to encourage recruiting, offered to make any man who produces six recruits a Lance-Dafadar on the spot with the prospect of speedy further promotion. He has raised the pay of the artificers in the workshop and ordered 600 bridles to be made at once. Sappers have been sent to the hill of Takht Safar to quarry stones for Government purposes but the exact object of this step is not known. The Amir is said to have appointed a son of the late General Allah Dad Khan to be Colonel of the Herat Artillery, and this officer with several others will shortly arrive at Herat. Humour adds that they are bringing a battery with them. The Austrians whose arrival at Herat was reported last week are now said to be Afghan refugees deported from Russian territory through Bala Murghab. Orders have been received from Kabul that the Turkoman Sardars may proceed thither and the Naib-ul-HuJcumat has presented the head Sardar with a horse and made the necessary arrangements for his journey. He acceded to the request that a messenger be sent to Turkistan to acquarnt the Turkomans’ relatives of the news of their good treatment. The Kaudani Jlbaigi, retaining six of his relatives and a wife, has permitted his elders to return to their families. His subsistence is being defrayed for the present by the Naib-ul-HuJcumat. The Austrians have been permitted to exercise their horses under the strict supervision of a cavalry escort. They are not allowed to leave their quarters or to approach their horse lines without an escort. It is reported that the Amir has issued a farman to the effect that in future all foreigners entering Afghanistan should be detained on the frontier. The Naib-ul- Hukumat will enquire into each case and report to the Amir for orders. The Naib-ul-Hukumat has ordered the deportation to Persia of a young Arab named Yunus, for some time a resident of Herut. Yunus protested without avail. The Governor of Bala Murghab reports that certain Afghans had, within the course of the last eight months, smuggled over 20,000 sheep to Russian territory for sale and the animals are now at Merv. As the Russians will only pay for them in rouble notes the owner are anxious to bring them back to Afghanistan but fear punishment. The Naib-ul-Hukumat replied that their offence would be condoned on this occasion provided the animals are brought back. The Chief of the Khawanin sowars has been ordered to post ten men between Anardarrah and Sabzvar to accelerate reports from the Governor of the former place. *•' % Orders have been given for four criminals to be blown from guns. Condition of the country. —Unsettled conditions prevail on the Kariz frontier and in Barkharz owing to the presence of the Afghan robbers at Hashtadan. The Governor-General is anxious to secure the entertainment of 250 Hazara sowars under Shuja-ul-Mulk for the restoration of order, and it appears highly desirable that he should be enabled to do so. A collision occurred between some maliyat sowars under a son of Nabil-ud- Doula, Amin-i-Maliyat, and some Kurd flock-owners near Kuchan, in which a Kurd was killed. Shuja-ud-Daula is said to have incited the Kurds to refuse payment of the sheep-tax, and he has now imprisoned the son of the Amin-i- Maliyat under the accusation of causing the death of the Kurd. E.

Lieutenant-Colonel Redl and I called on the Governor-General .in the morning and dined with him in the evening. The party, between forty and fifty in number consisted of the Russian Consul-General with his Staff, the Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia and his Accountant, the Officers of the 2nd Semirechia Cossacks, Colonel Scouratt, the Attache of the British Consulate-General, Drs. Esselstyn and Cook of the American Presbyterian Mission, and the leading Persian officials. During dinner the Prince asked me whether we were satisfied with Hisam-ud-Daulah in Sistan, and I replied that we were. After dinner the usual toasts were drunk and the party then walked out into the square of the Arg and witnessed the fireworks and illuminations from the roof of the artillery barracks. J • Persian and German Intrigues—The, democrats propose to hold, on July 3rd, a secret meeting at which cypher codes will be distributed to the members of the society. Agha Mirza Muhsin at Tehran is trying hard to obtain permission for Abdullah Mirza to return to Meshed. It is to be hoped that he will not succeed, for Abdullah, Mirza wdien here was the most active and most mischievous of the democrats. The same muila is also trying to obtain permission for Rukn-ul- Islam (Saiyid Khalil), who was sent to Tehran from Kalat-i-Nadiri, to return to Meshed, and Haji Shaikh-ur-Rais is supporting the request. It is difficult to understand why Agha Mirza Muhsin, who po^es as a friend of the British, should patronize the most active enemies we have in Meshed. The deportation of Malik-ush-Shuara has had an excellent effect on the democrats here, but that effect will be neutralized if other persons who have been deported are allowed to return, A Turk recently arrested in the town at the instance of my Colleague is under examination in the Russian Consulate-General. He professes to be a Persian subject from Ardabil, but he speaks Usmanli Turkish and is suspected of being either a deserter from the Turkish army or an escaped prisoner of war. He will probably be deported to Russia. Neivs from Turbat-i-Haidari .—Officials and ex-officials in the Turbat district are busily intriguing for the retention of their appointments or for reinstatement, as changes are expected now that the new Governor-General has arrived at Meshed. News from Kariz. —Dur Muhammad, an Afghan robber who is now leagued with Mir Baki Sultan, recently robbed a number of camels and other property from the Zurabad district and took them to Guk, where Mir Baki Sultan now is. On his way there he was attacked at Khatai by Dust Muhammad, an Afghan Khan with a large following. Dust Muhammad Khan’s son was severely wounded and he sent a message to Mir Baki Sultan to the effect that if his son died he would kill Mir Baki Sultan and all his family. The stolen camels were recovered from Guk by Shaji-us-Saltanah.— One Muhammad Usman of Khaf has apparently t trade, as a messenger to the German party m Herat. Steps are being taken to intercept him or messengers employed by him. The assembly of a large number of Afghan robbers, said to number 600, at Haslladan is causing much uneasiness in Bakharz, and it is said that they intend to cum their depredations as far as the Birjand and Sistan roads and the Karai villages in Turbat-i-Haidari. The Hazaras of Bakharz who are best fitted to cope with'them are unfortunately occupied in getting in their harvest and ,S uja u - Mull who’is still holding out for the arrears due to him, is not inclined to take any active measures against the robbers. News from Herat.—Some young officers from the military school at Kabul are expected to join the troops in Herat before long. The Commander of the Troops has caused considerable discontent among the rank aid fiteby enhancing the powers of punishment hitherto exercised by junior officers. As a detachment of Risala sowars was coming to Herat from Chihli Hukhtaran a gaifg of robbers attacked at Kamar Kalagh a smmr who had loitered behind the reft shot him, and carried off his rifle, clothes, and horse. His comrades who turned back on hearing the shot, were able to recover the horse but the robbers fled with the rest of their booty into the hills and the Commander of the Troops is sending'a Jemadar and a party of sowars aftei them. The Governor is sending a master-mason to inspect all frontier posts on the frontier and proposes, on receiving his report, to send masons to carry out the necessary repairs. The Governor has refused to permit pilgrims to depart for Mecca this year, owing to the war. Sixty-four horses have been purchased from Obah and Kala-i-Nau for . government purposes. Since the new Governor’s arrival 100 horses have been purchased in the bazar for the same purpose, and purchases are still being made. Pouches * are being made to take the ammunition of the new rifles recently issued to the troops. The two deserters formerly reported as having accompanied the Governor from Kandahar are receiving from him the same pay as they received in the Indian army. The Governor is interesting himself in recruiting. The sowars relieved from the frontier post of Anardarra report that some Germans were seen at Chakhansur, that they had a guide and cleclaied tlieir intention of going towards Kerman. It is reported that three Austrians have been brought into Herat, but it is not yet known from what direction they came. As one was disguised as a Persian and two as Afghans it is probable that they are escaped prisoners. There is no new^s in Herat of the German parties expected from Kabul. Paschen has not returned to Herat. The Governor has received two letters, one for himself and one for the Austrians, said to be from Paschen, who reports that he crossed the frontier near Khaf and safely reached a place 20 farsalchs beyond Birjand. The Governor of (Western) Tabas has arrested a German and three men with him, said to be Afghans. It is probable that these are Paschen, his two servants, ard a guide. T. W. HAIG, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorassan. G, M. Press, Simla—No. C. 312 F.D.—3-8-16- 28—E.A.CONFIDENTIAL. Meshed Diary No. 26 for the week ending June 24th, 1916. Persian Nasir-ud-Din Mirza, the new Governor-General arrived at Meshed on June 22nd, and had a very fine reception. The Attache, with ten^so wars of my escort, M. de Beauvais of the Russian Consulate-General with the band of the 2nd Semirechia Regiment and an escort of Cossacks, the Karguzar and the leading men of the city, went out to meet him at Turuk and the town was elaborately decorated. It has not hitherto been customary for the Russian Vice- Consul and the Karguzar to go out to welcome a new Governor-General. There were illuminations and fireworks in the evening. Shahzadah Musaddik-ud-Daulah arrived from Tehran on June 17th with a view to being appointed Chief of Police at Meshed. My Colleague is opposing his appointment and there seems to be no good reason why the present incumbent, Salar-i-Nusrat, should be removed, for he is doing very well. I hear, however, that he is quite prepared to resign, if permitted to do so. Mirza Ismail Khan, who has been nominated Commander of the Troops in Sistan and Kain, arrived from Tehran a few days ago and called on ? me on June 22 nd. He appeared to me to be a warm partisan of Shaukat-ul-Mulk Shuj a-ud-Daulah, Governor of Kuchan, went to meet the new Governor- General and has been confirmed at Kuchan. Persian Affairs. —The Chief of Police has arrested a Taimuri robber named Allah Vardi, a follower of Shaukat-ud-Daulah, who always had a share of his plunder, and another Taimuri named Muhammad Baig, who has a case against Shaja-us-Saltanah. Persian and German Intrigues.- —Both the Karguzar and Chief of Police are taking all precautions to intercept and arrest three travellers recently reported by the Russians from Sabzavar, who are suspected of being Indians armed with bombs and working in the interests of the enemy. Malik-ush-Shnara has at length been deported to Bujnurd, where he will be under the charge of Sardar, who has returned after visiting the new Governor- General at Sabzavar. * News from Kariz. —There is still some anxiety at Kariz owing to the possibility of a raid by the relations of Samandar Khan from Hashtadan, and Shuja-ul-Mulk has posted some sowars in the town to help the British and Russian agents. The Russian Doctor at Kariz has been ordered to report himself at Tashkent for field service. Mir Baki Sultan has returned to Turbat-i-Shaikh-i-Jam and is assuring the people that his intentions are peaceable. He has about 100 miscellaneous sowars with him and is said to be making preparations to arrest any Turko-German refugees who may cross the frontier. If his endeavours are sincere the Russians will probably agree to his remaining unmolested in Turbat-i-Shaikh-i-J am. News from Herat. —The Governor has received orders from Kabul to check all * government stores in caravanserais. He is also improving the post on the Hazarajat road to Kabul in order that the Kabul ■ post may reach Herat in five days. The relieved garrisons from the Anardarrah and Bala Murghab frontiers have reached Herat. The Governor has ordered the expulsion of a suspicious darwish brought from the frontier to Herat. The man’s nationality is not known. The Governor has given Jchillats to the Ilbaigi of the Kaudani Taimuris and 26 of his principal followers, but has not yet allowed them to leave Herat. l received on 29 Aula id 1 o WiC li jj jj IPDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S j Letter. No. O 0 MThe Commander of the Troops, on June 11 th, summoned the leaders of the Turkoman refugees to the citadel and had a long conversation with them. He is 8 a“d to have told them that their revolt against the Russian Government, the power of which had keen in no way.weakened, was inopportune and that they would have done better to wait and see what happened. An arrival from Kabul tells a story which, if true, may help to account for the expulsion of the Turco-German mission from Kabul. He says that Sipah Sa ar employed one of the Germans to drill the troops and that the German beat an ITJhTsepoy so severely that he died. The Amir then ^^^°f al ”td the German had been employed and, discovering or dered employed him without sanction, confined the Sipah Salar to his house, and orde e that the Turco-German mission should be sent back to Herat. News has reached Herat that the southern party of the mission has alr « a dy ^Can a and the Governor has sent to have the caravanserais on the Herat-i arah road prepared for their reception and is similarly having the caravanserais on the Bala Murghab road prepared for the reception of the northern party Parchen s object in leavhig Herat was apparently to meet the southern party, for the Governor of AfghlnfSabzavar has reported that he passed through there and was supplied lith a miide to conduct him towards them. He is now said to have told some of his servants in Herat that he would return in ten days time. An Afghan sepoy has swindled Saiyid Muhammad, one of the servants of the German party. He offered him his daughter m marriage and induced him to spend about 1,000 Krans, but the girl was already bespoken and her betrothed beat Saiyid Muhammad. On the latter’s complaint the sepoy has been dismissed and has been ordered to reimburse Saiyid Muhammad’s losses. The Siraj-ul-Akhbar is now publishing false news favourable to the Germans, from Persia. Condition of Country.—The Zushki robbers are again very active. The Russian Agent at Daragaz is still busily intriguing for the dismissal of UTonanr-nl-Mlilk. and the appointment of Riza Khan m his place as Governor.

Gul Muhammad Ghilzai of Sadaki, who had returned from Kandahar to Chakhansur about three weeks ago, and who has since bein^ trying to get his wife across the border to him, has been persuaded by his uncle Yar Muhammad, a Jemadar in the Levy Corps, to surrender and come into the Consulate on condition that he was not punished for serving the Germans. The Afghan authorities had acquired the suspicion that my Levies intended to kidnap the man, and he was consequently most carefully guarded and told that unless a safe conduct signed by me ^as shown to them, he would not be allowed to leavd Afghanistan, Gul Muhammad confirms the story that he guided three German Emissaries into Afghanistan at Nauroz time. The men, however, were Indians, not Europeans. Their names were ' Hasan Ali Khan (a converted Parsi), Abdul Aziz (a converted Sikh), and Jan Muhammad, a Punjabi Muhammadan, Hasan Ali claimed to be the leader of 30 men in Ispahan. Jan Muhammad said that the Indian Government had advertised a reward of Bs. 20,000 for his capture. Both had been in Africa (? America), and Jan Muhammad had been several years in Russia. Gul Muhammad met two Germans or Austrians in Kandahar. He denies that any Europeans have reached Chakhansur from Persia since Nauroz, or have escaped from there through this district. (2) It appears from information received in Meshed that Paschen, whom we have been looking out for, has been arrested in Tabas and Tun District. (3) I hear from Awaz that three Turks dressed as mendicants passed through Anardarra and proceeded to Herat about the first week of June. They were said to be carrying a sword, a gold belt, and a crown for the Amir from the Sultan of Turkey ! Russian Refugees. It is reported in Awaz that a large number of Turkomans have reached Herat from Russia. F. B.

Sarhad News. A rupture with Mir Jehind, Yar-Muhammadzai, has occurred'rather opportunely, perhaps, as he seemed likely to get oil too lightly for his verv numerous misdeeds. &amp; j y I understand that the claims of some residents of the Chagai District were bein» investigated by General Dyer on 14th June at Dehbala. Jehind’s followers assumed a threatening attitude whereupon the Sardar, his son Bijar, his brother Kadir Bakhsh, three cousins and 39 other Damanis were arrested. On 25th June the prisoners under an escort of three troops Cavalry and 50 Infantry, with one machine gun, under the command of Captain James, 28th Light Cavalry started from Khwash for India. The same night all but four of the leaders contrived to escape. I have not heard the particulars under which this occurred. On 28th June Captain James’ party was ambushed at Larimba Pass by about 200 Yar-Muhammadzais and Gamshadzais under Sardar Halil Khan. Captain James, Lieutenant Uloth and the Senior Indian Officer were wounded in the first minute. Five Indian soldiers were killed and five wounded. Two prisoners were killed; Jehind and his son however apparently escaped. On the same day a British party escorting a Wireless Section to Khwash were also attacked at Siah Jangal. Three hundred men of the 106th Hazara Pioneers, I understand, have been ordered from Saindak to Khwash. On their arrival the Damanis, who are said to have concentrated at Sar-i-Drokan, will be attacked. Afghan News. ( 1 ) The Chakhansur authorities are very vigorously maintaining a blockade of their border-line. Small temporary posts have been established at frequent intervals. The guards seem just as particular about refusing admission into Afghanistan as they are about letting even their own villagers leave the country temporarily. ( 2 ) Abdus Samad Khan, the Afghan “ Karguzar,” recently called on me. We are old friends, as he periodically visits Sistan to discuss small Perso-Afghan cases with the Persian Karguzar. He declares that during the current year only one German party, Gul Muhammad’s, has reached Chakhansur from Persia. It consisted of three Indians calling themselves German subjects, and two Persians. Also one party, comprising two Germans, one Turk, and two Persians, has come from Herat and passed on to Kandahar. These arrived some weeks after Nauroz. One of the Germans was styled Colonel. Abdus Saman Khan spoke to me about the Bareh Reg raid, referred to in my Diary No. 13, regarding which apparently the Amir himself is somewhat concerned. F. B.

He is also doing his best to secure the goodwill of the new Governor-General for himself. Persian Affairs.—The Karguzar some time ago asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs fop permission to seek my aid in recovering from the Governor of Herat compensation for the robberies committed by the Ilbaigiof the Kaudani Taimuris He has been informed that he can neither refer the case to Abdullah Khan the Afghan Trade Agent, nor write direct to the Governor of Herat and he apparently now intends to refer the matter to the new Governor-General on his arrival 7 See Diary No. 22 . Nusrat-ul-Mulk has complained to the Prime Minister that the Karguzar has compelled him to give an undertaking not to interfere in the affairs of Jahanabad and Kanz-i-Divana in the Zurabad district, which are heldby the agents of Haji Husain Agha but claimed by the Taimuris. ’ He appears to be unable to restrain his tribesmen from carrying off the produce. The Sarrafs of Meshed have agreed at a meeting not to make any payments from private deposits with them until they have recovered all debts due to them by their customers. Russian Affairs. —A general officer is to arrive shortly in Meshed but it does not seem to be known whether he is coming on inspection duty or whether he is to command the troops in north-eastern Persia in place of Colonel Gushchin, who is proceeding on leave. The Karguzar has sent to the Minister for Foreign Affairs lists of the claims for compensation made by my Colleague and me against Nayyir-ud-Daulah and has added that we are both pressing him for the recpvery of the claims, which amount to 35,000 tumans in all.

It was they who killed Haji Kurban Agha and restored order. Persian and German Intrigues. —Naib Muhammad Agha, lately a naib in the gendarmerie, who was dismissed for shooting a man in a gambling affair, was found this week to be harbouring a suspicious character, a Turkish subject, and two Russian officers with a party of Cossacks visited hjs house. The door was barred and when it was forced open Muhammad Agha appeared with a Mauser pistol, fired one shot in the air and with the second slightly wounded one of the Russian officers in the arm. He was promptly shot dead by the Cossacks. Unfortunately the Russians omitted to watch the roof of the house and the man of whom they were in search escaped. Malik-ush-Shuara is still holding secret meetings before dawn and attempting to encourage his hearers with vague promises of help from an unknown source within five months, but he is much discouraged by the recent news of Russian victories. I hear that M. de Beauv,ais has advised the Karguzar to compel Malik- ush-Shuara and his relative Shaikh Jduhamm^d Kazim, Bullurfarush, to leave the town.News from Turbat-i-Haidari,—The remittance for the Imperial Bank of Persia has arrived safely at Turbat-i-Haidari.

Mir Baki Sultan, who is now in Kal ah-i-Guk, recently visited Turbat-i-Shaikh-i-Jam with 100 sowars. A movement is on foot to obtain permission for him to return to Persia on furnishing security for his good behaviour, but I have declined to support this proposal. News from Herat.—The Governor has arrested three men and two women, Afghan subjects settled in Russian territory who had^ returned to Herat to see their relatives The men have been imprisoned and the women handed over for safe custodv to the elders of one of the quarters of the city. The Governor has “used two more murderers to be blown from guns The Commander of the Troops is active in ordering and supervising repairs to the barracks. See ’Diarv No 24. Paschen has not vet been traced, either in Afghanistan or on this side of the border. The two men who accompanied him were Ismail the interpreter and Amin, both Usmanli Turks. The horses on which they escaped were a chestnut, a grey, and a bay, and they are probably not so ill furnished with money aslat first supposed, for Ismail is said to have purchased 1,000 roubles in sold before their departure. Paschen is also said to have taken 100 tumans with him. There is no certain news of his destination and object and ms companions in Herat, with the exception of one Austrian, seem to hav ® been ignorant of his intentions. The Austrian m whom Paschen confided said that Paschen told him that he would be in Meshed in three days, but this information is probably intended to mislead. The agent believes that he will for Zulfikar and the servants of the party are of opinion that he will try to reach Tun and then make towards Kerman. Paschen apparently left letters for the Governor and the Commander of the Troops, which were delivered after his departure. In the former he is said to have informed the Governor that he had heard that his brother was fioliting against the British at Koh-i-Malik-Siah and that it was necessary for him to join him. In the latter he said that he was leaving Herat on urgent business, but would soon return. The Governor has ordered all frontier officials to keep a look-out for Paschen and to send him back to Herat if they catch him. Elders of villages have also been ordered to report at once to Herat any traces of him. The Governor is said, however, to have expressed a hope that Herat is rid of Paschen for ever. Paschen, when he left Herat, was wearing his field uniform and is said to have taken no change of clothes with him. Amin is a young man of about 20 years of ave with neither beard nor moustache. He is of medium height and fair com plexion, and speaks Arabic. The Governor is said to have received information from Kabul of the departure of one Turco-German party for Herat via the Hazarajat and a rumour is current in the town to the effect that another party is travelling to Chakansur and will try to cross the frontier. A man who has hitherto given good information says that the Amir was tired of the importunity of the Germans and was convinced, from their lack of proper credentials, that they were not genuine agents of their government and therefore expelled them. He says also that the Germans were long supported by the Naib-us-Saltanah but that as his influence waned they fell into disfavour. The same man says that Pasche n was ordered by his superior Q a ref# eacU I ffitf / tkm:CONFIDENTIAL. 3207 1Q J at % Aleshed Diary No. 22 for the week ending May 27th, 1916. 3130 See Diary No. 21 . The order appointing a committee to carry on the business of the local government has been rescinded and Najd-us-Saltanah, ProXcial Director of Revenue and formerly Assistant to the Governor-Geneml, has been appointed ad mtenm .He has issued instructions to all Governors of districts to the effect that no resignations will be accepted by him and that all must continue to perform their duties until the receipt of orders from the new Governor-General The Karguzar has received three telegrams from the Minister for Foreign Affairs calling upon him to explain various complaints against him. These complaints were made at the instance of Nayyir-ud-Daulah, who will probably continue to work for the Karguzar s dismissal. No great harm will be done if he succeeds The Karguzar is now reconciled with the Telegraph Master, with whom he quarrelled when the latter questioned some of the seals on the telegrams sent to him by the Karguzar for dispatch. Shuja-us-Saltanah, Chief of Police, has been dismissed and Salar-i-Nusrat has been temporarily reappointed under orders from Tehran, Russian Affairs.—See Diary No. 20 . The Turkomans who left Ashkabad for Persian territory appear not to have been but private persons, smugglers by profession. They have been arrested at Meshed, at the instance of my Colleague, by Husain Kuli Khan, chief of the gendarmerie. Six of them had no passports and two others had passports which did not belong to them, but the passports of the rest seem to have been in order. The men were not armed, as previously reported. Najd-us-Saltanah, the Acting Governor, is much annoyed with Husain Kuli Khan for having arrested the men without reference to him or the Karguzar. See Diaries Nos. 17 and 20 . Nusrat-ul-Mulk, Chief of the Taimuris, is in trouble with the Kussians owing to the raiding of Haji Husain Agha’s village. It seems that the charge mentioned in Diary No. 20 was unfounded and that the raid was an attempt by Nusrat-ul-Mulk to assert his claims to the village. Nusrat-ul-Mulk is coming to see me, presumably to enlist my sympathy and ask for help, but I shall not embroil myself with the Russians on his account. Whatever his claims may be, his men had no business to raid the village. German and Persian Intrigues .— Malik-ush-Shuara, a very mischievous democrat and formerly editor of the Nau Bahar, has arrived in Meshed from Tehran with a letter of protection from the Prime Minister. It appears that he was originally ordered to go to Bujnurd but that while on the road he received permission to come to Meshed instead, and the Karguzar has received a telegram from the Minister for Foreign Affairs ordering him to see that nobody molests the man. This mischievous | agitator should not have been permitted to return to Meshed. He has already begun to organize secret meetings, all of which are to be held at places within the sanctuary of the shrine, in order that they may not be disturbed by Russian troops, and it is possible that he may establish communications with Paschen in Herat. $ I informed my Colleague of his return as soon as I heard of it and am discussing with him the course of action to be taken. The man’s return has much encouraged the democrats. News from Turbat-i-Haidari.—kbvl Faiz Khan of Rushkhar has received a telegram from Prince Nasir-ud-Din Mirza, the new Governor-General, appointing him Governor of Turbat-i-Haidari, and Salar-i-Makhsus, the dismissed Governor, is said to be about to leave Turbab.

Mirza Haidar Herati, lessee of Bizhgan, has complained to the Governor of Herat that the Ilbaigi of the Kaudam Taimuns raided his village and has asked for permission to come to Herat and prosecute his claim for compensation against him. News from Herat .—A Khawanin soivar who has returned from the frontier reports that a considerable number of Russian troops tempoianly brough to Panideh and Shaikh Junaid have now been withdrawn and that the garrisons of the frontie rposts are at their normal strength. The Russians are said to be treating the Turkomans very well. A sepoy who was imprisoned on a charge of robbery and murder has been blown from a gun. See Diary No. 2 . Risaldar Ghulam Muhammad Khan, the Jamadar and the Dafadar and sepoys of Anardarra whose absence from their post rendered it possible for Niedermayer’s party to cross the frontier without opposition last year were not after all sent to Kabul, but were detained in Herat. The new Commander of the Troops has now dismissed the Risaldar, the Jamadar and the Dafadar from the service, with orders that they are not to be re-employed, but has, acquitted the sepoys and reinstated them. « The Governor is purchasing horses for government at the rate of 20 or 30 daily. The Governor has sent for some of the leading men of the Lawanis and ordered them to tell their followers not to discuss in Afghanistan the news of foreign coim- tries in which they travel and not to discuss political matters. The thorough medical examination insisted on by the new Commander of the Troops is said to be having a detrimental effect on recruiting, as men resent being ordered to strip. There was also some discontent owing to a rumour of severe tests in running drill for the troops, but the Commander has reassured them on this point. He has, however, warned the troops that they will be expected to improve them selves and has eulogized the system of training followed in the German army. The Governor ordered the Governor of Kuhsan to send the Ilbaigi of the Kaudani Taimuris back to Herat, but according to later information the Ilbaigi has now been ordered to leave Afghanistan. There has been some unpleasantness between the Governor and the ex-Governor. The latter was delaying his departure from Herat and it was suspected that he was intriguing through the Germans for his reinstatement, though he maintained that he was only waiting for transport. The Governor threatened to expel him from the city with ignominy and posted two sentries over his house to see that nobody visited him. The ex-Governor’s protests were fruitless and he thought it prudent to leave the town with two servants and go to Pul-i-Pari, four farsakhs distant,, leaving his baggage and his family behind. The agent paid him a farewell visit at Pul-i-Pari, and the ex-Governor, who highly appreciated the compliment, complained that no retiring Governor had ever been so treated before, and announced his intention of awaiting his family in Obah and then going with them to Kabul by way of the Hazarajat. He also spoke to the agent of German intrigues and assured him that the Amir was endeavouring to improve still further his relations with the British Government and would never be misled by the German refugees, whom he proposed to expel as soon as peace should be established. These comfortable assurances should probably be discounted by the ex-Governor’swish to make some return for the agent’s courtesy. See Diary No. 21 . The Governor has again summoned the representatives of the people and dismissed them to their homes after bestowing on each of them3 a Jchillat.

Ifls noteworthy that the Amir carefuhy refrains from mentioning the British as among those responsible for infringing Persian neutrality. The Russians and the Turks are mentioned. g g Condition of the Country.—Roh^as ,from Kalta Chinar have plundered a caravan of opium which was being exported to Russia and murdered one of the men with the caravan. n i-wi ! 6 robbers are again plundering the Chinaran district and it is said that b°th the Governor and the road guards are in league with them. They have lately carried on six donkey-loads of barley belonging to the Russians. It is reported from Khaf that the Taimuris of that district have joined hands with Kakan and Afghan robbers and have invited the Barbaris to join them. The Karguzar has asked for instructions as to the action to be taken by him m connection with the Ilbaigi raids and as a foreign country is concerned has suggested that a reference be made to the two Consulates General. -^ a yyh’' u cl'Daulah, the Daragaz district is in a most disturbed state. Robbers are active everywhere and the Governor, Mansur-ul-Mulk, is powerless to cope with them. He has been recalled to Meshed.

About May 25th Abul Hasan Khan, Revenue Superintendent of Gunabad who was travelling to Turbat-i-Haidari in a carriage with his family, was attack ed by 30 Afghan or Baluch robbers (probably the latter) near Imbrani. The two gendarmes accompanying him fled and the driver was shot. The robbers then cut the throats of the rest of the party, consisting of Abul Hasan Khan, his wile and child, and a young servant, and killed the horses. Some Cossacks went m pursuit of the robbers but were not sufficiently numerous to attack them. .1 h ear that 15 Afghan robbers are waiting at Rubat-i-Kumai for the remittance coming from Birjand for the Imperial Bank of Persia and I have sent to ask that the caravan may be detained at Kakh until the robbers have been dispersed. News from Kariz. — See Diary No. 21 . Mustafa Khan, acting under the orders of his father Shuja-ul-Mulk, has dismissed all his sowars except 30, whom he pays from his own pocket. Shuja-ul-Mulk refuses to maintain men at his private expense for the Persian Government and insists on the payment of the arrears due to him. He thought of dismissing even the 30 sowars now maintained, but has changed his mind. The dismissal of the sowars has again caused anxiety among the people, who fear that they will be at the mercy of robbers. sowar carrying my post was attacked by six robbers at the ruined village ot Dagharu, but contrived to escape. The same robbers also fired on Mirza Muhsin Khan of Herat, who was travelling to Meshed accompanied by three risala sowars. Mirza Mohsin reports that the camp of the Ilbaigi of the Kaudani Taimuris has been moved to Shabash and that the Ilbaigi himself has been summoned to Herat. Jalal-i-Nizam with his sowars is at Turbat-i-Shaikh-i-Jam.

The former has been stationed for many years at Khaf. The latter has come from Tashkend, I understand, to relieve the former. At Afzulabad they and their two Cossacks came up with the party of Sistani gun-traders mentioned in my Diary No. 19. They seized all the weapons in spite of the owners possessing passes granted by His Excellency Hisam-ud-Dauleh and Mr. Vice-Consul New ! After the Karguzar had successfully invoked the assistance of this Consulate to get the arms released, the Director of Customs interposed his authority and attempted again to confiscate them ! He was ordered from Meshed to consult me on the subject, and on my advis ing him to enquire from Hisam-ud-Dauleh why the arms had already been released in Birjand, he elected to give them up without taking any further action.

Persian Officials. —Sa’id-i-Lashkar has reached Meshed from Tehran to replace Mirza Ismail Khan of the Finance Department, but Najd-us-Saltan ah has successfully protested against the removal of the latter. Mirza Taki Khan has been appointed Financial Superintendent at Turbat-i-Haidari and has left Meshed to relieve Mirza Isa Khan there. Mansur-ul-Mulk, Governor of Daragaz, has arrived in Meshed. The Russian Consul at Turbat-i-Haidari has written to Tun to say that neither he nor the military authorities will accept either Imad-ul-Mulk or Ali Mardan Vakil as Governor of Tabas. The Karguzar is still sending telegrams to Tehran in which he attributes all disturbances and troubles in Khorassan to the maladministration of Nayyir-ud- Daulah. It is rumoured in Meshed that Na 3 yyir-ud-Daulah has been killed in Nishabur by a Russian subject, but the rumour lacks confirmation and according to a more probable report the Persian Government is insisting on Nayyir-ud-Daulah’s going to Tehran. Persian Affairs. —The sudden fall in the price of sugar has brought many of those who were holding up stocks and speculating on a rise to the verge of bankruptcy. The Persians attribute the turn that affairs have taken to the machinations of Meshedi Abdullah, the Russian Tajirbashi, but it seems to be the natural consequence of the removal by the Russian Government of restrictions on the exportation of sugar. I regret to say that Saiyid Ahmad Ali Shah, Chief of one section of the Barbaris, has died of enteric fever. His body was brought to Meshed and interred here with great ceremony. I sent representatives to the funeral and the Chief of Police sent a detachment of police owing to the action of Mustafa Mirza, who is assisting Najd-us-Saltanah in the government, no regular troops attended the funeral, but I am glad to say that Nusrat-ul-Mulk, Chief of the Taimuris, sent a led horse and 20 sowars to receive the body outside the town. This act of courtesy to the Barbaris should heal the feud between them and the Taimuris. The mourning meeting was attended by the Mutwalli Bashi and the Shrine officials, Nusrat-ul-Mulk, Shuja-ul-Mulk, and many respectable Herat! traders, so that Mustafa Mirza’s act of disrespect loses significance. The deceased left two sons, Ahmad aged 13 and Hasan aged 10. He had designated the latter as his successor and the Mutwalli Bashi accordingly invested him with a khillat as a token of his recognition. Saiyid Hasan called on me yesterday. Shahzadah Itibar-ud-Daulah has been intriguing to obtain the post of Chief of Police, but my Colleague declares that he will protest against his appointment. I hear that the Karguzar has been reprimanded by the Prime Minister for showing disrespect to the late Governor-General. Russian affairs. —My Colleague is very displeased with the Karguzar. Persian and German Intrigues. —Malik-ush-Shuara is very careful to hold no meetings of democrats openly. He visits the Karguzar at night and occasionally receives a few of the more energetic democrats, not more than seven or eight m number, before dawn. He made a speech to these the other day, deploring t e present situation, prophesying an approaching change, and boasting of his intimacy and secret influence with the Shah and of his readiness to sacrifice himse or us country.

See Diary No 23 Shuja-ul-Mulk has again changed his mind, and his second son, Yusuf Khan, acting under his orders, has dismissed the 30 Hazara sowars whom he still retained, and now has none. The people of Turbat-i-Shaikh-i-Jam are complaining bitterly of the quartering of soimrs in the town and are calling for their removal on the ground that they can no longer supply them with provisions and fodder. On June 1st Afghan robbers lifteda flock of sheep belonging to the people of the town and other robberies have occurred in the neighbourhood during the past week, but the people evidently prefer visits from robbers to the presence of regular troops. Sarwar Khan and Samandar Khan have joined hands with their followers, at Hashtadan. The latter’s men, on their way thither, robbed a Hazara sowar of his horse and rifle and 20 tumans in cash. News from HeraL-See Diary No. 21. The Governor lately summoned the Postmaster and made inquiries from him about the British Agent’s post. He seems, to have thought that it was carried with the post of Abdullah Khan, the Afghan Trade Agent in Meshed, and could be opened ami examined without fear of detection, but when he discovered that it was carried in special bags he apparently gave up all idea of tampering with it. The Agent reports that the paper Al-Eakilcat, which he distributed freely, is much appreciated and has a good effect. Paschen, at a private interview which he recently had with the Governor, borrowed from him Al-Hakikut and the Illustrated London News supplied to him by me. It is reported that four men, “ Germans or the servants of Germans,” reached the frontier post of Anardara from the west. The commander of the post wished to detain them until he could receive orders from Herat, but they insisted on travelling on towards Kabul. The report lacks confirmation, but it is not unlikely that some fugitive Persian brigands who have been helping the Germans have escaped in this way. See Diary No. 23. Two leaders of the party of Turkomans arrived at Herat about May 26th and the rest of the party, 11 in number, were permitted to follow them and arrived at Herat from Tirpul on May 31st. One of the leaders is Kurban Muhammad Sardar, son of Haji Bai, and is known to the Russians as Khal Chand and the other is Bizkan Bai, known as Jirk Bai. They seem to be well provided with Russian money in gold and notes and they say that they are Yamuts of Merv who rebelled against the Russians. They are probably the Khiva rebels. They profess to have had a force of 40,000 but say that their men could not stand against the Russian artillery. They also say that if the Amir will give them lands they will bring 100,000 families of Turkomans into Afghanistan. They entered Persia between Kalat-i-Nadiri and Daragaz and travelled via Brashk, Paskamar and Turbat-i-Shaikh-i-Jam to Kafir Kal’ah. I am communicating this information to my Russian olleague. On May 28th the two leaders of the Turkomans, at the suggestion of the Governor, visited Paschen, who is said to have complained bitterly to them of the cowardice of the Afghans and to have remarked that if they had joined the Turkomans Russian Turkistan might have been conquered. It is possible that this conversation was reported to the Governor, for on the evening of June 2nd or 3rd Paschen, with two servants, having eluded the escort which accompanied him, fled. When the Governor learnt that he had gone sowars were sent in search of him in all directions, but returned without having found him. The direction which he took is uncertain but it is not likely that he went to seek his discredited countrymen who have been expelled from Kabul and he has probably ccme towards the Persian frontier. All concerned have been warned. He is said to have boasted a short *3 time ago tliat lie would elude botli Eu^ipn ar .^1 i twomen who accompanied him were Ismail Inf C0I fte to Meshed. The Arab.

Miraa Khan, a servant of Paschen who was recently sent towards Kabul bv way of Kandahar, returned to Herat about May 29th. He cannot have reached Kabul but may have brought back from Chakansur news which alarmed Paschen. Condition of Country.—The Khaf district is suffering much from raids by Afghan and Baluchi robbers from Afghanistan who not only rob the people but tether Heir hoises m the standing crops. A gang of Baluchi robbers carrying off camels and Horses was, however, recently attacked by Persian sowars, who killed one robber put the rest to flight, and recovered the plunder. Husain, a Shaikhkanlu Kurd, who has been robbing in the Chinaran district was shot and killed recently by Persian sowars and his gang was put to flight. Villagers m the Sarakhs district have beaten and expelled the officials who were attempting to recover the opium tax from them. i, 0rder , has been restored in the Daragaz district and Kurban Agha, a notorious robber and one of the chief promoters of the disturbances, has been killed by Russians.

Captain Thorburn left Bam, which he had reached the nrevinn S Sir Percy Sykes’ march to Kerman. Both from Dehaneh Baghi and from Khwash I have heard that natives are reporting the movement of a German, lashkar in Kerman Province. On the 21st May it was said to be at Jiruft. It was issuing metal discs to Levies. This must surely be General Sykes’ force. See last week’s diary. Khan Malik, the new (and first) Provincial Director of Revenue, has shown his hand very quickly. Pie has told everyone that Shaukat- ul-Mulk will be reinstated in two or three months’ time. He is staying in the house of Misbeh-i-Diwan, Shaukat’s Mustaufi, and he has sent out 20 or 30 Mamurs — all followers of Shaukat-ul-Mulk — to collect the Ashriyyeh (one tenth) revenue on the rain-crops. In this matter he is upsetting the arrangement made by his predecessor with the Governor, by which the latter’s servants were collecting this revenue. During the last two years Revenue Directors have worked well with the local Government, so that the Department has been able to reduce the number of its Sowars, who used to be an unruly lot, requisitioning instead the assistance of the Military whenever any force was required, Khan Malik has now begun to enlist Sowars for his own Department. On the 5th June I telegraphed to Khan Malik advising him to leave the house of Misbeh-i-Diwan and not to intrigue against the Governor, whom I was prepared to support strongly. I also advised Misbeh-i-Diwan to leave Birjand as he had only remained there under my advice and on condition that he did not intrigue. On the 6th J une I received conciliatory replies promising compliance from both gentlemen. The same day I received a message through the Vice-Consulate, from M. de Bravine, my Russian colleague, expressing approval of my actions and promising support. It remains to be seen whether Khan Malik will change h s attitude. I have not much hope of him, as he undoubtedly has been bribed by Shaukat-ul-Mulk. Lines being constructed there.

His illness was diagnosed as enteric by the Senior Sub-Assistant Surgeon at Birjand on the 2nd Jufe This officer and Military Assistant Surgeon S. N. Bate attended him to the last TW were in constant consultation telegraphically with Major Heron at Sistan The patient was assiduously nursed by the five Englishmen at Birjand and I think that everything possible was done for him. Jtme 12th.—I hear that Brigadier-General Sir Percy Sykes reached Kerman yesterday. June 15th .—Captain Hamilton, R.E., left Sistan for Robat The Persian Government have graciously remitted all passport fees on the feistani labourers going down to Robat to work on the motor road —a concession of about 13,200 Krans. June 16th. I hear that Captain Thorburn reached Kerman yesterday “after a very good journey, all going strong.” Kainat affairs. See last week’s diary. I have received a letter dated the 5th June from Khan Malik in which he states : “ The Legation have told me — (!) They have no grudge against Shaukat-ul-Mulk or his friends. I may be friendly with them. (2) Being Revenue Director, I should over rule Amir Hissam-ud-Dauleh fully, and should bring him to submission to me as he is not a man of upright character. (3) I should work in co-operation with Major Prideaux and keep him fully informed.” It seems a pity that, being unable to see Mr. New on account of his illness, Khan Malik did not communicate with me before starting on his hostile campaign against the Governor. The Governor has complained to me bitterly of the treatment he is receiving from Tehran, and he has also addressed a letter direct, I hear, to His Majesty’s Minister. He points out that a new Judge, a new Revenue Director, and a new Military Commander (a Sarhaddar) have been appointed to Birjand without his being consulted, and he suspects that all these have been nominated by Shaukat-ul-Mulk. He might also have complained of the removal of the Karguzar and the Revenue Director in Sistan, 'who are at least neutral if not his friends. The revival of the Sarhaddari I certainly attribute to Shaukat-ul-Mulk, as in the latter’s time the post was absorbed in the Governor’s office. It is an objectionable appointment as the holder is independent of the other Local Authorities. Having little to do, he generally either intrigues or quarrels with the Afghan authorities, and ends by sending unreliable reports to Tehran. There seem to be three causes for the Governor’s (and incidentally our) mismisfortune — * . * ’ * &gt; Llasaivad on 11 AU 4 j ;)j (j''H^h 1 INDIA FOREIGN SEBBETARY’S letter.

I am told by Basir-us-Saltaneh that he will have to pay at least 3,000 Tomans for his next appointment. German Emissaries. The negro servant of Herr Paschen—see Meshed Diary ^No. 22 for the week ending the 27th May 1916-—has been sent to the Consulate by the Karguzar. The lad, who is 18 years of age, had been formerly in the service of M. V. Koman- ovski at Meshed. He had now been brought down as far as Lash Juwain by Afghan guards, who released him across the border into northern Mian Kangi, a Kadkhuda of which district sent him to the Karguzari. His proper name is Kaka Mas’ud. He was born in Shiraz. I strongly suspect that he came to spy out a road, as he gave out in Mian Kangi that he w^as on his way to Kala-i-Kang, and therefore not travelling westwards. Baluch robbers. I hear from Duroh that four Baluch Maldars (graziers) of Duroh who had visited Sistan for the purpose of buying grain have been killed by 30 Zarakzais from Rud-i-Harut. Some Persian Sowars from Duroh under one Ali Jan have gone after the robbers. Indo-European Telegraph Department.

The Sartip is notoriously in the pay of Shaukat-ul-Mulk. Sarhad Affairs. I hear that General Dyer has held a second Durbar at Kacha on the 30th Anril and taken a signed Agreement from the Sardars of the Reki, Yar Ahmedzai Gamshadzai and Ismailzai tribes. Sardar Khudadad Khan has informed me by telegraph of his safe arrival at Kacha, with Mir Jehind, Sardar Juma Khan Ismailzai and other Sarhaddi Sardars. Arms traffic. A party of Sistanis, 14 men, 1 woman and 5 children, have been caught by our Hazara Levies between Sari Chah and Haman (west of Sarbisheh) and taken into Birjand. They had biougnt from Ispahan on 47 donkeys the following assortment of arms : 1 magazine rifle, 142 breech-loading rifles (old Martini, Werndel and other patterns), 34 muzzle-loading guns, 7 revolvers and pistols, 19 axes, 2 swords and 7,000 cartridges. They had left Sistan a year ago with 380 cows for sale in the interior of Persia. The Governor knew all about them and said that they had carried on the same traffic for years. Their purchases were intended for sale in Kainat and Sistan. He asked that they and their property might be released, promising to buy the most serviceable rifles himself. I am agreeing to the proposal as the local transporting and selling of arms does not seem to be prohibited by the Persian Government. At the same time, it seems desirable that the Hazaras should be rewarded for their zeal and alertness. Afghan robbers. On May 3rd a party of 15 sepoys of the 19th Punjabis were escorting a number of unloaded camels to Ban dan from Sistan. They were attacked in the darkness, when baiting at Hauz-i-Nimeh, by a strong band of Afghans, who succeeded in killing one sepoy, pounding two others and driving off 17 camels.

Russian Affairs. —My Colleague is still occupied in collecting large numbers of men for work on railways in Russia. Persian and German Intrigues.—The democrats recently held a meeting at which the news of the surrender of Kut-al-Amarah was welcomed. They amplified this news by the announcement that Verdun had fallen and that the Germans were advancing on Paris. _ The meeting was not, however, well attended. Many democrats wish to withdraw from the society and to recover, on payment the written records of their oaths. News from Turbat-i-Haidari.—About six weeks ago M. Mikhailoff, the Russian Consul, on learning that written complaints against him were being sent to Tehran, visited the Post office and confiscated some letters which he found there. The Post Master reported the matter and it appears that the Consul was reprimanded, for he has since made himself unpleasant to the Post Master. It is now easy to understand why Colonel Gushchin and M. Samsonoff wish me to address my letters to them under cover to our Agent. Mirza Aristu Khan, Assistant to the Governor of Tabas, was arrested by the Cossacks in Gunabad, but the Officer in Command there has been reprimanded by Colonel Gushchin. It is again reported that M. Mikhailoff is to be transferred from Turbat. News from Kariz. —The Agent at Kariz gives a detailed list of the recent depredations of the Ilbaigi of the Kaudani Taimuris. It seems that he carried off from Turbat-i-Shaikh-i-Jam and seven villages in that district property worth 52,000 tumans, consisting largely of, but not confined to, sheep and cattle. When he reached Kuhsan with his plunder the Afghan Governor was very angry with him and openly accused him of attempting to sow discord between Afghanistan and Persia. The Governor confiscated many of the sheep and cattle lifted by the Ilbaigi and Afghan robbers associated with him and restored them to their owners after deducting 10 per cent for his trouble.

After announcing that stens were to be taken to prohibit opium smoking and the cultivation of the poppy, and that a durbar hall was to be built in the Chahar Bagh, he read the pamphlet referred to in Diary No. 13 and descrioed, in the Amir’s own words, what had passed at two durbars held by the Amir himself at Kabul. This address was little more than a speech in favour of unity and concord, but it contained two important passages. One ran as follows : I wisir to inform you of the great w T ar now m progress, the result of which nobody can foresee, so that it is impossible to say who will be victorious ; but we must be attentive to our own interests and prepared to defend our country, and this cannot be effected without unity and concord.” The other lan as follows : “I wash the representatives of each tribe to select one from among themselves to represent them permanently at the capital in order that I may have always at hand representatives whom I may consult. The expenses of such representatives will be paid by the government. ” It appears that all this business of summoning representatives who again are to elect representatives is merely a device to gain time, in order that fanatics may not rush the country into war, that all may have time to see how the war is going to end, and that the war party may not be enabled to say that no stens are beiny taken. ' ' ' ‘ , Condition oj Country .— The Governor of Khaf reports that a gang of Afghan robbers visited his district and that he dispersed and pursued them, but he expects more raids. Taimuris are said to be committing robberies in the Zurabad district. T. W.

If Nayyir-ud-Daulah is prepared to seize tne Ilbaigi there is some reason m his request, but otherwise the Ilbaigi had b^ter remain where he is, for the Afghan officials seem to be inclined to restrain ^ tromrmdmg m future. A hundred Persian sowars left Meshed for Turbat-i- bhaikh Jam three days ago, but they will arrive too late to do anything, for the ikaigi has already returned into Afghan territory. The Governor-General has attempted to extort from Kurban Agha of Daragaz who was m Meshed to prosecute his case against Riza Khan and Zabardast Khan blaragaz, 3,000 tumans, and Kurban Agha, being unable to pay this sum, has ned from Meshed. Zabardast Khan has accordingly returned from Meshed to Daragaz to forestall any attempt by Kurban Agha to create trouble in Daragaz. inis case is a fair example of the manner in which Nayyir-ud-Daulah’s cupidity militates against the efficient administration of the province. Had he not attempted to extort money from Kurban Agha a very troublesome case should have been m a fair way to being settled. Agha Mirza Ibrahim, an influential Mujtahid of the old school, who was opposed to the Persian imitation of western constitutional methods of government, died m Meshed on May 7th.

Husam Bala, a Russian subject who was deported from Meshed, is said to have returned to the town m disguise, with two other ruffians, and those whose complaints led to his deportation are anxious for their safety. Persian and German Intrigues.—Two German prisoners, who had escaped from r iutsk, entered Persian territory lately in the Daragaz district but were arrested at bhirvan and handed over to the Russian Agent at Kuchan, who has sent them back to Russia. hews from Turbat-i-IIaidarL — Salar Khan Baluch is said to have sent his aimly to Herat.

The Kaudanis left Jamrud and encamped on the bank of the Hari Rud to await the arrival of the Ilbaigi, and have since joined il 1 a m Ka !’ ah A%h an territory. The Kaudanis have already attacked other Taimuris in Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam, plundered them, killed four and carried oit hve as prisoners, among whom were Amir Kuli, suspected of having reported the Ilbaigi to the Russians, and Mahdi Kuli, who used to supply news to the British gent in Kariz. Samandar Khan, a well-known ruffian of Jamrud, threatens to raid Kariz and Sarwar Khan’s gang was seen lurking, on April 30th, in the neighbourhood of Kariz, apparently with a view of making a raid on the place. The baigi and Mir Baki Sultan threaten to raid the place and put all the inhabitants to death. Shuja-ul-Mulk, who should be protecting this frontier, but is in Meshed, makes light of this threat, but the people of Kariz are much alarmed and Shuja- ul-Mulk himself has brought his family and his movable property into Meshed,2 -m. »**•?*£ srx M ¥i;f there is at present no provision for them. 1 J, h « 0 f 150 sowars.

The new Governor has met the representatives of the people and has made a very conciliatory speech to them. After conveying to them an expression of the Amir’s good-will towards them he announced that it was not true that the Amir intended to call on one family in every eight to provide a recruit for the Army. The new Commandant has ordered the Officer Commanding the Arti ery o select 50 smart men for more advanced training, after receiving which they will be sent to Kabul for examination. He has also announced that the Amir proposes to send 12 new guns to Herat. The new Governor is said to have in his service two sepoys who deserted Irom a regiment in Quetta and were picked up by him in Kandahar. The Ilbaigi of the Kaudani Taimuris arrived at Herat on April 19th and three days later visited the new Governor, who bestowed a khillat on him He is said to have escaped from the train on the way to Bukhara wd to have entered Afghanistan by way of Chihil Dukhtaran, where he was helped by Sardar Yar Muhammad Khan. Condition of Country.—N Turkoman raid is expected at Miyandasht. There are prospects of a disturbance in Nardin. A large number of Kurds from Buinurd are occupying waste Government land and taking possession o ruined lanats and the people of Nardin are likely to make an attempt to oust them. Muhammad Zabihullah of Zushk is again active. He and 25 of his men have been the guests of the Shikaris in the Chinaran district and have plundered many villages there. From one village they carried off six horses and mares. T. W. HAIG, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General and Agent to the Government of India in Khorassan, Meshed. G. M.

I hear that it is decided that Shuia-us- Sultan is to be dismissed and Salar-i-Nnsrat appointed Chief of Police in his place. There is some difficulty in assisting Najat, Ain-ud-Daulah’s agent in Meshed as the Governor-Genera is intriguing against him and has tried, though unsuccess fully, to persuaae my colleague to insist on his removal from Meshed It does not suit Nayyir-ud-Daulah to have an active or influential agent in charge of Ain-ud- Daulah s affairs and property m the province, and he has already deported Muiallal- ut-Tauhya, who has been assisting Najat in his business and has ordered Naiat himself to leave Meshed for Fanman, where Ain-ud-Daulah’s property is situated. office 8 ^^^-^!?^^ MirZa LaS been re ' appointed t0 the Persian telegraph Persian Affairs—There is some trouble in the town owing to the high prices of provisions and there is talk of organizing bast in the two Consulates-General. Bread is selling at Krans 2 20, mutton at 1 tuman and raughan at 4 tumans the man. Harvest prospects are excellent and there is plenty of good grazing. The reason given by the Persian authorities for these high prices is the presence of Russian troops m the province but their numbers are not sufficient to cause any rise in prices. The Governor-General is personally responsible m this matter. He is holding up his own grain and he and Najd-us-Saltanah, Director of Finance, have purchased^ at low rates a large quantity of Government grain,^ which likewise they are holding up. My colleague is very angry with Nayyir-ud-Daulah who, having obtained permission to sell Government grain to the Russian troops, now refuses to let them have it below current market rates, which are artificially inflated by Nayyir-ud-Daulah himself. The permission to sell Government grain is thus reduced to a mere formality, as the troops can obtain grain at current rates in the open market. I hear that the Governor-General intends to deport from Meshed six men, including Munshi-yi-Nizam, formerly Chief of Police, Yamin-ud-Daulah, Imad- us-Saltanah, Chief of the Provincial Court of Justice and Haji Husain, a tailor. Against the removal of the first named, who has already been obliged to live beyond the limits of the town, there is nothing to be said. The tailor has already been sent to Kalat-i-Nadiri as being a friend of the Karguzar. Of Yamin-ud-Daulah, who has lately come from Tehran, I know nothing. I have referred to Imad-us- Saltanah, and the Karguzar’s cause of complaint against him, in Diary No. 15, The Governor-General objects to him as he is likely to administer justice more or less efficiently and thus keep many cases out of Nayyir-ud-Daulah’s hands. My colleague is much annoyed with the Governor-General for having misled him about Imad-us-Saltanah’s character and induced him to telegraph to the Russian Minister on the subject. See Diary No. 16. After the sowars of the late Muhammad Kurshabadi had been put to flight by the Russians the Persian sowars pursued them, killing one and capturing two. The question of the disposal of Muhammad’s property is still under discussion. Russian Affairs .—Taimuris have again raided, as they did last year, the village of Haji Husain Agha in the Zurabad district, which is mortgaged to the Russian Bank. The Cossacks at Sabzavar have orders to seize the arms of all Persian sowars whether Government servants or not, unless they are covered by a permit from me or my colleague. The Russians have now allowed a large number of sheep, which were detain ed at Sarakhs, as customs duty was not paid, to cross the frontier into Persia.

I hear that Ahmad Agha (Diary No. 5), who has been sent to Odessa, is excepted from this arrangement. The democrats in Meshed are again trying to revive their courage by the manufacture of news favourable to the German cause, and the Central Committee at lehran is said to have sent a warning to the effect that seceders will be punished when events take a turn in favour of the democrats. The Secretary of the Meshed Committee says^ that, according to inquiries made during the last three or four months, 3,852 rifles, revolvers, and automatic pistols are in the possession of the party m Khorassan.

It is reported that tbe messengers of tbe German party m Herat now travel by Pul-i-Khatun. It is also reported that six Germans have lately airived m Herat, having travelled in disguise by way of Karn, but this report is probably untrue. News from ffera*.—Paschen has made an unsuccessful attempt to see the representatives of the people in the garden where they are lodged. He and his servants are again circulating news of German victories and of the intention of the Germans to send troops into Afghanistan The harvest is the time now fixed for their arrival. Paschen is much annoyed by the prevalnce of pro-Bn ish feeling in Herat and especially so by the suspicion that much of the consideration , shown to him is due to the belief that he is a British officer m disguise. He is also depressed by the apparent hopelessness of the German party being able to effect anything in Afghanistan. Tbe Governor recently drew a cheque for Rs. 16,000 (Kabuli) on the treasury and on the treasurer objecting that the cheque did not bear the name of the payee, ordered him to enter it as having been cashed m accordance with a larman from the Amir. The British agent has visited the representatives of the people, given them all the latest news from the front, and especially from Asia Minor, and warned them against being misled by empty promises of German support. The new Governor and Commander of Troops arrived from Kabul on April 19th and were received with due ceremony. The British agent went out with the old Governor to meet them. It has not yet been ascertained whether Paschen or any of his gang have had an opportunity of visiting them, but they have apparently received letters from Kabul, with the contents of which they profess to be pleased. The tone of the Simj-ul-Akhbar has long been pro-German and most objectionable, and seems to be growing worse. This is unfortunate, as the paper has some influence owing to its being generally understood to be a semi-official publication. T. W.

On April 20th news was received at Dehaneh Baghi from Sipeh by telephone that some Baluchis, supposed to be Alishah’s people, had arrived from Narmashir and were going to loot the Telegraph Office, besides removing their families into safety out of our reach. At day-break on April 21st Captain James with Cavalry went to Sipeh and found that all was well there. The origin of the report was the return of seven Telegraph GJiulaivis —residents of Fahreh—who had deserted some months previously and entered German service. They had repaired the line from Bam to Sipeh, under instructions from the Persian Telegraph Master at Bam, and now asked to be forgiven and taken back into service. They were arrested and will be sent to Sistan pending the consideration of their case. A short term of imprisonment and forfeiture of their past service seems to be the least amount of punishment which should be inflicted on them. The Governor's Family of Kainat and Sistan. —(1) A son and heir was born on April 22nd to the wife of Shaukat-ul-Mulk. The same lady had previously borne two daughters, none of the other wives having children. (2) Hissam-ud-Dauleh has informed Mr. Vice-Consul New that Shaukat-ul- Mulk has already begun intriguing in Tehran. The Farman appointing the former to the Governorship of the Province is being withheld pending the receipt of 1,000 tomans demanded by one Abdul Husain Khan, a Secretary in the Ministry of the Interior. # A petition against the appointment of Hissam-un-Dauleh has been signed in Birjand by adherents of Shaukat-ul-Mulk and is to be posted from Gunabad. (3) Haidar Ali Khan—see Diary No. 14—has refused the appointment of Deputy Governor of Kain. He is said to be afraid of getting into trouble with the Russians. Mirza Ali Akbar Khan, formerly Nazir to the late Hissam-ud-Dauleh, has now been nominated to the Deputy Governorship. The Persian Military Forces. —Hissam-ud-Dauleh has appointed Murtaza Kuli Khan, his brother-in-law from Tehran, to be Inspector of the Troops vice Shahzada Muhammad Taki Mirza. Afghan Bobbers. —On April 16th a convoy of 42 camels, including unloaded animals, was proceeding to Bandan from Lab-i-Baring. A quantity of flour was being taken to Neh for the Hazara Levy Corps. The escort was only eight Sistani Levies under a Hazara Havildar, there being detachments of regulars at each end of the road also. Fifty Afghanistan Baluchis attacked the convoy at Hauz-i-Nimeh and carried off all the camels. All the flour except six bags was thrown to the ground and eventually recovered.

April 2M.—Major Hawley, 28th Light Cavalry, and Captain Wise, Com manding Sistan Levies, arrived at Sistan from Robat and Girdi respectively. April 28th. —General Dyer and all the Sarhaddi Sardars arrived at Kacha. The Governing Family of Sistan and Kainat. —See last week’s diary. Hissam- ud-Dauleh says that he has intercepted a letter which clearly proves that the Mujtehid of Birjand, Agha Sheik Hadi, Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s chief supporter, has been intriguing against him. He has also received from Abdul Husain, Secretary to the Minister of the Interior, another telegram repeating the demand for money and also one in cypher from the Ministry of the Interior confirming the one mentioned in last week’s diary. Hissam believed that Abdul Husain may have telegraphed in cypher without the knowledge of his Minister. It seems desirable that Shaukat-ul-Mulk should be expelled from Tehran as quickly as possible, if we are not to lose Hissam-ud-Dauleh’s confidence in our ability and inclination to retain him in office. Hissam-ud-Dauleh is reported by Mr. New to be helping our Birjand Detach ment loyally to get grain and also in every other waiy. The scarcity of supplies in Kainat is very serious, and our Contractor is importing even from Meshed and Turbat-i-Haideri. Baluch Raiders. —See last week’s diary. No further encounters have taken place. The loot recovered from the lashkar is being returned to the owners who have appeared in considerable numbers at Dehaneh Baghi and Girdi. I suggested to the latter that they should give five per cent, of the sheep and goats recovered to the troops concerned, and this was willingly agreed to. It is generally believed in Sistan that the Ismailzai lashkar was very severely punished, and it is thought unlikely that they will give further trouble in the near future. ^ Alishah Khan has written to Nazar Jan, Jemadar of our Levies, asking where his son has been buried. General Dyer's Expedition. —My information at present is rather meagre. The force, I believe, reached Kwash, Mir Jehind’s headquarters, on about April 14th. On April 20th a rumour reached Sistan from Panjgur that our troops had defeated Jehind on about April 17th. i On April 21st a telegram dated April 17th from Nokabad was received stating that Mir Jehind and Shah Sowar, Yar-Ahmedzais, and Halil Khan Gam- shadzai had come into the camp and offered their submission. The General was proceeding to Galugan to deal with Sardar Juma Jehil Ismailzai. On April 24th the news reached Kuh Malik Siah that in the fight with the Damanis a son of Mir Jehind and two other Sarhad notables had been killed. On April 21st General Dyer sent a message that he was at Shandak with the Sardars on that date. This reached me on April 26th. On April 27th I heard that General Dyer was at Galugan on 24th and that Sardar Juma Jehil had surrendered to him. On April 28th General Dyer reached Kacha with all the Sarhaddi Sardars.. Afghan Robbers. —(1) On the morning of April 27th Captain Blackwell, who was on his way to Neh with a convoy escorted by 20 Punjabi Infantry and five Hazara Levies, was attacked by a party of 30 Afghans who had entienched themselves at Hauz-i-Nimeh between Baring and Bandan. A running fight ensued and the gang was severely punished, four being killed and five or six wounded. There were no casualties on our side. The leader of the robbers seemed 1° be an old Mulla who was wounded, but refused to surrender, and eventually was shot dead.Register No. •— Minute Paper.

April 3rd. —Thirteen non-commissioned officers and sowars of the 28th Light Cavalry left Birjand for Meshed in relief of the Consulate-General guard A recruiting party of eight men of the 106th Hazara Pioneers also left Biriand for Meshed. April 5th. —A massed force under command of Brigadier-General Dyer left Robat for Sarhad to punish the Yar Ahmedzais and other tribes of Daman for raiding the Nushki-Robat trade route. Major McGowan, Captains Landon and Hornsby and 2nd-Lieutenants Hurst and Duncan, I believe, accompanied the force : also Sardars Khudadad Khan Narui of Sistan and Taj Muhammad Reki of Sarhad. ' April M.—Major Claridge and 9 sabres, 28th Light Cavalry, left Sistan for Robat. April 7th. —Captain Thorburn, I.M.S., Commanding Hazara Levies, reached Sistan from Neh. Afghan gun-runners. —On March 26th a party of 35 Afghans entered the pass 6 miles west of Nasratabad Sipeh and were encountered by a party of Punjab Infantry and Sistan Camel Levies under Captain Bennett and Major Heron, I. M. S. They retired carrying off a levy scout as prisoner. One Afghan was wounded severely. One levy was grazed by a bullet. On April 3rd the captured levy returned to Nasratabad Sipeh and reported that the Afghans numbered 100 men : they had 70 camels, each loaded with 40 rifles, and 10 camels loaded with ammunition. ,;iU On April 5th the Afghan caravan “ of about 30 camels ” crossed the Baring- Bandan road at day-break and safely reached the border. They were seen by a cavalry patrol about 6 miles from Baring but were not interfered with. If this caravan was only a portion of the whole it seems probable that the remainder crossed the road a few hours previously. Baluch raiders. —News was received on 6th April at 8 p.m., that a Sarhaddi comprising Ismailzais, under Sardar Juma son of Jehil, Gurgich under Haji son of Gulab, and Neruis under Mirza Khan, son of Sherdil (and brother of Alishah Khan), estimated at 1,000 men, was at Garagheh 12 miles west of Dehaneh Baghi. It appeared probable that the lashkar intended to attack Mr. Dormer, who was at Dehaneh with only 12 rifles of the 19th Punjabis and 4 Baluch jambazes supplied as personal escort by the Karguzar of Sistan. Sardar Juma Jehil, like Mir Jehind, it will be remembered, had ignored General Dyer’s overtures. Captain Bennet at once proceeded with a part of his force from Sipeh to Dehaneh. The tashkar, however, at midnight, passed on northwards and it became apparent that their main object was to loot the flocks of the Shebak and Murrai tribes, who really are under the jurisdiction of Neh, and incidentally of any Sistanis which might be grazing between the Palang Koh range and the Hamun. Lieutenant-Colonel Wikeley set out with 50 rifles from Robat on the night of April 6th. He returned the next day from Hurmak on hearing by telephone from Koh Malik Siah that Dehaneh Baghi had not been attacked. Afghan robbers. —It is reported from Duroh that some camels laden with wheat, owned by Sistani Baluchis of Chah Makri, have been recently carried off across the border. Other robberies between Bandan and Duroh have also been committed—by the same band probably.2 The Governing Familgof Kamatjl and Sistan.—l hear that Shaukat-ul-Mulk reached Tehran to-day (April 8th). wksam ud-Dauleh has appointed Ali Akbar Beg, of pro-German notoriety, grain-collecting will now be devoted to our side. tt • • /’ll A fab an authorities in Chakhansur have ”'* ■ 11 — ro '“ bk ,h *‘ they may give their guard the slip.

On April 9th Major Heron, Lieutenant Dehaneh Baghi 6 remamder of our infantr 7 and levies at Sipeh moved up to T^i^Pril ^ iea ^ ^at the Sarhaddis had collected 45 flocks of sheep and goa s (about 200 animals in a flock) at Kuzegu and had started on their homeward journey. On this date our force at Dehaneh Baghi moved out to Geragheh. On April 12th the lashkar was at Kilagar, and our force at Girdi under Captains Wise and James moved out towards Baluchab. Forty Punjabi infantry, who had been sent out from Robat under a Jemadar on April 11th, were at Hurmak on this date. On April 13th our Dehaneh Baghi force of 85 Punjabi infantry and 117 Sistan camel levies engaged a Sarhad force of about 600 raiders in the Leradik valley, rhe battle lasted all day. At sunset a division of the lashkar got away with a con siderable number of flocks. They also succeeded in carrying off 22 of our baggage camels. They left, however, 40 or 50 dead and carried away a number of wounded. Our losses were Lieutenant Chalmers and 9 native ranks killed, 15 native ranks and 5 levies wounded. Our force retired to Dehaneh Bhagi. Eighteen sepoys, including 3 wounded, had become detached from the main body and fled straight into Kuh Malik Siah, where they reported on April 14th that all the rest of the force had been captured or killed. The body of Lieutenant Chalmers was brought in to Dehaneh Baghi by Captain Bonnett on April 16th. On April 16th Captain Wise’s party fell in with the rear half of the same lashkar, comprising 300 men, at Gorastani near Gorandi. They had some of our captured k a gg a g e camels with officers and men’s kits and 5 boxes of Government ammunition with them as well as about 200 sheep.

Shahzada Hashim Mirza has moved to Nishabur under the orders of the Governor-General. of 100 Hazara sowars on the frontier to prevent a recurrence of such incidents. 1 hear, however, that he intends to maintain only 30 sowars and to pocket the pay o± the remainder. According to later information the Afghans were not in search of Mirza Hassan Khan, our Agent, but were taking revenge on behalf of an Afghan * smuggier whose goods had been confiscated by Mirza Hassan Khan, the Customs 44 -i ✓-it I ’ The ^ question of permits for rifles carried by Persian sowars in Government employ is still giving trouble. At present the Persian authorities agree to the signature of such permits by Russian officials in the case of road guards only, and not in the case of other sowars. Owing to this objection a remittance of Krans 600,000 from Birjand for the Imperial Bank of Persia may be delayed on the road, but I am doing what I can in the matter. Zabardast Khan and Riza Khan have reached Meshed from Daragaz and it may be hoped that the quarrels which have been giving trouble there will be settled here. British Affairs. —L\eutenant-Colonel Redl arrived at Meshed on April 4th. Russian Affairs. —On April 2nd a dispute occurred between a party of Russian Cossacks and Muhammad Kurshabadi, who had gone out with his sowars to spend the 13th day after the Nauruz at Kal’ah-i-Baghshan. The dispute appears to have been connected with the question of permits for rifles. Muhammad and some of his men were killed. The removal of Muhammad is an excellent thing for the province but my Colleague objects to the manner of it, for Muhammad, though a brigand, was for the time being an official of the Persian Government. There is a difference of opinion regarding the disposal of Muhammad’s property. The Russians wish to attach it in compensation for robberies committed on Russian sub jects, but the Governor-General, who suffered considerable loss at the hands of Muhammad, wishes to take it for himself. According to a report from Merv, the Kagan-Termez railway line has recently been completed. A Russian subject has taken possession of some lands at Daragaz and the Karguzar is objecting to his action on the ground that all the land at Daragaz is Khalisa and that it cannot be occupied in satisfaction of private debts. Persian and German Intrigues. —The Karguzar has received orders from Tehran to arrest all agents of the Germans and Turks, and I am urging him to arrest, in pursuance of these orders, Han Muhammad Ja’far Kashmiri, the local leader of the democrats and the most mischievous man '2 i - fna fViat three battalions under to ., wo a— .h,. .i™. over to the late Karguzar for imprisonment until the end bv him before bis departure from Meshed. by h 7 ■ tt j ■ Revenue Superintendent and eight other News from Turhat-i-Haidan. lhe German agents have been acquitted. i*.™ *'• ■ « ** t ' ” “V” 8 TZ vL. .kw •« «o o~.

The Governor-General wishes to imprison Riza Khan, who has come from Daragaz, and my colleague refuses to protect the man, although he is the son-in-law of the Russian agent at Daragaz. The Karguzar is, however, interfering m the case. Mirza Ali Garichi, a well-known ruffian of Bajgiran, who is a Russian subject, has been imprisoned for having arrested at Bajgiran and sent to Kuchan a rersian subject whom he accused of being a Bahai. question of the disarmament of Persian sowars by Russian Cossacks is still causing trouble and the Governor-General complains bitterly of the seizure of some of the property of Muhammad Kurshabadi by the Cossacks. The Russians are said to be engaging large numbers of Persian labourers for work m Russia. Persian and German Intrigues .—The democrats have again begun to hold occasional secret meetings at which absurd stories of the war, of the Amir’s inten tion to declare war and of the prospect of the expulsion of the British and Russians from Persia are circulated. It appears, however, that these stories are received with suspicion and the meetings will probably be discontinued, as Haji Muhammad Ja far Kashmiri, the local leader of the democrats {see Diary No. 15) has been seriously alarmed by a tvarning which he has received from the Karguzar. He had the effrontery to send a message to me, seeking my protection, but was informed that if he entered the Consulate-General he would be surrendered to any person requiring him.

Th , c Command erof the Troops has revived and repeated to the troops the story that Paschen is an Englishman m disguise. The story has been repeated to raschen and has greatly excited him. There is some competition for the membership of the meeting of representatives of the people which is to be held shortly at Herat and it is said that the meeting will be attended by 120 representatives. Paschen has borrowed from the Treasury, on the Governor’s authority a further sum of Hs. 5,000 (Ivabuh) and has spent most of it in Gazurgah 5 it is said in hiring more men to cross the frontier and bring him news. Paschen, while drilling his Austrians, has recently had an accident, having somehow contrived to fall down and lame himself. Condition of Country. —Afghan robbers are still robbing caravans on the Sarakhs road. A Russian Cossack has been wounded at Hisar by a Caucasian Turk, a well- known smuggler, who was being pursued, but managed to get away. T. W.

The latter, besides Paschen himself, now consists of ten Austrians, and five Musalman servants with six horses and four mules. A messenger for Paschen, named Mirza Khan, has reached Dahana-i-Zulfikar and is to be taken to Herat. Paschen has hired another messenger at Gazurgah and sent him to Khaf apparently in order to discover whether the frontier is closely watched m that direction. The representatives elected by the people are beginning to arrive at Herat. | News from Kabul.—A correspondent in Kabul reports that the Amir will not i proclaim jihad, though many of the people wish him to do so. Condition of Counrij/.-Shuja-ud-Daulah, Governor of Kuchan sent a small force against Vali Khan, who defeated it. Shuja-ud-Daulah is now himselt attacking Vali Khan with a larger force. T. W.

Secret .— Telegrams have been passing between the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Karguzar regarding the action of the Kussian Cossacks in Sabzavar, who have been searching houses, ostensibly for arms. The Karguzar has replied that all the trouble is due to the two parties in the town, headed by Haji Mirza Husain Mujtahid and Haji Ismail Mujtahid whose quarrels and reports against one another were the original cause of Cossacks being sent to Sabzavar. He said that the dispute had been settled for the present and that all was now quiet. I hear that the Governor-General has once more sent in his resignation on the ground that the Russians are interfering in the internal administration of the province. The officials of the Shrine are quarrelling. The new Mutawalli Bashi, who has brought some hungry subordinates with him, is raising rents and has fallen foul of Shuja-ut-Tauliyah, a noted ruffian among the permanent officials. Russian affairs. Secret. —The Karguzar has telegraphed to Tehran regarding a complaint of the seizure of a quantity of grain by the Russians in Turshiz, which is said to have been collected for the poor, and has asked that the Russian Consul in Turbat-i-Haidari, who is not subordinate to the Consul-General in Meshed, may be directed to prevent high-handed measures of this nature. The people of Turbat-i-Haidari and Gunabad are alarmed by a rumour that the Russians intend to disarm them. Persian and German Intrigues .— See Diary No. 43 of 1915. I hear that Pasha Khan and Rukn-ul-Islam were sent to Tehran by the orders of the Persian Govern ment some time ago, that the Governor-General *informed my colleague of their departure in order that he might have them arrested on the road if he saw fit, but that M. Nicolsky took no action. It is now said that they are returning to Meshed with two other ruffians. The Governor-General has sent orders for their arrest to Sabzavar and Nishabur and intends to have them deported to Russia.

He adds that Sistams are entering Afghanistan to purchase grain as it is not procurable in Sistan. There are rumours in Herat of military operations to he taken in Afghamstan after tbe Nauruz. Spp Diary No 8 . It appears that when W . Paschen left Herat for the frontier two Austrians, one named Jawisch (?) and the other, who called himselt a Mussal- rhnlam'Riza were sent to Chakansur, ostensibly on route for Kandaha . H is now ^id tlmt they have returned to Sabzavar (Afghanistan) on the ground that thev fell ill on their way. It is possible that they attempted to cross the frontier ancffound it useless to do so. One of the sowars who escorted them and afterwards returned to Herat called on the British Agent and questioned him about the Dih- i-Salm affair.

He has also informed Paschen that some more Austrian fugi i have reached Bala Murghab and will be brought to Herat. Sardar, the German messenger from Herat to Persia, is said to have.writteii from Meshed to Paschen in Herat saying that the person with whom he had (probably Prince Henry XXXI of Reuss) was not in Tehran, but that he (bardar) was going by post to Tehran and would go on thence to Kermanshah.3 GCTnmT £°'? rnor won ^«rful storie, of Condition of Country. and hadkhuias from tha frontier near Shi™,, “3 Thfsr^'sr * b ”' *° -«« ^-,b“ P «= The Ib^attS fr&lt;,m the ^ b3nk near Persia11 Sarakhs - A gang of 18 armed robbers robbed a caravan of Kainis at Bakbakm rpi Th ^ Shur ^ ak roa 1 d . 18 01086(1 by robbers and caravans are stopped at Mazduran The road guards on this road and at Bakbaku on the Sarakhs road are useless See Diary No. 9.

He has married his daughter to Riza Khan, brother of the late Masu d Khan, and a candidate for the Governorship, and instigates Riza Khan against him. He also intrigues against the Governor, Mansm-ul-Mulk himself. The Russian Agent stands to win either way, for his son-in-law may either gam his end and become Governor, or he may be killed or imprisoned, in w ich case the landed property which he has made over to his wife will fall virtually mto the possession of her father, the agent. ^ T. W. HAIG, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorasan.( CONFIDENTIAL. I9i6 ^ Meshed Diary No. 11 for the week ending March 11th, 1916. Vmian Officials Astija-u 1 -M ulk has been appointed Governor of Persian Sarakhs. Shaukat-ul-Mulk, ^-Governor of Sistan and Kain, is still at the latter place, as he fears that he and his party will be searched and perhaps disarmed by the Russians. He is arranging matters by telegram with M. Samsonoff and, through him, with the Russian Consul-General, whom I have advised to make matters easy for Shaukat-ul-Mulk so that he may get through without delay. See Diary No. 10 . Najat, Mirza Ali Mujallal-ut-Tauliya and Mirza Ghulam j Riza Khan, an assistant in the Karguzari, are trying to persuade the new Karguzar to interest himself in the matter of bringing escaped prisoners of war into Persia, as his predecessor did, representing the business as being very profitable, but Mumtahan-us-Saltanah does not like the idea and, although his advisers are trying to convince him that it is quite easy to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds, he has replied that it is not so simple, a matter now that the Russians have taken to deporting intriguers to Russia. 4 Persian Affairs. —See Diary No. 10 . The Governor-General and the Mutawalli Bashi have received orders from Tehran to deport Shuja-ut-Tauliya and his two brothers to Tehran. The Governor-General was inclined to object but the Mutawalli Bashi and my Colleague are urging him to carry out the orders. It is reported from Maiamai that the murderers of the late Amir-i-Azam have appeared in the neighbourhood of Damaghan, and that the present Amir-i-Azam has sent sowars to arrest them. Russian Affairs. —The Persian authorities are trying to use me as a cat’s-paw in the matter of issue of Russian permits for the carrying of arms by Persian subjects. A remittance for the Imperial Bank of Persia has been lying for some time in the Post Office at Turbat-i-Haidari and the officials refused to despatch it to Meshed on the ground that the escort might be disarmed by the Russians. I have obtained from Colonel Gushchin an assurance that the escort will not be interfered with but the Persian authorities now say that they will not despatch the money until the whole question of permits for arms has been settled. I am insisting on the despatch of the remittance and refusing to interfere in the general question. Persian and German Intrigues.—The, Ilhaigi of the Kaudani Taimuris, Mir Baki Sultan, the Post Master of Gunabad, who is brother-in-law to Abdullah Mirza of the police, and five other persons arrested in the Turbat and Tabas districts, have been deported to Russia. It is reported that Abdullah Mirza himself has fled from Sabzavar, but the report lacks confirmation. The arrest of the Ilhaigi and Mir Baki Sultan caused great rejoicings in Turbat-i-Shaikh-i-Jam. A circular letter has been addressed by the Meshed Central Committee of National Defence to all branch committees, directing each to send two members to a secret meeting, to be held in a place to be determined later, to hear the orders of the General Central Committee. It is explained that it is not safe to hold a general meeting of all branches. „ It is reported that the Commissaries of Police in the Bala and Pain Khiyabans have purchased considerable numbers of rifles and stored them in their houses. Both men are democrats. News from Turbat-i-Haidari.—Among those arrested by the Russians is Mu’id-ul-Vizarah, Karguzar of Bushruya, Tun and Tabas. Hisam-ud-Daulah telegraphed from Turbat to Shaukat-ul-Mulk urging him to return to Birjand in order that a reconciliation might be arranged. News from Kariz. —It is reported that Nurullah Khan Makui and the brother of the Ilhaigi of the Kaudani Taimuris attempted to raise the former’s tribe to J 2042 Hecsived on £3 IviA / «b 1 ii * 1 INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter. No. ' M Dated OQ APB CJiS -attempt tlie rescue of the Ilbaigi, but the tribe refused to rise. Nurullah Khau is suspected of having entered into some agreement with Paschen when the former was in Kuhsan and Paschen is said to have attempted to collect men to rescue the Ilbaiqi, but to have been restrained by the Governor of Kuhsan. Nurullah Khan has moved, with his family and servants, into Afghan territory, saying that he is no longer a Persian but an Afghan subject. News from Herat. —An arrival from Kabul states that temporary shops have been erected near the Bagh-i-Babar for the use of the German party and that the Amir has issued a notice prohibiting people from speaking of the leaders of the party as official representatives of any government. The Germans are said to be telling the sepoys that their pay will shortly be largely increased and that they will soon be led to India. Ismail, Paschen’s interpreter, is engaged in spreading absurd rumours in the bazar to the effect that 60,000 picked German troops have reached Sabzavar in Persia and will soon reach Herat, that the Amir has placed his troops in Kabul under the command of Niedermayer and is about to place those in Herat under the command of Paschen, etc., etc. The British Agent hears that Ismail has been trying to arrange with one Ah Akbar, a tailor, to poison him. The Naib-us-Saltanah has sent orders to the Governor to receive courteously any other German and Ottoman Turks who may cross the frontier, and the Gov ernor has sent an officer to Anardarra to receive any who may come by that route. A rumour is current in Herat, having perhaps been started by the interpreter Ismail, to the effect that the British troops have been defeated in Sistan and have fled to India. A notice addressed by the Amir to all classes of his people has been received in Herat and has been distributed to all Governors of districts. It calls upon the people of the province to elect representatives to meet at Herat, where a representa tive of the Amii^ will meet them and invite their views on the subject of the defence of the Kingdom, people and religion of Afghanistan. The Commander of the Troops is said to have warned the men on parade to be ready for a “ holy war.” This caused some excitement and some misapprehension as to the contents of the Amir’s notice, but the Governor quieted the people. Akhundzada, Governor of Maimana, who was said to be 120 years old, has died. Orders have been received from Kabul to the effect that Khassadar sepoys are to be drilled, lodged in barracks, and assimilated as much as possible to the regular troops. See Diary No. 10 . The strangers who came to Kafir KaTah have now arrived at Herat. They are five in number and say that they have received their education abroad. They are being sent under escort to Badakhshan, to which district they say they belong. Condition of Country. —The brother of the late Nusrat-ul-MullTis said to have informed the Governor-General that the Taimuris will probably migrate from Persia into Afghanistan, whither about 400 have already gone, unless a chief is soon officially recognised. A gang of twenty Afghans is still committing robberies on the Sarakhs road in the neighbourhood of Mazduran and Bakbaku, and the road guards are unable to disperse it. Seven Shikaris of Isgil have robbed and murdered one Shaban in his village in the Chinaran district. There appears, after all, to be some chance of a settlement of the dispute in the Darragaz district. One party has started for Meshed and the other is to follow, in order that the dispute may be settled here. T. W.

The Officer Commanding there is young and perhaps over-zealous, and the consular agent is useless. } ^ pernaps The escort of Hishmat-us-Sultan, son of the Governor of Daragaz who was coming to Meshed, has been disarmed by Russian Cossacks. g Early last year it was reported from Charjui that a survey for a railway to Khiva along the western bank of the Oxus had been undertaken. It is now reported that the work ot construction is about to be taken in hand. 1 An arrival from Baku reports a riot of the wives and families of soldiers due to the reduction of their allowances from 5 to 3 roubles a month, and adds that the not was suppressed and that the ringleaders, who were Armenians, were arrested. Riza Khan of Daragaz has foolishly seized 150 loads of cotton belonging to a Russian subject. ° &amp; Persian and German Intrigues—An agent reports from Kabul that the people there are discussing the questioned jihad and would be glad to see the Amir abandon his neutrality, which he does not appear to be inclined to do. The garrison at Kabul is said to consist at present of 12 battalions of infantry, 12 troops of cavalry, 4 batteries of field and 4 of mountain artillery, and 2 batteries of machine guns! There are also said to be two guns of German make. These are perhaps the mountain guns said by Lieutenant Winckelmann to have been taken into Afghanistan by Wagner, but the agent at Herat asserts positively that Wagner never passed through that town. It appears to be almost certain that Mirza Muhammad Ali Khan, formerly editor of the Bamdad-i-Raushan of Tehran, is in hiding somewhere in Meshed. His address even has been given but so far the Karguzar and the Chief of Police have failed to find him and a female detective sent by the latter to trace him is said to have been beaten by the man’s relatives. I hear that the Karguzar wishes to hand him over to the Russians. The Governor-General is informed that three other Persians who are agents for the Germans have come to Meshed from Tehran. The Russians have arrested at Tun, as German agents, Kavam-ul-Mamalik Mirza Ali Akbar, Superintendent of the Revenue Department, and Mirza Ali Agha, the Post Master, and will probably deport them to Russia. The Persian authorities are protesting against the arrest of Mirza Ali Akbar as being likely to disorganize the arrangements for collecting the revenue. Abdullah Mirza, who was transferred from Meshed to Sabzavar as Chief of Police (see Diary No. 7), has fled secretly from that town towards Tehran. The activity of the Russian troops probably alarmed him. See Diary No. 9. The local democrats are much disheartened by the transfer of Shahrukh Mirza and complain that all their most active workers among the officials are being transferred. According to a letter from an agent in Tun, dated February 26th, there were then no Germans, or sowars in their employ, on the roads between Nain, Tabas, and Tun. r.\f ■A i Received on ^ # „^arY’S foreign secretary s po.

A trader named Haji Amin is pressing him there for payment of a debt of 4,000 tomans. F ^ Sartip Muhammad Reza Khan, late Deputy Governor of Sistan, has foolishly decided not to go up to Birjand. He says that the will, which his half-brother professes to have custody of, gives him a very small share of the late Hisam-ud- Daulah’s property. He therefore prefers to await the swing of the pendulum and to see what his uncle Shaukat-ul-Mulk can do for him in Tehran. News from Afghanistan.—(a) Regarding the looting of the Afghans’ caravan referred to in last week’s diary, I hear that the raiders were 25 Rekis of Sardar Taj Muhammad. Sardar Ata Muhammad Khan Sinjerani of Chahar Burjak went after the band, but apparently failed to catch them up. The Governor of Chakhansur refused the reinforcement which he was asked for. It is said that out of 200 camels 100 were carried off, but only 10 loads. Two or three Afghans were wounded The affair apparently occurred within the Afghan border (at Bareh Reg).

Khabir-i-Khakan, the Provincial Telegraph Master, has received orders to transfer fenanrukli M.irza and. Saifullali Mirza, two democrats employed in ttie Central Telegraph Office, from Meshed to outstations. J Mirza Muhammad Khan, lately acting Karguzar, has left Meshed for Tehran The Karguzar tells me that he dismissed him but according to another account Mirza Muhammad Khan heard that the Russians intended to arrest and deport him in consequence of a letter written by him and found with the four Austrian fugitives who were arrested at Nishabur some time ago, and consequently fled from Meshed. y See Diary No. 7. On the transfer of Abdullah Mirza to Sabzavar Haii Muhammad Jafar, leader of the democrats in Meshed, wrote to a democrat in Sabzavar saying that he had secured the dismissal of the Chief of Police there who was a friend of the Russians and was causing to be sent there Abdullah Mirza who was a patriot. The recipient of this letter handed it to the Russian Agent in Sabzavar and it is reported that the Russians have arrested Abdullah Mirza. I have not yet been able to verify this report but if it is not true I shall hold the Governor-General to his promise to dismiss Abdullah Mirza. Saiyid Muhammad Sultan-ul-Ulama, Director of Public Instruction, has come to Meshed to open a new school, and is also inspecting existing Persian schools. Persian Affairs .— Circular orders have been sent to all district Governors by the Governor-General and to all district Karguzars by the Karguzar enjoining them to work in harmony at this critical time. So far as I can discover these orders are not directed against British or Russian interests but are designed to save the trouble caused by the constant friction between these officials. Secret .— At the instance of the Minister for War the Minister for Foreign Affairs has telegraphed to the Karguzar urging him to recover from the Russians the Government rifles seized by them (see Diaries Nos. 43 and 44 of 1915). The Karguzar has replied to the effect that he has no hope of success here and suggests that the case should be referred to the Russian Legation. The Governor-General has issued orders for the assembly of a force of Kelati, Bakharzi, and Taimuri sowars at Meshed. Russian Affairs. —My Colleague informs me that the proposed reinforcement of the Russian garrison in Khorasan and the appointment of General Fidaroff to command the whole force are postponed. My Colleague, at the instance of the Karguzar, has agreed to deport to Russia a gang of six mischievous Caucasian ruffians who have for some time past been giving much trouble in Meshed. Persian and German Intrigues .— The brother of Malik-ush-Shuara, lately editor of the Nau Bahar, has arrived at Meshed from Tehran and is trying to revive the courage of democrats, but without much success. The transfer of Abdullah Mirza has disheartened them and the transfer of the two disaffected telegraphists and the arrest of the Kaudani Ilbaigi and Mir Baki Sultan will probably discourage them still further. Some of these rogues have left Meshed and the others no longer hold regular meetings, as they say that it is dangerous to do so. INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter. No. M Dated 31 MAR 191 6G.

Even Ms own tribe are^eheved by his removal, and show no srgns of turbulence. A'eww from Turbat-i-Haidari.—The post which left Turbat-i- aidan on February 3 has been lost, it is not yet known how. I did an injustice to M. Samsonoff in Diary No. 8 . The aeroplane was not seen by him but by the Governor, the Karguzar and five other Persians who had been dining out. The Karguzar was sober enough to maintain that it was a stcir • • • • A mujtahid from Tun who was detained by the Russians in Turbat-i-Haidari has since been permitted by them to proceed to Meshed. It is as well for Abdullah Mirza that his destination was changed from Turbat- i-Haidari to Sabzavar, for the Russians were prepared to arrest him on the XOcicl News from Rrm.-The Kaudani Ilbaigi and Mir Baki Sultan have been sent to Turbat-i-Haidari. One of the former’s servants has given valuable information of hfe master’s intrigues with the Germans and has been employed by the Russians. A force of sowars sent by the Governor-General has been sent to Turbat-i- Shaikh-i-Jam to recover from the estates of the Ilbaig, and Mir Baki Sultan stolen property or compensation for it. Most of the property for which claims have been presented belonged to British subjects , , v. T News from Herat.-See Diary No. 52 of 1915 The Commander of the Troops has now been ordered to submit a revised list of old officers distinguishing those who are fit for civil employment from those who are unfit for any lurther service whatever The latter are to receive pensions of one-third of their pay. Paschen, before leaving Herat, is said to have complained to the Governor that all their most private conversations were somehow reported to Meshed. The Governor denied this. Ismail, Paschen’s interpreter has been complaining that all their movements are reported to Meshed by the British Agent. Paschen received a letter from Kabul, which seemed to give him much pleasure. When asked what it contained he said that he learnt from it that the Amir had promised to join Germany soon. Paschen returned to Herat on the evening of February 15, after staying three days at Kuhsan. He was apparently expecting the arrival of a German party, but returned when messengers whom he had sent to Kariz and Jamrud came back to him. ‘ It was reported on February 17 that Paschen had received a letter from the Kermanshahi who gave himself up at the Russian Consulate-General two months ago The man is reported to have said that the Pvussians seized him and flogged him but released him when they found that he would reveal nothing. He added that he would either go to Tehran or return to Herat. He is not likely to do the latter, as he is the man who gave up two messages from Niedermayer to Prince Henry of'Peuss which, when deciphered, proved to be interesting. A strange story is current in Herat to the effect that the foreigners are not what they appear to be but British and Russian officers disguised as Turks and Germans. A friend of the British Agent accused him of having misled him on this subiect and when the agent denied having done so and asked him on what grounds he based his suspicion replied that he had been present when the Governor read a farman from Amin-ud-Daulah directing him to inquire whether the men were really Turks and Germans or Russian and British officers in disguise.

(d) A report reached Awaz on the 14th February that 6 German prisoners of war had escaped into Afghanistan via Pul-i-Khatun. (e) On 17th instant, news reached Sistan that two Germans—one calling himself a Muhammadan—had arrived in Chakansur from Herat. They are escorted by 10 or 15 Afghan sowars. They spent one day with the Governor, Sherdil Khan, and the next with the Brigadier. It appears that these Germans' are provided with a fresh escort at every place they reach and that the handing over escort carefully take a receipt from the relieving one every time. The travellers are making notes and preaching jehad wherever they go. They are going on to Chehar Burjak, the residence of Sardar Ata Muhammad Khan. The Governing Family of Kainat. Shaukat-ul-Mulk professes to have received a cypher telegram from the Minister of the Interior permitting him to proceed to Tehran. It has been announced that Colonel Ali Naki Khan and the Artillery Commander Mirza Ali Akbar Khan will accompany him. I have sent messages to Shahzada Muhammad Taki Mirza and Basir-i-Nizam advising them to leave in the same company. Hisam-ud-Dauleh has requested the Karguzar of Sistan, Rukn-ul-Wizareh, to act as Deputy Governor for the present. He wishes the present Deputy Governor, Sartip Muhammad Reza Khan, his brother, to meet him in Birj and. Afghan robbers. It was reported from Bandan on 16th February that a caravan travelling from Labi Baring to Bandan had been attacked the previous night by Afghan robbers. The loads had been forwarded by Ghulam Muhammad Peshawari (British subject) for traders in Meshed. The robbers apparently did not want the loads and only carried off 15 camels. A small box of tea is said to be missing and the contents of a box of china-ware to have been smashed up. The caravan men are carrying bhe 15 loads up to Birjand by sending animals back from each stage for a second trip. Baluch raiders. {a) Eight Muhammadani Ismailzais left Shorn and Galugeh for Kainat on the 3rd February. They travelled round Gurg via Rod Mahi and Nakhilu.

It was reported that 75 more sowars were following. Our cavalry (two troops) at Birjand went out on 24th to attack the enemy, as did some infantry on 25th. On 26th a Khuri came into Birjand and stated that the German sowars —only 6 in number—had returned towards Naiband from Chah Tuni. (e) See last week’s diary.

On the 21 st instant, notices were put up in Sistan city announcing the change of Governorship. Sardar Khudadad Khan sent presents of horses to the Karguzar and the Persian Telegraph Master in acknowledgment of the good news. The people of Birjand'have also taken the news quietly, though most of the ieadmg mullas and traders went in a body to Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s residence, on the 18th instant, to inform him of their sorrow.

Persian Officials. —Mumtahan-us-Saltanah, the new Kareu 7 ar amVorl February 13, and had a very poor reception. Apparently nobody from’ the Russian Consulate-General went to meet him. I sent the Indian Attach with four ™ a ot the escort. He called on me on Februarv 17 TTo 1 iLur Meshed by Najat, the agent of Shaukat-ul-Mulk * accompanied to Hisam-ud-Daulah, the newly appointed Governor of Sistan and Kain is still here, but he should have received orders to start by now. There are rumours that Ins appointment is likely to cause disturbances, but these are perhaps circulated mthe interest of ShaukatmbMulk. Both the Karguzarand Najat^havetelegraphed to Shaukat-ul-Mulk advismg him to obey the orders wkich he has received and &gt; stait for Meshed at once. Shaukat-ul-Mulk has promised to follow their advice, but my Colleague tells me that he hears that “he has received permission to stay three weeks longer m Birjand to settle up his affairs. ^ Mirza Muhammad Khan, ^tely acting Karguzar, still retains the seal of the Karguzari and is apparently unwilling to render an account of his stewardship to Murritahan-us-Saltanah. He has complained to Tehran that about 300 trnnans spent on the despatch of Austrian refugees to Tehran have not been repaid to the Karguzan. Of this sum 116 tumans were spent on four men who were arrested and brought back from Nishabur. Colonel Gushchin reports from Turbat-i-Haidari that he has seized some correspondence implicating the present chief of police as a German agent, but both my Colleague and I think that there must be some mistake. The man has been very useful to me in minor matters and has assisted my Colleague by giving him news of the movements of escaped prisoners of war. Shaji-us-Saltanah, the youngest brother of Shaukat-ud-Daulah, has arrived in Meshed from Tehran and the Governor-General has promised to recognise him as chief of the Taimuris of Turbat-i-Shaikh-i-Jam if he will pay him 3,000 tumans. Persian affairs.—^ Diary No. 49 of 1915. The head of Chiragh Ali was not among those exhibited over the police station. He was taken alive, and the police have recently disposed of him in a characteristic fashion. He was informed that he was^ to be released and his door was left open, but as he was leaving the police station he was shot as a prisoner attempting to escape. Three other men who were recaptured have now been released after the amputation of their fingers. . Pussian affairs .—The Russian troops in Khorasan are to be reinforced by a regiment of Orenburg Cossacks and some field guns, and General Fidaroff will take command. ^ This is good news, for General Fidaroff is an excellent officer who knows Persia and the Persians and is not affected by alarmist rumours. In this he is unlike Colonel Gushchin, at present in command, who is, however, in all other respects a very good officer. My Colleague tells me that he thinks that more active measures are in contemplation in Khorasan and he has asked me to have proposals ready for General Fidaroff which, I have told him, I shall be very glad to do. About 900 Turkoman troops have been sent from Merv to Tashkent for garrison duty. There are now in Merv about 3,000 recruits under training whose destination is said to be the Kushk frontier. A rumour is current, to which I give no'credence, to the effect that 6,000 Afghans have crossed the Russian frontier at Pistazar and have not been molested. I attended the Russian Church on February 18 for a Te Z)ewm sung to cele brate the fall of Erzerum. The news of this success should have a good effect in Meshed and also in Herat, where I am taking care that it shall be known. For Herat I am making the addition that the defeat of the Turks was due to the failure of the Germans to assist them, and I am also calling attention to the fact that the 25,000 troops promised by Paschen (see Diary No. 6 ) have not yet arrived in Persia, , O'Q jiveu on i u ita APR 1 , KD IA POBSIOU f-CRETARY’S tlo.n 2 4 p»r a i n n from Kermanshah who had accompanied the G e ™ ian P arfc y lnto AfghMiistan™^^^that'he surrendered himself'at^th^Emssianf'Consulate-General tions so alarmed him that he surrendeI *?, n Y“ S r, ppn „ iven to h i m by the party in iirLZS°^£SL /-» 4-; returned.

It is reported that Najat, the agent of Shaukat-ul-Mulk, has come to Meshed on some secret service. The democrats are not now holding their meetings either at Meshed or at Nishabur. The reason given for their discontinuance is the inclemency of the weather. Somebody has again been seeing aeroplanes at Turbat-i-Haidari. I suspect that it is M. Samsonoff. Four Turkish mullas, two disguised as Afghans and two as Persians, are said to have been at Meshed lately. They had been preaching on the Afghan •frontier The two disguised as Afghans are believed to have left tor lehran by post, carriage, their tfcket laving been arranged for by the brother of Najat, mentioned above. News from Turlat-i-Haidari.—The Russian officers in Tur y at d‘ Hald ^ h p p f recently arrested some Persians suspected of corresponding with t] ie enemy and seized their papers. Colonel Gushchin has written to me to say that Wo ^n in whom he believes that I have an interest are implicated and asks whether I should object to their being arrested. I have telegraphed to him to say that 1 will object to the arrest of nobody reasonably suspected of C 0 ™ s P?“ d * n g, V,™ the enemy. The correspondence is being sent to M. Nicolsky, who will doubtless show it to me. The Russian troops still find great difficulty in obtaining grain at reasonable rates. News from Kariz.—On February 9 the Russian agent, accompanied by the British agent and assisted by a Russian officer and some Cossacks, arrested in Turbat-i-Shaikh-i-Jam the Ilbaigi of the Kaudani Taimuns, and Mir Baki buitan. The latter ofiered no resistance, but the.former’s men opened fire on tiie LossacK . No Cossack was injured, but three of the Ilbaigi’s men were killed. The P rlso » e ^ were sent into Kariz. Fourteen rifles ad eight horses were captured. [Rumours were circulated in Meshed to the effect that the Taimuris had risen to avenge the capture of the Ilbaigi and were attacking the Russians, but these proved to be false. As a precautionary measure, however, 43 Cossacks were sent from Meshed to luroa - i-Shaikh-i-Jam. The British agent subsequently accompanied the Russian agen to the Ilbaigi’s fort, but it was found that he had sent most of his movable property into Afghanistan. What was left was taken by the Cossacks and some B erSia “ Sowars. At the request of the Russian agent I have advised the Russian Consu - General to deport the men to Russia. Shuja-ul-Mulk, who was to have been appointed Governor of Turbat-i-Shaikh- i-Jam, has apparently become suspicious and will not come to Meshed.

Neither my Colleague nor I have much faith in the accuracy of this report, but to be on the safe side M.

I hear that a Tabrizi Turk is acting as the courier of the Germans between Herat and Meshed, travelling by Pul-i-Khatun, and I am asking the Russian agent at Kariz to have a lookout kept for him. An arrival from Kabul states that there is much disorder in Afghanistan and that the people are perplexed by rumours that Sardar Nasrullah Khan, who poses as the leader of the rigidly orthodox party, has taken to drink. The democrats in Meshed are walking very circumspectly. Their branch committees now meet fortnightly instead of weekly. They comfort themselves with concocted stories of German success and the progress of their cause in Western Persia, and still speak of the early arrival of large supplies of arms and ammunition. They mention the Nauruz (March 21) as the time when it will be advisable for them to rise, and when that festival comes round will probably fix another date. They also speak of the advisability of the secret drilling of mujahidin, but I cannot discover that they drill at all. r Beoeived on 13 APR ! 216 with 1RD1A F0REIG t r OftiiTARY S No. 22 M 17 MAR 1916 Letter.

The Governor has again visited Paschen and his party, and has made Paschen a present of a horse costing 80 tumans. He is said to have given the eleven Austrian referred to in Diary No. 5, permission to return to Russian territory in order that they may assist more prisoners to escape and bring them to Afghanistan, but I cannot believe that these men will venture to return to Russia urdess they have found that they are not so well ofl in Afghanistan as they were m Russia. The Naib Salar is said to have received from Kabul a private letter w-arning him that he will be called upon, after the Nauruz, to raise a new battalion of infantry.

Persmn officials.—Vn&amp;er instructions from His Majesty’s Minister I sent for Hisam-rid-Daulah on January 25 and warned him to be ready to leave Meshed to replace Shaukat-ul-Mulk m the Government of Sistan and Kam. I told him how Shaukat-ul-Mulk had disappointed us and warned him that we should expect assistance and the closest co-operation from him. I have asked my colleague to give him a similar warning. J ® M. Nicolsky is much displeased with the Governor-General, whom he accuses oi having permitted the escape of two Ottoman Turks and a Persian Turk who were being sent from Sabzawar to Tehran. Naiyir-ud-Daulak says that the men escaped from Shahrud, and that the Governor of that district is responsible. Persian and German Intrigues. —Two consignments of rifles, one of 12 and one of 16, have recently been received in Meshed by post from Tehran. They were addressed to an official in the Finance Department, but were intended for the democrats. See Diary No. 3. Ahmad Agha was brought in to Meshed on the evening of January 23, and was sent off to Russia the next morning. Some differences recently arose between the old central committee of the democrats in Meshed and the newly formed committee of national defence, but deputations from the two committees met and settled them. The ruffians, employed for the purposes of intimidation, have been ordered to do nothing for the present and though they complain of the committee’s lack of spirit they are secretly relieved. Two Caucasians have recently applied for permission to join the committee of defence, saying that they belong to a similar society in their own country, but as they are Russian subjects they have not been admitted. A deputation of democrats recently visited the Aghazada and induced him to take an oath that he would be loyal to the country. The democrats have lately received letters from Tehran encouraging them to hope for an improvement in the situation from their point of view and there is a rumour in circulation to the effect that the Kaiser has placed a credit of five millions sterling at the disposal of the central committee of national defence. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —The Governor of Turbat-i-Haidari made an unsuccessful attempt to persuade M. Samsonoff to obtain the release of Ahmad Agha. M. Mikhailoff, the Russian Consul, who is accused of having received a bribe on behalf of Ahmad Agha, has caused it to be widely known that the man was arrested at my instance. This of course does not affect me, but I hope that the source of my information will not be guessed. It is rumoured in Turbat that there are Germans at Tabas, but I am informed from other sources that this is not the case. News from Kariz. —The attitude of Mir Baki Sultan, Deputy Governor of Turbat-i-Shaikh-i-Jam, is most hostile towards the Russian and British agents, and Colonel Popoff complains that he can obtain no help from M. Mikhailoff, the Russian Consul at Turbat-i-Haidari. He is very anxious that I should visit Kariz, as he suspects the attitude of the local Afghans, but I am writing to tell him that it is impossible for me to leave Meshed at present. The Ilbaigi of the Kaudani Taimuris has exported about 400 kharwars of grain to Afghanistan in spite of the prohibition against exportation. M. Kornelis, Director of Customs, is taking steps to prevent further exportation. News from Herat.—Cases of theft and house-breaking by gangs of thieves 40 or 50 in number are very common in Herat at present. RBIA FOREIGH SECRETARY’S V \ ter.

The Governor apparently believes Paschen’s tales of the imminent arrival of a force of 25,000 men in Afghanistan but as Paschen has now foolishly committed himself to a date (February 19th) it may be hoped that he will soon be undeceived. The Governor has given Paschen permission to hold some horse races.

It has become i apparent to me that he would never have associated himself actively in measures against the Germans in any circumstances other than a declaration of war by Persia against Turkey. It remains to be seen whether Hisam-ud-Dauleh will ’ loyally support us. We are giving him every chance by insisting on the exile of his uncle Shaukat-ul-Mulk from the Province during the period of the war. (h) Hisam-ud-Dauleh’s Agent in Sistan, Haider Ali Khan, is still behaving unsatisfactorily. He has to supply us with 100 Kharwars of grain (out of 2,000 which he is known to have possessed a few weeks ago) and he is the only Kadkhuda to protest that he cannot help us with local transport for which we are ready to pay. The Imperial Bank of Persia. The Bank Manager in Birjand has informed the Consulate of his claims against— (1) Shaukat-ul-Mulk for 37,000 Krans; and (2) Misbeh-i-Diwan, the Governor’s Mustaufi, for 70,000 Krans. Both debtors are notoriously short of ready money. It seems to me that the most convenient way of recovering the claims will be for us to take over the debtors’ crops at a fair valuation for the troops. The Hazara Levy Corps. Captain Thorbwrn has reported a little trouble with his men. They have refused to come further south than Neh, it having been proposed to send half of them to Dehaneh Baghi. They say that they expected to be used as “ Levies ” not as regular soldiers, and they complain that they have constantly been required when stationed with regulars, to perform more than their share of fatigue duties. They also allege that they were told in Meshed that they would not be sent further south than Birjand, which can hardly be true. They pretend to be afraid of being sent to India. Captain Thorburn is returning the most discontented men to Meshed. It is expected that the trouble will soon be dissipated. uaseived on -4 fu’o s o i 'J wii '- a u-jIA FOREIGN SEGRETAFiY’3 j K0 . m * ! - 1 o M A P 1 o 1 C o UinFi *'■ 1The Chief Mujtehid of Sistan. ia: »\b» ij* ''rh'i 1 s Reza^wlio 6 is in Sistan, and Mullah Muhammad Husain, who has resided for some years in Tehran.

One Ghulam Shah, a servant of the late Nnsrat-ul-Mulk, saw two Taimuri sowars coming to Meshed with a led horse. The men were arrested and taken before the Governor-General who found that the men had been sent by the Ilbaigi of the Kaudani Taimuris to assist Shaukat-ud-Daulah to escape. Shankat-ud-Daulah has now been put in irons. Russian affairs .—I hear that a reinforcement of 70 Cossacks, with a large supply of ammunition, has been sent to Bujnurd. A party of 12 men of the 3rd Semirechia Cossacks has come into Meshed from Khaf to convey ammunition to the Cossack post in Khaf. The Governor-General is arranging for supplies of grain for the Russian troops in Khorasan. The Minister of the Interior has asked him to help in obtaining grain for our troops in Sistan, but the Governor-General naturally disclaims all responsibility for that province, which is no longer under his jurisdiction. He says that there is ample grain in Sistan for J our troops, and that if they cannot get it the fault is Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s. I I hear that Austrian prisoners are now employed, in gangs of 50, on the Trans- Caspian. Railway ; that they are better guarded than formerly and that part of the wages due to them is withheld in order to discourage them from attempting to escape. German and Persian Intrigues.—See Diary No. 3. Ahmad Agha has been brought into Meshed and is, I hear, to be sent to Russia. The Russians have evidently let it be known that the man was arrested at my instance, for |his brother and his father-in-law have been beseeching me to intervene in order that the man may not be sent to Russia. I have declified to assist them. See Diary No. 3. The 13 branch committees of the democrats in Meshed are under the control of a central committee of defence consisting of 25 members. When the ruffians engaged for the purposes of intimidation were ordered to swear fidelity on the Kuran before one of the branch committees they demurred and said that they preferred to swear before the Central Committee. This does not suit the members of the Central Committee, who prefer to conceal the composition of that committee, specially as some of the ruffians engaged are believed to be Russian subjects. An order has been received from “ the Central Committee of National Defence ” at Meshed urging these ruffians not to hesitate to swear before a branch committee. I have not yet heard the' decision of the ruffians. Last week 12 rifles arrived from Tehran by post to the address of an officer of the Finance Department. It is said that the democrats intend to import 300 rifles in this way. It is also reported that they expect 10 or 15 Turkish and Persian gun-smiths in Meshed. News from Karez. —The attitude of the Ilbaigi of the Kaudani Taimuris and Mir Baki Sultan towards the Russians and British is most hostile, and they have posted up notices warning people against buying and drinking tea, which, they say, has been poisoned by the Russians. They are also collecting all available grain and exporting it to Afghanistan. The Governor of Herat has ordered the Deputy Governor of Kuhsan not to take grain from the Government granaries, and to supply to caravans only half the quantity of grain hitherto supplied. He has also summoned the Deputy Governor of Kuhsan to Herat as Paschen believes that he is privy to the disappearance of Asgharzada. The attitude of Mirza Hasan Khan, the customs official at Kariz, is most hostile to the British and the Russians. News from Herat .—Various rumours are current in Herat of favour shown by the Amir to the Germans in Kabul. On the other hand it is stated that the Turks IKD1A FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter. Nm 16 M Dated 25 FEB 1916tl of the party have been prohibited from attending the Jami Masjid and that a special Khatib has been appointed for them ; also that a Turkish drill instructor, who caused the troops under his instruction to receive the German party outside the town with a salute, has been dismissed. The military guards over the German party in Herat, which formerly paid no honours to Paschen, now present arms to him; it is not known by whose orders. See Diary No. 3. The fugitives who arrived at Bala Murghab are now reported to be Russian subjects, not Germans. Political Summary. Condition of Country. —Turkomans have committed a robbery at Chah-i- Gardan on the Tehran road. It is reported from Gurgan that 4,000 \amut Turkomans ha\e started on a raid and have already plundered several villages. The Governors of Kuchan and Bujnurd have been ordered to take active measures against the lurkomans. One Rahmat-ul-Lah, a well-known ruffian, has been hanged at Nishapur. T. W.

Their total number amounted to three or four LrropearL and about 20 Persians. Our 50 Cavalry atNeh at once went out, and our Infantry ’with Hazara Levies started some hours later. The news has been brought hi by om local scout at Deli Salm, who had been arrested by the Germans but had managed to escape. Our Cavalry entered Deh Salm the following morning and found that the enemy had taken to some low-peaked hills during the night and entrenched themselves m four sanc/ars. An attempt was made to besiegl them, but they got away during the night of 18th-19th. 5 y gM A Mlower of the Germans was caught during the day, who said that a larger force of 24° men with guns, was following from Khabis. Other reports had also been received that the Germans on their first arrival at Deh Salm collected all the water skins they could, and sent them back into the desert on their animals^ .Nothing has since been discovered about the whereabouts of this larger force. A Cavalry patrol was sent out in pursuit of the German party as far as Koh Surkh which is said to be 40 or 50 miles west-north-west of Deh Salm. Traces of the fugitives were found, but they could not be followed further. On the 20th instant after dark a German appeared at Deh Salm and surren dered to a Sikh sentry. He had sore feet and his boots were strung round his neck. He said that he had failed to keep up with his companions and had been without food or drink for four days. He gave his name as Lieutenant Winckelmann Prussian Guards Field Artillery, and said that his companions had been Consul Seiler and Lieutenant Waldmann. Subsequently he pointed out the place where he had hidden his rifle, camel-saddle, maps and a few papers. The names of the Germans now in Afghanistan are given as Niedermayer, Paschen, Wagner, Hentig, Bheur, and Vagt. Ten Austrians are also with them. As regards our reinforcing parties which went out from Sistan, Major Claridge with Cavalry arrives, I believe, in Neh to-day (22nd January). Colonel Wikeley is at Bandan with the main force. The Governor of Kainat and Sistan. —Shaukat-ul-Mulk has received from Tehran, through the Persian Telegraph Office, a repitition of Farman Farma’s order about checking disturbances by Germans. On January 20th he also received a telegram asking why he had allowed British troops to go to Chahak (? Gulu Chahak) as reported by the Karguzar of Sistan to suppress trouble, as he should have done it himself. In justice to the Governor I may mention that time was valuable and neither the Vice-Consul at Birjand nor I thought of asking the Governor to co-operate with our troops. Moreover it seemed quite possible that another German force might be approaching Birjand from Yazd and Tabas. ' My news-reporter on the Afghan frontier writes that Shaukat-ul-Mulk has ordered his Deputy at Duroh to enlist 200 Bahluris at once for immediate service. The Deputy Governor showed the letter to my agent. The Deputy Governor of Awaz.- —See last week’s Diary.

Twenty more sowars are escorting his convoy of supplies. German Parties. (a) Nothing further has been heard of Seiler’s party, which fled back across the But last week. It appears from Winckelman’s statement that Seiler, and the two Lieutenants, came on in advance to reconnoitre the route via Deh Salm, and that the main body has been halting at Khabis awaiting instructions. As soon as any appreciable quantity of rain has fallen there is a possibility of the whole party advancing again. ^ (b) His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Birjand has heard, both from his scout at Khusp and from local rumours, that a force of 400 men has arrived in Tabas. These people, called by some reporters “ Hassanis,” are assumed to be m German employ. Presumably they include the Shirazi, Lur and Bakhtiyari sowars mentioned in Meshed Diary No. 2 of 1916. (c) A camel-man of Fidishk, who left Yezd with loads for Birjand early in December, states that the Germans at that time had 200 sowars, 200 mules and 100 camels in Yezd. The camel-man halted nearly a month at Bawat on account of fear of the Hassanis. The Governing Family of Kainat. (a) Shaukat-ul-Mulk, on 24th January, repeated to his nephew and Deputy in Sistan the telegram from Farman Farma of 13th January on the subject of sup pressing German parties, and assisting in the collection of supplies for our troops. I had previously given a copy of the telegram direct to Sartip Muhammad Beza Khan, and he has been supporting the Karguzar and Bevenue Director quite satis factorily from the commencement of our operations. The telegram has been read out to all the Kadkhudas assembled in the Karguzari. (b) Hisam-ud-Dauleh is said to have married a wealthy lady in Tehran, and to have married or to be on the point of marrying another more wealthy lady, the daughter of Shahzada Muhammad Mirza and niece of the Governor-General of Khorasan, in Meshed. (c) The calumny (?) that Hisam-ud-Dauleh is a partisan of the Germans dies hard in this Province. My news-reporter at Awaz writes: “ Ali Akbar Beg of Takhtiban (of ill repute, see Diary No. 36 of 1915) is collecting grain at Kakh and Nim Buluk for Hisam-ud-Dauleh who, I hear, is a friend of the Germans.” I imagine that Hisam-ud-Dauleh is still ready to sell his support to the other side if he does not become bound to us for favours conferred.

Persiav, ajam.-The democrats of Meshed have been reorganising their committees. There are thirteen committees in the town, each consisting of 12 members, and a small gang of ruffians has been organised whose duty it is to intimidate the public. - There is some talk of lots being drawn among the ruffians to decide who is to open a campaign of assassination, of which the first victim is to be the mujtahid, Aghazada, but it is not likely that this matter will go beyond talk The democrats are much depressed by the news from Hamadan, Kum and Rabat- i-Karim, which has apparently been communicated to them by the “ Central Committee of National Defence, ” and has been received in their meetings with wailing and lamentation. 6 Shaukat-ud-Daulah is still a prisoner in the arg. It is reported that his wife the sister of the deceased Nusrat-ul-Mulk, went to visit him the other day but was not admitted as it was found that she had a revolver with her and it was suspected that she intended to kill her husband. Mirza Ibrahim Khan, brother of the deceased, has taken steps to prosecute Shaukat-ud-Daulah. Russian affairs. —An arrival from Merv reports that considerable numbers of Turkoman irregular horse (jigits) are being raised for garrison and frontier duty in Russian Turkistan and also that recruitment for the regular army continues. Persian and German Intrigues. —The Asr-i-Jadid of Tehran reports that a German caravan of 100 mules laden with specie, munitions, and arms, including two or thr3e machine guns, under the command of Seiler, formerly German Consul at Isfahan and now “ Chief of the Persian Expedition ” was attacked by robbers near Main as it was making for Tabas, en route to Afghanistan, and that all the loads were carried off by the robbers. A Turkish prisoner who had escaped from Russia, a boy of about 18, was discovered in Meshed in the service of Mirza Ibrahim Khan of the Finance Department. He has been arrested by the Russians and will be sent back to Russia. M. Nicolsky also informs me that two Turkish fugitives have been arrested by his agent at Sabzavar. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —I hear that the Russians intend to send to Russia Ahmad Agha, commandant (on leave) of the gendarmerie at Tun, who was arrested by them, on information supplied by me, as a German agent. I hear also that the Persian authorities are anxious to know why the man has been arrested. According to a letter received from Tabas, Dr. Becker, one of the German agents, has been wounded by Shirazi robbers at Pusht-i-Badam. See Diary No. 2. The situation has been relieved for the present by the sale of 200 kharwars of wheat from the Government granaries. Fifty Cossacks have left Turbat for Rushkhar to search for barley. News from Kariz. —The Russians are thinking of arresting the Kaudani Ilbaigi and Mir Baki Sultan, but the question is apparently not yet quite decided. There can be little doubt that these men have been harbouring German messengers and recently one Hap Majid Shirvani has complained to my colleague that the Ilbaigi has plundered 50 kharwars of his grain. The Ilbaigi has also sealed considerable stores of wheat and barley belonging to the inhabitants of Turbat-i- Shaik-i-Jam, on the ground that the grain is required by the Kaudani Taimuris. Shaukat-ud-Daulah’s men are also likely to be in trouble, as the Customs Department has ordered the confiscation of an estate of his worth 17,000 tumans, as a fine for having smuggled arms.

The Jamadar who conducted Niedermayer’s party to Kabul has returned to Herat^ 6 It seems that one German died before the party reached Kabu , and that his body waTcarried into Kabul and buried there. The Jamadar reports that the Amir used to send for one of the Germans every “^^.^“Erfeh taking the numbers of the party m turn.

The sowars who escorted the party to Kabul were much disappointed w ren ey ascertained that the Germans had no intention o ippmg e * The Governor of Bala Marghab is said to have reported the arrival there of 10 German fugitives, and to have received orders to send them to Herat. The servants of Paschen’s party are now permitted to walk about freely, without guards. The Commander of the Troops is renewing locally the belts, pouches and bayonet scabbards of the troops. The Governor is having the old bridges over the town ditch destroyed and is replacing them by stronger bridges. Paschen is said to have told the Governor that he could bring ten or fifteen thousand troops to Herat, but that his plans must be kept from the British Agent, lest he should take steps to have the troops opposed on their way. Condition of country .—Muhammad Hassan Khan, Kajar, Governor of Sar Yilayat, shot a man dead with a mauser pistol last Ramazan. The people attacked him and he was compelled to flee to Meshed. The Governor-General recently sent him back to Sar Vilayat with a force of 30 sowars and one gun and he shelled the tower in which Haji Ghulam Husain, next-of-kin of the murdered man, and the other rioters had taken refuge. The rioters surrendered and they have been brought to Nishabur. Their property has been confiscated. T. W.

Jamadar Sharbat Ali Khan of the Consulate General, Meshed, left at the same time. German Agents.—{a) On the 6th January a report reached Neh from Shusp that two Germans of fair complexion and blue eyes had been seen at Tark. Captain Thorburn has made great efforts to verify the news, but has come to the conclusion that it originated out of a visit of a small Indian cavalry patrol from Neh. nii. (b) From Nasratabad Sipeh I hear that a German styling himself Vice-Consul has visited Bam. He is offering 23 tomans per mensem to sowars and jambazes (camel riders) and 12 tomans to foot-soldiers. A large number of Narmashiris are taking service under him. Some of the inhabitants of Fahreh have also gone to Bam. Nasrat-ul-Mulk is helping the German, whose chief recruiting officer is named Naib Ibrahim. Nasrat-ul-Mulk has had a conversation on the telephone with Ali Shah Khan of Nasratabad Sipeh. The latter apparently intends to remain loyal to us. (c) I have seen the small letter written in German which has been recovered from Mustafa (see last week’s Diary). A good deal of it has become illegible through damp or grease, but the following has been decyphered here. “ * * * * immediate connection with Tehran owing to * * * by Russians and Englishmen. Gendarmerie must come. Through here for the present no help.

His Excellency expresses satisfaction at receiving these orders, but apparently intends to ask for a confirmation of the order through the Persian Telegraph Office. The fodder crisis in Sistan.—Om operations during the week have progressed satisfactorily. The military parties sent to certain villages of Sardar Purdil Khan and Haider Ali Khan have unearthed considerable stocks _ of barley and wheat. With the concurrence of the Karguzar all the barley found in kurhs (under ground granaries) belonging to these two men has been brought into the camp, it being notorious that there must be sufficient stocks for the owners personal needs in their other villages. The Karguzar has also sent out mamurs, representing the Deputy Governor, the Revenue Department and himself, to as many other hadkhudas villages as possible, to note the situation of the kurks and prevent them being cleared out. A large number Karguzar’s summons, assessed. of kadkhudas have come into the town in response to the but a few are still awaited.

He is begging me to accept a contingent of his men for the Baluch Levy Corps (for whom I have now no vacancy) and also promising to sell ns voluntarily all the wheat that has been f found in his possession. I have replied that Ali Khan cannot be discharged at present, as his good offices and knowledge are necessary for the settlement of terms with the other kadkhudas. Baluch Haiders.—I hear from Dehaneh Baghi that a band of 25 raiders, which passed Shorgaz on the 30th December going north and returned on the 3rd January after raiding Kishik near Khabis, was led by the son of Aka Shah Murad Kami of Bazman. Their booty consisted of 70 donkeys, 5 camels and 11 cows. On the 7th January another small band left Gerakab for Kainat. Afghan robbers.—On the 7th instant a flock of sheep was carried off from Gulwardeh into Afghanistan. On the 10th and 11th instant, robberies were committed on the high road between Lab-i-Baring and Bandan. The robbers appear to have been Afghans and about 40 in number. They deprived a Consulate mounted messenger of bis horse and a letter (the latter was recovered three days later) and looted four Bahlnris of seven camels laden with grain on the first night. On the second, they carried off some women from another caravan travelling northwards. The Persian sowars sent out from Sistan failed to find the robbers, who, according to the latest information, are lurking at Anjira. The Deputy Governor of Ahwaz. —See Diary Ko. 1. Muhammad Yusuf Khan, who had fled into Afghanistan and returned, has been replaced in office by Ahmed Ali Beg, son of Haji Abdullah Beg. I have not heard whether Muhammad Yusuf Khan has again escaped across the border. The Indo-European Telegraph Department. —Some inconvenience is being experienced in regard to collecting of news from Bam and Fahreh owing to all the Telegraph ghulams of the 7th Sub-Section having deserted.

Persian Officials.^ I hear that the acting Karguzar has been reprimanded by the Minister for Foreign Affairs for irregularities in the Karguzari. This probably explains recent visit paid to my colleague and myself. F ^ Persian Nusrat-ul-Mulk, chief of one branch of the Taimuris has unfortunately been shot and killed by his cousin and brother-in-law, Shaukat-ud- Daulah, chief of the other branch of the tribe. On December 21st both of them went out to a garden outside the town, and got drunk. Shaukat-ud-Daulah drew a revolver and began firing it at a woman who was employed to amuse them and Nusrat-ul-Mulk seized his hand to prevent him from injuring the woman and received a shot m his stomach, the bullet passing out through his back He was brought back to the town and, in spite of all that could be done for him died shortly after midday on December 22nd. He made three formal statements before his death declaring that the affair was an accident, but the worst construction is placed upon it and Shaukat-ud-Daulah is under arrest in the Ark. The affair is most unfortunate, for Nusrat-ul-Mulk was a young man of great promise though he had fallen temporarily into bad habits. The Governor-General has’already received 3,000 Tomans from Shaukat-ud-Daulah. ^ There has been some trouble among the druggists of the town, one of whom was accused of smuggling morphine. His shop was searched and its contents confiscated and all druggists closed their shops in protest. They have since opened them on receiving an assurance from the Governor-General that a impartial inquiry would be L held. Aghazada and most of the mullas of Meshed have sent a telegram to the Central Government expressing their approval of its action in strengthening the bonds of friendship between Persia and her neighbours. I understand that the merchants are about to follow their example. The Karguzar has been unsuccessfully negotiating with my colleague for the return of rifles captured by the Russians from the Shirazi pilgrim-traders and Persian road guards. Russian Affairs .—On December the Name-Day of the Tsar, I attended the Russian Church in the morning. In the eve xing the British community was invited to a party at the Russian Consulate-General. The Governor-General did not call on my colleague during the day and has since excused himself on the ground of an attack of gout. An arrival from Termez reports that the new Karshi railway line has been open for traffic as far as Khilif. It is reported that 25 Cossacks under two officers have gone from Kuchan to Radkan and are confiscating arms. The Governor-General in reply to a complaint from the elders of the place, has advised them to offer resistance. An arrival from Merv reports that the strength of the garrison is 400 reservists with six machine guns. Bread is still scarce at Merv. M. Romanovsky, lately Russian Vice-Consul at Sistan, and Madame Romanovsky, arrived at Meshed on December 21st, and are staying with me until December 27th, when they will leave for Petrograd. British Affairs .—The Impeial Bank of Persia is much inconvenienced by the stoppage of telegraphic communication with Russia. I have addressed my colleague on the subject. Persian and German Intrigues .—It is said that the e^-brigand Muhammad Kursh-Abadi has offered his services to the rebellious democrats. Ten Austrian prisoners have been arrested by the Russians at Kuchan. iUisaived on 1 IvIAR 'ic'lv v— i INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter.

He also heard that Shah Sowar Khan, nephew of Jehind, had been marching on Kerman in the Germans’ interests, but that he had been repulsed by another force of Baluchis. (c). Another of our men reported on the 7th that 20 Bakhtiyaris had visited Khabis and searched for spies. The Germans were said to have sent four loaded carts from Kerman to Bam. The Kermanis, including the Governor-General are now on friendly terms with the Germans. The Germans intend to march towards Koh Malik Siah at Nauroz. The Governor of Sistan and Kain.—His Excellency informed Mr. New on 29th December that he had been ordered to send a person named Mirza Assadullah Khan up to Tehran. The only individual of this name of any note whom we know is the present temporary Deputy Governor of Kain city. This official, who is a brother of Misbeh-ud-Diwan, the Governor’s Deputy in Birjand and Land Agent is on the friendliest terms with the British Consulate. He was specially deputed by Shaukat-ui-Mulk to accompany Mr. New to Kain in August last (see Diary No. 33 of 1915) and so far as we know he has done vey good work there. He has -v/ continually corresponded with Mr. New direct, and we believed him to be on the / friendliest terms with M. Samsonoff. His trouble with M. de Bravine was men tioned in my Diary No. 50 of 1915. The Governor and Mr. New both presume that the Minister of the Interior cannot be wanting this official, and I understand that the Governor is telegraphing that he cannot trace the individual named. Hiasm-ud~Daulah. —Captain Thorburn at Neh has heard that a servant of j Hisam-ud-Daulah has recently visited Ismailabad (35 miles north of Neh) and has announced that his master favoured the Germans and that the villagers should not assist the British. My Indian Agent at Ahwaz has reported to Mr. New that one of his men has acquired possession of a German letter from Mustafa of Yazdan (see Diary No. 49 of 1915). This is being forwarded to Birjand, It is also said that Mustafa had been entrusted with a letter from the Germans in Herat to the mother of Hisam-ud-Daulah. Baluch Raiders. —It is said in Neh that 180 Baluchis are still at Garmab with 70 captives taken from the direction of Anarak. The fodder crisis in Sistan .—Our efforts of the last few weeks to buy grain j direct from Kadkhudas, owing to the failure of the Indian contractors and the Revenue Department to supply our needs, have come to nought.

The situation in Birjand. —The Governor has been telling Mr. New of the receipt by the local mullas of two telegrams:—- (1) from the Nationalists at Kum, falsely announcing a Persian victory over the Eussians; and J (2) from mullas and members of the Majlis in Tehran, asking for opinions on the Shah’s proposal to enter into alliance with Eussia and Great Britain against Turkey. The Governor says that he suppressed the first-mentioned telegram. Baluch Raiders. —See last week’s diary. News reached Birjand on 23rd December that 80 Baluchis were encamped at Kalata Agha Ali near Duhuk, and 200 others were near Naiband. t The Governor’s Commander of Jambazes, Sahib Jam, is at Sarchah Ambari with a small party for the protection of that locality. He has asked for reinforcements. The Baluch Levy Corps. —Sardar Khudadad Khan’s men have come in. Their leader is doing good work. I have also got hold of many of Sardar Purdil Khan’s Brahuis, though the Sardar actually threatened them and forbade them to take service. F. B.

The Governor of Tun sent out fighting men to drive^the Baluchis away. There are of course no Cossacks at Tun now. (2) The Baluchis have raided some flocks from Bushruyeh.

They had killed a Khuri shepherd and one of Sahib Jam’s scouts. It is reported from Koh Malik Siah that a band of Kamarzai Baluchis have returned home with many looted camels. This seems to be the party which killed the four camelmen in the Lut. The situation at Neh.—The Deputy-Governor and people have been boycotting our party of Hazaras ever since they came. Captain Thorburn has compelled the Deputy-Governor to submit an estimate of fodder supplies in the town. The Deputy-Governor, who is a Sistani, has been telegraphing to Biriand his desire to resign. He has informed Captain Thorburn that he has received no pay for three months. The situation in Sistan. —We are experiencing great difficulty in collecting supplies. The contracts entered into by the two Indian Firms are expiring, and the Seths profess not to hold more stocks of wheat and barley, though their Quetta agents tell a different story. We are trying to purchase grain direct from the Agent of Hisam-ud-Dauleh, Haider Ali Khan, Sirdar Purdil Khan, Kadkhuda Fakir Khan and the Mullas who are reputed to hold the largest stocks, but up to date all are denying that they have more than their requirements for seed (rather late in the season!) and for home consumption. The townspeople of Sistan and the labouring classes are in difficulties about grain, as none is to be bought in the bazaar. News from Awaz. —There is a great scarcity of grain on both sides of the border. Afghan robbers are very active. In Meshed Diary No. 51 of 1915 an incorrect story about Muhammad Yusuf Khan, late Deputy-Governor of Awaz, has been given. The following, which has been reported to me at intervals commencing from 25th October, seems to be more correct. Haji Abdullah Beg, Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s emissary to Herat, discovered when there that Muhammad Yusuf Khan had been selling women across the border.

Officials. —Salar-i-Ashiaf, Commander of the Troops, has been dismissed and Salar-i-Muzaffar, whose daughter is the wife of Fath-ul-Saltanah grandson of Nayyir-ud-Daulah, has been appointed in his place. Salar-i-Ashraf called on me and told me that his orders were to travel by post to Tehran, where he would receive further instructions, and added that he knew that this meant dismissal. Fath-us-Saltanah, Governor of Nishapur, has come to Meshed to see his grandfather and has called on me. The Governor-General refuses to recognize Hisam-ud-Daulah as Governor of Khaf and Gunabad. See Diary 49. The Chief of Police has received the rank of Amir-i-Tuman for his recapture of the escaped prisonejs. On December 5th the Governor-General had a telegraphic conversation with the Minister of the Interior. He Complained of the lawlessness of the Chief of Bujnurd, whom he holds responsible for robberies in the Sabzawar district, he insisted on the necessity for sending a capable Karguzar to Meshed at once ; he proposed, in view of the scarcity of grain, that officials of the Finance Department should be authorized to issue government grain to the Russian troops, he complained that the road police had all deserted for want of pay and proposed that he should be permitted to employ the revenue gendarmerie for policing the roads ; and he complained once more o.f the separation of various districts from the province of Khorassan and of the appointment of candidates direct from Tehran to posts in the province. I presume that his complaints were sympathetically received, for he has decided to remain. Persian Affairs. —The Chief of Police has republished the notice of the Customs Department prohibiting the carriage of arms and ammunition to the frontier. Russian Affairs. —There is reported to be a scarcity of bread in Merv. Fifty Cossacks are said to have arrived at Bujnurd from Gumbad-i-Kabus. The Persians arrested by Colonel Scouratt on the suspicion of communicating with the Germans in Herat have been released. General Fidaroff passed through Meshed on his return to Samarkand. He called on me again and I met him at dinner. He expressed his appreciation of such help as I have been able to give the Russian Military Authorities. Persian and German Intrigues.—It is said that Abdullah Khan, the Afghan trade agent, is now utilized as a channel of communication with the Germans in Afghanistan, as Persians in Meshed no longer dare to undertake this work. Abdullah Khan is now sending his post by unfrequented routes, as he is afraid of its being seized by Russian agents. • Secret —The acting Karguzar has sent a telegram to the Minister for Foreign Affairs informing him that he has succeeded in borrowing money for the expenses of the German and Austrian prisoners at Bujnurd and asking for a cheque in order that he may be relieved of his liability. Sews from Turbat-i-Haidari.—Vne British Agent called on General Fidaroff urin 2 the latter’s stay in Turbat, and the call was returned. The General, ffiile in Meshed, spoke highly to me of the manner m which Munshi Ala-ud-Din forks with the Russians there. One hundred Cossacks have returned to Turbat from Tabas. Thirtv sowars sent out to arrest Baluchis in connection with a recent robbery ave returned with nine leading men of the Baluchis, including one known to have een concerned in the robbery, and forty camels.

N0 -News from Kariz. —A caravan between Kariz and Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam, which had been attacked by nine robbers, who were driving it oh into the hills, was released by two Cossacks and the sonars employed by me on the iiontier. News from Herat. —An artillerymen who has recently arrived _ from Kabul renorts that every precaution is being taken to prevent soldiers joining turbulent tribesmen. All those on leave have been recalled and the roll is called regularly. He adds that the German party is still interned in the Bagh-i-Babur, and that nobody is allowed access to them. The Germans at Herat were much disturbed by the continued absence of their agent Asgharzada and at their instance one Shah Nazr, who acted as guide, and some Khowanin sowars, who are suspected of knowing what has become of him, have been sent in chains from Kuhsan to Herat and are being examined by^the Governor. It is reported from Kariz that the Governor of Kuhsan has also been summoned to Herat. The Germans have since been persuaded that Asgharzada is still alive, but they are still troubled regarding the fate of his companion, ol whom they can hear nothing. The Governor has been severely rebuked by the Amir for not having reported the names of the Anardarra frontier guard, owing to whose absence from their post the German party was enabled to cross the frontier, and the Commander of the Troops has been ordered to send the responsible Risaldar, Jemadar, and sowars in chains to Kabul. Information from Herat confirms the report that the Germans receive letters through Abdullah Khan, the trade agent in Meshed. The Governor has refused to permit eight pilgrims from Bukhara to visit Hazrat-i-Karkh and has ordered them to be sent back into Russian territory. Ten Baluchis who say that they originally came from Chakhansur have returned from Russian territory to Herat and say that they, like all other Afghan subjects, have been expelled and that their property was confiscated. Shaukat-ul-Mulk has again written to the Governor of Herat, ostensibly to complain of the depredations of Afghans, who carry off women and children from the Kainat, into which matter the Governor has ordered an inquiry. It is possible, of course, that Shaukat-ul-Mulk is making an opportunity for communicating with the Germans. Condition of Country. —Twelve laden and seven unladen camels have been carried off from a caravan at Babque on the Sarakhs road towards Zurabad. Fifteen laden mules have been carried off by Jamshidi robbers from Paskamar and the same robbers have carried off goods worth 200 tumans from a shop in Paskamar. Seven mounted and ten unmounted robbers are busy in this neighbourhood and have lifted sheep from the Zulfi tribe and robbed two travellers.

The Governor also stated that a Persian, suspected of being in German employ, had lately travelled from Afghanistan through Kain up to Khidri and back to Kain, whence he had moved m the direction of Tun. This country of course is m the Kussian sphere of observation. 3. An Afgxian has brought a story to Sistan of two Germans being seen in a carriage, escorted by four Bakhtyaris, between Anardarra and Herat, about six vr u S a ?°‘ in ^ ormant believes that this carriage belonged to Shaukat-ul- Mulk. 1 cannot discover that any of His Excellency’s carriages have been absent trom Birjand, for any length of time, though I had also heard in October last that Baschen had been using a carriage on the same road. 4. A traveller from Kavar (on the Kerman border) has brought news into Birjand that the Afsharis intend to send 400 men against Turbat-i-Haideri to recover the rifles confiscated by the Russians from pilgrims of their tribe ! ^ 5. The same individual says that the Germans are collecting 7,000 men for an auvance against Meshed, Birjand and Sistan. A band of 300 Sarhaddis under the son or nephew of the late Jehil is reported to have passed Kaleh Shur near Naiband on about the 10th December They seem to have come from Khabis. They looted Fidishk. Near Naiband they camped at a lead mine and made bullets for their empty cartridge cases. They left in the direction of Duhuk and Arbabad. I hear that Naib Husain Kashi is active on the road between Yezd and Tabas.

Berman Nayyir-ud-Daulali has announced his intention of leaving It is rumoured that Mumtahin-us-Sultanah has been appointed Karguzar. 1 saw this mentioned in the “ Nau-Bahar ” a short time ago. I have never heard of Mumtahin-us-Saltanah, but as the appointment was mentioned with disapproval by the Nau-Bahar ” he is probably a good man. Sardar-i-Makhsus, Governor of Turbat-i-Haidari, visited Meshed during the week to bid farewell to his grandfather, Nayyir-ud-Daulah, and returned to Turbat. He was escorted by Russian Cossacks. t Persian Affairs. —The celebration of the Ashura on November 18th passed off quietly and The processions were much fewer in number than usual. The Chief of Police prohibited processions from one turbulent quarter of the town. Some arrests made by the Russians in Meshed (see below) have greatly alarmed the local democrats, who are afraid to venture out of their houses. Russian Affairs. —M. de-Bravine and his wife arrived at Meshed on November 16th en route for Birjand, where he will relieve M. V. Romanovsky. General Fidaroff is expected to arrive shortly in Meshed from Samarkand, on inspection duty, and will go on to Turbat-i-Haidari. British Affairs. —Sir Aurel Stein reached Khaf safely on November 17th. Captain Thorburn left Turbat-i-Haidari for Birjand on November 14th. Muhammad Juma, who has been transferred to my office from Quetta, arrived safely in Meshed on November 17th. German and Persian Intrigues. —See Diary No. 46. The report that a band of six Austrian prisoners had succeeded in making their way to Meshed was incorrect. The band of four was sent off, disguised as Musalmans, towards Tehran, by the acting Karguzar, but my colleague and I were on the look-out and the four men were arrested by the Russians at Nishabur and have been brought back to Meshed. They will be sent back to Russia. The acting Karguzar addressed a long protest to my colleague, but gained nothing by it. See Diary No. 46. Agha Muhammad alias Pai Gul is still with me. My colleague tells me that he wishes to send him back to Russia for trial, with his wife, and I have told him that he can have the man when he likes. Agha Muhammad cannot prove that he is a British subject and his action in crossing the frontier surreptitiously with a passport which had not been vise for 4 years, was most suspicious. He has 500 roubles with him. In consequence of information received from the British Agent at Kariz, who has intercepted some correspondence, the Russians have arrested in Meshed some men who harboured Asgharzada, the Persian police officer from l un who joined the Germans, and who have been in communication with Herat on the subject. I hey could not at first find the principal offender, but arrested two other men implicated. On the following day I sent a man with them to point out Saiyid Zabihullah, in whose house Asgharzada had stayed, and Zabi.mllah was arrested. Asgharzada himself has apparently gone to Tehran. I have handed over the intercepted correspondence to the Russians for the purpose of the examination of the arrested men, but have asked for its return as I may be able to put it to good use. The acting Karguzar has protested very strongly against the arrest of these men, but to no purpose.CONFIDENTIAL. L if ! O | ' D Meshed Diary No. 48 for the week ending November 27th, 1915.

Hisam-ud-Daulali, the newly appointed Governor of arrived at Meshed on the afternoon of November 24th. Khaf and Gunabad, Nayyrr-ud-Daniah has now received a telegram from Tehran, asking him to remain m Khorassan as Governor-General. ° Persian affairs.—-The democrats of the town, at a recent meeting, discussed the question of arming against foreigners and Abdullah Mirza, Deputy Chief of Police, said that he could enlist all the police in their interest. Two men employed m the Department of Finance made the same promise with regard to the employes of their department. The democrats, however, were greatly alarmed by the arrests made by the Russians in the town and at their next meeting the question of taking up arms was not discussed. On the night of November 25th Ali Jawzi, Ali Buland and 31 other prisoners confined m the police prison escaped, wounded a policeman, and carried off the rifles of the police. The Department of Finance has received instructions from Tehran not to issue any pay to the police until further orders. Russian affairs.— Governor-General of Russian Turkistan was apparentlv much perturbed by news which reached him of the situation at Tehran about ten days ago, and ordered two sotnias of Cossacks and two field-guns from Ashkabad to Kuchan and Meshed. These reinforcements have left Ashkabad but will probably not advance further than Kuchan and may be recalled from there. _ Half a sotnia of the 2nd Semirechia Cossacks is said to have arrived at Bujnurd. 1 It is reported that Russian troops are concentrating at Termez. See Diary No. 47. Monsieur and Madame de Bravine have left for Birjand. Monsieur Kaal, Second Assistant in the Russian Consulate-General, has arrived from Petrograd. See Diary No. 47. The Russians have released one of the men.arrested by them in connection with the visit of Asgharzada to Meshed, but have made three more arrests. German and Persian intrigues.—My Colleague has sent back to Russia all the Austrian prisoners detained in custody by him. Secret. —The Persian Foreign Minister has sent a telegram to the acting Karguzar, blaming him for not having made better arrangements for the safe conduct of Austrian refugees to Meshed, so apparently the traffic will still go on, in spite of the improvement in the situation at Tehran. The Persian Custoifts official at Kharkah, on the frontier, is an agent in this business. The important prisoners expected have not arrived yet and have apparently not even reached the frontier.

The Governor-General much dislikes these attempts to interfere with his patronage and perquisites. The democrats of Meshed have decided to hide their records and hold no more meetings for a time, from fear of the Russians. Russian Affairs. —General Fidaroff arrived in Meshed on November 28th and has since left for Turbat-i-Haidari. He called on me and I met him at dinner. He told me that he had been sent to Persia by the Governor-General at Tashkent, who, he thought, had been unnecessarily alarmed. He will inspect the Cossacks at Turbat-i-Haidari and their dispositions for preventing the passage of German parties into Afghanistan. He told me that he had been ordered to go down to Birjand to interview the Officer Commanding there, but that he did not think that this would be necessary. My colleague, much to the alarm of Abdullah Khan, the Afghan trade agent, and of the local democrats, has posted a ghulam with two Cossacks on the road to Herat, to intercept the bearers of inflammatory correspondence. My colleague, under instructions from Petrograd, is said to be refusing passports to Jews wishing to travel from Persia to Russia. Four officers and twenty-eight men of the 2nd Semirechia Cossacks arrived in Meshed from Kuchan on November 25th and eighteen men of the same regiment arrived from Kuchan or Ashkabad on November 29th. German and Persian Intrigues. — Secret. The traffic in fugitive prisoners still continues. Six have arrived and fourteen more are expected in the neighbourhood of Bujnurd and wish to go direct to Tehran as it seems to have become known that it is not safe for such men to visit Meshed. The Karguzar is trying to arrange for their despatch to Tehran but I have informed my colleague of the affair and hope that the prisoners will be cut off by Cossacks from Kuchan. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —Jamadar Sharbat Ali Khan, with 70 Hazaras, arrived at Turbat on November 26th and left for Birjand on the following day. Monsieur and Madame de Bravine left Turbat for Birjand on November 26th. Apparently the Cossacks are being withdrawn from Tabas and Tun to Gunabad, Turbat and Kain.

Romanovski seems to attribute his recall to me, but I hear from Captain Thorburn that it is chiefly brought about by M. Samsonoff’s complaints. The latter told the Persians openly before leaving Kain that M. Romanovski’s removal was imminent. 3. M. Romanovski seems to have given out, before leaving Birjand, that Shaukat-ul-Mulk was about to be superseded in compliance with the desire of the British Legation. The news that Shaukat-ul-Mulk is about to be replaced by Hisam-ud-Dauleh has even reached Sarhad, where the latter is believed to be still anti-British. The Hazara Levies. The second contingent of Hazaras from Meshed, 70 in number, reached Birjand on the 6th December. The men are being distributed along the road to Neh. H isam-ud-Dauleh .

An unsatisfactory affair has occurred which shows the attitude of the Person forces towards our Column in Kainat. Lieutenant Brownlow, 28th Light Cavalry, was riding in uniform alone on the evening of 27th November. About a mile from town on the Mud road he overtook a party of 15 Persian sarhazes (infantry-men) in uniform but without arms. As he passed they laughed and jeered at him and one tried to hit his horse with a stick He took no notice and passed on. When he was a few yards ahead one of the soldiers threw a stick at his horse, which missed. Mr. Brownlow then turned his horse and charged and scattered the party, though no one was hurt. Mr. Vice- Consul New at once reported the case to the Governor and demanded the punishment of the sarhazes in his presence. The Governor’s subsequent replies have not been satisfactory. He first promised punishment if the charge could be proved, but objected to Mr. New being present. He then declared that Basir-i- Nizam, the Officer Commanding the regiment, could not trace the men. Later he intimated that the men had left for the Yazdan post on the day of the occurrence and they would be recalled. Now he write\that a special officer has been sent out to Yazdan to inflict 30 stripes on each sarhaz implicated. We are telling him that this proposal cannot be accepted. Simultaneously, the Governor has been interfering in the construction of some stables for which his Deputy Misbah Diwan and Haji Malik-ut-Tujjar have contracted with the Officer Commanding the British troops. It is alleged that His Excellency was only trying to extort shirini (a commission) out of the contractors, who are, however, on the most intimate terms with him. After an official protest from the Vice-Consul, work was resumed. His Excelllency declares that he has not received any instructions yet from Farman Farma, Minister of the Interior, to co-operate with us in dealing with German parties. The situation in Sistan. We are noticing a tendency on the part of both the Indian supply contractors and also of the big Persian farmers to hide their stocks of barley (in particular) and wheat in the hope of raising prices inordinately. We know that there are adequate stocks in the country, but the position is difficult at present. Nizam-ud- Dauleh and his cousin Haider Ali Khan are believed to own 2,000 Khar wars (Sistani) of barley, Sardar Purdil Khan 1,000 and Seth Sulaiman, according to the statement of his Quetta agent just made to the Assistant Director of Supplies 2,500. Seth Sulaiman himself, however, admits to only having about 100 Kharwars’ The people in Sistan in general are grumbling about the attitude of the Revenue Department and the big Sardars and are threatening to make demom st rations.

The townspeople believed that a force of Germans and Afghans was about to attack the town. 1 ™ * Our troops of course got under arms, but by 10 o’clock confidence was restored. Mr. New and his Russian colleague wrote a joint letter at 7-30 pm to the Governor, enquiring the cause of the excitement. His Excellency pooh-poohed le affair, but there is reason to believe that he feared an attack from the British troops consequent upon the telegraph line having been commandeered the previous night for our use owing to the breakdown of the Persian Central Line at Kum. His Excellency subsequently has admitted that he had, five days previously received very disquieting news from Tehran and had also heard from Sistan that the British were preparing to seize that town by a coup de main. It is not known whence he received the latter information, unless Ebtehaj-us-Sultan, who had recently arrived from Sistan and was dining with him that night, had gained some inkling ot the British preparations on the night of 29th October. &amp; The Deputy Governor of Sistan. Sartip Muhammad Reza Khan, brother of Hisam-ud-DauIah, has been ordered by telegraph from Tehran to supply 50 infantry-men and 20 camel sowars for service at Gunabad under his brother. The men are to be paid from Sistan revenues, ine Sartip professes to dislike the arrangement very much and threatens to resign. I have not given him any encouragement to adopt this course. ^ The Sartip apparently is short of funds as he cannot pay his dues to the Birjand Revenue Department, which amount to 2,500 tomans on account of his villages m Kam.

Another detachment of 100 Cossacks is expected to arrive shortly from Askhabad. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —Nazim-i-Nizam (see Diary No. 43 ) has been examined in Turbat. He stoutly denies having received any instructions to assist the Germans in any way, or having assisted them, but he admits having virtually fled when a German officer defied him to disarm his party. There is nothing absolutely incorrect in the written orders taken from him. They are absolutely colourless and in the case of any difficulty arising he was to report the case and await instructions. As he was not on the telegraph line, such orders were futile, as they were doubtless intended to be. I have advised my colleague not to permit the return of the captured rifles to the Persian authorities, and he agrees with me. Nazim-i-Nizam has been released. Zulfikar Khan has received telegraphic orders to send 30 sowars to Meshed as soon as possible. The Karguzar of Meshed officially informed the Karguzar of Turbat-i-Haidari that he was going to Tehran “ temporarily. ” It is said that 50 Cossacks are to be posted at Turshiz.

These two officials, who have at one time or another been in conflict with the Consulate, express anxiety as to what treatment will be accorded to them. The situation in Birjand.

I hear that Zahir-ul-Islam, a son-in-law of the late Muzaffar-ud-din Shah has recently failed to obtain the office of Muta-Walli of the Shrine, though he’was prepared to pay 7,000 tumans for it. The inference is that the present holder of the office has made a higher bid. j Shaikh -Tatar, leader oi the mujahidsm Kazarun, lately sent a telegram to the Aghazada at Meshed, asking him to urge the ministers to support the mujahids.

Some of the men are said to be under orders for Meshed, but I doubt this.

(Secret) —The Karguzar has telegraphed to the Persian “ lor 1 0reig .^ lnfo rnimg him that in accordance with his orders the st-iciest secrecy will be observed in connection with prisoners and refugees from Russia. Aone had m fact arrived at Meshed for a considerable time until five or six ^ays ago, w en three Austrians arrived disguised as Persians and were quietly sent ott to Tehran. My colleague believes that they were sent to Herat and is much perturbed m consequence. He tells me that the Karguzar has promised to inform inm oi the arrival and departure of all prisoners, but as a matter of fact all officials m thls P art °i Persia help Germans and Austrians to the best of their ability. Persian Affairs.— local democrats have been attempting to make capital out ot the murder of Amir-i-Azam by representing it to be the work of their party and to have been due to the prince’s goodwill towards foreigners. They have circulated reports of the murder of several prominent men in Tehran for the same reason and speak of a list of the proscribed, which includes British and Russian Consular officers, but as people are able to ascertain by telegraph the falsehood of the reports circulated by them this foolish Persian trick has little effect. Peace has at length been made between the Barbaris and the Taimuris each tribe agreeing to make no claim for compensation against the other. The chiefs of the two tribes are to do their best to compensate and satisfy those of their tribes men who have suffered loss. See Diary No. 39, Sayyid Muhsin is trying to influence students in Meshed against joining the demociats. Two men with a quantity of counterfeit notes of the Imperial Bank of Persia have been arrested by the Customs officials at Khakistar on the frontier. The sellers of arms in Meshed, whose trade has been stopped for some time recently applied to the Governor-General for permission to reopen their shops. Their stocks have in consequence been attached for the present by the local government. British Affairs. —See Diary No. 41. It now appears that the robbers who 6 ! attacked the three ^wars of my escort were some of Khudadad’s men, for whom Shaukat-ul-Mulk is responsible with the three sons of Mir Qalandar Khan, who belong to the Qainat and four Afghans who rob indiscriminately on either side of the Perso-Afghan border Russian Affairs. —M.

A detachment of 150 left Meshed for Turbat-i-Haidan on October 9th. The Hussains are again perturbed by accounts which they have received of the attitude of Afghans towards Germans, and the reception accorded to the latter. News from Turbat-i-Haidari.-The Karguzar at Turbat-i-Haidari is heavily in debt niny of his creditors being foreign subjects, and the Russian Consul has threatened to recover by force the debts due to Russian subjec s. The Persian Foreign Office has called upon the Karguzar for an explanation. News from Kariz.-^ee Diary No. 41. Asgharzada and another German agent have arrived at Kuhsan, with the intention of coming to Meshed, but unfortunately M.rza Hassan Khan, Finance agent at Kariz warned him that we were on the look-out for him and he remains at Kuhsan for the present as the guest of the Governor, Habibullah Khan. I have made arrangements to have him arrested in Meshed should he succeed in eluding us on the frontier. Herat News. —The Commander of the Troops was most indignant on learning that the tins buried by the Germans near the Bagh-i-Shah were bombs and said he would report tire matter to the Amir. The artillerymen who robbed a caravan of Kurramis some time ago have been arrested and have confessed their guilt. Kamal Khan and Agha Muhammad Khan, Barakzais, who are the chiefs of about a thousand families of pastoral Barakzais have come to Herat and complain of the tvranny of the Governor of Girishk. The Governor of Herat has ordered them to send their 'families to Badghis and is looking for land for them m Qal ah-i-Nau, Qadis, and Chakhcharan. He has also asked the Amir for orders in their case. The man who left Herat with Asgharzada appears to have been one of the muleteers who accompanied the Germans to Herat. There are reports of the arrival of three parties of German refugees, numbering 48 in all, in Afghan Turkistan. Most of them are said to be hatless and shoeless, but some are better clad and even have fire-arms. They will give no satisfactory account of themselves and are to be sent to Kabul. . Colonel Scouratt, the Russian Military Attache, tells me that according to his information there are two Germans as well as the two Austrians at Herat. These are probably men who were allowed to return to the frontier on the pretext of searching for their heavy baggage. Those left in Herat are eagerly expecting good news from Kabul, but are depressed by the news of the arrest of their returning muleteers by the Russians as this indicates that their line of retreat has been cut off. The return of the men who went to the frontier and failed to find their baggage has discredited the small party at Herat. Fears are, however, expressed lest the pro-German and pro-Turkish articles in the Siraj-ul-Akhbar should influence the officers, and through them, the troops. . . * • »» T. W.

The Political Situation in Sistan. This at present is very satisfactory. The Deputy Governor and other officials are extremely friendly. The former, for the first time in my experience, sent his carnage out ten miles to the edge of the Hamun to bring me in to Town on the occasion of my return to Sistan. I had previously informed the Karguzar that my arrival would be private, but avo bodies of about thirty Sowars each came out to meet me, representing the Karguzar and the Finance Department. I have also received a letter of welcome from the Chief Mujtehid. The Sistanis do not believe in the possibility of a German force invading the district. They are on the other hand congratulating themselves on the free expenditure of money in their midst on supplies required for our troops. An illuminating discussion on this subject took place in a Majlis at the house of oardar Purdil Khan just after his return from Birjand. :3ived on 15 UtC 191 5 with ii:dia foreign secretary’s Letter.

A Pewan Officials.~My Colleague has agreed to the reappointment of Shuia- \id-Daulah as Governor of Kuchan, Eais-ut-Tujjar, the Russian protege who was most apprehensive of him, having raised no objection. The Governor-General is receiving 6,000 tumans for the appointment. Mustafa Mirza, the present Gov- ernor of Kuchan, is said to have made 80,000 tumans during his year’s tenure of the office. J The Governor-General has reappointed Imad-ul-Mulk Governor of Tabas and his son Imad-ul-Mamalik Governor of Gunabad. Persian Affairs. See last week’s diary. The information from Nishabur regarding Saiyid Muhsin was incorrect. The Saiyid is well disposed and is work ing m Meshed in the interests of peace and order. I believe that the Aghazada who is returning to Meshed, has been conciliated by my Colleague, and if this is so it may be hoped that he and Saiyid Muhsin will work together. Russian Affairs.—k Cossack has been shot at Amirabad, four farsakhs from Kuchan, and M. de Beauvais of the Russian Consulate-General has been sent out to Kuchan to inquire into the matter. The guilty persons have been arrested and have confessed their guilt, and M. de Beauvais is pressing for their execution. The Cossacks were unfortunately informed, probably by an agent of Mustafa Mirza, the Governor, before the matter was inquired into, that the Daranlu Kurds of Ab-i-Divana were concerned in the murder, and fired into their camp, killing three and wounding three. The Kurds, who have come to Meshed and taken bast in the Shrine, also accuse the Russians of having plundered them and raped their women. Kasim Baig, the late Russian Tajirbashi, has been shot in the back while passing along one of the principal streets of Meshed, but the wound is not serious. His assailant was a barber named Muhammad Bakir, a Russian subject, who was a partisan of Kardash Bala. I hear that the garrison of Pul-i-Khatun .consisted on September 16 of 15 infantry, but the barracks were being prepared for the reception of Cossacks who were expected. The garrison of Kushk is said to consist now of six or seven battalions. German Intrigues—On September 16 an Austrian and two Germans reached Pul-i-Kiiatun and having obtained a guide left ostensibly for Gftjmab, but my informant believed that they would go to Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam before crossing the Afghan frontier. I have informed my Colleague and advised him to have a look-out kept for them. They were disguised as Russians. My reporter says that they were not escaped prisoners but as only the Austrian could speak a little Russian and none of them could speak Persian they can hardly have been agents. News from Turbat-i-Haidari. —See last week’s diary. One of the sowars wounded near Imbrani and the Mirza of the post house have since died. It appears from the report of a sowar seized by the robbers two nights before their attack on the post carriage and afterwards released that the robbers were men from Kain and Birjand and not Baluchis or Afghans. Captain Thorburn, with the party of Barbaris arrived at Turbat-i-Haidari on September 17 and left in the direction of Kain on the following day. Haji Mardan Ali Khan, the Ex-Governor of Tabas, arrived at Turbat-i- Haidari, having fled from Tabas, on September 18. The Russians confiscated four rifles and three Mauser pistols from him in Faizabad. News from Kuchan: —Mustafa Mirza, Governor of Kuchan, has been punished for some of his misdeeds ; on September 22 he and two of his creatures Hizhabr-i- Nizam and Haji Muhammad Ibrahim were seized by Russian Cossacks, beaten, and carried before M. de Beauvais and the Karguzar. The Governor has since been released, but the other two men are detained.2 IHHHpv*” News K 7 z -- See laS Y e v e e’ S admTtted that they'were w^thIheTerman were arrested by the ^sians h detaine d in custody pending the receipt U a, e— »•.». r rr h * QTinilfTi Tom The Ilbaigi of the kaudani Taimuris is m News from litbVe Governor of Kuhsan and with Shaikh Muhammad Amin correspondence with the Shaikh Jam who has some influence, and is enlisting Khan of Herat, a d ^X d v ? 3 with ^ the country in the neigh- Afghan ruffians ^ thieve Shuia-ul-Mulk the Barban has written to bourhood of Turbat-i-Shai • th 3 ffians have already crossed the border 4 isss e “s agent seems to have been Asgharzada.

Russian Affairs.—-It is reported that some Eussian Cossacks shot and slightly wounded a Persian who refused to admit them to Kalat-i-Nadiri. A^anullah and another Persian sowar, having been found guilty of the murder of the Cossack near Kuchan, were sentenced to death, but their sentence has since been commuted, with the consent of the Eussian authorities, to one of imprisonment for life. They accused their officers Hizhabr-i-Nizam and Vali Khan ot instigating them to commit the murder but the officers deny their guilt, they have been flogged and will probably escape further punishment. Brihrfi Affairs.— Thorburn returned to Meshed on September 30, with Pafladar Sher Muhammad Khan. I regret to say that the three men of the escort who accompanied Captain Torburn to Kain were attacked on their way back, on the morning of September 29, at one farsakh from Imbrani, by 29 robbers, 19 of whom were mounted. The robbers carried off one rifle, 1,000 rounds of ammunition, one sword, two escort horses, and all the baggage except the tents. Fortunately there were no casualties among the sowars, of the robbers one was killed and two were wounded. Such steps as are possible are being taken. Rews from Turbat-i-Haidari. —See last week’s diary. The Arabs and the Tabasis arrested at Kariz have been brought into Turbat-i-Haidari. They had with them 1,200 tumans in cash. See Diary No. 38. Of the prisoners taken by the Eussian Cossacks at Shurab the Turkish officer and a cook being ill, were left at ChaharDih. Two Afghans were brought into Turbat, where the British agent’s servant acted as interpreter when they were examined. He describes the retreat of the German party on hearing of the approach of the Cossacks and the attack on Shurab. The Afghans, who appear to be miserable creatures, say that they were accompanying the Germans as they had promised them transport and free food if they would accompany them to Afghanistan, but that they had no idea of fight- ing. At Shurab, however, the Ge mans compelled them to fire on the Eussians. The G ermans buried their money at night and defended the village fort at Shurab on the following day until noon when they made their escape.

One Afghan was killed and the others were captured. A telegram purporting to come from the leading men of Turbat-i-Haidari, and complaining of the oppressive conduct of the Cossacks there recently appeared “ the Tehran paper Nau Bahar. The leading men of Turbat have repudiated it and inquiries' show that it was sent by a number of persons of no consequence. A contradiction is to be sent to the Nau Bahar. News from Kariz.-The 6 Arabs and 3 Tabasis arrested here stated in the course of thek examination that they had been employed by the Germans as muleteers but had returned from Herat as they did not wish to accompany them to Kabul. Amhu the sowar carrying the post of this Agency to Herat was attacked by thee mb^rfLXLnaVon 8 September 23. His r.flehome^h andoth belongings were stolen and the post was taken. I await a f u ™ er r&lt; jP ort ±rom He'at A solitary sowar carrying the post between Meshed and Herat always runs a risk. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam—Some rogue has told tales of my agent in Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam to the Deputy Governor of that place who has accused him of being a British spy and has threatened him. News from Herat.—The German party is marching by double stages towards Kabul and is said to be well received on the road. The Amir has sent to Naib Sakra farrmn dealing with his complaints of the treatment accorded by the Governor to the Germfn party and informing him that what the Governor had done had been done under his orders. On September 18 a German, an Arab, and two Persians arrived at Herat from Anardarrah. This was probably Paschen returning from his unsuccessful irmX'er Persia. According to a report from the Governor of Anardarrah he has 3 helped four “ Government guests ” from Herat to recross the frontier at Thana Naibasta where a carriage with two men was waiting for them, m ^ ^ thev drove off. The Havaladar of the Governor’s mounted orderlies has orders to take the four men who returned to Herat, and who are accommodated in the Chahar Bagh for a daily walk for an hour or two and to brmg them safely back again. Ite Governor has rebuked the Jamadar of the frontier post of Jahbuza for delaying and searching one Ahmad, who was carrying letters to the Germans m Afghanistan an from Germans in Persia to the Governor of Herat. Shaukat-ul-Mulk has sent a carpet and some saffron as a present to Naib Salar, the Commander of the Troops, with a letter impressing upon him the necessity for concord among all Musalmans ‘ especially at this time. ine attention appears to me to be unnecessary and suspicious. No post had arrived at Herat from Kabul for two weeks prior to September 18. The post that arrived on that day brought news that cholera had broken out in Kabul, and that the Amir had left the town. The Commander of the Troops has disarmed and dismissed the officers of the frontier post who were responsible for permitting the German party to cross e frontier. The Governor of Herat has written to Abdullah Khan to ask him to P rot &lt;f* to the Governor-General of Khurasan against the settlement at Dagharu, on frontier, of Sarwar Khan Alizai, an Afghan refugee of predatory habits. Twenty persons claiming to be Baluchis of Chakansur desirous of to their former home have arrived at Dahana-i-Zulfikar and the Governor of Herat 1 ms sent orders to the Deputy Governor of Gulran to go to meet these people and bring them to Herat if their story is true, but otherwise to turn them back. Five hundred Barbaris from Kabul and 200 from Kandahar have complained that the Kotwal refuses to issue passes to them for their pilgrimage to Meshed.

Persian Officials. Prince Amir-i-Azam, Governor of Shalirud, has unfortunately been assassinated. The report received by me is to the effect that while out shooting he accidentally shot and killed one of his own men. He expressed his regret and paid blood-money to the deceased’s brother Ismail, Shaukat-i-Nizam, who was also in his service, but Shaukat-i-Nizam seems to have doubted whether the occurrence was an accident, and on September 29th or 30th, when Amir-i-Azam, who had gone to Damghan to shoot, was sleeping in his tent, he was attacked by Shaukat-i-Nizam and two others, who fired six bullets into him and killed him. The murderers have absconded and the Persian Government has issued orders for their arrest. Amir-i-Azam s son has been appointed to the government of Shahrud but as he is not old enough to perform the duties a deputy is to be appointed from Tehran. Mustafa Mirza, the ea&gt;Governor of Kuchan, has arrived at Meshed, after some difficulty in getting away from Kuchan, due to the action of Mirza Farajullah Khan, Deputy Governor of Shirvan, who wished to recover from Mustafa Mirza, before he left, the money which he had extorted from him. Shuja-ud-Daulah, the former Governor, who has been re-appointed, has either left or is about to leave Meshed to resume the appointment. I hear that he has paid Arfa-ul-Mamalik, head mirza of the Russian Consulate-General, 1,000 tumans as the price of his good offices, and has promised to pay a like sum in a year’s time. I hear that the Karguzar has received a telegram from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs thanking him for his good services in Meshed and giving him the choice of remaining at Meshed or going to Baghdad or Tiflis as Consul-General. The Karguzar has wisely refused all three. See Diary No. 40. I have been, bringing pressure to bear on the Governor General in connection with the robbery of the sowars of my escort, and there is some show of activity, but I doubt whether it will have any result. The robbers have been seen with their plunder at a village 7 farsakhs from Khaf and are supposed to have been going towards Afghanistan. Persian Affairs. —The Shrine officials have protested to the Chief of Police against the action of his men who have shot and killed a thief as he was stealing from the shop of a cloth-merchant within the limits of the Shrine. The Chief of Police has replied that no protest was made when the followers of Yusuf Herati shot a police officer in front of the Imam’s tomb. The Police are being urged to subscribe for the maintenance of the gendarmerie. The democrats discuss wonderful, rumours of the activity of the Germans and Abdullah Khan, the Afghan Tajirbashi, displays much mischievous activity in spreading these rumours and rumours of Afghan preparations for Jihad. Although a Sunni, he has begun to hold rauzahlnani meetings in his house to please the Persians. Russian Affairs. —There is still trouble regarding the passport question and the Karguzar will issue no passports for Persians to travel in Russia. A Persian Armenian here, who wishes to visit Russia on business, complains that he can get no passpc rfc. He wishes to travel alone but would have no objection to furnishing a photograph of his wife if necessary. The Persian authorities say, however, that there must be one rule for all Persians, and that until the difficulty regarding the photographs of women is removed no passports will be issued. It is reported that 80 Cossacks with a machine-gun have arrived at Kuchan en route for Sabzavar. Customs Department. —M. M. Yercheval and Gyselinx have gone on tour to select suitable sites for customs-houses on the frontier.

He could have easily done this, as, owing to the restrictions imposed upon the Officer Commanding the Sistan Column by Army Headquarters, no detach ments are at present distributed along the road in question. My news-reporters however have heard nothing of the German’s reappearance. ( 1 ) See Diary No. 38. After interviewing the parents of the deceased levy Yusuf of Dastgird, I have paid them, through the Karguzar of Birjand, 500 Tomans m compensation. The people are very poor Ismaili peasants who have no idea of the value of money ; they seemed more concerned at the disappearance of 16 Krans and a knife from their son’s pocket than gratified at the announcement of what I proposed to pay them. A satisfactory feature in the case, however, is that they have sent me a nephew to take the place of the deceased youth among our levies. The Karguzar, when receiving the money, remarked that he hoped that the Russian Government would follow suit and give satisfaction for the two Persian lives taken at Kain.^ This^ hope will not be fulfilled as M. Samsonoff refused to admit the Russians’ liability. It is possible, however, that an isolated Cossack or two may eventually pay the penalty, as Persian feeling is very bitter on the subject still. (2) The Government of India have sanctioned the construction of huts for officers and men at Sistan for the winter. They also contemplate retaining a portion of the force at Birjand. Horses for the Cavalry are now on their way to Sistan from Quetta. Russian Affairs. M. Samsonoff left Kain for Russia on the 6th September. His health has apparently quite broken down. See Diary No. 27. The unfortunate Kadkhuda, Mir Mehdi Khan, who was supporting the Government Sowars, and who has been held responsible for the blind ing of Sardar Khudadad Khan’s brother-in-law, has been forced into compensating the Naruis to the tune of 15,000 Tomans cash, with a number of camels and horses besides three girls to be given away in marriage. The settlement was arranged by Mulla Muhammad Mehdi, the Chief Mujtehid of Sistan. See Diary No. 26. Sherif Halil has reappeared in Sistan and has applied to the Consulate for pecuniary assistance. He says that he has visited Meshed and bought Rs. 100 worth of turquoises there. He was robbed on the return journey by Zarakzais at Anjira near Bandan. See Diary No. 39.

The offender is quite a young man and H s Excellency proposed that he should be released, promising, however, to take a big security from him for his future neutrality. In the circumstances I could not refuse my concurrence. 3 A Sistan Baluch news-writer reports that he went to Tarakun (in Afghan Sistan) early m October to meet three Sarhaddi messengers whom he had heard about as havmg taken a letter from Sardars Taj Muhammad Keki, Mir Khan Meruzai and the son of the late Sardar Jehil to the Kadkhuda of Mirak in Afghanistan. The Sarhaddi Sardars wished to know whether the Governor of Chakhansur would give them refuge, if they sided with the Germans and had to flee ! The same news-writer has heard that Sardars Saiyid Khan and Bahram Khan have told the Germans that they intend to remain neutral, but if the Germans are victorious thev will pay their respects to them. 4 A Sistani passing through Yazdan has heard that 80 mule-loads of rifles recently reached Herat via Dastgar and Ghuryan.

Nothing very definite was achieved but a rather lukewarm promise was extracted from the Sardar that he would provide 145 camels after the Id (20th October). The rate of hire asked for is rather excessive, and we hope to be able to reduce it. We believe also that the Sardar can supply many more animals if he chooses. Suspicious Characters. A Sindhi, calling himself Muhammad, son of Fateh Muhammad, of Larkana, aged about 25, appeared at the Birjand Vice-Consulate on the 11th October saying that he was a spy sent into Afghanistan by the Collector of Larkana. He has brought a long rigmarole in writing, about the German party which reached Herat, containing only news which he may have picked up in any Persian village and we do not believe his account about himself.

A Kami of good family, named Mir Ali Khan, son of Mir Husain had left his home at Takhtaban or Sarab near Duruksh about thV beginning of September to forward German propaganda in Sistan. He is believed to have travelled a part of the way through Afghan territory. He was traced in Sisten city, after having visited Mian Kang,, where his father is employed in a civil capacity and Khwaja Ahmed, the residence of Sardar Khudadad Khan. Under mv advice Colonel Wikeley tried to arrest him, but the man succeeded in escaping The Deputy Governor has since been trying to shield him, but Shaukat-ul-Mulk has agreed to have him brought up to Birjand in custody, and to punish him for entering German service, after putting him on trial.

Saiyid Rozi is a notorious character who was deported from Kerman to Karachi and, after undergoing a term of imprisonment, was returned last winter to Sistan, which he claimed was his home. He seems to haye severe! Persian wives in different localities. The men are being watched. &amp;evcr ai Sarhad News. A relative of a Consulate levy has just returned from Sarhad.

Persian Officials.—The Governor-General was summoned to the Telegraph Office on the evening of September 11 th and had a conversation with the Prime Minister, who insisted on a settlement of the dispute between the Barbaris and the Taimuris and on the return of the rifles taken by the Russians from the Shirazis It may be doubted whether the Governor-General will be able to arrange for the return of the rifles, but he has issued a notice to the leading men of the Barbaris and Taimuris, summoning them to a meeting to arrange terms and warning them that the tribe which refuses to attend will be attacked by the troops, which are still at Fariman. It is a pity that he did not think of taking this action before. He com plained to the Prime Minister of the difficulties which had been created for him by intrigues and from what I have since learnt probably mentioned the Commander of the Troops and Mutaman-us-Saltanah as those who were most active against him. The former has been busily intriguing but the complaint against the latter is founded only on the Governor-General’s personal dislike for him. 71 The Governor-General left the Telegraph Office well pleased with the result of his interview and is said to have been promised some troops. The Karguzar, who was until lately the Governor-General’s jackal, hastened to the Telegraph Office when he heard that the Governor-General had been summoned there, but the Governor-General did not disclose any of the conversation to him. The Commander of the Troops has sent in his resignation in consequence of the failure of his intrigue to oust the Governor-General. The Karguzar also informs me that he has several times sent in his resignation but that he has received no definete answer as yet. The Governor-General has sent the Superintendent of Telegraphs to me with a view to the re-establishment of friendly relations. I have replied that I cannot trust a man who has once lied to me but that I am willing to judge of the Governor- General’s attitude by his actions. I warned the Superintendent, however, that there need be no attempt to step in between me and my Russian Colleague, as we were working together and repeated all conversations to one another, and that each would regard an unfriendly act towards the other as an unfriendly act towards himself. Mutaman-us-Saltanah left on September 17th, ostensibly to take up his appointment as Persian Consul-General in Constantinople. He told me that he had been ordered to proceed direct to Constantinople without returning to Tehran. Persian Affairs. —Muhammad Agha, Naib of the Gendarmerie, and Abul Kasim, Naib of the Artillery, have had a dispute at a gambling and drinking party in the house of the former. Each summoned his men to his assistance and Muhammad Agha was severely beaten. He then drew his Mauser pistol and began firing at random and a neighbour named Maula Khan, whose son-in-law was one of the guests and who came to see what was happening, was shot dead. Both Naibs are now under arrest. It is reported that Saiyid Ahmad Ali Shah, chief of the Barbaris, sold to Salar Khan, Baluch, 400 camels and 2,000 sheep which had been taken from the Taimuris and handed over part of the price to the Commander of the Troops. Russian Affairs. —I hear that the Cossacks have had difficulty in obtaining fodder at Tabas but my Colleague has succeeded in obtaining orders from the Governor-General and the Mutawalli of the Tabas shrine directing Imad-ul-Mulk to supply them with fodder. It is reported in Meshed that the inhabitants of Krasnovodsk are leaving the town owing to the scarcity of supplies. Keesived on 16 tvOV i d I b with INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter.

The democrats compare this enlistment of Barbaris (Hazaras) with the enlist ment of BaMyaris by the Germans, and believe that the men are being sent to Sistan to bring arms for the Russian troops to Meshed. News from Turbat-i-Haidari.—PUgrieoa from Yezd have reported the capture bv the Cossacks of part of a German party at Shurab near Tabas. On observing through their binocffiars the approach of the Cossacks, the Germans who were drinking tea in a caravanserai, ffid, leaving behind them ten of whom the Russians captured four, who were brought to Tabas.

The Governor of Kariz has sent the owners to Herat, with a letter to the Go\ ern . On September 12th six Arabs and three Tabasis arrived at Kariz from Herat. It seems that these men were in the service of the German party that reached Herat but left the Germans and were sent back. Colonel Popoff has arrested them ’and has asked the British Agent, who gave him information regarding them, to attend a court of inquiry to be held on them. Some Kaudani Taimuris robbed the Arzi Hazaras of some of their camels.. The camels were recovered but the incident is likely to cause trouble between those two Sunni tribes. . News from Nishabur.— Twenty Russian Cossacks are now stationed in Nisha- bur and posts are maintained at Kadamgah and Fakhr-i-Daud to the east and west of the town. They are searching for the rifles sold here by the Shirazi pilgrims and are disarming travellers on the road. They have recovered five rifles and 500 cart ridges, said to be German and of good quality, from a land-owner who bought them. Mirza Muhsin, brother of Sadr-ul-Ulama, a mujlahid of Tehran, has arrived at Nishabur on his way to Meshed and has been well received. He says that his mission is to stir up the people of Meshed against foreigners. Mirza Muhsin has since arrived at Meshed and has been visited by many people. News from Herat.—The Baluchis referred to in Diary No. 33 were 160 m number and on their arrival at Herat from Bala Murghab the Governor sent them t 0 Chakansur with orders that they were to receive allotments of land in that e3 of the Artillery.’aiulTew his sword o^hm on a parade Mlled With the Commandant did n^acti^ for KabuTon September 5 th, leftthemJorthLwhole^arty numteed ol ^° f f e “ foUwer ? «ust have ill in Herat and another Austrian and a Person stv f ^ aS left serioud y him.

Condition of Country.—The country is disturbed. The quarrel between the aimuns and the Barbaris has not been settled ; from the robbery of the post near Imbram it appears that Salar Khan’s Baluchis are out for plunder, a caravan of travellers has been attacked and robbed near Ibrahimabad, and Muhammad ,l ‘” “ ,h * ““ ^ T.

The Russians say that all roads running eastward north of the British sphere of influence are closed but that a gap remains on the south between their troops and the British force. The Cossacks are suffer ing from fever and about half of them are on the sick list. I have heard from more than one source praise of their behaviour to the people, and of the general satis faction at the restoration of order in the districts where they are stationed. German Intrigues .—On August 29th and 30th four Persians, two of whom were named Haji Ghulam Riza and Haji Baba, were arrested by Russian Cossacks in the House of Roelich, the Austrian dentist, and taken to the Russian Consulate- General. The two men named belonged to a party of pro-German propagandists said to have been sent by the German Legation from Tehran. Four mujahids who escaped from the German party which fled from Kain reached Meshed and were arrested by the Chief of Police but were afterwards released. The Chief of Police, however, on receiving a hint from me that the Rus sians would be likely to hold him accountable, rearrested the men. The Russians have arrested at Daragaz and brought to Meshed a man named Izzat Ardabili, suspected of being a German agent. The Russians have arrested at Bujnurd the Karguzar’s German governess. News from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam.—Both Shaukat-u^Daulah and Nusrat-ul- Mulk, chief of the Taimuris, are said to have telegraphed to Tehran saying that the Taimuris and Barbaris will never live at peace after the quarrel now in progress and recommending that one tribe should purchase the lands of the other and that the tribes relinquishing its lands should emigrate to Afghanistan. kand. \ uU'i SECRETARY’S 4 7 m iebia foreign / Letter.

September 7th.—It is rumoured in Birjand that the Russians have evacuated Tiflis! September 8th. —My spy at Duhuk has been posing as a servant of Shaukat-ul- Mulk ! He has had a trying time, as Imad-ul-Mamalik, the strong adherent of the Germans, has taken refuge there from the Russians. My man has now come in with a letter from Imad-ul-Mamalik to Shaukat-ul-Mulk. I understand that Imad-ul-Mamalik was recently visited by 25 Persian Sowars from Meshed, who had been ordered to disarm him and remove him to Meshed. The party however contented themselves with carrying off 16 rifles. My spy at Ahingaran has sent in word that the German Paschen has returned from Herat with four Austrians and four Arab muleteers. The party was at Karez-i- Malki on the 6th September and was going to Takht-i-Jan (or Takhtaban) near Sarab on the 7th. It was the two chief men of this locality—Ali Akbar, Tehvildar, and Ali Khan, son of Mir Husain Sultan—who gave the Germans most help on their journey eastwards. Paschen appears to have given out that he has come to arrange for the collec tion of supplies for a large force which will pass through the country a few weeks hence, and also that he himself is going to Ispahan with despatches. (Note.—On 11th September the Governor informed me that he had received a report that Paschen was only accompanied by six Muhammadan Sowars.)

There are also floating rumours about another fight which occurred earlier, XT, t Sven or Bushruyieh, between Russians and Germans, m which the Russians sufced most, but my colleague, who has also heard the stories, cannot give me any information on the subject. September 10th -The local Acting Bank Manager has received a telegram from Tehrff Enouncing that His Majesty’s and the European Staff of the Bank are leaving Ispahan for Ahwaz on the 14th instant. T hear from His Majesty’s Minister that the political situation has improved, as the Russian Government is sending troops in considerable force to Enzeh..

A. left Awaz for Yazdan on the 7th instant I ought to hear from him soon on the subject. September 11th.—Uy Russian colleague has heard from Turbat-i-Haidan that the Cossacks have captured near Tabas one Turkish officer, two Afghans and several Arabs and Persians. One Afghan was killed. A German doctor and an Austr officer managed to escape. Some documents were also found. I hear that Ali Khan of Takht-i-Jan (see Diary of September 8th) left his home for Sistan on about the 30th August, ostensibly to attend a marriage, ho doult he has really gone on German service. Russian Affairs. (a) M. Roussian, the Sistan telegraphist, with wife and family, has reached Bir]and and passed on to Meshed. The visit of M Samsonoff to Birjand has proved a fiasco through no fault of the offiLrtmself. It appears, firstly, that Colonel Guschm has resented bavin' a political officer attached to his force, representmg the Meshed Russian n ria+o-fVnpral qnd secondlv that M. Romanovski, who is directly undei Tehran, has still more resented having another officer of his own servire and con- cirlprnblv ^enior to himself sent to Biriand from Meshed, apparently without or fom ^ Russian°Legation. In the Jesuit Colonel Guschin and M. Romanovski have combined to treat M. Samsonofi as a nonentity , and M. Romanovski, whe ever visiting the British Consulate in company with his confere, has assumed senior place. M. Samsonoff, in saying farewell to Colonel Dale and n y , separate interviews, aired his grievances very openly. He arranged with Colonel Dale that he should accompany Lieutenant Brown- low’s party 4 to Sehdeh, but he was unable to inform M. Romanovski of the fart as the latter went out to avoid seeing him off !

He expressed the intention of resigning, as he could no longer protect his country from foreign interference, but he will not resign while a dishonest penny is to be made. 1 ^ Persian Affairs .—I hear that prayers are now offered in the Shrine for the delivery of Khorassan from unbelievers, the reference being to parties of Germans. The mullas, like the officials, have been slow to take action. The “ democrats ” of the town are busily engaged in talk, but display no other activity. * • Russian Aff am.— Twelve officers and 45 men with 35 spare rifles and 240 boxes of small arms ammunition for the 1st Semirechia Cossacks have arrived in Meshed. The Russian Consul-General has demanded the arrest and punishment of seven robbers who unsuccessfully attempted to stop M. Samsonoff on his way to Kain. The Russian Consul-General has published a notice threatening with deporta tion any Russian subject who publishes or spreads baseless or disquieting rumours. The Russians are attempting to acquire some land in Bujnurd for military purposes. Fifty Cossacks, on their way from the frontier towards Kuchan and Meshed have turned aside to arrest Nasir Khan, head of a section of the Zafaranlu Kurds, whom they accuse of molesting two men in their service at Jirastan. The Russian frontier guard at Sarakhs, in taking steps to prevent Turkomans from driving their flocks into Persian territory, shot two Persians, one of whom died. Colonel Scouratt, Military Attache, left Turbat-i-Haidari for Birjand on August 7. It is reported that the Russians at Kuchan are searching the houses of the people for arms and confiscating all they find. German intrigues. — It is reported in Meshed that the Germans have arranged to raise 1,700 Bakhtiyaris and Kashkais and bring them to Tabas. c a; ieivsd on a. 3 - - :U I o vi. UiDiA.

The Karguzar of Meshed has reported the matter to Tehran for orders. Turbat-i-Haidari IVeics.—The arrival of the 1st Semirechia Cossacks at Turbat is reported. A traveller from Yezd reports that he saw at Dih Muhammad, on one road from Tabas to Turbat, and at Isfak and Bushxuya, Burs, Kurds, and Bakhto sowars to the number of 200, waiting for news of the German prty which had g to Kain The agent at Turbat-i-Haidari also has news of this party, whic to travel in two bodies, each containing two German officers, 50 or 60 sowars, mules and camels, and some servants.

Condition of the Country .—The whole country is disturbed. Salar Khan Baluch is plundering villages to the south of Turbat-i-Haidari, Rahmatufiah is raiding the country between Nishabur and Meshed, Mashallah has recently seized a caravan of 10 or 15 men with merchandise and threatens to put them all to death unless his child, who has been seized as a hostage in Meshed, is released. The Zushkis are still negotiating with the Governor-General for pardon for past crimes, and will probably obtain it, together with license to start afresh. The Governor-General has no object but to make money. He is said to be contemplating the reinstatement of the dismissed Chief of Police, who paid him more than the present incumbent of the post. T.

The opportunity was an excellent one for a complaint against forehmers and their influence, but neither the Russians nor the British weri mentS and one member of the society, who objected to the omission, was informed that the signatories could not be trusted not to report the matter to my colleague or to me Russian Affairs.—Russian subjects in Meshed are nervous at present and two providId lnV1 ^ ^ ^ ^ haVe aSked f ° r 8™^. wMdi cannot be Riza Khan of Tehran, who was employed in the German Legation there, was attempting to join the German parties in Tabas, but was arrested by the Russian Consul m Turbat-i-Haidari and sent to Meshed, where he has been imprisoned by my colleague. r J German Intrigues .— See last week’s diary. The Shirazi pilgrims, whose rifles were seized by the Cossacks, made a demonstration before the Governor-General on August 17th and asked for redress. They are not likely to gain much, for my colleague told me that the rifles w r ere packed in boxes and were therefore evidently not carried for self-defence. They also had a quantity of cartridges, which they admitted they were bringing to Meshed for sale and a quantity of burnt opium. According to a letter from Tabas the Germans are now avoiding that town and halting at Junkhar, a village four farsakhs from it. The litter, which is dated V- August 8th, says that three parties had arrived or were aboutr to arrive there. It is rumoured that a German party passed through Tun without detection, though the town was occupied by Russian Cossacks, but the truth of the report is doubtful. Turbat-i-Haidari News .— The Russian Consul has arrested and imprisoned Khwaja Ibrahim, an Armenian with whom Dr. Pugin stayed while he was in Turbat. A man who left Bushruyeh on August 4th reports having seen there 13 or 14 Germans with 280 sowars of whom 50 or 60 were Afghans. Among those was probably the party which crossed the Afghan frontier at Chah Rig. According to later information most of the Persian sowars are deserting the Germans. From a letter from Tun, dated August 8th it appears that a German officer, accompanied by the chief of the gendarmerie in Isfahan, passed through Tun on his way to Bush ruyeh. The Russian officers are engaging houses in Turbat-i-Haidari. The British Agent in Turbat-i-Haidari intercepted a letter from a German in Tun, signing himself R. K., to Prince Heinrich XXXI of Reuss, German Minister in Tehran. The contents of the letter have been circulated to those concerned.

He called upon my colleague the other day and assured him of his friendship and of his readiness to assist him and he wished to ca 1 upon me, but fortunately I was out of town. Sardar-i-Muazzam, lately Commander of the troops in Meshed and now a member of the Majlis, who married the Governor-General’s grand-daughter, has telegraphed to the Governor-General to say that he is trying to obtain for him the support of the German Legation. The Karguzar also appears to be less confident than formerly of his ability to retain his post. Persian Affairs. The democrats are busy circulating false rumours of a British defeat in southern Persia. Very little progress has been made towards a settlement of the dispute between the Taimuris and the Barbaris and the two tribes have had another fight at Dum-i-Bubah since the arrival of the Commander of the troops at Fariman. The latter has failed to arrest the leaders of the Barbaris and the Taimuris have burnt all the recently garnered corn of Haji Husain Agha, one of the leaders of the Barbaris. A newspaper entitled “ Agence-i-Press ” has recently been circulated in Meshed through the post office. There is nothing to show where it is published or printed, or who edits it. It is objectionable in tone. I have received the first two numbers. The news that the British and French troops and fleets have forced the Dardanelles is widely circulated in the town. The democrats disbelieve it. News having been received that, owing to an outbreak of cholera in Baku, quarantine had been established at Astara and Enzeli, a meeting of a sanitary committee was held in Meshed at the request of the Governor-General. The Agency Surgeon attended. One doctor has been sent to Bajgiran to inspect travellers crossing the frontier. Further steps are delayed pending the receipt of information as to what steps are being taken in Russia. Russian Affairs. —My colleague is calling for tenders for the supply of grain, fodder, bread and meat for the Russian troops. German Intrigues. —See last week’s diary. The Germans have apparently realized that a letter addressed to their Legation in Tehran has gone astray, and the Governor-General has instructed Nazim-i-Nizam, the military officer who was sent ostensibly to check the advance of German parties, to send letters from the Germans to Meshed by special sowar, as one letter dated August 2nd has been lost. It is rumoured in the town that one party of Germans has reached Kabul and has been well received. Turbat-i-Haidari News .—According to a letter from Bushruya, Russian troops are searching for arms in that village but have so far discovered only one Mauser and a few cartridges. Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam News.—The Ilbaigi of theKaudani Taimuris has returned to Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam, fearing lest he should be arrested by the Commander of the troops, who was sent out to settle the dispute between the Barbaris and the Taimuris, and has dismissed all his sowars except 100. Shaukat-ud-Daulah has also disarmed all his sowars except 100. The Ilbaigi also fears arrest at the instance of the Russians, as he has harboured Ottoman Turks. One of these guests accompanied him in his recent expedition against the Barbaris and was thrown from his horse and broke his leg. Kariz News.—Six Afghan deserters from Herat, who said that they had come to help the Taimuris against the Barbaris and came to Kariz, were sent by Haji Shuja-ul-Mulk to Kafir Kal’ah and handed over to the Afghan authorities. The tribesmen of Nurullah Khan Makui were compelled by the threats of id on 1915 IIhBIA foreign secretary 4 ^ m- I D2 Haii Shuja-ul-MuIk to release a caravan of Barbaris and Kurramis whom they had seized. Herat News—At the instance of the British Agent, the Governor has issued orders that no more Germans are to be allowed to cross the frontier and that the Turk and the Afghan who escaped from Kain are to be arrested and brought to Herat without being allowed to speak to any one on the way. I fear these orders come too late, Risaldar Yar Muhammad Khan reports that a party of 5 Kakuris and 5 Afghans with 56 camel loads of silk from Agha Rubat, were ordered to stop by a Russian officer on the frontier. The caravan stopped but the men fired on the Russians, one of whom was killed. Reinforcements were summoned and the Russians attacked the caravan, killing one man and wounding others. The remainder were then imprisoned and their camels and merchandise were seized. It is reported that the Turkomans in Russian Turkistan, after being threatened with banishment and confiscation of their property, have agreed to provide men for the frontier posts. Fifty-two officers and non-commissioned officers of the Herat garrison are said to have passed examinations in military subjects at Kabul, and to have obtained certificates, Barbaris and Afghans are said to be committing many highway robberies on the road between Herat and Kabul. The people of Mahallah Babaji, one of the quarters of Herat, complain bitterly of the lawlessness of the sepoys. Forty of them recently entered this quarter at night and began plundering. They wounded two men but five of the thieves were arrested. The thieves were rescued by other sepoys and taken to Naib Salar. The Governor has ordered the Kotwal to inquire into the case. The infantry on parade openly accused the Naib Salar of protecting the artillerymen, who are the thieves. News has just arrived that a German and a Musalman named Baraktullah have reached Herat with six sowars. They are being lodged in the Bagh-i-Shah and an escort has been sent out to meet a second party which is expected by way of Parah. The escort has 60 unloaded ponies and some provisions with it. The agent describes the people as crowding to see the strangers and kissing their hands. Two captains and 12 files have been placed in charge of the two men who have already arrived, and they are being well entertained. The agent says that he believes that the Governor knew beforehand of their approach but concealed it from him. The agent wishes to send his wife and family to Persia, fearing disturbances in Herat. Political Summary. Condition of Country.- —Some robbers have attacked a carriage near Bajgiran and robbed a traveller named Karbalai Yamut of property worth 150 tumans. Jamshidi robbers are raiding the villages of Sardar-i-Muazzam near Sarakhs, and Baluchis and Sistanis are preparing to attack one another in the same neighbourhood, T. W.

For instance a Solitary European miL 3 that day ° n ^ ° f th ® 14th ’ who told tlle Persia iis that he had riddenlOO M. Romanovski’s party were about 12 hours behind when the Germans crossed the frontier. Very considerable information about the constitution of the party was collected, and it is now known that there were six Germans in it of whom three are beheved to be Bitten, Fischer and Friederich. The rest of the party consisted of. (1) three Turks—a Pasha (also said to be a German in disguise), an officer named ‘Zjni Beg ’ ffi 1 ' 1 a , Kazl; Indi fl 1 Pri nces (3) six Afghans, including an Artillery officer named Mir Mast—this is presumably the Subedar deserter from hranee; (4) 60 Arab soldiers irom Baghdad; (5) a Persian named Asghar-zadeh lately Kais-i-Nazmieh at Tun. Fifty mules accompanied the party. On the 21st August news was brought into Birjand that the Germans had sent a small caravan of supplies from Tabas down to Naiband. M.

He is named Nasrullah, and he had accompanied a Doctor Beck (?) from Kermanshah. He has a mother-in-law in Birjand, in which place he had previously been serving a Russian Bank ^Manager. The Governor after hearing his statement, sent him to me for examination. He is now being kept in confinement, at my request, as he almost certainly is a spy. (3) One Ali Akbar Beg, late Tahvildar (Revenue Superintendent) of Sistan, where he used to serve Hisam-ud-Dauleh, has stated that the Germans came to his village Takteh-i-Jan near Surab and that he gave them four guides up to Yazdan. (4) Mr. Dormer s visit to Naiband has contributed some important information. It has been ascertained that small German parties have frequently passed through to Tabas, and, owing to the influence of Imad-ul-Mulk and his son Imad-ul- Mamalik, the people have become strong partisans of the Germans. It is also a fact that two Germans (one wounded) passed through Naiband en route to Kerman on about the 13th August. As only one is reported from Kerman to have reached there on the 23rd, it seems probable that the wounded man died in the But. The Rohat Column .—'The third detachment from Quetta, which should have followed the others into Sistan, has been diverted to Kacha, owing to a reduction of 24 Afridis at that post. I hear that these Afridis of the 19th Punjabis were being returned to Quetta on account of the generally unsatisfactory attitude of their tribe. They have proved the estimate about themselves to be correct by deserting into Afghanistan from Amalaf near Saindak. Afghan robbers .—A caravan of 50 camels was recently taking grain from Sistan to Duroh. There were 9 Durohis in charge with 6 Baluch camel-men. 20 Afghan horsemen suddenly appeared from across the border near Isparan, while some of the Durohis were lagging behind, and drove off the whole caravan. It is said that the Afghans were regular soldiers. The people of Duroh have petitioned Shaukat- ul-Mulk for permission to counterraid into Afghanistan. Hospital figures for the month of August 1915.

J German emissaries.—Little news has reached Birjand about the movements of Germans. I have heard to-day (28th August) from the Governor that news from Tabas has reached Khur to the effect that there are still three Germans with practically no armed followers, at Jaukhar, but I have also heard from my Kussian colleague that Cossack detachments are at both Tabas and Tun. The first mentioned report can therefore hardly be true. I hear from His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed that even the Russian Consul-General knows practically nothing about the disposition of the 700 Cossacks who are supposed to have occupied the country between Turbat-i-Haidari and Birjand. Colonel Gushchin and the Consul at Turbat apparently only report to Tehran and Ashkabad. It seems that practically the whole force must be m Turbat, Tun and Tabas. There appear to be only about 60 men between Birjand and Kain. Another party of 60 had gone from Gunabad as far east as Bamrud, but they are said to have been recalled to Turbat. ! I I have been hearing from various Persian sources during the week that the German Mission did not cross the frontier at Chah Rig, but at Yezdan, and that the main body stayed at the latter place three or four days, while a small party went on in advance. M. Romanovski’s pursuing force is said only to have gone as far as Surab, 20 miles north-east of Durukhsh, and if it had pushed on, it would have overtaken the Germans or would have driven them prematurely into Afghanistan. Mr. Dormer’s party has not yet returned to Birjand. I heard of its reaching Garmab and of its advancing towards Naiband. A party of about 150 men under Lieutenant-Colonel JDale, 19th Punjabis, left Sistan for Neh on the night of 20th August, with two machine guns. They reached Neh without incident on the 26th. Colonel Dale has complained against the Rais-i-Mc r diya of Neh for not helping in the matter of supplies. It seems that all the Revenue officers in Sistan and Kainat are pro-German in sympathies. Colonel Dale’s party is under orders to advance to Khusp, and Colonel Wikeley contemplates coming to Neh himself. The position in Sistan .—There is no change. Sardars Taj Muhammad Regi and Khuda Dad Khan are still hesitating to come in to Sistan, while expressing their great friendliness towards the Consulate. The head clerk of the Consulate has interviewed them at Khwaja Ahmed. Hisam-ud-Dauleh. —His Majesty’s Minister received a call from this young man on the 20th August. This fact disposes of the various rumours recently circulating about him. The Finance Department. — A new Agent, named Basir-us-Saltaneh, left Tehran on 27th August to relieve Ebtihaj-us-Sultan in Sistan. The latter’s widowed sister has just married the Deputy Governor of Sistan. His Majesty’s Minister has also informed me that Saiyid Mohsin Khan, the Agent at Birjand, will be relieved as soon as possible. This man was formerly employed in the German Legation, and though we have not been able to prove that he is still serving the Germans, his subordinates are all acting suspiciously. The Agent himself is most assiduous in collecting news about Russian and British movements, but we cannot discover that he sends away what he learns ! F. B.

As we repeat to one another the Karguzar’s conversations with us, his efforts in this direction have very little chance of success. He is unable to obtain from Tehran a settlement of the debt of 1,570 tumans incurred by him on account of the Austrian prisoners at Meshed. He has recently made an attempt to enter the recognized party assembly of the Moderates in Meshed, but I do not know with what success. I hear that the Karguzar has telegraphed to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs suggesting that a Persian subject should be authorized to take by force some land claimed by him from a British subject, but the report is not yet confirmed. . Secre£.—The Karguza^ has reported to Tehran that my colleague and I are strictly prohibiting the despatch of Persian troops against the German parties. T need not say that this is false. The local authorities never had any serious inten tion of sending troops against those parties and the Karguzar’s telegram is designed to absolve them from responsibility for their negligence. _ The Karguzar has also been reporting to Tehran the result of the fighting at Kain and the alleged excesses committed by the Russians there. The Karguzar called upon me to protest against the employment of Russian troops in Persia and to ask for my support for his protest. I assured him that he need expect nothing of the sort and that if I troubled the Russian authorities at all it would be to ask for more troops. The reasons which I gave him for this decision have probably hindered him from mentioning to me the entry of British Indian troops into Persia, of which he must have heard. He also wrote to me assuring me that it was unnecessary for me to employ Hazaras locally raised as British interests would be protected in all parts of Persia by Persian troops. I replied that as the local Persian troops had recently suffered two defeats at the hands of insignificant gangs of robbers I must be excused for doubting their ability to protect British interests against superior Persian troops commanded by German officers. Russian Troops and German Intrigues. —The 1st Semirechia Cossacks, 750 strong, under the command of Colonel Gushchin arrived in Meshed on Sunday, July 31st and. left in two parties for Tuybat-i-Haidari on August 4th and August 5th. There are complaints that some of the'Cossacks, while in Meshed, committed thefts. Between three and four hundred more Cossacks are expected in Meshed shortly. Pasha Khan and Rukn-ul-Islam, the German agents, have been sent in custody to Kalat-i-Nadiri. f The brigand Muhammad Kurshabadi has threatened to join the Germans in consequence of the non-payment of his allowance by Nayyir-ud-Daulah. I am informed that the Bakhtiyaris with the Germans are not members of any particular clan of Bakhtiyaris but independent members of the tribe under the influence of Zargham-us-Saltanah. M. Samsonoff, Assistant to the Russian Consul-General, left Meshed on the night of July 31st to join the Cossacks at Kain. See last week’s diary. Haj Mulla Ali, the Sufi Mulla arrested by Cossacks in Gunabad, has been released. A considerable supply of rifles was found in his house. From what I hear, the German agents have escaped from the Cossacks at Kain, but have lost their baggage. On August 1st a letter was received from the Governor of dTabas, arrival there of 12 Germans and 10 Austrians with about 200 sowars.

It is said that Muhammad has received 50 rifles from the Germans. Five highway robbers are busy between Shahin Kal’a and Naubahar on the yuc an road, and have lately made an unsuccessful attempt on the post carriage. There is trouble, likely to end in bloodshed, between Eiza, some Turks and the people ol JPersian Sarakhs. One Ishak Baig has lately attacked Abdul Husain Ilbaigi of Radkan. Abdul Husain took sanctuary with the Governor of Shirvan, but Ishak Baig captured six of his sowars. &amp; r The men of the Rais-ut Tujjar of Meshed and the villagers- of Sarvilayat in the Sabzavar district have been fighting and it seems that the fight will shortly be renewed. The Governor of Kuchan has sent for 100 sowars from Kuchan to help him in attacking Gifani robbers and the Rais-ut-Tujjar is likely to raise the Za’faranlu Kurds against him. The people of Fariman have attacked a caravan of Barbaris who were coming on pilgrimage to Meshed and who had cut some grass from the village lands for their donkeys. Two of the Barbaris were wounded and Saiyid Ahmad Ah Shah, the chief of the tribe, has in consequence carried off all the sheep from Fariman. T. W.

Persian Officials. cbi^r^^ir?! T *'“ n *'“ * i ' German Intrioues. I have informed my Colleague of the presence in Meshed of a Turkish nxisoner of war who escaped from Tiflis and of an Austrian prisoner Xi S 'SX Karguzar. He says he will arrest and deport them both. tne M , 3( ?; Pasha Khan and Rukn-ul Islam have been brought into Meshed. I hear that they were at first placed under arrest in their houses but have since been confined in the police prison. The Governor-General wishes, I believe to send them to Tehran. ’ Imad-ul-Mulk, Governor of Tabas, has written to his agent at Meshed, informing him that the Germans passing through Tabas have treated the people very well, which probably means that they are free with their money. I hear that the young Hoffmann is to be tried by court-martial in Russia. An arrival from Tabas reports that a party of Germans with Bakhtiyari sowars, probably that now at Kain, was there before he left and that they said that they were going on to Birjand. They had 20 mules which their muleteer said he had brought from Mesopotamia with loads from Baghdad. Two Germans, with a few Arabs and about 60 Bakhtiyari sowars, are now at Kain and I am expecting to hear of a collision between them and the Cossacks from Meshed. The Karguzar here has telegraphed to the Governor of Sistan ordering him to disarm the Germans and attempting to throw all responsibility on his shoulders, though the party travelled unmolested through Khorassan. Nazim-i-Nizam, the officer sent by the Governor-General, had orders to persuade the party to lay down their arms, and, if they refused to do so, to accompany them and report their move ments and intentions. The Russian troops sent against them have arrested and are sending to Meshed Haji Mulla Ali, son of the well-known Haji Mulla Sultan Ali of Gunabad, and are exercising a censorship over all letters at Jumain. M. de Beauvais, one of the assistants in the Russian Consulate-General, who was sent out with the Cossacks, has returned to Meshed without leave. Another party of four German officers, with 14 Persian sowars, passed through Tabas about six days ago. Persian Affairs. The Chief of Police is having trouble with the Governor-General, who expects gratifications on the scale on which they were given by the late Chief of Police. As the new man is more moderate in his demands he is also more moderate in his views of what he can afford to pay his superiors. It is to be hoped that he will not come to grief, for so far he is very efficient. The Governor-General has convened an informal municipal committee of 20 or 30 traders, mostly demorcats. The democrats are very active in holding meetings in Meshed at present, but I learn from one whom I employ to attend these if2 that it is generally admitted that any other sort of activity will be impossible so long as Russian troops remain m Persia. Turbat-i-Haidari News. I hear that a donkey-man who met the first German party on the road reports that they asked everybody they met for news of the brigand Muhammad ursh- badi. o„ 1 „ r l\han the Baluch, is still active and has recently carried off a flock of Sheep from the village of Salihabad. The Governor-General is vainly trying to arrange matters by telegraph. Herat News. It has been ascertained that all rumours regarding German agents are untrue. K.JaWi traders have been frequenting the barracks and talking to the troops fbout ^holy war, but the British Agent reported the traders to the Governor, who sent for them and presumably warned them. The auarrel between the Governor and the Naib Salar, Commander of the Troops, continues. Naib Salar abused the Governor’s orderlies and ordered them back to barracks, and the Governor is naturally angry. The Governor has been ordered to make good all deficiencies among the artil- lery horses. The relatives of the thief Samandar Alizai, who live in Persian territory have avenged his imprisonment by attacking the people of Ghunan, cutting oft the ear of one man, burning crops, cutting off the legs of some cattle and the ears and tails of some horses. Political Summary. Condition of Country.—The Shikari robbers have robbed a caravan between Chinaran and Naubahar and stolen 260 tumans from the travellers. Pour robbers have attacked the hamlet of Yakilabad near Meshed, where a British Indian subject keeps a coffee-shop. Khafi robbers have stolen a load of merchandise near Bushkhar in the Turbat district. Five men who went out to collect potash have been murdered near Bushkhar. Shirwan is in a very disturbed state. The Governor-General. I regret to say that relations between the Governor-General and myself are not so good as formerly. He has broken a promise which he made to me an ave been obliged to tell him that since I have found him to be untruthful 1 can regard him as my friend. T. W.

The letter was taken over bv’ Mr. New and was found to be written in a veiled code. The writer apparently reproached his correspondent for not giving him better information. 7 On the 8th August M. Samsonoff arrived in Kain attended by one Cossack. He at once announced that he bad come to enquire into grievances and to make redress where necessary. As all the Cossacks had however left Kain he could not complete his enquiry at once. He also informed the local authorities that a thousand Cossacks were shortly coming to the town and that every effort should be made to collect rations for them. This demand caused considerable consternation both in Kain and Birjand. The same evening the Governor called on me to protest against so large a force visiting one small town, and to express his opinion that trouble would result. On this, I told His Excellency that if there was any chance of a dis turbance he should proceed to Kain himself to prevent such an occurrence. I have heard no more on the subject! It seems probable, however, that this large force will not halt long at Kain, if it ever goes there. M. Samsonoff at once telegraphed to Turbat-i-Haidari for the arrest of Khwaja Ibrahim and Jaeger. He expressed his best thanks to Messrs. New and Hale for all the information they had collected and given him. He showed himself so desirous for their company, that Mr. New who had arranged to leave on the 9th, decided to stay one day longer at Kain. On the 12th August Messrs. New and Hale returned to Birjand without inci dent on the road. Five Cossacks from the party at Birjand reached Kain for M. Samsonoff escort on the 11th instant. The Rabat Column.— Colonel Dale and other officers accompanied by His Majesty’s Vice-Consul called on the Deputy Governor, Sistan, on the 6th August. The visit was returned on the 8th August.

The Deputy Governor affects to believe that the Sarhaddis will leave as soon as thev have bought their requirements of grain; of course their achieving even in defence of the embargo will lower the prestige of the local Government very much Personally I am inclined to suspect that it wall not be very easy to get nd of the Sarhaddis now that they diave joined forces with the Sistan Ba uchis who have suffered at the hands of Shaukat-ul-Mulk. (2) It is reported from Lutak that Sardar Khudadad Khan is about to tele graph a representation to Tehran asking to be released from the undertaking which he had given to Shaukat-ul-Mulk about restoring all the Kamat loot which his Sarhad relatives had carried off. ..i Tiauleh —A Balueh cousin of this Amir, named Habibullah, who had accompaMeSmat-u* (as he then was) to Tehran from Turbat-i-Haidan in 1913 arrived in Birjand on the 12th August.

On the 1st August my colleague told me that he proposed to visit Kain after obtaining the permission of his Legation, and he suggested that Mr. New or myself should accompany him. He informed me that he had spoken on the telephone with the Commander at Kain, who had assured him that the troops were quartered in the “ medresseh ” attached to the mosque and not in the mosque itself. (Later information shows that this reply was untrue.) On this, I verbally interviewed the Karguzar and the Finance Agent and told them that the two Vice-Consuls would go to Kain and put matters right there. On the 2nd August I heard from Meshed that Monsieur Samsonoff, Assistant to the Russian Consul-General, had started for Kain. M. Romanovski then said that he probably would not be allowed to go himself. Mr. New’s departure was accordingly postponed, but I thought it would be advantageous for him to meet M. Samsonoff. He accordingly started on the evening of the 4th August, accom panied by Mr. Hale of the Imperial Bank. These two gentlemen reached Kain on the night of the 6th August. M. Samsonoff was then at Khidri, one stage away. He had driven in a carriage from Meshed accompanied by only one Cossack. North of Gunabad he had been attacked by seven robbers at night-time. One robber he shot dead and after he and his orderly had blazed off 700 or 800 rounds in the dark at the rest, he was left alone. In the meanwhile, on the 4th August, the Cossacks all marched from Kain, one party escorting the confiscated loads towards Turbat-i-Haidari, and another going westwards in search of the Germans. No intimation of their intended move seems to have been given to M. Romanovski. I only heard of their departure on the 5th through the Persian telegraph clerk.

J ’ Persian Affairs.—See last week’s diary. The people at agitating for the execution of the murderess of the two girls. Kuchan are still German Intrigues.-See last week’s diary. A second detachment of Cossacks, 68 strong, was sent to Turbat-i-Haidari on the night of July 21st. The Russian Consul-General and the Military Attache have telegraphed for 500 more Cossacks, and it is hoped that they may arrive shortly. The intention is to despatch them southwards on arrival. It is reported that a German party has already reached Gunabad en route for Kain. The Governor-General and the Karguzar have formally objected to the employment of Cossacks in the interior of Persia and the former has said that there is no necessity for their employment, as he has taken the necessary steps to prevent the advance of German parties. What he has actually done is to send a notorious poltroon, one Nazim-i-Nizam, with a few sowars, to meet the Germans and to request them to lay down their arms and turn back. This officer will take very good care not to encounter any German party and the Governor-General has in fact sent him orders to remain for the present at Turbat-i-Haidari. The Governor- General’s assertion that he has taken all the steps necessary for checking the advance of German parties is belied by a long and querulous cypher telegram which he has sent to Tehran complaining that the Government, in failing to supply him with funds for the support of troops, has made it impossible for him to take any steps for the arrest or expulsion of armed bands of undesirable foreigners. He has been informed in reply that his complaints are a mere excuse and that he might at least have shown as much energy as the Governor of Shahrud. Both the Governor-General and the Karguzar have been sending telegrams to Tehran, for orders, with no result so far. M. Samsonoff, Secretary to my colleague, recently searched the house of Roelich, the Austrian dentist, who has gone to Tehran, leaving his Russian mistress in charge of his house here. I believe that nothing of much importance was found, but my colleague showed me a photograph of the Karguzar, the Commander of the Troops, and A’dal-ud-Daulah fraternizing with Roelich and a few Austrian officers who were recently interned here. The two German agents, Rukn-ul-Islam and Pasha Khan, are still detained at Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. It is very undesirable that they should remain there and the Governor-General gave me a letter for the Governor, directing that they should be sent to Meshed, which I caused to be delivered. The Governor-General also says that he has sent a special messenger to bring them to town, but I cannot be sure that he is telling the truth. These two men say that they are awaiting the arrival of a German party and Muhammad Azim, the chief of the Kaudani Taimuris, says that when such a party arrives he will have 12,000 men ready to join them. The Democrats in Meshed appear to be very well organized now and have an elaborate service of spies. They are said to have one agent at Tabas to movements of German parties, with whom they are in sympathy, fehahzada Hashim Mirza, who has lately arrived from Tehran, is one of their leaders. Ihe Moderates are also well organised, but I have not yet ascertained what they are working for. Shahzada Hashim Mirza believes that the German parties moving eastwards from Isfahan intend to wait at Tabas and recruit there until their number reaches three or four thousand.

Colonel Dale informs me that the Customs Mirza expressed his pleasure at the removal end pressed him to take away every other description of supply that was’awaitimr transport, at the same time. ° The German emissaries .— The number of Germans and Persian Sowars, stated in last week’s diary to have reached Kain, appears to have been exaggerated. The Germans were apparently two—one young, in command, and the other old. Thev had 45 or 50 Persian six Arab and two negro muleteers, five or six Ispa- hani camel-men and a few personal servants. The Persian Mirza Nurullah, wh o had come down from Meshed, was with them. They had engaged two Sistan is in Tabas as guides and the latter gave them information that I had spies in Kain looking out for them. My men were hidden in a loc ked room by the acting Deputy Governor, while the German party searched a shop in which they had teen staying Nurullah and the Sistanis arrived at about 1 a. m. They went out again at 1) a. m. and returned with seven Sowars, who tried to arrange for an Istikbal. At 2 p.m. the main body appeared with the Germans. Twenty mules laden with ammunition came in during the evening, and on the following day 25 camels, laden apparently with tents, arrived. On the 25th July the long-expected telegram for the Governor from the Minister of the Interior arrived. It was to the effect that he was to preserve strict neutrality ! On the 26th July the Governor conversed with Tehran for three hours on the telegraph. I understand that he pointed out that neutrality would mean that his province would be overrun by Russian and British troops as well as the Germans, and that he strongly objected to the entrance of the Russians. It is not very clear what recommendation he made, as he rejected my advice to send a force up to Kain, and at the same time he commenced interfering with my efforts to enlist men and to purchase rifles. In this connection I believe he was only inspired with a desire to keep one of the three contending forces as small as possible. He had previously declared his intention to forbid all Kainis from joining the Germans. At the same time he began to call in a number of armed contingents from outlying villages. On the 27th July I made a final appeal to the Governor to take strong action against the Germans and he said he would certainly decide on his course of action after one more reference to Tehran. He asked me to await his reply on the morn ing of the 29th. On the 28th July His Excellency had another long conversation with Tehran, this time with the Parliamentary members for Birjand and Sistan. On the 29th July His Excellency ordered a force of 100 infantry, 50 cavalry and 30 camel-riders to start for Kain. The force however did not leave, for want of transport! At 1 a m on the 30th July I was woke up by the Deputy Governor, who informed me that His Excellency had at last been ordered by the Foreign Minister to arrest the Germans and disarm their Sowars. At the same time His Excellency had heard that a force of Cossacks was within 16 miles of Kam and would doubtless have attacked the Germans before a force from Birj and could appear on the scene His Excellency was anxious to send his troops out if I would kindly lend them two mules, and if I could induce the Russian Vice-Consul to order the Cossacks not to attack the Germans! I replied that as this was impossible I thought the I'ecelvsd on 1 c p .&gt; ? &lt;,, r 'X Ibf 5 .vith ,;iDIA rOKEIG-1 '■-'-RCTAPY’S f.c;tcr. n. 3 62 Riv - and force should await further news, and be employed in arresting the Germans ® X y S hTuld vacate Kain and make for Birjand or the frontrer before the Russians arrived. . . On the 31st July we heard that the Russians had reached Kain at 3 A. M, They exchanged so me shots with the Germans over the gardens, and one Cossack wafwound a ed S At 6 a.m, the Germans ^-PP^^-kh^misTn” 6 % flew off in a balloon, but it is not known how the Bakhtyans went. The Russians unfortunately killed a harmless camel-driver servant of Shaukat- ul-Mulk They also arrested a relative of the Naib of Kam at Asadabad, 16 mi es 'rom Kain, anifthis man is also said to have been wounded or killed subsequently, along with his servant. Apparently all the transport animals of the Germans got away, but the heavy loads of arms and ammunition were left behind and have been captured. At noon on the 31st July 40 Cossacks, under two Lieutenants, arrived in Biriand They had ridden from Tun—100 miles—in 52 hours. By so doing they hive probably just missed the Germans, who are believed to be fleeing back towards Thfocis. German spies.-On the morning of the 30th July I arrested a Persian named Ali Akbar, who was known to be a German spy and who, I had learnt, had just received a telegram from the Head Clerk of the German Consulate, Ispahan ordering him to proceed to Kain. I had previously asked the Deputy Governor to arrest the man. The spy, Nurullah, who left Meshed on the 11th July, has been ascertained to have joined the Germans at Tabas and accompanied them to Kain. , . The Rabat Column.— This force of about 250 rifles, under Colonel Dale, crossed the frontier on the night of the 29th-30th July route to Sistan. I hear that the other officers with the force -comprise one Major (the Medical Officer) and two Captains. Afghan gun-runners—l hear that a caravan of 300 camels laden with arms and ammunition passed through Nasratabad-Sipeh on about the 20th July. They were said to be going to Farah. F. B.

The Russian Consul-General then asked the Chief of Police to arrest him but was told that he had disappeared.

T ey had evidently no information about the movements o£ these P art ' es , exc | e P t I we had given them. The Russian Consul-General told me that Colonel Kulikoff would bflble to send 100 Cossacks and two machine guns to Turbat-i-Haidari on the 17th. I suggested the advisability of sending one party to Khaf in case the party had left Tabas and one party to Tabas to disarm the party there or if it had left to intercept the other parties we know to be on the way. They said that they would go to Turbat-i-Haidari and from there it would be seen what action should be taken. The Russian Vice-Consul, 4 Russian officers and 117 Cossacks, with 2 machine guns, left for Turbat-i-Haidari last night. Political Summary.

Sistan and Kain Consulate Diary No. 30 1915. for the week ending the 24th July General. (J The Finance Department.— Veimismon for the export of 540 Jcharwars, Tabrizi (4,387 2 Indian maunds), of barley from Kob Malik Siah was received in Sistan on the 20th July 1915. The Officer Commanding, Robat Column, has arranged to remove it all on bis own camels in two or three trips. He intends to command the convoy in person and to take a sufficiently strong force with him to preclude the possibility of Sar- haddis intercepting it. The German emissaries.—Font Germans, 70 or 80 Bakhtiari Sowars, and two machine guns, recached Kain on the 24th July. Only half the Sowars actually entered the town with the Germans. The leader of the latter, whose name has not yet been communicated to me from Kain, demanded an Istikhal (which he does not seem to have received), and. announced that he was a Consul. The Deputy Governor of Kain is in Birjand. His temporary substitute seems to be the Telegraph Master, who is good enough to give me information occa sionally about the party. The German leader has informed him that he is posting Consuls at Birjand, Sistan and Herat! The Russians have sent 200 Cossacks to Turbat-i-Haidari and Gunabad with instructions to prevent the Germans from crossing into Afghanistan. The Germans have heard of their appearance and are apparently rather perturbed. It remains to be seen whether they will hurry towards the frontier or penetrate further into the British sphere. The attitude of the Governor of Birjand is not very satisfactory. He pro mised on the 21st July to lend me 25 rifles, but is now procrastinating about send ing them over. He has prevented Jowala Singh, the Indian trader, from buying in the bazar 50 rifles, which would have been hired to me, by suddenly seizing them himself, and he forestalls me in enlisting men, by requisitioning them to join his own force. This has happened in two places, Khur and Mud. It is possible that he honestly intends to maintain peace in his jurisdiction and hopes to prevent the British and Russians from coming to close grips with the Germans, but we have some mis givings on the subject. He continues to affirm that he has not received a single order from Tehran on the subject of the Germans—an almost incredible thing. Rumours about Afghanistan, etc .—My Russian Colleague continues to provide me with strange stories, by whom fabricated I cannot say : {i) that the Afghans have recently put into thorough order for gun traffic the road from Herat to Meshed : (ii) that a strong force of Afghans has assembled opposite Khaf, which is close to the border, for the purpose of welcoming the German visitors : (Hi) that Shaukat- ul-Mulk has already prepared a certain house for the Germans’ occupation in Birjand, and (iv) that the son of the Chief Mujtehid in Birjand has telegraphed a message of welcome to the arrivals at Kain. Afghan gun-runners .—See last week’s diary. I have learnt on good authority that the Afghans, who visited Girdi behaved with extraordinary moderation. They paid the Consulate shop-keeper for all supplies they obtained from his shop, and they only took the two Persian postal Sowars up to the vicinity of Bandar Kamalan as guides. The men returned in due course to Girdi. F. B. PRIDEAUX, Major, His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain. G. M, Pres?, Simla.— No. C 314 F. D.—19 8-15—28.—E.A.

The Russian subjects in Meshed have recently complained to my colleague of their insecurity in Khorassan. The son of the late Russian Tajir Basin has recently been killed by robbers and the troops lately sent out against the Zushki robbers have been plundering indiscriminately.

Npyyir-ud-Daulah has complied very quickly with my colleague’s demand for compensation for M. deSpira and Mme. Bijova. I hear that it has been proved that M. Romanovsky received through the late Russian Tajir Bashi bribes to the amount of 1,200 tumans, and that the matter has been reported to Petrograd. A clerk of the Russian Bank who, with a mamur from the Governor of Kuchan, was attempting to remove from a village named Aliabad a quantity of grain claimed by the Bank, has been very severely beaten by the villagers. The affair very nearly led to an attack on the village by Russian troops. • A complaint of encroachment by the Russian authorities on the frontier has been received from the Karguzar of Bujnurd.

Herat News.—Risaldar Yar Muhammad Khan reports a visit paid to him by a Russian officer at Chihil Dukhtaran. He says that the officer spoke optimis tically about the war and in reply to a question whether the garrison of Shaikh Junaid had been increased said that it had received an addition of four battalions and 1,000 Cossacks, all of whom were destined for Meshed, as the Persians were displaying sympathy with the Turks. Two Arabs, who profess to be beggars who have entered Afghanistan from India and have come to Herat] from Kandahar, have been arrested and are to be sent across the frontier into Persia. One of them is old and blind. The inhabitants of Ghurian, Ziyaratgah, and other villages have applied for a remission of a portion of the land revenue due by them, owing to the damage done by locusts. Political Summary. Condition of Country. —S&amp;e last week’s diary. Mirza Husain Khan, before attacking the village of Zushk, placed a detachment to guard a defile by which the robbers might escape. The robbers fled by this defile, but the detachment fled before them. An officer fell into the hands of the robbers, who returned and be sieged Mirza Husain Khan in Zushk. The Commander of the Troops, with 200 sowars and 3 guns, has now gone out against the robbers. He has obtained the release of the officer, Naib Abul Kasim. Mirza Husain Khan, before attacking Muhammad Zabihullah of Zushk, took the precaution of enlisting the services of another robber Ali J auzi. Kaka Shirazi, a well known robber who is now wanted for a murder and was recently harboured by Shuja-ut-Tauliya, an official of the Shrine, is said to have escaped into Russian territory.

Russian A ffairs. —(1) The visit of M. Romanovski to the Governor on the Shah’s Birthday has, I hope, slightly eased the tension between the two parties. His Excellency has told me that he will return the visit in uniform, though the drive of 8 miles is rather long for such occasions. (2) M. Romanovski on the 10th instant called on Mr. Vice-Consul New for the first time since his arrival this year in this neighbourhood. It was his third or fourth visit to the town. (3) It is rumoured that the Russian Commercial Agent has arranged to build a house for the Russian Vice-Consul at Farashan, about 4 miles outside the town. Hisam-ud-Dauleh. —This young nobleman has telegraphed to his maternal •uncle, Ali Akbar Khan Narui, to the effect that he is about to leave Tehran, and desiring that his uncle should take orders from Shaukat-ul-Mulk about the manage ment of his properties and interests. It appears that Hisam-ud-Dauleh may now be getting the Tabas appointment, and that he is becoming more inclined to trust in the friendliness of his paternal uncle. Passports. —I hear that the Persian Government have prohibited the grant of passports to their subjects for Kerbela on account of the prevalence of plague at Baghdad. Indigo. The Customs Department have announced that the export of indigo is prohibited during the period of the European war. The deputation of Germans towards Afghanistan. It seems that there are 14 Germans and Austrians in the first three parties, two of which passed Nain on the 6th July and one reached Kerman on the 4th July. There are also apparently 3 or 4 Indians with these parties. A fourth party, led by Herr Niedermayer and comprising 8 other Germans and Austrians, left Ispahan for Nain on July 6th. It seems most probable that the objective of these adyentureis is Sistan. The Governor tells me that he has as yet received no instructions whatever from Tehran about his attitude towards the Germans. The Nawaqil Tax in Sistan.-See Diary No. 24.

I have heard also from Duroh that the Zarakzais have been begging the Afghan authorities for permission to attack the ersians. It seems possible that both these developments are attempts to force a settlement between the Governor of Sistan and Kain and the tribe. The Newspaper “ STmUh-i-Sakib”—Th.is paper has published mother defamatory article against Shaukat-ul-Mulk. It ends up by accusing him of 1havL fled from Koh Malik Siah to Birjand by an unusual route. This charge I think was originally made by the Karguzar of Sistan, who has no personal knowledge of the country. * Murza Khurshid Khan.—This old man, who was Mustaufi to the late Hisam- ud-JJauleh and who is now serving the present Hisam in Tehran, is reported to have received the title of Mishkwat-i-Diwan. . The Karguzar of Sistan. This official has gone to Chakhansur in Afghan Sistan it is believed under instructions from Tehran. Possibly he has been ordered to see for himself the amount of unrest in that district. An affray at Khwaja Ahmed. —On the 28th June 20 cavalry sowars were sent out by the Deputy Governor of Sistan to arrest two Kadkhudas of the Murrai tribe who were believed to possess a number of animals looted from Kainat. A brother and a brother-in-law of Sardar Khudadad Khan attempted a rescue, with the result that the brother-in-law and a Government sowar were wounded—the first named was at first reported killed. Reinforcements were sent out from the town and five prisoners were taken in. Sardar Khudadad Khan threatened to raise the flag of jehad, and it was rumoured that 250 Sarhaddis under Taj Muhammad Reki and some Afghans under Gulab Gurgich had joined. According to a report just received, the Deputy Governor had sent a Kadkhuda named Mir Ali Akbar Kalantar to negotiate with Khudadad Khan and the result has been satisfactory.

Colonel Popoff, the Russian Commandant at Kariz is at present m Meshed on a short visit He states that all sorts of wild rumours are current on the frontier but evidently does not anticipate any trouble, as he has left his wife and child there. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has again wired to the Karguzar to find out what punishment the murderer of Hoffmann received. It is reported that a Russian Officer visited Badjiran and made inquiries about Persians collecting arms. f ^ is said that Haji Abdulla Khan, a Turkish spy, has been turned out of Kafir Killa by order of the Naib-i-Hukamat. He went towards Khaf but his exact whereabouts is not known. See Diary No. 23. The Herat merchants have, so far, only been able to get 500 tumans out of the 1,350 tumans cash confiscated, as that amount was in Kabul money. Herat News .—The dispute between the Naib-ul-Hukamat and the Naib Salar continues. The latter paid a visit to the Naib-ul-Hukamat at Chahar Bagh and abused him and his clerks in the presence of his servants and some Khans and made a scene. On leaving, the Naib Salar swore that he would not come again to the Chahar Bagh until he got orders from the Amir to imprison the Naib-ul-Hukamat and send him bound to Kabul. Some murders and robberies have been committed by soldiers but the Naib Salar has refused to believe the stories or to investigate the cases. Naib Salar has pulled down the Winter quarters in the Ark and is starting to build new ones, the cost of which is estimated at 7,000 tumans. It is reported from Sheikh Juneid that four Russian regiments have arrived there and are going to be sent to Meshed. ! Risaldar Yar Muhammad Khan reports from the frontier that a Russian regi ment was moved out to Kara Tappa for one night and 300 Cossacks went to Chihil Dukhtaran but returned after two nights to Sheikh Juneid. A suspicious character, who had entered Afghanistan from Russian territory, was arrested and sent to Herat. The Naib-ul-Hukamat ordered that he should be sent to Persia. : Miscellaneous .—Considerable damage has been done to the crops by hail-storms in the Kuchan, Shirwan, Dizab, Safid Sang, Kafir Killa and Turbat-i-Haidari districts.

Political Summary. CmdUion oj the country.-Tte various gangs of robbers have been most active s f' b s!S3 L thev cut off his ears. On Tuesday they murdered the son of Haji Majid a forme/Russian TajirhasU, at Hauderrah, about eight miles from Mes e . M NTcolskv protested strongly, tbe Governor-General has, at last sent out 120 sowars under Mirza Husain, late Rais-i-Gendarmene, who was recently dismissed bv M Kornelis, to try and catch the gang. If Mirza Husain is successful, the Governor-General has promised to make him Governor of Ku aiya j There has been a split in Muhammad Zabihullah’s gang, as one Ustad Husain murdered another of the gang and his mother. The latter was a relation of Muham- mad Zabihullah. A follower of Muhammad Karashabadi has murdered one Gulam of Kharv. Haii Muhammad Husain, Turkbehi, is in an awkward position, because Ah Jauzib demanding shoes, etc., from him, while, Muhammad Zabihullah, with the rival gang of about 65, proposes paying bim a visit. The Russian Cossacks have gone out from Kuchan to try and 6'^ the robbera who murdered the Russian soldier reported m Diary No. 24. The Governor of Kucban has also gone to investigate the matter. Condition of the romfo—The road near Iman Kuli has been carried away by a big flood after three days’ continuous ram. The caravansarais at Iman Kuh and A Agha were destroyed, 65 camels, 2 carriages, 70 tins of kerosme oil and 12 loads of sugar were washed away and three men drowned. 3 The post carriage was again attacked on the Kuchan road between Nan Bahar and Muhammadabad, but as there were three Russian Cossacks m the carnage, the robbers were driven ofl. At Tas Tappe, also on the Kuchan road, there is another party of robbers. When M. de Spira, assistant in the Russian Bank, and Madam Bijoff, the widow of the late M Bijofi of the Russian Bank, who left last week for Ashkahad with her children, were driving between Imam Kuli and Darbadam, they saw the body of a murdered man. M. de Spira got down to examine it and suddenly three sowars appeared and demanded all their money and valuables. They took cash and jewellery to the value of about 800 roubles. The War. —M. Nicolsky has printed and circulated a statement that the various rumours reported last week are not true. Ail the Austrian prisoners have now left Meshed for Tehran. The Russian Consul-General changed his mind several times about the _ advisability of lettmg them go; eventually, however, he stated that the Russian Minister had ^ ia . e satisfactory arrangements with the Persian Government for their safe custo y m Tehran and that he was not going to oppose their departure from here. A few days ago we heard that a servant of the notorious Dr. Pujin had arrived in Meshed and that his master was expected shortly. This news fits m witti tne report that German secret agents have left Isfahan. The Russian Consul-Genera telegraphing to the Russian Minister in Tehran to ask (i) that he may be s °PP e coming to this frontier, or (ii) if that is not possible, to be allowed to arrest him er H.

Diary No. 23. I hear from Sistan that the Customs Department are now permitting the export of supplies, except wheat and barley, to Kacha. Quantities of ghee, hah (chopped straw), and sheep and goats for slaughter have been allowed to leave Koh Malik Siah. I have telegraphed again to Tehran about the grain, which is urgently needed at Kacha. Afghan Robbers. —See Diary No. 23. The rumour about the Zarakzais resum ing their raids seems to have been manufactured with a view to forcing the Persian authorities into compromising with them. I hear now that the Zarakzais have petitioned the Governor, through his Deputy at Sistan, for pardon and permission to return to Persia, as they are having a hard time in Chakhansur. Birjand News.—(l) See Diary No. 2 of 1915, under head “ Finance Depart ment, Birjand.” The attempt to abolish the local Kaini weights has been un popular and has not been strictly enforced hitherto. A new proclamation has been issued by the Governor insisting on the exclusive use of Tabriz weights. (2) The Honorary Kais-i-Adlieh, Agha Mir Muhammad Husain, has been ordered from Tehran to proceed on transfer to Turbat-i-Haidari. The War. —See last week’s Diary, item (3).

The daily news-sheet formerly published by this department has been suppressed and Salar-i-Nusrat has sent for newspaper editors and warned them against publishing comments on the war and the attitude of Persia towards it. Persian Affairs.—ThQ Governor-General has directed that all Municipal Pf 10 ™ • shall submit their reports regarding prices current to him instead of to tne Gmet of Police. This will considerably reduce the perquisites of the latter. A small party, headed by the Aghazada, is protesting against the retention of JNayyir-ud-Daulah as Governor-General. They accuse him of having deliberately fomented the late agitation for the purpose of strengthening his position. A Mulla named Abdur Rahim Mudarris has'been murdered. As he bore some resemblance to Aghazada and was shot near Aghazada’s house it was at first be lieved that he had been killed by Bahais in revenge for the death of Shaikh Ali Akbar, but it appears that he was shot by one Muhammad Daghistani, a Russian subject’ at the instigation of Abdul Jawad Charakduz, a Russian pcotege, who had a quarrel with the deceased regarding some endowment land. It is said that the Mullas intend to agitate for the punishment of the murderer. Russian Affairs. —A squadron of the 2nd Semirechia Cossacks arrived in Meshed on June 5th to replace the squadron which lately left for Kuchan. It is reported in the town that the Russian Government has prohibited the export of tea, sugar, matches, and candles to Persia. This may be merely a trick of the merchants in Meshed or it may be Russia’s answer to the Persian prohibition of the export of grain and food-stuffs. A Russian subject named Mahmud has been importing rifles into Meshed from Tehran. Twelve rifles have been seized by the Persian police and handed over to my Colleague. It is reported from Sarakhs that the Russian officials in that district are storii^— the remainder of last year’s grain supply and are purchasing this year’s supply m advance. Herat News .—Naib Salar has arrested a sepoy of one regiment on a charge of supplying information to the Russians through his two sons. The sepoy has been handed over to the Kotwal, who has also been ordered to arrest his two sons, who have absconded. A sdwar who has recently returned to Herat from the frontier reports that, in consequence of a rumour that the Afghans were preparing to attack the Russians, 111 V; \. . jseived on 9 MUGi915 .vith INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter.

This report ts inconsistent with Risaldar Yar Muhammad Khan’s complamts of the overbearing behaviour of the Russian frontier gurads, of their frequent violations of Afghan territory, and of their treatment of Afghan frontier guards who inadvertently cross the frontier, » Political Summary. Condition of Country.—The Zushki robbers are still unpunished. I am not very sanguine of persuading the Governor-General to take decisive steps as I learn Ihat he has recently receivld from Muhammad Zabihullah their leader a present of a mule laden with butter. Ali Jauzi, the rival of Muhammad Zabihullah, has captured one of the latter’s men and has also robbed a caravan leaving Meshed for Gulmakan and Isgil. See Diary No. 23. The Kharvis who carried a kidnapped girl to Zushk were expelled by the Zushkis and forced to return to Kharv, where they were attacked by the people, who killed one of them and sent his head to Nishabur. It is reported that a Russian soldier has been killed near Bajgiran while attempting to seize rifles from some men who were shooting in the lulls A searcli ifbeTng instituted and it seems likely that somebody will suffer for the death of the Russian. Condition of Roads. -Robberies have recently been committed on the main road between Kuchan and Meshed. A carriage was attacked by the robbers and 100 tumans were taken from the passengers. A house was robbed _ at Sayyidaba near Chinaran and 100 tumans were taken. The roads m the neighbourhood of Meshed are also insecure. Some Persian sowars stopped a carriage just outside the city and made indecent proposals to the ladies whom it contained. These belonged to the family of Haji Husain Agha, a Russian protege The post sowar of Abdullah Khan, the Afghan commercial agent, has been robbed at a distance of one farsakh from the town. The War .—The townspeople are again busy with rumours. The latest is that the Russian Minister has been assassinated in Tehran, that the Persian Cossacks under Russian officers, have bombarded the Turkish Embassy and the German and Austrian Legations, and that the Gendarmerie are attacking the Cossacks. Warsaw also has once more been taken by the Germans and the Amir o Afghanistan is ready to lead 40,000 cavalry to the assistance of the Sultan of Turkey. My Colleague is said to have demanded the punishment of people spreadmg such rumours, and to have been informed in reply that they are traceable to Russian subjects. The Karguzar is now sending the Austrian prisoners here to Tehran in batches of 12 or 15. I am not sure whether this is desirable and have inquired. T. W. HAIG, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorassan- G. M. Press, Simla.—No. C-231 F. D.—15-7-15.—28.—B.A.Dated 16 JUL1915 CONFIDENTIAL. 2896 Sistan and Kain Consulate Diary No. 25, for the week ending the 19th June Russian 4if &lt;wr ' s --—Although my colleague, M. Romanovski, reached his summer residence at Saidabad on the 10th instant, he has up to now only paid one flying visit to Birjand, on the afternoon of the 14th, when he called on the Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia. I believe he would have called on Mr. Vice-Consul New and myself the same afternoon, had he not learnt that we were playing tennis at the Governor’s residence. As he did not come within three miles of my residence I can hardly regard his intention as equivalent to an actual call, though he sent out a letter from Mrs. Romanovski for Mrs. Prideaux through the British Vice- Consulate in town. He has held no communication with the Governor since his arrival here. Of course formal calls between the Governor and the two Consuls are not necessary when we all migrate from Sistan to Kainat and vice versa twice a year at about the same time, but the continued display of unfriendliness for the Governor, evinced in this disregard of his existence, is as ridiculous as it is futile. The Karguzar of Sistan .—This worthy, as was to be expected from his antece dents, is making mischief. He has reported to Tehran that Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s trip to Koh Malik Siah has wasted 100,000 Tomans. This report has been passed on to Ebtihaj-us-Sultan, the Finance Agent in Sistan, for his opinion. As the latter is very jealous of the Governor, it is to be feared that he will support the Karguzar’s view. As a matter of fact, it was the Finance Agent’s opposition to the expedition and his dilatoriness in paying the troops which largely contributed to the apparent abortiveness of the measures undertaken. At the same time, it must be urged that the appearance of so large and well armed a force on the border of Sarhad impressed the Baluchis very deeply, and so far they have committed no fresh raids though they are undoubtedly suffering from lack of food this year. The War. —(1) Copies of a declaration of Jehad have reached various mullas in Sistan, and Imam-i-Juma, who resides in the fanatical village of Bunjar, read out the paper from the pulpit before the Rais-i-Nazmieh was able to prevent him. A number of copies have since been collected and sent up to Birjand by the Deputy Governor, but the mullas have kept copies, it is believed. The Saiyids of Bunjar are said to be in an excited state, but they have been threatened with arrest if any disturbance is made. (2) It is rumoured amongst the Afghans in Sistan that the Chakhansur authorities have received a farman from Kabul announcing that 12,000 troops are being sent to Meshed from Herat, Kandahar and Kabul to plant the Afghan flag and end the mischief going on there ! Agent Wagner Paschen, who left Isfahan, presumably for some part of Afghanistan, on June 16th with his 8 Austrian soldiers, 32 Isfahani sowars, machine gun and stock of arms and ammunition. His Excellency has promised to refer to e ran for orders as to how he should deal with the party if they come into his Province. Locusts .—These are now all over the Birjand valley in different stages of growth. It seems probable that they will consume all the grazing of Kamat besides strinning the fruit trees of their leaves. # 1915. General. arrangement.

Although Mirza Hashim has left Meshed, his paper, the Vatcm, continues to appear, and is rather more venomous than formerly. The present editor is Murtaza Mirza who was dismissed from the government of Gunabad, but suffered no other punishment, for murder. The Austrian prisoners here, about 70 in number, find time hanging heavy on their hands and are clamouring to be sent to Tehran. One of them died of typhoid fever the other day, and I hear that another is suffering from the same sickness. Considering that the disease is rife in the city and that the prisoners indulge freely in bazar ices and other delicacies of doubtful quality, they are for tunate to have escaped so lightly hitherto. There are reports of a few more prisoners having escaped from Sarakhs. Russian Affairs. —It is said that the Kussian Government has prohibited the exportation of leather and some consignments have been stopped at Bajgiran. It is reported that 420 men of the 2nd Semirechia Cossacks have left Ashkabad for Persia. Some will be posted to Meshed to relieve the squadron which lately left for Kuchan and the rest will be stationed at Kuchan and on the road between Meshed and the frontier. The Russian Consul at Turbat-i-Haidari is still opposing the return of Shaukat- us-Saltanah to Khaf, but the latter is trying to settle the matter here by bribing the Governor-General, the Karguzar, and Arfa-ul-Mamalik, head mirza in the Russian Consulate-General. There is a dispute between the Russian Consul-General, and the Postmaster General. The latter, with the approval of the Russian Legation in Tehran, recently took possession of all the carriages on the post-road to Tehran which had been in the hands of Meshedi Husain, the Russian contractor, and now refuses to return them to Meshedi Husain, although the Russian Legation has rescinded its former order. M. Nicolsky threatens to send Cossacks to seize the carriages and the Postmaster-General has asked for a delay of five days to enable him to obtain orders from Tehran. British Affairs. —The Persian and Russian officials attended the usual garden party at the Consulate-General on June 3rd, the King’s Birthday, and the badges of the titles Khan Bahadur and Khan Sahib were conferred upon Saiyid Mubarak Received on 4 AUG 1915 /ith INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter.

The Russian agent at Turshiz has been very severely beaten and the Karguzar of Turbat has gone to Turshiz to inquire into the matter. Kariz News —The exportation of specie from Persia is prohibited and 1,350 tumansin cash ' have been recently confiscated from a caravan which was going from Meshed to Herat. The Customs officials on the frontier are less particular in respect of other goods and let them pass in consideration of small bribes.

Naib Salar has received orders from Kabul to collect from the Khaki Regiment blood money for one Muhammad Hanif, who was murdered in the barracks of that regiment, but he and his officers are afraid to execute the order as they fear a mutiny of the regiment. j Political Summary. Condition of Country. —Turkomans are said to have raided the Ramian and Findarisk district, between Astarabad and Jajarm, but were deterred from advancing towards Shirvan by the activity of Nasrullah Khan, the Governor ’s brother Rumours of an intended Turkoman raid have, however, encouraged the bad characters of Miandasht, between Sabzawar and Bustan, and they are creating trouble on the Tehran road. A gang of robbers has plundered a caravan near Sarakhs. The Zushki robbers are still giving trouble. The Governor-General says that he is trying to bring the leaders of the two hostile sections of this gang to terms and that if he fails he will send troops against them. He has ordered Muhammad Zabihullah, the leader of one of the gangs, to arrest Hasan, the murderer of Mulla Ali Akhbar Dihbari, but Zabihullah is taking advantage of these orders to plunder villages on the pretext that they have harboured the murderer. In the meantime the robbers are preparing their defences in the hills in case of an attack. The Governor-General is not likely to attack them, as he has been hopeless since his surrender to Muhammad Kurshabadi. His sole idea of dealing with robbers is to get them to enter into an agreement to rob no more, which they are always ready to do. In the meantime the troops paid by the Persian Government drill in the square of the citadel and vainly attempt to keep step to the discordant music of their bands. A gang of twelve robbers^ is active on the road between Nishabur and Sabzawar. A gang of robbers has kidnapped a girl from a village near Nishabur and carried her to Zushk. The Zushki robbers have been plundering villages in the hills near Jaghark. A man and his son, travelling from Yezd to Meshed, were robbed and murdered in a village near Turshiz. The Governor took from the murderers two asses of theirs as well as two which had belonged to the murdered man, and let the murderers go. The war. —Interest in the war is not very lively. There has been some talk of a daily sheet to publish news to be supplied from the German Legation at Terhan, but it has not appeared yet. T. W.

They tell of an old woman who has been attacked and severely bitten while driving the insects away ! I hear that locusts have also appeared in the south of Sistan. The War. —I have seen a printed copy of a Notification Extraordinary (styled “ Watan ”) issued by the Turkish Embassy in Tehran, assuring the people of Persia that the Turks have only invaded their country in order to drive the Russians and British out, and that they have no intention of annexing any portion of Persia.

A sepoy recently arrived from Kabul reports that the Amir has sent a General Officer, with four companies of infantry, to Kandahar, and that four battalions were leaving Kabul for Afghan Turkistan. The Naib Salar has asked for the Governor’s ^instructions regarding two Turkish emissaries who, he said, had arrived at Kafir Kal’ah. The Governor said that he had not heard of them but that the Amir s orders in such cases were that the men should not be allowed to cross the border until their papers had been seen by him at Kabul. The Naib Salar’s information probably relates to Pasha Khan and Rukn-ul-Islam, whose papers will not reach Kabul. Gangs of thieves have recently raided three villages near Herat and in one case, in which the thieves were repulsed with the loss of one man killed, it was ascer tained that the gang was composed of sepoys. In the other two cases the thieves were more successful. Political Summary. ^ Condition of the Country .—See Diary No. 20.

I understand that the squadron now at Kuchan will be transferred to Ashkabad and that a squadron from Ashkabad will replace the squadron which has left Meshed. The 2nd Semirechia Cossacks paraded in the square of the citadel on May if on th® occasion of the anniversary of the ^Tsar’s coronation. The tent in which the priest officiated was decorated with the flags of all the Allies, including Italy, and at the close of the service the Commanding Officer called for cheers for the Allies, singly. Kariz News .—Locusts from the direction of Afghanistan have attacked the crops in the villages in the Kariz district. 1 Haji Abdullah, an Ottoman subject, and his muleteer, Maksud, are detained by the Afghan authorities in Kafir KaTah. A consignment of 600 rifles has recently been smuggled into Afghanistan by way of Jamrud. I am considering measures for the prevention of this traffic. Herat News ,—Risaldar Yar Muhammad Khan has been meeting a Russian Staff Officer near Chihil Dukhtaran. They discussed various fiontier questions and also the war. The Risaldar proposed that an Afghan officer should be permitted to accompany one of the Russian armies in the | field and the Russian replied that application would have to be made by the Afghan Government. Fourteen families from Surkh Kaman in Persia have crossed into Afghanistan and are being settled at Gulran. There is a good deal of foolish talk in Herat about the war, for much of which Naib Salar, the commander of the troops, seems to be responsible. He harangues his troops on parade, telling them that he will soon be leading them against the Russians, and says much to the same effect in his darbar. He recently approach ed the Governor on behalf of Haji Abdullah and Maksud, and tried to obtain from him written orders regarding them, but was informed that he had already been told that the Amir’s orders were awaited. Rumours, of warlike preparations by the Amir, which are prevalent in Herat, are probably circulated by him. The Governor of Kadis and Langar has sent three Hazaras, a father and two sons, into Herat in chains. They are accused of being Russian spies. The Naib Salar is continuing his intrigues against the Governor of Herat. Political Summary. Condition of Country. -The Shikari robbers are still active.

His Mirza in Sistan, named Muhammad Ali, was arrested on the 23rd instant by order of Shaukat-ul-Mulk and is being taken to Birjand by two Jambazes. 1 have not yet learnt of what he is accused—possibly sharing with the Baluch raiders m Kainat loot. I expect that Sardar Purdil Khan may have made some revelations. Russian Affairs. —(1) The Dispensary Doctor (Felchar) at Birjand left for Turbat-i-Haidari on the 26th instant. He is sending his family back to Russia, but returns himself in a month’s time. Three Cossacks accompany his party. (2) The Russian Vice-Consukte|party have not yet left Sistan for Birjand, but are said to be packing up. TKyBvill probably find the first half of the journey very trying on account of the heat if they delay much longer. The lack of cara vanserais and trees between Lab-i-Baring and Shusp enhances the discomforts of the journey very greatly. Afghan News. —(1) From Duroh I hear that the Afghan Military Customs posts along the border have been reduced from 14 to 7 men each. The extra men have been recalled to Herat. (2) A subordinate of the Deputy Governor, Birjand, has recently returned from Herat. He reports that there is no mobilization of troops there and that all is quiet. F. B.

I visited him there, and on the 22nd May he rode in to Shusp and lunched with me. His carriage caught him up here, coming direct from Sistan, but His Excellency means to ride the whole way to Birjand across the hills and through the Gib-Muktaran valley. He will stop at one or two shrines on the way. The Deputy Governor of /Shsto.—Sartip Muhammad Reza Khan, nephew of the Governor, returned to Sistan on the 16th instant. He seems to have appreciated the permission to occupy our rest-houses at Girdi and Lutak when passing through. Suspicious travellers. —A Tunisian Arab—French subject—named Sharif Halil &gt; about whose journey I had been forewarned from Quetta, reached Koh Malik Siah with two women and two children on the 11th instant. He left for Sistan on the 13th. The War. —Some days before my departure from Sistan the Russian Vice- Consul told me that he had heard from Birjand that 40 Turks had arrived there in disguise, that a few days later they had mysteriously disappeared and that they were next heard of in Afghanistan, also that amongst the Turks were 3 Germans. I instituted enquiries and can only discover that some 40 Afghan pilgrims passed through Birjand and Awaz last March, a few of whom carried letters from a Turkish officer at Baghdad for people in Herat. Russian Affairs. —At Birjand a dispute over wakf property between a shop keeper and a Persian servant of the Russian Felchar (dispensary doctor) was settled by the chief Mujtahid in favour of the former. The Felchar then unceremoniously called on the Deputy Governor and insisted on the case being settled in his servant’s favour. I have not heard how the matter ended. The Finance Department. —The Finance Agent in Sistan has informed His Majesty’s Vice-Consul that orders have recently been passed by the Persian Gov ernment to the effect that his Department must not correspond with the Consulate except through the Karguzari. This order can hardly apply to Customs matters. Locusts. —This pest has been noticed in enormous numbers all the way from Bandan to Shusp. The insects are still in the crawling stage. State of the Roads. —Four Afghan Brahui robbers on the 20th instant captured near Hauzdar a drove of donkeys carrying flour to Robat for the Kacha contractors. The local authorities have been pressed to recover the looted animals and their loads. The Governor of Sistan and Kain, at my request, telegraphed from Shusp on the 22nd instant to his Deputy at Sistan that, jf the property is not restored, the road-guard jambazes will have to make good the contractors’ loss.

He will not enter the Sistan Oasis but marches direct for the south-western shore of the Hamun which he expects to reach on the 16th Sardar Khudadad Khan, I hear, accompanieshim sofar, and from there will be allowed to return to his home in Sistan, toS Lab-i- Baring. He has given a written undertaking to pay up a considerable sum of money m a few months time as the share of loot which his tribesmen have taken from Kamat. Sardar Purdil Khan is being taken to Birjand under an escort of twentv- lour sowars. He is allowed only one servant and is being strictly treated Sardar Khan Jehan Khan became very ill in Koh Malik Siah and was left behind there He is hardly expected to reach home alive. The Deputy Governor of Sistan, Sartip Muhammad Reza Khan, is returnimr to Sistan by the direct route. 6 The Governor talks of returning to Si^tan next autumn. Mr. Lovell left Koh Malik Siah on the evening of the 10th instant, as soon as he learnt that His Excellency had made arrangements for returning to Birjand. He reached Sistan on the 12th instant, having done the journey in forty-one hours. His services in Koh Malik Siah have been much appreciated both by the Governor and myself. J On the eve of the Governor’s departure an unfortunate incident occurred at the Ziarat well, a Bahluri soldier being shot dead by two Baluchis. The soldier’s companion fled back to camp, and the Baluchis went off with the murdered man’s rifle, accoutrements and uniform. Their footmarks were traced the following morning into British territory. It is not known whether the crime was committed in revenge for the slaughter of the fakir's brother or of some other victim of Sahib Jam. ¥ Baluch raiders. —(1) I hear that the Governor arrested Amal Khan, son of Gulzar, a cousin of the late Sardar Pasand Khan, and Aibu, the notorious robber (see Diary No. 6 of 1915), before leaving Koh Malik Siah. Apparently both these men were in the entourage of Sardar Purdil Khan. (2) I hear from Quetta that a large band of Damanis from Sarhad (presumably Mir Jehind’s men) raided at the end of last month into British territory as far east as Sorap, south of Dalbandin, and carried off 200 camels, the property of the Note- zai tribe. The name of the raiders’ leader is believed to be Allah Hasan. Shaukat- ul-Mulk of course is unable to compel Jehind to restore the animals. It seems that the Sarhaddis are deliberately inviting the British and Persian Governments to take joint action against them. , S JUUS% [ India, FoRii^n I Mo dated x V d U ;« 1 d IG. U.

The Minister of the Interior apparently wishes to force the Governor-General p acce P t Sbahnat-us-Saltanah, formerly Chief of Police at Tabriz, as Chief of Police at Meshed, and Sardar-i-Muazzam, lately Commander of the troops in Khorasan and now a member of the Majlis, is supporting the candidature of this man. M. Collard, recently Provincial Director of Customs, left Meshed for Europe on the morning of May 14th. A very scurrilous anonymous leaflet, directed against M. Collard and M. Kornelis, has been circulated. Russian Affairs. M. Nicolsky, who has hitherto been Acting Russian Consul-General in Khorasan has been confirmed in the appointment. I A 1 . Samsonoff, the new Secretary to the Russian Consulate-General arrived m Meshed from Ashkabad on May 7th. He was accompanied by his wife. Husain Bala, murderer of one Aliofi, recently returned to Meshed and was accorded a reception by some ruffianly Russian subjects, but my colleague arrested the man and sent him back to Ashkabad, and fined those who had gone out to receive him 10 roubles each. See my Diary No. 19. Shaukat-us-Saltanah has arrived in Meshed from Khaf and my colleague has demanded of the Governor-General the settlement of the claims preferred against him by the people of Khaf now in refuge in the Russian Consulate at Turbat-i-Haidari. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs has telegraphed to the Karguzar saying that he understands from, the Minister of the Interior that nobody has any just cause of complaint against Shaukat-us-Saltanah and requesting the Karguzar to ascertain why the Russian Consul at Turbat interfered in the matter. Austran Prisoners. The number of fugitive prisoners in Meshed now amounts to 67 and I hear that 20 more have escaped from Sarakhs, and 10 Austrians and one Azarbaijani who was a prisoner of war with the Russians have found their way to Sabzawar. Among the prisoners here there are said to be eight Germans, viz., a captain, an apothecary, and six privates. There has been some trouble at Sarakhs in connection with the escape of prisoners. The Commandant of Russian Sarakhs interrupted traffic j by arresting all the boatmen on the charge of aiding fugitive prisoners in escaping, but he has since released them. I believe the Russian authorities are now exercising a closer supervision over their prisoners and I hope that this is the case, for large numbers of prisoners might become a grave inconvenience in Meshed. Turbat-i-Haidari News. The troops and Police in Turbat-i-Haidari have received no pay for two months and are said to be about to go on strike. j | v The Governor of Turbat-i-Haidari appears to be more active than the Governor General of the Province in punshing criminals.

Interest in the war, though generally slackening is occasionally stimulated by the news supplied to Tehran newspapers by the Turkish Embassy and the Cerman Legation, and by absurd rumours apparently invented in Meshed On the other hand a local Mulla, son of Agha Sadr of Najaf, learns from his father that the people of Najaf are anxiously awaiting the arrival of British and Indian troops. Miscellaneous. Much damage has recently been caused at Kurit and Fahanij, two villages near Tabas, by a hailstorm. The local official news-sheet says that all the houses and buildings in these two villages, which between them contain 1,000 families, have been destroyed, and that some of the hailstones were 3 lbs. in weight.

I have urged him to stand to it as I am no less interested in the matter than my Colleague, having a basti of whom I cannot get rid until some action is taken. I now hear that he proposes to deport Ali Akbar who is comparatively friendless, and to take no steps against Meshedi Husain, who is strongly supported by mullas. Russian Affairs. Two squadrons of the 2nd Semirechia Cossacks, 384 strong, with 2 machine guns, under the command of Colonel Kulikoff, arrived on May 1st. There have been some cases of drunkenness among the men, probably as the result of the reac tion from their enforced abstinence in their own country, but my Colleague has asked Colonel Kulikoff to keep a tighter rein on his men and they will probably soon settle down. fc 4 The rest of the 1 st Semirechia Cossacks, under the command of Colonel Gush chin, left Meshed on May 2nd. I attended the parade service held on the occasion of their departure and, with Captain Thorburn and my escort, accompanied them some distance out of the town. The Russian authorities have again been perturbed by alarmist rumours from Afghanistan circulated by Colonel Scouratt, the Military Attache. I have comfort ed my Colleague with reassuring news from Herat. The 2nd Semirechia Cossacks paraded in the square of the citadel on May 6th (April 23rd 0. S.) on the occasion of St. George's Day and the name day of the Em press. Colonel Kulikoff called for cheers for me as well as for my Colleague. I hope that this act of courtesy towards M.

These measures should have a good effect. 1 hear that the Minister of the Interior intends to strengthen the police force m towns throughout the country and has called upon provincial Governors for a return showing the strength of the police in each town and the nature of their armament. Russian Affairs.—One squadron of the 1st Semirechia Cossacks left Meshed for Ashkabad on April 23. One squadron of the 2nd Semirechia Cossacks is ex pected to arrive on May 1st, and the remaining squadron of the 1st Regiment will leave on the following day. Another squadron of the 2nd Regiment will re place the two squadrons of the 1st Regiment on detachment between Meshed and Bajgiran, and the strength of the ^Russian garrison in Khurasan will thus be reduced by half. I hear that Caucasian Turks, Russian subjects, are agitating against the punishment of the murderers of the Bahai, Shaikh Ali Akbar. I am informed by Colonel Gushchin that Plodnikoff, the Cossack who killed the German shopkeeper Hoffmann, has been pardoned by the Tsar. The news is welcome in Meshed, as the man received gross provocation. Turbat-i-Haidari News. —See Diary No. 33 of 1914. Ahmad Agha, son of the Munshi of the Russian Consulate at Turbat, is again in trouble, this time for insult - ins the police, and I hear that the Russian Consulate intends to deport him from Turbat.

Kariz News. —It is reported that Saiyid Muhsin, an artillery officer from Herat, has passed through Kariz with 4 men en route to Meshed. I am having en quiries made here. Herat News. —There is some irresponsible talk in the town and even among some officials, notably Salih Muhammad Khan, Amin-i-Nizam, to the effect that Afghanistan and Persia will shortly join Turkey in her jihad against Russia.

Meshed Diary No. 18, for the week ending May 1, 1915. Persian Affairs, The recent heavy rains have caused much damage to houses throughout the province, and also caused an interruption of telegraphic communication with The depreciation of Russian rouble notes is causing much inconvenience and discontent in Meshed. M. Samsonoff, the newly appointed Secretary to the Russian Consulate General, is expected to arrive in Meshed shortly. M. Mikhailoff, the Russian Consul in Turbat-i-Haidari, is behaving in a very high-handed manner and has threatened that if Shaukat-us-Saltanah, Governor of Khaf, does not come into Turbat within three days to answer the complaints of some people of Khaf who have taken bast in the Russian Consulate, he will send Cossacks to arrest him and bring him in. The Governor-General has ordered Shaukat-us-Sultanah to go to Turbat and the Karguzar has telegraphed to Tehran, complaining of the Consul’s action. The Consul has also demanded and obtained the release of a prisoner, on no other ground than that the man is a cultivator of a village leased by a Russian subject. of the troops, and the Governor, and has sent a letter to them urging them to refrain from quarrelling and to work harmoniously together. He has also rebuked NaibSalar for changing the Governor’s orderlies without consulting him. Fourteen families of Baluchis, who emigrated from _ Chakansur to Russian territory some time ago, have now returned to Herat, being dissatisfied with the treatment which they received from the Russians, and are to receive grants of land at Chakansur. Forty more families are said to be ready to return. Political Summary. The War. Five more escaped Austrian prisoners have come to Meshed and are being looked after by the Karguzar.

The Imperial Bank of Persia — The news has just filtered to Sistan that the Bank m Tehran has not been giving cash for its notes. The Sistan Manager says that if British subjects joined with Persians in with drawing their deposits he would be in a difficulty, but it is not expected that the position will get out of hand. The Bank Manager at Birjand is sending a specie caravan to Meshed, I hear on the 9th instant. The Finance Department, Birjand. —The Director has returned to Birjand from Kam, deposing and bringing the revenue collector of the latter place with him. There has been a certain amount of friction in Kain for a long time past. The Tehran newspapers. —The people of Birjand recently telegraphed to the Prime Minister protesting against the articles which have lately appeared in the papers against Shaukat-ul-Mulk.

Ustad Muhammad, another leading Bahai, is in feus Gin the British Consulate General. The leader of the Bahais in Turbat-i-Haidari has asked me to extend my protection to his son, living in Turshiz, and I have replied that I cannot be responsible for the safety of anybody at such a distance, but if his son’s life is really m danger and he cares to come to Meshed I will extend my hospitality to him. 7 My Colleague has issued a notice prohibiting Russian subjects in Meshed from carrying arms without a license, and the Chief of Police has issued a similar notice prohibiting Persian subjects from carrying, selling, or importing arms. According to a Meshed newspaper, the inhabitants of Mahall-i-Bayak, two farsakhs from Turbat-i-Haidari, who number 1,000 families, have pledged them selves to abstain from sugar and tea and to ostracize anybody who uses them. By this means they expect to save between them 18,000 tumans a year. They also have agreed that any person who slanders another is to be fined 50 tumans and that the owner of any animal which strays on to the land of another is to be fined 5 tumans. The fines are to be given to the poor. The contractor to the Russian troops, who recently fled from Meshed, has been arrested at Turbat-i-Haidari and handed over to the Russian Consul. Another packet of papers relating to the jihad has arrived at the Turbat-i- Haidari Post Office, but the Postmaster has not delivered them to the addressee. Afghan traders in Herat have complained to the Governor of the manner in which they are treated by their Russian customers in Panideh, who pay them in depreciated rouble notes, so that they suffer a loss of 14 per cent. The Governor has advised them to petition the Amir and has ordered the customs officials to recover no duty from the traders until the Amir’s orders are received. The Daragaz district is disturbed, the house of the local head of the Pinance and Customs Department was recently broken into and official records as well as private property were stolen.

T. W. HAIG, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General and Agent ojCONFIDENTIAL. Meshed Diary No. 15 for / Persian Officials—fhe Karguzar is in trouble with the Persian Foreign Office- owing to his interference in disputes between Persian subjects, to his clumsy hand ling of the question of fugitive prisoners of war in Khorassan, and to his mismanage- ment of the case of a British subject. The Commander of the Troops, whose father was formerly Minister at Berlin and is now Ambassador in Constantinople, is said to be a decided Germanonhil He is having the troops taught a surud-i-milli or national hymn, a crude production which apparently emanates from Tehran. It contains an indiscreet reference to “ tiie enemy who, if he returns to Persia, is to be driven from Bai to Resht and with whose blood the land is to be dyed red.” The vocal efforts of the army are likely to add a new terror to life in Meshed, already sufficiently disturbed bv discordant strains of three bands. ^ Persian Affairs.—The agitation against Bahais continues. They are ex cluded from the Shrine and the authorities have not yet ventured to arrest the murderers of Shaikh Ali Akbar. Two Bahais have recently recanted. Four Austrian prisoners who had been detained by the Russians in Kuchan arrived in Meshed on April 7th, and have been handed over to the Karguzar. The Chief of Police tells me that there are three or four more escaped prisoners, either Austrian or German, lurking in the town. Efforts are being made to obtain an appointment for the brigand Muhammad Khurshabadi, and I hear that he has been offered the command of 30 sowars in Meshed or 15 in Turbat-i-Haidari. Russian Affairs. —I hear on good authority that the 1st Semirechia^Cossacks will be leaving Meshed for the front on April 23rd (N. S.) and will be relieved by the 2nd Semirechia Cossacks. The question of the exchange value of rouble notes is causing some trouble. A number of Afghan traders who are accustomed to sell sheep in Merv for krans found this year that the kran was no longer current in Merv, and yrere obliged to accept payment in rouble notes. They say that there were assured that they could change these notes anywhere at 580 krans for 100 roubles but on bringing them to Meshed they find that the rate of exchange is 480 krans. So far as I can | learn they stand to lose about £1,000 by exchange and they are naturally much annoyed. The affair has done the reputation of the Russian Bank no good. I hear that Madame Nicolski has presented the Karguzar’s daughter with a gold watch in return for the tie-pin which she received from the Karguzar. Herat News. —Afghan traders report that the Russian frontier is infested by robbers. One party was robbed by a gang of Armenians and could obtain no satisfaction from the Governor of Panjdeh, to whom they applied for redress. Afghan traders complain that the Russians do not permit them to receive payment for their goods in Russian or Bokhara gold but compel them to dispose of their goods either by barter or for Russian paper money, which sells at a large discount in Herat. The Governor of Herat has imprisoned one Faiz Muhammad Sabzgi of Gulran, whose son, living in Shaikh Junaid, is accused of being a Russian spy. Naib Salar has made himself very unpopular by limiting the number of order lies allowed for each officer and prohibiting the detailing of orderlies for junior officers. Recently an agitation has been got up against him on the ground that he treated the colours with disrespect, the fact being that he reviewed the regiments from the roof of the Arg and thus allowed the colours to pass below his feet. The Governor is taking advantage of the ill-feeling against Naib Salar. India, Foreign Secretary’s &lt; Mo ~ VI, dated ' 20 MAY 19152 Political Summary. Condition of Country .—Negotiations with the Shikaris and Zushkis are still in progress, and I hear that the Commander of the Troops has promised to enlist Rukn-ul-Islam and Pasha Khan have been brought into Meshed and released on bail by the Governor-General. They deny having had any papers with them when they were arrested. Their arrest has given a check to Shaikh Hasan Kashi’s attempt to cause trouble among the Barbaris, Taimuris, and Hazaras. There are persistent rumours that the Turks have occupied Hamadan and Kermanshah and that the Bakhtiaris and Lurs are about to join them. The latest modification of this rumour is that it is Salar-ud-Daulah, and not the Turks, who has occupied these towns. As absurd rumour is current in the town to the effect that the Germans have purchased in advance the entire wheat supply of Persia for three, some say fifty, years, and will pay for it by supplies of arms and ammunition. The Russians are said to be very active in collecting horses, transport animals, and pack-saddles in Russian Turkistan. They appear to be still apprehensive of the Afghans. Miscellaneous .—The number of emigrants from Khorassan to foreign countries during the past year is returned as 7,422. Most of the emigrants leave Persia in search of work. them as sowars. c The War.

This was claimed to be a Kamat-looted animal on the 25th April, and it has not been released yet though I telegraphed a very strongly-worded protest on the subject. . other case two camels belonging to an Afghan caravan which is proceed- ing all the way from Nushki to Meshed have been similarly claimed and seized. The investigation into the past history of these two animals will probably be gone into at Sistan, though the Afghan owners strongly object to being made to travel through the oasis at this season. The rest of their caravan goes direct to Bandan via Palang Koh. The 'political situation.— Ovi the 28th April telegrams were received by myself from His Majesty’s Minister and by the Bank Manager from the Chief Manager at Tehran announcing that the political crisis was ended and that Ain-ed-Dauleh had formed a new Cabinet. The Imperial Bank of Persia had failed to meet a run en gineered against its Notes, and a law had consequently been passed making them unconvertible in Tehran for 2 months. The Finance Department. —At the request of the local Finance Agent I enquired of His Majesty’s Minister the name of the present administrative head of the Bevenue Department in Tehran, and have been informed that Monsieur Leleux is about to assume charge, though at present the office is vacant. Ebtehaj-us-Sultan has of late been receiving instructions telegraphically un signed, though still worded in French. Finance Department, Birjand. —I hear that the Director, Mirza Muhsin Khan, did not go in the direction of Neh but to Kain, where he is still staying. The newspaper “Shahab-i-SaJcib ”. — This Tehran paper, edited by Shaikh Ahmed, ez-Mudir of Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s school in Birjand, has published a fresh defamatory article against the Governor in its 40th number. His Excellency has heard from a friend in Tehran that the Shaikh is very bitter against him on account of his having exposed his double-dealing character to the British Legation. The anniversary of the opening of Parliament. —In Birjand the town was illu minated for three nights this week. In Sistan the Rais-i-Nazmieh, representing the Deputy Governor, and the Karguzar received no orders on the subject and conse quently have expressed their indignation about the omission. The Finance and Telegraph Offices made a feeble show of complying with the order, which came to them direct from Meshed. F. B. PRIDEAUX, Major, His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain. M.

I therefore deputed Mr. Lovell, who did the journey in two days, reaching Koh Malik Siah on the morning of the 21st instant. ’ ° His presence in the Governor’s camp at this juncture is proving useful in many ways. ° ^ I hear that there is a good deal of sickness at Koh Malik Siah among both men and animals. Two horses and a mule belonging to the Governor have died and also about 20 camels and 6 other horses. Baluch raiders .—(1) The rumour mentioned in last week’s Diary about Juma Jalal having been arrested proves to be incorrect. Alishah Khan and his brother Taj Muhammad have taken a month’s leave from the Indo-European Telegraph Department, ostensibly for the purpose of collecting animals from their fellow-tribes men to surrender to the Governor. Really, of course, they mean to place them selves beyond his reach, until he has turned his back in disgust on Koh Malik Siah. As the Governor has no intention of starting upon any offensive measures against the Sarhaddis this year, it is to be feared that his journey will prove rather a fiasco and an expensive one to boot. The Sarhaddis will be more than ever convinced of their invulnerability, and the need of European officers to supervise an affair of this sort becomes more and more apparent. (2) It is rumoured that Khalifa Khair Muhammad, the notorious gun-runner of Gwadur, with a following of 200 Afghans, has joined Mir Jehind to oppose the Persian troops. The Governor and the Revenue Department .—The relations between His Excel lency and the Finance Agent are becoming more and more strained. Ebtehaj-us- Sultan apparently has been protesting very strongly about the removal of the Kadkhudas from Sistan, especially now that so many of their villages have been overwhelmed by the floods. He declares that the damage would have been less if the farmers had been at their homes. The Governor has retaliated by telegraph ing confidentially to Tehran, urging the removal of the Finance Agent and recom mending that Sistan should be placed under the Birjand Finance Agent, Mirza Muhsin Khan, whom apparently he thinks he can control. Finance Department, Birjand. —The Director left Birjand for Neh on a tour of inspection on the 21st instant. Finance Department, Sistan .—Mirza Rahman Khan has relieved Mirza Ghulam Reza as Customs Director at Koh Malik Siah. The Custom House at Koh Malik Siah. —It is reported that, on account of some recent order passed by the Afghan Government, Afghan caravans travelling between Quetta and Meshed have recently ceased to use the direct route through Afghanistan. Consequently a very large number of camels are arriving daily at Koh Malik Siah from Nushki. It is believed that within a week or ten days they will number nearly 3,000.The Political Sitmtion.-On the 24th instant the Chief Manager,^Imperial Bank of Persia, Tehran, telegraphed confidentially to all Branches . Political situation considered serious here and likely to spread In Sistan everything is at present quite quiet. We are wondering whether the unrest at the Capital has anythins to do with the question of continuance of employment of Belgians m the Finance Department. It is rumoured that a telegram was received by the local Finance Agent, some fifteen days ago, announcing that all salaries m his Depart- ment were reduced by about 30 per cent, and the Agent is believed to have replied that such an order could not possibly be submitted to. The officials are awaiting -nn.v-dav with some perturbation. ‘ ' Munitions for the Persian Government.—300 Lee-Enfield rifles and 650 bayonets with scabbards, brought by the 19th Punjabis from Quetta, were dehveied to Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s representative at Dorahi, on the frontier between Robat and Koh Malik Siah, on the 22nd instant. The floods in Sistan.—It is reported that about 10,000 kharwars (Tabrizi) of grain have been carried away by the Hamun waters. The villages which have suffered most are situated in the Narui, Sharki and Miankangi circles. The three villages of Sardar Khudadad Khan—Sharifabad, Khwaja Ahmed and Shahnstan—have been absolutely destroyed. Being situated on high land, they were not protected by embankments, and it is said that all their houses even have been washed down. The labourers are going off to Meshed to earn a living. The Nawaqil Tax in Sistan.—See Diary No. 13. The receipts during the month of Hamal-Toshkanil (ending 20th April 1915) have been Krans 498 and the departmental expenditure was Krans 361. F. B.

The latter presumably hopes to induce the Governor, in exchange for this much wanted outlaw, to release his own brother Mirza Khan. (3) I hear that the Sarhaddi Sardars are all at Duzdab and preparing to come to terms. It is [said that the Sardars of Sistan do not view the situation with equa nimity, as their own complicity will probably be established more clearly after friendly relations with the Sarhaddis have been established. News from Afghanistan.—It is reported that a considerable Afghan force (described as three battalions!) has left Kala-i-Kang for Jaali Robat, under orders to help the Sarhaddis if the Kacha garrison co-operates with Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s force in active measures against them. It will not interfere in any fighting between the Persian troops and the Baluchis, which may occur in Sarhad !

The people of Daragaz are objecting to the demand for revenue for the current year and an instalment for next year. They complain that, having been left without a Governor and at the mercy of robbers for five months, they are unable to meet the demand. Shaikh Ah Akbar, Kucham, a Bahai who recently came to Meshed to preach the doctrines of his sect, was shot dead on March 14 in the Bazar-i-Kulahduzan near the courtyard of the Shrine. The people, suspecting an intention of burying the body in a Muhammadan burying ground and resenting the arrest of those suspected of the murder, raised a disturbance in the Shrine. The body was at last removed secretly by night from the place where it lay and carried off to Kuchan. Secret. —Three men suspected of being Turkish spies or agents recently arrived in Daragaz from Meshed and visited the Karguzar, to whom they were recommended by the Karguzar of Meshed. From Daragaz they travelled to Sang- Surakh and Kaltachinar. Their mission appears to be to Turkomans in Persian territory. Whether they will attempt to cross the frontier into Russian territory is not certain. It is to be hoped that they will as they are likely to get short shrift there.

The number of the Austrian prisoners who escaped from Askhabad was 33, of whom only 10 or 12 are known to have entered Persian territory. Four were seized in Hunimid, near Shirvan, by the Russian Agent in Kuchan, and brought to Kuchan, where they were imprisoned. The Russian Agent has gone on towards Bujnurd in search of other fugitives. I have heard noth ing more of the fugitive who is said to have been sent from Khakister to the Aus trian dentist here. 1 hear that the people of Shirvan intended to release by force the four prisoners taken by the Russian Agent, but were quieted by the Naib Karguzar. It is reported that some Ottoman agents have been discovered in Russian Turkistan and that some have gone to Afghanistan by way of Russian Turkistam Some are said to have been arrested and taken to Tashkent, where two of them have been hanged. The Russians are said to have declared that if an Ottoman subject is found in the house of any Turkoman both host and guest will be shot. The Russian Cossacks who crossed the border in pursuit of the Austrians who escaped from Askhabad are said to have committed some robberies. Russian Affairs.

In the possession of the former some papers bearing the seal of the Ottoman Ambassador in Tehran and addressed to one Muhammad of Herat were found. He said that these papers were given to him by Pasha Khan, and that he and Pasha Khan were being paid by German agents to smuggle these papers into Afghanistan. The two men have been handed over into the custody of the local Persian authorities. Herat News. There is a rumour in Herat to the effect that the Sultan has written to the Amir informing him that the British are poisoning the tea which they export to Muham madan countries. It is reported that the Afghan Cavalry are being re-armed with a breech loading rifle. A Russian Governor, probably the Governor-General of Turkistan, is said to have visited Bukhara and to have obtained from the Amir permission to collect subscriptions in Bukhara for the war and a promise to supply a contingent of 200,000 men. The Lesgis are said to have offered money but to have refused to fight against the Turks. The Russians have a number of Austrian prisoners in Merv. The Russians are said to be constructing two more installations for wireless telegraphy at Shaikh Junaid. I Many of the Turkomans in Russian Turkistan are said to be disaffected owing to the demands made upon them for men, horses, camels, and money. See diaries Nos. 9, 10, and 11.

A We notice lithographed at the Shahandar press in Baghdad and containing texts^rom the°Koran relating to jihad, has been received in Meshed, but I have not heard that any copies have been posted up. Various rumours are afloat. One is to the effect that the Amir will shortly be viltog He™ with reinforcements, and that the Russians will then be attacked. Another fs to the effect that the Lurs and Bakhtians, to the number of 36 000, are ready to take the field and that 15,000 have already gone to join the Heir- Apparent in Tabriz. It is said that Mirza Hashim, editor of the Watan (late Tus) has written to the Ottoman Embassy asking for 500 rifles for distribution to volunteers for the holy war, but that he has not yet received a reply.

Several cases of this sort have been taken cognizance of by the Consulate. The Governor has now ordered the discontinuance of the practice, as its prematureness is said to have driven large numbers of looted camels out of the country. He has promised to take organized measures for sweeping the district before leaving Sis tani ! Export of Opium.—Yhe Imperial Bank of Persia, Meshed, is transmitting to England, ofc, account o^-certain Persian clients, 362 parcels of opium, each weigh ing about 10 lbs. The parcels were taken by caravan to Eobat post office, and thence booked to the care of the Collector of Customs, Bombay. They'were delayed at Robat 10 days, partly because the Superintendent of Post Offices, Baluchistan, who had been duly warned of the coming of the con signment, had forgotten to arrange with the Political Ag^nt, Chagai, for the supply of 9 extra camels for the parcel post, and partly waiting for 40 postal bags, which were specially sent out from Quetta. The British postmaster (and Acting Trade Agent), Koh Malik Siah, went over to Robat to assist the Branch post master in unpacking the camel cases and registering the packages, a task which occu pied them two full days.

It is suspected that the Governor of Chinaran is in partnership with the Shikaris for the purpose of recouping himself for the pishkash which he had to pay on his appointment. A relative of one of the Shikaris’ gang has been seized on his way to Zushk by Karbalai Husain of Daulatabad, taken to Daulatabad, and put to death. Condition of Roads. A gang of robbers has attacked and robbed a caravan of camels near the gardens of Husainabad, a short distance from Meshed. One of them has been arrested and proves to be an old offender, Shir Muhammad, Herati, a follower of the late Yusuf Khan, Herati. The war. There is still some talk of jehad at rauzakhanis or mourning meetings and among a few irresponsible persons. Shaikh Hasan Kashi, a mischievous intriguer, is said to have written to Sardar Saiyid, a member of the Majlis, urging him to advocate a warlike policy for Persia. Any marked success in the Dardanelles is likely to put a stop to foolish talk of this sort, for nobody is readier than the Persians to shout with the larger croud. T. W.

General. The Governor of Sistan and Kainat.—Ris Excellency reached Lutak on the 28th March, and has halted there throughout the week. He was joined by Sardar Purdil Khan, Sarbandi, on the 30th March, but Sardars Khudadad Khan, Narui, Nasir Khan, Narui, and Khan Jehan Khan, Sanjarani, have not yet] appeared. The two Naruis are evidently thinking seriously of absconding into Afghanistan * Khan Jehan Khan is pleading physical inability to undertake the march, but the Governor wishes him to go in a litter ! An advance party of the troops, under Mir Darwesh, ‘ Ajudan,’ is to leave Lutak to-day for Koh Malik Siah in charge of supplies. Baluch raiders. —(1) Before starting from Sistan the Governor told me that he was convinced that most of the animals looted from Kainat were in the possession of Sistan Baluchis, and that he had he^rd that immense numbers had been driven just over the border into Afghanistan. He was wondering whether the Chakhansur authorities would help him in recovering them, and I believe that he has been in correspondence with them. I told him that in my opinion he would get very little assistance from that quarter. I have now just heard from a Baluch source that there is a collection of 3,000 camels and 100,000 sheep and goats at Mashi across the border, all recently sent away by Sistanis ! (2) Amongst other reports, the Governor has recently heard that Sardar Saiyid Khan, Jemadar until 3 years ago of our Consulate Postal Sowars, possesses a fine herd of 300 camels which had been looted from Kainat. A search party was sent to Saiyid Khan’s village Sharak, and though the master was not at home a very large collection of Kaini palans (camel saddles) was discovered in his house. Saiyid Khan left our service on the reduction of our establishment and has made no effort to maintain friendly relations with the Consulate since. He called on me for the first and only time about 4 months ago. He has been of late years osten sibly employed in protecting the Trade Route under Sardar Purdil Khan. (3) From Sarhad I hear that the Sardars have sent word that they can only surrender 1,000 sheep, as the other looted animals are all dead. They have also expressed willingness to give up any culprits demanded. They have asked the Governor not to enter Sarhad because they are afraid of him ! (4) A rumour has reached Lutak that Sardar Saiyid Khan, Hakim of Bampur, the most influential Narui, is dead. Finance Department, Birjand .—See Diary No. 13. I hear that the Akhunds of Sunni Khana have forbidden all the Persian Sunnis of the District to consume any opium at all. News from Afghanistan. —(1) See Diary No. 1 of 1915. About a month ago, the soldier fugitives from Chakhansur came to this Consulate and asked if I would protect them if the local Governor tried to arrest them with a view to extraditing them. I told them that I imagined they would be safe if they went to India, but that in Sistan I certainly could not protect them from their own Govern ment. They replied that they would remain in Sistan until the warm weather arrived ! I now hear that the Amir of Afghanistan has issued orders for the men to be sent to Kabul in chains if they can be apprehended. It remains to be seen if the Persian and Afghan authorities can strike a bargain over this and the raided cattle questions. (2) See Diary No. 34 of 1914. I hear that 200 soldiers under a responsible officer have been sent to garrison the new fort at Jaali Robat. They are orderedto give sanctuary to all Baluchis entering Afghan territory, and not to allow Per sian troops to cross the border. (3) An Afghan of high rank, of the Muhammadzai family, has reached Kala-i- Kangin Chakhansur. He is to report to the Amir on the condition of the District. The Imverial Bank of Persia.—The specie caravan, mentioned in Diary No. 10 duty Sd Kerman on the 29th March 1915.

Romanovski has informed me to-day (Saturday) of the receipt of news from Tehran to the effect that a Turkish army has passed through Kerman- shah and is nearing Hamadan ! In my experience the Imperial Bank of Persia telegraph news of political importance to their various Branches as quickly as any Tw institution and as they have not warned Mr. d’Alton against issuing drafts on the two’ places named, we are sceptical about the correctness of this latest report.

Prince Naiyir-ud-Daulah complains that the Government do not allow him money for the payment of road guards and maintains that in these circum stances he cannot undertake to be responsible for the security of the roads. He has advised the Provincial Postmaster not to accept parcels for the post and he refused at first to supply an escort for a remittance of the Imperial Bank of Persia, but this difficulty has been removed. He has tendered his resignation, but I believe that it has not yet been accepted. Persian Affairs. I hear that a considerable reduction in the office establishment of the Depart ment of Finance and Customs at Meshed is contemplated. M. Karnehs is a much more efficient manager of this Department than M. Collard. Five hundred men of the Shirwan district have taken sanctuary in the tele graph office at Bujnurd and have telegraphed to Tehran complaining of the tyranny of the Governor of Shirwan and of the officials of the Finance Department.

The rifles are smuggled in small quantities, each man carrying only two or three with him on his horse. They avoid customs posts on the frontier and pass principally through Jamrud. I shall communicate this in formation to the Customs authorities. See Diary No. 9. Muhammad Rah Khan was accompanied to the Afghan frontier by Taj Muhammad, servant of Abdullah Khan, and apparently crossed it at Jamrud. See Diary No. 52 of 1914. Nurullah Khan has recently been arrested by Shuja- ul-Mulk, this time apparently on a charge of stealing opium from a trader, and fined 3,000 tomans. He was released on Security, but has since taken refuge with Shaukat-ud-Daulah, who is on bad terms with Shuja-ul-Mulk. A Russian officer has left Yusufabad for Birjand. Some pilgrims who went to Mecca via Russia have returned to Kariz via Herat. They say that the Turks have occupied Egypt. This is probably an anti cipation of events picked up by them in the Ottoman dominions. 1HDIA. FO.E GIl L ;ULiAw i o f\ n dated 15 I_, At a »J i ^ . ii I*Herat News. Naib Salar has recommended to Kabul that 1,000 Khowanin sourars should be attached to infantry battalions, 100 to each battalion, for the purpose of carrying posts and collecting supplies when the regiments are on the marcn. A trader at Herat has received a letter from Kandahar informing him that the troops at Kandahar have mutinied against and imprisoned they'accuse of wrongfully recovering or withholding from them 3,00,000 Kabu rupees The Governor of Kandahar has sent their petition to Kabul. Risaldar Yar Muhammad Khan has had a conference with a Russian frontier official on the subiect of the robbery of sheep, which are driven across the Afghan frontier into Russian territory. The Afghan complaint is that the owners of the sheep are seized, imprisoned and fined, and their arms are confiscated, when they cross the frontier in search of their sheep. The Russian reply is that this is so when the owners cross the frontier, armed, and that the correct course for them to follow is to cross the frontier unarmed and lay their complamts before the proper Russian official. . , , , The Russian Cossacks from the quarantine station m the neighbourhood of Kariz are keeping a very careful watch on the road as far as Kafir Kai a . Muhammad Rah Khan arrived at Herat on February 21, with Taj Muham mad, the servant of Abdullah Khan. A large gang of 40 thieves has plundered the Governor’s garden outside Hera t and destroyed part of the house. The troops are suspected, and there is much unpleasantness on the subject between the Governor and Naib Salar. The Herat district is much troubled by robbers. Political Summary. Condition of Country. Three men from Shirvan and Aughaz were attacked by robbers near Daragaz, which was their destination. One of them was killed. One Hasan, a servant of Karbalai Husain Khan of Daulatabad, who is on bad terms with the Shikaris owing to his having killed one of them, was returning to Daulatabad from Meshed with 300 cartridges which be had purchased for his master. The Shikaris met him on the road, robbed and killed him, and carried his head off to their village, where they used it as a target. The War. Mirza Hashim, lately editor of “ Tus ”, has begun to publish his paper again under the name of the “ Watan ”. Its tone is much the same as before. A malicious rumour has been spread in the town to the effect that the British intend to bombard Karbala. This has excited some pilgrims, who have been mak ing inflammatory speeches in the Shrine. Other local news is to the effect that the Germans have captured Warsaw and are blockading London and that we have been expelled from Egypt. There is said to be still some talk of jehad, ^ chiefly at rawzakhanis or mourning meetings, but the general spirit of the people is probably best illustrated by an incident that occurred at Sabzr war. About 100 men drafted a telegram for despatch to Tehran saying that they have seen the declaration of jehad issued at Karbala and Najaf, and were ready to give their lives and property in the sacred cause. One of them was asked why they wished to send the telegram and replied that they had heard that a similar telegram has been sent from Hamadan and that they were afraid that they would be called unbelievers unless they did as well as Hamadan. When asked what their offer meant, he replied that nobody would be likely to trouble them for their lives, and that, as for their property, each of them was contributing two shahis (about | of a penny) to the cost of the telegram. In the end, however, they decided that this expenditure was excessive, even in the sacred cause, and decided to send their offer by post. T. W.

Baluch raiders. —I hear that the report mentioned last week is incorrect as regards the arrival of Mir Jehind at Duzdab. His nephew, Shah Sowar—a no torious raider—has appeared in his stead. It is said that the Sarhaddis intend to represent that they cannot abandon their practice of looting unless they are granted money allowances or villages in Sistan like their kinsmen who reside in the oasis ! It may be observed that the privileges enjoyed by the latter have not hindered them from levying Panchek (i.e., a rate of 20 per cent) on loot acquired by the tribesmen under their protec tion !

My Colleague is said to be anxious that Farman Farma should be appoint ed Governor-General. Mirza Ishak Khan, lately Karguzar in Sistan, arrived in Meshed, en route to Tehran, a'few days ago, and called on me on February 25. Persian Affairs. See Diary No. 8. One of the prisoners who escaped from the police jail has been recaptured, but the rest have made their way to Kang, in the Binalud hills, where they have joined the Zushki robbers. Owing to some delay in the payment of the revenue gendarmes recently attacked the village of Mughan, belonging to Haji Kaim Makam and shot and wounded the headmen. It is reported that one Muhammad Usman Herati has been carrying on a trade in rifles, which he purchases in Meshed with the proceeds of opium smuggled from Herat. He left Meshed on the night of February 21 with a consignment of rifles and the Governor-General has given orders for his arrest* but he will probably not find it difficult to bribe those sent in pursuit ‘of him. Mirza Muhammad Rafi Khan, an Afghan refugee who posed as a leader of the democrats and gave much trouble during ‘the disturbances in Meshed at the time when the ex-Shah attempted to overthrow the constitution recently returned from Tehran, where he had been for some time past and lodged with Abdullah Khan, the unofficial Afghan Agent. He has now left for Herat and is said to be bearing papers relating to the proclamation of Jihad by the Ottoman Goverpment, which he intends to take to Kabul and deliver to the Amir. While he was m Meshed he said that he had also a letter from the Shah to the Amir. The Herat Agent reports his expected arrival in Herat. Mirza Muhammad Rafi’s son* Muhammad Ali, known as Fazil, is a democrats He recently started a newspaper, the Bamdad-i-Jdaushan, in Tehran. Saiyid Haidar, brother of Saiyid Ahmad Ali Shah, has recently poisoned Saiyid Azim Shah, cihef of another section, and there is likely to be trouble between these two sections of the tribe. Russian Affairs. It is reported here that the Russian Government has recalled to the colours reservists in foreign countries, of whom there are said to be thirty in Meshed. The Russian Cossacks in Chinaran attempted to seize in a caravanserai there a gang of Shikari robbers, under their leader Husain, “ S CoL^allt d the connivance of the two lessees of the caravanserai, whom ? ossa f s ^ e t e “ and sent to Meshed. The . agent of Hap Husain Agha, a Russian protege complained of the molestation of his men y e ossac The two lessees have since been tried and acquitted. The Governor of Kalat-i-Nadiri who called on me on February 25, informed that the Russians are purchasing horses from the Turkomans at half price and at, demanding from each family of Turkomans a fur cap and a saddle for the troops in the field § He says that the Turkomans who are very well Off, are making these cOPtributions cheerfully.

' - ' See Diarv No. 8. The false news of extensive preparations in Afghanistan for Jihad, published by the Nau Bahar newspaper, has had a disturbing effect in Turbat-i-Haidari. Kariz News. Another caravan of wheat left Kariz for Herat on February 20. Herat News. A traveller from the Russian frontier reports that the Russian authorities are levying heavy contributions-in money, camels, and horses from the J- Urk mans. His report may be compared with the information given to me by the Governor of Ka]at-i-Nadiri. Complaints have reached Kabul of the absence of the Khavanin sowars from their posts on the frontier, and the Naib-us-Saltanat has directed t e overnor of Herat to enquire into the matter. Political Summary. Condition oj country and roads. The Governor-General has received orders from Tehran to take more stringent measures for the preservation of order and the punishment of the numerous robbers in this province. The caravan of Mirza Khalil Shirazi, a British Indian subject, was attacked and robbed near Jalpa, on the road to Tabas. One muleteer was killed and another wounded, and property worth 192 tumans was taken. Mirza Khalil him self was ahead of his caravan, and was not molested The War. The excitement caused by the Nau Bahar s intelligerce of preparations for Jihad in Afghanistan has not quite subsided and there is some foolish talk to the effect that the Persian Government has a secret agreement with Germany and Turkey, and that as soon as sowars can be collected in Meshed from Bujnurd and elsewhere they will combine with the regular troops, who have lately improved much in drill, and the “ Volunteers ” of the town, to attack and expel the Kussians.

Our claim against Hashmat-ul-Mulk .—His Majesty’s Minister has informed me that Mir Masum Khan (until recently known as Hashmat-ul-Mulk, and no^v granted bis father’s title of Hisam-ud-Dauleh) has signed a document undertaking to pay the Legation 13,000 Tomans in three yearly instalments in full settlement of our claims and that in consequence the villages and other property seized can be returned to him. I have informed His Excellency that I cannot hand back the camels as they have been taken out of the country. As a matter of fact they did not belong to Hashmat-ul-Mulk but to his deceased father. Two of the three villages seized also belonged to the late Amir Hisam-ud-Dauleh. These I am arrang ing to hand over to the executors of the estate through the Governor, Shaukat-ul- Mulk. The third village is being returned to Hashmat-ul-Mulk’s man. Shaukat-ul-Mulk is rather distressed at the news that Hashmat-ul-Mulk has been granted his father’s title, which Shaukat’s own grandfather once held. He says that it should have been given to the elder son, Sartip Muhammad Reza Khan, Deputy Governor of Sistan. The latter, though not so well born as his younger brother, is actually the eldest of the three surviving adult males of the family, and he is on the best of terms now with his uncle Shaukat-ul-Mulk. Shaukat-ul-MuWs movements .—His Excellency is evidently in earnest about going down the road to Koh Malik Siah. The troops were all moved out of the town into tents two days before Nauroz, and His Excellency himself will join them this evening (Saturday, the 20th March). This step is necessitated by the fact that it would be unlucky to start on a journey during the first fortnight after the f Id ’! The troops are said to number a thousand, and the followers, including every Sardar and Kadkhuda of Sistan, will number another thousand. The last named people will join the camp at Lutak, where His Excellency will halt a day or two. The starting of the force is now delayed for a few days because the Finance Agent cannot pay the soldiers’ salaries for the month just closing. He claims that he is not bound to pay them until the middle of the next month, and that he did not receive sufficient notice of the money being quickly needed ! I have pointed out to him the unseemliness of any avoidable obstruction at this stage, and hope that he will do his best to facilitate the departure. Another difficulty has been in regard to transport. I have told British traders that their interests connected with the forwarding of merchandize from Koh Malik Siah and Sistan must give way to the interests of the State on this occasion. All things considered, the Governor’s officials have collected their animals with a minimum of friction. It is believed, however, that more camels are still really required. BalucJi raiders. A report, just received from Koh Malik Siah, states that Mir Jehind has joined Taj Muhammad, Reki, and Juma Khan, son of Jehil, at Duzdab for the conference. The three Sarhaddi leaders are said to have large followings of 600, 500, and 300 men, respectively. These figures may safely, perhaps, be divided by three. It is believed that all the Sarhaddis now wish to make peace. Gun-runners .—A small party of Afghans is reported to have gone to Sarhad through Padagi, a few miles from Koh Malik Siah on about the 12th instant. Tie Finance Department.—I have heard from His Majesty’s Minister to-day by telegraph that the “ law of Jauza ” has been cancelled by the Parliament without discussion and unanimously on the 19th instant. ! riH; f i 'If! The law referred to is understood to be that which conferred such absolute powers in regard to collection of revenue and expenditure on Mr. Shuster five years ago in the month of “ Jauza A new Finance Law is under consideration. His Excellency Sir Walter Townley considers that the Belgian Administration is likely to disappear. This view is not at present held in Sistan. The War. —A printed Notification has been made public in Birjand and Sistan by the respective Karguzars to the effect that Persian subjects travelling to Egypt must have their photographs attached to their passports. The Karguzar of Sistan affects to be very indignant because the Notice has come to him from the Meshed Officer, who still styles himself ‘ Karguzar of Khorasan and Sistan The Zarakzai robbers. —See Diaries Nos. 2 and 3 of 1915. The claim of the British subject, Saiyid Mir Kalam, has been settled by the Governor granting him compensation out of property confiscated. The suspect, Ali Mazar, has been released under certain conditions. He has since reported that Hotak, the other British subject who had a claim against the band for camels looted, was murdered last July by Khan Muhammad, who was killed in January, and another Zarakzai named Jan Muhammad, a cousin of Shah Mir.

I hear that Prince Nayyir-ud-Daulah, the Governor-Oeneral, has sent his resignation to Tehran. See last week’s diary. It is reported that Sardar-i-Muazzam has been elected to the Majlis as member for Kuchan. Ishak Khan, late Karguzar of Sistan, and Shahzada Shahrukh Mirza, lately telegraphist in Sistan, have arrived at Turbat-i-Haidari on their way to Meshed Muhammad Riza, Deputy Governor of Gulmakan, in the hills between Meshed and Nishabur, lately attempted to arrest a Kurd named Rajab, and, on encounter ing some resistance, stabbed the man to death. Rajah's relations have imprisoned the Deputy Governor and cut off his ears. Persian Affairs. On the night of February 15 ten of the prisoners confined in the police jail in Meshed dug through the wall and escaped. Ismail, the murderer of Mirza Mas’ud Khan of Daragaz, was among them. Two Persian traders in Birjand have sent a telegram to some of the traders in Meshed informing them that the Nushki-Sistan route is about to be closed for traffic. This is probably a move on the part of those who hold stocks of tea or other Indian or British merchandise. Russian Affairs. One Ali, Sistani, who crossed the frontier at Sarakhs in search of two of his animals which had strayed, is said to have been shot and dangerously Wounded by a Russian frontier guard. There is much friction at Kuchan between the Governor, Shahzada Mustafa Mirza, and Dabir-us-Sultan (see Diary No. 5). The latter complains that his life is still in danger and I believe that my Colleague is demanding the dismissal of Mustafa Mirza. British Affairs. Captain Thorburn has returned to Meshed. Kariz News. One-third of next year’s revenue has been collected in advance from many villages in the district of Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. Herat News. The Amir has sent orders to the Governor and Naib Salar to keep as careful a watch on the Persian as on the Russian frontier. The officer commanding the frontier post at Zulfikar has reported to the Governor the arrival there of a man who claims to be an agent of the Sultan of Turkey and wishes to travel to Kabul by way of Herat. The man is said to look more like a Russian than a Turk. The Governor has ordered that he should be examined and then sent back into Persia. It is reported from Chihil Dukhtaran that most of the Russian troops on the frontier are Lezgis from Transcaucasia and absurd rumours are current to the effect that the Caucasians have refused to fight the Turks, that tbe Turks have taken Tiflis, that Indian Musalmans have deserted and joined the Turks, that the British and Russian troops have suffered severe defeats,' that Warsaw is being besieged by the Germans and will shortly fall, and that prayers are offered at Bukhara for the success of the Turkish arms. 3H \t Iry; | h :2 Political Summary.

Our claim against Haslimat-ul-MulTc. —I have not heard yet whether Hash mat- ul-Mulk has consented to compromise with His Majesty’s Legation on the lines proposed. The Russian Vice-Consul has been spreading a report that Hashmat- ul-Mulk has secretly fled from Tehran with the intention of joining the Sarhaddis, The Karguzar, Sistan, has informed me that the Russian Bank’s claim against Hisam-ud-Dauleh is only for 4,750 Tomans not 47,500. The Russian Vice-Consul proposed that some portion of the estate should be made over to him pending the settlement, but the Governor and the Karguzar replied that there would be no difficulty in liquidating the claim when the assets were realized for division among the heirs. The Russian Vice-Consul has also been giving out that Hashmat-ub Mulk has been given his father’s title by the Persian Government. The correct ness of this report seems improbable. The talked-qf ‘ Jehad ’.—I have heard from Robat that the precautionary measures taken there last week were due to a report—■subsequently found to be in correct—that 400 Sarhaddis had assembled at Ladis. There are apparently no Afghans in Chakhansur conspiring to commit ghaza. The Governor thinks that the rumour may possibly have beer based on the fact that the Afghan authorities have collected a number of labourers for work on a new canal near Daki Dela. Quarrel between the Russian Vice-Consul and the Governor. —Monsieur Roma- novski, entirely without justification, has written a most offensive letter to His Excellency accusing him of having a secret understanding with the British Con sulate and of ignoring the existence of the Russian Vice-Consulate! This because, on the 2nd instant, when Monsieur Romanovski was dining with him, His Excel lency had received a note from me enquiring whether he had heard of a rumour, said to be current in the town, to the effect that a number of ghazis had reached the frontier and a mullah was preaching jehad in a Baluch village. His Excellency had not communicated the same to himself (M. Romanovski) and the latter had learnt on the following day that I had distributed all my armed guards about the grounds of the Consulate and Bank for the night. The simple reason for His Excellency’s silence had been that he had refused to credit the story and that he had replied to me in a pencil note to the same effect, promising to make full enquiries in the morning. The Governor wrote back, to M. Romanovski, refusing to discuss the matter except through the official channel—the Karguzari—and suggesting that Monsieur Romanovski could not have been in full possession of his senses when he wrote so discourteously. The Karguzar is now trying to patch up the quarrel under orders from Tehran. Russian Officials. —A Military Lieutenant named Popov (?), reached Birjand on the 5th instant, escorted by six Cossacks. He seems to be travelling on Inspection duty of Cossack guards.^ He is said to have come from Karez via Khaf and to be about to return via Turbat and Meshed. The Governor of Khaf’s son, a boy of 20, is apparently acting as his In terpreter. Finance Department, Birjand. —Two mirzas have arrived from Tehran. They are Rahim Khan, formerly employed in Yazd, and Bahauflah Khan. The Imperial Bank of Persia, Birjand.— Vhz new premises specially built for the Bank by Misbeh-ud- Dewan and the son of Malik-ut-Tujjar were formally opened on the 1st instant.2 A Bank specie caravan. —The Manager of the Imperial Bank, Sistan, despatch ed to Kerman on the 2nd instant Krans 860,000 (£15,000) on 32 camels via Neh, Deh Salm, Deh Saif and Khabis. The Governor of Sistan has furnished 30 Persian guards up to Deh Salm. From Deh Salm to Deh Saif, across the But, the caravan will go in charge only of the camel contractor’s specially provided 6 armed men. For the rest of the way the Kerman Governor-General provides a guard. Between Deh Salm and Deh Saif neither Government admits responsibility ! This consignment of specie has been held up at Sistan since aoout the 1st February last, and half of it was ready in Birjand 3 months previously. The delay has been due'partly to fear of Baluch raiders and the unwillingness of various Governors to provide guards for it across the But, and partly to the indecision of the Bank asr whether to send it to Yazd, Kerman or Bushire. State of the Roads. —Two robberies of camels have occurred between Sistan ftown) and Butak. The thieves, 3 or 4 in number, seem to have come from Afgha nistan. In one case 1 camel was raided and in the other 9. The animals were all recovered by pursuing parties but one Sistani was shot dead. The Nawakil Tax in Sistan.—See Diary No. 4.

Oi late years, he in conjunction with two other petty Sardars one of whom was once an employe of the British Consulate and is still in close touch with it, has been responsible for furnishing the Road Guards (Camel Sowars) of the bistan-Koh Malik Siah Trade Route. I always found the old man quite friendly and ready to give news (with some reservations, no doubt) about Sarhad. A con siderable number of his young tribesmen have been raiding and in consequence are now m hiding. ^ (ii) Sardar Taj Muhammad Reki has written to Sistan that he has reached Duzdab with 400 men for the conference. He has urged Mir Jehind to take part in it, saying that if he makes peace alone he will not ally himslf with Jehind after wards. f There is some talk about a relative of Jehind being on the way to Duzdab. The Sarhaddis apparently are badly in need of wheat. (m) The preparations for the expedition from Sistan are going on apace. All camels between Lutak and Neh are being driven in to head-quarters. The Deputy Governor apparently does not relish the prospect of his journey. He tells me that he has never ridden a camel. I am doubtful whether the Governor will go south of the Shela River. Finance Department, Birjand .—The Director has been issuing stringent regula tions for the collection of opium revenue in Birjand. These are said to be working smoothly. In the Sunni border district of Avaz, however, there has been trouble ; villagers en masse have defied small parties of Sowars sent by the Deputy Governor in support of the Revenue Officials. The Deputy Governor has now appealed in writing to the Akhunds of Julgi and Sunni Khana for co-operation in the collection, having in mind the Government’s urgent need for money.

Persian Affairs. According to the official daily news-sheet, the people are cheerfully paying the one-third of next year s revenue demanded from them in advance, as they under stand that the payment will enable the Heir Apparent to start for Azarbarian where they expect that he will be able to set the affairs of that province in order! This statement does not agree with news which I have received from Shirvan, where the people are said to be vehemently objecting to the demand. On January 29th the Kazvini artillerymen mutinied after parade, abused and struck their officers and finally took bast in the Telegraph Office, which they were with difficulty persuaded to leave. The activity of the new Commander of the Troops, who insists on daily parades, and sometimes two parades a day, has caused some discontent and the artillerymen are mostly bad characters. Russian Affairs. I hear that my Colleague is inquiring into the question of bribes received by M. Eomanovsky the elder. Kardesh Bala declares that he paid 1,000 tumans to Kasim Baig, the late Tajirbashi, for payment to M. Romanovsky, and that M. Romanovsky left Meshed without doing anything for him. It is reported that some 15 or 18 Turkoman chiefs have been arrested in Merv and sent to Askhabad on suspicion of having had communications with Turkish and Afghan agents. It is also reported that persons crossing the Russian frontier in either direction are carefully searched, and all books and writings taken from them. Turbat-i-Haidari News. The Chief of Police and the Commandant of the Gendarmerie, who were sent to bring Salar Khan into Turbat, have returned unsuccessful. Salar Khan excused himself on the score of ill-health. The rumour that the Amir of Afghanistan had been assassinated and his son and heir wounded has disturbed the Russian Consul. I am instructing the British Agent to assure him that it is unfounded. Kariz News. A large quantity of wheat is being exported to Herat. An export duty of 10 Krans a Kharwar is charged on it. Herat News. The troops at Chakansur are said to have mutinied against Brigadier Ghulam Muhammad Khan. The Governor and other Khans suppressed the mutiny but the troops have sent a petition to the Amir praying for removal of the Brigadier, whom they accuse of extortion. A Syrian Ottoman subject, Hamid Efiendi, who visited Herat last year to see his sister, has been provided with Rs. 1,000 (Kabuli) and sent to Kabul. Relations are still strained between the Governor and Naib Salar. ^ There was recently a dispute between them regarding the changing of the Governor s orderlies, to which the Governor was not inclined to agree. This dispute has been arranged, as it appeared to the Governor that a disturbance among the troops was imminent, but Naib Salar continues to speak abusively of the Governor in his military durbar, and has spoken of putting him in chains. . . .POLITICAL SUMMARY. Condition of Country. The affairs of Muhammad Kurshabadi are being settled in Persian fashion. Some money in respect of parcels stolen from the post and 48 rifles and 32 post horses have been recovered from him. Nusmt-ul-Mulk, who has been ordered to return to Meshed, still remains in Nishabur and has paid over 2,000 tumans out of his own pocket as compensation to villagers robbed by his men. Five gangs of robbers, including the Zushkis, the Shikaris, the Daulatabadis, and Ali Jauzi’s gang, have settled in Chinaran district and are raiding the Villages. The War. See last week’s diary. As I learnt that copies of the speech attributed to Lord Kitchener were being widely circulated and freely discussed and were having a certain effect, I considered it advisable to publish a temerdi I denied that Lord Kitchener ever made or the “ Daily News ” ever published such a speech, and challenged anybody to produce a copy of the “ Daily News publishing the speech. I have circulated my leaflet freely in Meshed and Kuchan and am sending copies to Herat and Turbat-i-Haidari. The news of the battle of Sufian and of the reoccupation of Tabriz by the Russians has been rather a blow to the Turcophils but Mirza Hashim, editor of the Tus which paper is no longer appearing, is circulating a report to the effect that the Turks merely executed a strategic movement to the rear and are now besieging the Russians in Tabriz. This report is not likely to have much effect, as the Tabriz! Turks in Meshed receive news from Tabriz but Mirza Hashim is likely to be active, as he has just been refreshed by another remittance from Tehran. One item of news which he has received for publication is to the effect that in a recent battle the British lost 50,000 killed and the French 150,000 killed and 160,000 prisoners and that the French are blaming the British for not supporting them sufficiently, and are threatening to conclude a separate peace. Another item is to the effect that the Germans are approaching Warsa w and that the British have evacuated Basrah. The Mullas of Meshed have been approached on the subject of the declaration of Jehad, issued from Najaf. Agha Mirza Ibrahim, a reactionary, says that he is indifferent to it and that people may do as they like. Agha Saiyid Ali Sistani, another reactionary, says that the war is one between infidels on both sides, including the Turks, who are Sunnis, and that he pays no heed to the declaration of Jehad. Hasan Bursi says that if the Turks occupied Persia he would emigrate. Agha Saiyid Riza Kuchani says that the Russians are to be preferred to the Turks, as Christians do not interfere with the religion of Muslims. A&lt;dia Mulla Hashim alone urges obedience to the proclamation and abused a student who suggested that it had been extorted from the Mujtahids at the point of the bayonet. Disregard of an order purporting to issue from the Mujtahids of Najaf is of course, a serious matter, but the Khorasani will seldom be at a loss when the question is one of saving his skin and a man has been put up to declare from the Mimhar in the mosque of Gauhar Shad that the Mahdi appeared to him in a dream and warned him that Muslims should not embark on a Jehad unless they had the power and the means to ensure victory. The Aghazada, Abdur Rahman Mudarris, who was expelled from Meshed but has recently returned, Shaikh Hasan Kashi, and the Naib-ut-Tauliya are sedulously circulating mischievous rumours suggest ing that Persia has a secret treaty with Turkey and Germany and will soon declare war. Haji Agha Husain Kumi, a mulla who came to Meshed a year ago, is the channel of communication with Najaf. The Governor-General. Prince Nayyir-ud-Daulah continues to be on very friendly terms with this Consulate-General. T. W.

The Governor of Kiichan has caused some discontent in that town by his efforts to compel people to vote for Sardar-i-Muazzamwho, having been disqualified as a member of the Majlis for Meshed on the ground of his holding a post under Government at the time of his election, is now a candidate for Kuchan. Shuja- ud-Doulah, the late Governor of Kuchan, attempted to collect a gang in Meshed for the purpose of ousting the present Governor and taking possession of Kuchan, but he was not successful. Secret. The Persian Foreign Minister has asked the Karguzar to explain why he has retained all the fees levied in the Karguzari and has paid nothing to the Revenue Department. The Karguzar has also been asked to explain why he interferes in cases to which foreign subjects are not parties and why he has again permitted the Russian Bank to interfere in the matter of the contract for repairing the road from Meshed to Bajgiran. Russian Affairs. Kardash Bala, the Russian subject who is imprisoned on suspicion of murder is attempting to curry favour by revealing the secrets of his former associates and is also bringing charges of bribery against both the elder and the younger Roma no vsky. Meshedi Ghulam, a disaffected Russian subject, has been expelled from Meshed for two months. The Chief of Police has asked my Colleague for his assistance in arresting the members of a gang of thieves, Russian subjects, in Meshed and I hear that M. Nicolsky has agreed to help him. A Russian engineer with two companions has crossed the Persian frontier at Kaltachinar and is engaged in intelligence work along the frontier as far as Kalat- i-Nadiri. A Russian officer has arrived at Russian Sarakhs from Merve and has been making inquiries regarding the surplus stocks of grain possessed by the Turko mans and is also endeavouring to obtain horses from the Persian side of the fron tier. Persian Affairs. The body of Hisam-ud-Daulah, who died in Birjand, has been brought to Meshed and interred in the cemetery of the Shrine. It was received with military honours. Turbat-i-Haidari News. The fabricated speech attributed to Lord Kitchener has been circulated in Turbat-i-Haidari but has had no effect, as my dementi has also been published. Herat News. Two flocks of sheep have been lifted by thieves (Russian subjects) from over the border. I Political Summary. Condition of Country. The Governor of Chinaran is unable to cope with the gangs of robbers whose depredations were reported in last week s diajy and it is not improbable that he has4t; I li lli: 5 ! .)* i t (l : !J ' % a share in their plunder. The Persian telegraphist at Chinaran is not reporting the robbers, as he fears the Governor. The people of Shirvan are committing robberies on the frontier and the Gov ernor is unable to restrain them. The Baluchis of Kariya Sangar have beaten the revenue officials, who were attempting to levy a portion of next year’s revenue in advance and as there is everv ^probability of other tribes following the example of the Baluchis, the Superintendent of Revenue in Sarakhs is hesitating to demand the advance. Condition of Road. A gang of robbers, headed by one Ibrahim, a Tabrizi Turk, is infesting the Chahcha road. The body of a murdered man has been found on the Kalatroad between Bulan and Karate=ghan. The War. Turcophils now spread the rumour that Sweden is about to declare war on Russia. The Commander of troops informs me that several Turcophils in the town have approached him on more than one occasion and asked him to be permitted to drill with the troops, bringing their own rifles with them. He has paid no attention to their request, which is perhaps a pity, for the instruction which they would have received in marching up and down and round the square would have done them no good, it would have been possible to take note of those who appeared on parade, and the spectacle would have been enter taining.

General. Our claim against Hashmat-ul-Mulk.—See Diary No. 6 (second paragraph). His Majesty s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has approved of the proposal Hashmat-ul-Mulk be allowed to return to Birjand on undertaking to pay bait the amount claimed from him, in two yearly instalments. The balance of the claim is to stand against the Persian Government. The Governor of Sistan and Kainat.—ms Excellency had a brief telegraphic conversation with a Secretary to the Ministerfor the Interior on the 27th February on the subject of measures to be taken against the Sarhaddis. He urged that the Kerman Government should be ordered at least to co-operate with him in passively blockading the borders of Sarhad. His Excellency afterwards discussed the ques tion with me. He seems to realize that an invasion of Sarhad is not feasible this year, but he is loath to return to Birjand without accomplishing anything definite He is inclined to go down to Koh Malik Siah himself and to send his nephew, the Deputy Governor, forward from there a couple of stages to meet the Sarhaddis, as he is quite sure that the latter will not come near himself. If he can frighten them into giving hostages for future good behaviour he will make terms with them. Failing this, the feasibility of establishing a blockade of the border during the summer months will be considered. The ‘ Jehad' —I hear that a number of copies of the Jehad proclamation have reached Chakhansur. A report reached me on the 26th instant that the Indian garrisons at Robat and Kacha had received news of contemplated attacks by Afghan ghazis from Garmsel, said to number a thousand men, and that the news had subsequently proved to be false. It was believed however that a collection of ghazis still existed somewhere on the Helmand. I have heard nothing officially about the matter. fj Gun-runners. —(1) I hear that 14 camels laden with arms and ammunition passed through Baluchab and Regchah this week for Afghanistan, and similarly that 8 camels passed Hauzdar. (2) A Narui Baluch of Warmal near Lutak, named Mazar son of Shakar, who was formerly employed by the Customs Department, has returned from Bampur with a dozen rifles. He has stated that the Naruis and Bamris of Bampur are divided into two factions on the question of helping Mir Jehind against Shaukat- ul-Mulk. Jehind has appealed to all the tribal chiefs, including Said Khan, Bahram Khan and Nawab Khan. The Nobel Oil Company of Meshed. —It is rumoured that this Company con template establishing a full-time agency at Birjand. Hitherto the son of the Malik-ut-Tujar, who also works for the Imperial Bank of Persia, has done their business. The Amir of Afghanistan. —The Russian Vice-Consul has informed me to-day, 27th February, that a rumour has reached him from Afghanistan of the Amir’s death and a revolution at Kabul. I have not met anyone else who has heard the same story. V'I 0 Meshed Diary No. 4 for the week ending January 23, 1915. Persian Officials. The Karguzar’s transfer to Tiflis as Consul General has been postponed. Persian Affairs. A notification issued by the Ministry of the Interior has been published im Meshed. It announces that one-third of the revenue due for next year will be levied in advance for the purpose of defraying the cost of measures taken for the defence of the country and of the dispatch of the Heir Apparent to Azarbaijan. Elders of villages object to paying the revenue in advance unless the receipts for fit bear the signature of the Governor-General but M. Collard will not accept this condition and says that if the revenue is not paid willingly it will be collected by the gendarmerie. M. Kornelis, formerly employed in Persia, has arrived in Meshed with his wife. He is to be Provincial Director of Finances and M. Collard is to supervise both the Finances generally and the Customs. Russian Affairs. Several Russian subjects have complained to my Colleague against the Kar- ;guzar who, they say, takes bribes from them and then fails to settle their cases. The Russian subjects here also complain against M. Nicolsky himself, which I can well understand, for he is painfully slow and dilatory. He complains of overwork and Russian subjects here are certainly both numerous and trouble some, but I believe that his indecision of character unnecessarily delays the settlement of cases. I hear that the Governor of Ashkabad has sent a secret agent to Meshed without the knowledge of my Colleague, to make inquiries regarding Persian military movements, the armament and disposition of the troops, etc. Recruits who have arrived at Meshed for the 1st Semirechia Cossacks were formally sworn in at a parade in the square of the Arg on Tuesday 19, January, the Feast of the Epiphany (O.S.). The British Agent at Astarabad reports that 80 CosSacks, two or three of whom were wounded, arrived there on January 15, by way of Kara Su. He does not explain how the wounded men received their wounds. Turbat-i-Haidari News. The Russian Consul is ingratiating himself with the Governor, but is on bad terms with the Karguzar, who has complained of him to Tehran. Salar Khan has been levying contributions from the villagers of Zava, to avenge the imprisonment of one of his relatives by the Governor of Daulatabad. A quarrel is pending between the regular infantry and the revenue gendarmes. Kariz News. The post sowar of Abdullah Khan, the unofficial Afghan agent at Meshed, was robbed at Dahana-i-Shabi-i-Andak. Nobody would take over from him such papers as remained with him and he was forced to bring them back to Meshed. Herat News. The Amir has ordered the Governor and Naib Salar to report to him weekly such authentic war news as they may receive.2 A traveller from Kabul brings the absurd story that foreign airships have been seen over Kabul and that the people believe that these were German airships flying over the city for its protection. Political Summary. ^ Condition of Country. See last week’s diary. The two daughters of Mehr Ali Kermani have been recovered and restored to their parents. A gang of thieves, Russian subjects, are committing many burglaries in Meshed. Condition of Roads. Amir-i-A’zam, Governor of Shahrud and the Governor of Nardin have met at Maiamai to close the passes against Turkomans, who are said to be assembling to raid the Tehran road. The Chief of Bujnurd is said to be about to join the Gov ernors of Shahrud and Nardin.- The War. Two more papers have been received from Karbala inviting Mussalmans to unite for jihad, oc difa, as the Mujtahids prefer to call it. One, which is a collec tion of fatwas, or authoritative decisions bearing the names of most of the Muj tahids of Najaf, mentions Belgium as one of the powers against whose aggression it is necessary to defend Islam. Mirza Hashim, who lately edited the “ Tus ”, asked permission of the Governor-General to reprint these two papers for circulation in Meshed, but his request was refused. There are said to be three parties in the town which hold secret meetings at night and are endeavouring to stir up the people, the first consists of many students and the Mullas who teach them; the second of a number of young men styling themselves “ democrats,” and the third of Tabrizi Turks. I have mentioned them in the order of their numerical impor tance. There is much wild talk and the most mischievous suggestion is that if the people of Meshed rise the Afghans will certainly come to their help. It is., how ever, highly improbable that the agitators will go beyond words. They comfort themselves with rumours of the disturbed condition of Tehran and the interior of Russia. There are stories of the arrival in Persia and even in Meshed of a num ber of Tripolitan families who are penniless, and some of whose women are said to have been mutilated by Italians. I have seen none of them yet. The Russian authorities appear again to be alarmed by rumours which they hear from Afghanistan and I* have done my best to re-assure them. They are too ready to believe bazaar rumours and the reports of subordinate agents who wish to enhance the importance of their services, and both the Consul General and the Military Attache are extremely nervous men. Prices are rising in Meshed. Major Marsh, Military Attache, and Mrs. Marsh left Meshed per “Ashka- bad ”, en route to Tiflis, early on the morning of January 17th. 7 T. W.

D.—4-3-X5.—28.—M.D.CONFIDENTIAL. 0 Meshed Diary No. 5 for the week ending January 30, 1915. Persian Affairs, A recent sudden rise in the price of sugar in Meshed gave rise to a rumour that the Turks had destroyed Russian sugar factories and the railway lines, so that the export of sugar from Russia was impossible. Kief was mentioned as one of the places where the factories had been destroyed by the Turks. It was discovered that the rise was due to a comer in sugar worked by two local merchants. &amp; Prices have now fallen suddenly, with the result that those who bought sugar at the higher rate in expectation of a further rise are hard hit. 6 Russian Affairs.—It is reported that 50 Cossacks left Astarabad on January 23 and that 50, probably recruits, arrived there on January 24. J ’ A rumour is current in the town that the Russian Bank here will shortly close. J My Colleague has again demanded the suppression of the £ ' Tus ” and says that if the editor persists in publishing or circulating foolish stories his deportation will be demanded. r Three pistol shots were recently fired at Dabir-us-Sultan, as he was riding in Kuchan. His horse was killed but he was not hurt. The matter is under investigation. Russian papers have recently published a report to the effect that the Amir of Afghanistan has been assassinated and the Heir Apparent wounded by a Turkish agent. My Colleague was not much perturbed by the news, for he received a telegram from Petrograd, informing him that there was no reason for believing it to be true. British Affairs. —Captain and Miss Thorburn left Meshed on January 26. Miss Thorburn will travel to London via Akaterinoslav, Bukharest, Nish, Salonika, Athens, and France. Captain Thorburn will accompany her as far as Baku and will then return to Meshed. Turhat-i-HaidariNews. —Salar Khan, who is still at Zava, is demanding that the collection of revenue from the Baluchis shall be entrusted to him, that the heir of Shaji-ul-Mulk and the Khans of Daulatabad shall relinquish their claims against him. The Governor is inclined to agree to his terms but the Khans of Daulatabad object. The Governor has summoned Salar Khan to Turbat-i-Haidari but the leading mujtahid and most of the towns-people object to his coming, being appre hensive of a disturbance. Herat News. — The Governor and Naib Salar are still on bad terms. Naib Salar has refused to salute the Governor in durbar on the ground that a General officer owes no salute to a civilian. In his own military durbar he abuses the Governor. Under orders from Kabul the Governor is replinishing the stores of all caravan serais between Herat and Kandahar. The general sentiment of the people is in favour of the Turks and their masters, the Germans, and the British Agent is not so favourably regarded as formerly. The sepoys speak in favour of the participation of Afghanistan in the war but are not personally inclined to exchange the amenities of Herat for the hardships of campaigning.It Political Summary. Condition of Country.—Aigh&amp;n robbers have been raiding in the Khaf district but have retired into Afghanistan before a force sent against them by the Governor of Khaf. Kuchan seems to be disturbed. Besides the attack on Dabir-us-Sultan, mention ed above, there has been a shooting affray beetween one Mulla Ghulam Riza and Meshedi Musa, of the post house. The latter was wounded, but is still alive. Steps are still being taken by Nusrat-ul-Mulk to recover from [his sowars in the Sarakhs district the property stolen by them in the Nishabur district. His deputy went to Garmab and arrested some Baluchis who were barbering (? harbouring) them, but the men were released from confinement by others of their tribe and the matter is still unsettled. See last week’s diary. All danger of a Turkoman raid on the Tehran road seems to have passed and Amir-i-’Azam has returned to Shahrud and the chief of Bujnurd to Bujnurd. Condition of Roads .—A gang of robbers, brothers of the well-known robber Kilich, is infesting the road between Shirwan and Bujnurd. About 40 persons have recently been robbed and stripped. The Governor of Shirwan has sent sowars against the robbers. The War .—See last week’s diary. Three families of Arabs, said to have come from Tripoli, arrived at Meshed. According to a rumour in the town all Russians now in Meshed are preparing to leave, and all will have left by February 5. It is also rumoured in the town that the Armenians are massacring Musalmans in Transcaucasia. According to arrivals from Afghanistan, the Amir’s attitude may be judged by his movements, and if he goes to Jalalabad as usual this year he will remain neutral, but if he stays in Kabul it will be for the purpose of preparing for war. A most mischievous sheet has been circulated in the town. It purports to be a translation, from the “ Daily News ”, of a speech made by Lord Kitchener. The gist of the speech is that, after the war, Great Britain and her Allies will have an opportunity of destroying Muslims and stamping out Islam. The document is a very clumsy fabrication but the mention of an English newspaper is calculated to mislead the ignorant. It appears to have been printed originally either in Constantinople or at Baghdad, but it has been reprinted at Meshed in the “ Tus ” press, owned by a Russian subject. I have sent a copy to my Colleague and suggested that he should take the necessary steps with the printer. T. W. HAIG, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty y s Consul-General and Agent to the Government of India in Khorasan.CONFIDENTIAL. 1 i Sistan and Kain Consulate Diary No. 7, for the week ending 13th February The late Hisam-ud-Dauleh. —A nephew by marriage of the late Amir, by name Mirza Daud Khan' ; Kashani, has come to Birjand from Meshed to attend to the interests of his aunt, the favourite and second wife of the deceased. The lady in question belongs to the family of the late Ibad-ul-Mulk, who was succeeded by his son Abul Kasim in the Governorship of Tabas. Baluch Raiders—{a) It is generally rumoured in Sistan that Saritp Muham mad Reza Khan is going down to Sarhad to discuss the terms of settlement with Mir Jehind. I find, however, that the Governor has a very vague idea of the geo graphy of these parts, believing that Duzdab and Ladis are north of Koh Malik Siah! (6) It is said that Sardar Taj Muhammad Reki is most anxious not to be rorced into fighting, as he draws so much of his food supphes from Sistan. Mir Jehind is a more dangerous character altogether. (c) With reference to item (c) of last week, the force of Jambazes under Hyder Ali Khan Samuri of Duroh has just returned to Lab-i-Baring. They found proofs of the missing sowur having been murdered, and they 'subsequently attacked an encampment of Naruis, known to be raiders, near the Shela, killing one or two and capturing three or four prisoners. (d) The Tehran newspaper ‘ Raad ’ under date 18th January and No. 55, pub lishes a telegram sent by Shaukat-ul-Mulk reporting the attack on the Zarakzai band of robbers — see Diaries Nos. 2 and 3 of this year. Inspection of Boundary Pillars. —The Consulate Attache —an Afghan by origin- has recently inspected Boundary Pillars Nos. 52 to 76. He also paid a flying visit to the Governor and Brigadier of Chakhansur who received him in the most friendly manner. A number of small outstanding cases were discussed and advanced towards settlement. The people of Chakhansur seem to entertain no vain ideas about the likely success of the Turkish arms. The Rabat Column, Kacha. —On the 11th instant I heard from the Assistant Director of Supplies, Quetta, that the decision to withdraw the Robat Column from Kacha has been temporarily suspended. It is to be hoped that until an adequate force of Chagai Levies is ready to replace the troops, the idea will not be again entertained. There is no doubt that [the presence of a British force on the border contributes largely to the security of the Koh Malik Siah Custom House and the Trade Route to Sistan. General. F. B.

They heard of the murder of their missing comrade from a little Baluch girl and thereupon attacked the encampment close by, which belonged to Ibrahim and Nawab, sons of Mehrab (? Samki), Sherzai. One of the men they killed was Siah Khan, son of Haji Baghi of Aliabad in Sistan, and the missing rifle was subsequently recovered from Haii Baghi’s own house. The last named is now in custody. The sons of Mehrab above mentioned are brotners of Walidad, Sherzai, who was attacked in a previous expedition, see Diary No. 1 of 1915. Walidad himself is now sheltering with Ahshah Khan, Narai, the telegraph line guard. It seems that the Naruis of Nasratabad Sipeh received early information of the attack on their friends’ encamp ment, and anticipating that the force was coming against themselves also, all decamped into the hills to the consternation of Mr. Gabler ! The latter’s report, telegraphed to his superior in Kerman, seems to have raised uneasiness in the mind of Mr. Tanner as to whether the Jambazes from Sistan were not about to destroy the Telegraph Department’s property at Sipeh and Dehaneh Baghi! (6) Sardar Purdil Khan is making arrangements to send his own supply of flour down to Koh Malik Siah for his forthcoming journey to Sarhad. _(c) A rumour, unconfirmed, has just reached Sistan that Sardar Jehil, Ismail- zai, is dead. {d) I hear a report, unconfirmed, that the villagers of southern Sistan have been forbidden to sell any wheat to Sarhaddis. F The War .—Copies of the Jehad proclamation, printed in Tehran—see Meshed Diary No. 4 of 1915—have at last reached Sistan. They were shown on the 19th instant by one Ghulam Husain Khan, Kabuli, a retainer of Hashmat-ul-Mulk, to Seth Sulaiman, the Indian trader, who immediately reported the matter to me. At my request the Governor seized the papers (one in Persian and two in Arabic) and sent them over for my inspection. They resemble ordinary Persian newspaper sheets. Gun-runnwq .—I hear that one of the Lawani Afghans, who are mentioned in Herat Diary for the period ending 3rd December 1914 as having imported 500 rifles via Khaf to Herat, is named Amar Khan, Sarburida—a one-eyed man. He annually buys his arms round about Tehran. F. B. PRIDEAUX, Major, His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain,CONFIDEN TIAL I &lt;» Persian Officials.

Persian Affairs. Sarfaraz Khan, a Persian subject who went to Zulfikar to collect some debts due to him, has been arrested on some pretext by the Afghan frontier official and sent to Herat under escort. The Karguzar has protested. The people of Kalat-i-Nadiri complain bitterly of the oppression and extor tion committed by Mirza Muhammad Khan, the local Finance and Customs official and the thirty gendarmes at his disposal. The Chief of Police was threatened the other day by a Turk named Askar who drew a revolver on him, but he seized him and caused him to be severely beaten and imprisoned. J Turbat-i-Haidari News. Salar Khan, the Baluch, is trying to persuade the Governor of Turbat-i-Hai- dan to appoint him Deputy Governor of Julga, Daulatabad, and Zava and has promised to pay him 1,000 tumans a month for the appointment. The offer appears to be tempting, but as the present Deputy Governor, a Karai Khan, is a personal enemy of Salar Khan, the latter’s appointment to supersede him would certainly lead to trouble. Herat News. Formerly all government officials drawing Rs. 1,000 (Kabuli) a year and upwards were required to take in the “ Siraj-ul-Akhbar ” and the amount of the subscription was deducted from their pay, but &amp; far man just received from Kabul extends the order to all officials drawing Rs. 500 and upwards. Political Summary. i Condition of Country. Muhammad Kurshabadi is still at large and the Taimuris sowars who were sent against him admit that they are no match for him and have been plunder ing in order that they may be recalled to Meshed. Muhammad is now being “ besieged ” at Firuzi and negotiations between him and the Governor-General are proceeding. The conditions for which the Governor-General, who has named2 the Mutwalli Bashi as a surety for his good faith, is holding out are that Muhammad should pay all compensation demanded by foreign subjects, should restore every thing he has taken from the post, should give security for his future good beha viour and should disarm and disperse his present followers, retaining no more than ten of them. It is understood that Muhammad demands an appointment but that the Governor-General requires that he should remain quiet for two months, m order to prove his good faith before he receives an appointment. _ Muhammad has refused to negotiate any further unless all the men sent against him are recalled. The War. It is rumoured in the city that a force of Kurds and Turks has taken Tabriz. It is also rumoured that the German Emperor is a convert to Islam. ^ A son of Asha Sadr, a mujtahid of Najaf, now at Meshed, has received a letter informing him that Agha Saiyid Kasim Yezdi of Najaf has preached a sermon to the efiect that although the Shiah religion does not permit a proclamation of jihad in the absence of the Mahdi, the proclamation of a general defensive war against all non believers is permissible. He and other Mujtahids then left for Basrah to stir up the people, but Agha Sadr and a son of the late Agha Kasim refused to join or accompany them. Shaikh Hasan Kashi, a very mischievous man who was formerly deported from Meshed by Rukn-ud-Daulah, has returned and constantly visits Abdullah Khan, the unofficial Afghan agent here. He is believed to be attempting to stir up trouble in Afghanistan. I have seen a copy of an incitement to jihad, lithographed in Arabic, Persian, and Turkish at Karbala. It is in the form of a telegram from Javid Pasha, Governor of Baghdad, to the Mutasarnf of Karbala.

I The Karguzar tells me that he is likely to be appointed Consul-General at'/Mis. He says that Mansur-ul-Mulk, in charge of the Russian section in the Persian » Foreign Office, is likely to succeed him in Meshed. e Mansur-ul-Mulk, lately appointed Governor of Daragaz, has left Meshed for i- Daragaz. P Russian Affairs. ir The Russian Consul-General has forbidden the sale of alcoholic liquors by Russian subjects in Meshed and the Chief of Police has taken similar action with J regard to Persian subjects. a u The Russian Civil and Military Officials in Meshed seem unfortunately to be incapable of living in harmony. There is a certain amount of friction between the Consulate-General and the regimental officers and one night at the club Mme. ') Nicolsky attacked Colonel Gushchin in my presence for paying more attention to the British Consulate-General than to their own. Colonel Gushchin retorted that ^ they received more attention from the British Consulate-General. The fact seems e to be that M. and Mme. Nicolsky affect airs of superiority in their intercourse with the regimental officers and this is resented by Colonel Gushchin and the senior officers of the Regiment but above all by Mme. Gushchin. Turbat-i-Haidari News. ' Both the Russian Consul and the British Agent in Turbat-i-Haidari are com- 1 plaining of the treatment of Afghan traders by the Governor of Turbat, who extorts money from them. I am privately requesting the Governor-General to warn the Governor igainst this course of action. See last week’s diary. Muhammad Karim Khan, Governor of Julga, Daulat- abad, and Zava, has resigned, and the Governor of Turbat, in spite of a promise said to have been made by him to Salar Khan, has appointed Muhammad Jafar Khan, a relative of Muhammad Karim Khan, to succeed him. Salar Khan is causing trouble in consequence. Herat News. The Amir has issued orders which may cause a dispute, regarding the boun dary between Persia and Afghanistan at Musabad and Khushabad. Muhammad Sadik Khan Khafi, who has lately returned from Kabul, resigned to the Amir, in consideration of a grant of land and an allowance in Herat, some lands which he held in Musabad and Khushabad, and the Governor of Herat, by orders of the Amir, has sent to the Governor of Kuhsan instructions to see that Persian officials do not interfere with these lands. Sarfaraz Khan, who lives by stealing horses and cattle in Persia, selling them in Afghanistan.and again stealing them and selling them in Persia, has been arrested by the Governor of Dahana-ki-Zulfikar and sent to Herat, where he has been imprisoned. He had three stolen mares in his possession. The Governor of Ashkabad has sent a letter to the Governor of Herat to the effect that the work of repairing the boundary pillars should be postponed until the end of the war. Risaldar Yar Muhammad Khan reports that the Russian Colonel at Kara Tepe, when bidding him farewell before leaving for the front, told him in reply to a remark that the British were the friends of the Afghans, that thej were secretly the enemies of both Afghans and Russians and that the Russians had induced them to participate in the war in order to get them into trouble and that when this war was2 over the Kussians and Germans would unite to annihilate the British as they were the enemies of the Afghans. Yar Muhammad Khan says that he replied that the Afghans regarded neither the British nor the Russians as their enemies, so long as neither interfered with Afghanistan. The Russian Colonel’s remaks, if correctly reported, were perhaps a clumsy attempt to persuade the Afghans to remain quiet on their northern frontier, for Russian officials have been much disturbed by rumours of hostile intentions on the part of Afghanistan. Yar Muhammad Khan added that he believed that the Russians would have attacked Afghanistan if this war had not taken place. An absurd rumour is current in Herat to the effect that the leading Shiah theologians have examined the grounds of their faith and reached the conclusion that the Shiah beliefs are incorrect, and that all the Shiahs of Persia have in consequence become Sunnis. An influential Sahibzada (descendant of ’Umar) sent to the British Agent to ask whether the report is correct and was advised to visit Meshed and see for himself whether the Shiahs had changed their religion. Political Summary. Condition of Country. Muhammad is now in his own village, Kurshabad, and is about to be pardoned. Nusrat-ul-Mulk has returned to Meshed and the Taimuri sowars have dispersed. Abdul Majid their leader has been imprisoned in Nishabur, for looting. Nusrat-ul- Mulk has sent an agent to Zurabad to recover from his sowars the property stolen by them, but the sowars, with the help of the Baluchis among whom they live, are resisting the demand. Daragaz is now quiet. The Governor-General is endeavouring to transfer the control of the Khalisa lands from the Finance Department to Mansur-ul-Mulk. See diary for week ending December 19. The dead body of a girl has been discovered in Russian Sarakhs. It is probably that one of the daughters of the Kermani who was robbed in Persian territory. Condition of Roads. On January 7 a gang of 25 Shikari robbers robbed serveral villages in the neighbourhood of Chinaran. One Ali of Naubahar, near Chinaran, is robbing travellers on the road, and the robbers of Zushk are also infesting the road. Robbers of Radkan have robbed some Nishaburi travellers on the Chinaran road of property worth 400 tumans. They have traced the property to the house of Abdul Husain Baig, Ilbaigi, who fired on the men sent by the Governor to search his house. The War. Recent arrivals from Karbala say that the Turks permit no pilgrims to remain there for more than eight days, but send them away with a warning that the place is about to the attacked by the British and Russians, and the holly.places bombarded. It is rumoured that the son of Saiyid Kazim, Yezdi, of Najaf, who went to Basra to create trouble there, has been killed by the British. I hear that printed copies of the speech made by Saiyid Kazim, Yezdi, have been received in Meshed. According to letters said to have been received in Meshed, the Ottoman troops are behaving very well in Azarbaijan, where they pay for all supplies and refrain from interfering with Persian officials. I hear that the editor of the “ Tus ”, which no longer appears, is doing all that he can to cause trouble in Meshed. There is, I believe, much foolish talk among young Caucasian Turks, Russian subjects, and at rawzakhanis. T. W.

The death of Hisam-ud-Dauleh. —The body of the deceased was conveyed out of Brijand, en route for Meshed, where it is to be buried, on the 25th instant. Mus- taufi Mirza Muhammad Taki, with a Persian Doctor and ten guards, went in charge of it. There was a big procession through the town. It seems that a good deal of the Amir’s moveable possessions must have been looted immediately after his decease. His gold badge of rank has disappeared and his gold horse-collar was recovered after a search from a servant ! The Governor of Kainat and Sistan. —His Excellency has been distributing numerous Khilats, consisting of Abas (robes) and watches, amongst the Mujtahids and Mullas of Sistan. Baluch Raiders. —(a) Owing to the Governor being in mourning throughout the week I have not heard from him the exact terms of the replies received from Mir Jehind, Sardar Jehil, and Taj Muhammad Raki. I understand however that all three leaders have refused to come nearer to Sistan than Koh Malik Siah for a conference. Jehind’s reply is couched rather insolently. He expresses readiness to restore what he has looted from Kainat, but not what he took from the British caravan at Neh, “ as he has not received justice from the hands of the Baluchistan Administration in regard to lands taken from him within the British border.” He will not take part in a conference himself but will send his brother Shah Sowar instead. He warns the Governor against invading Sarhad and scoffs at his punitive measures against ‘ poor Sistani Baluchis.’ Jehil denies having taken part in any raid, while admitting that some of his relatives have done so. He claims to be a loyal subordinate of the Kerman Govern ment and expresses his willingness to co-operate with fShaukat-ul-Mulk if he comes to Sarhad, but warns him that he must bring a very big lashhar ! Taj Muhammad seems to have replied that he cannot visit Sistan on account of the death of his father Muhammad Reza (I have not heard whether this is a true excuse). Verbally he told the messengers that he has twice made restitution, first to Sardar Purdil Khan and again to Sardar Khudadad Khan, and he does not like the treatment meted out to innocent Zarakzais and other Sistanis ! (6) Sardar Pasand Khan is so alarmed regarding the Governor’s intentions towards him that he has come into Sistan with his family, feigning sickness, and has taken refuge with his son, the Russian Ghulam-Bashi. Nazar Jan, the ex-postal Jemadar of this Consulate, and headman of another tribal section in Lutak, was similarly scared and proposed to take refuge in the Consulate. The Governor has disclaimed any intention of proceeding against him. (c) News has just been received by telephone from Bandan that a band of thirty Sarhadis has passed northwards against Kainat, The Governor is sending a party of Camel Sowars in pursuit. F. B.

General. - r late Hisam-ud-Dauleh .'—The Karguzar has informed me that the Russian Vice-Consul has communicated to him the claim of the Russian Bank at Meshed against the Amir s estate for 47,500 Tomans. The Karguzar has asked to be shown the documentary proofs. His Majesty s Minister at Tehran has recommended to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that Hashmat-ul-Mulk may now be allow ed to return to Birjand.

He called on Mr. Vice-Consul New, who reports that he made quite a touching speech regarding his happy relations with this Consulate and British subjects in Arms dealing by M. Paguet.—ln April 1913 M. Paquet, the former Finance Agent, invoked my assistance with a view to getting a couple of Mausers, which he wished to import from Belgium for himself and his brother, passed through India. ^ I accordingly sent him a copy of the Indian Arms Rules and also wrote on his behalf to the Government of Bombay and the District Magistrate at Karachi. I now hear that he succeeded in importing at least five Mausers for various Persians, and that in two instances of Persian Officials who are on friendly terms with this Consulate he took their money and remitted it to Belgium, but the weapons have failed to arrive ! It is possible of course that they were confiscated in India. I am making enquiries. Baluch Raiders (a).—The Governor has informed me that the Sarhaddi Chief tains have demanded that the Deputy Governor, Sartip Muhammad Reza Khan, be sent to Ladis as a hostage before they come even to Koh Malik Siah or Duzdab for a conference. (b) The news of the death of Sardar Muhammad Reza Khan, Reki, is confirmed. (c) M ith reference to item (c) of last week, the true reason for the despatch of 60 Jambazes to Bandan was to search for one of the Neh Camel-Sowars who had been left by Sahib Jam at Koh-i-Sind as a look-out and is believed to have been murdered. He was armed with one of the Indian rifles and the Governor seems to feel the loss of the latter considerably. (d) Aibu—see Diary No. 4—appears to be having difficulty in inducing the camel owners whom he has robbed to accept cattle in compensation. He is said to have fled from Warmal, having heard from the Kadkhuda that he was about to be arretsed. (e) The inter-tribal dispute, arising out of the Shurgaz Caravan robbery, men tioned in Diary No. 2, is still developing. This Sarhaddi owners of nine camels, lifted in retaliation by Pasand Khan’s men, have visited Lutak and been told to recover the animals originally carried oft by their fellow countrymen. They threaten to again raid the Jambazes’ camels at Koh Malik Siah. The Rabat Column, Kacha .-—The news of the intention of the Government of India to withdraw this force to Quetta was received on the 6th instant. It is understood that the Column leaves Kacha on the 10th, general. Sistan Hospital Figures for January 1915. New Cases Old Cases Operations .. 1,376 .. 586 8 F. B.

The district of Turbat-i-Haidari is disturbed chiefly owing to the Baluchis in the neighbourhood of Bishkhar and Khaf, against whom the Governor is powerless. These Baluchis, foiled in an attempt to plunder the village of Hasan Khan, one of the chiefs of the Karai tribe, seized a relative of Hasan Khan out him to death, and burnt his body. ’ F See last week’s diary. The Taimuris who robbed a caravan near Sharifabad are under trial. Their chief, Nusrat-ul-Mulk, has urged that they should dbe India, Foreign Secretary's2 ? V ll pardoned, lest the Taimuris acting against Muhammad Kurshabadi should be dis couraged. Considering that the Taimuris have done nothing but rob the people since they were sent against Muhammad, the plea is hardly sufficient. It would better become Nusrat-ul-Mulk, who is a callow youth, to purchase a pardon for his men with Muhammad’s head. The Shirwan district is disturbed and Farajullah Khan, lately appointed Gover nor, found his entry into Shirwan opposed by Masir Khan, Jirastani, a khan of the Zafaranlu Kurds. After a fight, in which there were casualties on both sides, Farajullah succeeded in driving off Masir Khan, but the latter is now collecting a fresh force and preparing to attack and plunder Shirwan. A gang of seven robbers has attacked the village of Khairabad near Chinaran and has robbed the village of 200 tumans. Another flock of sheep has been lifted in Daragaz, some Turkomans have been robbed on the road thither, and the district is disturbed. During the past week two police officers have unfortunately been shot and killed while endeavouring to arrest notorious robbers who were lurking in Meshed. One of these robbers was harboured by a revenue gendarme. Muhammad Kurshabadi is still at large and detailed reports of his movements and of the efforts made to capture him appear in the official daily news sheet. It is doubtful whether he or those who are said to be trying to capture him are the more mischievous. Condition of Roads. The Meshed-Tehran and Meshed-Bajgiran roads are unsafe, as are also the roads in the Turbat-i-Haidari and Daragaz districts. The War. It was recently reported in the bazaar that Germany was suing for peace, but the latest rumour is to the effect that the Germans have taken Warsaw. The zeal of the editor of the Tus has lately been stimulated by another remit tance from Tehran, and he has sent some pro-German copy to the press. The copy has, however, been seized, and the money wasted. T. W.

It is believed that the old Amir had been quarrelling with his second and favourite wife. The news reached Sistan the same evening, having been signalled bv the Russian telegraphist to Monsieur Romanovsky. The latter communicated it at once to the (rovernor in a letter, instead of sending it by messenger to be broken gradually according to Persian Custom. His Excellency took great offence at this. The news is to be kept from Sartip Muhammad Reza Khan, the Demi tv Governor and son of Hisam-ud-Dauleh, for two or three days and then to be broken to him at a Rauza-Khwani ” ! The Sistan AW^ar.-Mirza Ibrahim Khan, Rukn-el-Vezareh, reached Sistan on Sunday, the 17th instant. Ishkbal parties from the Governor, the Revenue Department, and this Consulate went out to meet him.

Mirza Ali Asghar Khan, the Assistant Director, has been re-instated in his appointement by Mirza Saiyid Mohsm Khan, the German-educated Director. Possibly orders to this effect were issued from Tehran. ^ sta71 an d Kainal. —The newspaper “ Rauznameh Majlis ” published m Tehran contains a most scurrilous article written by a Tehrani Mirza who accompanied Shaukat-ul-Mulk to Birjand and returned thence, after five months’ service in the Army Department. The writer accuses the Governor of all manner of swindles and describes his two chief Military Officers as “ fair violinists” but useless soldiers, and the Artillery Commander as an old Mulla who had sold all his guns ! Recent events at least show that the young ex-Cossack Officer, Ali Naki Khan, does not hesitate to summarily punish robbers. Baluch Raiders. (1) See item (1) of Diary No. 1.

Alam Khan, the head of these Brahuis, has sent a present of 20 sheep to the Governor, but refuses to go into Sistan himself, though his son is a Jambaz on the Trade Route ! A number of Brahuis, including Allah Dad, son of Shah Beg, and Shah Nazar, son of Zaman Khan, have fled with their famihes across the border towards Bandar Kamalan.

A traveller from Kerman was robbed a few days ago on the latter road, probably by Taimuris, everything he had was carried off, including his son and two daughters, aged 10 and 5. A number of Turkomans set out recently to raid the Tehran road in the neigh bourhood of Shahrud, but the Chief of Bujnurd moved out to intercept them. It is not known whether he met them. There is very little excitement now regarding the war. The “ Tus has lately been publishing an extra sheet of German war news but has been com pelled to double the price of it and the editor complains of financial loss which X do not understand as I learn that he receives generous remittances from Tehran. The most interesting item of recent news is to the effect that a squadron of 12 Ger man ships of war, taking advantage of rough weather in the North Sea, left the Kiel canal and gained the Atlantic where they were bombarding the coast of Scotland and were about to bombard Poland.

Meshed Diary No. 52 for the week ending December 26, 1914 Persian Officials. .The Governor-General has received a telegram from the Minister of the Interior urging him to agree to the removal of the present Chief of Police and to the appoint- ment of Musaddik-ud-DauIah. I believe be has replied that he will resign if the matter is not dropped. The present Chief of Police is one of the few efficient and honest officials m Khorassan. He is on good terms with both Consulates-General, he maintains order m the city, and he detects most of the crimes committed. He is disliked by the Karguzar because both I and my Colleague are in the habit of communicating with him direct and demi-officially in police matters and the Karguzari thus loses some custom, but I doubt whether the Karguzar’s influence is sufficient to bring about his dismissal. It is more probable that Musaddik-ud- Daulah has paid or offered something for a post, in which case he might well be placed on special duty for the purpose of catching Muhammad Kurshabadi. M. Bove, the new Assistant to the Russian Consulate-General, arrived in Meshed on December 20th. He has since been sent to Chinaran to inquire into two cases in which gendarmes of the Finance Department were killed by Russian Cossacks. Kardash Bala is said to have complained to my Colleague that M. Roman- oysky the elder, having received 2,000 roubles and a carpet in consideration of using his influence on his behalf, left Meshed without doing anything for him. Arfa-ul-Mamalik, head mirza of the Russian Consulate-General, is said be Arfa-ul-Mumalik, Kasim Baig (late Tajir Bashi), and other Russian subjects are urging M. Nicolsky to ask for the removal of the Karguzar. Nurullah Khan Mikui has been released on payment of 700 tumans and on giving an undertaking to appear at Meshed when called upon to do so. He is said to be in communication with the Governor of Herat with a view to settling in Afghanistan. Naib Salar, commander of the troops, in a conversation with the British Agent, spoke approvingly of the Germans and their policy, but the Agent described how they had lured Turkey into the war against her best interests and against the wishes of the majority of her people and reminded Naib Salar [that the Amir had declared himself to be neutral, whereupon Naib Salar professed that this view of the case appeared to him to be correct. His views can matter very little to anybody. A sepoy, who grumbled at the issue of orders prohibiting gambling among the troops, has been most severely beaten by Naib SalaCs orders and it is believed that he may die. The Lawanis who recently smuggled arms into Herat were Dusti, Abdur Rahman, and Nur Ahmad of the Nasir tribe of Kandahar, They were unable to sell the rifles in Herat and carried them on to Kandahar. A sharp look-out is being kept for Ottoman spies and agents but none have b^n discovered as yet. The “ Siraj-ul-AMbar ” no longer comes to Herat and it is believed that its publication has been discontinued. Russian Affairs. adopting the methods of his predecessor the late Abdul Hamid Khan. Kariz News. Herat News. 4c r h D i ^ 10 J2 Ten Afghan families who emigrated to Persia twelve years ago have returned and are to be settled on their former lands. Political Summary. Condition of Country. Kariz is troubled by robbers. During the week a shop was plundered and burnt in the village. Sarakhs is disturbed and the people are still agitating against vi ^at-nl-Miilk’s denutv. The Daragaz district is also disturbed. The Governor is^bsent in Ashkabad, and the people are clamouring for Mansur-ul-Mulk as their Governor. They have carried off a flock of 300 sheep, belonging to a Kuchan man, which was grazing near the town. Bajgiran is still disturbed and the customs and finance officials are m Russian Bajgiran. At Kalat-i-Nadiri four revenue gendarmes have extorted from a Barban all the money he had by threatening to cut his throat. The man was injured before he would confess where his money was hidden and is now under treatment. Other Barbaris turned out and seized the non-commissioned officer of the sowars, but the sowars themselves escaped. See last week’s diary. The actual quantity of arms and ammunition carried off bv Muhammad Kurshabadi seems to have been nine Mauser pistols, seven nfies, and one bag of cartridges. After this robbery Muhammad moved towards Sabzavar and at Zufarani carried off three post horses. The Taimuri sowars who were by way of pursuing him plundered a caravan at Sharifabad and have carried their loot to Zurabad : some of it has been recovered and brought into Meshed. Condition of Roads. The roads generally are unsafe. Muhammad Kurshabadi is on the Meshed, Tehran road, as are also many of the Taimuri sowars. A Cossack carrying the Ashkabad post to Kuchan was attacked by robbers, but drove them off. The War. The “ Tus ” newspaper has not been appearing lately and I hear that the editor is in financial difficulties. Copies of proclamations of jihad are received from Karbala, and I hear that one Midla Muhsin, alias Kuchak, a Russian subject who is a student in Meshed, distributes copies of one of these proclamations in Arabic, Persian, and Tuikish, signed by Javad Pasha. The idea of a jihad in alliance with Germany and Austria excites nothing but amusement here. T. W. HAIG, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General in Khorassan. G. M.

Regulations for military service.—TT oq following extracts from “ Orders to the troops of the Turkistan Military District, Number 329 ”, dated November 15th-28th, 1914, are published in the “ Turkistan Gazette ” of November 27th-Decem- ber 10th “ Numerous applications are being received at headquarters for the exemption of militiamen (ratniki) of 43 years of age from service in the militia (opolchenie). Many of these applications are based on Article Numhpr 394. ^ the Regulations for Military Service, in which it is stated that ^he mditia consists of all males, capable of bearing arms, from the age at which thev are first fit for service to the 40th year of age. By Section 128 of the Handbook for the instruction of rank and file of the Army and Navy, and of militiamen (ratniki) transferred from the reserve, the exemption of militiamen from service in the militia, on the attainment of the age of 43, comes into force only once a year viz., in December, irrespective of the time at which each militiaman attains that age. This regulation holds good, however, only in time of peace, for, on mobilization, the limits to terms of service for conscripts (Article 20 of the Regu lations for Military Service, 1912) are suspended. “ Militiamen of the Imperial militia are therefore under obligation to serve until such time as their services are no longer required. “ In view of this explanation, the General Stafi announce that, in consider ing applications for the release of militiamen, called up for active service, the fact must be borne in mind that only those militirmen have the right to release, who completed their 43rd year of age on January 14th, 1914, and who, although entitled for that reason to exemption, have been called up for active service by mistake. No other militiamen, even though they attain the age of 43 in the course of the year 1914, possess the right to release and must continue to serve until further orders.” Administration. 600.

The owners had unsuccessfully visited Sarhad and asked for the return of their animals. Returning they managed to lift nine camels belonging to the SarkMis, and brought them to Lutak. This has resulted in the irrio n ? . hehuigmg to the Camel-Corps Jambazes now stationed at Koh Malik Siah being lifted by the Sarhaddis from Karkaruki where they were grazing! ^ The Sistan Karguzar.—Miiza Ibrahim Khan, Rukn-el-Vezareh, the Karguzar designate, reached Birjand on the 1st January and left for Sistan on the 5th? The Finance Department, Birjand. notice was issued on about the 6th instant to the effect that from the 11th January Tabriz or Khurassani weights will be substituted for the local Kaini weights. The reform seems a sensible one, as it is ridiculous that Birjand should have weights differing from both the Khurassan and Sistan ones. There is confusion often enough in Sistan where the local weightq are exactly double those of Tabriz. weigms The Nawakil Tax in Sistan. —See Diary No. 50 of 1914. The receipts during the month of Kaus (ending 23rd December 1914) are announced to be Krans 662 and the expenditure on collection Krans 369. The War. —A copy of the c Jihad ’ proclamation from Karbala, mentioned in Meshed Diary No. 52 of 1914, reached Birjand from Tehran on about the 30th December 1914. It was addressed to Shaikh Ahmed, Mudir of Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s Madrasseh. The proclamation was shown to the Chief Mujtehid, Aga Shaikh Hadi, who pronounced it to be a forgery and advised Shaikh Ahmed to keep the matter secret. Mr. New’s informant was Shaikh Muhammad Hasan, son of the Malik-ut-Tujar, and Cashier of the Imperial Bank of Persia. I have not learnt that any copies have reached Sistan. It is improbable that the Sistanis or Kainis will pay any regard to the matter if they hear of it. The Sunni Sarhaddis may possibly attach more importance to it if they get any copies, but at present their attention is fully occupied with the question as to what Shau- kat-ul-Mulk’s intentions are with regard to them.

I am informed that Khudadad Khan has sent practically all his live-stock to Bandar Kamalan (in Afghanistan) before Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s arrival here. b ' re (II) See Diaries Nos. 49 and 51 .—The Sistan caravan, looted by Juma Bahadur was proceeding towards Kerman, not returning from there. It is said in Koh Malik Siah that the raiders comprised 30 Ismailzais (including Bulakzais), 14 Shaliburs and eight Rekis. The Sistanis numbered 150 men but only carried three rifles. I have seen a few of the leading sufferers. They partly blame His Majesty’s Consul at Kerman— unjustly no doubt—for their misfortune, Osaying that they would have carried more weapons but for a confiscation of a large number of their rifles which was carried out at Bam last year. (III) It is rumoured that there has been trouble between Sardar Jehil and Bahadur, son of Durra, who is related by marriage to the sons of Sherdil, Narui Jehil is said to have attacked Bahadur’s fort at Rahmatabad and to have carried off some prisoners.

Shaukat-ul-Mulk tells me that he need not come, unless he is prepared to return all the loot he has taken from Kainat.

The 3 Sistan Sardars have been informed that in the latter eventuality they will have to take part in the operations.

He has stated that the rest of the animals looted by his band are in Sarhad with the men who accompanied him. (III) The force of sowars under Sahib Jam, sent by the Governor from Lab-i- Baring to intercept a Baluch lashkar—see Diary No. 51 of 1914—returned to Sistan on the 2nd January. They do not seem to have met a lashkar, but they attacked near Koh-i-Abmar the encampment of some notorious Sarhaddis, who have accom panied Mir Jehind occasionally on his raids. The force reports having killed Wali Dad son of Mehrab Sherzai, with two of his relatives, and having brought in 7 camels and 150 sheep. Wali Dad’s brother, Nawab, was encamped on the Shela and, I hear from Lutak, has left for Koh-i-Abmar for the purpose of burying his relations. It se^ms that the Shebak tribesmen with Sahib Jam did the actual killing and Shaukat-ul-Mulk is angry with them for not having brought the men in as prisoners. (IV) The raider Juma, son of Bahadur, Shahbur,—see last week’s Diary—is said to have gained the hills in the district of Sardar Behram Khan, Bamri, beyond Aftir.

Mustafa Mirza has left Daragaz for Kuchan, leaving Zabardast Khan as acting Governor of Daragaz. The people of Daragaz are clamouring for the appointment of Mansur-ul-Mulk. Mujallal-us-Saltanah, lately appointed Karguzar of Turbat-i-Haidari, left Meshed for Turbat during the week. Imad-us-Saltanah, one of the members elected to the Majlis for Meshed, left for Tehran on November 18. The editor of the “ Kashif-i-Asrar ”, the comic paper of Mehshed, has been in trouble. He was accused of being drunk in the precincts of the fehrine and was severely beaten and sent to the Chief of Police, who released him. The man denies that he was drunk, and intends to institute proceedings against his assailants. The Governor-General is suspected of having got up the whole affair in revenge for some articles against him which have appeared in the “ Kashif-i-Asrar.” I am informed that at a secret meeting held in the Shrine to consider an inflammatory notice which has been received from Karbala it was decided that the present time was not favourable for a declaration of jehad. On November 19th my Colleague, in obedience to instructions received from Ashkabad, consulted me regarding the necessity for expelling German and Austrian subjects from Meshed. We agreed that there was no necessity for taking any steps in the matter. The only Austrian here is a dentist named Roelich, who is very far from being formidable, and there is a German, equally inocuous, who represents the Russian firm of Zargargin. The two representative?! of the */- Russian firm of Stucken and Company are technically German subjects but were born and educated in Russia and are Russian in their sympathies. The Russian Consul-General has been troubled by the case of one Ali, a carpenter, who met his death at a drinking and dancing party in the house of a Russian subject here. It is uncertain whether the man was murdered or shot himself, but M. Romanovsky informs me that he shot himself and nothing more will probably be heard of the case. A Russian military officer and a customs official have been inspecting the customs houses and several villages on the Daragaz frontier. The Passport Official at Kariz states that the Karguzar has informed him f that German agents may shortly be expected to arrive in Kariz and when they arrive they should be arrested and sent to Meshed. Herat News. It is reported that the Russians have strengthened Shaikh Junaid with wire entanglements and have mounted anti-aeroplane guns there. This latter item of information may be doubted. About thirty families of Hazaras from Ghazni have arrived at Herat with the object of going on to Meshed, but are being sent back to Ghazni under escort. Inquiries are being made into the sinking of wells on Afghan soil by Turko mans of Panjdeh and Takhta Bazaar, who graze their flocks on the Afghan side of Persian Affairs. Russian Affairs. Kariz News. the frontier.2 It is reported that the Russians in Shaikh Junaid succeeded in collecting 8,000 horses, all of which, except 300, were sent to the front. The troops at Herat appear to be still rather out of hand. Their officers are urging them to accept the Governor’s presents ofiered on the occasion of the Id-uz- Zuha, but they are obdurate and say that they do not accept bribes as their officers do. Political Summary. Condition of country. ' The Baluchis in the Turbat-i-Haidari district are plundering the people freely. Six robbers have plundered the houses of two Saiyids in Turbat-i-Shaikh-Jam after torturing the women to make them confess where the money was hidden Muhammad Kurshabadi is still at large. He himself has left for Sabzawar with 13 sowars, but the rest of his men occupy their sangars near Nishabur, where the Taimuri sowars are said to be attacking them. The Governor of Khaf is collecting sowars to punish the Afghans who raid his district. The robbers who were raiding the Radkan and Chinaran districts have been attacked by the sowars of Radkan and Daragaz. Two were killed and their heads were taken to Kuchan. The losses of the sowars were two killed and two wounded. There are many complaints of Ghulam Riza Khan, Kuchani, Governor of the Kuhpaya of Shandiz, wKo, on the pretext of punishing the robbers of Zushk and the Shikaris, is harassing the people of Shandiz, Abarda, Kahu, Zushk, Daulatabad, and Gulmakan. . Condition of Roads. A caravan of merchandise belonging to Jwala Singh was robbed in the Mahva- lat district on its way to Meshed. The War. Wild rumours continue to ci rculate in the bazaars. One is to the effect that the United States have declared war on Japan. It is said that the German Consul in Tabriz has taken hast in the American Consulate, and that his assistant, who attempted to take hast in a mosque, was killed by the people. It is also said that the Russians have bombaded Tabriz, as well as Khoi, though no reason for their action is given. M. Romanovsky informs me that the “ Tus ” will appear no more, so I suppose that my Colleague has forbidden the owner of the press to print the paper. It is just as well that it has been suppressed though its contents were amusing. In its last issue it informed the public that the western theatre of war was Stockholm, in England. T. W.

Salar-i-Ashraf, the newly appointed commander of the troops in Khorassan, has arrived at Nishabur on his way to Meshed but is unable to proceed further as Muhammad Kurshabadi blocks the way. Salar-i-Ashraf has attempted to remove this difficulty by suggesting to the Governor-General that Muhammad should be pardoned, should receive a sum of 30,000 tumans which he claims as compensation for loss of property during his present escapade, and should be placed in charge of the Meshed-Tehran road as far as the border of the province. Shuja-ud-Daulah of Kiuchan is said to have arrived at Nishabur on his way to Kuchan, where he intends to cause trouble. It is rumoured that Naiyir-ud-DauJah, the Governor-General, is likely to be dismissed. See last week’s diary. The editor of the “ Kashif-i-Asrar ” is filing a suit in the Adliyya against those who accused him of being drunk and caused him to be beaten. An anonymous notice, warning all preachers against making any remark calculated to excite antagonism between Sunnis and Shiahs, has been circulated in the town. The auther of it is a druggist named Meshedi Ghulam, a Russian subject but anti-Russian and anti-British in his sympathies. The Persian Government is apparently in straits for want of money. The Governor-General and M. Collard and M. Vercheval spent most of November 26 in the Telegraph Office discussing ways and means with Tehran. and Daduoff, formerly one of his fellow-prisoners, has been released on bail. A second assistant is expected to arrive shortly at the Russian Consulate- General. On November 26 one Russian subject shot another dead in the Bala Khiya- ban. See last week’s diary. It now appears that the man Ali, who was said to have committed suicide at a dancing party, wvas shot by a tailor named Iskandar, a Russian subject. My colleague has forbidden the owner of the “ Tus ” press to print the “ Tus ” newspaper and its daily bulletin. Muhammad Kurshabadi’s men have killed a British subject named Buhlul Khan, a servant of Shaikh Faiz Muhammad. I have sent in a claim for compensa tion. Meshedi Muhammad, the Russian agent at Turshiz, is giving trouble by inter fering in cases between Persian subjects. signment of rifles to be smuggled into Afghanistan.

Nurullah Khan, the chief of the tribe, is believed to be prepared to resist them by force. Herat News. Russian officers on the Afghan frontier are said to be alarmed by reports of the regular musketry practice of the Herat troops but it is asserted that nothing more than the ordinary practice is being carried out. I sent to Herat several printed copies of the Persian translation of His Excel lency the Viceroy’s recent proclamation regarding the provocative action of Turkey and I am informed that they have had a good effect and that the action of Turkey is condemned by the civil officials. Naib Salar and his officers, on the contrary, approved of Turkey’s attack on Russia and condemned the alliance between Russia and Great Britain. Political Summary. Condition of Country. Muhammad Kurshabadi is still at large and is interrupting traffic on the Tehran road and threatening Nishabur. The Governor of Kuchan reports that his sowars have captured and killed several robbers and brought their heads to Kuchan. He has imprisoned two Kurd Khans and other Khans of Kuchan are likety to rise against him. Karim Khan of Kush-Khana has raided the village of Izman, and the villagers are said to be preparing for reprisals. Twelve Afghans, under the brother of Mangal Khan, a British subject, who was expelled from Khorassan by Major Sykes, have been raiding the Persian frontier villages of Jangal, Ismailabad and Bakbaku. Ibrahim Khan, Baluch, and his men recently demanded a contribution from the village of Riwand and killed two of the leading inhabitants who refused to comply with his demand. One Baluch is said to have been killed. Ibrahim Khan is raiding the Turbat-i-Haidari district with impunity. The War. The Caucasian students in the schools at Meshed, who are Russian subjects, are said to be attempting to excite the Persians against the Russians by deliver ing inflammatory speeches and spreading wild rumours of a general massacre of the Russians by the Turks of Tabriz. They are not likely to succeed in rousing the martial spirit of the Khorassani. The latest rumours extant are to the effect that the Ottomans have taken prisoner the British Consul at Kermanshah and have also captured Tabriz, where 50,000 Tabrizis have joined them as volunteers.

The landlords are willing to pay it even though they will have to borrow at 10 per cent, what they Cannot collect at once, but they insist that the receipts granted to them .shall bear the signature of the Governor-General as well as that of the Financial Agent, and that the gendarmes shall have nothing to do with collecting the money, which they undertake to do themselves. M. Collard demurs to these conditions. The landlords complain that the revenue is wasted on the establishment of 4 the Finance Depart ment and the gendarmerie. The Ashura processions passed on November 20 without a quarrel and without a shot being fired. The arrangements reflect great credit on the police. An official notice to the effect that the new Majlis will meet for the first time on December 5 has been posted in the town. Russian Affairs. Mi .Domanovski has received a telegram summoning him to Petrograd and - leaves Meshed on December 6. The reason of the summons is not known but it may be connected with his application for a transfer to Corea. M. Bode is coming to Meshed as assistant to M. Nicolsky. Kariz News. The Lawanis recently caught smuggling rifles into Afghanistan say that they were carrying aniline dyes when they were joined at Ismailabad by another Lawani, a stranger, who had ten Wrendl rifles, They objected to his joining their caravan but he would not leave it and thus got them all into trouble. They said that they had passes for three rifles which they themselves were carrying for their protection and that these were confiscated. Caravans from Herat complain of extortion in the Customs House at Kariz, Nurullah and three other members of the Maku tribe have been imprisoned by Shuja-ul-Mulk, the Governor. Herat News. It is reported that Lawanis have smuggled seven camel-loads of firearms j into Herat from Persia, via Khaf. The arms numbered 500 and consisted of J muskets as well as breech-loading magazine rifles, some taking three and others five cartridges. A large quantity of cartridges was smuggled with the arms. The commandant of Panjdeh has sent the Governor of Herat a further supply of newspapers in Turki containing war news. The Afghans have filled up the wells dug by Turkoman herdsmen on Afghan soil and have sent the men and their herds across the border. The Governor and Naib Salar are still quarrelling about the question of cheap meat for the troops, and only the soldiers can buy mutton in the bazar. A foolish rumour current in Herat to the effect that crows had torn up the flags of the British and Russian Consulates-General at Meshed has been traced to a letter written to the Governor of Herat by Abdullah Khan, the unofficial Afghan agent in Meshed.

Since the first o 3;. uuram he has been holding mourning meetings in a tent pitched in the hills and lias been distributing cooked food to the people. The people of Nishabur mostly support him and all that the troops sent against him do is to plunder the shops in JNiskabur and levy contributions from the neighbouring villages. They have plundered the shop of a Kussian subject and the Russian agent has complained to my Colleague. Muhammad is supplied with food, grain, fodder, etc., by the people of Nishabur and with ammunition by Rais-ut-Tujjar. Nusrat-ul-Mulk has left Meshed with 50 sowars, bringing the total of Taimuri saivars supposed to be acting against Muhammad up to 400. The Governor-General has ordered Salar-i-Ashraf, now at Nishabur, to co-operate with Nusrat-ul-Mulk, but he has also sent a message to Muhammad to the effect that if he wishes to surrender he must disarm himself and his gang and give satisfactory security for good behaviour in future, and that he will then receive an appointment under the Com mander of the Troops. Fortunately Muhammad is not likely to accept these terms. Both I and my Colleague would object to his being pardoned, for he has killed a British subject and robbed Russian subjects. The War. Several Caucasian Turks, Russian subjects, are said to be holding secret sedb tious meetings and sending seditious pamphlets into Trans-Caspia to their co-religionists. Reports of Turkish victories over the Russians continue to be cir culated. One is to the effect that the Turks have taken Tiflis. It is also reported that the British have taken Basrah but the best effort of local geographers and strategists is a rumour to the effect that the Germans have captured Ypres, afBelgian port two farsakhs from London.

Diary of the Military Attache, Meshed, No. 47 for the week ending November 21st, 1914. History. 552. Germans, Turks and Turko-philes, in Persia.—The Russian military authorities in Azarbaijan, with the consent of the Persian Government, which had notified to Russia, November 1st, a state of friendly neutrality, have removed all Germans from Azarbaijan. Turkish subjects, including many Greeks and Armen ians, are being allowed to remain, owing to the fact that, during the recent Balkan war, many men of those nationalities were shot by the Turks for refusing to join the ranks of the Turkish army. Shaikh Abdul Bilar, an influential Persian, has been banished from Tehran by the Persian Government, for attemping to incite the Persians to initiate a holy war. (Russian Press, November 11th.) Resources. 553. Cotton, Turkistan .—The province of Ferghana provides two-thirds of the total area under cotton cultivation in Turkistan. (Askhabad, November 8th.) The port of Krasnovodsk exported, in 1913, 33,000 tons less than in 1912 ; the reason of this decrease is the increased export to Russia via Tashkent. (Press.) 554. Port of Krasnovodsk .—Statistics for 1913, recently published, show that the number of ships, which entered the port of Krasnovodsk during that year, was as follows :— With cargo ; 2,246, with a total tonnage of 771,769 tons; Without cargo; 670, with a total tonnage of 94,474 tons. The trade with Persian ports showed a considerable falling off, as compared with that done in the previous year, 1912. Military. 555. Russian troops in North Persia.—The following were reported on Nov ember 2nd:— Astarabad100 Cossacks; Meshed-i-Sar 90 Cossacks. Those were reported, in paragraph 486, to have arrived early in September. 556. Mobilization; Turkistan .—Officers of the 1st Semirechia Cossack Regi ment, stationed at Meshed, state (November 19th) that the 2nd and 3rd Semirechia Cossack Regiments (2nd and 3rd category Cossacks.— Attache) have arrived in Tashkent from Yyerni. 557. Mobilization ; medical .—The Turkistan military medical train, consist ing of 12 carriages, and intended to provide for the troops of the Turkistan Military District, now in the main theatre of war in Europe, left Tashkent, November 7th. The original cost of equipping one bed was 150 roubles (about £10) and of its month ly upkeep 60 roubles (about £6). (Russian Press.) v Administration. 558. Trans-Caspia .—In the absence of Lieutenant-General Lesh, on field service, Colonel Kalmakof, Deputy-Governor, is acting as Governor of Trans-Caspia.

Central Asian and Tashkent Railways. —The Management of the Central Asian Railway has, with effect from November 1st, cancelled the running of three fast passenger trains, which previously connected with trains on the Tashkent line, owing to the suspension of through passenger communication between the two railways. {Press.) It is not improbable that the press of military traffic, recom menced owing to the initiation of hostilities south of the Caucasus, is the real rea son for again limiting the public use of the Central Asian Railway. 561. Oxus Railway. —Consignments of galvanized iron piping, probably for the installment of a sufficient water-supply for the construction of the Oxus Railway, continue to pass from Krasnovodsk to the east. (November 11th.) 562. Telegraphs; Meshed-Sistan-Robat. —The construction of the line from Robat to Sistan is completed, but the line is not yet open for international traffic from Meshed to India, nor have the rates for telegrams been fixed. The first tele graphic message from Sistan to Robat was despatched on October 31st, 1914. 563. Mail and passenger communication between Meshed and London .— Mr. C. P. Baker, who left Meshed^ September 20th, accomplished the journey to London, via Tornea and Bergen, in 18 days. Although of military age, Mr. Baker experienced no difficulty on that account in the neutral countries traversed.

Worses,—The tour in Turkistan, made in the spring of 1914 by Prince Sheherbatof, Director of Government Studs, resulted in the collection of informa tion, regarding the resources of the various provinces, and in the submission of certain recommendations, which are now being carried into effect; the principal items of information and recommendations are published in the “Turkistan Gazette” -and are reproduced below :— {reference paragraph 519). Sirdarya. —The villages of the Chimkent distrxt possess especially good mares including large droves of Kirghiz, which require crossing with thoroughbreds. Recommended:—that the Chebishevski serving-station at Aris, the junction of the Tashkent and Semirechia railways, initiated and now maintained by the local Kirghiz, should be enlarged and improved, and, in future, be kept up at the expense of the la cal zemstvo. Government studs provide this station with Karabair stal lions (cross between Kirghiz and thoroughbred Asiatics), Yomud and thoroughbred stallions. Recommended :— that the stallions, at the serving-station at Taskhent, be replaced by Teke and Yomuds. Recommended -that, in view of the existence of numerous Russian settle ments and Kirghiz winter nomad camps in the Aujie Ata district, a serving-station with from 10 to 15 stallions, be provided at Merke, at the expense of the local ■zemstvo. Samarkand. —Many Karabair horses are bred in this province, but it is expedient to improve this breed with a thoroughbred strain, at government expense. Farghana. —The settled population own a few Karabair mares; there are also a very large number of mares in the Kirghiz droves, but these are mostly smalh A zemski stud-farm is now being built at Osh, and it was recommended that the Karabair mares, at this farm, should be crossed with thoroughbred stallions, and the Kirghiz mares with selected Karabair and Yomud stallions. Semirechia. —From 25,000 to 30,000 horses were inspected by the Director and his staff. Horse-breeding in this province is especially deserving of attention; there are large numbers of horses, already fit for military use, in all the Russian and Kirghiz settlements, but they are especially numerous at Yyerni and Prjevalsk. Recommended :—that the accommodation at Vyerni and Prjevalsk farms be increased to take 120 stallions, of which some should be allotted to the stations of Kopal and Lepsinsk. Trans-Caspia.- —Recommended that the number of stallions in the Askhabad zemski stud should be raised from 15, as at present, to 50, and that a nursery-farm be built for thoroughbred Akhal-Teke mares. Kushk. —According to information, received from Afghan sources, 8,000 horses were collected at Shaikh Junaid during August and September; these were sent to Merv, with the exception of 300, retained at Kushk. This report tends to reconcile the two conflicting reports, recorded in paragraph 472 {d) ; the report, to the effect that, up to August 23rd, only 4,500 horses had been purchased in Merv, probably did not include those collected at Kushk. 566. Despatch of troops to Russia.—A slight indication is furnished by the Tur kistan press, to the effect that the 2nd battalion, 8th Turkistan Rifle Regiment, Was despatched from Andijan to the front in August; it is stated that Lieutena; 1914.

L) (b) Consignments of clothing, etc., are continually being despatched from Askhabad to Lieutenant-General Lesh, who, according to the press, is command ing the 12th Army Corps. It is probable, therefore, that, if the press are correctly informed, turkistan troops form part of the 12th Corps. (c) A military postal and telegraphic detachment, in a train, described by the press as being specially fitted up for work in the field, left Tashkent (direction not specified'— Military Attache) for the front, November 13th. The train was com posed of 40 pairs of axles, and the detachment consisted of 26 officials, 63 post- office subordinates, and 89 military rank and file, 49 horses and 12 tons of baggage. A similar detachment is leaving Merv (direction not specified— Military Attache), consisting of 3 postal officials, 120 postal Subordinates, and 55 military rank and file. The press states that the Tashkent detachment “will be joined at Merv ” by this detachment, from which it may be inferred that the whole is to proceed via Krasnovodsk and not via Tashkent, as might be concluded from the fact that the Tashkent train is intended for work in the immediate rear of an army in the field. (d) According to officers of the Meshed garrison, the Turkistan Horse Mountain Battery has left Samarkand for service at the front.

The Governor of Kainat and Sistan.—Kis Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk entered Sistan on the 19th instant, escorted by the force which he has brought from Biriand. The Sistan Infantry Regiment, wearing no uniform, lined the route for a short distance, while the local Baluch Sowars also rode in the procession. The Sistan Army is now to be reorganized and properly dressed, I believe. All the Sardars, except the aged Khan Jehan Khan, Sanjerani, had met the Governor on the edge of the Hamun. Khudadad Khan and Haidar Ali Khan, the representative of Hashmat-ul-Mulk, were amongst them. I hear from Lutak that a large number of petty Baluchis and Brahuis had also gone to Nurab on the Naizar to 'welcome the Governor, but at the last moment a rumour reachd them that Mirza Khan Sherdil had mentioned their names as raiders in his confession, and consequently they had all bolted back to their homes ! The Officers of the Telegraph Line Construction Party. —The escort of Jambazes and Sarbazes which was reported to have left Sistan on the 7th instant only ad vanced from Lutak (two stages to the south) on the 15th. Thly reached Koh Malik Siah, however, on the 18th. They are commanded by Shadi Khan, son of Sardar / Pasand Khan. Baluch Raiders. — (a) A lashkar of 40 men is reported to have visited Khur and Sarchah on the western border of Kainat. They were attacked there by 18 Kaini Jambazes, who claim to have recovered three camels and a Kermani captive. One Jambaz was severely wounded. The force wus too weak to effect anything more. The Governor heard the news at Lab-i-Baring, and at once sent 90 Jam bazes under Sahib JanJ|back to Neh to try to intercept the lashkar. He .also sent 30 Sowars back to Birjand. (b) News reached Koh Malik Siah on the 16th instant that the Damani lash kar which had raided British territory near Panjgur has returned home with some loot and is now about to proceed against Narmashir. The leaders of this lashkar are said to be Mir Jehind, Shah Nawaz and Shah Sowar. (c) The Afghan traders of Saddaki (in Persian Sistan) who have suffered heavily in the recent plundering of their caravan at Shurgez by Juma Bahadur, Dildar, Shamshir and Reza Bolan (see Diary No. 49) have sent a deputation bear ing a letter from Sardar Purdil Khan to Sardar Jehil , Ismailzai, asking him to make his relatives restore their loot. I hear that Juma Bahadur and Shamshir, son of Nasir, are of the Shalibur tribe; Dildar, son of Isa Khan, and Reza Bolan are Bulakzais. The two first- named are related by marriage to the sons of Sherdil Narui. All the members of this lashkar have their homes about Gwarkoh and Nazil, 100 miles south of Koh Malik Siah. % {d) Ali Shah Khan Sherdil, the Telegraph Line Guard, seems to have repent ed of his threats against Messrs. Cane and Gabler. His retention in service can, however, hardly be considered satisfactory while his brothers remain unpunished for their recent demostration against Junabad and Karimabad (see Diaries IS os. 47 and 48) and the seizing of a Telegraph Ghulam’s mule.0 2 Afghan gun-runners.—{a) A band of 60 men, whose homes are in Chakhansnr, Lash Juwain, Garmsel and Ghazni, crossed the border into Afghanistan on about the 14th instant. They had brought a consignment of 500 rifles and ammunition in proportion. They had passed near Girdi, but their leader’s name is not known. (h) It is said that a fresh band is forming in Chakhansur, to leave for the coast shortly. Afghan robbers. —See Diary No. 47. It has been ascertained that the band which killed four Rekis of Sarhad comprised two Kubadanis from Bandar Kamalan, six men of Bikat, five Gurgs and one Zarozai. The Hakim of Bandar Kamalan, Sardar Muhammad Umar Khan, was asked by Sardar Muhammad Reza Khan, Reki, for satisfaction, but replied that the affair could be treated as an ordinary bloodfeud. The Rekis are said to be preparing to attack some Afghan caravan.

Muayyid-ut-Tauliya, eldest son of Naib-ut-Tauliya, Arab, has been appointed Kais-i-Aukaf (Superintendent of Endowments) for Khorasan. As he is in Tehran his younger brother, Sahib Ikhtiyar, will act for him for the present. Russian Affairs. General Fidarof arrived in Meshed on November 8. I understand that he has been inquiring into the conduct of the Cossacks in the Zushk affair and has reprimanded them severely. He visited the Governor-General on the afternoon of November 11 and was accompanied by M. Nicolsky. He told the Governor- General that he was much displeased with the Cossacks, who were rough fellows and attributed their conduct partly to their irritation at not being sent to the front and partly to the facility with which they could get drink in Meshed. He asked the Governor-General to close the liquor shops kept by Persian subjects, and pro- mised that the Russian Consul-General would close those kept by Russian subjects. The Governor-General agreed to close the liquor shops and also agreed, at General h idarof s suggestion, to permit no armed Persian sowars fto travel on the Meshed- Kuchan road without a pass, in Persian and Russian, for the arms carried by them. General Fidarof has gone out of his way to make himself pleasant to the British community here. On November 12 he held a parade to celebrate the recent victories of the Allies. He briefly explained to the troops the successes and the part taken m them by each nation. The Russian, British and French National Anthems were played, the last being repeated for Belgium as the band had not La BrabanQonne. The Russian authorities are much perturbed by rumours of military activity \ in Afghanistan and of the movement of troops, with hostile intent, towards the Russian frontier. Major Prideaux tells me that M. Vadim Romanovsky in Sistan has received a telegram from Tashkent on this subject. My Colleague here, whom I have questioned on the subject told me that he had received telegrams both from Petrograd and Tashkent. General Fidarof took me aside at a dance at the Russian Club on November 12 and earnestly asked me whether I had any information as he had been ordered to submit a report on the subject. Local officials do not appear to believe these rumours, and even Colonel Scouratt, the Russian Military Attache, a confirmed alarmist, discredits them, but the central authorities appear to have been misled by such wild rumours as are circulated in Persian and probably also in Central Asian bazars. I have done my best to reassure General Fidarof and M. Nicolsky, and think that I have succeeded. There is of course the possibility of German and Turkish agents travelling eastward, but these may never reach the Afghan frontier and if they do will probably not find the country hospitable. There is some ill-feeling between Russian and Persian Muhammadan students in the Madrasa of Mirza Ja’far at Meshed. One of the former has stabbed one of the latter with a knife. The Russian asserts that the Persian made an indecent proposal to him. Foreign Affairs. I hear that the Ottoman subjects in Meshed have telegraphed to their Am bassador in Tehran asking to whom they are to look for help now that they have lost British protection. The Governor of Nishabur has telegraphed to the Governor-General saying that he has heard that German and Turkish Consular officials may be passing through Nishabur and asking how he should receive them. He is being told, officially, that the Persian Government has recognized no such agents for Meshed and that he should ignore any foreigners pretending that they hold commissions from the German or Turkish Governments as Consuls in Meshed. o i India, Foreign2 —— Kariz News. The Hazara and Bakharzi sowars have left the Russian camp. They have received some pay but complain that two years’ arrears are still due to them. Herat News. The troops are on bad terms with the Governor and have refused to accept the presents offered to them by him on the occasion of the Id-i-Kurban. The Afghan Boundary Pillar Commissioners, with the exception of Kisaldar Yar Muhammad Khan, have returned to Herat. The Kisaldat remains at Bala Murghab to receive the Russian Commissioners for the second section of the frontier. The protocol regarding the first section -appears to be a satisfactory document. A translation of it will be submitted for the information of the Govern ment of India. Mirza Baiza, Naib Salar’s news-writer in Meshed, has arrived in Herat in obedience to Naib Salar's summons, the reason for which is not known. Political Summary. ; Condition of country. The Turkomans on the Daragaz frontier are said to have been negotiating with those in Russian territory with a view to the establishment of friendly rela tions. Muhammad Kurshabadi is still at large and occupies a fortified position in the hills near Nishabur, to which town he has been sending threatening messages. Afghan robbers on the Khaf border are reported to be making mischief, and the Governor has gone with his sowars to the frontier. The War. A notice has been posted up in the town warning the people that Persia has declared her neutrality and prohibiting them from making collections for the aid of Turkey or of any of the belligerents. The “ Tus ” newspaper, which has been appearing very irregularly of late, has published information to the effect that the Turkish Consul at Tabriz and his staff have been seized by the Russians and deported to Russia. My Colleague is much annoyed and has, I believe, sent a threatening message to the editor. T. \V.

V Sistan and Kain Consulate Diary No. 49 for the week ending the 5th December 1914. ^ 5 rj Genebal. Baluch Raids.—It was reported by telegraph on the 2nd instant that the Lashkar, which had looted Telegraph coolies on the 17th November, had attacked a large Sistani caravan, returning homewards from Kerman and Bam, on the 30th ultimo, at Shurgez. A letter received in Sistan at the close of the week attributes the outrage to the relatives of Ali Shah Sherdil. Various estimates of the property looted mention 90 to 100 camels, 50 horses and mules, 500 to 1,000 donkeys, 10 kharwars of roghan (ghi), and 3,000 Tomans or two donkey loads of cash. r The Governor of Kainat and Sistan .—His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk, having definitely promised the authorities in Tehran that he would start from Birjand on the 3rd December, moved out to Shaukatabad (six miles from the town) on that date (Thursday). On account of transport difficulties he had moved no further on Saturday,jbut I understand that he was certain to proceed to Mud on Sunday, the 6th instant. He is bringing Mirza Khan and other Baluch prisoners down to Sistan with him. The question of protecting the officers and line of the Indo-European Telegraph Department between Koh Malik Siah and Bam has proved a difficult one, owing to the Governor’s disinclination to send any of his force beyond the limits of his Province. Arrangements have, however, at last been made for the despatch of 25 Jambazes and 20 Sarbazes to Dehaneh Bagheh with Messrs. Cane and Gabler. The party would have started ere this but for transport and financial difficulties. Afghan gun-runners .—I hear from a Jambaz stationed on the Trade Route that an Afghan caravan, escorted by about 80 men, passed near Girdi Chah, going westwards, on the 27th November. This perhaps is the band which damaged some insulators near Gurandab as reported in Superintendent of Kerman Telegraphs’ message of the 6th instant. A party of the Gurgich tribe under Kamran, son of Sharif, Gulab, son of Habash, and Jahangir Khan proceeded southwards via Lutak about the middle of November. The Karguzar, Sistan .—Mirza Ishak Khan informs me that he expects to be recalled to Tehran in the spring for employment in the English Department of the Foreign Office. I hear that Ehtisham-i-Humayun, the last incumbent, and I’tisham-ul- Mulk, the Birjand Karguzar, are both candidates for the impending vacancy. Hospital Figures for the month of November 1914.

It is persistently rumoured here that German and Turkish Consular Officers are about to be appointed for Meshed. The general feeling among Ottoman subjects here is strongly opposed to the recent action of their Government. Arrivals from Karbala state that 150,000 Ottoman troops were at Khanikin ready to invade Persia. It is reported that Ottoman troops have occupied Urumia and Khui and are about to advance towards Tabirz. Telegrams are not accepted for Khui, Salmas and Urumia. T. W.

The information, received from private sources, and recorded in these Diaries, regarding the despatch of troops from Tashkent to Poland, early in August, is confirmed by the Turkistan Gazette, which announces that, on October 22nd, a party of officers and men of the original Turkistan garrison, wounded in action in the main theatre of war, have returned to Tashkent for treatment and for the period of convalescence.

Shaukat-ul-Mulk was promptly informed and warned that this outrage might only be the precursor of greater ones if nothing about Mirza Khan is quickly arranged. His Excellency has informed me through Mr. New that on the strength of the Deputy Governor of Neh’s reports he is claiming compensation for 39 flocks, 71 camels, and two men’s lives, besides the return of a captive, from Mirza Khan I don’t yet know whether the bill against Mir Jehind is included in this account, or is separate and in that case doubtless bigger. It is quite certain that the Sherdil branch of the Naruis cannot satisfy this claim. Mirza Khan has admitted to having concerned in the raiding of six flocks, but he declares that Nasir-us-Saltaneh and been Khudadad Khan recovered all the animals in his possession, when they went to Nasratabad-Sipeh in 1912. ■ Persian officials’ methods of business.—On the 23rd and 24th instant! addressed four letters to the Karguzar on different subjects, asking him (1) to arrest and punish a camelman for disregarding his employer’s orders, (2) to have a search made for a pair of binoculars believed to have been stolen by a Persian Sowar from the Telegraph Officers’ Camp, (3) to institute a search for one of the two men who looted three camels from Piran (m Chgai District) {vide Diary No. 41) and who was believed to be going to Sarhad through Sistan, and (4) in connection with a civil suit.

A number of landlords, assembled at the house of Haji Agha Kaim Makam, agreed to pay in advance land revenue amounting to 1,00,000 tumans on condition that the present establishment of the Department of Finance is dismissed and the ar rangements for collecting the revenue entrusted to Najd-us-Sultanah, wholhas previous experience of the work. They point out that the dismissal of the establish ments will save the Government another 1,00,000 tumans, which is very likely to be the case as the stationery bill of the department amounted last year to 15 000 tumans. ’ Another device is the leasing for terms of years of the Khalisa lands in the prov ince and the collection in advance of substantial instalments of the rent. Nayyir- ud-Daulah has thus taken on lease the Khalisa lands of Nishapur but it is not known what sum he is prepared to pay in advance, Najd-us-Sultanah has the lease of the Khalisa lands of Sarakhs but is unwilling or unable to meet the demand for two years' rent in advance. M. Collard also wishes to lease to Najd-us-Sultanah for 25,000 tumans, rising by annual increments of 5,000 tumans to 50,000 tumans a year, the Khalisa lands of Daragaz, but Nayyir-ud-Daulah is opposed to this lease as it is likely to lead to trouble. The Governor-General has been directed to recover compensation for the robberies of the post recently committed by Muhammad Kurshabadi and has replied that he can do nothing for the present, as Muhammad is in rebellion, but that he is making endeavours to have him seized. Russian Affairs. My colleague is pressing the Karguzar to cause the robbers of Zushk to be arrested but the Karguzar is attempting to gain time on the pretext that he is awaiting orders from Tehran. See last week's diary. The Karguzar has asked M. Nicolsky to let him know the result of the inquiry into the affair at Chinaran but M. Nicolsky has put him off with the excuse that he must first discuss the matter with Colonel Gushchin commanding the 1st Semirechia Cossacks. I Kariz News. See last week's diary The agitation of the Bakharzi and Hazara sowars is the work of Ha]iShuja-ul-Mulk, the Governor of Bakharz, and is directed against the Department of Finance and Customs. The Department has received orders to pay the sowars their arrears of pay for two years and Haji Shuja-ul-Mulk has been censured for fomenting the disturbance and has been warned that he will be held responsible for any riot that may take place. Haji Shuja-ul-Mulk for obvious reasons, wishes the payment to be made through him, but the local depart mental official objects to this and proposes to pay the sowars direct. 12 Herat News. A Jamshidi reports that Saiyid Ahmad Beg, Jamshidi, accompanied the Rus sian troops to the eastern theatre of war, where he distinguished himself and received three wounds. Political Summary. Condition of Country. Muhammad Kurshabadi is still at large. He has turned back from the direc tion of Shahrud and is now, with 60 sowars, somewhere between Gunabad and Birjistan. Steps have been taken to prevent him from occupying Kal’ah Gaisur. Sardar-i-Muazzaz of Bujnurd is still at Dasht and is said to be punishing the Turkomans who made an attempt to raid the Tehran road. The people of Farutain, near Turshiz, have complained to the Governor-Gen eral of the exactions r of the Barbari sowars who are supposed to be acting against Muhammad Kurshabadi. but do not venture to get into touch with him. During the past week four sowars of the gendarmerie of the Finance Department have created disturbances in the town by getting drunk and firing revolvers and rifles at random. One succeeded in severely wounding a man sitting in a shop. Robbers have attacked Uriyan, near Turbat-i-Haidari, but the Turbat police put them to flight after shooting two of them. A party of sowars has been sent in pursuit of them. Condition of Roads. The Ashkabad road is said to be unsafe and I hear that a Russian officer has been fired at. The War. I am credibly informed that the “ Tus. ” a local journal, receives war news from the German Legation in Tehran. I learnt the contents of one telegram before its publication and it was afterwards published. I now learn that the editor received a telegram on the night of October 22 to the effect that German troops had been landed in Madras, that theie were riots in India, and that Russian troops had | been withdrawn from Galicia and sent to Russian Poland.

Secret. —The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs has taken the Karguzar severely to task for his apathy in connection with the murders recently committed by Russian Cossacks, one at Kuchan and the other near Chinaran, and has ordered him to recover compensation from the Russian authorities. The bribe recently paid by the Karguzar to the Minister has now been digested, as the Persians say, and the Karguzar will have to renew this attention if he wishes to keep his place/ He is trusting much to the exertions of his friend Sardar-i-Muazzam in Tehran. All the recently-elected members of the Majlis except Sardar-i-Muazzam have left Meshed for Tehran. Haji Ashji-ul-Mulk has been dismissed from the Government of Sarakhs and Nusrat-ul-Mulk, the young Taimuri chief, who is already Governor of Zurabad, has been appointed in his place. Nusrat-ul-Mulk will send a deputy to Sarakhs. Secret.- —The Karguzar, who was taken to task by the Persian Foreign Minister for his unsuccessful handling of the Zushk affair, has explained that he had great difficulty in dissuading the Russians from taking further action, and has complained of accounts of the affair published in the Tehran newspapers, which he describes as false and inflammatory. It has been decided that the punishment of the Zushkis' who fired on the Cossacks shall be left to the Governor-General. Persian Affairs. A chubdar named Muhammad was stabbed in the abdomen during the week by a butcher named Sharif in the course of a quarrel. He was brought to the Consulate General Hospital but died after admission. Rais-ut-Tujjar, who has lost the concession for repairing the Meshed-Bajgiran road, is still attempting to levy tolls on carriages and the Karguzar is secretly assist ing him. There have been two or three fires in the city during the week. Russian Affairs. See diary for the week ending August 8th. Hoffmann, the German shopkeeper, has met the end which I anticipated for him. Shortly before 7 p.m. on October 25th, he was brought to our hospital severely wounded. His right fore-arm had been cut off and was hanging by the skin, he had two sword cuts on the head which hadAeft the skull, and sword cuts on the shoulder and back. It seems that he was drunk and had been boasting to a Cossack of German victories and speaking disrespectfully of the Tzar. The Cossack, who was also drunk, ran to fiis room for his sword and cut Hoffmann about in the manner described, chasing him down the street. The man was brought to our hospital by the Persian police. He died on the morning of October 28. He brought his end on himself. The Cossack is under arrest. * • The Russian agent at Sabzawar has been causing trouble by his unwarrantable interference in disputes between Persians. A$fa Riza, Rais-ut-Tujjar, is endeavouring to obtain active assistance from my Colleague in his land dispute at Kasimabad with Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, but he is not likely to succeed. My Colleague is refusing to meet the Persian demand for compensation for the death of the revenue gendarme killed by Cossack near Chinaran. He insists that the gendarme attacked the Cossacks. Madame Nicolsky and her three children arrived at Meshed yesterday. M. Nicolsky forstalled the Karguzar’s complaints regarding the Hoffmann incident by complaining that the Karguzar was to blame for not prohibiting the sale of liquor by Hoffmann and others to the troops.

The dyers of Turbat-i-Haidari have taken sanctuary in the telegraph office and refuse to pay the taxes demanded of them. Kariz News. The Hazara and Bakharzi sowars are still in sanctuary in the Russian camp. Their officers demand 7,500 tumans, for which they hold a draft, m cash, and the local official of the Finance Department is vainly endeavouring to persuade them to accept half the payment in kind. Herat News. The boundary pillar commissioners are detained at Murghab owing to a dispute with regard to the correct boundary line at the Band-i-Jm Karsh!, which the Rus sians wish to carry 3,000 feet south of the line for which the Afghans contend. An Afghan spy reports that German agents are at work in those parts of the Russian dominions where there are Musalmans and throw papers at mght into the houses of Musalmans. These papers represent Germany as the friend of Islam and explain that her object is to free Turkey and Persia from Russian and British influence. The owners of sheep have been cautioned not to export any sheep beyond the borders of Afghanistan. They have been told that if any of them infringes this order his sheep will be confiscated and he will be fined 20,000 krans. The Amir has instructed the Governor and the Officer Commanding the troops to work in harmony together. Political Summary. Condition of Country. Muhammad Kurshabadi is still at large with a following of 50 or 60 sowars. After raiding the neighbourhood of Gunabad he has returned to that of Nishabur. The Governor-General has ofiered a reward of 500 tumans for his head. 1 It is reported from Chinaran that twelve armed men entered the house of the offi cial of the Finance Department at Bizki and carried off all his property and 81 tumans of public money. The robbers are believed to have been Kuchanis. Kuchan is in a disturbed condition owing the the absence of the Governor, A’dal-ud-Dauleh, who is still in Meshed and will probably not return to Kuchan. , Condition of Roads. During the week a caravan was attacked and robbed tv^o farsaldis, from Ku chan. One of the robbers has been caught and his capture will probably lead to that of the others. The Tehran road is probably unsafe as Muhammad Kurshabadi is in its neigh bourhood. The War. The Tws newspaper continues to publish news “ made in Germany, ” and it has been ascertained that the editor receives drafts from Tehran, probably from an agent of the German Legation. The Karguzar has expressed his inability to suppress the paper. M. Nicolsky tells me that he intends to warn the proprietor of the press, who is a Russian subject. If the warning is ineffectual I shall not be surprised if the editor chares the fate of Hoffmann. T. W.

Russo-Persian and Russo-Afghan frontier. —The Russian War Minister has for sheep and goats (3f d.), with effect from January 14th, 1915. This measure, which will not apply to Bokharan flocks and herds, may be the cause of frontier incidents. 528. Austrian prisoners in Turldstan. —The 10,000 prisoners of war, who are being sent to Turkistan, are to be distributed as follows :—to Tashkent, 3,000 ; to Samarkand, 3,000 ; to Skobelef, 2,000 ; to Askhabad, 2,000 ; officers to Khojend. The following have already arrived at Askhabad, where the barracks of the 18th Turkistan Rifle Regiment have been prepared for their reception October 11th, 950 ; October 16th, 1,000 ; about half of these belong to the Orthodox Greek Church! The local branches of the Departments for Agriculture and Government Lands have applied for an allotment of 800 prisoners, in connection with road and irriga tion construction works in the Tashkent and Aulie Ata districts. In view of the difficulty, recently experienced {reference paragraphs 396 and 453), in collecting labour, it is probable that Austrian prisoners will be employed on the construction of the Oxus railway. 529. Russian troops in Northern Persia.—The Russian press continues to report daily collisions between Russian troops and Turkish Kurds on tne frontier of Urumia. In the phase, ending on October 2nd, some 600 Kurds are said to have been killed ; their chief, Karki Kerim Khan, has tendered his submission to the Rus sian Vice-Consul at Urumia. 530. Russian concentration; Russo-Turkish frontier .—Several trains, conveying Russian troops, including the 263rd infantry regiment (of the 3rd Caucasus Army Corps) and another regiment,, or battery, (without badges, and therefore probably reservists, Military Attache), together withheld guns (not enumerated, Military Attache), were observed between Baku and Rostof, about September 30th, proceed ing towards Baku, destination said to be Tihis.

It is said that the Division is to be employed as escort to transport. The balance of the consignment of 1,000 Turko man recruits, sent to Askhabad from Merv at the end of September {reference paragraph 487 a) are employed as guards for the protection of the Central Asian railway, there is no truth in the rumour, recorded in paragraph 509 (a).

Russo-Afghan relations. —Representations recently made to the authori ties in Tashkent by Russian contractors against Afghan encroachments and the collection of the pistachio-nut crop on the Russo-Afghan frontier, have met with no success. The monopoly of this valuable commodity has hitherto yielded an annual income of 20,000 roubles to Russian contractors. In view of the prompt attention which has always been given in the past to all such representations against Afghan and Persian indifference to Russian rights, e.g., in the matter of water-supply, the locust-p/st, etc., the fact that no attention is now being paid to the complaint that Afghan nut-collectors have encroached on Russian territory for a distance of two miles, indicates the extent to which the Russian authorities are preoccupied with more urgent affairs. • 538. Austrian prisoners in TurJcistan. —A consignment of 1,400 Austrian pri soners of war arrived in Tashkent, October 21st. 539. German emissaries in Turkistan and Khorasan. —A reliable informant, a native of Persia, states that he saw three German emissaries in Krasnovodsk on October 16th. (b) His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Meshed, has received official information that German emissaries are on their way from Turkey, with the object of reaching Afghanistan through Persia. Preventive measures are being taken. (c) The German subject, Hoffmann {reference paragraphs 485 and 300), was brought into the British hospital at Meshed on October 25th, with severe sword- wounds inflicted by a trooper of the 1st Semirechia Cossack Regiment, whom he had enraged by indiscreet taunts against Russian troops. Hoffmann died on October 28th. (d) The Persian press in Meshed, in spite of the suppression of the newspaper, Nau Bahar, continues to publish news calculated to influence the Persian read ing public in favour of Germany and Austria. Military. : 540. Russian troops in North Persia. — (а) Khcrasan. —The strength of the Russian garrison, October 27th, was as follows :— Meshed, and road, Meshed-Kuchan :—303 officers and men, 1st Semi rechia Regiment, with two machine-guns ; 23 men, 1st Taman Cossack Regiment (consular guard) with two machine- guns ; Kuchan, and road, Kuchan-Gaudan :—376 officers and men, 1st Semi rechia Regiment, with two machine-guns. The Officer Commanding and the Adjutant, 1st Semirechia Cossack Regi ment left Meshed on a visit to Kuchan, October 27th. On October 24th, the Officer Commanding received a communication from Tashkent, intimating that his regiment would be supplied with field transport, etc., at Tashkent. It appears that the intend ed visit of General Fidarof {reference paragraph 515-b) has been cancelled. The officers, 1st Semirechia Cossack Regiment, now hope to be relieved shortly by a Siberian Cossack Regiment and to pro ceed on field service.

Communications. 543. Rolling stock on Russian railways. —The present need for more .rolling stock on railways in Kussia is so urgent that the Minister for Ways of Communica tion has telegraphed to the Chiefs of the Tashkent and Central Asian railways, requesting the immediate despatch of as many wagons of the Tieplushka type as are now being used on those railways for shelters and dwelling places. These wagons are to be replaced by mud-huts or barracks, constructed with old sleepers and tele graph poles. (Press, October 23rd.) The wagons are probably required for the winter accommodation of Russian troops, guarding the railways, leading to the German and Austrian frontiers. 544- Oocus railway. —The strength of the gendarmerie on the Central Asian railway has been increased with effect from August 20th, 1914, by two superin tendents, two quartermasters, and 44 non-commissioned officers, for employment on the Kaghan-Termez and the Karshi-Kitab lines. The cost of this addition is to be met by the Oxus Railway Company. Work on the construction of the line is proceeding, not only without inter ruption but at increased pressure.

Afghan robbers.—On the 4th instant, a caravan of about 15 camels m charge of 8 Sarhaddi Reki Baluchis was proceeding laden with wheat from bistan towards Koh Malik Siah. At Karkaruki, near Reg Chah, it was waylaid by nine robbers, eight of whom were mounted on camels and the ninth on a horse. The robbers fired on the caravan men, killing 4 and putting the rest to flight. They then threw the loads off the camels and decamped with the animals The other camel-men returned to Lutak, whence fresh transport was despatched and the grain was taken back there. The identity of the robbers has not yet been discovered, but it is believed that they are Afghans from EKidbar. /£/- On hearing the news, I at once requested the local authorities to reinforce the guards along the Trade Route, and 12 sowars and 8 jambazes were promptly sent out from Sistan.

I would particularly like to seize the six vi lages m Sistan which Hashmat-ul-Mulk farms from the Govern ment but unless the Finance Agent is first ordered to remain at least neutral I fear that he wd! actively oppose any attempt of this sort. Ebtihaj-us-Sultan is un doubtedly anti-foreign in his sympathies ; he has already begun to give expression to his hopes for the success of Germany and Turkey in the war. The Governor of Kainat and Sistan.~Kw Excellency has informed Mr. Vice- Consul New that he has postponed his departure for Sistan to about the first of December next. _ It appears that as he was absent in Tehran all the month of Muharram last year his mother has worked on him to spend at least the first half of the month at home now. The Indo-European Telegraph Line Extension.—The line was completed, and direct telegraphic communication between Sistan and Robat established on the 31st October. For the present, at any rate, there will be no telephone offices along the line, even at Koh Malik Siah, as it is not desired that any interruption of through messages should be possible. It is believed that the local authorities will T t° r a f ddltl . on of a ^parate wire with offices at Lutak, Girdi and Koh Malik Siah. kmch an installation would not only be of the greatest value to the Revenue and Customs Departments, but also would materially serve the Governor and the Military Commander on the occasion of Afghan and Sarhaddi raids. The War with Turkey.—The Karguzar informed me officially on the 6th November that the Persian Government intend to maintain the strictest neutrality He has subsequently received a second telegram from Tehran instructing him to prevent persons from even subscribing to a fund for the assistance of any of the belligerents. f rp fc ^ 9 3rd ^stant, he was informed by cypher telegram that a small deputation 1 o f lurkish and German officers was believed to be about to cross the frontier into I Afghanistan. I heard of this message first from the Deputy Governor, who was I jnformed bj' the Persian Telegraphist in whose office the telegram was de-cyphered. The Karguzar has, however, since informed me about it himself, asking that I the communication may be kept secret. He has issued orders to all passport I officers to look out for and detain persons answering to the description given. As regards Afghanistan, I hear that 800 students of Derawat and Zindawar [both places described as two stages (? to the north) from Girishkf set out on about the 26th October to wage ghaza (religious war) against the Shias of Kadeh (about 20 miles east of Chakhansur) and afterwards to attack Persian Sistan.

I hear that the notorious Ghulam Khan died in Kandahar about two months ago BnlvrTi Haiders —Alishah Khan has protested through Mr. Gabler against the treatment accorded to his fellow-tribesman Barfi recently by the Sistan authorities. It appears that Mirza Khan has recently stated in Birjand that Barfi disposed of some of the former’s looted goats in Sistan itself. Sardar Pasand Khan was, therefore, sent X Barfi to take an account of the animals from him According to the Deputy Governor’s statement Barfi was made to give a bond for 200 Tomans to be paid if his guilt should be afterwards established. Barfi himself says that he gave the security in cash with 30 Tomans in addition. Barfi has already been in confine ment for some weeks during the hot weather as a suspect It appears now that Alishah Khan expects the Telegraph Department to protect all Naruis!

The editor of the “ Nau Bahar, who has been elected to the Majlis for Daragaz, has received 70 tnmans from the Governor-General for his travelling expenses to Tehran and should shortly be leaving Meshed. Ismail and Akbar Buland, who were concerned in the murder at Daragaz, are imprisoned in the police prison at Meshed. The people of Daragaz want Ismail there in order that they may dispose of him after their own fashion and the Governor- General has promised to send him to Daragaz after his trial. Akbar Buland, who was once a servant of the Bussian Consulate-General, is not likely to be publicly executed, but there is some idea of shooting him in prison on the pretext of an at tempted escape. See last week’s diary. Husain Khan, Karasuran, one of the men who connived at the escape of Muhammad Kurshabadi, has been flogged before the Governor- General. Naib Shakur and Shukrullah, the other two men wanted for the same offence, have fled with 30 or 40 sowars. Russian Affairs. It is reported that a Russian General Officer will shortly be coming to Meshed to enquire into the recent action of Colonel Gushchin. Meshedi Abdullah, Karabaghi, has been appointed Russian Tajirbashi. Kasim Baig, the late Tajirbashi, is much annoyed and may create trouble for the Russians here. My colleague has received orders to the effect that Russian subjects are not to pay the navagil tax and I have consequently advised British subjects not to pay it. Bee last week’s diary. A hundred recruits arrived at Meshed yesterday. M. Nicolsky and M. Romanovsky are not on good terms. M. Nicolsky has asked the Karguzar not to discuss questions with M. Romanovsky, as he is not to be trusted. M. Nicolsky appears to work exclusively through Arfa-ul-Mamalik, the head munshi of the Consulate-General, while M. Romanovsky works with the second munshi. Three hundred Bakharzi sowars in the service of Shuja-ul-Mulk, the Hazara chief, have taken sanctuary in the Russian camp at Karez as they have received no pay, and are obstructing the collection of the revenue. Two Russian Cossacks have recently plundered a shopkeeper at Mulli near Chinaran. They afterwards shot and killed a sowar of the revenue gendarmerie and took his rifle. M. Romanovsky has gone to Chinaran to inquire into the case. Turbat-i-Haidari News. The Russian Consul at Turbat-i-Haidari has given offence to the Governor of Turshiz by appointing as Russian agent there Meshedi Muhammad Yezdi, an illiterate man who was formerly a post carrier. Herat News. Naib Salar, after investigating the charges against the sepoys confined in the military prison, has sent the men back to prison and reported the result of his in vestigations to Kabul. Naib Salar is unfortunately not on good terms with the Governor, of whom he speaks disparagingly to the military officers. It seems that the Governor has refused to compel the shopkeepers of the town to sell provisions to the troops at specially low rates and has protested against the practice of sending officers into the surrounding villages to force the villagers to sell sheep at arbitrarily fixed rates.

Russian troops in North Persia .— {a) Per so-Turhisii relations. The Persian Government, having received a notification from Turkey that the presence of Russian troops on the Perso-Turkish frontier constitutes a breach of Persian neutrality, has requested the Russian Government to remove the Russian troops now in Azerbaijan. {Russian press, October 3rd.) {b) Khorasan. —General Fidarof, Commanding 1st Turkistan Cossack Divi sion at Samarkand, is expected daily in Meshed, on a visit of inspec tion and in connection with the investigation of the circumstances of the recent disturbances. . [Reference paragraphs 499 and 509 (6)] 120 recruits, for the 1st Semirechia Cossack Regiment, stationed at Kuchan and Meshed (without rifles) arrived at Meshed from Askhabad, October 15th. 516. Austrian prisoners in Turkistan. officers and 1,400 men, Austrian [ prisoners of war, were despatched from Kief, September 24th, to Turkistan; 54 officers and 1,113 men, arrived at Tashkent, about 1st October, and 2,500 of all ranks passed through Tashkent, October 5th, for Skobolef and Samarkand ; 2,000 are expected at Askhabad and Merv. At Tashkent the barracks of the 5th Oren burg Cossack and 2nd Turkistan Rifle Regiments have been prepared for the recep tion of these prisoners. 517. Cotton. —The tax on Russian cotton, the crop of which for the current year is estimated at a quarter of a million tons, will yield 23 million roubles, i.e., £2,000,000 even at the depreciated rate of 11J roubles per £l. {Press, October 6th). 518. Oil. —The legal price of kerosine in the province of Sir Darya has been fixed at 5s. Id. per pood (36 lbs.), or Ifd. per lb. 519. Horses. —The horses, requisitioned in Turkistan, for military purposes, during the recent mobilisation, have been found suited, in the highest degree, after short training, to draught transport work. They are intelligent, learn quickly, and are accustomed to short rations and little attention. {Press, October 6th.) The Central Administration of Government Stuis, in view of the urgent neces sity for the preservation of native-bred horses in Turkistan, by making the best possible use of the uncultivated lands in the district, which have been set aside for horse-breeding, has elaborated a scheme for the development of stud-farming and horse-breeding in Turkistan. This scheme, which has received Imperial sanc tion and is actually being put into execution, provides for the following measures :— {a) The building of a nursery, with stud-stables, in Trans-Caspia, for thorough-bred Teke (Turkoman) horses ; the existing zemski stables and small nursery for Teke mares indicate the first step in the desired direction. (6) The payment of cash premia for the services of privately owned Teke stallions, and for the registration of thorough-bred Teke horses. (c) The building of stud-stables in Semirechia. {d) The introduction of fresh blood into the horse-farms in Sir Darya by the substitution of European-bred for locally-bred stallions on the farms. {e) The increase of the number of existing serving stations. (f) The loan of lands for pasturage to the leading Kirghiz horse-breeders 17th, 1914. History.

These statistics are of use in estimating the numbers of reservists, resident in Turkistan). (c) 14-4 per cent of the population live in towns, the remainder m country ^ ^ villages and outlying districts. (This fact accounts for the length o time necessary for the mobilization of reservists ; the experience of the recent mobilization showed that the reservists of the Merv district were not assembled until the 17th day of mobilization.

Mobilization .— (a) Railway traffic.—The reopening of normal passenger traffic on the Cen tral Asian Railway, October 7th, indicates that the transfer of troops and stores to Russia, is nearly completed. (5) Reservists. —Cfctain reservists, who had been called to the colours, have been permitted to return to their civil employments, e.g., teachers in national schools. {Press, October 6th). Information, dated October 2nd, states that the town of Baku is by no means denuded of young men, fit for military service, who are continuing to carry on their civil occupations. Details have been received regarding the reservists, assembled at Merv :— Resident in Merv town ... 900 Resident at Bairam Ali .. 600 Resident at Yolatan, Takhta Bazar, Kushk .. 700 Total .. 2,200: these joined by the 17th day of mobilization.

(c) Troops despatched to Russia. —Reliable information, received from Baku, confirms reports, already submitted, to the effect that the troops, despatched from Turkistan, via Krasnovodsk, were despatched toKars and not to Western Russia. The despatch of the following additional troops is reported :— Vid Tashkent. —September— 23rd—500 men, 1st Turkistan Sapper Battalion, with 100 two-wheeled carts, and 300 horses. 25th 150 men, Turkistan Artillery Brigade, number not specified, without guns.

General. . 0ur claim gainst Hashmat-ul-MulJc. —The efforts of Shaukat-ul-Mulk men tioned in last week’s diary unfortunately ended unsuccessfully. In consequence, on my arrival at Sahlabad, I proceeded to attach that village and on the followins day ! took similar action as regards Firuzabad. The Governor’s Mamur, Naib Ghulam Raza, and the latter s companion, Muhammad Hasan, who had together followed me from Birjand supported me most agreeably and fell in with all my suggestions. I made a full enquiry into the system of cultivation in force and as regards the division of the produce, and arranged to take over, through my Deputy a 1 the responsibilities and rights of the owners Hissam-ud-Dauleh and Hashmat-ul- Muik. lueir Kaakhuda, Ismail, was informed that his presence was no longer required, and his house was given over to my ‘ghulam’ who has been left temporarily in charge. r J All the landlords’ grain (amounting roughly to half their share of the produce of last crop) stored m the villages was confiscated and placed under the Consulate Seal The gram captured m Firuzabad was removed for greater security to Sahlabad. We altogether attached 86 kharwars (Kami) and 18 mans of wheat (32,011 lbs ) and 4 kharwars and 58 mans of barley (1,700 lbs.) besides c ’ full of ‘'kahs' (chopped straw) and c mandab ’ (seeds of a bitter oil) which were not weighed but sealed up. The sale of these stocks will probably realise quite 800 Tomans in Birjand. The grain was carefully weighed in the presence of the landlord’s representa tive, and a statement of the quantities was furnished to him under my signature At the same time I had the good fortune to learn that a herd of 100 breeding camels* comprising one male, 59 females and 40 young animals, was grazing m the scrub 8 miles away from Sahlabad. The Darogha (man in charge of the herd) had come in that very day to receive from Kadkhuda Ismail the year’s wages of himself and his assistants in the form of grain. I determined to seize these animals, and sent out a party under the guidance of one of the Darogha’s men to drive them in. The capture was successfully accomplished and as the camel-men refused to accompany me down to Sistan, I gave the Darogha a paper stating what I had done, and have arranged to engage men from stage to stage, who will assist my escort in driving the herd to Sistan. Though the animals may not be worth more than 3,000 Tomans, their seizure seems most appropriate and opportune seeing that a part of our claim against Hashmat-ul-Mulk is on account of camels looted at Neh. The attitude of the people of Sahlabad and Firuzabad, I must confess, rather agreeably surprised me. They showed no displeasure at our action, and towards the end of our stay seemed quite pleased at the idea of changing masters. They readilv furnished all the information I required of them. ' y As regards Gib, it was arranged, on Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s own suggestion when I was bidding him ‘ good-bye that Mr. New should go there with another Mamur.

Mansur-ul-Mulk’s party is said to be organizing in Daragaz a demonstration which will probably end in the expulsion of Mustafa Mirza, the new Governor. I hear that my Russian Colleague is highly displeased with the Karguzar and has complained to Tehran of his corruption and indolence, demanding his dis missal. I also hear that M. Nicolsky has complained to Tehran of Nayyir-ud-Daulah’s venality. I hear that Nayyir-ud-Daulah has decided to comply with the demand of the Ministers that he should pay a benevolence of 50,000 tumans. A’dal-ud-Daulah, Governor of Kuchan, is still in Meshed. The Russians will probably press for his reinstatement, in spite of his unpopularity. . * Persian Affairs. The people of Sarakhs have taken sanctuary in the Telegraph Office there as a protest against the new taxes. The employes of the Department of Finance at Shirwan have had a drunken quarrel, in the course of which one of them has been killed. The murderer has been imprisoned. Russian Affairs. See last week’s diary. Colonel Gushchin, commanding the 1st Semirechia Cossacks, contrived to obtain orders from the Governor-General of Russian Turkis- tan, which apparently supersede the Consul-General’s authority, directing him to despatch a punitive expedition against the Persians who had attacked his men. Accordingly 80 Cossacks and two machine guns were sent from Meshed and a similar force from Kuchan against Zushk. Both Colonel Gushchin and Colonel Scouratt, the Military Attache, accompanied the force. I believe they found Zushk deserted. There are stories in the town of mischief done by the Cossacks in the villages but before they had taken any serious operations orders were received from Petrograd directing them to return to Meshed and to take no further steps until an enquiry had been held. The Cossacks have now returned to Meshed. This affair has excited much ill-feeling against Russians and on the night of October 6th fugitives from villages traversed or occupied by the Cossacks prevented the Mujtahids from offering prayers in the Mosque of the Shrine and abused the Mutwalli Bashi and the Aghazada. Both my Colleague and Colonel Gushchin now say that no enquiry is necessary j as Colonel Gushchin discovered who the people were who had attacked the Cossacks. He says that they were eleven robbers of Zushk and is inclined to press for their arrest but the Karguzar has informed M. Nicolsky that if the Russians could not catch them it was not likely that the Persians will be able to do so. The Cossacks have destroyed their houses in Zushk and I think the matter will now probably be allowed to drop. One hundred and fifty Cossacks with 11 four-wheeled waggons and 5 carts passed through Persian Bajgiran on the morning of October 9th for Meshed. These are probably recruits. There is some trouble regarding the appointment of a new Ressian Tajirbashi. M. Nicolsky is inclined to appoint Meshedi Abdullah, but he does not know Rus sian. M. Romanovsky advocates the reinstatement of Kasim Baig, but Russian subjects are vehemently protesting against this. The father and elder brother of Kardash Bala have been released by M. Nicolsky on their furnishing security that they will return at once to Rrisia. India, F'&gt;re on Secreian. . * No 4 ^ M, d 4 ted , 19 NOV 19142 A Russian General Officer has recently visited Russian Sarakhs and minutely inspected the frontier. The Governor of Russian Sarakhs has told the Governor of Persian Sarakhs that a railway line will be run to the former place, that it will be fortified, and that the district will be thoroughly colonized. Turbat-i-Haidari News. The Governor of Turbat-i-Haidari has recently permitted the escape of Ata Muhammed, a well-known robber, in consideration of bribe of 700 tumans. Kariz News. The Russian Assistant Medical Officer has left for Turbat-i-Haidari from which place his relief and the Commandant of Kariz are expected to arrive. Herat News. Owing to the war the value of the Russian paper money has so decreased that nobody in Herat will purchase it. Russian gold, on the Contrary, is in great demand and the price of the 5-rouble piece has risen from 30 to 32 krans. An Afghan spy reports that a German General Officer (?) who was travelling on the frontier and intended to visit Ashkabad as a spy was shot by a Russian frontier guard and died a day later, and that some papers were found on him. There are said to be now only 2,000 Russian troops in Shaikh Junaid and Panjdeh. The Russian Military Authorities have retained 2,000 horses collected by them from the Turkomans but have returned the rest to their owners, after registering them. Orders are said to have been received from Petrograd to the effect that the Turkomans are to be well treated. It is said, however, that the Russian Author ities are levying 20 roubles a month on each flock of sheep, as a war contribution. The Colonel lately commanding at Kara Tepe has left for the front with a number of MujiJcs, probably reservists. Political Summary. Condition of Country. —Muhammad Kurshabadi is still at large. Informa tion is received from time to time that he is being besieged in some fort or sangar and the next that is heard of him is that he has escaped and cut the telegraph line, or has robbed a caravan, or robbed the post waggon and stripped the travel lers. I have protested strongly against the failure to afford adequate protection to the telegraph line. The Persian troops sometimes probably permit the man to escape through cowardice, but on one occasion certainly he has been allowed to escape through sympathy and two men have been deprived of their appointments in the road police for conniving at his escape. The latest news of him is that he • is being besieged in the hills by Barbari sawars and Persian troops. Afghan robbers have carried off two flocks of sheep from Baghbaghi into Afghanistan. Condition of Roads. It is said that three hundred Turkomans are preparing to make a raid on the Meshed-Tehran road and that the Chief of Bujnurd is taking steps to cut them off. •Four men have robbed the post on the Daragaz road.

I ma( J-ul-Mamalik, Governor of Gunabad, having caused to be publicly beaten Mu m-ul-Ashraf, a respectable inhabitant of that place, has been dismissed. See iast week’s diary. A’dal-ud-Daulah, Governor of Kuchan, arrived in Mes ed on October 1 st m connection with the complaints against him. The Governor-General is much annoyed by his leaving Kuchan and has appointed imad-us-bultanah to hold current charge of the duties of the post. Izz-ul-Mamalik, the dismissed Karguzar of Birjand, has been appointed Karguzar of Daragaz. rr According to complaints received from Turbat-i-Haidari, Mushir-ul-Vizara, the acting Karguzar there, has been little more than an assistant to the Russian Consul. He has now been replaced by Mujallal-us-Saltanah. Ayub Khan,lately Chief of the Court of Justice at Turbat-i-Haidari, has been appointed Passport Officer there. IV Murtaza Kuli Tabatabai, who has been reinstated as Mutawalli Bashi, arrived quietly in Meshed on the evening of October 2 . The election of Najd-us-Saltanah as a member of the Majlis has been disallow ed and he has been re-appointed Deputy-Governor-General, thus disappointing Had Khazin-ul-Malk, Prince Nayyir-ud-Daulah’s son-in-law. It ^is notified that the following have been elected members of the Majlis for Meshed : ( 1 ) Sardar-i- Mu’azzam, ( 2 ) Tmad-us-Saltanah, (3) Mutawalli-yi-Masjid, (4) Shaikh Muhammad Jawad, Bullur-farush. Persian Affairs. Akbar Buland and Ismail, who were concerned in the murder of Mirza Mas’ud Khan, have been brought into Meshed and lodged in the police jail. Bihbud another of the murderers, is still at large. The dead body of Hasan Karasuran, a sowar of the Persian road guards, has been brought into Kuchan. He is said to have been shot dead by Russian ’Cossacks five farsakhs to the north of Kuchan. Rvssian Affairs. A. very infortunate incident has occurred here. Of three Russian Cossacks returning from carrying the post out to the first stage on the Kuchan road on the night of September 24th two received sword cut wounds, one on the head and the other on the hand. The Cossacks returned to Meshed and reported that they had been attacked by 20 Persians at Muhammadabad. Colonel Gushchin, commanding the 1 st Semirechia Cossacks, at once sent out on the morning of September 25th without consulting the Russian Consul-General, a punitive force of 20 Cossacks under the command of Lieutenant Jansen, accompanied by Lieutenant Volkoff. The party began to loot Muhammadabad, but were apparently directed to Zushk in the Binalud hills as the most likely place in which to find the robbers. They handl ed the inhabitants of Zushk and neighbouring villages somewhat roughly and are said to have raped two women, whose names are given. The party was fired on in a defile and Lieutenant Volkoff and one Cossack were severely wounded. The Cossack has since died. Seven bodies of Persians shot by the Cossacks have been brought in and the Cossacks say that they killed about 20 . On September 29th I wrote to M. Nicolsky asking him whether he could see me in connection with the affair and he replied that he was attending the Cossack’s funeral that afternoon, but would be glad to see me on his return. He also tried to persuade me to commit myself by attending the Cossack’s funeral with my escort, but I replied that I should prefer first to know the circumstances of the man’s death. C558FD2 . i i 'Uof rH«+nrhprl and he blamed Colonel Gushchin for I found M. Nicolsky somewhat disturbed^andne^ ^ sma]1 a £orce Re having acted precipitate y an affair and I told him frankly that the asked me what account a Cossacks had fought among themselves and had Persians were saying that t i- „ 0 m cer He said that he believed this story to fight. , , t . i t to believe that the story which i Unfortunately e r at Muhammadabad says that when the Cossack movements^of^Vlarge^ bod^ as 20 were found at the spot where the incident occurred. T told M Nicolskv Ihrt I hoped that in view of the possible excitement among the Cnssacte steps’would be taken to prevent any.fnrther disturbance and he replied that he was doing his best in this direction. T honed at first that M. Nicolsky would welcome a full inquiry into the matter i ^Ttbc fonsulate-Geneial, the Cossacks and the Karguzan would be represented but I learn that he now insists that the only enquiry necessary- is a search for the original as B dlants of the Cossacks m order that they may be pums . The Karguzar addressed to M. Nickolsky a long letter of protest which M Nicolsky wished to return, but the Karguzar refused to receive it. He the “ s™* him by the hand of the chief Munshi of the Russian Consulate-General, a reply but the Karguzar was in bed when the Munshi arrived and before the letter could be delivered a ^messenger came from the Consulate-General to say that it was no to be delivered. The Munshi telephoned to the Consulate-General for verification of this message and was told that a Cossack officer had just called on M. Nicolsky and that after some conversation with him M. Nicolsky had decided that the tetter should not be delivered. The Karguzar ascertained, however, from the Mun that the letter was to the effect that the Cossacks had certainly been attacked and that the only action needed was a search for and the punishment of their assailants. M. Nicolsky has made special enquiries for the purpose of ascertaining whether I am taking advantage of this incident to stir up ill-feeling against the Russians. I am informed that Russian subjects have been ordered to pay to the Russian Consul-General all revenues due by them to the Persian Government. /Secret—The Karguzar has been ordered to refrain from helping Rais-ut-Tujjar in the matter of the concession for repairs to the Kuchan-Bajgiran road, which are to be carried out by the Finance Department. |. A Ghulam of the Russian Consulate-General was recently placed at the disposal of Rais-ut-Tujjar to assist him in his dispute with Ibrahim Khan regarding t e village of Kasimabad, but was prevented by Ibrahim KhaKs agent from entering Kasimabad. Rais-ut-Tujjar is now trying to persuade M. Nicolsky to place some Russian Cossacks at his disposal, but will probably not succeed as M. JNieolSKy had more trouble than he cares for in connection with the Cossacks. Herat News. The sepoys at present confined in the Civil Jails at Herat have, at the Naib Salar’s request, been transferred to the Military Jail. _ . The Naib Salar has taken steps to prevent the sepoys from robbing or ill-usmg shopkeepers in the bazar. Tbe Russians are said to be levying from tie Turkomans a special war contri bution for the Russian wounded/ Wealthy men are expected to pay 100 rouble , those of the middle class 50 rovbles, and those of the poorer classes 10 roubles. t One thousand Turkomans are guarding the telegraph wires. Jamshidis are also employed on this duty.The Turkomans have been called upon to supply camels for transport purposes in case of need. Every four Turkomans are expected to supply one camel and a driver is to be supplied for every four camels. The camels registered and returned to their owners after registration number 1,500. Political Summary. Condition of Country. Muhammad Kurshabadi is still at large with 60 followers in the hills above Nishabur and has been plundering villages and threatens to attack Nishabur. He was attacked on September 25 by a force of Persian sowars under Agha Bala Khan, but defeated them killing eight of them and wounding their leader. Troops and ammunition have been collected, but the troops display no anxiety to come to close quarters with Muhammad. Condition of Roads. Yesterday a caravan was robbed at Hauz-i-Khushk, four or five farsahhs from Meshed, on the Zurabad road, and merchandise worth 582 tumans was taken from a British Indian subject. The robbers are said to have been Barbaris. The Governor-General. Prince Nayyir-ud-Daulah remains on excellent terms with this Consulate- General and is very obliging in all cases referred to him. I hope there is no foundation for rumours of his approaching dismissal. The War. The newspaper Nau Bahar has reappeared by permission. War intelligence “ Made in Germany ” is absent from the new number. It is reported that the Russian Government has sent 10,000 Austrian prisoners to Turkistan for distribution and 1,000 will be lodged at Askhabad. T. W.

I have informed His Excellency Shaukat- ul-Mulk, verbally, that Ahshah Khan and Taj Muhammad Khan, Naruis, brothers of Mirza Khan, the prisoner have openly threatened to hold Mr. Gabler responsible for any harm that may befall their brother. - 1 _ His Excellency replied that he had no intention of punishing Mirza Khan other wise than with imprisonment for the present, and that, if he can come to satisfactory terms with the Sarhaddis after his arrival m Sistan, the man will in due course be released. This reply entirely accords with my anticipation, expressed two weeks ago. His Excellency also promised to instruct his Deputy and nephew at Sistan to acquaint the Sarhaddis informally as to his attitude. ^ Sistan^firstf^ Monsieur Romanovski called on the Deputy Governor The Karguzar, Sistan, in compliance with telegraphic orders just received from Tehran, called on the Vice-Consul first, and received the return call an hour after- wards.

Persian Officials. The Governoi -Gen 6 ral has of late been pestered by the Minister for money. The first proposal that he should raise 200,000 tumans over and above the ordinary revenue and remit the same to Tehran. He replied that this was impossible and the demand was eventually reduced to 50,000 tumans. The Governor-General suggested that the Central Government should raise this sum as a loan from Khorassan, but the Ministers consider that theGovernor-General should collect the sum as an extraordinary contribution or, if necessary, pay it out of his own pocket. He naturally does not fall in with this view though he has sounded the Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia on the subject of a loan of 50,000 tumans. He has been informed that the money cannot be lent on the security of the Persian Government, which is worthless, and that if he wishes for the money as a loan to himself he must furnish securities other than real property. He has now suggested to the Ministers that all Khalisa lands should be leased for five years and the whole rent recovered in advance from the lessees, but he deprecates any interference with the Khalisa lands of Daragaz. It is said that Nayyir-ud-Daulah, owing to his inability or unwillingness to oblige the Ministers, is likely to be removed and replaced by Farman Farma. r The people of Daragaz have agreed to accept Mustafa Mirza as their Governor for one month and the Governor-General has promised to appoint Muhammad Riza Khan, brother of Mirza Mas’ud Khan at the end of that time. A meeting was assembled at Kachan to inquire into the complaints against the Governor, A’dal-ud-Daulah. Among others the Telegraph Master, the Karguzar and Agha Shaikh Hasan Mujtahid, recently elected to the Majlis, were present. Agha Shaikh Hasan spoke strongly against the Governor and the meeting broke up in disorder. Persian Affairs. The Persian frontier guard at Sarakhs, consisting of 25 sowars, is agitating for arrears of pay and the sowars threaten to disperse unless their pay is forthcoming. . T * 16 Editor of the A au-Bahar, recently suppressed was at first somewhat boisterous m his resentment. He demanded a trial and threatened, in the event of his failing to obtain justice, to publish articles in the Tehran papers regarding the suppression of his paper. He has since changed his tone, and is now humbly soliciting permission to publish a few more numbers of his paper, on giving security for his good behaviour, in order that he may be in a position to collect arrears of subscriptions before his departure for Tehran. Russian Affairs. The property of Kardash Bala, the fugitive from justice, has been sold by auction. J The Russian Agent at Sabzawar, who is also Manager of the Russian Bank has intervened in a dispute between two Persian subjects and has arrested one of them. ^ M. and Mine. Evreinow left Meshed for Tehran on the morning of September Kasim Beg, the Russian Tajirbashi, has resigned. Three Russian Cossacks bringing the Russian post from Kachan to Meshed were attacked near Muhammadabad by five Persians. One Cossack was wounded and was brought into Meshed on the night of September 25; It is said that 50 Cossacks are being sent from Meshed and 50 from Kachan against the robbers.2 '...ipgp i' See Diary for the week ending August 29. The investigations of the three Russian engineers there mentioned related to the Kashaf Rud and not to the TTari Rud They much appreciated the assistance given them by Muhammad Riza Khan the Passport Official at Meshed, who was deputed to accompany them and who has now returned to Meshed. Muhammad Riza Khan has since been removed from his post, on what ground is not known. Herat News. Four Baluchis of Chakansur who recently undertook to induce Baluchis to migrate from Persia to Afghanistan have returned from Persia to Herat with 51 immigrants who have been sent to Chakansur with orders that land should be given to them free of rent for three years. Orders have been received from Kabul for the despatch of a literate officer and Kot Dafadar from each Regiment to the Military College nn Kabul The Commander of the troops in Herat has also received a copy of the official .drill book Qawa’id-i-Sirajiyyah. The work of the Boundary Pillar Commission has been completed as far as Jangurak. The Russian Consul is no longer interferring in the case between Sharif-ul-Ulama and HajiAgha Muhammad, but his interpreter, who has received a bribe of 200 tumans, is helping the son of Sharif-ul-Ulama. _ Political Summary. Condition of Country. See last week’s Diary. Muhammad of Qurshabad is still at large. He escaped from his village and succeeded in assembling a force of 60 sowars. He stole several post horses on the Tehran road between Nishabur and Sharifabad, and robbed pilgrims and caravans. He also robbed a Ghulam of the Russian Consulate- General and at Fakhr-i-Daud killed an officer of Persian Cossacks and carried off his horse and his arms. He cut the Telegraph wires between Kalat and Fakhr- i-Daud. On September (?) he reached Sharifabad, stole a large sum of public money and killed four Timuri sowars, taking their horses and arms for his men. It is not certain where he is at present, but he is said to have been hard pressed by Persian sowars in the hills above Nishabur. The Governor-General has ordered all the local Governors to raise sowars and send them against him. The Governor-General has recently been guilty of the weakness of pardoning the notorious robber Ali Jauzi and his gang. Condition of Roads. I The road between Kuchan and Meshed is unsafe, as are also those between Meshed and Turba^t-i-Haidari and Nishabur. The post between Turbat-i-Haidri and Gunabad, carrying between two and three thousand tumans was attacked a week or ten days ago by 30 robbers, but sowars from Gunabad arrived in time to drive them off. The War. - ^ There is less excitement regarding the war and the suppression of the Nau-Bahar has had an excellent effect Foolish stories regarding the intervention of Turkey are ceasing to be circulated.

Monsieur Romanovski, Russian Vice-Consul, and party left Birjand for Sistan. , ? T c ^ er -'T? I ^ or 1 Heron ’ His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul, left Sistan tor Kon Malik Siah for the purpose of composing the difficulties that have arisen between the Telegraph Construction officers and their camel-men. General. O ur daim a( l ainst Hashmat-ul-Mulk .—On the 27th September I heard from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran that the Imperial Bank of Persia were being sounded on the subject of a loan to Hisam-ud-Dauleh and his Son. The question' has therefore remained in suspense latterly. Having heard nothing since, I am now preparing a list of estates for the trans fer of which into my custody I shall apply to the Governor. The latter promises to comply with my request. I hear, however, that Hisam-ud-Dauleh is making a tour of his estates and does not intend to return to Birjand until after my de parture. J Baluch Raids .— See Diary No. 38. Sardar Pasand Khan, Alam Khan, Parya, Hammal and five other Baluchis had their interview early in the week with the' Governor, and were then given permission to return to Sistan. His Excellency gave them four robes of honour. Badin and two or three others, who seem to be more trusted, have been ordered to stay and will probably accompany His Ex cellency down. The Finance Department.—Two more Mirzas, named Shahzada Fathullah Mirza and Rahman Agha, have arrived in Birjand from Tehran on their way to Sistan. I was apparently mistaken in reporting in last week’s Diary the arrival of Wali Muhammad Mirza at Birjand. The name of the officer who is accompanying Mirza Mustafa Khan to Tehran is, I understand, Shams-ud-Din Mirza, of the Revenue Gendarmerie. One of the three Mirzas who passed through Birjand on the 31st August (see Diary No. 36) has reached Koh Malik Siah. His name is Mirza Muhammad Ali Khan. He takes the place of Mirza Abu Turab the suicide. Russian Affairs .— (I) See Diary No. 31. The Karguzar of Birjand and the Russian Vice-Consul never exchanged visits after all! The final order received by the Karguzar from the Foreign Ministry at Tehran reached him near the end of the month of Ramazan. It was to the effect that he should wait a little to see if M. Romanovski would call upon him, and if he did not he should himself pay the first call! About a week before M. Romanovski’s departure for Sistan the Karguzar wrote offering to call. No notice was taken of his communication for five days, and then the Russian Commercial Agent, Rajab Ali Habiboff, wrote to him that the Consul would receive him that afternoon. The language used in referring to the Vice-Consul “ Bandagan-i-Hazrat Ashraf-i-Ajal ” was so' sub servient and so disparaging to the dignity of the addressee, that the Karmizar at once excused himseli, pleading illness. (II) The merchants and officials of Birjand are commenting on M. Romanovski’s methods of working, which they judge from the following incident Two Afghan camel-men recently contracted with the Nobel (Russian) Com pany of Meshed to carry kerosine oil to Birjand. A few days later the Company wrote to their Birjand Agent to recover 1,330 Krans from the camel-men on arrival No reason for this order was given. The Agent wrote to the Vice-Consul acquaint ing him with the fact, and soliciting his assistance. M. Romanovski promptly wrote to the Governor, stating that the camel-men had stolen the oil and demanding India, Cr: h L i h iv / 'a 3OM0V1S14 tt No 4 .5 1 V dried 5 NOV id14 mm2 their arrest. It is not known whether the Vice-Consul has really received some direct information from Meshed to justify his charge, but the Birjandis are sceptical on the subject. The caravan is now several days overdue and the oil has not reached Birjand. .. The Indo-European Telegraph Line Extension.—\ hear from Koh Malik Siah that the Ike had been carried up to Reg Chah-25 miles from the frontier-on the 22 nd September. The Sistani camel-men were, however, becoming dissatisfied and were threatening to abscond. One owner of 20 camels had started a « 1 a.'of-an after delivering his loads somewhere on the road. He was, h^wevT stopped at Gudi by 'a Dafadar of the Consulate Postal Sowars and wal made to return to Koh Malik Siah. Since then on receipt o a complaint 7rom the Director of Telegraphs in Tehran, I desired His Majesty s Vice-Consul at »an to go out himself! if his medical work permitted^ and ascertain the cause of the men’s discontent. I am told that the Telegraph Department generally try to make their camels carry loads of 600 lbs., while under the Consulate contract we ClY require them to icarry f400, according to the universal rule m India. Throughout the week the‘English Telegraph Clerk in Sistan has been on the sick- list, to the great detriment of our work. SisUm Hospital Figures for September 1914.

The following reports indicate the impending despatch of the 2 nd, 3 rd and 4 th lurkistan Rifle Brigades; no reports are available regarding the 6 th in Semirechia, but officers of the 1 st Semirechia Cossacks, now in Meshed, state that the 1 st and 2 nd Siberian Cossacks have been despatched from Jarkent to the front:— ( 1 ) It is reported from Tashkent that troops from Samarkand and Andijan and part of the 17th Turkistan Rifle Regiment, from Askhabad, were despatched from Tashkent, prior to August 31st. ( 2 ) Reliable information, received from Afghanistan, September 18th states that all is quiet on the Russo-Afghan frontier, and that the regular troops had been replaced by reservists ; it is also reported from Merv that two infantry regiments from Kushk (15th and 16th Turkistan Rifle Regiments) passed through Merv by train, August 30th, in the direction of Tashkent. (3) The 6 th Turkistan Rifle Regiment, which, for some weeks, has been under orders for service, was despatched from Charjui, September l«t, in the direction of Tashkent. (4) Troops in large numbers, with horses, and stores, passed through Merv, by rail, from west to east, August 30th—September 3 rd; but their numbers and identity could not be ascertained owing to the string&amp;ncy of police regulations at Merv railway station. C514FD1 2 15) It is reported from Termer, that the 9th and 10 th Turldstan Rifle Regiments were, on August 25th, awaitmg orders to entrain, and that the two batteries, 3 rd Turkistan Rifle Artillery Division, which marched from Termer to Shahr-i-Sabr, April 26th (reference pam- aravh 327) had returned to Termer, and was also awaiting orders to entrain. An unconfirmed report from Asknabad states that the 9th and 10 th Turkistan Rifle Regiments, with foui batteries of 3^ and 6' guns, was despatched from Askhabad to Kars, via Krasnovodsk, September 3rd. ( 6 ) The badges of the 5 th and 14th Turkistan Rifle Regiment were obseiwed among the troops, which left Krasnovodsk September 2nd to 6 th. Only 14 steamers, however, appear to have been despatched during that period, estimated to carry not more than LOOO men, with horses, and transport, and the guns of the 5th Turkistan Rifle Artillery Dm- (7) The incident, which occurred at Tashkent, August 29th, recorded in Appendix “A”, indicates that the situation on the ^ Rnsso-Ta Atfji frontier has lately assumed a phase, which is considered to demand the despatch of Turkistan troops to the Caucasus, and that troops, which we're originalh intended for the Polish frontier, may now be diverted to the Russo-Turkish border. (d) Aviation.-An aeroplane, probably belonging to the Tashkent Flying School reference Diary for 1913, paragraph 503) was observed over Merv September st, and over Askhabad, September 3rd ; both observations were made at night. te) Arms and ammunition.— The reservist troops in garrison at Tashkent on ^u&lt;mst 31st, and the transport-drivers, accompanying the troops_ despatched to Russia from Tashkent (see Appendix “ A ”) were like the reservists ^reierred to n paragraph 479 (d), armed with an old pattern of rifle, known as Bat zamgah . A consignment of 50 machine-guns (pattern not described) was despatched via K rasTvovodsk. from the east to Baku, August 28th (see paragraph 4ol). Arms and ammunition continue to arrive at Krasnovodsk from Baku, and to be despatched to the east by train ; 10 wagon-loads, under escort of 1 officer and 20 me ml 6 th Turkistan Rifle Regiment, August 26th; 2 wagon-loads, August 30th; and one, August 31st. (A Medical. Consignments of wounded and men, invalided from the front, have arrived at Krasnovodsk from Baku, in number estimated at 600. They are being despatched to Astrakhan and other centres, not ascertained, by steamer; some, about 50. are being treated at a hospital, improvised from a new building, situated 3ir miles from Krasnovodsk. No further information has been received regarding the equipment of the Turkistan Medical Train, referred to in paragraph 4r2 (7). Transport. For details of the transport, which accompanied units, des patched to Russia from Tashkent, sec Appendix “ A”; the following additional movements are reported :— Merv .—One thousand carts, large and small (probably 4-wheeled and 2 -wheeled) passed through, en rouieirom Kushkto the east, August 24th. Nine hundred carts were despatched from Merv to the east, Septem ber 1 st. KushJc.—The svstem of replacing regular troops with reservists, carried out thoroughly in the case of combatants, appears to be practised also in the case of transport-drivers, and even of transport-carts, e.g., four hundred reservists, with 110 carts, from Tashkent, passed through Merv by train, towards kushk, August 20 th, and four hundred regular transport-drivers with 100 carts on relief, passed from Kushk to Tashkent, August 26th [see paragraph 479 («)]; these were probably included among the transport sent to Russia, see Appendix ft \ 99(g) Supply. —Consignments of rice continue to pass from Baku, via Krasno- vodsk, to the east; 6 wagon-loads, August 30th and 31st; 4 wagon-loads, September 2 nd. The prices of food in Turkistan are fixed by law ; the most important of these are recorded in Appendix “ B The In tendance Department, Turkistan Military District, is advertising in the press for supplies, not from contractors but from growers and producers direct. The Officer Commanding, Engineer Department, Kushk Fortress, calls for tenders for the supply of coal and wood-fuel, for the garrison and Government build ings at Kushk, for the period 1915—1918, in the following quantities :—• Coal .. .. .. .. .. ... 1,666 tons. Firewood .. .. .. «. .. 131 sagenes. (917 cubic feet.) (Press, September 3rd.) 488. Intelligence, Russo-Afghan. —An Afghan gentleman, nominally in charge of the Muhammadan community in the neighbourhod of Termez (probably Muham mad Kasim \ see paragraph 214 of M. I.

A con siderable amount of railway material is stored at Kelif, The bridging material, usually kept in the fort at Termez, has been taken out, and stored, as formerly, on the river bank, near Khwaja Termez (4 miles north of Termez); a part is stored on the river bank, immediately west of Termez. 492. Post and Telegraphs. —Letters from Western Europe are being received in Meshed at rare intervals, bearing the Petersburg post mark ; this fact indicates that communication between Great Britain and Russia is open by the Scandinavian or other route and that the Russian postal system is at present disorganised, prob ably owing to the dearth of employees and to the appropriation of the railways for the transport of troops.

The troops from Samarkand, Andijan, and of the 17th Turkistan Rifle Regi ment from Askhabad, are not enumerated ; men of the 5th, 12 th and 17th Turkistan Rifle Regiments, had already been despatched prior to August 23rd {see 'paragraphs 447 and 464, Appendix “ B ”).

Persian Officials. Mustafa Mirza, the newly appointed Governor of Daragaz, after an unneces sarily long halt at Kuchan, peached Daragaz on September 17. The people are now quiet and received him well, but he is not likely to be popular for long. Some people have taken bast in the Telegraph office at Kuchan, as a protest against the retention of office by A dal-ud - Daulah, the Governor, who is most unpopular. It is reported that a considerable number of people from the surround ing villages are assembling with the object of joining the bastis. The case against Mirza Khalil Khan has been settled and he has satisfied all who were complaining against him by the payment of 580 tumans. The Governor-General has been ordered to assist the officials of the Finance Department in the collection of the revenue but has suggested that those officials should first render an account of the revenue already collected by them, which, he imagines, they will not find it easy to do. He demanded a list of those who have not paid the revenue due from them and, on seeing that the list was headed by the Chief of Bujnurd and contained the names of Rais-ut-Tujjar and Haji Husain Agha, two Russian 'proteges, observed that the department was ready enough to persecute poor peasants, but dared not collect revenue due by the powerful. The Rais-ut-Tujjar has obtained the assistances of my Colleague in two dis putes regarding land at Kasimabad and Dahana-yi-Shur, and he has said to have offered a bribe of 2,000 tumans to the Karguzar in connection with the two cases. At this rate the Karguzar will not be long in recovering the money which he^ recently paid to the Ministers in Tehran. Persian Affairs. A serious fire, which I omitted to mention last week, broke out in a tobacco nist’s shop in the Sarshur Bazar in the city on the night of September 9. Forty shops and the police station were destroyed and the people estimate the damage done at 100,000 tumans. Russian Affairs. M. Evreinov has received orders transferring him to the Russian Legation in Tehran, but M. Nickolsky wishes, if possible, to retain him here. The Russian subjeets in Meshed are again demanding the removal of the Taiirabashi appointed by the influence of Ml Romanovsky the younger and now supported by M. Romanovsky the elder. M. Nickolsky has appointed a day for the hearing of complaints against the Tajirbashi (Kasim Beg). Kardash Bala is still at large. It appears that Meshedi Ali Shakui was actually murdered by Husain Bala, at the instigation of one Meshedi Hasan, who is now in Constantinople. Herat News. * Owing to persistent rumours of collisions between Russian and Afghan troops on the Russo-Afghan frontier, circulated by mischief-makers, I have had special enquiries made regarding the state of affairs on this frontier and it appears that there has been no friction whatever. The Commandants of frontier posts are on the best of terms with one another and the Russian Commandant at Shaikh Junaid has sent to Risaladar Yar Muhammad khan a number of papers containing war news, with a complimentary message. The work of the Boundary Pillar Commission is proceed- l ing quietly. The Governor of Herat and the new Commander of the Troops are reported to be on good terms with one another and to be working in unison. By the Governor’s advice the Commander of the troops is attempting to put a stop to the officers’ practice of granting the men leave in consideration of receiving half their pay. He has also reduced the price of provisions for the troops. • ~ 1 India, Fc:. retary’-s j . No 4.3 dated s 22 OCT 1314 14N0V1S14;JTurbat-i-Haidari News. Since the outbreak of war the number of the Russian Consular Escort at Turbat-i-Haidari has been reduced from 25 to 6 . See last week’s diary. Salar-i-Humayun, the Governor, now blames the Reve nue gendarmes for the robbery at Julga Rukh. The Russian Consul is urging the Governor to punish Salar [Khan, Baluch, for his exactions from the people. The Russian Consul has received orders from Tehran not to interfere in the dis pute between Haji Agha Muhammad, who is under British protection, and Sharif- ul-Ulama, but he is still secretly assisting the latter. Political Summary. Condition of Country. Muhammad Kurshabadi, the well-known robber at Nishabur, who has for some time past been kept quiet by an allowance of 50 tumans a month, has again become active. The Governor-General has sent 40 sowars and foot soldiers against him and has called upon Nusrat-ul-Mulk, the Timuri Chief, to supply 60 sowars. Of these 20 have already left Meshed. It is said that Muhammad, accompanied by only three of his men, one of whom was killed, took refuge in Kurshabad and that he is now besieged there. Sher Muhammad, Kalantar of Nashtifan, was robbed of 130 tumans by 8 rob bers of Chah Kal’ah in the Karifc district. Foilr sowars of the Revenue Depart ment, who came to his assistance, were disarmed and robbed of everything they possessed. Khan Tama Khan, who was encamped in the neighbourhood, then attacked the robbers and captured two of them. The Governor, Haji Shuja-ul- Mulk, on hearing of the occurrence, sent 50 sowars against the robbers, who return ed to the Revenue gandermes everything they had taken from them and fled. The Governor’s sowars arrived on the scene after the escape of the robbers but captured three tents and 20 sheep, which appear to have been left behind by them. The Barbaris in the neighbourhood of Katah Shamshir have formed themselves into two parties, one under Ahmad Ali Shah and the other under Saiyid Kasim Shah, which are said to be preparing to attack one another. The quarrel began by one party preparing to rob the village of Katah Shamshir, which is the property of Gauhar Bukharai, a Russian 'protege. My Colleague has urged the Governor- General to send sowars to Katah Shamshir to keep the peace. Condition of Roads. A gang of robbers attacked a caravan near Niyazabad in the Khaf district, wounded some of the travellers, and carried off property worth 1,000 tumans. The Governor-General has ordered the Governor of Khaf to seize and punish the robbers. The War. The Governor-General has informed my Colleague that eight or nine Caucasian Turks, who have recently arrived in Meshed, are engaged in spreading rumours about the war damaging to the Russians, and has asked him to examine their pass ports and punish them if they are Russian subjects, and if not to hand them over to him in order that he may imprison them. It is possible that these men have been providing the editor of the Nau-Badar with the war news which he has been publish ing. One particularly mischievous item which he published was to the effect that Germany and Turkey had presented to the Persian Government an ultimatum demanding passage through Azarbaijan for Turkish troops, who would invade Transcaucasia by that route. The editor, who was taken to task for this statement, explained, in his swansong, that the news might very well be true as it harmonized completely with Germany’s treatment of Belgium. The paper has now been sup pressed. _ T. W.

Our claims against Hashmat-ul-Mulk. —Early iji the week I wrote a strong protest to the Governor about his brother’s attitude in this case, mentioning that I had also telegraphed a complaint to Tehran. Three days later, on the 25th instant, Hissam-ud-Dauleh departed on a pilgrimage to a shrine about 90 miles south of Birjand near Sahlabad. I have telegraphed to His Majesty’s Minister that a little more pressure from Tehran seems desirable if the case is to be quickly settled. An order to the old Amir to proceed to the Capital would probably end the matter satisfactorily. ! Baluch raids. —See Diaries Nos. 35 and 36. Mirza Khan, Narui, and two or three other prisoners have been safely brought to Birjand. The Deputy Governor of Neh, Mirza Ahmad Ali, has accompanied them. I expect that the men will be kept here in strict confinement for the present and treated as hostages for the good behaviour of the tribe during the period of the Governor’s visit to Sistan. As I anticipated, Mr. Gabler has begged me to intercede on behalf of Mirza Khan, but I consider such action would be most inconsistent and impolitic. As it is, the Baluchis are likely to get off much too cheaply on their agreeing to some nominal restitution and undertaking to refrain from raiding in the future. The Governor of Sistan and Kainat. —His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk tells me that he hopes to start for Sistan on about the 1 st November. He has had a large number of tents out for airing this week. The new troops. —A review of the Birjand garrison took place on the afternoon of the 24th instant. All the European community was invited to witness it. There were 180 infantry, 45 cavalry and 50 gunners with 4 guns on parade ; ( 4o Sarbazes were said to be absent on guard-duties, while about 200 infantry and 35 sowars were out in the District at Neh, Kain, Sunni-Khana, etc. Considering that the force has only been raised since Nauroz the display was most creditable. The artillery fired about 6 rounds per gun at targets. The infantry in 9 small companies went through all the usual European evolutions including skirmishing practice ; and the cavalry drilled both on horseback and dismounted. The commander of the latter is a very smart young fellow who has been trained in the Persian Cossack brigade, and his contingent gave the best show. The Band can already play a number of European tunes. The v hole force is to accompany the Governor down to Sistan. It will be interesting to see what progress the troops down there have made in the same period of time. The Finance Department. —See Diary No. 36. The Mirzas who recently reached Sistan have replaced Wall Muhammad Mirza and Mirza Mustafa Khan, two of the most senior Finance officials down there. The latter have arrived in ' Birjand on their way to Tehran. The Director, Ebtihaj-us-Sultan, gave a great banquet in their honour before the;y left. The British community does not regret the departure of either man. F. B. PRIDEAUX, Major, His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain.

It is reported that Murtaza Kuli, Tabatabai, has secured his reappointment as Mutawalli Bashi of the Shrine by the payment of a bribe of 3,000 tumans to the Ministers. Persian Affairs. The Persian Minister of the Interior has telegraphed to the Governor-General to enquire whether there are any rumours current of Salar-ud-Daulah/s returning to Persia. The Persian Authorities apparently believe it to be possible that Germany has supplied the ex-Shah and Salar-ud-Daulah with money in order that they may make trouble on the Persian frontiers in the direction of Ardabil and Astarabad. i Ismail and two other persons concerned in the murders at Daragaz have been arrested and sent back for trial to Daragaz, where they are likely to get short shrift. In reply to his request for more troops for the preservation of order in Khorassan the Governor-General has been informed by the Minister of the Interior that the Persian Government has no money and that he must make the best arrangements he can. Russian Affairs. Some evidence is forthcoming in the case of the murder of Alioff to the effect that Kardash Bala’s brothers, Hussain Bala and Dadaoff, were the actual mur derers and that the murdered man’s partner, who has now been arrested, was an accomplice and produced the murdered man’s money which is said to have been divided between the murderers, the Russian Tajir Bashi, and M. Romanovsky the younger, who has now gone to Sistan. See last week’s diary. The Governor of Russian Sarakhs has visited the Karguzar of Persian Sarakhs and explained that the Baluchis who were gathering pistachio nuts were killed by the Russian Turkomans because they were stealing the nuts. He also complained that the Baluchis were preparing to avenge the death of their kinsmen. These statements are believed to be untrue and are said to have been made to meet, in anticipation, a demand for the punishment of the murderers. Herat News. The work of the Boundary Pillar Commission is progressing. There has been some trouble over a pillar which is not numbered or marked in the map and which, the Russians allege, was built by th? Afghans 20 yards on the Russian side of the* border. The Afghans maintained that the pillar was in its correct place but when thek backs were turned the Russians destroyed the pillar and removed the bricks and mortar to the spot where they said the pillar should stand. After some wrangling the Russians carried back the bricks and mortar to the original site of the pillar and agreed to rebuild it. At another part of the frontier line the Rus sians suggested the building of some subsidiary pillars between existing pillars not visible from each other. The Afghans objected on the ground that they had not yet obtained the sanction of their Government to the erection of the subsidiary pillars. The contention of the Russians appears to be reasonable, but if the erec tion of the subsidiary pillars is agreed to they will probably contrive to transfer some land from Afghan to Russian limits. The Afghan Commissioners are pro ceeding on their way along the frontier and will be met at various points by fresh parties of Russian officers. The Russians have purchased 600 horses from the neighbourhood Junaid. India, Foreign Secre. arys. N° 4 2 M, dated 15 OCT 1314 of Shaikh2 Th. ... » affecting in ££ SiS SiSis Sn^U” i k ». • -' „..

No reports have been received of the further inflow of reservists from Russia. The families of many reservists, resident in Trans-Caspia, who have been called up for military service with the colours, have been provided with assistance in money and a free passage to Russia in Europe. (c) Movements of troops.—No reports have been received of the desnatch to European Russia, or the Russo-Turkish frontier, of the troops stand ing under orders for active service, at Tashkent, Askhabad, and other large centres ; it is a matter of common talk, in Russian military circles in Meshed, that troops, amounting to one army corps have left Turkistan. Movements of small detachments are recorded in Appendix A. {d) Arms and ammunition.—Thxw wagon-loads, ammunition, arrived from Baku and passed to the east, August 27th.

The two battalions, 6 th Turkistan Rifle Regiment were under orders to be ready to entrain for the front on August’ 27th with tents and transport-carts. This is the first intimation received of the provision of tents or transport to units leaving Turkistan on service, since mobilization was ordered. Four hundred reservists (with blue badges without numbers, probably of a Transport Cadre), with 100 two-wheeled transport-carts passed through Merv, August 24th, probably by rail, on route from Kushk to Tashkent; 500 men of similar description, with 150 two-wheeled carts, passed through Merv, August 28th, on route from Askhabad to Tashkent. India, Foreign Secretary's M° 4 £ *d, dated 15 OCT 13142 The press states that the supply of horses in Askhabad is poor, but that the F Teiend and Merv districts are providing a large number of good horses at reasonable prices; up to August 23rd, 400 newly-bought horses had been gelt.

Krasnovodsk—The following arrived from Baku and left by tram to the east:— 100 men, 19th Turkistan Rifle Regiment, with their private baggage, August 23rd. 100 men, described as Cossacks, but with the badges “ I. TPM ” (either Termez Fortress Artillerymen, or Turkoman of the Mounted Divi sion, the badge “ TPK ” being mistaken), August 24th ; these were part of a batch of 150, who are said to have arrived from the direction of Kizil Arvat. 400 Cossacks, without badges, August 25th. 200 men (reservists ?), 14th Turkistan Rifle Regiment, August 27th. The following arrived from the east, and left for Baku :— 50 men, described as Cossacks, but with badges “ I.TPM ” (as above)- August 24th ; these formed the remainder of the batch of 150, referred to above. 70 men, 19th Turkistan Rifle Regiment. It was reported that a very large number of troops was expected to pass through to the front (whether Western Europe or Asia Minor, is no stated) on about September 2 nd.-Eighty men, 11 th Turkistan Rifle Regiment, arrived from the Upper Oxus, in a barge (without a steamer), August 19th. , huwtred and seventy Medical Officers have been assembled at the large Medical Depot at Charjui; these are under orders to leave on active service, with the two battalions, 6 th Turkistan Rifle Regiment, about August 27th. Termez. 9th and 10 th Turkistan Rifle Regiments were still in garrison on August 22nd, with more than 2,000 reservists ; no orders had been received for any of these troops to move. Mem—Forty Cossacks, 1 st Semirechia Cossack Regiment, from Meshed passed through from the west towards the east, August 25th, probably for the regimental depot at Katta Kurghan. Three companies, 13th Turkistan Rifle Regiment (probably formed of reservist) left Merv, August 27th, two companies for Charjui, and one company for ivagan. SaraJchs.

G. MARSH, Major K Military Attache, Meshed.CONFIDENTIAL. Sistan and Kain Consulate Diary No. 38, for the week ending the I9th September 1914. 14th September. —Heavy rain fell this afternoon. Our tents in the Bagh-i- Bakaran Bud were all flccded, and similarly the Cossacks and their horses at the adjacent Kalata of Amirabad found themselves knee-deep in water most unexpect edly. The Biriand river flowed several feet deep until the following motning. The oldest inhabitants can recollect only one similar autumn flccd, which occurred about 50 years ago. 18th September. —The Bussian Doctor MorozofE and the two ladies mentioned in last week’s diary reached Birjand frotoi Sistan. Genebal. Baluch Raids. —( 1 ) Sardar Pasand Khan, Alam Khan, and Parya, Yagizai Baluchis, and Badin, Murrai Baluch, with eight or ten followers, reached Birjand from Sistan on the 13th instant and have been accommodated as guests in tents outside the Governor’s residence. His Excellency has not yet interviewed them. ( 2 ) See Diaries Nos. 35 and 36 about Mirza Khan Sherdil. Under Shaukat-ul- Mulk’s orders this n an has been despatched from Sistan to Birjand under an escort of two Jambazes (camel-sowars) and 10 horse-sowars. Our Claim against Hissam-ud-Daulah is displaying a mulish attitude and still protesting that only his son’s properties should be attached for the latter’s misdeeds. He also declares that he is still corresponding with the latter on the subject. I have pressed him to give me a list of estates which contri bute fixed annual rentals through being leased to contractors, and have offered to take over so many of these as will provide 6,000 Tomans per annum, thus enabling the liability to be cleared off in less than 6 years. As he declines this very consider ate proposal, I have telegraphed my opinion to Tehran that he should be compelled to go up there to settle the matter without further delay. It seems to me also that Shaukat-ul-Mulk is a-little afraid of leaving his brother here with a free hand when he himself goes down to Sistan. The Governor of Sistan and Kainat.- —Shaukat-ul-Mulk seems very nervous about his own safety. He never goes about without a revolver in his pocket. He was playing tennis this afternoon (Saturday) at our ‘ Garden, ’ when a number of labourers working on our new buildings collected to look on from about 50 yards away. Six of the Governor’s riflemen promptly assembled on a mound adjoining our Marquee and so frightened the coolies that most of them refused to return to work next day ! I am told that, except at European houses, the Governor never eats any food except what is cooked by his mother. The Indo-European Telegraph Line Extension.—It is understood that the work on the Bobat-Sistan line began on about the 8 th instant, when Mr. Cane, Inspector of the 6 th Sub-section, joined Mr. Gabler at Bobat. It is hoped that the work will be completed by the middle of October. The people of Sistan, I hear from Lutak, are rather perturbed over the construction, and are considering whether it portends any tightening of our hold over the district. F. B. PBIDEAUX, Major, His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain* ■ • IMeshed Diary No. 36 for the week ending September 5th, 1914. Persian Officials. It is reported that Sadr-ul-Mumalik has been appointed as Mutawalli Bashi. The troubles at Daragaz, which I have frequently reported, have settled them- selyes after a fashion. A young man named Bihbud Khan, a relative and servant of Mirza Mas ud Khan, has shot and killed Mirza Mas ud Khan. Ismahl, another of Mirza Masu d Khan's servants, shot and killed Said Ali Khan, Mirza Masu'd Khan’s father, and Kiza Khan, brother of Mirza Masu’d Khan, shot and killed Abdul Hamid Khan. The Governor-General has appointed Zabardast Khan cousin of Mirza Mas’ud Khan, Governor of Daragaz. Persian Affairs. On the night of August 30th about 200 men assembled in the Shrine as a protest against the Navaqil now levied. It was proposed that they should attack the Finance Office but the Office was guarded by gendarmes and the proposal came to nothing. The malcontents are said to be awaiting the arrival of others from the villages. Mirza Khalil Khan has not yet been brought to trial. Before urging the Governor-General to take some action in the case I asked my Colleague whether he wished to intervene and he kindly replied that if I would attend the trial in person he would take no action, as he relied upon my sense of justice. I therefore proposed to the Governor-General that I should attend the trial, and he tells me that he has solicited orders on the subject from Tehran. The Karguzar is strongly oppposing my intervention. The Persian Foreign Minister h?s sent orders to the Karguzar to make some reasonable arrangement for the sale of intoxicating liquors by foreigners and to levy an excise tax from them. Russian Affairs. The officers of the 1st Semirechia Cossacks are disgusted at their retention in Meshed, for which they blame my Colleague, who has reported that their presence is necessary for the safety of Russian subjects. The man really responsible is I believe, Colonel Scouratt, the Military Attache. The Cossacks have not altogether lost hope of being sent on service, as their Colonel, Goushchin, who has recently come fromPetrograd, where he was serving on the General Staff, has telegraphed to General Samsonofi and General Ivanoff, with whom he has served on the Stalb General Samsonoff has been killed, but General Ivanoff may do something for him. ° Mukhtar, the murderer of Mirza Ismail, Munshi of the Russian Consulate at Turbat-i-Haidari, has arrived at Meshed on his way to Ashkabad, where he is to be tried. Salar-i-Humayun, Governor of Turbat-i-Haidari, is complaining of the over bearing conduct of M. Mikhaifoff, Russian Consul at Turbat. M. Romanovsky returned from Ashkabad on September, but I believe he will shortly be leaving for Quchan, where he has some work to do. Qardash Bala is still at large and is reported to have taken refuge with the Shikari robbers who are now again being attacked by Persian sowars. See diary for the week ending August 22nd. The Russians are turning the incident of the murder of a woman by two Cossacks at Quchan to their own advantage. They allege that the Cossacks were drunk and that the real delinquents were those who, in spite of orders to the contrary, sold them liquor.

Russian troops in North Persia .—The Officer Commanding 1st Semi- rechia Cossack Regiment has received official intimation that his regiment will remain in Khorassan for the present. Mobilization. 463. (a) Turkoman Mounted Division .—It is stated that the batch of 100 Turkoman recruits and horses, reported to have left Sarakhs by road to the north on 5th August, returned to that station, August 19th, and that the Turkomans, placed on guard over the telegraph line in the Tejend district, at the rate of 1 man per telegraph pole, have been released from their obligation, but have been warned to be ready to rejoin at short notice. The arrival in Turkistan of large numbers of reservists from Russia, recorded below, and the normal character of the course of mobilization operations, has probably obviated the necessity for the employ ment of these levies. (h) Reservists .—The arrival of some 34,000 reservists from Russia via Tash kent, and of some 2,000 via Krasnovodsk, indicates that the 8 Turkistan Reserve Regiments (or Brigades), each of 4 battalions and an independent battalion, are being formed, in accordance with the normal scheme of mobilization in Turkistan. Of the arrivals via Tashkent, 4,000 detrained at that station, the remaining 30,000 passed on to the south ; all are reported to have arrived without arms, ammunition, or uniforms, The 2,000 reservists, who arrived from Baku, are described as “ sol diers,” and probably carried arms ; these proceeded east by train, and 400, as re corded in paragraph 455 {d), detrained at Askhabad, August 11th. It is reported, on credible authority, that the arrival of the reservists from Russia and of local reservists, brought the total number of troops assembled in Tashkent, on August 19th up to 20,000 men. A The detail of movements of reservists are recorded in Appendix “ A.” (c) Equipment -—The thoroughness of the scheme of mobilization of the troops, detailed for service in the 1st and 2nd Turkistan Army Corps, is indicated by the arrival from Baku of the following consignments, which were despatched by train from Krasnovodsk to the east, between August 8th and 16th. 60 kitchen carts (of which 20 left under Cossack escort), 6 ambulance wagons. 2 travelling hospitals, 2 wagons for the carriage of red cross nurses, and 12 wagon-loads of uniforms. {d) Transport .—The following details are reported :— Tashkent .—Up to August 15th, total number of horses bought was 12,000, of which only some 10 per cent, were fit for riding, the remainder being suitable only for draught and pack transport. Merv .—Up to August 6th, 3,600 horses had been bought; these are being trained, according to report, for artillery draught and for transport work. 1,000 camels had also been collected, and placed in charge of two Turkoman chiefs, for custody until required. (This form of transport would normally be required for a campaign in countries to the south only). An order was issued, August 13th, to collect | carts. The notice requisitioning Turkoman transport, recorded in paragraph 449, was issued to 54 Turkoman chiefs (including 1 each at Dushak and Kaakha). A war contribution of 1,000 roubles, probably in aid of the C462FD2 funds for the support of families of reservists, has been suggested to the chiefs as a practical method of giving assistance, m addition to their help in collecting transport. Krastifivodsk .—Up to August 12th, 50 horses had been bought. have been made for animals purchased ; ti e om i , .. ..a .&lt; returned to the charge of their owners until required. 464 Despatch of troops to Russia.-k comparatively small number of troops have been sent to Russia, and in most cases only incomplete units appear to have be In despatched. Details of these movements are recorded m Appendix B ; the total is equivalent to :— 2 Cossack cavahy regiments, 3 batteries of artillery, and 4 or 5 battalions of infantry. • force however, reported to amount to 20,000 men, had been assembled at Tashkent bv August 19th, and in the absence of information pointing to the em- nlovment of this force in other directions, it may be concluded that it is intended to send it to the scene of military operations in Western Europe when required. 465 Russian posts on the Afghan frontier.—Tersian official information states that a collision has occurred in the neighbourhood of Kushk, between Afghans and Russian troops but no details are available. The following movements of troops to the reinforcement of Russian posts on the frontier are reported -P/tllnnrnno' rpHPrvists left hv train for Kushk. August 5th, 1,000. August 10th, 800.

'Note .—The following information includes all that has been recorded in the body of previous diaries ; the conditons, however, under which it is collected are such that it is probable that some movements have escaped observation altogether, and that the identity of batches, passing through stations may, in some cases, be confused. At a later date these omissions and uncertainties will probably be rectified, so as to afford a clear statement of the numbers of reservists, resident in Turkistan, and brought from Russia, the time taken to assemble and distribute them, etc. Tashkent. —3,200 local men were despatched, at the rate of about 800 a day, said to be destined for Termez, Kerki and Kushk, August 3rd to 7th. Reports from Charjui appear to account for 1,400 of these, as follows :— 570 arrived at Charjui, August 3rd; of these 70 were sent on to Merv, and 500 left by steamer for Kerki, August 5th.

Total 1,400, of which 900 were sent to Merv, as above recorded. The 1,800, remaining to be accounted for, probably passed to Termez via Samarkand, from which no report has yet been received. 34,000 arrived from Russia, Agusut 8th to 15th. (See footnote). Charjui. —400 local men, who arrived August 2nd, were despatched as follows:— 200 to Merv, August 2nd, and thence to Kushk, August 2nd. 200 to the east, by train, August 5th, destination not yet ascertained. Total 400 Merv. —2,700 (probably local) men assembled, August 3rd. These appear to have been distributed as follows :— 1,000 to Kushk, August 5th. 800 towards Tejend, possibly for Sarakhs, August 7th. 800 to Kushk, August 10th. 100 retained for local garrison. Total 2,700 1,100 arrived from the East, August 2nd to 8th of which 900 appear to have come from Tashkent, via Charjui (see Tashkent above) and 200 from Charjui; of these, 200 were sent to Kushk and 900 retained for local garrison, making with the 100, mentioned above, a force of 1,000 men, to whom uniforms and the old badges of the local Merv battalions were issued. 900 men were sent to Kushk on August 13th, but it appears that these must have arrived from Tashkent or Askhabad, though their arrival is not reported at Merv. Askhabad. —No report has yet been received of the numbers collected at this centre, but the following details are available, from which a rough estimate may be formed :— 300 (possibly Askhabad local reservists) passed through Charjui, at night August 3rd-4th, to the east; destination has not yet been ascertained. 400 men, reported as Having entrained at Askhabad, passed through Charjui, to the east, August 4th ; destination has not yet been ascer tained.4 600 men left Askhabad in small detachments, from August 3rd to 15th, nrobablv local men or drafts from Krasnovodsk by tram to the east. These may have to be included in the batches of 400 and 300 above mentioned, but it is improbable that they would have been sent otf , n small detachments, if the need for their immediate despatch to the east had not been urgent; it is not probable, therefore, that they would have been detrained or delayed at some intermediate station merely for tlie purpose of collecting them into larger batches. The total of men sent off from Askhabad, thus amounts to 1,300 As will be seen in the list of arrivals at Krasnoyodsk from Baku 1 500 reservists arrived on the 2nd and 3rd August, if, of these, 1,300 were immediately sent on, some without detraining, and some after a few days’ delay at Askhabad, a balance of 200, plus the subsequent arrivals, viz., 1,415, is left at Askhabad for garrison duty and for further detachments to stations in Trans Caspia, i.e., a total ot. 1 filK .. 2,915 The following figures, 'therefore, are included in the above total of 2,915 and are only [given below for record of the detail. KrasnovodsL—AM the following arrived from Baku and left by tram to the east:— 500, at midnight, 2nd-3rd August. 1,000, 3rd August. 25 officers, August 5th. 80 men (from Cheleken), August 5th. 190 non-reservists, civilians for garrison work, August 5th. (Many of these were local Krasnovodsk men). 50 gendarmes and clerks (from Krasnovodsk) and about 35 non-reservists, civilians for garrison work (also from Krasnovodsk) August 7th. 400 men, who arrived in Askhabad, August 11th, and whose arrival evi dently escaped observation and report at Krasnovodsk. 30 men, probably of the 4th Reserve Battalion, August 8th. 35 men, of the Intendanee, August 9th 30 men, said to be from Persia, August 9th. 50 reservist Cossacks, August 10th. 80 men, said to be from Persia, August 11th. 40 non-reservists, civilian clerks (from Hassan Kuli) August 11th. 150 lads, between 12 and 16 years of age, August 13th. 150 reservists, August 14th. 70 reservists (from vicinity of Krasnovodsk) August 18th. 2,915. Note .—The 34,000 reservists recorded above as having arrived in Turkistan via Taskhent, were without arms and ammunition, or uniform. They arrived at the rate of 4 train-loads a day, from August 8th to 15th inclusive ; 4,000 detrained at Tashkent, the remaining 30,000 passed on to the south. The 4,000, who detrained at Tashkent, are included in the total number of treeps reported, August 19th, to have been assembled at Tashkent. It is concluded that these 34,000 men will form the reserve troops, to take the place of regulars, sent out of the country, although i is not certain whether they will form the 8 Reserve Brigades, as stated in the “ Handbook o f the Russian Army, 5th' Edition, 1908.” page 33.APPENDIX “ B (Reference paragraph 464). Detail of troops despatched to Russia. In addition to the troops, whose despatch to Russia was recorded in para graphs 447 and 456, the following movements are reported :— Samarkand. —Information, acquired at Meshed, states that the 2nd Ural Cossack Regiment left for Russia, probably via Tashkent, early in August. Tashkent. —1 company, 17th Turkistan Rifle Regiment, has left this station for Russia, August 15th. It appears probable, from this informa tion, that the 17th Turkistan Rifle Regiment, was despatched from Askhabad to Tashkent, August 2nd, and not for Termez, as was indicated by the report recorded in paragraph 457 ; the remainder of the regiment, together with other troops, assembled to the number of 20,000 men, in Tashkent, August 19th, was expected to leave for Russia on about August 25th. Merv. —300 men, 13th Turkistan Rifle Regiment, left for Russia, August 12th. Charjui. —2nd battalion, 6th Turkistan Rifle Regiment (600 men) arrived, August 6th, from Khiva by steamer (the “ Khiva ”), and are under orders to proceed on August 25th, together with the 1st battalion of the same regiment, to Russia. The following details left by train for the east, probably for Tashkent and Russia :— August 5th. — 80 men, 17th Turkistan Rifle Regiment. 20 men, 5th Turkistan Rifle Artillery Division, with 2 wagons, of which 1 was loaded with hand-grenades and the other with ammunition. August 6th. —40 men, 4th Orenburg Cossack Regiment, without horses, and 80 men, 11th Turkistan Rifle Regiment; both detach ments arrived from Kerki by the steamer “ Tsarevich.” APPENDIX c ‘ C (Reference paragraph 466). Detail of movements of troops within the Turkistan Military District. In addition to the movements, recorded in paragraphs 437, 448, 458 and 466, the following movements are reported :— Charjui .—80 men, 18th and 19th Turkistan Rifle Regiments, passed through by train from the west, August 5th, said to be destined for Andijan, but probably for Tashkent or the Afghan frontier. Krasnovodsk. —3 wagons, loaded with the baggage of the local garrison (probably of 2 companies, 19th Turkistan Rifle Regiment) who left eastwards on August 2nd (reference paragraph 458) were sent to the east by train, August 9th, probably to the depot at Askhabad. 40 men, 19th Turkistan Rifle Regiment, and 15 men, 1st Taman Cossack Regiment, from Baku, left to the east by train, August 13th. The following also arrived from Baku and left to the east:— 30 Cossacks, August 14th. 80 Cossacks, 1st Caucasus and 1st Taman Cossack Regiments, August 15th. 50 men, 17th Turkistan Rifle Regiment, and 6 officers of the 6th, 14th, and 17th Turkistan Rifle Regiments, August 17th. 180 Cossacks, 1st Caucasus Cossack Regiment, August 18th.

Turkomans .—Reports from Trans-Caspia do not confirm the informa tion, published in the Turkistan press, to the effect that the Turkoman population is quiet, and eager to give every possible assistance to the Russian authorities in the present crisis. On the contrary, it is reported that extreme severity to the native population is being displayed by the officials, responsible for order and for the collection of civil transport, and that, were it not for the large number of reserve troops, now collected in the Turkistan Military District, the feelings of the Turko mans would have found vent in disturbances, which might spread to Bokhara and Khiva, and lead to a general insurrection. 471. Russian troops in North Persia. —The 1st Semirechia Cossack Regiment has received, during the past week at Meshed, small drafts of men and material, amounting to 4 officers and about 20 men, the latter probably men who had been sent as escort to baggage. Eight carts, containing the regimental machine guns, tents, rope, and cooking-pots, have returned to Meshed. One hundred and eighty Cossacks, 1st Caucasus Cossack Regiment, who arrived at Krasnovodsk from Baku, August 18th, and proceeded east by train {reference Appendix “ C, ” Diary No. 35) returned to Krasnovodsk, August 20th, and proceeded by sea to Baku. One thousand and six hundred men, probably reservists, in the uniform of the 13th. Turkistan Rifle Regiment, left Merv, August 21st, in the direction of Askhabad, said to be destined for Astarabad, in place of the regular troops, recalled t j Turkistan early in August. 472. Mobilisation .— (a) Reservists* —Reservists continue to arrive (August 21st) from Russia, by rail at Tashkent, and by sea at Krasnovodsk. Arrivals at Tash kent are without arms or uniform; information on this point as to the arrivals at Krasnovodsk is not yet available. The reservists are posted to the existing units ; they are not being formed into separate reserve units. Some 15 of the civilians, sent to Askhabad for garri son work, have returned to their normal duties as clerks in Krasno vodsk. The distribution of reservists in Turkistan, so far as can at present be ascertained, is probably as follows :— Resident in Turkistan .. .. .. .. 10,000 Arrived from Russia .. .. .. .. 40,000 History.

(b) Troops under orders for active service in Western Europe. Tashkent —The departure of the 20,000 troops, reported to have been assem- 1 bled bv August 19th, for Russia, has not yet been reported, but information, dated August 21st, states that all Cossacks (number not specified) assembled in Tashkent have left, with the exception of 20 men.

One hundred young officers arrived from Tashkent, August 21st; of these 40 passed to Askhabad, 30 to Kushk, the remaining 30 detrained at Merv ; they are described as instructors for the reservists. One company, 15th, and 1 company, 16th Turkistan Rifle Regiment, with 16 two-wheeled transport - carts, passed through from Kushk towaids Tashkent, August 11th. Two companies, 18th Turkistan Rifle Regiment, probably Ist-class reservists to complete the regiment to war establishment, passed through trom Tashkent, August 13th, towards Askhabad. One hundred regulars, with badges described as “ 118 ’and of the East Siberian Rifle Regiments, passed through from west to east, Augus 23rd. This movement is the first, connected with the Eas ern Siberian forces, yet reported, although it has been stated by a Russian official at Meshed that these troops are being transpor e to the scene of the war via the Orenburg-Tashkent and Central Asian railways, owing to the press of traffic on Russian railways.leporteil: s Hum si attery,® &gt;ction oflt 21 st; of 30 ie» jrvists. clai east.

The foflowing consignments have been received from Tashkent, in addition to some not reported, but removed from the railway stations by a daily service of 35 carts, for a period of about 10 days : 500 boxes, small-arms ammunition, August 12th, 400 boxes, artillery ammunition, and 600 boxes, small-arms ammunition, August 13th. Tashkent.—It is reported (August 21st) that each battalion of the 1st 1 urkistan Rifle Brigade is armed with 4 machine-guns of the old pattern, without wheels; this information cannot refer to the regular battalions, which for some years have been armed, so far as is known one battalion m each regiment with guns of the new pattern with wheels, and the other battalion with the old gun. Moreover as recorded in paragraph 451,50 machine-guns, new pattern, arrived at Merv, probably from Tashkent, August 2nd.

Baluch Raids—[l) Sardar Khudadad Khan Narui has sent me a very humble and pacific message through His Majesty’s Vice-Consul Sistan, declaring his earnest desire to live on good terms with the British Government. any misdemeanours without real proof! It will be remembered that Khudadad Khan was the Sistani Sardar who was deputed in 1912 with the late Sarhaddar, Nasir-us-Sultaneh, to visit Sarhad and try to recover the British owned goods looted at Neh. The two imposters were paid 9,000 Tomans by the Persian Government for this object, but recovered nothing. Khudadad Khan is the near relative and strong est supporter of Hashmat-ul-Mulk in Sistan. It seems vain to hope that Shaukat- ul-Mulk will mete out to him the treatment that he deserves. (2) It has just been brought to my notice that the Baluch raider, whose cap ture was reported in Weekly Diary No. 36 of 1913, is a British subject! His name is Imam Bakhsh, and he is a Muhammad-Hasam of Kirdgab, in the Kelat Political Agency. A relative of his, Rasul Bakhsh, of Kirdgab, wrote to the Brahui Camel-sarwan of this Consulate (a man who accompanied me from India) saying that he had heard that his relative was in confinement at Birjand, with the result that the man has been identified. The case will be referred to His Majesty’s Minister for orders after I have discussed it with the Governor. Imam Bakhsh now states that he came from Kirdgab to Robat with a Military Detachment. He then came up to Sistan and entered the service of Sardar Khudadad Khan. His companions in the raid of last year were all Sistani or Sarhaddi Baluchis. (3) It is reported from Sistan that Pasand Khan, Alam Khan and a number of other Brahuis left Lutak on the 4th instant for Birjand. The two leaders are connected with the Government force of Road Jambazes. They have possibly been summoned to discuss the arrangements for safe guarding the Governor on his journey to Sistan. The Birjand Karguzari .—See last week’s diary. I have heard the details of the opium-smuggling ofience committed by the wife of Mirza Ahmed Khan last May. It appears that it occurred before her husband had returned to Birjand from his European tour. A Kaini man of opium was found in her box when she was about to leave for Duruksh and she was sentenced by the Director of Reve nues to a fine of 400 Tomans, which has since been reduced to 200 Tomans. The husband bought his Honorary appointment and title as a set-off to the disgrace he has undergone, but he has not paid the fine yet, alleging that 5,000 Tomans worth of property were stolen from the box when the opium was discovered! Finance Department, Sistan.—(1) Prince Ebtihaj-us-Sultan, the Director, has issued a notification to all the Kadkhudas (Contractors for the Revenue) of villages in Sistan to the effect that as the present system of frequent changes and insecurity of tenure has been most vexatious to the people themselves and pre judicial to the interests of the Government at the same time, he has obtained sanc tion from the Treasurer General to amend it and lease out all the villages on long contracts at once. The Revenue demand will henceforth be fixed for a stated period, so that the Kadkhudas may proceed to populate their lands and extend their cultivation in confidence. The scheme is a most excellent one in principle, but it remains to be seen whether the corrupt Mirzas of the Department will not contrive to override its chief object almost as much as hitherto.

A. 2 /o-i The Aericultural community of Sistan during the last 15 days have been in a ferment alainst the Revenue Director, for two reasons- a) the enforcement of the Nawaqil tax on donkeys which bring wood, straw, melons, etc., into the town, and (6) the high rates at which they are being compelled to pay in cash for a portion of their revenue contributions. The house of the Director has been throughout this period guarded by a force of Sarbazes, who were ordered by the Governor of the Province to suppress all signs of rioting with a strong hand. It is to be hoped that the great reform just announced—as to the Revenue Con tracts—will appease the people and cause them to discontinue their Rozi-Khaneh meetings. The Nawaqil tax, if paid at the monthly rate, is really not very oppressive and the donkey owners are sure to recoup- themselves by raising the prices of their sale-commodities.

The Karguzar at Birjand has protested against the appointment of Mirza Ahmad, Ihtisham-ul-Ayalah, the Bahai, as his deputy. This man was formerly postmaster at Birjand but was dismissed. He is now in trouble owing to an attempt by his wife to smuggle opium. The Karguzar at Meshed is trying to help him but I hear that Shaukat-ul-Mulk is not likely to allow himself to be influenced. charge of a theft from a British subject escaped from custody. Two of the Armenians have been recaptured but Kardash Bala is still at large. My Colleague has offered a reward of 100 tumans for information leading to his recapture and has threatened that the house of anybody found harbouring him will be destroyed. Three Russian Engineers arrived at Meshed during the week. They are going to Sarakhs to inspect the water supply provided by the Hari Rud. It seems to be improbable that the 1st Semirechia Cossacks will move from Meshed. They have been ordered to stand fast for the present, and some officers, whom I have not yet met, have joined them. It is reported that 45 Cossacks passed through Bajgiran on their way to Meshed on August 24. The Russian community professes to be apprehensive of violence from tue Persians should the Cossacks be withdrawn and the employes of the Russian Bank attempted to im press the Persians by spreading a rumour to the effect that 80,000 Russian troops were on their way to Khorasan. One of the most nervous of the Russians is Colonel Scouratt, the Military Attache. Mme. Scouratt seriously suggested that My Colleague has returned to Hoffmann, the German shopkeeper here, all his papers. The Afghan sowars who crossed the Persian frontier and were imprisoned on suspicion of theft have now been released after tracing the camels which they were supposed to have stolen to an encampment of Afghan refugees on Persian soil. The Afghan refugees have been imprisoned. The work of the Boundary Pillar Commission still hangs fire, according to the latest reports. The Russian Political Officer left Shaikh Junaid for Ashkabad and the Afghans were informed that another officer would arrive from Tashkent at Shaikh Junaid on August 5th and that work could then be begun. In the meantime the health of the Aghan officials on the Commission is suffering con siderably from the climate of Chihil Dukhtaran. Mulla Musalli, the Afghan official who visited Shaikh Junaid, reports the departure of troops for the war, the strengthening of the guards on the railway, and the impressment of horses for military purposes. Condition of Country. —Tama Khan, Chief of the nomads at Farazna, has been imprisoned for stealing fifteen horses. Haji Shuja-ul-Mulk has attacked a gang of six robbers who were robbing in Khaf. Three were seized and are now employed on hard labour, and three escaped. Forty-three carpets and seven donkeys were recovered. There has been a disturbance between Persian soldiers and cultivators of the Khalisa lands at Pahlavi in the Sarakhs district. The soldiers maltreated a Russian Affairs.

The Nan Bahar openly stated that Afghanistan was about to attack Russia m order to regain her lost independence ” and insinuated that it was a pity that Persia did tellow this example. Perhaps the best effort is a rumour to the effect that the three Russian Engineers who recently arrived from Ashakabad are about to run a tunnel from Meshed to the Afghan frontier. T. W.

Russian troops in North Persia. Khorasan. —The 1st Semirechia Cossack Kegiment continue to await orders to march at four hours’ notice ; the regimental machine-guns, the sick, and all baggage have already been sent to Askhabad. The departure of the troops is delayed probably on account of the difficulty of replacing them, or possibly because the imminence of trouble on the Russo-Turkish frontier, for the present, appears less probable than at the beginning of August. Mobilization. 455. {a) Turkoman Mounted Division. —It is reported that two additional sotnias are being raised in Trans-Caspia, Turkomans being enlisted on the silladar system at the monthly rate of pay of 30 roubles, with free rations. 100 recruits with 100 horses are reported to have left Sarakhs by road to the north, August 5th. On relief from their present duties on railway protection in Trans-Caspia, the Turkoman Mounted Division are expected to relieve the 1st Semirechia Cossack Regiment in Khorasan. (b) Protective measures on the Central Asian Railway. —Each verst of the main line is being guarded by patrols, furnished by the Turkoman Mounted Brigade and by the Turkistan Sapper Battalions. The wharfs at Krasnov odsk and railway stations throughout the Turkistan Military District are also carefully guarded ; it is consequently a matter of difficulty to ascertain the identity of the corps moving by rail and sea. (c) Volunteers. —The General Staff, Turkistan Military District, published a notice in the “ Turkistan Gazette ” of July 27th-August 9th, calling for volunteers between the ages of 18 and 43 years, either with or without military training. (d) Reservists. —On August 11th, a battalion of 400 men arrived from Russia, comprising probably the 5th Turkistan Reserve Battalion, which, on expansion,' will form the 5th Turkistan Reserve Regiment of 4 battalions and an independent battalion ; the battalion detrained at Askhabad. All reservists, resident in Turkis- tan, have already joined their units ; the total number has not yet transpired. (e) Transport.

Post and telegraphs.—No letters from Western Europe, bearing a later date thajn July 30th, have been received in Meshed. Official information from Petersburg, however, states (August 15th) that passenger traffic by sea is open between the United Kingdom and Northern Russia. It appears probable that telegraphic communication by the northern route is also uninterrupted. According to the Russian press, wireless communication is being arranged between Cyprus and the Caucasus. F. G. MARSH, Major, Military Attache, Meshed*CONo 40 Wl, dated 1 OCT 1914 CONFIDENTIAL.

Our claim against Hashmat-ul-Mulk.—^hz list of properties sent me by Hissam- ud-Dauleh rates his total estates to be worth 409,600 Tomans instead of the 200,000 Tomans which he had previously in conversation valued them at ! Hashmat-ul- Mulk’s properties are separately valued at 29,000 Tomans—their fair value is pro bably 21,000 Tomans—and in addition the father and son draw the revenues of villages in wagf, worth 64,000 Tomans. I am having some of the properties inspected. Baluch Raids. —Sardar Khudadad Khan, Narui, has been begging His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Sistan, Major Heron, to intercede on behalf of Mirza Khan Sherdil, Narui (see last week’s diary). I have been informed on good authority that Mirza Khan led a large band of Naruis against Neh last year in company with Mir Jehind, that he has looted the flocks of the Shebak and Murrai tribes, and that he has frequently levied illegal imposts from Kerman and Bander Abbas caravans. He is likely to remain in confinement for some time now unless his friends can bribe the Sistan authorities sufficiently highly. I have instructed Major Haron to take no steps on his behalf whatever. Presumably the man thought that there was an amnesty or temporary indulgence for ill Sarhaddis visiting Sistan this summer to buy wheat. It is to be hoped that Mr. Gabler has not spread this idea amongst them. Even if he has, there seems to be no reason why the Consulate should be friend a leader of the raiders, as Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s denial of the imposition of an embargo or blockade can only fairly be construed to apply to innocent residents of Sarhad. The Birjand Karguzari.—In Meshed Diary No. 35 for the week ending 29th August 1914 a paragraph is devoted to Mirza Ahmed, Ihtisham-ul-Ayaleh, who was recently appointed Honorary Naib Karguzar of Birjand. It may be true that this gentleman is objected to by his immediate superior, but it seems incorrect that he was dismissed last year from the office of postmaster. Only to-day (5th Septem ber) the Governor has informed me that he voluntarily resigned that post last year. Nothing has transpired in Birjand about his having got into trouble over his wife attempting to smuggle opium. An attempt is being made to get this story confirmed or definitely refuted. The Birjand is are in fact all hoping that Mirza Ahmed will soon be reappointed to his former post in place of the present Postmaster Mirza Muhammed Kassim Khan, who is a worthless and mischievous rascal. The Finance Department. —Three Mirzas from Tehran passed through Birjand in a carriage on the 31st August for Sistan. Crime in Sistan. —The house of a Customs official at Daulatabad near Deh Dost Muhammad was recently invaded and property, including a rifle and some cash, was carried off.

News has been received in Meshed that the Mntawalli Bashi of the Shrine has been dismissed and that Mirza Muhammad Sadik, Tabatabai, has been appointed in his place. Mubaiyin-us-Saltanah, late Karguzar of Turbat-i-Haidari, has arrived in Meshed. The Sardai-i-Muazzam, lately Commander of the troops in Meshed, who has been working in the Kaiguzar’s interests in Tehran, has telegraphed to the Kargu zar to say that he finds the task very difficult. Shaukat-ud-Daulah, Governor of Bakharz, whose presence is required in Meshed, has been frequently summoned by the Governor-General but has paid no heed to these orders. The Governor-General has now sent two sowars to bring him into Meshed. [Persian Affairs. The Governor-General has received orders from Tehran to assist the officials of the Finance Department in the collection of the revenue, as the money is much needed by the Persian Government and no loans or advances can be expected while the European powers are at war. The Governor-General is unwilling to^ assist the Department blindly as he has no wish to identify himself with its officials in their illegal exactions. See previous diaries. The Governor-General has again received orders from the Minister of the Interior, who informs him that Abdul Hamid Khan’s lease of the khalisa lands of Daragaz has been cancelled, to dismiss Mirza Mas’ud Khan, Governor of Daragaz : but he has neither the power nor the will to carry out the orders. See diary for the week ending August 1, M. Collard has asked the Karguzar to see that a Surveyor and a representative of the Governor-General are appointed to the Commission under Zahir-i-Humayun which is to compose all differences regarding the boundaries of Bujnurd, Daragaz, and Kalat-i-Nadn. The Karguzar has replied that the Commission will be ready to start as soon as the pay of its members, amounting to 575 turnons a month, is paid to him. Russian Affairs. Colonel Yygornitzky, recently Acting Consul in Sistan, and Mme. Vygornitzky, arrived in Meshed from Birjand on August 13th and leave in a day or two for Ashkabad. See last week’s diary. The Russian Government has not accepted Messrs. Evreinoff and Bomanovsky as Volunteers. See last week’s diary. I am informed that the 1st Semirechia Cossacks here will be relieved by a Turkoman corps. The methods and policy of M. Nicolsky differ widely from those of his pre decessor, and he appears to be anxious to retrieve the reputation of the Russian Consulate-General. Complaints from Persians received prompt attention and their grievances are redressed when possible. With regard to Kardash Bala and his brothers, who are detained on a charge of murder, M. Nicolsky has caused proclama tion to be made in the city inviting ail Persians having claims against the prisoners to come forward without delay. There is a similar improvement in the attitude of the Russian Consulate-General to this Consulate-General. It is reported that the Russians are extending their railway line from Russian Sarakhs to Pul-i-Khatun. Kasim Beg, the Russian Tajir Bashi, is now suspected of comphcity in the murder of Alioff. It is believed that he will shortly be dismissed. India, Foreigh Secretary's • No 39 M, ctated 24 SEP 1914- 2 Foreign Affairs. Horr Roelich the Austrian Dentist, fhas returned to Meshed and will now probably mak no attempt to return home, though he says that he is a lieutenant in th.6 reserve. The son of the shopkeeper Hoffman has started for Tehran with a view to making his way to Germany. His father asked M. Nicolsky to have him stopped, but w!s informed that the Russian Consulate-General had no longer anything to do with Germans. British /nterests—Believing that the publication of accurate news of the war would be interesting and perhaps useful, I permitted the communication of the gist of such news as reaches me to the three loca newspapers, the Tus the “ NauBahdr, ’ and the “ AgaH’. The editor of the Nan Bahar has acknow ledged my courtesy by publishing some extremely offensive comments on the news. I have now, of course, prohibited the communication of news to the local press and am taking other steps. Mirza Mehdi Khan has been appointed agent to the Imperial Bank of Persia at Nishabur and the Governor-General has kindly given him letters to the local authorities there. Arms Traffic. I am informed that many of the rifles smuggled from Khorasan into Afghanis tan are brought from Tehran. I am having enquiries made. It is reported that 20 Kurramis of the Andri tribe arrived at Herat via the Hazarajat on August 29, with 500 rifles of Kabul make for sale. The Russians are said to have asked’the Afghan Boundary Pillar C ommissioners to divide the Commission into three sections in order that fihey mav begin work from three points at once. The Afghan Commissioners have solicited the Governor s orders on the subject. Naib Salar, the new commander of the troops, is said to be about to visit Mai- mana to inspect the frontier. Turbat News. See diary for the week ending July 18 Ahmad Agha has not been punished for wounding two officials of the Finance Department in Turbat-i-Haidari, but has been sent to Meshed. The Russian Legation in Tehran is said to have called upon the Consul for an explanation of his interference in the case. Political Summary.

Aghazada, on the other hand, has telegraphed to support the appointment of Saiyyid Muhammad Sadik Tabatabai, and it is hoped that this appointment will be confirmed. Persian Affairs. Mirza Mas’ud Khan has, as a precautionary measure, removed Abdul Hamid from Mahmudabad to a village less easily accessible. The war continues to arouse interest in Meshed. The people amuse them selves by fabricating reports of Russian reverses, and rumours that Turkey has captured Sevastopol and reconquerred Transcaucasia, and the Tsar’s recent visit to Moscow is evidently the foundation for a widely circulated rumour to the effect that Russia has removed her capital from St. Petersburg to Moscow. M JV S l '! POrt c d , t , hat the tuil : ulent Sai y id Sahib Zamani of Resht has arrived at Meshed and my Colleague is making enquiries as to the truth of the rumour. Russian Affairs. __ . Bussian Officer calling himself Sikandar Khan has arrived at Meshed from Turbat-i-Haidan, en route for Russian territory. His destination is not definitely . ^ sported that two Bussian Cossacks have murdered a woman at Kuchan It is said that the woman tried to prevent them from stealing grapes and it is believ* ed that the men then attempted to ravish her. I learn that the murder of the man Aliofi has not been brought home to Kardash Bala and his brothers and that Kardash Bala attributes bis implication in the case to the Tajirbashi, who is likely to suffer in consequence. Claims against Kardash Bala are daily being registered in the Bussian Consulate-General. My Colleague has notified to the Karguzar that no passports should be issued to Persian subjects intending to travel to Mecca via Russia, as thev will not be permitted to travel through Russia. The Karguzar has telegraphed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs for orders on the subject. M. Romanovsky has left Meshed for Ashkabad and is expected to be absent for ten days. He is escorting his sister back to Russia, but I am not aware whether his journey has any other object. My Colleague has brought pressure to bear upon the local authorities in the case of a Persian accused of abducting the wife a Russian subject, and a servant of the Russian Consulate-General was sent to Khurramabad near Chinaran whithor the woman had been taken to bring her back to Meshed. She proved however to be a common prostitute. ^ wcvei I learn from Sarakhs that 700 men from the 9th Turkistan battalion and 11 &lt;; Turkoman sowars with all available wheeled transport have been withdrawn to India, Foreign Secretary’s No 3 9M, dated 24 SEP 1914 •£ol \ 11?

Haii Shuia-ul-Mulk, Governor of Bakharz, has unsuccessfully attempted to dissuade'his son-in-law, Muhammad Amir Khan, from going to Turkistan as ordered by the Amir. The Naib-us-Saltanah has sent a thousand pairs of Kabul-made boots for sale in Herat. The Governor of Gulran has reported to the Governor of Herat the arrival of 10 families of Sangchuli Taimuri immigrants from Persia They will probably be foCed by others as Nusrat-ul-Mulk, the present Chief of these Taimurn, is not popular. It is' reported that the Russians are erecting new buildings on the north-west of Shaikh Junaid. The Afghan boundary pillar commission has been well received by the Rnssians at Kara Tepe but a difference of opinion exists regarding the scope of the duties of the ioint commission. The Russians wish to erect new pillars where the distance betw-een the old pillars is so great as to leave the exact position of the boundary line uncertain but the Afghans maintain that their orders restrict them to the repair and restoration of old pillars. The Afghans have solicited orders from the Governor of Herat. Political Summary. Condition of Country.—Hap Sbuja-ul-Mulk, Governor of Bakharz, bas captured at Hushtadan three of a gang of six robbers who had carried thither a large quantity of plunder from Sabzawar, west of Meshed, and has taken them to Ausufabad. Condition of Roads.-The road between Kuchan and Bajgiran is said to be unsafe and the Governor of Kuchan has asked the Governor-General for 30 additional men.

Mobilization. —On July 31st, all troops in summer camps, both in the 1st and 2nd Turkistan Army Corps, were recalled to the headquarters of their units, and mobilization orders were issued throughout Russian Turkistan. Reliable information, received from Baku, states that 6| millions of men are being mobilized in Russia, reservists of the class of 1906 having been called up ; the despatch of reservists of the first class from Baku by train has been attended with disgraceful occurrences at the entraining station, where the reservists and their relatives stoned the troop trains, and killed an engine driver and police officer. A similar report has been received from Kagan (New Bokhara). On August 1st it w^s generally notified that until further orders-no goods, and only ajjlimited number of passengers, will be carried on the Central Asian Rail way, the line being reserved for military traffic. The object of the mobilization appears to be the despatch of ti oops to Euro pean Russia ;.no indication has yet been given that troops are being sent to the Turkish frontier. 446.

Oxus Railway. —Notwithstanding mobilization and the consequent dis location of business, work is reported to be proceeding on the construction of the line. Since July 31st Bokharan soldiers have replaced the guards and patrols, hitherto found by the company, 13th Turkistan Rifle Regiment, in charge of the railway construction material, collected in depots (reference paragraph 371). An observer reports (August 1st) that the line from Kagan towards Karshi is com pleted and ready for traffic, for a distance of 12 miles, and is connected with the main line of the Central Asian Railway at a point 2 miles to the east of Kagan railway station. This information confirms that recorded in paragraph 362. The “ Askhabad ” newspaper of August 1st, however, states that rails are laid from Kagan for a distance of only 3j miles, to a place named Barghmana, where the pr incipal workshops will be located ; the same authority states that earthwork is being carried out for a distance of 66 miles in the direction of Karshi, but that, owing to the desertion of many of the workmen, engaged recently in Persia, the construction of the more important portions of the fine will not be undertaken until the spring of 1915.

In the result they received most of their goats and sheep back.

Gun-Running. —Some Ghilzais of Saddaki in Sistan under the leadership of Khan Muhammad have returned from Kerman with 50 rifles. A party of Afghans from Kandahar, Garmsel and Chahar Burjak recently j visited Sistan in quest of rifles, but eventually returned empty handed. Afghan News. —See Diary No. 29.

Persian Officials. The Karguzar, who find his post at Meshed very profitable, has telegraphed to his friend Sardar-i-Mu’azzam, lately Commander of the troops in Meshed, asking him to use his influence to prevent his dismissal. He has offered to outbid any other candidate for the post. The Governor-General has also telegraphed to Tehran recommending the retention of the Karguzar. Persian Affairs. The news of the outbreak of war in Europe has aroused much interest here. The Persians profess to be disappointed by the news that Great Britain and Russia are fighting side by side. The Governor-General has again been ordered by telegram to dismiss Mirza Mas’ud Khan, the Governor of Daragaz, but he is too wise to pay any attention to such orders. M. Nicolsky has again refused to help Abdul Hamid Khan. Hatim Khan, brother of Salar Khan, the Baluch, has murdered one Husain Khan, whom he invited to his house as a guest. The Governor-General has called on Salar Khan for an explanation of this matter. Apprehensions are expressed in some quarters that the withdrawal of the Russian troops may lead to disorder, but I see no reason why it should. I propose to warn the Governor-General, in a friendly way, that he has now an opportunity of proving that the presents of the Russian troops is not necessary to the preserva tion of order. It is rumourei that the Russians propose to replace the Cossacks with Turkomans, and the rumour has caused some anxiety, but I have no reason to believe it to be true. The price of sugar, petroleum, and other imports from Russia has greatly risen since the receipt of news of the outbreak of war, and it is probable that there will be some failures among the merchants of Meshed, as the importation of Russian goods is temporarily suspended. There is at present much smuggling of fire-arms from Meshed to Afghanistan, and the Governor-General has appointed an agent to inform him of sales of arms in Meshed. Haji Jan Baz Khan, one of the men recently killed at Mahmudabad, is said to have been a British subject from the Zhob district, but he never came near this Consulate-General. The Lawanis are said to be preparing to attack Shaukat-ud- Daulah in order to avenge the death of their fellow tribesmen. Russian Affairs. The detachment of the 18th Turkistani Rifle Regiment with their Machine- guns, left Meshed for Russia on August 2, and had a good send-off from the Persian troops, who were paraded in the square of the citadel to bid them farewell. The first Semirechia Cossacks are under orders to be ready to move at four hours’ notice, and have sold all their belongings by auction. M. and Mme. Ivrenoff arrived in Meshed on August 2. Both M. Ivrenoff and M. Romanovsky have volunteered for the war. M. Nicolsky doubts whether their offers will be accepted but speaks rather ruefully of the chance of being left alone at Meshed. Arfa-ul-Mamalik, head Munshi of the Russian Consulate-General, has arrived m Meshed. It is to be hoped that business will now be more regularly despatched, M. Nicolsky, who has the laudable habit of attending personally to all business, has been much handicapped by the want of a Munshi. M. Nicolsky has informed the Karguzar officially and me privately that the Trans-Caspian Railway has been closed to goods traffic for a month.G. M. Press, Simla.—No. C. 395 F. D.—9-9-14.—28.—C.W.M. 2 See last week’s diary. A corpse, supposed to be that of Ahoff the Russian sub ect who was murdered by, or at the instigation of Kardash Bala and his brothers, has been found by Sistanis who were digging a grave for a child m the Bala T^ivahan cemetery The body was in an advanced stage of decomposition, but was fiified by means of an armlet found on it and of marks on. the clothmg. A bullet had entered the throat and passed out through the skull. M Frank the Kussian Jew, has agreed to supply 3,000 Persian labourers for the extension of the Central Asian Railway, and has sought the Karguzar s assistance. The recruitment of labourers is probably hindered by a rumour to the effect that some of those who left Meshed earlier in the year have been murdered by Afghans. (Secret). The Karguzar has been taken to task by the Mmister of Foreign Affairs for the assistance already given by him in this matter. Herr Roelich the Austrian dentist, has left Meshed. I believe he has gone to Bujnurd, but he intended to return to Austria. He is not likely to reach his home. Herr Waldmann and his assistant left Meshed hurriedly for Germany. Ido not know by what route they are travelling. Hoffman, a German Shopkeeper here, who was under Russian protection, has been foolish enough to annoy the Russians by boasting of what Germany is likely to do. He will be very roughly handled if he is not careful. M. Nicolsky has warned him to look to himself. Herat News. On July 30, Naib Salar, the new General, addressed the Military Officers at Herat, warning them that he required their obedience. He also ordered them to give him lists of the bad characters in the regiments under their command. The Russian Officers appointed to discuss the sites of the boundary pillars have not yet met their Afghan Colleagues. A number of families have emigrated from the Bakharz district to Ghurian. The Governor of Herat has ordered them to be sent to Herat. Political Summary. Condition of Country. The Goklan Turkomans have long contemplated a raid on the Tehran road, buttheChief of Bujnurd is taking steps to prevent them and has already posted 50 sawars at Dasht. Condition of Roads. A gang of twelve robbers has been active on the Kuchan road. They recently robbed four Zafaranlu Kurds and killed a Jew. They also robbed Abdul Karim Bukharai at the village of Tavil. Twenty sawars, sent after the robbers by the Governor of Kuchan, came up with them at Bid-i-Khum, killed their leader Mir Alam, wounded two or three of them, and recovered their spoil, including a woman, a girl, and a boy whom they were taking off for sale to the Turkomans.

Haslimat-iil-Multi . The negotiations towards settlement of our claims against this young Sardar are progressing, slowly but perhaps surely. We have been offered possession of certain estates which, however, are not worth much more than a 1 1 e amount of our claim. Subsequently, the Minister of the Interior has tele graphed to the Governor that he must endeavour to conclude the case. Now, Hashmat has wired to his father and to Shaukat-ul-Mulk to satisfy us if possible. It remains to be seen what terms will be offered. It is tolerably certain that the family possess little ready money, as the Governor himself [has overdrawn his account with the Imperial Bank to the extent of 10,000 Tomans. Landed pro perty in Kainat hitherto has been estimated at a very high value, but it is feared that prices will soon begin to d^op if the war lasts many weeks. Baluch Raids.— ^ Diary No. 17. Mr. Gabler has at last received back the camel stolen from Dehaneh Bagheh by Aibu. Presumably the Sistan Karguzar’s communication to the Chakhansur Authorities on the subject of the raiders in general has had something to do with this satisfactory result. Aibu himself brought the animal to Sardar Gurdil Khan, and the latter is now protesting that It was not Aibu who stole it, but one Ata Muhammad, Kharot, of Deh Dost Muham mad, from whom Aibu bought it! Revenue Befartwmt, Sistan. —The Finance Agent, Ebtihaj-us-Sultan, has received a telegram from M. Mornard impressing upon him the necessity for collect ing all outstanding revenues, as, in consequence of the war, the Government can borrow no money from outside.

The Karnuzar has been severely censured by the Foreign Minister for having departed from raecedent in the reception accorded to M. Nicolsky on his arrival at Kuchan. ^ The Karguzar is accepting bribes freely and with verv little ettemnf i menh It is persistently reported that heias been or LlbouUoS^-^^d my Russian Colleague is said to have sent a complaint against him to the Russian Minister in Tehran. On the other hand the Karguzar is said to be sending drafts Minister. 11 ' ^ ^ t0 be applied t0 the g ratific ation of the Foreign Persian Mffairs—Mirza Mas’ud Khan has been making extensive preparations 0r f ® nGe t at P) “ a g az and has been buying rifles, smuggling large quantities of cartridges from Russia, and enlisting sawars. He is said to have 132 sowars armed with Russian Magazine rifles, 64 armed with Werndls, and 146 armed wkh Russian Birzanka' rifles. The rest of his men are armed with various rifles One ot his recruits is a Customs sawar who was dismissed for not preventing the smuggling of cartridges by Mirza Mas’ud Khan. M. Mornard, although his resigna tion has been reported by Reuter has again telegraphed to ask the Governor- General to punish Mirza Masud Khan, but the Governor-General has wisely resolved to leave him alone. He is very strong and if attacked will certainly be helped, either directly or indirectly, by Russians. It is said that Zahir Humayun and Mirza Ahmad Khan have been appointed the latter as Surveyor, to meet Russian agents and determine the Russo-Persian boun dary in the neighbourhood of Bujnurd, Daragaz, and Kalat-i-Nadiri, but that the Treasurer-General has reduced the pay of these two officials, which was fixed at 200 and 100 tumans, by half, and that they are not now willing to serve. The Governor-General has telegraphed to Turbat-i-Haidari ordering the Governor to send the complainants against Mirza Khalil Khan to Meshed without delay, as it is necessary that the man should be brought to trial Russian Affairs .—The three brothers Kardash Bala, Husain Bala and Dadayoff, Russian subjects well known in Meshed as ruffians, are under arrest on suspicion of having murdered another Russian subject named Alioffi M. Nicolsky has caused it to be proclaimed in the town that any person giving trustworthy information regarding the murder will be rewarded. The wife of one Meshedi Zain-ul-Abidin has been summoned from Ashakabad for trial here as an accomplice. The villagers of Andrukh on the Kakhka road have come into Meshed to complain of the conduct of Nasrullah Garichi, a Russian subject, who has taken the caravanserai there on lease. Nasrullah, on the other hand, complains that his life is in danger, and the Karguzar has sent the villagers to my Russian Colleague in answer to his complaint. On July 23rd, a Russian named Ivan appeared before Haji Fazil Mujtahid pronounced the Kalima and accepted Islam. He was then sent to the Shrine dis pensary for circumcision but Naib-ut-Tauliya, who is in charge of the Shrine reported the case to the Governor-General and Ivan was sent to the Karguzari and thence to the Russian Consulate-General, where he says that pressure was brought to bear on him to induce him to become a Musalman. M. Nicolsky has asked the Karguzar to go into the case. I am told that M. Nicolsky has called up his whole establishment and warned them that any one found speaking disrespectfully to Persians of the British Con sulate-General will be dismissed, and that he intends to ask me to issue a simliar warning to my establishment As' India, Foreign Secretary’s No gS M, dated 3 SEP 1914 V 2^2 Heeat NeWSj XT -U flip now General for Herat, arrived there on July 21st and Nal ; w S r ? b ’ the Governor in the Chahar Bagh.

Thp Shah’s coronation was celebrated at Turbat-i-Haidari by a reception and a dinner party. At the latter the health of His Majesty the King-Emperor was proposed by the Karguzar and the Russian Consul proposed the health of the British Agent. Kariz News.

Condition of Country.—The attack on the Lawanis who were smuggling arms in the Bakharz districts has disturbed the Afghans in the neighbourhood and they may possibly attempt reprisals. See last week’s diary. The remnant of Ali Jauzi s band, which has been committing enormities at Dizabad, was attacked by the sawars of Mu tamad- ul-Ayalah and Hadi “ Dastburida ”, who was with them was killed. Some of the gang were wounded and others taken prisoners. The followers of Rais-ut-Tujjar and of Farhad Mirza, Ilbegi, have come to blows over the village of Kasimabad, of which Rais-ut-Tujjar recently took forcible possession. There were six casualties on both sides and the parties are preparing for a second fight. T. W. HAIG, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General in Khorasan. G. M. Press, vSimla.-Ko.

The WW -News was received in Birjand of the outbreak of war between i n f a “i an d J ' , ie ''j 1 - The people of Birjand were inclined to be jubi lant at the first news of the conflagration in Europe, but the carpet-making com- munity see the matter in a different light now, as they have large stocks in Meshed which will remain unsold for an indefinite time. The Manager of the Imperial Bank has also had to refuse many drafts, having received orders telegraphically from Meshed not to undertake any business with Europe for the present J Condition of the Province. —The inhabitants of the village of Noghan near Khur’ which is situated on the horde y half paying revenue to Kainat and half to Tabas, have lately refused to pay any taxes to the Kainat collectors, instigated, so it is said by the Naib of the Governor of Tabas. His Excellency Shaukatuil-Mulk sent 20 sowars to Noghan on the 29th July’ who returned with eight prisoners on the 4th August, one being the Naib and the others recalcitrant Kainat is. Baluch Raiders.—{a) From Lutak I hear that Taj Muhammad Khan, Reki, who had gone to Narmashir with a large following and many pack animals, for the purpose of buying grain, has returned without achieving his object. A number of his camels were identified as stolen property and were confiscated by the Governor of Narmashir after some trouble. (b) Two small tribes of Sarhaddis, named Zahrakzai and Kurkhel, have migrated to Farah in Afghanistan, after giving a douceur of 30 sheep to the Border Khans. It was these people who looted the camels of Muhammad Hasan of Mud, the Russian Telegraph Transport Contractor—see Diary No. 34 of 1913, The Persian Parliament. —The Sistan election has resulted in the success of Muaddil-ud-Dauleh, the Governor's nominee, with 475 votes. The other eight candi dates were all local Mullahs who polled 267 votes between them. The result is a most surprising and satisfactory demonstration of the influence already acquired by His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk. It is also apparent that the ticket-distributing Agents must have cautioned the voters against nominating any of the three Anglo- phobe celebrities mentioned in this Consulate Diary No. 27, The Customs Department at Koh Malik Siah. —See last week's diary.

The Minister of the Interior has again telegraphed to the Governor-General urging him to restore order in Daragaz, which is a district under his jurisdiction, and the Governor-General has again replied that he is not responsible'for what has occurred there as M. Mornard acted in the matter without consulting him. M. Mornard has written a private letter in French to the Governor-General asking him to help Abdul Hamid and punish Mirza Mas’ud Khan. Both the Minister of the Interior and M. Mornard will do well to leave the case alone. Abdul Hamid Khan is a rogue who has met with his deserts and it is a great pity that M. Mornard ever had any dealings with him. Mirza Khalil Khan is still on bail. It was represented to the Governor-General that the first surety was not sufficient and he again arrested Mirza Khalil Khan and compelled him to furnish another and more satisfactory surety. M. Nicolsky informs me that he has telegraphed to the Russian Minister in Tehran for instruc tions whether he is to interest himself in this case, and has asked me not to insist that Mirza Khalil Khan shall be brought to trial until an answer is received. I have agreed to wait. M. Collard recently wrote me to say that he was surprised to hear from M. Mornard that I had complained of his not answering my letters, and added that his office registers showed that not one letter of mine remained unanswered. I replied by sending him a list of unanswered letters and by informing him that I had done him the justice to say that I did not consider that he was personally responsible as I believed that he was in the hands of his Persian subordinates. Persian Affairs. The Governor-General has directed the Governors of all districts in Khorassan to prohibt, under pain of severe punishment, the sale of liquor by Persian subjects. Naib-ut-Tauliya has been placed in charge of the affairs of the Shrine during the absence of the Mutawalli Bashi. The coronation of the Shah was celebrated at Meshed on July 21 st. In the morning the Governor-General reviewed the troops. In the afternoon he and the Karguzar received me, Major Marsh, Captain Thorburn, and the leading British subjects and afterwards my Russian Colleague and the leading Russian subjects. At 8 p.m. he gave an official dinner party, at which I proposed the health of the Shah. The Governor-General replied by proposing the health of the King, the Karguzar proposed the health of the Tsar and M. Nicolsky replied by proposing the health of the Heir-Apparent to the Persian throne. Tire various National Anthems were played by the band of the 1st Semirechia Cossacks. After dinner the company witnessed fireworks in the square of the citadel, which w T as elaborately illuminated and decorated, from the roof of the guard house. Both Consulates-General were decorated and illuminated. On July :22nd the Manager of the Imperial Bank gave a garden party, which was attended by the Governor-General, the Karguzar, Persian Officials and the leading men at Meshed, the two Consul-Generals and their staffs, and tne officers of the Russian garrison. Mr. Wilkinson’s hospitality was much appreciated by all and especially by the officers of the 1st Semirechia Cossacks. Russian Affairs. Under instructions from the Russian Minister at Tehran my Colleague has stopped the work on the Me^hed-Bajgiran road at Kuchan, which had been under taken by the Finance Department. The work is to be carried out by the Persian Government and the Russians jointly, arrangements for the payment of Rais-ut- Tujjar’s debt of 360,000 tumans to the Russian Bank having been made.

India, Foreign Secretary’s No $5 m, dated 27 AUG 1914 Sistan and Kain Consulate Diary No. 31 for the week ending the 1 st August 1914. 26th July. —Monsieur Bomanovsky, the new Bussian Vice-Consul, accompan ied by his wife and child, reached Birjand from Meshed. 30th July. Colonel Vygornitzky, the relieved Acting Bussian Vice-Consul, left Birjand for St. Petersburg.- His wife accompanies him. The English community of Birjand and Sistan regret their departure extremely. This Officer’s relations with Shankat-ul-Mulk have also Been quite harmonious in spite of the Governor’s well-known antipathy for Bussians in general. Baluch raids.' —The Sarhaddi Baluchis are in some straits about provisioning themselves with corn this year. A party of Bekis under Hayat Khan, father-in- law of Mir Jehind Yar, Ahmedzai, and Lashkaran recently sent a present of a five- chambered rifle from Dozdab to the Deputy Governor of Sistan, but even then apparently did not venture to come into Sistan. They went instead to Mashi in Afghanistan, on the southern side of the Helmand, for the purpose of buying wheat from Kadkhuda Mirak, Kudbudani, their gun-running friend. It is said that a considerable number of Bekis, Shahozais and Gumshadzais— 400 or 500 familes—have already migrated to Bandar Kamal Khan (Afghanistan) and Khar an (?). Mir Yahub Khan, Sanjerani. —See Diary No. 27. The Political Agent, Chagai, has heard that this man is trying to obtain service in the new Kainat Army, but His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk assures me that he has received no communication from him and that there is no possibility of his being entertained. From Chakhon- sur I hear that the Amir of Afghanistan has issued a Farman permitting Amir Khan, Yakub Khan’s eldest brother, who up to now has remained in Chagai, to settle at Mirabad. The other village granted to this family is called Deh Kadkhuda Barfi. The Gurgich Kaud-village case.—See Diary No. 26. Kadkhudas Nawab Khan and Sher Muhammad Khan have come to Birjand from Afghanistan and have been kindly received and entertained by the Governor. They will presumably accom pany His Excellency down to Sistan. Russian Adairs.—There is friction between M. Bomanovsky and the local authorities already. Colonel Vygornitzky seems to have told the Governor and the Karguzar that the new arrival was a Consul, but this is believed not to be a fact. The Governor in consequence only sent out a small and informal Istilcbcil party to meet the Officer. M. Bomanovsky was rather supercilious in his attitude towards the people who went to meet him and did not pay as much regard to their feelings as they considered their due in the season of Ramzan. M. Bomanovsky and the Karguzar have not exchanged visits yet, as each claims the first call. When the Karguzar came to Birjand in May last he, as the new comer, called on both Mr. New and myself first, and doubtless called similarly on Vygornitzky. The Customs Department at Koh Malik Siah.- The local Director, Mirza Abu Turab recently attempted to commit suicide by swallowing 3 drachms of opium, on detecting his sigha wife in a liaison with his servant. The British Indian Post master of the International Exchange Office, saved his life by pouring hot water, in which a quantity of copper coins had been boiled, down his throat and making him vomit up the opium ! Genekal.CONFIDENTIAL. Aleshed Diary No. 29, lor the week ending the I 8 th July 1914. . Persian Officials.—It fortunately appears to be untrue that the Chief of Bujnurd received orders to attack Mirza Mas’ud Khan at Daragaz. He has taken no action aud intends to take none. When Nusrat-ul-Mulk was driving from the Shrine on the night of July 12th he was fired at. The bullet entered the carriage, but missed its mark. His escort of Taimuri sowars failed to capture the man who fired the shot, who is suspected to have been Meshedi Ghulam, a Russian subject. Secret —Persian Foreign Minister has taken the Karguzar to task for the receptions given to M. Nicolsky at Kuchan and Meshed and M. Mikhailoff at Turbat-i-Haidari, on the ground that it is not customary to give official receptions to the acting incumbents of Consular posts. It is reported that the Mutawalli Bashi has been dismissed and that Mirza Saiyid Muhammad Sadik, Tabatabai, has been appointed in his place. The Kargulzar has recently been subjected to annoyance by Kardash Bala, the well-known ruffianly Russian subject in Meshed, who has threatened to shoot him unless he shows him more favour in settling his cases. The Karguzar at Turbat-i-Haidari has been elected a member of the new Majlis. Persian Affairs .—Haji Shaikh-ur-Rais is reported to have preached on the Bahai doctrines in the mosque of that sect in Askhabad. He has long been suspected of leanings towards that faith and his action at Askhabad seems to indicate that he has openly embraced it. Four Lawanis belonging to the gun-running gang of Dust Muhammad were recently attacked by the sowars of Shaukat-ud-Daulah near Mahmudabad and three were killed. The fourth escaped. Two of Shaukat-ud-DaulalTs sowars were killed and one was wounded. Dust Muhammad apparently expected trouble, for his horse went astray and he went after it, so that he was not with his men on this occasion. Dust Muhammad was recently in Meshed and left the town on July 10th, after buying some rifles. It appears likely that the Daragaz affair will be amicably settled. Abdul Hamid, who is still in Mirza Mas’ud Khan’s hands, has already relinquished his lease and paid 10,000 tumans. Mirza Mas’ud Khan demands another 10,000 and Abclul Hamid has sent to Meshed for it. This sum will enable Mirza Mas’ud Khan to put himself right with the Governor-General and the Minister of the Interior and Abdul Hamid will probably be released. Mirza Khalil Khan has, at the instance of my Russian Colleague, been released on bail. I have expressed, both to the Governor-General and M. Nicolsky, the hope that he will not be allowed to escape again. The Karguzar has informed me that he cannot concern himself further in the case. M. Nicolsky has asked me not to press for an immediate trial as he has written to Turbat-i-Haidari for further information and to Tehran for instructions. The matter is thus at rest for the present. M. Collard recently granted a lease of the Khalisa lands of Sarakhs fco Murtaza Mirza, the mad prince who is awaiting his trial for murder. The Governor- General informed M. Collard that Murtaza Mirza could not be permitted to leave Meshed and warned him that the grant of a lease to Murtaza Mirza over the local Governor’s head would produce another disturbance like that at Daragaz. M. Collard has cancelled the lease. ' Supervisors have arrived at Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam and are distributing fresh voting papers.

The Russian Consul at Astarabad is said to be extending his influence in that province, which is rapidly becoming Russianized. It is reported that one of the Russian Cossacks has disappeared from Meshed 'with his rifle. o pp last week’s diary.

British Affairs. —Jean della Rocca, a Maltese British subject and a well-known roeue has left Meshed for Shahrud, where he hopes to obtain an employment from Prmce Amir-i-A’zam. Should he succeed I hope to be able to pemuade Am.r-i- A’zam to “emit part of his salary to me, in order that I may pay his debts. His papers have been confiscated. Norat News —The Governor of Dai Zangi has informed the Governor of Herat that the Barbaris who wish to emigrate to Persia fled from Dai Zangi owing to the Amir’s order that one man in eight of the tribe should be enhsted for the army. He has asked the Governor of Herat to send them back to Dai Zangi. Muhammad Naim Khan has been appointed Commandant of the troops at Herat. A commission has been appointed for the reconstruction of the boundary D illars between Russian and Afghan territory. The Commissioners are Haji Mulla Aziz Khan, brother of late General Ghias-ud-Din Khan, Muhammad Yusuf Khan, Adjutant, Risaladar Yar Muhammad Khan, and Khalik Dad Khan. They have a large establishment. They anticipate trouble with the Russians. Condition of country.—The Turkomans of Goklan recently prepared to raid the Tehran road in the neighbourhood of Shahrud and the guard at Dasht was increased from Bujnurd. I hear that the Chief of Bujnurd has sttacked the Turkomans and killed some of them. In consequence of a demand for compensation for robbery the Persian shop keepers at Bajgiran have closed their shops. The Bakharz district is disturbed owing to a tribal dispute over a woman.

A consignment of 400 lengths of rail arrived at Charjui, June 29th, from the west, and was unloaded on the bank of the Oxus for shipment up-stream.

Haji Shaikh-ur-Rais, who has gone to Constantinople, has also been summoned. Shazada Rais-i-Aukaf has been elected to the new Majlis for Nishapur, of which place his brother-in-law, Fath-us-Saltanah, is Governor. Shuja-ud-Daulah is said to be working in Tehran for reinstatement as Governor of Kuchan. Persian Affairs. See diary for the week ending June 27th. Abdul Hamid Khan, having given up his share m the lease of the Daragaz lands, and given Mirza Mas’ud Khan a certificate to the effect that he has been well treated, is now receiving better treat- ment. The report that he was wounded appears to be untrue, and he has telegraphed ^ h ?, 1S ? 1Ve , jj nd 'T 11- Tlle Govem °r-General has again informed the Minister for koreign Affairs that he can do nothing in this case. M. Collard blames the revenue gendarmes for having assisted Abdul Hamid, though he him self sent them with Abdul Hamid for this purpose. It appears to be doubtful whether the Chief of Bujnurd will obey the orders which he has received from Tehran to attack Mirza Mas’ud Khan. My Russian colleague, who appears to be anxious about this matter, has telegraphed to the Chiefs Russian tutor asking him to do what he can to prevent the Chief from start ing. This tutor appears to work as a Russian Agent in Bujnurd. I hear that the orders issued to the Chief have been countermanded. My Russian colleague and his assistant are still interesting themselves in the case of Mirza Khalil Khan. They appeared to be under the impression that Mirza Khalil Khan was being badly treated, but M. Romanovsky visited him and satis fied himself that he was well looked after and was receiving the medical treatment which he requires. I have told both M. Nicolsky and M. Romanovsky that all that I wish for is a fair trial. M. Collard has informed Captain Thorburn that his establishment have tele graphed to Tehran threatening to resign in connection with the case of Mirza Khalil Khan. Their contention apparently is that no employe of the Finance Department should ever be called to account for any misdeeds. On being informed that it would be a good thing if all the present staff left the Department, M. Collard said that he did not believe that they would carry out their threat. Russian Affairs. The Minister of the Interior has asked the Govern or-General for a return of the Russian troops now in Khorasan. See last week’s diary. The Russian traveller Thaddeus Ritzkowsky has left Meshed for Tehran, en route to India, via Isfahan and Shiraz. My Russian colleague is much displeased with the Karguzar for the activity which he has displayed in Mirza Khalil Khan’s case and will probably ask for his dismissal. See last week’s news. Ahmed Agha, son of the interpreter to the Russian Con sulate at Turbat-i-Haidari, who fired at and wounded two employes of the Finance Department, has been surrendered by the Russian Consul to the Karguzar. He will probably be fined, flogged, and deported from Turbat-i-Haidari. t | India, Foreign c No 3 3 IV!, dated f* /12 The Officer Commanding the Russian troops at Meshed has called for tenders for a contract to supply bread, grain, fodder, etc., to the troops between Meshed and Bajgiran for one year. Herat News. See diary for the week ending June 27. About 400 Barbari families from Dai zangi, wishing to emigrate to Meshed, have been stopped in Herat and told to represent their grievances to the Amir. Orders have been issued to the frontier officials to turn back all Barbaris leaving Afghanistan for Persia. There has been some fighting between two sections of the Jamshidi tribe and a guard has been sent to bring the elders of the tribe into Herat. The Russians have encroached on Afghan soil in the neighbourhood of Chashma- yi-Muhammad Hasan. The Commandant of Shaikh Junaid has apologized for the encroachment and promised to see that it is not repeated. Risaladar Yar Muhammad Khan is said to have become very friendly with the Russians. Political Summary. Condition of Country. The country is generally quiet. The Daragaz affair seems to be settled and unless M. Mornard or the Chief of Bujnurd take any further steps there will probably be peace in this district. Condition of Roads. Two Russian Cossacks are said to have robbed a Russian subject of 1,000 roubles on the road near Kuchan. So long as they confine their attention to their own countrymen the general tranquillity of the roads will not be affected. T. W.

I understand that he has invited or willinvite them to visit Sistan, giving, if necessary, a guaran tee from me that they will be free to leave after the discussion of terms has been completed. (2) Mr. Gabler, who is still at Koh Malik Siah, has heard that Mir Jehind is constructing ‘ Sangars’ at Taftan Koh, a fact which is not incompatible with the Sardar’s desire to make peace if possible. (3) Mr. Gabler has also formed an unfavourable opinion as to the efficiency of the Bahlori and Shebak irregulars who accompanied Sahib Jam to Koh Malik Siah. I may therefore remark that the force which is being trained in Birjand by drill-instructors, amongst whom is a Persian ex-Cossack 4 Colonel ’, has no connection with the tribal levies who were mostly collected at Neh.

It is certain that Mirza Mas’ud Khan visited Kuchan when M Romanovski was there and that it is not easy to discover a reason for his visR The Governor-General has written a letter to Mirzii Mas’ud Khan severely censuring Inm for his conduct and ordering him to send his prisoners to Meshed and to s.T mit to the Persian Government any appeal he may have to make. It was ot course, Naiyir-ud-Daulah s duty to write in this strain, but I doubt whether he really regrets the occurrence at Daragaz, and in reply to orders which he has received bom Tehran he has pointed out the error committed by M Mornard and the Ministers and explained the difficulties of the situation. The voting for members for the Majlis is now closed but the poll has not been declared, as the period within which the objection may be lodged W yet expired. The state of the poll is as follows J g not 1. Haji Saiyid Asadullah Kazwini 2. Najd-us-Saltanah (late Deputy Governor) 3. Imad-us-Saltanah 4. Sardar-i-Mu ’ azzam (late Commander of the Troops) 5.

Thev are said to be contemplating lodging objections against Najd-us-Saltanah on the ground that he should be disqualified by having held office as Deputy Governor until shortly before the election began, against Mutawalli-yi-Masjid on the ground that he is not 30 years of age, and against ' Imad-us-Saltanah and Sardar-i-Mu'azzam on the ground that they obtained votes by means of intrigues or undue influence. If they succeed in disqualifying two of these, Shaikh Jawad may find a seat. See Diary No. 24, for the week ending June 13th.

Haji Murtaza Mirza is still at Meshed but, so tar as I can learn, has not yet Deen tried for the murder of his servant, who was described as a Russian subject. There is some doubt about his nationality and I J 10 ~~ that it can be established that he was a Russian subject. Haji Murtaza Mirza freely admits that he had him killed and says that he thinks he was mad when he gave the order. Re is always mad. Mirza Khalil Khan, who is under arrest in the Governor-GeneraTs palace, is constantly^sending me messages asking that he may be set at liberty.

Nicolsky that all that I am holding out for is a fair trial, at which I think representatives of both Consulates-General should be present. It was for this reason that I suggested that the trial should be held in the Karguzari, a suggestion which has been criticised in a local newspaper. M. Romanovsky, the elder, opposed this suggestion on the ground that the Karguzar was corrupt and proposed that a special court under the presidency of the Governor- General should try the case. I informed him that I preferred his suggestion to my own, provided that both ^Consulates-General were represented. The employes of the Finance Department threaten to strike unless proceedings against Mirz,a Khalil Khan are dropped. Persian Affairs. See diary for the week ending June 20*. The Governor-General has declared the election at Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam void and has sent fresh voting papers to the district. I hear that the Taimuris of Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam and the Hazaras of Bakharz are preparing a petition as king that all Belgians may be expelled from Persia. Russian Affairs. A peripatetic Russian named Thaddeus Ritzkowsky, of the same type as the Austrian traveller Lacon (see diary for the week ending February 14), called on me on June 30. I believe he intends to walk to India via Sistan. Ahmad Agha, son of Mirza Muhsin Khan, interpreter to the Russian Consulate at Turbat-i-Haidari, was recently at a drinking .party given by Saiyid Ahmad of the Finance Department at Turbat. He grew quarrelsome in his cups and fired at and wounded Intizam-us-Sultan and Naib Mirza Ali of the Finance Department. M. Romanovsky, the younger, has received orders transferring him to Sistan, and has for the present left for Ashkabad to meet his wife. I hear that some carpets known to have been the property of the shrine were noticed among his effects when they were being packed up. See diary for the week ending April 25. There has been some fighting near Zurabad between the retainers of Mir Aziz, the Russian subject who has taken some land on lease in that district, and those of the Ilbegi of the Taimuris. At the instance of my colleague the Ilbegi has been summoned into Meshed. Political Summary. Condition of Country. See last week's diary under the head of “ Persian Affairs ”.

(“ Askhabad ”, June 17th.) Communications. 396. Oxus Railway. —A consignment of 9,450 sleepers passed through Askhabad by rail, June 8th, from Krasnovodsk, for Kagan. An observer, who states that he travelled, early in June, from Guzar to Kagan with a Russian Engineer, in an automobile belonging to the Oxus Railway Com pany, reports that he found no signs of collection of material or of the commence ment of construction work at any places along the alignment, except at Kagan. He states that from a point, 700 yards distant from the main line of the Central Asian Railway, and two miles from Kagan Railway Station, and to the south-east of it, the branch line is already laid and completed as far as Chitaarik, some six or eight miles to the south, as already reported in paragraph 355 {a) ; *he asserts that the main i&amp;K&amp;canch lines are not connected by rails. He further states that A ( V India. For;::c;i Secr.iwj b!o B 5? .71. datedat Kagan large stores of rails and sleepers have been collected, but that these are not sufficient for the whole line ; that tools for 8,000 workmen are waiting at Kagan for the parties who are expected, and that at present only 700 workmen are employ ed at rail-head, in extending the construction. Parties of from 50 to 60 workmen are being despatched daily from Baku, where labour is cheap, owing to the recent strikes, to Bokhara, for work on the Oxus Railway. (“ Askhabad ”, June 16th.) Many of these, however, have thrown up their contracts and deserted with the cash advanced to ^them, and the Company agents are endeavouring to recruit labour in Persia. (“ Askhabad ”, June 17th.)

General. Baluch Raids and the situation at Dehaneh Bagheh. —Mir Jehind Yar-Ahmedzai and Taj Muhammad Beki, two of the most redoubtable Sarhaddi raiders, have written to the Deputy Governor, Sistan, tendering their submission “ On the condition that they are not ill-treated.^ Their communication has not yet reached Shaukat-ul-Mulk. It remains to ,be seen whether any satisfactory settlement can be arranged without some demonstration of force. There is no doubt that the Baluchis have grown very nervous since their encounter with the Gendar merie of Kerman, and that the arrival from India of 700 good rifles *with a proportionate supply of ammunition for Shaukat-ul-Mulk has not made them more cheerful. It seems most unlikely, if negotiations are entered upon now, that Mr. Gabler and his subordinates will be in any danger of molestation for some months to come. The Navagil Tax. —Under instructions from His Majesty’s Minister, I have advised British subjects and proteges in Sistan to pay the tax on transport animals, conveying their goods, from the 22nd July 1914, on the ground that the proceeds of this tax are being spent on local works of public utility, which benefit foreigners equally with Persian subjects. The local Finance Agent has been informed that the question will be further considered after the expiry of a year. In Birjand no municipal taxes at present exist. The Revenue Department in Kainat. —Mirza Ismail Khan has suddenly announced that he has permission to leave Birjand within a week. We shall not be very torry to see the last of him as he is afflicted with a most querulous and petty mind. At the same time, he has many good points including a character for honesty and a liking for the English. His unfortunate propensity for fighting against the Governor and other officials on almost every little question that has arisen has interfered with business considerably. Sardar Khan Jehan Khan Sanjerani. —As a counter-blast to the decorating of Sardar Purdil Khan, the Karguzar has recommended to the Foreign Minister that this old Sardar should also be given the Order of the Lion and Sun. There is no doubt that the award would be a popular and suitable one, for Khan Jehan Khan is not only the oldest and most respected of the Sistan Sardars, but he seems friendly towards Shaukat-ul-Mulk, and he has apparently kept aloof from all connection with the Sarhaddi rebels. The Gurgich Raiders from, Afghanistan.—See last week’s diary. The report has been confirmed that the Chakhansur authorities have sent 30 followers of the late Umar Shah and Saiyid Khan to Farah for punishment. Inter-tribal dissensions. —The Brahui, Alam Khan of Daulatabad, has been at last compelled to restore 650 goats to the Shebak tribe (see Diary No. 47 of 1913), who are t loyal to Shaukat-ul-Mulk and who furnished, a contingent of armed men to accompany Sahib Jam recently to Koh Malik Siah. Alam Khan, who is a relation of Juma Jalal, the outlaw, is also being pressed to give compensation to Sahibdad Mirozai (see Diaries Nos. 24 and 25 of 1914).

(1) I hear that the Governor of Chakhansur has been ordered to send the followers of Umar Shah and Saiyid Khan, Gurgiches, whom he has arrest ed, to Farah for punishment. The accused men have told the Afghan authorities that they w ere quietly proceeding to Kerman and Yezd for the purpose of buying arms when they were attacked by the Birjandi camel sowars. (2) Haji Gulab has proposed to the Chakhansur authorities that Nawab Khan and Sher Muhammad of Kaud renown should be appointed Kadkhudas of Khwabgah instead of Umar Shah and Saiyid Khan deceased. The Afghan authorities however, wish to settle them further from the frontier. The Gurgiches already at Khwabgah under Jahangir and Dad Muhammad are anxious to be allowed to settle in Persian Sistan. Arms from India for the Persian droops.—See last week’s Diary. Sahib Jam duly ! took over, on the 26th June, the consignment from the 106th Hazara Pioneers at I Dorahi on the frontier between Robat and Koh-i-Malik-Siah (Diwan Chah). He promptly broke open 12 packing cases to arm 120 of his men with the contents. The weapons, I hear, are Lee-Enfields and the Persians are delighted with them Sahib Jam’s party reached Neh on the 3rd July without mishap. The Governor, Shaukat-ul-Mulk, now wants his first requisition for 1,000 rifles and two maxim guns completed. Xhe situation at Dehaneh Bagheh. —Mr. Gabler is still apprehensive about the safety of his staff. It appears that Sahib Jam actually did arrest two Naruis from Sarhad on the Palang Kuh road. No doubt, also, his presence at Neh from about the 1st June with some 500 Kami warriors has deterred Sarhaddis from visiting Sistan. The day of reckoning is approaching for the raiders, and it certainly behoves the Kerman authorities to consider whether the seventh sub-section of the Telegraph Department can continue to work safely without some form of protection. The Parliamentary Elections. —The two most prominent candidates for the representation of Birjand are Mirza Ismail Khan, our Finance Agent, and Agha Shaikh Ahmed, Mudir of the Governor’s school, who all last year was in Tehran acting as His Excellency’s Vakil. Both these gentlemen are Anglo-phile. The election papers are to be distribut ed on the 5th July. In Sistan the best-known candidates are Yamin-i-Nizam, Nasir-us-Saltaneh and Ehtisham-i-Humayun. These may all be regarded as Anglo-phobe. The first- named recently lost his wife’s law-suit against Shaukat-ul-Mulk by submitting it to the arbitration of Mr. Churchill of His Majesty’s Legation, and in consequence he is said to have been divorced by his wife. The other two, who were r3spectively Sarhaddar and Karguzar in Sistan up to the spring of 1913, were most un favourably reported on by this Consulate, and inconsequence had their careers cut short. The first two are regarded as Hashmat-ites. The third is father-in-law of Sartip Muhammad Reza Khan, Deputy Governor of Sistan. Shaukat-ul-Mulk has, late in the day, instructed Afkham-ul-Sultan, his chief clerk in Sistan, to submit to the voters of Sistan the names of several Tehran notables such as Muaddil-ud-Dauleh, Sharif-ud-Dauleh. Adib-us-Saltaneh, Agha Saiyid Zia- ud-Din, Muazid-us-Sultan, Sardar Muhammad Najab Khwasani and Doctor Wali- ullah Khan. \ c , IS AUG 1914 &amp;&gt;- v \ r / \ ,j' r India, Foreigh Secretary^ No 3J 1.1, dated SO JUL 1914 l jj7-14.—28.—B.

D.-So-' Russian A //mVs.—Monsieur Eomanovski, my prospective colleague, has given us a* sample of his 'penchant for intrigue, in writing to Colonel Vygornitzky to sup port the claim of a Pathan British subject named Sardar Khan against Shaukat-ul- Mulk. The man in question is a rascal who was apprehended some years ago smuggling nine Mauser pistols, sewn up in a camel palan, through Birjand. His case which had been originally investigated by Mr. Howson after the man’s release from custody, was fully enquired into by me last year, and as an act of grace the Gov ernor then compensated him for the confiscation of his camel with a money pay ment. The arms he would not give back, as his orders on the subject from Tehran were definite. This year the complainant, fearing that the letter of recom mendation he has acquired, no doubt under false representations, from the British Consulate-General would not avail him much, has appealed also to the Russian Consulate-General and met with a ready response. As regards Colonel Vygornitzky it was enough for me to show the man’s British Registration Certificate, granted in Meshed last April. 9 Mir Yaqub Khan, Sanjerani. —See Diary No. 25 under the heading “ The Out law Naushirwan”.

It is rumoured that the Governor of Herat is executing men every Friday. (3) Relations are very strained between the Governor of Chakhansur and the Kazi whom the B rigadier is protecting. The Kazi has reported to Farah that the Governor has misappropriated the re venues. The Governor has bribed Kadkhuda Khwaja to get the Kazi killed. The Arms Traffic—Y orty Afghans recently returned from Yezd to Chakhansur with 300 rifles, which they stated they had passed through the Customs (? Finance Office) there. Seventy Afghans have since set out on the same quest. Rifles are said to be cheap in Yezd and Shiraz. Sistan Hospital figures for June 1914, New cases • • «• k. Old cases ... Operations F. B.

Persian Officials. Mirza Khalil Khan appears to have left Meshed secretly for Tehran on June 12th. M. Collard, to save him from arrest by the Governor-General, concealed as long as possible the fact that he had received orders from Tehran for his dis missal and only let this be known when Mirza Khalil Khan was well on his way to Tehran. He had passed Sabzawar before he could be arrested by the local officials of Khorasan, but the Karguzar has telegraphed to Prince Amir-i-A J zam, Governor of Shahrud, asking him to arrest the man and send him back to Meshed, M. Collard has informed me that Mirza Khalil Khan has been permitted to go to Tehran in order to exonerate himself. The object, of course, was to remove him beyond the reach of evidence. I regret to say that I have been obliged to change I my opinion of M. Collard. I formerly believed that he was at the mercy of his subordinates, who alone were responsible for all the villainy that went on in the Finance Department, but M. Collard's behaviour throughout this and other cases has convinced me that he is more knave than fool. I have heard that Prince Amir-i-A’zam has arrested Mirza Khalil Khan and sent him back to Meshed. ’Imad-ul-Mamalik has been appointed Governor of Gunabad, and the ap pointment appears to have given satisfaction to the people. M. Nicolsky has definitely informed A'dal-ud-Daula that it is impossible to make Kuchan a separate province, independent of Khorasan. I hear that Khabir-ud-Daulah, late Director of Telegraphs at Meshed, is working for his reinstatement. He is a worthy old soul but blind and past work. The Karguzar is again becoming slack in the performance of his duties. Secret. —I hear that the Persian Foreign Minister made particular enquiries of the Karguzar regarding the object of my recent toyr, and was informed that it had no special object, but that British officials were addicted to travelling. Persian Affairs. The Governor-General has received orders from Tehran to push on the business of the elections, and has replied that he is doing all that he can, but that he received his instructions so late that he doubts whether the Deputies from Khorasan can be in Tehran in time for the Coronation. He has had some difficulties to contend with. Supervisors of the election continue to show a disposition to resign, and there is a class in the city which is attempting to invalidate the election by recording absurd votes. Most of the Archangels and the Mahdi have received votes and a less respectable, but more material candidate, is the small-headed Saiyid, the most prominent of the local idiots. In Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam the Timuris have assaulted the supervisors and taken the voting papers from them. The papers, 1,200 in number, were taken to their Chief, Shaukat-ud-Daula, who filled them in and returned them to the Supervisors. At present Haji Saiyid Asadullah heads the list and Shaikh Muhammad Jawad, a glazier and democrat, is second. The official candidates are not placed. Abdul Hamid Khan, formerly dragoman of the Russian Consulate-General, having received from M. Mornard a lease of the Khalisa lands of Daragaz, is said to have left Meshed for Daragaz on June 15th. This lease was granted by M. Mornard without the sanction of the Persian Government, and Abdul Hamid has been supplied with 20 Gendarmes by M. Collard. I doubt whether this small force will be sufficient to oust Mirza Mas’ud Khan, the present holder of the lands, who can bring larger numbers into the field. M. Collard apparently agrees with me, for he has complained to M. Mornard that the Governor-General will not furnish a reinforcement, though he denied, when addressed on the subject by Captain Thorburn, that the Gendarmes had been placed at Abdul Hamid's disposal. - : .

Political Summary. r Condition of Country.-The province is somewhat disturbed owing to the exac tions of the Finance Department, and I hear that Shuja-ul-Mulk, Governor of Bakharz the Chief of Bujnurd and others are preparing to resist these exactions and to appeal to Tehran with a view to being permitted to collect the revenue themselves. They say that they have no objection to the appointment of an Ins pector whose duty it should be to see that the proper amount of revenue is collect ed and that there is no embezzlement. In Daragaz Mas ud Khan has killed two of the revenue Gendarmes sent with Abdul Hamid and has imprisoned Abdul Hamid himself. Condition of Roads.—I have no reports of robberies on the roads. T. W.

Baluch Raids.—{1) His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk has ordered the Deputy Governor, Sistan, to arrest and send up to Birjand about 60 individuals, who have participated in the raids. Sartip Muhammad Reza Khan has imprisoned a few already, but will probably find himself powerless to capture the greater number who are befriended by one or other of the Sistan Sardars. (2) The Governor has also directed the Karguzar, in his capacity of Sarhaddar to proceed to Chakhansur and negotiate for the arrest of Aibu, Aiwan, Faulad and other fugitives, as also for the punishment of the Gurgich followers of tffi’ Umar Shah and Said Khan. me Arms from India for the Persian Troops—See Diary No. 24. Sahib Jam and the Persian Escort only reached Robat bn the 24th instant. The escort from Kacha had arrived there on the 17th, and the Officer in Command returned to Kacha on the 23rd, presumably leaving the arms and a guard there. The transfer of the consign ment was probably made on the 26th. The situation at Dehaneh Bagheh.—The Telegraph Inspector, 7th Sub-Section has reported through His Majesty’s Consul at Kerman that the Sarhad Baluchis have heard that they will not be allowed to purchase provisions from Sistan this year, and consequently he fears that they may attempt to avenge themselves on the line and the Telegraph personnel. Mr. Gabler has been informed in reply that the Governor has issued no orders of the description indicated, and that he intends to take no hostile measures against the Sarhaddis this year. He wishes to study the situation in Sistan itself before taking any action. The Gurgich Kaud-village ease.—The Deputy Governor, Sistan, has informed His Hajesty’s Vice-Consul that two Gurgich gendarmes, naibs of the Finance Depart ment, who had accompanied M. Paquet to Tehran, have returned bringing a firman for the settlement of their tribe in three villages, Mxlik Haidari, Zahidan, and Kaud. This result seems to signify an extraordinary volte-face on the part of the Finance Department, as it was M. Paquet who effected the expulsion of the tribe. The explanation no doubt lies in the Belgian’s venality. The Persians of Sistan are firmly convinced that M. Paquet is still able to interfere in their affairs very largely from his seat in the central Treasury Office in Tehran. The Deputy Governor, Sistan, anticipates that the resettlement of the Gurgiches in Persian Sistan will give rise to a number of blood-feuds. The Governor, Shaukat-ul-Mulk, however, is desirous of receiving them back in recogni tion of the services which former headmen of the tribe rendered to his ancestors. He hopes to be able to dissipate the ill-feeling by a series of inter-marriages. Sardar Purdil Khan. —The Finance Agetot in Sistan, Ebtihaj-us-Sultan, has just received from Tehran the order of the Lion and the Sun’ 3rd class, for presentation to this Sardar “ in recognition of his excellent work as ‘Mir-ab’ and repairer of the Great Dam ! ” The honour has been conferred at the instance of M. Paquet. In this connection a persual of my notes in Diaries No. 24 of June 1913 and No. 42 of September 1913 will be found instructive. It seems somewhat remarkable that rewards of this description are not convey ed through the head of the Local Government. 14AUG19uA ■u jji! |Affairs —Thirteen Cossacks arrived from Meshed on the 18th in relief thfcoTsulSards at Sistan and Birjand. It is understood that four or five men have remained behind at 'Turbat-i-Haidari to accompany the new Vice- Consul down. r i I am informed that M. Romanovski, the younger, from Meshed, will probably reach Bhjand on about the 28th July to assume charge of the Sistan Vice-Consulat e Colonel Vvgornitzki will return to Russia as soon as he has handed over charge. The appointment of another Military Attache will probably be announced soon. Dr. Morozoff will be recalled from Sistan in a few weeks’ time Colonel Vygor- nitzki having reported unfavourably on him. He will be succeeded by anot er Medical officer. Abnormal weather in Birjand and Sistan.-X great heat wave visited Birjand •on about the 15th June, the temperature m the shade during the next five or six days rising always to 108°. On the 21st June and two following days we had showers of rain, and on the 24th the river which passes through the town came down in tre- mendous flood. It was impassable for 12 hours, and did considerable damage at Mud as well as at Birjand. In Sistan there was a deluge of 11 cents with much thunder and lighting on the afternoon of 24th June. F. B. PRIDEAUX, Major, His Britannic Majesty s Consul for Sistan and KainCONFIDENTIAL. Meshed Diary No. 24 for the week ending the 13th June (received on the 11th July) 1914. Persian Affairs. The Medians .—The excitement has increased considerably this week and there are no end of intrigues on foot. As it seemed unlikely that those candidates approved by the Governor-General would be elected, the time for distributing the voting papers was increased by three days and now much discontent is being expressed at the way in which the villagers, who have been sent by their masters by force and threats, are being given voting papers while only a small number are being distributed to the shop keepers, etc., in the city. One of the scrutinizers has resigned and the Governor-General visited the place to hear complaints but no villagers came while he was there. The Agha Zada, a noted intriguer who was bound over by Prince Dabija, has again become active and is intriguing vigorously. Many complaints have been received about his doings, so the Governor-General has warned him to be careful. Agha Saiyid Jawad and Saiyid Ali, Sistani, are attempting to work up feeling to get Royalist candidates elected in the hope that they will work for the return of Ex-Shah. The head of the Governor-General’s Cabinet has been dismissed, nominally because he is Bahai but really because of a reprimand the Governor- General received from Tehran at the way the papers were being distributed. The Governor-General has intimated that he will not allow unsuitable men, even if elected, to proceed to Tehran. (2) Twrhat-i-Haidari Riot Case. —M. Collard told me that after wiring three times to Tehran he received orders yesterday from M. Mornard to dismiss Mirza Khalil Khan. (3) The Governor-General has been ordered from Tehran not to send any representatives from Khorasan to the Coronation on account of the expense. (4) Haji Shaikh-ur-Rais has left Meshed. It is said that he is expelled from Persia by orders from Tehran. Before his departure he again tried to drag this Consulate into his dispute with the Governor-General. (5) Abdul Hamid, late dragoman of the Russian Consulate, has returned to Meshed. He asked for an interview with M. Nicolsky but was refused as the latter was too busy. It is confirmed that he has leased the Government lands at Daragaz for five years at Tomans 20,000 the first year and an increase of Tomans 5,000 for each of the following years. His partners in this deal are his uncle Mustasharul- Sultan, who is the head clerk in the Regent’s Office, and the Rais-i-Kushun, Meshed. It is most unfortunate that Abdul Hamid should have been allowed to lease this land as he will work for the Russians in this district. He leaves for Daragaz on Monday 15th. Twenty Gendarmerie sowars are also going on that day as there may be some trouble with partisans of Masud Khan, the former Governor. (6) Timuris .—This week several reports have been received of trouble brewing between the Timuris and Berberis. It appears that the Timuris have become excited over the two following cases :— (1) They accuse the Berberis of having taken by force Killah Dum-i-Robah and of having squeezed Tomans 800 out of them. (2) While another case was under arbitration the Berberis stole some horses belonging to the head of the Timuris,2 An affair is reported to have taken place at Darakht-i-Bid in which the Timuris got the worst of it. The Governor-General has told the Nusrat-ul-Mulk to prevent any further disturbance but, as he is only a boy of 16 and at present under the influence of Shaikh Hassan Kashi, it seems doubtful that his influence will be sufficient to stop Ms tribesmen if the Governor-General does not settle this inter-tribal dispute iustlv At present the Timuris are buying arms and ammunition and the Ilbegi at Zurabad is collecting men. - Nusrat-ul-Mulk has stated that Shaukat-ud-Daula, the head of the other section of the. Timuris, and the. Baluch have promised to List them against the Berberis. In a later report it is stated that the Timuris were dispersed by the orders of Nusrat-ul-Mulk, but 100 armed Berberis were seen going to P Darakht-i-Bed. Shaikh Hassan Kashi is trying to get Nusrut-ul-Mulk under the influence of the Russians. Russian Affairs. (1) M. Romanovsky’s elder brother is expected to arrive in Meshed in the next week or two to become assistant to M. Nicolsky. (2) Reference entry in last week’s diary. Mir Aziz is said to be going to start a shop for wool, etc., at Galar near Zorabad and will act as the Russian Agent to watch that part of the Frontier. (3) It is reported that th'e Russian Governor of the Caspian Coast has claimed 15 versts of Persian land to the north of Bujnurd, and that he will send troops and cultivators there in about a month. (4) Amir Khan, the Russian subject, who murdered Murad Khan, the dresser at the British Consulate Hospital, and who was tried, found guilty, and banished from Persia by Prince Dabija, is at present at Kakah and is again trying to get back to Meshed. I have told M. Nicolsky that I hope he will not be^ allowed to return, and he has promised to do what he can. (5) A Russian paper has printed a graphic description of the murder of a Caucasus Turk in Meshed. It accuses the Kardash Bala, the well-known ruffian who was Prince Dabija’s right hand man. M. Nicolsky has taken an Iltizam from him, if the charge is proved he will forfeit all his property. British Affairs. Lieutenant-Colonel Haig is expecte'd to return from tour to-day. Travellers. Colonel Scourat has returned to Meshed. He made a short tour to Khaf via Turbat-i-Haidari. M. Romanovski is going to Kuchan for a week. He will probably meet hia; brother there. Herat News. The Naib-i-Hukuma has ordered that the boundary pillars are to be repaired as soon as possible and the party is being collected. He has sent orders to the Governor of Gulran to collect provisions for the transport of the party and to col lect bricks, etc., for building the pillars. Khaf News. The Governor of Khaf is levying blackmail from the inhabitants. He gave the Governor-General a PeshJcash on his appointment and is now recovering' it* State of the Province. There is a slight under-current of unrest throughout the province this Week; The friction between the Timuris and the Berberis may develop or they may unite against the Revenue Department. There also seems to be a general movement of the Russians to acquire lands and influence along the north of this province, at Zurabad, at Daragaz and to the north of Bujnuid.There was a severe hail storm at Daragaz which caused great damage to the crops and one small girl was killed. The hailstones were said to be the size of walnuts. State of the Roads, The Turkoman robbers are again out, they attacked a caravan at Jahanabad and carried away over 300 tomans, a mule and a rifle. The telegraph line was cut on the 11th, This is supposed to have been the work of the Turkomans who were fighting with the road guards to the west of Abbasabadj Note, —Colonel Haig has just returned, H.

Afghan apprehensions with regard to Russian raihvay and road construc tion—Vm activity, which is being displayed by Russia, in connection with {a) the construction of the Oxus Railway (reference paragraphs 371, 362 355, 336), (5) the annual repair, being carried out on the Samarkand-Termez post- road, at the Takhta Karacha pass, on the Russo-Bokharan border at 31 miles from Samarkand, and (c) the collection of construction-material for a branch line at Tash Kepri on the Merv-Kushk Section of the Central Asian Railway freference paragraph 355 (6)], L is probably responsible for a report, from Bokhara, that the Amir of Afgha nistan is pressing the Amir of Bokhara to obstruct and, if possible, prevent the construction of the Oxus Railway beyond Karshi, and for a report from Herat, dated May 28th, to the effect that Russia is constructing three lines of advance towards Afghanistan and against the salient Mazar-i-Sharif, Andkhui, Maimana (d) from Askhabad (Central Asian Railway is probably intended) to ‘ Andkhui; 18,000 camels are being collected at Bokhara, Charjui and Diwana Bagh; (h) from Samarkand to Mazar-i-Sharif, via Patta Kesar; Bokharan coolies , . are working on the road; , (c) from Tash Kepri to Maimana, via Chashma Gaogirdah. &gt; 373. Reported import of arms hy Persian Government. —The Persian Gov ernment has been permitted to import, free of duty, into Persia, via Baku, 11,000 Mauser rifles and 300,000 rounds of ammunition. (Askhabad, May 31st.) 374. Russian settlers in Northern Persia. —Since March 18th, 1914, two am bulances of the Russian Red Cross Society have been working in Northern Persia, with headquarters at Gumbad-i-Kabus and at Astarabad. The staff of each con sists of one medical officer in charge, one surgeon-oculist, one junior medical officer, two medical students (completing medical course), 1 lady doctor, and three dressers. The significance of their activity consists in two facts, both of political importance : (a) The prevalence of malaria is the principle, if not the only, hindrance to the colonization of the district by Russian emigrants, who, it must be remembered, have, for the greater part, served in the ranks of the Russian army. The energetic introduction of modern scien tific methods of dealing with malaria will undoubtedly mitigate and possibly remove this hindrance. (6) During the six weeks following the opening of these hospitals in Northern « Persia, 1,000 Russians and 3,000 natives (mostly Persians) are re ported, by the medical officers in charge, to have received treatment. ■ These figures testify to the popularity of the methods adopted and point to the growth of Russian political influence in the neigh bourhood, as a natural consequence. His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Resht has been granted permission to travel via Russian Turkistan to Astarabad (Turkistan Gazette, June 3rd.) Administration. 375.

These measures, w hich are the result of the deliberations of a committee, appointed by the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, and which were to have been laid before the General Council in the first week in June, are expected to come into force with effect from July 14th, 1914. 4 - ’ ■ ' ' - y 377 Trans-Caspia* —The office of the Governor of Trans-Caspia was moved on June* 6th, from Askhabad to the hill-station of Firiuza, for the hot weather. 378. Turkomans. —Seven surveying-engineers arrived at Askhabad, May 22nd from Tashkent. They are said to be employed in connection with a Gov ernment plan for appropriating to the State all land now occupied by Turkomans, except only so much as is considered sufficient for the support of the present occupant and his family. , ^ Communications. 379. Oxus Railway : rolling stock—The Oxus Railway Company has acquired 4 000 goods wagons, of the normal type, for the requirements of the working of the line. These wagons have been included, from May, 1914, in the General Register of Wagons, maintained for the Russian Railway system. {Askhabad, June 4th.) 380. Oxus Railway: oficial movements. —M. Korolkof, Deputy District Engineer, Turkistan Military District, has been ordered to Bokhara, to carry out geological surveys, in connection with tunnelling operations on the Oxus Railway. M. Kovalevski, Managing Director of the Oxus Railway Company, arrived in Tashkent, May 29th, from Bokhara, the headquarters of the Company. He returned to Bokhara on the same day. , It is reported that M. Kovalevski, or another Engineer holding an important position on the staff of the Oxus Railway Company, has left Askhabad for Meshed, where he is expected to arrive on June 1 15th, returning to Trans-Caspia via Dushak. It is said that the object of his visit is to investigate the question of procuring labour in Persia and to report on the possibility of railway construction from Askhabad to Meshed and from Meshed to Dushak. It will be remembere4 that two Russian Engineers arrived in Meshed from Chehcheh in July 1913, having roughly surveyed the line from Tejend to Meshed via Chehcheh, and that they were sent by M. Kovalevski (reference diary for 1913, paragraph 442). 381. Oxus Railway: construction. —The report above recorded, to the effect that the Russian Engineers are endeavouring to recruit labour in Persia, further states that the Russian Consul-General in Meshed has received telegraphic instructions (June 6th) to assist one M. Frank, a Russian Jew, engaged in trade in Khorasan, to collect 15,000 coolies, if possible Berberis, for work on the Oxus Railway. The wages offered are about Is. Id. per man per day, and are similar to those being paid to Bokharan workmen, already engaged [reference paragraph 362 (c)], plus travelling expenses to Bokhara. Reports, dated May 28th and 30th, from Askhabad, Merv and Kagan, state that construction is proceeding at Karshi and at various points on the line between Kagan and Karki, but that no work is being done at the Kagan terminus. Seven wagon-loads (about 210 per wagon) of sleepers, and three wagon-loads of iron sleepers, passed through Merv, by rail, from the west towards Kagan, between May 19th and May 27th. 382. Movements of Sappers: Central Asian Railway, Merv-Kushk branch .— Four companies, 2nd Turkistan Sapper Battalion, left Merv by rail, in the direction of Kushk, May 21st. These troops, which usually proceed every year to Tashkent, for training in summer camp, are, possibly, being employed on the construction referred to in paragraph 355 (6) of a light railway Jrom Tash Kepri to Takhta Bazar.

Balmh Wrth reference to item (6) m last week’s diary, I learn that it was Juma Jelal who looted the Maldars ” of the grazing country west of Sistan. The latter have appealed to Sardar Jehil, Ismailzai, to procure them satisfaction In this connection it is rather significant that Shaukat-uI-MuIk has iust received a telegraphic report from his Deputy at Sistan to the effect that Sardar Jehil is meditating an attack on Kamat. As the Deputy Governor, Sartip Muhammad Reza Khan, is now on the best of terms with Sardars Purdil Khan and Khudadad Khan, it appears that the friends of the raiders are again trying to prejudice the Governor of Sistan and Kainat against Sardar Jehil. (b) Alam Khan, the cousin of Junia Jelal, and uncle of two other young raiders has brought his tents to Daulatabad, the residence of Sardar Purdil Khan. (c) Shah Nazar, another Sistan Baluch raider (see Diary No. 4 ), has sent his family to Lutak and placed them under the protection of Ali Khan, son of Sardar Purdil Khan. This outlaw, in the time of Major Benn, was one of our Consulate post carriers ! (d) The Deputy Governor, Sistan, recently received information, which he could not ignore, to the effect that five Afghan Gurgiches, who had robbed a party of pilgrims near Neh about two months ago (? members of the band mentioned in Diary No. 15), were staying at Khwaja Ahmed. He sent a few Cavalry Sowars out who arrested two of the party, but Sardar Khudadad Khan forthwith got them released by sending 30 of his men to overawe the Sowars. (e) With reference to Diary No ; 22, item (c), I hear that the outlaws named (apparently Aibu and Habib Iduzai are the same person) were warned to take refuge in Afghanistan by Kadkhuda Asadullah, Sarbandi, the present headman of Kaud, and a relative of Sardar Purdil Khan ! The outlaw Naushirwan. —Arrangements are being made, at the request of the Political Agent, Kalat, to send Naushirwan’s two boy-cousins, Bai Khan and Habib Khan, back to India. The Afghan dacoits, Kabir Khan and his gang, who broke out of the Kandahar Jail with Naushirwan and have lived at Khwaja Ahmed ever since, have been pardoned by His Majesty the Amir and have proceeded to Chakansur. Mir Yakub Khan, Sanjarani, the ex-Chagai Levy Corps Officer, has gone with them in the hope of getting permission to settle down in Afghanistan. Affairs of the Local Government. —His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk has ordered three of Hashmat-ul-Mulk’s agents in Sistan, Muhammad Ali Khan, Ghulam Husain Khan and Mirza Haider, to come up to Birjand, as he has heard that they are intrigu ing against him. Two of these men, with whom, so far as I know, the Consulate has never had any dealings, at once applied to Captain Heron, His Majesty’s Vice- Consul, for assistance, on the ground that their going would materially prejudice their master’s interests. The Governor has since consented to their remaining another month, by which time all the harvest work should be completed. His Excellency also informs me that he has reliable information that Sardar Khudadad Khan is seriously preparing for rebellion. The Gurgich Kaud village case. — See Diaries Nos. 32 and 51 of 1913.

On account of religious scruples, he has been told that no official notification of the order is being published.

(6) The Director has written me a long letter regarding his Gunabadi Sowars, who have suddenly deserted the service and left for their homes without paying their debts. Mirza Ismail Khan mentions that the men were mostly notor ious bandits and followers of Muhammad Ali of Gunabad who came to a bad end. He thinks that the change of Governors in Gunabad has led the men to hope that they will be able to resort again to their old profession under their Chief Kerbalai Ismail. It is most satisfactory to get tlds unprejudiced corroboration of Howson's description of the men, repeated by Captain Hunter in Diary to. 47 of 1912, “ some * * * used to be robbers ”, F. B.

The f f^-The total number of voting papers distributed in Meshed to date is only 3 650. There is a good deal of party feeling, especially as voting papers were refused to people who are Royalists and Bahais. Vigorous protests hfvf been made, and the Governor-General has summoned those responsible for this and sent an influential deputation to apologise for the occurrence. The villagers’are abso- lutely ignorant ot what it is all about. m i 2 f T ^ hat ' l - Hai ^ ari CW—All the papers have now been received from Turbat-i-Haidan and Ah Akbar, Mirza Khalil Khan’s private servant who started the shooting, has secretly been sent for to come to Meshed. M. Collard has refused to allow Mirza Khalil Khan to appear for trial without permission from Tehran Mirza Khalil Khan is trying his best to avoid the enquiry and has petitioned the Russian Consulate-General but has been told to await the arrival of the Russian Consul from Turbat, who is expected shortly. Russian 3. Meshed-Kuchan-Ashakabad Road.—As the Rais-ut-Tujjar has done nothing for the upkeep of the road to Ashakabad the Persian Government are evident^ ly going to take it into their own hands. Orders have been received by M. Collard from Tehran to arrange for its repair, and M. Cocramont, the Belgian Architect who went last week to Kuchan, is put in charge of the work. (See last week’s diary.) 4. The Naib-i-Hukuma of Bala Khaf has been severely wounded by a gang of ruffians under Mir Ali Jan Sultan, who is the head of the Timuris at Khaf and was some time ago bound over to keep the peace. 5. Abdul Hamid, late dragoman of the Russian Consulate-General, has wired to say that he has obtained the contract for the Government lands at Daragaz which Masud Khan formerly had. He has been sending so many telegrams about obtaining concessions of Shrine lands, etc., that even his partners are sceptical about this latest report. Russian Affairs. With reference to entry in Meshed diary for week ending 25th April: it appears that, as Mir Aziz is a Russian subject, the lands near Zurabad were leased in the name of his wife, a Persian woman, and that Prince Dabija attested the document. This case is further complicated by the original lease having divided it into shares and the matter has been referred to the Adaliya but is not yet settled. It is reported that M. Nicolsky has given Mir Aziz a Russian flag to hoist over the lands. Travellers. (1) Colonel Scourat has gone to Turbat-i-Haidari. (2) M. Collard has returned from Kuchan. (3) Dr. Pugin left Meshed for Tehran. (4) The Russian Consul at Turbat-i-Haidari has arrived at Karez and is expected shortly to come to Meshed. (5) A Russian Officer called Grikoff arrived at Turbat-i-Haidari from Sabza- war via Dumabend and left for Kerman or Birjand. Gill 1S12 Miscellaneous. It is reported that a box of “ German dye ” has been sent to Kabul pa Herat. This is undoubtedly Dr. Pugin’s work, who represents a firm trading in indigo and alizarine dyes. Karez News. The Russian Consul from Turbat-i-Haidari arrived at Karez. He was assured by the Revenue Official that there was no chance of disturbances there as they were “ very strong in that district ”. The Russian Commandant left for Pul-i-Khatmi with 21 Cossacks who have been relieved. Herat News. The Herat Agent reports the following :— (D Risaladar Yar Muhammad Khan has asked permission from the Naib- i-Hukuma at Herat to be allowed to go into Russian territory to settle frontier cases. (2) A Russian Officer, said to be Captain Daikas, came with a letter from the Governor of Shaikh Junaid to Risaladar Yar Muhammad Khan at Chihil Dukhtaran and said he had been sent to arrange with him about the boundary pillars from Kara Tapa to Jangurak. Risaladar Yar Muhammad Khan told him as it was harvest time it was difficult to do the work at present. (See entry in Meshed diary for week end ing 9th May.) Captain Daikas said he was going to London after two or three months. (3) An Afghan spy has returned from Russia and reports that 18,000 camels are being collected in Bukhara, Charjui, and Diwana Bagh to be used in transporting material for new Railway lines that are going to be constructed along the Afghan Frontier. (4) Twenty-four rifles and six revolvers have been smuggled into Herat by I a Barakzai from Meshed. The man was arrested but released and sent back to Persia. Political Summary. State of Province. —Complaints are being received almost every day against the Revenue Gendarmes. The villages of Kalata Mulla Muhammad are threatening to leave Persia on account of the treatment they are receiving from the Revenue Department and (secret) news has been received that the chief of the Hazaras, Timuris, Baluch, Kurds of Bujnurd are considering a combined movement to resist the high-handedness of the Revenue Department. State of the Poads. No news of roberries has been received this week. The Governor-General. Nayyir-ud-Daula continues on the best of terms with this Consulate-General, and but for his influence there would undoubtedly have been some disturbances over the election. H.

Constantine Ivanof, Russian Consul at Astarabad, is reported to have made the following statements, which bear on the situation in Northern Persia: (1) Nothing is definitely laid down, in the Turkmenchaisk Treaty or in the Shariat, as to the right of foreigners to acquire real estate in Persia. Article 5 of the Treaty allows the right to Russian sub jects for the purpose of dwelling-houses, depots, warehouses, etc., and the Shariat declares that every man, who cultivates land which has no owner, becomes ipso facto the landlord, no sort of reservation being made or implied to the exclusion of foreigners or Christians. (2) Purchase-deeds are unknown in Persia. Title-deeds consist of Royal finnans, ecclesiastical certificates, and of cash-receipts, witnessed by the Persian ecclesiastical authorities. There are always several claimants to the ownership of land, each of whom possesses some document which purports to be the title-deeds of the property. Consequently, no transaction in land in Persia has ever been com pleted by a Russian subject without some dispute in deciding such cases. M. Ivanof has followed the universally recognized law of limitation and has given preference to the claimant who has last been in possession of the property for not less than ten years. (3) The tract between the Gurgen and the Kara-su is a case in point. The Turkomans claim that no Persians have lived in the district for the last three hundred years and that the Russian settlers, to whom Persians have sold land in the district, principally for the purpose of interposing a Russian barrier between themselves and the Turkomans, have, according to the law of limitation, no right to the land on which they are living. It is reported from Astarabad that M. Ivanof is shortly to be transferred. (d) A Russian officer, of the rank of Colonel, disembarked at Bandar-i-Gaz on May 7th, and, with two other officials and escorted by Turkoman sowars, pro ceeded to register the settlements of the Russian immigrants, irom the coast of the Caspian as far as Astarabad. He is said to have issued an order that the proportion of Russian to other settlers shall be that of three to one. This officer returned to Bandar-i-Gaz on May 18th, from Astarabad 364. Political affairs in Astarabad. —It is reported that Salar-i-Ashja, a lead ing Persian at Astarabad, has been found dead at Sarkaleh, a small village near the city. On about May 7th the deceased received a visit from one Abdul Kasim Khan, who is said to have been the bearer of letters from the ex-Shah to several other leading men of the neighbourhood. On May 10th Salar-i-Ashja is said to have been seen in company with the Russian officer, who has been registering the Russian settlements in Astarabad. Salar-i-Ashja is also said to have handed over to the Russian authorities the arms and ammunition, collected at various2 365.

Oxus railway .—A consignment of four small engines, for construction work, and of miscellaneous bridging material (pontoons, girders, etc.), arrived at Charjui, May 4th and 5th, and was despatched, in barges, up the Amu Darya, on May 18th and 20th. Sufficient material for a pontoon bridge was collected at Termez in 1912 (reference diary for 1912, paragraphs 172, 184, 198, 231, 271, 332, 352 357, 374, 410, an( l 445). Reports indicate that the material now being despatched is intended for the construction of a bridge at Kerki or at Kelif, or possibly at both points. A report from an observer, who visited Kagan for the express purpose, on May 20th, confirms the information, recorded in paragraph 355 (a), to the effect that the earthwork for the permanent way is completed for a distance of 6 miles from Kagan, in the direction of Termez, but states that no sleepers or rails have ;yet been laid. The branch line, mentioned by the Turkistan Gazette of May 20th. and referred to in paragraph 362, as being ready for traffic is probably the branch from Kagan to Bokhara. One company, 12th Turkistan Rifle Regiment, from Samarkand, is stationed at Kagan, probably to preserve order among the workmen, employed on con struction work. Military. Administration.

Baluch raids.—Further details which necessitate corrections to my previous notes have reached me regarding the two bands who have lately been operating against southern Kainat :— n &amp; (a) The small lashkar of Baluchis was from Khwabgah in Afghan Sistan and was composed of Gurgiches (kinsmen of Haji Gulab) of the Lashkarzai and Smgakzai sections. The band was led by Kadkhuda Umar Shah and Saiyid Khan, both of whom were killed in one or other of the two fights near Duzdak-Ab and Deh Salm by Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s Jambazes. The survivors of the band returned to Afghanistan but orders were promptly issued by the Chakansur authorities for their arrest and six raiders have since been captured by the Afghan Captain Sher Muhammad Khan. Haji Gulab, who seems person ally to have remained all the time with the families and flocks of the raiders near the Shela, has recently been appealing to the Deputy Governor, Sistan, for permission to settle down in Persian Sistan! (h) It was the big lashkar of Yar Ahmedzais, Kharotis, Rekis and Brahuis under Shah Sowar Khan, Yar Muhammad Khan, Khan Muhammad, Taj Muhammad and Juma Jalal, who attacked Aliabad and then retired to Sarhad on hearing of the defeat suffered by the Gurgiches. This fashkar seems to have looted all the Baluch “ Maldars ” (flock-owners) that it found at the watering places—Haidarabad, Kalegar, Turshab, Gorandab, Lera Dik and Baluch Ab; finally the Sarhaddi element broke into open quarrel with Juma Jalal, the Shela Brahui, and beat him severely with sticks. The principal “ Maldars ” who were victimized were Bullu Murrai (Naroi) Sahibdad Mirozai and Haibu Zirkari Brahui. Arms from India for the Persian troops. —The consignment of 700 rifles, etc., brought by the 106th Hazara Pioneers to Kacha in April 1914 for delivery to Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s new Army has not been taken over yet, owing to the feeling of insecurity created by the two Baluch lashkars. The Governor’s force now or recently assembled at Heh amounted by degrees to about 600 men including a large irregular contingent of Bahluris, and orders were telegraphed a few days ago to Sahib Jam, Shaukat’s trusty Body-Guard Com mander, to proceed to Robat along the Hamun and Shela, and to take over the armament without further delay. It is believed that Sahib Jam with about 400 men will reach Koh-i-Malik-Siah on the 18th instant. The Persian Parliament. —See Diary No. 21 for the week ending 23rd May 1914. I am informed by His Majesty’s Minister that the reason for the orders regarding the elections in this Province coming to Shaukat-ul-Mulk through the Governor- General of Meshed are that under the Electorate Law passed by the former Majlis Sistan and Kain are included within the Khorasan electoral District.

It states 'that the Kais-ut-lujjar is entirely wrong and instructs the Karguzar to see that the con tracts for the repair of the road is not given, directly or indirectly, to a foreign sub ject, and orders him to stop any such action and report the matter at once. ,, A ?

Nicolsky’s arrival. The latter refused to accept him and has wired to Kermanshah for the dragoman who served with him there. It is stated that Abdul Hamid is not returning as dragoman but in connec tion with the bribery case which M. Nicolsky is to investigate. It is reported that Russian Agent at Sabzawar has flogged two Persian sub jects without informing the Karguzar. The Russian Consul-General has written to his Agent at Kuchan to send a guide with a Russian Officer from Karabagh (Russia) who is going to Daragez and Kalat-i-Nadiri. . , Mother case of robbery by Russian Cossacks is reported to have taken place just outside the Arak gate. , F t 20^ t]9U -2 Travellers.

Their rifles were not returned but kept pending orders from A cVilrn fl Some Afghan sowars from Minkuan, Afghan post, entered Russian territory by mistake and were attacked by the Russian guard but escaped with the loss of a horse. Political Summary. The Revenue Department is again causing trouble. The Governor of Kuchan has complained to the Governor-General that the Maliyah there is interfering in civil cases. There have been several reports of robberies tliis week. The Zuskis under Ali Jauzi a noted robber, attacked the village of Aberdeh. Three of the villagers and two of the robbers were wounded. The robbers carried off 50 sheep and tomans 140 in cash. Trouble is likely to take place at Shirwan if the Governor-General does not interfere as the Rais-ut-Tujjar has taken possession of the produce of the lands near Shirwan. Condition of the Roads. Reference to entry in Meshed diary for week ending 25th April. The two Kakuris, companions of those murdered, have been arrested by the Naib-ul-Hukuma at Herat and their goods have been confiscated. The third Kakuxi, who was their guide, has returned to Turbat-i-Haidari. At Chah Kurdan near Abbassabad two carriages of pilgrims returning from Meshed were attacked and robbed by Turkomans. Two of the pilgrims were killed. • H. HAY THORBURN, Ca V tain, His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul, Meshed, G. M. Press, Simla.—No. C. 221 F. D.—1-7-14.—28.—E.

The Russian officers, tried by court-martial, at Tashkent, for selling government ordnance stores to natives, have been found guilty. Major-General D. A. Kulakof (retired) was sentenced to two years’ confinement in a fortress ; Captains Milovanof and Lunkevich were sentenced to four years’ penal servitude. Major-General Kulakof committed suicide on May 15th, before the pro nouncement of the verdict and sentence. 357. Russian view of German enterprise in Persia. —The “ Askhabad ” news paper of May 16th enumerates the points in Persia, at which German, commercial interests threaten to develop into “ capitular ” or political interests. Among these are Tabriz, the country along the line between Tabriz and Urumia, Urumia and the navigation of the lake, Ispahan, Hamadan, Kermanshah, and several towns in the Russian sphere of influence, at which, it is said, German consulates are to be established. The principal cause for apprehension is stated to be the fact that, by a Russo-German agreement, the right of constructing a railway from Teheran to Khanikin will pass from Russia to Germany, unless the former shall have commenced construction work by 1916. The newspaper states that pre liminary surveys are being planned, for a railway from Enzeli to Reshfc, and that the construction of a line between these points will probably be the first step in a scheme for connecting the Caspian ports with India via Teheran, with a branch from Teheran to Khanikin. Resources. 358. Irrigation. — In view of the frequent complaints, made in the past, of the small supply of water, allowed to flow from Afghanistan and Persia, into Russian Turkistan, the following information, published in the “ Askhabad ” news paper of May 16th, is of political interest: “ The rise of the water in the Tejend river is satisfactory and of good volume, but fears of inundation are without foundation. The flood is rising normally, owing to the gradual melting of the snows, and the hydro-technical experts state that the flow is steady and is not likely to cause damage. Military. 359. Official movements, Russian. —The Governor of Trans-Caspia visited Chikishliar, during the week ending May 23rd, travelling from Krasnovodsk in the military steamer “ Kreiser.” 360. Training.—The 2nd Orenburg Cossack Battery, stationed at Kerki, is reported to have arrived at Charjui by road, on May 8th, and to have left for Tash kent by rail, probably for training in summer camp. One hundred and fifty men and horses, 1st Caucasus Cossack Regiment, left Merv by rail, on May 9th, in the direction of Askhabad, probably for training in summer camp. Administration. 361.

Oxus raihvay. — The information, recorded in paragraph 355 (a), is con firmed by the “ Turkistan Gazette ” of May 20th, which states that the construc tion of the branch line at the station of Kagan is completed, and that trains will commence to run, when the special committee, nominated by the Chief of the j Central Asian railway, shall have ascertained that the line has been constructed in | accordance with the approved scheme.— —- — ■ According to the “ Turkistan Gazette ” of May 15th, the condition of con- struction work on the Oxus railway was as follows . (a) The detailed technical scheme had received the approval of the Minister ^ for Wavs of Communication and of the council of engineers, and had been submitted for approval to the Ministers of Finance and of Government Control. (b) Engineer Kovalevski, the principal promoter of the Company, together with Engineer Ostrovski, in charge of construction material, had proceeded, May 13th, to the scene of operations, m order to inspect the materials available locally, and to decide whether the water- supply from the Kash-Darya will be sufficient, or whether it will be necessary to provide a further supply from the Amu-Darya. M Kovalevski had, further, to settle details regarding the adapta tion of the palace, presented by the Amir of Bokhara, for use as a railway station at Kagan. (This item was expected to cost £3,000.) (c) Fifteen thousand Bokharan workmen had been engaged at a daily wage per man of Is. 7d.; these were to work under the superintendence of 1,000 Russian workmen, acting as foremen. The necessary number of tents were to be pitched for the accommodation of the working parties. (d) Motor-lorries for the conveyance of construction material, and motor cars for the use of the superintending engineers, had already been despatched. (e) Depots, for storing materials, had been formed at Karshi and at Sam- sonof station. (/) A tunnel was being driven, near Kilif. (a) M. Kikodze was named as the chief engineer, in charge of construction work. The “ Turkistan Gazette” of May 17th stated that seven Americans and six Italians have been granted permission to travel to Kagan, via Orenburg and Tashkent, and to live in the Bokhara khanate for one year, while engaged on construction work, on the Oxus railway.

Mirza Khalil Khan, lately Financial Agent at Turbat-i-Haidari, has not been dismissed, in spite of M. Mornard’s statement to that effect to His Majesty’s Minister. He is working in the Head-quarters office at Meshed. The Karguzar has tele graphed to Tehran urging his dismissal. ^ The Karguzar of Turbat-i-Haidari has been promoted to Maku in Azar- baijan. Salar-i-Humayun, the new Governor of Turbat-i-Haidari, has had a little trouble with the Russian Consul, owing to his not having taken any notice of the Cossacks sent out to meet him. Otherwise he appears to be doing well. The elections are causing more sensation than at first. Agha Saiyid Khalil, Mujahid, a ruffian who was attempting to terrify people into votingTor him, has been deported to Kalat-i-Nadiri, and Mirza Ibrahim, a reactionary Mujtahid, has been ordered to leave the town until the elections are over. There is a strong feeling in some quarters against the assembly of a new Majlis. Haji Saiyid Ali, Sistani, has pronounced the Constitution to be opposed to the sacred law of Islam, and a number of students, both Persian and Russian subjects, are threatening the over seers of elections, and are also threatening to create a disturbance when the people assemble to receive their voting papers. The Governor-General held a meeting of the leading men of the town yesterday, for the purpose of persuading them to do their duty as their voters, and to see that the elections are held without dis turbance. He has also sent voting papers to the Governor of Sistan and the Kainat. He has had some trouble in persuading men to serve as overseers, as some have resigned in consequence of the threatening letters which they have received. A new local newspaper, the Agahi, has appeared during the week. The leading candidates for election to the Majlis as representatives of Meshed are the Sardar-i-Mu’azzam, Commander of the Troops, Mu’azzaz-ud-Daula, the Karguzar, the local head of the Department of Endowments and Public Instruc tion, Mubassir-ul-Mulk, Provincial Postmaster-General, Mutamin-us-Sultana, the late Karguzar, and Imad-us-Sultana, his brother. Besides these there is a host of nonentities none of whom is likely to get in, but who may cause disturbances. I have exchanged official visits with M. Nicolsky, the new Russian Consul- General. He impressed upon me that he intended to look after all his official business himself, and I am informed from another source that he has warned M. Romanovski against usurping the functions of the Consul-General and deciding cases without reference to him. He informed me that Prince Dabija has left things in such a mess that he had been working up till 2 a.m. every day since his arrival to put them ‘Straight. He told Romanovski that he knows that the Russian Con sulate-General has a very bad name for corruption in Meshed, and that he intends to set it right. He himself has already refused presents. There are persistent rumours to the effect that Abdul Hamid Khan’s explana tion has been accepted in Tehran, and that he is returning to Meshed as^ dragoman, to the Russian Consulate-General. This will not simplify M. Nicolsky s task. Herat News. Risaladar Yar Muhammad Khan has asked the Russian Commandant at Kara m a. i i t /~v £ T» l-^ ■Fr.U/-.

Political Summary. Condition of Country.— The elections may lead to some disturbances in the town of Meshed, and it may be questioned whether the successful candidates ' ill be in any sense representatives of the people. Muhammad Kurshabadi and his gang are at large in the neighbourhood of Nishabur, and have been committing robberies and other outrages. The feeling against the Revenue Department is as strong as ever, and I receive continual complaints of the exactions and misconduct of the gendarmes. Condition of Roads.-See last week’s diary. It has been ascertained that nobodv was killed in the attack on the caravan near Shahan Darmab, but the caravan was robbed. The robbers were dressed like Turkomans. T. W.

Meshed Diary No. 20 for the weekending May 16th (received on I3th June) 1914. Persian Officials. See last week’s diary, Mirza Khalil Khan, lately financial agent at Turbat-i- Haidari, has arrived in Meshed. He is working in the Finance Offices and there appears to be no present intention of calling him to account. It would perhaps be useless to take action at present as he is attempting to transfer all blame to Mustafa Mirza, the ex-Governor, but when Mustafa Mirza arrives in Meshed I spall press for an investigation. Shuja-ul-Mulk, Governor of Bakharz, has recently arrived in Meshed and has persuaded the Governor-General to release his brother-in-law, Fath-ul-Mulk, from confinement. A’dal-ud-Daula, Governor of Kuchan, gained great credit by capturing the robber Nasir (see diary for the week ending March 21st last), whose head was carried through the streets of Kuchan and has since been sent to Meshed, where it has been buried, but it has since been ascertained that Nasir was killed by some of his confederates in the course of a quarrel over the division of spoil, and that A’dal-ud-Daula’s sowars found the body, severed the head from it, and brought it into Kuchan. Shuja’-us-Sultan, brother of Mustafa Mirza, has been appointed Governor of Sabzawar, and leaves Meshed to day. Shaukat-ul-Mulk, brother-in-law of the Commander of the Troops, has been appointed Governor of Turshiz. Persian Affairs. See last week’s diary. The highly respected Haji Shaikh-ur-Rais is in trouble. He and Abdur Rahman Mudarris sent a petition against Nayyir-ud-Daulah to Tehran and the petition was sent back to Nayyir-ud-Daulah, who has ordered both Shaikh-ur-Rais and Abdur Rahman to leave Meshed. Shaikh- ur-Rais made an unsuccessful attempt to drag me into the dispute. He also intrigued in the Russian Consulate-General against the Shrine officials, with the result that he has been turned out of the Shrine as a Bahai. The Governor- General has now forbidden him to visit the Shrine. Some Nazirs or overseers have been appointed for the supervision of the elections, but the list is not complete and voting papers have not yet been distributed. The landowners and respectable merchants are said to be inclined to stand aloof from the elections owing to their grievances against the Revenue Department, but it is not easy to see how this aloofness will benefit them. The number of candidates, said to be about 500, must be nearly as great as the the number of electors. Men of no consequence are pushing themselves forward in the hope of making membership of the Majlis a stepping stone to something more lucrative, but the more respectable classes ridicule the elections altogether and say that elections are a farce in the country in which nine-tenths of the people are not quite sure whether the constitution is something to eat or something to wear. Haji Saiyid Ali, Sistani, a reactionary who was with Yusuf Herati in the Shrine at the time of the bombardment, has been ordered to leave Meshed until the elections are over. The feeling against the Revenue Department is very strong and telegrams and petitions against the levy of new taxes have been sent to Tehran.2 Russian Affairs. Prince Dabija has ordered the removal of f an inscribed stone from the Golden Porch of the Shrine on the ground that the inscription contained a reference to the bombardment. The Mutawalli Bashi maintained that it contained nothing derogatory to the Russians, but he was nevertheless compelled to remove the stone. It was Haji Shaikh-ur-Rais who drew Prince Dabija s attention to the matter. See diary for the week ending April 25th. Mir Aziz has returned from Zurabad, having found it impossible to establish himself there in view of the opposition of the villagers. Abdul Hamid, lately dragoman to the Russian Consulate-General, has obtained for 70,000 tomans a lease of a large area of the property of the Shrine. I am informed that the Russian Minister in Tehran has sent to Prince Dabija a 'precis of the inquiry into the charges made against Abdul Hamid. Abdul Hamid admits that bribes were taken, but says that they were always divided, at first between himself, Prince Dabija, and M. Romanovsky, and afterwards between the same three and the Russian Tajjirbashi. It is said that M. Nikolski will be ordered to investigate the matter in Meshed. M. Romanovsky is trying to insist on a renewal of the present Tajjirbashi’s appointment for a further term of three years but the Russian subjects are resisting the proposal. M. Nikolski, the new Russian Consul-General, arrived in Meshed on May 15th. Satisfactory arrangements were made by the Persian authorities for his recep tion, but the representatives of the various departments sent to welcome him were so annoyed by the behaviour of some of the less respectable Russian subjects, who persisted hi preceding them, that they left the procession before it entered the town. M. Nikolski was disgracefully received at the Consulate-General, Prince Dabija met him on the steps and immediately left the house to pay some farewell calls. M. Romanovsky and Colonel Scouratt, the Military Attache, also left M. Nikolski at the door of the house and he was obliged to entertain his guests alone. Lunch was sent out to Bahrabad for M. Nikolski, but he got none, for it was all eaten before his arrival by Romanovsky and the Russian officers and subjects who went out to welcome the new Consul-General. Prince Dabija tells me that he will probably be leaving Meshed on Monday. A Russian Colonel who has been inspecting Consular escorts has arrived at Meshed. Miscellaneous. Herr Waldmann from Isfahan has arrived in Meshed as agent for the firm represented by Dr. Pugin, who is leaving for Yezd. Herat News. Risaladar Yar Muhammad Khan of Bala Murghab has received a visit from nine Russian officers, a Colonel, two Lt.-Colonels, five Captains and one other, who discussed Military matters with him. Turbat-i-Haidari News. I hear that Mustafa Mirza, the ex-Governor, who should be leaving Turbat to-morrow, blames me for this dismissal. Turbat is now quiet, but unless I can arrange for an enquiry into the conduct of Mustafa Mirza and Mirza Khalil Khan the people may again attempt to take bast. Mirza Khalil Khan s servant Ali Akbar, who opened fire on the crowd during the recent disturbance, is now under the protection of the Russian Consul. Political Summary. Condition of There is a very strong feeling throughout the province against the Revenue Department. The new taxes are much resented, but the §3 :s^ principal grievance of the people is the illegal enaction of the revenue gendarmes sent to collect the revenue. This feehng may possibly lead to local disturbances. Condition of Roads.—k caravan of Sistanis and Meshedis, travelling towards Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam en route for Sistan, was recently attacked by robbers at Shahan Garmab and eight men were killed. t Two men bringing a flock of 90 sheep from Chinaran to Meshed were robbed of their sheep by night just outside the Bala Khiyaban gate of Meshed on Mav 11th. 7 The death of the robber Nasir should render robberies on the Ashkabad road less frequent.

Nearly all the civil engineers in the service of the line have abandoned their appoint ments, and, while the majority have been replaced by inexperienced men, a number of sections remain without engineers in charge. The prevailing state of affairs is due to the series of accidents which have occurred during the past 3 months, the scandals connected with the fraudulent misappropriation of funds at Soro- chinsk, the unusual nature of the catastrophe near Saxaulsk, where a railway bridge collapsed and fell into the river beneath, and finally to the panic among officials, caused by the institution of criminal proceedings against some dozen railway em ployees, stationmasters and assistants, engine-drivers and assistants, guards and pointsmen. The Saxaulsk accident cost the railway nearly £200,000, as the receipts for March show. On April 24th, another accident occurred ; a train was derailed at verst 1,255, between Kazalinsk and Bik Bauli, owing to the breaking of an axle • the permanent way was damaged for a distance of 35 yards. 348.

The Persian Parliament.—The report sent me from Sistan last week on this subject proves to be erroneous. What the meeting of 13th May did was to nominate the gentlemen to represent Sistan at the Shah’s Coronation The nominees are Agha Mohamed Husain (brother of Mullah Mehdi, the Chief Mui- tehid. of Sistan) who resides in Tehran ; Agha Hasan Khan Jalal-i-Nizam repre senting the Sardars ; and Mirza Khurshid Khan (Hissam-ud-Dowleh’s Mustaufi) representing the Kadkhudad. Two other gentlemen are to be selected by His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk. J As regards Kainat, no gentlemen have yet been nominated to represent the district at the Coronation. The Governor has as yet received no orders on the subject of the Parliamentary elections. ^ It is understood that the recent formation of the new “ Eastern Province ” was overlooked when the orders were issued to the other Provinces, and it is believed that some orders are now on the way from Meshed. Baluch Raids. —(a) News reached Birjand on 17th May that the Governor’s Janbazes (camel-sowars) at Neh had just encountered 30 Baluchis—probably Haji Gulab’s band—about 48 miles west of that place, killing three, capturing two, and routing the rest. They also got possession of 14 camels. One Janbaz was killed and another’s camel was wounded. {b) The Governor has ordered Sardar Purdil Khan to arrest Aibu and the other Brahui robbers of Sistan. The Sardar has replied that he will do so if the Govern ment will give him 50 sowars permanently. It appears probable that the ruffians will remain at large on the Shela until the Governor goes himself to Sistan in the autumn, when they will probably betake themselves as usual to the Palang Koh hills. Afghan Robbers. —From Lutak it is reported that eight cows were carried oil into Afghanistan from Hauzdar—on the Sistan-Koh Malik Siah road—on the 7th May. Two Brahuis in the employ of Sardar Purdil Khan were sent to follow the tracks and eventually returned with four of the cows from Bandar Kamalan. It is suspected that they have divided up the value of the four others with the Afghan headmen of Bandar Kamalan. The Revenue Department. —The Persian Finance Agents at Birjand and •Sistan continue to correspond with each other by telegraph in acrimonious language, and the Sistan forces still await their arrears of pay.

The Commander of the Troops at Meshed has been appointed to represent the Governor-General at the coronation of the Young Shah. See last week’s diary. In consequence of the disturbance at Turbat-i-Haidari Mustafa Mirza, the Governor, and Mirza Khalil Khan, the Finance Agent, have been dismissed. The dismissal of the latter is said to be a great disappointment to the Russian Consul. The Salar-i-Humayun, grandson of Prince Nayyir-ud-Daulah has been transferred from Sabzawar to Turbat-i-Haidari as Governor. Nasir-ul-Ayalah has been confirmed as Governor of Kuh-i-Surkh for the current year. The Governor-General is said to have ordered Haji Shaikh-ur-Rais to leave Meshed until the elections are over. Mirza Khalil Khan, Financial Agent, left Turbat-i-Haidari for Meshed on the night of May 8th. Mustafa Mirza and Parviz Khan, local Chief of Police, who have also been dismissed, have mot yet left. Rais-ut-Tujjar, who recently followed Abdul Hamid, Dragoman of the Russian Consulate-General, to Tehran, has paid part of the bribe which he promised to the Karguzar for managing his affairs with the Russian Bank, by a cheque for 500 tumans which has been dishonoured. Persian Affairs. The elections are not causing much excitement. Both the Commander of the Troops and the Karguzar are said to be candidates. Letters have been received from Tehran recommending the election of the Commander of the Troops, Muhammad Ismail Kashif, Najd-us-Saltaneh, Deputy Governor-General, and Mutaman-us- Baltaneh, ex-Karguzar. A preacher named Mirza Abdulla, has come from Tehran as an Agent of the party of Union and Progress. The Governor-General, though personally opposed to parliamentary government, has, in obedience to orders from Tehran, issued orders for election and has urged all concerned to bring the business to a conclusion as soon as possible as the newly elected members should leave for Tehran without delay. The dismissal of the Governor and the Finance Agent at Turbat-i-Haidari has relieved the situation there. The bastis have left the British Agent’s house, but will not be content until those responsible for the firing on the crowd are punish ed. It is said that many more were killed than was at first reported. The Agent and the Karguzar have behaved extremely well throughout this affair. The Agent, whose status is only that of a news-writer and whose pay is in adequate, has a flag, but is not ordinarily permitted to fly it. I authorized him to fly it while the bastis were in his house, lest anybody should feign ignorance of the fact that the people were under protection of the British representative. A revenue gendarme made an insulting remark to the effect that the flag would very «oon be brought down with bullet-holes through it and the Agent by his personal influence had the man well flogged under the flag and compelled to apologize. The premature removal of the Consul from Turbat-i-Haidari is to be regretted. The revenue gendarmerie have provoked opposition in the village of Gumbazi, near Chinaran. The men of the village fled to Chinaran, but on hearing that the gen darmes were maltreating their women, returned to the village and attacked the gen darmes, injuring two of them. Some gendarmes were sent from Meshed to compound matters, but have returned unsuccessful and the villagers are still in bast in the Telegraph Office in Chinaran. In Akhanjan, near Meshed, which is the property of the Shrine, they have com pelled the people to pay additional taxes by seizing their sheep. f- 29 1974 \ India, Foreign Secretary’s ] \ No 24 '.1, dated 1C.

The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs has forbidden the lease of Shrine lands by Kasim Baig, Tajjir Bashi, but the Karguzar has again telegraphed to him urging him to permit it. The Nazir of the Russian Consulate-General has received a lease of 2,000 square zur’ of Shrine lands from Aghazada. Travellers. Dr. Esselstyn, of the American Presbyterian Mission, left Meshed on May 7th for Nishabur and Sabzawar. He proposes to be absent for about a month. Herat News. Mirza Muhammad Azim, a relative of Mirza Ghulam Haidar, the Customs official at Herat, has imported 100 breech-loading rifles with cartridges and a large quantity of caps from Meshed via Jamrud. The Customs sowars of Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam met the caravan at Nilabad, but were bought off with 80 tumans in qash and 4 rifles. The Amir has ordered that all sepoys under arrest on the charge of theft shall be sent to Kabul in chains. Five have been chained and 25 are still to be made ready for the journey. It is said that the sepoys are taking bast at Gazurgah. It is reported from Bala Murghab that four Afghan sowars have been seized by a party of Russian Cossacks who had crossed the frontier. An Afghan dajadar, who was invited to visit the Cossack post to take delivery of his four men, refused to do so, but said that he would take delivery of them on the frontier. The four sowars have not yet been surrendered. . There is considerable trouble over the rebuilding of the boundary pillars on the frontier. It is reported that the Russians are claiming more than the Russo-Afghan Boundary Commission allowed them and are disposed to insist on altering the sites of some pillars. . - Political Summary.

A circular letter from General Staff headquarters, Turkistan Military District, announces that these orders referred only to men whose period of service would, normally, have expired on January 1st, 1914 ; men, whose periods of service with the colours normally expires after that date, will, therefore, pass to the reserve on the expiration of those periods and will not be retained for any additional term.

Q .Mi i M ^ zl Sistan and Kain Consulate Diary No. 19, lor the week ending the 9th May (received the 6th June) 1914. 5th May. —Colonel Vygornitzky, Russian Acting Vice-Consul, safely reached Birjand to-day. From Shusp, five stages from Sistan, he drove in the carriage which Hissam-ud-Dowleh had kindly sent out for him. The report mentioned last week about his camels having been stolen by Baluchis has been found to be untrue. A few animals strayed, but were in due course recovered. 7th May.- — I started for Birjand with Mrs. Prideaux, Mr. Dormer of the Indo- European Telegraph Department, and Khan Sahib Muhammad Hasan Khan, Native Attache. We had all just crossed the branch of the Hamun about four miles outside the city, which is half a mile or more wide, when the wind freshened so much that on arrival at Lab-i-Ab, eight miles from the city, we found it impossible to embark on the tutins. We spent a miserable night, without our tents and much troubled by dust, on the edge of the Hamun. 8th and 9th May. —We took refuge in the village of Hissamiya, half a mile from the water, waiting for the storm to abate. We could not return to Sistan owing to the difficulty in crossing the water which intervened. General. The Military Forces in Sistan and Kainat. —I have heard a good deal lately about the dissatisfaction prevailing amongst the troops on account of the non receipt of their pay. The Rais-i-Qushun tells me that the Cavalry have drawn no pay at all from the Revenue Department during M. Paquct’s pcricd of office. As, however, the sowars are all furnished by the Sardars and a few Kadkhudas, and the latter have carefully withheld the equivalent of the men’s pay when rendering their revenues, no material harm has been suffered by this branch of the force. The camel-sowars, on the other hand, pay no revenues and they with one accord memorialized me all along the trade route, complaining that they had received no pay for four months, and that they had consequently all become indebted to the Consulate shop-keepers at Girdi and Koh-Malik-Siah. The Infantry Sarbazes and their officers are in similar distress. It is locally believed that M. Paquet has brought about this trouble on the occasion of his removal from Sistan. He happen ed to meet Shaukat-ul-Mulk on the road between Birjand and Meshed, and then stated that the Revenue Department had nothing to do with the payment of the troops in Sistan. The latter were paid directly by the Kadkhudas of villages. The Birjand troops have also been experiencing difficulties in regard to drawing their salaries. The Director has stated that the hitch here is due to Shaukat-ul- Mulk having made on his own initiative some small innovations contrary to the terms of the decree of 17th December last, which have not yet been confirmed by the State Council. The Revenue Department in Sistan.—I have just been able to effect a satisfac- ory settlement between Sardar Khan Jehan Khan Sanjeram, who had invoked my ssistanc e, and the Director of Revenues in a cuse winch threatened to give as much rouble as did the case between Sardar Khudadad Khan and M. de\\ eerdt see Diary ntries ending with No. 41 of 1912. Sardar Khan Jehan Khan it may be remem- lered, is the oldest and most respected of the four chief Sardars of &gt; istan. He has no lealings with Baluch raiders, and confines his attention very much to his own affairs, .ike the other Sardars, however, he has resented the efforts of M. Paquet to squeeze uore revenue out of him. Last summer with a view to punishing him M. Paquet announced his intention o give two Pagaos of land in one of the Sardar s villages to an outsider lamed Abdullah. The Deputy Governor was consulted by M Paquet as ;o the feasibility of this proceeding, and was told there was no difficulty, and that he Sardar himself had consented to it. Instead, however, of carrying out this V I - - ~~ A 7 x 1 India. Foreign Secretary's No 24 dated 11 JUN 1314 M2 proposal, M. Paquet issued an order to Abdullah to take over two whole villages, Malaki and Dakki, belonging to Khan Jehan Khan. The Sardar submitted to this arbitrary order for a time, and allowed Abdullah to arrange for all the autumn sowings. As soon as M. Paquet departed, however, he resumed possession of the properties by force and turned Abdullah’s men out. It was on the present Director’s applying to the Deputy Governor to take suitable measures for the ejectment of the Sardar that the latter applied to me, while the Deputy Governor who clearly sympathized with the Sardar also asked me for advice as to his action. In the result the Sardar came into the city, gave security for the payment of all his outstandings and was confirmed in the possession of his two villages^ On the eve of my departure from Sistan Sardars Khan Jehan Khan, Purdil Khan, Khudadad Khan and Nasir Khan, brother of Abbas Khan lately deceased, all called on me together, accompanied by a large following. It was the first time I had seen Khan Jehan Khan and Khudadad Khan. The first-named is the only Sardar who has consented to furnish sowars under the new regulations introduced by His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk. F. B.

I hope next week to be able to record the full list for the “ Eastern Province Baluch Raiders. —Under orders from His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk, the Deputy Governor of Sistan has been trying to arrest some men living in Sardar Pasand Khan’s encampment. They presumbly include the individual referred to in Diary No 16 under sub-head (h). Two Yar Ahmedzais were duly captured, but three others were assisted to escape by Pasand Khan. The latter is now in custody, and is being threatened with severe punishment if he fails to produce the absconders within 110 days. Locusts .—A flight of these pests appeared in southern Sistan, around Lutak and Sehkoha, on the 13th May. State of the Roads.—Two proofs of the insecurity of the country and of travel ling now-a-days are clearly found, {a) in the number of camel-men and donkey dirvers who have attached themselves to my caravan on this journey ; and (h) in the disappearance of all the flocks and herds which we met along the road last year. It is not only the Baluchis who are dreaded, but also a small number of Afghan outlaws, who frequent the Farah and Lash Juwain borders. F. B.

Meshed Diary No. 18, for (he week ending May 2nd (received the 1st June) 1914. Persian Officials. I tisam-ul-Mulk, recently recalled from Sarakhs, has been appointed Kar- guzar at Birjand. Shuja -ul-Ayalah, the late Governor of K.haf, has instigated 50 Timuri sowars, under their officer, Mir Ali Jan, to mutiny against Shaukat-us-Saltaneh, the newly appointed Governor. The Governor of Tabas has arrested and hanged the well-known brigand Timur Khafi. 6 J Fath-ul-Mulk is on his trial for having sent to Kalat-i-Nadiri a letter inciting the people to make trouble for their Governor. His plea is that the letter was written by a Mirza in Kalat whose handwriting resembles his own. The Mirza has been summoned to Meshed. r ,i . , Persian Affairs. There is a large party in the town which is opposed to the reopening of the Majlis, from which they say Persia has gained nothing. At a rawzakhani recently held at the house of Aghazada a sermon was preached against the constitution. The Russians are, of course, credited with encouraging this party, but I am not sure that it is not necessary to seek a Russian origin for the growing belief that Persia is not ready for representative government. A regrettable incident has occurred at Turbat-i-Haidari, where about 1,300 people from the surrounding villages assembled to protest against the new taxes and the rapacity of the subordinate revenue officials. The petitioners waited on the Governor but refused to be put off with the usual assurance that their grie vances would receive attention and were driven from the Governor’s garden with abuse. As they were returning, dejected but by no means turbulent, through the town, a personal servant of the revenue collector, Mirza Khalil Khan, and two revenue gendarmes fired on them from the roof of the revenue office killing one and wounding four. The crowd, which was unarmed, hastened out of the town to seek refuge in the shrine of Qutb-ud-Din and were followed by the local police, who fired on them, killing two and wounding one. Other villagers who had arrived at Turbat-i-Haidari with the same object were assembled at one of the gates of the town and the police marched to the gate and fired on the crowd, killing two of them. The Russian Consul at Turbat-i-Haidari has been active throughout this affair. Shortly after the villagers came to the town he sent his Cossacks through the town and they abused the villagers. He next informed the Karguzar that the lives and property of Russian subjects were not safe and receiv ed an official assurance that the petitioners were seeking justice against the Re venue Department and would not molest Russian subjects. He next attempted to justify his complaint by naming two Russian subjects whose shops had been plundered by the mob, but the Karguzar defeated him by summoning the two men before they had received instructions, and ascertaining from them that their shops had been closed and that they had suffered no loss. Mirza Khalil Khan, the revenue collector, has since taken bast in the Russian Consulate, whither he and his family were escorted by Cossacks. The leaders of the petitioners and the relatives of the men who have been shot have taken bast with the British Agent and have telegraphed to me for support. M. Collard, Provincial Inspector of Revenues, expressed to Prince Dabija in my presence disapproval of Mirza Khalil Khan’s action, and said that he pro posed to apply for the services of a Belgian official for Turbat-i-Haidari. My colleague signified his approval of this proposal, but was silent when M. Collaid informed him that he had also applied for a force of gendarmerie under Swedish Officers. India, Sect; Mo S3;J, dated 4 JUG 1914 r 7 a n u I An , .) A \ r i2a jm&amp;fj2 The Kareuzars at Meshed and Turbat-i-Haidan have reported the affair to Tehran and dll for the dismissal of the officials responsible tor the firing. They attribute the whole affair to the Russian intrigue but however the Russian Consul may ha ve attempted to turn it to what he believed to be his advantage it undoubt edly had its origin in Mirza Khalil Khan s exactions. The unpopularity of the Revenue Department is increasing in 'Meshed. The shopkeepers and artisans of the town have threatened a demonstration against thefr exactions and recently a number of villagers took bast in the Shrine to pro test against a new tax on fruit trees and could not be induced to leave until the levying of the tax had been suspended pending the receipt of orders from Tehran. The operations against the Shikari robbers have ended in a characteristic manner The troops, unable to effect anything against them had to be with- Lwn owing to their oppression of the villagers. In order to obtain their with drawal the villagers gave an undertaking to seize the Shikaris, which, of course, thev cannot do° The Shikaris will now probably receive a pardon in considera tion of an undertaking to rob no more. Bihbud is said to have given an under taking that he would capture the Shikaris, and his brother Fath-ul-Mulk has been arrested bv the Governor-General on the ground that he stood surety for Bihbud Khan and must answer for his failure. _ . _ i The mullas of Meshed have been much annoyed by a series of articlesJn the Nau Bahar on the ignorance and incapacity of mullas and. the depressed condi tion of women in Islam. These articles are attributed to Haji Shaikh-ur-Rais. The mullas have demanded the suppression of the paper but the Governor-General has promised to refer the matter to Tehran. According to some the mullas are so angry that they are likely to have the editor assassinated. • I OOSX n/Vl /I TT/V'i'rQ The Karguzar has recommended the lease of 20,000 square zar of the Shrine lands outside the Arg gate to Qasim Baig, the Russian Tajirbashi. It is to be hoped that the recent orders from the Department of Public Instruction prohibit ing the lease of endowment lands to foreigners will prevent the Shrine officials from granting the lease, According to a list recently prepared and sent to the Russian Minister in Tehran, Abdul Hamid Khan is said to possess 80,000 roubles in cash and moveable property worth 60,000 roubles. His wife claims 5,000 roubles on account of her dowry. The Russian Agent at Kuchan has been dismissed and is now a candidate for Abdul Hamid’s post. Travellers. Dr. Pugin has returned unexpectedly to Meshed. He was to have travelled from Birjand to Kerman. Mr. Robertson, of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, arrived safely in Meshed with his wife and family on May 1st. Herat News, Risaldar Yar Mohammad Khan has been warned by the Governor of Herat to hold less intercourse with the Russian officers on the frontier. The Amir has ordered that Ismail Baig, brother of Sayyid Muhammad Baig Jamshidi, who returned to Herat from Russia last year, is to be sent with his family to Kabul via Kandahar, and if he refuses to go is to be expelled from Afghanistan. Kariz News. One Haji MuklKar has been detected in an attempt to smuggle 18 Werndl rifles from Meshed to Herat. The rifles have been confiscated. A caravan of 170 persons has arrived at Kariz from Herat. The Amir’s removal of restrictions on travellers to Persia is much appreciated.C 5 The Kaudani Timuris, about 700 families, threaten, if they are further pressed by the Revenue Department, to demand from the Persian Government the price of their lands and to return to Afghanistan. Political Summary, Condition of Country. —The country is somewhat disturbed owing to the strong feeling against the Revenue Department. The people complain against the new taxes, but their chief grievance is the unauthorised exactions of the revenue collectors and gendarmes. Condition of Roads. —I have no news of any robberies on the roads. The Governor-General. —Prince Nayyir-ud-Daulah remains on the best of terms with this Consulate-General and is obliging in any cases that are referred to him. T. W.

Movements of troops. —The arrival in Meshed of an informant from Krasnovodsk has resulted in the acquisition of the following intelligence The information, contained in paragraph 182, to the effect that 500 mounted men were despatched by sea, about February 1st, from Krasnovodsk to Persian ports, is incorrect. Reuter’s telegram, dated Tehran, February 18th, which stated that 500 troops disembarked at Enzeli, early in February, remains, therefore, unconfirmed by any reports from Turkistan. The facts, stated in paragraph 146, are confirmed and the informant states, that in addition to the 500 Cossacks, who arrived' with horses, from Baku, on January 27th and 28th, batches of mounted men, to the number of 1,750, arrived early in February at Krasnovodsk from Persian ports and from Baku, and proceeded eastwards by train, usually at night. Reports from other sources in Turkistan do not corroborate this statement, either as regards the large numbers given or as to the movement by train or detrainment at stations, east of Krasnovodsk, of any troops, other than recruits. In view, however, of the fact that the season foqthe arrival of recruits for the regular garrison of Turkistan had closed it appears probable that the conclusion arrived at and stated in paragraph 161 is correct and that the detachments, reported to have arrived in certain stations, specified below, were not recruits but troops, withdrawn from service in Persia 110 men, 19th Turkistan Rifle Regiment, detrained at Askhabad, January 30th ; 100 men, 1st Taman Cossack Regiment, detrained at Askhabad, JanuarySOth; 300 men, 1st Caucasus Cossack Regiment, detrained at Merv, February 1st; 100 men, 1 st Caucasus Cossack Regiment, detrained at Merv, : February 15th ; 77 men, 1st Taman Cossack Regiment, detrained at Askhabad, February 21st; 50 men, 4th Kuban Cossack Mountain Artillery, detrained, Askhabad February 22nd.2 Fifty men, Kuslik Field Railway Company, passed through Merv, April 13th, from the direction of Kushk, destination unknown.

Khazin-ul-Mulk, Governor of Sabzawar, arrived in Meshed on the morning of April 21st, escorting his wife, who is very ill. It is said that the government of Sabzawar will be given to his son, at present Governor of Tabas. The Governor-General entertained my colleague at a farewell dinner party on April 18th. Vusuq-us-Sultanah, the Karguzar at Meshed, has received the title of Muazzaz- ud-Daulah. See last week’s diary. Haji .Murtaza Mirza, Governor of Gunabad, has been summoned to Turbat-i-Haidari for the enquiry into the murder of the man said to be a Kussian subject. Iqtidar-ul-Mulk, Governor of Kalat-i-Nadiri and nephew of Nayyir-ud-Daulah, has paid his ancle 2,800 tomans as pishkash for his government for the current year. Nayyir-ud-Daulah demanded 5,000 tomans from A’dal-ud-Daulah, Gover nor of Kuchan, but by Prince Dabija’s intervention the demand was reduced to 2,000 tomans. ’ Persian Affairs. A telegram from the Minister of Interior announcing that the people of Khorasan are about to be called upon to elect their representatives for the Majlis has been published. After a general exhortation to all concerned to see that the election is properly conducted, and to the electors to subordinate self-interest to the public good, the telegram states that written instructions have been sent by post to the Governor-General, and that the election should be conducted in accordance with these instructions. A meeting has been held to discuss the approaching election, but the speeches were very restrained, and no definite resolution was passed. The Governor-General, under instructions from Tehran, has issued notices calling for subscriptions for the widow of the late Major Ohlssen. Russian Affairs. Abdul Hamid Khan, Dragoman to the Russian Consulate-General, left Meshed for Tehran via Ashakabad on the 20th instant. His connection with the Russian Consulate-General has, I believe, been severed, but Prince Dabija gave him a letter to the effect that he had been granted two months’ leave in order that an apparent connection with the Consulate-General might serve as a protection to him. It is reported that some Caucasians have prepared to waylay him, but I doubt this, as he has been allowed an escort of two Cossacks and two Turkoman sowars. M. Romanovsky informs me that M ; Nikolski, who is to relieve Prince Dabija, is expected in Meshed in three weeks’ time and that Prince Dabija will then leave. Preparations are being made for an Istiqbal for M. Nikolski at Kuchan and Meshed. I hear that Prince Dabija has informed A’dal-ud-Daulah, Governor of Kuchan, that the Persian Minister of Interior will not agree to the separation of Kuchan from Provincial Government of Khorasan, of which it forms an integral part, but has promised A’dal-ud-Daulah that he will raise the question in St. Petersburg. Miuza Abdul Rahman Mudarris, acting ostensibly as agent to Nasir-ud-Daulah, has been persuaded by the Russian Consul-General to execute a lease conveying fifty-three plots of land at Zurabad on the Hari Rud to Haji Ali Akbar Kashi who has transferred the lease to Mir Aziz, a Russian subject. Seven of the cultivators of this land were sent to Khiva, where they were registered as Russian subjects, and have now returned to Zurabad. Mir Aziz, on representing to Prince Dabija that he could not holi^ctod without the assistanceof armed men, was allowed to arm m 11 jilt : • ithe seven men who had been registered as Russian subjects, and was promised that they should be paid by the Russian Consul-General. Prince Dabija has also written to the Governors of Russian and Persian Sarakhs, requesting them to assist Mir Aziz should he require help. Nusrat-ul-Mulk, the owner of Zurabad, has protested to the Governor-General against the lease of the land and requested him to decide the matter between him and Abdur Rahman Mudarris as two Persian subjects. The Governor-General has written to Prince Dabija, but has received no reply. Mir Aziz has sent ten more men to take possession of the land, and Rusrat- ul-Mulk declares that they will be resisted by force and that the responsibility for any bloodshed that may occur will not be his. British Interests. The Governor-General, at the instance of the Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, has issued orders for the provision of a guard for a remittance of 18,000 to mans in cash and 50,000 tomans in notes between Turbat-i-Haidari and Birjand. The Karguzar has lately displayed gross negligence if nothing worse in the settlement of the claims of British subjects, but I am glad to say that a sharp re monstrance has brought him to his senses. Herat News. By the Amir’s orders the Commandant of the Farah Regiment has been sent to Kabul in chains, and the sepoys have been directed to elect Vakils to prefer their charges against him. The well-known thief Lalu and five of his followers have been brought to Herat and hanged in pairs on three successive days. The Governor has complained to the Commandant of the Russian post opposite to Chihil Dukhtaran that some Russian subjects have been cultivating land on the Afghan side of the border at Chashma-i-Tarbar, but no reply has yet been received. Kariz News. From a caravan of 150 men and women which has arrived at Kariz from Herat it is learnt that the Amir has removed restrictions on Afghan travellers to Persia. A party of Mohmands has been detected in an attempt to smuggle rifle barrels concealed in kerosine oil tins into Afghanistan, and the Customs authorities have confiscated ten rifle barrels. Political Summary. Condition of Country .—I have heard nothing more of the operations against the Shikari robbers. Condition of Hoads .—The Provincial Postmaster-General reports that robbers recently attacked the Daragaz post, and took the postman’s rifle and cartridges and a parcel. See diary for the week ending April 4th. Three Afghans have been observed selling some merchandise on the frontier in order to get enough money to pay the Afghan Customs dues on the rest of their goods. From the merchandise in their possession it appears that they are likely to be the murderers of the Kakuris who were killed near Sangbast, and Abdullah Khan has written to Herat asking the Governor to arrest them.

Russian settlers in 'Northern Persia. —The Russian press continues to give varying accounts of the condition of the settlers in Astarabad and in Northern Persia generally. Among the settlements mentioned are those of some Molokhans, 32 miles from Bandar-i-Gaz, two Dukhobor villages, near those of the Molokhans and a timber enterprise taken up by two retired naval officers, Dolgoroukin and Veinerof; the settlers are not all of the poorer classes, nor have they emigrated under compul sion. A “ state ” councillor by name Poletika, from Petersburg, is said to have made use of the good offices of General Lavrof, the head of the Russo-Persian Boundary Commission, to buy a large area of land in the neighbourhood of Astar abad. These purchases and leases are contracted, both parties to the contract well knowing that the Persian Government does not recognize as legal any contracts, made by foreigners in Persia, which are not witnessed by the officials, appointed for that purpose, the Karguzars. Haji Muhammad Hassan Khan, of Muhammad- abad, on the south coast of the Caspian, one of the largest dealers in the nefarious sale of Government land to Russian settlers at a nominal price, is said to be a strong anti-constitutionalist. The land, in which he has trafficked lies for the greater part in the valley of the R. Bobil, between Meshed-i-Sar and Muhammad- abad. 314. Resuscitation of old agricultural district. —A survey party, under Engineer A. A. Rudinski, has been sent, by a private company, to the Russo-Persian frontier, to the right bank of the river Atrek and of its tributary, the Sumbar. with a view to examining the question of the possibility of restoring the district to the prosperous condition, in which it appears once to have been, and from which it has fallen owing to the abandonment of the irrigation system, traces of which are in existence. The initiation of irrigation-schemes, on frontiers, in Central Asia, | is usually attended with consequences of more or less political interest. Resources. 315. Horse-breeding. —Prince Shcherbatof, Director of Government Studs, is about to re-visit Turkistan. He will arrive at Krasnovodsk, 30th April, and after visiting Askhabad, Merv, Kushk, Samarkand, Jizak, Skobelef, Tashkent and Aris, he will return to Petersburg. Four thorough-bred stallions have arrived at the Tashkent stud-farm ; there are now seventeen stallions, of which twelve are kept at Tashkent and fi\ e are posted for service as follows one at the government estate of Kaplanbek, two at ToiTiub, yftjMi.

Persian The Karguzar, Vusuq-us-Saltaneh, is apparently feathering his nest in anticipation of transfer or dismissal. He has done much for the Russians, but does not allow his friendship for them or fear of them to interfere with his own interests. In cases in which British subjects are concerned I am having some trouble with him owing to his having received bribes from the opponents of their just claims. The Mutawalli Bashi, on whom I refused to call on the occasion of the Nauruz, called on me on April 14th, apologizing for his publication of a false statement to the effect that the picture recently restored to the shrine had not belonged to it. See last week's diary. Steps are being taken to enquire into the murder of a Russian subject by Shahzada Haji Murtaza Mirza, Governor of Gunabad, but the Karguzar at Turbr.t-i-Haidari has asked the Russian Consul for documentary evidence of the murdered man’s nationality, regarding which there is some doubt. Persian Affairs. See last week’s diary. The three Afghans who were attempting to smuggle rifles and cartridges into Afghanistan have been brought into Meshed and imprisoned. Secret .—The case of the Russian attempt to obtain from the Rais-ut-Tujjar, towards the settlement of his debt to the Russian Bank, the concession for main- 4 taining the road from Meshed to Bajgiran has been referred to the Persian Cabinet and the . Ministers have directed that the Minister in charge of the Public Works should take immediate steps for the repair of the road. The Ministers decided that the Rais-ut-Tujjar had never had the right to transfer the concession to foreigners, and that owing to -his dishonesty and his neglect ing to repair the road he had lost all rights under the concession. The Russian Legation and the Karguzar at Meshed have been informed accordingly. At the instance of the Chief of Police the Governor-General has issued a notice to the effect that all houses built over the streets in Meshed must be pulled down. The destruction of these houses will be a useful reform as the covered streets under them are dark tunnels which afford convenient lurking places for thieves, but the order is sure to cause grave discontent, and I doubt whether it can be enforced without the payment of heavy compensation, for which no provision has been made. Russian Affairs. A photograph of the Russian officer who styles himself Sikandar Khan or Sharif Khan has been delivered to the Governor of Herat, who is having copies made for distribution to frontier officials. M. Suprunoff, Manager of the Russian Bank, has received an order trans ferring him to Tabriz and leaves Meshed on the 20th instant. I hear that the Karguzar has recommended him to the Foreign Minister for a Persian decora tion. A Russian officer and six Cossacks are said to be travelling from Kuehan to Shahrud via Isfarayin and Sabzawar. I hear that my Colleague asked permission from the Foreign ^ Office in St. Petersburg to leave Meshed, handing over^ charge to his assis an , M. Romanovsky, and was ordered to remain at his post until the amva of is successor. It is to be hoped that these orders will be obeyed. ^ M. Romanovsky could do much harm in Meshed, even during a short term of officiation.British Affairs. At the request of the Imperial Bank of Persia the Governor-General is supplying a guard for a remittance of 33,000 tomans, which is being sent from Sabzawar to Turbat-i-Haidari. Travellers. The Paquet brothers of Sistan left Meshed about a week ago. Hakki Bey, an Ottoman subject and correspondent of the Tanin news paper, recently sought permission of the Governor of Herat, through Abdullah Khan,’ the un-official Afghan Agent in Meshed, to enter Afghanistan. The Governor’s reply was that if he attempted to cross the frontier he would certainly be shot. Hakki Bey has since left for Bujnurd. Herat News. The troops in Herat still display a spirit of unrest which is fostered by a report that the troops at Kabul have declined to accept their pay on the ground that it is insufficient for their support. It is also said that the Governor and the Brigadier, Path Muhammad Khan, have received orders to deprive the Khaki Paltan of its ammunition and hand it over to other regiments in Herat, and to send Saiyid Muhammad Khan, Commandant of the Khaki Paltan, to Kabul, but are afraid to carry out the orders. Four sepoys implicated in recent robberies have been disarmed and handed over to the civil authorities for punishment, but robberies still continue and the men of the Khaki Paltan have insolently demanded satisfaction for the death of one of their comarades who was killed while attempt ing, with some others, to commit robbery in the villages of Hauz-i-Kirbasi. Turbat-i-Haidari News. Mirza Khalil Khan of the Revenue Department is intriguing against the Karguzar, whose friendship with the British Agent he resents. It may become necessary to befriend the Karguzar, who has done much for British interests in Turbat-i-Haidari Kariz News. &gt; Mirza Mehdi, interpreter to the Russian Doctor, has died recently. His death is little to be regretted, for he was extremely mischievous as an inventor of plague scares. Political Summary. Condition of Country. —The operations against the Shikari robbers, reported in previous diaries, have so far been productive of no result, but the troops are not idle. They have plundered three villages and forced the villagers to come into Meshed to support themselves' by labour. These fugitives say that the Shikaris are not ill-disposed towards the authorities, but have a blood feud with Kerbalai Husain Khan, Deputy Governor of Baluk, who has treated them with great barbarity. Condition of Roads. —There are no reports of robberies on the roads. T. W. HAIG, Lieutenant Colonel, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General in Khorasan.SECRET.

The Revenue Department in Birjand and Sistan.—The Birjand Director, Mirza Khan who had got into the way of thinking that he could sen any ^avalnt ’ sort of complaint through the English telegraphists to members of His Maiesty’s Legation, has received a snub and been told to refer to Mr. Vice- CWl New when in difficulties.

General, The Governor of Sistan and Kain. —The pay of Hia Excellency the Shaukat-ul- Mulk’s Deputy at Sistan has been fixed at tomans 300 per mensem. This amount includes tomans 50 for the pay of the Chancery Clerk, Mirza Afkham-us-Sultan, and tomans 50 for establishment. The Governor, evidently thinking this sum insufficient, has signified his willing ness to recommend to Tehran that the pay of Sartip Mohammed Reza Khan should be increased, and in the event of this not being sanctioned, to pay him something from his own pocket. His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk has opened a subscription list on behalf of the family of the Swedish officer who was recently killed near Shiraz. The news of the marriages between members of Sardars Purdil Khan and Khudadad Khan’s families has not apparently disturbed His Excellency Shaukat-ul- Mulk. He has, however, instructed his Deputy here to keep an eye upon them. Hashmat-ul-MulJc. —His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran telegraphs that he is now endeavouring to find out how much can be recovered from Hashmat-ubMulk against the sum outstanding for British losses by Baluch raiders. Tomans 1,000 was recently sent to Tehran by Hashmat-ul-Mulk’s agent here— Ghulam Hasan Khan. The late Karguzar of Sistan— Ihtisham-i-Humayun—writing to Sartip Mohammed Reza Khan, says that an article, written at the instigation of Hashmat- ul-Mulk complaining of the unjust treatment he was receiving and containing certain diatribes against the British, was published in a Tehran newspaper, but that the issue of the paper was suppressed by the Persian Government. A small deputation of pro-Hashmatites recently waited on the Chief Mullah of Sistan, Mohammed Mehdi, and suggested that a telegram should be sent to Tehran protesting against Hashmat-ul-Mulk’s detention. The Mullah advised them to show their sympathy in the more concrete form of cash ; this, he said, would do more to help Hashmat-ul-Mulk out of his difficulties than any number of telegrams. The Revenue Department in Sistan. —Ibtihaj-us-Sultan, the Director, has been endeavouring to obtain leave or a transfer from Sistan, so far without success. I hear that Mr. Paquet’s successor is likely to be M. Cqllard from Meshed who will leave for Sistan on being relieved by the present Director of the Revenue Department at Kermanshah. The Karguzar at Izz-ul-Mamalik has received orders that he will be relieved by Mirza Hussein Khan, Ihtisham-ul-Mulk, very shortly, and that he should then leave for Meshed. He is very disturbed over the matter and en quired from His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Birjand as to the meaning of this sudden order. His recall is doubtless due to the irregularities in his passport accounts discovered by the Inspector of Passports and to his failure to work amicably with the other Government Departments in Birjand. Baluch Raids.—(a) Some days ago five camels from Zainulabad and five from Mud were looted by, it is said, men of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk. (h) Three of the men who accompanied Mir Jehind’s lashkar to Bam last February (see Diary No. 7) have returned to their homes with their share of the loot consisting of 30 sheep and goats. They are tribesmen of Jehmd, but reside in Sardar Pasand Khan’s territory, India, ku '■ s 7 P/IAY 1914(c) A report from Neh states that Idoo and Juma Khan with some other professional raiders have pitched their tents near that place. They are reported to have been on their way to present gifts to, and crave pardon from, His Excel lency Shaukat-ul-Mulk. At Neh they met with a certain Haji Muhammad who advised them to abandon their intention as the moment was not propitious. They eventually handed a letter and some presents to Haji Muhammad for conveyance to Shaukat-ul- Mulk and then returned to their homes. Despite their mission of peace they actually had the impudence to entrust one camel-load of looted “ Givas ” to Haji Muhammad to dispose of at Neh ; this, I understand, was successfully carried out! I am reminding His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk that these men are the worst characters amongst the Sistani Baluchis and that their arrest and punishment would be a step in the right direction. {d) See last diary. It is reported from several places that Mir Jehind, Taj Mohamed Reqi and other Sarhad Baluchis left on the 15th instant to plunder the Kainat. They are said to have given out that they intend taking as many prisoners as they can, and only releasing them on condition that Hashmat-ul- Mulk is allowed to go free. Shaukat-ul-Mulk has been informed. Gurgich Baluchis. —Kadkhudas Nawab Khan and Sher Mohammed Khan, who led the attack on Kaud last year and who afterwards fled to Afghanistan, are now on their way to ask forgiveness and offer their services to Shaukat-ul- Mulk, D.

Imad-ul-Mulk has been confirmed as Governor of Tabas for the new year on pay' ment of the usual pishkash. 1 J Persian Affairs. The Karguzar has received a telegram from the Minister for Foreign Affairs directing him to refuse to acknowledge or seal leases of Khalisa lands by the revenue authorities to foreigners. The Gendarmerie returning from Birjand had a quarrel with Riza Pahlvan vara buran of Bobat-i-Kumai. One gendarme was wounded. The Governor-General says that he has heard from Tehran that Khurasan and Azerbaijan will be the last provinces in which elections will be held, and expresses the opinion that the more delay there is in the matter the better, as it is advisable that the Shah should be crowned before the Majlis assembles. A disturbance has taken place at Faruj, apparently owing to the action of the revenue officials. The Provincial Inspector of Kevenue wished to send revenue gendarmes to quell it, but the Governor-General has sent some troops under the command of Hizhabr-i-Nizam. Russian Affairs. It is reported that A dal-ud-Daulah, Governor of Kuchan, has been pressing my colleague for news regarding the separation of Kuchan from the government of Khurasan. Prince Dabija is said to have replied that he hopes that orders on the subject will arrive before his departure, but that, in the meantime, the progress of the business will be facilitated by the payment of 6,000 tumans, of which 4,000 will be required by the Russian Legation at Tehran and 2,000 by the Consulate-General at Meshed. Reports are current that Abdul Hamid, dragoman to the Russian Consulate- General, is about to be dismissed and that M. Romanovski is about to be transferred to Isfahan. Meshed would be well rid of the pair of them. The Russian Officer, who styles himself Sikandar Khan or Sharif Khan, is still : at Kariz and is said to be awaiting an opportunity of crossing the Afghan frontier. ; The Afghan Officials have been warned. ^ An employe of the Russian Bank has arrived at Turbat-i-Haidari with a view to opening a branch of the bank there. A dismissed revenue gendarme, named Hussain Ali Baig, attempted to extort some grain from a villager of Hakimabad, and on meeting with a refusal, wounded the man with his sword and drove off some of his sheep. The Governor of Chinaran sent some sowars to seize Husain Ali Baig, but he sought the assistance of the Russian Cossacks at Chinaran, and they went to Hakimabad and beat some of the villagers so severely that one of them is at the point of death. Lieutenant Sapozhnikoff, with 120 time-expired men of the 1st Semirechia Cossacks, left Meshed for Semirechia on April 2nd. British Affairs. A remittance of 50,000 tumans for the Imperial Bank of Persia has safely reached Subzavar from Tehran and has been sent on to Nishabur. Travellers. Dr. Pugin, the German merchant, left Meshed in his motor car last week and arrived in Turbat-i-Haidari. He intends to stay there a few days and then travel on to Birjand and thence to Kerman. The Paquet brothers of Sistan arrived in Meshed this week.2 Herat News. - The troops are still out of hand, and on March 21st two regiments refused to deposit their arms in the magazines after parade The first regiment the Paltan-i- Khaki retained their arms because they wished to shoot, so they said, four of their mvn men who had stolen and concealed some Government rifles, and a sepoy of the Loeari regiment who had informed against them. On hearing this the Logari regiment refused to deliver its arms. Brigadier Path Muhammad Khan quieted the two regiments and imprisoned the four rifle thieves in his own house. Reports of the depredations of the sepoys in the town, which still continue, have rpnehed Kabul and the Governor has been asked for a report on the subject. Kariz News. A revenue gendarme of Kariz while drunk wounded a villager. The officers of the Gendarmerie are attempting to ush the matter up by promising the wounded man a compensation if he will refrain from reporting the matter to the new Gov ernor. t Political Summary. Condition of country—Some Government sowars were lately besieging some robbers in a village near Chinaran and sent to the Governor-General for assistance. He replied that he would send them reinforcements and a gun. I have not heard whether he has done this, or what the result of the affair. Condition of roads. —The road between Turbat-i-Haidari and Gunabad is not safe. The Rais-ut-Tujjar, who is being pressed by the Russians, is evidently no longer able to pay his employes. Muhammad Khan and three others of his servants have fled and are robbing on the roads between Shirwan and Kuchan. They should do well as they served their apprenticeship to the trade under Naib Husain of Kashan. Two men, said to be Kakuris, have been murdered one farsakh from Sangbast on the Herat road. They and two other men left Meshed for Herat with eleven donkeys laden with merchandise. The two other men and the donkeys have dis appeared, and it is not certain whether they have been carried off by robbers or whether the two men who have disappeared murdered their companions. T. W.

The Rais-i-Isfcinaf has arrived in Meshed from Tehran. Shazada Haji Mnrtaza Mirza, Governor of Gunabad, is in trouble. He has put to death two of his servants, one of whom was a Russian subject while the other is a brother of the brigand Riza Pahlvan who is well able to avenge him. Salar-i-Humayun, grandson of Nayyir-ud-Daulah, is confirmed in the gov ernment of Turshiz for the new year. Rumours are current that the Mutawalli Bashi has been dismissed and that Aga Sayyid Mohammad Sediq Tabetabai, who was recently elected to the Maj lis, has been ^ appointed in his [place. The Russians are said to be protesting against the dismissal of the Mutawalli Bashi who is entirely subservient to them. See diary for the week ending March 14th, the Governor-General has receiv ed orders authorizing him to retain Mansur-ul-Mamalik as Governor of Nardin. Nusrat-ul-Mulk remains Governor of Zurabad for the new year. Persian Affairs. The Governor-General has issued a notice announcing the establishment of a Provincial Court of Justice, to be divided for the present into three divisions, (1) Original Civil, (2) Commercial, and (3) Criminal. The people are directed to carry their complaints to this Court. I am informed that the Governor-General has urged the authorities at Teh ran to send Swedish Officers to Meshed for the Gendarmerie. Both the Governor-General and the Provincial Postmaster-General are request ing the authorities at Tehran to permit them to make a road to Turbat-i-Haidari and Turshiz. They fear that, unless they obtain permission, the Russians will undertake the construction of the road. Gunabad has been placed for administrative purposes under Tabas, and Imad-ul-Mulk, Governor of Tabas, has been authorized to appoint a Deputy Gov ernor. Naib Ali Akbar Hasani, a reactionary who was conspicuous at the time of bom bardment of the shrine and afterwards fled to Bujnurd, has persuaded Aghazada to stand surety for his good behaviour, and by this means has obtained the Gov ernor-General’s permission to return to Meshed. Three Afghans, who were attempting to smuggle 15 rifles and 300 cartridges into Afghanistan, have been seized at Qalandarabad, and the Governor-General has ordered that they should be sent to Meshed. Russian Affairs. The villagers of Shirwan have wounded a Cossack who was abducting a girl from their village, but the Cossack shot the girl’s brother and got away. Prince Dabija is making careful enquiries of Muhammad Akbar, the Russian spy in Herat, regarding the names of the oflicers and ringleaders of the mutinous or discontented troops. The Russian Consulate-General is extremely dissatisfied with the Karguzar and is said to be collecting evidence of corruption against him. The Russian Officer, who styles himself Sikandar Khan, has returned from J Kariz to Turbat-i-Haidari. UwL',, I ■ ' f V | No 20:,1, dated i a. 191-British Interests. Rumours are current inthe town that a German Consul-General is to be appoint ed to Meshed, and that on his arrival the British Consul-General will be with drawn and replaced by a Vice-Consul. Local experts in foreign affairs account for this to their own entire satisfaction by saying that the British do not wish to come into direct conflict with the Russians, and in Tabriz have hit upon the expedient of putting up a German Consul to do their dirty work and are about to adopt the same plan in Meshed. Herat News. A boy of 17 years of age has been arrested in Herat. It appears that he has been a companion of the sepoys who have been committing thefts in the town and that his statements may lead to the detection of criminals and the recovery of some of the stolen property. ^ Kariz News. .

' *' 273. Russian Settlers in Northern Perm.-^ussian families from Turkistan left Rrasnovodsk by steamer on 22nd March. They disembarked at Chikishliar and are proceeding up the River Atrek to found settlements in Northern Persia. They stated that they had been sent by order of the Governor-General of Tur kistan ; many of the men had left their families at home, intending to send for them at a later date. The Tehran newspaper “Rad” demands the Adoption of measures to put a stop to the influx of Russian settlers into the Astarabad province, such immi gration being in contravention of existing treaties. 274. Reported British enterprise in Northern Persia .—The “ Askhabad ” {llth-24th. March) states that 1,200 square versts of land (527 square miles) have been rented on a lease of 80 years, in the Khallakh Khanate, Northern Persia, by Lieute^ nant Colonel Tsiss,. of the Russo-Persian Boundary Commission, and by General Fidarof, Commanding the Punitive Column, stationed on the frontier, with the express intention of re-conveying-the estate to an Enlish cotton company, which infeid to found plantations and to erect a cotton-ginning factory 'on it. The Russian newspaper deplores the unpatriotic behaviour of these officers, through the medium of whom it has become possible for British trade to threaten Russian supremacy in the Persian market. 275'. Belgian offieials in Persia .—Evidence has been collected by Russian official representatives in Tehran, Tabriz and in other Persian towns, to the effect that from the year 1910 to 1913 the Belgian officials, employed in the Persian Customs, Post Office and Public Works, have persisted in a policy of open antagonism to Russia. This evidence has been laid before the Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs. (“ Askhabad ”, 21st March-3rd April.) 276. Russo-German dispute in Northern Persia .—The German, Heir Shiune- mann, whose claim to a portion of the State fortress in Tabriz is supported by the German Consul and has evoked a protest from the Russian Consul, is conveying materials for building to the a disputed ground. 277. Political .—The “Turkestanskia Viedomosti” (14th-27th March), a semi-offi cial organ, devotes two columns to a leading article on “ British policy in Persia it is stated that Azerbaijan is about to secede from Persia and it is proposed in the most straightforward manner that Great Britain and Russia should revise the agreement of 1907 and divide the neutral zone, working henceforward each in her own sphere without hindrance and without fear of German interference. The “ Askhabad ” states that British diplomacy, bent on retaining the services of the Persian gendarmerie in the neutral zone, has refused to assent to the assignment of an advance of five million roubles, asked for by M. Mornard, unless guarantees are forthcoming (14th-27th March). The same authority states that the Persian Government has refused the Russian request that the establish ment of the Persian Cossack Brigade may be increased and the sphere of activity V aowiwnsvi India, Fore Gm Secreiafu 3 j No 2OR, dated 14 4 AY 1014 * j2 of the gendarmerie diminished, the refusal being on the ground that there are no funds that the Cossack Brigade is useless and that its insubordinate behaviour and reactionary policy in the past has destroyed the confidence of Government. 278. Frontier incident. —On 13th March, on the Russo-Persian frontier, at a distance of 5 miles from the station of Baba-Durma, Central Asian Railway, 47 miles east of Askhabad, two Persian goat-herds were killed by two men of the Russian Frontier Guards, who stated that the Persians had attempted to seize their rifles. 279. Disturbances, Trans-Caspia. —A Cossack officer of high rank was murder ed at Merv, on 11th March; the murderer escaped. 280. Disturbances, Tejend. —On 19th March, shots were fired hfto the water ing station at Tejend, it is supposed, by Turkomans. There are disputes out standing between the Turkomans and the tenants of local government land. 281. Bokharan a^afrs.—The new Russian Political Agent, M. Bielaief, has arrived at Bokhara and has assumed control of the administration of Bokharan affairs to an extent that is arousing local discontent. Bokharans are returning to Bokhara from all parts of Russian Turkistan. 282. Disturbances, Russo-Afghan frontier. —It is reported that, on about 19th March, a Russian Frontier Guard-post, near Takhta Bazar, was burned and the- garrison of nine soldiers killed by some 50 Afghans, who, it is said, were enraged by the story of an Afghan fugitive, robbed of his money by some men of the post. It is reported from Samarkand that a detachment of Russian mounted men and infantry crossed the Afghan frontier on about the same date and, meet ing an Afghan force, were driven back with the loss of one officer killed. Further reports state that Russian troops are being collected at Kerki and Termez. A notice has been sent by the Afghan authorities to Afghan subjects in Russian ter ritory, ordering them to return to Afghanistan. The Russian authorities are plac ing no obstacles in the way of Afghans leaving Russia, but are preventing any from entering Russia. Local rumour attributes the strained relations between Russia and Afghan istan to the dissatisfaction of the Amir at the impending extension of the Russian railway system to the Oxus at Termez. 283.

The line is complete to Bogha, a distance of 12 miles from Samarkand. On 23rd March, work on the construction of the railway was suddenly suspend ed. Local officials state that the cessation of work is due to the orders of the Amir of Bokhara, who, it is said, has been urged by the Amir of Afghanistan and by the Government of Persia to desist from encouraging this advance of the Russian railway system; the Commandants of Tashkent and Samarkand districts visited Bokhara on the 25th March; in connection with the subject. The Press states that work has been stopped only tempotarily, pending the final decision as to the alignment of the railway, and that the Chief Engineer has left for Petersburg to receive orders. ,.:a:'■? . .... .&gt; • &gt; • -• ' . The roads between Guzar and Shirabad and between Hissar and Shirabad have been put in a good state of repair by order of the Bokharan authorities. 297. Projected railways.—Tha inter-departmental committee, convened by the Minister for Ways of Communication, for the purpose of working out a scheme of railway survey work for the three years, 1915 to 1917 inclusive, has resolved that economic surveys should be undertaken in 1915 for the lines (1) From Charjui to Alexandrof Gai, ind Khiva (1,800 versts, 1,188 miles), and (2) From Semipalatinsk to Vyerni, with a branch line to the Jungar Gates (1,050 versts, 693 miles). 298.

Dr. Morozoff will have local charge of Russian interests at Sistan during the hot weather. General. The Revenue Department in Birjand and Sistan. —Great friction has arisen between the two Directors, Mirza Ismail Khan and Ibtihaj-us-Sultan, owing, apparently, to the Treasurer-General not having properly defined the extent of each man’s powers. Mirza Ismail Khan seems to call himself “ Provincial Inspector ” vide Meshed Diary No. 10, while Ibtihaj-us-Sultan signs himself “ Provincial Controller ” when writing to me. Probably neither man really has any authority over the other, though possibly the official at Birjand, the seat of the Governor, can make his power be felt further especially when dealing with the question of payments of officials’ salaries. Mirza Ismali Khan seems to have been greatly offended at the receipt soon after his arrival of a letter from Ibtihaj-us-Sultan instructing him how to deal with some Revenue case affecting a Kainat village. This letter was probably really meant for his stop-gap predecessor, but it was addressed to the Director of Revenues, Birjand. He responded a few days later, by cutting Ibtihaj-us-Sultan’s house-rent allowance of 6 Tomans a month from the date of his arrival in Sistan! Acrimonious correspondence ensued which culminated m Mirza Ismail speaking insultingly of Ibtihaj-us-Sultan in the house of Mr. Vice-Consul New, and in the hearing of Prince Mahomed Taki Mirza, brother of Ibtihaj-us-Sultan and hanger-on (for the last two years) of the Governor Shaukat-ul-Mulk. As the latter was anxious to have Mahomed Taki Mirza appointed Inspector of the Military Forces— he had been Military Commandant in Birjand until Nasir-us-Saltaneh abolished his appointment—the Governor is now unfortunately involved in the discord, which perhaps will terminate in the resignation of Mirza Ismail Khan. His Majesty’s Minister has informed me that he always regarded the Mirza as a self-opinionated truculent person, and that he was at a loss to understand why Shaukat-ul-Mulk wished to have him at Birjand. From our point of view the man is of no use, as he has shown no inclination ever to consult Mr. New as regards his work and difficulties. Baluch Raids. —(a) It was reported early in the week that a band of SOO Baluchis had arrived within one day’s ride of Neh. Subsequent news however is to the effect that the Baluchis number under 100, and that their leaders are Haji Gulab (see Diary No. 12) and one Said Khan. Nothing is known of the present whereabouts of Mir Jehmd who was reported from Dehaneh Bagheh to be near Nasratabad Sipeh with a lashkar on the 19th April. (6) On the 25th April, Mr. Gabler. Inspector 7th Sub-section, Dahaneh Bagheh, reported that his own riding camel had been carried ofi by the notorious Aibu (see Diary No. 4) and as his Sowars were able to retaliate against Aibu s brother, a possibility of trouble exists in that quarter It is significant that Aibu s brother claimed to be under the protection of Sardar rur i an. I shall have an opportunity of speaking to the Sardar on this subject m a day or two, as he is coming into Sistan. (c) From Lutak I alltheBrahui owners seem to be the most hear that the grazing on the hills is giving out, and that of flocks are coming down to the Shela. The present would opportune time of the year for putting pressure on the2 relations of the Shela raiders, if only the organization of our forces was more advanced.

Telegraphic intimation has been received from the Minister of Interior that Nayyir-ud-Daulah is confirmed in the Government of Khurasan for the ensuing See diary for the week ending March 7th. I’tisam-ul-Mulk, ex-Karguzar of Sarakhs, where he served for over fourteen years, arrived in Meshed about a fort night ago and called on me yesterday. See last week’s diary. The Mutawalli Bashi gave the permanent officials of the Shrine as his authority for the false statement which he published regarding the picture recently restored to the Shrine. The permanent officials are much an noyed with him and are said to be about to petition for his dismissal. The Governor of Nishapur is protesting against the appointment of Mirza Abdullah Khan of the Revenue Department as Karguzar of Nishapur. See diary for the week ending March 14th. The Governor-General is said to have got hold of a letter in which Fath-ul-Mulk instigated the recent agitation against Iqtidar-ul-Mulk, Governor of Kalat-i-Nadiri. He has released Fath-uh Mulk’s brother, Bihbud Khan, after relieving him of 250 tumans, on condition that he produces his brother within ten days. Persian Affairs. Instructions have been received from Tehran that all Khalsa lands in the possession of Aghazada should be resumed and 3,000 tumans a year paid to Agha- zada as compensation. The Aghazada has bribed Mirza Ismail Khan, interpreter to the Revenue Department here, and Mirza Ismail Khan has persuaded Mr. Collard to advocate the retention of the lands by the Aghazada. The source of the persistent rumours to the effect that the ex-Shah intends to make another attempt to recover his throne appears to be letters from Talib-ul- Haqq to one of his relatives in Meshed. Talib-ul-Haqq, who is a supporter of the ex-Shah, did much to bring about the bombardment of the Shrine and was after wards deported to Russia and went to Karbala. He draws a monthly allowance of 25 roubles from the Russian Government. i Russian Affairs. I hear that the Russian Minister in Tehran has directed my colleague to see ! that Abdul Hamid, dragoman of the Russian Consulate-General here, leaves Meshed within ten days, after depositing 10,000 roubles as a security for claims against him. I hope that the news is true and that the order will be obeyed, but many such orders have already been issued and disregarded. The truth seems to be that Abdul Hamid has acquired means sufficient to enable him to bribe almost any Russian official. &gt; I recently issued to British subjects, sending a copy to the Karguzar, a notice to the effect that I would not take up intiqal cases, that is to say, cases in which British subjects take over from Persian subjects, for a consideration, doubtful or contested claims in order that they may be pressed, by the Consul-Generars influence. My colleague, in the temporary absence of his assistant and son-in-law, M. Romanovski, imitated my action, and M. Romanovski on his return was much annoyed with his father-in-law, for he has found such cases very profitable. British Affairs. Captain Thorburn, Assistant to the Consul-General, and Major Marsh, Military Attache at Meshed, left Meshed on Friday, March 27th, for a tour down the Kashaf Rud to Zulfiqar. I expect them back on April 7th. INDIA, F0Rr ,r 'l No 18 ..', &lt;^ ed . ! I ’ I ‘ i I I I; it i pi!! 11 f II mmHerat News. The troops are out of hand and are committing many robberies in the town. The Brigadier and the Governor are each attempting to transfer the task on in quiring into and punishing these thefts to the other. The leading men of every quarter in the town and the shopkeepers have been ordered to provide watchmen at night. Kariz News. The Russian officer who styled himself Sikandar Khan, and is now at Kariz has apparently changed his designation to Sharif Khan. The Karguzar of Turbat-i-Haidari has returned to that place from Kariz. -- Political Summary. Condition of country. —The country generally is quiet. Condition of roads. —Seven armed men have deserted from the service of Rais- ut-Tujjar who probably no longer has the means of paying them and are robbing travellers on the Chinaran Road. The Governor-General. —Nayyir-ud-Daulah remains on excellent terms with me, and I am glad that he has been confirmed in his appointment for the ensuing year. Prince Dabija, I believe, does not share my sentiments. ® T. W. HAIG, Lieut.-Colonel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General in Khorasan. 0 ' Fksb ’ Simla—N o. C-69 F.D.-30.4.I4._27._ 27.—C. W.

The Kras- novodsk District Commandant has applied that this period shall be increased and that Russian subjects, who have settled in the Persian province of Astarabad, shall be allowed to cross the frontier on the authority of the Russian passports in their possession. A commission is considering both questions. 235. Climate, Trans-Caspia.—A slight shock of earthquake was felt in Tashkent, at 8-32 a.m., 24th February. The tremour ran from south to north. 236. Climate, Khorascm.—Eight inches of snow fell at Meshed, 16th March, and winter conditions, which had ceased for the preceding 3 weeks, again set in! 237. Emigration mowmewfe.—Between 1st January and 13th February 1914, 7,244 immigrants entered Siberia by train and 4,141 on foot, while 3,099 emigrants left Siberia by train and 2,823 on foot. . Some settlers have arrived at Tashkent from Akmolinsk, in order to ascer tain the conditions of life in Astarabad and Northern Persia. 238. Colonization of Golodnaya Nteppe.—Certain tracts in the Famine Steppe are being reserved for the settlement of Semirechia Cossacks. 239. Irrigation, Te]end Oasis. —The substitution of a new stone waste-weir, on the river Tejend, for the present native-made dam, at Koribent, will increase the extent of irrigated land below the weir and the well-being of the local native agriculturists. The cost, £ 2,660, will be met either from the funds at the disposal of the principal Department for Agriculture or by means of a loan to the native population from the capital of the zemskoi treasury. 240. Irrigation, river Murghab. —The Murghab Water Committee, which is deciding the disputed question of the right to use the waters of the Murghab, is composed of an equal number of representatives of the administration and of the population of Merv District on the one hand and of the Murgha[&gt; Estate on the other. A representative of the Department for Agriculture is to be appointed in a consultative capacity. 241. Trade. —Russian Turkistan, in general, and the province of Ferghana, m particular, is passing through an economic crisis, the symptoms of which are stagnation in trade and a series of bankruptcy failures. The situation has been created by the boom in the cultivation of cotton to the detriment of that of wheat and other cereals. The yearly cotton crop of Ferghana has increased, during the last five years, from an output of 70,000 tons to one of 1,500,000 tons. The price, obtained for the raw material, in 1913, was higher, by 4s. 3d. per cud (36 lbs.) than in 1912. The cotton industry would appear to be in a prosperous condi tion. But the cost of the flour, used for local consumption has increased, owing to the gradual decrease of local wheat cultivation, the population has not increas ed proportionately to the area of fresh land brought under cotton cultivation, History. 234.

In 1912, 9,087 tons of common lake salt were produced as against 12,138 in 1911. Several lakes in Sir Darya were not exploited at all, owing to the fact that no tenders were made for the contracts. 243. Agriculture.—In the Golodnaya Steppe, irrigated by the recently opened Komanovski canal, it has been discovered that large tracts of land, amounting to some 32,500 acres, are saline and unfit for cultivation unless a large sum be spent on further irrigation. Military. 244. Movements of troops. —A company of recruits, 12th Turkistan Rifle Regiment, arrived at Samarkand from Tashkent, 3rd March. Forts, Posts, Etc. 245. Between Takhta Bazaar and Chehil Dukhteran (reference paragraph 583) two frontier guard posts have been built recently, at intervals of about 16 miles ; that nearest Chehil Dukhteran is not yet completed. A new guard post has also been constructed at a distance of 24 miles from Takhta Bazaar, on the Kerki road, which has been put in repair for a width of 12 feet. The garrison of this post was reported, on 28th February, to consist of 150 men, 1st Caucasus Cossack Regiment ; and 200 men of the Frontier Guards. Administration. 246. “ Reinforced protection.” —Between 15th December 1913, and 15th January 1914, 79 Russiajs, 1 Chinaman and 1 Persian were expelled from Tashkent, on the grounds of having no definite occupation or domicile and for illiteracy. Communications. 247. Railway troops .— The Russian War Office proposes to open a special school for the instruction of officers in the construction and working of railways and to employ the graduates as specialists in railway work and with railway troops. 248. Tashkent Railway. —A goods train arrived at Kargala, on 20th February, minus 37 wagons. A search was instituted and the missing wagons were found at verst 326. 249. Oxus Railway .— Engineer Stefanits, titular councillor, of the Department for Ways of Communications, has been appointed substitutive Chief Engineer of the Oxus Railway; he will complete his tenure of the appointment on 15th January 1917. Engineer Smirnof, of the same Department, has been detailed for construc tion work on the line. The Russian workmen, employed at Kelif, on the preliminary survey in the thii d section of the line, recently struck work and have been paid off. (Press, 10th March.) Some 10,000 workmen have been engaged at Karshi, at the rate of 2 roubles a day ; it is said that they are to commence work on the 22nd March, the beginning of the local Xew Y ear. The water supply of Karshi,Avhich is derived from springs at Kitab and Shahr-i-Sabz, is being improved. Automobiles, running between Karshi and Bokhara, usually accomplish the journey m 3| hours. , . ie Bokhara is evincing great interest in the progress of the con- s rue ion o le line. He is reported to be using forced labour, in the neighbour- f 1 ] 00 ! ° f ,° v ordorcing the payment of a fine, in lieu of labour, from lose o is su jec s, w ho are not actually employed on construction work.The prospect of more profitable employment on this and on the Semirechia railway is inducing large numbers of the employees of the Tashkent and Central Asian Railways, clerks and manual labourers alike, to leave their present work. The movement is likely to embarass the managements of the latter lines to a considerable extent. The wages of employees on a line under construction are higher than those which obtain on a working line and a cash bonus is usually paid on the completion of the construction. 250. Projected Khiva Railway. —The Khan of Khiva is placing obstructions in the way of the construction of the Khiva line and has sent a representative to Petersburgh, with a view to bringing about the negation of the scheme. 251. Semirechia Railway. —Permission has been granted to the Semirechia Rail way Company to issue 4| per cent, stock, guaranteed by Government, to the amount of 45,684,000 roubles (£486,000). It is reported from Petersburgh that M. A.S. Diedulof, Chief Engineer on con struction work and his two assistants, have resigned their appointments. Their resignations will seriously delay the commencement of work. The appointment of Chief Engineer has been offered to Engineer Petrof, a relative of the well-known Engineer-General Petrof; in the event of his refusal, the appointment * will be offered to Military Engineer Ivanof, a relative of the late Governor-General of Turkistan. 252. Projected JJfa-Orenburg Railway. —The Committee for New Railway Con struction have decided unanimously in favour of granting permission to arrange for the construction of the Ufa-Orenburg Railway, which was applied for by a merchant, named M. N. V. Mieskof. 253. Altai Railway. —The Altai Railway Company, which is constructing the line to Barnaul, has applied for permission to build a railway from Vyerni to Semi- palatinsk. Goods traffic is now running on the section, Semipalatinsk-Lokot, a distance of 200 versts (132 miles.) F. G. MARSH, Major, Military Attache, Meshed.SECRET.

Russians in N. Persia.—The Russian Consular Agent at Darreh tiaz, on the frontier between Kalat-i-Nadiri and Gaudan, has given his daughter in marriage to the brother of a local Khan, a fact which operates to the detriment of the proper care of Russian interests in the neighbourhood. (Askhabad 17th March). ’ ! I 259. Russian policy in Persia.—The following statements were elicited by the editor of the newspaper “ Rad ” in an interview with the new Russian Ambassa dor in Tehran:— (a) Trans-Persian Railway. Negotiations as to the construction of the line are still proceeding between the Russian and British Govern ments ; Russia wishes for the alignment; Astara-Yezd-Indian fron tier, Great Britain desires that of Astara-Ispahan-Bushire-Indian frontier. (6) Gendarmerie. Russia considers that the gendarmerie should confine their operations to securing the safety of the roads throughout the country and should not play the part of an active army. (c) Russian troops. Russia is withdrawing troops on account of the expense (5,000,000 roubles a year) of maintaining them in Persia. Russia will support Shuja-ud-Dowleh, Governor of Azerbaijan, who has succeeded in restoring order in that province. (d) Russian settlers in N. Persia. There is no cause for alarm in the increasing immigration of Russian settlers into Persia ; the movement has no political significance. (e) The ex-Shah Muhammad Ali recently applied at Petersburg for Rus sian help in a fresh attempt to recover his throne by force of arms ; this was emphatically refused.

(CONFIDENTIAL. 'magti. to ir' is®- )j tli Sistan and Kain Consulate Diary No. IS, for the week ending the 11 th April 1914. 5lh April.—The Russian Vice-Consul, Colonel Vygornitzky, accompanied by a telegraphist, his Persian Mirza and 5 Cossacks, left on a short tour in the district. He intends visiting the Bund-i-Sistan and other places of interest and to return to Sistan by the end of the week. Uth A pril.—Colonel Vygornitzky has returned to Sistan. He was the guest for one night of Sardar Pasand Khan, father of the Ghulam Bashi of the Russian Vice-Consulate He included }VarmaI, Sekoha, Khwaja Ahmad, Bund-i-Sistan and the rums ot /akidan m his itinerary. Khan Sahib Mirza Muhammad Beg, Sub-Assistant Surgeon, left Birjand He is proceedmg on leave. His successor, Mirza Mumtaz Ali Khan, is en route to Sistan. General. The Governor of Sistan and Earn. -Much surprise is felt in Birjand that the Sardars and land-owners of Sistan have not, as yet, taken any steps to pay their respects to Shaukat-ul-Mulk, as is the custom. From enquiries it is variously stated to be due to — (1) no official intimation having been received from him that he has been made Governor of the two provinces; (2) the change in the financial administration. Since the establishment of the Revenue Department on its present basis they have transferred the greater part of their allegiance to and court the good offices of the local head of that Department and his more important subordi nates ; (3) the fact that many of them are partisans of Hashmat-ul-Mulk and resent what they consider an outsider usurping his place. They still hope to see Hashmat-ul-Mulk back in Sistan ; (4) the fear of punishment for their complicity with the Baluch raiders. The alliance lately entered into by the old enemies Sardars Purdil and Khuda- dad Khan (see last week’s diary), has probably a certain anti-Shaukat pro-Hashmat significance. A rumour appears to have reached the Sarhad that His Excellency Shaukat-ul- Mulk intends to send a force, in co-operation with the Kerman Gendarmerie and Sardar Said Khan of Bampur, to operate against the Baluchi raiders who live in that region. It is said that Mir Jehind and Taj Mohammed Reqi instead of waiting to be attacked in their own country have announced their intention of marching in the direction of Neh and engaging the Shaukat’s forces in the open field ! The Finance Department in Sistan. —Mubashar-ul-Mulk left Sistan on the 8th instant. Only a small party of Mirzas went out with him. He has been relieved by Muhammad Wali Mirza from Koh Malik Siah. Before his departure Mubashar-ul-Mulk made an effort to obtain a testimonial from the Deputy Governor and the Chief Mujtehid besides smaller fry. It is stated that Sartip Mohammed Reza Khan agreed to write in the same sense as Mullah Mehdi had done, but as this was by no means complimentary the offer was declined. The Finance Department in Birjand. —His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk issued a notice to the effect that all opium must be declared and handed over to the Revenue Department within four days, and that all opium discovered after this period had expired would be confiscated and the owners severely punished. Several seizures have already been made, and one owner has been flogged and, in addition, fined tomans 130. 1 :t 2 The public of Birjand are somewhat disturbed at what they consider the severity of punishment. They complain that the “ Shira ” prepared by the Department is adulterated. The Military Forces in Sistan.—The Deputy Governor of Sistan has wired to Shaukat-ul-Mulk complaining that the local troops have not received their pay for the past 12 months. Shaukat-ul-Mulk has referred the matter to Tehran. Recruiting of the camel-sowars for Sistan mentioned in my last diary is in full swing. The number, I understand, has been increased to 60. Thirty of these will be distributed at various points along the Trade Route from Koh Malik Siah to Hauz-i-nimeh—half way between Lab-i-Garing and Randan—and the remainder will be kept in Sistan for further training. Travellers in Persia. —Dr. Pugin, a German, accompanied by a German clerk and an Armenian merchant of Turbat-i-Haidari, has arrived in Birjand by motor car. His object is to introduce German aniline dyes to the carpet weavers in Bir- j a nd and Kerman. He leaves for the latter place in about 10 days. Boluch Raids. —(a) It is reported from Dehaneh Baghi and confirmed by the Political Agent, Chagai, that another raid on Narmashir is impending, but that owing to differences which have arisen over the sharing of the proceeds of the last raid, the start is likely to be delayed for some time. (6) A raid, in which 20 camels belonging to the Bahloli tiite were canied off, was committed at Lab-i-Baring some days ago. The culprits are unknown, but are said to be Baluchis including Juma and Idoo Khan of Alam Khan’s tribe. Afghan raids. —A caravan of 8 pilgrims, proceeding to Meshed, was attacked at a spot midway between Lab-i-Baring and Bandan by a band of 40 Afghan rob bers of the AH Mazar tribe. One pilgrim was killed and 4 are supposed to have been carried off by the robbers together with belongings of the party valued at 300 to mans. f Thirty sowars from Sistan followed the trail of the robbers as far as the Afghan boundary and then returned. His Britannic Majesty's Consul’s tour. —Major F. B. Prideaux, C.I.E., left Lutak on the 30th March for the Perso-Afghan Boundary at Bund-i-Kuhak. From there he marched down the 81 miles of boundary to Koh Malik Siah where he arrived on the 7th instant. All the pillars were found in very good order. Major Prideaux is still at Koh Malik Siah but expects to leave for Sistan about the 16th instant. State of the weather. —A fair quantity of rain—for the time of the year—has fallen in the district and as far south as Koh Malik Siah. D.

See last week’s diary Sliaukat-us-Saltanah has paid to the Governor-General for the Government of Khaf 400 tumans m cash and has given a bond for 1 600 tumans. It has also been arranged that on arriving at Khaf he shall produce 100 sowars, bribe the local revenue official to produce two years’ arrears of pay or them and out of the proceeds pay 3,000 tumans to the Commander of the Troops at Meshed. See diary for the week ending February 28th. The case against Haji Abbas Kazam Deputy Governor of Rizwan (Mian-i-Wilayat) is that while a man was being beaten by his orders a bystander expressed sympathy with the victim Haji Abbas ordered the man to be ripped open and his servants obeved the order. J Shaukat-us-Saltanah has received detailed instructions regarding the brigands who live on the border near Khaf and loot indiscriminately in Persia and Afghanistan, taking refuge m either country as it suits them. He is to trv to arrange with the Afghan authorities that these moss-troopers shall be removed into Afghanistan and settled at a distance from the border, or that, failing this they shall be compelled to settle in Persia at a distance from the border. Persian Affairs. See diary for the week ending February 21st. Nasir, who recently attempt ed to outwit M. deGraves of Kuchan and was himself outwitted by Muhammad Khan of the Kuchan Gendarmerie, lately plundered two travellers near Chinaran and robbed them of their horses. Sowars sent by the Governor of Chinaran pur sued him into the hills and recovered the horses, but Nasir escaped. The governor who excuses himself on the ground that he had no orders to shoot Nasir, has been ordered to send in pursuit of him and either kill or capture him. The Barbarlclaim rent from the villagers of Persian Chacha and Durband and are threatening to collect it by force. The Turkomans of Russian Chacha have offered their assistance against the Barbaris, but Mirza Sawad Khan, Customs Officer at Persian Chacha, has so far been successful in keeping the peace. Complaints continue to be received of the conduct of officials in the Revenue Department. A man against whom the Superintendent of the Revenue in Daragaz had claims was recently imprisoned and died in prison within twenty- four hours. Russian Affairs. See last week's diary. The Russian Consul-General has succeeded in getting the Mutawali Bashi to publish in the Naubahar a statement to the effect that the picture recently restored to the shrine has not been in the shrine within the last few years. The circumstances of the publication of this statement are well known and the Mutawali Bashi is still further discredited in the eyes of the public. See last week's diary. The arrangement between Rais-ut-Tujjar and the Russian Bank regarding the concession for the maintenance of the road was that Rais-ut-Tujjar should persuade the Persian Government to cancel the condition that the concession was not transferable to a foreigner, and should transfer the concession to the Bank. In the event of his failing to do this he was to pay an additional sum of 25,000 tumans to the Bank as compensation for the trouble and expense to which it would be put in arranging with the Russian and Persian Governments for the transfer. Rais-ut-Tujjar has not succeeded in getting the condition cancelled and the Bank now calculates his debt at 406,000 tumans, bearing interest at 10 per cent. The Russian Consul-General officially requested the Karguzar to recover this sum and the Karguzar advertised Rais-ut-Tujjar's property for sale, as reported last week. Either Prince Dabija or the Russian Bank has sent a message to Rais-ut-Tujjar threatening him with imprisonment kG. M. Press, Simla.—No. C-46 F. D.- 22-4-14.—28 —B.A. 2 unless he transfers the concession, but the Karguzar has received orders to find an opportunity of reminding the Russian Consul-General and the Manager of the Russian Bank that the concession is not transferable to a foreigner. Mv Colleague blames the Governor-General and the Karguzar for not having prevented Shaukat-ul-Mulk from bringing to Meshed the picture which has been restored to the Shrine and told the Karguzar that owing to the excitement which the exhibition of the picture had caused he would be obliged to send for more troops. Prince Dabija and the Manager of the Russian Bank are said to be endeavouring to obtain a concession for a road fit for motor traffic from Dushakh to Meshed. The Governor-General complains that he asked five years ago for a concession for this road, but the Persian Government would not give it to him and now it will prob ably fall into the hands of the Russians. He says that the Russians intend to make a road fit for motor traffic to Turbat-i-Haidari. My Colleague is endeavouring to collect something for his travelling expenses on leaving Meshed. He is prepared to advocate the dismissal of A'dal-ud-Haulah, Governor of Kuchan and the appointment of Shuja-ud-Daulah, now in Tehran, on receiving 3,000 tumans from the latter. Shuja-ud-Daulah is prepared to pay for the post, but knows that Prince Dabija is shortly leaving Meshed and fears that he may pocket the money and leave without doing anything, for he is not to be trusted. A’dal-ud-Daulah is a rogue and a partner of robbers, but he recently paid Prince Dabija for the appointment of Kuchan, and has done his best for the Russians. Prince Dabija is said to have received and to have shown to those concerned a telegram from St. Petersburg thanking those who recently signed a paper protest ing against the withdrawal of Russian troops from Khurasan, see diary for the week ending January 10th. Three Russian soldiers who were shooting in the direction of the Kashaf Rud recently robbed a traveller named Meshhedi Rajab of six hundred roubles, a revolv er, and a 'pustin. Fortunately the man, a Caucasian Turk, is a Russian subject. Herat News. The Governor has issued orders to all frontier officials to be on the look-out for the Russian officer travelling under the name of Sikandar Khan, who is suspected of the intention of entering Afghanistan. The Governor with the sanction of the Amir has now begun to correspond direct with the Governor of Ashkabad. See last week’s diary. The regiment which mutinied at Farah is said to have been restrained with difficulty from marching to Chakansur and imprisoning Brigadier Ghulam Muhammad Khan. The troops at Mazar-i-Sharif are reported to be on the verge of mutiny. Kariz News. The Russian officer travelling under the name of Sikandar Khan has arrived in Kariz with his wife. Turbat-i-Haidari News. See last week’s diary. Although Shaukat-ul-Mulk was not met by any repre sentative of the Russian Consulate he exchanged visits with the Consul, the latter making the first call. • Political Summary. Condition of country. —Prospects of a disturbance at Persian Chacha have already been mentioned. Otherwise the country appears to be quiet. Condition of roads. —The activity of Nasir near Chinaran has already been mentioned. A party of Persian travellers going to Turshiz was robbed at a distance of one farsakh from Turbat-i-Haidari. T.

He travels via Nushki and Karachi. General. The Military Forces of Sistan and Kain .—See Diary No. 13. I hear from - Birjand that a supplementary Ministerial Decree has been issued from Tehran reducing the number of soldiers and horsemen from 800 to 700, and 264 to 250, respectively, and increasing the number of artillerymen from 50 to 58. His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk intends recruiting 150 horsemen and 50 camel-sowars in Sistan and the remainder in the Kainat. The Deputy Governor of Sistan .—Sartip Muhammad Reza Khan is experiencing some difficulty with the Revenue Department regarding his pay as a Colonel of the Persian Army. He claims Tomans 40 and a quantity of fodder per mensem, but Ibtihaj-us- Sultan—Director of Revenue—refuses to pay, on the grounds that the Sartip cannot draw pay as a Military Officer, while at the same time receiving pay as a Deputy Governor. The matter has no doubt been referred to Tehran for settlement. The Sardars of Sistan .—In Diary No. 12 a reference was made to the effect that Sardars Khudadad Khan, Naroi, and Purdil Khan, Sarbandi, were contem plating patching up their quarrel bty an exchange of ladies in marriage, and that the Deputy Governor of Sistan had written trying to dissuade them from this step until Shaukat-ul-Mulk had been consulted. I now hear that the daughter of Sardar Purdil Khan has since been married to the son of Sardar Khudadad Khan and that the alliance has been still further strengthened by the betrothal of Khudad Khan's sister to the younger son of Purdil Khan. The Finance Department in Sistan. —Mubashar-ul-Mulk has at last received peremptory orders to leave Sistan at once. He will take his departure in two or three days. A list of cases against this man has already been sent to Tehran by Ibtihaj- us-Sultan, and it is to be hoped that he will there get his reward. The Karguzari, Sistan—The pay and allowances of the Karguzar and his assist ant has been increased from Tomans 155 to 170 and Tomans 40 to 53, respect ively. Baluch Raids.—(a) The notorious raiders Iddo Khan, Juma Khan and Shah Nazar Khan, Brahuis, accompanied by 100 men, have left their homes for the Kainat on a raiding expedition.

Under telegraphic orders from the Minister of Foreign Affairs Ftisam-ul- Mulk, Karguzar at Sarakhs, has been dismissed and pending the appointment of his successor the duties of the Karguzar are to be carried on by AshjV-ul-Mulk, Governor of Sarakhs. Iqtidar-ul-Mulk, Governor of Kalat-i-Nadiri, who is said to have wrung about 15,000 tomans from the people of his district recently proposed to visit Meshed but the people closed the road against him at Darband, an appropriate spot. Iqtidar-ul-Mulk has telegraphed to his uncle, Nayyir-ud-Daulah, attributing their action to the intrigues of Fath-ul-Mulk, the late Governor of Kalat, and Nayyir-ul- Daulah is said to be about to use the accusation as a means of extorting money from Fath-ul-Mulk. Shaukat-ul-Mulk, Governor of Sistan and the Qainat/and Mirza Ismail Khan, Provincial Inspector of Kevenues, left Meshed en route for their destinations on the afternoon of March 5th. The Chief of Bujnurd is said to have telegraphed to Tehran offering to accept responsibility for the safety of Tehran-Meshed road if Shahrud and Sabzawar are placed under the administration of Bujnurd. Mansur-ul-Mamalik, Governor of Nardin, has been summoned to Meshed. I trust it is not on any complaint of the Russian Consul-General’s, who does not fin d him sufficiently pliant. Persian Affairs. See diary for the week ending February 14th. SattanKhan left Meshed for Kakhka yesterday having received some money for Ins travelling expenses from the Governor-General and some more from Prince Dabija. Complaints of the high-handedness of the revenue gendarmerie continue to be received. In Daragaz they have flogged and imprisoned cloth merchant, from whom they demanded 200 tomans. Bihbud Khan the prisoner who headed those who escaped from prison in Daragaz (see last weeks diary) has been cap tured by Kurds and sent back to Daragaz, where he is being suitably dealt with..

The Eussians are not mentioned by name but there is an unmistakable reference to “ those who, wearing their boots, disrespectfully en tered a place so holy that 'Isa bii± Mmyam would not have entered it without permission The article, as might have been expected, has given great offence, and my colleague has demanded the suppression of the paper and the imprisonment of the editor, threatening, in the event of his demands not meeting with compli ance, to bring more Eussian troops to Meshed. It is believed in Meshed that the Eussians are trying to separate the districts of Kuchan, Daragaz and Kalat-i-Nadiri from the government of Khorasan and to have them placed under a governor directly responsible to Tehran. This step, which might have unfortunate results, is supposed to be a counterblast to the recent separation of Sistan and the Qainat from Khorasan. Shuja-ud-Daulah and Mirza Mas’ud Khan, Governor of Daragaz, are said to be competing in Tehran, by the usual methods, for the new post, and Shuja-ud-Daulah has sent for 4,000 tomans, and has attempted to enlist my interest on his behalf. A recent case has unfortunately given my colleague another opportunity of interfering in the affairs of the Barbaris. A Barbari youth who was carried off by Eussian Turkomans some years ago recently returned to Persia with a Tur koman girl and was charged by the Turkomans with abduction. Sayyid Ahmad Ali Shah, chief of one section of the Barbaris, was selected by Prince Dabija as the person against whom to press the case and he has been compelled to surrender the girl and pay compensation amounting to 400 roubles. He has also been dis placed from the chiefship of his branch of the Barbaris in favour of Sayyid Azim Shah who is a tool in the hand of Haji Hussain Aga, who is virtually a Eussian agent.

Persian Officials. ConBuf S en“dytlir^ ellreCeiVed but the Russian Shaukat-us-Saltaneh Taimuri has been appointed Governor of Khaf He is well disposed towards us. The elders and mullas of Nardin are at Shahrud and are protesting vigorously against the orders directing Mansur-ul-Mamalik to come to Meshhed They say that if he leaves Nardm the place will probably be plundered by the Turkomans. The Chief of Bujnurd, who desires to get the governorship of Nardin into his own hands, is said to be working for the dismissal of Mansur-ul-Mamalik. The Governor-General has telegraphed to his nephew, Iqtidar-ul-Mulk, Gov ernor of Kalat-i-Nadiri, informing him that he will not be removed from his appointment at the Nauruz. The Governor-General accuses Fath-ul-Mulk of fomenting discontent against Iqtidar-ul-Mulk and by means of this accusation is attempting to extort money from Fath-ul-Mulk, who is in hiding, one of his brothers has been arrested. Persian Affairs. The Governor-General and the Karguzar have decided to take no steps against the Tus newspaper unless Prince Dabija puts his demands in writing. Complaints continue to be received from various quarters of the oppressive conduct of the revenue gendarmes. I fear that the cause of complaint will not be removed until Khurasan has a properly disciplined force under Swedish officers. Sayyid Ahmad Ali Shah's place as chief of one section of the Barbaris has been filled by Agha Sayyid Husain Hakimabadi and not by Sayyid Azim Shah, as reported last week. Sayyid Husain is a quiet and peaceable man who has no dealings with the Russians. I am informed, however, that Sayyid Ahmad Ali Shah's removal is only temporary. Russian Affairs. The restoration of the picture which was stolen from the shrine at the time | of the bombardment (see last week's diary) has much annoyed my colleague, who says, I believe, that Shaukat-ul-Mulk himself bought and presented the picture to the shrine and that the picture was recently painted in India, and has lately been attempting to establish the fact that the picture was stolen from the shrine many years ago. He has sought the intervention of the Karguzar, but the Kar guzar has declined to interfere in the affairs of the shrine. Lastly he brought pres sure to bear on the Mutawalli Bashi and demanded from him a written document, for publication in a local newspaper, to the efiect that the picture never belonged to the shrine, or that it was stolen many years ago. By my advice the Mutawalli Bashi, to whom I promised my support, demanded a. written request from Prince Dabija, but eventually gave way and sent to the Russian Consulate-General such a paper as had been demanded. I have received a copy of this paper in which the Mutawalli Bashi says that no such picture has belonged to the shrine during the last hundred years. I do not know whether Prince Dabija will be foolish enough to publish it. If he does its publication will do little good either to him or to Mutawalli Bashi. The latter has already been sufficiently discredited by the quittance which he gave to the Russians when they left the shrine, and the public of Meshhed are sufficiently intelligent to know that “ Qui s’excuse s' accuse The Police news-sheet publishes an announcement of the approaching sale of the property of the Rais-ut-Tujjar, who is heavily in debt to the Russian Bank. I am glad to see that the concession for the Meshhed-Ashkabad road does not appear in the list. j INDIA, FORE : T ED (V 2 v &gt;-v f-'o 16 . . 1 , d ried A /■ i. ..t. j.T'a.taargCTDara^ ■M IjWs.

This fact, combined with reports of the unusual energy with which training is being carried out among the infantry battalions in Russian Turkistan and of movement of detachments of Cossacks on the frontiers of Trans-Caspia, is responsible for the prevalence of the general impression among the Russian troops and native population of Turkistan that military operations are impendnig in the spring.

The immigrants, who are settled for the most part, in the valleys of the Atrek and Gurgen live in mud hovels and are decimated by malaria.

The gendaime, Mahomed Hassan, who made a false report as to the quantity of opium in the old Seyid’s possession, has been dismissed from his post without^pay.

A report reached Sistan from Dehaneh Baghi that Mir Jehind and Shah Sowar Khan had been killed during the fighting between their lashker and the forces of the Deputy Governor of Bam.

Mas’ud Khan, Governor of Daragaz, has gone to Ashkabad, ostensibly for medical treatment, but it is believed that he intends to go to Tehran. Mirza Ismail Khan, lately appointed Revenue Superintendent in Kainat, has arrived in Meshed from Tehran on his way to Birjand. He will await the arrival of Shaukat-ul-Mulk, Governor of Sistan, who is expected in a day or two, and will travel with him. Mirza Khalil Khan, the revenue official who has been causing trouble in Turbat-i-Haidri, has arrived in Meshed. He is said to have had a very friendly interview with the Russian Consul before leaving Turbat. Bihbud Khan, Deputy Governor of Shandiz, has been appointed Deputy Governor of Isgil and Daulatabad in addition. The Deputy Governor of Rkwan has killed a Persian subject and is sum moned to Meshed. Haji Husain Aga, the Russian protege who was recently appointed Governor of Chinaran, is said to be working welljtnd to be^active in arresting robbers. Shaukat-ul-Mulk, Governor of Sistan, arrived in Meshed from Tehran on February 26th and will call on me to-day. Persian Affairs. See last week’s diary. The Russian attempt to foment the trouble in Sabza- war has been frustrated by the action of the Governor-General, who has pardoned the rioters who took bast in the Telegraph Office. Thirty prisoners at Daragaz have broken out of prison after attacking and wounding the sentry who was placed over them. One has been wounded and recaptured, but the rest have escaped. Sowars have been sent in pursuit of them. The reactionaries in Meshed, after a meeting held at the house of Basharat- ud-Daulah, ex-Superintendent of Telegraphs, decided to telegraph to Tehran that there was nobody in Meshed fit for election to the Majlis and to suggest that two reactionaries residing in Tehran should be returned as Members for Khorasan. One Muhammad Yak-gush, suspected of murdering a Turkoman Russian subject on the Sarakhs frontier, has taken bast with the Governor of Persian Sarakhs. The Governor of Russian Sarakhs has threatened to send Cossacks to seize the man unless he is surrendered and the Governor of Persian Sarakhs has referred the matter to the Governor-General for orders. Some Sowars sent by the Governor of Turbat-i-Haidari to collect revenue from Baluchis complain that Salar Khan’s and Ibrahim Khan’s men attacked them and took from them the money which they had collected. M. Romanovsky complains that the Karguzar does not carry out his orders and has in consequence refused to attend meetings at the Karguzari. A local newspaper, the Nau-Bahar in its issue of February 24th, in the course of an article on the increasing use of morphine in Nishapur remarks that the opium department in Khorasan has frequently urged the Persian Government to control or suppress the trade in this mischievous drug but that nothing has been Russian Interests. British Interests.done, and makes the objectionable suggestion that the Imperial Bank of Persia is interested in the trade and that it is likely therefore that British influence brought to bear against its suppression. I am arranging to have a withdrawal and apology inserted in the paper. Travellers. Mr. B. B. Moore, an American gentleman travelling for pleasure, arrived in Meshed on February 25th and stayed with me. He left for Tehran this morning. See Diary No. 6 for the week ending February 14th, 1914. E. Lakon, the Hungarian Tom Coryate, has arrived at Nishapur and is going on to Sabzawar. Political Summary. The country is quiet and the roads are safe. The Governor-General, Nayyir- ud-Daulah, continues to work satisfactorily. He is opposing the suggestion of M. Collard that the inquiry into the conduct of the revenue officials at Turbat-i- Haidari should be secret. I am told that M. Romanovsky complains that I have formed a coalition consisting of the Governor-General, the Karguzar, and the Com mander of the Troops against Russian interests but the complaint, if it was made, is not likely to injure Nayyir-ud-Daulah, for Prince Dabija will probably remain here until after the Nauruz and his support has been purchased by the gift of a turquoise and diamond ring.

The movement recalls the historical action, taken by Prussia, previous to the annexation of the Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein. Geography. 177.

He received an enthusiastic reception, the number of people who went out to meet him being estimated at 8,000 or 10,000, including many women. Mr. New’s representative, Khan Sahib Mirza Mahomed Beg, Sub Assistant Surgeon was taken into His Excellency’s carriage, and when His Excellency nearer the town mounted his horse, the Khan Sahib was given the place of honour on his right. The Karguzar, who up to now has never been known to r ride a horse, went ) out in the Istiqbal, and unfortunately had previously fortified himself so much with arrack that he was quite unable to control his mount. The new Revenue Director Mirza Ismail Khan, was kicked on the ankle, and a temporary halt had to be called while our Doctor examined him, after which another Mirza was more badly injured by the same animal. The Karguzar’s bad language and rudeness to everyone near him did not improve matters. Hmam-ud-Dowleh .—See Diaries Nos. 8 and 10.

In mv opinion there is little to choose between the two Sardars for villainy, and it will be well if the Governor can teach both of them a lesson.

He has apparently been pardoned by the Amir. ^ (6) With reference to last week’s mention of the arrest of Commandant Muham- mad Ik-ahma Khan it is said that the Governor and Qazi of Farah are hostile to this Officer, while the Governor and Qazi of Chakhansur are favourably disnoserl to his uncle the Brigadier Sarhaddar. The last named has a good reputation m Sistan. The Farah troops have complained that both the Commandant and the Brigadier have embezzled large portions of their pay, amounting in all in 200,000 and 80,000 Krans respectively.

The telegram from the Regent announcing the date for the Shah’s coronation was read m Durbar by the Governors of Kuchan, Sabzawar and Turbat-i-Haidari. The gendarmes who were sent from Meshed to Turbat-i-Haidari at the instance of Muza Khalil Khan have returned to Meshed, and Haji Mukhtar Khan, the Baluch, with a few followers, arrived on the evening of February 16th. The nationalists are holding frequent secret meetings in connection with the approaching elections. Rais-ut-Tujjar and his brother Haji Malik, Jalal- us-Sultan, Haji Husain Aga, and Haji Mirza Ja’far, all Russian proteges, are trying to capture votes and are said to be receiving such assistance as my colleague can give them. The turquoise mines of Nishabur are said to have been leased to Malik-ut- Tujjar and the Governor-General is said to have issued orders that the new lessee is to be assisted in every way. It is reported that five pots of gold coins have been discovered in the ruins of Nishabur and have been sealed by the Governor and the Inspector of Revenue. The Governor-General has ordered that they are to be sent to Meshed. It is reported from Sabzawar that one Mirza Agah collected forty or fifty men and made a demonstration before the Governor’s house, demanding the dis missal of some officials accused of bribery. The men were dispersed and Mirza Agha fled, but some of his men have taken refuge in the Telegraph Office. The Governor, Haji Khazin-ul-Mulk, has asked the Governor-Genera for more sowars. He is a son-in-law of the Governor-General, and it is suspected that the demon stration was prompted by the revenue department. 'On the afternoon of February 19th some Persian artillerymen attacked a coffee-shop-keeper who was a dependent of Kardash Bala, a Russian subject and a notorious robber. Some of Kardash Bala’s men came to the rescue of the shop keeper and a riot might have ensued, but the Commander of the Troops, acting under the orders of the [Governor-General, arrested the disputants, flogged and imprisoned the artillerymen, and handed Kardash Bala’s men over to him. Some Persians have been detected in the systematic smuggling of arms into Meshed from Sarakhs. Russian Affairs, The Russian subject who murdered Mirza Ismail Khan, dragoman of the Russian Consulate at Turbat-i-Haidari, was one Mukhtar. The dragoman is said to have had improper relations with Mukhtar s wife and Mukhtar invited him to his house and stabbed him. Mukhtar is now under arrest in the Russian Consulate. See diaries for the weeks ending December 27th and January 31st. It is reported that Kadir Beg, the surveyor of the Russian Intelligence Department, has been killed by Afghans on his way from Herat to Kandahar, Herat News. The Revenue Collector of the Kal’a-yi-Nau district has been arrested by the Governor on complaints of extortion received from the people. Krans 10,000 have been recovered from him and returned to the people and the enquiry is proceeding. Persian Officials.

I The Customs officials at Bajgiran have arrested one Ivan Askmaroff, a cart- driver who was detected in an attempt to smuggle 4,980 pistol and shot gun cart ridges’ four revolvers, and several empty cartridge clips across the frontier into Persia’ His carts have been seized. This is said to be the first occasion on which the Customs officials have ventured to search and detain a Russian subject. The Belgian Revenue ofiicial at Kuchan has recently been disappointed of an expected addition to his emoluments. He employed in his Department one Nash, a dismissed gendarme and formerly an accomplice of the late robber Juju, in consideration of a promise from Nash that he would produce Juju’s hidden wealth and share it with him. Nash was sent off with an escort to Kahan and recovered 6,800 tomans which had been placed in deposit on Juju’s account, but while he was engaged in counting and packing the money Muhammad Khan, the commander of the gendarmes in Kuchan, appeared on the scene,^ having been sent after him by M. de Graves, who mistrusted Nash. Nash and his companions escaped with 800 tomans which they had packed and with the rifles with which they had been supplied, and Muhammad Khan and his companions, having divided among themselves the 6,000 tomans that had been left behind, returned to Kuchan and reported to M. de Graves that Nash had carried off everything, and if pursued would probably escape across the Russian frontier. Political Summary. Condition of Country. —On February 10th there was a disturbance in Khaf between the followers of A’zam-i-Sultan and Amir Abdullah. The quarrel began over a sheep and has no significance, but several persons have been wounded on both sides. The Governor of Sabzawar attempted to seize a robber named Karbalai Aga Baba, but on February 8th Aga Baba with a few friends fled from the town. They were pursued and, though Aga Baba was not caught, two of his friends were, and their ears were nailed to two of the gates of the town. The Chief of Bujnurd has not yet returned to the town, as the Turkomans are still threatening a raid. Condition of Roads. —I have no reports of robberies on the roads. Late News. A Russian officer and two Cossacks have left Kuchan via Bam and Safiabad for Sabzawar, for the purpose, it is suspected, of fomenting the disturbance there.

(Turkistan Gazette, 23rd January — 5th February.) 156. Turkoman Unrest. —A high official, probably the Governor ofTrans-Cas- pia, visited Merv, on 2nd February , and received a deputation of the leading Turko mans, to whom he made a conciliatory address and presented decorations.

He is accompanied bv the Revenue Director for that district, Mirza Ismail Khan. J The second wife of Hashmat-ul-Mulk died at Birjand on the 6th instant in child- birth. With reference to the mention made in Diary No. 8 of a telegram sent by the Russian Vice-Consul, Sistan, to Hissam-ud-Daula, Mr. Vice-Consul New has dis covered that Colonel Vygornitzky’s Tehran correspondent on the subject was Dr Kosminski, the Commercial Agent, who formerly served in Sistan. The Finance Department in Sistan.—Mhza Mubashshar-ul-Mulk has been working all the week quite unconcernedly and shows no/c^a of leaving Sistan. About the last yfficial action of Monsieur Paquet here was to telegraph to Tehran in conjunction with his successor, Ibtihaj-us-Sultan, praising Mubashshar-ul-Mulk's work and declaring that he had committed no fault. A number of petitions which have been submitted by Kadkhudas and others to Ibtihaj-us-Sultan against Mubash shar-ul-Mulk have been simply transferred by the new Director to the official complained against for disposal. It is apparent that Ibtihaj-us-Sultan is mortally afraid of M. Paquet, whose manner towards him in public has been extraordinarily over-bearing. Until Mobashshar-ul-Mulk goes, the chances of the Director working sincerely in amity with this Consulate are somewhat poor. I hear that M. Paquet has been telling his friends that a High Official in Belgium, belonging to the same Department as M. Mornard, is his near relation. In the course of a few months M. Mornard will have reason to regret his harshness towards M. Paquet. Finance Department in Kainat. —Mr. New reports that the collection of reve nue is proceeding so satisfactorily a!nd smoothly that all the 100 gendarmes in Kainat have been assembled at Birjand. There, having no work to do and to compensate themselves for the loss of free living to which they have become accustomed, the men have taken to committing highway robberies under arms. Two such crimes have been experienced in the environs of Bir j and. The culprits have been identified, but the local Acting Director and the Gendarmerie officers have declared their in ability to enforce any punishments. These 100 men are about to be relieved by a party which is accompanying Mirza Ismail Khan. As it is anticipated that they will give way to indiscriminate looting on the road to Meshed, I have suggested that the Messrs. Paquet should be put in charge of the force on the march. The form of punishment for inform ers which these ruffians seem to favour is poisoning or otherwise killling their horses. The outlaw, Naushirwan Khan .—I have no authentic news about^ this man’s present whereabouts. A secret messenger whom I sent into the Gurgs’ camp near India, Foreign SecretaiKhwaja Ahmed repors that Naushirwan went off accompanied by eight men tw of whom rode camels. He himself was on a horse. It is believed more generall° that the party have gone to Sar-i-Shela to pick up a consignment of arms which thev are expecting from Sarhad ; but, some still say that Naushirwan has gone to Quetta^ Yakub Khan, Sanjerani, sent word early in the week that he was seriously ill the symptoms being somewhat like those of pneumonia. His messenger, a Mulla’ did not, however, appear much concerned. He was given some medicine, and has not returned. Sistan Hospital figures for February 1914.

He hopes to enter Birjand on the 20th, where great preparations are being made for his recep tion. The Mustaufi, Mizbeh-ud-Diwan, who has been acting as Governor, has gone to Khidri, on the northern border of the district, to meet His Excellency. The Finance Department in Kainat. —Two fresh complaints of burglaries have been made against the Revenue gendarmes in Birjand. On M. Paquet’s arrival, he authorized the grant of a month’s pay to every man, and took bonds from the four officers for the good behaviour of their men on the road to Meshed. One troop under the best officer left Birjand on the 14th instant. The other three troops will accompany the Messrs. Paquet. The Finance Department in Sistan. —On the 12th instant I gave an unofficial dinner to the leading European and Persian officials. Ibtihaj-us-Sultan, the new Finance Director, sent a Mirza to me on the morning of the day to enquire where he would be seated. He said that in Birjand I had placed him after the Acting Governor and the Karguzar, and if he were not given the first place here he begged to be excused. I replied that I had already arranged with the Karguzar to give him the second place, but I certainly was not going to place him before the Deputy Gov ernor, whom I regarded as the Shah’s representative. If he did not like my decision, I was ready to refer to Tehran for a definite ruling. “ His Highness ” duly appeared. In one or two little matters during the week, the Prince has displayed an accommodating spirit. The outlaw, Naushirwan Khan. —This individual emerged from the Gaud-i- Zirreh desert and appeared in Mashki Chah, a Thana on the Nushki-Robat road, on the 9th instant *, a few hours later he had a satisfactory interview with Colonel Webb Ware, who happened to arrive there the same day, and then proceeded on his journey to Quetta. I have, on hearing the news, sent some pecuniary assistance to Naushirwan s uncle and family at Khwaja Ahmed. There is no doubt that Yakub Khan, Sanjerani, for some occult reason, has lately been dissuading Naushirwan from go ing to Quetta. Possibly he feared for his own skin, and did not see how to get out of accompanying Naushirwan. A Russian Spy.—It is rumoured that a Sistani—resident of Bunjar—has been arrested by the Afghan authorities of Farah on suspicion of being a spy for the Russians. The identity of the man is not known for certain, He is thought to be a tailor named Mirza Amir, who has already undergone a year s imprisonment in Farah about three years ago. .

Persian affairs .—The birthday of Muhammad is being celebrated, under instructions from Tehran, with greater ceremony than usual, and it is said that, during the celebrations, the official announcement of the arrangements for the coro nation of the Shah will be made. The gendarmes who were called in from Turbat-i-Haidari have arrived in Mesh ed and Haji Mukhtar Khan is expected daily. Sattar Khan (see diary for the week ending January 31st) has been living, since his arrival in Meshed, in the house of Saiyid Yahya, a British subject, where he receives visitors believed to be political intriguers. I have had Saiyid Yahya warned against his guest and he has promised to get rid of him within two days. I believe that the Chief of Police has ordered Sattar Khan to leave Meshed. Masud Khan, Governor of Chinaran and Daragaz, has been dismissed from the former appointment without prejudice to his tenure of the latter. Haji Hussain Aga, a Russian protege, is said to have been appointed Governor of China ran. Adl-ud-Daula, Governor of Kuchan, has written to M. Romanovski complain ing that he (Adl-ud-Daula) has lost 500 tomans, which lie gave as a bribe to Abdul Hamid, who promised to have Saiyid Hasan, Turbati, executed. Adl-ud-Daula says that he has no hope of getting his money back, but that he does not wish Abdul Hamid to benefit by it and M. Romanovski is at liberty to get the money from him and keep it for himself. It is reported that the police at Turshiz are without clothes and without money, having received no pay for two months. The Moderate Nationalists in Meshed are very active in view of the approaching elections. They are holding secret meetings and prospective candidates are showing much hospitality. They wish to limit the franchise to the inhabitants of the town of Meshed, thus excluding the landed interest, and to allow only a very short interval between the distribution and the return of the voting papers, in order that voters may have no time to trade in votes. Their objection to the representation of the landed interest is that some of its representatives are Russian proteges and some are proteges and nominees of the Governor-General. The birthday of Muhammad was celebrated with less ceremony than was expected, but salutes were fired and a durbar was held in the shrine, where a telegram from the Regent was read. It announced the early opening of a new Majlis and the coronation of the Young Shah, which is fixed for Sha ban 27th (July 21st). Russian affairs.— It is said that the Russian Foreign Office has ordered Abdul Hamid, the Attache, to be dismissed, and imprisoned for five years, or to pay a fine of 14 000 roubles. Abdul Hamid is said to have expressed his readiness to pay the fine and Prince Dabija is attempting to leave the execution of the orders to his successor. The Russian Consul-General, a few days ago, sent to the Karguzar two sum monses for Persian subjects issued by the Ashkabad Court, and demanded that the men who are residents of Kuchan, should be sent to Ashkabad, where their evidence is reauired The Karguzar very properly replied that Persian subjects are not am3e t the jurSon of a RuLJn (Yurt, and that if the evidence of the (men?) is required it should be taken on commission m uc ran. The Russian Consul-General has also demanded the surrender if a man in Meshed said to be a fugitive from Siberia. The Karguzar has refused to surrender the man who is, he says, a Persian subject. Mirza Ismail Khan, the dragoman of the Russian Consulate at Turbat-i-Haid- ari, was murdered on the evening of February 13th by a Bussian subject.

He struck me as a harmless lunatic, but my colleague of course accuses him of being a spy. British interests. —The Karguzar has been obliged to warn M. Collard that unless some notice is taken by the Revenue Department of complaints from the British and Russian Consulates-General he will have those against whom complaints are made arrested without reference to the Department. Herat news. —Adam Khan of Sabzawar (Afghanistan) has recently been raiding the Khaf district, and in one of his raids a Persian and an Afghan were killed. The Governor of Herat has sent a detachment to arrest him. The Afghan Government is said to be sending considerable numbers of intelli gence agents, disguised as merchants, into Russian Turkistan. Political Summary. Condition of country. —Complaints continue to be received from various dis tricts, but especially from Turbat-i-Haidari, of the misconduct of the revenue offi cials.

On all sides, I hear it said that whereas under the old regime a Kadkhuda had only to keep on good terms with the Governor and his Mustaufi, it is now necessary for him to conciliate quite a number of Mirzas ihe total of unwarrantable changes amongst Kadkhudas during the past few months IS described as scandalous. ^ r Two Mirzas during the past week—one a man who was educated in England and the other a Sunni— have been reprimanded for being too friendly with the clerks of this Consulate. This, however, was before the order about Mubashshar- ul-Mulk arrived. The Outlaiv, Naushirwan —Sardar Khudadad Khan has written to me that Naushirwan left Khwaja Ahmed for Quetta on the 25th February. Sardar Pasand Khan gave me the same information on the 28th. It remians to be seen where the man is next heard of. In Lutak it is said that Naushirwan has written to the Chakhansur authorities begging to be allowed to settle in Afghanistan, and saying that if no land is given him there he has no alternative but to go to Quetta. Baluch Raiders. — A week ago I heard a strange rumour from Lutak that Shaukat-ul-Mulk had sent a Khilat from Tehran for Sardar Saiyid Khan, Narui, of Bampur. On making further enquiries I am told that the parcel which had been received from Tehran had been forwarded by Haider Ali Khan, the cousin of Hashmat-ul-Mulk, along with two horses and two mules. It was announced by India, Fokf on Secrei ady'S No J 3 vl, elated 26 MAR 1914 1 I ilHaider AH Khan’s two messengers in Lutak that Shaukat-ul-Mulk and Hashmat-uh Mulk had jointly sent the present. Further enquiries show that the horses are a present from Haider Ali Khan himself to his relations in Bampur. The mules are to bring back a lady of the C family from Bampur to Sistan. Nothing is known in Birjand about this deputation, and it seems extremely unlikely that Shaukat-ul-Mulk would join with his nephew in such an affair. Customs Department at Koh Malik Siah —The temporary deputation of Mirza Mustafa Khan to Koh Malik Siah has been rescinded. Mahammad Wali Mirza, nominally the second Persian subordinate in Sistan, who is rather friendly with the Russian Vice-Consulate, is going instead. This man and Mubashshar-ul-Mulk have not been on good terms with each other; the latter has probably arranged the removal, temporary though it may be&gt; of the £ Shahzada ’ from Sistan. F. B.

Haji Mukhtar, Baluch, com-January 24 th. plains that as he has paid all the revenue due from him, Mirza Khalil Khan’s attack on him was unjustified. He telegraphed to this effect to the Governor- General, who consulted the Commander of the Troops, the Karguzar, and M. Collard m the matter. Ml these officials have telegraphed their views to Tehran. It is not unlikely that Khalil Khan s demands were unjust, for he is said to be making large profits out of his post and to have deposited with Messrs. Stucken and Company 30,000 tomans to the credit of his private account. The rapid acquisition of wealth by revenue collectors is a common topic of conversation in Meshed. Russian Affairs^ All objections to Abdul Hamid’s tenure of the post of attache to the Russian Consulate-General seem to have been withdrawn, to the disappointment of Mirza Kasim Khan, interpreter to the Imperial Bank of Persia, who is said to have been trying to obtain the post for his son, Mirza Mehdi Khan a clerk in the Bank. The Elections .—The democrats of Meshed, who are mostly Bahais, are said to Januar y 25th - have been urged by their friends in Tehran to nominate members for the Majlis, and to have selected Haji Shaiuh-ur-Rais who, though not a Bahai, is acceptable to them, Shahzada Jalal-us-Sultan and Mirza Nijat, but they have telegraphed to Tehran to say that they cannot hold an election on their own account and do not approve of party nominees. Local Affairs .—See last week’s diary. The prisoners have been removed from the police prison and the building is being disinfected. Baluch robbers have attacked some Barbaris and residents of Sang-i-Safid at Kutal-i-Afchak, near Sabzawar, and have killed one of them* The road guards, having received no pay, naturally display little promptitude in cases of this nature. Russian Affairs .—The Russians, having obtained a site for their hospital in the public garden, are now in difficulties regarding a road to it. I have refused to allow a gate to be opened through a wall belonging to and opposite to the main gate of the Consulate-General and the Commander of the Troops and the Karguzar are objecting to the opening of a gate further south. Russian Affairs .—Kadir Beg, a Russian spy, has arrived at Herat and has left that place for Kandahar, disguised as an Afghan. Local Affairs .—On January 22nd Haji Amanullah Khan, Governor of Nim- buluk, was shot dead at night in his house at Dihshak, seven farsakhs from Kain, by some person unknown. It is reported that a disease of which the symptoms are sore throat and the vomiting of blood has broken out at Arzana, a small town in the Kariz district. Herat News.—It is reported from Herat that a Russian who was admitted to Kabul as a convert to Islam and employed as a drill instructor was found to be a spy and was put to death six months ago. The»Governor of Herat has appointed Dost Muhammad Khan Governor of Gulran and has summoned to Herat, on charges of extortion, the Governor of Garucha, who has already been compelled to disgorge and restore 7,000 krans. Local Affairs.—Recently some Baluchis, resident in Russian territory, lifted a flock of 95 sheep from Jangiran in the Sarakhs district. The Governor sent men m pursuit of them and recovered 60 sheep, but there was some difficulty in the way of armed pursuers crossing the frontier. Turkoman Raids.—According to telegraphic news from Bujnurd the Turkomans have again set out on a raid to Jajarm, and the Governor and the Sarhaddar are marching against them. January 26th.

Collard has been warned against the use of armed force in the collection of the revenue without previous consultation with the Governor-General. After a conference it was decided that the steps already agreed upon, and now approved by Tehran, should be taken, that Haji Mukhtar Khan and Mirza Khalil Khan, with his twelve gendarmes, should be summoned to Meshed and that the case should be investigated before the Governor-General, the Commander of the Troops, the Karguzar, and M. Collard. Political Summary. State of Country. —The country is quiet, except for robberies by small gangs and the prosecution of private feuds. State of Roads. —The roads appear to be quiet at present. The Governor-General —N&amp;yyii-VLdi-Ttaxdeh, whose health is now restored, remains on the best terms with this Consulate-General. He is corrupt in spite of his wealth, and is not popular among the Young Persians but, on the whole, he is about as good a governor as Khorasan could have at present. He is not sufficiently pl^jnt to please the Russians and they would be glad to see him removed. My Russian Colleague's ostensible objection to him is that he is old and inefficient but the objec tion comes with singularly bad grace from Prince Dabija. .* T. W.

The prospect of an investiga tion at Meshed does not appear to have been agreeable to Khalil Khan who called on the Russian Consul at Turbat as the person chiefly interested in serious disturb ances. The Russian Consul returned the call and also called on the officers of the gendarmerie and urged them to attack Haji Mukhtar Khan and the Baluchis nro- mising his support and protection both to them and to Khalil Khan. Accordinglv 25 gendarmes left Turbat on the 30th and 125 more on 31st to attack Haii Mukhtar Khan. Asadullah, the Deputy Governor of Turbat, who is on bad terms with Haii Mukhtar Khan, also furnished 50 sowars to assist the gendarmes. Haji Mukhtar who had received assurances from, and had been summoned to Meshed by the Gov ernor-General, telegraphed to him from Rishkhar complaining of this breach of faith and the news also reached Meshed from other sources. On the evening of January 31st the Governor-General sent fox the Commander of the Troops, the Karguzar, and M. Collard. M. Collard denied having sent any orders directing Khalil Khan to proceed against the Baluchis and went to the Telegraph Office, where he sent for Khalil Khan and demanded an explanation from him. Khalil Khan attempted to justify his mischievous action by a false story to the effect that the Baluchis intended to attack Turbat and that the gendarmes had been sent out only one stage for the protection of the town. M. Collard ordered Khalil Khan to send immediate instructions to the force to halt and this was done. Haji Mukhtar Khan has receiv ed fresh assurances and has started for Meshed. The Foreign Minister has enquired by telegram why, in spite of warnings to the contrary, the revenue and gendarmerie officials exchanged visits with the Russian Consul. The Commander of the Troops in Meshed is justly annoyed with Asadullah Khan for having, without his permission, given active support to the revenue offi cials, and has suspended him. The Russian Consul at Turbat asked Prince Dabija to intercede for Asadullah Khan and Prince Dabija has had a conversation on the sub ject with the Commander of the Troops but, so far, the latter remains firm. The local newspaper, Nau Bahar, publishes a full account of the incident, but without any direct reference to the Russians, and it will be interesting to see whether any complaint against the paper is made by my Colleague. Khalil Khan has been summoned to Meshed. The Governor of Sarakhs telegraphs to the Governor-General that cultivators are leaving their land owing to the poll-tax and herd-tax, and that government lands are likely to remain untilled this year. Many complaints of the oppressive conduct of the revenue gendarmes in the suburbs of Meshed are being received. Persian Officials. —Mufakhkham-us-Sultaneh, the newly appointed Karguzar of Sabzawar, left Meshed last week for Sabzawar. Adl-ud-Daulah, Governor of Kuchan, is much displeased at the release of Saiyid Hasan of Turbat (see diary for the week ending January 24th) and is said to have reminded my colleague of a promise that Saiyid Hasan should be hanged. Adl- ud-Daulah’s grievance against the man is that he disclosed the partnership between them. Adl-ud-Daulah has recently sent a horse and some Kuchan wine to the Rus sian Consulate-General, and has suggested that the Russians should deal directly with him in all matters in which he can help them. On February 4th Nayyir-ud-Daulah called on my Colleague, having first sent to him, by the Commander of the Troops, a turquoise and diamond ring. Prince India, Foreign Secretary’s ' ^ '/!. No T 2 T'l, dated 19 MAR 191^Dabiia is said to have promised to telegraph to Tehran recommending Nayyir-nd- DaulalTs retention in Meshed as Governor-General. At the interview Prince Dabija asked for and obtained the release of Haji Mirza Hasan Nakib, a Russian pro%e who had been imprisoned by the police for being drunk and disorderly. The Gov ernor-General promised that the man should be released but it was found that the Chief of the Police had extorted three hundred tomans from him. The prisoner was compelled to write a letter saying that he has willingly subscribed this money for clothes for the prisoners and for the police school, and the Chief of the Police has been obliged to pay it into the police chest, which is under the charge of the revenue officials. Russian Affairs. Eight rifles, a box of cartridges, and a Russian uniform cap, probably belong ing to a man recently reported as missing, have been found in the house of Kat- khuda Kambar of Shirwan. The Katkhuda is being sent to Meshed at the request of my Colleague. Prince Dabija is said to have demanded the dismissal of the Karguzar of Sar- akhs on the ground of his neglecting the interests of the Russian subjects. The Karguzar of Sarakhs has replied by producing a letter from the Governor of Russian Sarakhs thanking him for services rendered to Russian subjects. The Karguzar at Meshed has reported the case to Tehran for orders. The Russian subjects in Meshed have again demanded the dismissal of the Attache, Abdul Hamid. Prince Dabija is said to have replied that he would short ly be leaving Meshed and that his successor would be accompanied by his own Attache. Travellers. The Austrian traveller whose arrival at Bujnurd was reported in last week’s diary has arrived at Meshed. His name has not yet been ascertained. A Russian Inspector of the Telegraph line has also arrived. Herat News. The Governor’s Secretary, who was imprisoned for corruption, has given a list of his confederates and has been released pending further enquiries. The Government storekeeper lately dismissed for dishonesty is to be sent to Kabul, his successor having arrived. Robberies are becoming more frequent in the town, the offenders being in most cases soldiers. Of four Jews who recently arrived in Herat from Russian territory one has been allowed to remain for the present to settle their busines transactions and the other three have been deported. The arrival of a Russian at Chihil Dukhtaran is reported. He says that he had an appointment in St. Petersburg which he has resigned, that he has two brothers, one a Captain in the Russian army in Odessa and the other an Officer in London, and that having travelled to the Afghan frontier without a railway ticket and being without means he proposes to beg his way through Afghanistan to British territory and there earn enough money to carry him to London, where his brother will provide for him. The Governor of Herat has not yet decided what to do in the matter, but is hardly likely to believe the story. Kariz News. The Governor of Bakharz has visited Kariz and called on the British News- writer and the Russian Doctor there.3 aM Political Summary. Coniitkm of Country.

Disturbances in Persia.—The Russian press states that the outrages com mitted from time to time m Persia, e.g., during December and January! in Tab riz and near Bagh-i-Shemaha, where a Persian was killed, are the work of bad characters, dressed as Russians, but not Russian subjects. An informant in Astrabad states that it is beheved in Astrabad that the late Shah will arrive in Astrabad in the beginning of March and will make another effort to recover the throne. Our informant states that an emissary of the late Shah recently arrived in Astrabad and that arms and horses are being collected The Persian Ambassador at Petersburg has announced that the tumours circulated by the Russian press, to the effect that the Bakhtiari are planning an attack on Tehran in the spring, are without any foundation of truth. 91. Russian troops in Persia.—The extra expenditure, incurred by the Rus sian Government during 1912 on account of the maintenance of Russian garri sons in Persia, amounted, according to the Russian press, to £464,010-0-1. On 17th January, a detachment of 3 officers and 160 men, 19th Turkistan Rifle Regiment, left Krasnovodsk, by postal steamer, for Astrabad. 92. Russian trade in Persia .— At Petersburg, on 1st January, before the Minister of Finance, Mr. A. A. Kosminski,?agent in Tehran for the Russian Minister of Commerce and Industry, delivered a lecture on Russian policy and trade in Persia. He said that Persia interested Russians not only as a market for Russian produce but as a neighbour, for whose well-being Russia was responsible. Persia was always in debt to Russia, whose only guarantee of payment consisted in the Persian customs. In closing the transit of wares through Russia and Persia, Rus sia was acting only in the mutual economic interests of the two countries. The l lecturer reviewed the progress, made by Russian trade in Persia during the last 10 years, pointing out that Russia had outstripped Britain in the race for the Persian market. He stated that, in 1901, of the whole of Persian trade, Russia owned 44 per cent.* Britain 33 percent., but, in 1913, the Russian share had risen to as much as 70 per cent.* while the British share had fallen to 20 per cent. In the import of cotton goods, Russian imports in 1905 were valued at 8,400,000 roubles, and, rapidly increasing, in 1913 were valued at 16,200,000 roubles. Against these figures British imports in 1905 were valued at 12,500,000 roubles, and, increasing less rapidly, in 1913 were valued at 14*200*000 roubles. But new competitors would appear in the Persian market with the new rail- frontier were essential for the transport of Russian imports. With regard to finance, the position of the Russian Bank in Persia was deplorable, and due partly to the inefficiency of those in charge of its operations but chiefly to the privileged position of the British Bank, the Imperial Bank of Persia, which had the monopoly of the issue of bank-notes and of the financial operations in general 6f the admin istration. The management of Persian finance by Belgians, had, in the lecturer’s opinion, not attained the results which had been expected. 93. Persian finance.- —M.

The discussion led to some controversy as to the cause of the failure of the Don stud-farms, one speaker attributing it to the fact that the grass-land, given for the purpose of breeding horses, was misappropriated to the reeding of cattle and sheep and to the growing of cereals, and that the horses were regarded merely as the working foundation, on which to build up the prin- thG f ? rm ‘ The meetln g threw out a proposal, made by^this Sri™ nf° i ln A 0 f UCe + f nd encoura ge horse-breeding in Turkistan by giving a large annear-pd 6 P ur P 0Se ^ a pominal rent.

The Governing family of Sistan and Kainat.—On the 17th instant Colonel Vygornitzky, Acting Russian Vice-Consul, telegraphed to Hissam-ud-Daula through the Persian telegraph clerks: “ Hashmat-ul-Mulk’s afiairs satisfactorily settled. Details by post ”. The Vice-Consul evidently believed his statement to he true, as he hinted something to the same effect to me on the 18th. He was surprised when I told him that I believed Hashmat-ul-Mulk was under arrest. under arrest. On a subsequent reference to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, I have been informed that “ Hashmat is still under arrest and will be more strictly confined in a day or two if he does not make a settlement of our claims It looks as if the Eussian Legation are preparing to assist Hashmat to pay up. I hear from Birjand that Shaukat-ul-Mulk has telegraphed that he hopes to reach Meshed on 24th February, and to continue his journey after a stay of five days there. The Finance Department in Sistan. —Another regrettable Excise incident occurred on the 19th instant. A preventive officer and a gendarme raided the house of a shop-keeper—a Saiyid—in search of opium. They knocked, the old man about and insulted his women, but did not find the stock about which they had received information. They then carried the Saiyid off to the presence of Mirza Haji Khan, Director of Excise, who abused the accused man, told him that he had not been beaten as much as he deserved, and ordered him to be locked up. A short time later, a crowd of shop-keepers went to the office, and by clamouring got the Saiyid released. On the following morning, the shop-keepers in a body came to this Consul ate with the victim, who showed me his injuries, which were not very severe. They declared that they all would take “ hast ’’ if their grievance was not redressed. They were accompanied by a number of Saiyids and Mullas. I sent the shop keeper's complaint, with the deputation’s petition, to M. Paquet. On the fo low ing morning, a meeting was held at the house of Mulla Mehdi, the Mujtehid, at which Mubashshar-ul-Mulk and Haji Khan represented the Finance Department. The Karguzar chanced to be present accidentally. Immediately after the close of the proceedings the shop-keepers came m a body to the Consulate to thank me. They stated that my letter had been read out publicly, after which Mirza Haji Khan had apologized; ^the Saxyid received two small sums of money as compensation for an alleged loss in the scuffle and or damage done to his coat, and the dismissal of one of the Excise subordinates was promised. As the aggrieved man said: “After Mirza Ha] i Khan had pub cy kissed his hand, what further atonement could be required . The next morning M. Paquet wrote to me a ridiculously untrue account of the proceedings before the ^ y Mubashshar-ul-Mulk and Haji Khan, which was to of confessed himself to be in the wrong and that he a P respect for his ancestors !'

It corroborates the statement of the deputation entirely. The incident shows either that M. Paquet is ^Wm^nmlrepreLling Mirzas, or else that he does not hesitate to conspire with them m misrepresenting India, Foreign Secretary's I 2 .vl, ddt@c)2 facts. He told me verbally on the evening before writing to me that he had ordered the Mirzas to conciliate the Saiyids at all costs. Monsieur Paquet does not hand over charge to Ibtihaj-us-Sultan until Monday the 23rd, I believe. He claims that he must wind up the accounts of the month before doing so. Though Ibtihaj-us-Sultan knows French very well, M. Paquet complains of great difficulty in explaining all the details of his important charge. I have just seen a Circular notice issued by him, in which he styles himself “ Provincial Con troller of Revenues ”, though, to the best of my belief, he has received no authority to deal with Birjand. It is possible that Ibtihaj-us-Sultan has retained the control of the Kainat Administration, which will really be included in the charge of the next Belgian to come here. Baluch Raids.—{a) The Deputy Governor of Sistan has made a half-hearted attempt to capture Aibu (see Diary No. 4). In the result the Brahui has gone into the hills with the remainder of his unsold loot. (b) A caravan of 20 Sistani traders, returning from Bandar Abbas, has been plundered of some goods by Ali Shah Khan, Narui, Idu and Juma, Jalal, in the neighbourhood of Nasratabad Spe. (c) The news of the fighting between Mir Jehind’s lashkar and the Deputy Governor of Bam has reached Koh Malik Siah. It is reported that a number of Baluchis have been killed. The outlaw, Naushirwan .—It seems possible that this man will not go to India after all. He writes to me that Yakub Khan, Sanjerani, refuses to accom pany him. Yakub Khan also writes that he believes Naushirwan contemplates flight to Baluchistan Sarhad, after receiving a consignment of rifles which he is expecting from that direction. Gun-runners .—Khan Muhammad, Ghilzai, of Saddaki, with five 'companions, has returned from Mekran with forty rifles, and has taken them to Chakhansur and Farah in Afghanistan. Afghan Sistan .—The Chakhansur authorities have been ordered, by firman, to repopulate Tarakku and Daki Dela. For the first place, a canal is to be dug from Bandar Kamal Khan under the supervision of the Governor, the Daftardar— Mirza Abdul Ghafur Khan—and the Deputy Governor of Chahar Burjak, Ata Muhammad Khan, Sanjerani. The canal to Daki Dela is to be cut through a hill, for which work dynamite cartridges will be supplied. Kabul News .—A rumour has reached Sistan that the Amir’s Yazir, Mirza Abdul Ahmed, has been killed by a band of dacoits, who broke into his house at night. F. B.

Saiyid Hasan of Turbat, the robber who was captured by the Consular escort in Rubat Kumai in May last, having furnished sureties approved by the Governor- General, has been released with my consent.

See diary for the week ending 8th November 1913. M. Suprunoft, Director of the Russian Bank, has returned from leave and resumes his duties to-day. Russian Affairs. —I have discovered that the article in the Nau-Bahar to January 20 th. which my Russian Colleague objected was an article in the issue of January 8th headed Khalisajat-i-Daragaz ( “ The government lands of Daragaz ”). The article refers to a proposal that the lease of these lands should be taken from the present governor of Daragaz and given to some other person or company at a higher rental. The identity of the new lessee is, the paper says, not known, but the proposal is inconvenient as the lands are so extensive that the lessee must necessarily be held responsible for the maintenance of the public peace, and this would mean the division of responsibilty with the governor. On this and other grounds the paper is opposed' to any disturbance of the existing arrangement. It is the Russians who have been intriguing to get this lease into their own hands by putting up men of straw who will be financed by the Russian Bank. As the article contains no reference to this intrigue and nothing that could be construed, by any one igno rant of it, as a reflection upon the Russians, my Colleague’s objection to it is most indiscreet. I believe that the editor was sent for and browbeaten by Prince Dabija, but the paper continues to appear. Travellers. —The name of the German Commercial traveller who arrived last week is Pugin. He is said to be establishing an Agency for artificial indigo in Meshed and to be contemplating a journey to Yezd in his motor car. Local Affairs. —The charge against the Chief of Police in Turshiz, who was sent to Meshed in custody last week, is that he connived at the escape of a robber who was suspected of complicity in the robbery of Mr. Niedermeyer. The Gov ernor of Turshiz has appointed one Kazim Khan Sarhang to the vacant post, but the Chief of Police at Meshed has nominated Ghulam Reza Khan. Russian Affairs. —The Russian Consulate-General is reported to be pressing Rais-ut-Tujjar for repayment of money borrowed by him from the Russian Bank or for the hypothecation to the bank of his real property. Rais-ut-Tujjar is said not to be averse from this mode of settlement, as his title to much of the property is doubtful and he hopes to have it authenticated by the seal of the Karguzari, which would be necessary in the case of a mortgage or transfer to the Russian Bank. The difficulty in the way is that the Karguzar is not prepared to vouch for the Raisut-Tujjar’s title. In this and other cases both M. Romanovski and Abdul Hamid are said to be displaying gross venality. The former is a connoisseur in carpets, of which he already has a very fine collection. I believe that the Russians have secured a site for their new hospital, for which they have a grant of 10,000 roubles, at the west end of the public gardens. They are said to expect pecuniary assistance from the Meshed municipality. ■ Last week a Russian Armenian opened on oil engine cotton press near the square of the citadel. L2 r 7 Affairs —The disease which has broken out in the police gaol (see diary for last week) is,'as might have been expected enteric fever. Two deaths have occurred during the last three days and the Chief of Police says that he intends to have the prisoners sent elsewhere and have the gaol disinfected. Herat News—Orders have been received from Kabul for the issue of rations Salih Muhammad Khan, the new Kotwal appointed from Kabul, reached Herat on January 12 th. Charges of corruption brought against the Secretary to the Governor of Herat against three Government Engineers and one of their clerks are under investi gation. Case of theft by soldiers are said to be on the increase in Herat, and a soldier was recently shot and killed while committing theft. Seven Hazara families, immigrants from Persia, have arrived in Herat and are awaiting an interview with the Governor. Travellers.—D t. Esselstyn returned to Meshed to-day. Kariz News. Sore-throat and small-pox have broken out in the Kaziz dis trict. The Kussians are attempting to popularize vaccination, but the people are not responding.

Refined 222 „ (3) Via Dushakh Refined 1,569 „ Moist 517 „ The Revenue Department. —About a week ago seven revenue gendarmes under an officer went to Chakmak to arrest Haji Mukhtar Khan, Baluch, and to recover some of the new taxes, which the Baluchis have refused to pay. Haji Mukhtar Khan fled and took refuge with Salar Khan at Aliak. The Baluchis then attacked the gendarmes and took away their arms and horses. The gendarmes are said to have shot two Baluchis. The Baluchis have declared a feud against the depart ment. A body of 125 gendarmes has been sent from Meshed against them, and M. Collard informs me that he considers this force sufficient to bring the Baluchis to reason. Kariz News. —The Custom Officials on the border are said to be very vexa tious in their treatment of traders between Persia and Afghanistan. Tabas News. —The camel-sowars of the Governor of Tabas are said to have had some success against a band of 300 Baluch raiders, and to have recovered five flocks of sheep and arrested five robbers. Political Summary. State of Country. —The country is quiet on the whole, but it remains to be seen what success the revenue gendarmes will gain against the Baluchis of Chak mak and Aliak. There has been some distress in the Sarakhs district owing to the stoppage of the mills from want of water, but the local custom officer and a few leading merchants of Sarakhs have started a mill worked by an oil engine.

Russian troops in Persia.—k telegram from Tehran, published in the Russian press, states that the impending withdrawal of the Russian troops from Kazvin, where a few sotnias only will remain, has produced upon the Persian Government an impression, most favourable to Russia^ 73. Persian Cossack Brigade.—k correspondent writes, from Kazvin, to the following effect. The normal cadre of the Persian Cossack Brigade, in Tehran, consists of 6 squadrons, 4 companies, 6 guns (2 mountain) and 1 machine-gun detach ment. The squadrons are maintained on the lower establishment. Of this force, 2 squadrons, completed to full strength, and the machine-gun detachment, have been sent to Kirmanshah, and 2 companies and the 2 mountain guns to Hamadan. In addition to the above, there is a weak company (115 men) at Resht, a division (2 squadrons) of cavalry and a few infantry, without machine-guns or artillery, at Tabriz, but no troops at Kazvin except Russians. Resources. 74. Irrigation. —In the Tejend oasis, there are 336,000 acres, suitable for cul tivation; of these only 12,500 are irrigated. Irrigation works, on a large scale, are to be commenced this year. 75. Minerals. —Mr. Garnet, an English engineer from the Transvaal, has recent ly passed through Skobolef to the east; he is examining certain localities on the Pamirs, in the interests of an English gold and copper-mining syndicate. Three years ago, a French firm, Orser and Company, opened coal-mines, 26J miles from Skobolef. On the Pamirs, at a distance of about 79 miles from rail head, Mm, Sheremetef and Poklevski-Kozell have obtained concessions to the extent of over 540 square miles, in a district, the auriferous character of which was established long ago by the English geologist, Murchison, and confirmed by the Russian expert, Mushketof, and others. Traces of old Chinese gold workings still exist. During the summer of 1913, in Altik-Mazara, 100 puds of ore produced 10J lbs. avoirdupois or 4,608 grains, (100 puds equals *612 ton). On the Pamirs, at Shahdara, 100 puds of ore produced 6 puds of copper, i.e,, the ore was composed of metal to the extent of 6 per cent. «t Military. 76. Intelligence. —The “ Askhabad” newspaper refers to the recent order, forbidding the publication of any items of military and naval intelligence, a s un necessarily arbitrary, in view of the extent to which other European powers leave such matters to the discretion of editors. Instances are cited, e.g., the publication of a description, in No. 264 of the “ Russki Invalid ”oi the new English rifle, and, in other papers, some Russian, some foreign, of details of the new Austrian howit zer, a German gun, an Austrian rifle for firing at aeroplanes, the new German machine-gun of the “ Egarda ” system, etc. 77. Afghan-Russian intelligence agent. —An Afghan, from Kabul, who left Afghanistan with Isa Khan, named Muhammed Kasim, lives at Kerki and is nominally in charge of the resident Afghan community. He receives 50 roubles pay per mensem from Russia. He is said to be the medium of communication be tween the Russian Intelligence branch and the Afghan Governors ox Maizar-i Sharif and Sang-i-Charak, a district some 30 miles south-east of Sar-i-pul. 78. Appointment. —Major-General Yablochnik, Commanding Regiment of Guards, to command the 3rd Turkish Rifle Brigade, 27t ^ ecem e 1913, India, Foreign Secretary’s No. JOiVI, dated MARI 91 d2 79 The Russian army, in 1913.—The press congratulates the War Office on the progress, made in 1913, and especially on the following measures (а) The reform of the Military Medical College, conducted in the face of much ^ ^ opposition, but necessary as a logical sequel to the improvements, effected in the medical branch throughout the army, and to the new regulations regarding obligatory military service. (б) The increase in the effective strength of the corps of combatant officers by— (1) raising the status of the Irkutsk school, now preparatory for the Omsk cadet corps, to that of a corps ; (2) creating the Sergius artillery school at Odessa ; and (3) merging into one the technical and pyrotechnical artillery schools. (c) The addition to the pay of “ flying men ”, to that of officers of 200 roubl- V es (£22) and to that of Non-Commissioned Officers of 75 roubles (£8) for a period not to exceed 6 months in any year, and for those months only in which at least 6 hours have been spent in the air. The Flying Corps will, probably, be transferred from the General Staff to the Engineer Department as formerly. &gt; id) The arrangement, made with, insurance companies, by which officers are V able to insure their lives and property on privileged terms. (e) The army order (No. 327) of 22nd June (5th July), to the effect that the time spent by men under punishment by military authority, shall not count towards the completion of their period of obligatory military service. The effect has been a great reduction m the amount of military crime and in the number of punishments. The press animadverts unfavourably on the recent change in uniform, made on the grounds of economy and simplicity and to satisfy the requirements of war conditions. The new uniform is said to be neither simpler nor cheaper than the old uniform. 80. Movements of troops. —In addition to the batch of 200 recruits, who arriv ed on 19th December, at Termez, 1,748 recruits have arrived at that station. 150 recruits arrived at Charjui, on 10th January, and left for Kerki, by road. 81. Ordnance stores. —Four hundred boxes, each containing 24 rounds, artil lery ammunition for field guns, were despatched on 10th January, from Tashkent to Askhabad, destined, according to the statement of the escort, for Persia.

Projected railways. —The press, reviewing the progress made by the pro vince of Trans-Caspia during the past year, refers to the projected construction of railways from AJexandrof Gai to Charjui and from Tejend to the Persian and Afghan frontiers as enterprises, likely to be undertaken at an early date. 89. Parcel post. —(Reference paragraph 647, General Summary, 1913). Reuter, London, 19th January, reports energetic German protest against Russian deci sion to discontinue importation into Persia of non-Russian wares by parcel post via Julfa and Askhabad. The Persian post-office officials had not, on 19th January, published any notice on the subject. F. G. MARSH, Major, Military Attache, Meshed. G. M. Pm, Sualfc-Ko. C.-700 P.

Diary of the Military Attache, Meshed, No. 3, for the week ending the 17th January, 1914. History. 52. Mongolia.—The Russian press states that the Mongolian Mission is pro longing its stay m Petersburg m consequence of the receipt of a telegram to the effect that the town of Bolon Nor, in South-East Mongolia, has been destroyed bv Chinese troops. It is suggested, by the same authority, that this action by Chinese troops portends some new move by China in Mongolia, probably in violation of the recent Russo-Chinese agreement, and that, in this event, the Mongolian’ is better situated in Petersburg than in Urga, both to keep informed of the course of affairs and to purchase foreign warlike stores and material. 53. Armenia. The Russo-Armenian Society in Russia has received informa tion that Armenia is on the point of revolt against Turkey and that the whole Armenian population is well armed. 54. Aviation in Trans-Cassia. —M. Siedof, one of the Russian aviators who served with the Bulgarians in the late war, has arrived at Askhabad with a No. 16 Farman bi-plane, driven by a 50-horse power Gnome motor.

Salieski has obtained permission to work coal-mines in the hills of Kara-Tagh, to the east of Fort Alexandrovsk, Mangishlak. His fields will cover 54^ square miles in this district. 58. Cotton. —The Zokand Bourse Committee announced that during the year ending 21 st December, 1913, 8,033 wagons of cotton left Turkestan by the Central Asian Railway as against 8,088 in the previous year. 59 .

During the winter and the months of May, June and July, much of the water of the Sir Darya runs into the Aral Sea and is wasted, since more water is available at those times than is required for cotton-irrigation. 60. Horses.—The peasants of the village of Yannovski, Chimkent, who already own some good horses, have applied to the Aulie Ata government stuc - farm for a first-class stallion, in order to start a private stud and improve the breed of their horses. 61 1 Military. 61. Interpreters .— The system of instruction of officers in oriental languages which was inaugurated in Turkestan, three years ago, by General Tseil, then Chief of the Asiatic Section of the Russian General Staff, has proved to be a success. By this system officers spend eight months at the School of Languages in Tashkent LYsSn ZlrS tL counly where the Unguage at ^ is spoken ; they are then called up for examination.

The latter has apparently been very anxious to get Mirza Haji Khan, Director of Excise (one of the offenders m the caravan affair of 18th December 1913), out of Sistan, though it is said that the Mirza is himself not desirous of going, being a native of the place. In reply to the first confidential reference to Meshed, the acting Provincial Director said that Haji Khan might travel to Meshed at his own expense. Monsieur Paquet then sent the Mirza to Dr. Morozoff and obtained a Medical certificate from him which perhaps will entitle the man to travel at Government expense. The Shib-i-Ab district Mirza, Sadr-ul-Tdiba, a man with a bad reputation who has displayed hostility against Messrs. Muhammad Ali and Brothers more than once, has been called in to Head-quarters to relieve Haji Khan. I have asked Monsieur Paquet to send him to interview me soon after his arrival.. The Outlaw, Naushirwan Khan.—This man has decided to go to Quetta to interview the Authorities, who are granting him Rs. 200 for his travelling expenses. He was about to start on the 5th instant, when news of the death of Sardar Abbas Khan caused a postponement. On the 7th, he came into the City with Mir Yakub Khan, Sanjarani, to see me. He promises to start from Khwaja Ahmed on the 12th. / Gun-runners. —See Diaries Nos. 49 and 50 of 1913.

A considerable number of these men with their families, who fled to Afghanistan in August last, have returned to this District, though they have not yet made their peace with the Revenue Authorities. They are encamped in nomad tents on the Shela, half way between Sistan and Koh Malik Siah. Their two headmen, Nawab Khan and Sher Muhammad, are not with them, being settled down definitely in Afghanistan. The Rais-i-Kushun has issued a notice of warning to travellers. The Militaly Oflicer, Muhammed Beg Sultan, whose brother was killed in the fighting at Kaud, has gone independently to the Shela to demand “ blood-money ” from the tribe / F. B.

The family has been offered employment, not in Herat, but in Kandahar or Afghan Turkistan, and it appears to be likely that they will prefer the latter province. Nine families of Hazaras who fled to Russian territory ten years ago have returned to Kala-i-Nau with their belongings and are attempting to recover the immovable property which they formerly held there. Sardar Salih Muhammad Khan, who has been appointed Kotwal of Herat, is travelling thither from Kabul via Kandahar. Summary of Meshed Diary No. 1 of 1914.

News has been received from Bujnurd that the Goklan and Yamut Turko mans have been plundering on the frontier, but the local officials have recovered the plunder, consisting of sheep. Mirza Agha Khan has assumed charge of his 'duties as Superintendent of the Revenue in Bujnurd and is organising his Department there. Salar-i-Humayun, grandson of the Governor-General, lately appointed gov ernor of Turshiz, is displaying commendable activity.

Local News—Two local newspapers, the Tus, published once a week, and the January 5 th, 1914 . ■ Nau Bahar, published twice a week, have reappeared. The first number of the | latter contains an unfavourable review of the Persian translation of Maior Sykes’ book, The Glory of the Shia World, and also refers to an interview between Colonel Hjalmarsen and the editor of the Rad in which the former is reported to have said that the only difficulty in the way of sending gendarmes under Swedish Officers to all the principal cities of Northern Persia was want of money. The editor points out that 93,392 tumans are already spent annually on revenue gen darmerie in Khorasan and contests that a force under a Swedish Officer could easily be maintained for this sum, insinuating that foreign influence prevents the main tenance of an efficient force in this province. / The road-guards have not been paid for three months ’and to the Governor- General’s demand for their pay the revenue authorities have replied that they will not be paid until the Governor-General accepts reponsibility for the safety of the roads and the payment of compensation for losses by robbery. The Governor- General has formally accepted this responsibility. State of the Country. —About a fortnight ago twelve armed horsemen crossed the river from Burj-i-Khuda Bakhsh into the Sarakhs district. Twenty horse men were sent after them by the governor with the information that they belonged to Jan Muhammad Khan, Baluch, of Garmab and had visited Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam, but for what purpose was not known. Collection of Revenue. —Complaints continue to be received of the conduct f of the revenue gendarmes. The Revenue Department is troublesome owing to its independence of the local government. Complaints and applications for / redress, whether from the Consulate-General or from the Local Government, are ignored. The Belgian officials, who are nominally at the head of affairs, are ignorant of Persian and are necessarily in the hands of their subordinates. Russian Affairs—My Colleague is said to have ordered the Chief of Police January7th, 1914 . to report to him daily the names of the Persians whose calls I return and to prohi bit his subordinates from calling on the officials of this Consulate-General without special permission. Mith reference to the news published by Reuter that the Russians had pro- missed to withdraw a portion of their troops from Northern Persia, some Persians under Russian influence are said to be circulating for signature a petition aganist the withdrawal of Russian troops from Khorasan which they propose to forward by telegraph to the Persian Government. Travellers. —A German merchant, name unknown, is said to have reached Sabzawar from Tehran, en route for Meshed, in a motor car. Alleged Outrage by Russian Subjects.—Two Russian employes of Muhammad January 8th, 1914. Askaroff, a Russian subject who holds land at Mughan, recently wounded a Persian, Hasan, son of Muhammad, in a quarrel, and the man has died of his injuries.

He was threatened a month ago by a Kevenue gendarme and it is suspected that the Kais-i-Malivs of Dust-i-Biyaz instigated the murder. ^ Baluch Raids. See Diary No. 48 of 1913. It appears that Shah Nazar Khan Brahui didnot join the fosMur of Shah Sowar Khan. He and ^Aibu with their respective followings went into Kainat together. After some time they separated and Aibu went westwards towards Khabis, while Shah Nazar continued northwards. Aibu captured a Kerman caravan of 160 camels loaded with miscellaneous goods including a quantity of Rodang (red dye). He got back safely to his tents near Koh Malik Siah, and is said to be now selling his loot in southern Sistan. Shah Nazar’s party is probably that mentioned in {a) and {d) of Diary No. 51 of 1913, as they admit having lost one man killed and another wounded besides all the loot they had acquired. The Suspected Russian Spy. —I hear that this man had two companions when arrested by the Afghans. Both the latter got away the first night after their capture. One of them is believed to have been a member of the Bussian Consulate and the other is named Khair Muhammad, a regular spy of the Russians, who sometimes has visited Kandahar on their behalf. iG. M.

Baron Tcherkassov, as was long ago suspected, is also not fn ladv who lived with him here. It seems probable that if he should return to Sistan or any other place in Persia similarly accompanied, his social relations with his English colleague must become rather strained.

Thk rase has iust been finally settled by Sardar Pasand Khan delivering 12 camels and paying 320 Tomans to the Afghan Mamur, Abdus Samad Khan. The Sardar was imprisoned for about three weeks before the compensation was produced, and after his release he induced Monsieur Paquet to intervene with a protest against the harsh treatment accorded to a Sardar connected with the Postal contract! Latterly the Sardar, finding that the local authorities have ceased to take Monsieur Paquet seriously, has been visiting me and giving me information about Baluch raiders. He also solicits my assistance in his counter-claim against the Afghans. Afghan Robbers.—See Diary No. 2. One of the three bandits, now in custody at Birjand, is well known in Sistan. He calls himself Karim Dad, but his real name is Sur. He is a Milizi Nasar.

Baluch Raids, (a) The ruffian, Aibu Brahui, referred to in last week’s Diary, has presented ten of his looted camels to Sardar Khudadad Khan. He offered the same number to Sardar Ali Khan, son of Purdil Khan, but the latter express- ed his preference for their equivalent in cash \ He promised, at any rate, it is said, not to interfere with the sale of the loot. It is also whispered that the Deputy-Governor, Sartip Muhammad Raza Khan, has demanded a r panchak for himself. He recently sent a Mamur down to Girdi, ostensibly to arbitrate in the quarrel between the Brahuis and the Shebak tribe. Possibly the Sartip feels that he will not continue in office much longer.

(b) Anarchy in Kurdistan.' —According to the Russian press, the anarchy in Kurdistan calls for the occupation of Senna by a permanent detachment of 1,000 Cossacks, the distribution of 200 Cossacks in posts along the Turkish frontier in that district and the location of troops in Kurdistan. (c) Russian prestige in Northern Persia.—-Telegrams from Tehran and Ispahan, published in the Russian press, state that the unprecedented cordiality shown by the Persian official and ecclesiastical authorities to the Russian Embassy and consular offices on 19th December, the Tsar’s saints-day, testifies to the extraordinary height of Russian prestige in Persia at the present moment. 4. Climate. —An unusually mild winter has been experienced, up to the end of the year, throughout Turkestan. 5. Diseases. —Statistics, regarding the prevalence of syphilis in Russia, for 1911, recently published, give the following figures of diseased persons per 10,000 inhabitants in the three most affected governments Penza, 316*5; Simbirsk, 289*7 ; Tambof, 283‘5.

Sistan and Kain Consulate Diary No. 3 for the week ending the 17th January (received the 4th February) 1914. General. The Governing family of Sistan and Kainat. —His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk started from Tehran on the 16th instant. He intended to stay at a Shrine a few miles outside for three days and then to proceed via Meshed. He has telegraphed to his Deputy at Birjand as follows :—• “ Military arrangements for Kainat and Sistan have been settled. One thousand magazine rifles, 150,000 rounds ammunition and one maxim gun with 50,000 rounds are coming from India through the kindness of the British Government. Two field guns are also being supplied from Meshed. Sistan and Kainat are separated administratively from Khorasan. Officials for all Departments will henceforth be appointed from Tehran. Am bringing Mirza Ismail Khan as Kais of Revenue for Birjand. Ibtihaj- us-Sultan is going to Sistan. A Belgian will eventually be appointed there. Am also bringing five schoolmasters and a Military Doctor. ” Finance Department in Sistan. —Monsieur Paquet is shamelessly soliciting the officials and FadJchudas of Sistan to sign an istishhad (testimonial) regarding his good work. His head Mirza, Mabashar-ul-Mulk, produces the paper in front of him towards the end of every interview with local notables, and himself takes the seals from them. Most of the smaller Kadhhudas are afraid of refusing to have their seals affixed but the Mullas and Sardars are at present obdurate. Monsieur Paquet has informed me in an interview that he intends to appeal to the Belgian Minister at Tehran to get the Karguzar punished for inciting people to murder him! This is an absolutely groundless charge, in support of which no evidence whatever is forthcoming. Monsieur Paquet’s informant and subordinate Wall Muhammad Mirza, was stated to have said that he had heard Sarhang Amir Kuli Khan declare that he had heard the Karguzar give expression to the objection able language in a public Majlis. Sarhang Amir Kuli Khan demanded to be confronted with Wali Muhammad Mirza last Saturday, and the latter then admitted before Monsieur Paquet that he had heard of the Sarhang’s alleged statement from another party ! A British trader, Ghulam Muhammad, Peshawari, has stated in my office that he recently sent two Kharwars (Tabriz!) of ghi to Meshed on behalf of Mubashar- ul-Mulk. The local value of this consignment is 220 tomans. It is said that Mubashar-ul-Mulk constantly levies contributions of wheat and ghi from Kad- hhudas. On coming to Sistan a few months ago, he furnished his house throughout with carpets “ hired ” from Seth Suleiman. On the completion of his first tour in the district he returned all the hired carpets in a load. At the close of our recent interview Monsieur Paquet, who began with an at tempt at bluster, renewed his appeal to me not to have him sent away from Sistan, He stated that when he proposed to his staff the settlement of the caravan affair (see Diary No. 51 of 1913) in accordance with my demands, they all threatened to take bast in a mosque I I have learnt that the Mirzas employed similar tactics at least once during last summer. My view is now established as correct, that Monsieur Paquet is not capable of conducting so large a charge. Had he been friendly disposed to the Consulate it would have been easy, with the help of the local Govern ment, to settle the case promptly and satisfactorily.
