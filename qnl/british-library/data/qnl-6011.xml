I quite agree that the sooner this unpleasant business is over the better, but before I ask the Shaikh to &amp;is.aiss Izzat I should like to know clearly what my action should be if he procrastinates, which I expect him to do. He is unlike^ to refuse. 3. As you know I have asked for further details from MICE, my main object being if possible to discover the extent to which the Shaikh himself is committed. Until we have some evidence against him, however, he must be given the benefit * r m 'W of the doubt. v 4 # As I have already stated Izzat vas suspected in 1936 of being an Italian agent, (vide da Gaury’s demi-official letter No. 219 of the 4th June, 1938). He leftjpiwait during l &gt; / the troubles of 1938, vide Kuwait telegram No. 264 of the 13th August, 1938, but was allowed to return by the Shaikh. Yery Confidential . D.O. No.C/504. Besides any nefarious dealings Izzat, I believe, looks after the Shaikh’s properties in Egypt, and as such is useful. He also helps the Shaikh to keep up some sort of European stand ard when entertaining guests, and generally gives him a veneei of polish. He listens to the news for him, plays flick- billiards with him, lights his cigarettes for him etc. The Shaikh, indeed, had it in mind to appoint him as local representative of the Sulphur Company though he himself did not mention the matter to me. This shows that he holds Izzat in some esteem. ?or these reasons he is unlikely to part with/ The Hon’ble Lieut-Col. C.G*Prior, CI3.» ^ Political Besident in the Persian Gulf, at Bahrain.with him without a struggle, unless 'by putting up a fight he thinks we might implicate himself, 5. I think there is no need to wait for anything further from MICE so far as Izzat is concerned, for it is iimnaterial whether he is acting with the Shaikh # s acquiescence or on 'behalf of the anti-Subah-British party. It is amply clear that he is engaged in active anti-British activities and therefore I suggest that I must, soon after *ld, go to the Shaikh and ask him on your behalf to dismiss Izzat, and to have no further communication with him. I should give as my reasons that we know that he is an Italian agent, his movements having been watched when he was on leave this year (I think it would be better if I did not say about the Constantinople visits), and that he is also active in supply ing arms to the Mufti and that, therefore, he cannot be allowed to remain in a State under British Protection. The case is v/ithin ^ V-v the scope of article 8 of the ’Alan, but I do not think it neces sary to mention this to the Shaikh. The Shaikh will probably plead ignorance or airily attempt to wave the matter away with some plausible excuse to which I should be able to say that I have enlightened him as to the facts. I shall expect him to act imme diately though I presume a few days must be allowed to permit of affairs being settled, and also as a face-save for the Shaikh. 6. I shall keep you informed by telegraph how the matter progresses, but I should be grateful if you can let me have a message to deliver to the Shaikh should I find him difficult, as I expect to do.

I mentioned arms (h) whereupon he broke into profuse sweat and disavowed any knowledge. Tt appears that Ohaikh had not mentioned (b} to him. I told him that I could not assist him but Shaikh might speak on his behalf. 3. This morning Shaikh expressed bewilderment on same lines as to you but again requested proof before acting. T replied that I must refer to you which would bring his loyalty into question. He asked me to approach you. To my query he stated that he did not wish to go back on his word but thought that he was entitled to proof as a backing to his dismissing Izzat. 4. Tt is possible that Shaikh is ignorant - c.f. my telegram A* No. C/431 of October 26th - of fb) (he certainly does not attach great importance to it) and T should like to be able to convince him of IZzat’s dealings by mentioning correspondence come to light through the censor thereby showing that no amount of bluff can avail.

I have not communicated with MICE, but suggest that it might be worth while clearing up this point and also to learn if they know the number of the passport on which Izzat travelled to Constantinople, for I should not be in the least surprised if he had obtained a spare passport from the Egyptian Consul in Baghdad.

He pointed to what the Turks had been able to do through their national solidarity. He had then gone on to say that the British had bought over the Turks with £60,000,000 and the cession of Alexandretta and hinted darkly at a secret agreement between Great Britain and the Turks against the Arabs. He had apologised for the attacks which had been made on Koweit in the press and radio of this country in 1939 and claimed that so soon as his Government had come into office all this anti-Koweit propaganda had been stopped. He claimed to have the most friendly feelings towards the Shaikh of Koweit. All this blarney the Secretary told Mr. Bailey had not deceived him as he knew perfectly well the secret designs of many Iraqis on Koweit and he had told Mr. Bailey about the interview so that he might know what the Prime Minister had said. Saiyid Izzat Muhammad Jafar said that he intended to inspire some pro-British articles in the Iraqi and Syrian press.

Izzat Jaffar is about 30 years of age and is an Egyptian by birth but was educated in £3yria. He was employed as Private Secretary by the Shaikh on the recommendation of his brother - whose name I believe is Mohommed « who manages the Shaikh* s property in Dgypt. Before this he was employed by the society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Syria where he fell in with some gullible people from what I can gather from hiw conversation. Ke interested himself in horse racing and according to his own statement mixed with the better class people. He always makes a parade of his English acquaintances. He speaks French fluently, knows a little English and is proud of being a Free Mason which latter he deems an accomplishment and seems to think should protect him from all suspicion. tendencies, but nothing definite was known. He was definitely pro-^yrian and did what he could to further Kuwalt-syrian relations. He was here the Agent of the Brazilian Coffee Syndicate which he was responsible for ‘introducing into Kuwait. The shop here is a sub-branch of the Beirut Agency. 3 ^en in Kuwait he was early suspected of pro-Italian I understand that Izzat Jaffar is now in Egypt. Flight Lieut. R.B.

Shaikh \hraad is vain and cono^ited, hut of a secretive disposition, snd as he celdoni confides in anyone!t is difficult to discover exactly what is in his mini. Though his conscience is gfrtii evidently still not quite clear the departure of his Secretary, Izset Jafar, has undoubtedly had a good effect. He has, however, not severed connection with him. Z . It is uafortuiiate that the information given us that Jafar had been in touch with the Italian Consul General at Istanbul probably incorrect, and that the diddle jgast Intelligence Centime now suspect that it was the Consul in Beirut and not Istanbul with whom he was in contact. It will he remembered that the Shaikh immediately denied that laset had ever been to Istanbul, and if he raises the question again Salloway will tell him frankly that Beirut and not Istanbul was meant. Since the Bari radio announced laaeVs arrival in Syria it will be difficult for the Shaikh to deny Italian interest C.K.Caroe, Bsquire, C.S.I., C.I.E., I.C.3., Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, New Delhi.2 -.s interest in him# tiio geneml question of the 3haiichfe ur 5 S«tisfactorj nttitide, T think it is due to a suspicion of us instilled during de Gaury’s ill-starred rcgirae# He was ’mich disturbed by the turn the war took last year and to his doubts of our intentions has been added a fear that while he has committed himself we may perhaps not win after all. His troubles with his family are mostly due to his own hesitation and weakness, and his attitude towards Iraci is probably a combination of fear of her intrigues in his territory and a desire to stand well with her in case some disaster to our forces or change of policy should ts&amp;M place him at her mercy.

It is an other part of the communications between Egypt and Arabian countries which we ddsire to describe. They are the ways ,of many Egyptians looking for important activity amongst the arabian people- A/ithcut oeiiig su^perted by any Government, as they are willing to show in these new fields of energy tbeir own capacity and their initiative in their undertakings, their duty towards their Creator and great Nation as well as towards themselves. J On the service of H.k.the King Ibn ^,1 3eoud there ai’e many Egyptians. Their loyalty and qualifications placed them in the highest jost of the beoudite Government and some of them are tae greatest .61} 1 ^ &gt;tie representatives of Um Ai^abian Kingdom in Foreign Countries. Others are the greatest Imams teachindreligion in the Ked^sz and ethers also are important ^cvernflient officials and very reliaole ^ersonn&amp;lities to the Government they serve. All of them are not like in Irak,Yemen, Jyria etc., a mission sent at the request of these governments but they are A ^ople relying on their own capacity. And, of late, we have been acquainted ;ith .an Egyptian working at the Amarat JL Koweit. He is Ezzat ! ohamed Gaaffar Pey who for* the last six years filled in the post of Private secretary to H.S.the Emir of Koweit$ he deserved his position through his sound | ability and energy. Ve say his sound ability and energy uecauss the situation of the Interior and Foreign Affairs of this Arabian Island differ from those of the remaining Islands of the lersian Gulf. The city of Koweit itself which gives its name v*o tne Amirut ^ is to*, greatest harbour on the Persian Gulf and at t oe e time the greatest town coffipg rat: j; ve py to the other towns in ^raoian LcJid, as its inhabitants account to 1FO thousanas. Because, also, that the existence cf a harbour in such country is of utmost importance, specially when we know that Basra, the capital of Irak is not a harbour and that the Irak Country wishes that his harbour would be Koweit. It is evident that there is no better hmroour for the Arabi Seludite Government on the Persian Gulf than tne one of Kowsit which is the main way of communications and traffic to the markets of India,Iran . Afghanistan and the Mdole-East in general. ^e must add to this importance of Koweit the Treaty with Great-Britaidwhich assumes the independence of its internal ullairs and its protection against any foreign attempt. *e must bear in mind that Koweit at a time, which is before the lest great war, was talkidgf about by all political personn&amp;lities of the world . It was on all newspapers also, having oeen indicated 33 being the terminus of the East which line was plannee Oy the hx- K&amp;lser 'iiliam. Moreover, the discovery of petrol-pits since two years '■ &lt; md the expectation of more quantities to be found in them nave given x roweit a greater importance. By all this we see the important political situation of •oweit. Al 3 o‘ , J being a rule in Arabian countries that the Emirs them- 9 Ives render their orders and to them only are referred all national uestions to be dealt with, it is evident how dedicate is the post c. i private secretary to an Arabian Emir and that tne presence of Ez&amp; t ohamed Gaffar Bey in such post is a mark of his high qualifications ind. merit for which we convey to him our sincere congratulations*GOVERNMENT OF INDIA- Department.

Izzat Jaffer personally brought me the letters on the 13th of December and explained how it came about that he has been receiving letters from this individual and sought my advice with regard to his future action. He explained the past history of his acquaintance with the individual, which is already known to Intelligence in Beirut and Damascus, and asked whether I thought the enclosure to the second letter should be forwarded or not. I advised him to keep me informed of any letters that he received from persons of the political thought of Abdur Kazzak and suggested that he handed the correspondence over i to me. This he agreed to do without hesitation and declared his willingness to keep me informed of the arrival of any further letters of a similar nature. 3. Izzat Jaffer made occasion during our interview to offer his services for intelligence work in any part of the Middle Hast.

Dear Doctor A.sdorsham, I rote to you by the Concentration Camp mail at 7ao where I am detained. Being afraid that my letters had not reache safely I decided to Tite to you by sea mail. You remember our meeting in the University with the British Consul of Beirut on 14th May 1941 and how bravely T declared my opi 'ion towards \nrlo-Tracj. conflict and how the Consul, admired my courage to talk openly and how T disapproved the information given by the Broadcasting 'tation, London, and. how the Consul shoved that he was ready to correct that mistake. The result of the said information broadcast from London was as follows: 1. Iraq Government placed me under arrest for 19 days. 2 . T -was dismissed from my post where I was drawing 25 Iraqi dinars. 3. The Government detained me at ‘^ao and I have been in this camp for a month and I don’t know how long I am going to be rcept here. I don’t think it is right that the policy should wash down everything in its way. T am a learned man and have ser the Iraq Government and have no opinion about Democracy, Tasicm and Nazism. Those who fight for the rights and the truth should not oppress a man like me as they are doing. If the British Consul will correct his mistake, he will serve his nation before offering the service to me. I hope you will find no difficulty in approaching him and informing him of my aituation so that he may hasten to correct the mistake committed by his Government Broadcasting station of which H.3 was quite sure. I beg you to send the reply to the abovementioned address.CQNRaENTtAk.

Izzat Jaffer called to see me on the 13th of December and informed me that when he was returning from Beirut earlier in the year he called at the 3audi Legation in Baghdad to renew his acquaintance with members of the staff. While in the building he met Khadam as 3alah, who I am informed is a Lebanese and was at one time editor of 'Al Nidah' of Beirut. The presence of this individual in the legation surprised Izzat Jaffer as he knew him to be a follower of dashid Ali and a pro-Hazi. He therefore enquired and was informed that the fellow had sought sanctuary in the building. Izzat Jaffer says that he then spoke to Bin Saqir a very confidential agent of Ibn Baud's and desired him to inform his master of the presence of Khadam as Salah in the Legation. 3. Izzat Jaffer accompanied His Highness when he joined Ibn Baud Bhaikh Hamad of Bahrain's camp on the 30th November and he tells me that Ibn Baud took him on one side on one occasion when His Highness was not present and thanked him for the 'service he had rendered him, and at the same time allude in a pleasant manner to an article that he had written in his honour. Izzat Jaffer states that he took the opportunity to ask Ibn Baud if he might write a short account of the meeting of the three Arab Rulers for the newspapers and for broadcasting. Ibn Baud was pleased to agree and he prepared an article which he submitted to Ibn Baud who expressed his approval of the composition and gave permission for it to be published, however he qualified his The Hon'ble Lieut-Colonel W.R. Hay, C.I.S., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.

I understand that Izzat Jaffer took a further opportunity of speaking to Ibn Saud who was disinclined to interfere with the opinions and actions of his advisers on external affairs. Izzat Jaffer handed me the article which I have not thought desirable to have translated here but which I have little doubt will cause no trouble to Hallows. The erasions are interesting and as far as I am aware the only persons who know that the article was written and altered are Ibn Saud, Yusuf Yasin, the writer and myself.

Cairo to have pro-Italian leanings. He went to Syria where he became very much persona grata with British Intelligence circles there and returned to Kuwait with 71ayton*s support much to our embarrassment. On his return from 7yria last year, to which country he went as bear leader to Shaikh Hamood bin Jabir As Subah, he called on me and gave me a long account of his wander ings and his alleged contacts with our Intelligence officers •which included the mail bag incident. and as far as is known here of little account, he had not travelled abroad before and this advent are of his brought him little profit for he was dismissed from his appointment as President of the Municipality immediately on his return to Kuwait. 3 . I still do not understand how the Poanish mail bag is linked with '.Arab personalities' in Kuwait, in fact your letter under reference (see paragraph 8 of your letter 12/905 of 23rd December 1942) says there is no reason to suspect that that bag is used rather than any other 'Neutral’* 1 .ere3as the reference in your previous letter is clearly to the Tpanish bag and no other. ' T ay I suggest that in future before making written statements to embassy and other organisations, which suggest treasonable conduct on the part of Kuwaitis, you enlist my cooperation to discover whether or not the suspicions are well founded. It would certainly be to our mutual advantage and would ensure that written statements which you desired to make about personalities in Kuwait were as accurate as our joint knowledge could rn^ke them.

T ^hen His Highness heard of it lie bought ^ camels and sent them to Basra for onward deap^xtch as a present. In the last few weeks he was informed (probably through Izzat) that the Counsellor (?) of the l^yptian Siabassy at Baghdad wished to visit Kuwait to thank him officially on behalf of King Farouq. The Shaikh replied that he would not receive him officially but that if he wished to visit Kuwait as a private perspn the town was open to him - and went out hawking. The Egyptian visit has so far not been made. 3. I made it quite clear to tha Shaikh that although 1 did not suspect him of double-dealing I put no trust whatsoevor in Izvat, and that if the latter was mistaken for the ohaikn a representative by ill-informed people the consequences might be awkward. The Shaikh assured^me that Izzat had no authority to speak on his behalf and that he had no evidence that he had ever tried to do so. but he promised to give Izzat a 'talking- lo' and to make certain that*the young man is under no mis apprehension as to the position he holds.

In a conversation I had recently with Izzat Jaffar since his return from America he mentioned to me that he was receiving #1,000 a month from Aminco. .ftien I asked him for details,' he said that it had bean His Highness' wish that he should receive some reward for his work in the negotia tions, but Kemp had been against including anything in the text of the Concession itself. After the signature, there fore, It had been verbally agreed that he should receive #1,000 a month, an agreement which he claimed was known only to the Shaikh, Mr. Kemp and Mr. Isenberger: he also said he had not drawn any of this money yet. 3. Although Izzat Jaffar claims this salary is entirely for past benifits and he will not be expected to render any definite services to Aminco, I suspect that it is really in the nature of a retainer fee, and Aminco will certainly try to use Izzat Jaffar more than Abdulla Kulla in their deal ings with His Highness, even though Kemp managed to get the latter appointed the official Local itepresentative.

Jafar was eventually expelled from Kuwait on the basis of these allegations and the correspondence in the file discusses this and his subsequent return to the country.The majority of the correspondence in the file is between British officials of the Middle East Intelligence Centre in Cairo, the Political Agency in Kuwait and the Political Residency in Bushire.The file also contains copies of letters that were exchanged between Jafar and an Iraqi government official who was being held in a British internment camp following Britain's invasion and military occupation of Iraq in 1941. These letters are in Arabic and accompanied by English translations (folios 100-106).In addition to correspondence, the file also contains an April 1941 issue of
                           Radio Araba di Bari, the monthly magazine of the Italian Government's Arabic language radio station, Radio Bari (folios 64-81) and a translation of an article about Kuwait that was published in
