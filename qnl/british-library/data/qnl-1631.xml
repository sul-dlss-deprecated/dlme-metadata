The tov/n of i3iremi with its adjacent villages of Hamasah etc formely belonged to the Sultan of Muscat and was under oohar but became independent^/ or semi-independ- -ent in Saiyid Faisal T s time.The Shaikh was Zaid bin Khali- -fah an^Maimi,who himself and latterly his son and success- -or namdan bin Zaid used to visit the SultanfSaiyid Faisal 1 / / regularly once or twice a year and paid homage and received rewards,like the rest of the Omani Shaikhs. The present Sultan(Saiyid Taimur)neglected to carry on the old relations etc. The first neglect being that Faisal's death was not reported nor his oy.ti succession to the Sultanate and that displeased the tiaimi Shaikhs and estranged him. The present Shaikh Sultan bin 7 a id has for the last few years been sending and receiving presents to and Iron Ibn Saud whom he has now apparently invited to take possession or make a sort of protectors-te of ± 5 iremi. Last year bin Jiluwi,Governor of El Hassa(for Ibn oaud/is said to have collected Zakat from the neighbouring tribe of Yal-Bu-Shamie near Biremi but this time Biremi itself has surrendered and paid taxes,the Shaikh being left to rule as heretofore. Sohar on the coast of the interior of Oman being easily accessible through Biremi,this event is probably dangerous to the sultan's Govt, who,however,do not appear bO think much about it or show any signs of alarm or of being forewarned. j tonreYXTgyg-gp-rggarsnfry xsirSt SanrftxwTnrilr&amp;Yyatarttyx taka 1Cl^TCTaJ S^XJX^C^^oJ, t V O&amp;VlJXsL+i+li (?) iranslation of an extract from a letter dated the loth Moharram 1st August 1925 from Shaikh Zahir K.B.hasio, Sib. bin Omaiyir,Shaikh of Khoz,to y- l XXX XX X X XXX X xx x x X XX XX XX XXX As regards the party that passed through this place,they are the ^ani Yes or Dubai, Prominent amongst them were SAID BIN BAII BIN SUHAIl and SUHAIL BIN BATI BIN SUHAIL — the cousins of BA ID BIN JAKUM1 , chief of Duoai, \7e did jubcc not know them and tliey called here on their way to Kabul.

I have not heard that Shaikh Isa is making preparations to proceed towards Dhahirah and Baraimi. I do not think he can raise any expedition to fight against the supporters of Bin Saud. Even if he wishes to collect a force,^ he will be confronted with the arms difficulty. There is(dearth of arms in the interior of Oman. How- about half the population is without arms. Many beduins out of pecuniary difficulty sold their arms. The rifles found in Oman at present are of Sama 'kind.

There appears no doubt at ell that the Alliance did take place in Muharram 1344 19P5 as was reported by us , and that Shaikh Said bin Maktum has simply evaded to -tell the truth to the Residency Agent.Sharqa. Every body knows it by now. The following extract the 29th October 1925, contributed by Shaikh Sulaiman Pasha Beruni from* Q,ebil-- the Head full details about the alliance. In Muharram 1344-- the month of treaties there called here in Qabil,capital of Sharqiah province, a deputation headed by Shaikh Said and Shaikh Suhail sons of the late Shaikh Bati. They presented to Shaikh Isa bin Salih the Chief of Sharqiah a mare and a letter from their uncle Shaikli *aid bin Mgktum, chief of Dubai, who wrote it jointly with Shaikh Sultan bin Zaid the Chief of Abu Dhabi, strengthening the chord of union and laying down the course of iro f dated quarters of Shaikh £**** I sa bin Salih gives joint action in case anybody attacked the country either from the sea d side or from the land. side. Similar deputations were received from Al Dhahirah and the Shaikhs of Al JAALAtf. '' P.T.O.. ''hether Isa bin Salih and other Oiranis are nervoVis of Bin Spud. Orren and trucisl Ompn are showing egns of being nervous-of Bin Spud. At Dubai pn Arab of Zubeir spoke an ill WO rd about Bin Spud,and the Shaikh of Dubai immediately deported him from his country, ihie certainly is a sure sign of nervousness. Besides there is a stir among the tribes of the Interior Omen and of the Trucial Omen to £h± unite and the present expedition of- Shaikh Isa bin &gt;~alih .Chief of Sherqieh . and of Imam Muhammad bin Abdulla al Khalili, to Ibri and el Dhahirah is chiefly with this secret object to gauge tne strength of their adherents and friends. Rsc Possibility of Rapprochement. Soon after the Agents of Bin Spud visited BABAIMI and recovered tax from some tribes, Shat Shaikh Isa bin Splih in his letter to F.B.Nasib put a very clever question ' Would the British Gov give us arms and ammunitions*’. As he received no encouragement the matter has remained untouched xxhekxx ^Rapprochement is possible but xr Shaikh Isa bin Salih and almost all tribes of since - think no serious move will be made till the Omanis realize that Bin Spud really mean I think / to invade OmanP.A. 3c-/t Ze Sx^e^ltion t o P M h jXEJa a nd,, . B_e r g fc/m Shaik?i Iss bin Splih Seems to have started th£L_ expedition with the following objects:-* IBRI . About 9 months ago A 1 l^unazarah who used to live at Ibri murdered Sultan bin Rashid,Sheikh of A 1 Yueoib, Abdullah bin Rashid the present Shaikh punished the A 1 lainazerah for murderin his brother . He destroyed their house and gardens , killed some and turned out the others. Al Munazarah went and complained to Shaikh Isa bin ^alih and begged him to re-instate them at IBRI. Shaikh Isa tried but failed to impress the al Yuaoib by correspodance. On arrival at ikrx Duraiz, and Axrxx AINAIN, he again addressed the al v uaqib nobody excejjt Suleiman bin Humaiyir, Shaikh Bani Riyam ( Head of the Ghefiri News has reached today that Sulaiman bin Humaiyir has arrived at the scene a and that an agreement is being patched up between Al Munazarh and Al Yuaqib.

About 8 months ago rhslf bin Sinan, Shaikh of BANI ALI at YANQAL was killed by one of his relations and Khalifsh bin Hilal became Snaikh. Sulaiman bin Sinan, brother of the deceased approached Shaikh Isa bin Salih and the Imam and asked them to restore the Sheikhdom of Bani All to him. This Suliaman bin Sinan married the daughter of Shaikh Isa bin Salih anH t K u aiin and also servesylT ¥ali Of the upper part of Ibri( under Shaikh Isa bin Sal and Imam eS) ^hKxSajiixAiixxxix&amp;scjmawisttoixxxdtHXHBtxiikR After settling the trouble at Ibri, Shaikh Isa will take up the Yanqal question.. The Bani Ali ( who are Hannawiah ) anticipating trouble have esked the help of Ghafiriah tribes and it is said that BANI OKER, BANI KALBAN, and BUS HAMAS have .fight e promised to .pTor Bani Ali in case Shaikh Isa takes aggressive measures against them. The Bam Ali 0 f Yanqal do not pay any tax to the Sultan of Muscat but they remain on friendly relations. If however Shaikh Isa succeeds in appointing Suleiman bin Sinan as Shaikh of Bani All of Yanqal, that town and its surrounm^s will pass into the influence of the Imam and Shaikh Salih. S&amp;ham port is near to Yanqal. The present Shaikh of Yanqal addressed the Council of Ministers, Muscat, amtx for help and the latter promised to help him in case of necessity. best week or so may clear up Isa's intentions aboyt Yanqal and Bani Ali. Shaikh(3). To occupy Dhahir&amp;h and establish 0 military f centre at Baraimi. against BI” S©ud. This has been kept secret by Shaikh Isa but the alliance made between the Shaikhs of Trucial Oman and Shaikh Isa bin Salih on behalf of Imam in Muharram 1344 July 192b indicated the move, and now an article from the pen of Shaikh Suleiman Baruni dated Qabil, 27th Safer ±9.&amp;x 1344 oex-tember 1925, published in a Ceirjb Daily ASH-SHOURA dat ed the 29th Oct 1925 received in -useet this week, makes the matter very clear. He writes ' The Imam is preparing to proceed personally to Dhahirah and Baraimi ( near Dubai) to put in order the forts and to make it a centre of military strength for that part so that if anything hapj-ens from the seaside or landside organized force, rations and ammunitions be / despatched there. The world will nodoubt hear that H.H.the Sultan Taimur will do what is necessary in the interests of the country and will approve the action of the Imam.' ' In Oman from Dhofar to Qatar there are no less than half a million persons armed with T u rkish, German, and English arms, and each man has his o//n camel and his own ration. When a gun is fired - a ^ ass emble sign to for fighting, within 4 hours an army will be ready' ^the It is stated that y^mam has also arrived and the party after settling the troubles at Ibri and Yenqa will proceed, to Baraimi.

Shaikh Rashid showed me a letter received by him from the Imam’s representative at Ru^taq, to the effect that Shaikh Isa bin Salih has not as yet succeeded in getting Shaikh % Abdullah bin Rashid *aqubi. Shaikh of Ibri ; to submit to* his terms, but that negotiations are still in progress. Shaikh Abdullah bin Rashid and his tribe A1 Yuaqib do not wish al ttunazarah to return to Sidaif from where they k were turned out some months ago for their treacherous and V rderous conduct. ■ But Shaikh Isa’s object is ((/ \re-establish them i.e. A1 Munazarah at Sidaif under an amicable settlement with'al Yuaqib.' Sidaif is a settlement near ibri and under the jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Ibri. Shaikh Rashid thinks that Shaikh Isa bin Salih is confronted with great difficulties. If he fails to impose his proposed arrangement at Ibri, it will mean that Imam's prestige will be extremely damaged so far the province of Dhahirah is concerned. If however a fighting takes place, in view of the present division tribes , it is probble that Shaikh Isa may lose the battle, because the tribe 'a 1 Darua ' of Tanam (Ghafiriah) who had promised to support Shaikh Isa and who number about 2000 have now played false and refused to support Him. It is estimated that Shaikh Isa bin Salih has about 2000 supporters as follows: A1 Hirath 100. A1 HijriyinJLoo. Miscellaneous, 100* Sons of Eilal bin Zahir , of lani Hana, 50. Sons of Shaikh Uasir bin Kuiaaid of Jabrain near 3ahlah. 50. Ban i Ruwaihah. 150. Wadi Rustaq (Nasir bin Rashid *3 followers) 300. Ahl Wuhaibah 150. The above from Sharqiyah and Kustaq. Arabs od Diriz and Ainain 500. Miyah. A1 Munazarah. (the cause of trouble ) 400 . Total about 2000. Against this Shaikh Abdullah bin Hashid al Yaqubi has the following supporters* Yuaqib 1000 . Bani Kalban 1000 -Eani Shakail 500. Jahawar. 500. Ealucfes of Anbi. 300. Total about 3300. If Shaikh Isa bin Salih seeks help from the Sani Yas i. e . people of Dubai and Sharqah who are Eannawis , then the * important tribes of Baraimi Al Naim, lani qitab, and Dani Kaab ^ ar£ S11 Ghafiris help the Al Yuaqib .After Shaikh Kashid I saw the Wali of Matrah. The ■ V/ali showed me a letter he had just received from the V/ali of Musnah. It showed that Shaikh Isa hin Salih and the Imam are still at Dariz and A&amp;ulk Aiman Ainain and that the Ihri trouble is not settled as yet. It is believed that Sulaiman bin Humai^ir f s heart is with al Yuaqib , although he has come to help Shaikh Isa bin Salih and the Imam. The Wali of Matrah thinks that Shai&amp;h !sa is trying to come to amicable terms v/ith the Ibri people, more specially because his real object is to unite all tribes of Oman against lin Saud.

According to what 1 have heard the raiders are coming to that district with a great number of men that the chiefs consist of Khorusi, Hamiyar and Isa bin Saleh Al-Harithi; that they have occupied two towns named Bait- ul-Ainain and Driz and they are at present besieging a town called Ibri which is not far away from Braimi; it is only a day and half a day’s march distant from that place. Muhammad bin Sultan, the Shaikh of Braimi, I hear, has sent letters to Bedouins such as the Beni Ka’ab, Beni Katab, the Shaikhs of D e bai, Shargah, Ajman, Umm-ul-Qaiwain and Ras-ul-Khaimah informing them of onset of the Shaikhs mentioned in the preceding paragraph and their objectives. The Shaikhs(addressed to)have not done anything nor they have replied to the Shaikh of Baraimi. But the current rumour is that the two Bedouin tribes shall assist the Shaikh of Baraimi to fight the Khorusi and those with him should they try to occupy Baraimi. Whatever there may happen later on, same shall be communicated to you in due time.

The Shaikh describee how Tea bin Saleh got possession of Al Alnain and Tbri and put jarrlsone into theae places In the name of the Imam. The agitation among the Chafirl tribesmen would appear to have been led by one ^aid bin of Al Ainain. The fort at a! Alnain had been left in charge of the son of Isa bin ouleh with 15 men. He went to see his father s&gt; Ibri # and left only five men in the fort. These men 3aid bin Mohamad invited to drink ooffee at his house and when the fort was empty^he seized it. This led to the Shoikh of Ibri demanding hio fort book,and Shaikh Sulalman bin Hamlyar's defection as already reported. 3* ^he Shaikh of Phunk reports in his letter that the Imam declared he would resign as his title of Imam of Oman was evidently an empty one,as half Oman refused to obey hira.He has.however been }&gt;er«u&amp;ded to remain ae Liaw for three months more* 4* The uhaiiih of .Phank T/riteo further tiiat the ^hcJllchs of iiahrsiml have sent 'a iaan like HXn liahroah a! bu iihama of the Auiad Multan** to lb^|f ^aud aokln^ him to oorie to Jiahraiml* In tills connection he exclaims 'And Xo # how a peraon enjoying honour becoiaes a procurer for his own wlfe«3ut ^4#, men h; ve becone extinct from the centre of Arabs'• 6* The haikh also writes that while Tea bin &gt; &amp;leh was at Tbri a further Agreement was made between him and the Ahuikh of Dubai.

P.A. u 7- I submit herewith a translation of a letter of the Shaikh of Dhank to the address of the Council of Ministers, from v;hom I took it to show to you. The letter/ gives some details about the Imam’s Dhahirah expedition and relates 1. that the Imam resigned and has been request to hold on for three months. 2 . that another agreement was cemented between the Shaikhs of Dubai and the Imam during the latter*'s last visit to Ibri. 3. that Al Naim hx tribe of BARAIFI have despatched another messenger to BIN SAUD calling him to CUan. 11 As instructed I have consulted the •Vali of K&amp;trah about this letter and asked his views about the real cause of the failure of Imam’s expedition and about the other items. The Wali is of the opinion that the letter gives correct det-.ilr. He ad.de that Shaikh Isa ha4N taken over the Ainain forts from £ a id k uhammad al Ghafrio Shaikh -^ga then -went to al and there fell ill. Hi S SO n who with 15 Agkiris was occupying the Ainain forts went to see his father leaving 5 ^skifig in the forts. The ^hafiris invited the 5 Askirig to ooffee. When the forts were entirely vacant , -the Said bin Muhammadro ^coupled then. Iraraediately after Sulaiman bin Humaiyer who was put in charge of the Ibri forts declared that he could not continue in the position as the Ibri people who were his tribesmen being Ghafiris would blame him in view of what had taken place at Ainain, The Imam was displeased and returned % back and Shaikh isa being ill was also carried back. The Wali believes that there is no doubt that Said bin Muhammad acted with the connivance if not with the instigation of Sulaiman bin Humaiyer. The Ghafiris ,he holds, did not cooperat with the Imam from their heart and were merely keeping their face. This is the real cause of the failure of the expedition,, The Imam he says has agreed to hold his office for three months only and on the expiry of the period , the tribes will either make a new xkkx selection, or will tender to him full allegiance. The Imam got disgusted with the trick played by the Ghafiris. The Wali thinks that BIN SAUD* s movementVmay take place when he is more free from his engagements in Hejaz&lt;/(/ n Translation of a letter dated the 15th Jamadi ath Thani 134 4 1 st January 19^6 from Hama.d bin Ahmad al Yahyai, Shaikh of Dhanak, in Dhahirah,Oman, , to the Council of I r inisters to H.H.the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx After Compliments, You must have learnt all that took place in Dhahira on the recent m^rch of the Oman Covt to this side, ^t is not possible to record all that took place* On their arrival the Shaikh of Dariz interviewd them and handed to them the al AINAIN. Then the Chief of Ibri was addressed. A party of AL NAIM tribe went to Ibri in order to help the Chief of that place. I was with them. Shaikh Suleiman bin Hamyer tried to arrange amicable terms between the parties. He sent us to induce the Shaikh of Ibri to give an interview. He advised the Chief of Ibri to send away the Ghafris from him. None remained with him except AL NAIM tribe. The Ibri people turned against their Shaikh. He consulted Al Naim and they and the Shaikh of Ibri accepted our views. The Shaikh came up and showed allegiance. He handed over to the Oman Govt his town.. Thus the Oman Govt took possession of all the places. Then SAID BIN MUHAMMAD of AL AINAIN played a. trick and turned away the Imam’s garrison from * his town. The Imam disliked to keep some places and leave the other. He returned Ibri too to its Chief, on his former bait i.e. allegiance M The town is Imam’s ”? After five days the Shaikhs of Dariz and Ibri met together end made an alliance against the Imam, so that to attack the Imam on his return . They stopped the MUNAZARAH from building their houses. The Munazirah joined AL DARU tribe. Thus the work of Imam in Dhahirah became just like dust carried away by a strong wind. The secret is known to God alone. As regards Shaikh Isa bin Salih he was carried on shoulders from AINAIN to BAHLA where he became a bit better. The IMAM, however, on his arrival at NAZTA rresigned his ITArSHIP. But people assembled round him and asked him to wait for three months. The solution of the difficulties is in the hands of God. The NAIF tribe on their return ( to BARAIFl) consulted about Bin SAUD. They sent a man like BIN kAHTSTTV of thExr ±TxkE tax AULAD SULTAN, to Bin £&gt;aud , calling him to BARA I FI. Te told-them not to adopt that course. And Lo ,how a person enjoying honour, becomes a procurer for his own wife. But alas men have become extinct from the centre of Arabs. However,whoever arrives from Hasa relates that for the last three months KBHtxKMBMX BIN Saud is asking Bin Jalwi.the Governor of Hpsa, to send reinforcements continuously, and those who go never return, alone God know the ends of affairs. As regards Shaikh Khalifah bin Hi lei ( of Fpnqal) there was trouble between him and Al Naim,but we mediated by the Grace of God the differences ere patched up. 7/hen the Imam reached Ibri, there took place between him and the people of Coast ( Trucial Oman) agreements that in case the man pounces from the west ( Bin Saud ) then they ( T ruc i a p Oman Chiefs) would help him ( the Imam). This xxxx is what has come to our knowledge. Tfe pray God that the result be good. And ^alams to you and to those you like. From here xhk sons and brothers of Khalifah give you compliments. Spiyid Muhammad bin Fuharnirad bin Turky ( nephew of Sultan) sends you salams. Perhaps you have heard that there was some trouble between Khalifah bin Hilal and Bani Omer ( at Yanqal) but we have stayed it for the present. Khalifah wished to attack Bani Omer.

Sir, I have the honour to forward for your information the following news received from the Council of Ministers on the present situation at Sohar Saiyid Hamad, Wali of Sohar, wrote to the Council oJ t Ministers that he was informed by Sheikh Salim bin Dian, Sheikh of Bani Kaab, that Sheikh Abdullah, Sheikh of A1 Muqabil, who occupies and guards the fortifications at Wadi Shakairi, bordering DhaMirah and Sohar, had intrigued with Abu Sondah, the Agent of Muhammad and Saqar sons of Sultan bin Muhammad of Baraimi, ?ind Governor of Zank, to hand over the fortifications to him. In consequence Saiyid Hamad proposed to the Council of Ministers to turn out the Sheikh oJ Muqabil from the fortifications and to replace him by .dani Omar tribe and requested their support* The Council of Ministers replied to him on the 9th October that no action should be taken on the report received by him without first finding out the truth and that in their opinionlt was improbable that the Muqabil Jdagcx would play \ false to the Muscat State: that in the matter of loyalty they consideredconsidered Bani Omar far less reliable than the Muqabil. The • Council of Ministers also stated that ac the place wau chiefly populated by the Muqabil It would be impossible for Saiyid Hai to hold it in o&gt;position to that tribe. They impressed upon him to use his tact and avoid trouble as the present state of finances would not permit of undertaking any x expenditure on on expedition.

To discuss the matter, members of the Bani Yas tribe from Dubai visit Shaikh ‘Isa bin Salih in his home town al-Qabil (mistakenly referred to in the file as Kabul).The Political Agent at Muscat reports to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, on internal affairs taking place in various towns that belong to the regions of al-Dhahira, al-Dakhiliyya and al-Sharqiyya of Oman.
