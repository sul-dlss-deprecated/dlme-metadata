The subject is the status of the diplomatic relationship between the British Government and Sa‘īd bin Sultān Āl Sa‘īd, the Imam of Muscat; the British are willing to co-operate with the Imam in operations to suppress piracy, but are unwilling to get involved in wars between Muscat and other regional powers, such as the Wahhabi. The correspondence in the file, and its various enclosures, is intended to guide and inform the Resident's future conduct and decision making with regard to the Imam of Muscat.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Bombay, Political and Services Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Thomas Perronet Thompson</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Shaikh of the Āl Jalāhimah tribe Raḥmah bin Jābir Āl Jalāhimah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Kateef</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Wahhābīyah</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00000a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
