From - The Hon'ble Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Loch, I.A., i Officiating lolitical Resident in the Persian 4 Gulf, To - His Majesty^ Secretary of State for India, ( The India Office, London. Sir, I have the honour to enclose a translation of a letter dated the 22nd Rabi al Awwal 1353 (5th July 1934) from His Highness Saiyid Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat and 'Oman, to the folitical Agent, Muscat, regarding his desire to arrange for further eaqploration for minerals, especially oil, in his territories. 2. The Political Agent reports that at a recent meeting with him His Highness the Sultan expressed his earnest desire for a further survey to be carried out. He • j pointed out to His Highness that neither the exploration carried out by the Anglo-rersian Oil Company nor the geological information furnished by Lees (see paragraph 9 of Muscat Biary Ho*l of 1926) gave much hope of petroleum being discovered, whilst the coal discovered by Sir Percy Cox in the Sur hinterland was too far off to be a market able proposition. His Highness was not, however, deterred from the idea and requested thathe might be permitted to make his own arrangements if Government were unable to put forward a Company. The Political Agent did not think it advisable/advisable at this stage to remind Hie Highness that by- treaty he was unable to grant concessions without the sanction of His Majesty's Government. 3. He adds that His Highness's desire for a Company other than the Anglo-irersian Oil Company to carry out the survey is prompted, he considers, more by a desire to have a second opinion from a fresh source than to exclude the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. 4. The position at present is that His Highness the Sultan is bound by an undertaking, given in 1902, that he would not grant a concession for working the coal fields in the hinterland of Sur to any foreign government or Company until an opportunity had been given to the British Government of undertaking the work in conjunction with the Sultan him self (Treaties, Sanads and engagements. Aitchison. Volume XI, pages 283 and 318) 5 and by an undertaking,given in 1923, that he would not exploit, or give permission for exploiting, petroleum in his territories without consulting the Political Agent and without the approval of the Government of India (Treaties, Sanads and Engagements. Aitchison. Volume XI, pages 284 and 319)* 5. In the winter of 1925-26 the Anglo-Persian Oil company carried out a preliminary^ exploration under the terms of the concession obtained by them in 1925(see Lieutenant- Colonel Crosthwaite's despatch No .13 dated the 6 th June 1925 to His Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, a copy of which was sent to the Government of India under Residency endorsement No.lGO^S of the same date), but I do not know whether the Company were able to form any definite conclusions, and it is possible that they may still be interested in that 1 area./- 3 - £ area* 6 It would be most unfortunate if American oil interests were to establish themselves in , Oman, as in that case it would not be easy, in spite of the undertakings given by the Trucial Chiefs, to prevent their absorbing the Trucial Coast and perhaps even «&lt;,atar. should be sounded with a view to finding out whether they would be prepared to proceed with their exploration in ‘Oman * and, if successful, to exploit oil there. If they are not prepared to do so, I think that every endeavour should be made to ensure that the exploration is carried out if possible by other British interests, with a view, in particular, to preventing ‘Oman falling into the hands of the Standard Oil Company of California. 8 .

We are also in agreement with the conditions which you have formulated as a necessary preliminary to the consent of His Majesty's Government being given to any options or actual concessions obtained by the Company and with the lines on which you propose to reply to Mr. Skliros’ letter as indicated in paragraph 10 of your letter. ^ /v ■ 2/0* yd &amp; ^ 3- As you know, we have always regretted that the Anglo Iranian Oil Company have their hands tied by the ’’Red Line” Agreement and are unable to compete for m Min»fc»twrninT*r nr frrTr- tt- flNM 1 1* '***'' ** concessions in the Persian Gulf as a purely British company.

Apart from the fact that there is no indication that the Burmah are prepared to consider a change in their traditional policy of not undertaking any commitments in this part of the world, I understand that their close connexion with the Board of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and Shell might make the position very complicated.

Sir, I hove the honour to refer to my predecessor’s *l^*letter No.C/188 dated 10th July 1934 with which was enclosed a letter from the Sultan asking for a further mineral exploration to be carried out in Muscat territory. the subject ancr stated that he was anxious to hove a further thorough survey carried out to clear up beyond i .. . - H , doubt the possibilities of oil being present or not in his State. I pointed out that one survey had been already Made by the Anglo Persian Oil Company in 1925 and the report of their geologists was that there were not sufficient indications of oil to warrant on exploration what had happened at Bahrain and said that if the Anglo Persian Oil Company had been wrong in their estimation of the position at that place and another Company had come along and succeeded in finding oil, he saw no reason why the same thing should not happen in Muscat. 4.

No. C/201 November 27, 1935. 3 r Please refer to my official letter No. C/200 of date. 2. In this connection,! think I should bring the following matter to your notice for any action you may consider advisable. There is a certain Captain Dewhurst of the British India Steam Navigation Company, at present Master of the Slow Gulf Mail Steamer 'Barpeta' - a somewhat garrulous busy-body, whom you may have come across yourself. This individual considers himself on terms of intimate friendship with the Sultan on the strength of having carried him a few times in his ship to and from Muscat. *uite recently in the course of a casual conversation Captain Dewhurst told me that he had been talking to the Sultan about the possibility of finding oil in Muscat territory, according to Dewhurst the Sultan declared that the .^nglo-Persian Oil Company had tried and failed to find oil in his State but that he would like some other Company to make another attempt. Dev/hurst went on to say that he then informed the Sultan that he knew the very man man to act as a negotiator i.e. Major Frank Holmes, of Bahrain The Hobble Lieut-Colonel T.C. Fowle, C.B.E., Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, B U 3 H I H Eand Kuwait fame, and that on the Sultan»s return from Dhofar he would arrange a meeting between him and His Highness. I gathered that the Sultan in a non-committal way had replied that he would be pleased to meet Holmes. On hearing all this I said quietly and tactfully to Dewhurst that such matters were the exclusive concern of the British Political authori iO-IRAN !v ties in the Gulf under the control of the Political Hesident. Dewhurst did not take my remark in very good part and declared somewhat excitedly that he saw no reason why the Sultan should not negotiate with whom he pleased in matters effecting his own State. I said I was not prepared to discuss the matter with him and shortly after broke off the conversation. 3. On one or two occasions previously this same Dewhurst has shown a tendency to criticise and mix himself in with Political arrangements in the Gulf but these were of a petty nature and I did not consider you would wish to be troubled with them. The present one is, however, on a different footing and I hope you will see your way to bring the matter to the notice of the British India Steam Navigation Company's Managing Agents in Bombay and have instructions given to Dewhurst to confine his activities in the Gulf to shipping and the legitimate interests of his company*MjL OOKM’tfrHCATIOItS TO n£ ADDMfleitD TO TW* J CP^*' ^ U* '♦*' J~ ^-IRANIAN OIL COMPANY, LIMITED, LONDON AND ABADAN 'TT j UjJu y\*S •jij'p a-«t j OjJ. n f • 4( J* ♦it' , * v » Telegraphic Address ; “ANGLIRAN,” CONFIDENTIAL.

I must say that Sa’id bin Baktum has been of greet help in bringing Shakhbut to reason. KhaIifah bin Zaid, the uncle, Hamad al Khalaf, Ahmad bin ^uti, Shakhbut ! s mother, ere all keen that he should come to terms with us, and I hope soon to be eble to inform you of my having been successful, hakhbut has been asking me if - why Government had held up his pay of Hs.400/~ for the use of Yes Island and the Ibu Dhabi aerodron^.

This question, although not at present urgent, is bound sooner or later to arise if oil is discovered. We note’that Mr. Skliros stated in his J v letter of the 24th October that the provisions of the c^atar p' Govt, agreement would be generally acceptable to the new Company. As you know, this agreement (like that for Koweit) deals^ith the question of a refinery in a somewhat unsatisfactory manner by a mere declaration of intention on the part of the Company to erect a refinery if commercial conditions justify it, and to examine the matter with H.M. Government when commercial production is assured. £ Every new concession granted in countries bordering the Persian Gulf accentuates the importance of m i ''Wi—»Mf t i** ■ Kittic- MM 'Tt^i MWTIfrd i.i» •W'.-// the refinery question and it would be most unfortunate if the greater part of the territory were developed without any binding obligation on the part of the Company to build at least one refinery. We do not think that the relaxation of our requirements in this respect in the ^atar and Kcweit concessions, in each case after long discussion with the “&amp;fee 0 - B - M -°- C ” P ' lnl£S/ S.W. 1.’2 / companies, Is a good reason for accepting the same position without further discussion in any future concessions. We feel, therefore, that new draft concessions should contain the approved standard refinery clause and that any relaxation should he agreed to only when good reasons are forthcoming. We do not suggest that there is any necessity to raise thekatter in this form with the Company at the present stage, but in view of Mr. Skliros 1 reference to the Qatar agreement we think it desirable that the Company should be reminded that the erection of a refinery or refineries in territory under British influence in the Persian Gulf is one of the prime desiderata of H.M. Government. Perhaps, therefore, you would be good enough to include such a reference in your reply. Ajfart from the foregoing we have no comments to offer on your proposed action. Copies of this letter are being sent to Air Vice Marshal Courtney, Bendel and Starling. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) E.A. SEAL.Copy.

My dear Walton, With refeiWce to your letter of November 4th, No. P.Z.7763/35, enclosing copy of a letter from the Managing Director of the Iraq Petroleum Company, concerning the formation of a new Company known as Petroleum Concessions Limited, as a subsidiary Comp? ny of the Iraq etroleum Company to acquire oil concessions in the ersian Gulf area, I had, just before I received your letter, been informed by Mr. Skliros o*’ this new development, on much the same lines as in his letter to you. 2 ' e had rather hoped at one period, in view of our special interests in the Persian Gulf, that an arrangement might have been come to within the Iraq Petroleirn Company by which the Anglo-Irenian Oil Company and the Shell Group might have been allowed to take up some o^ these concessions. The formation of the new Co pany makes it clear that the French and merican groups have not been willing to agree to this. While we may from some points of view regret this decision, the new development has the advantage that we can, I tLink, now be sure that a Company v/ith very substantial British interests will be available to counter the quite serious threat of further penetration in this area by purely American concerns such as the Standard Oil Company of California, and as I know of no substantial purely British Company which is prepared to go into this area, this is all to the good. possibility of an arrangement between the Iraq Petroleum Con any Iton, Esq., C.B., ndia Office, Whitehall, 3.W.I. You refer in the third paragraph of your letter to theand the Standard of California in the marketing of Bahrein oil removing the deadlock in the Kuweit Neutral Zone. But recent efforts to come to an arrangement have broken down. This, I think, may have the result of stimulating the action of the new Company in these Persian Gulf areas. I am interested to see that Mr. Skliros is inclined to take up an option for the remainder of Bahrein. T ere may not be much left that is very valuable on the main island but perhaps the shallow waters and other islands may be worth investigating. Subject to necessary safeguards such as you refer to in paragraph 7 of your letter, I think we should encourage the Company to go ahead #ith their plans. ^ As regards paragraph 8, I was not present at the meeting of the Middle East Sub-Committee when the policy in regard to the Trucial Coast vies discussed but I have since seen the record of the meeting and I think that here again, provided proper arrangements such as you suggest are made, we ought not to bar this territory from investigation. (' I have already dealt above with the point you raise in paragraph 9. I agree with paragraphs 10 and 12 of your letter. In regard to paragraph 11, we do not much like the selection of Major Holmes as the Company^ Representative for the negotiation of concessions. It will, however, have the adv: ntoge of putting an end to his activities on behalf of less substantial and speculative concerns. This was an aspect of the situation which, no doubt, weighed with the Company in appointing him, but from t at point of view we shall also benefit. And he is undoubtedly experienced in conducting negotiations with the Sheikhs and Rulers of the territories concerned. \ I am sending a copy of this letter to Rendel, Seal and Air Vice-Marshal Courtney.

My dear Mr. Williamson, .‘-i.fter compliments. Negotiations were carried out on the current subject between me and you, but we have not specified the places that are in partner ship between self and my cousins. ie have not either specified our island, namely ,, Tunb ,f which is a place like a heart to the body, lying betv/een Oman and Iran. You informed me verbally that Tunb was meant to come in the agreement; really sneaking this'information has hurt me. ^e had not thought it important at the time to mention it, and moreover under cover of our letter dated 4th Shaban 1354, we drew the attention of the Company to the said places and our island Tunb, both of which have not been surveyed by the geologists. Has the Company any intention to survey these parts or are they satisfied with the places already surveyed in the past. If the Company has any intention to carry out this, then we have to make a separate agreement, on the lines of the previous one; the places surveyed by the geologists are the places specified under the wording 'bu r territory an d surroundings' as laid down in the agreement. This matter has been communicated to the Political agent. If you are under the impression that the case is just as you have hinted to us, we are prepared to return back the money of the Company before commencement of the work.

(3) To obtain extensions of existing options from the . Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast. ^ ^ I have not received a ny information with regard to, the .first t^ items. i'th fe^arci to une third, it would appear that tlie indention is tRat Holmes shduld' endeavour to negotiate extensions of the present options to 5 years and that these exte'nsibns shoulc. include the terms of defi- nite concessions oi 75 years which the Company could take up at any time it wished during the currency of the options. It is not apparently proposed to make any formal transfer o± the existing options to P.C.L. as the latter, being an associated Company of ours, is entitled to negotiate with the Bheikhs under the terms of the options. It is assumed also that there is no necessity to convey K.U.d*s approval /of the existing options to the Sheikhs before Holmes proceed to the T-Uhial Coast. ' The proceduo-e in Ldhdon v;as thtt Holmes should approach the Sheikhs with letters of introductions from you in which, it is suggested, the Sheikhs could be informed that H.L.O. approves of the options already granted to us and is agreeable to further negotiations under these options being conducted by Holmes as a representative of P.C.L. I understand the India Office have been communicated with on this point and they will no doubt mention it should they write to you on the subject generally. ? Holmes will also, of course, have letters of introductions from us to the Sheikhs in which the latter will be informed that he represents P.C.L. an associated Company of ours wit.h v/hnm. wo t.-pnot they will be able to negotia agreements. December in which you officially informed us of E.L.G’s approval of the options obtained up to that time subject to certain conditions, I gather that the India Office have prescribed identical conditions for P.C.L. who have accepted them. It is not clear from the letters 1 have received, hov/ever, whether the India Office have approved of P.C.L. proceeding to negotiate extensions of the present options or new concessions with the Sheikhs, or whether, if such approval has been given, the conditions necessary to safeguard Government inte rests have been considered. J^Until the position is clearer, therefore, I am not replying to your letter Ho.1055* If all arrange ments have been made direct between the India Office and P.C.L., I presume these points have been covered and there should be no necessity for further corres pondence here. throw light on any points such as the above v/hich are at present somewhat obscure. He was due to leave England on the 23 rd of January, but was going to spend some time in Cairo on his way. I understand he will be visiting you soon after his arrival and that he hopes to complete all his w ork in three or four months. I think he ^ './ith regard to your Holmes on his arrival will no doubt be able toproposes starting with the Kuwait job and does not anti cipate being' ready to start for the Trucial Coast until about the beginning of Liarch.

The original agreement (see Captain Cole^ letter C /427 August 7th, 1955) reads 'I have authorized you to enter my country for the examination of mines of oil in my country of Ras al Khaimah and its surroundings which are under my government”. The essential Arab words are 'fi biladi Ras al Khaimah vai atrafiha alti taht hukumina”. Later in the agreement it is written ”1 have promised that I will not negotiate with any other company for mineral oil in my country of Ras al Khaimah. The essential words are ”fi biladi Ras al Khaimah”. I do not, of course, know what passed when the agreement was drawn up and it may be that the term was supposed to include Tunb Island. If so, a word like 'twabiha” (dependencies) Liil'lfB would have been more suitable. —40QS&amp;P- -&lt;M-480&gt;—26*7-34—2^)0,000.3* On the wording; of the agreement as it stands, I cannot help feeling doubtful whether it can be held to include Tunb Island. It would be possible, perhaps, to claim that in such an agreement the words 'biladi Has al Khaimah n should be interpreted as a general term covering all the Shaikh f s dominions (just as we speak and write of the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah). But in that case the words 'wa atrafiha alti taht hukumina' would be unnecessary, as the Shaikh could not sign away any area surround ing his dominions, so that they tend to support the Shaikh f s contention, and these v. r ords can hardly be interpreted to mean his island. 4. However the wording may be read, it is vague and I fear that the matter may become troublesome if the question of inter pretation is pressed# I am, therefore, inclined to suggest that the Company should be advised not to pursue the matter on paper, but to w r rite and say that Major Holmes (on the assumption that he is now in T oil ! charge of the Trucial Coast) will (if God is willing) visit Ras al Khaimah later on and discuss the matter with him (the Shaikh). I have little doubt that ^a. jor Holmes will be able to arrange the matter suitably# I think too that it is most inadvisable for us to be drawn into the controversy if it can possibly be avoided.

FINSBURY SQUARE, LONDON, E.C.2. 30th January, 1936. The Under Secretary of State, India Office, Whitehall, S.W.i. Sir, i\ I must apologise for the delay in^ckn owl edging your letter of the 12th December, 1935 (Z. 8856/35), a delay occasioned by the desire to send with this reply copies of the terms which it is proposed to offer to the various Rulers for concessions on their respective territ ories. (2) I assume that the conditions which His Majesty’s Government would attach to their recognition of the concessions in which my Company is interested are conditions similar to those embodied in the separate Agreements concluded between the India Office and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in respect of the Qatar Ooncessibn, and such - or similar - conditions my Company will accept, subject only to the observation that the refinery obligation if applied separately to each one of the concessions may introduce an altogether uneconanical burden. (3) Refineries. Nine concessions are involved, i.e. Neutral Zone, Bahrein, six on the Trucial Coast and Qatar; some of these must be barren, but assuming that oil were found on two, or even three, of them, it by no means follows that the amount of oil found on each concessionary area could support a refinery.I would, there!ore, propose that in accepting as applicable to all these concessions the provisions of Clause 9 of the Agreement of 5th June, 1935, between His Majesty’s Government and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Ltd. , relative to Qatar, there should be an understanding that not more than one refinery is in question for the Persian Gulf areaT - * (4T 1 enclose, in duplicate, copies of draft concessions for the Koweit Neutral Zone, Bahrein and the Trucial Coast. The Neutral Zone and Bahrein drafts differ somewhat from the Trucial Coast drafts. The drafts for Al-Ajman and Umm-al-Quaim will be similar to the drafts for the other areas in the Trucial Coast; the amounts payable will differ, but the other conditions are precisely the same in all the Trucial Coast drafts. It is my Company’s intention eventually to form separate companies for holding and working each one of these concessions, and provision is made in the drafts for the automatic transfer to such ad hoc British companies. I can agree to accept in the separate agreements, which my Company will be required to execute with the India Office, that the transfer can be effected only to such companies as are approved by the India Office, each Company in turn being required to enter into similar agreements, or you may hold the parent Petroleum Concessions company responsible for the due observance by these companies of all the terms of the said separate agreements. (5) The special conditions attached to the Trucial Coast (para.5 of your letter under reply) are accepted.(6) Major Frank Holmes, whose employment as negotiator has already oeen proposed, will arrive at Koweit towards the middle of February; he has been instructed to report to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and not to enter into any negotiations before he has obtained the Resident’s approval; he is to acquaint the Resident with the terms of the concessions, to keep him informed of progress, and of the final terms as agreed between him and the Rulers concerned, before he signs. I am at your disposal to review any of the conditions in the enclosed drafts, and to discuss such alterations as you may wish to propose. (7) MUSCAT• Major Holmes has been instructed to notify the Sheikh that he will be calling on behalf of my Company to discuss an oil concession during the course of the next two or three months; the terms will follow the lines of the Trucial Coast concessions. YFMFU■ I have requested from the Foreign Office permission for my Company to interest itself in a concession over the coastal area of the Immam’s territories, but I understand that this requires the concurrence of the Colonial Office, for which I shall be applying. The approval of the Resident at Aden will be sought before any negotiations are set afoot in that direction. (9) I shall be glad to have your approval to proceed on the above lines, and if it is not asking too much would you be so good as to notify accordingly the political Resident in the Persian Gulf, with copies of the various draft concessions, that it is proposed to offer to the severalRulers; I can let you have further copies if you require them. Yours faithfully, (Sgd . ) J.Skliros, Director.21 . 1 .

It seems possible, however, from what Shliros said to Bendel, that Petroleum Concessions Ltd. may propose to negotiate fresh five-year options, if they do, ouch a proposal will ol course have to be further considered, and in that case it might be best to deal first, and separately, with the approval of the existing options. ^• So far as Holmes is concerned, there would be no objection here, ii you see none, to any negotiations which may be approved between Petroleum concessions Ltd. and the Sheikhs being entrusted by the former to him. 1 sending a copy of this letter and enclosure to Metcalfe.'%■) p t 2.448/1936. f )fidential Britannic House, Finsbury Circus, London, E.C.2. 17 tii January, 1936. My dear Walton, Thank you for your letter of the 14th January, under reference P.Z.9314/35. I have passed a copy of this letter to Skliros, v/ho is actively engaged in discussing with Major Holmes the negotiation of further agreements in the Persian Gulf, on behalf of Petroleum Concessions, Ltd. In view of Holmes 1 engagement for these discussions we do not here propose to concern ourselves any further, other wise than as shareholders in n P.C.L. n , in negotiations in this area. IV ^ * I understand from Skliros that he will shortly be writing to you about the negotiations which Holpibs is to carry on, and in reply to your letter of the ^2th December last, of which you were good enough to send me a copy. Abadan have sent us on for instructions a copy of a letter from the Resident detailing the conditions to be accepted by the Company prior to the Residents approach to the shaikhs. These conditions reproduce those in paragraph 5(a/d) of your official letter of the 12th December to 'P.C.L.', omitting the reference to Baker, the American geologist, and we are instructing them that they should inform the Resident that P.C.L. (or subsidiaries of P.C.L. for each separate area) are taking over the options from us and contemplate the negotiation of concessions thereunder. In these circumstances it may be more convenient for the Resident to delay an approach to the Shaikhs pending receipt of your instructions regarding negotiations by Holmes Walton, Esq., C.B., M.C., India Office, Q W J_{ 2 . for P.C.L. Unless you think otherwise it has seemed to me an avoidable waste of effort for the Resident first to give H.M.Gr. l s approval to our options and subsequently to communicate with the Shaikhs again regarding H.M.G.'s approval of negotiations by Eolmes. It has seemed to me that one operation can cover the dual approval required. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) L. LEFROY.Enclosure in Foreign Office Note No. E.362/260/91 of 23rd January, 1936. m v 177 / 36. f COPY (E.362/260/91) PETHOLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED a! tne request of sir John Cadnian I h.ad an interview this morning with Mr. Skliros, Chairman of Petroleum Concessions Limited, which is the new Company formed by the Iraq Petroleum Company to acquire and develop concessions in the areas, other than Iraq, within the so called 'Red Line'. ^• Skliros began by giving me a detailed account of uhe genesis, activities and objects of the new Company. He told me little or nothing that I did not already know. He explained that one of the main reasons which had led to the formation of the new Company, which only differed from the old one in not having an Iraqi Director on the Board, was that the French authorities had objected to any Company with an Iraqi Director operating in Syria. This is no doubt true, but he admitted that it was also to the obvious advantage of the various groups concerned to keep the Iraqis out of their other activities, in the Gulf and elsewhere. Mr. Skliros then described the activities of Petroleum Concessions Limited in Qatar, Abu Dhabi and the other Trucial Sheikhdoms, and explained that their policy was to secure a series of 5-year options, by which they would obtain permission to carry out exploration for 5 years against a fixed annual payment, retaining an option at the end of that period to conclude a concession on agreed terms. This meant that there need be no further negotiations about the terms of any concession should the company decide to take up its option. But I gathered that the company was in no particular hurry to develop oil in any of these areas and merely/merely v/ished to prevent other concerns coming in and developing a nuisance value. 3. Mr. Skliros added that Petroleum Concessions Limited also hoped to conclude an agreement on similar terms with the Sultan of Muscat, where the prospects were favourable. 4. They might also consider trying for something on the same lines in Turkey, v/hither he might himself be proceeding in a few months 1 time. The Turks had, hov/ever, made it clear that they would not deal with any mere group of financiers who were taking up a concession to sell it again at a profit. They v/ould only deal with a concern capable of and ready to exploit any oil that might be found. 5. Mr. Skliros then gave me a very depressing account of the failure of the I.P.C. to take up either the Bahrein or the Hasa concessions. He explained that the Bahrein concession was originally taken up by the Gulf Oil Company of California, which was then a constituent group of the I.P.C. , and v/hich, therefore, in accordance with the provisions of the 'Red Line' Agreement, offered the concession to the I.P.C., who, however, refused to take it up, not believing that there was any oil in Bahrein. As a result the concession had eventually gone to a rival group, the Standard Oil Company of California, and the I.P.C. were now reduced to trying to obtain a concession for themselves at greatly enhanced terms for the small area in Bahrein not covered by the existing concession. 6. He also explained that Major Longrigg, who had been sent out to Jedda by the I.P.C. at the time of the Hasa negotiations, had obtained from Ibn Baud a clear statement of his terms, i.e. £50,000 gold in a cash payment in advance and a royalty of 4s. gold a ton on any oil eventually won. Mr. Skliros had apparently made a great effort to induce his Board/Board to agree to these terms, but they had, in spite of his advice, to the contrary, come to the conclusion that Ibn Baud was merely bargaining, and had instructed Major Longrigg not to rise above £30,000. As a result the concession had been lost to the standard Oil Company of California and most of the present troubles and difficulties had followed. I entirely agree with Mr. Skliros and concurred in his view that it was most unfortunate that the I.P.C. had lost this opportunity. (Incidentally had the I.P.G. obtained both the Rasa and the Qatar concessions we might have avoided all our present trouble about the Qatar-Saudi frontier - though I did not, of course, say this to Mr. skliros). 7. Mr. Skliros then came round to what was the main object of his visit - the possibility of his Company obtaining an oil concession in the Yemen. I am recording v this part of the interview separately (E.342/260/91). (Sd.) G.W. RENDE1. 20th January, 1936759/36 A . * t K'i /s*t&gt; IZTDIA OFFICE, W1ZITSI1ALL, S.W.l. 4th February, 1936. Dear Mr. Skliro^ We li^e received your official letter of 30th .January, enclosing a copy of draft concessions for the Koweit Neutral Zone, Bahrein, Fas al Xhaimah, Abu Dhabi, Debai and Sharjah. 2. V/e shall be sending an official reply to your letter after the necessary consultation with the other Departments concerned and the Poli ical Resident in the Persian Gulf. I am sending you this demi-official letter because there is a point of procedure in regard to the Trueini Coast negotiations which it seems desirable to get settled. 3* The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (or the D’Arcy Exploration Company) have obtained options from the Sheikhs of Ras al Khairnah, Sharjah, Debai and (as we learn from a telegram from the Political Resident of 1st February) Abu Dhabi and Ajman. The first step is to give approval to these options on the conditions set out Skliros, Esq_. &gt; i* 11 / Petroleum Concessions, Ltd. , City Gate House, E.C.2.ir, paragraph 5 of my letter of 12th Dece mber. One of these, conditio ns, .viz ., (c), has to he agreed to by the concerned, and it nill be deoirablo that the position in regard to the options should be clear to tunii when jo lone 1 Fowle approaches them in regard to condition (c). For this reason would it not be c onvenient th at as a first step - before Colonel Fowle approaches the Sheikhs - your Company should take over tne options from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and that tne position should'h^e^lained' to~the Sheik hs by that C ompany's representative in the Gulf or perheros hv~ Colonel Fowle, when he approaches the Sheikhs about condition (c) ? V/e have not got a copy of all tliese option agreements, but we have one of that concluded between the Sheikh of Ras al Khaitnah and the D'Arcy Exploration Company, in which I see that it is provided tAat the Cheikh will not negotiate with any other than that Company with regard to exploring for oil during the two years period of the option. If your Company now takes over the existing options at once and it is explained to the Sheikhs that this being done, the position would appear to be simplified. Colonel Fowle would/3. would not have to approach the Sheikh twice in regard to condition (c) - once as affecting the Anglo-Iranian Oil company and again as affecting your Company. Moreover the approval of the options obtained by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and of their transfer to your Company could be given at the same time. 4. Y/hen the options have been approved, we shall then have to consider the question of the approval of the opening of negotiations for actual concessions from the oheikhs concerned, as foreseen in (d) of paragraph 5 of my -Letter of xSth December. This question (in connection with which the draft concessions you have forwarded would be taken into consideration) must, I fear, necessarily occupy some little time, though we shall expedite it as much as possible. I am therefore wondering whether it would not be better to postpone for the present Major Holmes’s departure for the Gulf until the question of entering into negotiationsr for actual concessions from the Trucial Coast Sheikhs is further advanced. 5./5. I see that the Koweit Neutral Zone draft Is for a five-year option, but also for a concession if the Company declares its intention of taking one up. There ere, as you know, very special considerations in regard to the question of the Koweit Neutral Zone and the position is further complicated by the fact that the Saudi government is believed to be committed to another company. wimwwi wmhw ■Wrrn—m and it was for these reasons that we contemplated in paragraph 4 of my letter of 12th December that the prior approval of His Majesty’s Government would be sought for entering in.o negotiations with the Sheikh and King Abdul ^zis, if it should later become possible for your Company to seek a concession from those tw r o rulers jointly. It is difficult question whether the terms of an actual concession snould be embooied in the option agreement to be offered to the Sheikh of Koweit, since the concession itself i f granted, would have to be obtained and held from Ibn Saud also, and it migh t perhaps be a more convenient course to vait until it is possible to seek approval for negotiations with him a.o well as the Sheikh of Koweit before drawing up the terms of an actual concession. This would not prevent the/the Company seeking an option from the Sheikh of Xoweit in the meantime. I merely refer to this point, however, at this stage, as it is a difficult one on which we shall have wO let you have our considered views when we reply officially to your letter. 6. ; r e are glad to avail ourselves of your offer to let us have additional copies of the drafts. We shall have to consult the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and also the Poreign Office, Admiralty and Petroleum Department. Is it possible for you to let us have four additional copies of the drafts for this purpose ? I hesitate to ask you for so many, unless you happen to have them already available. But could you in any case let me have one additional copy of each to send immediately to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf by this week mail 9 Yours sincerely, (Sd.) J. C. WALTON-, 2 .

Arf J ^ Petroleum Conceceiona Limited City-Gate House, / / ‘ b ^ junsDury square, | r^' V T('P C Finsbury Square, London, E.C.S* 6th February, 1936, Dear Mr. Walton, t In reply to your letter of the 4th instant, I send herewith four more sets of the draft Concessions. 2. I have discussed with Mr. Lefroy the formal transfer of the Trucial Coast options, but although the two companies concerned are in entire agreement over P.C.L. negotiating and obtaining the Concessions in its own name, I gather that technically the options themselves f ~ ~ '' r ' n,rri ' ,L '' l '- ll - , ~ r- ‘ r “ M ’* v.w... , .^M««. are not transferable; Mr. Lefroy has offered ta clear up this matter v:ith you. %V 3. The operation of para.5(c) of your letter of the 12th December will not arise for some time; the D’Arcy will not be sending out anyone, and P.C.L. does not propose to launch an exploratory party of two or three geologists until October next. Mr. Holmes has already left, but he does not propose to wander along the Trucial Coast; his proposal was to take up residence in Bahrein, where the Company ■ willbe in funds at the Eastern Bank, and with the approval of the Political Resident to request the Rulers of the Trucial Coast to call one at a time, discuss terms, sign, and take away their bags of Rupees. 4. It will be necessary, of course, for the D'Arcy to notify each Ruler that Mr. Holmes is negotiating with its full approval on behalf of P.C.L., and I hope that you can instruct the Political Resident to confirm to each/— 1 2 . |l^' ' each Ruler that the candidature of P.G.L., vice the D 1 Aicyj ie acceptable to His Majesty’s Government* It would be most unfortunate if the Rulers, nuviny ^runo^d these options to tne ij’ivrcy, should maintain txiat Concessions can be granted only to the D’Arcy, and not to P.O.L.; as you are aware the D’Arcy is unable to hold these Concessions* C* I agree that tne Koweit Heutral Zone presents a distinct problem; recognising that it is impossible to negotiate simultaneously with the Shei 1 ch and ’with King Abdul Aziz, I endeavoured to lay down in the draft the terms which would oe binding on the Sheihh; similar terms would then be offered to King Abdul Aziz. If they do not reach his minimura, the terms must either be increased until he is satisfied - in which case the Sheikh would receive corresponding benefit - or the idea of obtaining a comprehensive Concession over the Neutral Zone would have to be -dropped. In the latter alternative P.C.L. must pay at -ft to the Sheikh the ’whole of the option money that it will have contracted to pay curing the five-year option period; it can then either retire from the scene, or it can elect “*“ m•• ,/ ’^‘~mrYnmiMrrrT~ .iiii nxn^&lt;'&gt;i X to pay the increased yearly payments that will become applicable after the initial five-year option iod, and persevere with King Abdul Aziz. I have accepted it as an essential preliminary to a successful negotiation cf this Concession, having regard to the oil rights being under co-interested ownership, to bind one of the parties to certain definite terms, otherwise a negotiator appealing in turn to the Sheikh and then, to King Abdul Aziz would be consigned from pillar to post. I am aware that King Abdul Aziz has bespoken his share of the oil rights in the Neutral Zone to the Standard Oil Company of California; he is reported to have hedged3. [O to the extent that he may he unable to ensure that the Standard ox California shall have a 50^ interest in any Company that obtains that Concession^ Mr. Holmes is my authority for saying that King Abdul Aziz and the Sheikh have exchanged views, and that a merger of Standard of California and Ira&lt;p Petroleum Co. (or P*C.L.) in the proportions of 40/60 shareholding, would be acceptable to the King, and to the Sheikh. Such a proposition P.C.L. will not entertain, and it prefers to make an entirely unencumbered bid; seeing that the Sheikh is as yet unattached over the Neutral Zone, it seems to me that, in the first instance, the obvious thing for P.O.L* is to enter into some arrangement with him. This, of course, may result in a stale mate, whereby P.C.L. acquires the Sheikh’s rights, the while Standard of California holds the / King’s That, I think, is the most likely situation to arise; it would not be entirely unacceptable to P.C.L., as although involving gratuitous payments to the Sheikh it would at least give us time to persuade King Abdul Aziz. But if such a situation is entirely unacceptable to His Majesty’s Government, I am open to discuss, at any time convenient to you some other line of approach to the Neutral Zone problem. I should explain that the seeming anxiety of P.C.L. to get quickly on the scene is prompted by rumours of Standard ox California activities in that direction, and although that may not result in the grant of concessions to them, any delay in direct approach by P.C.L. can only make the path of P.C.L. more difficult.

LOKpOI-T, s.W.l 7th February, 1936 c-p-^ With reference to my letter of 31st January, P.z.677/36, and previous correspondence regarding the proposals of Petroleum Concessions Limited, I enclose copy, Wich Slx encl °sures, of the Company's reply to our official letter of 12th December. Copy is also enclosed of a demi-official letter which 1 sent to Skliros on 4th February, and his repxy^ted 6th February. 2. We shall of course be consulting you further, after obtaining the preliminary views of the other Departments oi nis Majesty's Government, regarding the various draft concessions enclosed with the letter of 30th January from Petroleum Concessions Limited. M X *7 3. The point on which 1 want to consult you at the moment is the procedure in re 0 ard to the approval of the options already obtained by the Anglo Iranian Oil Company j-rom the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast. The original proposal/of ^Ath October was that they should take transfer of these options from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and we have signified that we would approve the grant of the options and their transier on the conditions set out in paragraph 5 oi our letter to Petroleum Concessions Limited of 12th December. The two Companies now propose a U 2 . proposal of Petroleum Concessions Limited in their letter V somewhat different procedure - viz., that the options should not be transferred, because for technical reasons (presumably the wording of the option agreements) they are not transferable, and suggest that the approval of the opening of negotiations for actual concessions might be given at the same time as approval of the options. Skliros and Lefroy called here on 6th February, and I explained to them that it may be some little time before approval can be given to the opening of negotiations for actual I concessions on the lines of the draft concessions which have sent us. In accordance with paragraph 5(d) of I our letter of 12th December approval has yet to be given to the commencement of negotiations for actual concessions, and though it is probable that we shall be able to give it, the question has yet to be decided in consultation with/with the other Departments and yourself, and might take a little time to consider from the point of view of the possible commitments which would be involved in the eventual grant of concessions (Two points which might have to be considered are, for example, the southern boundary of the Abu Dhabi concession, and the general principles which we might have to get clear in our own minus in advance in regard to the sort of provisions that should be made for the protection of the concessionaire. I dare say there will be no great difficulty on either point. Skliros suggested at our talk on 6th February that the southern boundary of the concessions might be Ise^t indeterminate and said that he saw no reason why the Company should not agree that any operations to work a concession would be confined within whatever distance of the coast we pleased. But these points have to be considered.) I informed Skliros and Lefroy that we would let them have an official reply oo che Company's letter as soon as possible, but that chere must be some little delay on account of the necessity 01 consulting the other authorities concerned. is probable that Holmes may be able to fill Meanwhile itin time by scanting work in regard to the Bahrein concession and perhaps visiting Muscat, though he will not make any start at all until we inform Petroleum Concessions Limited that he may do so, 4. Now with reierence to the procedure in regard to the existing options; there seem to be two alternatives - (1) to approve the grant of the options to the Anglo-iranian Oil Company at once, on that Company agreeing t0 condi tions (a), (b) and (d) and the Sheikhs concerned agreeing to condition (c); (2) co postpone approval of the options (a course to which the Anglo-iranian Oil Company have no objection) until we are in a position to approve the opening of negotiacions lor actual cone.scions; then to approach the Sheikhs in regard to condition (c), to explain to them the proposal that negotiations should be opened by Petroleum Concessions Limited, and then approve at the same time both the options and the opening of these further negotiations. The second alternative seems to have the merit of making one bite at the cherry with regard to the Sheikhs. It will in any case presumably be necessary for someoneI (*V (@ 5. to explain to the Sheikhs how it comes about that, though it was the Anglo-lranian Oil Company which obtained the options, it is Petroleum Concessions Limited which is negotiating for concessions* It will, of course, primarily be for the Anglo-lranian Oil Company representatives in the Gulf to do this, and we understand that they will be instructed to introduce Holmes and give the necessary (explanation, but it will perhaps also be desirable that you, when the time comes, should inform the Sheikhs that His Majesty's Government approve the opening of negotiations under the options by Petroleum Concessions Limited through Holmes, and that it will be understood that any concession concluded can only be granted subject to the approval of His Majesty's Government. As, therefore, it will probably be desirable to approach the Sheikhs at the time when Holmes opens his negotiations, you may think it the simplest and least troublesome course to postpone till then the approach to them in regard to the approval of the options and condition (c). Could you kindly let us know by telegraph which course you think preferable from your point of view?&gt; i Wo are assuLiing^ in view of your telegram of 4th December, No,996, that you have no objection to tho employment of Holmes as the individual to be entrusted by the Company with the negotiations, ^ Since this was written Lefroy telephones that his Company are advised by Elkington that they should explain to the Sheikhs forthwith the present position in regard to the options and the proposal which is being made to His Majesty’s Government that their affiliated company, Petroleum Concessions Ltd., should negotiate concessions. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company are instructing i^lkington to act accordingly, subject to your prior approval of the messages to be sent to the Sheikhs. I do not think that this development greatly affects the choice between the two alternatives suggested above in regard to our own procedure, since when the proposal that P.C.L. should open negotiations for concessions has been approved by H.M.G., it will still no doubt be necessary or desirable that you should inform the Sheikhs that this is the case.K * 1 r7o Telegram jYom To G.

But as P.C.L. are working the options order if your Company signified their acceptance. 4.
