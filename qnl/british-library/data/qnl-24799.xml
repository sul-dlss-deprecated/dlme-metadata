I have enquired into the position in-t&amp;iP Qftoe, and find that the Act to which your brother-in-law refers ( the Bijni Succession Act, 1931) not only received the assent of the Viceroy, but was duly submitted to the Secretary of State in 1931# who considered it in Council^ and decided to leave it to its operation. The result is that the Act is wholly valid, and the Secretary of State cannot interfere with its enforcement. /m26, Fern Hoad, (jj) Ballygunge, Calcutta. INDIA. 22. 9. 44. r&gt; ^ dear brother-in-law, Please accept my compliments for the Puja. Perhaps you know my father had instituted a suit in favour of my elder brother contesting the succession to the Bijni naj Kstate. My brother and father died when I was a minor and my uncle was appointed my guardian who had deliberately deprived me of the bijni Kaj Bstate in collusion with my rival claimant one 5.IT.Dev with whom he arranged the marriage of my sister as a condition of the compromise which he had effected with the said mr B.N.Dev. I am at present trying to put forward my claims to the said estate by preferring a suit in the High Court. I believe you would not mind to spare your valuable time for me in helping this cause of mine in which your sister is also equally concerned. I think a person of your status knows it full well how to make the representation on my behalf through the proper channel to the secretary of states for India. Let me also tell you that the said mr B.N.Dev is now trying his best to get hold of the possession of the estate from the Court of wards. kr B.N.Dev also got an Act passed when I was a minor by in fluencing the Government officials, which is known as the Bijni Raj Act of 1931. By this Act it has been arranged that the succession tothe said estate should pass to mr B.!.i)ev alone or his eldest son to the exclusion of all other claimants. The most remarkable, arbitrary and astounding nature of this Act is that it had been passed exparte on the face of several other claimants whose claims were probably equally good as his and were still pending in the Court of Justice. Though this Act had received the assent of the Viceroy yet it has not been sanctioned by the Secretary of States for India or the British Sovereignty. So my humble request to you is that a person of your status could exercise enough influence in my favour so that no stone remains unturned to move the present authorities there to get this Act null and void and see that the great injustice done towards me by every body concerned might be permanently removed. I am soon going to file a suit to support my succession to the estate. I hope that you would kindly manipulate matters in such a way that my suit might progress towards a successful conclusion of the whole issue. 7/e are doing well, hope that you and your family are well. 7ith best of our wishes from both of us, Yours affectionately, 3.
