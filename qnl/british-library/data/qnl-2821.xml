Lord Grey observes that the Secretary of State for India would propose that the opening of this road should now he placed in the forefront of the negotiations with the Tangistani Khans for the release of the British prisoners now detained at Ahr am. It must he remembered, however, that so far the Tangistani Khans have ignored all the overtures which have been made to them, and that there is little prospect that they would accept this condition except after protracted negotiations. i In view, therefore, of the political and to 1^1 \ : financial urgency of the opening of this trade route, 17 AUG la'.o - A Lord Grey would suggest that in the telegram which it is proposed to send to the Government of India the word ‘'opened” should be substituted for the words 'put in the forefront of the negotiations'.

The Imperial Bank of Persia observe that as far as 'their information goes these restrictions have been imposed by the Government of India apparently with the object of punishing the Tangedstani Khans for their detention of the British subjects captured at Shiraz, and now detained at Ahram, and they call attention to the fact that the measures now in force have caused considerable public indignation in South-Western Persia, while it is open to question whether, in effect, the action taken has in any way secured the object in view. Moreover, the present position of financial exchange in Persia, which is a cause of considerable anxiety both to His Majesty’s Government and the Russian The Under Secretary of State, India Office.Russian Government, is in very great measure due to the complete stagnation of foreign trade while it cannot he denied that an unique opportunity for the extension of British trade in Persia generally is being allowed to pass without any advantage being secured. In these circumstances Lord Grey earnestly hopes that, if Mr. Chamberlain sees no objection, the Government of India may be requested to reconsider their attitude in the matter and to furnish their observations as to whether the time has not now arrived to raise the embargo at Bushire and permit unrestricted trade with the interior of Persia. I am to ado that the question of the prohibition of trade from Russia to Persia is bound up with the general restrictions imposed on exports from the commodities is apprehended. In spite of this, how ever, Lord Grey has under consideration the aesiracility o~ approaching the Russian Government with a request that in order to improve the exchange position they will carefully consider whether a limited trade between Persia and Russia could not now be opened.

I send you an extract on the subject from Wood’s last letter to us, da ted 8th June. I may add that a recent telegram from Teheran also asserts that the low rates of exchange are due mainly . to the lack of imports, both from North and South, and the consequent paralysis of trade arising from the restrictions imposed by Russia and ourselves, It is eivdently the opinion of our Managers, both in Teheran and Bushire that the Financial situation would be greatTy relieved, ifthe Government of India would relax their embargo. If the restriction is imposed in the hope of putting pressure on the Tangistanis to release the pri soners, it is likely, I think, to fail in its object. The Tangistanis have little to do with trade, and the chief effect of the restriction is to embarrass the Persian Government and to set the mercantile classes against celot Oliphant Esq., Foreign Office, S.W.against us. Ycu will remember that cur Bushire M ar J ger laid especial stress cn the latter point Ycurs sincerely, (Signed) H.E.Barnes. P.S.

In view of Russian advance on Ispahan possibly continuance of traffic by Bakhtiari road may be considered advisable, but reasons governing imports to Bushire, v Bunder Abbas and intervening coast also Bahrein and Dubai are on quite different footing. Both Kerman and Shiraz are in hands of revolutionaries, Germans and democrats. In latter place certain of the merchants are known to have identified themselves with democrats. At neither place is Imperial Bank of Persia working. All traffic up country from Bushire has practically ceased for monons. Deputy Governor of Bunder Abbas has sponuaneousxy offered to check transport to Kerman similarly. It will be remembered that there are at present number of items on Indian restriction list which can only be imported to Gulf ports by special permits issueu by ResidentResident. Experiment here has shown that effect of such imports being only possible by passes is useful as it enables local merchants to appreciate value of friendly attitude. Would not control of trade inland .and imports of principal commodities to Bunder Abbas also be a power ful weapon in hands of Sir P. Sykes. Our principal trouble here is smuggling of tea and other goods from Bahrein into Tangistan which does no good to Bank in any case and is contrary to Persian Customs interests and injurious to business legitimate traders. Political Agent, Bahrein, has during past month severely shaken up Persian smugglers established there and boats calling and now reports 'Persian and Indian merchants in Bahrein are now having their tea and sugar consigned to Dubai in order to evade restrictions on exporting these commodities'. He suggests total prohibition by Government of India of export of tea to Dubai ana restriction of export of sugar there, to prevent place becoming smuggling .&gt;as6 for Persian coast. I endorse this suggestion, inflicts no hardship on Arab ports as tea is li^le i \ drunk there. IfIf total embargo or blockade with all difficulties involved is impracticable or inexpedient I ,/ould suggest simple measure by which Government of India included Bushire ; Bunder Abbas, Bahrein, and Lingah as ports to which tea, sugar, and piece goods could only be exported under license b^ Customs on certificates from Political officers in ports concerned.

It is enemy territory practically for both the Governments and the results ot discordance and cost and trouble of coping therewith falls on us mainly. In order to bring southern population to their senses every measure which we are in a position to take seems to be justified and necessary and I submit that we may reasonably expect i: ersi^n Government to view matter in the same light as le TheThe Supply of legitimate demands for luxuries through Consuls on lines suggested would seem to he a matter presenting no serious difficulties as regards Tehran and northern towns of Persia. Independently of one another O'Connor at Shiraz Trevor at Eushire and lloel and Kennion in Arahistan have at different times emphasised potency of this power to control luxuries and their desire in their particular snhere to have it in their own hands and in the case of Pusti-Kuh it has recently been prominently brought to my notice. The discretion to issue permit for such imports to any particular merchant, for any particular town, tribe, or «hief at present moment would in the hand of Sir ?.

(Through the Bengal Government). Gentlemen. sir. I am directed to draw^ e attention of your Association to the fact that the exports of tea from India to Persia via the Persian Gulf which rose from £75,131 in 1911-12 to £99,816 in 1912-13, fell during 1913-14 to £73,222. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is of opinion that the decrease is chiefly due to the diversion of Indian, Batavian and Chinese teas to Persia yia the Batoum route; that this diversion, which has recently been encouraged by the openingjLf the Batoum-Baku, Batoum-Tabriz and Batoum Mashad routes to this trade, is principally due to high shipping freights from India to the Persian Gulf as compared with those from India to Batoum; that teas exported to Persia yla Batoum enter as 'Russian teas'; and that it is most undesirable Both from the point of view of the India tea trade and from that of India.shipping interests that this diversion should be allowed to continue. 2. In support of his arguments the Resident ouotes the following figures indicating the comparative cheapness of the Batoum route - ; Calcuttailcutta to Baghdad (for Kerraanshah, Hemadam, Ispahan etc.) Rs.50 per ton of 50 cubic feet. ilcutta to Bushire Rs.30 ' ' ' ' * ilcutta to Bushire via Bombay Hs,26-14-0 per ton.

In connection with the pressure of Russian Com mercial influence from the North into Central Persian markets, particularly the province of Isfahan, the following facts are noteworthy:- (Customs Administration Figures for all Persia) Total Import Import styled of Import styled of of Tea. Russian origin. British origin. 1,150 2,300 2,877 2,308 1,686 1,906 While imports in 1912-13 of teas under the heading 'from Russia' had thus nearly trebled in the space of four years, it may be remarked tnat those under the heading 'from British Empire or India' had diminished by one fifth, while the customs figures of actual imports into the Persian provinces via the Persian Gulf were only:- Bandar Abbas Lingeh Bushire Muhammarah and Ahwaz Kirmanshah 1911-12 Tons. 1912-13 Tons 39 62 i 2 278 220 105 99 404 526 826i 909 IsfahanCtM* i Isfahan. The Trade Report for the year March 1912-13 contains the following remarks regarding the supplies of Indian tea reaching that centre:- 'A rapidly increasing and now no longer insignificant quantity of Indian and China teas is imported from the North, teas thus imported toeing known and sold in Isfahan as gussjan tea. XXXXXXXXXX There was a further marked increase in the import of teas in the North, which is stated by native traders to have been over TOO cases (as against an estimated import of aO in ItlO-ll cmd 535 in 1911-12)* (Note. Total arrivals at Isfahan for 191^-13 were calculated by a British firm us lew as 2,000 cases) Everything points to further accessions of the Tea Trade via Bussia and spread of the import via Russia southwards, with a corresponding decrease of import at the Crulf ports. nv PRKTfThTS AUr, POSSIBLE CHECK ON TEA^ I?i RUSSIA . The diversion of Indian and Batavian and China teas from the Persian Gulf to the Black and Caspian seas has undoubtedly been fostered by the opening of the Batoum-Baku, Batoum-Tabris and Batoum-Mashhud , + v,io tTwie But the reason for the routes to this trade. rapidrapid encroachment of the import via 'Russia into the commercial sphere in Persia up till lately supplied almost entirely via the Persian Gulf, notwithstanding the far greater distance to he travelled, is probably to be found in:- A e High shipping freights from India to the Persian Gulf, as compared with freights from India to Batoum. B. High rates of transport hire from the Gulf and Kirmanshah to Isfahan, which have been exorbitant and still are far too high* As regards (A) a considerable check on imports to Persia via Pussia might possibly be effected if the principal British shipping line to the Gulf (the British India Steam Navigation Company) would make rates of freight considerably lower, at any rate us a temporary experiment, in order to see if cargoes of tea from Calcutta and Bombay to the Gulf showed signs of increasing, and competing better with consignments to Batoum* It will be seen from the letter from the Director General of Commercial Intelligence in India, attached herewith, that freights on tea by British India Steam Navigation Company Limited are.- CalcuttaCalcutta, to Baghdad (for Kirmanshah Hamadan, Isfahan etc) Pa 50 per ton of 50 c.f * Calcutta to Bushire 30 ^ w ” Calcutta to Bushire via Bombay 2o/l4/- per ton (Probably ever Ps.30 with Bombay charges, or by rail) On the other hand it costs by:- Messageries Maritimes from Caic^itua ail blic uo BaGOum only £5/^14/ - per bO c^vt Austrian Lloyd do. do« !

Shiraz to Isfahan do ill do (camel he) Total i*26i Baghdad to Kirmanshah £6-£10 Kirmanshah to Isfahan £15t Total £2U -25 in comparison with Pesht-Isfahan £14. The charges per ton ironi Batoum to Baku by laii, from Baku to Enzeli by steamer and over uhe short dis tance between Enzeli and Pesht are not known here, but it is clear that the total cost per ton from Batoum to Isfahan must be considerably cheaper tha.n fiom Bushire or Baghdad to Isfahan. AsAs regards (B), high rates or transport hire from Bushire to Isfahan and Kirnanshah to Isfahan, comtination among forwarding merchants in Bushire has made it possible to bring rates down and keep them steady dur ing the difficult period of scarcity experienced in Persia in 1913-14, and it is hoped that a good harvest i in 1914 will permit of a return to still more moderate and normal rates between Bushire and Shiraz. Cost of /■ transport and the capacity for forwarding large quanti ties of tea and other goods from Bushire to Isfahan are I however seriously hampered and affected by the diaper- ^ sion and dearth of transport animals on the road and the growing seriousness of this problem, -much is pait- ly the cause of so little tea and other goods reaching Central Persian maricets from the Persian Gulf, makes it urgent that His Majesty's Government should direct His Majesty's Consular Officers at the towns en route to secure the co-operation of the local authorities in bringing more owners of animal transport to work on this route. % Meanwhile rates of steamer freight from India to the Gulf might be better adjusted to compete with rates to Batoum - a prominent Indian merchant of Persian , originorigin in Calcutta has stated that the cheapness of freight to Batoum and dearness of freight to Bushire and Bagndad has much to dc with the tea trade being diverted to ^ssia and the north of Persia. • 5, ihh the great interest which Lora Inch cape now has in the trade of the Gulf ports and Baghdad, he might possibly be willing to make experimental reduc tions of freights on tea, if placed in possession of the above facts ana figures. 2 o REDUCTION OF DUTY OV D/T QPT (F T EA II^JPEPBIA (Previous references Foreign Office to His Majesty's Legation, Tehran No. 8 (9600/10) of 29ih April 1910. Bushire despatches to Legation Nos. 64 and 89 of 15th September and 30th November 1912; to Govern ment of India Nos. 2216 and 3190 of same daoes) The reduction of duty (from the present 60 ad valorem) would much Improve the import of tea via the Gulf to Central Persia, and though of equal incidence in Northern and Southern Persia its effect would certainly be much greater in Southern Persia, for not only would it stimulate merchants in the Gulf region to larger imports, but by putting an and to tne xaige smuggling which now militates against bona fide trade inin in tea via Persian ports, it v/ould send the traffic back to its proper channels and give merchants confidence. Enclosures in this memorandum will show corres pondence since the despatches cited above and the present stage of the proposal that the Administrator telegram from Minister to Pesident No. 63 of 11th Feb. 1913 Telegram from Pesident to Minister No. 174 of 30th March *13. Telegram from Minister to Pesident No. 141 of 2nd April *13 General of Customs at Tehran should be asked to agree to a material reduc tion of the rate of duty - 10-159? has been suggested. Subsequently to telegram No. 141 of 21st April 1913 from His Majesty’s Minister, it was suggested from Bushire that a reduction of the duty on tea should be made a condition of agreement to Monsieur Mornard's proposed increase of the Customs tariff on many articles. Now that it would appear that His Majesty's Government have decided definitely against onsieur Bernard’s proposal, it would perhaps be possible foe His Majesty’s Government to take up the question of tea with the Customs Department at Tehran again, and press for a reduction of the existing rate sc damaging toto legitimate trade» It in difficult to think: of any article of trade, a reduction of duty on which at ^usbiudb request would harm British commerce or commerce via the Persian Gulf, and seeing the already large import of tea via Pussia, might it not be possible that the Russian Government would not be altogether averse to a reduction?

I hardly think that this matter can be pressed without a reference home as a modification of the Commercial Treaty of 1903 would be involved and we might lay ourselves open to a demand from Fussia. or some other country for a reduction of some import duty which might harm our trade to a greater extent than good would be done by a reduction in the duty on tea, Townley.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100034963854.0x000002_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/448/1</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100034963854.0x000002</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/448/1</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 1032/1914 Pt 1 'Persia.
