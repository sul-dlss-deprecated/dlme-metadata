Bated, 10th Ramdhan 1347 • ‘ r- J\ r y To H. B. M’s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that H. E. Shaikh Hamad wishes to construct a Sea-road between the islands of Manama and Muharrak. The undertaking is a very large one and in my opinion presents great difficulties as except at low tide the whole distance, over a mile, is covered by the sea. At one place there is a channel of unknov/n depth about 800 feet wide which would have either to be bridged or crossed by a ferry. This road would need to &lt;s«rsist the whole force of the sea, on both sides. H. E. Shaikh Hamad and the people of Bahrain do not realise the difficulties of such a work or the amount of expense that it would incur. A survey of the route has been carried out by the Bahrain Land Department, but it is impossible to judge the strength of the tide- 2 - II. E. Shaikh Hamad now agrees that it would be useless to commence this work without the expert opinion of a qualified Engineer and he has instructed me to request your assistance in obtaining the services of a consulting Engineer from the Government of India or per haps from Irak. If such an individual could be obtained from Irak his expenses would doubtless be less. H. E. Shaikh Hamad would be.greatly obliged if you could assist him in the matter and inform him what fees would be demanded for the services of a consulting Engineer. If necessary I will forward to you a report giving particulars of the suggested road together with a plan, but I do not think that any opinion could be given without seeing the place itself. H. E. Shaikh Hamad does not wish to employ a private individual but w ! ould prefer a Government Engineer either from India, or preferably, if a competent person is available, from the Government of Irak. H* E. Shaikh Hamad is anxious for an opinion as soon as possible. I have the honour to be, Sir , Your Obedient Serfant, financial Adviser, Bahrain State.No. / O dO/' of 1347 Office of/the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Dated, 18th Ramdhan 1347 Memorandum With reference to my letter No. 1050 of 10th Ramdhan 1347. I am sending a plan of the proposed road. I have also a plan of the actual course showing different depths hut this is at present in the possession of Major Holmes who assisted us hy preparing the plan which I forward to you now. I hope to have the second plan hack within 10 days, when I will send it to you. It is proposed to construct the road with a centre of loose coral stones and side rVls of evi stone similar to bhe Manama sea-road. The v/hole work is difficult hut the greatest problem is the deep channel near Muharrak whose depth has not heen measured. Last year divers were sent down hut they reached a layer of deep mud and were unable to discover how far the mud extended. would A steel bridge iridti/cost an enormous amount and any sort of ferry, in my opinion, would he difficult to manage owing to the power of the sea and the current. I think this plan explains itself. Adviser to the Government, Bahrain.of 1929 . NO. The political Agency, Bahrein Dated theJ^^T/arch 1929 .

Sir, With reference to your letter No.P.34(15)-A/29, dated the 5th April 1929, on the subject noted above I am directed by the G vernment of Bomba,, to inform you that it is regretted that x owing to the present shortage of officers, chiefly on account of the work of construction of the Lloyd Barrage Scheme, no engineer can be spared for the purpose. This Government is, however, prepared to assist the Bahrain Government in the way indicated in the following paragraph. 2. If the section of the rock bed shown on the draw ngs of the tentative design, prepared by the Bahrain Government and returned herewith, is reliable, the tentative design seems to be generally suitable , and the carrying out of the work should not, it Q ppears involve any serious practical difficulty. There appears no reason why the section should not be reliable, since it seems from the drawing that, excepting in the deep portion, for which a ferry is proposed, the rock bed is exposed, or practically ao f at low tide, and thus there could have been no difficulty in examining it and taking accurate levels. I am, however, to suggest that you should consult the lion’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf as to the reliability of the section. If he considers that it may be taken as approximately correct, this Government would arrange (if that officer then remains under the control of this Government) for the Executive Engineer, Persian Gulf Division, who will have or can obtain information regarding local materials and rates, etc., to prepareprepare detailed plans, estimate and specifications for the work, charging the Bahrain Government at 2% per cent of the amount of the estimate, as is done by this Government in the case of private bodies or Municipalities, etc. It should not then be difficult for the Bahrain Government to arrange for the wcrk to be done by local agency and for the ferry, with the necessary winding apparatus, to be supplied by one of the fir s in Karachi or Bombay and sent up in the fair season. x X X X I have etc . 9 Sd, D.R.H.Browne, i Secretary to the Government of Bombay Public Works Department.of 1929.

I X X 2. The second suggestion is that the Government of Bahrein should cut a channel from the outer to the inner anchorage which would make it possible for the mail boats to come near in. This suggestion can hardly be considered until the Bahrein Govt; is informed whether the Government of India intends making any proposals to*the Shaikh in connection with the proposed harbour at Khor Khaliah which was recently sur veyed. The local merchants state that they would willingly pay a temporary increase in customs dues to achieve this improvement to the port if it resulted in mail boats coming in near. On the other hand I am sure that there would be strong opposition to the making of a harbour at Khor Khaliah as it is thought that this would cause a depreciation in value of property in Manama, but if it were found that the above pro posal was impossible and the Khor Khaliah harbour could be made, some of this opposition would subside. *.jent, -js! rain. m ft /S ^'lease obtain from ^alirain the fo^Llovdir; information in connection with the proposed ferry.

To His Britannic Majesty f s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that His Excellency Shaikh Hamad has directed me to write to you immediately on the subject of the Manamah - Maharaq sea road. For various reasons His Excellency wishes to proceed with this work at once. 2. The price of labour is now very low and the cost of stones is less than it has ever been before. 3. There is a great deal of unemploy ment in Bahrain and the work would provide means of earning a livelihood for many people who are now indigent, especially during these nextnext two months before the diving season begins. 4. The necessity of easier communi cation with Muharraq^ has become more essential than before owing to the aerodrome being estab lished at Muharraq.. Trade in Muharraq would benefit very considerably if the two towns were more closely connected. 5* His Excellency wishes the work to be begun while I am here before I proceed on leqve. 6. His Excellency would like to allo cate a sum of about Rs 40,000/- for the pur pose of continuing this work. He realises that as the revenue at present is considerably less than the expenditure it is impossible to do this work from revenue* He suggests that the necessary sum might be borrowed from the Deposit account, which consists of money belonging to the public deposited with the government, or from the Reserve, and repaid from the revenue which is expected from the Royalties on oil. 7* His Excellency has instructed me to write this letter to you now in order that it might be possible to ascertain the views of the Hon f ble the Political Resident on the subject while he is here.

S.F. of 1352 From The Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, To His Britannic Majesty f s Political Agent, I have the honour to refer to my letter No. IIBS/SF dated March 10, 1934, regarding the construction of the Manamah Muharraq road and to acquaint you with the proposal of the Bahrain government to complete this work. The reasons for continuing the work are as follows:- a. To reduce the inaccessibility of Muharraq town and island which contain a popu lation equal to or more than that of Manamah, the Capital. Owing to the shallowness of the sea at times during the day Muharraq and Manamah are almost entirely cut off from each other. It is true that this condition has existed for Bahrain. Bahrain manymany centuries but it is a reflection on the progress of Bahrain that if such an improve ment as connecting the two islands is possible no attempt should be made to achieve this object. Since the building of the sea roads in Manamah and Muharraq the construction of a causeway across the sea between the two islands has been considered not only feasible but a comparatively simple undertaking. b. The existence of the aerodrome in Muhar raq has rendered the need for speedy communi cation between the two islands even more impera tive. The necessity of this is evident as discussions have taken place regarding financial assistance from the Air Ministry to assist this government to carry out the work. c. The work will provide labour for many hun dreds of unemployed whose condition owing to three years of unsuccessful pearling seasons is very serious. The work will be done entirely by local labour who spend their wages in the local bazaqr. Trade would be encouraged to the extent of the money spent upon the road with consequent benefit to the customs revenue. d. The price of labour and cost of stone has never been lower. e. The trade of Muharraq would improve and the value of house and shop property would rise. The state of trade in Muharraq is at present very bad and land values in the town have shrunk to half of what they were when Muharraq was a flourish ing town ten years ago.2. The project of a sea road to Muharraq was first discussed almost ten years ago and funds were set aside for this purpose, the money was afterwards allocated to the electric scheme* The actual work was started five years ago and it was then intended that the road should be 40 ft. wide, including the side walls. 3. The total distance from Manamah to Muharraq is 8,500 feet and the deep channel, which must be left open for boat traffic is 800 feet wide. Work was carried out on the road for some months during three years but for the last two years it has been discontinued for financial reasons. The work already done is in various stages of completion extending over a distance of 3000 feet from Manamah. During former years Rs 34,000/- was spent on the road. 4. A section of 300 feet long and 40 ft. wide has been completed. It consists of fishti filling enclosed in two murabba walls whose height averages 6-7 feet. A further 900 feet has both side walls complete and approximately 20 feet of this length has been filled with fishti on the North of the south wall. Another 1400 feet has the south wall complete with filling of about 5 feet wide. Beyond, at intervals of 200 feet, a series of islands have been built up to the deep water, each island being about 30 feet long and 10 feet wide. The electric light poles are built in on these islands. 5. It has been decided to continue the-4- the road to the end of the channel with a width of 20 feet. Taking into consideration the reduction in the width and the cost of the completed work about 16$ of the whole road has been completed* It is estimated that the balance of the work will cost approximately Rs 1,26,000/- to complete. The cost of stone shows a decrease of about 75$ when compared to the cost when the road was begun. The comp letion will require about 3,24,000 cubic feet of Murabba stone and 12,96,000 cubic feet of fishti. Including labour the cost of 100 c.ft. of Murabba is Rs 12/- and similar amount of fishti is Rs 5/-. The road from Muharraq to within about 100 feet of the channel has been built during this year and is now in use. 6. If the road was built from Manamah to the edge of the channel the 800 feet of water • could be crossed by launch in a few minutes at any state of the tide and Muharraq would become within ten minutes distance from Manamah. The object of the road would be almost achieved. An additional convenience would be a ferry across the channel. I have estimates from engineering firms in India and England, supplied some five years ago for such a ferry but they are too large and elaborate for the purpose required. If it was decided that a ferry should be installed I am of the opinion that a suitable ferry with an oil engine capable of carrying two cars and 30 passengers could be built locally at a cost of not more than Rs 25,000/-* It is intended to charge a toll on persons 7persons animals and vehicles using the ferry, but it is unlikely that the revenue from the toll would pay for more than the running expenses and upkeep of the ferry and the repairs to the road. There is however another possible source of revenue or certain return for expenditure incurred in making the road. The areas on each side of the road will become valuable property. Already one site has been let on a 99 years lease and many enquiries have been made about other sites. People will wish to purchase building sites along the road which they can reclaim and on which they can build houses and offices. These sites could be leased on long leases or sold outright and if sold outright a tax could be charged towards paying for the road. I am confident that there will be development in this direction. Muharraq is surrounded by sea on three sides and on the north the ground is unsuitable for building, the area for expansion in Manamah is also limited. 8 t The government at present has insuf ficient revenue to consider paying for the cons truction of the road from income. It would be possible to borrow Rs 30,000/- from certain money lodged in the government deposit account on behalf of 'Atlath'. The trustees of this money have approved of the suggestion on condition that within two or three years the government erects buildings on government ground costing Rs 30,000/- whose rents will form a permanent income for the purposes for which the 'Tilt” was- 6 - was dedicated. A further Rs 50,000/- would be withdrawn from the Reserve 2 , 00 , 000 /} and spent upon the cost of the road. This sum would be replaced from the additional revenue which is expected from oil royalties, or from another source. In the next year, provided that oil royalties amount to the sum which is now expected, it would be possible to set aside Rs 50,000/- to complete the road and the ferry. 9. The estimates which I have arrived at are only approximate and are formed from the information which I have at my disposal, which is limited. I have discussed the matter of the ferry with the State Engineer and his substitute who both have some knowledge of such matters. In every case I have estimated on the most broad lines allowing more than the amounts which result from my calculations. I would point out too that the Bahrain government has no public works department and that the estimate for this work has been made in a few days. I am confident however that the road could be built for the amount which I have quoted and that it could be built by local untrained labour though it would be necessary to obtain the advice of an engineer in respect of the ferry. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Adviser to the Governmentpearl trade. 4, Although trie project la not one trhieh c,%n he called of &lt; easentlal l^ortance, X atrorigl^ reeeemnd that we *h:»jld not oppose it being carried out* as you know, Hia jcccllency ^hairth Ummd has recently toen of greet aaalatance to us in a certain project smd the inhi^in Govemenit will receive froxr, tiiat project a windfall of money, A considerable part of this windfall la to he applied to repaying’ a sum which was taken frorc the reserve in order to balance the present year ‘8 badget, and it is proposed to devote ’ .w» 0 f 000 from tlie balance to the constmetion of the emassay* It wo.ild be ' t'iost inadvi 3 eV’;'lc fro?s tlie pollticfil ooint of view to stand in the way of this popular work Just at a moment wtjen the be ejected to fail die within the next (Arabic) financial year, it is difficult to oppose the proposal without — Incurring odium in the minds of all vrho wish to ses the woric oarricfM out# It is especially desirahle at the present time, that we should studvo-isly avoid any actlor* which m# ^ive toe iB^sression tv»t we are int«:Htering needlessly, and J.

Sir I have the honour to refer to your letter No.l264/S*F. dated the 5th April 1934 (20th Dil Haj 1352) and to the Honourable the Political Resident*s conversation with His Excellency Shaikh Honad bin *Isa A1 Khalifah regarding the causeway between Manamah and Muharraq. 2 * I confirm my telephone conversation with you on the 9 th April 1934 that there is no objection to the work on the causeway being re-started subject to certain considerations mentioned below* 3* It is suggested that a plan shoald be laid out on the plain near the Palace (or at any suitable place) showing the dimensions of the causeway and that it should then be ascertained by experiment, whether the proposed width (20 feet) is sufficient to allow traffic(which include motor cars, donkeys and foot passengers) to proceed with reasonable facility and safety# It is also thought that it would be well to consider whether a parapet should not be constructed to prevent falls from the edges of the causeway* 4* In view 01 certain revenue which the Bahrain Government hope to reserve, it seems unnecessary to have recourse to a loan from the Government deposit account on behalf of the 'Athlath*, but rather to utilize part of the balance of the above revenue which will remain after the sum borrowed from the reserve in order to meet the deficit in the present year's budget- 2 - Vf budget has be-en replaced* 5* It is presumed that adequate arrangements can be made for carrying out the work and for checking the expenditure, and it would be convenient if you would inform me what arrangements are made in case any question about them should arise during your absence on leave* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your .most obedient servant, /I Lieut-Colonel, Political ^gent, Bahrain* rv»0. 1° lL l Cf 1934. 19/196 xhe Pclitical Agent, Bahrain.

I enclose the report made by the Chief Engineer of the Port Directorate, Basrah, dealing with the method of bridging the channel between the two ends of the Manamah-Muharrak road. 2. The report was explained to His Excellency Shaikh Hamad and after discussion scheme Nb.l. (2) as shown on enclosed blue print was adopted as being the most satisfactory, most easily constructed and most economical in the long run. During the last two months Rs:14000/- has been spent on filling the channel according to the advice of the engineer. It is proposed to stop this work when the stone reaches one foot below low tide to allow several months in which the stone may settle. 3. The road itself has now been completed to a distance of 7000 feet from the Manamah end and for some time it has been used by motor and passenger traffic. People from Manamah can now reach Muharrak in about 10 minutes by driving along the road and crossing by boat to the Muharrak pier. The water crossing takes three minutes only. The Muharrak pier is now being extended. Previously the end of the pier was in such shallow water that only small boat could go' alongside at low tide. It is now being extended to the deep water. 4. The total expenditure on the road since the work was started 7 years ago is Rs:1,51,502/-. When the scheme was considered it was calculated that the cost of the road would be in the neighbourhood of 6 lacs. 5. We are in communication with the Port Directorate, Basrah, on the subject of the drawbridge but it will not be possible to start constructing the bridge until the filling in the channel has had time to settle which will take not less than 6 months. 6. Both His Excellency Shaikh Hamad and the public in general are extremely pleased that the causeway has been completed up to the channel and there would be very great-GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN.

I have written privately to Lov/don the Fort Trust Engineer asking his advice about obtaining further advice on the bridge.

I am inclined to think that you would find it more satisfactory (especially as ' ard does not let you pay) to ask the Government of India to obtain an expert adviser to examine the matter. If you will let me ‘ have © statement showing exactly what you require I will send it on to the Honourable t e Political Resident. ; 3. A point which has not as far as I know been touched (though you may have gone into it with the engineer who carae iiere) and seems to me to be important, is whether the final almost entire filling of the gap 3 * will so bank up the water on the south side as to flood the landing ground, especially if high tides and a ’kaus* coincide. I think that the expert should be asked to go into this aspect of the matter*D.O. N 0 . 1464. Dear Colonel loch, i ^ith reference to your letter D.O. 311-6/119 dated 8 th February 1937 regarding the bridge on the Manamah %harraq road. I have now had a letter from Dowdon, the Engineer who was sent down by Colonel toard last year, who says he could pre pare plans and specifications for the bridge, pro vided that Colonel ^ard approved, but that he could not come down here again. 2. Under the circumstances, d think perhaps it would be best to obtain the advice of an Engineer from the Government of India or elsewhere, if this could be arranged. I should therefore be obliged if you would approach the Hon’ble the Political Resident on the subject. In any case there is no hurry as I consider it essential that the cause way head should be given some months in which to settle before any further work is done on it. 3. I attach a note giving a rough descrip tion of the work mentioning what is required. 4. With regard to tide* some time ago I asked for reports from ^uharraq about any changes on the coast which might be due to the construc tion of the road. Nothing has been noticed at present. I have myself observed that on either side of the causeway the sand banks which used to be very small are gradually becoming more- 2 - more conspicuous. It appears that the road is acting as a sort of sieve which allows the water and pass through but holds up the sand. This condition exists only on the shallow part of the sea adjacent to the road. This sand is now being constantly used for building etc. as it is near at hand. Yours sincerely, Lieutenant-Colonel Cordon Loch, C.I.E H. B # M's Political -%ent, Bahrain.The Bahrain Government has constructed a causeway between the two islands of %namah and Maharaq on which the two biggest towns in Bahrain are situated. The distance from shore to shore is about li miles. The causeway is built of stone, the centre is filled with 'fishti” coral stone and on each side there is a dry wall of large slabs of coral stone. No cement is used except on the parapet. The causeway has taken several years to build, it has resisted all weather and no stones have been displaced since work was started about six years ago. The shore on which the causeway is built is dry, for most of the distance at low tide. The height of the causeway varies from 10 - 15 feet and its width is 30 feet. The causeway is now complete with the exception of the parapet and one section which is a deep channel. 'This channel is about 700 feet wide and starts at about 200 yards from the ^uharraq shore. Tts depth varies from 9 to 15 feet below low tide sea level. Part of this channel has been filled with stone. In 1936 a survey and report on the work was made by an Engineer belonging to the Tpaq Port Trust who recommended that the channel should be filled in up to a certain level and a gap left through which craft can pass at a certain time of day over which a bridge should be constructed. Be suggested that there should be a drawbridge. The Chief Hoyal Engineer, Iraq, with whom T have also discussed the question suggested a bridge built on piles with either a drawbridge in the centre or a continuous bridge on piles rising in the centre to a height above the water to give sufficient clearance for boats to pass underneath.- 2 - The width of the opening should be between 30 - 40 feet and the maximum height of the mast of any craft which use the bridge is \co feet. It is the construction of this bridge on which the Bahrain Government requires advice.Telegram G.T.C. From Political Agent, Bahrain.

Bear Colonel ^owle, ^ou asced ne yesterd-iy to ; dvice you on the most satisfactory method of obtaining quotations to bridge the gap between the two ends of the causeway joining the Miharrak Island with the Bahrain main Island. I think the most satisfactory method would be to obtain quotations through the Indian Stores Department. *°r purpose, it will be necessary for you to determine the waterway required find it struck me from a casual inspection at site that any contraction of the gap, from what it is at present, right in time prove embarrassing, because if the difference of rater levels between the two sides of the -ap becomes too ;;r-rt, there is bound to be consistency of the bed on v/hich foundations for piers would have to be built, as also to kno the levels of the bed in causeway. 4. the greatest flow throu the causeway, I should think, would be at tines of hi h tide, in which case it might be po icible to ravo the construction of a large bridge cm flow throu 'h there. 5.5. i have enquired from the Indian Stores uepart- raent and they say that, given sufficient infonaation, they will be able to call for tenders and they consider that there are suitable contractors in India to execute the work. fhey mention the firms of Messrs. BraitliTraite &lt;£ Co., Messrs, nennan 6c Mohatta and also Hichardson 6c Cruddas, but until one knov/s the depth of the bed of the gap and the difference of levels, it would be difficult to determine the most suitable spans for a bridge. if tne water is very deep, the construction of piers becomes difficult and, therefore, one would naturally choose a large span girder oridge so as to reduce the number of piers. if, on the other hand, water is not very deep, it might be advantageous to construct more piers and reduce the spans. You will realize that the cost of the girders increases as the square of the spans and, therefore it is advisable to increase the number of piers, if their cost is not prohibitive. Yours sincerely 3d. A. Croad 17/3 The Hon'ble Lt.-Col. T.

Dear Colonel Dated New 1937 In uy D#0. No« WIV/711 f dated the 17th March, 1937, I perhaps did not make myself sufficiently clear about the data, which would be required regarding the tide at Bahrain* I enclose herewith a plan of Muharrak and the main Islands and also the causeway and have marked thereon 4 points, namely: A, B» C &amp; D* 2* The data which I think should be collected is to find out the comparative water levels between these 4 points and in order to do this 4 water gauges should be put up at these points and they should be brought to a common datum by having levels taken between A§C &amp; D* The height of the water should be observed every hour through out the day simultaneously at all 4 points and the tide tables of the Persian Gulf indicate that the 14th and 15th of April are suitable dates* 3* I am asking ray Executive Engineer in Karachi to obtain 4 canal gauges to be sent to Loch* These gauges should be fixed to wooden posts driven into the ground. Actually, A &amp; B could be fixed to the walls of the cause way on either side. C &amp; D will have to be driven into the sand or coral* It is important to see that the zero of all 4 gauges is at the same level, because it is from these gauges that the direction of the flow of water at all states of the tide will be determined. If we find that the difference in water levels between A &amp; B is at no time appreciable, it may be possible to fill up the gap in the causeway by dumping rock. This naturally irill be the cheapest thing to do, especially if the difference in-2 &amp; in levels between A Sc B during low water is small, because then we could make the waterway through the cause way towards the shore, through which at present there are small gaps to dispose of water at high tides. 4. I should also like a longitudinal section of the bed of the channel from one end of the causeway to the other including the gap* This can easily be done by taking soundings every 200 ft* and observing the water level of the gauge at A* From this we can find out the depth of the bed at any point below the zero of the gauge. Probably the easiest way of finding out, what the b^d of the channel is, would be to get the Oil Company to make one or two borings at the present terminals of the cause* way at the gap end marked on the plan Eh? respectively. This data will give us a very good idea of how to tackle the problem. 5. As probably the , •Shamal ,, banks up the water in the inner anchorage, it is also necessary to have readings taken at A» B C &amp; D during a Shamal, so could this data also be obtained? 6* I send two copies of this letter so that you can send one copy on to whoever would be entrusted with collecting information* Enclosure : Plan No. A 7673* Yours sincerely, Sd.

It would certainly save a considereable amount of money if the causeway can be made solid and it all depends on how quickly the bay to the East can be replenished by the tide from the East without the aid of water through the Straits.

The gauges did not arrive here until a long' time after 15th vpril, 1937. I enclose a longitudinal section of the causeway showing the gap. ^he soundings were taken every 50 feet. Regarding the bed of the sea, I have not been able to obtain a drilling machine from the Bahrain Petroleum Com; any.

Position. - Bahrein consists of two main island, l&amp;tharr&amp;k the smaller, on which is situated a town of considered]e size and the landinj ground of Imperial Airw ys, and Mai-amah t ie 1 r or, also containing a considerable torn ^d in addition the oilfield in the centre of the island. The Customs Offices, administrative offices Naval 6 Flying Boat Station etc, are all on Manamah Island. The towns of Muharrak and Manama are separated by a strait some 8500 ft. wide of which all but a channel approximately 1000 ft. wide drys off at low water, this channel having a maximum depth of about 14 ft. below L.7.O.S.T. It is desired to provide means of transport between the two towns for foot passengers and cars. The former are now carried in small mahailas and launches, the latter not at all. Causeway alreaiy under construction, fith this end in view a causeway is being constructed from the Manama foreshore to the edge of the L..V. channel a distance of about 5.600 ft. and is nearing completion. The causeway is some 34 ft. wide the interior being composed of 'fishti' stone, a very light coral, and is faced with 'MarubDa' stone, a heavy stone found in layers of about a foot on the foreshore of the island, and is surfaced with sand. Drains are provided at intervals of' 3^: ft. through tie causeway to allow some passage for the tide and as t e stonework is all laid dry a considerable volume of water passes t rough the causewaycauseway itself. On the Iv'uharrak side of the channel there is already in existance a causeway of similar construction about 800 ft. Ion so tnat a jap approximately 1200 ft. wide remains to be dealt with. appe rs protected fror wave action from this direction craft anchor on the weather side during rough weather but are said seldom to lose their moorings. Tn the roughest weather the seas barely break on to the top of tie causeway which has suffered no damage whatever from wave action luring the six years since construction the north and is said locally to ,e very strong when making at spring tides with a northerly g le. On March 5th . at about a If tide, with tne tide rising northerly breeze tne speed was about 2 knots and it is thought prooable that the maximum would not exceed 5 knots. There is said to be a tidal range of about 5 ft. a ordinary spring tides. Bottom .- The bottom of the chmnel consists of a very shelly sand into which a rod could be thrust up to 3 ft. Beneath this is s j id to oe clay on': t ore is some suggestion that tre sand has been brought there recently owing to the narrowin ; of the wate nay conse quent on the building of the causeway.

These provisos debar any sug ;estion such as a piled viaduct or 1 .rye span brti e but such schen ss •would in any case be much more expensive than those suggested. A bridge of oats such as is suggested locally is considered undesirable as being very costly both initially and in upkeep. In t’ is scheme as shown on the attached print it is proposed that the causeway should be extended accross tue cr: nel. The causeway would consist of a lower bank entirely composed of marubba stone, 82 ft. wide at the widest part (i.e.,ir the deepest v/ater) brou :nt up to uniform level 1 ft. t. 1 . 'd0.3. m . on which would be built a causeway exactly as already constructed between 'ana.r.a an i t .2 channel, consisting of Ilarubbn walls filled in with fishti rubble. tion with the oilfield.

It is pointed out however t t in ill probability owir. , to the rusi of the tide sue an opening would be navigable only at the top of high water.

(a) ’Whether ti e lap e quantity of marubba stones involved (58,000 eft.) can be obtained sufficient ly quickly. « result in a silting up on the northern side of the causeway, ^s far as the causeway is concerned t. is will be of advantage as forming ; protection from v^ve action.

I'V (e) 7he joining of the towns by a continuous causeway may much affect their development, as the of continuous communication will make them virtually one town. The advantage of having the aerodro a in constant co.mrunication with fa a amah is also apparent. sen-, n 2 . * • In this scheme it is proposed th .t a ferry vessel similar to but more powerful than the Gurmat Ali ferry should be constructed operating between T heads built on each side of the channel as shown on the attached print. ^he ferry proposed would consist of the followin .1 ^wo locally built timber boats length overall ibout 49 ft. draunit not more than 3-^ ft. wit lat- form 19 ft. x 30 ft. consisting of teak decking on rolled steel Joists, and landing flaps 19 ft. x 6 ft. operated by handwinches. ^ach vessel to have one • . ^ screw controlled by a driver in each vessel and to be steered from one wheel mounted or a bridge spanning between the vessel on tne after side of the platform. The ferry would take 4 cars with ample room and foot passengers could be acco'modated forward of the platform ana would make the crossirg in about 5 minutes including the time taken to moor. In view of t : e conbidersble velocity of tide which it is anticipated will exist at tne end of the causeway it is considered that it would be unwise, to construct a landing in this position an: it is suggested that trio landings should bo on the southern side of the T ends of the causev/ays where comparative ly slack water will exist. InIn addition it is thought th.t difficulty will be experienced in building craft locally to draw less titan about S’-o' ins. tint s a result if the usual type of slipway were to be constructed the ,, e of excessive size which is undesireaole owir., to toe amount of wind the. /ould hold whe i lifted, -nd even with t.ne flaps of a maxiiiu'n size en the slipway at a maxinum slope, in the event of any swell accurin ; there would be danger of the ferry sitting on the slipway with resulting damage. It is accordingly suggested that the landing should consist of four level st es at intervals of 2 ft. in level so that the ferry can lie alongside the appropriate stage in safety at varying states of toe tide. By this method the size of t-e flaps is reduced to a minimum and risk of damage avoided. When not in use the ferry could lie alngside tee upper stage of toe Muharrak slipway. Cost . - It is estim tted that tne total cost of s '.es 35,000 of whicl 30.000 represents t le cost of the causeways and the pier heaes between 3&lt;300 ft. and 7 V3 ft. from ganarah. also estimates t *g ;;; .• tion including depreciation would be approximately 8.000 rupees per annum. rorcs.- In the case of scheme I imported material wou d proc . j not. nount to ore n 10% of m e tott cost, in scheme II the proportion would probably be about 35£.&amp; ^ 7. On the drawings attached the suggested bridge and ferry have been shown diagramatically only. A more detailed drawing ca' be sup ied in either c°se when t .3 main question is decided. The attached drawings are brded on the soundings taken accross the channel it is understood some years ago. The few rough soundings taken at Bahrein by the undersigned indicated that the position of the channel may be somewhat changed and it is imper tive ts t an accurate survey shouii be rr;vde at an early date between the two causeway ends as the position at w ica either tie bridge or slipways should be placed depends entirely on the cross section of the channel.r i cP GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN LAND DEPARTMENT.

It seems to me that there is very little difference between the water level to the forth of the proposed causeway and to the South, and if the differences are not more than this during the strong Shamal, T do not think thai t^at there would he any difficulty in completing the cause way and only leaving a bridged gap of 50 ft. for country boats to nass through. 3. Unless the position is unprotected, 5,200 ft. from the foharrak end seems to be the best position for the gap and it would be as well foY us to know the composition of the bed at this place. Could this be done please? 4. T entirely agree with the remarks of the Chief Bngin- eer, Basrah Port Trust, but as we have now found out that there is a good nuality of small stone, possibljr concrete blocks would be the solution to t he sea wall. 5. Dith this small difference of levels between the two sides or the causeway, the velocity of water can never bp much and in orden to protect the bed, if it is found to be clay, probably small stone blast would be better than large stones. 'Yuld the Bahrain Government like me to make enquiries regarding a draw bridge? There are two or three rirms in T pdia who could undertake the work.6.

Dated, Dil Oaad 6 , 1356 January 8 , 1938 G. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esquire, o.B.E., Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain. To His Britannic Majesty f s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, 'V^ I have the honour to refer to your printed letter No. 2332-6/19 dated 12th November 1937 enclosing copy of a letter from Mr. A. Croad, Central Public Works Department, New Delhi, on the subject of the Manamah - Muharraq causeway and the proposed bridge. 2. Since receiving the letter Mr. Reid, the Chief Engineer of Messrs. Holloway Brothers, who are building the two bridges at Baghdad, has visited Bahrain for the purpose of seeing the site of the proposed bridge. His visit was without prejudice and cost nothing to the State. 3. Mr. Reid expressed the opinion that bridging the existing gap would present very few constructional difficulties though it would cost a comparatively large amount. I pointed out- 2 - out to him that the Government would prefer, if possible, to extend the causeway leaving only a small gap spanned by a moveable bridge* The gap would be about 50 feet wide. This would reduce the cost of the bridge very greatly and would enable the government to make use of local labour and local material except in case of the actual bridge. Mr. Reid urged the necessity of obtain ing the advice of a reliable firm of Consulting Engineers before the Government decided to reduce the present width of the gap. He explained that though he could give an opinion on the construction of the actual bridge, he considered it essential before reducing the gap to make sure that the reduction of the gap would not cause danger to low lying islands or shipping anchorages now in use. 4. As far as his firm was concerned he informed me that it was not a work that they would be interested in at the moment. If however the Bahrain Government was prepared to wait until the completion of the Baghdad bridges contract, his firm could probably do the work then at a reduced rate because the men and materials would be available and would in any case be shipped down the Gulf past Bahrain en route to England. 5. Mr. Reid mentioned several established firms of Consulting Engineers whose advice might be sought: one firm, Messrs. Goode, Wilson, — 3 --3- Mitchel and Vaughan-Lee, 9, Victoria Street, London, are at present working both in Iraq and in Ceylon, and their engineers frequently pass up and down the Gulf by Air Mail. He thought it might be possible to arrange for some one belonging to this firm to call at Bahrain and to give a report on the question of reducing the gap. 6 . The difference in cost of bridging the existing gap and a gap of 50 feet is very great. The possible effects of reducing the gap to 50 feet might cause very serious damage to Bahrain. Although Mr. Croad, on the par ticulars supplied by us, is inclined to approve of the gap being reduced, I think it is most desirable to obtain yet another opinion on the proposal. 7 . I am writing to the firm suggested by Mr. Beid and enquiring whether their repre sentative will be in this neighbourhood in the near future. 8 . In the meantime I think it is advis able to defer making enquiries regarding a draw bridge from firms in India until a definite decision has been made regarding narrowing the gap. 9. I am much obliged to Mr. Croad for his help and advice but I feel that as there are now two different opinions on the closing of the gap it is desirable that we should consult — 4 .consult third party as suggested by Mr. Reid.

Oalrymple Bei^raye, ieqr*, ^dyiser to the Government of Sahrain, Bahrain, Persian Gulf. Sir, Bahrain. Menaaah • Muharraq Causeway. In accordance with your letter No. 1929/SF dated the 17th February, 1938, in which you asked us for our advice in regard to the reducing of the gap formed by the construction of a causeway by the Government to connect ^uharraq Island with M&amp;nan&amp;h, our partner Mr. Qwyther visited Bahrain on the 24th October and spent six days on the Islands making an examination of local conditions. £ # The Island of Muh&amp;rraq and the North East coastal parts of the island of Bahrain are low lying and at the narrowest point are separated by a strip of water about It miles wide, much of which is dry at low water, across which a stone causeway is in the course of construction. 3. At the present moment &amp; gap of about 900 feet exists between the two ends of the causeway and observations hove been taken in eonneotion with the rise of tide and the direction and flow of water in the channel through this gap.During the reoent spring tides it «as observed that though the flood streams generally makes from the north there are occasions when the flow through the gap over the period of high water is from south to north. In this connection it is known that surface currents caused by wind may give rise to considerable variation in the nature of the tidal flow. 4. from the foregoing we are of the opinion that if the gap were to be completely closed the levels of high water on both sides of the causeway would be affected and that higher tide levels might be attained at certain times. The amount of increase is not susceptible of exact prediction but we do not think that it would amount to more than a few inches. 5. The highest surface velocity recorded in the gap was 3 knots and this occurred at three quarter flood when the flow was from north to south. .^ny considerable reduction of the gap between the two ends of the causeway would probably result in some increase in the speed of flow through the opening which would add to the difficulties of navigation through the restricted channel. In such a case the passage of craft sight be limited to periods of slack water. The advantages of through communication between the two islands would no doubt outweigh any inconve nience of this nature. 6. In our opinion the best arrangement would be to continue the existing causeway and leave a gap of about 300 feet to be bridged and provided with an opening span of 50 feet.-3- n for this purpose we propose a swing bridge which would provide two equal openings for the passage of craft in different directions. 7. $e suggest that the maxiaua load for the roadway and bridge should be liaited to 5 tons and on this basis estiaate that a wild steel awing bridge opening 50 feet with a 10 feet roadway and two 5 feet footings and two approach spans of about 30 feet each with piers constructed of aasonry or concrete would cost approximately £18,000. 6. Bo far as we can judge the reduction of the gap as reoooiuended above would have little effect on the speed end volume of water entering the Khor Kaliya from the south, nor do we consider, after inspecting the relevant &lt;uiniralty Chart that the reduction would have any serious effect on existing anchorages or give rise to serious flooding. 9. aith regard to the possibility of higher water levels in Muharr&amp;q Bay near the aerodrome, we consider that, if required, it would be cheaper to give protection to this area by extending the small sea wall than to increase the length of opening to be left in the causeway itself. 10. We wish to express our thanks for the ready assistance given by Mr. Bteele and Khan 3aheb Mohoaed Khalil and his staff to Mr. Gwyther during his investigation. 11. We trust that the foregoing will give you the information you desire. The report is eccompanied by one sketch indicating the width of gap and type of bridge recommended. ““Sir. lour obedient servants,i His Britannic Majesty^ Political Agent, Bahrain* Sir, I have the honour to state that I have been informed by Messrs. Holloway Brothers (London) Ltd., of Priory, Wimbledon Common, S.W. 19, who have con tracted for the construction of the Manamah - Muharraq bridge, that they are having difficulty in securing the necessary materials for the work. The sub contractors are demanding from the contracting firm certificates that the contract is a 'Priority Contract' to enable them to deliver the steel castings etc. 2. His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin Isa Alkhalifah regards the construction of the bridge as a matter of great importance to Bahrain and is most anxious that the work should not be delayed. The bridge will assist the development of the town of Muharraq and will be of the greatest benefit to both military and civil aviation by linking the aero drome with the main island and the town of Manamah, it will be, in fact, a necessity when the Royal nix Force base is built on Muharraq island.- 2 - 3. His Highness wishes me to request you to obtain the assistance of the British Government in taking any possible steps to secure priority for the bridge material* I am informed by Messrs.

Ao ^ 3 of 1361 Office of tlie Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, Dulqaada 3, 1361 November 12, 1942 Messrs, Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Company Limited, Bahrain. Dear Sirs, SHAXKIi HAMAD BRIDGig . Yttth reference to your letter No, L/862 dated 8th November, 1942, as the bridge is now open for sea traffic from 12 noon till 1 P.M. and 12 midnight till 1 A,M. the hours during which special openings may be made for your craft will be from 10 A.M. till 2 P.M. and 10 P.M. till 2 A.M. 2. In this connection I must point out that much incon venience to the public and some damage to the bridge has been caused by the progress of some of your heavy steel barges crossing the bridge channel. On the last occasion road traffic was held up between Manama and Moharraq for lg hours through a large^sticking midway. 3. The actual damage, referred to in the State Engineer's letters Nos. MMC/40/61 of 24th August 1942 and MMC/48/61 of 20th October 1942 is comparatively light and it has been possible to repair it but the use of unwMdly barges, ruac ^® rs » iu heavy currents or rough weather is liable to cause serious damage to the structure of the bridge which might put it out of action. The satisfactory working of the bridge is of especial importance at present owing to military requirements. 4. No attempt should be made during rough weather or against a heavy current to take steel barges through the channel and two tugs, not one, should be used to tow the cargos. At present the boatmen have been tying towing bridge finders which is a dangerous practice. * bridge cannot be kept open for the passage of water erne craft for more than half an hour continuously.

A claim for the damage will be sent to you in due course. I would also point out that we have not yet received payment of our claim amounting to £ 3 . 26/- for damage caused to two fenders on 23rd August 1942. The remarks in my letters No.MMC/40/61 dated 24th August 1942 still apply, and as the Shamal season is approaching, perhaps you would let me have your suggestions. It would app ear that something must be done to avoid collision with the bridge, or divert your heavy barge traffic to avoid it. 3.Z.Copy of a letter No. 1(1110/40/61 dated 24th August 1942 from the State Engineer, Bahrain, to Messrs.
