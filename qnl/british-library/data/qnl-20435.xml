To Political Resident, at Bahrain. Repeated Government of India, Simla. No.3096. Bated 30th September (received 1st October) 1935. IMMEDIATE. h Your air mail letter of September 5th No.676*3 and previous correspondence regarding south eastern boundaries of Sa*udi Arabia. iti In the light of information now available His Majesty’s Government feel that it is impossible to disregard effective authority of Ibn Sa’ud over Al Murra or to attempt any settlement which does not take this fact into account. They also feel that there may be a reasonable prospect of reaching early settlement if Sir A. Ryan, during personal visit to Ibn Sa’ud, makes a final offer in as generous terms as circumstances permit. Such an offer would in effect (though not of course formally) give him Murra dira while preserving areas in North in regard to which for familiar reasons no compromise is possible. 2. Eastern boundary might run from point in the neighbourhood of SABKHAT MIJORA (which would be on Sa’udi &gt;■ side) approximately up to meridian 54 to its intersection with * x . parallel 23. regard to northern section it is desired to fix certain key points on which line could hinge. These would be based on principle laid down in paragraph 1 and should if possible be well recognised points in regard to which our claim can /■ A \k if - 2 - can be supported by convincing argument (e.g. collection of zakat by Shaikh or predominant use by our tribes). 4 # Following suggestion has been put forward. Line would leave DOHAT-ES-SALWA say four miles from t^ASR-ES-FAL1A viz. a little to the north of green line but south of ^atar concession boundary - and would go straight to western end of SABKHAT EL AMRA (key point A). This would give a small further concession to Ibn Sa’ud in an area to which he attaches great importance and would not abandon any territory claimed by Shaikh of Qatar* Exact point of departure on coast would have to be determined in the light of local considerationse.g. physical features. From point A line would run approximately due south to a second point B where it would join northern 3)-/iZ ■ MX edge of Murra dira as defined by Dickson* fells at DHUWAIHIU shown on Major Chessman's map have been suggested as possible point B. Thence boundary would run south east in straight line to join eastern line at a point mentioned in paragraph 2 above. 5 . Such a line would be at some distance from sea and would apparently safeguard rights of Shaikh but it is not clear without further information (a) if Dhuwaihin is satisfactory point to work 0 n (it is only marked with a query in Chessman's map and not at all in Thomas's while in Lorimer it is given as within boundary of AQAL) or if one of Thomas's wells e.g. NAKHALA or HALUWAIN would not be preferable; (b) what would be position of SUFAK. It might be necessary to make this well also a key point on line if in view of considerations such as that in (b) of your telegram of 10th July No.622 it can be shown bo be definitely within sphere of Abu Dhabi mut. outside Murra dira. is-, i iC L . no 6 . / 3-11^ [v MOQ' sir a. Ryan leaves London towards the end of October. It is therefore necessary to take firm decisions on key points. His Majesty* s G-overnment would be glad if subject to concurrence of Government of India you could now take immediate steps to make what local investigations are necessary for this purpose. If you cannot give definite reply in time without deputing special officer for investigations you may consider desirability of sending Dickson down urgently to make personal survey on the spot possibly with aid of aircraft. You will observe that area in question is small and survey could no doubt be made rapidly and without difficulties referred to in paragraph 1 of your air mail letter of August 31st C/267. ^ ~D-n$ y^ Object of survey would be limited to clearing up definition of minimum number of key points for line roughly dividing Murra dira from territory of Q,atar and Abu Dhabi between say meridians 51 and 52 taking ihto account desirability of meeting Ibn Sa*ud as far as possible without giving him access to sea to east of Qatar or to any territory legitimately claimed by Shaikhs. It should be borne in mind that line based gn these points would be a line on which we should definitely take our stand to admittance of letting negotiations break down rather than recede from it and should therefore so far as possible be one which we can defend by convincing arguments on tribal basis even though we do not accept this basis as the only or main factor in fixing boundary.

That as Shaikh Shakhbut was not present he wanted him(Hazza’) to give him a man who would be able to tell the names of the wells and places on the Qatar-Abu Dhabi frontier. Shaikh Haz^a replied that as his brother was away he could not assume the responsibility of sending one and asked that the matter should be left till the return of Shaikh Shakhbut. The P.R. said that he could not wait as he had important work to do and that he was leaving for Doha,, from where he would take a man and view the wells from the air. He hdded that it would be better if Shaikh Hazza* sent a man from Abu Dhabi to help in locating the places in question, v/hich would be in the interests of Abu Dhabi. That if he did not send a man to assist and pla,ces were not correctly identified it would not be in the interests of Abu Dhabi and that they should not afterwards blame the Government. Shaikh Hazza* said that as he was not the ruler he could not take the responsibility and that the matter should be left till the return of the Shaikh. A bedouin from the A1 Manasir tribe was then called and asked by the P.R. about certain places, of which he(P.R.) made a note. The P.R. then suggested that Shaikh Hazza* should think over the matter and that he was leaving me behind to get his final reply* ri fter the departure of the P.R. to the ship-2- lCA Shaikh conferred with hig brother Kbialid and Ahmad bin •Utaibah for more than two hours and although they sought to convince him that there was nothing to fear and urged him to send a man, he declined to do so, saying that he could not take upon himself the responsibility. 8.10.35 Tlopy given to Political Agent, BahrainNo. T/232 Dated 9th October 1935.

I arrived at Q.atar and sent the Head Munshi on shore to explain to Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Jasim that we bad exchanged calls quite recently and that as my business but that I would come on shore in the cool of the evening to discuss one or two matters with him. 9. I instructed the Head Munshi when giving this message we wanted two men to tell us the names of various wells from the air. The Shaikh, however, was unable to help us because in the case of his own subjects he did not like to send them because we would be going over what he regarded as his border and he did not want to run any risk of creating trouble for himself. Ke said that he tried to persuade two A1 Murrah to go with us but that they fled on hearing that they were expected to go over that area and to go up in an aeroplane. It was clearly useless to press the matter so I contented myself in limiting the scope of our reconnaissance. 3, ,s/hen I visited Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Jasim j.n the evening he said much the same to me. 4. I conveyed to Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Jasim the reply of Government that they had told Bin Sa’ud that they bad given the Shaikh a promise of protection and that correspondence on such matters should be througn His Majesty’s Government. The Shaikh was, I think, grateful for the message but I think that even now he is a little doubtful whether, when the time comes, His Majesty’s Government will actually afford him protection. 5. I did what I could, without giving away the fact that I thought s£c&gt;, to assure him that the promise ot protection is a genuine one. The truth is that since wa s pressing I proposed not to trouble him to pay a call the /the fate of the Shaikh of Mohammerah no one trusts any promise of protection that we give, j 6. I asked the Shaikh whether he had had any reply from Bin 3a’ud and he. (I think rather grudgingly) admitted that he had but asked what reply he should send I said that if he wished to give a polite reply to this last h+c communication he could just pay that he had seei^and understood that His Majesty’s Government had addressed the Sa’udi Government on the subject, 7, Three officers of H.M.S.Lupin and I dined with Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Jasim. 8, On the 11th October 1935 I proceeded from Lohah at 07,00 hours in a Victoria (Squadron Leader Land; to car^y out the proposed reconnaissance.

As area in question is empty desert this would not involve any further concession of material value but it might ease negotiations by bringing our offer as regards this section of line into closer relation with line claimed by Ibn 8 a ud (meridian 56). It is also understood that meridian 5b corresponds approximately with limit of Great Sands and therefore provides a more logical basis for delimitation. On the other hand in the absence of proof of claims by our proteges to sands between meridians 54 and 55 it is difficult to argue that Ibn Sa’ud should be confined to West of an arbitrarily fixed line leaving a vacuum on East of it • 3. If you are satisfied that area between meridians54 and 55 is sufficiently outside sphere of Muscat and Abu Dhabi to make it possible to concede it as part of final offer now to be made to Ibn Sa'ud I propose to agree with Foreign Office that this may be done on the understanding that this offer must be accepted as a whole and cannot be increased in any direction or on any account. 4 . as corollary northern limit of area to be conceded would run from key point B (which has still to be fixed) to intersection of meridian 55 and parallel 22 but in such manner as to leave the whole of SABKHAT MATTI to ABU DHABI. It would simplify determination of this section of line if you could reply early to question raised in paragraph 5 (b) of my telegram Ho.30-96 regarding possibility of justifying SUFAK as a key point C. \ i southern boundary of conceded area would run from intersection of meridian 55 and parallel 20 to intersection of meridian 52 with parallel 19 in such a way as to leave SABKHAT MUCHA to Ibn Sa 1 ud and RAMIAT MUGSHIB to Muscat, 6# Please telegraph your views as early as possible since Ryan’s present instructions have been left open on the point and it is of course a matter of urgency to give him precise instructions. For the same reason it is desired as regards northern section to obtain as soon as possible (a) your confirmation that western end of SABKHAT EL AMRA is suitable for key point A (b) information regarding location of key point B and (c) information regarding possibility of justifying a claim to SUEAK as key point C.

(7th Septemher) , relative to the question of Qatar, I beg to inform Your Excellency as follows: When His Majesty’s Government were informed hy me of your letter they were about to address the Saudi Government in regard to their action in corresponding direct ?*lth His Excellency the Sheykh of Qatar on a subject which, since I is Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom are res &gt;onsi &gt;le for the foreign relations of the Sheykh, falls within the sphere of my Government* His Majesty’s Government have learned with surprise that the Saudi Government address ed a letter to the Sheykh of Qatar on a matter which affects hie foreign relations, as these, as the Saudi Government are aware, are conducted by His Majesty’s Governm nt by virtue of their special treaty relation© with him. My Government trust that in future the \ Excellency Sheykr Yusuf Yasin, /Saudi uinietry for Foreign Affairs.Saudi Government will address them, and not the Sheyteh, if they have occasion to raise questions concerning ;/ atar. In this connection I beg to refer lour Excellency to the statement made by Sir Andrew Hyan to His Excellency Fuad Bey Hamza on the 20tn February last * I am glad to take this opportunity of explaining t Your Excellency that, after long negotiations, in which His Majesty’s Government participated and which they saw no rea on to delay, the Sheykh of Qatar on the l?th May last granted to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Com any, with the full approval of His Majesty’s Government, a concession for the exploitation of oil &amp;o* in hia territory* 3 X would also like to recall to Your Excellency that, as the Saudi Government have already been inform^ Hia Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom are prepared in derogation their strict legal rig ts, to offer to the Saudi Government important concessions at the northern end of the frontier line and to admit Saudi sovereignty up to the so-called Green Line M , which as has already been indicated to the Saudi Government is a line running from the head of Dohat-as- Silwa to a point five miles North-East of Sakak, thence /to@ ^ to a point five miles We at of Banaiyan, ana tiienee due South as far as Parallel 20 degrees North* But, as was pointed out to His Excellency Fuad Bey amza in London last June, this line represents the utmost concession •hieh His Majesty’© Oovernm nt in the United K ngoom are able to offer in t is area, conpati&gt;ly with t eir obligations to other rulers concerned* I ma^ add that the reasons why His Majesty*s Ucvernment in th&lt; United Kingdom are unahle to contemplate concessions in this sector were fully explained to His Excellency Fuad Bey* . The Southern limit of the oil concession granted U the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company by the Sheykh of Qatar does not extend beyond this 'Green Line', but lies to a considerable distance to the Hortii of it* The concession does not, therefore, extend to any territory under discussion with the Saudi Government. Moreover, I should inform Your Excellency that sis Majesty*s Government in the United Kingdom have formallj assured the Shwykh of Qatar of their protection against any interference with his territorial rights, more particularly over the area covered by the oil concess ion. In view of the language contained in the letter of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz to His Excellency the /SheykhSheykh of Qatai*, His Majesty 1 s dovernment feel tiaey must make this point claar and draw the attention of the Saudi Arab Government to the terms of Article VI of the Treaty of Jedda* By this Article, his Majesty King Abdul Azis undertook amon^ other things to main tain friendly relations with the Bheykh of Qatar, whose special treaty relations with His Majesty^ Government he explicitly recognises. In these circumstances. Your Excellency will appreciate that the frontier question cannot be affected by the grant or exploitation of this concession. I am happy, in conclusion, to assure Your Excellency that His Majesty’s Government appreciate and reciprocate the Saudi Government’s desire to reach an early agree ment on the frontier question and that they hope that discussions on this subject may profitably be resumed on Sir Andrew Ryan’s return to Arabia.

Present edge of Great Sands would jalao apparently give Ibn Sa*ud even more than he himself claims in north Hast. only possible course seems to be to adhere to decision reached that frontier should be defined by cartographical line between fixed co-ordinates but so drawn up as to take account so (Aso far as possible of tribal distribution, strategical consideration and known geographical features, it is hardly practicable at this late stage to reconsider whole question with a view to substituting different methods of definition* (a) on Eastern sector there is no advantage in suggesting alteration of Mis Majesty's (iov- -ernment’s decision to offer meridian 55 * (b) on Northern sector little advantage is likely to be gained by Loch raising v/ith Shaikh of Abu Dhabi question of offer of edge of ureat Sands. sut in any case i trust he will concentrate primarily upon securing answers to enquiries regarding key points recapitulated in paragraph 6 of my telegram do* 3386.^ 3.

(2) Line running approximately E^at by South from C^ASR SALWAH to KHOR AL ODAID as far as meridian 51 leaving rocky ground and hills of BARREL QATAR to QATAR and sandy ground South to Ibn Saud. U*'''' (3) Line running approximately South from intersection in (2) to HALUWAIN, leaving SABAKAT AL AMRA, XHAFUS, RIMS, FARHAD, AQAlAT AL MANASIR, DOTAIHIN and NAKHALA H tL &lt; to Abu Dhabi; and SAKAK, AMBAK, BIL DEIRISH (—?- KIRISH) RAGHUWAN and HALUWAIH to Ibn Saud. X (4) Line running approximately South East from HALUWAIN to intersection of meridian 53 and latitude 22 leaving KINAIYIF, UQ.DA, ADAIYIN, MIJHUT. HABARAN, ^araQARA to I bn Saud; and MI JAN', SUFUK, SABAKHAT AL 1CATTI, UMM AL AMAD, ABU RUWAWIL, BIL HAHNA, AL KHUBBA, KHOR TUWAIRISH and ^URaIN (not marked on map but is place to which Shaikh attaches much importance in the vicinity of group of 5 places mentioned immediately before it) to Abu Dhabi. y ..... (5) Line runs^ast from intersection of meridian V JlX 53 and latitude (Tomioolon} to intersection of mer idian 55 and latitude 22 leaving RAMLAT GHASAIWARA to Abu Dhabi. 2* Shaikh claims places allotted to him in (3) above on ground' that they are near coast which indubitably belongs to him, t ^|^ are on Doiia ^ to Abu Dhabi route and are frequented by JU*e lianasir. H© d«sor^ibed S^&amp;ICAJC 8 *nd AMBAK area^as having belonged to Abu Dhabi in the past but recognises that they now pertain to Ibn Saud. I ^ ' / think that it is probably that Ibn Saud may press claim(s) ' X to these places allocated to Abu Dhabi on ground of use by Al Murraho There is I consider some ground for this contention nowadays, but in spite of this, I think we should support Abu Dhabi because the places are more or less of one group and so near the Sea that if they were to be handed over to Ibn Saud it would in procti^e be almost impossible to prevent him absorbing coast. I regard this as real danger. „ 3. Shaikh claims place(s) allotted to him in (4) on ground that MIJAN and SABAKHAT AL MATTI fare in OAfi- coastal areas and on the Q,atar to Abu Dhabi route and are used by his Manasir and Bani Yas. ^ SUFUK is term ( ?uaed (mut) hill^country merging in salt marshes of SABAKHAH. SUFUK in question runs South from sea on West side of SABAK AL MATTI,About 10 miles from the Sea are the wells known as Swells of SUFUK where travellers wat er3 on ) Abu Dhabi before crossing SABAKHAT AL MATTI♦ Remaining places mentioned are claimed to be in areas principally of Bani Yas and Manasir. qURAIN, KHCR TUWAIRISH and MIJHUT may be items 29, 52 and in Fuad Bey^ list of 8 th July* 4. I should perhaps add that in each case Abu Dhabi claims are made also on the general grounds kt old and known ownership. 5&lt;» Shaikh emphasised that though Rashid bin Mani* lives at Hofuf his sons reside at Liwa and Manasir are properly an Abu Dhabi tribe. 6 . Shaikhni&amp;kes no repeat no claim South of latitude 22 or East of line running South from intersect* ion of latitude 22 and meridian 55, but he tells me that RAMLAT GHAFA and GHANIM are used by AW/illR from the vicinity of DHGFAR. It is therefore just possible that Sultan of Muscat may claim rights in those areas, but perhaps saving clause recommended^in paragraph 3 of my 804 September 22nd might cover any such claims. constitutes very real concession to Ibn Saud whilst safeguarding coast and essential interests in Trucial Oman.

His Majesty^ Government are not prepared to recognise the whole of these claims, which in the South certainly would encroach on territory which they recognise as appertaining to the Sultan. His Majesty's Government, however, see no objection to recognising ibn Baud’s claim to an area in the Great Sands extending Eastward at any rate as far as meridian 55 degrees between parallels 22 degrees and 20 degrees and in the South to a line drawn from the latter intersection to the intersection of meridian 52 degrees and parallel 19 degrees.

Since sending personal telegram this morning 1 have received Foreign Office telegram of Hovember 18th / 132 to Ledda which makes position perfectly clear* - RS3IDBHT - ////? Copy given tor- Sir Andrew Ryan, Political Agent, Bahrain.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT HIS Majesty’s Government are anxious to take advantage of your forth coming visit to King Abdul Aziz at Riyadh to resume, and if possible to advance, the negotiations which have been proceeding for a settlement of the eastern and south-eastern boundaries of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Indeed, it is probable that King Abdul Aziz himself will raise this question with you at an early stage, as I understand that it is one on which he feels strongly; and it is in fact the most important major question at issue between this country and Saudi Arabia at the present time. 2. You will recollect that after His Majesty’s Government had decided not to take their stand, so long as negotiations were proceeding, on a rigid adherence to the legal basis provided by the frontier laid down in this region by the Anglo- Turkish agreements of 1913-14, you were instructed, in November 1934, to open negotiations with the Saudi Government for an agreed settlement of this question by endeavouring in the first place to obtain an exact statement of King Abdul Aziz’s territorial claims. The Saudi Government’s response to your enquiry was delayed for several months, but they eventually furnished you, on the 3rd” April last, with a memorandum putting forward a claim to a vast area in South-Eastern Arabia, which was asserted to correspond to the areas frequented by certain tribes owing allegiance to King Abdul Aziz. You were already aware from the previous consideration which His Majesty’s Government had given to the matter that they were unable to entertain such extensive demands, and you therefore proceeded immediately to the next stage contemplated in your instruc tions and offered to Saudi Arabia a small strip of territory—the so-called “ green line ” concession—immediately to the east of the 1913-14 boundary. The subsequent departure of the Deputy Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs from Jedda rendered an immediate continuance of negotiations impossible, but the discussions were resumed with Fuad Bey Hamza himself during his visit to London last summer. 3. Despite the offer which was then made by His Majesty’s Government of a further territorial concession (bounded by the so-called “ brown line ”), it unfortunately proved impossible to reconcile the divergency between the point of view of His Majesty’s Government (as then agreed upon between all the various departments of His Majesty’s Government concerned) and that of King Abdul Aziz; and, on Fuad Bey’s departure towards the end of July, the discussions closed in what appeared to be a complete deadlock. 4. It was explained to the Saudi Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs during the course of these discussions that His Majesty’s Government were prepared, with a view to reaching an amicable settlement, to make limited concessions, to the east of the 1913-14 boundary, of territory which, like that comprised in the areas already offered to the King, could be shown to be predominantly utilised by tribes or settlements recognising his sovereignty. His Majesty’s Government considered, however, that no satisfactory or durable frontier could be constructed on a purely tribal basis, in view of the shifting- allegiance of the nomad tribes and of their wide and overlapping migrations. Tribal considerations were valuable where it could be shown that an area was predominantly or exclusively frequented by a certain tribe with an exclusive political allegiance, but historical, geographical and strategic considerations would also have to be taken into account. The object of His Majesty’s Govern ment was not to establish a rigid frontier in the European sense, but to work out a boundary as equitable as could be attained from all points of view, which would remove sources of uncertainty and friction by defining the territorial /.X. Av, * - EASTERN (Arabia). October 23, 1935. Section 1. Sir, Sir Samuel Hoare to Sir A. Ryan (on leave). Foreign Office, October 23, 1935. 8167 [12260] B2 limits within which Saudi Arabia and the other Arab States concerned would respectively be free to exercise full sovereignty. Fuad Bey Hamza replied that his Government considered that the only basis for a settlement was to establish and allocate the grazing grounds in accordance with the political allegiance of the desert tribes concerned. He maintained that the statement of King Abdul Aziz’s demands was drawn up on the basis of the grazing grounds of four tribal groups, in particular of the widespread Ahl Murra tribe, who acknowledged Saudi sovereignty; and, in support of the line claimed by King Abdul Aziz he communicated the names of 161 wells said to be owned by that tribe Fuad Bey criticised the concessions offered by His Majesty’s Government asbenw purely arbitrary and not in accordance with the material facts of the situation in the desert. The Saudi Government had, he said, worked out, after the most searching investigation and enquiry, a carefully plotted and rational boundary which took account of the political and tribal situation, and they were prepared to provide detailed evidence in support of their proposal; he insisted therefore that the next move lay with Flis Majesty’s Government, and that, if they did not agree with Saudi claims, it was for them to produce a detailed statement of their criticisms. Hitherto, he asserted, His Majesty’s Government had merely replied to the Saudi proposals by the simple counter-offer of an arbitrarily limited narrow area which failed to take account of the material facts. 5. His Majesty’s Government are reluctant to acquiesce in a continuance of the deadlock reached in the conversations with Fuad Bey Hamza last summer, without making any further attempt to reach an agreed settlement. As you yourself have advised, so long as this frontier question remains in its present indefinite state it stands in the way of the general and lasting settlement of Anglo-Saudi differences which His Majesty’s Government are anxious to bring about. Moreover, the rapid development of oil exploitation on the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf renders it very desirable that a definite limit should be drawn between territories which would be recognised as being under the sovereignty of King Abdul Aziz on the one hand, and as being under that of the rulers of Qatar, of the Frucial Coast States and of Muscat on the other. You will recollect that only in September last Flis Majesty endeavoured to stop the grant of an oil concession by the Sheikh of Qatar to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, on the P^ r f °f the concession area was included in his territorial claims. If the frontier is not settled there is a risk that similar difficulties may arise from the exploitation of the oil deposits in the Trucial Sheikhdoms if oil concessions should be granted therein. 6. It is clear, therefore, that every effort should be made, especially at fV, 6 J?? esen k cri t lca l juncture in world affairs, to reach an agreed settlement of e dispute, to put an end to an uncertain and unsatisfactory situation, and to lemove a source of friction which has alreadv had an unfortunate effect upon the general course of Anglo-Saudi relations: With this object in view His Majesty s Government, after obtaining fresh information from the British authorities of the Persian Gulf and of the Aden Protectorate, have reconsidered • ^—question, and they are prepared to go to the extreme limit of concession m the endeavour to formulate new proposals to meet the claims of King Abdul T Z fif ! n 6 &amp; lea ^ s f possible measure. They have accordingly decided to au orise you to seek a favourable opportunity during the course of vour forth coming visit to Kiyadh to resume negotiations in the matter, if possible with vmg Abdul Aziz himself, but otherwise with his Ministers, and to furnish you with the following instructions for your guidance. i • ° U ^ n t 0rm ^ n o King Abdul Aziz that, as a result of the nf ih c 101 f S W1 1 F o Uad h Hamza last summer in London, the whole question . e frontiers m South-Eastern Arabia has been fully reconsidered by Hm S T ^vcrnment, after consultation with the local 1 British authorities m ^1«imori h 11 i? ai 1Cl I f 1 , ^ 1S . Ma j est y s Government have re-examined the boundary t . K Ul .

You should emphasise the importance which His Majesty’s Government attach to their historic position in the Persian Gulf, and the impossibility of their agreeing to any solution which might in any way prejudice or impair that position or injure the interests of the Arab States with whom they are in special treaty relations. 8. At this stage you may at your discretion decide to inform King Abdul Aziz that you are in possession of new proposals by His Majesty’s Government, Before describing these proposals you desire, however, to make it clear why His Majesty’s Government, after full and sympathetic enquiry into the material facts of the situation, have not felt able to accept the boundary which the King had himself suggested. You should then proceed to explain in detail the reasons which prevent His Majesty’s Government from accepting the boundary proposed in the Saudi memorandum of the 3rd April last, developing for this purpose the relevant arguments used in discussion with Fuad Bey Hamza last summer as set out in the records of the meetings. 9. Beginning at the northern end of the proposed Saudi line you should point out the importance which His Majesty’s Government attach to establishing a frontier in accordance with geographical, as well as political and tribal, considerations. The Qatar peninsula forms a clearly defined and separate geographical unit, and it is only reasonable that the frontier between the Sheikhdom and its neighbours should follow the natural division between the peninsula and the mainland. His Majesty’s Government have already expressed readiness to depart from their strict 'legal position by recognising King Abdul Aziz’s sovereignty as extending over the western shore of the gulf known as the Dohat-as-Salwa and over the Ikhwan settlements at the head of the Gulf; but they could never consent to attribute to Saudi Arabia features, such, for example, as the Jebel Naksh, which form an integral part of the physical structure of the Qatar Peninsula itself and have always, in fact, been an equally integral part of the Sheikhdom. An additional factor in regard to the frontier of Qatar’ is the grant by the Sheikh to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, with the full approval of His Majesty’s Government, of an oil concession over the Sheikhdom of Qatar. This concession, which was granted on the 11th May last, while not extending beyond the limits of the State of Qatar^ as claimed by the Sheikh of Qatar and recognised as his territory by His Majesty’s Government,, does actually extend to the south of the line claimed by King Abdul Aziz (cf. paragraph 5 above); but the position in this respect will be already known to His Majesty through the communication which I instructed Mr. Calvert to make by my telegram No.Hl2 of the 20th September. Should you decide to ad\eit to' - ^* this development, you should take the opportunity to recall the fact that His Majesty’s Government have formally assured the Sheikh of Qatar of their protection against any interference with his territorial rights. 10. Turning to the problem of the Khor-al-Odeid (to which Fuad Bey Hamza attached special importance), you will explain to King Abdul Aziz that, as Fuad Bey was informed in London, His Majesty’s Government have long recognised officially the validity of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi s claim to the whole of this inlet, and have regarded his territory as extending round both the Khor-al- Dhuwaihin and the Khor-ai-Odeid up to a line, running westwards from the northern side of the mouth of the Khor-al-Odeid, which forms the^ boundary between the territory of Abu Dhabi and that of Qatar. His Majesty s Govern ment naturally cannot violate or disregard their obligations to these Arab rulers with whom, as the King has recognised by article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, they have long-standing and special treaty relations. Should you consider it wise or desirable to do so, you are authorised to develop frankly to the King a further argument which was used with Fuad Bey Hamza in London, namely, that His Majesty’s Government have had for many years a particularly strong interest in the chain of Arab States on the coast between Qatar and Muscat,^ that the maintenance of this position is an important principle of British policy in the Persian Gulf; and that it would be at complete variance with this policy for them to agree that a powerful State such as Saudi Arabia should acquire a new outlet to the sea on this section of the coast, to which neither political nor geographical considerations entitle it. 11 Pursuing your replv to the claims put forward m the Saudi memorandum of the 3rd April you should explain that a thorough reinvestigation of the- [12260] B 2situatioi} has now been made by the British authorities in the Persian Gulf in order to ascertain the precise limits of the territory of the Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi in the hinterland of the coastal strip. As a result it has been established that the district known as A1 Aqal, the Sabkhat Matti salt marshes, and the districts shown on the maps as Bainunah, Dhafrah and Qufat-al-Liwa’ all of which lie outside the area predominantly covered by the Ahl Murra tribe’ are within the historic possessions of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. His Majesty’s Government are accordingly unable to agree to the eastward prolongation of the proposed boundary being carried as near to the sea coast as suggested in the Saudi memorandum of the 3rd April, since this would, in their opinion, be incompatible with their obligation to protect the rights of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. Similarly, they can find no justification for the extension of the claims of King Abdul’ Aziz as far east as meridian 56°, since this would result in the inclusion in Saudi territory of the steppe country beyond the Great Sands, and of the grazing grounds of tribes owing allegiance either to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi or to the Sultan of Muscat. 12. You will then inform King Abdul Aziz that the tribal position on the southern fringe of the Ruba-al-Khali desert and in the northern part of the Hadhramaut has also been the subject of detailed reinvestigation since the state ment of his boundary claim was received last April. As a result His Majesty’s Government are satisfied that the tribes depending on the Aden Protectorate—and in particular the A1 Saiar, A1 Manahil, Ahl Kathir and Ahl Mahra—normally range not only to the edge of the Great Sands between parallels 17° and 19° North, but for some little distance into the sands themselves. You should explain that His Majesty’s Government were informed by Fuad Bey Hamza, during the course of the conversations in London last summer, that King Abdul Aziz did not claim the allegiance of these tribes, and their enquiries have now definitely shown that the southern and south-eastern limits of the district predominantly frequented by the Ahl Murra (which they understand to form the basis of the Saudi claims in this area) do not extend to the edge of the sands, but lie a considerable distance to the north and north-west of the line claimed in the Saudi memorandum of the 3rd April. 13. You should then proceed formally to put forward the new offer which His Majesty’s Government, in the light of the foregoing considerations, have now resolved to make, emphasising once more that it is made with every desire to meet the wishes of King Abdul Aziz to the furthest possible extent, but adding in no. ambiguous terms that it represents a final concession which His Majesty's Government will not he able to increase. I trust that you will thus dispel as far as possible any impression in the King’s mind that, in now putting forward proposals much more favourable to him than the two territorial concessions already offered, His Majesty’s Government would be likely to yield still further m response to continued bargaining on his part. As you are aware, this is a n° India Office attach much importance. You should explain that the new boundary which you are about to offer has been carefully worked out and that, while the ^ geographical, historical and political considerations mentioned m the preceding paragraphs have naturally been taken into full consideratioiy the new proposals also take account of the full and detailed infor mation which His Majesty s Government have now received from their local authorities m Arabia regarding the wanderings and habitats of the Ahl Murra n e. in the light of this information His Majesty’s Government are prepared fn a f ITw 1 / P rmci P le t0 recognise King Abdul Aziz’s claim to the allegiance of e Murra tribe, and they have endeavoured to align their proposed boundary /?&lt; I- 8 a ? far as P oss . ible within Saudi Arabia the grazing grounds of this tribe C USne ,V 0r P re( ^ 0In i nan fly utilised by the various nomadic sections f a/t^ S ^ • re ^, ware ’ f be Political Agent at Koweit has recently reported that the Murra dira appears to be bounded on the north, east and south by a line i unning from a point south of Hofuf parallel to but inland from the neck of the Da tar Peninsula, continuing m a south-easterly direction along the southern r-ornpr nf th • marS ^’• turn i n g south-south-east at the south-eastern nJ u Sabkhat ^ attl ; runnmg thence straight across the Eastern Rub'-al- - 4 o&lt; v 8 f l r aS Ml .]ora (approximately at the intersection of meridian i- -x n r&gt; Pp ra e A j^-)’ an d thence sweeping westwards, within the southern rea ^ands, so as just to include the important group of wells atShanna : I enclose herein a copy of a valuable sketch map prepared by Colonel Dickson to illustrate the result of his recent enquiries^ 1 ) 15. You are authorised to make such use as you think best of this infor mation; but you should be careful not to give the impression that His Majesty’s Government have in any way abandoned their objections, as explained to Fuad Bey Hamza in London, to basing the frontier solely on tribal considerations. To do so might only encourage the belief that His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to modify their offer in the light of further statements regarding tribal settlements or “ diras,” and might lead the Saudi Government to embark on a lengthy, and inevitably fruitless, argument as to the precise areas covered by tribal migrations. At the same time, you should make the best possible use of the fact that, in their new proposals, His Majesty’s Government are offering to recognise the sovereignty of King Abdul Aziz over practically the whole “ dira” of the Ahl Murra tribe, even as defined by the information communicated by Fuad Bey Hamza at the time of the conversations in London. 16. After these preliminary observations you should, subject to confirmation by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf of the exact location of key-points A and B mentioned in sub-paragraphs {a) and (b) below, and to further tele graphic instructions in regard to the eastern sector of the frontier dealt with in sub-paragraph (c) below, make a formal offer of the following line as the boundary between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on the one hand and the Sheikhdoms of Qatar and Abu Dhabi (in special relations with His Majesty’s Government), the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, and the Aden Protectorate, on the other :— {a) A line starting from a point on the eastern shore of the gulf known as the Dohat-as-Salwa about 4 miles to the north-east of the settlement of Qasr-as-Salwa, running thence in a straight line to a point, which may for convenience of reference be called t£ Key-point A,” which will probably lie at the western extremity of the salt lake known as Sabkhat-al-Amra. (5) From this point the line will run roughly due south to a point to be known as “ Key-point B.” This point, when fixed, will be situated approxi mately on the northern boundary of the Murra “ dira! 1 ” as drawn in the light of the latest information in the possession of His Majesty’s Government (i.e., on Colonel Dickson’s map (see paragraph 14 above)). It is proposed to fix this key-point B at some well on the southern edge of the district known as A1 Aqal {i.e., a short distance east of the intersection of meridian 51° E. with parallel 24° N.) to which a positive claim can be advanced on behalf of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. The Political Resident is still making enquiries as to the precise points at which these two key-points A and B could reasonably and properly be fixed, and further instructions will be sent to you as soon as his reports have been received and a decision has been reached by His Majesty’s Government thereon. {c) From key-point B it is proposed that the boundary should proceed, generally speaking, in a straight line, but so as to leave the whole of the Sabkhat Matti to Abu Dhabi to the intersection of parallel 22° N. with meridian 54° or 55° E. and thence down whichever of those meridians is decided on to its intersection with parallel 20° N. The Political Resident is being consulted on the question of substituting meridian 55° E. for meridian 54° E., as originally proposed, for this sector of the line, and further instructions will be sent to you on this point as soon as possible. (d) Thence the boundary will run in an approximately straight line, but so as to leave the Sabkhat Mijora in Saudi Arabia and the Ramlat Mugshin in Muscat and Oman, to the intersection of meridian 52° E. and parallel 19° N. (namely the south-eastern corner of the area— the so-called ‘ £ brown line ” concession—offered to Fuad Bey Hamza in London last July), and thence in a straight line to the intersection of parallel 18° N. with the ££ violet line ” of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914. f 1 ) Not reproduced.6 17. Your detailed comments on the proposed line, which you may make at whatever stage seems to you most appropriate, should be based on the followino- considerations : You should make what capital you can out of the small further concession which the new line offers at its northern end, in that it lies considerably east of the so-called 1 k green line ’ ’ which you were instructed to offer to the Saudi Government last April. You should emphasise that, as a result of their further thorough study of the matter, His Majesty’s Government are now prepared fully to admit the Saudi claim to the wells at Banaiyan, to which Fuad Bey attached such particular importance last summer. You should also lav stress on the fact that the sector of the line defined in sub-paragraph (b) of the preceding paragraph represents a genuine attempt to meet the Saudi claim while respecting the territory of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. You will then do your best to make it clear, while not letting it be thought that the line is drawn on a purely tribal basis, that the line now proposed leaves within Saudi Arabia the whole of the Murra £ ‘ dira ’ ’ according to the latest information in the possession of His Majesty’s Government (see paragraph 14 above). Moreover, in carrying the boundary as far east as they are now doing, His Majesty’s Government will be recognising the authority of King Abdul Aziz as extending beyond the c ‘dira” of the Murra tribe into the southern part of that of the Manasir, who are a tribe predominantly based on territory under the sovereignty of Abu Dhabi. You may then point out that the southern section of the proposed line, described in sub-paragraph (d) of the preceding paragraph, leaves not only the whole of the Murra ‘ £ dira ’ ’ in this region within Saudi territory, but also the important wells at Shanna, although these are used by tribes from the Aden Protectorate almost as much as by the Ahl Murra. In conclusion, it will be well for you to explain that, although the proposed boundary, like that proposed by King Abdul Aziz himself, is in its eastern and southern sections necessarily artificial, and based mainly on geographical co-ordinates, His Majesty’s Government are satisfied that it represents a fair and reasonable division between the various suzerainties concerned. 18. Lastly, you should make every endeavour to ensure that in any settle ment eventually reached all tribes are left free to use their normal wells and grazing grounds on whichever side of the line they may be situated. Ip; Basing yourself on the broad lines of the instructions contained in the preceding paragraphs, I request that you will make every effort to secure the acceptance in 'princi'ple by King Abdui Aziz of the new boundary proposed by His Majesty s Government. In the event of agreement being reached, they are still inclined to favour the procedure suggested in paragraph 8 of Sir J. Simon’s e egram ho. 70 of the 1st May, namely, the incorporation of the new line in a sing e compiehensive instrument in which the frontier would be defined as being between Saudi Arabia on the one hand and Qatar, Abu Dhabi, Muscat and the en 1 ?tectorate on the other. This point is, however, premature at the present ime, as is a so the question of the possible final demarcation of the frontier in the vicinity of the Qatar peninsula. I am, &amp;c. SAMUEL HOARE.ENCLOSUhE N COLONIAL OFFfCE COVERING LETTER DATED C'trjUy ~ c^JT' ^ 1935 Dov/ning Street, 6 November, 1935. Sir, With reference to the correspondence ending with your telegram No. 91 of the 13th October, I have the honour to transmit to you a copy of a letter from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to Sir Andrew Ryan containing instructions for the conduct of the forthcoming negotiations at Riyadh with King Abdul Aziz regarding the eastern and south-eastern boundaries of Saudi Arabia. 2. You will observe from paragraph 16 (c) of the instructions that it is now proposed, subject to the concurrence of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to substitute meridian 55° E for meridian 54° E as the eastern limit of the concession of territory to King Abdul Aziz. The reasons for this proposal are set out in the accompanying copy of a telegram from the Secretary of State for India to the Political Resident. Although the effect of this proposal ?/ould be to concede to the King a small area south of the line described in f paragraph 3 of my telegram No. 30 of the 9th of October, the area affected is to the north and east of the Hadramaut and the frontier would still conform to the minimum desiderata described in paragraph 8 (4) of Mr. Ingrams* note of the 19th August, 1935, a copy of whichwhich accompanied Lieutenant-Colonel Lake's secret despatch of the 20th of August.

I explained general characteristic of new proposal to Fuad November 24th. Cn November 25th I gave him notes of an illustrative map® Before he could study them 1 explained to King in our basis of proposals and urged them most strongly on his acceptance. 2. On November 26th Fuad replied on behalf of King. He described proposal as unacceptable and was specially insistent on includion of JEEEL NAKSH in Saudi Arabia. He reasserted claim to KHOR AL ODEID also but less confidently. I was adamant about both but hinted guardedly at possible extension of our offer East of line J to G. F|iad intimated readiness to consider intermediate line between ours from G to H and on to violet line and line which they had claimed on April 3rd in this area. 3. I renewed to King personally that afternoon appeal to accept proposal of His Majesty*s Government but without success. 4. Fuad’s most important new point regarding Qatar boundary was that we were asking more for Shaikh than he himself /2 - Mmself had claimed tn the past. Fuad maintained that Shaikh had at one time begged Ibn Saud more as a favour than as a right to leave him undisturbed in JEBEL BUKHAJJ and ARAIQ. King had acquiesced in this at the time and no longer pressed claim to ARAIQ, which had been made in memorandum of April 3rd but he could not give up JEBEL EAKSH. Fuad asserted that corsespondence on the subject between Shaikh and Ibn Jiluwi was prior to Amglo-qatar Treaty of 1916. He suggested Shaikh was their free agent and that agreement with Ibn Jiluwi was therefore juridically binding. He also urged that JEBEL 1TAKSH was necessary for defence of SALWA and that a frontier between it and JEBEL DUKHAH would correspond with natural features. 5. I resisted these arguments to the best of ray ability. !y impression was that Fuad's instructions were to keep HAKSH at all costs but that King would a bandon KEOR ODEID. This was confirmed by non-commital ( personal ) language of Fuad November 28th. 6. I asserted strongly position of His Majesty's Government in regard to Coastal Rulers generally and emphasised promise of protection which they had given Shaikh of Qatar. 7. Principal advance made so far is that King no longer approaches matter with the bitterness which he displayed last year at TAIF. He realises that he cannot secure all that he asked for in memorandum of April 3rd but he hopes to bargain for better terms than His Majesty's Government have offered. I gave him and Fuad no encourage ment to expect further concessions. I told latter that in any case you were unlikely to decide anything pending receipt of detailed report. 8. /Reference:- S.10843/24/1 Sir, Air Headquarters, British Forces in f lraq, H i n a i d i # 19th November, 1935.

AMONG the subordinate questions which will require settlement as a preliminary to the proposed formal prolongation of the Treaty of Jedda is that of the assurance given in the note of the 19th May, 1927, from Sir Gilbert Clayton to King Abdul Aziz in regard to the export of arms and ammunition from the United Kingdom to Saudi Arabia. For convenience of reference I enclose copies of that document and of King Abdul Aziz’s reply thereto which are numbered (5) and ( 6 ) in the series of notes exchanged at the time of the signature of the Treaty of Jedda. ^ * 2. In your despatch No. 113 of the 11th April last, regarding the proposal of the Saudi Government for the specific prolongation of the Treaty of Jedda, you reported that the Deputy Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs was anxious to maintain the position created by these two notes, in regard to the question of the export of arms from this country to Saudi Arabia. To this end Fuad Bey had inserted the following paragraph in the draft note to prolong the Treaty of Jedda, which, he suggested, should be addressed to you by the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs :— “ (2) The two letters exchanged between His Majesty the King and General Clayton, dated the 17th DhuT Qada, 1345 (the 19th May, 1927), in respect of the trade in arms, shall continue in force as long as the treaty itself remains in force.” You stated that you had taken the opportunity in the course of your discussion with Fuad Bey to point out that His Majesty’s Government would have to consider his proposal on this point, since the situation in regard to the trade in arms had changed since 1927, and since, in particular, much attention had recently been given to the purchase of arms abroad by belligerent countries. 3. The question of the assurance of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the export of arms to Saudi Arabia was subsequently raised during the conversations with the Deputy Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs in London last summer. Fuad Bey was informed at the final meeting on the 18th July that His Majesty’s Government would be prepared in principle to extend the validity of the i reaty of Jedda by means of an exchange of notes, provided that a satisfactory settlement were reached on the question of slavery and the other outstanding points of less importance. Among these was the question of the supply of arms, and it was explained that it would be necessary for His Majesty s Government to quality their assurance on this point in order to biing it into line with any existing or impending international commitments in legald to arms traffic by which they were or might be bound. Any such qualification would, however, be one of purely general application, involving no discrimination against Saudi Arabia as such. In reply Fuad Bey expressed once more the objections of his Government to any form of discrimination, and said that they could only agree to safeguards, such as those involved in the special zones of the 1925 Arms Traffic Convention, if they were embodied in general terms applying to the world as a whole The discussions on this subject closed on the understanding that a new formula would be drafted to embody the original assurance of His Majesty’s Government in revised and up-to-date terms. , • i , 4 As a result of further examination of this matter 1 am advised that, despite the doubt which prevails as to the exact legal connexion between the Treatv of Jedda and the subsidiary notes exchanged at the same time, the under- takino- given to King Abdul Aziz in Sir Gilbert Clayton’s note of the 19th May, 1927 is actually co-terminous with the main treaty. It follows that the note [556 f—1]2 would automatically continue to be valid if the Treaty of Jedda itself were to be prolonged, and it accordingly becomes necessary to consider as a preliminary to the formal extension of the treaty what modifications should be introduced in the wording of the original undertaking. 5 The original assurance given by Sir Gilbert Clayton was qualified by a reference to the conditions of the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925 as prescribing the procedure which should be followed in connexion with orders for the export of arms from the United ixingdom to Saudi Arabia. This convention has never come into force. Nevertheless, I am advised that it must still be considered to represent the international standard for the control of the traffic in arms; it has actually been ratified conditionally by the United Kingdom since 1927, and it is clearly impossible to replace it for the purpioses of the assurance to the Saudi Government by a reference to the draft convention which was prepared | at Geneva in April i935 by the Committee for the Regulation of the Trade in and Private and State Manufacture of Arms and Implements of War, and which has only received a first reading. The convention of 1925 may, m fact, be considered to have acquired more authority since the exchange of notes with Kino- Abdul Aziz in 1927, and it is noteworthy that its provisions are utilised as a standard of control in the Four-Power Treaty of August 1930 regulating the importation of arms and ammunition into Abyssinia. In the circumstances I consider that the reference to the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925 should be maintained in any new version of the assurance. . „ „ 6 I am advised that the actual effect of the reference to the Arms Iraflic Convention of 1925 is to qualify the original assurance of His Majesty’s Govern ment by making it subject to all the conditions specified in the convention, including those concerning licences and the machinery to ensure that arms are destined solely for the Government of the country ordering them. At the same time articles 33 and 34 of the convention of 1925 introduce safeguards and qualifications in regard to time of war and the obligations arising out of d 16 Covenant of the League of Nations and other treaty instruments. Nevertheless, I remain of the opinion that these safeguards are not sufficient in present inter national conditions, since it is desirable that His Majesty’s Government should make provision for embargoes which they might be compelled to impose, not merely in fulfilment of actual obligations under the Covenant of the League but also in accordance with any recommendations of the Council under article of the Covenant; or even for the purpose of taking unilateral action to safeguard 7. In order to enable His Majesty’s Government to fulfil their obligations and to exercise an unfettered influence for the preservation of peace I consider, therefore, that Sir Gilbert Clayton’s note of the 19th May, 1927, should not be renewed, but should be replaced, as soon as practicable, by a new assurance to be given to King Abdul Aziz on the lines of the following formula “ I am empowered by His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom to inform you that, subject to the conditions laid down in the Geneva ims Traffic Convention of 1925, His Majesty’s Government will not, so ong as the treaty signed at Jedda on the 20th May, 1927, remains m force prevent the export from the United Kingdom of arms, &amp;c., purchased y Saudi Arabian Government for their own use from manufacturers m United Kingdom, in normal circumstances. Nevertheless, having re g a to developments in the matter of the control of the exports of arms sin 1927, His Majesty’s Government must reserve the right to SUS P , temporarily the operation of this assurance in circumstances in wtucn i international obligations of His Majesty’s Government or any circumstan connected with any war or threat of war should render it necessary. 8 . At your own request I have furnished you, without delay, explanations in the preceding paragraphs in order that you may be in posse of my considered views for your guidance if it prove necessary to discu s subject with King Abdul Aziz or his Ministers. At the same time the quesi of the supply of arms remains a subsidiary point connected with the , of the Treaty of Jedda, which is in its turn dependent on a satisfactory settiei ^ of the important question of slavery. It would thus be premature toi } take the initiative in discussing this particular question until a S re p nien p ^ been reached on the slavery issue, and the question of the prolongation otreaty has become more immediate. In the event, however of Kins Abdul Aziz H or hls M t imstel ' s raisl “f th e matter, either at Riyadh or’after yfur retum to your post, you are authorised at your discretion to propose the formula set HI out m the preceding paragraph to replace the undertaking given in Sir Gilbert % Clayton’s above-mentioned note.

RQlfriERS. \bMr ; On November 2?th the S^udi Minister, with whom I hf'.d been lunching, raised the question of the south eastern Arabian frontiers with special reference to the Qatar Oil Concession, I found that Sheikh Hafiz had not c?.cnrly realised the position about the concession and I explained to him, with the aid of a map produced by Mr# Seda, that the concession was for a limited area which was described on a map attached to the concession, and that although in one place it extended slightly beyond the maximum frontier claimed by King Abdul Aziz, it did not, in fact extend to what we regarded as the frontier between Qatar and Saudi /rabla# The limit of the concession in fact lay well to the North of the maximum line which we had been able to offer to King Abdul Aziz# There was no question of an unlimited ^blanket cone east on”, as in the case of the Saudi concession to the Standard Oil Company of California, and in view of our known views on the frontier question there could be no question of the concession extending over territory the sovereignty over which was in any real doubt. Sheikh Hafiz did not dissent from this explanation and did not pursue the matter further, but the conversation then turned on the question of the south-eastern frontier© of Arabia as a whole. As Sir A. Ryan had by then almost certainly already made hi© offer to King Abdul , ziz I saw no reason for not giving an outline of it to the Minister, and I accordingly gave him a rough explanation of the line which Sir A. Ryan had been autharised to propose. Sheikh Hafiz rather surprised me by appearing extremely disappointed that we had not been able to offer any further concession to King Ibn Saud in the neighbourhood of Khor el Odeid. ' it2 I explained to him why this was impossible, and reminded him that I had made it absolutely clear, both to himself and to Fuad Bey, last summer, why we could not agree to King Ibn oaud acquiring a new outlet to the sea between Abu Dhabi and Qatar, I emphasised, however, that the whole of the Hurra dira fell within the terrjttdcy which we were now prepared to recognise as under Saudi sovereignty, and that the line which Sir A. fiyan had been authorised to offer the King approximated for a great part of its length very closely to the line claimed by the King himself, I think it is as well that th Saudi Minister and Mr, Zada should have had a fairly clear statement of the proposals which Sir A* Byan will have made to the King, as the accounts which they will get from irabia may well be slightly misleading.

Ryan to Sir Samuel Hoare.—(Received December 30.) (No. 351.) ^ r ’ Jedda, December 10 , 1935. WIID reference to my telegram No. 215 of the 8 th December, I have the honour to forward herewith copies of the note, based on your telegram No. 132 of the 18th November, by which I informed Fuad Bey on the 25th November of the proposals of His Majesty’s Government regarding the eastern and south eastern boundaries of Saudi Arabia, together with a record of my conversations on the subject in Riyadh and an annexed note by Captain de Gaury of what Fuad Bey told me about the Araiq area. I have thought it desirable to make the record of conversations as full as possible. 2. When I went to Riyadh I was in some doubt as to whether Ibn Saud was really keen on a settlement of the question or would prefer to maintain his claims of the 3rd April intact rather than agree to any compromise. The impression I got during the discussions was that the King, though out for a bargain, and a hard one, was genuinely desirous of an agreement. It became more and more apparent to me as we went on that the most crucial issue, though by no means the only one, was the Jebel Nakhsh. 3. The form taken by the conversations in Riyadh made it difficult for me to adhere strictly to the order of the arguments set forth in your despatch No. 309 of the 23rd October, but the record will show that I made full use of them all with the King or with Fuad Bey Hamza, or with both. 4. I had in mind throughout the first two sentences of paragraph 13 of the despatch just quoted regarding the finality of the new British offer. I was all the more anxious to emphasise the views of His Majesty’s Government regarding their position vis-a-vis the Sheikh of Qatar and the other Persian Gulf rulers, and more particularly to let the King understand that any active interference in the south of the Qatar Peninsula would involve him in a dangerous clash with His Majesty’s Government. The possibility of such interference is to my mind the chief disadvantage that might result from leaving the whole question unsettled, now that His Majesty’s Government have made an offer handsome enough to deprive Ibn Saud of any reasonable ground for hm former grievence that His Majesty’s Government were trying to deny his ancestral claims and to “ come the Turk over him.” 5. You will notice that, although the King made a reference, which I preferred to ignore, to bis relations with his Arab neighbours, Fuad Bey did not openly on this occasion contest my arguments as to the effect of our treaties with the Persian Gulf rulers and article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda. In dealing with this subject I anticipated to a large extent the instructions in your despatch No. 334 of the 19th November, which reached me on the 8 th December. Fuad Bey has a far better legal brain than Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, and, instead of sustaining the Sheikh’s thesis, he developed a more ingenious argument of his own, namely, that as the Anglo Qatar Treaty was not concluded until 1916, His Majesty’s Government must respect an alleged earlier agreement, by which the Sheikh of Qatar recognised Ibn Saud’s right to the Jebel Nakhsh. You will doubtless instruct me as to how I should reinforce my extempore counter-argument, especially if enquiries on the Persian Gulf side disclose any reason for accepting Fuad Bey’s suggestion that the sheikh had before 1916 recognised Ibn Saud’s right to the Jebel Nakhsh. 6 . I find that, owing to my lack of preparedness for Fuad Bey’s argument, I overlooked one point, which I think had escaped him also, namely, that a former Sheikh of Qatar entered into special relations with His Majesty’s Government by a formal agreement, dated the 12 th September, 1868. You may think it ’ possible to make use of this fact, even though the agreement of 1868 did not give His Majesty’s Government control of the foreign relations of Qatar. 8261 [581 gg—3]7 If His Majesty’s Government adhere sH^tly to the terms of the first f ^ of oaraeraph 13 of your despatch No. 309 of the 23rd October, there must I think be a prolonged^ deadlock. That may be no bad thing in all tL ci™ ^ personally think, though I write with great deference to other views that it would really mattei nine i is Majesty s Government were to agree to a compromise m the southern area, but I am conscious of the great difficulty of giving up the Jebel Naksk In this connexion “ would be useful for me to have for my own use a sketch, showing the limits of he oU concession area and of the protection area m the south of Qatar. I was shown a sketch of this kind in London, but my files here do not seem to contain definite information regarding the two areas. L j o 8 I would draw Ittention to two other Matters which I did not consider it necessary to mention in my telegram under reference. The hist is what Fuad Bev said as set forth in paragraph 20 of the enclosed record, about the position Vila vis the Yemeni Government. I trust that you will approve of the general ine which I took in regard to this unexpected subject. The other matter has to do with the proceedings of Colonel Felly m and about 1865 (see paragraphs 12 and 13 of the record). This is only important as a matter of convincing Ibn Sand of the good faith of His Majesty’s Government. , ,, r . 9. ” I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosures to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Bushire^ Bahiem^nd A en. \ ATTYPTT W PVAN Enclosure 1.

Ryan. q a ^ in Riyadh late in the afternoon of the 23rd November. Ibn Saud received myself and my staff next morning, but the audience was one of courtesy only. That day, the 24th November, after luncheon, Fuad Bey expressed a wish to have a general talk about the business side of my visit. It had already been made pretty clear that the Saudis fully expected official matters to be m y sta N and Fuad Bey started our conversation on the 24th November by asking me what I had in view. I explained that I had come equippe with instructions on various subjects and that, as on previous occasions, I shou d welcome an opportunity of stating to the King in person the views of His Majesty s Government, although His Majesty would probably wish me to discuss the details with his advisers. I reviewed the questions which had been discussed with Fuad Bey in London in July. I had new instructions regarding the question of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. This. 1 said, was the most important outstanding question. I would put second the question of Saudi-Koweit economic relations, and third that of the prolongation of the validity of the Treaty of Jedda, with the three connected questions of slavery, arms traffic and the language of the treaty. I had instructions on all these matters. I had instructions on the question of air facilities also, but I thought it might be better to leave that until after my return to Jedda. As for the Transjordan question, the position was that we were expecting a reply to the letter which Mr. Rendel had written to Fuad Bey on the 19th July. 2 . This record deals only with the question of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers. In our conversation on the 24th November I explained to Fuad Bey the general nature of my new instructions. I emphasised the position of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the Arab States o n the Persmn Gulf. Fuad Bey might, I said, dislike the pretensions of a non-Arab Btafe to concern itself with Arabian affairs, but they were founded on an historic evolution. We could not contemplate a break in the line of States with which were in special relations. On the other hand, we were sincerely desirous of a settlement of the frontier question, and the new proposals I had brought took the fullest possible account of the desiderata which the Saudi Government had put forward. I stressed the fact that the new proposals were not merely an advance on the offers which His Majesty’s Government had previously made, but were based on a new method of approach to the question, that of readiness to meet Saudi views handsomely when we could do so, e.g., in regard to the country of the Murra tribe, the dira of which proved, in fact, to be much more extensive than we had supposed; but we must at the same time safeguard other essential interests. I pointed out that, in applying this new method, we had gone so far that further concessions could not be expected. I also said that they were subject to the assent of the Sultan of Muscat, whom we had wished to consult, but who was out of reach,, when the matter had got to this stage. 3. Fuad Bey preserved the role of an attentive listener. He did not demur to my proposal to give general explanations to the King in person, but was clearly anxious to have our proposals as soon as possible. I thought it politic to promise to let him have on the 25th November a note of our proposals and to show him a map to illustrate their effect. 4. Fuad Bey called on the 25th November shortly before the time fixed for my audience with the King to present the insignia of the G.C.B. We had a short general conversation, which I need not record in detail. Its only interest lay in the fact that Fuad Bey got on to the old familiar theme that His Majesty’s Government never considered Ibn Saud sufficiently, and had always returned evasive answers to his professions of friendship and a desire for close collabora tion with them. He spoke of the King’s grievances. I riposted, as usual, by saying how greatly His Majesty’s Government valued the King’s friendship, but insisting that we had always believed the best way to consolidate mutual friend ship was to clear up outstanding questions. (I will revert to this part of the conversation when recording separately my conversations regarding the Koweit blockade.) Before we parted, I gave Fuad Bey my note of His Majesty’s Govern ment’s new proposals regarding the eastern and south-eastern frontiers and lent him a copy of the latest edition of Hunter’s 1 in. = 32 miles Map of Arabia..4 , i • anrl that which the Saudi Government had asked showing the line now pi p be drawn i n f r0 m the indications in the for on the 3rd April, sofa absence of all the geographical information Saudi memorandum of that date in ai^ ^ .

I thought it politic to say nothin?at this stage about his second point As I had been with him by this time for about an hour and a half and it was time for the midday prayer, I took leave 12. On the evening of the same day, when sitting with the Kin^' before dinner I mentioned feir L. Felly's journey, in connexion with the route followed that SnT ttlZ ^ n ThiS led the Kin - lnto a l )osltlve statement ^id had r ® aclled a definite agreement with his grandfather. He said that the document had been in the possession of the family in Riyadh but had disappeared. Fuad Ley joining in the conversation, I assured them most definitely that there was no trace m any British archives of any agreement other than the I bn Mana letter, which had been published. One fact I said was quite certain namely, that Sir L. Felly, unlike myself, had come to Riyadh without * astuictl0lls - The King said that the Felly mission and the despatch of ibn Mana were entirely independent. He put the date of Felly's visit some four years before the death of his grandfather, the Amir Feisal. (The King is c ear y wrong m his dates as well as in his facts, but there can be no doubt that he sincerely believes that Sir L. Felly did conclude an agreement on the occasion of Ms stay in Riyadh.) 13 . Wh en Fuad Bey again called next morning, the 26th November, I reterred to the conversation of the previous evening about Sir L. Felly’s visit. 1 ottered to give him a note of the transactions at that time, being anxious, I explained, to dissipate any idea that His Majesty’s Government were holding back some agreement entered into by Felly, because it was favourable to the Saudi overnment. Fuad Bey brushed aside this offer, and I did not encourage him m a suggestion of his own that it might be possible to give him copies of the actual correspondence. We then resumed the discussion of the frontier question, with Gaptam de Gaury in attendance. It would be difficult and useless ta reproduce the whole of what passed, but the following paragraphs represent adequately the main course of the conversation. 14 Fuad Bey said he had come to inform me of the King’s reaction to our proposal. He suggested that, although it was based, as I had explained, on new principles, their application was very limited. As regards the Jebel Nakhsh area, fie referred to past correspondence between the Sheikh of Qatar and the King, through Ibn Jiluwi, in which the sheikh had asked, more as a favour than as a V- should not claim Jebel Dukhan and the tract known as Araiq. r 6 m dad a S reed ’ an&lt; T thM being so, the King would now be prepared to abandon any claim to Araiq, although he, Fuad, had claimed it in earlier discussions. (This apparently refers to the “ Ariq ” mentioned in the Saudi memorandum of the 3rd April.) On the other hand, he pressed insistently the Saudi claim to Jebel Nakhsh, and urged that a frontier between the two Jebels would be a rational one based on physical features. As regards the Khor-aF Odeid, he began by saying that my arguments were sound, but presently he went back on the implications of this statement by reaffirming the claim to the Khor, though not, I think, as confidently as that to the Jebel Nakhsh. He tried to make out that our desire to maintain the continuity of the chain of States on the Gulf, however much it might rest on a historical basis, need not now prevent us from letting Ibn Saud have the Khor, which Fuad Bey described as economically necessary to Saudi Arabia, and which at one moment in the subsequent conversa tion he even described as the “ port of the Murra.” We had feared, he suo-gested, the intervention of extra-Arabian Powers. We need not fear Saudi Arabia. 15. Fuad Bey’s invocation of an agreement between the Sheikh of Qatar and the King gave me an opportunity of asserting our attitude in regard to direct relations between the rulers in special relations with us and Ibn Saud I reminded him of my statement of the previous day, that we were responsible for their foreign affairs and had responsibilities towards them. The question of our responsibilities to the Sheikh of Qatar had recently come into prominence owing [581 gg—3] B 3to the orant of the oil concession (which Fuad Bey had mentioned). We had promised the Sheikh protection, and we must be in a position to carry out that promise in any and every contingency, however little we might fear having to do so I suggested that this was a very real reason for objecting to direct correspondence between the Sheikh and Ibn Sand on important matters If we promised protection we must have the means of protection, and we must be the nidges of what was necessary to provide us with the means. I adverted to the, letter which Ibn Sand had addressed to the Sheikh of Qatar some months ago regarding the oil concession and to the subsequent correspondence to which it hS given rise. That letter, I said, was in the nature of an ultimatum, backed by a threat, and we had protested as politely as possible. 1 he Saudi Government had taken exception to our protest, and Sheikh lusuf Yasm had relied on the wording of article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda as defeating it. That article did not however, stand alone. It had been led up to and it had been followed by the communication to Ihn Sand of our treaties with the rulers mentioned in it. a communication made by agreement, in order that he might have knowledge of the nature of the special relations of which he had taken cognisance m article 6. 16. Fuad Bey said that the communication to which I referred did not include our treaty with Qatar. I questioned this, and said that it had certainly been intended to include it. It was a published document, and if he had not got it, I could let him have it at any time. Fuad Bey admitted that the question whether it had, in fact, been communicated was of no essential importance but asked what the position would be if the direct agreement between the Sheikh of Qatar and Ibn Saud, which he had invoked, were antecedent to the Anglo-Qatar Treaty I said I thought it would make no difference, as, although that treaty had not been concluded until 1916, Qatar had long formed part of the system of States in special relations with His Majesty’s Government. I reminded mm, speaking from memory, that, in the note communicating the agreements with the rulers named in article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, we had expressly said that our position did not rest only on treaty texts, but on a whole series of past transactions. I also reminded him, again speaking from memory only, that Qatar was so much a concern of ours before the Anglo-Qatar Treaty of 1916 that it had, I thought, been the subject of a special chapter in one of the pre-war Anglo-Turkish conventions. The Anglo-Qatar Treaty of 1916 had merely reduced to written form pre-existing arrangements. Fuad Bey suggested that before the treaty of 1916 was concluded the Sheikh of Qatar was free to negotiate direct with Ibn Saud. Later in the discussion I asked whether the direct agree ment about the Jebel Dukhan and the Araiq was, in fact, antecedent to the Anglo-Qatar Treaty. Fuad Bey said it was. ^ 17. I refused to entertain Fuad Bey’s claim to the Khor-al-Odeid. 1 maintained that, even if it were a means of maritime access to the neighbouring part of Saudi Arabia, no territorial claim could be founded on this any more than Ibn Saud could claim Koweit because it was, or ought to be, a port feeding the Saudi area inland. If the Saudi Government wanted an arrangement about trade through the Khor that was another matter. Fuad Bey enlarged the issue at this stage by saying that, if we reached an agreement about the frontier, it would be necessary to have some sort of frontier arrangements for administrative and suchlike purposes. He quoted the parallel of the arrangements in the treaties with Iraq and Transjordan. 18. I otttlined the procedure which His Majesty’s Government had in view. My present object, I said, was to seek an agreement in principle regarding the frontier line. If this were arrived at, it would be necessary to embody it m treaty, to which His Majesty’s Government would be parties, for themselves ana the Sheikhs of Qatar and Abu Dhabi, and to which the Sultan of Muscat and Oman would also be a party. His Majesty’s Government had in view one matter, which came within the scope of what Fuad Bey had just said, but which I had not yet mentioned. I read paragraph 18 of Foreign Office despatch No. 309 ot the 23rd October regarding the freedom of tribes to use their normal wells and grazing grounds on whichever side of the frontier they might be situated. Fuad Bey contemplated more general frontier arrangements. I doubted whether the conditions on the frontier now in question were similar to those on the Iraq and Transjordan frontiers, but, subject to the fact that I had no instructions othei than those I had read, I agreed that arrangements appropriate to the loca conditions might well be embodied in an eventual treaty.19. I find that in the foregoing record of the earlier part of the discussion, I have omitted three points of some little importance as follows :— (a) At one moment Fuad Bey gave a definite hint that a bargain might be struck. (b) I reinforced my arguments regarding the special position of our Persian Gulf clients by saying that Ibn Sand was the most powerful ruler in Arabia, and that those other States had only such strength as they derived from their special relations with His Majesty’s Government. Had it been otherwise, I said, Ibn Baud would have before now absorbed Koweit and Qatar. Fuad smilingly asked whether this would harm our interests. I replied emphatically that it would. (c) Fuad Bey threw a question at me about oil possibilities in the Jebel Nakhsh. I told him that I thought there might be oil there, but that we had also reason to believe that there might be oil in the area south west of the Dohat-as-Salwa, and that we had not allowed the discovery of this possibility to deter us from making the Green Line offer at an earlier stage in the discussions. Fuad Bey tried to make out later that in claiming the Jebel Nakhsh so insistently, the Saudi Government were influenced only by considerations connected with the protection of Salwa in the event of raiding, &amp;c. 20. The second part of the conversation related to the south-eastern portion of the proposed frontier. Before we had got far, Fuad Bey raised the point that the Saudi Government must respect the position of the King of the Yemen. They were themselves ready to waive any claim to tribes in the Hadhramaut hinterland, but they could not prejudice any claim which the Imam might have. I adverted to the fact that the Saudi-Yemen Treaty of 1934 did not deal with the Saudi-Yemen frontier east of Najran. I understood that that was because the Imam had refused to let it be defined lest his pretensions in the Hadhramaut should be prejudiced. After some little general discussion on this subject, I said that it would be hopeless to bring the King of the Yemen into the negotiation of a treaty regarding the frontiers now under discussion, but that the Saudi Government might possibly overcome their difficulty by attaching some sort of declaration to the effect that they did not wish to prejudice Yemen interests. I qualified this by adding that, if such a declaration were made, it should not mention the Hadhramaut as such. We should hold on to the Hadhramaut until all was blue. I added an intimation, speaking quite personally, that His Majesty’s Government on their side might have some scruples about possible Yemeni interests in the area between the Violet Line and Najran. Fuad Bey said that no difficulty could arise here, because, while the Saudi A emen boundary east of Najran had not been defined, the Saudi and Yemeni Governments had an under standing based on the attribution of tribes in the area. 21. Fuad Bey intimated that our proposed line G-H—Violet Line was unacceptable. He put a general question as to whether I could offer any improve ment on our proposals as a whole. I said that I was not authorised to offer any further concessions in regard to the line south of Qatar, on which my instructions were quite categorical; or indeed in regard to any part of our proposals. I said guardedly, however, that as regards one portion, viz, the line J-G, I deduced from the correspondence, though not from the text of my instructions, that His Majesty’s Government might be prepared to put the frontier in that part rather further to the east, if it would lead to an agreement, but that in this case it would be more than ever necessary to consult the interests of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. I made it clear that I was speaking only oLthe a rea bet ween points J and G 'and had no sort of authority to go further than our proposal regarding G-H—Violet Line. 22. Fuad Bey suggested that there would be no difficulty with the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. Tie would agree to any frontier, because of the trouble he had in his hinterland with two important personages, A1 Khurusi and A1 Khalili. Fuad Bey caught on to what I had said generally about a possible modification of the line J-G. He suggested that, if that line could be transferred to meridian 56° E, it might be possible to devise a line further on inter mediate between our proposed line G-H—Violet Line and that proposed in the Saudi memorandum of the 3rd April. He thought it would be preferable if this8 intermediate line could be defined with reference to places rather than to co-ordinates. He was extremely non-committal and explained that he was only throwing out an “ idea ” of his own. Subject to this, he indicated a possible line from say the intersection of meridian 56° E. and parallel 20 is. to run midway through the Ramlat-al-Mughsin and thence to points approximately at the inter sections of^meridian 52° E. and parallel 18° N. and of meridian 50 E. and paia^ a rev i ew 0 f the whole discussion, Fuad Bey and I had to agree that we had not found the basis of an agreement in principle. I sard that all I could do was to renew to him and to the King the appeal I had made on the previous day. Fuad Bey said that he had had to overcome great difficulties m his own high quarters in connexion with his own proposals I explained that very great difficulties had had to be overcome on the side of His Majesty s Government Their proposal represented an honest effort to reconcile all the interests involved and I must again commend it earnestly to the acceptance of I bn Sand. 24 My further conversation with Fuad Bey on the 26th ^November related to the Koweit blockade, but later that afternoon the King again received me and the audience was devoted entirely to the frontier question Bey anal Captain de Gaury were present. Only the general lines of what passed can be recorded as the King merely skirmished round the outskirts of a position on which he had clearly made up his mind not to give ground at present. He spoke at times with great vivacity, but with none of that bitterness which characterised his utterances to me at Taif last year. 1 ^ . . , 25. I referred to my conversation with Fuad Bey m the morning and expressed regret that the King had found it impossible to accept a proposal which His Majesty’s Government had put forward after an honest endeavour to reconcile all the interests which they had to consider. My only remaining duty, 1 said, was to renew my appeal that he should entertain it favourably. If this a PP® ai failed I must return to Jedda and report to His Majesty s Government. What mattered was not that I was returning without having reached an agreement ot principle, but that His Majesty’s Government would have great difficulty m going further than they had done. 26. The King echoed my regret that a settlement had not pro\ed possible. He proffered the usual assurances that, whether this question were settled or no his friendship with Great Britain was unaltered and unalterable. He referred to the many sacrifices he had made in the past, and had made only for the sake of that friendship. He suggested that it mattered little if officials took a couple of years to settle questions. I find it difficult to recall all that His Majesty said in this connexion, but Captain de Gaury's recollection is that he intimated that any differences were a matter for arrangement to be arrived at by modifications of view on both sides on an equitable basis. If I was not in a position to modil} my proposals, that was my affair, and any delay in the negotiations could not be attributed to unwillingness on his part to reach a settlement. In the course oi his remarks, he referred to the advantages of a method of question and answer but he appeared to intend to leave the application of this to Fuad Bey and Jj imsel threw out only one question, of a somewhat rhetorical nature, as to what tne fundamental causes of difference were. He made play also with the fact tna in the treaty made with him in 1915 His Majesty's Government had underta en to recognise his ancestral claims. At one moment he suggested lightly a, after all, the whole area in dispute was desert and that His Majesty s Govern ment could easily give him a bit more. . 27. After the King had expounded his views on these lines for some time&gt; I observed that, if I remembered rightly, the treaty of 1915 referred to i ancestral claims in named areas. I should be prepared to answer any ques ion and would now answer the only one he had put so far. The fundament difficulty was that, though he was the greatest ruler in Arabia, he was not ^ only one who had ancestral claims. His position was simple, as he had on to assert his own claims. That of His Majesty's Government vvas aiuicu a they were in special relations with some of the rulers and in friendly re atl ? ,. as between independent States, with Saudi Arabia. They had to accommo a conflicting claims and they had done their best to do so reasonably, yhev not exaggerate the ancestral claims of their clients, e.q., they did not c ^ aim f7L r for Bahrein, merely because it was shown in old maps as belonging to the la principality.vi 9 f ! Ill v m ^ hi )1T. atioiis^' re, as 1 wii®'' nesi 28 This evoked a lively sally from the King who denied that Hasa had ■ever belonged to Bahrein though Bahrein might have belonged to Hasa. I replied that I was dealing only m examples. 29. The King asseverated that he and his brothers in religion, i.e., the coastal ruleis had not wanted frontiers between them. He emphasised his friendship with them all and especially the Sheikh of Qatar, who would not be where he was had not he, Ibn Saud, helped him against his relatives. „ 30 - 1 said that modern conditions had made frontiers necessary. New factors had arisen. How, for instance, had the present discussion started? The King had given an oil concession in Hasa. (The King interposed that it was not he who had given it, but an English company, by letting the concession go to the Americans. He was poor, he said, and must live somehow.) The United btates Government had then enquired what we considered to be the limits of baudi Arabia. We had given the only reply we could, and had informed the Saudi Government of what had passed. I added that I did not wish to be misunderstood. Oil was not the only factor. Other factors had made frontiers necessary, e.g., with Iraq and Transjordan. The point was that in modern ►conditions frontiers must be drawn, if causes of quarrel were to be avoided. 31. The King recognised the necessity for frontiers. He made some obscure reference m this connexion to the circumstances of the Great War. . 32 - the Kmg’s statements were interspersed with assurances of friend ship. Towards the end he became almost fatherly and begged me not to worry overmuch as all would come right in time. I said that the King was in his own country and I hoped he would live for many years. I was a stranger and should be lea\ ing next year. I should have liked to see this question settled before I went, not to gratify my vanity, but because I should not wish to leave behind me -a possible cause of future strife. This sob-stuff elicited further amiabilities from the King, but otherwise left him unmoved. 33. When Fuad called on the morning of the 27th to discuss other business, I arranged to leave with him the map mentioned in paragraph 4 above, after having a copy made of the lines drawn in it. I also asked him for further information about the Araiq area (see paragraph 16 above). I attach a note made by Captain de Gaury from the explanations given by Fuad Bey. 34. On the 28th November Fuad Bey engaged me in a long private conver sation. Before passing to its principal subject, that of the relations of Saudi Arabia with Great Britain and Italy, he begged me to make a further effort to promote a settlement of the frontier question on a basis of compromise. He said, quite personally and non-committally, that if we could give way over the Jebel Nakhsh, he “ thought he could induce the King ” to give way over the Khor-al- Odeid. 35. Most of this record was written as the conversations proceeded in Riyadh, but I have corrected it somewhat and completed it in Jedda. ANDREW RYAN. Jedda, December 7, 1935. Enclosure 3. Description of the Araiq Area given by Fuad Bey Hamza. Araiq, literally ' c The small veins,' ’ i.e., of Sand. EAST of and within sight of Qasr Salwa are the water holes (Hissu) of Mishabiya. Between Qasr Salwa and Mishabiya is the palm grove of Umm-as-Samra, and this is surrounded by salty low-lying ground (Sabkha), usually called Sabkhat-as-Salwa. Further east again is a sandy plain dotted with bushes called the Araiq. Its northern end reaches to near Jebel Nakhsh, and its southern end terminates in the Salama dunes south-east of Sikak. In the Araiq are many water holes, notably— (1) Abu Ghath. (2) Sai (i.e., in the courier road). (3) Ud Abu Samra (the largest group). (4) Jabanin.No:S84-S dated the 15th December 1955 about the Sa’udi claim to Jabal Naksh in Qatar. 2. I venture to agree with the views expressed in the second and third paragraphs of your letter. It might be worth asking Shaikh ’Abdullah about the alleged correspondence on your forthcoming tour. &gt; however, the matter is pressed, a point of some importance is that on the map (sent with your Printed Letter No:63-S dated the 26th January 1934) Jabal ^aksh is shown inside the limit of the concession granted by the Shaikh to to Anglo- Iranian Oil Company. This at least shows that the ^haikh either has never acknowledged Jabal Naksh to pertain to Sa’udi Arabia or does not consider himself bound by anything that may have passed between him and Bin Sa’ud on the subject. 4. I should feel inclined not to press too hardly ( if at all) the possibility of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company going back on the concession, for it is possible that in certain circumstances the Shaikh might think this to his advantage. I would rather impress upon him that, if Bin Sa’ud gets Jabal Naksh, he may give it to an American Oil Company who may, from this point, drain away the oil from under Qatar territory and so spoil his oil zone or render it of much less value. /5. Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel T.C.Fowle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. r '■ I5. In connection with the last portion of the fourth paragraph of telegram No:S43 dated the 8 th December 1935 from the Minister, Jedda, I do not think that there is anything in the point that Jabal Naksh is necessary for the defence of Saiwa - it is just as necessary or more so to the defence of Qatar: moreover, the obvious boundary, so far as natural features are concerned, is the stony ibar' of Qatar, which includes Jabal Naksh, and the sandy type of country to the south. From the air the division is comparatively well marked.9/55 &amp; 61/31 //3 A M U Telegram R # zi From Political Agent, Bahrain. ■ 1 - 0 Political Resident, Buahire# No, 4 Dated 8 th received 9th January 1936, I have heard from several sources rumour that Shaikh of tar intends to go to Hasa to meet Tbn Saud who reached there on 5th January# - POLITICAL -61/31 Telegram XX 5*rom Political Resident, Rushire.

The Shaikh had a standing camp at haqrun, some 90 miles &amp;v ay, and was himself supposed to be a couple of days beyond a point to which motors could go easily, about 30 miles beyond Maqrun I decided that I had better go go out with the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company^ agent in his car to the standing camp to get information myself and proceeded there by car* The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company^ agent kindly sent lunch to the landing ground and gave me lunch on my return from Maqrun. 4* At Maqrun I found the °haikh f s cars which had been ordered out two days before with instructions to wait at Maqrun till a messenger came to say that they were to go on the further ?0 miles to fetch him* was expected back on the 19th or 90th of the Arabic month, i*e*, January 14th or 15th, but they said » that he might come Tt tocay or tomorrow or after 3 or 4 days” according to the sport* % letter had been sent on about midday by a messenger left by the Shaikh to bring anything from Govern* ment who knew the Shaikh’s usual hunting places* From their talk and that of others It appeared that there was no idea of his going to Hasa, and it seems probable arose from that the story/e# his going to hawk just when din 5ahid was coming to Hasa* The Anglo-Iranian ^il Company*s agent had himself asked on the way out whether ^in Sa f ud was now at hasa and said that people had talked of the possibility of Shaikh f Abdullah’s going, but that it was just talk.2 • ^ ri circumstances as there seemed little chance { ' * of finding the Shaikh without undue waste of time, even if transport could have been got, end as the fear of his going to Has a was entirely ruled out (unless he made a sudden journey there on getting my letter, which seemed most improbable and in any case could not have been stopped), I decided to leave a note at Maqrun telling him that I had come out but that as his date of return was not known and as the Honourable the Political Resident was arriving at Herein the next nay, I was returning by the aeroplanes* I asked him to send word by launch, when he vvould get back, and said that I would come over again then, 8* After a late lunch, I returned by aeroplane to Bahrain without incident* 7* I asked Flight-Lieuten nt Macdonald kindly to defer his departure on the 15th January till I could telephone to him after seeing the Honourable the Political Resident who was to land at 08*00 hours on that day.

To:- ni ( ''j • ' r ~ ,&lt;i Djto. rzz: The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian ^ulf, Bushire Bin Sa f ud*s claim to Jabal Naksh in Qatar. Sir, jr I have the honour t^/refer to the Secretary of State for India’s telegram No:147^lated the 10th January 1956 in which it was stated that His Majesty’s Government agreed that I should proceed to Qatar and communicate a warning against committing himself in connection with his frontier to Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Qasim al Than! in case he were to proceed to Hasa to see Bin Sa’ud, 2. As explained in ny note dated the January 1956 I flew to Doha on the 15th January and proceeded thence to Shaikh ’Abdullah’s standing camp at Maqrun, some 20 miles south-east of Doha. I did not see Shaikh ’Abdullah as he was away hawking, but I satisfied nyself that he was coming back to Doha in the course of the next few days, though his men said that they coulc not tell whether he wjou3-d come back the next day or during the next three or four days as his novements depended on the hawking. I decided, therefore, to return to Bahrain the same day to meet you and left a message for Shaikh ’Abdullah asking him to let me know directly he got back.3. I flev; to Doha again on the 'P.Oth January 1936 and found that Shaikh 1 Abdullah had kindly come to Doha in order to save me the journey out to Maqrun. I lunched with him and afterwards had a talk with him and his sons. Shaikh *Ali and Shaikh Hamad. 4. After suitable opening conversation, I explained that I had come to see him by the order of Government in connection with the question of his boundary, saying that modern conditions, and especially since the discovery of oil, it had become necessary to fix boundaries between Arab States in a way which had been unneeded in the old days when merely tribal grazing yras at stake: that and/in this connection His Majesty T s Government had, as he knew, been discussing with Bin Sa f ud the question of the boundary betw r een Sa’udi Arabia and Qatar. I showed him the boundary line described November 1935 handed to Fuad Bey Hamza at Riyadh and explained that His Majesty»s Government had been careful to safeguard the ^barr' (country) of Qatar as claimed by him. I said that formerly the Sa»udi Arab Government had claimed the district known as A1 l Araiq, but that they w r ere now disposed to abandon the claim to A1 ’Araiq, although it had been claimed in earlier discussions (see paragraph No:14 of Sir Andrew Ryan’s report dated the 7th December 1935 on his conversations at Riyadh). I informed him that the Sa’udi Arab Government, however, insistently claimed Jabal Naksh and they stated that there had been correspondence between him and the late Bin Jiluwi in which he (Shaikh ’Abdullah) had recognised Bin Sa’ud’s right to Jabal Naksh. I reminded him of ny coming to Qatar in 1916 when our Treaty vms signed and explained that the alleged correspondence had taken place before that time. Shaikh ’Abdullah emphatically denied that any such correspondence had taken place. I pressed him considerably on the subject and begged in the first paragraph of Sir Andrew /him* him to think well before replying, emphasising the importance of our knowing anything which might have passed in view of the difficulties which would arise If such correspondence was denied and was then produced by the Sa f udi Arab Government. Shaikh ’Abdullah again warmly denied that there had been any such correspondence and went so far as to say that if anything was produced it would be a forgery. into which it might be possible to read the meaning now claimed by the Sa’udi Arab Government. He thought this over, but replied that he was almost sure that there was nothing of the kind, except that possibly (though he could not be certain) Bin Sa ! ud or Bin Jiluwi might at some time have written to him asking for permission to collect zakat from individuals of his (Bin Sa’ud’s) tribes wiio might occasionally have been grazing in the vicinity of Jabal Dukhan. He emphasised, however, that in such a case the request would only be for permission to enter an area known to be within the bounds of Qatar. 5. Shaikh ’Abdullah then explained that the district known as Al ’Araiq was to the south of Jabal Dukhan and Jabal Naksh and between them and Salwa and said that as Al ’Araiq and Jabal Dukhan were admittedly his, it would be absurd to claim that Jabal Naksh, situated between them, was not his. ...» .. ..... . . Jr. - ■■ .'-v^ I-a-' -i...' rii '' that Jabal Naksh was part of Jabal Dukhan, ’’as the nose is part of the face”, and was for that reason called by the beaouin ”naksh” or ”nose”. The dictionary meaning is B the lower part of I then asked, him whether he had had any correspondence anything”. He further said that he only refrained from claiming /Salwa4. Salwa as he recognised that it had passetj from him by reason of Bin Sard’s superior force* 6 . Shaikh *Abdullah told me that about eighteen months before Bin Sa f ud had sent him a verbal message with a man named Muhammad bin Nasir (£ee the third paragraph of ny Express E e tter No:C/979-1 *a/38/f[ated the 15th December 1334) about the boundary of Qatar. He had then replied that his boundary extended to and included A1 Mashabiyah which was a few miles from Qasr Salwa and that Muhammad bin Nasir had made a note of this in his own hand writing and had taken it to Bin Sa'ud. Later Bin Sa f ud had sent him a long telegram through the Amir of Hasa in which he confirmed what the Shaikh had said to llihamrad bin Ha sir. In a letter the late Bin Jiluwi had admitted Jabal Dukhan and A1 f Araici as belong ing to Qatar but had requested Shaikh Abdullah to allow A1 Mashabiyah to pertain to Sa^udi Arabia. Shaikh Abdullah says that he replied to Bin Jiluwi that he could not allow A1 Mashabiyah to pass to them as it formed part of Qatar. Shaikh T Abdullah drew me a rough sketch (somewhat like the attached) which placed A1 | Araic i (which stretched from the Dohat Salwa) to the south and west of Jabal Naksh and liSashabiyah south and west again of A1 1 Araio and between A1 ! Araip and Salwa.. 7. I warned Shaikh tAbdullah of the danger to his oil should another oil company establish themselves on the ridge of Jabal Dukhan, and I found that he fully appreciated the danger, and I do not think that he will now do anything (knowingly at any rate) which may v/eaken his position. 8 . I have described ny conversation at some length in view of its local importance, but the essential point is that. Snaikh 1 Abdullah most positively claims that Jabal Naksh pertains to v '‘ /Qat arO&amp;tcir ana eoually positively denies 11181 the Sa *ndi Arab Govern— men! have any letter from him admitting Jabal Naksh to belong to Bin Sa T ud. G. Ain conclusion, I would request that, if there is no objection, ny thanks may be communicated to the Royal Air Force for so kinciy co-operating in transporting me to Qatar at short notice on these two occasions and especially to Flight-Lieutenant G.P.Macdonald who took me on both flights/&gt;(l am the more grateful as I believe that the political situation in the Mediterranean has rendered the units remaining in T Iraq shorthanded and heavily worked.

(No. 292.) HIS Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Jedda presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State, and has the honour to transmit to him copy of a letter from Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, dated the 15th October, respecting the Qatar Oil Concession. Jedda, October 16, 1935. Enclosure. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to Mr. Calvert. My dear Mr. Calvert, Mecca, Rajab 17, 1354 (October 15, 1935). I HAVE received your letter dated the 26th September, 1935 (the 28th Jumad ath-Thani, 1354), and in reply I have the honour to state the following :— 2. It was strange to our Government that the British Government disapproved of the correspondence which has taken and is taking place direct between His Majesty the King and the Sheikh of Qatar, in respect of a matter concerning the affairs of Qatar, and that you relied on your disapproval upon article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, and stated that “ His Majesty King Abdul Aziz undertook, among other things, to maintain friendly relations with his Excellency the Sheikh of Qatar, between whom and His Britannic Majesty’s Govern- uient . . . &amp;c., and whereas your statement and the interpretation of article 6 differ in text, meaning and significance from the contents of article 6, I therefore write to you herein the copy of article 6 literally, and which begins : “ His Majesty the King of the Hejaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies undertakes to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the territories of Koweit and Bahrein and with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast, who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty’s Government.' The undertaking of His Majesty the King of the Hejaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies is confined to friendly and peaceful relations with the Amirs of those territories (literally : directions), and it does not contain any reference to any undertaking by His Majesty that he should not correspond with them or that they should not correspond with him, and therefore nothing has been changed since the Treaty of Jedda in the relations which had existed between His Majesty and those Amirs, but friendly and peaceful relations remained complete and perfect, and correspondence is exchanged between His Majesty and them in respect of various affairs, because this assures the friendly and peaceful relations which His Majesty undertook to maintain. The treaties referred to in article 6, concluded between the British Government and those Amirs, are the concern of the Amirs, and they (His Majesty’s Government) may bind them with them, but they (His Majesty’s Government) cannot bind our Government with them. 3. As regards your reference to (the fact) that the British Government, in accordance with their (willingness) to deprive themselves of their strict legal ri .ghts, and offer a part of those rights to the Saudi Arab Government, &amp;c. (literally : to the end of your statement on the subject), I am glad to draw your attention in this respect to the true facts that our Government always desire that Jheir relations with the Amirs of those territories (literally : directions) should be lasting relations of affection and friendship, and do not desire to restrict (literally : press upon) them and their affairs, and they (Saudi Arab Govern- m ent) showed their readiness to grant them areas (territories) to the utmost extent [556 q—1]2 which can be granted, on the understanding that the whole of those domains were previous! subject to the fathers and forefathers of His Majesty the King Abdul Aziz. As regards the legal rights to which you refer and to which the British Government pretend, our Government cannot recognise and accept them and cannot consider them as basis for any discussion m connexion with those frontiers In respect of the above, our Government therefore preserve their fullest rights in the territories and places which they cannot agree to renounce in favour of the Amirs of those territories, and our Government cannot recognise or atree to any privileges or rights which may be granted at those reserved places, and record their reservation in their regard. , . 4 This is on the one hand, and on the other I am pleased to inform you that our Government are fully prepared at any tune to discuss the settlement o the Question of the frontiers in a spirit of affection and friendship to those neighbouring Amirs whenever discussion may be resumed on this subject.

Following is for your confidential information. if Shaikh of ^tar had before 1916 concluded a treaty engagement with Ibn Saud by v/hich he had recognized the latter*s sovereignty over any specific area such as JEBEL HAKSH, the arrangement e f f ec t would have ifcaken/at once and would therefore not necessarily have been invalidated by 1916 treaty between His Majesty’s Government and Qatar althou^i the effect on any such engagement of the Anglo-Turki sh Convention of 1913 and 1914 definiing the Blue line is another matter ?/hich would require separate eon- -sideration.

Secretary of State for foreign AffairsHo.107/380/8 v BRITISH LEGATION, V SAUD I ARABIA. )• You will remember that when I was discussing the eastern and south-eastern frontier question with Fuad Hamza at Riyadh, he suggested that the Sultan of Muscat and O m an would agree to any frontier we might propose between his territories and Saudi Arabia, because he had. so much trouble with two personages in the interior viz. A1 Khalili and A1 Kharusi. The iimolication was —■■tn n t - i i that it would pay the Sultan to have a definite front ier, within which his authority would be internationally recognised. I . I have long thought that the presence in the hinterland of Muscat towards Saudi Arabia of quasi- independent authorities might become important, if they were people with whom Ibn Saud could hope for some understanding, a possibility which would depend on various factors, including their religious outlook. I /have -Col.T.C. W.Fowle, C.B.E. , Bushiref r v v ^&lt;r^- I have never, however, been able to get a clear idea of who and what they are, although one sees occasion al references, e.g, in Muscat Intelligence Report ■ ■ 0.16 of 1934, to an Imam, whose authority seems to be greater than that of the Sultan of Muscat, Iiie old Handbook of Arabia Volume I pp, 247-248 gives some account of an Ibadhi religious teacher named ^kdullah Ibn Hum aicl As-Salimi , an Ibadhi relig ious teacher and his son-in-lav/ Salim Ibn Rashid Al- Kh^ii£i ? whom the former had sent up as Imam of Tanuf. /r On the other hand de Gaury gave me last May the name of the Imam in the Oman hinterland as Muhammad Ibn Abdullah al Khalili. He had got this name not —, —rmiinnmiiiii——'—t—Tir long oeiore from that Libyan Odysseus, Suleyman Al— Baruni, who had I understand been for a time in the service of the said Imam. My impression is that Ibn Saud knows very little about these gentlemen but that he knows a bit more than he did two or three years ago, when Fuad asked me, I think .in genuine ignorance, whether there was not some other ruler in the hinterland of Muscat. You probably /have1 have a good deal more information. i be grateful for anything you could tell me as to ( a ) who ^ i:&gt;e0ple aPe (b) the range of their present author ity and (c) the likelihood of their having or developing any connexion with Ihn Saud. H e might like nohbl,. them, ii their remoteness and religious tenets did not make it impossible, in the same way that ne noobled the people in IT a j ran. I am sending copies of this to the Eastern Department of the Foreign Office and privately to Gaury, who is interested in the matter and was one the sources of my present meagre information. r.G. After drafting this letter I discovered that the enquiry by Fuad, mentioned in the first sentence of para graph 5, is much more recent than I thought. it took place | on Feoruary 7th last and is mentioned in the record of my „ conversation with him on that date which I sent to the J' i0reign 0mce and B ushire , among others, on February 9th 1935. A. R.'A/77/91). Dear Walton, You will have received under cover of our official h’i^^ letter N ° ,E 7574 A?/91 of 17th January copies in print of oir Andrew Ryan s despatch No. 351 of the 10th Decemher last covering a note on his discussions at Riyadh with Ibn Gaud and Puad Bey Hamza on, among other matters, the question or the south and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. 2. In this letter, which I am writing in Renders absence on leave, I propose to deal only with certain points raised in Ryan's despatch, viz:- (a) Puad Hamza’s argument (see paragraph 5 of the despatch) that !, as the Anglo-Qatar Treaty was not concluded ’’until 1916, His Majesty’s Government must respect an ’’alleged earlier agreement by which the Sheikh of Qatar ’’recognised Ibn Saud’s right to the Jebal Naksh” and (b) the allegation (see paragraph 12 of the note by Ryan) by Ibn Saud 11 that Sir L.Felly had reached a definite ’’agreement with his grandfather”. 3. As regards (a) above I think it would be as well if you would consult the Political Authorities in the Persian Gulf and endeavour to ascertain whether any light can be thrown on the alleged correspondence between the Sheikh of Qatar and the late Ibn Jilawi to which Ryan refers in his telegram No.215 of the 8 th December last, a copy of which was sent to you under our E 7149/77/91, and furnish us with such material as may be available to refute Puad Hamza’s ; assertions on this pdnt yaiton Esq., C.B. , M.C., lt4 la Office, S. . . sfflI 4. As regard^fb ) it appears quite clear from paragraph llo^t seq. of India Office memorandum P^Z.5620/ 1934, B 437, that there was no such agreement, and, subject to your observations, we would propose to instruct Ryan to reply categorically to Fuad Hamza to that effect* 5. With regard to the insistence of the Saudis on the inclusion ol the Jehel Naksh within the Saudi 'boundaries, I don’t think there can 'be much doubt that oil is at the bottom ol their anxiety and that considerations connected with the protection ol Salwa do not really weigh very heavily with them.

In paragraphs 26 and 27, Ryan shows that the King attempted to invoke the 1915 Treaty with His Majesty’s Government and their recognition of his ancestral claims, but it is quite clear - as Ryan pointed out to him - that these ancestral claims referred only to Nejd, Hasa, Qatif and Jubail and the towns and ports belonging to them, and by no stretch of imagination can these be held to extend to any part of Qatar. 7* The outcome of these discussions between Ryan and the Saudi Government will of course necessitate another meeting of the Middle East (0) Sub-Committee, but I should prefer to await the result of your enquiries under (a) above before suggesting a date for the meeting* I hope however that we may all be ready to hold it some time towards the middle of February.

Sir Andrew r &lt;yan, FBE*,CMC*, His Majesty’s Minister, J edda.Note on leading Personalities in Oman, with reference to Sir Andrew Ryan’s demi-official letter No. 107/380/6 of 17th January 1956 to Colonel Fowle. !• It must first be explained that the Al Khar us i and A1 KUaliii mentioned in paragraph 1 are not personages, but families. 2. There had been from early times an Imam of Muscat and Oman, whose power was spiritual as well as temporal, and who was appointed by election. 3. The removal of the capital from RUSTAQ, in the interior to Muscat about ICO years ago weakened the Sultan’s hold on the cmani tribes. 4. In 1913 the Omani tribes rose in revolt against the Sultan, egged on by the blind Ibadhi mullah Shaikh Abdullah bin Humaid as Salimi , and elected Salim bin Rashid al al Kharusi as their Imam. The Imam appointed his brother * 5 Hasir bin Rashid al Khar us i as his /ali in Rustaq. The revolt continued during the war, assisted by iuricish propaganda and culminated in a serious attack on Muscat in 1915, by a large force of Omanis. This force which advanced within about 6 nilee of the town, was driven back by British troops, which were then stationed at Muscat. 5. In spite of the fact that the Sultan's control over the Omanis was nominal, he made various abortive attempts to establish his rule over the interior. In 1920, under the guidance of the Political Agent, negotiations were opened for stablizing the situation as between the Sultan and /a ^ c TOO) - 2 - and the Omanis, The Imam proving obdurate, the Sultan imposed a penal tax of 25$ on dates coming down from the interior. This caused much discontent in Oman, chiefly directed against the Imam who, still refusing to come to terms with the Sultan, was murdered by his own subjects. The Sultan, Sir Taimur bin Faisal, father of the present Ruler, then managed to secure the election of his father-in-law, Mohamed bin Abdullah al Khalili as Imam* After further negotiations, a treaty was signed in 1920, which left the Imam supreme in the interior of Oman, but stipulated that the Omanis should pay certain dues on their goods entering and leaving the Muscat ports. The treaty is recognised by the Government of India as a most satisfactory solution of the relations between the Sultan and the Omanis, but - an important point - we are not responsible for its enforcement on either party. Since the signature of the treaty there has been peace between the Sultan and the Omanis. 6. The predominant personality in Oman until recently was Shaikh Isa bin Salih al Harithi , who had been, as the leader of the Hinawi confederation, one of the Imamus principal supporters in the rebellion. But his influence is now declining before that of his son Shaikh Mo hammed bin Isa al Harithi . It was, incidentally, Shaikh Isa who signed the 1920 treaty with the Sultan on behalf oi the Imam. 7. The present position as between the Sultan and the Onanis is that though the former still calls himself Sultan of Muscat and Oman, the latter to all intents and purposes are independent. At the same time, if they siiould flagrant ly break the treaty or otherwise show hostility towards him, he has the whip-hand of them as the ports, from which they get their goods, are in his hands. , 8. / iCONFIDENTIAL.

Fuad Bey esked me this morning whether I had any instructions shout this question# I replied in the negative* I told him that I feared, as I had foreshadowed to the King and himself in Riyadh, that His Majesty’s Government were unlikely to he able to improve on the offer I had made there* What then, asked Fuad, was the position ? I said the present position was that Kis Majesty’s Government had made an offer, which they had said was the utmost limit to which they could go, except that my Instructions hinted at a possible further concession east of one portion of the line. There matters stood. Fuad Bey glowered and asked whether that was final. I explained that I had of course reported to His Majesty’s Government the King’s reaction to their offer* There was no absolute finality in such matters and His Majesty’s Government might conceivably modify their views. that I had said was merely a statement of the present position, as known to me. Now that he had reverted to the question, I would willingly report that he was anxious for a further expression of His Majesty’s Government’s views. My detailed report on the Riyadh conversations must have reached London a little over a month ago and I could therefore ask His Majesty’s Government for information. I made no reference to the Sheykh of Qatar’s reaction to Ibn Baud’s claim to the Jebel Makhsh, as reported in the Political Resident’s telegram No. 92 of 1st February 1936 to the India Office.
