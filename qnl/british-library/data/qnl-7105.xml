To this end, Lieutenant-Golonel Sir Percy Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, has favoured me with the treaties and engagements entered into between the Sheikhs above mentioned and the High British Government, and I hereby declare that I will abide by the spirit and obligations of the aforesaid treaties and engagements. IT.
