The first is a covering letter for a package of samples of piece goods sent by Kemball to Henry Bartle Edward Frere, Commissioner in Scinde [Sindh], Kurrachee [Karachi]. This is followed by a collection of correspondence between Kemball and Shariarjee Rustomjee, Bombay, on the subject of Shariarjee Rustomjee’s proposed sale of goods at Bushire and his engagement of an agent for this purpose. In response to his concerns that his goods should be taxed as British property and secured from unlawful encroachment, Kemball advises Shariarjee Rustomjee to appoint a British subject rather than the native agent proposed. One letter is from L Darling in London seeking to obtain commercial information regarding the market of Bushire. Kemball’s letter in reply includes a copy of a letter from Messrs I A Malcolm and Co., an American firm established in Bushire, providing the requested information. There is a letter from Kemball to Henry Creswicke Rawlinson, Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, Bagdad [Baghdad], on the subject of the establishment of a standing committee at Kurrachee for the direct sale of horses from the Persian Gulf. This letter includes copies of several others all relating to this same subject. The final two letters are letters of introduction, written by Kemball to Henry Bartle Edward Frere, recommending two horse traders bringing horses to Kurrachee for sale.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter book</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Commissioner, Sind</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Shariarjee?
