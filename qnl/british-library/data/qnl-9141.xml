Full copies of Pelly's journal can be seen in other files within this series, particularly Mss Eur F126/30 which is the original journal kept by Lewis Pelly, and Mss Eur F126/31 which is a neat version of it for submission to Government.These journal entries are accompanied by a later entry dated 10 September 1861 in which Lewis Pelly details the constant calls on his time whilst at Candahar and the sites he visited which prevented him from compiling his usual journal entries, before describing the telegram received from Earl Canning (Viceroy of India) in which he was instructed to leave Afghanistan by the more direct route and to meet the Viceroy in camp, and which ultimately prevented Pelly from travelling to Cabul and compelled him to cut short his stay in Candahar.The entry also describes the route he took back to India, including an attempt on his life on leaving Candahar which was thwarted by the mounted guards the Sirdar had assigned to accompany him, the attempts at intereference on his route to the Kojuck pass and his being obliged to force his horses through the pass owing to he and they being in a famished state and in need of relief and supplies. The letter also describes the eight horses he had brought with him from Herat and that only one was still in good health by the time he had reached Kurrachee [Karachi].The letter also describes how he carried 1000 gold Tomans, equivalent to Â£500 with him, which he kept in his saddle bags and which he used as pillows at night in order to protect the money; the total amount of money spent during his trip and the information gathered which he notes was submitted as a series of reports, letters and despatches sent both to the Indian Government and the Minister at Teheran [Tehran].</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023882889.0x00001c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
