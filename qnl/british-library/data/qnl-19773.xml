Sir, With reference to your letter No. 30,321, dated the 8th instaut^ I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to enclose, for the in formation of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a telegram' from the Government of India reporting the further shipment of oxide from Abu Musa, and to make the following observations in regard to it. In his Note of the 26th July 1910 (paragraph 1) enclosed in your letter dated the 2nd August 1910, the German Ambassador repre sented that Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. desired ' to ship a further 400 to 500 tons of the oxide,' and this was agreed to in Secretary Sir E. Grey's reply of the 22nd August 1910. It now appears that the amount actually shipped (so recently as May last) under this autho risation was 300 tons only, and that Messrs. Wonckhaus are desirous of shipping the whole of the oxide remaining over from the heap from which the 300 tons were taken, which they estimate at between 300 and Tong 400 tons. Although this quantity + Maximum quantity mentioned ic German Note of 26th July 1910 (paragraph 1) , - Shipped in May 1911 500 300 exceeds 200 tons,']' the maximum that they would strictly be entitled to remove, under the permission Remainder - - - 200 accorded in Sir E. Grey's Note of the 22nd August 1910 (paragraph 7), His Majesty's Government need not, in the Marquess of Crewe's opinion, object to its removal. As regards, however, the application made by the German Consul for permission to transport an additional quantity of 500 tons from the pit head to the shore, I am to observe that the request is of the + £IT , , , kind which the penultimate para- + '1 venture, however, to express the s - hope that, in view of the explanations now graph!]! of the Note of the 22nd given, the German Government will A st 1910 intended to abstain from supporting any further 0 requests of this nature which Messrs. forestall.

Grey sees no objection, the facts stated in Colonel Cox's telegram should be brought to the notice of the German Government, and that they should be informed that, while His Majesty's Government have consented to the removal of the rest of the heap (though estimated at between 300 and 400 tons), they trust that the application to transport to the shore another 500 tons is not made with the support of the German Government. A draft of a telegram in this sense is enclosed, which, subject to Sir E. Grey's concurrence, it is proposed to address to the Government of India. The favour of a very early reply is requested. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, (Signed) Lionel Abrahams. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. s. 91./7 FOiTUCH OFFICE, August 12th, 1911. 7/ith reference to my note of itu^ust 22nd 1910, relative to the shipment or red oxide from Abn Musa, 1 have the honour to state that, accordinp to a telefTraphic report from Hie Ma jetty's Consul General at Bushire, the German Consul at that port has applied on behalf of Messrs. Robert Wonckhaus and Company for permission to ahip as soon as possible, the balance of the mineral remaining on the shore of the island, which the Consul estimates at between three hundred and four hundred tons. The Consul has also applied for permission to transport a further quantity of five hundred tons from the pit-head to the shore As regards the first of these demands, I have the honour to observe that Your Excellency, in the first para graph of your note of July 26th 1910, stated that Messrs. Wonckhaus proposed to ship a further four hundred or five hundred tons of oxide and that permission to remove this amount was accorded in my JJote of August 22nd. ReportsSports recoiv^d from Lieutenant Colonel Cox show that the firm have already shipped as much aB three hundred tons, that amount havin^ been remjved in uay last, £o that the maximum additional amount which they are strictly entitled to remove, in virtue' of the permission given in my Bote above referred to, is two hundred tons only. Uot wishing, however, to interpret too literally thj! terms of the permission in question, I refrain from raising objections to Messrs. Wonckhaus' request and have the honour to inform iour Excellency that a telegram will be addrersed to Colonel Cox statin^ that His Majesty's Government have consented to the shipment of the balance of the heap. As regards the second application of the German Consul at Buthire - that for permission to transport a further five hundred tons of oxide from the pit-head to the shore, I have the honour to recall Your Excellency's attention to the penultimate paragraph of my note of August 22nd and to express the hope that this demand is not made with the support of the German Government.

I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of India, a statement of expenses incurred during the past year by the Residency Agent at Lingah in connection with visits to Abu Musa on my behalf and emergent petty repairs carried out on the sheds there. Since the dispute with the German firm arose in 1906, it has always been necessary for me to have a representative on the island while any mining or shipment of oxide has been in progress. Accounts previous to these I was able to settle out of the proceeds of the sample shipment of oxide taken by Messrs. Striek m June 1909, but it will be remembered that since the dispute began, the rent for the Concession formerly drawn by Shaikh Sagar, or Salim, from the island, has been under suspension and although the precautions and repairs connected with which this account is presented have been carried out in the interests of the suit, and therefore in the interests of the Shaikh, nevertheless the latter would certainly not relish having to pay and I would be glad if the Government of India would be pleased to sanction the disburse ment of such expenses, incidental to the course of the case, from Government funds. If desired, I would give the Shaikh a memorandum of them and saying that Government were pleased for the present to disburse these sums, but will reserve to themselves the right to ask him to reimburse them when the oxide industry is resumed and he is deriving income from it.

GBSMAN MBi'.Sf 'p, n i ^ Tloven'ber 6th 1911 • Your Excellency, In reply to Your Excellency's Hote No. 31523 of August 12th last I have the honour to state as follows According to that Note the Inperlal Consul at Bushlre has informed his British colleague that the firm of Robert Wonckhaus and Company of Lingah propose to ship further consignments of iron oxide from the island of Ahu-Musa. Mean while a comnunication on the subject has reached the Foreign Office in Berlin from the Consul at Bushire. The Imperial Consul was previously generally instructed to support the firm of V onckhaus in shipping iron oxide so long as these shipments consisted of oxide already mined lying partly in the vicinity of the shore, partly near the mines. These instructions correspond to our agreement with His . Britannic Majesty's Government as concluded in connection with our first memorandum on the subject of .December 1907. At the time Eis Britannic Fajesty's Government did not concur in our request that influence should be brought to bear on the Sheikh of Shargeh in order th c t the exploitation of the iron oxide mines might as quickly as possible be allowed again. On the other hand they proposed in their memorendum of January 10th 1908 that the firm of V onCiChaus should be allowed to ship the oxide already mined. Further negotiations then tooic place in thethe course of which It was expressly emphasized on our side that shipment of all the oxide lying at Abu Kusa should be allowed. By their attitude the Imperial Government met» to a great extent, the wishes of Kis Britannic Majesty's Government being only led to do so on the assumption that the main point would be settled in a satisfactory manner in the shortest time. Ris 3ritannic Majesty f s Government on their side informed us in the Hote ^erbrle of July 4th 1908 of their answer to our modified wishes and expressed in the following unambiguous words the view they then held in regard to the shipment question .the British Resident in the Persian Gulf was instruct ed on ivpril 9th to maice arrangements for transporting all the oxide already mined to the shore, in or^er that it might be ready for shipment by Messrs E r onci:haus. ,T In anojither place in the same Note Verbale it is stated There remain on the beach some 400 tons of oxide, and according to the estimation of Hassan Samaigah, about 3,000 tons of saleable quality near the mines. These amounts are at the disposal of Messrs FoncKhaus . Tho negotiations at that time in regard to this aspect of the matter were brought to a final conclusion by the above quote declarations of Kis Britannic Majesty's Government. tl AsAs a matter of fact Messrs Tonokhans have made several shipments of iron oxide from the Island of Abu Mnsa and In view of the arsurance given 'by His Britannic l!ajesty f s Government they could reckon on undertaking further ship ments at any time without meeting objections until the exhaustion of the amount already mined. The Imperial Government on their side thought they could assume, after the Issue of the general Instructions to the British Consul General In Bushlre by His Britannic Majesty's Government, that the question of separate ship ments would easily be settled between the two consular authorities on the ground of the understanding arrived at at the time, without a fresh discussion between the two Governments being necespary In each case. In view of the above mentioned assurance of His Britannic Majesty*s Government and of the negotiations which preceded it, it Is difficult to understand how the idea can have arisen that permission to ship could be Issued to Messrs Wonckhaus only in connection with their contracts and should be to some extent„dependent on the latter. In this connection reference must be made to the German Uote of July 26th 1910. When His Britannic Majesty's Government in their communication of August 22nd 1910 call attention to the fact that in their memorandum of July 10th 1908 thej'' pointedpointed to a connection 'between shipments and contracts of Messrs Wonckhaus, the untenahlllty of this point of view Is made clear at once from the course of the negotiations definitely concluded before this memorandum. Moreover the lep:al position thereby created Is expressly confirmed both In the Note Verbale of July 23rd 1908 and In the negotiations conducted In the year 1909. Finally, In paragraph 7 of their SfC, communication of Aupust 22nd 1910, His Majesty's (rovernmen^ rS themselves admitted, that the view of the Imnerlal Hovernment was In accordance with the text of the agreement reached. According to this explanation of the matter, the Imperial Government consider themselves entitled to expect that further shipments by Mesrr T'onckhaus of Iron oxldefalready mined will meet no difficulties In the future, t'hls solution Is absolute ly equitable aa Messrs Vonclchaus have suffered large losses by the stoppage of the mines - losses which in consejuence of the cwUljiiwrt^wr of the condition of affairs arising from the dispute at Abu-Musa are perpetually Increasing and which entirely exclude the possibility of any '^unfair' advantage to the firm over British Competitors. In this connection It is necessary to revert to another observation In Els Britannic Majesty's Government T s comnunlca- tlon of August 22nd 1910, to the effect that In the spring of 1910 some 400 tons of oxide already shipped still remained unsoldunsold at Karaburg. Enquiries have shown that this Is not a case, as His Britannic Ka.1esty f s Governraent appear to assume of an excess over the quantity which T'esrrs Wonokhaus were under contract to deliver to other firms; the fact is that this oxide which formed the greater part of the shipment by the Steamship 'Louise'', remained unsold 0'7ing to depreciation in value. This depreciation was caused by the fact that owing to the expulsion by the Sheikh of Shargeh of the workmen 'rho had made all preparations for a fresh shipment, the oxide had to lie for a long time on the shore and suffered both to quality and colour by bejng exposed to the weather, especially the action of the seawater driven over it by the violent winter storms, so that it was no longer up to sample and was refused acceptance. In consequence of the great interruption in the working of the mines Messrs Wonckhaus have not been able to fu.1-11 their contracts, but have had to repudiate them at a heavy loss. I have been instrucetd by ny Government to request that instructions may be Issued in order that the shipment proposed by Messrs V'onckhaus and any further shipments, in so far as iron oxide already mined is concerned, may now be carried out without delay. I an at the same time to give renewed expression to the desire of the Imperial Government that a final solution nay soonsoon be found to the Abn-Musa dispute and I should 'be grateful to Your Excellency for an Intimation of when we may expect a reply to our last raomorandum of December 1909.

Grey to transnit to I you, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, the accompanying copy of a note, dated November 6th, from the German Ambassador asking that, so far as the oxide already mined at Abu Musa is concerned, instruetjons may be issued to the effect that any further shipments by Messrs ^'onckhaus may take After a full consideration of all the circumstances and of the terms of former notes on the subject to the German Hmb^ ssy. Sir E. Grey considers that Eis Majesty's Government should accede to the German Government's request An this point, and that it would hardly be dignified to contest it. The oxide already mined has, as you are aware, apparently been damaged by exposure; so that no great commercial advantage would accrue to Messrs Vonckhaus over British competitors if the whole amount of oxide mined were placed at the firm's disposal Subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of State for India, Sir E. Grey accordingly proposes to inform the German Ambassador that the whole of the oxide already mined is at the disposalIndia Office, V.hltehall, London, S.W. 7 December, 1911. I an directed by the Secretary of State for India to aclmowledge the receipt of your letter No. 45779, dated the 4th December 1911, regarding the proposal to Inform the German Ambassador that the whole of the oxide already mined at Abu Musa Is at the disposal of Messrs Tvonckhaus. The Secretary of State for India fully realized that If the German Government did not listen to the appeal made In paragraph 8 of Sir E. Grey's note of the 22nd August 1910, It would be necessary In view of the language of earlier Foreign Office comnunlcatlons, to permit Messrs VTonckhaus to ship the whole of the oxide already mined, ^hat situation has now arisen, and he Is therefore prepared, fwhlle not accepting all the German arguments), to concur In the suggested Intimation to the German Ambassador. The question arises, however,whether having regard to the objects which His Majesty's Government hac* In view, as described In the Motes to the German Embassy of 21 September and 13 November 1909, It would not be desirable to require the removal of the mined oxide within a reasonable tine. In this connection, I an to Invite a reference to the letters of this Office, dated the 1st September and 2nd October 19 u 9, and tosuggest that the removal of the oxide should be effected before next hot weather, if Sir K. Orey sees no objection to this stipulation being made. If as alleged the oxide is deteriorating hy exposure to the air, the inducement to Messrs T-onckhaus to remove it quickly will be all the greater• If however Sir 3. Grey is of opinion that this stipulation will deprive the concession of whatever gracefulness it may be thought to possess, the Secretary of State for India will not press it.

[December 6.] Section 2. [35934] No. 1. SECOND MEMORANDUM OF HIS BRI TANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT RESPECTING THE CLAIM OF MESSRS. ROBERT WONCKHAUS AND CO. IN CONNECTION WITH THE SHIPMENT OF RED OXIDE FROM ABU MUSA [The marginal references are to the German text of the Second German Memorandum.] a HIS Majesty's Government have had under careful consideration the memorandum drawn up by the German Government relating to the occurrences on the island of Abu M ush , which was forwarded by the German Ambassador on the 4th December, 1909. In view of the nature of the arguments and evidence contained in that memo randum, it has been found necessary to cause further enquiries to be made in the Persian Gulf, and, although every effort has been made to avoid unnecc ssary delay, it has been found impossible to prepare the observations of His Majesty's Govern ment upon such arguments and evidence at an earlier date. For convenience of exposition, the conclusions arrived at by the German Government, as sum marised on pages 27-29 of their memorandum, are set forth each under a separate heading and printed in italics ; the observations of His Majesty's Government upon such conclusions, and upon the arguments and evidence by which they are sup ported in the body of the memorandum, are sub joined in ordinary type. Copies of all documents referred to, except such as have already appeared in previous communications, are annexed in the appendix. His Majesty's Government desire first to offer a few preliminary remarks on some of the facts which are enumerated on page 3 of the memorandum of the German Government as not being disputed. [2294/—2] BHis Majesty's Government agree that Sheikh p- Sagar was prevented by the British resident from driviner Sheikh Salim out of Abu Musa by force. There is no doubt that Sheikh Sagar, supported as he was by all the tribesmen, was in a position to treat Sheikh Salim, who had no means of defend ing himself, in any way he pleased, and it was only because Sheikh Sagar loyally submitted to the warnimr of the British resident that there must be no breach of the maritime truce that Sheikh Salim was allowed torema in in Abu Musa Island at all, and that arrangements were made for his maintenance. His Majesty's Government would observe that p- Abdul Latif, father of Esa, was not the British ' consular agent,' but Residency agent. With regard to the statement that 'the rent p- was paid regularly, and received by Sheikh Salim,' His Majesty's Government would point out that the German Government have omitted all reference to Sheikh Sagar's statement that, on being informed by Sheikh Salim of the concession that he, acting as Regent, had granted, he voluntarily set aside the amount ot the rent, as forming part of the revenue of Abu Musa, for Sheikh Salim, in order to make up his allowance to the original sum of 600 dollars, or more (see Appendix 5 to First British Memorandum). His Majesty's Government would also point out P- that the statement that the share of Slieikh Sagar was on the 10th October, 1907, sold by Hassan Samieh to Thomas Brown is somewhat misleading, if unaccompanied by any reference to the fact that such sale took place eight months after the cancellation of the concession by Sheikh Sagar, and a week after the delivery of the final order that all work was to cease. His Majesty's Government cannot agree that p the summary of the terms of the contract between Hassan Samieh and Herr Robert Wonckhaus is accurate, and would refer to the terms of such contract as set out in Annex 5 to the First German Memorandum. Similar observations apply to the summary of Sheikh Sagar's letter of the 21 st February, 1907, to Hassan Samieh (Annex 12 to First German Memorandum).3 With relerence to the statement that Sheikh Sagar on the 3rd October, 1907, again ordered that the work should cease, Uis Majesty's Govern ment would suggest the addition of the words ' and that he should remove his coolies and gear within ten days.' Similarly after the worefe 'Thereupon, about the 20th October, 1907,' the words ' Hassan having taken no notice of this warning ' should be inserted to render the state ment complete. His Majesty's Government are unable to concur in the account given by the German Government of the attempted landing on Aba Musa by two employes of the firm of Robert Wonckhaus and Co. The facts of the case are that Mr. Brown and several employes of Kobert Wonckhaus and Co., who, His Majesty's Government contend, had no right on the island at all, attempted to land, and persistently ignored warnings that were given. Finally, as they disregarded all friendly attempts to deter them from landing, a few shots were fired over their heads (Appendix 28 \ Mr. Brown has never made any complaint to the Besidency or the subject. His Majesty's Government now proceed to the consideration of the conclusions arrived at by the German Government. I. (a.) Sheikh Salim is owner of the island of Abu Musa; (b.) and therefore, according to the commercial law prevailing on the Persian Gulf, had a right to lease the oxide mines there to the mining company. Hassan-ihn-Ali and Co., in his own name. According to the Moham medan religious law he conld not conclude the lease agreement; according to that law, however, the company would have acquired the exclusive right to the produce of the mines simply by the fact of working them. It will be convenient to consider the above statements under two heads (a) and (b). (a.) Before considering the new arguments and evidence put forward. His Majesty's Government would point out that the allegation contained in the Second German Memorandum that the Britishmemorandum is inaccurate in stating that Sagar granted to Salim the revenue of the island, in cluding that derived from the mines, is not warranted by the facts ; nor is it accurate to say, as the German memorandum does, that Sakar in his own account only speaks of having assigned to Salim the amount of the rent of the oxide mines.' Sheikh Sagar's statement was as follows : ' Seeing that Sheikh Salim had ceased not to complain that the sum of 400 dollars was not sufficient for his subsistence, 1 voluntarily set aside the amount of this rent for him, that it might make up his subsistence, so that the total of what came in to him yearly might be GOO d Jlars as before, ami over, and that no cause of soreness might be left to him on account of the paucity of his allowance. I have absolutely not given him any deed in con nection with the island nor in regard to the mines therein ; all I did was to relinquish the income to him in the way of financial assistance from me to him, and it was done voluntarily and at my own discretion (First British Memorandum, Appen dix 5). The words ' I have absolutely not given him any deed ni connection with the island hot in regard to the mines therein show clearly that the word ' income ' which follows refers not only to the income from the mines, but to the whole income derived from the inland. And Sheikh Salim states: 'You were kind enough to place the island of Abu Musa under my supervision, so that I might cultivate therein and reap from it the means of subsistence' (First British Memo randum, Appendix 1). there can be no doubt that Sheikh Sagar permitted Salim to enjoy all revenue that might accrue from the island. In practice the only substantial revenue was derived from the oxide mines ; the other sources of income mentioned in the Second German Memorandum will be discussed later. The question at issue being whether the island of Abu Musa is the properly of Sheikh Salim or of Sheikh Sagar in his capacity as Sheikh of Shargah, His Majesty's Government brought forward as evidence in support of their contention declarations by both the suggested claimants, each of whom stated in the clearest possible way that the island is the property of Sheikh Sagar (First British Memorandum, Appendices 1 and 5) Evidence of so cogent and convincing a naturecan seldom, if ever, have been brought forward in a case where the title to land was in question, and His Majesty's Government can only express their surprise that the German Government should decline to accept such evidence. The objections suggested to such evidence seem to be as follows :— 1. The statements were made by interested parties. 2. They were made while the case was in pro gress and steps were being taken to collect evidence. 3. Major Cox was at Shargah at the time when they were made 4. They are out of harmony with the former attitude of the two sheikhs. 1. It mav be conceded that the statement of Sheikh Sagar (the date of which should obviously be, as suggested in the Second German Memo randum, 1908 instead of 1898) is open to the objection which may be taken to the evidence given by any claimant in support of his own case. But how it can be suggested that Sheikh Salim is ' interested' in disproving his alleged title to the island His Majesty's Government are entirely unable to understand. The effect of the cancella tion of the contract by Sheikh Sagar has been that Sheikh Salim has lost a considerable portion of his income, and the suggestion that the latter would be ready to give false evidence in support of the contention that Sagar had a right to take the step which has had such unfortunate results for Salim is one which cannot be maintained for a moment. The statement of Sheikh Salim's (to which he still absolutely adheres) is a declaration entirely against his interest, and is conclusive. 2. His Majesty's Government agree that these statements were made after the question ot the ownership of the island had been raised, and when evidence on the point was being collected. His Majesty's Government do not attach much weight to this objection, which would apply with at least equal force to much of the evidence contained in the annexes to the Second German Memorandum ; they would remark that there would obviously be no reason for making such statements (especially that of Sheikh Salim) before the question of title had arisen. 3. If this objection means that His Britannic Majesty's Resident, with the object of strengthen- [2294/—2] Cing the case, deliberately induced the two sheikhs to make statements which he and they knew to be untrue, His Majesty's Government cannot entertain any such suggestion. 4. This point will be discussed later. His Majesty's Government also produced, as further evidence of Sheikh Sagar's ownership of the island, two letters written by him in 1884 to the British resident (First British Memorandum, Appendices 3 and 4). It cannot of course be disputed that these letters were written long before the question of title had arisen, but the German Government deny that they can be relied p on as evidence of Sagar's ownership. His Majesty's Government are unable to accept P the German Government's account of the circum stances under which these letters were written. These circumstances have been explained above. At the time of Salim's deposition Sagar had all the tribesmen at his back, while. Salim had no folknv- ing at all; the only question was whether Sagar should forcibly remove Salim from the island, which course would involve a breach of the mari time truce. Sagar informed the British Resident on the 17th May, 1 883, that proposed to adopt this course, and was informed in reply that in order to avoid a breach of the truce he ought to arrange a peaceable settlement (First British Memorandum, Appendix 6). This was accord ingly done ; but had not Sagar been anxious to comply with the wishes of the British Resident there can be no doubt that Salim would have been forcibly and permanently removed from the island, in which case no question as to his title to it could ever have arisen. As it was, however, an agreement was arrived at, and Salim, who at the time of his deposition was at Abu Musa, was permitted by his successor to reside there. The agreement, however, did not work satisfactorily. Under these circumstances Sagar writes to the British resident to the effect that three courses are open; (a) that Salim should give a guarantee that he will do nothing to disturb the maritime truce ; (b) that the British Government should remove him from the island ; (c) that the British Government should stand aside while Sagar dealt with Salim as he thought fit. In both letters he states( ^ 7 clearly that the island is his property as Sheikh of Shargah. His Majesty's Government cannot accept the contention of the German Govern ment that all Sagar claimed was that Abu Musa was ' politically a dependency of Shargah.' There would be no object in Sagar's making such a statement to the Resident, who was well acquainted with the fact, and such an inter pretation would render the letters meaning less, as there was never a suggestion of Salim's setting up an independent state in Abu Musa. The meaning of the letters is clearly that if Salim is to be allowed to live on the island, instead of being forcibly ejected, his occupation must be distinctly understood to be without prejudice to Sagar's rights as owner, and the peace must be kept. His Majesty's Government would remark, with reference to the use of the words ' I, we, ' my,' ' our,' in the above letters, that in the original Arabic the plural forms are used throughout, His Majesty's Government are also unable to accept the contention of the German Government that when Sagar uses the w T ords 'our or 'my island' the meaning is ' the island belongs politically to the territory of Shargah,' while the same words in the mouth of Salim mean ' the island is my private property.' The cases in which Salim uses the words ' my' or ' our island' are considered below, but it may be remarked that in the opinion of His Majesty's Government no evidence of ownership can be derived from the use of such words by an occupier ; every man who pays rent for the house he lives in speaks of it as ' my house,' but that does not mean that he is the owner. With regard to Sheikh Sagar's letter of the 11th October, 1902 (First British Memorandum, Appendix 7), the German Government remark : ' In order to understand the letter, it would be interesting to know the purport ol Kemball s enquiry, to w r hich Sakar's letter was an answer, and which is not printed in the memorandum. The letter from Colonel Kemball referred to was in the following terms :— ' A report has reached me that you wish to grant a concession to Haji Nakhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh for excavating and exporting red oxide8 from the island of Sir Abu Nuair. I have there fore the honour to inform you that it would be advisable for you to let me see the draft of the concession before concluding the arrangements. ' I shall also be glad if you will let me see a copy of the concession granted to Haji Nakhoda Ali for working the red oxide mines on the island of Abu Musa.' It will thus be seen that the arguments based by the German Government on conjectures as to PP- 7, 8. the words used by Colonel Kemball fall to the ground. Colonel Kemball's only object was to ofter advice to the sheikh (as it was his duty to do) as to the terms of any concession he might propose to grant. This was the more necessary as Nakhoda Ali was a person of doubtful character (see Appendix 9). The sheikh replies that Colonel Kemball was mistaken in supposing that Nakhoda Ali was one of the concessionnaires, and states quite accurately the circumstances of the grant, including the fact that Salim made it as Regent. His Majesty's Government are unable to agree with the German Government that ' it cannot P- 8- be inferred from this letter that Salim was acting only as Regent ' ; the fact is stated in the plainest terms, and strong corroboration is derived from the phrase used in Esa's letter to Sheikh Sagar dated the 20th February, 1907 (Appen dix 27)—'the lease which I and two partners acquired from the Government of Shargah relating to the extraction of red oxide from your island of Abu Musa. 1 With regard to the suggestion that the statement that Salim cultivates in the island p. 8. implies that he was the owner of it. His Majesty's Government would only remark that if this contention is correct every tenant is the owner of the land he holds. No inference can be drawn from the quotation from the Administration p. 7 He port on the Persian Gulf, which appears to be based on incomplete information. The locality of the mines is not stated, and the erroneous state ment is made that Nakhoda Ali was the lessee, while it is expressly stated that further enquiry will be made. With regard to the statement alleged to have been made on the 28th November, 1907, by p. 8. Sagar on the subject of the treaty of 1892, the account of the conversation which the sheikh gave to His Majesty's Government soon after it took place does not tally with that contained inpp. 8, 9. 9 the Second German Memorandum, and His Majesty's Government cannot accept the latter as accurate. As the German Government are no doubt aware, and as will be shown later, the dragoman Mirza Hussein has now been shown to be a person on whose statements no reliance can be placed; further, he could not speak Arabic, and the interpreter was Abdullah-bin-Hassan-Samieh, Hassan Samieh's son, a person who was interested in putting such a statement into the sheikh's mouth. His Majesty's Government are disposed to agree that the meaning of the sentence in the sheikh's letter ' and the lease has remained up till now ' is probably that Sagar acquiesced in the conces sion when he returned from Mecca, as is stated by both the sheikhs (First British Memorandum, Appendices 1 and 5). At the time the letter was written nothing had occurred to make Sagar con sider the cancellation of the concession advisable. His Majesty's Government cannot agree that Sagar's statement that he voluntarily assigned the rent of 250 French reals to Salim is 'an ex parte statement for which there is no proof ' ; it is evidence of the best kind, and is supported by Saliin's statement, ' When I leased the mines of Abu Musa I was officiating on your behalf, and the concession was given by proxy for you' (First British Memorandum, Appendix 1), which shows clearly that Salim would not have received the rent from the mines if it had not been granted him by Sagar. The alleged facts with which the statement is said to be inconsistent are considered below. His Majesty's Government would point out that the phrase &lt;c the amount previously promised or to a little over that amount ' is an incorrect reproduction of Sagar's words ; the Arabic is ' wa ziyadeh,' i.e., ' and over or ' and more. The suggestion made by the German Govern ment that Sheikh Sagar's right to pasturage on Abu Musa may be merely a servitude to which the private property in the island is subject is entirely unsupported by evidence, and is not borne out by Major Cox's report (First British Memorandum, Appendix G;, to which reference is made). [2294/—2] D ■10 The German Government enquire why, under P 9- the arrangement of I88i, the revenue ot hir Abu Nuair was given to Salim to increase his pension, and not that of Abu Musa, which would have been more convenient, as he resided in the island. ^ The suggestion is that the revenue of Abu Musa already belonged to Salim as owner. The answer is that it would have been useless to give Salim the revenue of Abu Musa, because at that time the island produced no revenue at all. r lhis is shown by an extract from a letter written on the 14th October, 1880, to the British agent by the Residency agent, who, speaking of Abu Musa, ^ savs: ' Its water has altogether become salt, and the trees have died away. He (the Sheikh of Shargah, then Sheikh Salim) ' does not get anything from the place, not even a ' gaz' (a small copper coin). It is now proposed to consider the tresh evidence adduced by the German Government in support of the contention that Sheikh Salim is the owner of Abu Musa. It is asserted that ' Salim has always exercised P- 9- the right to wreckage on Abu Musa. * His Majesty's Government are not concerned to enquire whether the statement made is adequately supported by the citation of two cases in whicu pp» 9j 35. such a right has been claimed, because, even assuming the statement to be correct, it furnishes no evidence whatever of the ownership of Sahm. The right to wreckage, or jetsam and flotsam, is exercised in the Persian Gulf by the inhabitants of the place where the wreckage is cast up, and if the ruling chief comes to hear of it he is entitled ^ to a share, which he exacts or not as he sees fit. In the case of Abu Musa the right to wreckage ^ was exercised not by Salim alone, but by him m conjunction with the other inhabitants of the island, so that any argument in favour of Salim s ownership, based on the right to wreckage, would be an equally good argument in favour ot the ownership of all the inhabitants. In support of this statement the following documents are adduced ;— Letter dated the 17th May, 1894, from the Residency agent, Shargah, to the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, relating to the stranding of a Bahrein boat on Abu Musa (Appendix 1). Replies to above, 22nd June, 1894 (Appendix 2).Letter dated the 14tli April, 1907, from the Residency agent, Shargah, to the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, relating to the stranding of the British Indian Steam Navigation Company's steam-ship ' Bulimba' on Abu Musa (Appen dix 3). These letters show clearly («) that it was ' the islanders,' and not Salim alone, who claimed the right to wreckage ; (b) that it was the Sheikh of Shargah whose position and responsibility in the matter were recognised. On the general question of the incidence of the right to wreckage, and the position and practice in regard thereto, the following evidence is sub mitted ;— Letter dated the 1st March, 1895, from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Assistant Resident, Bunder Abbas (Appendix 4). Statement by Sheikh Sagar, dated the 25th March, 1911 (Appendix 5).

The effect of this overwhelming body of evidence is to show clearly that the right to wreckage is exercised by the inhabitants of the locality, subject to the right of the chief to claim a share if' he sees fit to do so. No evidence of Salim's ownership can therefore be deduced from the fact of his exercising such a right ; if Salim claimed and exercised the chiefs right to a share, it would be by virtue of Sheikh Sagar's permitting him to occupv the island, and any income which he derived from such a source would form part of the revenue of the island, which he was permitted by the sheikh to enjoy. It may also be remarked, with reference to the terms of Salim's letter of the 23rd March, 1898 (Second German Memorandum, p. 21 Annex 6), that at that time Salim was acting as Regent, and probably wrote the letter in that capacity. The German Government next refer to a version PP- 9. 10- of the oxide agreement (Second German Memo- PP 35-37, randum. Annex 7), dated the 6th April, 1898, which was cancelled four days later, and for which another agreement (Second German Memorandum, Annex 8) was substituted. This first agreement contained the words ' So long as 1, my children, and my brothers live, no one shall have a right to raise objections to it.' Thes^ words were omitted from the second agreement, and it is suggested that the use of such words clearly shows that Salim was the owner of the island. The position is thus as follows :— An agreement is drawn up./ \ bo 5&gt; 13 It is immediately cancelled, and a fresh one substituted. Certain expressions which appear in the first agreement are not found in the second. His Majesty's Government consider that the irresistible inference to be drawn from such facts is that the omitted expressions were objected to as inaccurate or misleading, and that for that reason the agreement was cancelled. His Majesty's Government are in a position to show that such was the case. Abdul Latif has explained (Ap pendix 9) that the original agreement was drafted by Abdullah-bin-Hassan Samieh, and was shewn by him to Abdul Latif, who at once objected (a) to the use of the expression now under discussion ; (b) to the inclusion of Nakhoda Ali as a signatory. The draft was accordingly cancelled and a fresh agreement drawn up, in which the objectionable expressions were omitted. The original draft was never seen by Sheikh Sagar until it was shown to him a short time ago (Appendix 5 . So far, then, from the use of the expressions referred to being evidence of Saliin's ownership, their omission from the second agreement is strong evidence against it. Reference is also made to the clause in the second agreement providing for a payment for the trade in 'mother-of-pearl and canary-seed.''* It is suoforested that this is ' inconsistent with oo Sheikh Sagar's statement that he had granted to Salim only the rent of the oxide mines.' It has been pointed out above that Sheikh Sagar has never made the statement attributed to him ; what he did say was that he had granted to Salim the revenue of the island, which of course included this payment in connection with oysters. Nor can any inference be drawn from the fact that the agreement under which Sagar became a partner provided that he should be responsible for a proportional part of this payment. The syndicate derived their rights from the document of the 10th April, 1898, under which both the annual rent and this special payment were secured, and any person entering the syndicate * It may l)e observed that the Arabic word translated ' canary-seed ' more probably refers to a kind of oyster. [2294/—2] E Snbufeuflll14 • would of course be as responsible for his share of the second as of the first. Sheikh Sagar, having assigned the revenue from this source to Salim, naturally, on becoming a partner in the syndicate, had to pay his proportion of it to him ; but it is ^ impossible to conclude from that fact that ' Salim p. 10. ^ had a right to the enjoyment in his own name of all sources of profit, to be derived from Abu Musa, and that he could exercise this right even as ngainst the ruling sheikh.' He had the right because it had been granted to him by the ruling sheikh, and when the ruling sheikh became a partner in a syndicate which was under contract to pay rent, which rent had been granted to Salim, he was of course bound, in his capacity as such partner, to pay to Salim his proportion of such rent. Even if the rent had been payable to himself, his share of it would of course have been debited to him in the partnership books. The object of the insertion of the clause in question was no doubt to make it clear that the liabilities of the other partners were proportionately reduced. The German Government also rely on the fact pp. 10, 37 that on the ^6th December, 1898, Salim granted a lease of the mica deposits on the island. The fact is not disputed ; it is clear that the lease was granted after Sheikh Sagar had relinquished to Salim the revenue of the island, and it appears from Sagar's statement (Appendix 5) that Salim consulted him about it, and that in pursuance of his declared policy he allowed Salim to keep any payments made on account of the mica as part of the revenue derived from the island. Sagar would no doubt welcome any arrangements which would increase Salim's income and prevent his 4 making applications for money. Little attention has been paid to this transaction, because it was soon £r discovered that no mica existed on the island, and the concession accordingly became a dead letter. When Sagar wrote his letter of the 22nd February, 1908, he had no doubt, as he states (Appendix 5), forgotten all about this concession, granted ten years before, and long since abandoned. The draft memorandum of association sent by Abdul Latif to Hassan Samieh on the 6th January, 1899, will be considered later. The fact that Salim stipulated in the mica lease p. 11. that only keshkeshuh trees should be cut is no evidence of his oWnership. He was admittedly in occupation of the island, and was thereforeL o i 15 entitled to see that acts of waste were not com mitted thereon. With reference to the letter dated the 12th November, 1898, from Abdul Latif to Hassan Samieh (Annex 15 to Second German Memo randum), in which reference is made to a dispute between the two sheikhs about the island of Sir, the position (which, indeed, is obvious) is explained by Abdul Lntif (Appendix 10). Under the 1884 agreement between Sagar and Salim (see Appendix 6, First British Memorandum) the revenue of Sir was assigned to Salim. The island, however, failed to produce any revenue, and in the 1889 agreement (see Appendix 6, First British Memorandum), no mention was made of it, the revenue of Abu Musa being subsequently transferred to Salitn in its place. When the possibility arose in 1898 of Sir pro ducing some revenue, Salim put in a claim to it under the agreement of 1884, to which Sagar not unnaturally replied that the 1884 agreement had been superseded by that of 1889, in which Sir was not mentioned. Thus arose the dispute referred to. Abdul Latif was naturally unwilling to conclude the Sir agreement until the dispute had been adjusted; he would have no hesitation about Abu Musa, not because he knew that Salim owned it, but because he was well aware that Sheikh Sagar was allowing him to enjoy its revenue. Finally, the German Government state that the opinion prevailing among the most respectable natives is that Abu Musa is the private property of Sheikh Salim. In support of this assertion there are quoted the opinions of three merchants of Lingah, two of whom are also stated to have asserted verbally that everyone who has any knowledge of affairs on the Arabian coast is of the same opinion. His Majesty's Government regret that they are unable to attach the slightest weight to the opinions of the persons in question. Abdalmuhsin-ibn-Ahmed Almushari is a pettv trader of Bahrein origin. He earns a precarious livelihood by speculating in pearls with borrowed money. Abdarrahman-ibn-Muhammed-ibn-Kazim is a16 Persian of Bastak. It is true that he was at one time French consular agent at Lingah, but in 1909 he was dismissed by the French consul, who had had occasion to complain of him. In 1907 he was proceeded against by the Customs for smuggling a large quantity of tobacco, and he lias recently been complained against for unlawfully flying the French flag on a dhow. Hamd-ibn-Khalifa Al'uyuni w r as a petty mer chant, but went bankrupt, and afterwards endeavoured to make a living as a news-writer by writing gossip to various notables in the Gull, and getting occasional presents from them. He recently died insolvent. As against testimony of this nature, His Majesty's Government bring forward the evidence of nineteen sheikhs, merchants, and notables of the Persian Gulf, who are familiar with the aftairs of the district. The names of these persons have been given above, and their statements are set out in Appendices G, 7, and 8. They state that the owner of Abu Musa is the Sheikh of Shargah, now Sheikh Sagar. His Majesty's Government agree that Salim, p. 11. with the consent of Sheikh Sagar, exercised (from the date of the arrangement made after the grant of the oxide concession) the full right of disposal of the usufruct of the island. This right was de rived from the permission granted to him by the owner, Sheikh Sagar. It is denied that lie exercised the right 'as against' Sagar, except in so far as the latter, while a partner in the syndicate, was responsible for the payment of his proportion of the rent. Finally, His Majesty's Government would enquire how it is suggested that Salim obtained his title to the island. His right to it as Sheikh of Shargah was lost when he was deposed ; and if the contention is that he had any other title there should be in existence documents of title or other evidence showing whence it was derived. No such evidence has been produced. Having thus examined the objections raised to the evidence brought forward in support of Sheikh17 Sagar's title, as Sheikh of Shargah, to the property in the island, and having considered the further evidence and arguments adduced in favour of the claim made on behalf of Sheikh Salim (though not endorsed by him), His Majesty's Gavernment are compelled to adhere to their conclusion that Sheikh 8agar is the owner of Abu Musa. (6.) Salim not being the owner of Abu Musa, and the revenue of the island not having been transferred to him at the time of the grant of the concession, he had no right, either according to commercial or Mahommedan or any other system of law, to grant a lease of the oxide mines, except in his capacity as Regent. The lease having been acquiesced in by Sheikh Sagar when he returned and took up the reins of government, he succeeded to the position occupied by Salim with regard to the agreement, except that he allowed Salim to receive the rent as part of the revenue of Abu Musa. The question of the validity of the lease will be more conveniently discussed under the next head. IL The owner of the island, whoever he may he, has no authority, either according to the lease agreement {which is to he judged hy com mercial laic^, or according to religious law, to revoke or terminate the rights of the mining company or to hinder the company in any other way from working the mines. His Majesty's Government are unable to accept the contention of the German Government that Sheikh Sagar had no right to terminate the agreement. Quite apart from the terms of the concession, he had, as ruling sheikh, absolute power to cancel it at any time he thought fit. If this were not so, the words used by Salim, in his capacity of Regent, in the agreement of the 10th April, 1898, Should I at any former date have made any contracts they are not valid, only this contract, which is written in two identical copies, holds good' (First German Memorandum, Annex 2) would be meaningless, and any previous contracts [2294/—2] F18 would be valid as against the present concession- naires. His Majesty's Government maintain that Sheikh Sagar's right to determine any concession granted in his dominions (a right which would exist even if the island were the private pro perty of Salim) could not legally be questioned, and, indeed, this is admitted by the statement on p. 14 of the Second German Memorandum that ' the reigning Sheikh of Shargah is the absolute ruler of his country.' If by a high-handed and unfair use of this right the concessionnaires, who at the time of the cancellation were all British subjects, had suffered loss, they could only obtain redress by an appeal to their Govern ment, in which case the matter would be solely one between the .sheikh and His Majesty's Government. This being the case, it is unnecessary to discuss further the meaning of the terms in the agree ment. His Majesty's Government find it difficult p. It. to decide what was the reason for omitting the time limit of twenty years in the second agree ment, as the meaning of Abdul Latif's statement (Appendix 9) that he ' saw no object in inserting any fixed period of time is not clear ; but they would remark that if the effect of the agreement really was that the lessees were entitled to put an end to the lease at any time, while the lessor was bound to allow T them to work the mines in per petuity, should they so desire, in return for a rent of 201. per annum, the arrangement was most inequitable. For the same reason His Majesty's Government are of opinion that the case is not one to which the principles of either the commercial or religious law can usefully be applied. But as the German Government produce evidence of this nature on which they rely in support of their contention that the lease was valid and could not be cancelled, it is proposed to deal with the point. The German Government produce opinions PP- j 3 ' 14 ' _ given by ' the leading merchants at Lingah and Bussorah,' who state that the lease is good and19 Cj V- p. 27. p. 44, &lt; - -■* valid, and cannot be terminated without the consent of the lessees. His Majesty's Government are unable to agree as to the weight to be attached to the opinion of these merchants; their reasons for considering that no importance can be attached to the opinions of Hamd-ibn-Khalifa ATuyuni, Abdarrahman-ibn- Muhammed-ibn-Kazim, and Abdalmuhsin-ibn- Ahmed-ibn-Mushari have been explained above. With regard to the other merchants whose opinions are quoted, His Majesty's Government cannot from the information at their disposal accej^t the description of them given in the German Memorandum. Abdullah Muhammed Hassan-al-Khodja is a member of a family which is ill-disposed to the authorities, and his testi mony is open to suspicion. Abdullah-ibn-Hassan- Kalladari is a close friend of Hassan Samieh, and agent of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. The signatories of the document which appears as Annex 24, are Turkish subjects from Bussorah, whose views on such a matter are of little weight, and as they erroneously state that the ' agree ment was concluded in the land of Persia,' their opinions appear to be founded on a wrong assumption. In refutation of this evidence the opinions are submitted of ten representative merchants from different parts of the littoral (Appendix 11), who are unanimously of opinion that the lease is void, because it lacks both the specification of period and the pronunciation of the legal formula of proposal and acceptance, which are essential * ^ 1 features of such documents. % pp. 14, With regard to the contention that by religious law surface mines are the common property of all Mahommedans, and that an indefeasible right is acquired by the mere tact of working them. His Majesty's Government are somewhat surprised that such an argument should be seriously put forward at the present day. It may be that the clergy of Islam continue in theory to support this ancient tenet, but it is a matter of common know ledge that it is now entirely disregarded, and no attempt could possibly be made to give effect to it in practice.20 His Majesty's Government would remark, with reference to the opinions of the clergy submitted by the German Government, that it will be seen that several of them, on their attention being called to the grounds on which His Majesty s Government contend that the lease is invalid, declared that such a contention was correct. His Majesty's Government submit a body ot evidence from distinguished members ot the clergy (Ap pendices 12, 13, and 14), including the chief priests of Lingah and Bushire, both Sunni and Shiah. The effect of this evidence is to show clearly ; — 1. That the lease was invalid for several specific reasons: (a.) The failure to insert the usual formula of proposal and acceptance. (h.) The failure to specify the period of the lease. (c.) The failure to specify the amount of profit to be derived by the lessee (Appendix 12). 2. That the lessor is therefore entitled to cancel the lease and eject the lessee (Appendices 13 and 14). His Majesty's Government are therefore of opinion — 1. That Sheikh Sagar had, as ruling sheikh, an inherent right to cancel the concession, if he saw fit to do so ; 2. That if the principles of either commercial or religious law are to be applied to the case, the lease was invalid, and could therefore be annulled. The German Government are mistaken in pp. 14, 15. stating that u The British memorandum further remarks that the principal object of Sagar was to administer justice as between the partners of the company on the strength of his ' sovereign rights of jurisdiction.'' The statement made in the First British Memorandum (p. 26) was ' The principal motive of the Sheikh of Shargah in cancelling, in accordance with the exercise of lua sovereign rights of jurisdiction, the lease granted in his behalf by the Regent in 1898 was evidentlyI 21 a proper and natural desire to administer justice as between the partners of the company . . . The contention of His Majesty's Government is, and always has been, that the sovereign rights of jurisdiction of the Sheikh of Shargah gave him the right to cancel the concession. The word jurisdiction was not meant to imply judicial jurisdiction, but the right of government. The questions therefore whether the sheikh ' had •authority to decide as judge the dispute between the partners of the mining company,' ' whether the decision arrived at was justified by law,'' and ' whether he had power to cancel the lease at his discretion in the interest of the administration of country ' are strictly irrelevant. In view of the careful consideration, however, given in the Second German Memorandum to these points, they will be dealt with. in their proper place. III. (a.) Hassan Samaih had authority, as manager of the mining company, to conclude agreements like that with Mr. Wonckhaus, signing in the name of the company, without consulting the other partners. Such agreements at once became binding on the other partners ; (b.) in the case under consideration, however, tljeir approval icas also signified. This point will be conveniently considered under two heads, (a) and (h). (a.) The German Government argue that the wide dispersal of the partners rendered it necessary that one of the partners should have authority to act for the others. His Majesty's Government agree that it is not unlikely that such an arrange ment would be made as regards the ordinary incidents of business, although there is nothing to show that such an arrangement was made, or, if it was, that Hassan Samieh was the partner selected to act on behalf of the others ; but the question now at issue is whether Hassan Samieh had authority, without consulting his partners, to conclude an agreement such as the present, which disposed of practically the whole output of the mines, at a fixed price, for four years, with an option of renewal, and limited the annual output of the mines to a maximum of 5,000 tons and the further small amount which was allowed to go to [2294/—2] G22 # India. Such an agreement was entirely outside the ordinary incidents of the partnership business, and it would require strong evidence to show that Hassan was in a position to enter into it without the knowledge or consent of his associates, especially as there was no need to carry matters through in a hurry, and the short delay necessary to enable the other partners to be consulted would not have prejudiced the conclusion of the agree ment, provided that they had raised no objection. The principal evidence on which the German Government rely consists of an unsigaed document (Annex 14 to Second German Memorandum), purporting to be a memorandum of association between the lessees, the first clause of which is alleged to give power to Hassan Samieh to con- clmle sales on behalf of the partnership. This document is said to have been drawn up by Abdul Latif, and sent by him in a letter dated the 6th January, 1899 (Annex 13 to Second German Memorandum), to Hassan Samieh, with a request that all the partners at Lingah should sign. It is further alleged that the document was signed bv Hassan Samieh, Abdullah, and Nakhoda Ali, who added a clause providing for the purchase of boats, and returned the document to Abdul Latif. On the 21st January, IS99, Abdul Latif wrote a letter to Hassan Samieh (Annex 40 to Second German Memorandum), in which he objected to the purchase of boats. Hassan Samieh then replied agreeing to the cancellation of the boats, and thereupon the arrangement is said to have become operative. No evidence, except Abdul Latif's two letters, is produced in support of the statements marie. It appears from Abdul Latit s second letter that when Hassan Samieh and his partners at Lino-ah returned the document to Abdul Latif O with the additional clause about the boats they made certain other suggestions in a covering letter. Abdul Latif objected to these suggestions as well as to the provision about the boats, and there is no ground for alleging that the arrange ment became operative merely because Hassan agreed to waive the provision about boats. It is not suggested by the German Government that the memorandum was ever signed by the other partners, Sh-ikh Sagar, Esa-bin-Abdul Latif, and Mr. Malcolm, who, as stated on p. 12 of the Second German Memorandum, was a partner in the company, but who had entered it, not ' two p. 21. pp. 39, 40. v t p. 21. pp. 38, 39. p. 21. * pp. 56, 67. pp. 21, 22. k AT23 years ^fter the conclusion of the lease agreement,' but on the 27th December, 1898 (see Appendix 16). It is hardly necessary to remark that no such document could be binding on the partnership unless signed by all the partners, and that there fore the document is valueless. The mere fact that clause 6 of the memorandum, to which Abdul Latif objected, and which Hassan Samieh, according to the Second German Memorandum, was -willing to cancel, was never struck out, but appears in the document as now produced, shows conclusively that the memorandum was never completed or executed, and consequently never came into operation. This is also shown by the fact that no accounts have ever been rendered to the partners who were not at the mines (see Appendix 17), whereas under clause 9 of the alleged memorandum this had to be done every four months. A further statement by Abdul Latif is annexed (Appendix 15) which shows clearly what occurred After Abdul Latif's letter of the 21st January, 1899, objecting to several of the suggested pro visions, the matter dropped. The document was never completed or signed by the remaining partners, and was never even shown to Sheikh Sagar. It has never been seen by Nejef (Appen dix 22). Mr. Malcolm states (see Appendix 1 7) that, to the best of his belief, he never saw or heard of the so-called memorandum, and certainly never signed it. In any event, even if the document were taken as being in force, there is nothing in its terms which would justify Hassan in entering into contracts, other than ordinary sales, with out consulting his partners. The contract with Wonckhaus cannot be regarded as an ordinary sale, because (apart from the small shipments to India) it prevented the sale of oxide to any other person, and because, in effect, it would necessarily have limited the output to the amount taken by Wonckhaus and the purchasers in India. This document, then, having never come into force, the only agreement governing the affairs of the partnership was that dated May 1898 (First German Memorandum, Annex 2), under which H assan Samieh had no such powers as suggested. The manner in which the affairs of the partner ship were conducted is shown in Mr. Malcolm's statement (Appendix 17). It is, of course, not24 disputed that Hassan did attend to part ot tlie business of the company, as did some of the other p* 23. partners, but that fact has no bearing on the question whether he had authority to make the contract in question. The same comment may be made on the letters from Mr. Malcolm to Hassan, PP* 57 on which reliance is placed by the Get man P* 28. Government; in fact, the first two letters aie clear evidence that Hassan did not consider him self entitled to act without consulting his partners. The third letter is specifically addressed to the firm, and not to Hassan, and there is no evidence to show how it was dealt with. His Majesty's Government are unable to agree that the proposed contract wus very similar to that with Wonck- p. 28. haus,' but do not consider the point worth detailed discussion. No inference in favour of the conten tion of the German Government can be drawn from these letters. Esa's letter to Sheikh Sagar, dated the 20th February, 1907 (Appendix 27), shows that he did not consider that Hassan possessed the authority now claimed for him, and foui letters from Hassan Samieh are annexed (Appendix 18), which show that Hassan considered himself under an obligation to consult .his partners, and knew that they were entitled to complain if he failed to do so. The phrase in Hassan's letter of the 21st January, 1908, 'You know what friendship existed between us and your father, Haji Ali, deceased, who did nothing except after consultation in our business','' suggests that, if one partner was more prominent than the others, it was Nakhoda Ali, and not Hassan. Hassan's own contention throughout has been, not that he had authority to conclude the con tract without consulting his partners, but that they approved of it. In his letter to Abdul Latif (Annex 11 to First German Memorandum) he says; ' You are the Lord of the Learned ; you know that I did this knowing that you were agreeable to it.' In his letter to Salim (Annex 18 to First German Memorandum) he says; ' As you know, all the contracts and correspondence from the beginning till this day have been done by knowledge and approval of the British political agent, Abdul Latif, and all of you.' This shows that at the time he did not claim for himself the right which is now attributed to him. In conclusion. His Majesty's Government would remark that, if Hassan really possessed the right mmm ^to conclude the contract without consulting his partners, it is difficult to understand his attempts to conceal it from them, and to deceive them as to its terms. (6.) The German Government also contend that all the partners expressly approved the agreement. The persons concerned (omitting Abdullah, who may be assumed to have supported his father) are Esa, Malcolm, and Nejef, son of Nakhoda Ali. The German Government dispute that Nejef was a partner, arguing that Nakhoda Ali ' had a share on the strength of his engaging to super intend the work at tlie mines, without putting capital into the concern, that his partnership was connected with personal services, and there fore ceased at his death. This contention is not supported by the terms of the document under which he became a partner (Annex 2 to First German Memorandum), which placed him in precisely the same position as the other partners. Moreover, as it is pointed out on p. 18 of the Second German Memorandum that the only partners who put any capital into the concern were Hassan and Malcolm, it follows, if the contention of the German Government is correct, that the other partners, who neither put capital into the concern nor superintended the work at the mines, had no claim to their shares at all. The suggestion that Nakhoda Ali was not a partner, but only an 'employe of the company with a share in the profits,' is plainly untenable, in view of the provision in the document under which he became a partner (Annex 2 to First German Memorandum) that he was to bear his share of the expenses—an unheard-of pro vision in the case of an employe. It appears from Malcolm's statement (Appendix 17) that Nakhoda Ali was originally the most important member of the firm ; and reference may also be made to the sentence quoted above from Hassan's letter to Nejef, dated the 21st January, 1908. The suggestion made by Abdul Latif, that it might be possible to extinguish Nakhoda Ali's share at his death on the grounds indicated, must have come to nothing, judging by the later documents as if the surviving partners had thought it possible to get rid of the share in such a way, they would certainly have done so. [2294 /—2] H26 It may be that Hassan and Abdullah now con- p. 17. sider it advisable to deny that they considered Nejef a partner, but their letters written at the time (Appendices 18 and 19) show clearly that they did so consider him. The letters of Hassan, . in particular, which are set out in Appendix 18,^ are conclusive on the point. Particular atten tion is also called to the letter dated the 24th December, 1907, from Malcolm, annexed in Appendix 20, which shows that at that time both Malcolm and Abdullah recognised Nejef as a partner. If Nejef was not and never had been a partner, the suggestion that he on several occasions p. 17. expressed his approval of Hassan's proceedings is meaningless; there would be no possible reason for his expressing an opinion on the matter if it did not concern him. Nejef is asserted to have expressed his approval P- 17. to Abdullah in the presence of the German dragoman in November 1907. No authority is given for this statement. Abdullah's motives for attributing such a statement to Nejef are obvious, and His Majesty's Government have explained already that they are unable to attach any weight to statements made by the ex-dragoman Mirza Hussein, who, as the German Government are no doubt aware, has now been denounced by the Persian Government, prosecuted by the Customs and Messrs. Wonckhaus for dishonesty, and dis missed from his post in the German consulate. Nejef has sworn an affidavit (Appendix 21) in which he denies having made the statement attributed to him, and his account is corrob orated by the letter written shortly afterwards by Malcolm, which is set out in Appendix 20, and also by Nejef s petition to Lieutenant Gabriel dated the 16th February, 1908 (First British Memorandum, Appendix 18). These documents also show plainly that Nejef was recognised as a partner. With regard to the statement said to have been pp. 17, 60, made by Nejef to Brown (an employe of Wonck haus and Co.) in March 1908, to the effect that he approved of the contract with Wonckhaus, the story is incredible, in view of the fact that a month before Nejef had sent in a formal petition to the British vice-consul at Bunder Abbas (First British Memorandum, Appendix 18) stating that he ' did not in any way agree to this contract made by Hassan.' Nejef's account of the inter-TJ - * (S) 27 view, as given by him on oath, is set out in Appendix 21. But even if the story were true, it would not affect the fact that in February 1 908 Nejef expressed his disapproval in the most formal method at his disposal. In any case His Majesty's Government are unable to consider nn expression of approval, given long after the cancellation of the concession, as equivalent to a confirmation of the contract. w t- p. 18. His Majesty's Government observe that the German Government do not allege that Malcolm ever expressly approved of the contract ; all that is stated is that no objection was raised by him. Without going into the question whether a failure to raise objections could amount to the necessary approval, it must be pointed out that no inference can be drawn either from Malcolm's silence or his letters, because of Hassan's successful attempts, by means of falsehood and deception, to keep him in the dark as to the facts. When asked by Malcolm for a copy of the agree ment, he first made the untrue statement that the agreement was in German, and then asserted that Wonckhaus had bound him to secrecy ; while the account given by him in his letter of the 13th July, 1906 (First British Memorandum, Appendix 13) omitted the most important provisions of the contract. His Majesty's Government are quite unable to p. 18. agree that this letter ' communicated all that was of importance'; the very provisions to which the other partners took objection when they heard of them were carefully omitted, p. 18. This argument is also inconsistent with the further contention of the German Government that Hassan was entitled to keep the terms of the contract secret from Malcolm, because the latter was connected with Strick and Co., who held the Hormuz oxide concession. His Majesty's Government are unable to appreciate this contention, and in any case it is clear from Hassan's letter of the 14th October, 1906 (First British Memorandum, Appendix 14), that the person he really wished to keep in the dark was Abdul Latif, who had repeatedly warned him against making a contract of such a nature, p. 51. In his letter of the 30th October, 1906 (Annex 34 to Second German Memorandum) Malcolm expressly protests against the terms of the agree- F28 ment being kept secret from the partners. This letter also expressly recognises the possibility of the cancellation of the contract by the partners, if they considered it advisable. When Malcolm did ultimately receive a copy of the agreement in December 1906, the contract was already six months old, and while he was still considering what action to take the situation was completely changed by the cancellation of the concession by the sheikh. His Majesty's Government do not dispute the p- 19. fact that Abdul Latif, on behalf of Esa, did not object in 1905 to the sale of oxide to AN onckhaus at a fixed price, but, as it is not suggested that the contracts of that date contained the provisions to which he did afterwards object, it does not affect the present question. As regards his letter of the 14th June, 1906 (First British Memorandum, Appendix 12), His Majesty's Government must repeat that no weight can be attached to any expression of approval (if such can be deduced from the terms of the letter) given in ignorance of the terms of the contract. The non-disclosure of material terms would be held fatal by any court in which it was sought to rely on any such expressions of approval as constituting a ratifica tion of the contract. And the letter expressly warns Hassan against entering into any contract which would give an outside partj an excuse t^'i claiming rights in the island. Such warnings had been given before, and Hassan bad disclaimed any intention of entering into such a contract. In addition to the documents already quoted in this connection, reference may be made to two letteis from Hassan to Abdul Latif, dated respectively the 30th January, 1905, and the 5th July, 1P06 (Appendix 23). No doubt Hassan's object was to conceal the terms of the contract from his partners for as long as possible, in order that when they w^ere ulti mately discovered he might be able to say that the contract had been in operation so long that it was impossible to go back on it. When Abdul Latif had an opportunity of examining the terms of the contiact he objt ctt i in the plainest terms, and announced his resolution of cancelling the contract. The German Government contend that the p. 20. sentence in Abdul Latif's letter of the 23rdI ' 29 pp. 52, 53. January, 1907 (Annex 36 to Second German Memo randum), which has been translated ' the nullifi- ance,' really bears the meaning 'It is better to try to cancel the agreement than to do as he [the pp. 53-55. two opinions are quoted (Annexes 37 and 38 to Second German Memorandum) which reach this conclusion upon different grounds. Both these opinions are purely theoretical, and do not take local usage into account. Hi&gt;&gt; Majesty's Govern ment would point out that in Enclosure 8 to the First German Memorandum the words in question are translated ' The cession [? cessation] of this • • • contract would be preferable to its continuance. His Majesty's Government also bring forward, in support of their view, the opinion (Appendix 24) of the well-known missionary the Rev. S. M. Zwemer, who has laboured for some fifteen years among the Arabs of the Persian Gulf, and probably knows their local peculiarities of speech and writing better than any other living man. His opinion entirely supporLs the contention of His Majesty's Government. Being, however, ot opinion that when the meaning to be attributed to a phrase is in question, the best evidence is that of the person who used it, His Majesty's Government annex a statement (Appendix 25) by Abdul Latif, which makes it clear that he used the vords in the sense attributed to them by His Majesty's Government, and that such would be the ordinary meaning of the phrase as understocd in those parts. The statement also shows that Hassan understood the words in that sense, and quoted them in that sense (but more grammatically and unmistakably) in his reply. This reply is set out in Appendix 26. the contention that Abdul Latit's letter, by re commending the cancelling of the agreement, admits that it had legal force. It is admitted that the contract was binding as between Hassan and Wonckhaus and Co., and therefore Hassan could only be released from it by cancellation; but the question at issue is whether it was bind ing on the partnership, and His Majesty's Govern ment contend that the evidence is clear that it was not. There is no doubt that Esa himself objected to the contract when he heard of its terms. This is clearly shown by his letter of the 20th February, P- 20 * cation of this agreement is better than its accept- German] wishes.' In support of this contention i* p. 20. His Majesty's Government do not agree with [2294/—2] I30 1907, to Sheikh Sagar (Appendix 27), which also proves that he did not consider Hassan as having authority to conclude the contract without con sulting his partners. His Majesty's Government are therefore of opinion :— 1. That Hassan bad no authority to conclude the contract in question without the consent of his partners. 2. That Nejef was a partner on the same terms as the others. 3. That neither Nejef, Malcolm, nor Esa ever approved the agreement, but, on the contrary, at least two of them, when they heard of the terms, formally expressed their disapproval. 4. That even if any expression of approval can be deduced from the terms of Abdul Latif s letter dated the 14th June, L906, it was given in ignor ance of the most important terms of the contract, which had been wrongfully concealed by Hassan from his partners, and that on hearing of those terms Abdul Latif emphatically repudiated the transaction, IV. The agreement with Mr. Wonckhaus is advayi- tageous to the mining company, so that the partners have not been injured by Hassan SamaiJis action as manager. It is not considered necessary to consider again the question whether the agreement was finan cially for the benefit of the company, especially as, no accounts ever having been rendered by Hassan to his partners, it is impossible to test the accuracy of the books as now quoted. It is only necessary to remark that at least two of the partners considered that the arrangement was not advantageous to the company, and formally protested against it. It may also be added that, if it really was to the benefit of the company to enter into the contract, it becomes more difficult than ever to account for Hassan's anxiety to conceal its terms from his associates. It is possible, however, that this desire for concealment was due to a feeling that the contract might impair the relations between the company and the sheikh, in which case it would not be to the advantage of the company, even though financially it might have led to an increased revenue.31 V There was therefore no reason for a complaint of the company against Hassan Samaih on the (jround of action contrary to agreement or duty. This point has been discussed under the two preceding heads. VI. There was accordingly no ground for action on the part of Sheikh Sagar against Hassan Samaih for the protection of the other partners. Moreover, the seat of the company is at Ling ah, and the partners of the com pany are not subjects of the Sheikh of Shargeh, so that he has no jurisdiction in matters concerning the relations of the partners with each other. In any case, he coidd not exercise such jurisdiction himself, hut should have had the dispute settled hy the judge. Although it is hardly accurate to say that Sheikh Sagar took action against Hassan, it has been shown that there was abundant ground for his action when appealed to on behalf of the partners whose wishes and instructions had been disregarded, and who had been deceived, by their associate Hassan. It has been already pointed out that it has never been contended by His Majesty s Govern ment (or, as is admitted on p. 15 of the Second German Memorandum, by Sheikh Sagar) that the sheikh's action in cancelling the concession was intended to be that of a judge deciding the rights of the partners as between themselves; it was an act which in his sovereign capacity he was entitled to do, and no doubt one of his objects was to release the complaining partners from the position in which they found themselves owing to the 'unauthorised action of Hassan. This being so, the arguments adduced in the Second German Memorandum to show that the sheikh was not the proper tribunal to adjust the rights of the partners are beside the mark. It is only neces sary to remark that, as far as the cancellation of the concession was concerned, the sheikh was the only person who could act.32 After the cancellation of the concession, the adjustment of the rights of the partners, as between themselves, by the appropriate tribunal (whatever that may prove to be) would under normal circumstances have been an easy matter. Nor is it impossible that the sheikh might have been willing to grant a fresh concession under proper conditions. But the course events have taken, in particular the intervention of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co., has so far rendered this impracticable ; though when the questions now at issue have been settled it may yet be possible for steps to be taken in the matter. In any case, the pp. question whether Sagar's action violated the rights of the partners, who were all British subjects, is obviously one to be discussed, if at all, between the sheikh and His Majesty's Govern ment. VII. The agreement between the mining company and p. 28. Mr. Wonckhaus, which is nothing hut the conclusion of an ordinary and permissible business transaction, and which cannot have any political aims, neither infringes the lease agreement nor is in any way dangerous to the interests of the. State of Shargeh, so that the action taken by Sheikh Sagar against the company cannot he justified on the ground of the general interests of the administration of the country. It has been already pointed out that, whether the sheikh 's action was 'justifiable'' or not, it was certainly one which he had power to take, and could not legally be questioned. His Majesty's Government agree that the contract with Wonckhaus was not strictly a letting of the p. 26. mines to him. But it is submitted that it was not unnatural that the sheikh should look with some apprehension upon the acquisition of so large an interest in the produce of the mines by persons who were subject neither to his juris diction nor to that of the British Resident in the Persian Gulf. The German Government are aware that as late as 1904 an attempt was made to seize Abu Musa by a Belgian customs officer in the Persian service, who hauled down the sheikh's flag and hoisted the Persian standard. And it cannot be denied that the actions of Messrs. Wonckhaus have been eminently calculated33 to suggest that they were anxious to claim rights in the island and not merely in the produce of the mines. Thus, on the 19th October, 1907, Messrs. Wonckhaus wrote to the sheikh :— 'We consider the mines and the concession for them as a security for the advances paid. If you force Haji Hassan-bin-Ali Somayah and Co. to withdraw their coolies and representatives, we shall have to stmd over some men ourselves to protect our property.' When Brown and his men left for the island on the 2ind October, 1907, they took with them a German flag, which it was intended to place on the accumulations of oxide. On the 19th November, 1907, the German vice- consul at Bush ire threatened the sheikh with a claim for a lakh of rupees, and claimed for Messrs. Wonckhaus the ritrht of direct concern in the working of the mines. His Majesty's Government entirely agree with the German Government that the question in this case is purely commercial, and not political. But in view of the above facts, it appears that Sagar's fears were not altogether as 'senseless' as has been suggested. For reasons already given, h &gt;wever, His Majesty's Government are of opinion that the question whether such considerations 'justified ' the sheikh's action does not arise. VIII. Sheikh Sakars interference is not limited to redressing a wrong alleged to have been done by one 'partner to the others, or to preventing the carry nig out of a n agreement alleged to he contrary to the interests of the country, hut simply deprives the whole company of the basis of its existence. The company, in which the German firm of Robert Wonckhaus and Co. have a share, is thereby very seriously injured, since the realisation of its object is made impossible, and it is not in a position to carry out current obligations imposed upon it by contract. No new points are raised under this head. Sheikh Sagar's action was the only one he could take with a view to putting an end to the position in which the company found itself owing to the [2294 /—2j K34 action of Hassan. It may be mentioned that so far from Sheikh Sngar having ' put in his pocket P* the whole valuable object in connection with which the company was founded, the result ol his action has been that no revenue has been received from the mines from that day to this. The question whether Wonckhaus and Co. can be considered as interested in the company is considered below. It is no doubt unfortunate that the company has been unable to resume its operations since the cancellation, but, as has been pointed out above, that is not the fault of the sheikh, but is due to the course which affairs have taken. V IX. SdkoT^s proceedings, then, are clearly a violation P* of law—an exercise of arbitrary power. The German Government do not suggest what law it is that was violated by Sagar s proceedings. His Majesty's Government have already pointed out that the sheikh's right to cancel the concession is one that cannot be questioned, and that it is a mistake to consider his action as an adjudication of the rights of the parties as between themselves. His Majesty's Government must :dso repeat, that even if Sagar's proceedings were ' a violation of law,' the question would be, under the circum stances, one which could only concern the sheikh and His Majesty's Government. 29. ' * His Majesty's Government regret that they are p. 29. entirely unable to recognise Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co. as in any way concerned in the present question. It is clear that Messrs. Wonckhaus had a good cause of action for breach of contract against Hassan; or, if the contention of the German Government were correct, that the con tract was binding on the partnership, they would have a cause of action against the paitnership. They have never attempted to avail themselves of either ot these remedies. It is obvious, there fore, that Messrs. Wonckhaus can have no claim against Sheikh Sagar in their capacity as parties to the contract, whether it was made with Hassan or with the mining company.35 It would appear that no serious attempt is made in the Second German Memorandum to maintain the proposition that Messrs. Wonckhaus are concerned in the matter as having purchased a share in the partnership eight months after the cancellation of* the concession. Apart from the fact that the transference of a share in an extinct concession could have no legal eftect, it is difficult to see what cause of action, either in contract or in tort, could exist against the sheikh, at the suit of Messrs. Wonckhaus, for cancelling a concession to which they were not parties. It is not dis puted that Messrs. Wonckhaus were aware, at the time when they purported to purchase the share, that the concession had been cancelled. Even assuming that the cancellation was unjustitiable, it cannot be disputed that it was effective, and that the concession came to an end at that time. If the cancellation was unjustifiable, it might give rise to a claim for compensation by the persons who were partners in the firm at the time, but certainly not to a claim by persons who, with full knowledge of the facts, purported to acquire a share months later. Thus, in any case, Messrs. Wonckhaus have no locus standi; and His Majesty's Government can only regard their action as an attempt to place themselves in a position which would enable them to bring pressure on the sheikh. It is noteworthy that an attempt w T as made in November 1907 to ,induce Nejef to transfer his share to Abdullah (see Appendix 21), and the fact that the transfer was to bear a date previous to the contract between Wonckhaus and Hassan, and therefore previous to the cancellation of the concession, suggests that the intention was to re transfer the share to Messrs. Wonckhaus. It may also be remarked tiiat the sales of the share in question by Yussuf to Hassan, and by Hassan to Brown, were invalid in any case, because the documents of transfer did not bear the signatures of all the partners, as was neces sary under the deed by which Malcolm became a partner (see Appendix 16). The concession having been cancelled, and Hassan having disregarded the warning given him on the 3rd October, 1907, to remove his coolies and gear within ten days, the sheikh was clearly entitled to take steps to ensure theirjmoval. The action taken by His Majesty's * overnment to ensure that no breach of the • eace should take place was explained in the First British Memorandum. His Majesty's Government have already given PP- 29 » 80 ' the correct account of the proceedings when Brown attempted to land on Abu Musa. It is clear that the employes of Messrs. Wonckhaushad no right to be on the island at all, and this is admitted by the statement on p. 26 of the Second German Memorandum : ' The^stipulation that the oxide is to be delivered free on board, and the detailed arrangements concerning the quantity to be loaded daily, make it clear that Mr. Wonckhaus was not to have anything to do with the working of the mines themselves.' Thus the sheikh had a perfect right to prevent the men from landing, and no claim for compensation can possibly be put forward on those grounds. His Majesty's Government are therefore of opinion that Messrs. Wonckhaus have no claim against Sheikh Sagar or His Majesty's Govern ment. Foreign Office f December 6, 1911.37 A ppendix 1. The Residency Agent, Shargah, to Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. May 17, 1894. A letter reached me from the residency agent residing at Bahrein, enclosing a copy of a letter from the Chief of Bahrein regarding a jolly boat belonging to one of Sheikh Isa's subjects, named Mohamed-bin-Saleh-bin-Jebara, which stranded on the Isle of Abu Mnsa. Your servant endeavoured to release the jolly boat from the hands of the inhabitants of Abu Musa for the sum of 70 dollars; at the time Mohamed-bin-Saleh- bin-Jebara was present with me the inhabitants of Abu Musa refused, but [would] only accept half [of the value of the boat and cargo], according to custom. Mohamed-bin- Saleh-bin-Jebara departed from Bahrein to inform his chief [and point out] that should he desire to entreat the Chief of Shargah on account of friendship or [for] other reason [the latter would release it]. When the [Bahrein] agent's letter reached me I returned an answer according to what had passed on this subject, but no reply has come [to it]. According to what is noticed by me [i.e.], that the inhabitants of Abu Musa voyage in the jolly boat and convey cargo, it has become necessary to inform you, as probably that an accident may befall the boat. It is better that the owners of the jolly boat should strive to release the boat. Bahrein agent's letfer, a copy of the Chief of Bahrein's letter are enclosed. A ppendix 2.

If no previous agreement has been made by the parties regarding the amount of salvage, and if die circumstances of the case show that the claim for a half share of the boat and cargo is exorbitant, you may use your good offices with the Chief of Shargah to induce to salvers to accept such remuneration as may be just and reasonable according to local custom and usaofe.

A ppendix 3. Residency Agent, Shargah, to Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. April 14, 1907. I beg to state that the chief officer of the British Indian Steam Navigation Company's steam-ship ' Bulimba' came to me on the 1st April, 1907, reporting that the steamer had stranded on the Bu Island and asking me to notify the Shargah merchants to send lighters to Bu Musa for the purpose of landing the cargoes they had [2294/—2] ^ ton board her. I notified the merchants accordingly. The officer then proceeded to Debai to meet the ship s agent, Mohamed-bin-Ibrahim, and arrange for the dispatch of lighters to Bu Musa. I was informed by the officer that the islanders had not agreed to render the vessel any assistance unless they received half the cargo. The agent, Mohamed Ibrahim, having asked me for assistance to be rendered to the steamer, I sent with him my brother, Maaraj-bin-Abdul Rahman, to Bu Musa lest the islanders may do something irregular towards the ship's crew and the cargo, which it may be desirable to discharge on the island in order to launch the vessel. I took likewise a letter from the Chief of Shargah to the islanders ordering them to refrain from raising objections against the ship's crew, and to give them such help as they can. However, by God 's grace and the company's good fortune, the sea remained calm and waveless while the vessel was stranded until arrangements were made for launching her. According to Maaraj's report to me. His Majesty 's ship ' Highflyer ' had visited Bu Musa just as the stranded vessel was being launched. Thank God nothing unpleasant occurred in the vessel's stranding, but if a storm had taken place she would have incurred some damage having stranded on hard rock. O c? Appendix 4 Political Resident in the Persian. Gulf to Assistant Resident, Bunder Ahhas. British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, March 1, 1905. I have the honour to reply to your letter of the 14th February, 1905, regarding salvage fees. I would first observe that the usual local custom is for the Nakhuda of a boat in distress to apply to the local authorities or people for assistance and to agree with them on the amount of salvage money. If the vessel is in serious danger, the persons rendering assistance claim half the value of the goods salved, a procedure sanctioned by local usage, but this residency has refused to recognise that they have any absolute right to demand such a share in the absence of aoreement with the Nakhuda of the vessel. Local customs in this matter, as in others, depend more on ' might than ' right, and efforts are always made to mulct the owners and Nakhodas of vessels as much as possible. Appendix 5. Sheikh Sagar-bin-Khaled-hin-Sidtan to Lieutenant-Colonel Cox. (Translation.) Shargah, 23rd Rahi I, 1329 {March 25, 1911). After compliments and enquiries after your health, I beg to address you in regard to your enquiry regarding the undermentioned three points connected with the Abu Musa case ; 1. You say that it is claimed that on the 12th Shaaban, 1316, after my return from the Hajj, Sheikh Salim granted to three persons an agreement for the extraction of mica from Bu Musa Island without any permission from ine, and you enquire from me that if I was aware of the same, how was it that I did not mention this agreement to you on the 19th Moharram, 1326, when I presented to you a statement of my relations with Sheikh Salim in regard to the Bu Musa Island. 2. You also mention to me the question of jetsam and flotsam on the Bu Musa Island, and state that it is claimed that Sheikh Salim was receiving the income on this account; and 3. You have also shown me the translation of a paper which is claimed to be dated the 4th Zilkhadeh, 1315, and to be the first draft of the oxide contract which was altered to another form on the 18th Zilkhadeh, 1315.39 This is my reply with regard to three points :— firstly, in regard to the mica agreement, I was fully aware of it, and Sheikh Salim consulted me [about it] and it would not have been possible that the said agreement could be issued without coming to my knowledge as ruling chief. But as I informed you two years ago, T had left to Sheikh Salim all the income which he could obtain from the aforesaid island, and consequently I did not trouble [myself] to object to this [agreement]. At the same time, when I presented to you the said statement regarding my relations with Sheikh Salim in respect of Bu Musa, the question of this mica contract did not occur to my mind at all, for, as you must be aware, the mica affair produced no result whatever. As regards the sum of 1,500 dollars, payable by instalments, to Sheikh Salim, I have no information as to how many instalments were received by Sheikh Salim. I did not trouble to make enquiries about the instalments, nor did I demand anything from Sheikh Salim on that account. It was my wish that he should get something from it, and that he should not trouble me about his expenses. Secondly, as regards the right to jetsam and flotsam on Bu Musa Island and all the Islands ot Kowasim, it is not open to doubt that it is due to the chief of the Kowasim, but the usual custom on the Oman coast is that the inhabitants of the place exact their rights on the scene of the wreck, and when the chief comes to know of it he settles the matter according to his own opinion ; sometimes he takes his own share from his subjects and sometimes he does not take from them. In the case of Bu Musa, as I had left all the revenue to Sheikh Salim, I treated my right of jetsam and flotsam as a part of the income to go to him and used to ask no questions about it. I hirdly, with regard to the rejected draft of the oxide agreement, I have now noted its wording, but had neither seen nor heard of it before. The reason for its rejection is obviously because Sheikh Salim could not write about Bu Musa in these terms, namely, 'So long as I, my children, and ray brothers live, no one is entitled to raise objection to it. No doubt this was the cause of the draft being changed. This is what was necessary to be stated, and salaams ! (L.S.) SAGAK-BIN-KHALED-BIN-SULTAN. Appendix 6. Form I.

I remember that I had been absent on duty at Bushire during the spring of the year in question, and it was on my return to Shar^ah that the project for an oxide concession was discussed. The draft had been drawn np by Abdullah-bin-Hassan Samieh, and it was he who showed it to me. At the same time he and Nakhoda Ali, who was also there, asked me to let my son Isa come into the concern as they needed some one on the spot at Shargah in order to keep in touch with Sheikhs Sagar and Salim. I agreed, but pointed out that the terms of the proposed concession as at present drafted were quite impossible, and that neither Sheikh Sagar would confirm it nor would the Government approve it. What I especially objected to was (1) the sentence in which Sheikh Salim is made to say : 'so long as I, my children, and my brothers live, no one will be entitled to raise objection to it, and (2) the inclusion of Nakhoda Ali as a signatory on the document. With regard to (1), T would explain that Salim was an old man of 70, who might be expected to die at any time, and I was taking into account the fact that it he died, we should thenceforth have to deal with Sheikh Sagar. As regards (2) I thought the inclusion of Nakhoda Ali was inexpedient, as I had just been visiting Bushire and knew him to be in very bad odour with the residency in connection with his Bushire affairs, and he was also at loggerheads with the well-known Muin-ut-Tujjar of Tehran, holder of the Hormuz concession, and 1 feared the latter would be likely to give ns trouble if he came to know that Nakhoda Ali was a partner in a rival oxide enterprise. I also omitted the twenty-year time limit, as 1 saw no obiect in inserting any fixed period of time. ABDUL LATIF-BIN-ABDURRAHMAN. March 25, 1911. Appendix 10. Note hy Khan Bahadur Abdal Latif on the reference to a Dispute heticeen Sheikhs Sagar and Salim regarding Sir Abu Nuair Island {made in his letter of the 27th Jamadi II, 1316 {November 14, 1808). Your honour enquires from me to what I referred in my letter dated the 27th Jamadi II, 1316, when I wrote the following sentence :— ' As regards Sir a dispute has arisen between Sheikhs Sagar and Salim. It is Sagar's intention to lease without mentioning Salim's name and to give some advantage to'Salim, but Salim would not agree to this.' The explanation of the above passage is as follows :— It will be remembered that in the second agreement between Sheikh Sagar and Sheikh Salim (dated 1884), at which my predecessor was the intermediary. Sheikh Sagar granted to Sheikh Salim an annual pension of 400 dollars together with the revenue of Sir Bu Nuair, which was expected to bring in some 200 dollars. Up to 1889, however, this island did not produce any revenue as was expected and consequently no mention was made of it in the third agreement dated the 5th Shaaban, 1306 (1889), and Sheikh Salim ceased to take any interest in it. When, however, it became probable that the island might produce some revenue as the result of the concession alluded to in my letter to Hassan Samieh now under reference. Sheikh Salim's interest was naturally revived and he wanted to claim the revenue under the obsolete agreement of 1884, which Sheikh Sagar was altogether unwilling to aoree to on the ground that under the last agreement (1889), which was now in force, the revenue of Sir Bu Nuair Island was not an item of the settlement. The sheikhs failed to come to an understanding on this point, with the result that the nroiect for the concession fell through. This is what had to be represented. r J 1 ABDUL LATIF-BIN-ABDUL EAHMAN.

[Here follows imaginary deed of lease in similar terms to that of which a translation is sriven in Annex 29 to Second German Memorandum, i Opinions of Clergy in reply to Question (A). 1. In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate. (L.S.) Reply. —And God is the guide to what is right. The lease will not be valid without proposal and acceptance by legal formula and without the specification of a fixed period. And God knows more. Written by Ibrahim-bin-Abdullah. {Note. —Chief Sunni Mullah of Bushire.) 2. In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. According to the question, this lease is null and void. Written by Mohamed Ali Al-i-Osfoor. (L.S.) Confident in God the Bounteous. His slave, Mohamed Ali-bin-Muhammad Taki. {Note. —Imam Juma, the official High Priest of Bushire.) 3. In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. Amongst the conditions for the validity of a lease are the specifications and record of the period of the lease. Supposing, for instance, he were to say, ' I have let the house at the rate of 1 toman per mensem,' such a lease is legally null and void, and it the lessee says a prayer in such a house the prayer will be. futile. And as to this question there is no difference of opinion between the distinguished ulemas, and God is aware of His precepts. Written by the humble Mohamed Ali-el-Moosevi-ed-Dehdasty-en-Nejafi. (L.S.) The hopeful Mohamed Ali-el-Moosevi. {Note. —The most venerable Shia Mullah in Bushire.) 4. It should be understood that the conditions for the validity of a lease are six, oy the absence of any of wdiich six conditions the lease is null and void. The first |js] the compact, i.e., the proposal and acceptance, intended to indicate the fact of the assumption of the profit for a fixed period in return for something specific. Secondly, the legality of the possession. Thirdly, the taking cognizance of the rent or the measure or weight or number. Fourthly, the specification of the profit by time or by [2294/—2] N4(3 the job. Fifthly, the retention of the profit in possession or its coming under that category [of possession]. Sixthly, the defining of the period of the lease in such a manner that it shall become neither less nor more. The subject-matter of the question [under reply], being void of certain of the conditions, namely, the compact and the period, and the cognizance of the amount of the profit, is not valid, and God is aware of the truth of affairs. Written b\ the humble Abdullah-el-Moosevi-el-Baladi. (L.S.) (Note. —The chief mullah of the Ussuli sect of Shias in Bushire.) 5. In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. The distinguished ulemas—may their blessings amongst the people endure—- have defined ' lease' to be the taking possession of an ascertained profit in return for something specific. So whatever is like giving possession of original property, for instance by selling it, is a thing extraneous to a compact of lease, and so is anything in which the profit is not defined, either in itself—such as by the act of sewing of a certain garment or the riding of a certain animal to a certain place—or by the fixing of a period such as a full year. And thus, as regards the subject of the question, whereas, it is not a case of taking possession of a profit, but of the original property and, whereas, the profit is not fixed by either of the two methods aforesaid, the lease is accordingly null and,void, on both counts, and it is obvious that while there is no contradiction in the said two rulings, it is recorded that the majority set store by the last. And God is aware of His Commands Written by this humble servant of the Shera, Murteza-fcl-Moosevi, Sadr-el-Islam. (L.S.) {Note. —Seyyid Murteza-el-Moosevi is the stipendiary ' Sadr-el-Islam,' of Bushire, much respected for his piety.) 6. Praise be to God. This lease as it is written is null and void and is not valid. The conditions for the lease, viz., the formula of proposal and acceptance and the stipulation of the time are not (made) therein. Further, if the mines are open they cannot be turned into property and the lease is not proper. This, and God the Highest knows more. Written by the humblest Muhammad Mehdi-bin-Abdullah. (L.S.)

How is it now that (several) conditions are omitted r The first is that a lease requires bond such as proposal and acceptance; and the second of the conditions thereof is that it should be for a known period. So this, which is written in the question, should be nullified for several reasons, and it cannot be valid in this condition which is stated. And God knows more. ABDUL KERIM-BIN-AHMED (Servant of the august law, at Keis, by his own hand).48 15. In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. Praise be to God, Who leads to the right. The said lease is invalid and illegal in several respects and does not contain all the conditions. The first of the reasons for its invalidity is that the period of the lease is unspecified. The second reason is that the formula of the lease has not been pronounced therein. The third reason is that, legally speaking, the right to any ground rent, in the manner mentioned in the question, is unknown (z.e., inadmissible) from all points of view. To take interest on unknown articles for an unknown period, and to compare it to rent is unlawful. In short, this lease, as quoted in the question, according to ' the following copy,' is not compatible with the precepts of the august Shera law. And God knows best.

Firstly, it becomes binding by a known period. Ihis has been omitted, however. Secondly, a lease becomes binding by proposal and acceptance. Should these conditions be absent, the lease is null and void, and when the lease is nullified it is for the lessor to take possession ot his property and to lease it to another; and God knows best.

(Signed and sealed) ABDUL KERIM (Servant of the Shera law at Keis). 9. The Answer. —Praise be to God, who leads to the right! This lease as it is mentioned in the question is not in accord with the precepts of the august Shera, and is null and void and invalid. So, the owner of the property has the option to return to his property, and he has the absolute possession thereof, and can use his property in any manner that he may wish. He has the option (to do so), and the lessee has no right or title in that property. And whatever is invalid according to the august Shera is to be considered as non-existent. Should the proprietor desire to turn out the lessee from that place he can do so, and there is nothing to bind the owner of the place. And God knows more !

As put to the Members of the Clergy. In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. To the learned ulemas and distinguished lawyers, may God multiply the like of them ! What do you say as regards a certain man who leased certain property to a certain party and did not stipulate a fixed period in the deed of lease, wherein also no legal formula was pronounced between them, and after some time the owner of the property cancelled the lease. Has the owner of the property the right of cancelling (it) and expelling Za'id, the lessee, from his property or not ? It is requested that you will explain the true position according to the precepts of the enlightened Shera, and be rewarded, your reward being with God.Answer Yes, the owner has the right to expel the lessee from his property because the said lease contains nothing binding according to the Shera. Immediately the owner cancels the lease, the lease becomes dissolved. Written by Shubbar-bin-Ali-el-Moosevi. (L .S.; {Note. —Seyyid Shubbar is the Shia Mnjtshid of Lingah.) Appendix 15.

I was anxious to put the work on a more business like footing, and therefore drew up some rules and sent them to Hassan. The latter made certain additions and had five documents drawn np including the additions and signed by himself, Abdullah, and Nakhoda Ali, and he forwarded them all to me for completion by the attachment of the signatures of Sheikh Sagar and myself. When completed 1 was to return three of them to him, one for himself, one for Abdullah, and one tor Aakhoda Ali. Of the remaining two I was to give one to Sheikh Sagar and keep one myself. 1 did not, however, care about the extra condition which he had inserted and wrote back and said so. 1 here the matter ended. These deeds were never completed nor were any revised documents drawn up. I never showed them to Sheikh Sagar, and produce them now in the state in which 1 received them. These rules never having become operative, Esa and I always considered and presumed that the document on which the concern was carried on was lhat of Zilhijjeh, 1315, in which Nakhoda Ali was admitted to partnership, and in which it is laid down that' the sale, loading, and shipping should be carried out with the knowledge of all the partners. By reason of Hassan's neglect to consult us properly, and his failure to render any accounts, we became dissatisfied with his conduct of affairs. Appendix 16. Translation of Deed admitting Mr. T. J.

It was Xakhoda Ali who lirst started the Abu Musa mining, Hassan Sameiyeh knew nothing about the oxide trade until Xakhoda Ali introduced him to it. The latter had at this time a very bad name with the local authorities and in commercial circles in the Gull ports, and so he found it convenient to work through Hassan Sameiyeh. After securing the Abu Musa concession the parties thought it would be to their advantage to bring me into it with a view to my arranging the shipments to Europe and elsewhere, and so I came into it. Nakhoda Ali was the moving spirit in the acquiring of the concession, Hassan Sameiyeh was only used as a screen. The former w r as in charge of the mining work and always complained greatly of the obstructiveness of Abdullah Sameiyeh and his father Hassan, and their ignorance of matters connected with the oxide trade. Owing, however, to his own state of bankruptcy Nakhoda Ali could not take a prominent part in the concern, and so Abdullah and Hassan gradually began to dominate it. Nakhoda Ah managed the work on the island, I was expected to manage the sales and shipment to Europe, and Hassan acted as corresponding member of the company. ' No particular basis of authority existed, so far as I know, on which Hassan was entuied tu act, and to the best oi my belief (and 1 have an excellent memory) I have never heard ol or seen the so-called memorandum of association which you have now shown me, much less did I ever sign it or receive a copy of it. ' Nor was I consulted at all or informed regarding the sale of a share in the concern by Sheikh ^agar to 'l usu[-bin-Abdullah, or by Yusuf to Hassan, or Hassan to Brown ; it is all news to me. ' In any case, Hassan Sameiyeh never acted according to the rules now shown to me. He has never rendered any accounts at all. In fact, the mismanagement of the feamei} ehs and the extravagance of Abdullah have always been a great cause of complaint both to me and Nakhoda Ali.' „ 7 . „ . T. J. MALCOLM. Buslnre, May 30, 1911.

Liny ah, bih Rajah, 1323 (September 5, 1905). In the most auspicious hour and the best time, your letter dated Jamadi II reached us and we noted it with pleasure, and what you had stated was duly understood by your friend. Especially as regards the long absence of news from me, I was in poor health. May God the Most High protect us against all the distempers and may you not see anything unpleasant. You have stated about the house that it should be under our supervision. It does not matter. I have already notified you that a discussion took place a few days ago between us and the German, who wishes to take about 500 tons oxide more or less, and we have settled with him for it. Coolies have been working for one and a : -half months now and if the remaining portion is cleared up, his steamer will come to ship. Our object is to carry on the business. I have arranged as he desired, and, God willing, if it went to Hamburg and was approved by them, they will ask for another consignment. Let it not be hidden from you that my son Abdullah has an intention to come at the end of September. He will come to Bombay to settle Salman's account with the Bania Jeita because the court will be closed nowadays for two months. When the court opens, he will appear in the court together with his antagonists before the auditor and will settle their account if God wishes. Now there remains but little work, and he will then come to our side. You know court affairs. A day means ten days (i .e., a day's work will take ten days) and no one can help it. But, God willing, patience is the key of relief. This is what was necessary (to be said), and please convey our compliments to Haji Muhammad Hussein and Abdullah-el-Mulla. On this side, all our friends send you greeting. And may you continue to remain preserved and guarded I Hassan-bin-Ali Samieh to Nejef-bin {late) Haji Nakhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh. (Translation.) Lingah, 8th Jamadi II, 1325 {July 19, 1907). In the most auspicious time your valued letters reached us, and we noted with pleasure that your health continues to be good; and what you have stated was duly understood by your friend. [Here a reference is made to the differences which existed at that time between Nejef and one Muhammad Ali in connection with the post of Hamal Bashi, landing contractor, at Bunder Abbas.] My son, Abdullah, was sent by us to the island, a few days ago, in the German steamer to ship oxide, and he has not returned up to now. He will, God willing, come to us this morning. The steamer shipped oxide and left. We have not yet settled with them the account of the cargo so that we may let you know how much has been shipped. The news of our side is tranquil, and there has been no report which should be communicated to you, except that all is well. Give my salaams to those who are with you. Hassan-bin-Ali Samieh to Nejef-bin (late) Haji Nakhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh. (Translation.) (After greeting.) 30th Safar, 1325 (April 14, 1907). In a most fortunate time I received your letter, dated the 25th Safar, and noted it with pleasure. I have understood what you have stated, especially as regards the receipt of our letter by you. This is satisfactory. As regards my son, Abdullah, it was firstly his intention to come by steam-ship ' Mohamedi ' ; but God did not will this. He will, if God pleases, arrive by the steamer ' Naseri,' which is due in three to four days, and he will certainly meet you at Bunder Abbas. You had stated that the German steamer visited the Bu Musa Island and shipped 1,000 tons. There had not been such a report with us, nor has any steamer visited the [2294 /—2] Pisland. Had any steamer visited there, how could I have omitted to write by letter to that effect? This news is false. You have also heard that the steamer 'Mohamedi' will arrive at Bu Musa. This has not become known, and no communication has been made with them {i.e., the agents of the company) regarding the arrival of the steamer. You had stated that you required Omani tobacco. Tobacco is absolutely unavailable at Lingah nowadays. It cannot be procured even at 6 rs. 8 a. per maund. God willing, I will send you [some] as soon as I obtain it. I have understood all about Abdul Mohsin. May God facilitate the affairs of the Moslems ! The news of our port is quiet, and nothing has transpired that may be mentioned to vou, except what is good. Please give my compliments to all those who are dear to you. May you remain preserved ! Hassan-hin-Ali Samieh to Nejef-bin {late) Ilaji Nakhoda AH Ahmed Saleli. (Translation.) (After greeting.) Tjincjali, \Qtli ZtlJiijjeJi, 1325 {JauudTy 21,190(S). I beo- to advise you that I could not leave home for a period of forty days as 1 was sick, and^hat I am, God willing, better nowadays. I have heard from Abbas Haji Ali Akbar that you had written to him requesting him to speak with this humble in regard to Bin Musa. Indeed I did not expect that such a message would come from you by anyone, before you come to me in person and receive the facts and go into the matters (i.e., learn the circumstances). Then you will come to know the account ; and every thino- with me is kept in proper order. And I consider you like a son and in the same position as my son Abdullah, and you know what friendship existed between us and your father, Haji Ali deceased, who did nothing except after consultation in our business. And you yourself have [nevertheless] forgotten his attitude towards us while we were hopeful that you will follow his footstep. What is certain to me is that you wdl not keep such things (i.e., such ideas) in your mind, and that you will persopally come to me and receive the facts of the matter from my own mouth, verbally, and it will become clear to you. And as regards the affairs of the island, they are pending up to now, and no settlement has as yet been made with the antagonist. I am on the same friendly terms with you as with your father, and it is my hope that your mind will not be annoyed with us. You are [however | of a hasty temper, and listen to the statements of jealous parties; [but] the matter should not be misunderstood by you. You are like a son in my estimation, owing to the friendship which I had with your father. In my opinion, you should come to us at Lingah for a week s time and, God willing, all will be well in our interview. This is what was to be stated, and may you ever remain preserved and guarded. My son Abdullah sends you salaams. {Note.—This letter is in the handwriting of Abdullnh-bin-Hassan Samieh.) Appendix 19. Hassan-hin-Ali Samieh to Nejef-hin (late) TIaji Nakhoda Ali Ahmed Saleh. (Translation.) Lingah, 22nd Shaaban, 1322 (November 1, 1904). I have sent you a letter by the last mail, enclosing a letter from my son Abdullah, and I hope that they have found you in good health. I have notified you that my son Abdullah hns arranged with David Sassoon for a compromise, and that they have demanded of him a power of attorney from you on behalf of your late father, Haji Nakhoda Ali, stating that you are his attorney, and that you constitute my son Abdullah as attorney on your behalf in Calcutta. My sou Abdullah has written a power in your name and forwarded it to you by registered post. God willing, you will, on receipt of the power, record your signature therein, and cause it to be sealed by the resident or by the assistant resident or anyone who represents the resident, and sealed by the director [of customs], testifying that my son Abdullah is attorney on your behalf. You should forward it to Calcutta soon, because they have delayed the documents of compromise until they receive the power from you.55 God willing, you will forward it to him and inform me of it. This is what was necessary, and please convey my compliments to Haji Mohammad Ali and all those who are with you, and may you continue to remain preserved and guarded. Abdullah-bin-Hassan Samieh to Nejef-bin (late) Haji Nakhoda All Ahmed Saleh. (Tran elation.') (Alter compliments.) Calcutta, 1st Shaaban, 1322 [October 11, 1904). It is now a long time that I have received no letters from you. Perhaps the cause which prevented it is good. I am always receiving letters from my father, Hassan, who gives me the news of your health. You should, God willing, inform me of your health and the news of your side by every mail. O my brother, 1 beg to advise you in connection with the dispute which was between us and Sassoon. We have settled with Sassoon, and it has been arranged that a compromise should be effected. And we have written papers oi compromise Por the settlement of the dispute. And whereas your father was one of the partners and he has now passed away, and whereas you are in his place and are his executor, it is necessary that you should give a power of attorney from yourself in my name so that I may affix in the documents your signature with the signatures of the partners which are [recorded] in the documents held by me in the case v. Sassoon, as Sassoon knows that Haji Ali has passed away, and that I, Abdullah, was his agent at Calcutta. Now, after Haji Ali's death, it is obvious that you are his executor, and it is necessary that you should write a power of attorney for me [saying] that I am your agent in Calcutta in all the affairs which may occur in Calcutta, as I was before in the affairs of your father. For this purpose I have now written a power of attorney in English in accordance with the law which will be accepted by the court; it is a power of attorney from you in my name. There is also an affidavit testifying that you are Nejef-bin-Haji Ali, his executor and attorney, and that you are now in his place. This certificate, together with the power, should be taken by yourself to the British resident or assistant resident at Bunder Abbas, and you should, in his presence, admit that you are the son of Haji Ali, and are in your father's place, and that you have made this power in the name of Abdullah-bin-Hassan, who is to be your agent in Calcutta, as he was before in the lifetime of Haji Ali. Also the resident or the assistant resident should certify in the affidavit that you are Haji Ali's son and his representative. You should also take a writing from the Belgian director of customs that you are Haji Ali's son and his representative, and obtain another certificate from the postmaster and expedite sending them to me by registered post soon and without delay, and write on the cover my address in English as follows :— A. H, H. Samieh and Co., 34/1, College Street, Calcutta. You should not delay the power and the documents, but send them to me at an .early date. I have also advised my father, Hassan, who will also let you know and urge upon you. I know that at the moment of their arrival you will expedite sending them on. 1 have written you by this post, and I now intend going to the solicitors, so that I may write the power and the affidavit and send them to you by registered post. I need not urge you further that you should expedite doing what I have advised you. This is what was necessary. The letter was written most hastily. Your humblest friend, ABDULLAH-BIN-H ASS A JN SAMIEH. P.S. (in red ink).—I was unable to send the power by this mail as it was not prepared. God willing, I shall send it to you by the next mail. Let this be known to you, I shall send it by registered post by the next mail. V B 115G Abdullah-hin-Hassan Samieli to Nejef-bin-Nakhoda All Ahmed Saleh. n (Translation.) ^ ^ Calcutta, 1st Shaaban, 1322 (October 11, 1904). After compliments and enquiries after your health. I have this day written you a letter by post and enlightened you therein of what was necessary to be stated. God willing it will find you in good health. I have informed you especially that a settlement has been made between us and David Sassoon by compromise and reconciliation. And let it not be hidden from you that owing to the fact that Ilaji Ali has passed away, there is need for a power from you so that I may sign for you in the papers appertaining to the compromise, because, in the beginning there was in our hand a power from your father, Haji Ali, [stating] that I was his agent in Calcutta, and after your father's death I informed [them] that you were in your father's place ; and the court demanded that you should write a power for me setting forth that you are the attorney and executor of the will of your father, and also that I am agent in Calcutta on your behalf in the Safcsoon case, and for the oxide, &amp;c., and the power should be [written] in English in accordance with ^ the law, because Haji Ali has passed away and it is necessary that the court should understand that Haji Ali has no son beside you. Therefore, in order to settle the affairs I have written in your name a special power in the case of oxide and our dispute with Sassoon [saying] that what we now arrange with Sassoon for settlement by compromise is agreed upon by you. I intended sending the power by registered post by this mail but it was not ready. This is for your information, and, God willing, it will reach you by registered post next mail. You should act upon the instructions which I will now explain to you :— When you receive the power, you should take it to the resident or British vice- consul and assistant resident at Bunder Abbas. He will read it over to you and you should admit before him that this power is from you to me and that I am your agent in Calcutta in the same way as in the days of your father, and affix your signature—Nejef- bin-Ali-Ahmed-Saleh—in the place which is marked in pencil, then the resident or vice- consul will record his testimony and seal it with the Government seal. You should forward it soon and avoid procrastination and delay and you should send it to me by registered post to Calcutta soon and without delay. On the same day when it reaches you, you should take it to the resident or the assistant who is now present at Bunder Abbas. I have written you this letter by this mail so that you may know that you will receive the power by registered post. I am sending you this letter in my father's letter and have forwarded another letter to you by post. Surely I will write you by the next mail also with the power. Your letters to me should continue without interruption as before when Haji Ali continuously kept me informed of the situation and of the reports. This is what was necessary to be said at present. God willing, I will settle matters after the receipt of the power and proceed to your side in Shavval. This is what had to be stated, and may you remain preserved and generous. Your friend, ABDULLAH-BIN-HASSAN SAMIEH. Appendix 20. Mr. T. J. Malcolm to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Bushire, December 24, 1907. I hear Abdullah-bin-Samieh and Mirza Hussein of the German consulate when in Bunder Abbas lately, approached Nejef, the son of the late Nakhoda Ali and one of the partners in the Abu Musa affair in order to obtain a declaration to the effect that he, Nejef, was and is still agreeable to the continuation of the contract concluded between Samieh and Mr. Wonckhaus. I am further told that Nejef had declined to give Samieh the required declaration.I fill nil • MHiTiTtl 1 0 57 ArPENDix 21. Affidavit of Nejef-bin-Nakhoda Ali, dated March 19, 1910. Nejef-bin-Haji Nakhoda Ali states on solemn affirmation :— T solemnly declare the following to be the facts regarding my interviews with Mr. Thomas Brown, of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co., and, if necessary, I am prepared to confirm this statement by oath on the Koran before a mujtehed. I have had several conversations about the Abu Musa case with parties interested. The first was when Abdullah-bin-Hassan Samieh came to see me accompanied by Mirza Hussein ' Germani.' They came to Bunder Abbas and stayed in the house of Haji Amin-ut Tujjar. Abdullah, on landing from the ship, came to my house and asked me to come over and have a talk about the matter at Haji Amin's house. I went over to Haji Amin's house, and there Mirza Hussein, Abdullah, and Haji Ali 'Germani' were present. Abdullah asked me to give him a paper stating that I handed over my share of the concession on Abu Musa to Abdullah-bin-ITassan. The paper was to be given a date prior to the date oF the contract between Messrs, Wonckhaus and Hassan. He also asked me to give him another paper saying that I was quite satisfied with the contract. 1 refused, saying that I would not do anything of the sort unless they settled up my account with David Sassoon, that is, my father's, on account of oxide, carpets, &amp;c. I said if they did not give me back the carpets they should pay me 20,000 rupees and settle my account, and then I would give them the paper. However, they did not give me the money, and I mentioned the matter to the British consulate. These two persons came to Bunder Abbas not long after the British consul. Lieutenant Gabriel, returned there from a trip he made to Shargah, &amp;c. Some months later Mr, Brown came to Bunder Abbas. The exact date can be ascertained from the consul, Bunder Abbas, as I reported the matter to him at the time, but it was just about two years a^o, Mr, Brown had two interviews with me, once at the house of Jamshidian's agent and once at the custom-house. At the first interview Agha Ghulam Ali Khorassani was present, at the second Mr. Moses Khan, the customs director. Agha Ghulam Ali is agent of Messrs, Wonckhaus and Co, Mr. Brown had a long talk with me. Before beginning to talk about Abu Musa he dismissed two Hindoos, Gulshan and Asanand Ghulab, Mr. Brown asked me why I had not signed the paper shown me by Abdullah and Mirza Hussein. I said there appeared to be no advantage for me in doing so, and therefore I hadn't. Mr. Brown said he had bought the share in the oxide company belonging to Sheikh Sagar for 250 reals. I replied that Sheikh Sagar had never made anything out of the business, and so would sell cheap. Mr. Brown said he wanted to buy my share, and said that he would settle up all my accounts with Hassan- bin-Ali and Abdullah. I never offered to sell my share to Mr. Brown. In fact, as I reported to the consulate at the time, Mr. Brown offered to buy my share. I would swear to this on the Koran. This took place in the presence of Agha Ghulam Ali Khorassani. At the second interview, and after Mr. Moses Khan tried to persuade me to go to Lingah to settle with Mr. Brown, he continued to endeavour to make me do this for a long time, and, on my refusing, he got annoyed with me, and worried me to such an extent that I finally had to resign my post as Hamal Bashi at Bunder Abbas.

Lingah, 24:th Zdhedah, 1322 {January 30, 190')). I have read your letter of the 12th instant (19th January, 1905) with pleasure, and understood its contents. During my interview with you we held a conversation aboub the visit to Abu Musa Island of Wonckhaus, the German, and you said you heard it was in connection with the lease of that island, and you warned me not to let him approach me. Please note that the fact is this as I informed you, that Wonckhaus visited the island merely to inspect the oxide, saying that if he approved (the oxide) he would perhaps com municate with me with regard to the price, and would probably buy some. This was his object. You should not think that I would fail to let you know if he communi cated with me on the subject which you indicate. AVe could not allow this sort of interference from any one, especially on the part of these persons. You may rest assured. On seeing the oxide he approved that from one of the mines and returned to Lingah, and says that he will perhaps buy 300 tons if he obtains reasonable rates of freight. ' He left for Bushire some time ago, and has opened a branch there for the transaction of business. Hassan Samieh to Abdul Latif. (After compliments.) TjingaTi, 12th Jumadi I, 1324 {July 5, 1906). Your esteemed letter, dated Rabi ul Thani, reached me in due course, and I understood what you said. In particular regarding the receipt by you of my letter and your comprehension of its purport with reference to our transaction with the German. Insh Allah it will turn out well. You told me to take care that he did not get any bond from me (which would enable him) to enter the island. Set your mind69 at rest, I, your brother, am knowledgable and well versed in matters of business, and am far from acting in such a way as you indicate. He has not the presumption to make overtures to me in that direction. For, just as I told yon, he is only a purchaser of the oxide itself, nothing more. Whether it be he or someone else, whoever wants to buy the oxide from me, if the price suits me I shall sell it. Do not let any idea beyond this enter your head. You may rest assured. (Letter goes on to speak of other matters.) Appendix 24. The Bev. S. M. Zwemer to Lieutenant-Colonel Cox. Bahrein, May 29, 1911. With reference to the meaning of the Arabic sentence and the probable intention of the writer in using those words concerning which point you asked my opinion, I take pleasure in replying as follows :— First, it is evident that whoever wrote the sentence was not a thorough scholar in Arabic, as he confused the masculine and feminine forms in the last word of the sentence. To my mind the obvious translation of the phrase is, ' the annulment of this .agreement is better than its acceptance.' I do not think it is at all obvious or possible to translate the sentence ' the annulment of this agreement is better than to comply with (his wishes).' This translation is, to my mind, a forced one, and not the natural significance of the words in question, whatever be their connection. I am confirmed in this opinion after consulting with one or two Arabs concerning the popular use of the pronoun in such a sentence, and I find that they agree with me that there is a great looseness in the use of the feminine or masculine pronoun at the -close of a clause or sentence. I am sure that nine out of ten Arabs would give the preference to the former translation of the sentence as the obvious and natural intention of the writer. Although my opinion does not carry weight beyond that of others who have a speaking and reading knowledge of Arabic, yet I feel confident that in this case it is not a matter of expert grammatical opinion, but of everyday usage in the Persian Gulf, and I have no hesitation in saying that the first translation is the right one. Appendix 25. Note hij Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif on the meaning of the doubtful passage in his Letter to Hassan Samieh, dated 8th Zilhejjeh, 1324 (January 23, 1907). I beg to refer to the sentence in my letter dated 8th Zilhijjeh, 1324 (23rd January, 1907), which runs as follows :— and about the meaning of which there have been arguments. I beg to say that my meaning when 1 wrote the sentence was :— (' The annulment of this agreement is better than the acceptance of this agreement.') # ^ i It is not hidden from your Honour that I received my education in the Gulf, and that I am not an expert in the niceties of grammar and the shades of meaning of various measures of words. When I write f I write according to the usages and under- fitanding of the community in which I live.60 As regards the use of the measure JlkjJLJ, as synonymous with Jlk^, the use is quite an ordinary one in these parts, and I can mention many other instances of the same, such as ('reposing'), ('continuance'), &lt; (^being ruined ), ('advancing ), &lt;Loliu^ ('remaining'). There is no idea of a ' desire to ' here. Again, you will note that in the letter from my son Isa, dated 7th Moharram, 1325 (20th February, 1907), to Sheikh Sagar occurs the sentence:— (' Va atlub min jenabekum almosaadeh fi naqz va istebtal-i-hazehel varaqah.') (' And 1 beg your Honour for assistance in the breaking up and annulling of this document.') This shows that the words and were used synonymously. Furthermore, when writing to me on the 23rd Moharram with reference to my letter to him (dated 8th Zilhejjeh, 1324) enjoining on him the ^Uull JlkuL.-! . ut isu ) Hassan used the same form of words as I had, thus :— ' YoU P articularl y wrote about deed of contract which I executed with VV onckhaus, the German, for the sale of oxide from Abu Musa Island. I understood what you said, namely, that your son Isa was not agreeable to the execution of a docu ment of this purport for the reason that I had not consulted you and that it was necessary that the partners should not enter [into transaction] without the knowledge of the other partners ; that this humble one had entered into this transaction without consultation, and that Isa feared that complications would result owing to the admittance of foreigners [into the concern], and lla. JlkjJU.' (' ihe annulment of this contract is better than its acceptance.') Again, mwiiting to me on 15th Safar, 1325 (30th March, 1907), Hassan suggested that 1 had better, if I thought fit, write to the German myself and explain to him regarding the annulment of the contract. His precise words were :— It will be seen that he here used and not jJUukjywsl. It is clear therefore that Hassan understood me fully in the sense I intended to convey. Secondly, the explanation of the use of the spelling is as follows in my opinion :— ' ' J It is rendering into writing of a colloquial construction of speech. Thus, m conversation, if referring to a masculine object, such as 'zaid,' I should not say but leaving out the 'zamah' after the 'h,' but substi tuting the s&lt; zamah ' for ' kasrah' after the 't.' Similarly, if I were referring to a feminine object I should not say l^jLcULLJ, but £jUl£iLj, substituting the ' kasrah' after the 't' for the feminine pronoun 'ha.' Likewise, in writing a colloquial letter 1 should render the above sounds into writing. The word or is constantly used, in my parlance, in reference to a thing in the sense of It is also evident from Hassan Samieh's reply above quoted that he uses it in this sense :— t-r* ('Better than its acceptance,' i .e., better than the acceptance of the contract.) The pronoun is used in the feminine, and could only refer to the contract ABDUL L ATIF-BIN-ABD URR AH MA N. . March 23, 1911.61 ArrENDix 2G. Letter from Hassan Samieh to Ahdul Latlf. (After compliments.) _ 23rcZ Moharrum, 1325 (March 8, i907). ^ our letter dated Zilhijjeh 1324 reached me in due course, and I was glad to receive it and understand its contents. You particularly wrote about the deed of contract which I executed with Wonckhaus, the German, for the sale of oxide from Abu Musa Island. You said that your son Esa did not agree to the execution of document of such a nature, and complained that I did not consult you, although it was necessary that no partner entered into transactions without the knowledge of the other partners ; that I had so entered into transactions without consultation ; and that, as Esa feared that complications would result owing to the entry of foreigners into the matter, the nullification of the contract was better than its acceptance. I under stood it all. Oh ! my brother, at the time I executed the deed of agreement I communicated to you the details of it, copied in Arabic alongside the English without addition or omissioi^, and you came to know of it and approved it, and wrote to me in reply that it was all right. Similarly you asked me for a copy of the deed, and I sent it you, and you acknowledged its receipt and approved of it. It is now a matter of eight months. How can I cancel it ? You, by the grace of God, are a wise man, and if you suggest complications. Kemember, the German has no connection with the leasehold of the mines; he has ^ no concern except to take from us the oxide itself, nothing further, for a stated period. There is no harm in this. The object is to effect sales and the stuft be sold whether to him or to any one else. You are aware that he took some from us last year, and we saw nothing objectionable in his deal with us; and, as you know, we have spent a considerable sum of money in expenses in this connection. If we do not sell the stuff how are we to get back our own ? Please God, the matter will end satisfactorily ! Salaams to Esa and the brothers. Appendix 27.

As your honour is aware, the document of lease was drawn up in the names of three persons, namely, your humble servant Esa-bin- Abdul Latif, Haji Hassan-bin-Ali Samaiyeh, and Abdulla-bin-Hassan Samaiyeh. I have come to know that on the 1st June, 1906 (8th Kabi-ul-Thani, 1324), the said Haji Hassan entered into a contract with a European merchant named Wonckhaus, without consulting me, and that according to the terms of the document he bound him self and his partners in giving an absolute monopoly for the extraction of the red oxide for a period of four years. And the said Haji Hassan executed this agreement and bound himself without consulting me previous to the drawing of the deed of contract. The details of the said deed have only now reached me, and I do not agree to the terms of this contract. Accordingly I forward to your honour a copy of the deed of contract for you to examine ; kindly look into it. I beg from your honour assistance in taking the necessary steps for the cancellation and annulment of this contract, for I am altogether unwilling to agree to this lease. Previous to this I have written to Haji Hassan Samaiyeh expressing my disagreement to this contract, but he has sent me no answer. Finally, I am obliged to call your attention to the deed of contract, the beginning of which is as follows :— ' Contract between Haji Hassan-bin-Ali Samaiyeh, of Lingah, owner and holder of the Abu Musa Concession, and M. Robert Wonckhaus, of Lingah.' [2294/-2] RNow Haji Hassan Samaiyeh has no deed of authority from me giving him any general power in regard to action which he might take respecting the lease, &amp;c ; how then has Haji Hassan the right thus to mention himself only, without consulting or referring to his partners, of whom I am one ? ^ 1 am in consequence obliged to make a complaint on the subject to your honour, and it is tor your honour to issue orders. Appendix 28. Statement of Gulum Hassan. Gulum Hassan states on solemn affirmation :— I have been living on Abu Musa as caretaker of gardens and flocks for the last twelve or fifteen years. &lt; p i i cn -i i q ' The following are the circumstances under which shots were nred by bheikn hagar s guards in connection with the arrival of Abdalla -bin-Hassan Samayieh in a boom (pattern of native craft) from Lingah. The vessel arrived about noon and.dropped anchor off the spot where the oxide is shipped from about S00 yards to the westward of the heaps on the seashore. A jolly-boat full of people put off from her after she had anchored, and came towards the shore. „ 1 Q , At this time there were only ten or fifteen men present out of bheikh bagars guard ; the rest were over at the village. Some of those present were now on the seashore in front of the oxide heaps and some above them on the rocks at the side. Those on shore shouted to the people in the boat not to approach, but as she came on one or two shots were fired from the rocks near the big oxide heap, ihey were not fired at the boat or dhow but in the air. The German was in the boat, and at the time one Haji Ali, whom I understand to be the German's clerk, was standing up in the bows of the boat ready to jump off as the boat neared the shore, but I myself called out to him, ' Don t attempt to land, as there is no permission for it. ' I heard no answer, ihen the guards on the slioie called out, ' If you want to ask or see anything send a man ashore, he can see and go back. Two negroes, whose names I do not know, then jumped into the watei and s^am ashore. They only remained a few minutes. They were led up to the huts where Sheikh Abdulla-bin-Ahmed - bin-Sultan was—he was in charge of the guard from Shargah—and they asked him what was the position of affairs and why had the shots been fired. He replied, ' We are ordered not to let anyone land ; if you don't like it go and get permission from Sheikh Sagar.' f hey then returned to the boat and the boat to the boom. _ . i i • i i As the dhow did not show any signs of departing the guard feared she might be intending to stay till dark and try and effect a landing, so about 4 p.m . they began shouting to the dhow, warning her to be off. At this time there were waves and some surf. Soon afterwards, I being in the huts at the lime, I heard three or four shots fired by our men, but I did not see what at. The dhow then, I believe, moved from her place and went farther round to the right, but I did not see any more of her myself. Dated Abu Musa, February 17, 1908. Statement of Mattur-hin-SJiamhan. Mattur-bin-Shamhan states on solemn affirmation ;— I was one of the guard which Sheikh Sagar sent over to Abu Musa and was present on the occasion when shots were fired in connection with the presence there of a dhow from Lingah. The dhow arrived about noon and anchored opposite the oxide heaps on the shore. The guards who had gone over from Shargah were about eighty in all. Of these about thirty were present at the oxide heaps when the boom arrived. After she had anchored a rowing-boat put from her containing about ten persons. As they got near we recognised Abdalla-bin-Samayieh and a native clerk of the Germans, w T ho was known by sight to some of us. I did not notice the German himself.63 When we saw Abdalla some of us called out, ' Don't come near, don't come near, Abdalla,' He merely answered by calling out and gesticulating to his boatmen to row harder. We shouted, 'We will fire at you if you attempt to approach.' Abdalla then said to his rowers, ' Don't mind what they say, they will not shoot.' We repeated that we would fire. He replied, ' Fire away.' We then fired four shots in the air over their heads. I did not fire myself. We should have fired straight at them had not Sheikh Abdalla-bin-Ahmed, who was in charge of us, given us orders (which he sent through me) to fire in the air. On our firing they turned back a little and called out to us, ' What is this all about ?' We replied, ' If you want to get news, send two men ashore. On that they sent two negroes (one named Salim), who jumped into the water and swam ashore. They said, ' Why do you stop us from coming ashore, seeing that the island belongs to the German and Hassin-bin-Samayieh ?' We replied, 'The island belongs to Sheikh Sagar.' The negroes said that Abdalla-bin-Hassan had not told the German that, and from what they said it appeared that they had brought him, the German, on false pretences. After this conversation we told them they must return to the boom ; and we warned them that if the boom did not depart before sundown we should have to fire on her. They then went off to her. The boom did not move, however, and we feared that after nightfall she might endeavour to make a landing. Accordingly Abdulla-bin-Hamed told three of the guard to go to the cliff and fire some shots. They, however, fired six shots above the boom. It was not intended that they should fire at the boom ; as a matter of fact, I did hear one shot strike her, or strike something other than the water. The man who fired that shot was Abdurrahim-bin-Saif, of the Holi tribe, who let off his rifle before getting it to his shoulder. After this the boom weighed anchor and got off just at sunset, but they only moved a little way and anchored again opposite the mud enclosure farther up. Four of us then went along the shore parallel and stayed there until three hours after sunset (about 9 p.m .). Then seeing that they were apparently intending to pass the night there, our men fired two more shots in the air above the dhow. She then took her departure. Our object was to frighten the visitors away. Dated Shargah, 21st February, 1908. or'j / I 7 f y [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] [B] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [December 6.] Section 1. [46753] No. 1. Sir Edward Grey to Count Metternich. Your Excellency, Foreign Office, Deeemher 0, 1911. I HAVE the honour to refer you to my note of the 6th December, forwarding a memorandum advancing arguments in reply to your communication of the 4th December, 1909, on the subject of the claim of Messrs Wonckhaus in connection with the shipment of red oxide from Abu Musa. I am confident that the German Government will not fail to appreciate the cogency of the considerations urged in this memorandum in support of the attitude assumed by His Majesty's Government throughout the discussion of this question. That attitude is, in their opinion, completely justified by the facts elicited in the course of the further investigations which have been carried out since the receipt of your Excellency's communication above referred to. They have, however, no desire to protract a discussion which has already lasted about four years, and thus still further to prolong the interruption which an important commercial enterprise has already suffered. His Majesty's Government have been animated from the first by a desire to approach this subject in the friendliest manner, and it is in conformity with the spirit which they have wished to display throughout that they desire to suggest to the German Government that a compromise should be reached on the following lines :— 1. His Majesty's Government, recognising the desire of Messrs. Wonckhaus for some compensation on account of the interruption of their business as a result of the inability of Hassan Samaiya to carry out his contract with them, are willing to facilitate the attainment of that object. They would accordingly suggest that the firm should be asked to submit, through the German Government, a statement of their claim under this head. As to the amount of the losses so incurred. His Majesty's Government have so far received no precise informatic s though some light is thrown on the subject by the facts mentioned in paragraph 5 of my note of the •22nd August, 1910. 2. Recognising further the desire of the firm to be restored as far as possible to the commercial position which they occupied at the moment when their operations were interrupted. His Majesty's Government w r ill use their influence with the Sheikh of Shargah to procure from him the grant of a new concession to suitable persons to continue the working of the mines, and will endeavour to arrange that the contract of the 1st June, 1906, should be allowed to run for a further period equal to that during which it was interrupted. That period was from the 10th October, 1907, to the 1st June, 1910. The contract might, for example, run from the 1st May next to the 31st December, 1914. If Messrs. Wonckhaus are reinstated in their contract as here proposed, the only losses sustained by them under head (1) would appear to be those due to the delay in receiving their profits on account of the interruption of the working of the mines. It should be explained that in spite of any clause contained in the present contract, the parties shall not be bound, after its expiration, to conclude any new agreement. 3. Maintaining in the fullest manner the point of view which they have already expressed that the Sheikh of Shargah, as an absolute Sovereign, acted within his rights in cancelling the concession, His Majesty's Government must insist on the principle that neither they themselves nor the Sheikh can be considered to have incurred any liability for the losses suffered by Messrs. Wonckhaus, whose claim lies solely against Hassan Samaiya. His Majesty's Government undertake, however, to use their best endeavours to ensure that the firm should receive such sum in compensation as may finallv be fixed. His Majesty's Government have every confidence that the good intentions which have prompted this offer will be appreciated by the Gferman Government, and that they will see their way to co-operate in the satisfactory settlement of this protracted controversy by recommending to the firm concerned the acceptance of the proposed compromise.

The head of the tri&gt;e is Fashir 'bin Rashid. They consist of 21 families, as per list of names enclosed, and have all decided to leave Sirri.

They are a 'branch of the Jawasim trihe ; their forefathers orig inal ly lived at Ahu Dhahi, from v/here they moved to Layya in the Shargah district, and from their to Rirri a'bout a hundred years or more. They are pearlers and own seven 'boats. Questioned as to their reason for leaving Sirri they stated th^ were subjects of the Trucial coast and de sired to live under the protection of Sharjah, and to en joy the protection extended to Trucial subjects by the British Government. They said they were not indebted to any one and they did not leave Sirri on account of an3 r blood-feud or other disagreement or discontent. It was ascertained that the real reason of their migra tion is that some of the heads of the tribe are indebted to certain merchants at lingeh, and last year three of them were imprisoned here.

There beems to he no objection to the trihe, who are Trucial subjects, settling at Ahu Musa, hut their debts must be paid as soon as possible or I will be constantly worried by the local authorities, and if any one of them come here on business more difficulty may arise.

Although your' honour ha^^ been repeatedly advised that in addition to the other fla^ at the village you should keep a fla^ for hoisting on the ria^staff* at the place of oxide loading when any ship approaches, yet I noticed that no Tla^ was hoisted while the 'Lawrence' \as present, ^nd, on enq-iiry, I was informed that there was only one fla^ on the island ^nd that was at the village.

Recognizing the face of one of them, I fountf. it was the man Qhulam who was caretaker before and wuom, owing to his proceedings, you were strongly advised not to retain upon the island. On my asking Gnu lam what lie was doing he said 'I am here on be- nalf of Sheikh Sg^ar'! On looking at the old papers on the file I am surprised to see that you have allowed Ghulam to return, and strongly advise you not to allow him to remain, or return there at all, until tue current dispute with the oxide concessionaires is finisned. I hope it will not be lon^ now before this protracted dispute is settled, but meanwhile you must not mind a little trouble, and must not cease to maintain the utmost circumspection regarding affairs on the island, and keep there some person upon whom you can absolutely rely for the safe-guarding of your interests.
