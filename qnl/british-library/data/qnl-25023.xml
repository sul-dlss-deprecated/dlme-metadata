A similar question has now been raised by Mr. K. K. Moorhead, Consul for the United States of America in Rangoon. Mr. Moorhead states that the American Government is compelled to pay taxes on the Consulate in the sofaer building, Rangoon, although thin is contrary to International Law and to the customs of Germany, France and most European and Asiatic countries as well as all of North and South America'. He quotes 'Regulations relating to Immunities of Consuls' as adopted by the 'Institute of International Law' in its session of September 26th, 1896. 3. The Lieutenant Governor will be glad to be informed, with reference to paragraph 2 of your letter of the 4th 1886 to the Government of Bengal, whether any treaty stipulation exists between this country and the United States of America which binds His Majesty's Government to S^ant most favoured terms to American Consuls in His 'ajesty's dominions, and whether in case such stipulation exists Mr.' Moorhead is entitled to claim exemption from local taxation. . j -'ave, etc., ft- 'Olv&amp;yr-ftsSfu.,FOREIGN OFFICE, arch I. 1905.

I am directed by 'the ?ferquess of LanBdovvne to transmit to you, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India In Council, a copy of a note from the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador requesting that Con sular Officers of Austria-Hungary In India may be • exempted from payment of taxes. In view of the Im munity In this respect accorded to British Consular Officers In Austria-Hungary. I am to refer to the correspondence which took place in May and June last year, when a similar claim was put forward by the German Consul General at Cal cutta, and particularly to the letter from this De- sed that it would be undesirable to admit the claim. In the present case there Is the difference that by the Treaty of December 5th, 1876 (Article l) bet- The Under Secretary of State, India Office. weenbetween the United Kingdom and Austria-Hungary most favoured nation treatment is accorded to subjects of either of the Contracting States within the dom inions of the other. His Lordship observed from the enclosure to your letter of the 20th May last that a claim put forward by the Austro-Hungarian Consul General at Calcutta in March 1903 for exemption from municipal taxation, was disallowed by the Government of India in accordance with the decision communicated by this Department to the India Office on February 20th, 1386 in the case of the French Consul General at Calcutta. I am to state that, in Lord Lansdowne*s opinion, the considerations which arose in the case of the German Consul General last year appear to apply equally in the.present Instance. His Lordship would therefore propose to reply to Count Mensdorff t that His Majesty's Government regret that in the absence of a Consular Convention between this coun try(7 country and Austria-Hungary the claim le not one which they are able to entertain. His Lordship would, however, be glad to be fav oured with Mr. Brodrick's views in the matter. I am. Sir, Your most obedient, humble .Servant,Translation. r BELGRAVE SQUARE. January 21st, 1905. My Lord Marquess As I understand from a report furnished by the Imperial and Royal Consulate General at Calcutta, the Municipal Office (License Department) there ap pears to have claimed for some years from the members of ihe said Consulate-General the payment of taxes for carriages, horses and bicycles. Before approaching Your Excellency with re gard to this matter, I wished to make certain what procedure was observed towards British Consular Offi cers in Austria and Hungary in this respect. The Im perial and Royal Government to whom I addressed an en quiry in this connection has now supplied me with the necessary facts in this question from which I quote textually the following passage which particularly bears on the -procedure followed:- As far as specially concerns the instances which at present occur in practice, amongst the Royal Tne Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., &amp; c ., &amp;c., &amp;c . , BritishBritish Consular Functionaries in the Kingdoms and countries represented in the Reichsrath only Consul Harry Lionel Churchill and Pro-Consul Nikolaus Sal- vari, both in Trieste, come into consideration, for these two functionaires only are Consuls by profes sion, the others being, honorary Consuls. The two Consular Functionaries mentioned are dealt with according to the said §154 line 3, the former being completely Exempt from Personal Income Tax and the latter paying it only in respect of. those sources v/hich are connected with these Coun tries, as is laid down in §153, line 2, letter b. •Rentensteuer* is likewise not imposed on them. They were also not subjected by the Magistrate of Trieste to payment of the tax assessed on the house rent. From the above it is therefore clear that Brit ish Consuls by profession in Austria (1) Are wholly or partially exempt from •Per sonal Income Tax - and wholly exempt from •Renten steuer•Rentensteuer*. (2) are not subjected by the Magistrate of the chief town of the country in which they reside (Tri este) to payment of the tax assessed on the house rent. In Hungary the said officers are entitled to the following privileges in the matter of taxes:- 1. According to the Article of the Law XXIX: 18§b, Point IX/a they pay no tax on earnings in respect of their official services. 2. If the foreigners in question are not Hun garian Subjects, they are, according to Article XXII: 1875 §2, Points 2 and 3, exempted from the tax on the interest on their capital and the 'Rentensteuer'. 3. According to Article XXIII: 1883 52, point a/ they pay no shooting tax and, in the event of their desiring to engage in shooting, they receive free shooting permits. 4. According to the existing practice they are exempted from that liability, which is imposed upon the Employer.in 511 of Article XXIX: 1875 in respectof 'the tax on earnings' 1st Class which is levied on servants. Since from the above and particularly from the circumstance of the exemption from payment of the tax assessed on house-rent a certain reciprocity can be deduced, I have no hesitation in bringing forward the claim of the Imperial and Royal Consu late General and, claiming the kind, intervention of Your Excellency, I have the honour to request that our Consular Functionaries in India when they are subjects of the Imperial and Royal Monarchy may be exempted from the contributions levied by the state or by municipal bodies as well as from the direct taxes on real and movable property and on luxuries. From the Consular report mentioned at the com mencement I understand that the Municipal Office in Calcutta has stated to the Imperial and Royal Con sulate General that Diplomats alone are entitled to the exemption from taxes claimed. On this point I take the liberty to remark that in other lands also (for example France and Italy) Consular Officersare exempted from taxes on carriages and horses, with out an immunity equal to that enjoyed by Diplomats be ing granted them. In conclusion I have the honour to point out that the climate and the great distances in the Indian States render the keeping of a carriage and a horse necessary and that the already mentioned municipal dues seem to be very high. I take tne liberty to ask Your Excellency to in form me of the decision arrived at by the Royal Brit ish Government in regard to this matter and have &amp;c., (Signed) Alb. Mensdorff.I &gt;' 2 ii directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ul timo relating to a claim fcy the German Consul General at Calcutta to exemption from municipal taxes. I am to unclose, for the confidential information of Ivir . oecretary Brodrick, a copy of a Memorandum fur nished by the Commercial Attache to His Majesty's Em bassy at Berlin in March 1903 with regard to the rights and immunities of Foreign Consular Officers in une German Empire. It will be observed from this Memorandum that, in the absence of reciprocal treat ment abroad, - and most States have Consular Conven tions with Germany in which provision is expressly made for such reciprocity, - Foreign Consular Officers are not deemed to be exempt from the payment of direct taxes, either bo the State or Commune. As German Consuls in this country are not exempted from taxa tion, except in so far as regards Income Tax on their etary of State, officialofficial salaries, His Majesty's Government would have no grounds for claiming exemption for His Majesty's Consular Officers in Germany from other categories of taxation^whatever may be the actual practice at cer tain places, and this apparently varies to some extent. Biu, it is clear that if an exception were made in the case of Count Quadt, the Consular Officers of all Powers with whom this Country has most favoured nation Treaties would claim similar exemption, if the fact came oo their knowledge, as it probably would. In these circumstances, Lord Lansdowne is of opinion that it would be undesirable for the Govern- ment of India to admit the claim for exemption put forward by the German Consul General.

The Imperial Government do not consider Consular officers to be Diplomatic Agents. They neither claim Diplomatic privileges for German Consuls abroad, nor do they accord them to foreign Consular officers resident in the German Empire. The only place in which Consuls are specifically included amongst Diplomats is in § 8 of the Law of the 8th November, 1867, on the “ Organization of German Consulates” (under the North German Confederation, now an Imperial Law); and it merely says that German Consular officers are treated as Diplomatic officials with regard to their liability to dismissal, retirement, and pensions. The wording is: “ Diplomatic Agents, including Consuls, can be put on the retired lists on receiving the pension to which they are entitled.” There is, moreover, a sort of declaration to be found in the statement of “ Motifs ” (“ Motiven ”) to the draft “ Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz ” of the 29th October, 1874, which says that Consuls are not Diplomatic persons. It will be remembered that that Law was drafted in order to form the basis of the later uniform Laws for the new Empire in legal matters which were to replace the former separate Laws for each State. The above- mentioned Law was finally dated the 27th January, 1877 (its latest published text is dated the 20th May, 1898), and it is now in force. These “Motifs,” however, are not published with it; but, as they are important to show the differentiation in treatment of Diplomatic and Consular Agents in Germany, they are given below in so far as they affect those officials, after a translation of §§ 18 to 20 of the “ Gerichtsverfassunsgesetz ” itself.Translation of a portion of the “ Gcrichtsverfassungsgesetz” (Section II). § 18 “ German jurisdiction does not extend to the Chiefs and Members of the Missions accredited in the German Empire. If these persons are subjects of a Federated State, then they are only freed from German jurisdiction in so far as the State, to which they belong, has divested itself of the right of jurisdiction over them. The Chiefs and Members of the Missions, accredited to a Federated State, are freed from the jurisdiction of that State. § 19. The provisions above-mentioned are applicable to the members of the families and to the staffs of the persons mentioned in § 18, and also to such of their employees (‘ Bedienteste ’) who are not Germans. § 20. ‘ The Regulations as to the exclusive right of jurisdiction, in matters affecting landed pioperty (‘mortgages,’ &amp;,c.) in civil suits, are not barred bv the provisions of §§ 18 and 19. § 21. “ 1 he Consuls placed in the German Empire are subject to German jurisdic tion, unless in J reaties with the German Empire there are stipulations as to their being exempted from German jurisdiction.” Translations of Extracts from the “Motifs” to the Draft Law. As to §§ 18/o 21 (§§ G to 9 in Draft Law). “ The jurisdiction of the German Courts extends to all persons residing in the German Empire, without distinction as to whether they belong to the State in which the Court is taking proceedings, to a Federated State, or to a foreign country. The only exceptions are made on the ground of internationally recognized principles, or by the Constitu tion of the Empire. “ That all persons with diplomatic character are entitled to the privilege of ex territoriality is internationally laid down.” As to § 18 (§ 6 in Draft Law). “ According to the views of teachers of international law, Diplomatic persons who are permanently subjects of the State to which they are accredited are only exempt from jurisdiction in so far as that State has divested itself of it. In relations with the German Empire, the fact of being a subject of the Empire must be decisive; this is clearly brought out by the second part of § 18 (§ 6 in Draft Law).” (Note .—There was, at the time, a concrete case, inasmuch as a Prussian subject was accredited to the German Empire as a Minister Resident of an American Republic.) “ Under the Constitution of the Empire, the Governments of the Federated States are not deprived of the right to themselves to receive Ministers of foreign Powers nor of accrediting Ministers to the Courts of any Federated State.” As to § 19 (§ 7 in Draft Law). “ That the members of the families and the staff of the Ministers are entitled to the privileges of exterritoriality is laid down by international law. The same is the rule also for such persons as are in the private employment of the Chief or Members of a Mission. 1 he extent of this exterritoriality and the conditions of its being granted are, however, not universally laid down. “ The Draft Law maintains the right of exterritoriality as a general principle, and lays down a limitation in that the exemption is not recognized in the case of the persons concerned being German people. “The expression ‘.Bedienteste’ is chosen in order to include, besides actual servants, such persons as teachers, stewards, and other persons employed by Ministers.”8 /*N As to § 20 (§ 8 in Draft Law). “ The effect of the phrase, that Diplomatic persons, &amp;c., are not subject to German jurisdiction, is not only that they cannot be proceeded against in Germany without their consent, but also that summonses are to he served on them in the same wav as those issuing abroad, and that their forced attendance as witnesses to give information is not to be enforced.^ ^ As to § 21 (§ 9 in Draft Law). “ Tim provisions of § 9, that these Consuls, whether ‘ de carriere Consuls * (‘Berufskonsuln ’) or ‘ trading Consuls * (‘ Wahlkonsuln ’), as a matter of principle (‘ Im Prinzip’), are not recognized as Diplomatic persons, unless special provisions affecting them are contained in Treaties, is universally recognized.” 1 As there is no uniform recognized practice amongst nations as to the rights and privileges of Consular Representatives, their nature and extent has usually been made the subjecrof Treaty stipulations by the German Government. Indeed, such provisions date back to the early part of the 19th century, and are contained in Treaties of some of the former independent German States. The North German Confederation in 1868 began to obtain certain rights of this kind for its Consuls in the Treaty with Italy of the 21st December (afterwards an Imperial Treaty), rights that were further extended in 1871. In later years, during the existence of the present Empire, from 1871 to 1903, many special Consular Conventions have followed ; and other important provisions, as to the appointment and conseuuent rights of Consuls, are to be found in other geneia! Fieaties with foreign States, as well as in some containing most-favoured-nation rights. These Treaties contain two kinds of provisions: on the one hand, they lay down exactly what privileges and exemptions German Consuls have in foreign countries, and, of course, vice versd those that foreign Consular officers enjoy in Geimanv, as regards their persons, archives, residences, and offices ; and, on the other hand, they define the character of the official dutie® which they can. be properly called upon to undertake there. In countries with which the German Empire has concluded no Consular Conventions, German Consuls can only claim those privileges and immunities which are generally granted there by custom to foreign Consular officers, and, pro contra, foreign Consuls can only claim similar recognition in Germany. With regard to the nature of the rights and privileges granted^ to Consuls, a distinc tion is usually made between “Consules Missi ” and “Consoles Electi,” as is shown in various German Consular Conventions. In connection with this point it is to be observed that in such Treaties great stress is laid on the nationality of Consular officers, whether they are subjects of the States they represent or not. this often mateiially affects their situation. As regards the Consular Corps, the former are defined as persons sent abroad bv the State appointing them, or, in exceptional cases, where they have already been living at the places of their official residence they are considered as having been sent to that place (see Kbnig’s Book). The latter are defined as Consuls whom the foreign State appoints from among the merchants or other suitable persons found at the place where the Consulate is situated. . „ . ^ ^ . Though ordinarily “Consules Missi” and “Electi” in Prussia seem to be treated alike, the^German Government, it will be remembered (see Sir F. Lascelles’ despatch No. 14, Treaty, of the 2nd May, 1903), holds, in the case of Prussia, that they have a ri'ht to treat them differently in practice. On this subject 1 would draw attention to Annexes Nos. 1 to 4 to this Report, which consist of brief statements from three British Consular officers in Prussia, showing the practice at Berlin, Stettin, and Dantzig, and of another from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General at Hamburg, where it is clearly shown that in practice— , (a.) No difference is, as a rule, made between “Consules Missi and Consules ^ GC (6.) British Consular officers, “ de carri&amp;re ” in particular, are at a distinct disadvantage, both officially and privately, as compared with their “ de carriere ” colleagues, on account of the British Government having no definite Treaty stipulations with the German Government as to their rights and immunities.At Stettin, however, a distinction as to (a) appears to be made, as u Consoles Missi ’ are sometimes invited to ceremonies to which “Consoles Electi ” are not. The difference made between the two categories of Consular officers is very marked at Hambuig, where Consoles Missi ” are treated in a semi-diplomatic manner in certain respects. It will be remembered, however, that the foreign Great Poweis used to have Diplomatic Ministers accredited to that State (such as the Russian Government still has there, as well as the Kingdom of Prussia); for a long time past they have only had Consols-General (except Russia). It is for this reason, no doubt, that the State of Hamburg accords the British Consul-General and some others special favours (see Sir TV. Ward’s Memorandum, Annex No. 4). It will also be seen in those statements that in the Kingdom of Prussia foreign Consular officials appear to be treated in much the same way as the foreign Consular Corps is tieatcd in Gieat Biitain, seeing that at the capital, Berlin, they are not invited to anv great public functions or festivities (even municipal ones), while in the Provinces, at towns like Stettin and Dantzig, they are so invited. J he special cases of certain British Consular officers that have occurred in recent years in Prussia with regard to their rights and immunities are mentioned in Part IV. Part II. 'I he Rights of Foreign Consular Officers in Germany, 1 here is no general body of Laws, or even of Regulations, issued by the Imperial Government dealing with the position and immunities of foreign Consuls in the German empire, whether “ de carriere ” or not (?.e., whether “Consuls Missi” or “Electi”). The rights, therefore, of the foreign Consular officers resident in Germany are deter mined by:— . J (a.) Any provisions existing in general Imperial Laws. (&amp;.) Special stipulations in German Treaties. (c.) Local Laws or Regulations of the Federated States. (d.) General custom. As to (a). Provisions under Imperial Laws. The law dealing with the quartering of troops, &amp;c., of the 25th June, 1868, in § 4 (latter part of No. 1), provides that, subject to the prerequisition of reciprocity, the dwellings of the “Consuls de Carri&amp;re ” (“ Berufskonsuln ”), who are subjects of the Powers they represent, and who carry on no business and possess no landed property in- the place of their residence, are freed from having soldiers, &amp;c., billeted upon them. (J\ote. I he same law exempts all dwellings of foreign Envoys, and also of their staffs, from such services.) Under § 21 of the “ Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz ” of the 27th January, 1877 (a law providing for uniform legislation in the German Empire), it is particularly stated that Consuls in Germany are subject to German laws (jurisdiction) unless there are special stipulations to the contrary existing in Treaties with foreign Powers as to their being freed therefrom. Finally, a Decision of the Bundesrath of the 28th May, 1883, provides that emblems (coats of arms, flags, wafers, &amp;c\, but not official forms, cases for papers, ledgers, Sic.) that are sent to foreign Consular Representatives in Germany, for the purpose of representing their Governments, are exempted from import duty. These are the only provisions, under Imperial Laws or Bundesrath Decisions, affecting the position of foreign Consuls in the German Empire. As to (b). Provisions under Treaty Arrangements. 1. Great Britain. Seeing that the British Government at the present time (June 1903) have neither a Consular Convention nor a General T reaty of any kind with the Imperial Government, it is extremely doubtful whether they could properly claim for their Consular officers any ot the rights and privileges extended under special Treaties and Consular Conventions to [774] ^ 1)10 other foreign Consular Representatives in the German Empire, merely by virtue of the temporary general most-favoured-nation treatment voluntarily accorded to Great Britain, her Colonies (with, of course, the exception of Canada) and Possessions, under a special Imperial Law, ad hoc, and subsequent Decision of the Bundesrath, which concession, moreover, only continues to the 31st December next. As regards, moreover, any particular claim that might be put forward for any such rights and immunities on behalf of British officials in the territories of the Kingdom of ^ Prussia, such action would appear to be still more doubtful of a successful issue on account of the distinct proviso existing in Prussia that, in default of Treaty stipulations to the contrary, any concessions made in that direction to foreign Consular officers depend entirely on a like reciprocity being granted abroad by the respective Governments of those officials (see p. 11, “ Provisions under Local Laws”). What Local Laws or Regulations may be in force in the other Federated States of ihe Empire bearing upon this subject, I do not know; but it would be interesting to ascertain exactly what they are. It. would appear, however, that, with few exceptions, there are not many Laws or Regulations published in the other German Federated Countries. Where they exist, however, they are believed, as a rule, to grant foreign Consular officers much the same rights and immunities as those accorded by the Prussian Government; but, in some cases, they are said to be far more extensive. 2. Other Foreign States. In the German Treaties with most other foreign States the position and immunities of Consular officers are laid down in exact terms both for the Consular Representatives of the German Empire abroad and for the foreign Consuls in Germany. A list of the existing German Consular Conventions and other Treaties with foreign countries, containing provisions affecting Consular Representatives in Germany and abroad, will be found in Annex 5. Consular privileges and immunities are, as a rule, only accorded to the Consuls them selves. It is only exceptionally that they are extended, in the case of “ Consuls de Carri&amp;re,” to their families and employees. In the Consular Convention with Russia the “ Chancelliers ” and “ Secretaries ” of Consuls and Consuls-General—if they are German or Russian subjects, and are not engaged in business or any industry—are freed from the quartering of troops, &amp;c., and military obligations, and also from paying direct taxes. Other extensive privileges and exemptions are also granted them. In some foreign countries, when “ Chancelliers ” or ‘‘Secretaries” are in charge of Consulates (on account of the absence or death of the Consul), they obtain, during such tenure of office, the same privileges and exemptions as their chiefs are entitled to. Such provisions are to be found in many German Consular Conventions. In the Consular Conventions with Italy and Spain, freedom from arrest for the smaller offences is granted to “ Consuls de Carridre.” In the Treaties with Greece, Japan, Russia, Servia, and the United States, Consular officers—who are subjects of those States, and who are not subjects of the countries in which their official duties lie—are entitled to certain immunities for their persons. In some of the above-mentioned countries, “ Consules Electi ” can also enjoy the benefits of this more extended freedom from arrest, if they are not subjects of the countries in which they reside. Apart from the questions of arrest and of civil and the smaller penal offences, German Consuls of all kinds (including “ Consules Missi ”) are not exempted from being subject to local jurisdiction abroad, and they have no rights of exterritoriality ; and this practice, of course, conversely holds good for foreign Consular officers in the German Empire, when there are no special Treaty stipulations to the contrary. The Treaties with Japan, Greece, Russia, and Servia contain provisions that the Local Courts in each country—in the case of foreign Consuls being required as witnesses by them—shall send these Consular Representatives a written request to attend the proceedings, instead of issuing the usual summons to appear (accompanied by the warning as to the penalties of non-attendance). In the case of foreign Consuls not being able to so attend, it is provided that their evidence can be taken in their houses, or their written evidence accepted. In some Treaties the generally recognized inviolability of the Consular archives is extended to the office rooms and dwellings of the “Consules Missi,” in which case the local authorities can only enter them in case of some crime having been committed.Note. It has been the invariable practice, as shown by repeated decisions of the Imperial Foreign Office, that German “ Consules Electi who are subjects of the country in which they reside, and who are, therefore, not exempted from paying income tax theie have no claim to be freed from taxes falling upon their income obtained from their Consular employment, unless such exemption is specially laid down by Treaty. The same procedure would consequently, as a matter of course, be applied by the German Government to foreign “Consules Electi in Germany, unless any special provisions should exist in Treaties, or under the local income tax laws of each Federated State, expressly granting more favourable terms to such officials. As to (c). Provisions under Local Laws, Sfc. 1. General. Failing special provisions on the subject of the rights and immunities of foreign Consular officers (either under Imperial Laws or Treaties with foreign Lowers), the local Laws or Regulations of each separate German State settle the conditions on which they are accorded. Prussia only is dealt with here ; the conditions obtaining in the other States are unknown to me. Their position and privileges depend entirely on the prerequisite of reciprocity in each Consular Representative’s country as regards all concessions made by the Prussian 'Government to him while residing officially in that kingdom. The rights—personal and otherwise—accorded to foreign Consuls in Prussia are laid down in an Annex to the former “ General Prussian Instructions ” ( &lt;c Dienst-Instruktion which thus describes them :— “As regards personal immunities, foreign Consular officials, who are not German; subjects, and who do not acquire real estate in Prussia, are exempted from personal services and direct taxes, both to the State and Municipality (‘Kommune’), and from having x soldiers quartered upon them, on the^express condition, however, that a like recip rocity in ' such matters is granted abroad, and that they keep strictly to their Consular work, and do not engage in any business, nor occupy themselves in any industry. “ Freedom from indirect taxes is not accorded them ; neither are they entitled, on arrival in Prussia, to any exemption from import duties, except as regards the travelling effects—a privilege granted to all persons equally. “ In the case of such foreign Consuls entering upon any business or industry, or acquiring real estate in the Kingdom of Prussia, the above-mentioned taxes and services can be exacted from them. “ On the other hand, the personal immunities of foreign Consular officers, chosen from among German subjects residing in Prussia, merely consist in the right to tree them selves from personal services to the State and Municipality ( c Kommune ), with the exception, however, of military service, either by furnishing substitutes or by paying certain compensation. When soldiers are quartered upon them, the room required tor official Consular work and for the storing of the archives is not to be encroached upon. But in all other respects the position of German subjects taking up foreign Consular duties is not altered ; this especially refers also to general military service. Consequently, such German subjects as are liable to actual service in the standing army cannot in any case be allowed to accept posts as foreign Consular officers. If the military service of a German subject chosen for foreign Consular work is confined to his position in the reserve or ‘ Landwehr,’ the Prussian Government will grant him an exequatur, it there be no other considerations to be taken into account, on the express condition, however, that such further military services shall be fulfilled. The permission to accept the post of foreign Consul does not exempt Germans from service as a juryman. A man cannot be a Judgp in a Commercial Court and at the same time be a foreign Consular officer. “ With regard to the liability of Consular officers in Prussia to local jurisdiction in affairs other than military, &amp;c., service questions, the following points are to be noted :— “In civil cases and in the case ot (?) optional jurisdiction (‘Fur Sac hen der freiwilligen Gerichtsbarkeit’), foreign Consular officers in the kingdom of Prussia are subject generally to the German Law Courts without distinction of person, whether they are Prussian subjects or not. In the latter case, they are treated like all other foieigners who have a settled place of residence in the kingdom. It makes no difference wheihci the subject of the law suit has been brought about in Prussia or abroad, nor whether thecreditor is a Prussian or a foreign subject. The Prussian Government, however, recognize the former validity of the jurisdiction of the foreign Civil tribunal, in the case of a foreign subject w ho has taken up a Consular appointment in Prussia, so long as recourse can be had to it without injury to the Prussian rights of jurisdiction. A double personal liability to jurisdiction can consequently be established, in which case the creditor can choose either the one or the other. “ In criminal suits, on the contrary, the rule is that such foreign Consular officers ^ who are not Prussian subjects are exempted from Prussian jurisdiction if they are not ^ engaged in trade or any industry, and do not possess any landed property. Consequently, a criminal, coming within this category, wmuld be handed over to that Government in whose Consular service he w r as employed for trial and punishment.* This exemption would not, however, extend to such deeds punishable under penal law, and which directly injure State rights in the Kingdom of Prussia. Similarly, it would not extend to cases in which, in the interests of public order and security, it becomes necessary to bring the offender promptly to justice. &lt;c Consular officers, being Prussian subjects, are generally (including penal offences) entirely subject to Prussian jurisdiction. The liability to such jurisdiction in criminal matters also affects such foreign subjects whose occupations in Prussia are not confined strictly to Consular work. “With reference to the arrest of foreign Consular officers, it is in itself permissible to take such a step on the express understanding that subsequent legal proof ol the validity of such action shall be forthcoming, irrespective of whether the Consular official is a foreign or a Prussian subject. This can take place whether the offence be a crime or the outcome of a private affair—such as occurs in the case of arrest for debt—that gives rise to the arrest, but with the proviso that, when such a case arises, the foreign Government is to be notified in order that they may take the steps to provide for some one else carrying on the work of Consular representation. A similar communication is also considered as necessary, even where no arrest is made, as soon as ever a criminal action is about to be brought against a Consular officer in Prussia. “Moreover, the special consideration (indulgence) granted to foreigners of certain rank, as generally prescribed by the Prussian laws, principally with regard to personal arrest in civil cases, would also be applicable to a ‘ Consul Missus. Beyond this protection in cases of arrest, the foreign Consular officers in Prussia cannot, either in criminal or civil matters, avoid complying with the forms laid down for general application, so long as they are subject to German jurisdiction.” As to (d). Provisions under Local Custom. The question of the rights and privileges granted to foreign Consular officers by general custom (see p. 9) is not dealt with here, except in so iar as mentioned in Part I and as illustrated by the Annexes Nos. 1 to 4. 2 . The Case of British Consular Officers. The position of British Consular officers in Prussia, it pushed to its extreme limits at the present time, is, apparently, limited strictly by the extent to which any of the above- mentioned (Part II (C), page 11) privileges, accorded by the Prussian Government, are ovanted to foreign Consular Representatives in the United Kingdom. How far they are so granted I am unable to judge, but it would be most useful to the British Embassy in Berlin to have some official statement from the Foreign Office on this point, in order that His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador should, in the future, be in a position to determine bow far he could properlv support claims of this nature put forward by British Consular officers, should other cases arise on points other than that of exemption from income tax, as recently raised by Mr. Bernal and Mr. Oppenbeimer (His Majesty’s Consular officers at Stettin and Frankfort respectively). In view of this extremely unsatisfactory position in Prussia at the present time, it seems to be more than ever important that a Treaty of some description should soon be * This provision, however, appears to have been superseded by § 21 of the later “ Gerichtsverfassungs- gesetz” of the German Empire (see page 9), which provides that Consular Officers residing in its territories are subject to German jurisdiction, unless there exist in Treaties special stipulations freeing them therefrom.K 13 negotiated with the German Government, in which the rights and immunities of British Consular officers in the whole ol the German Empire should be clearly defined, either separately in a Consular Convention or embodied in a general Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation. In the Kingdom of Prussia the liability of foreign Consular officers to pay income tax is laid down in section 3 of the Prussian Income Tax Law of the 24th June, 1891. It is there stated that, included among the persons freed from its payment, are (see Head IV) ‘‘those persons who, by international custom, or under special Agreements with other States, are entitled to exemption from income tax.” (This includes “ Consules Missi ” of foreign Powers, but not Prussian subjects acting as foreign Consuls, “Consules Electi/’ nor the staff of “ Consules Missi.”) I hat paragraph goes on to say that this exemption does not extend to any taxable income derived from the Prussian State, landed property situate in Prussia, or commercial and industrial undertakings. Moreover, it is in no case permissible to grant the exemption where a like reciprocity is not accorded in foreign countries. 1 he Dutch “ de carri&amp;re ” Consular officers are all (including Vice-Consuls) exempted in Prussia (later, in the whole German Empire), under Article 13 of the Dutch-German Consular Convention, of the 16th June, 1856, with Prussia (extended to all Germany on the 11th January, 1872), so long as they are not Prussian subjects. This frees them from paying income tax, both to the State and Commune* (“ Staat-und Gemeinde Einkom- mensteuer ’). 1 he Concession is granted for so long as similar freedom from taxation is granted to corresponding officials of the German Empire in the Netherlands and in Dutch Colonies. It is to be noticed that, in this Prussian Income Tax Law (see Head III of section 3), foreign Diplomatic Representatives, accredited to the Emperor-King, and their staffs, as w'ell as the foreign servants in the employ of both, are freed from paying the tax. Another Prussian law, the “ Erganzungssteuergesetz ” (Additional Taxation Law) I of the 14th July, 1893, must be mentioned here, as it was passed in order to enable heavier I taxes to be placed on income derived from “ property,” with the direct object of Supple-1 menting the Prussian Income Tax Law of 1891. It covers all movable and immovable I property, and falls upon invested and working capital. This law (in section 3) exempts from its operation the same persons as are mentioned l in section 3 of the Prussian Income Tax Law of 1891 ; but it appears that, under a \ decision of the Prussian Ministry of Finance, the lower Dutch Consular officials are not considered as exempted therefrom by virtue of the Consular Convention with the Netherlands. In this law r emphasis is again laid on the prerequisition of reciprocity, without which - the exemptions mentioned will not be granted. therefore, liable to payment of income tax on their office allowances, and they are subject ' * The latter are purely Municipal taxes, but are based, as a matter of convenience,-on the State income tax. Part III.— Liability of Foreign Consular Officers to pay Income Tax in Prussia. {a.) General. (6.) The Case of British Consular Officers. The position of British Consular Representatives with regard to exemption of income tax may be thus briefly stated :— Seeing that reciprocity is the essential preliminary condition of exemption in both the Prussian Income Tax Laws of 1891 and 1893, and in view of the fact that in the United Kingdom foreign Consular officers enjoy no exemption in matters of taxation other fhan that of freedom from income tax on their official salaries, such British Representatives as are “ Consules Missi ” (i.e., those at Stettin and Dantzig) can claim, on the ground of reciprocity, exemption from those laws as regards their official salaries only. They are, [774] E -f V7'' 1111 •■flIISPWi 1 14 both to State and Municipal taxation in Prussia as regards all other sources of income whatever. In connection with this question, it must be pointed out that in every Prussian town the local Municipal taxes are based on the amount of the State income tax They are so much per cent, on the total so paid to the Prussian State, and vary greatly in amount ' Be r lln J; 1 ' 6 ? , are i 00 P er cent, &gt;' Stettin 130 per cent., of the amount so paid! ^ It foreign Consular officers are exempted from Prussian income tax, it does not follow that ^ they could claim freedom from these essentially town taxes, unless a similar kind of exemption is allowed in Great Britain, which is not apparently the case. The local town taxes, therefore (mentioned by Mr. Bernal in his despatch No. L Treaty, of the Joth March last, to Lord Lansdowne), would appear to be payable in any event under the present circu in stances, seeing that they are purely town taxes, which are merely, as a matter of convenient practice, fixed as to their amount at so much per cent on whatever the amount of the Prussian income tax may be. These taxes are officially known as the ‘ Gemeindeeinkommensteuer ” (Communal or Parish income tax) Its name might lead to some misapprehension as to its nature. It is a form of taxation based upon the Prussian income tax, but it is in reality merely a form of consolidated Municipal tax. It varies from year to year according to the financial necessities of each Prussian town in each financial year. From its misleading name, there might appear to be ground to claim exemption from it for such persons as are exempted from Prussian State income tax ; but when its purely municipal character is considered, anv claim to exemption appears to be out of the question. * 1 Part IV. The various cases that have occurred in recent years in Prussia, as regards the rights and immunities of British Consular officers, have been fully reported upon to the Foreign Office at the time of their occurrence. It is not, therefore, necessary to include them here.

THE foreign Consular Officers at Dantzig who are salaried and not allowed to trade are— 1. The Russian Consul-General. 2. The British Consul. 3. The French Consul. 4. The Swedish and Norwegian Consul. The Spanish Consulate, formerly held by a Consul in the Consular career, is now reduced to a trading Vice-Consul. _ _ The Russian has an official residence, and as he is, like all Russian officials, oi the rank ot Colonel, a Privy Councillor in his own country, he takes the title of “ Staatsrat,” which in Germany carries with it the rank of Excellency. On this account he is looked upon by the authorities as much superior in rank to an ordinary Consul. He and the frenchman are protected by Consulai Conventions from any attempt on the part of the authorities either to extract taxes from them or to molest them in any other way. The Swedish and Norwegian Consul was formerly a merchant at Dantzig in a small way. On that account his position is not a very exalted one. Important public ceremonies and entertainments at Dantzig are very few in number—-at intervals of years. Generally it may be said that the provincial and the town authorities invite the foreign Consuls as such. The Government officials, the military and the naval officers only ask the Consuls in their private capacity, when they have made their acquaintance, and seldom call on them as the Representatives of foreign nations. Launches by the Emperor and other German Princes are from Schichau s yard. Xs e never give the firm an order, so they never ask the British Consul. The Russian is always asked. His Government employs Schichau’s firm. Prussian officials, as a rule, are conceited, that they have little time to acquire the ways of the world. To a man they can speak nothing but German, and dislike foreigners in a similar way to the Chinese. They make little difference between Consuls of the profession and their trading colleagues; if anything, they prefer the latter, because they are Germans. The position of British Consul in Germany is always an insecure one, as he has only his personal exertions to thank for any position he may occupy in the society ot the place he lives in. His more fortunate colleagues are protected by Consular Conventions, and are not called upon to enter into unseemly disputes with local revenue officers and other municipal authorities. (Signed) U. T. C. HUNT. Dantzig, June 16, 1903. Annex 4. Foreign Consular Representatives at Hamburg. FOREIGN Consular Representatives at Hamburg, in so far as they do not enjoy exemption in this particular respect in consequence of Consular Conventions, are amenable to the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the State of Hamburg and of the Empire of Germany. They are, if “ Consules Missi,” exempt from having soldiers quartered upon them, but not if merchant Consuls. They are (in accordance, in most cases, with special agreements) entitled to the assistance ot the Hamburg police authorities in the apprehension of seamen deserters, and they enjoy the assis tance of the police authorities in maintaining the Consular authority over insubordinate seamen of their own country. Foreign Consular Representatives at Hamburg are permitted (and, in fact, requested)—- though there may be no Treaty stipulations to such effect—to deal with the estates of deceased subjects of their own country dying intestate at Hamburg or on Hamburg ships. Foreign Consular Representatives at Hamburg, whether “Consules Missi or merchant j Consuls, are not exempt from payment of indirect taxes; but “ Consules Missi (Consuls- General, Consuls, Vice-Consuls, and Consular Assistants) are exempt from direct taxation, and, in particular, from payment of income tax levied at Hamburg. 1 his exemption fs provided tor by section 2, paragraph 5, of the Hamburg Income Tax Law, which runs as follows : “ From payment of income tax are exempt all those subjects of other States who have a I &lt;‘laim to such exemption in consequence of the official position occupied by them.■ ■ I ■ /“N 17 Ami in a note to this section 2, paragraph 5, it is observed:— “ Payment of income tax shall not be required of foreign Ministers (Envoys), or the members of their staff of ‘ Consules Missi,’ and of the members of the Consulate staffs, provided that they are subjects of the foreign State in question.” In respect of taxation, merchant Consuls residing at Hamburg are treated upon the same footing as all other resident merchants. Ihe Senate of Hamburg, as the sovereign authority of this State, in its corporate capacity, ail( l fhe President of the Senate (or Burgomaster, as is his official title), in his individual capacity, exercise a good deal of hospitality, both of an official and semi-official character, which generally takes the form of dinners, luncheons, or evening receptions. To these festivities the foreign Consular Ivepresentatives, both merchant Consuls and “ Consules Missi ’ (as well as the two Diplomatic Representatives accredited to the Hamburg Senate--viz., the Prussian Envoy Extraordinary and the Russian Minister Resident), are invited from time to time—that is to say, sometimes all the Consular Representatives, and sometimes only a certain number of the same, are invited. On the German Emperor’s birthday, for instance, when a large official banquet is given by the Senate, all “Consules Missi,” both Consuls-General, Consuls, and Vice-Consuls are invited, but no merchant Consuls. At a luncheon recently given by the Senate to the Grand Duke of Oldenburg, only “Consules Missi (i.e., only Consuls-General) representing European States were invited, but not the other “ Consules Missi,” and no merchant Consuls at all. On the occasion of an evening reception, recently given by the Hamburg Senate to the exhibitors and others connected with the Hamburg Exhibition of Hygienic Milk Supply, all Consular Representatives at Hamburg— “ Consules Missi ” and merchant Consuls—were invited. The President of the Senate (Burgomaster) invites the Diplomatic or Consular Represen- tives, i.e., only “ Consules Missi,” together with other persons, to dinner ad his private house once or twice a-year. In short, the Senate in its corporate capacity, as well as the President of the Senate indi vidually, consider themselves the sole judges as to whether all foreign Consular Represen tatives at Hamburg, or whether merely the “Consules Missi ” (or only a part of their number), shall be invited on a particular occasion or not.

Sir, Simla, the 21st April 1904, We have the honour to forward, for the information and orders of Lelter from Ihe topcrml German Consni-General His Majesty’s Government, a CODY of ft at Calcutta, J. No. 4«9-II, dated the 2nd March Wf™. IwL, • TTT ° , 1904 , with enclosures. letter irom the Imperial German Consul- Letter to the Imperial German Consul-General at General at Calcutta, and of our rp-nlv Calcutta, No. 1118 I.-B., dated the 18thMarch 1904. t,- i • UU1 r «P J y o thereto, regarding his claim to exemption from the payment of Municipal taxes. ^ . Count Quadt contends that he is entitled to such exemption because a similar privilege is accorded to British Consuls in Germany. To validate this argument it seems necessary to show that reciprocal treatment is extended also to Bntish Consular Officers in German dependencies and colonies, but on this point we have no information. It has, however, been referred by Count * Letter from the Imperial German Consul at Quadt to the German Government as will Calcutta, No. J. 679, dated the 15th April 1904. be geen from the of ^ correspondence which we enclose. 3. In 1886 Lord Rosebery’s Government rejected a similar claim Political despatch, No. 19, dated the nth March preferred by the French Consul-General ’ . ^ at Calcutta. The reasons given were first, that Foreign Consuls are not entitled to the exemptions and immunities granted to members of the diplomatic body; second, that no special treaty stipulation exists which requires the grant of most favoured treatment to French Consuls; and third, that British Consuls in France are denied exemptions which are granted to the Consuls of other Foreign States. In March 1903 exception to the payment of municipal taxes was taken also by the Austro-Hungarian Consul-General at Calcutta on the ground that by treaty “ the officers of his country’s diplomatic service are exempted from any direct or personal taxes ’. Acting on the decision of Lord Roseberv’s Govern ment in the French Consul-General’s case, we advised the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to explain to the Austro-Hungarian Consul-General that Foreign Consuls in His Majesty’s dominions are not entitled to the exemptions and immunities granted to members of the diplomatic body, and that his claim was therefore unsustainable. Accordingly he now pays the taxes that are demanded of him. In his Political despatch No. 12, dated the 18th February 1897, however, Lord George Hamilton informed us that all Powers possessing most favoured treatment under treaty, might, if so minded, ask for this privilege, which was then accorded to the Persian and Turkish Consuls-General at Bombay who stand upon a somewhat special footing under treaty. Germany is a nation which possesses most favoured nation treatment by treaty, but there is no special stipulation in the Commercial Treaty of 1865 as regards Consular Agents.I 2 We therefore feel some doubt as to whether the decision of Lord Rosebery’s Government, or that of Lord Salisbury which was communicated to us by Lord George Hamilton, should be followed in the present case, and in any similar one that may subsequently arise. 4. We have directed that the claim of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation against the German Consul-General should be he!4 in abeyance pending a further communication which wilji be made on receipt of your reply. W6 have the honour to be, Sib, Your most obedient, humble servants. f INo. 489 II, dated Calcutta, the 2nd March 1904. Prom-CocHT Qdadt-Wtkradt-Isst, Imperial German Consul-General at Calcutta, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. ,, 1 have the honour to forward to you enclosed the copy of a correspondence between the Secretary to the Corporation of Calcutta and myself, concerning the question whether German Consular representatives de carriere in India have to pay any municipal taxes. As you will see from the enclosures, the Secretary to the Corporation of Calcutta requests me to pay a license tax which is, undoubtedly, a municipal tax, and I claim exemption from these taxes not, as the gentleman seems to understand it, as a diplomatist, or because certain articles are exempted from Customs duty, but on the basis of reciprocity, stating that as British Consuls m Germany are exempted from municipal taxes there, the same exemption can be claimed by German Consuls in India. 1 rvoj » e8 a t0 i r f!f “this respect to Section 40 of the “Eommunal Abgahen Gesetz , dated the 14th July 1893, and Section 25 of the “ Ausfuehrungs Anweisung according to which members of the Royal Family and the House taxes enZ ° ern ’ ® nvo y s an ^ Consular officials are exempted from municipal • a 1 don’t think that, under these circumstances, any divergence of opinion exists, but if your Government desires a further enquiry, or a formal declaration about the subject, I will report the matter to my Government. No. 2104 M., dated Calcutta, the 25th February 1904, From—The Secretary to the Municipal Corporation of Calcutta, To—The Imperial German Consul-General at Calcutta.

Looking to the far-reaching consequences of this decision, and to the fact that, strictly speaking, all Turkish Consuls in Her Majesty’s dominions are entitled to claim similar exemption, even though they do not avail themselves of the right, whilst all Powers possessing most-favoured nation treatment under treaty, such as Persia and Italy, might, if so minded, ask for equal privileges, Lord Salisbury considers it to be desirable that matters should be suffered to remain on the same basis as heretofore. 4. I have, ^ accordingly, to request that your Excellency will issue instructions to the Govern ment of Bombay for the maintenance of the exemptions already granted, and their continuance to the incumbents of the offices concerned.

Temple, My Lord, 15 th September 1873. IVe are honoured with your Lordship’s commands, signified in Mr. Hammond’s letter of the 8th instant, stating that he was directed t&gt;y your Lordship to transmit to us a correspondence which has taken place between the India Office and the Foreign Office, as to the claims set up by certain members of the foreign consular body at Bombay for exemption from payment of municipal and other taxes. That these claims were disallowed, with the exception of that of the Turkish Consul, who based his claim for exemption from customs duties on the 8th Article of the Treaty between Great Britain and Turkey of 5th January 1809. That a copy of this Treaty was enclosed, from which it would be seen that the Article in question stipulated that similar privileges and immunities to those granted to English Consuls resident in the Ottoman dominions shall be duly afforded to the “ ‘ Shahbenders ’ (Consuls) of the Sublime Porte ’’who may be appointed at Malta and in the dominions of His Britannic Majesty. That although it seemed difficult to suppose that the Article in question could have been meant by the negotiator to bear the con struction sought to be put upon it, it was thought better to recommend that any tax imposed upon the Turkish Consul by the Government of Bombay should, if objected to, not be enforced. That the Turkish Consul-General had now further claimed exemption from municipal rates and taxes under the same Article, alleging that British Consuls in Turkey are exempt from all taxes, whether Government or municipal. That the Indian Government gave in their Despatch on the subject their reasons for taking exception to this claim, and as the matter was one of very wide bearing affecting the position of all the Turkish Consuls in the British dominions, and involving, moreover, the possibility of claims for reciprocity of treatment on the part of Consuls of other Powers who have Treaty rights to “ most favoured ” treatment, your Lordship would be glad to have our opinion on the extent of the privileges and immunities which might properly be claimed by Turkish Consuls under the Article of the Treaty in question. In obedience to your Lordship’s commands, we have the honour to report that the words “ privileges and immunities ” in Article VIII. of the Treaty of 5th January 1809 are, in our opinion, open to no other construction than that contended for by the Turkish Consul at Bombay, who is entitled to an immunity reciprocal with, or the same as, a British Consul receives in the Ottoman dominions. We are unable to agree with the argument that because India was not in 1809 a part of Her Majesty’s dominions, India now is not within the words of Article VIII. However wide or disagreeable the consequences may be, we are of opinion that the claim of exemption put forward by the Turkish Consul must be allowed. We have, &amp;c., J. D. Coleridge. J.

AVith reference to your letter* of the ;Ast March, on the subject „ _ T • . i of the claim of tlie Turkish Oonsul- Not pnnte * General at Bombay to exemption from the payment of municipal rates and taxes, and in which you state that, before conceding that claim, the Marquis of Salisbury would wish to be informed whether a similar exemption is allowed to Turkish consular officers in this country, Malta, and the Colonies, and also whether the Consuls of those States who have a most-favoured nation clause in their treaties could claim a similar exemption, I am directed by the Earl of Derby to acquaint you in reply, for the information of Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for India in Council, that at the present time Turkish Consuls generally in this country and the Colonies are not exempt from payment of taxes, owing to the circumstance of their not having made application for such exemption. In two instances where that privilege has been claimed, namely, by the Turkish Consul in London in 1815 and by the Turkish Consul- General at Manchester in 1863, it was conceded, and Lord Derby is not aware of any reason why a similar exemption should not be granted to any other Turkish Consul in this country or in the Colonies who might apply for it; neither, in His Lordship’s opinion, can a similar exemption be refused to the Consuls of any other foreign States who may have in their treaties with this country most-favoured nation clauses in respect to Consuls. With regard to the concluding remark in your letter to which I am now replying, that “ Rates are clearly taxes on real property,” and that therefore Turkish Consuls cannot claim immunity from them, I am directed to request that you will move the Marquis of Salisbury to favour Lord Derby with further information as to his views upon this point, as His Lordship is at present unable to see upon what grounds a distinction is drawn between municipal rates and municipal taxes, both being similarly levied upon the tenant and not upon the landlord or possessor of real property.

If these views be accepted, and if it be held that the stipulations of Article VIII. of the Treaty of 1809 between Great Britain and Turkey do not prevent effect being given to them, the Bombay Govern ment will be instructed to communicate them to the Consuls-General of Turkey and Persia, in order that there may be no misunderstanding in the future. 4. In connection with this question, and with reference to Mr. Bertie’s letter of the 7th May, relative to the extension to Spanish Consular officers in India of any privileges accorded to such officers of the most favoured nation, Lord Salisbury will observe that the Government of India regard the privileges hitherto conceded to the Turkish and Persian Consuls-General as anomalies to be got rid of on the first suitable occasion, and that they deprecate the extension of similar privileges to the Consulates of any other nation. f (No. 158 of 1st September 1896). 5.

Liability of Foreign Consuls in India to Imperial and Municipal taxation. This very awkward and delicate question has been lying dormant for many years and there seems to be no good reason why it should be revived. After a very careful examination of all the issues, an interchange of views with the India Office, and a reference to the Law Officers, Lord Derby decided in 1875 that the claim of the Turkish Consul-General at Bombay to exemption from Imperial and Municipal taxation could not be resisted, in view of the terms of Article VIII. of the Treaty with Turkey of 1809. The correspondence extended from 1872 to 1875 and terminated in an assurance to the Turkish Ambassador that the Consul-General would be exempted, and in an instruction to the Bombay Government in the same sense. In coming to this conclusion Her Majesty’s Government were evidently fully aware of the far-reaching consequences of their decision, and of the fact that, strictly speaking, all Turkish Consuls in Her Majesty’s Dominions are entitled to claim similar exemption, even though they do not avail themselves of the right; whilst all Powers, possessing most-favoured nation treatment under Treaty, such as Persia and Italy, might, if so minded, ask for equal privileges. Indeed, the Persian Consul-General in India was subsequently exempted, like his Turkish colleague, and it seems clear from the correspondence that although the treatment was nominally accorded as a matter of courtesy, that form was only adopted to save the situation. The privilege, admitted in 1875, was evidently granted to the Office, not to the person, of the Turkish Consul-General, and to that of the Persian Consul-General respectively, and the course then adopted seems to have answered its purpose and prevented further discussion, which might have proved very inconvenient for us. In these circumstances it seems unwise of the Bombay Government not to have “let sleeping dogs lie.” They have withdrawn the exemption from municipal taxation from the present Persian Consul-General, and the India Office now propose to approve this, and to extend it by withdrawing the exemption from Imperial Customs dues from the Persian Consul-General as well as from the next Turkish Consul-General at Bombay. As there is no alteration in the Treaty situation since 1875, the reason for this change of front is not clear, and it seems likely to lead to mischievous consequences.Copy.

This very awkward and delicate question has been lying dormant for many years and there seems to be no good reason why it should be revived. -After a very uareful examination of all the issues, an interchange of views with tie India Office, and a reference to the Law Officers -Lord Derby decided in 1S75 that the claira\ of the Turkish Consul General at Bombay to exemption from Imperial and municipal taxation could not be resisted, in view of the terns of Article VIII of the Treaty with Turkey of 1809.

The primary question is Turkish under the Treaty of 1009. The secondary question 1C ' e rl ' '' Cf clons,ils of other States with most favoured nation clauses with this Country to claim similar privileges to those accorded to Turkish Consuls, Persia for example. UndGf* c i ncum s n^ -i « i v-xi^u.ietcinces a precis my be useful. In 1072 the Turkish Consul General at Bombay claimed the right of free entry for certain wearing apparel for his family, because the British Consul enjoyed similar privileges at Baghdad. The India Office in referring the matter to us said that the only foreign Consul m Bombay who enjoyed this privilege was the Persian, who was given it in 1062, apparently as a reciprocal equivalent for the immunities enjoyed by the British Mission in Persia. We told the India Office in reply that 'any tax 'imposed by the Government of Bombay should - if objected 'to - not be enforced, and that the reason given if the •matter attracted notice should be that a similar favour 'i- granted to a British Consul in Turkey'. ■ihls decision was come to in view of Article VIII of the Treaty with Turkey of 1809 which says that Turkish consuls shall enjoy 'similar privileges and immunities 'to those granted to English Consuls resident in the 'Ottomarn'Ottoman Dominions.^ (In a letter from the Government of India dated April 1st, 1090, this decision is cited as the governing principle they had followed since 1872.) In 1673, the Turkish Consul neneral refused pay municipal taxes: the natter was referred hone and the Law Officers* opinion taken on it. The Law Officers aaid that:- 'The words ’privileges and immunities* in Article VIII of the Treaty of 5th January 1809, are in our oi inion open to no other construction that that contended for by the Turkish Consul at Bombay who is entitled to an immunity reciprocal with or the same as a British Consul receives in the Ottoman Dominions.' And they added H :'ov/over v/ide or disagreeable the consequences may be vie are of opinion that the claim of exemption put forward by the Turkish Consul must be allowed.' Ve then made inquiries in Turkey as to what privileges our Consuls did enjoy as a matter of fact, and this investigation took some time, as it appeared that there was no unifora system. Some paid taxes, others aid not. However, in the end, on the faith of an assurance twice reiterated by the Turkish Ambassador in London that 'British Consuls in Turkey are now exempt from all taxes with the exception of those levied on real property,' v/e informed His Excellency that 'Her Majesty's Government will have much pleasure in exempting the Ottoman Consul General at Bombay from the present payment of Municipal Taxes, and I have the 'honour'honour to state to you that instructions to this ethect will be given without delay to the Government o f Bombay. H It is stated in an Indian Government letter in 1890 that the Persian Consul General was subsequently Rranted a similar concession under the most favoured nation clause. That seems to be how the matter stands. The vvhole question seems to open a very wide and dangerous door as to whether Turkish Consuls (and others under most favoured nation clause) might not claim, in strictness, many more privileges than they now enjoy in this country, which I believe is limited to exemption from Income Tax on their salaries, but I need not go into that subject here. The conelusion that a perusil of the correspon dence leads to is that (D In view of what we said to Musurus in May lti75, it is diiticult to see how the privileges accorded to the Turkish Consul General in Bombay can be withdrawn and it would seem to follow that the Persian is entitled to them too; as well as Representatives of States with most favoured nation clauses. It would be going back from a well-recognised principle that has been observed for many years for Her Majesty’s Government to argue-that because the immunities granted to the Turk were reciprocal, they could not be extended to a Third Power unless that Power also gave a reciprocal equivalent.

It is understood that no complaint has been received from the present Consul-General upon this score. As regards Imperial customs duty we adhere to the opinion, expressed by Lord Lansdowne’s Government in the despatch above quoted, that the exemption granted to the present Turkish Consul-General should be reconsidered when he is replaced by another officer, and that the opportunity should he taken to cancel the similar concession hitherto allowed to the Persian Consul-General. Until that time arrives the exemption hitherto granted to the Persian Consul- General must, we think, continue. 3. If Your Lordship agrees in these views and if it is held that the stipu lations of Article VIII of the Treaty of 1809 between Great Britain and Turkey do not prevent us from giving effeet to them the Bombay Government will be instructed to communicate them to the Consuls-General of Turkey and Persia in order that there may be no misunderstanding in the future.

My Lord, • n ^ &gt;ara ' P ^ had under my consideration in Council your Excellency’s Letter ‘in the Foreign Department (Internal), No. 1, dated 5th January 1886, on the subject of the claim of the French Consul General at Calcutta to be exempted from municipal taxation. 2. In reply to your inquiry as to whether this claim has been referred to Her Majesty’s Govern ment, I have to acquaint your Excellency that no communication on this matter from the French Ambassador has reached the Foreign Office. 3. Lour Excellency will observe from Sir Julian Pauucefote s letter,' a copy of which is herewith enclosed, that 1 oreign Consuls in Her Majestv’s dominions are not entitled to the exemptions and immunities granted to members of the diplomatic body ; and that no treaty stipulation exists between this country and France which binds Her Majesty’s Government to grant most favoured treatment to French Consuls in Her Majesty’s dominions. It appears also that British Consuls in France, in the absence of a Consular Convention, are denied ex emptions which are granted to Consuls of other Foreign States, on the ground that Her Majesty’s Government are not able to grant French Consuls in Her Majesty’s dominions such extended ex emptions and privileges as are accorded in manv Foreign States. 4. In these circumstances, the arguments by which the French Consul General at Calcutta seeks to escape payment of police rates do not seem to Her Majesty’s Government to be well founded, and consequently there is no valid reason why the payment of the entire rates should not be pressed. Should the French Consul General, however, after receiving such a communication in the above sense as your Excellency in Council may deem it ex pedient to make to him, still persist in his refusal 1S189.

I am to request that the Lieutenant-Governor may be favoured with the orders which may eventually be passed on the subject. 3.

From— Babu Gopal Lal Mitter, Officiating Chairman of the Corporation of the Town of Calcutta, To—The Officiating Under-Secretary to the Government of Bengal, Municipal Dept. I have the honor to submit, for the consideration of Government, the annexed copies of correspondence with the Consul-General of France, regarding payment of the occupiers (water, police and lighting) rates due by hirn under section 89 of Act IY (B. C.) of 1876 on premises No. 52, Park Street, which are in his occupation, and are used as his office as well as his residence. 2. It was explained that under the existing law no exception is made in favor of Consuls or any officials, and that his predecessors as well as the Consuls of all other countries have hitherto made no objection to the payment of Mu nicipal rates. The Consul-General in his last letter intimates that he is willing to pny under protest only the water and lighting rates, but he adheres to his resolution not to pay the Police rate, on the ground that he does not consider himself bound to pay for police or any other kind of protection as that has been guaranteed to him, as the duly accredited Consul-General of France, by Her Majesty’s Government. He further stated in a former letter that’the matter has been referred through his Government to Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. 3. Under these circumstances,' I beg to request that the papers may be submitted for the orders of the Lieutenant-Governor, and that I may be informed whether it is the wish of Government that Municipal rates or the Police rate should not in future be demanded from the Consul-General of France and from all other Foreign Consuls residing within the Municipal limits of Calcutta. The Commissioners have full power under the law to enforce payment by suit or by distraint at once, but as this might be looked upon as an act of international discourtesy, they are desirous not to proceed to such lengths if it can be avoided. As the Commissioners have no power under the Act to exempt the representatives of Foreign powers from the payment of Municipal rates, I would submit that if, in the opinion of His 23 Government as for a Government buildin- cIlarge agalnst Calcutta, le 19me Aout 1884.

Calcutta, Referring to your letter of the 8th of October last, in which you say that at the request of the Foreign Secretary the question relative to the pavment ot the Municipal rates by you has been submitted to the Foreign Secretary in Loudon through the French Ambassador, I am desired to enquire if any renlv has been received to this reference.

With reference to your letter of the 20th instant, I beg to inform you that I wrote to the French Foreign Office on the 6th October 1884 about the Municipal taxes of my house, and I have not yet received any answer to my application. The matter is now with the Government of Her Majesty for consideration, and I suppose that it will take some more time before * it is settled. I would therefore advise yon to apply to Mr. H. Durand, Secretary of State lor the Foreign Department, in order to avoid any further loss of time if you think it advisable. No. 3051, dated Calcutta, 26th March 1885. From—R. Turnbull, Esq., Secretary to the Corporation of the Town of Calcutta, To—The Consul-General for France at Calcutta. I submitted to the Chairman your letter, dated 21st instant, respecting pay ment of rates on the premises you occupy, and I am desired by Air. Harrisonto say that Municipal rates are quite distinct from Government dues or taxes, and must by law be paid on account of all bouses except those used exclu sively for the purposes of public worship. The rates, I am to add, have always been paid by all previous Consuls- General for Prance and are being paid by all the Consuls of other countries at the present moment. I am to ask you therefore to be so good as to pay as heretofore while the question is pending, on our assurance that the amount will be refunded should it be decided hereafter that it is not due.

No. 3, dated Calcutta, 1st April 1885. From— R. Turnbull, Esq., Secretary to the Corporation of the Town of Calcutta, To—The Consul-General for France at Calcutta. In reply to your letter, dated the 27th ultimo, the Chairman has desired me to express his regret that he cannot comply with your request and receive pay ment of one rate without the other. I am to say in reference to your remark about the Police rate that this is a matter of Municipal Police and not of Gov ernment protection, that you are charged not as Consul-General for Prance, hut as the occupier of a certain house within the Municipal limits, and no preced ing Prench Consul has ever raised the objection which you do. The Commis sioner and the Deputy Commissioner of Police themselves pay the very rate in question. I am therefore to express a hope that you will reconsider your deci sion as it is quite clear that you are liable by the law in force in Calcutta. Calcutta, le lime A.vril 1885. De— Mons. J. E.

En reponse a votre lettre du ler dece mois j’ai Fhonneur de vous informer qu’il n’y a aucune comparaison possible entre le Chef de la Police de Calcutta et au Consul General accredite par une nation etrangere aupr£s du Gouverne- - ment des Indes et pourvu d’un exequatur signe par la Reine ordonnant aux autorites de le proteger. Ces autorites sont toutes les autorites Anglaises, et la Corporation de Calcutta ne formant pas un dtat independant dans Fetat Britannique ne pent pas me faire payer sa protection. Je suis pret a payer toutes les autres taxes, mais j’attendrai la decision du Gouvernement de la Reine pour payer le taxe de la police. Je ne paie, d’ailleurs, les autres taxes que sous protestation, car dans aucun pays les Consuls ne paient les taxes Municipales directe. Un de mes predecesseurs a deja proteste contre cette taxation arbi trage; mais les longueurs inherentes aces questions Font fatigue; j’aurai la patience d’attendre, et je suis certain que tout tribunal anglais comprendra qu’il serait amenable d’attendre la decision du Gouvernement de la Reine.
