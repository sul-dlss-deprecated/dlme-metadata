This report replaces the provisional edition of Military Report on Mesopotamia (Area 9), Central Kurdistan, which was published by the Government Monotype Press at Simla in 1920. The major part of the area covered by this report lies within the Turkish Empire. Since the outbreak of the Great War very few Europeans have been permitted to visit any part of Turkish Central Kurdistan, and they are still prevented from doing so. In view of this fact and the mass of other restrictions, which the Turks have designed in recent years to prevent the acquisition of information normally available in other countries, it will be appreciated that much of the subject matter relating to Turkish Central Kurdistan will inevitably be sketchy, and in some cases out of date. Naturally, however, every endeavour has been made to supply detailed and up to date information in this respect. The maps quoted throughout this report are varied, but the best available for any particular district. North of the Turco- Traq frontier practically no post-war survey has been done, and the maps, in many cases mere compilation of indifferent material, are therefore inaccurate. The series used in this volume are— Indian Degree Sheets (1' = 4 miles), e.g., ID Rowanduz. War Office Degree Sheets (1' — 3-95 miles), e.g., J.38/M Jazirat-ibn-Omar.

Towards the middle of the 19th century the Ottoman Govern ment began a serious attempt to establish its rule over the Kurds, the most independent as well as the most turbulent element of the empire. The Turks rightly diagnosed the root of the difficulty to be the power of the tribal chieftains, who combined a ruthless mediaeval authority with a plentiful supply of rifles. The Turks proceeded to deal with them after Turkish fashion, using one to undermine the power of his neighbours, laying stealthy hands on another, subsidising a third till his power waxed and called for correction. In this manner they scattered over the empire the Baban family of Sulaimani in southern Kurdistan, while in the north they brought the Badr Khans of Jazirat-ibn-Omar to Constantinople, subjected Abdul Qadir, the head of the ruling house of Shemsdinan, to intermittent exile, favoured Ibrahim Pasha, of the Milli, east of Aleppo, and then encouraged his rivals to fall upon him and destroy him. A systematic attempt to exterminate the Armenians, begun in Abdul Hamid’s time and continued by the Committee of Union and Progress, added official persecution to the other forms of disorder which wracked Anatolia. The Kurds were used as agents of destruction. The war brought the Armenian policy to a climax. The massacres of 1896 and 1909 were not comparable to the slaughter carried out with the tacit encouragement of the Germans in 1915 and the succeeding years. The Kurds inherited the villages and lands of the dead Armenians, but they did not go entirely unpunished. Armenian refugees and Armenians of the Russian Caucasus joined the Russian army, and they took occasion to retaliate on the Kurds, doing as they had been done by. The Kurds affirm that their losses were 400,000 as against a million or more Armenians. At Rowanduz in 1916 the Russian and Armenian forces, when they retreated, left the town and district a desolation from which it has never recovered. The Turkish Nestorians, or, as they prefer to be called, Assyrians, had not been comprehensively massacred, but a neigh bouring Kurdish Agha, Simko, chief of the Shikak tribe, murdered their Patriarch in 1916. In revenge they attacked him, and, when too hard pressed, migrated in a body and joined their co-religionists in the Urumieh plain, where they put up a stout resistance to the Turks and Kurds until 1918, when the whole community—men, women, children, and cattle and such household goods as they could carry—abandoned the position and marched14 to Hamadan. Here they were taken in hand by the British authorities and sent on to Baqubah, where a refugee camp was prepared for them. On the victory of the Allies in 1918 there were thus two distinct problems to be considered in connection with the Christians, both concerned almost solely with Central and Northern Kurdistan : firstly, what reparation could be made to the Armenians ; and, secondly, what measures could be taken to repatriate the Assyrians. The Armenians embarrassed the issue of the first question by talking openly of their high hopes for the formation of an Armenian state comprising an area variously defined, but not infrequently including the six Anatolian Vilayets in which Armenians are or were, previous to 1915, to be found, viz., Sivas, Erzerum, Kharput, Diarbekr, Bitlis and Van. The Kurds, who are in overwhelming majority in these districts, took alarm, and the strong nationalist sentiments which already existed among them were enhanced by the fear that the Western Powers con templated putting them under the yoke of the despised Armenians. This fear made Kurdistan a favourable theatre for Turkish propaganda, and during the long and disastrous delay which occurred between the armistice and the conclusion of peace with Turkey, the latter had full opportunity to exploit the advantage offered by local conditions. Thus in our dealings with the Kurds we found gradually arrayed against us a series of formidable prejudices, pan-Islamism stirred from Constantinople, racial pride, cupidity, and the arrogance of the Kurdish Agha, who feared the possibility of a strong European control far more than he feared the Turks. 1919.— Pro-Turkish and anti-Christian Propaganda—Rising of the Goyan Tribe—Disorders at Amadia and Aqra. In the north-western corner of the Mosul Vilayet pro-Turkish and anti-Christian intrigue began to meet with considerable success ; the position of the Christian villages between Zakho and Jazirat-ibn-Omar became one of considerable danger, while in some cases anti-Christian disturbances actually took place. On 19th March letters were intercepted from Abdul Rahman Agha, chief of the Shernakh Kurds, north-east of Jazirat-ibn-Omar’ urging the expulsion of foreigners, and stating that the movement had the support of the Turkish Government, whose efforts were being seconded by individuals and committees in Constantinople and Cairo, working for an independent Kurdish state. The local centres of the evil were Jazirat-ibn-Omar and bhernakh, both of which have been noted for anti-Christian feeling in the past, and were conveniently placed for any movement supported by the Turks. The actual instruments were the Goyan, an unruly and turbulent tribe, situated for the most part just outside our administrative area, to the north of Zakho.During the first week in April, Captain Pearson, Assistant Political Officer, Zakho, proceeded on a visit to this tribe to restore order and to make arrangements for the safety of the Christians in the future. While actually in the company of certain of the Goyan chiefs he was treacherously ambushed and murdered on the march under circumstances which left little doubt as to the complicity of his companions. Although the necessity for drastic and immediate actiop was apparent, military operations were precluded by the difficulties of the country, the lack of supplies, and the fact that the Goyan habitat was beyond our administrative frontier. The incident was interpreted as a test of the vigour of the British Government, and our failure to mete out condign punishment on the tribe involved soon resulted in the spread of unrest, the attack on a gendarmerie post, and the ambushing of a military convoy. The Goyan and other tribes of the neighbourhood began to assume a defiant attitude. That the tribes recognised our military dis abilities was demonstrated by the Amadia and Aqra risings in July and November. It was the desire of the British authorities to provide for the repatriation of the Assyrian refugees to their homes in the mountains. The nearest and most convenient approach lay through Amadia, and with this end in view, British administration had been extended in that direction. In January, 1919, a detachment of troops was placed near Amadia, and an Assistant Political Officer was appointed in the following March. The Kurds were treated with great liberality as regards agricultural advances, and no distinction was drawn between them and the Christians. The establishment of order and the basis of administration brought the A.P.O. into collision with Kurdish chiefs, who saw their independence threatened. British adminis tration was not distasteful so long as it was confined to the distribution of advances and grants, but when it took the direction of collecting taxes and curbing the lawless tyranny of the Aghas it appeared in a different light. It was also common knowledge that we contemplated repatriating the Assyrians, and the Christians of Amadia did not fail to draw the attention of the Moslems to their belief that their day had dawned at last. There were outside influences ready to exaggerate talk of this nature. Owing to the postponement of the repatriation scheme the troops were withdrawn in June to the Suwara Toka Pass, 18 miles west of Amadia. This left the A.P.O., Captain Willey, alone m the town with Lieutenant MacDonald and Sergeant Troop m charge of the Kurdish levies. The malcontents saw their opportunity, and during the night of the 15th July the leaders of the town factions, with the tacit connivance of the tribes, enlisted the services of the local gendarmerie, and murdered the whole party. The outbreak was a demonstration against British authority and definitely anti-Christian in character. The16 Christian villages of the Amadia district were systematically raided, and crops and sheep were everywhere destroyed and lifted. The Goyan, who were responsible for the murder of Captain Pearson, and the Guli took part in the rising with the Barwari tribes of Amadia, but when the British punitive column approached the town, the murderers fled to Goyan territory. Our troops drove the Upper Barwari tribes from the mountains north of the town, and then turned their attention to the Guli and the Goyan. Operations were concluded in September, and though the tribesmen had eluded us in the mountains, we had succeeded in inspiring them with a wholesome fear and a conviction that the rising had been a mistake, and that they had been beaten on their own ground. By October all sections, and, with a few exceptions, all the leading offenders, had tendered their submission. They were dealt with leniently, the punishment meted out by the troops having been sufficient. Having appointed our own nominees to Amadia and Barwari, and having provided them with means to maintain their position, the troops withdrew in December to Dohuk, half-way between Mosul and Amadia. The border then remained superficially quiet, but it was evident that underlying this attitude there was a general spirit of unrest. In October, Mr. Bill, I.C.S., who had succeeded Colonel Leachman as Political Officer, Mosul, proceeded on a tour of the Aqra district, to which an Assistant Political Officer had been appointed soon after the armistice. The mountains north of Aqra are the home of the Zibar Kurds, while on the left bank of the Greater Zab are the territories of the Shaikh of Barzan. The latter and Paris Agha, the chief of the Zibaris, are mutually hostile on account of assistance given to the Turks by Paris to capture Shaikh Abdul Salim, the predecessor of the present Shaikh Ahmad. Abdul Salim was afterwards hanged in Mosul. The attempt to hold the balance between these two resulted in the hostility of both to government, and they provided a fertile field for Turkish propaganda, skilfully worked by Haider Bey, an ex-Governor of Van. By his agency the quarrel between Zibar and Barzan was temporarily laid aside. On his arrival in Aqra, Mr. Bill was obliged to levy a fine on Paris Agha for having sniped at our gendarmes. Another Zibar chief, Babekr Agha, who was on friendly terms with Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan, was also implicated. These two malcontents, enraged at being so summarily dealt with, communicated with Shaikh Afimad, who sent his younger brother and 20 men to the assistance of the Zibaris. These, with Paris Agha and Babekr Agha altogether about 100 men, ambushed Mr. Bill and Captain Scott near Bira Kapra in November, 1919, and shot themAqra was then attacked and looted, but the tribesmen quarrelled over the loot, and the Barzanis returned home. Offers of assistance having been received from a number of neighbouring tribes, the A.P.O. from Batas entered Aqra on the 9th November, to be well received by the townspeople, who were not a party to the activities of the Zibar chiefs. A punitive column was then sent to the valley of the Greater Zab. The villagers, who stood in great fear of their Aghas, flew white flags, and appeared to welcome the protection of the troops. The houses of the Zibar chieftains were destroyed, after which the column crossed the Zab and dealt with Barzan. The rebels were unable to rouse the tribes, largely owing to the loyalty of Qadir Agha of Shush, who, although belonging to the Zibar tribe, had severed his connection with it. Paris Agha and Babekr Agha of Zibar, Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan and his brother escaped to the mountains and were outlawed. The Amadia tribes remained quiet, and Saiyid Taha of Shemsdinan refused to listen to the suggestion of the Turkish Qaimaqam of Neri, that he and Sutu Agha of Oramar should send assistance to the rebels. On the conclusion of operations, the administrative frontier was drawn in to Aqra, and no attempt was made to hold the country between that town and the Zab. By the end of the year, therefore, we had withdrawn our control from the mountains of Kurdistan. From Rowanduz the outpost of Government had been withdrawn to Batas ; thence the line ran to Aqra and Dohuk, leaving Amadia and Zibar outside the zone. The year was not to close without further trouble, for scarcely a month later Shaikh Ubaidullah of the Surchi, a tribe living in the immediate neighbourhood of Aqra, began intriguing with Paris Agha and Shaikh Ahmad for a reduplication of the former coup. Aeroplane action against the Zibar in January, 1920, compelled the retirement of Paris Agha to his own lands, but Shaikh Ubaidullah remained obdurate and refused to come in to the political authorities. 1920.— Attack on Aqra—Revolt of the Surchi—Assyrian Repatria tion — The Treaty of Sevres and Rise of Turkish Nationalism. A state of veiled hostility prevailed during February and March, during which time the tribes were known to have received inflammatory propaganda from the Turks, who allowed no opportunities to pass of inciting them against us. In April a military convoy was ambushed by the Surchi on its way to Aqra, and a few days later they attacked the town itself, which put up a spirited and successful defence. A punitive column was immediately despatched, and the enemy strongholds at Bujil, Kalati, and Susnawa were destroyed. The Surchi leaders thereupon retired into Zibari country.18 \ During the next four months comparative peace prevailed except for occasional raids by Surchi and Zibari tribesmen. A small column proceeded through their country, bringing tran quility into the neighbourhood until an outbreak occurred at Rowanduz, following upon an attack on the Political Officer, Arbil, in the Rowanduz gorge. Nuri Bawil, the assailant, took refuge among the Aqra Surchi, and from there engineered the rising, which resulted in the evacuation of Rowanduz and Batas. Most of the Shaikhs of the Aqra Surchi joined the Dasht-i-Harir sections, who had also the support of the Khushnao. At one time Arbil was threatened with investment, but the despatch of columns from Mosul and Kirkuk averted the danger. The bulk of the Surchi then crossed the Zab, and proceeded to attack the Assyrian camp at Jujar, only to be beaten off and driven across the Zab again. At the end of the year the Surchi Shaikhs, with the exception of Shaikh Ubaidullah, having rejected the offer of peace, departed to outlawry in the mountains. A conference was held in March to consider the question of the repatriation of the Assyrian refugees, who were then at Baqubah. A suggestion for settling five to ten thousand of these people in the Mosul area was rejected, and a repatriation scheme, put forward by Agha Petros, was adopted. The essence of the scheme was that by arming eight thousand of the men, it would be possible to push through to Neri, Diza and Ushnu, and, after strong garrisons had been established there, to bring up the women and children and push through to Urumieh and other parts of Kurdistan, which they had formerly occupied. The mountaineers, Tiari and Tkhuma, etc., who were the fighting men of the people, were to accompany this movement, and, having installed their compatriots, were to make their way back westwards to their own parts of the country. The route chosen was via Aqra, and it was hoped it should begin by June. Agha Petros laid stress on the friendly relations existing between him personally and most of the Kurdish chiefs affected, and agreed that the success of the project depended on amicable relations being established between the Assyrians and the Kurds. In view of the behaviour of the Tiari battalion, and more particularly its deserters, in the Amadia area in the operations of the previous year, apprehensions as to their possible behaviour were put forward, but Agha Petros was convinced of his ability to hold them. The move up from Baqubah to Mosul was begun very shortly afterwards, and by the beginning of May a very large number were established at a camp at Mindan, on the Khazir river, about half-way between Mosul and Aqra. During the summer there were indications that the moun taineers had no wish to proceed to Urumieh, but were likely,19 on reaching the Zab valley, to break north and make their way ^ up that river to Amadia. Owing to the cutting of the line during the May and June disturbances, the arrival of the remainder of the Assyrians from Baqubah was very much delayed. They did not reach Mindan till October, and, in spite of the lateness of the season, it was decided to send the armed men forward early in November. j r Meanwhile the prospect of repatriation had been exercising le the minds of the Kurds. For a while it seemed as if Simko, of 1$ the Shikak tribe, were trying to arrange a tribal conference to oppose the movement, but apparently wiser councils prevailed. n Agha Petros had written to most of the Aghas assuring them of his peaceful intentions ; but most of them, while reciprocating his sentiment, were sceptical, not of the wishes of the Government, but of the will of the mountaineers to abide by them. The event justified their doubts. The forward move was made on 22nd October. No opposition was encountered until they reached the Zab, the crossing of which was opposed by the Zibari Aghas and Shaikh Ahmad,, but effected with only slight loss. Barzan was occupied and destroyed, and the force moved north in pursuit of Paris Agha, who was making for Oramar via Narwa and Raikan. Although the Aghas of these two districts were perfectly ready to assist Agha Petros in attacking Paris, the Tiari and Tkhuma immediately started looting and burning. Having destroyed 21 villages in Narwa and Raikan they definitely broke away from the repatriation movement and passed into Chal, where they held the Aghas to ransom and destroyed more viJlages. They then tried and were successful in crossing the Zab into Barwari Bala. Rashid Beg was able to prevent them getting far from the river, but more damage was done, and they passed by Amadia into the Supna country. The A.P.O., Dohuk, went to Amadia, to find that the majority of the Assyrians had made their way back to the Zab, from where they found their way to Aqra. Meanwhile, the main body, deprived of the essential support of the mountaineers, unable to obtain supplies owing to their depredations, and in great distress owing to the heavy rains which set in, found themselves unable to go forward, and, 1 re-crossing the Zab with difficulty, returned to Aqra and Mindan. ^ The enterprise had failed. The choice of the difficult Aqra 5 road rather than the comparatively easy one to Urumieh via r Rowanduz was unfortunate ; the lack of any arrangements for y getting up supplies from this country was also a weak spot in Agha Petros’s scheme, which apparently depended on his force y being able to live on the country. It is clear, however, that the ' r main cause of the failure was the fanatical spirit of vengeance . shown by the people themselves. At Russian instigation they ravaged the country in 1917, and the repetition of their perform ance did much to discredit future protestations made by them or a- the British Government on their behalf. y.20 \ The Treaty of Sevres, which, amongst other stipulations, delimited the frontiers between Turkey and ’Iraq, was signed in 1920. It was immediately repudiated by Mustafa Kemal, at that time a Turkish General, whose activities were beyond the control of the Government in Constantinople and who stood for Turkish interests in Asia Minor against all comers. A League of Eastern Anatolia had been formed under his auspices in defence of Ottoman rights, its leading principle being the integrity of Turkey, with the corollary that no Greek or Armenian State should be established within its limits. A meeting of the League was held at Erzerum in August, but subsequently Sivas was chosen as the headquarters of the nationalist committee. Its influence was sufficient to bring about the resignation in October of Damad Farid’s government, which it decried as non-national. During the succeeding years the Nationalist Party achieved a remarkable revival in military and political strength. The provinces of Cilicia and Adalia were recovered from France and Italy and the Greek armies were driven into the sea. Asia Minor was completely cleared of any foreign Power. Having achieved so much, Mustafa Kemal felt able to reopen the question of the other lost province of Mosul. He undoubtedly believed that the methods which had been so successful in Cilicia and elsewhere could be applied with equal success against Britain. Their chief weapon was propaganda, and this, backed up by concentrations of troops on the northern frontiers, trade embargoes, frontier blockades, and encouragement of sedition and revolt among the Kurdish tribes in Central and Southern Kurdistan, was utilised to instil a want of confidence in the ’Iraq Government, and to prepare the way for the recovery of the Mosul Vilayet. Most of the troubles which now arose in Central Kurdistan had their origin in Turkish propaganda. Arms were distributed among the tribes, whilst on the north-eastern frontier, taking advantage of a rebellion which they had engineered, the Turks occupied the disaffected area, and used it as a base for further incitement to revolt. 1921. — Situation across the Frontier and in Anatolia—Occupation of Rowanduz by a Turkish Force. During this time the Turks had been engaged in prosecuting the war against the Greeks in Anatolia ; and, owing to strained relations with the French on their Syrian frontier, had few troops on our northern boundaries. Although theoretically a state of armistice prevailed, they were to all intents and purposes hostile. Their chief weapon was propaganda, which they spread through the cities and tribes of ’Iraq, and among the frontier peoples, inciting them to revolt and to raids on convoys to hinder trade. The Turks were also occupied by considerable troubles of their own on the frontier. The subjugation of the Haverki was21 attempted in January, and in October they were obliged to undertake operations against the Shernakh. The fighting which followed was indecisive, but eventually the Shernakh were forced to come to terms owing to lack of ammunition with which to continue the struggle. By the reduction of this tribe, the Turks strengthened their hold on the country ; and, by the conclusion of a treaty with the French on the Syrian frontier in November, were enabled to move troops eastwards. Kurdish nationalist hopes, of which there had been some slight indications, were thereby held in check. In May a Turkish officer and a few men arrived on the eastern and north-eastern frontier and proceeded to Rowanduz, which had been evacuated owing to the Surchi rising in the previous year.. Faris Agha of the Zibar was summoned to Van and given several loads of ammunition, with a promise of Turkish support if he would raise the tribes against us. The presence in Rowanduz of this Turkish force, which, as time went on, was considerably increased, served as a focus for all anti-Government elements, and apprehensions were entertained for the safety of Aqra. Despite this threat, however, and the continued rebellion of Shaikh Ubaidullah in the Dasht-i-Harir, against whom air action was taken, the situation round Aqra remained quiet, owing to the fact that the Surchi there were not co-operating with the other sections of the tribe. In September, Ubaidullah submitted to the authorities, but, hearing some rumours that he was about to be imprisoned, he went on the warpath again, and attacked a levy and police post the following December. It was not until some two years later that Shaikh Ubaidullah finally surrendered. 1922.— Turkish Military Preparations—Attack on Amadia by Barzan and Zibar Tribesmen—Repatriation of the Assyrians — Return of the Amadia Notables. In the spring of 1922, Turkish troops were brought eastwards to strengthen the forces at Jazirat-ibn-Omar, and a number of outposts were established along the line of the Hazil river in close proximity to the town of Zakho. At the same time, great efforts were made to placate and obtain the good will of the tribes of the neighbourhood. In the Dohuk area the inhabitants were little affected by the presence of the Turks at Jazirat-ibn-Omar, but the townspeople of Zakho had the liveliest fears of an imminent attack. A violent anti-British and anti-Sherifian propaganda was disseminated throughout the frontier, and was especially strong in the direction of Amadia and Aqra. This propaganda took the form of pamphlets bearing the seal of the Pan-Islamic Society of Angora. In the early months of the year, when the outcome of the war between Greece and Turkey was still a matter of doubt, this22 propaganda did not have much result, but when final victory remained with the Turks the whole of Central Kurdistan became restless and disquieted. On the 9th September the Turks had occupied Smyrna, and a few weeks later Amadia was attacked by a body of Barzan, Mazuri, Shirwan, and Zibar tribesmen, who had been assisted into the town by the connivance of Haji Abdul Latif, a disgruntled ex-Mudir. The Qaimmaqam succeeded in main taining himself in the Serai whilst assistance from outside was forthcoming. Some 200 Assyrians, led by the Bishop Mar Sergis, who happened to be near, immediately proceeded to the rescue and drove the rebels out of the town. Such a disturbance calls for immediate and summary retribu tion, as any lack of energy in displaying military strength is construed as a sign of weakness and results in a large increase in the rebel strength. If a long delay occurs between the actual incident and the commencement of punitive operations, all the malcontents and brigands of the surrounding country are attracted to the rebel chief, who can then put up a greater resistance than would be the case if he were disposed of at once. Rebel chiefs on a frontier such as that of Central Kurdistan are also very open to external influences. Their sedition is encouraged by unfriendly acts from across the frontier, and instant action is demanded in order to prevent {a) the news of revolt spreading, and {b) to prevent assistance in arms and ammunition reaching them. In the case of the Amadia attack, punitive measures were undertaken three weeks later against the offending tribes, and Barzan with a number of Mazuri villages was destroyed. Co-operation by a column from Aqra was ineffective, and the Zibar Aghas were able to put up a successful resistance. During these operations the Turkish commander at Rowanduz, Euz Demir, was making strenuous efforts to induce the Surchi to attack Aqra, but the tribesmen were unwilling to act without military assistance. Although both these attempts failed, the Turks at Jazirat-ibn- Omar continued their preparations, and the tribes on that part of the frontier were much impressed by the restored Turkish prestige. The repatriation of the Assyrians was a great factor in rendering innocuous the efforts of the Turks to raise the tribes against us. In the spring the whole of the Upper and Lower Tiari proceeded to the mountains, and were joined by the Tkhuma, who returned to their villages east of the Zab. The Turks realised the pro- British attitude of the Assyrians, and did their utmost to induce the Kurdish tribes to attack them. Having failed in this, they endeavoured to win them over to their side and invited the Patriarch and Maliks to visit Euz Demir at Jualmerk. The offer was declined. Haji Abdul Latif, who had fled with the Barzan rebels, was allowed to return after the reoccupation of Rowanduz upon23 payment of a fine of Rs. 10,000 ; and his great enemy and rival, Haji Shaban Agha, who had fled to Jazirat after the 1919 rising, was also given permission to return to Amadia towards the end of 1922. 1923.— Operations in Rowanduz Area—Continuation of Turkish Preparations on the Jazirah Front—Reduction after Signature of the Lausanne Treaty—Submission of the Barzan, Zibar, and Surchi Outlaws. The spring of 1923 saw the completion of the highly success ful operations by military and air formations in the Arbil- Koi Sanjak-Rowanduz area. As a result of these operations, culminating in the reoccupation of Rowanduz by Imperial forces, in April, the Turks were finally expelled from this portion of ’Iraq. Although these operations do not fall topographically within the sphere of this volume (a fuller description will be found in Chapter I, M.R. of ’Iraq, Area 10), they had a wide and salutary reaction in Central Kurdistan. The year 1923 opened with a renewal of propaganda work by the Turks throughout Kurdistan, and on the Jazirah front preparations were made for an offensive against ’Iraq. Great activity was shown in the movement of troops eastwards and in the transport of stores for their maintenance ; whilst wholesale levies of crops and other supplies were made, and a rigorous frontier blockade was instituted along the Hazil and Khabur rivers. Precautionary measures to eliminate potential sources of disorder on lines of communication were undertaken against the Shernakh tribe, whose chief, Abdul Rahman Agha, was arrested and deported. Posts were established in areas where the attitude of the inhabitants was doubtful. In the beginning of April an important meeting was held at Sairt, and the chiefs were instructed to do everything possible to create unrest and disaffection along the frontier. Shaikh Ahmad al Senussi was reported to be in Diarbekr to give weight to the work of propaganda. The nature of the Turkish preparations pointed to an attack on ’Iraq, although possibly no more was intended than a threat to back up their diplomacy at Lausanne, where negotiations were then in progress. During the Rowanduz operations the Turkish troops on the Jazirah front remained inactive, and after the signing of the Lausanne treaty there were indications of the gradual reduction of their effectives, which in February had amounted to 8,530 rifles, 1,600 sabres and 38 guns. The situation at Aqra for the early part of the year was most precarious, owing to encouragement given to rebellious tribes24 and the presence of the Turks at Rowanduz. The Zibar, Barzan and Surchi were almost entirely out of control. At the end of March Saiyid Taha was sent to Aqra with the object of neutralizing the Shaikh of Barzan and his adherents. On Saiyid Taha’s invitation, Shaikh Ahmad came into Aqra with a large following, and was followed by Shaikh Raqib of the Surchi,who had contrived that Shaikh Ubaidullah should remain with the Turks. The preparations for the recovery of Rowanduz were not without influence on the actions of the rebel chiefs, who were now con sidered to have made their submission. After the capture of Rowanduz, Paris Agha of Zibar was allowed to come in upon payment of a fine of 40 rifles, and Shaikh Ubaidullah after payment of 75 rifles. The Turks, having been driven from ’Iraq territory, estabhshed garrisons at Van, Bashkala, Diza, Julamerk and Shapatan with the object of bringing unruly subjects under their authority, to collect revenues and to restore Turkish prestige generally. Towards the end of the year Major-General Jafar Tayar Pasha was appointed to the Jazirah Command, and reinforcements were reported on their way eastwards. It was not known whether these changes constituted a threat against 'Iraq or were merely designed to strengthen Turkish control over the Kurdish tribes. 1924.— Affray between Wali of Julamerk and Assyrians—Inroad of Turkish Troofis into ’Iraq and Occupation of’Iraq Administered Territory—Reference to and decision of Council of League of Nations regarding the Frontier. Early in January the Turkish forces on the Jazirah front were reinforced by a cavalry regiment, and the local intelligence officer took advantage of this addition of strength to increase the propaganda work among the tribes, in which considerable success was achieved. The General Officer Commanding the Vllth Corps, Jafar Tayar Pasha, visited Nisibin in March and assembled all the tribal chiefs, whom he exhorted to show their loyalty to the Turks and support military operations if the need arose. Organisation of irregular units of cavalry from the tribes was undertaken, and in April it was reported that Euz Demir, the former Turkish Commandant at Rowanduz, had arrived at Mardin to command these detachments. In May the 1st Cavalry Division arrived at Jazirat-ibn-Omar from Mardin with General Mursel Pasha in command. It was considered that this last movement was to demonstrate among the Goyan and other Kurdish tribes to the east, who were very lukewarm to the Turkish interest. Towards the end of June messages were received from the Assyrians of Lower Tiari and Tkhuma to the effect that the25 Turkish garrison at Julamerk had received large reinforcements with the intention of marching against them. Much propaganda work had been carried out in this area, and the Turks had stated that they intended to send troops through Assyrian territory for revenue collection. On the 5th August the Wali of Julamerk set out with an escort of 40 mounted men to tour the district bordering the Turko-Traq frontier. The Tkhuma section of the Assyrians were in a state of the greatest alarm regarding his intentions, and took up a defensive position at Hani, 31 miles north-east of Amadia. On the approach of the Wali and his party the Turks opened fire, and a fight ensued, during which the Wali was taken prisoner and five of his escort were killed and two wounded. The Tkhuma casualties were three killed. On the 11th August the Wali was released with the remainder of his escort and permitted to return to Chal after promising that no retaliation would be offered. On or about the 1st September, Advance Headquarters of the Vllth Corps was moved to Jazirat-ibn-Omar, and most of the infantry of the 2nd Division were reported to be marching eastwards from Sairt. Infantry in considerable strength also arrived at Shernakh. In the beginning of September reports of a concentration of Turkish regular and irregular troops on the right bank of the Hazil river, north-west of Zakho, were received. This concentra tion was followed by small patrols crossing the river, which forms the boundary between Turkey and ’Iraq in that sector, and advancing eastwards into ’Iraq territory. The Turks announced that the movement was directed against one of their own tribes, the Goyan, but the announcement was merely intended to conceal their real intentions. On the 12th September the Qaimmaqam of Jazirat was warned that armed forces crossing into ’Iraq would be fired upon. Notwithstanding this warning, Turkish forces were reported to be crossing the Hazil some five miles north-west of Zakho on the night of the 13th-14th, and on the following morning an air reconnaissance discovered a body of irregular troops in the act of fording the river. They were engaged by the aircraft and forced to retire to the west bank, having suffered a number of casualties. Another Turkish force was located at Birkar (six miles north of Zakho), which was also engaged, heavy casualties being inflicted. During the following week the passage of Turkish troops, both regular and irregular, through ’Iraq territory continued, and was revealed as a part of a scheme of punitive measures against the Assyrians. In spite of vigorous and sustained aerial opposi tion to the transit of these troops, the Turks attained their objectives, and practically all the repatriated Assyrians of Tkhuma and Upper and Lower Tiari evacuted their homes and fled to Amadia.26 The Turkish operations were conducted by three columns, composed as follows :— 1st Column .. .. 1st Cavalry Division (less 11th Regiment). 2nd Column .. . . 18th Regiment (2 battalions). 2 batteries mountain artillery. 6 th Regiment on L. of C. with H.Q.at Shernakh. 3rd Column .. . . 1st Regiment (2 battalions). 1 battery mountain artillery. Detachment 6 th Frontier Batt. Line of Communication. 62nd Regiment (2 battalions). In addition to the above regular troops, each column was accompanied by tribal contingents. The first and second columns burned and devastated the villages in the Ashuta and Lizan valleys, north of Amadia, while the third marched down the Zab from Julamerk as far as Dorawa. The whole punitive campaign was commanded by Jafar Tayar Pasha, who moved his advanced headquarters to Besbin, north east of Zakho. In the beginning of October reliable reports were current of Turkish reinforcements being en route eastwards for Jazirat-ibn- Omar and Mardin. Increased activity was displayed in intriguing with the ’Iraq tribes, who were told that the Turks intended to continue their advance to Mosul. It was essential to demonstrate the intention to defend ’Iraq territory from further inroads, and steps were accordingly taken to secure Amadia, and thus prevent another retirement of the Assyrians, for such a retirement or a successful attack on this position would have had a deplorable effect on the Mosul population, and would have constituted a menace to the garrison. This measure also tended to keep the restless Zibari and other tribes east of Amadia quiet. The main body of the Turkish force remained encamped in the Ashuta valley, their line of communication was still active, and, as reinforcements arrived at Julamerk, it appeared that some new objective was contemplated. On the 2nd and 3rd October Ashuta was heavily bombed, and considerable losses were inflicted on the Turks. In the meantime the Turkish Government had been warned that they must revert to the status quo at the time of signing the Lausanne Treaty, which necessitated the evacuation of ’Iraq territory then occupied by their troops. The Turks replied that they had no intention of attacking ’Iraq, but intimated that they intended to maintain their troops in ’Iraq territory up to the line of the former Mosul Vilayet, which they had reached on the 30th September. They also stated that the Nestorian punitive expedition had been completed, and that their main forces were being withdrawn from Assyrian territory.27 The question of the frontier line was referred to the League of Nations, and the Turks agreed not to advance southwards pending the decision. On the 29th October a provisional frontier between ’Iraq and Turkey was fixed by the Council of the League of Nations, which constituted the limit not to be transgressed by the civil and military authorities of either country. By the 19th November all the Turkish troops had been withdrawn north of the provisional boundary, and in December Jafar Tayar Pasha was relieved of the command of the Vllth Corps by Mursel Pasha, the G.O.C., 1st Cavalry Division. 1925.— Visit of the Frontier Commission of the League of Nations — Outbreak of the Kurdish Rebellion—Unrest in the Doski and Sindi Tribes—Deportations of Christians from Turkish Territory—The ■ Laidoner Commission—Settlement of the Turko- Iraq Frontier. The discussions at Lausanne regarding the frontier between Turkey and ’Iraq did not result in the determination of a frontier line, and provision was inserted in the Treaty of Peace with Turkey for (i) the frontier line to be laid down in friendly arrange ment between Turkey and Great Britain within nine months ; (ii) in the event of no agreement being reached within the time, the dispute to be referred to the Council of the League of Nations ; (iii) the Turkish and British Governments to undertake no military or other movement pending the decision. The negotiations between the two Governments, which took place at Constantinople from 19th May to the 9th June, 1924, were not successful, and the British Government then asked that the question should be placed on the agenda of the League. At its 30th session the Council noted the arguments setting forth the cases of the two Governments, and on the 30th September, 1924, decided to institute an inquiry on the spot. The Commission set up under the resolution of 30th September was composed of M. de Wirsen (Sweden), Count Teleki (Hungary) and Colonel Paulis (Belgium), who, after an exhaustive inquiry in the disputed territory from the middle of January to the middle of March, 1925, submitted its report to the Council at its meeting on the 3rd September, 1925. In January, 1925, Turkish troops returned to Goyan territory and established their headquarters at Karoar with a strong garrison. Civil officials were also imported, and it appeared that the Turks were about to take the tribe in hand and enforce their authority. Rebellion, which had been simmering for a long time, broke out among the Kurdish tribes in March on a large scale in the districts west of Mush, and martial law was proclaimed in the south-eastern vilayets of Mardin, Hakkiari, Bitlis and Van.28 \ To trace the origins of this rebellion it is necessary to hark back to the time of the armistice. In 1918 the ramifications of the Kurdish question were unknown, and did not develope until the following year. Kurdish national aspirations had been put forward by General Sharif Pasha in Paris ; and in January, 1919, a committee of Kurdish Inde pendence formed in Egypt appealed to us for help in the establishment of a Kurdish State. In April, 1919, a British officer, who had proceeded to Nisibin, reported that there was an active pro-Turkish party, which was anti-British, and side by side with it a pan-Kurdish party, the aim of which was the complete independence of Kurdistan. This Kurdish party, at first fairly subservient to the Turkish Government, became increasingly independent in its attitude. “ The tantalising version of President Wilson’s doctrine has slowly dawned upon them with all its alluring possibilities, and Turko-Kurds are now convinced that if they shout loud enough, President Wilson will hear them and allow them to mismanage Diarbekr by themselves and to continue to fatten on the Christian property, which they stole during the war, without having to share the spoil with the Turks ” (Major Noel’s report). The Ottoman Government regarded these clubs with increasing uneasiness, and finally suppressed them in June, 1919. As for the other Kurdish leaders, Shaikh Mahmud of Sulaimani had been eliminated by the failure of his rebellion ; Shaikh Mahmud of the Milli was a candidate for the hypothetical post of ruler of a united Kurdistan ; in Constantinople Abdul Qadir of Shemsdinan was ready to assume the same role, and the claims of the Bedr Khans, formerly rulers of Bohtan, were no less than his own ; while at a later date Sharif Pasha in Paris notified his election as head of a future Kurdish State, though there is no evidence to show that he was chosen by anyone but himself. In September Major Noel, who had carried out the previous mission to Nisibin, left Aleppo in company with two members of the Bedr Khan family. He reported that from Aintab to Malatia, the Kurds, who formed 70 to 80 per cent, of the population, were strongly imbued with Kurdish nationalist doctrines ; but, unlike the Kurds of Diarbekr and Mardin, they were anti-Turk. Mustafa Kemal’s Defence League took alarm at the mission on the ground that Major Noel was trying to create disturbance by working for an independent Kurdistan, which should be free from Ottoman control. Major Noel was then recalled, and the Kurdish National Society in Constantinople protested against the action of the Turks, and declared it to be an affront to Kurdish honour and national sentiment. The breach between the Kurdish and Turkish nationalist parties then became more pronounced, and Mustafa Kemal’s adherents closed all Kurdish clubs in Anatolia, taking severe measures against all those who were known to favour Kurdish independence.29 In its earlier stages the rebellion did not spread to the tribes on the ’Iraq frontier. The Turkish forces occupying garrisons bordering the frontier line evacuated their positions, and left for Jazirat-ibn-Omar and Diarbekr to assist in suppressing the revolt. On leaving Goyan territory they intimated that Turkey was again at war with Greece, and took hostages with them as a guarantee for the good behaviour of the tribe. The Turks transferred large reinforcements from their western commands to the Vllth Corps area to deal with the insurgents. With the agreement of the French authorities in Syria, use was made of the railway through Syrian territory, and between the 5th and 26th March 576 officers, 22,208 men, 935 horses and 163 camels along with considerable quantities of military stores, were drafted eastwards. By the end of March, the 7th Division of the Vth Corps from Adana arrived in the Diarbekr area and commenced operations against the rebels. A second squadron of aeroplanes, in addition to the one already with the Vllth Corps, arrived at the same time, possibly from Smyrna. Shaikh Said, the religious leader of the insurgents, was captured in April, and subsequently executed with a number of other Kurdish chiefs ; but the rebellion dragged on, and the Turks did not meet with the anticipated success in stamping it out. In their efforts to collect rifles from the tribes stubborn resistance was met with in the Kharput, Diarbekr, Van and Bitlis areas. In the middle of April Turkish forces returned to Goyan country from Sairt and established posts at Zarawak and Gadun. These were reinforced in May, as apprehensions were entertained of further outbreaks among the tribes'”owing to the escape of Abdul Rahman Agha of Shernakh from Diarbekr. One battalion was disposed at Shernakh, Besbin and Harbol; two other battalions were stationed in Goyan territory, and were used to garrison posts in the neighbourhood, from which they sent out parties to collect rifles and levy taxes. In addition to these troops, another detachment passed through to garrison Beit-esh- Shabab, while four small posts were also established on the frontier, north of the Narwa-Raikan area. A small party of Turkish troops was ambushed by a Goyan chief, Mirza Alo, while en route from Karoar to Ghlawa. The Turks therTaftempted to capture Mirza Alo, but he and a number of other chiefs with their families escaped to Zakho. In June, Saiyid Abdul Qadir, the notorious Kurdish nationalist, was captured and executed in Angora with his son, Saiyid Muhammad. Saiyid Abdul Qadir did not leave Constantinople until the outbreak of the revolt. He was said to be one of the organisers of the rebellion, which was precipitated by Shaikh Said, the original plans being thereby upset. It seems certain that the30 outbreak, when it took place, was premature, and that the plans of the leaders were not ripe. The second son of Saiyid Abdul Qadir, Saiyid Abdullah, succeeded in effecting his escape, took refuge in the Narwa- Raikan area within the ’Iraq frontier, and, with the assistance of tribesmen from the Herki and Girdi tribes, caused the Turks increasing annoyance. On the 24th June he attacked Neri and Naushehr and demanded the surrender of the garrisons, who gave up their arms and ammunition to the rebel chiefs. Saiyid Abdullah then proceeded to invest Shapatan, and was again successful in obtaining the surrender of the Turkish troops. A further attack on Turkish forces was made on the 21st July, four machine guns being captured and severe losses being inflicted. The Turks then undertook drastic measures to suppress the revolt, and heavily reinforced the area. Saiyid Abdullah was forced to flee, and again crossed the frontier into ’Iraq territory. The Herki were severely punished, no fewer than ten of their chiefs being executed. The revolt was now practically overcome ; but disaffection among the Herki and Girdi still prevailed, and Shapatan was again attacked on the 24th August by a force of some 300 tribesmen, who, having killed 16 men of the garrison, took refuge on the ’Iraq side of the frontier. During and subsequent to the visit of the Mosul Boundary Commission in March, 1925, considerable Turkish propaganda work was carried on among the northern tribes of the frontier areas. The Turks announced that they would be reoccupying the country soon, and that they would provide the tribes with men, arms and ammunition if they would rise against the ’Iraq Government. Colour to this propaganda was given by the arrival of reinforcements at Jazirat-ibn-Omar, and considerable discontent, and in some cases actual defiance, of Government authority resulted. The majority of the Doski became disaffected, but the situation was eased when one of their chiefs, Safar Agha, who had proceeded to Jazirat-ibn-Omar to obtain the promised arms, returned empty-handed. He and two other chiefs, Shafiq Agha and Reshid Agha, still remained defiant, however, and refused to report at Dohuk when ordered to do so. It was necessary to undertake air operations against Jamil Agha of the Sindi tribe, who had also succumbed to the Turkish promises and had attacked a police patrol between Shiranis and Masis, north-east of Zakho, on the 4th May. Several casualties were inflicted, and the majority of the Sindi submitted with the exception of the ringleader, Jamil Agha, who fled across the frontier to the Turks. The principal men of the Doski came in shortly afterwards and were imprisoned at Dohuk. In the middle of July, Jamil Agha displayed renewed activity, and with a tribal following attacked the village of Pirakh (N.N.E. of Zakho), which was entered and looted of a quantity of small arms ammunition. An attack on Shiranis was beaten off, and31 the rebel chief then proceeded to Shernakh to obtain farther assistance from the Turks, who were actively encouraging raiding activity. The chiefs of the Doski, who had meantime been released whilst still in a recalcitrant mood, immediately recommenced hostilities by raids on villages south-east of Zakho, and made overtures to the Turks, in which they met with little success. Later in the year the outlawed Doski returned to the 'Iraq side of the frontier, and endeavoured to intimidate the loyal villagers into returning with them to Turkish territory. The paramount chief, Said Agha of Germawa (four miles north of Dohuk), who had remained loyal, with the assistance of a force of police, forced the rebels to withdraw. A party of Sindi also carried out a raid in the Pirakh neigh bourhood, north of Zakho, but was beaten off by an 'Iraq army patrol with the loss of one prisoner. In June the Turks took vengeance on the Christians and Kurds in the Goyan district, who had testified to the Frontier Commission their desire to be included in 'Iraq, and a large number took refuge in Zakho. Early in September reports were received of atrocities committed on the Chaldean villages north and south of the frontier line. The inhabitants were systematically removed from the frontier, and were transported into the interior. Many, however, escaped and reached Zakho utterly destitute and with tales of massacre and violence. All their flocks and stocks of grain were confiscated by the Turkish troops, who stated that they were preparing for war and that the Christians could return after the conclusion of hostilities. Many of the refugee families were settled in villages on the 'Iraq side of the boundary line and also in districts removed from the frontier. The British Government made formal complaint and requested the Council of the League of Nations to send representatives to the locality of the frontier. The Council decided to send General F. Laidoner as its representative, and he was appointed chief of a Commission of inquiry. This Commission arrived at Mosul on the 30th October, 1925, and proceeded to take evidence regarding— (i) The complaint of the Turkish Government that British aircraft had crossed the Brussels Line. (ii) The deportation of Christians. The Commission was not permitted to make any investigation in the Turkish zone, but had to confine its activity to the territory south of the provisional frontier. General Laidoner found the British charges, on behalf of the Christians, substantiated, and stated that Turkish soldiers, under the command of officers, occupied all the villages and obtained delivery of the arms ; levied very heavy fines and demanded women ; pillaged the houses and submitted the inhabitants to32 \ atrocious acts of violence, going as far as massacre ; the deporta tions were deportations en masse, during which persons fell ill and were abandoned ; others died of starvation and cold, for, when leaving their homes, they had to abandon everything. The final decision relating to the Turko-Traq frontier was adopted by the Council of the League of Nations on the 16th December, 1925, by which (i) all territory south of the so-called Brussels Line was allocated to ’Iraq ; (ii) the British Government was invited to submit to the Council a new treaty with ’Iraq ensuring the continuance for 25 years of the mandatory regime defined by the Treaty of Alliance between Great Britain and 'Iraq, unless ’Iraq were admitted as a member of the League ^ before the expiration of that period ; (iii) the British Government was invited to act, as far as possible, in accordance with the other suggestions of the Commission as regards measures likely to ensure pacification and to afford equal protection to all elements of the population ; and (iv) the British Government was also invited to lay before the Council the administrative measures to be taken with a view to securing for the Kurdish population the guarantees recommended by the Commission in its final conclusions. \921o.—Rebellion among the Kurdish Tribes on the Turko-’ Iraq Frontier—Suppression of the Revolt and Punitive Measures —Activity of the Rebel Sindi. In the beginning of 1926 another insurrection broke out among the Kurdish tribes in the Diarbekr-Sairt area. The disaffection was said to be largely due to the new religious and other restrictions imposed by the Turkish Government. During the last half of the previous year there had been sporadic risings in the same districts following upon attempts to disarm the tribes. The Turks immediately commenced punitive operations and independent tribunals were set up in Diarbekr and Angora, with unlimited powers, to deal with the rebel leaders who were captured. Practically a clean sweep was made of the tribal chieftains in the Bohtan-Sairt-Shernakh areas. Those who were not executed at once were removed to imprisonment in distant parts of Anatolia. A number escaped into ’Iraq territory, amongst whom was Naif Beg, who brought nearly all the nomadic tribe of the Miran with him. The disaffection spread to the tribes on the ’Iraq frontier. The chief of the Haverki, Hajo Agha, attacked and captured the posts of the 8 th Frontier Battalion in the Nisibin area ; but, energetic measures being taken against him, he was forced to flee into Syrian territory A general collection of rifles from the frontier tribes was then undertaken, and in the first week of April the Goyan, ever restless, rose and attacked the garrisons of Karoar and Segirk. The(C 16145) c outbreak began by an encounter between the Turkish Mudir of Goyan and a small party of tribesmen. The Mudir, escorted by 20 soldiers, ordered the Goyanis to hand over their rifles. The tribesmen refused, whereupon the Mudir’s party opened fire and killed two men. The Goyanis retaliated and disarmed the Mudir’s escort, killing three of them. The outbreak then become general throughout the Goyan, and refugees in great numbers crossed the frontier into ’Iraq territory for safety. Disaffection was not confined to this district. In the Bitlis area, tribal forces amounting to some 4,000 rifles, were in active resistence to the Turks, who had put to death the great majority of the religious and tribal leaders in the Van- Bitlis area. The ranks of the insurgents were added to by the arrival of contingents from the Geravi and Zhirki sections of the Artushi Kurds, and through the month of April the rebellion showed no signs of abating. The town of Deh, south-east of Sairt, fell into the hands of the rebels, who captured over 600 rifles and a large quantity of military stores. In the Goyan area Karoar had to be evacuated by the Turkish garrison, who abandoned everything. On the 19th April, Julamerk was captured by the Artushi, but was speedily recaptured by the Turks. Although the rebellion was now widespread in the area to the north of the ’Iraq frontier, the whole movement lacked cohesion. There was no co-operation between the various leaders, each chief acting independently of the other; and, although Turkish garrisons had been captured, they were invariably small and in some cases consisted of gendarmes only. The Shernakh remained neutral, and were not drawn into the rising. The Turks suffered no defeat on a large scale. On 28th April the Turks commenced operations against the rebels. The Goyan tribesmen, who had remained in Turkish territory, were offered terms of submission if they would hand over rifles and certain wanted individuals. They refused to accept, and Turkish aeroplanes then began the destruction of villages in the disaffected area. Great energy was displayed in suppressing the revolt, and by the end of May it was virtually over. The rebellious Artushi chiefs fled into ’Iraq and took refuge near Amadia. In July about 4,000 persons from the Goyan, who had sought refuge in ’Iraq, returned to Turkish territory, and were not molested beyond fines of rifles being levied from the chiefs. The Artushi were not so fortunate. On a promise of amnesty they were induced to return to their own districts ; but, on arrival, the chiefs were arrested and deported to Angora, where they were executed some months later in circumstances which suggested a treacherous disregard for the sanctity of safe-conduct. Meanwhile the rebel Sindi had shown some slight activity. In May a party some 20 strong fired on an ’Iraq army patrol34 protest to the T '*jf ^'owarL^Tnd offtrye'ar were permitted to return to their homes. 1907 Operations against Shaikh Ahmad of B arza1 ^E x ff e °f Ahmad Begok-Kurds in Turkey-FronUer DehnntaUon Commission. During 1927 the main incident in the ’Iraq portion of Central Kurdistan was created by Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan r^o as already shown, had been the cause of much unrest in his district for several years past. In 1925 the area over which Shaikh Ahmad hoids imme xate swav was brought under the nominal administration of the ’Iraq Government. Such as it was, the control was irksome to a man who had been in the habit of having a free hand in exacting tribute from his own and neighbouring tribes. Thus in 1927 in consequence of the indifferent state of affairs in the Zibar district, it was decided to tighten up the administration there, and to bring the area more completely under Government control. With a man like Shaikh Ahmad it wa f. obvious + tha ^ at r J i ^ + S ^ show of force would be a necessary preliminary to the putt g of this policy into practice. Accordingly, combined military and aeriS operations took place, in which two small columns of Levies occupied Barzan in June, and Shaikh Ahmad and his followers fled to the neighbouring hills. Thereupon a sma garrison was left at Barzan, and a landing ground prepared near that place. As was to be expected, however, the complete subjugation of Shaikh Ahmad and his foUwers was not to be accomplished by a single effort. He continued to levy taxes on neighbouring tribes, and to instigate incidents prejudicial to the smooth running of t e district. One such incident occurred on 1st September, when his mulla, Abdul Rahman, was murdered by the Shaikh’s brother m Barzan. Although Shaikh Ahmad subsequently expressed his willingness to assist in settling the case, he did nothing. In consequence ol his refusal to pay a fine, on which previous agreement had been reached, a company of Levies was despatched to Barzan this romnanv marched through his villages on 18th and 21st October,but the Shaikh still refused to pay the fine, or to carry out a promised meeting with Government representatives. Moreover, he became distinctly threatening. On 24th October an air demonstration was made over his headquarters. The following day he paid the fine. The only other operational incident in Northern Traq was complementary to Shaikh Ahmad’s affair. Ahmad Begok, a small Kurdish chief just north of Rowanduz and~a devotee of Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan, refused to acknowledge Government. In consequence a small party of Levies from Diana, accompanied by irregular police, set out for his village on 7th December in order to arrest him. A small fight ensued, during which Ahmad Begok made good his escape, since when he had been an exile at large. In 1928 he went across the border and joined the Turks. During 1927 the Turks continued repressive measures against Kurdish tribal leaders, who had taken part in the revolts of the two previous years, by means of the Independent Tribunal at Diarbekr. A considerable number of Kurds are stated to have been sentenced to death and to imprisonment for life. One or two Shernakh and Goyan chiefs came to a fatal end as a result of this tribunal. Recent indications, however, tend to show a reversal of Turkish policy towards the Kurds. It appears that a process of conciliation, accompanied by an improved administration, is gradually taking the place of hard repressive methods hitherto employed. The year was marked by a noteworthy achievement in the fixation of the permanent northern frontier by the Turco-Traq Frontier Delimitation Commission. The Commission started work on 20th March and finished by signing the report on 23rd September. During this period 58 meetings were held, and 99 boundary stones erected. The area surveyed was divided into six sectors, and totalled roughly 1,321 square miles on both sides of a line some 236 miles in length. The triangulation involved the fixing of 41 stations, all of which was done”by the British section of the survey party. Although it cannot be said that the discussions of the Commission were always of the most cordial, it is noteworthy that no actual incidents specially worth recording occurred, and that the administrative arrangements for a large party over extremely difficult country were executed without a hitch. The whole task was undoubtedly a very fine achievement. 1928 .—Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan quiet—Kurdist Amnesty — Simko joins the Turks. Up to July, 1928, there was no particularly noteworthy event in Central Kurdistan. The presence of a garrison at Barzan had a sobering effect on the district. Shaikh Ahmad showed a steady resentment of the curtailment of his autocracy by a vacillating demeanour.36 \ One week truculent, the other conciliatory, he thus addressed himself to Government officials until he actually attended a meeting with the Administrative Inspector of Mosul on 31st March. There a settlement was reached regarding his powers and the area which he might administer. Although he deliberately and publicly misrepresented the terms in his favour shortly after wards, his conduct since has not been such as to require armed intervention. In the spring of this year the Turkish Government published the terms of the amnesty to Kurds, who had been implicated in revolts against the State. Although apparently this amnesty does not apply to Kurdish refugees in ’Iraq as a whole, one or two important exiles have sought and obtained permission to return to their homes. In this connection Ismail Agha (Simko), though not coming within the above category as he is a Persian Kurd, was pardoned by the Turks in May and allowed to take up an abode in Kastern Turkey. For several years he was in sporadic revolt against the Persian Government, not to mention freebooting efforts in Turkey, and was consequently not a welcome guest when he took refuge in ’Iraq. Here for over a year he made himself a nuisance, and, by his very unrehability and explosiveness, was a potentially dangerous man among Kurdish tribes. Whatever Turkey s motive may be in taking back Simko, and it is much open to doubt, it seems evident that the Turks are now making a real effort to pacify the Kurds within their borders. Naturally it is too early to see results, but it is considered that such a policy can only have a beneficial reaction in the ’Iraq portion of Central Kurdistan.c 3 (C 16145) CHAPTER II. POPULATION. Distribution of Races. Central Kurdistan is inhabited by races of varying nationality and religious denomination. The majority are Kurds. The Christian population, which prior to the war inhabited the region about the basin of the Greater Zab, has been greatly reduced, and in some areas, notably in Hakkiari, has disappeared altogether. In Iraq territory the tendencylsTor the Christian population to increase owing to the persecutions in Turkey. Chaldeans from Turkish territory have fled in large numbers, and have been settled as far as possible in villages and empty spaces in the valleys and foothills bordering the Mosul plain. The Kurdish population also suffered greatly from the Russian invasion in the war period ; and large areas are but spa rsely inhabited. The country north of Rowanduz has not yet recovered from the devastation which took place. The habitable parts are confined to the valleys, between the parallel ranges of mountains. The rich valleys, through which streams run all the year round, support a considerable population. The poorer and more elevated districts are inhabited by peoples who are in many cases nomadic, and who migrate to the plains with their flocks and herds to escape the rigours of the severe winter. &lt; C_ There are no census figures available of recent date to indicate the population of the areas under Turkish control. The table on next page is an estimate of the numbers by races within 'Iraq territory and their distribution. 1. Races. Kurds .—The Kurds keep to the hills and scarcely cross at all to the right bank of the Tigris. An important exception is the Miran, who come down to the Northern Jazirah for the winter. As a general rule, however, the plains are left to the Arab, whether nomad or settled. A large proportion of Kurds are pure nomands living in tents all the year round, while others, who live in villages, leave their houses and live in tents or shelters on the higher altitudes for the summer months. The nomands spend the' summer with their flocks on the summits of the great ranges, descending in the autumn to lower lying country near Jazirat-ibn-Omar and north of Mosul. Distinct from the nomadic and tribal element is the “ ryot ” class, who are peaceful, ignorant cultivators without any idea38 beyond the sowing of seed and the reaping of crops. They possess no political intelligence or ambition beyond the desire to live under a secure government, which will remove the necessity of “Aghawat ” protection—a burden which has crippled agriculture and made their lives only just tolerable. The Agha corresponds to the feudal baron of mediaeval times, and possesses the power of life and death over his serfs. In spite, or perhaps because, of the system, the Kurd is very faithful to his master, and modern democratic slogans are quite unknown to him. Table 1.

It is not practicable to dissect the population and therefore total numbers for the Qadha are given. About 90,000 are contained in the town of Mosul itself, which is predominantly Arab in character. The Kurd follows three callings, that of the fighter, the cultivator, and the shepherd, despising handicraft and commerce, Which he leaves to the Christians*and Jews. As a race they are, like most hill people, averse to settled forms of government. Generally ignorant owing to past circum stances, they do not favour opportunities for learning by the selfsame distrust of the paraphernalia of a modern administration. Extremely hospitable in its widest sense, they have a code of honour, which, however, has been b esmirc hed on more than one occasion by individuals, and has thus led them sometimes to be erroneously termed treacherous. The Kurd is notoriously quick- teihpered, and it is probably the violence of this trait which has been the cause of isolated lapses from his somewhat rough sensec 4 (C 16145) of honour. Of a superstitious nature and inclined to self-depreca tion, certain elements of the Kurds are under the influence of dervishes, who are not averse to allowing the natural lawlessness of their devotees to degenerate into acts of barbarity. The Kurds are not deficient in martial spirit, but have a dislike for the restraints of militaiyBiscipline. They are useful to a force operatingnTthe country owing to their knowledge of the mountains, and can be of value as scouts and^guides. Their mode of con ducting tribal warfare gifesThem a fair idea of infantry training ; and when organised, regularly paid, and well led, they are capable of forming an efficient force. They have often been classed as fighters with tribesmen of the North-West Frontier of India. But in reality they are nothing like so effective in marksmanship, tenacity, speed in following up an advantage, and general tactical capacity. Still, the Kurd can be quite a formidable enemy. As regards physique, the weaklings are practically all weeded out in the first few years of life, and it is chiefly the fittest who survive to manhood. They are, in consequence, a strong, well- developed people. Assyrians .—The Assyrians, following the Kurds, are the next important element in the inhabitants of Central Kurdistan. Before the Great War they totalled between 80,000 and 100,000 souls ; their present numbers are about 16,000. Their former country lay roughly from a point just north of Amadia eastwards to Lake Urumieh ; and, although mostly nominal subjects of the Ottoman Empire, their form of government was to all intents and purposes autonomous. The secular and religious head of the Assyrian nation, as they are usually styled, is their Patriarch named Mar Shimun, “ Patriarch of the East.” The collapse of Russia in 1917 was mainly responsible for a general exodus from their own country of the Assyrians, who had from the early days sided with the Allies. After many adversities they reached Traq, where the vast majority have remained until the present time. The Assyrians were, like the mountain Kurd, cultivators and shepherds, but since their sojourn in Traq many have taken up artisan and domestic occupanons and have enlisted in the Imperial forces. Their fighting value is considerable, and is g£hefally recognised as being the best in Traq. Although not as a rule well educated, a large proportion of the Assyrian men have received a sound military training in all ranks in the Traq Levies, which has undoubtedly added to their natural martial capacity. The remarks in the foregoing paragraph are chiefly applicable to the tribal Assyrians, who'were formerly Turkish subjects. As mentioned above, however, the country of the Assyrians extended eastwards to Lake Urumieh. Thus a considerable number of the Assyrian race were Persian subjects, and a fair proportion still are. Although all belonging to the same race, those from the40 Ummieh district are usually distinguished by the appellation of Urumian Assyrians. There are at present about 2,000 Assyrians living in the Urumieh district and about 1,500 Urumian Assyrians living in ‘Iraq. The Tergawar and Mergawar sub-sections of the Nauchia (under the leadership of Mar Yosef the Metropolitan now domiciled in Iraq) were formerly Persian subjects. The Urumian Assyrian is not, generally speaking, of martial spirit, and so cannot be classed with the hill tribe Assyrian in this respect, but, being intelligent and industrious, is often, like the Armenian, a skilled artisan and mechanic. A full description of the Assyrians is contained in Chapter IX, page 196, of this volume. Yezidis .—A full description of the Yezidis as a whole is given in Military Report of Mesopotamia (’Iraq), Area No. 1 (Northern Jazirah), in which area the majority of the race is to be found. The Yezidis in Central Kurdistan form a single community which dwells in the Shaikhan district, north-east of Mosul. They are coittmonly known as Devil Worshippers, and are for the most part sedentary and engaged in agriculture. The origin, religion and naffonality of this tribe is exceedingly obscure, but there is no doubt that the Yezidis are not Moslems. ' It is equally clear that they are not related to the Arabs or to the Turks. They have some affinities with the Kurds, as they speak Kurmanji, a Kurdish patois ; and it is possible that they had to some extent common ancestors. Those living in the Shaikhan district are industrious, civil ’and ‘amenable to government, but low in the scale of intelligence, education and morality. Unlike the inhabitants of the Jabal-Sinjar, they display no aptitude for war. They are well disposed to the Christians. Arabs.—The Arabs included in the area chiefly consist of scattered encampments of Hadidiyin. They are the shepherds of Mosul, the large sheep-owners^giving them their flocks to tend. They are looked down upon by the Badawin, and have a reputation for cowardice. Jews .— The Jews of Central Kurdistan are said to be refugees from Nineveh or original settlers after the fall of Samaria. They are found exclusively in the towns, where they are engaged in handicraft, commerce and money-lending. In Central Kurdistan theyTave little of the prosperous appearance of their bretheren in Baghdad, and are the objects of bitter contempt on the part of the non-commercial Kurd. Chabacs and Bejwans .—The Chabacs and Bejwans are two communities living north-east and south-east of Mosul. They possess about 47 villages. The two sects are of Kurdish origin and are robust, tall and of dark complexion. They are dishonest, violent and treacherous. Their religious practices are the same as those of the extreme Shiahs. The Chabacs hold Ali, the Imamof the Shiahs, in high veneration, but they also take part in the religious ceremonies of the Yezidis. 2. Religions. Kurds .—The Kurds of Central Kurdistan are of the Sunni Shafi’ite denomination. Nestorians {Assyrians ).—The Nestorians are the remnants of the great Nestorian Church, which was founded in the first century when the Arsacid Kings of Parthia were dominant in Mesopotamia and Persia. It attained a large development under the Sassanid Empire, Ctesiphon becoming eventually the seat of its premier Bishop. Nestorian is merely another name for Assyrian, although it is perhaps employed more when referring to them in religious matters. Contrary to the majority of the Christian sects in Traq, the Nestorian do not look to Rome for guidance. Their leanings are towards Protestantism, and they have been for years under the aegis of the Archbishop of Canterbury. A fuller description of the Assyrians and their religion is given in Chapter IX, page 196, of this volume. Chaldeans .—The Chaldeans are Romanized Nestorians who dwell in the Mosul plain, Bohtan and Amadia. Their Patriarch is Mar Emmanuel, who bears the title of Patriarch of Babylon, and lives in Mosul. The Chaldeans inhabiting Phe lowlands have a more developed civilisation, since they are more often in contact with the better educated population of the towns. They possess schools maintained principally by France and Rome. Their clergy are trained mostly in the French Dominican Seminary in Mosul. There is a tendency, which is now decreasing, to look to France, due possibly to the fact that our policy before the war was to protect the Nestorians. The connection with Rome is strong, however. The Chaldean villages of the plain can easily be distinguished from Arab, Turkish or Kurdish villages, from which they afford welcome relief, on account of their cleanliness. The Chaldeans have not the same aptitude for war as the Nestorians, and are on fairly good terms with their Kurdish neighbours. Many of the men, especially from the district of Tel Kaif, have migrated to the other towns of Traq, and are to be found as hotel-keepers, waiters and servants. Jacobites .—The formal title of the Jacobite Church is “ The Syrian Orthodox Church.” The name Jacobite comes down from the 6 th century Bishop Jacob Baradai, the organiser of the Monophysite Church in Mesopotamia and Syria. The Jacobites were formerly most numerous in and around Mardin, but during and since the war they were compelled to flee to Aleppo to escape Turkish persecution. The Jacobites of Mosul and the Jabal Maklub are the most easterly representatives of this church. The Patriarch is styled42 “ Patriarch of Antioch ” ; and, since his expulsion from the monastery at Deir Zaferan, near Mardin, has lived in Syria. The church is represented in Mosul by a Bishop, the present dignitary being Mar Shonea. Syrian Catholic Church .—This is an offshoot from the Syrian Orthodox or Jacobite Church. It is also ruled by a Patriarch of Antioch who has his residence in Beyrout. The church is represented in Mosul by a Bishop. The Jacobite or Syrian Orthodox Church and the Syrian Catholic Church affords a parallel to the Nestorian and Chaldean Churches. 3. Languages. A variety of languages is spoken in Central Kurdistan, of which the most important is Kurdish. The Nestorians, Chaldeans and Jews speak Syriac and Kurdish. The merchants and official classes use Arabic, but understand Kurdish equally well. As the whole population is acquainted with Kurdish, only interpreters speaking this language are necessary for forces operating in the area. 4. Education. Within recent years there has been a great increase in the number of schools in Central Kurdistan. Schools are divided into three grades, viz., primary, secondary and final, each religion having its own establishments. The proportion of Christian to Muhammedan pupils is very much greater than that of Christian to Muslim inhabitants. The Christian schools are considerably more progressive than those of the other religions. Schools have been established in the Shaikhan district; but the Yezidis do not favour education, and attendance is poor although there are Yezidi teachers. In the tribal areas it is generally only the “Agha ” or chief tan class and the priesthood who have any education, the ordinary Kurd being quite illiterate. There is, in consequence, plenty of scope for the professional letter-writer 5. Labour. Unskilled Labour .—The formation of a labour corps from the settled Kurdish population would be a most difficult matter. There is no shortage so far as the agricultural population is con cerned, but the tribal Kurd is averse to any form of work other than that of the cultivator or sKepherd. He is naturally lazy and disinclined to workThore than is necessary to achieve a liveli hood for himself and his family. In addition to this factor, there43 are several considerations which cause the labour market to a fluctuate, and make any general estimate quite unreliable. Such nt considerations are— (i) The district where labour is to be employed.—Men are n averse to working far from their homes, and the amount }{ oflabour available naturally varies with districts, is (ii) The time of year when it is required.—During the greater part of the summer the sowing and reaping of crops n are in full swing, and practically no labour is then ii available for other work. At other times the demand for labour is correspondingly slack. (iii) The rates of pay.—A certain amount of labour could always be attracted at enhanced wages. It may, however, be safely assumed that 1,000 men from the Assyrian and other Christian refugees could be raised to form a labour corps for work in any part of Traq Central Kurdistan,, provided that the corps was given some kind of military status. This would be an important consideration, especially with those men who have served in the Traq Levies. In view of the foregoing factors the figures given for unskilled labour by districts in Table 2 should only be taken as a very rough average guide. Skilled Labour .—There is a distinct deaj^h of skilled labour in the area under review, although the advent of modern machinery, etc., is naturally increasing the artisan class. The Baz Assyrians are considered to be very competent stonemasons, and many of the better houses have been built by themr They have also an equal reputation as blacksmiths. Table 2 indicates approximately numbers of skilled workers by trades and districts. Table 2. Labour available in different Districts. District. Skilled Labour. Unskilled Labour. Masons. . Carpenters.

Attitude of Races towards each other. Relations between the Nestorians and the Kurds are not very cordial. The fault lies with the Nestorians themselves owing to want of tact and the rudeness of their manners. Generally speaking, however, the Kurds, warlike and undis ciplined as they are, live on very fair terms with the other races inhabiting their country. They do not come much into touch with the few Arabs in Central Kurdistan, but there is a growing national consciousness, which may cause a rift between the two races in the future. The religion of the Yezidis has involved them in great difficulties and persecution. As a result they abhor Muslims, but profess sympathy^with the Christians. The Jews are almost universally despised, but when it becomes a question of raising a loan or giving security, it is to the Jew that the rich Agha will go. Attitude to Foreigners and Europeans .—The Kurds of Central Kurdistan are now, generally speaking, anti-Turk. The former leanings which they entertained for them (inspired not a little by fear and uncertainty as to the future government of their districts) were disturbed somewhat by the sumptuary laws of the Angora Government and by the suppression ofthe dervish shrines. Later, the settlement of the frontier tended to alleviate this feeling except in the case of individual die-hards, buT a slight reaction has set in during 1928 as a result of the conciliatory policy, which the Turks have recently initiated. The Indian native, Moslem or Hindu, cannot be said to be regarded with any great favour. They are employed in Govern ment offices, and thereby the local people consider that they are being deprived of a livlihood. They are, however, being gradually eliminated. Syrian refugees and deportees have worked to the disadvantage of France in the towns. The' unfriendly sentiment thus produced to that nation has not spread to the tribal districts, as they are not interested in such remote questions. The tendency of the Romanized Catholics to look towards France and Rome for support is dying out since the occupation of the country by the British. All races in Central Kurdistan, with the exception of a dis gruntled minority and a few extreme Nationalists, who are hostile to the idea of a mandatory power, are imbjied with a strong pro-British inclination. Other European peoples are seldom encountered, apart from the official visits and tours of the League of Nation’s Committees, and no unfriendliness exists. 7. Normal Diet. Rice is the staple food of all classes. Its quality varies in the different districts, that of Barwari-Bala being the best. TheAghawat have two big meals daily, the first before noon and the second at sunset. The food consists of vegetable broth, eggs, rice, boiled mutton or chicken. The poorer classes cannot afford to buy meat, and subsist on bread, eggs, rice and vegetables. All classes drink milk at their meals. Europeans being entertained in the house of an Agha should be careful to conform to the customs and etiquette of the country. The host should be invited to have food with his visitors. He will probably refuse, but the invitation will please him.I47 CHAPTER III. \ POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY. 1. Area and General Description. Central Kurdistan has an area estimated to be about 25,000 square miles, and is divided naturally into three main geographical areas, namely, the central and south-eastern area around the basin of the Greater Zab ; the southern districts of the basins of Lake Van, Lake Archak and Lake Urumieh ; the basins of the Khabur, the Bohtan and other tributaries of the Tigris, which form the western and south-western part of the area. The Basin of the Greater Zab—The Zab valley is a wild, mountainous country inhabited by Kurds, Nestorians and Chaldeans. The upper part of the valley below Julamerk consists of rugged limestone mountains rising to an altitude of 14,000 ft., whose general direction is east to west. The river runs through them in a north to south direction. Its numerous tributaries are also mountain torrents, and are in high flood during the months of April to June, when they are swollen by snow water. The country is almost treeless, although there are a few poplars in some of the valleys. Oaks and walnut trees are found occasionally. The soil is unfertile, and the hihsides are so steep that most of the cultivation is terraced. There is a fair amount of grazing for sheep and goats f and, in the late spring and early summer, nomad Kurds and the local inhabitants bring their flocks to the “ yailas ” or summer grazing grounds for three or four months. The winter is severe, and many of the passes and higher tracks are closed by snow for several months in the year, while snow avalanches render some of the lower roads unsafe in the spring. lit summer the heat is considerable,/out not so great as to interfere with the movements of travellers. The middle part of the Zab basin consists of sandstone hills rising to altitudes of 8,000 ft., which are well wooded with oaks, walnut, sycamore and hawthorn. It is a fertile district, which could support a large population under a stable and just administration. The lower part of the Zab basin, after it has left the mountains, is an undulating plain, well cultivated and producing rice, wheat and barley in considerable quantity. Country South of the Lakes—The hill country south of Lake Van and Lake Archak is comparatively barren, and has no natural vegetation except grass. The altitude of the highest ranges is about 8,000 ft. Before the war there was a large Armenian and Christian population; but, owing to the deportations and massacres from 1915 onwards, the Kurds are now left practically in sole possession.The Vilayet of Hakkiari.

The frontier between Turkey and ’Iraq is that which was demarcated by the Frontier Delimitation Commission. It was finally fixed on 23rd September, 1927 (see Chapter I, page 35). It may be divided into four sectors :— (i) Between the Hazil and Khabur rivers. (ii) Between the Khabur and Jelu heights. (iii) The broken country between this district and the Shemsdinan river. (iv) From the Shemsdinan river to the Persian frontier. Sector 1.—The Hazil is a small stream, which provides a con ventional frontier for a short distance. The Khabur above Zakho carves its way with many bends and racing torrents through con glom erates and calcareous formations. At ZakEo the valley opens out and becomes very wide. The spurs of the chain falling sheer on to the southern bank of the Khabur add a further obstacle to that consituted by the river ; but they still leave a sufficiently large opening on the southern side'of the Tigris. Sector 2.—This is a still more mountainous and inaccessible country, the summits being in some cases over 10,000 ft. The Greater Zab cuts its path through these mountains, forming gorges sometimes 5,000 ft. deep. This mountain system is crossed by very few passes. Between Geramus and Dera Jj^ri there is only one pass, which the nomad Artushi use w^ien going up with their sheep to the summer pastures. Another road leads from Ashita along the gorge of the Zab to Lizin and Jularaerk. All the roads are nothmg more than mountain tracks only used for local communications.50 Sector 3—This sector consists of confused mountains running back to the summits of Jehi&gt; Sat and Ch^hr-Chpli. No nomad route crosses this sectorT' whilst the few existing tracks pass through so wild-and steep a country that they could only be used for the passage of flocks with the greatest difficulty. Sector 4 is an absolutely abandoned district crossed by only two roads. These are the routes leading from K anLResh through the Zinia Bari Gedik pass to Neri and from Rowanduz into PersiaTfirough theTTadir pass, where the frontiers of ’Iraq, Turkey and Persia meet. Seen from an aeroplane some distance from the south the mountain groups give the impression of a wall. The northern groups, along the crests of which the frontier partly runs, form the highest limit of the country, which rises from the plains of ’Iraq in successive elevations of foothills and parallel chains. Ethnically it is not a complete line of separation and still less a barrier. In the western and eastern mountain groups, both to the north and south, the inhabitants are Kurds belonging to the same or related tribes. Various nomad tribes, e.g., the Artushi and Herki, cross these mountains every year. Strategical Considerations. —The mountain area north of the frontier between the river Hazil and the Persian border does not lend itself to the concentration of troops ; the approaches from this region to the south consist entirely of roads and tracks, which are difficult in summer and impassable in winter. Even so it cannot be quite ruled out as an impassable area from which an offensive might be launched. A more practicable line of advance in this area is from points between Jazirat-ibn-Omar and the river Hazil via Zakho. This, however, presents several disadvantages to a modern army, including the passage of the rivers Khabur or Hazil and the mountain range immediately south of Zakho. The most likely area of concentration for a force invading Traq from the north is obviously further west, i.e., in the country enclosed by Diarbekr, Bitlis and Mardin. This area is served from the west by the so-called “ Baghdad ” railway ending at Nisibin, and presents a clear line of advance—only requiring the violation of a small portion of Syrian territory—down the right bank of the Tigris. This sector, however, although adjacent to Central Kurdistan, is actually outside the area covered by this volume. The Turco-Persian Frontier. —The cregt line of the mountains west and south-west of Lake Urumieh forms a natural boundary between Turkey and Persia, which was fixed by a mixed Com mission in 1914. This mountain chain is pigrced by routes, which are important as communications to the plain of Urumieh and to Persian Azerbaijan.51 Of these, a road, passable for wheels, runs from B^shkala via Deir and Khanesur to Oilman in the Salmas plain, andttience to Khoi, Tabriz 'Shd Urumidhr ' Another route into Persia, passable for wheels, leads from Bashkala to Diza in the Gawar plain, and then via Bajirga into the Urumieh plain. ^ A third road, at present under construction, will run from Rowanduz to Rayat and Ushnu and thence to Urumieh and Tabriz. In view of the embargo placed on Persian exports to Russia, it is hoped that this route will become of some importance as an alternative outlet for the produce of Persian Azerbaijan and the Urumieh plain, two of the most fertile and most productive districts in Persia. 4. Towns. A1 Qosh. A1 Qosh is situated some 30 miles north of Mosul in the foot hills, which mark without gradation the northern end of the plains and the beginning of the mountains. The town is built on the slopes of the first ridge, the streets being steep and narrow, impassable for any wheeled traffic. The hills behind are bare and devoid of vegetation. The population numbers about 3,700, the great majority being Chaldean Catholics. About 40 families of Chaldean refugees from Turkey and 57 families of Nestorians have been settled in A1 Qosh and the vicinity. The town has a small bazaar consisting of some 50 shops. The houses, 550 in number, are solidly built of stone, but are small and unsuited for billeting purposes. Water Supply .—Water is obtained from two large wells in the town. They are not over-clean, and there is danger of pollution. There are also 19 smaller wells, from which drinking water can be obtained. Billets .—The church could be utilised as a billet for half company of infantry. The Monastery of A1 Qosh, about one mile east of the town, could billet one company, and has an independent water supply. This building might also be used as a hospital, as it is clean and in good repair. Supplies .—All products are consumed locally, and additional supplies are obtained from Mosul. Aerodrome Site .—Space for a landing ground is available south of the monastery. The surface is hard, and would have to be cleared of stones. Camping Site .—A camping site for a brigade is available in the vicinity of the monastery.52 Grazing .—There is ample grazing between March and May in the plain below A1 Qosh. • Amadia. Population about 3,000. Situated 65 miles north by east of Mosul. The town is built on a rocky plateau, an outlier from the southern edge of the steep and lofty Ser Amadia. The plateau, which is connected with the range’by a narrow rocky coll, is oval in shape, 1,400 yards long and 550 yards broad. Tts slopes m the upper part rise in abrupt cliffs 50-80 ft. high, whilst the lower levels are steep and boulder-strewn. Two narrow paths lead up to the town and enter ifby gateways, one on the west side of the plateau and the other on the north-east side. The town lies at the north end of the plateau, and is partially in ruins. The remainder of the available space is occupied by a cemetery. At the south end of the plateau is a ruined Kurdish castle, formerly owned by the Pashas of Amadia, with a masonry wall and two bastions 3-4 ft. thick and 20 ft. high. The wall is drawn across the plateau. Along the edge of the cliff is a low masonry wall with embrasjires and loopholes with a good command over the country to the south. At present the headquarters of the Qaimmaqam of Amadia, the town will lose its importance if the proposed removal of the centre of local government to another and more convenient locality materializes. The houses are mostly built of rough stone, but are very small and quite unsuited for billeting with the exception of the police serai, which could accommodate about 70 British troops. xyi Government Buildings .—The administrative headquarters are contained in the police serai, on the eastern edge of the plateau. Hospitals, Offices .-—Other than the serai, there is an excellent building near the village of Bebadi, which was originally built as an English mission house.' It contains about 20 rooms, and could be used as offices, a hospital or as a billet. Two hundred and fifty British troops could be accommodated comfortably. This building is 2| miles west of Amadia town. Water Supply .—The water supply of Amadia is poor. There are no wells giving water now on the plateau, and the supply is dependent on two springs half-way down the cliffs, near the two gates. The supply in summer is weak. At the foot of the plateau there is a stream from which an ample supply is available all the year round. Supplies .—The Amadia district scarcely produces enough for the needs of the inhabitants, and demand has to be made on the surplus products of the Dohuk area.Am ad i a (from the South).53 Local products are :— Available Annual Production. for Military.

Camping Grounds .—Scattered camping grounds for two com panies can be found between the southern wall and the town. Water supply is a difficulty for this site. At B ebad i there are two possible camping grounds both favourably located for water supplies. There is sufficient space for a brigade. A summer camp is available on the top of the Ser Amadia (6,000 ft.) for one battalion. Grazing .—Ample in the Amadia valley. Aqra. Aqra lies about 65 miles to the north-east of Mosul. It is a town of some 800 houses with a population of 4,000. The inhabitants are predominantly Kurd, but there are 40 families of Jews and 20 of Chaldean Christians also domiciled in the town. The Jews, like their brethren elsewhere, possess many of the shops, and are famous for their manufacture of silver scabbards for the Kurdish dagger. Behind Aqra a series of steep-pitched ridges run back to the main mountain chain of the A qra Dag h. Crests are cut by deep gorges strewn by large boulders. One of the most prominent of these ridges breaks down into a saddle, which rises again to a rocky knolTbefore its final descent to the plain. Across this saddle hang the houses of Aqra with ruined fragments of its ancient citadel crowning the highest point of the rocky ridge above. Thef bulk of the town overflows into the ravine on the western side, where the houses are ranged round the sweep of the hollow like the seats of an amphitheatre. The slopes on which they lie are so steep that the roof of each house serves as the front yard of the one immediately above and behind it. The54 A streets are very narrow and steep with the exception of the road leading to the Police Serai, which is fit for Ford cars. To the east of the town are some pleasant gardens, which give welcome relief from the heat of summer. Aqra is not a very healthy place. Malaria is prevalent, and in summer it is hot. It is possible, however, to remove to the higher altitudes of the Aqra Dagh to Sherman, where the Traq Levies have a summer camp. Aqra is the administrative headquarters of a Qadha of the same name in the Mosul Liwa. Billeting. —The houses of Aqra are substantially built of stone, but are in most cases very small. The complete absence of any form of sanitation renders their occupation as billets undesirable. Were it necessary there is sufficient accommodation for 1 company of infantry, 50 men in the Police Serai, 80 in the school and 30 in each of the two fairly large Khans. The school might in emergency be used as a hospital. Municipal System. —The town is administered by a Rais Baladiyah or Mayor, who has an office near the Police Serai. Government Buildings. —The headquarters of the Qadha are contained within the precincts of the Police Serai, situated on the east of the town looking on to the Aqra Dagh. Water Supply. —Unlimited, from springs and streams. Supplies. —Aqra is principally a rice producing district. The following supplies are obtained locally, i.e., from the Aqra Nahiyah. Available Annual Production. for Military use. Wheat 657 tons 80 tons. Barley 518 „ 50 „ Lentils 8 „ Nil. Rice 595 ,, 90 „ Simsim 7 „ Nil. Mash 29 „ Nil. Ghi 20 „ .. .. 10 „ Vegetables • • ..

Grazing. —There is unlimited grazing to the south of the town. In summer the inhabitants have supplies of-hay for their own use. Transport. —About 80 horses and mules could be requisitioned locally. If notice were given this number could be increased. Aerodrome. —A summer landing-ground to the south of the town already marked out (for particulars see Chapter VIII, para. 3). Camping Site. —For one brigade south of the town.55 Bashkala. Bashkala lies about 50 miles south-east of Van and 20 miles from the Persian frontier in the upper valley of the Greater Zab. Before the war it contained some 1,500 houses, but was so damaged by the Russian invasion that only some 100 houses remain. Population is now about 500, mostly Kurds with a few Jews. In 1915 the Armenian and Nestorian population were either massacred or exiled. The town is situated on the western edge of a cultivated plain stretching eastwards to the Zab, about five miles distant. Immedi ately west of the town runs a steep range of hills, a number of the houses being built on the lower slopes. On a spur above the town are the ruins of a Kurdish castle visible for some miles on the road from Julamerk. Many of the houses are well built of sun-dried brick, and the main streets are wide and fairly clear. The importance of Bashkala arises from its position at the junction of the roads from Van, from Oilman across the Persian frontier, and from the Hakkiari country to the south and south-west. Its altitude is about 7,000 ft., and it suffers from a severe winter, snow lying until late in the year. Government Buildings. —The Turkish barracks are in the centre of the town, and consist of two low buildings of sun-dried brick. Administration. —Bashkala is the headquarters of a Qadha in the Hakkiari Vilayet. Water Supply. —Unlimited, from springs and streams through out the year. Supplies. —Wheat, barley, millet and simsim are grown, but only in sufficient quantity for the inhabitants. Production has fallen to a low level since the Great War and the flight of many of the inhabitants. Good grass is found in the spring and early summer. Fruit and vegetables are brought in from the Salmas plain and from Urumieh. Camping Grounds. —Sufficient for a brigade near the town. Bitlis. Bitlis, altitude 5,000 ft., lies in the valley of the Bitlis river about 15 miles south-west of the south-western corner of Lake Van. The population, estimated in 1914 to be about 40,000, is now less than half owing to the massacres and deportations, which have accounted for practically all the Armenians and most of the Christians. The town, lying in the deep valley of the river which flows through it frofiTftorth to south, extends up the hillsides and along56 the side valley of Khosrov containing an Armenian monastery. At the south end of-the town a side valley opens from the east, up which are scattered houses and gardens forming the Avekh suburb. To the east of the city is a bare rocky hill about l.OOOTt. high. A ruined castle on a rock of no great height, on the right bank of the Bitlis river, stands in the middle oTthe town. Along the west side of the castle rock flows the Khosrov stream, which the main river somewhat farther to Uie south. To the north of the castle rock, in the angle between the Bitlis and the Khosrov valley, is a flat toj&gt;ped spur, the Gok Maidan, on which are situated the government buildings and block of infantry barracks. The principal mosque lies south of the castle rock. Buildings .—The houses are well and solidly built, mostly of soft volcanic “ tufa ” quarried in the neighbourhood. Good houses are to be found, especially in the old Christian quarter, where the former British Consulate and the American Mission were situated. The bazaars along the river-side are crowded with narrow winding alleys. Some of them have been cleared to make room for the Bitlis-Ziarat Chaussey^pad, which runs through the length of the town. ' • Climate .—The position of Bitlis facing south in the deep valley makes it hot in summer. The climate on the whole is healthy. Water Supply .—Unlimited perennially from springs, the Bitlis river and a stream in the Avekh valley. Supplies .—Grain from the well-watered plains to the north used to be stored for export at Bitlis. Fruit and vegetables are obtainable from gardens and orchards near the town. The main exports, besides grain, are fleeces, wools, hides, skins, furs, gall nuts and gum tragacanth. Abundant fuel is brought from Modeki, Khisan and the Nimrud Dagh. A coarse red cloth is manufactured in the town. Billets and Camping Grounds .—For two battalions of infantry half a mile to the north of the town. Biflets for two battalions exist in Bitlis itself. Aerodrome Site .—There is not sufficient space for a landing ground in the neighbourhood of Bitlis. Diza (or Diza-Gawar). Diza is the principal town in the Gawar district. Before the Great War it is said to have contained 700 houses, but was so ravaged by the Russian invasion that only about 80 are now in existence. The population is about 400 persons, mostly Kurd with a small colony of Jews. The former Christian population has quite disappeared.57 The houses are mostly built of stone and mud with a few more solidly constructed of sun-dried brick. The Turkish barracks are situated on the north side of the town, which has a permanent garrison. At present it is the headquarters of one of the frontier battalions. Municipal System. —The town is administered by a Rais Baladiyah or Mayor. Water Supply. —The town has a plentiful supply of water from streams and springs all the year round. The Gawar plain is well-watered, and was a very productive area. Supplies. —The productivity of the district has been much reduced by the massacres and the flight of the population. Areas formerly cultivated are now lying fallow. During the operations against the Kurdish tribes in 1926, supplies were brought down from Van and probably from Urumieh. Camping Sites. —There are sufficient camping sites for a brigade in the vicinity of the town. Aerodrome Sites. —There is no aerodrome or landing ground maintained at Diza. The Gawar plain is flat, however, and no difficulty should be encountered in finding sufficient space for all types of aircraft. Dohuk. Dohuk lies about 50 miles north-north-west of Mosul and has a settled population of about 3,500. Kurds form the great majority, but out of the 550 houses, 65 are Christian and 30 Jewish. There is also a large refugee population of Nestorian Christians from the districts of Tiari, and a lesser number of Chaldeans from the Turkish districts of Merga and Bohtan. The town, which consists mostly of mud hovels with a few more substantial buildings, is situated on theleft bank of the Dohuk Su, at the southern end of a pass, which contains the road to Amadia. It lies in a fertile valley about two miles wide between two ranges of hills rising about 1,000 ft. above the village. Its importance is due to its position at the juncture of the plains and the hills, where it acts as a distributing centre to the various tribes in the neighbourhood. A wooden bridge, capable of carrying Ford cars crosses the river to the west of the town. A little farther down are the remains of a stone bridge. The river is fordable between these two bridges. The streets are narrow and not very clean. Billets. —There are two large khans, which could accommodate a squadron of cavalry between them. Half a company of infantry could be allocated to the school. The lack of sanitary arrangements make billeting in the houses impracticable.58 Administration .—Dohuk is the the Mosul Liwa. The Qadha posed of— Kurds Christians ..

Principal Buildings .—The principal building in the town is the stone built Serai, which contains the offices of the government officials and the police billets. To the south of the town there is a well-built modern bungalow which was formerly the residence of the British AssistantT 5 oIItical Officer. It has four or five large rooms and extensive outhouses. This building would be suitable as a hospital or as offices for any military force quartered in the vicinity. 11 ater Supply. Unlimited from the Dohuk Su at all times of the year. Supplies .—Crops raised around Dohuk are very HgMe to* destiuction by the locust pest. In 1926 the following amoiirits were harvested whkh'~were insufficient for the needs of the inhabitants. Figures are for the nahieh of Dohuk :— Wheat Barley Atta .. Rice .. Simsim Mash . . Millet . . Maize .. Bhoosa 169 tons 115 „ 200 „ 54 „ 4 „ 10 „ 140 „ 42 „ 3,000 „ Fruits are always plentiful, and the crop of grapes, peaches, apricots, plums, pears, figs and pomegranates amounted to 2,000 tons. Firewood is unlimited from the hills, and vegetables sufficient for a battalion daily in season can be collected. Grazing can be found in the spring in the Dohuk valley for two regiments of cavalry. In summer it is scarce. Camping Site.—On each bank of the Dohuk Su west and south of the town for an infantry division. Aerodrome.—There is no possible site near Dohuk. The landing ground is at Simel. (Particulars in Chapter VIII, para. 3.)34 - 59 Jazirat-ibn-Omar. Jazirat-ibn-Omar lies on the Tigris about 90 miles above Mosul, and contains 1,600 houses. The population is mainly Kurdish. The town is built on a lo w gravelly island in the Tigris, but is not effectively surrounded by water except in the flood season. At other times the longer channel, which bounds the town on the north, west and south, is practically dry, although it contains some springs. The western channel, said to be 150 yards wide, has a small bridge consisting of four spans of wood on mason ry piers with a plank roadway 10 ft. wide. Before the Great War the eastern channel—tfie main arm of the Tigris— was crossed, except during floods, by a boat bridge 120 yards long. This bridge consisted of 16 pontoons, and had a plank roadway 16 feet wide. It was disconnected during the floods., when the inundations spread out to a total width of 400 yards. A pontoon' ierfy“ts now used, which consists of two double pontoons with a wooden superstructure. TEeTarea enclosed by the two channels of the river is approxi mately 1,100 yards long, north to south, by 1,200 yards, east to west. The town has a frontage on the river from 300 to 400 yards long with the remains of a protective masonry wall about 200 yards long fronting the river. The site of Jazirat-ibn-Omar is much shut in, bare hills rising on either side of the river. The climate is, fherefore, intensely hot in summer, and there is considerable liability to fever. The town has a permanent garrison, and is the headquarters of one of the frontier battalions. Of recent years it has been much in prominence as a military centre before the settlement of the Turko-Traq frontier and during the Kurdish rebellion of 1926. Government Buildings .—The principal government buildings are :— The military barracks. Headquarters of the Gendarmerie and civil gaol. Headquarters of the civil administration. Post and telegraph office. The locations of these and other government establishments are as indicated in the plan facing page —. Water Supply .—Water is obtainable from small wells in the town, which are in danger of pollution. Water from the river is good if filtered. Supplies .—The district produces a surplus. The main crops are wheat, barley, millet and simsim. The markets are much frequented by the tribesmen of the neighbourhood. Aerodrome Site .—A landing ground is located north-north-west of the town between the old river bed and the bend of the Tigris. Camping Sites .—Sufficient space can be found in the vicinity of the town for a division.60 Julamerk. Julamerk is situated in the wild district of Hakkiari, about 50 miles north-north-east of Amadia. It formerly contained 300 houses ; but, owing to the destruction caused during the Russian advance in 1917 its population disappeared, and in January, 1920, there were only some 50 houses. Since then a number of the inhabitants have returned, and there are now about 80 houses with a population of about 400. The town lies in a basin drained by several ravines forming a stream, which passes through a deep gorge-into the Zab valley. It is built at the foot of a rocky crag crowned by a Kurdish fort now in ruins. The rock on which the fort stands has a narrow summit, 100 yards long and about 20 ft. wide, dominating the gorge leading up from the Zab. Government Buildings. —The main government buildings are:— The headquarters of the Hakkiari Vilayet. The Gendarmerie headquarters^^ Water Supply. —Unlimited, from streams. Supplies. —The district is unproductive, and hardly sufficient is grown for the needs of the inhabitants. Aerodrome Site. —There is stated to be a possible landing ground at Berchalla, on the right bank of the Zab, south of Kochannes. Camping Site. —Camping site for two battalions is available on the southern outskirts of the town. Julamerk is not a garrison town, being only occupied by gendarmerie, who are accommodated in the serai in the middle of the town. Neri. Neri is an important centre in the district of Shemsdinan lying about 45 miles north of Rowanduz. It formerly contained 250 houses, but suffered during the Russian invasion, and is now mostly in ruins. Neri was formerly the residence of Saiyid Taha, the most important personality of the district. Now Qaimmaqam of Rowanduz, he still possesses great religious influence throughout Shemsdinan. The inhabitants are Kurds. Government Buildings. —The few houses that remain are nearly all occupied by government officials. The principal buildings are:— Billets for troops and the gendarmerie. The Qaimmaqam’s house. Telegraph office. These are located as indicated in the accompanying plan. The houses on the east end of the town are said to be the best.61 Water Supply. —Unlimited. Supplies. —The valleys in Shemsdinan are fertile, but products are only sufficient for the inhabitants. Supplies could be imported from Urumieh. The main crops are tobacco, wheat, rice, barley and fruits. Camping Site. —Troops have previously occupied ground to the north of the town. Aerodrome Site. —Sufficient space could probably be found south of the town. Owing to the rice and tobacco cultivation the ground will be soft. Sairt. Sairt—altitude 2,820 ft.—lies about 45 miles north by west of Jazirat-ibn-Omar, and has a population of about 10,000 people. Formerly there was a large Christian population, which has been much reduced by massacre and deportation. The town is built on the south-eastern corner of a small plain extending three miles westward to the Keseri valley, and is surrounded by vine-clad hills and orchards. The houses are well built of stone and gypsum cement as in Mosul, but many are in bad repair. There are a few old mosques, a leaning minaret and a castle. The streets are dirty, crooked, and ill-paved. Municipal System. —The town is administered by a Rais Baladiyah or Mayor and a municipal council. Government Buildings. —The principal government buildings are:— (a) Divisional headquarters, situated outside the southern limits of the town between fork roads. (&amp;) The arsenal, located about the middle of the town off the main road from the south-west corner. (c) The barracks—north-west corner of the town off the mam street. {d) Headquarters of the civil administration. Opposite the arsenal. {e) The post office, situated immediately north of the arsenal. Billets. —The barracks are said to accommodate 1,000 men. There is also an old khan near the barracks which is also utilised as military billets. Water Supply.—The water supply is from wells and covered tanks cut in the rocks in the hills east of the town. It often runs short in summer. The best wells are outside the town to the west, and are walled round and covered. Another good well exists at the south-eastern corner of the town. s-\ 62 Supplies. —A certain amount of wheat, barley, millet, rice and lentils is grown in the district, but the most important cultivation is the vine. Cereals are sufficient for local needs only. Fuel has to be brought in from Shirwan. Aerodrome Site. —North of the town there is a large plateau on which aircraft can find a landing ground. Camping Site .—Sufficient for a brigade in the vicinity of the town. Shattakh. Shattakh lies at the junction of a large stream from the north with the Bohtan river. It is mainly on the right bank, although government buildings and barracks are situated on the left bank. Lying 45 miles south-west by south of Van, it forms the centre of a number of small villages on terraces on steep slopes bordering the valley. It is known as Shakh by the Kurds, and by the Armenians as Tagh, both meaning the head or centre. To the south and south-east rise very steep slopes culminating in the Gilolokan Dagh, about 10,000 ft. high, while to the north are the Ardost BagHIfnd the Maidan Tash Dagh, both about the same height. There are two bridges across the Bohtan, but the stream is easily fordable in summer. The town formerly had a population of about 1,200 inhabitants, who were mostly Armenian. There is now said to be barely 300 inhabitants, the Armenians having been either massacred or deported. Government Buildings.—The main buildings are :— The headquarters of the Qaimmaqam of Shattakh. The barracks. Telegraph office. These are all on the left bank of the Bohtan river opposite the junction with the tributary from the north. Water Supply. —Unlimited all the year round. Supplies .—With the exception of fuel all supplies are scarce and only sufficient for local requirements. Shemakh. Shernakh lies 40 miles north-east of Jazirat-ibn-Omar. It is the centre of the powerful Shernakh tribe, whose leaders have always been intimately concerned with the questions of Kurdish independence. The town contains about 400 houses, with a population of approximately 2 , 000 .ROUGH PLAN of SHERNAKH TOWN63 Government Buildings .— (a) The Qaimmaqam’s office.—A stone building with a wood and mud roof. (b) Barracks.—A stone building, also with a wood and mud roof. (c) Hutments.—The summer quarters of the garrison. Billets .—The barracks and hutments are said to have accommodation for 500-600 men. The houses of the notables could also be utilised. Aerodrome Sffe.—Localities which could be rendered fit for aircraft to land on are as indicated in the accompanying plan of the town. Camping Site .—Sufficient for a brigade. Water Supply. —Unlimited, from springs. Van. Van lies at the south-east corner of Lake Van. The pre-war population numbered about 30,000-40,000, mostly Armenian. During the war the massacres and deportations reduced the numbers to approximately half the former total. Great numbers of the Armenian inhabitants lost their lives, while some 2,000 fled to Urumieh and came down through Hamadan to Baqubah with the Urumian Christians. The town of Van lies in a fertile plain, which slopes gently up from the lake on the west to the foot of the Varak Dagh on the east, a distance of about 8 miles. The highest summit of the Varak Dagh is about 4,500 ft. above the plain. From north to south the plain is about 5 miles broad, and on these sides it is bounded by hills of no great height, over which several easy passes lead. From this plain rise two isolated rocky masses, the citadel hill of Van and, some 2-3 miles to the east-north-east, the Zemzem Dagh with its flat topped spur, the Toprak Kaleh, whicHoverlodks-the northernmost 'suburb of the city: ' The citadel rock of Van, which rises abruptly out of the plain, is some 1,000 yards from the lake shore. Close under its southern side lies the walled town, and east and south of this, again, are the extensive garden quarters, which stretch eastwards for about 3 | miles and southwards for about 1 mile. The following description of the town refers to its condition before the war ; the garden quarters were much damaged during the fighting between the Armenians and the Turks in April—May, 1915. Various important buildings, such as the Turkish barracks and the British Consulate, appear to have been wholly or partially destroyed, and the suburb of Adremid to have been ruined. The walled city was bombarded from the citadel rock, but no great damage was done except to the upper stories of the houses.64 The garden quarters, thickly planted with poplars and luxuriant undergrowth, are surrounded and intersected by mud walls 10-12 ft. high. The houses lie in clusters, which are hidden from the roads approaching the town by tre£s ; these groups of buildings are most numerous and important in the neighbourhood of the main avenues. The houses are generally well built with flat roofs, and often two stories. The principal avenue is that which runs eastwards from the walled town -tCLSahkeh at the farther end of the gardens. Another avenue leads from the walled town south-east to the Erek garden quarter. Both these roads are mqtallecL A fairly broad unmetalled road connects the Aq Kirpi quarter, which lies to the north under the Toprak KaleTiT^vfthHErek on the south. Else where are lanes, passablFforcarts in- parts, but in places either cut up by canals or too narrow for wheels. The canals, however, although numerous, are not serious obstacles. The vegetation of the gardens is wholly dependent on irrigation, which is carried out by means of water cuts or karaises. These latter are often to be found under the bed of watercourses, which are dry on the surface, the position of the karaise being indicated by holes at intervals. ^ } The streets of the walled town are narrow and winding ; the buildings here are mainly the government offices, barracks, and the principal shops and bazaars. The citadel rock, 1,300 yards long and 360 ft. above the plain, runs along the whole of the north side of the walled town. The south face of the rock overlooking the city is quite precipitous. The north side slopes down at an angle of 45 degrees, arid is easy to climb at most points ; where the rock appears on this side it is cut into steps. The ground below this slope is marshy, and a swamp fed by several small springs has filled up the old wet ditch along the north side of the hill. The ascents to the citadel appear to lie at the west and east ends of the rock. The central citadel occupies the highest part of the summit, about half-way between the east and west ends of the rock, or slightly nearer to the western extremity. The plateau on which it stands is 180 yards long by 120 yards broad. At the western end of the rock is a large spring, overlooked by a bastion of big stone blocks, which is now in ruins, as also is the wall which protected the spring. The central citadel is isolated from the outer walls, and is entered by a gate at its north-east corner. Its walls are partly of masonry, partly of mud, built upon ancient foundations of large stones. A mosque with a minaret is a prominent object in the centre of the citadel. A masonry magazine shows up distinctly at the eastern end, and other magazines are situated in rock-cut chambers a short way below. Barracks, which usually contained 200 men before the war, are also situated in the citadel.VAN65 (C 16145) L&gt; Government Buildings. —The principal government buildings in Van are :— {a) The cavalry barracks, reported outside the walled town at the south-east corner. (&amp;) Infantry barracks, formerly government offices, said to be situated at south-west corner of the wailed town. (c) Infantry barracks south-west of Toprak Kaleh. (d) Serai, reported to contain the post and telegraph office, outside the walled town at the south-west corner. Water Supply. —For drinking water the town is supplied from four copious springs, besides the one already mentioned at the western end of' the rock. The water is not very good, however. In the gardens the principal supply is from the karaises, being obtained from their mouths or from the holes at intervals along their course. The best are at the eastern end of the gardens, where water can be obtained without contamination from houses. Elsewhere all the karaises are more or less contaminated. The Shemiran canal water contains sulphate and carbonate of lime, but is drunk by the poorer people. The water in fhe Kori Bash river above Kori Bash village is good. In the border hills are numerous springs. The water of the lake, which is with carbonate and sulphate of soda, is undrinkable. Supplies. —The plain of Van is well cultivated with corn, vegetables and fruit. (See Chapter VII, para. 1.) Aerodrome Site. —There is said to be sufficient room for machines to land south-west of the walled town. There is no permanent landing ground kept up, and aircraft land at Van very seldom. Camping Site. —Selection of camping sites present no difficulties. Van is a permanent garrison town with some units of the 12th Infantry Division and the 5th Frontier Battalion at present stationed there. The most suitable site for a large camp of troops would be on the plain north-west of Toprak Kaleh, north of Sahkeh, or between the gardens and Shanantz. Foreign Consulates. —Before the war there were vice-consulates for Great Britain and Russia and a consul-general for Persia with a consular agent for France. There is now no consular representation. Van was also the headquarters of a very flourishing American Mission and Orphan School situated at the east end of the gardens. There was also a French Dominican Mission and schools. Administration. —Van is the headquarters of the Vali of the Vilayet of Van. The town is administered by a municipal council presided over by the Rais Baladiyah or Mayor. impregnated66 Zakho. Zakho lies 60 miles north-north-west of Mosul, and contains about 4,000 souls. This population consists of Kurds, Chaldeans, Jews and a few Arabs. It is built on a rocky island measuring some 800 by 400 yards in the Khabur river, which above Zakho is a mountain stream and below it spreads, out through several channels in a shingle bed 400 yards wide. The island is connected with the left bank by a stone bridge with a 10 foot roadway at the south-eastern end of the town and by a suspension bridge at the western side. Both these bridges can take light wheeled traffic. An attempt to bridge the northern arm of the river in 1919 was unsuccessful. This arm is unfordable until the end of June. About a mile upstream from Zakho there is an ancient stone bridge with a 15 foot roadway passable for light cars and carts with some difficulty. There are a few well built stone houses with two stories which could be used as billets. The majority, however, are the usual Kurdish type of mud houses and quite unsuitable for billeting British troops. Municipal System .—Zakho is the headquarters of the Qaim- maqam of the Zakho Qadha’. The town is administered by a Rais Baladiyah or Mayor and a municipal council. Government Buildings .—The main buildings are :— {a) The Serai, situated at the eastern end of the island. ( 6 ) The police headquarters, situated on the north side of the main street through the town, about half-way from the suspension bridge to the Serai at the opposite end of the island. (c) The hospital, situated on the north bank of the Khabur. {d) The school, located in the Serai buildings. {e) The post and telegraph office also in the Serai building. Hospitals, Offices. The buildings noted above could be utilised for military purposes. The present hospital (c) is a good double storied building with about 20 rooms. Water Supply. —Unlimited, from the Khabur river. Supplies .—The soil of the Khabur valley is fertile, and wheat, barley, tobacco and fruits are grown. Annual production. Wheat 221 tons. Barley •• 291 „ Lentils 11 „ Rice 13 „ Bhoosa .. 7,000 „ Fruits • • 60 „ At 20 days’ notice. 30 tons (after harvest). 70 „ „ 150 tons. 3 „ These figures relate to the production of the Zakho Nahiyah.67 d 2 (C16145) There is an oil well at Zakho, which has an annual production of— Kerosine .. .. 7,200 gallons. Burning oil .. 38,400 „ Inferior petrol .. 2,880 „ Wood for fuel is unlimited from the hills, and is floated down to Zakho on rafts from the Guli district. Aerodrome Site.—There is a landing ground at Zakho, for particulars of which see Chapter VIII, para. 2. Camping Sites .—Good camping grounds can be found on the banks of the Khabur. Space is ample for a division. „„ defence.—The spurs-of the Jabal AM^acth, south of Zakho, afford good positions for the defence of the Mosul road, which crosses the range by the Zakho Pass. The range appears to be impassable between this pass and its western end near Dairabun.69 d 3 (C 16145) CHAPTER IV. PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. 1. Geological Formation. Central Kurdistan belongs to the mountain system which is generally known as “ Zagros.” The mountains north of Mosul are a complicated construction, composed of igneous rocks, serpentine, and chrystalline schists! The foothills consist of that characteristic gypsum formation, which begins at Jazirat-ibn-Omar, and continues probably as far as Baluchistan. 2. Mountain and Hill Systems. The mountain and hill systems may be conveniently divided into four parts :— (i) The ranges south of Lake Van. (ii) The higher ranges around the headwaters of the Greater Zab. (hi) The parallel ranges south of the Turco-Traq frontier, (iv) The Jabal Muklub in the Mosul plain. I. Ranges south of Lake Van. The ranges south of Lake Van do not form a continuous line, but have several gaps and breaks, through which streams force their way back to the Tigris instead of towards the lake. These gaps are important when communications to the Tigris valley come to be considered. The Bitlis Pass .—The most important gap in the military sense is the Bitlis pass, which is the main communication between the highlands of the Van area and the plains of Traq. No such feasible pass exists for a considerable distance to the east or west. This pass is fit for all arms to Diarbekr, and from Bitlis to Sairt for Ford cars. The extension to Jazirat-ibn-Omar is fit for pack only, and is closed by snow from December to March. The Agherov Dagh .—The main mass of this range is in the centre; the Agherov Dagh, rising to 11,000ft., is snow-capped for several months of the year. There are no easy routes through from the south-west of Van, with the exception of the one through Merwanen and along the higher watershed between the Bohtan and the Greater Zab, and so into the valley of the Hazil river. This is the shortest route to Mosul in summer, but is closed in winter by snow.70 Ay dost. —Towards the east end of the lake the range culminates in the Ardost peak, and is sharply broken by the valley of the Shattakh stream. The Chukh Dagh. —The Chukh Dagh joins the Persian frontier ranges on one side and to the south-west trends away into the ranges forming the watershed between the Boh tan and the Greater Zab, which rises to 12,000 ft., but have no prominent peaks. The range is crossed by the Chukh Pass, 9,500 ft., which is the direct route from Van to Bashkala by Koshab. It is fit for Ford cars and A.T. carts. Bashkala is an important centre for routes connecting Van and the towns on Lake Urumieh. The con tinuation of this route to Neri and Diza with a branch to Julamerk is fit for pack only, and is closed in winter for movement on any scale. These two routes, the Bitlis Pass and the Van-Bashkala route via the Chukh Pass, are the only ones fit for regular military operations through the mountains south of Lake Van. The mountains farther south restrict the avenues of approach; whilst the barren and rocky nature of the country prevents operations by large bodies and confines the movement of troops to the larger valleys, except in the Gawar plain, which is an open district 25 miles long by 5 broad. The Arnost Mountain .—From the Agherov Dagh, a spur runs south until over the river gorge near Shattakh, and then terminates in the rocky mass of the Arnost mountain. This has a long flat- topped ridge known as the Maidan Tash, rising to about 11,000 ft., with abrupt rocky sides overhanging the town. The Gilolokan Mountain .—Across the valley is a long spur from near Merwanen terminating in the Gilolokan mountain, which also towers over Shattakh from the south, about 11,000 ft. high. The Harikol Dagh. —South of the Agherov Dagh and across the Bohtan river is a stony flat-topped mass known as Harikol Dagh, which terminates in an enormous crag at its south-eastern corner. II. Ranges round Headwaters of Greater Zab. The Jelu Ranges .—The highest mountains are found round the headwaters of the Greater Zab, where the Jelu ranges rise to 14,000 ft. with a summit line of splendid crags and pinnacles. On the right bank of the river is the Harefta Dagh, a lofty spur from the main watershed. Routes through these ranges are only fit for pack, and are closed during the winter months. One track leads from Diza-Gawar to Neri and thence by Girdi and Baradost to Rowanduz, also by Girdi, Rezan, Zibar and Aqra to Mosul. From Bashkala to Julamerk are two fairly easy routes for pack, one by the Zab valley and the other over a spur of the HareftaDagh. From Julamerk there are difficult paths, suitable for pack only, by the Zab valley and Lizan, the other by Tal, Hani Pass, Tkhuma and Chal. d 4 (C 16145) The Farashin Upland.—South of the Harefta Dagh, at the head of the Lewin valley, the main watershed is divided in the centre by the Farashin upland, in which the Khabur, a tributary of the Tigris, has its source. A route from Julamerk to Jazirat- ibn-Omar over easy hill country, but not passable for wheels, leads by Lewin into Farashin and thence to Shernakh and Jazirat- ibn-Omar. This is the route followed by nomad Kurds driving their sheep to the plains, the only difficulty being the steep crossing of the Khabur valley near Elk. The Aurakh Dagh. —A remarkable feature is an immense wall of rock, which commences in the Aurakh Dagh overlooking the Bohtan, continues south-east, and finally crosses the Khabur valley near Elk. The Khabur forces its way through, but a straight wall of rock continues over into the Lewin valley where it ends abruptly, although traces of the same formation exist connecting across the Zab with the Jelu mountains. Its crest between the Khabur and the Zab attains an elevation of about 10,500 it., and only a single pathway leads across it by what is called the Derai-i-Zir. This pass is an important feature when considering routes of nomad tribes, as practically all the Artushi, the Hajjan being an exception, pass over it on their way to Farashin. The Sat Dagh. —South of the Jelu ranges is the Sat Dagh, rising to about 14,500 ft. It is an isolated mass separated from the Persian frontier ranges by the lower end of the Gawar plain and the upland valley of Khumara, and from the ranges to the south by the deep valley of the Shemsdinian Su, a tributary of the Zab. The slopes of this range are used by the Herki nomads for summer pasturage. III. Ranges south of the Turco- Iraq Frontier. South of the frontier the mountains consist of a series of parallel ranges, striking from east to west, with a narrow valley between them. Movement is confined to the valleys ; but there are difficult tracks leading over the ridges from one valley to another. The mountain sides are well-wooded, and streams run through all the valleys. The passes are impracticable for the movement of troops between December and the end of March. The Matina Dagh. —The Matina Dagh, also known as the Ser Amadia, is a wall of black rock, rising to over 6,000 ft., between the Khabur and the Greater Zab rivers. It borders the fertile district of Barwari-Bala. Routes cross it at Amadia and Aradin. There is also a very difficult track leading over it from Bamurni village. The range ends abruptly at the Zab, and is continued on the east bank by the Kurazhor Dagh72 The Gara Dagh .—Borders the Supna valley on the south and rises to nearly 7,000 ft. This range is very rough with a break at the Suwara Toka pass to Dohuk. There is a difficult track to Aqra, entirely closed by snow for several months of the year. The Chia-i-Shirin Dagh.—On the east bank of the greater Zab opposite Zibar ; inhabited by Barzan tribesmen under the leadership of the notorious Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan. The Piris Dagh.—Overlooks the plain of Zibar from the south and rises to over 5,000 ft. A rough track connecting Zibar (Bira Kapra) with Aqra is fit for pack only, and is closed at intervals during the winter. The Chia-i-Spi Dagh—Could be utilised as a defensive position, from Zakho to Faishkhabur to cover Mosul. It rises to 3,500 ft. being loftiest towards the western end. IV. The Jahal Makluh. An isolated mass (highest point 3,460 ft.) rising out of the plain east of Mosul. It is of little military importance. 3. Rivers. General .—The rivers of Central Kurdistan are largely snow fed, and during their spring floods are, with the exception of the Tigris, raging torrents presenting impassable obstacles to the movement of large forces. In the winter and early spring, i.e., from December to the end of May, these rivers are all unfordable and are liable to sudden spate, due to melting snow or ram or a combination of both. The only means of ciossing them is by “ kellek ” raft; but boat ferries exist on the Tigris and on some of the other streams which cross main routes in the plains. In their upper reaches the watercourses are steep and confined to narrow beds in gorges, through which the water rushes with great violence. Through these gorges there are narrow, and in some parts difficult, tracks, which permit the movement of animals in single file. Snow prohibits movement on any considerable scale from December to March. In summer, however, fords over hard shingly beds can be found in many places. The Tigris .—Immediately after its junction with the Batman river the Tigris becomes narrower and deeper, flowing rapidly in winding rock-strewn gorges, difficult to negotiate in a “ kellek.’’ After Hassan Kaif the valley widens out between mountain ranges. Between the Bohtan Su and Jazirat-ibn-Omar the river becomes more rapid and enters a mountainous tract, flowing in a series of sharp bends where navigation is difficult. Between Jazirat-ibn-Omar and Mosul the Tigris follows a tortuous course between low hills and undulations, intersected by one large valley, that of the Khabur. Here, as above Jazirat-ibn-Omar, the rivercontains numerous rapids and shallows formed by ledges of rock and shingle. Between Mosul and the Greater Zab its winding course continues over alternations of placid stretches and rapids shot with shingly ledges. The Greater Zab .—The Greater Zab rises among the low hills along the Persian frontier, east of the Kuch Dagh. Below Tiari it traverses a trackless gorge until it emerges into the more open valley of Amadia, where it turns south-east through a fertile well- wooded district bordered by rocky ridges. On the right bank it receives the Av-i-Gara, draining the eastern portion of the Supna or Amadia valley ; whilst on the left bank but farther to the south, the Rudbar-i-Shin, flowing through a great chasm, the Geli Belinda, joins the main stream. Below the mouth of this tributary the valley again narrows, but opens into the small plain of Ziban. Below this again the river gorge becomes most difficult; and it is only at the Berdin gorge that the Greater Zab finally leaves the hills and wanders, in a broad shingly bed with many channels, to join the Tigris below Mosul. The Khabur .—The Khabur is a large mountain stream, which joins the Tigris at Faishkhabur. It rises in the uplands of Fara- shin, and for most of its course is confined to narrow gorges, through which the water forces its way with great violence. Above Zakho it flows through more open country, and on the way to the Tigris passes over a fertile plain. The Hazil .-—The Hazil is a tributary of the Khabur which, flowing from the mountains to the north, joins it below Zakho. It also traverses a fine series of gorges before reaching the plain. Details of the rivers are contained in the following Table 3.83 4. Woods and Forests. Practically no effort has been made to preserve the woods and forests which exists in the Kurdish mountains. The wasteful felling of timber, the firing of trees to produce charcoal and the failure to plant young trees are leading to a large annual diminution in the wood supply. Oaks, rather stunted, and hawthorn are found most fre quently on the hillsides. Walnut, poplar and sycamore are usually to be found near the villages. As the plains are approached trees practicaly disappear, and only the mimosa and the willow are to be found along the river banks. It is generally found that the northern slopes of the mountain ranges are better wooded than the southern slopes. These forests give ample scope for concealment, and add to the danger of ambush and surprise. The woods are generally thick enough to render air reconnaissance especially difficult. The following Table 4 is an attempt to show the areas where woods are thickest. Table 4. Forested Areas. Tree. District. Remarks. Walnut . . Sycamore . . y Oak .. . . J Barwari-Bala. Nerva-Raikan.

Lake Faw.—Lake Van is roughly rectangular, 55 miles long and 40 broad, with a long arm at its north-east corner which increases its length from north-east to south-west to some 80 miles. It has no outlet, and its waters largely contain carbonate and sulphate of soda, which make them bitter and undrinkable. A curious feature of the lake, which it has in common with Lakes Archag and Urumieh, is a periodic rise and fall. This is as much as 8 ft., lasting five years for each complete movement.84 Lake Archag. —The Archag Lake, north-east of the town of Van, is oval in shape and about 6 miles at its widest and 8 miles at its longest (i.e., north to south) points. The water is bitter and undrinkable. Nazik and Shelo Lakes—Two small lakes situated north-west of Lake Van. Both contain fresh water. Lake Urumieh. —Eighty-five miles long, 35 broad, and 4,100 ft. above sea level. Its water is salt. (The lakes of Central Kurdistan are fully described in the Military Report on Eastern Turkey in Asia, Volume II, the Van Plateau.) 6. Marshes, Swamps, and Floods. The Tigris. —The liability of the Tigris to sudden flood is a factor, which military engineers must always bear in mind. Although the times at which the river rises and falls and its discharges vary to a certain extent every year, the river is at its highest in March and April, swollen by the melting of the snow in the mountains. In May it commences to fall, usually reaching its lowest point in September. In October and November it again rises, owing to the winter rains, which increase its volume during December, January and February. The greatest floods are not always caused by melting snow, as a sudden fall of rain may cause a rise of six feet in one night. In cases like this the land in the vicinity of the river usually becomes inundated. In high flood at Mosul the river bed is about 675 yards wide with a deep channel towards the west bank some 150 to 200 yards broad. Average monthly levels in feet above sea-level during a normal year and for an abnormal one are given at the end of this chapter. Figures are taken from observations at Mosul bridge. Other Rivers. —The mountain streams are mostly confined to narrow beds between high and precipitous banks. Practically no flooding is, therefore, caused in the neighbourhood of water courses. Marshes. —There is practically no marsh land of a permanent character in the area under review. All land under cultivation in summer is soft and sodden with the essential irrigation, and offers an obstacle to the free use of mounted troops and pack transport. In the mountain valleys and in some areas on the banks of the Greater Zab, where it flows through the plain to join the Tigris, .rice and tobacco are grown. In those areas the ground will be soft and practically impassable for other than dismounted troops.7. Canals and Irrigation Systems. In the plains the principal methods of irrigation is by water lifts and “ Na’oors ” or primitive water-wheels. By this means water is distributed through small irrigation channels. In the mountains, small channels are led off from the perennial streams. Water can be conveyed from 1 to miles by lifts. The channels are too small to offer any difficulties of movement to other than wheeled vehicles. 8. Water Supply. Good water is available practically everywhere in the hills and mountains. The problem of obtaining ample supplies seldom arises. In the plains along the main routes and in the foothills there is sufficient water to supply a brigade at each stage at all times of the year. Precautionary measures are imperative to minimise the danger of pollution when the supply is drawn from streams and wells. Details of water supplies are given in the section on Routes in Chapter VI.

CLIMATE. Nature of the Climate. —The climatic conditions of Central Kurdistan range from those of the sub-tropical and semi-arid Mosul Plain through the sub-montane region round Aqra and Zakho to the elevated regions about the head of the Greater Zab. They embrace, therefore, nearly every variety of heat and cold. The winter round the head waters of the Greater Zab is very severe, the country being deep in snow, and military operations are practically impossible from the middle of November to the middle or end of April. The Urumieh plain at a lower elevation has a climate rather milder in winter than that round Van, but military operations are not very practicable there also. On the Persian frontier hills snow falls heavily during the winter, and the higher passes are often blocked by drifts. During winter in the Mosul Plain a fair amount of rain falls, and the temperature has been known to fall to 28° below freezing point. During fine spells in the hills conditions resemble to some extent those of .Switzerland. There is sunshine with moderate warmth, and the general effect is bracing and exhilarating. In the plains the summer is hot and dry, especially in July, August and September. As the Kurdish hills are ascended the heat naturally lessens, and at levels between 7,000 and 9,000 ft. it is cool throughout the day and cold at night. It affords a beneficial change from the heat of the plains. Effect on Europeans and Natives. —In the sub-montane districts, at an altitude below 2,000 ft., snow does not lie for any length of time. In wet, cold, winter weather there is a tendency for any latent malaria to recur, and any disposition towards rheumatic affections become aggravated. During the summer months the whole of low-lying Kurdistan is potentially unhealthy for European and Indian troops operating between April and November. Malaria and dysentery may be expected to occur to a considerable extent. Native levies, how ever, suffer relatively less from malaria, whilst bowel complaints are rare among them. Effect on Animals.—Rorses and mules, whether of English or Australian origin, do extraordinarily well even in the hottest summers. The only drawback to heavy types of horses, such as those of British Cavalry and Artillery, is the hard nature of the ground, which necessitates constant attention to the feet and efficient shoeing by well-trained farriers.Effect on Facility of Movement .—Movement in the mountains during the winter months and in the spring, until the snow has melted from the passes, is practically impossible, or, at best, very difficult. In the summer, especially during July, August and September, it is not advisable to move troops unless at night or early morning. Military operations are possible in the mountains, however, and, from June to October, camps can, with great advantage, be made at heights between 6,000 and 7,000 ft. Below 3,000 ft. little benefit or relief from the heat of the plains occurs, except at night. The Traq Levies have had a summer camp on the Ser-i-Amadia, at an altitude of a little over 6,000 ft., and exceptionally healthy conditions have prevailed there. A small military hill station has recently been started in summer at Beri Berdan (about 9,000 ft.) near the junction of the Traq- Turco-Persian frontiers, where distinct relief from the heat of the plains can be obtained. It is apparently quite healthy there. Temperature .—The coldest month is January, while the hottest is July or August, there being little to choose between the two. The difference between the temperature at Mosul and that of most hill stations is not very apparent in the mean tem perature, but it is clearly seen in the daily and monthly extremes. Snow generally falls in the mountains north of Dohuk-Aqra between January and April, when it sometimes lies to a depth of several feet in the valleys. Table 6 indicates the maximum and minimum temperatures with the highest and lowest average humidity for the years 1924-1925-1926. Seasons and Rainfall .—In regions near the hills the rainfall is moderate and in the hills plentiful. The first rains usually fall in the plains in October, and continue until May. January and February are the wettest months. Table 6 indicates the rainfall for the years 1924-1925-1926. Central Kurdistan, with its semi-arid deserts to the south-west, its better watered and more fertile plains to the south-east, and the circle of mountains surrounding it in the north, is an area of transition or a combination of the climatic areas of the Zagros mountains and southern Traq. Altitude rather than latitude is the governing factor. Spring is early in the plains and begins in March ; as the highei lands are reached, it falls later. In Barwari Bala it may not begin until the middle of April. in the plains summer commences in May and lasts to the end • October and November are the autumn months, and December, January and February the winter period, when rams are heaviest and snow may also be experienced. In the mountain areas in the more elevated valleys summer . oes no ^ k e §3 n until June, and by the end of September is merged mto autumn. Snow falls on the highest hills in mid-October,but the valleys may not be covered until the second, half of December. The more lofty ranges are not clear of snow until July. Prevalent It mds and, Hurricanes. —The prevailing wind during the summer months is in the fourth quadrant, i.e., west to north. In the winter months when the wind comes from the south-east, which it does with the greatest frequency, rain may be forecasted with comparative safety. A south-west wind of moderate velocity is a harbinger of dust disturbances. During the summer of 1925 these were almost of daily occurrence. The worst duststorms usually occur at night varying in duration from 10 minutes to an hour, although on occasions a dust storm has been known to last 2-J- hours. The velocity of the wind on these occasions ranges between 20 and 40 m.p.h., although it is stated that during one duststorm the speed attained was 45 m.p.h. The climax of this storm lasted about 20 minutes. Northerly winds are mainly dry, cold winds. The surface winds are usually very light, and calms are experienced over long periods at a time. Thunderstorms are rare, and when they occur are usually of short duration and vary greatly in intensity. Earthquakes .—Earthquakes are very rare indeed. The last recorded tremor occurred on the 9th October, 1926, at 0045 hours, and lasted five to six seconds with a vertical motion. Magnetic Variation .—The approximate magnetic declination is 2° 30' east. A compass can be used in all parts of the country. MEDICAL AND VETERINARY. Prevalent Diseases .—Little information of statistical value is available as to the health conditions among the civil population of Central Kurdistan. The complete absence of anything approach ing sanitation in villages, and the general rigour in the conditions of life under which the people exist, possibly weed out the unfit at an early period and leaves a hardy, virile population. Malaria is universally prevalent in the valleys. Anopheline mosquitoes have been found at an altitude up to 7,000 ft., but above that level they do not appear to exist. Anopheline breeding has two peaks, in May and October. In the Kirkuk area, from January to May, quartan malaria affords the predominant rhythm and again between the end of August and November ; but the main malaria season is between June and the middle of August, when malignant tertian, and, to a lesser extent, benign tertian are the dominant types. In the Central Kurdistan area, although the main malarial season more or less coincides with that of the Kirkuk area, yet quartan malaria is rare at any time of the year. The benign tertian form displays two well defined peaks, one in90 February and the other in October. The graph of the malignant tertian variety indicates that the rise begins in May working up to an apex in July, after which it falls steadily. The spleen rate everywhere in Central Kurdistan is high both in children and adults. Typhus and relapsing fever have been recorded. The enteric group of fevers is by no means rare. Cholera always remains a danger. Plague has not been recorded in the mountain areas. Smallpox in sporadic, and when it occurs the fatality rate is high. Bilharzia and ancylostoma are rare in Kurdistan. Lamblia has been reported, and intestinal parasitic worms are common. Europeans touring through the country are extremely liable to contract diarrhoea or dysentery. The latter is more frequently bacillary than amoebic in origin. Sand-fly fever is not prevalent in the higher altitudes. Eye diseases are chiefly evidenced by the prevalence of trachoma and the various forms of conjunctivitis. Precautions against Heat. —Heat-stroke is not likely to be met with in Kurdistan, though heat exhaustion may occur in the case of tired troops. Similar precautions against sunstroke must be taken in the hills to those adopted in the plains. At high altitudes the actinic action of the sun is increased, and there is a great liability to blistering of exposed surfaces, e.g., face, arms and knees ; it is very essential to guard against this. Europeans require tinted glasses as a rule. Animal Diseases .—Most of the deadly contagious and infectious diseases affecting stock in the East are encountered. Rinderpest.—Severe losses have been suffered by incidence of this disease. The annual migrations of the nomadic tribes from the Turkish and Persian frontiers to the Mosul and Arbil plains carry the disease in its train. It is fought by general inoculation. The serum supplied by the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, India, has proved very efficacious, and losses have been on a decreasing scale for the last few years. The tribes are now beginning to appreciate the benefit of veterinary help, and outbreaks among their animals are reported as early as possible. Glanders.—All army and police horses are periodically tested with mallein. The disease is fairly common. Anthrax.—Is not prevalent. The suppression of this disease is most important owing to the large export trade in wool and hides. Haemorrhagic Septicaemia.—Chiefly affects buffaloes, but is not frequent. There were outbreaks in 1920 and 1925. Mange.—Is very common among cart horses. Dourine.—A kind of equine syphilis. Suitable Clothing .—In the winter English type of clothing and underwear is desirable. After the first week in April a change can be made to drill, and this can be worn until about the beginning of November.A solar topee is essential for the period between April and November, but during the winter the field service cap is sufficient head covering. Insects—Wherever irrigated land for rice cultivation is found mosquitoes will be most prevalent. Larvae can be found in every rice field The prevalence of lice and flies in the villages makes billeting in Kurdish houses almost impossible. On the Persian border, the Argas persicus, a tick which is a night bloodsucker of man, is fairly common. This parasite has been incriminated as the carrier of a form of relapsing fever. Sand flies and biting midges are found practically universally, except at high altitudes. Bamber oil is regarded as being of value in keeping them off. Flies exist in swarms, whether near villages or not. The temperature in Kurdistan never reaches a point at which the fly dies, as it does in ’Iraq.95 CHAPTER VI. COMMUNICATIONS. 1. Roads. Classification of Roads. There are no metalled roads in Central Kurdistan with the exception of the first few miles on the Mosul-Zakho road and on the Zakho Pass, which is well graded and kept in good repair. Roads are built of earth and have no solid foundations. All roads fit for the use of motor traffic are given a general B.2 classification. They could, however, bear heavy M.T. for a short period, but would require to be metalled before any continuous increase of traffic could be carried. B.2 roads are on an average 14-18 ft. wide. At points where streams are bridged the roadway comes down to about 10 ft. Wheeled vehicles are therefore unable to pass each other at such points. This also applies to points where culverts carry the roads across the narrower irrigation ditches or water splashes. In winter and during the rainy season all B.2 roads come down to the lower B.3 classification. A few hours’ rain renders them quite impassable for motors, and horse drawn vehicles may also have considerable difficulty in traversing them. In the Mosul area the number of days when roads, as a means of com munication, are out of action in any one year varies from 15-20. The Van-Bashkala road across the Chukh Pass is entirely closed by snow for about three months (December-March). The Bitlis-Sairt road is also out of action for this period. Roads which proceed along the southern edge of the line of hills to the north of Mosul are liable to damage to a varying extent, depending upon the winter snow-fall and on the floods resulting from the melting snows. This applies more particularly to the Mosul-Zakho road, where it runs south of the Jabal Abyadh, the Ain-Sifni-Al Qosh road, and the latter stages of the Mosul- Aqra road. The surface may be washed away and the bare rock exposed. Obstacles .—Where B.2 roads cross the smaller streams, masonry or steel girder bridges are in existence. Were these destroyed it would generally be possible to ford the watercourses in the vicinity of the bridges during the summer months. The narrow water ducts and channels, crossed by culverts, are not more than 6 ft. wide, and do not present an obstacle that cannot be sur mounted by means of ramps or such similar methods. Ferries .—There are only two points where main roads pass over streams and rivers by means of ferries. The Mosul-Aqra96 road crosses the Khazir river at Mindan, where the ferry consists of two pontoons with a wooden platform attached to a wire across the river, and is capable of taking one vehicle at a time. It is designed for light traffic only, but heavier vehicles, such as Rolls Royce tenders (light) have been transported across successfully. This ferry is generally out of action during the flood season in May for two or three days. Also during the normal period of the floods the ferrying across of cars is a matter of difficulty owing to the bad approaches to the ferry-boat and the absence of ramps of a sufficient length to carry the vehicle from the shore to the boat. The second ferry is on the Mosul-Arbil-Kirkuk road, and crosses the Greater Zab at Guwair. This ferry can transport three light cars at a time. Rolls Royce armoured cars have also been taken across. It is attached to a wire stretching from bank to bank. In the flood season the ferrying across of cars is difficult. The Zab comes down with great violence and fills up the wide bed, which, in summer months, is dry and only about 80-100 yards wide. During the flood period the ferry is inopera tive for considerable periods. The wire has to be dismantled, and the ferry taken across by a motor boat lashed alongside. Tracks .—Tracks are only fit for pack transport. Some of them, as for example, the Zakho-Amadia track via Baroshki and Daudiyah and the Dohuk-Amadia track could be made passable for carts without much labour. The route from Merwanen, via Maidan Jashush, to Shernakh, could be made passable for wheels, but only with considerable work. All tracks leading south from Julamerk and Neri to Amadia and Rowanduz are difficult mountain paths entirely closed bysnow from December to April for movement on any scale. There are no supplies on these routes except water and fuel, which are plentiful at all times. The only track from Rowanduz to the Persian frontier which could be made passable for wheels is the one passing through Dergala to Rayat. During the war the Russians did considerable work on this route, and used it for wheeled transport. Tracks are on an average from 3-10 ft. wide, and have a hard rocky surface. Movement along them by troops is generally impracticable before the month of April, and the larger mountain streams are always an obstacle until the end of May, by which time the floods will have subsided and it may be possible to ford them at selected points. On many of the main tracks crossing the valley of the Khabur and Greater Zab rivers, wooden foot bridges are in existence. These are usually washed away or are removed during the floods, and reliance has to be made on kellek rafts to get across the rivers. These wooden bridges are not strong enough for animal transport. Mules have to ford or swim across, their loads being taken off and carried across the bridge. Arbil—Rowanduz Road .—Before leaving the general question of roads and tracks in Central Kurdistan, mention should be made(C16145) E of the Arbil-Rowanduz road, although it is not actually located in the area under review. This route is a newly constructed motor road with a B.2 classification. By the autumn of 1928 the road had reached a poird about 10 miles from Rowanduz. The remaining part—through the Rowanduz gorge—is the most difficult of the whole route. Owing, however, to the severity of winter conditions in those parts it cannot be finished before 1929. On its completion it is intended to continue the construction of a motor road to the Persian frontier through Dergela and Rayat, and to link up with a similar road via Sauj Bulagh, projected by the Persian Government, to Tabriz. The completion of the entire programme, which it is hoped will be in 1930, will not only open up the Rowanduz district and bring it into closer contact with the Central Government, but should create a large transit trade route between north-west Persia and Traq, from Tabriz to Arbil and thence to Baghdad and Mosul. Authority for Upkeep. —Responsibility for the upkeep of roads in Traq falls on the Department of Public Works. There is an executive engineer resident in Mosul. Labour. —Unskilled labour is available locally from the villages in the vicinity of the roads. Skilled labour, such as masons and supervisors, are usually brought from Mosul. For amount of labour available in the different districts see Chapter II (Population), para. 5. Metal. —Metal used is 2-in. gauge limestone, obtained from local quarries, and shingle from the beds of the many streams. Culverts. —Culverts are of two types— {a) masonry or concrete, {b) pressed steel (corrugated) circular culverts. The majority are of masonry or concrete construction. There are a few of type {b) which are being replaced by type {a), or by concrete crossings (Irish bridges). Concrete Crossings. —Concrete crossings are constructed over shallow channels, which are soft or under water in winter, as a substitute for culverts. Bridges. —In the Traq portion of Central Kurdistan bridges are of a general type capable of bearing heavy traffic, and are of steel framework construction or masonry. All bridges are fireproof. Steel trough bridges are constructed over any span less than 30 ft. wide. Larger spans are crossed by lattice steel framework on masonry piers. It is expected that all wooden trestle bridges, of which a few are in existence on minor routes, will be replaced by steel ones within two years. No definite details regarding bridges in the Turkish portion of Central Kurdistan are available.98 Irrigation Ditches. —There are very few irrigation ditches intersecting roads. In summer, except in the immediate vicinity of the livers, they are all dry. The ground on either side can therefore be used generally. Desert Areas. —No desert areas are encountered. The country between the Tigris and the Greater Zab south of the mountains is an undulating plain. The surface in some places is stony, but light wheeled vehicles can generally make their way across country. Light cars would have to select their route as the undulations are sometimes steep. Near the rivers, and in the vicinity of villages with perennial springs, there is considerable rice cultivation in summer. In these localities the ground is very soft and quite impassable for all types of wheeled vehicles. 2. Navigable Waterways. Description. [See also Chapter IV, para. 3.) The Tigris. —Above Mosul the Tigris is navigable by kelleks (rafts) floated downstream. This raft navigation commences at Diarbekr. On arrival at Mosul the rafts are broken up, the skins are deflated and returned to the starting point overland. Details of kellek construction on the Tigris are given in Table 6 . The speed depends on the strength of the current. In ordinary times it is 3| m.p.h. drifting and rowing. The duration of the voyage varies according to the season. In high water rafts descend from Diarbekr to Jazirat-ibn-Omar in five days, but in low water the voyage may take from 12 to 15 days. From Jazirat-ibn-Omar to Mosul the times are respectively two days and from five to six days. Below Mosul the river is navigable for shallow draft steamers, which usually make their first trip upstream from Baghdad at the beginning of March. They are unable to continue after the first week in June. At present there is only one steamer on the river, which plies between the railhead at Baiji and Mosul, goods being brought up from Baghdad by train. There are also native built boats, which are used for transport purposes in both directions. These boats drift downstream, and are pulled up against the current. It takes about 12 days to pull this type of craft from Baiji to Mosul, and in adverse weather conditions it may take about 15 days. The Bohtan Su. —The Bohtan Su, the principal tributary of the Tigris, is not navigable except for a few miles near its junction with the main river.The Khabur—The Khabur is navigable by kelleks from Zakho to its junction with the Tigris between November and the middle of June. The kelleks on the Khabur are smaller than those on the Tigris {vide Table 6 ), and consist of 150-200 skins, with a carrying capacity of 5 tons. Above Zakho wooden rafts are constructed which can take a maximum load of 11 tons. The Greater Za 6 .—Raft navigation on the Greater Zab com mences at Girdamamik. In low water kelleks are constructed of 300 skins, which will take 10 tons of cargo. In high water rafts of 500 skins can be used. 3. Types of River Craft. S/mwm.—Steamers drawing less than 4 ft. of water can navigate the Tigris to Mosul. Details of the boat at present working are— ' Sadki,” steel stern-wheeler, built at Yarrow’s in 1917. Length of hull . . Breadth . . Cargo capacity . . Draught, loaded Bunkers, oil fuel Speed against the current in flood season, loaded Engines— Nominal horse power Indicated horse power Stern wheel floats (12 in number) Rudders 132 ft. 31 ft. 176 tons. 3 ft. 6 in. 18 tons. 24 knots. 320. 150. 21 ft. by 18 in. 3. Steamer is fitted with a capstan in the bow used for hauling when aground on mud banks. A sister ship, the “ Shergat,” is not in commission. The journey from Sharqat to Mosul takes two days, of which 36 hours are actual steaming. The boat is tied up at night. On the downstream voyage Sharqat is reached in about six to seven hours. There is an obstruction about 20 miles below Mosul, which laden steamers sometimes have difftculty in negotiating. There is, however, said to be plenty of water towards the right bank. The “ Sadki ” normally performs about ten trips on this run during the flood season. Pilots state that the type of “ Flyboat,” drawing 3 ft. 6 in. with 80 tons of cargo, used by the Army during the war on the lower reaches of the Tigris, could navigate the river to Mosul in the summer time. They certainly came up as far as Sharqat.100 Kelleks .—Details of kellek construction are contained in the following table :— Table 7. Details of Construction of Kelleks on the River Tigris. Stretch of River. No. of Skins. Number of Bullies. Carrying Capacity. Time Construct. Crew. High water. Low water. Diarbekr to Jazirat- ibn-Omar 140 140 50 4 tons 4 days 2 Jazirat - ibn - Omar to Mosul 300 300 100 10 tons 6 days 2 Mosul to Baghdad 800 600 300 45 tons 9 days 4 250 35 tons 7 days 4 Boats .—The native-built flat-bottomed boat with a pointed bow, known as a “ tarradeh ” or “ shaktur,” has a carrying capacity of about 3 tons. These boats are used all the year round. 4. Physical Characteristics. Distances of the various localities are from Diarbekr, north of which the Tigris rises in Geuljik.Nature of Waterway Traffic. —The amount of waterway traffic varies with the seasons and with the demand for the product of the various districts. The most important centres, from which cargoes are obtained above Mosul, are Diarbekr, Sairt, Challek and Jazirat-ibn-Omar. These places export the following to Mosul ■— Diarbekr . . Sairt Challek Jazirat-ibn-Omar . . Wool, mohair, potatoes, oak-galls, dried fruits (apricots and apples), wheat and peas. Wool, mohair, oak-galls, dried fruits, honey and rugs. Firewood and charcoal. Wool, mohair, oak-galls, tanning materials, peas and—when there is demand in Mosul—grain, ghi (fats) and raisins. From Mosul the principal export by river is grain and timber. The wooden bullies are sometimes sold when the raft reaches its destination. The steamers bring up manufactured articles and tea, sugar, etc. Water Transport Agencies. —There are no water transport agencies. Kellek rafts and boats are owned by a number of individuals working independently. Requisitions for transport of this nature can best be done through the local authorities. There are sufficient materials for the construction of about 50 kelleks of various sizes at Mosul, and at Jazirat-ibn-Omar for about 30. Boats, which are usually scattered on the river between Sharqat and Mosul, number about 80. In order to concentrate these craft at least 10 days’ notice would be necessary. Two steamers, the “ Sadki ” and the “ Shergat ” [see page 99), sister ships, are owned by a Jewish railway contractor named Hayim, in Baghdad. He has an agent in Mosul n amed Muhammad Safar, who deals wdth the forwarding of cargo. Personnel. —Personnel employed on river traffic are all Muhammadan. Mosul “ kellekchis ” (raftsmen) are Arab and Jazirat-ibn-Omar men Kurds. Capacity of Craft for Military Purposes. —The two steamers, “ Sadki ” and “ Shergat,” were hospital ships during the war. They were then fitted with an ice plant and two dynamos for electric light. These fittings have now been removed to make room for cargo. Steamers, in the flood season only, could undertake the forwarding of military stores to keep pace with an advance along the river banks. They could also be used as patrols to protect traffic from marauding bands of Arabs on the look-out for loot.Kelleks and boats could be made use of to forward stores for any force working downstream. In the contrary direction they would be available for the evacuation of wounded, refugees and stores, and so keep the roads clear for movements of troops and motor transport. Kelleks can be utilised as ferries, but they are so clumsy that the transport of a large number of troops with all their equipment would be a lengthy proceeding. In the spring of 1927, in the flood season, a boat was utilised to ferry troops across the Greater Zab in the neighbourhood of Rezan. This boat was built at Mosul, was dismembered and put on a Fiat lorry and transported to Aqra. Thence it was carried on 17 mules, across two ranges of hills, via Zibar to the Zab. The boat ferried 45 men with their equipment on each journey. Wharf and Unloading Facilities .—There are no fixed anchorages on the river stretch between Sharqat and Mosul. Steamers tie up to the bank at night, and on arrival at Mosul come alongside below the first of the two boat bridges, which are not opened for river traffic. There are a number of mooring posts for kelleks at the principal centres from which cargoes are obtained. The craft are tied to these and the cargo man-handled ashore. If a kellek requires to moor at a place where there is no mooring post available, it is driven close to the shore and the tow rope is weighted with heavy stones to prevent it drifting away. Limiting Factors for Military Transport .—The use of the Tigris for purposes of military transport is limited by the seasonable variations of the river, and by the fact that at present, owing to the lack of suitable craft, it can only be made use of downstream. If light draught steam launches and small barges were introduced it would be a valuable communication in both directions in summer and winter. Sailing boats are useless as the prevailing winds are contrary, i.e., from the north, and the course of the river is so tortuous that winds which may be favourable in one stretch are directly adverse in the next. Navigation for any but power-driven craft upstream is, therefore, impracticable. Protection of the long course of the river would be a heavy burden on any force. The banks are inhabited by both settled and nomad tribes of Arabs, who are always ready to seize any opportunity of loot. A system of patrols and defended localities or posts would be essential. 5. Railways. There are no railways, or any projected, in this area. The nearest railheads are Baiji and Kirkuk.6. Telegraphs, Telephones, and Postal. (a) Telegraphs. General System. ’Iraq Telegraphs .—Mosul is connected by telegraph lines to the following places :— (i) Zakho and thence with the Turkish telegraph system. (ii) Dohuk and Amadia. This line branches off from the Zakho line near Simel. (hi) Aqra. (iv) Arbil by a line passing through Eski-Kellek. During the flood season, from January to the end of April, a telegraph office is opened at the latter place. (v) Tel Hugenah. From which point lines are branched off to Zummar, on the Tigris, and to Tel Afar and Balad Sin jar. Turkish 1 elegraphs .—In the area under Turkish administration the following lines are known to exist :— (i) Jazaret-ibn-Omar (T.O.)—Shernakh (T.O.)—Desht Alto—Segir—Ghlawa—Elk (T.O.)—Peyanis (T.O.)— Julamerk (T.O.) Diza Gawar (T.O.)—Bashkala (T.O.)—Khoshab (f.O.)—Van (I.O.). A line also runs from Diza Gawar to Neri and a branch from Tulamerk to Chal. J (n) Mardin (T.O.)—Midiat (T.O.)—Jazirat-ibn-Omar (TO.). On this line a branch goes from Mardin to Nisibin. Van is stated to be in communication with the following places :— ° (i) Bitlis, Sairt and Diarbekr by a line along the south shore of the lake. (ii) Mush via Bitlis. (iii) Serai. (iv) Dilman and Urumieh, by a line branching off at Bashkala. From Vostan, to the west of Van, a line runs south to Shattakh. Diarbekr, which is connected with Angora and other centres in ^ ? la ’ ^ m telegraphic communication with Mardin ; so completing the circuit. In 1928 the 'Iraq telegraphic system since the war, connected with the Turkish J azirat-ibn-Omar. was, for the first time system via Zakho and (b) Telephones. rde P h ones.—K\\ telegraph lines within the 'Iraq frontier imr. a exc&lt; fP tlon ^e line to Arbil, have telephones super- admTnfatrative disWctt. S ° Vernment officials at headquarters o!The telephone system is purely a government service, and. is only extended to the public in Mosul where an exchange exists. There is a local telephone system in operation, which connects Zakho with the military posts on the frontier. These posts are established at Dornakh, Birsivi, Shiranis-Islam, Pirakh, Masis and Faishkhabur. This system is manned by ’Iraq Army personnel, and is maintained by the Posts and Telegraphs Department. Turkish Telephones. —Telephone lines known to be in operation in Turkish territory are as follows :— Jazirat - ibn - Omar (office)—Gund - i - Hadid (office)— Besbin—Dest Alto—Zerawak (office)—Shwet—Karoar (office)—Baijo (office)—Merga (office)—Alamun (office)— Ashita (office)—Swara Yuni—Chal (office)—Tulamerk (office). From Gund-i-Hadid a branch line goes to Magharah, and from Besbin a line runs to Kuliyah and Matah Kavin. (c) Postal. Postal services exist between Mosul and all towns inside the frontiers. Administration. —Posts, telegraphs and telephones come under the Director of Posts and Telegraphs, Baghdad. Employees. —Operators and telephone repairers are drawn from all nationalities. Christians and Jews are considered to be the most efficient, and attain a very fair standard of ability. The proficiency test for operators is 20 words a minute. All classes are employed on general construction and repair work. Telegraph Lines, Posts, and Insulators. —All lines are overhead. Those crossing the Tigris at Mosul are led across the river to posts aligned along the masonry bridge. Iron posts are most common, but wooden ones are in use on some stretches of the lines. Wooden posts can be obtained in any number from Dohuk and other local areas. These wooden posts last for three years before they are rendered unserviceable by the attacks of insects. The white porcelain insulator is in general use. Telegraph and Telephone Apparatus. (a) Telegraphs. —The ordinary type of closed circuit instrument is used. ip) Telephones. —Vibrator telephones are used on all lines.108 7. Wireless Stations. There is a main W/T station staffed by R.A.F. personnel at Mosul responsible for all the outstations mentioned below Continuous watch is kept with Baghdad, the outstations comine up for traffic periodically during the 24 hours. Outstation W/T pack sets similarly manned by R.A.F. operators are located at Barzan and Diana (Rowanduz). They are mobile, and normally work with Mosul main W/T station. They also communicate with machines engaged on frontier reconnaissance or operations in their area. 8. Air Communications. Communications by air are in the hands of the Royal Air Force. Weekly air mail services are run from Baghdad to Mosul for official traffic and correspondence only. Air communications between other places in this area are maintained as required. 9. Route Reports. following short reports deal with nine main routes in the Iraq portion of the area under review :— (1) Rowanduz to Neri via Shaitaneh and Kani Resh (63 miles) ( 2 ) Mosul to Aqra ( 57 | miles) (3) Aqra to Barzan (21 miles) (4) Mosul to Zakho (76 miles) (5) Zakho to Amadia via Spindarok and Daudiyah (55| miles) ^ ( 6 ) Mosul to Amadia via Dohuk (91 miles) (7) Amadia to Geramus via Mazurka (48| miles) ( 8 ) Aqra to Amadia (Bebadi) via Piris Dagh (401 miles) (9) Barzan to Rowanduz via Maznar (50 miles) Page 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 116 No attempt has been made to include reports on routes in the Turkish portion of Central Kurdistan.

It is, however, considered that the general character of these routes has not radically changed, and that the information contained in the above publications would prove substantially correct.Route No. 2—ROWANDUZ to NERI via Shaitaneh—Kalat Haruna Kani Resh—Begijni—Evlian—Neri (63 miles). Map References .—Degree Sheets 1/C and 1/D. Classification. —C.4. General Description—This route is the best and most direct from Rowanduz to Neri. The first 12 and the last 5 miles to Kani Resh traverse comparatively flat plain ; the intermediate miles lie across an undulating plateau of very broken nature. The entire route is passable for pack transport in summer. Since the old Turkish bridges crossing the Merga Su and the Rudbar-i- Birasgird are now broken, the route is impassable after rain or during the season of melting snow (April to June). For military purposes it is not utilizable between December and June. The road could be made fit for light carts and field guns if bridging operations on a large scale were carried out. The country is bare, uncultivated and very sparsely populated. The comparative scarcity of trees facilitates aerial reconnaissance. The Ser-i-Berdi Pass is the most difficult obstacle, and is closed for pack animals from January to March. This obstacle cannot be avoided or turned. Natural Obstacles .—Mile 1. Rudbar - i - Rowanduz. The destruction of the bridge would necessitate a detour of 2 miles and a crossing by a ford impassable after rain or in season of melting snow. Mile 4. Ford across the Merga Su. Impassable after rain or in time of melting snow. Mile 12. Difficult crossing. Impassable after heavy rain. Mile 12 to mile 15. Very steep climb ; surface very bad, road littered with stones and boulders. At all times difficult for pack transport. Mile 23 to mile 26. Cross beds of small valleys liable to become swampy after rain. Mile 26 to mile 27. Very steep descent along the re-entrant into Haruna Plain. Surface good. Mile 28. Ford across the Rudbar-i-Birasgird. Impassable after heavy rain and in season of melting snow. Mile 40|. Ford across the Rudbar-i-Haji Beg. Impassable after heavy rain and in season of melting snow. Bridge of timber and brushwood—unfit for pack animals —200 yards above the ford. Mile 50. Ser-i-Berdi Pass. Mile 60. The Shemsdinan Su. Crossed by stone bridge at Begirdi.

The road is impassable for all motor traffic for several days at a time in the rainy season. It is built of earth for the most part until the Zakho Pass is approached, when the surface becomes rough and stony. The road would deteriorate rapidly under a heavy increase of traffic even in dry weather. It traverses undulating country, rising gradually about 400 ft. in 50 miles, 600 ft. in the next 15 miles and 550 ft. to the top of the Zakho Pass, whence it drops 1,280 ft. in miles to Zakho. The road over the Pass is well graded and maintained in good repair. Rolls Royce armoured cars can negotiate the sharp bends on the Pass with difficulty. Natural Obstacles. —The main obstacles in the route are :— Mile 31, the Buqaq Su, crossed by a steel girder bridge of single span.

Extent of Cultivated Lands.—Central Kurdistan, except in the plains between the mountain ranges and the Tigris, is a sparsely cultivated country. With an extended use of river water, however, a large area north-east and south of Mosul could be rendered productive. Nature of Crops. —Winter and summer crops are grown, but the latter cultivation is small owing to the lack of water in the plains. Wheat and barley are the staple crops, but rice and other cereals are grown where conditions permit. Winter crops are wheat, barley, lentils, beans and millet, all of which are mostly raised on rainwater. • Summer crops aie rice, millet, cotton, sesame, mash, onions, coriander, etc. Rice is grown on irrigation channels from the Greater Zab in the vicinity of villages where there are springs and perennial streams. In the mountains, where rivers run through most of the valleys, the summer crops are the most important. Rice is the mam product, but tobacco is also produced in certain localities. Quantities are only sufficient for the needs of the inhabitants. Fruits. —Fruit is grown in the mountain districts, especially around Dohuk, where apples, pommegranates, figs, peaches and apricots are all produced in large quantities. From the north eastern areas walnuts and almonds are sent down to Mosul. Vineyards cover the slopes of the hills around most villages, those of Dohuk and Mizuri being the largest. The grapes are dried into raisins. List of Products. —Products of the country are (1) Wheat, barley, lentils, tobacco, rice, simsim, mash, millet and cotton. (2) Ladies-fingers, brinjals, cucumbers melons onions, potatoes, turnips, radishes, carrots, beans and spinach. (3) Grapes, apples, pears, plums, apricots, mulberries, black berries, walnuts, almonds, pomegranates, quinces and figs. Methods of Cultivation.— CvMNMion is primitive, and the only agricultural apparatus is the wooden plough drawn by mules, oxen or donkeys. The general procedure is to plough and cross plough the land from January to the end of the ramy season. The ground then remains fallow through the summer until ram, when the seed is sown and ploughed in.120 Classification of Lands. —(1) “ Daim ” or land dependant on rainfall. This consists of the rolling downs of the Mosul plain, cultivated by Christians and Arabs. (2) “ Hawi ” lands irrigated by lifts from the river and by wells. Water is raised by “ Karits ” and Nabors (Persian wheels). (3) The foothills farmed by Yezidis and Christians. This land consists of a certain proportion of ' daim,” but is mainly dependant on small perennial streams from the hills. (4) Mountain valleys. These are inhabited by Kurds and Christians, who cultivate rice on the stream and grow vines on the hillsides. Modern methods and implements have made little appeal to the farmers of Central Kurdistan. The peasant has no idea of producing a trading surplus ; and is satisfied with a sufficiency for his immediate need. Modern methods of tillage, the intro duction of crop rotation and modern machinery are necessary before any trading surplus will become available. Periods of Sowing and Harvesting. Table 8.

Table 10 gives the amounts harvested in a year when great destruction was caused by locusts. By comparison o t e wo tables it can be realised to what an extent the productivity ot the various districts of Central Kurdistan is effected by the incidence of this plague. It is, therefore, well nigh impossible to forecast the harvests and trading surplus for any one year. If the crops are backward, owing to small or late rainfall, the destruction will be the greater, especially in the wheat and barley crops. Kice, a summer crop, is not affected, although tobacco is. Locusts. —Locusts lay their eggs from 15th May to 15th They hatch from 15th March onwards until about the 10th p , and commence to hop four days after hatching. 1 S + ^?.i, + a ft er discern in what direction they will swarm about a fortnight afte they hatched. They begin to fly generally about the 1st May and disappear towards the end of July.124 Resources of Turkish Districts. Sor. The Qadha of Sor (Mardin Vilayet). —Area under cultivation extends to about 75,000 acres, of which a half to three-quarters lies fallow. The soil is stony but fairly fertile, the yield being 7 or 8 to 1. The Qadha produces a surplus to its own needs. No recent figures for production of grain are available, but the following are post-war :— Wheat .. 7,000 tons. Barley . . 3,500 „ Millet 3,500 „ Gram 2,000 „ Raisins .. 500 „ Grape syrup 1,200 „ Other crops are rice, cotton, simsim and tobacco. Livestock. —About 20,000 sheep. Forestry. The chief wealth of the Qadha lies in its poplar plantations. Estimated number of trees is 2,000,000. Midiat. The Qadha of Midiat (Mardin Vilayet). —Area under cultiva tion 150,000 acres, of which three-quarters lies fallow. The Qadha does not produce any grain surplus to its own needs, and has frequently to import from Nisibin and Jazirat-ibn-Omar. The soil is stony and not very fertile for cereal crops. Yield about 6 or 7 to 1. F The following figures of annual products are post-war :— Wheat .. .. 12,000 tons. Barley . . .. 6,000 „ Millet .. .. 6,000 „ Raisins .. .. 800 „ Grape syrup .. 2,400 „ Of the above 400 tons of raisins and 1,200 tons of grape syrr are exported. Livestock.

The Diarbekr District.—Viodoices but little surplus to its own requirements. The southern plain villages feed the hill districts. Four hundred tons of grain, wheat and barley, in the propoition of 2 to 1, might be available in a year of good harvests.Annual Production. Wheat .. Barley . Millet Gram 6.000 tons 3.000 „ 2.000 „ 1,000 „ Livestock. —About 20,000 sheep and goats. Derek. The Derek Qadha {Diarbekr Vilayet).—This Qudha consists of three belts placed in order of fertility : (i) The Jazirat-ibn-Omar plain ; (ii) foothills and upland valleys ; (hi) hill country. (i) The soil of the plain is fertile, and gives a yield of 20 to 25 to 1. (ii) Yield 12 to 1. (iii) Very little cultivation. Yield 6 to 1. Inhabitants subsist chiefly on their flocks and on the collection of oak-galls. Irrigated Crops. —A number of villages in classes (i) and (ii) grow rice, which is renowned for its good quality. Forests. —Supply oak-galls, with an annual production of about 200 tons. Fruits. —The hill villages cultivate vines. Yearly product of raisins and grape syrup is put at 1,000 tons. Diza-Gawar and Julamerk. The Diza-Gawar-Julamerk Area (Hakkiari Vilayet).—This area has not recovered from the devastation of the War Irrigation channels have fallen into disuse and on y su cien for the population is produced. In the 1925 operations the Turkish forces brought down supplies from Van. Elk. , The Elk District {Hakkiari Vilayet).—In normal years t ere is no surplus. in Jazirat-ibn-Omar.126 plains, the fertile districts round the border of the lake, Mush plain, the country round Khinis, the Melasgird and Bulanuk plains and the Akhlat and Arjish districts. In spring and early summer the fish from Lake Van are an important article of food. There is a great deficiency of wood, the country being quite bare of trees. To the south of the lake there are hilly wooded districts, from which firewood could be drawn. In a year when the crops were below the average the Van Vilayet raised— Wheat .. .. 23,000 tons. Barley .. .. 4,690 „ These figures are pre-war. It is probable that, owing to the wholesale deportation and massacre of the Christian population during the war, quantities are now very much lower. Lucerne is grown to a considerable extent for fodder, and can be cut a number of times in a season. Green fodder is plentiful on the uplands. In the autumn the dried grass or hay is cut and stacked for winter use. The gardens and orchards round Lake Van produce a quantity of fruit. Grapes, apricots, plums, peaches, pears, walnuts and apples are grown, whilst dried fruits and pomegranates are also piocurable. Of vegetables, melons, pumpkins, onions, cucumbers and cabbages are common ; haricots, potatoes and tomatoes less common. Turkish Money and Weights .—Mejidieh = 20 piasters Ks. 1/3/—.

Cattle. Sheep, goats, oxen, cows, horses, mules and donkeys consti tute the main wealth of most of the inhabitants of Central Kur distan. Cattle have a well-developed hump, the natural reserve for foodstuff, which enables them to survive the hot summer season, when all herbage except in the river areas is withered and dry. Details of the different species are given in the following table:— Table 12. Cattle. Animal. Remarks. District in which found. Cows . .

Donkeys, Camels.128 The importation of stud animals in the form of Sindi and Ayrshire bulls employed on the Military Dairy Farm at Mosul resulted in progeny showing a marked increase in size and milk production. Time has now almost eliminated this characteristic from the crosses. A great susceptibility to rinderpest was noticed in these animals. 3. Dairy Produce. Dairying is not an industry in Central Kurdistan. Milk, butter and cheese are produced locally for the requirements of the inhabitants only. Quantities are so small as to be of no value for military purposes. 4. Transport. Motor transport can be used on the road systems radiating from Mosul to centres on the edge of the mountain ranges. It could also be employed on certain portions of the roads in the vicinity of Van, Diarbekr, Diza-Gawar and Urumieh plain. The general form of transport, however, available for military purposes in Central Kurdistan, is pack. Pack animals in order of importance are mules, horses, camels, donkeys and bullocks. (1) Motor Transport .—There are a certain number of motor vehicles available for transport purposes in Mosul, which could be requisitioned. Numbers are as follows :— Table 13. Motor Transport. Type. Number. Rate of Hire. 3-ton lorries . . 1^-ton lorries 3 21 Arrangement. Annas 12 per ton per mile. 1-ton trucks . . 41 Cars of various descriptions. Fords and Overlands mostly. 243 Summer, annas 6 per mile. Winter, annas 8 per mile. The following men are in a position to contract for the supply of motor transport :— Lufti ibn Ibrahim. Jamil ibn Ibrahim. Jamil Dallal. Jaboori ibn Ghazool. There are few motor vehicles owned outside Mosul.(2) Draught Transport. —The use of draught transport is confined to the roads, which, during the rainy season, may be unfit for several days at a time owing to the very heavy nature of the soil. Draught transport will undertake the conveyance of stores and goods outside their own local areas. Details are as follows :— Table 14. Draught Transport. Type. Quantity. Load. Rates of Hire. Springless, 1- or 2-mule carts. 90, of which 60 are usually immediately available. \ ton Varies with the time of year and district to which they are to proceed. Hiring can best be done by reference to the Municipal authorities in Mosul, outside of which few carts are available. (3) Pack Transport. —Troops operating in the mountains of Central Kurdistan are entirely dependant on pack animals for their transport. The supply of these animals will greatly depend on the attitude of the inhabitants, who, if benevolent, are in a position to offer the use of very large numbers of mules and horses. Numbers available for requisition will also depend on the time of the year that they are required, as the nomadic tribes, which pass the winter and early spring in the foothills to the north-east and north-west of Mosul, own mules and horses which they utilise for transport purposes on their migrations. It would be difficult, however, to induce the nomads to hire their animals , and, unless the tribes adopted an openly hostile attitude, when their animals could be seized, supplies could not be relied on from this source. Types of Pack Animals.—The following are types of pack transport in general use :— Mules —These are bv far the most important transport animals and can be taken throughout Central Kurdistan Mules can traverse the most difficult mountain tracks, which horses would be unable to negotiate. They can also be induced to swim across rivers more readily than other pack animals. Horses. —Horses can be used on the tracks which keep to the valleys. They are not so hardy as mules, and require more attention and feeding. The native bied horse oi pony is suie footed and seldom makes a mistake, but they are not often seen in the mountain areas. (C16145) FLoads, Forage Ration, and Rates of Hire. —Table 17 gives the approximate loads carried by pack transport with their forage ration and rates of hire. Table 17. Loads, Forage, Rates of Hire. Animals. Normal Load. Forage Ration. Rate of Hire. Working. Non-working. Mules 160-200 lbs. \ 10 lbs. barley and /Rs.2/8 Rs. 2/- Horses .. 160-200 lbs./ 10 lbs. bhoosa \Rs. 3/- Rs .2/8 Donkeys 120-150 lbs. 8 lbs. barley and 8 lbs. bhoosa /Rs. 1/8 \Rs. 2/- Rs. 1/- Rs. 1/8 Camels .. 300 lbs. in the hills, 350 lbs. in the plains. In summer are fed on desert scrub. In winter sub sist on a mixture of bran and flour made into balls about 6 in. dia meter, four being the ration. According to the length of the journey. No special rate laid down. Rates of hire depend on the season of the year and whether crops are scarce or plentiful. Pack animals obtained locally will work anywhere they are likely to be required. The difficulty is not with the goodwill of the owners to send them outside their own districts, but is with the supplying of them in the sparsely cultivated areas in the mountains where grain is scarce and insufficient for the needs of an influx of a large number of animals. In most cases enough fodder and grain has to be carried to last the journey. Pack Saddles. —The pack saddles in common use are made of canvas and padded with straw. Loads are tied on either side of the animal, equally balanced, by means of ropes. Considerable time is lost if loads have to be taken off to negotiate any difficult piece of country in the mountain tracks. 5. Minerals. The mineral wealth of Central Kurdistan consists of various ores and of earthy minerals such as salt and gypsum and of the fuels, coal and oil. The commercial value of the minerals is a question for the future. The difficulties of transport and the unsettled condition of the country have so far prevented their profitable exploitation except for local purposes. Information as to the extent and grade of the mineral deposits is still inadequate. Economic geology can at present only direct attention to theprobable positions of the future mining fields without being able to indicate whether the mines are capable of immediate development. Such details as are available are given in the following table Table 18. Mineral Resources of Central Kurdistan. Mineral. Where found. Remarks. Coal At Dohuk, Alqosh, Harbol, Sheranis, Zakho, and in the Doski country. In the Boh- tan valley and north of Mardin. Deposits are bituminous and of little value as steam coal.

Gypsum, Exist in the hills and foothills The marble is a soft-grained marble, near Mosul in large quanti- stone, and is much used limestone ties. for building purposes and for the manufacture of mortar or “ juss.” Oil There is an oil well at Zakho The refinery at Zakho has an annual production of— Kerosine, 7,200 galls. Burning oil, 38,400 galls. Inferior petrol, 2,880 galls. The gypsiferous rocks, which appear on the surface in the Zakho neighbourhood, seem to offer possibilities of oil in considerable quantities. 6. Timber. Timber is obtained mainly from the districts about the Turco- Traq frontier and from the mountainous region north of Rowanduz. These districts supply walnut, chestnut and poplars, all of which are utilised for building purposes.Supplies are also imported from Turkey, but this trade is diminishing as the use of iron girders in the construction of houses is on the increase. Quantities of timber obtained in the year 1926-27 from the frontier districts in ’Iraq were :— Table 19. Poplars — 18 feet long by 6 inches diameter 20 „ „ 12 „ 20 „ „ 16 „ Walnut planks — 6 feet long by 9-12 inches broad 7 „ „ 13-14 „ 8 „ „ 15 Planks undefined — 11 feet long by 6 inches broad 15 „ „ 8 17i „ „ 10 61,000 10,000 10,000 5,650 2,000 2,000 6,000 5.000 3.000 Imports of Timber from Turkey. —Timber imported from Turkey is cut into lengths, for which there are no equivalent terms in English. These with the corresponding amounts are as follows :— Table 20. Imports of Timber from Turkey—Year 1926-27. Description.

Firewood. —Five hundred and fifty tons valued at Rs. 25,334. 7. Commerce. The outlet of the export trade of the Mosul area is to and through Traq and to a lesser extent Syria. Turkish Trade. —Importations from Turkey consist mainly of timber cereals, vegetables, dried fruits and tanning materials. Nearly all these pass through Mosul in transit for Baghdad and abroad.134 Exports to Turkey are limited to textiles and manufactured articles, which come via Basrah or Aleppo. The districts served are the’Vilayets of Diarbekr, Hardin and Hakkiari. This transit trade passes along the following routes Mosul-Mardin-Diarbekr—Kharput. Mosul- Jazirat-ibn-Omar-Bitlis-Erzerum. Mosul-Amadia-J ulamerk-V an. Mosul-Zakho-Van. Turkish trade is small compared to the volume of the trade with Baghdad. Trade with Baghdad—The Baghdad trade route is by far the most important, and in the Tigris Mosul possesses the means of cheap transport, an economic factor of the greatest importance. Wheat, barley, timber and firewood from the districts near the Khabur and Tigris are taken down these rivers to Mosul by kelleks (rafts). More perishable articles, wool, mohair fabrics, gall-nuts, tobacco, etc., are brought to Mosul by mule caravan. These, with the products of Mosul itself, marble, gypsum, sand stone, dried fruits, pass through in transit to Baghdad. Imports to Mosul from Baghdad are textiles, manufactured goods, coffee, tea, and sugar, which are distributed to the outside districts by caravan transport. Syrian Trade. —Such imports as silk fabrics, etc., articles which are of considerable value in proportion to their weight, reach Mosul either through the Syrian desert or by Baghdad. A large export trade is done in sheep, which are driven to Mosul by the nomad tribesmen and there sold to Syrian merchants. Persian Trade. —The trade with Persia is very small, and is limited to imports of carpets, fruits and livestock. Exports are practically nil. With the opening of the Rowanduz-Rayat- Tabriz road, Persian trade should considerably increase. Domestic Trade. —In the mountains the inhabitants are comparatively few and produce food-stuffs mainly for their own use. These regions have to depend on mule transport, and practically the only kind of trade is that carried on in products which have so high an intrinsic value that they can bear the relatively high cost of this form of transport. These articles are tobacco, wool, mohair, gall-nuts, and marten skins, which are brought into the local centres, where they are exchanged for manufactured articles, cloth, needles, lamps, etc. Import and Export Tables. —No precise statistics of the foreign trade of Central Kurdistan are available, but some indication of its value may be derived from the import and export figures at Mosul, which is the emporium of Central Kurdistan. Tables 21 and 22 give the annual exports and value. Tables 23 and 24 give the annual imports and value.136 The following table shows the value in rupees of the principa commodities imported during the three financial years :— Table 23. • fip u ! jjtyatt jittured socM Articles. 1923-24. 1924-25. 1925-26. ’Iw?

A very large volume of imports, such as manufactured articles from Europe, are brought into Mosul from Baghdad. These goods pay ’Iraq Government duties before arriving in Mosul, after which they are free to circulate anywhere in 'Iraq territory. Customs Tariff. Tariff .—The customs tariff is as is laid down in the Customs Tariff Schedule of the Government of 'Iraq. The general principle is an import duty of 11 per cent, on all goods, and an export duty of 1 per cent, ad valorem with the exception of horsesexported for commercial purposes, which are assessable to customs duty at the rate of Rs. 5 per horse plus 1 per cent, duty ad valorem Chemicals, drugs, medicines, electrical fittings, dyes and manu factured textiles pay 15 per cent. ; and arms and ammunitions, clocks, carpets, silk, opium and motor vehicles pay 20 per cent’ 'Iraq Posts.—Customs posts are established at Faishkhabur and Dornakh to supervise the trade with Turkey. The former post is chiefly interested in the river-borne traffic, and all goods entering Iraq are checked and passed on to Mosul for collection of customs dues. Dornakh deals with the land trade, and as at Faishkhabur goods are passed on to Mosul after checking. A small customs post is also located at Amadia, and is con cerned with the commerce across the frontier to and from Julamerk and the surrounding districts. This trade is insignificant. Persian trade is supervised by the customs post at Rayat, which forwards incoming caravans to Rowanduz and Arbil. Turkish Posts .—Goods entering Turkish territory by land are checked at Kurkit, on the west bank of the Hazil River, opposite Dornakh. River-borne trade is dealt with at Jazirat-ibn-Omar. System of Taxation .—The old system of “ farming ” out taxes has been abolished, and taxes are now levied direct by the local Government officials in each district. This system is more satis factory, although it has its disadvantages. The estimation of crops previous to taxation is bound to be somewhat inaccurate, and leads to complaints against the estimators. The general principle is an impost, which goes to the Govern ment, of 10 per cent, of all produce. The animal or “ koda ” tax is levied at the rate of 8 annas per sheep or goat, and one rupee per camel or buffalo. Collections of revenue in the Mosul Liwa for the financial year 1926-27 were as indicated in Table 25.139 8. Water Transport. The only form of water transport available is— {a) Native boats (“ Tarradehs ”). (b) Rafts (“ Kelleks ”). {a) There are about 80 boats on the river between Mosul and Sharqat. These are utilised in both directions, drifting down stream with the current and towing in the contrary direction. Capacity from 3-5 tons. {b) Kelleks based on Mosul number about 50, and are used for river transport downstream only. There are also some 30 owned at Jazirat-ibn-Omar. These ply between Jazirat-ibn- Omar and Mosul, being broken up at the latter place, and returned to the starting point overland. The weight carrying capacity of kelleks may vary from 5 tons to as much as 35 tons according to size and the state of the river. For further details regarding water transport see Section No. 2, “ Navigable Waterways,' of Chapter 6 , Communications.141 CHAPTER VIII. AVIATION. 1. Turkish Air Force. There are no units of the Turkish Air Force located in Central Kurdistan within the limits of the area under report. When the situation demands the use of aircraft, operations are initiated from the permanent aerodrome at Diarbekr. From this centre which operations are being conducted within the scope of their air endurance. The unit at Diarbekr is an aviation company, equipped with (12 Junker J.21 (B.M.W. 265 h.p.) type) reconnaissance aircraft. Detachments from this unit took part in the operations against the Kurdish tribes in 1925 and 1926. Distance from Mosul .. 200 miles, north-west. Communications .. Telegraph to Mardin and Sairt. This landing ground was used during the operations in the Goyan territory in 1926. It is not kept up, and can hardly be distinguished from the surrounding country. There are no sheds or repair facilities. Communications .. Railhead at Nisibin. Roads to Nisibin and Mardin. Telegraph to Nisibin and Mardin.

Periods of Heat and Cold .—In the plains the seasons consist of a cool winter, a short spring, a long, hot and almost rainless summer, and an autumn of about two months duration. The hot weather commences in May and lasts till the end of September. In the mountain areas the summer is more temperate, spring is longer and much later, and the winter naturally becomes the more severe as the altitude increases. Tfam.—Between November and April there are periods of rain. The annual rainfall in northern ’Iraq is approximately 12 in. to 14 in., and the number of rainy days about 30. [See also Chapter V, Climate, Table of Rainfall.) Clouds .—In summer little or no high cloud is seen owing to the dryness of the air. Between November and April there is a considerable amount of low cloud, which is more frequent in the mountains. Snow .—Snow is seldom seen in the plains around Mosul, and when a fall does take place it does not lie for any time. In the hills the first fall takes place in mid-December, the valleys are not clear until the end of March and the summits until July. Fogs .—Fog occurs during the winter months, and generally commences and clears before mid-day, although it occasionally persists through the afternoon. On these occasions it is very thin. Effect on Flying. —Cross-country flying in the plains is inter rupted in the winter months, when rain may put landing grounds out of action for a period varying with the amount and duration of the fall, and in the summer by duststorms. In the mountains cross-country flights are liable to be interrupted as the high ranges are frequently in the clouds, which also fill up the narrow valleys. Landing grounds in the hills may be unservicable for long periods at a time during the snow and rainy season. Temperatures .—A graph of the temperature inversion will be found at the end of the chapter. Ground temperatures are given in Chapter V, Climate. Effect on Aircrajt Materials. —The.folio wing defects in aircraft material has been observed, which are due to the climatic conditions:— Fuselages .—General shrinkage takes place, causing clearances between the woodwork and fittings. Glue deteriorates, enabling the laminae to separate in the plywood. Tape bindings used at the junction of butt joints on longerons become loose owing to general contraction. Main Planes and Empenage .—The shrinkage in main plane construction is very pronounced. As much as J in. clearance has been detected between the fittings at the junction of the com pression ribs and main spars.Treatment oj Protective Coverings.—KM fabric components should be well doped especially on the upper surface, as the ultra-violet ray has a tendency to destroy the internal woodwork. Shock Absorber. This material perishes very quickly, and is often unserviceable before being fitted to the machine. This is an important point and careful examination should be made. The same consideration is also applicable to rubber tubing. Tyres and Tubes .—Whenever possible the weight of the machine should be taken off the tyres, to which covers should be fitted. The maximum air pressure should not be contained in the tyres during the hot season. Low Flying Aircraft .—Very high temperatures in summer accompanied by the decrease in density of the air make it more difficult for aircraft to “ get offT Increased run has to be allowed for, and laden machines should be brought down a little faster as the liability to stall is enhanced. Machines climb more sluggishly, but can ascend high enough to clear the mountain ranges with a war load. In the hot weather extra radiators have to be fitted to engines. Overheating takes place up to 6,000 ft. during the day. It is therefore desirable to limit the hours of flying to the early morning and evening. Landing grounds in the hills are often at considerable altitudes necessitating longer runs to leave the ground and slightly increased speed on the glide. Phenomena. Duststorms. —During the autumn and spring depressions arrive from the west and south-west, giving strong easterly winds. The ground being dry, the dust, which is of a very fine nature, is raised by convectional currents and borne considerable distances by the force of the wind. Between 30 and 40 such storms occur at Mosul during the year, and during their progress the visibility is often reduced to below 30 yards. A duststorm produces immense quantities of electricity, and W/T communication is often completely suspended. The duststorm frequently rages over a great area and to a height of 7,000 ft. Dust seldom rises at Mosul except when the wind is blowing from the east. Dust-Devils. —Dust-devils occur with great frequency in summer, as many as six of these disturbances operating at once over a comparatively small area. A noteworthy feature is the absence of any suggestion of regularity in their occurrence. They are very local, and aircraft can easily avoid them by flying round. (Details are given in Chapter V.) Gales .—Gales are of rare occurrence. Nothing approaching a gale has been recorded for over two years. On previous occasions, however, they have been strong enough to tear machines from their pickets and blow them over.Cloudbursts. —Also rare, and none recorded for two years. Atmospheric Disturbances. — In the heat of the summer “ bumps ” of great violence are encountered over desert and riverine areas. In the mountains conditions are similar. The ranges are aligned from east to west at right angles to the pre vailing wind from the north and north-west. In consequence strong wind currents are set up, which cause aircraft to stagger in their line of flight and suddenly lose or gain several hundreds of feet. These “ bumps ” are occasionally strong enough to break flying wires. It is therefore most important that all bracing wires are at a proper tension. Wind Changes. —Northerly winds in the morning usually veer to west or south-west in the afternoon. The diurnal variation of wind velocity is most marked. Winds of about 5 m.p.h. increase between the hours of 22.00 to 05.00 to about 10 m.p.h. (local time). Sunshine : Midsummer. —An average of 14 hours sunshine is recorded. Midwinter.—An average of 8-4 hours sunshine is recorded. Visibility—In summer dust haze is more or less a daily occurrence. This interferes greatly with the visibility, but not to such an extent as to interfere with flying. Mirage are also often experienced. In winter slight mist is frequent in the mornings. During the winter of 1926-27 thick mist and fog varying in intensity were experienced very frequently. The average number of fog days during the months of November, December and January may be taken at about 8 to 12. In the absence of haze in summer and mist or fog in winter, the visibility is exceptionally good, and the atmosphere very clear and transparent. 5. General Nature of the Surface. Central Kurdistan, except in the plains south of the mountain ranges, cannot be said to be well adapted to the requirements of flying. The area comprised by the plains is small compared to that covered by the enormous masses of mountains and rocks, which extend up to the shores of Lake Van. The plain around Mosul is extensively cultivated in winter, but in summer is arid and dry owing to the lack of water. In the vicinity of Mosul, however, on the left bank of the Tigris, the cultivated area in summer is being increased as water pumps and native methods of irrigation are laid down. Irrigation requires water channels, and in consequence forced landings may be dangeious. Away from the river banks this danger is avoided. The same remarks apply to the banks of the other rivers which flow through the plains. In the Aqra district there is considerable rice cultivation in the foothills and on the banks of the Greater Zab.Summer crops require a lot of water, and it may be accepted that all areas under crop in the summer are soft and dangerous to land on. The mountains are precipitous and covered with forest and scrub, which can give concealment to the largest formations. The summits are bare rocks with a crest line of crags and pinnacles. The valleys between are well wooded, and in some cases so narrow that manoeuvring of aircraft is very limited. In all the valleys, large and small, there are perennial streams, from which small water channels are led off for summer cultivation in the vicinity of the villages. The surface is broken by many rents and fissures caused by mountain torrents at the time of the melting snows. Flat stretches are few and far between, and are usually covered with boulders and stones. To carry out a forced landing successfully is a matter of the greatest difficulty. Sites for Aerodromes and Landing Grounds .—Sites for aerodromes and landing grounds can readily be found in the plains, and could be rendered serviceable without the expenditure of much labour. Generally the whole mountain area is quite unsuited for such a purpose. Where landing grounds exist their inaccessibility makes the forwarding of stores and aircraft materials most difficult, as everything has to be transported by mule caravan. Landing grounds, for purposes of communication, are main tained at the main centres where garrisons are stationed. 6. Local Fuel Resources. For particulars regarding the output of the oil wells at Zakho, see Chapter VII, Resources. The quality of the oil produced is very low grade and valueless for aircraft or motor transport engines. Petrol is obtained from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s refineries at Abadan, is conveyed to Baghdad by river or rail and is then forwarded to Baiji (the present railhead on the Tigris line). From there it is brought to Mosul by animal or motor transport. In the spring floods, when the Tigris is navigable up to Mosul, it may be conveyed all the way by river. There are no local storage tanks, and reserve stocks are not held on account of the high evaporation rate of petrol contained in tins.153 CHAPTER IX. TRIBES. 1. Preliminary. The greater part of the following chapter deals only with that part of Central Kurdistan in 'Iraq territory. Accurate statistics regarding fighting strengths and the number of arms of tribes in Turkish Central Kurdistan are practically impossible to obtain. It should therefore be assumed that, unless the subject matter is quite general or the context indicates otherwise, this chapter is only concerned with the tribes of ’Iraq Central Kurdistan and with those lying immediately north of the Turco-Traq frontier. 2 . General. Although in Central Kurdistan the tribal system is found amongst Arabs, Kurds, and some of the Christians, the following remarks apply more particularly to Kurds, who form the majority of the population. Kurdish tribes are not final units incapable of reduction or expansion, nor do they represent clans descended from a common ancestor. They are agglomerations of individuals and families grouped round a family or chief for protection or aggrandisement, and united by political alliances which, owing to their instability, render the strength and influence of a particular tribe precarious and ephemeral. Tribal policy is largely directed by the chiefs, who hold their office generally, but not necessarily, by inheritance. Where such chiefs possess religious authority, the extension of their secular power on this account over several tribes often produces temporary confederacies or groups of tribes for offence or defence. The blood feud is the dominant factor in tribal history, and it is the endless succession of quarrels, raids and petty wars caused by it, which engenders utter want of cohesion and resultant weakness in even a single tribe. Kurdish tribes are of three varieties—largely the outcome of geographical configuration—viz., nomadic, semi-nomadic and sedentary. The sedentary, as the name implies, dwell in the more fertile valleys, live in villages, and practice a rude agricul tural and pastoral farming. The semi-nomadic groups inhabit villages during the winter and tents in the neighbouring hills during the summer. They do little cultivating, but own large flocks of sheep and goats. The nomads dwell in tents all the year round, own large flocks of sheep, goats, horses and mules, but no land. They pass the winter in the plains, and migrate to their summer pastorage as the season becomes hotter. The mountain nomad is governed in his choice of routes by the configuration of the difficult country154 through which he must pass. He must also know his road and be well acquainted with the territory of his habitat, both in summer and winter, for the mountains are fraught'with difficulties and dangers. He travels taking as little baggage as possible, for he returns every year to the same winter quarters and leaves his heavy tents with settled relations or friends of the same tribe. For the summer he takes light tents ; sometimes only the chief may have a tent. In bad years the nomad is bound to lead his flocks farther afield and to substitute quantity for quality in the pastures. The herdsman trespasses on the agriculturist’s property. Wherever nomadism and agriculture exist side by side the struggle is a continual one, and the methods resorted to are not always peaceful. There is, however, a gradual evolution of a more settled state. This tendency is partly a natural occurrence and partly artificial, in that it is brought about or supported by Governments with the idea of acquiring a more direct adminis trative control over the people, and also of obtaining more intensive cultivation of the land. Migrations frequently carry in their train bloodshed and robbery, as the nomads plunder or are plundered by the sedentary tribes through whose territories they pass. 3. Relations of the Tribes. (a) Among themselves .—At the present time, in the part of Central Kurdistan administered by the Traq Government, tribes, with the exception of the nomadic “ kochers ” and to a somewhat lesser extent the Zibar, Barzan, Mizuri and Shirwan, have practi cally ceased to exist as such. Formerly they probably did exist as tribes, but nowadays internal differences, jealousies, and external interference have so rent them that in the case of the Sindi-Guli, Doski, Bawari tribes, etc., the tribal bond and collective instinct have quite disappeared. Another factor which has tended to break down the tribal characteristic is that most districts are now directly controlled, and there is no tribal authority or agent between them and the Government. The “ kocher ” or nomadic tribes are different. Being migrants they do not come so much under government control; and the very nature of their migatory existence demands that individuals combine to resist interference with their enormous flocks and to obtain the essential pasturages, which would be denied them if they were not strong enough to take what they wanted. These tribes are controlled through their chiefs or officially appointed agents, who are responsible for good behaviour and payment of revenue. It is only recently that the tribes east of Aqra have been brought under any form of direct control. The Zibar and “ Diawana ” confederation of tribes acknowledging Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan have existed in the past without interference by Government in the administration of their affairs.Across the frontier in Turkish territory, the position is similar, Turkish policy has always been to break down the tribal system among the settled population ; and the ruthless methods in the shape of executions and deportations of chiefs and religious dignitaries, which, either by choice or necessity, followed the Kurdish rebellions of 1925 and 1926, have largely succeeded in destroying whatever cohesion formerly existed in the tribal areas south and south-west of Lake Van. (b) Towards Government .—The attitude of the tribes towards Government is very largely determined by the following factors :— (i) The interests of the Aghawat’ or ruling families. (ii) Kurdish Nationalism. (hi) British Administrative Inspectors. (iv) External influences. (v) The religious Shaikhs. (i) The Interests of the Aghawat—The Aghawat, whose authority rests primarily on the possession of so many rifles, largely direct practical politics. The type of people who possess rifles, know how to handle them and are fondest of using them, belong to the bandit class, and as such become the personal attendants of the Aghawat, who, like feudal barons of the middle agesTtyrannise over the cultivator at will. Their wealth depends entirely on extortion from the villages and their influence on the fact that they spend the money thus acquired in maintaining the armed bands which enforce their authority. Such men cannot but view the advent of any form of settled government with concern. Whereas they formerly pocketed the taxes raised from their villagers, the money now goes into the coffers of the Govern ment. Police are taking over the protection of the cultivator, and from being a power in the land, the Agha finds himself dwindling into comparative insignificance. It follows then that wherever the power of the Aghawat continues, government has to reckon on passive resistance and even on organised rebellion. The small cultivator is undoubtedly glad to be rid of Aghawat protection; but for the Agha and his band of tough followers settled government spells dire disaster. In his heyday he under stood the application of force to further his own ends, and now in the days of his decline it is force alone which will keep him in order and obedient. He is for ever on the alert to take advantage of weakness to reassert himself. (ii) Kurdish Nationalism .—The end of the Great W ar piesented to the Kurds, in common with other minorities, the opportunity ■of giving some kind of expression to nationalist desires, which hitherto had hardly shown themselves in a concrete form. At that time and up to the present Kurdish leaders have displayed an amazing disregard of realities, and in most cases have been entirely nut of touch with the people. This state may be accounted for156 by the fact that all educated Kurds have been compelled by the absence of scholastic institutions in Kurdistan to obtain their education practically from infancy outside their own country. Thus, whilst possibly equipped with some of the attributes of a leader, they remain out ' of touch with native sentiment and conditions, and are generally unknown and unacceptable to an ignorant rank and file. Conversely, isolated leaders like Shaikh Said, who were in close contact with the people, lacked the know ledge and vision necessary to bring a nationalist movement to a successful conclusion. In this manner has Kurdish Nationalism blindly tottered along, lacking a practical policy and a real leader, hitting out when utterly exasperated, and temporarily coyved by the heavy blows which were sure to follow. Perhaps as a result of the Allied policy in Asia Minor imme diately after the Treaty of Sevres, the Kurds erroneously con sidered that Great Britain would materially support a nationalist movement. Thus for some years they waited in expectation of external help—words held the place of deeds. That state might have continued until to-day had not a strong nationalist Turkey arisen to reimpose an even closer administration over the Kurds of the Ottoman Empire. This increased control, with or without reason, was certainly irksome if not definitely oppressive ; in any case it made no concession to the legitimate aspirations of the Kurds. Another, and perhaps even more potent cause of the dissatisfaction which led to the subsequent upheaval, was the suppression of age-old Islamic institutions and the intro duction of measures just as revolutionary on the secular side. Touching, as these innovations did, the everyday life of the common people and represented, as they were, as fundamentally opposed to the tenets of their religion the fanaticism of the ignorant tribesmen was easily aroused and turned into nationalistic channels. The situation was probably still further aggravated by the harsh punishments which followed infringement of the new edicts. A series of sporadic and local revolts resulted, culminating in the Shaikh Said rebellion of 1925 and its afterniath of 1926. The insurrection was drastically quelled, the leading participants being either executed, imprisoned, or forced to flee the country for their lives. Kurdish Nationalism had hit out, got battered for its pains and painfully groped its way again. The present condition of the movement in the area under report can best be considered briefly under the headings of— {a) Turkish Central Kurdistan. [b) ’Iraqi Central Kurdistan. 7 urkish Central Kurdistan .—The repressive measures of the Government at Angora subsequent, to the 1925-26 revolt gave a definite set back to nationalism in Turkish Central Kurdistan. For two years no one dared lift his voice in support of the move ment. However, in May, 1928, the Turks proclaimed an amnesty to all Kurds with a few exceptions. At the same time an enlightenedKurd was appointed to govern Eastern Anatolia with his head quarters at Diabekr ; and a policy of conciliation appears to have been inaugurated. Many important Kurdish refugees have taken advantage 'of the government’s pardon, and have returned to their homes ; but it is too recent to judge the effect of their new treatment accurately. In the meantime an extreme Kurdish Nationalist society termed the “ Khoybun ” had been set up in Aleppo. This body, which has no illusions regarding Britain’s non-participation in the Kurdish movement, seems prepared to accept the assistance of any nation or organisation which will help them. Their activities, however, do not appear to have extended to Central Kurdistan, with the possible exception of the Jelali revolt in the Mount Ararat region, in which they are almost certainly concerned. Kurdish Nationalism in Turkish Central Kurdistan seems at the moment to be suffering from its set back, and is practically inactive though probably dormant. How long it is likely to remain inarticulate will depend largely on the successful appli cation, or otherwise, of the new policy which in 1928 was inaugurated by the Angora Government. ’Iraqi Central Kurdistan .—It may be stated at the outset that there is no national feeling for the new ’Iraq Sta.te on the part of the Kurds situated within its borders. This fact is perhaps more noticeable in Southern than Central Kurdistan, but is nevertheless applicable to both parts. Kurds of Iraqi Central Kurdistan have never made a serious attempt to attain their independence by force, that is to say that there has been nothing in the nature of a concerted effort towards this objective. The fact that ’Iraqi Kurds marie not the slightest move to help their own people in the 1925—26 rebellion has been the subject of much adverse comment amongst Kurdish Nationalists in general. Thatthey did not was probably due to the big difference between the treatment of Turkish and ’Iraqi Kurds. ^ Whether that surmise be correct or not, nationalist sentiments in ’Iraqi Central Kur distan are far less marked than anywhere else among Kurds, and will probably remain so unless definitely stirred into activity and assisted by external organisations. To sum up. Nationalism in Turkish Central Kurdistan was undoubtedly retarded by the repressive^ measures aftei the 1925-26 rebellion. The question whether it is likely actively to show itself in the near future must largely depend on the success of the present Turkish policy towards the Kurds. ^ In ’Iraqi Central Kurdistan nationalism exists in a mild form but has never vet been sufficiently virulent to be a menace to the existing Government. It is likely to remain m this state unless fanned into activity by external elements. (hi) British Administrative Inspectors .—During the investi gations of the Frontier Commission of the League of Nations, it was remarkable how many witnesses qualified their adherence158 to ’Iraq with a proviso that a European—preferably British— mandate was considered essential. If there were to be no mandate, they preferred in many cases to return to Turkish rule. The Christians and Yezidis considered this preferable, as a lesser evil, to an entirely independent Arab Government. Owing to their distrust of Arab Government the majority of the inhabitants, and especially the pooler classes, frequently look to see justice and right maintained by the British Adminis trative Inspectors. (iv) External Influences .—Throughout Central Kurdistan the external influences are actually small but potentially large. In Traq pro-Turkish propaganda flooded the area prior to the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne, but the settlement of the frontier question has reduced it to negligible dimensions. Its use in case of serious dispute arising between Turkey and Traq or Great Britain is to be expected as a normal weapon. It is also not impossible that the Kurds, were the special privileges withdrawn which they now enjoy in the matter of the appoint ment of Kurdish officials to their districts under the Traq administration, might turn, in irritation at what they would regard as alien control, to the Turks or Persians. At present there is little sign of Persian interest in any question of Kurdish Nationalism in Traq. Outside Central Kurdistan a long-standing frontier dispute between Persia and Turkey drags on and the resultant pin pricking from both sides encourages staunch allegiance to neither. So far there are practically no indications of Soviet interest in Central Kurdistan, although theirs is an external influence which requires to be carefully watched on account of its potentialities. fv) Religious Shaikhs .—There is a fifth, but, in Central Kurdistan, a factor of lesser importance, which has a bearing on the attitudes of tribes to Government. The hierarchy of religious Shaikhs have on occasions given their blessing to various rebellions, and have added to the difficulties of administration. The Turks have grappled with the problem by the wholesale execution or removal of prominent religious personalities, and the enforced closing of their “ tekkiyahs ” or houses of religious instruction. This drastic treatment has been effective and has reacted on the Shaikhs domiciled in Traq territory, who are the less likely to listen to Turkish propaganda in the future. They remain, however, a source of potential danger, and possess great influence over their semi-savage and ignorant adherents. 4. Arms and Ammuni tion. Any exact estimate of the number of rifles in possession of the tribes is out of the question. After the suppression of the Kurdish rebellions of 1925 and 1926 rifles were very cheap, andit was possible to purchase a good Turkish Mauser rifle for about Rs. 40. Many were sold to Traq tribesmen by the people impli cated in the risings across the frontier. Others are brought into Traq territory by the nomads, who are in a position to buy weapons, which escaped the confiscations, and to import them into Traq, where they find a ready sale. The Traq tribes are, therefore, well armed with modern weapons. Although the Turks claim to have disarmed their Kurds, the measure was only effective in the Bohtan areas around Sairt, Bitlis and Diarbekr ; and probably they were not successful in securing more than half the rifles actually in the possession of the tribes to the north of the Traq frontier. When rebellion starts, rifles have a nasty habit of appearing from nowhere ; and it is fairly certain that large numbers are concealed against the day when the Kurds can rise again. Every man who enlists in the Traq Levies, except a Kurd, is entitled to a free issue of a British rifle and 200 rounds of ammu nition on his discharge. Some 3,000 rifles have already been issued and there are roughly another 3,000 serving, who are also entitled. These men are Assyrians, the best fighting stock in the country. They are now trained soldiers with capable and efficient officers. To this total another 3,000 have to be added, which were issued to the Christian inhabitants (Assyrian) for their protection in the early days of our occupation. The following table is an attempt to calculate the numbers of rifles held by the tribes and other non-tribal elements in Central Kurdistan within Traq territory and on the frontiers. The sum total is likely to be an underestimate. Tribe. Modern. Number of Rifles. )dern. Obsolete. Artushi .. Artushi Hani Ashair Saba Barzan ..

Stocks are becoming exhausted, and fresh supplies are not so free owing to the restrictions on arms traffic. Ammunition for the Lee-Enfield (-303) is frequently converted to fit the Mauser by filing down the rim at the base of the cartridge. There are also a few French and Russian rifles to be found, but ammunition for these makes is exceedingly difficult to obtain. 5. Fighting Characteristics. The warfare of the Kurds of Central Kurdistan differs from that of Southern Kurdistan. In the latter country fighting is mostly carried on mounted, as the terrain is suited to mounted infantry tactics. In Central Kurdistan, where the mountains are more rugged and the valleys narrower, war is waged on foot. Tribal Procedure—Indications of Impending Revolt. —A warning that rebellion is contemplated may be recognised in the suspension of feuds and the arrangement of alliances between tribes and groups which, in ordinary circumstances, are hostile to each other. Such took place on the occasion of the Barzan-Zibar alliance, which secured combined action in their attack on Amadia in 1922. The leaders then decide on a scheme of operations, and appoint a day and place of assembly for their armed forces. Each con tingent proceeds to the rendezvous, every man armed and rationed for a period which may vary from 10 to 14^days. A^ feature of tribal warfare is the rapidity with which a lashkar or tri a force can concentrate at any given point. Duration of Hostilities.—h tribal force is unable to keep the field for any lengthy period. The rations carried with them being only sufficient for 14 days at the very most, after which supplies have to be sent for or levied from the surrounding villages As Central Kurdistan is a poor country, districts cannot support the needs of a large number of armed men After a severe engagement it is frequently found that a lashkar will disperse to replenish their stocks of ammunition. They disperse as quickly as they assemble, and proceed m small parties y different routes to lessen the risk of an effective pursuit. Tactics. —Despite the reputation of the Kurds for courage and dash, they have in no instance justified their claim to any mastery of or ability in, the art of mountain warfare. Compared to th hiilmen of the Indian frontiers the Kurds have shown themsdves an appreciably inferior enemy. They rarely, if ever, can be brought to undecisive action, but confine themselves to ^ lds on attacks on isolated posts and detachmen s, an sn i De villages which have refused to assist them. At nl ght ^y sn^e into camps, and generally worry troops in circumstances wh^ offer no opportunities of retaliation. When greatly superior (C 16145) Gnumbers they may pluck up enough courage to push home an attack ; but they are always loth to assault a fortified post or position. At the same time, although the Kurds are not an enterprising enemy, they must not be underrated. A scant value of their ability was the cause of failure at the Mazurka Gorge in the 1919 operations. Loot when taken in raids is distributed among the chiefs of the contingents, whether they were present or not, in order to implicate everyone equally in the hostile activity. In battle there is no organised system in their mode of fighting. Each man or perhaps group of four to six riflemen take up the position they consider best suited, firstly for protection for them selves and secondly to inflict loss on their enemies. The country is well adapted to such guerilla tactics. In cases where a direct or frontal attack on a position might prove a costly undertaking, it has been the experience that Kurds will abandon even a position of great natural strength if their line of retreat is menaced. Such an abandonment does not mean that they have given up the fight, because, if an advance is followed by a retirement, they will immediately follow up with increased morale in the belief that they are in chase of a beaten enemy. This is a constant feature of warfare in the Kurdish mountains ; and the tribesmen can be drawn into prepared traps by their too ready assumption that a retirement by troops is an admission of defeat. Protective Measures .—In operations against a tribal enemy the following precautions are essential :— {a) Touch must be maintained with detached parties and rear guards. (b) Perimeter camps should be adopted whenever possible, and heights in the neighbourhood occupied. (c) Movement should be along the high ground as far as possible. (d) A detachment should be strong enough to defend itself against any likely enemy and to carry out the purpose for which they are detached. (e) Lines of communication should be protected by posts at intervals along the route. (/) Small parties, if attacked, should take up a defensive position rather than retire. (g) Early and accurate information regarding the enemy is of the greatest importance. On the march protection is secured by the piqueting of heights or by flank guards. When operating in hostile country theformer method has been found most satisfactory. If flank guards are used they must move along the heights, as the Kurd is always to be found on the top of the mountains overlooking the line of march. There is no more effective way of dealing with Kurds than the adoption of their own methods of warfare. They have not much intelligence, and it is not difficult to prepare some kind of trap for them. In former operations Assyrian Levies have successfully rounded up snipers at night, and by means of some ruse induced the enemy to come out into the open. If a column has been sniped at night a favourite strategem is to leave some article of military equipment behind when camp is broken in the morning. A few selected riflemen are posted at a known range from the site of the camp as the column moves off. The Kurds, eager for loot, come down to the abandoned camp and give the watchers their opportunity. 6. Possible Centres of Disturbance. The Aqra-Zibar Area .—This area comprises the Qadhas of Aqra and Zibar, the latter of which has only recently been brought under direct Government control, loose though it may be. The tribes are undoubtedly truculent, and have given a great deal of trouble in the past. They are also a fertile field for hostile propagandist activity. It is very probable that certain elements would revolt if Government were embarrassed by any rising in another sphere ; and it yet remains to be seen what attitude will be adopted when the chiefs and leaders find themselves subjected to the discipline and shackles of a regular administration. This area differs from other districts in that one of the leading men in Central Kurdistan, Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan, is of the hierarchy of Shaikhs, and wields great religious and secular influence. The tribesmen of the Mazuri-Bala and the Shirwan look to the Shaikh of Barzan with the utmost religious awe, and obey his directions without question or regard to the outcome. During the past few years Shaikh Ubaidullah of the Surchi has seen himself reduced to impotency. Lands which he had usurped have been taken from him, and he is now, if not exactly a nonentity, of comparatively small importance. He would most likely join any insurgent movement in order to restore his fortunes ; and, owing to his religious influence, would carry elements of the Surchi with him. Faris Agha of Zibar has the worst reputation for having fomented rebellion. He maintains himself chiefly by extortion from his villages, and thus cannot be expected to view increased Government control kindly. He must therefore be regarded as potentially hostile, and prepared to take the field against the Government on the slightest provocation.164 The tribes which are in a position to rising in the Aqra area are as follows become involved in Tribe. Rifle Strength. Zibar .. .. 400 Surchi .. 700 Shirwan .. 300 Mazuri-Bala . . .. 300 Barzan 180 Nerva .. 250 Raikan .. 200 Ashair Saba . . .. 100 Oramar .. 200 Chal .. .. 250 Herki (Aqra section only) . . .. 300 Qadir Agha of Shush .. 100 Odd elements .. 225 Total .. 3,505 a It is most unlikely that all the tribes mentioned would rise together. Possibly on the issue of some great question, in which all the chiefs had identical interests, a general rising might take place ; but at present the interests of the different groups are opposed. For example, the Nerva-Raikan tribes, Qadir Agha of Shush, and elements from Oramar have assisted Government in the past against the Zibar-Barzan-Surchi group ; and, as the feuds still exist, the former group would be unlikely to support any rebellious movement of a limited character. Qadir Agha of Shush, formerly associated with the Zibar tribe, is staunchly pro-British. On the other hand Sutu Agha of Oramar must be included in the number of potentially hostile chiefs, as he would probably assist the Barzan group, on the grounds of his former relationships by marriage with Shaikh Ahmad. Even among the potentially hostile Barzan-Zibar-Surchi group there are feuds and disa gr eements, which mhijmise the danger of concerted action. For example, Faris Agha and Shaikh Ahmad are at feud owing to the former having assisted the Turks to capture his elder brother Shaikh Abdul Salaam. They have been able, however, to patch up their differences since, and would probably do so again if a serious revolt were contemplated. Within the Zibar tribe itself Faris Agha, the chief, is unfriendly to Babekr Agha, who is on good terms with Shaikh Ahmad. It would appear, therefore, that the tribes which may possibly give trouble in the Aqra area are the Zibar, the Mazuri-Bala and Shiiwan adherents of Shaikh Ahmad, and the immediate followers of Shaikh Ahmad himself. To these should be added elements of the Aqra and Dasht-i-Harir sections of the Surchi, who would rally to Shaikh Ubaidullab, and possibly some assistance from Sutu Agha of Oramar. A concentration of the armed forces of these tiibes would number about 1,200 rifles, which, however,could not be maintained in the field for more than five or six days. After the first week probably no more than 500 would still be mobilised, and as time went on this number would be further reduced. Despite their reputation for robbery and general lawlessness, the Herki have given no trouble in recent years and have not been drawn into rebellion. They are, however, very much under the influence of Saiyid Taha, who could probably sway them to his own attitude. The Zakho Area .—The Zakho neighbourhood has been under the direct control of Government for a number of years, and the influence of the tribal chiefs has been correspondingly reduced. On the Turkish side of the frontier the tribes have been disarmed to some extent, and many of their chiefs have been executed for the part they took in the Kurdish rebellion of 1926. Their power of offence at present is less than it has been for many years. The nomadic Artushi depend on good relations with Government for passage to and from their winter grazing grounds, and are influenced by the misfortunes of the settled sections who were implicated in the 1926 rebellion. The important Miran tribe took refuge inside ’Iraq territory in 1925. In 1928 they crossed into Syria, but are reported to have been making overtures to return to Turkey. As this may materialize, they are considered under the above heading for purposes of this report. The Miran are by no means law abiding, but have not given a great deal of trouble to the ’Iraq authorities. In the event of their doing so, however, in ’Iraq, punitive measures could be adopted against their flocks, etc., without much difficulty. The lawless faction of the Sindi, except the Muchuli, have now surrendered and paid fines of rifles. The Goyan tribe, living in close proximity to Zakho across the frontier, were very active in the 1926 rebellion, and were severely dealt with in consequence. Most of their rifles were confiscated. In the early days of our occupation this tribe was antagonistic, but later their attitude, with the exception of the irreconcilable Hasso Dino, underwent a change. The tribes capable of being involved in a revolt in the Zakho area are— Tribe. Rifle Strength. Goyan Sindi-Guli .. Sloopi Slivani (including other elements) Artushi nomads .. Miran Total In the event of any recrudescence of the trouble on the frontier with Turkey it is likely that the Goyan and Sloopi tribes would be encouraged to assist any rebellious elements within the Iraq 500 700 300 500 500 1,200 3,700166 borders. It is, however, by no means certain that they would do so, as they have definitely declined on previous occasions ; and the repressive measures of the Turkish troops must have alienated their sympathies still further. In considering Zakho as a centre of possible disturbance, the outbreak would only be general if the whole country were similarly affected. For the present, the only unrest which need be seriously envisaged is hostile activity by one or two of the tribal Aghas, who imagine they have a grievance. They might assemble 200-300 rifles, their activity probably taking the form of attacks on isolated police posts, raids on convoys and on villages which refused to join or supply them with provisions The Amadia-Dohuk Area .—In 1919 and 1922 this area was the scene of much unrest which led to armed revolt. The reason for the hostile attitude of the tribes in the earlier year was perhaps largely to be found in their fear of reprisals for their conduct towards the Christian inhabitants, who had fled the country during the War, and who were now returning to their homes. This fear was played upon by the Turks, who disseminated propaganda to the effect that the returning Christians were to be the future masters of the country. The tribes which took part in the revolts of 1919 were— T ribe. Barwari-Bala Bawari-Zir (elements) Goyan Guli Rifle Strength. 550 160 600 300 Total .. 1,610 In the 1922 disturbances the above tribes took no steps to join with the Barzan and Zibar people in their attack on Amadia. This was perhaps due to the punitive operations subsequent to the 1919 revolt and also because Haji Rasaid Beg, the dominant personality in Barwari-Bala, was hostile to Haji Abdul Latif, the disgruntled ex-Mudir of Amadia, who instigated the attack. In the case, however, of a revolt brought about by a strong union of the chiefs, the following tribes would possibly be involved :— T ribe. Barwari-Bala Barwari-Zir Guli Raikan Doski Amadia townsmen Artushi nomads .. Nerva Rifle Strength. 700 250 300 275 500 150 500 250 2,925 Total167 At the moment it is not easy to visualize any reason for a general revolt in this area. The country has been quiet since 1922, in which unrest the local tribes really took no part. In 1924, when the Turks advanced through the northern part of Barwari-Bala, the tribes, with some isolated exceptions, remained quiet. The return of the large Christian population, of whom there are about 7,000 persons in the Amadia district and about 6,500 in the Dohuk area, tends to stabilise the country. The Kurds and Christians live on very good terms, in some cases residing in mixed villages ; and the excesses of the Tiaris in the 1920 repatriation movement seem to have been forgotten. These ChristiarisTare industrious farmers, who are the least likely people to join in any rebellious movement. The Doski are not a fighting tribe, although they have a good reputation as such. The chief, Said Beg of Germawah (near Dohuk), has remained staunch when elements of his people became uncontrollable as a result of Turkish intrigue in 1925. The Mazuri tribe is peaceful and not used to war. They are easily controlled, the most influential person, Shaikh Nuri of Brifkan, being until recently a Member of Parliament. The Nerva and Raikan tribes have never been in arms against the Government. On the contrary they gave their assistance to Government forces in 1922 against Zibar and Barzan. The hostile elements in Amadia town caused much trouble between 1919 and 1922. Their leaders, Haji Shaban Agha and Haji Abdul Latif, following a period of voluntary exile, are both being kept—away from Amadia—under a bond to be of good behaviour. There remains Barwari-Bala, a tribe divided amongst them selves. The delimitation of the frontier has removed a former cause of anxiety, and Haji Rashid Beg is to all appearances settled and contented. His influence, however, is very much reduced in districts where he formerly wielded considerable power. To sum up, the whole area has every appearance of being settled and contented. Apart from possible reverberations fiom the Aqra-Zibar area, when a final settlement there takes place, there seems no reason why the Amadia district should not remain in its present satisfactory state. 7. Military Considerations. Hostile Action by Tribes.—A general rising of the tribes m Central Kurdistan under one supreme leader is unlikely, and need not be considered in any detail. It might, however, result from (i) The declaration of a religious war or “ Jihad.” (ii) Excessive Kurdish Nationalist sentiment. g 4 (C 16145)As regards (i), the Kurds have never yet shown sufficient religious fervour and fanaticism as to raise them to the pitch of united and concerted action, in which all enmities and jealousies among tribal chiefs are forgotten. Regarding (ii), in order to raise the Kurds on the score of national consciousness some supreme leader must be found to whom all the chiefs would rally. There is no pre-eminent princely house in Central Kurdistan, nor is there at present any outstanding individual who would command general allegiance. Moveover, although Kurdish Nationalism is by no means moribund, a universal rebellion would naturally presuppose an extreme discontent with existing conditions, which can hardly be said to be the case in 'Iraqi Kurdistan to-day, although, as indicated in a previous paragraph, general discontent would undoubtedly follow sudden withdrawal of the special administrative privileges which the Kurds in 'Iraq now enjoy. It will therefore be seen that the idea of a general rising, in which all the tribes would co-operate, is remote, and that it may thus be briefly dismissed. The most common form of rebellion is that in which several independent parties each operate in their own area. For example, a rebel concentration at Aqra would in most cases confine its activity to the valley of the Greater Zab. The majority of Kurds are territorial and dislike intensely fighting far from their homes. It is unlikely that any concentration would exceed 1,200 rifles. Resistance would depend on— (i) The popularity of the cause. (ii) The counter-activity of Government. (iii) The success with which tribes were played oft against each other. (i) Kurds seldom fight unless there is a sound promise of gain, and if such prospects are good, resistance will be more prolonged. (ii) Inaction, purely defensive measures, and hesitation are interpreted as weakness and induce waverers to join the rebels. They are as easily disconcerted by prompt and resolute action ; and an early defeat always has its influence on the amount of resistance to be expected in the future. (iii) Advantage should be taken of the causes which tend to prevent co-operation and unity of action. The absence of any recognised leader, the inter-tribal enmities and feuds and the faction feeling in the tribes themselves, if taken advantage of, will tend to break up a rebel concentration and diminish their power of resistance. Punitive Measures .—To obtain satisfactory results punitive measures must be drastic and calculated to create a lasting respect. Half measures are worse than useless, and only encourage the Kurds to reprisals. Punitive operations should be so planned and carried out that heavy losses in men, live stock and grain169 are inflicted in the shortest possible time ; rate of loss is the important factor. Destruction of hostile villages is a necessity- in cases where the inhabitants have supported their Aghas ; but in instances where this support has been withheld, destruction and confiscation of the property of the Agha will probably be sufficient. Wholesale destruction produces resentment and dis content among an otherwise well-disposed population. Obviously oppressive measures after punishment should be avoided, as they make the Aghas all the more ready and eager to rise again. It has been found in most cases that it is lowering to Govern ment prestige to employ tribal auxiliaries in co-operation with regular troops. Such help tends to reveal the weakness of the power which resorts to assistance of this nature. Marches .—Before the commencement of a punitive operation all details of the route to be followed must be known. The tracks through the mountains are difficult; and stages should, therefore, be short to permit full protective duties being under taken. This is all the more necessary when a scheme of operations involves the movements of two columns, operating from different bases and converging towards the same objective. A liberal time allowance for all march programmes must be made. Air Operations .—In contrast to the plains, it is highly desirable that air operations in the hills of Kurdistan should be combined with the action of ground troops. The difficulties of aircraft operating alone are mainly those of terrain. The rugged nature of the country, frequently covered with an abundance of small scrub trees, afford ample cover, and makes it extremely hard for aircraft to distinguish objectives. In the mountainous country of Central Kurdistan it is a matter of comparative ease to conceal fairly large concentrations and movements from the air. More over, targets themselves in the shape of flocks, etc., are generally smaller in the hill country than in the plains. Therefore, without the co-operation of ground forces, the chances of preventing a determined enemy from gaining his objectives are considerably reduced. Accordingly, in the past it has been found preferable to combine ground and air operations, both for offence and defence, in Central Kurdistan. Objectives .—In the unlikely event of a general rising as has been indicated above, the first phase of the operations would comprise the occupation of the chief towns and centre of supply, e.g., Zakho, Amadia, Aqra and Rowanduz. From these points military action could be taken against any concentration which disclosed itself and which would offer resistance. Destruction of villages and wholesale confiscation of live stock and crops would follow. Objectives in the case of risings of individual tribes are dealt with in the tribal lists.■171 TRIBAL LISTS.2 Confederation, Tribe or Section. Artush Hani .. Chiefs. Fatteh s/o Haji V. Shive.

Originally it was a large migratory confederation under a single chief, which traversed the country between Shattakh and the Tigris. The coherence and common policy of its component tribes made it more than a match for any of the tribes bordering its area. In 1898 a fierce dispute arose with the Doski, with whom a battle took place resulting in 100 killed on each side. For the next two years the southern Artushi tribes, who survive to-day as the only pure nomads, did not migrate to their winter habitat in the Doski country, but lived with the Miran. The results of this quarrel are still existent in the friendly relations of the Hajjan and the Miran and the coolness between the Artushi and the’Doski. The Turks, recognising the strength and cohesion of the confederation, raised the 56th Hamidieh Regiment from it. In 1919, however, on the death of Haji Agha, no successor strong enough to keep the tribe together was forthcoming, and disruption took place. The confederation was split up roughly into four divisions, which, being still existent, are taken as the basis of compilation in the present tribal list. (1) The followers of Ismail Agha Geravi are composed of (in the order of their appearance in the tribal list) :— A section of the Geravi. Gavdan. Pirosi. Mamkhoran. Oashuri. Zhirki. This group is known as “ Mandika.” (2) The followers of Abu Bekr Agha s/o Shakir Agha Geravi are :— A section of the Geravi. Alan. Esdinan. Khalilan. Hawishtah. Shaikhrah. Muhammad Piran. Kakan Bairkhoi. This group is known as “ Haji Mandan.” (3) Independent tribes under members of the old ruling family of Haji Agha are :— Sherifan. Shidan.179 ARTUSHI (4) Purely nomadic sections, who look upon Muhammad s/o Haji Agha of the Sherifan as their leader, are :— Hajjan. Gavdan. Artushi. Govan. Elkian. Mahmedan. Qulian. Zhirki. Geravi. Zaidan. Qashuri. Sherifan. Zaidek. Consequent upon the break-up in 1919, individual tribes acquired much more freedom of action, and are now responsible for the conduct of their own external relations. In 1920 cohesion was weakened further by a dispute between two surviving members of the family of Haji Agha, namely, Muhammad and Abdul Kerim of the nomad Sherifan. In this dispute Ismail Agha Geravi and Laskin Agha Geravi took opposite sides. The Artushi were not affected by the out-break of Shaikh Said’s rebehion in 1925 nor in the disturbances caused by Shaikh Abdullah in the Julamerk area later in the year. In 1926, however, the tribe rose in rebellion to resist the efforts of the Turks to collect arms and to enforce the edicts of Angora. Deh was captured and looted, and Julamerk felt into the hands of the Artushi, but was recaptured almost immediately afterwards. The rebel chiefs were compelled to flee into Iraq territory and took refuge near Amadia to escape the large forces which were drafted into the tribal area to quell the revolt. In July, on a promise of atnnesty, Laskin Agha, one of the former ruling chiefs and brother of Abu Bekr Agha, and a number of his followers returned to their homes, but were at once ai rested deported to Van, where they were put to death. Ismail Agha and his sons, however, remained in ’Iraq territory. Abu Bekr Agha, the brother of Laskin Agha, escaped and fled to Urumieh, where he remains a refugee. At the end of 1926 the Turks intimated their intention of refusing the nomad sections, who winter in Iraq, access to their summer grazing grounds in Farashin. They maintain that they cannot allow the passage of an unruly mob through the areas which have been settled. Although the Turks claim to have disarmed the Artushi it may be assumed that large numbers of rifles remain concealed. In the rebellion the tribe captured 600 rifles at Deh, and is said to have handed over only one-fourth of the arms m their180 possession. No rifles are to be seen ; but reliable informants state that most of them escaped confiscation and are hidden away. Owing to the inaccessible nature of the country the Turks were unable to deal with the Artushi as thoroughly as with the rebels in the Diarbekr and Bohtan areas. The strength and cohesion of the confederation have much diminished as a result of internal dissensions and the measures taken to break down the tribal system. The Artushi have suffered with the other rebel tribes of Central Kurdistan, and, although cowed and submissive to Turkish rule, are probably resentful and would not require a great deal of persuasion to rise again if a suitable opportunity ever presented itself.

Ancient History .—The Nestorian Christians of Central Kurdistan are the remnants of the great Nestorian Church known as the Church of the East, which was found throughout Asia in the Middle Ages. The Patriarch Nestorious was accused of teaching that the Virgin had given birth to Jesus the Man, but not to Jesus as God. The Patriarch of this Church and his adherents were well received by the Sassanids and later by the Abbasids. The decline of the Khalifatefthe Mongol invasion and the recrudescence of Moslem fanaticism modified the situation. In the thirteenth century the Nestorians were being persecuted, and were withdrawing to the mountains. Their period of greatest trouble was during the second Mongol invasion under Tamerlane, which left them as reduced in numbers as they are to-day. In the sixteenth century attempts were made to draw the Nestorians into the Catholic fold. Their separation into two groups rendered this more feasible. The northern group had maintained them selves under the jurisdiction of a separate Patriarch known as Mar Shimun. The lowland group of Nestorians, who had seceded under the Patriarch of Babylon, felt to a great extent the need of protection, and in 1788 they became united with Rome. This was the beginning of the Chaldean Church. Modern History .—Before the war of 1914-18 the Assyrians inhabited the country north of Amadia to Norduz and east to Lake Urumieh, Salmas and Solduz. The population was estimated at from 80,000 to 100,000, which was divided into the following main divisions :— Independent Tribes. (1) Tiari. (a) Upper Tiari. —The Upper Tiari inhabited the Greater Zab valley from Lizan to Tal, near Julamerk. {b) Lower Tiari .—The Lower Tiari resided in the valley of Salabeqan, and the valley of Lizan, due west from the Zab to the town of Ashita. (2) Tkhuma.—The Tkhuma inhabited the country between Salabeqan and Tal. (3) Baz.' —The Baz lay between Tkhuma and Jilu. (4) Jilu .—The Jilu occupied an almost inaccessible mountain between Baz and the Plain of Gawar. (5) Diz. —The valley of Diz runs south from the river Zab to the mountain of Jilu.197 ASSYRIANS h 3 (C 16145) Ryat or Subject Tribes under local Kurdish Aghas. (1) Nauchiyah. —Who were under Saiyid Taha of Neri and the Begzadehs of Tergawar. (2) Gawar. —Under Tamar Beg, Muhammad Beg and Tahir Agha of Gawar. (3) Barwari-Bala. —Under Haji Rashid Beg.

(6) Mar B’ishu (Deirnai). —Living near Gawar in the Diza Qadha, an offshoot from the Tiari. In 1915 the Russian troops advancing towards Julamerk got into touch with the Assyrians, and induced them to attack the Turks. Shortly afterwards the Russians retired, and the position of the Assyrians became untenable. They were forced to with draw with their families into Persian territory, where they continued to assist the Russians. After the break-up of the Russian armies in 1917 the position of the Assyrians became increasingly difficult, and they were obliged to flee to the sanctuary of British occupied territory. About 50,000 persons arrived at Hamadan, from where they were sent to a concentration camp at Baqubah, some 30 miles north-east of Baghdad. In 1920 an attempt was made to repatriate the Assyrians, who had in the meanwhile been assembled at another camp at Mindan on the Khazir river. The scheme adopted was one put forward by Agha Petros, who considered that—by arming about eight thousand of the men—it would be possible to push through to Neri, Diza and Ushnu, and, after establishing garrisons there, to bring forward the women and children and occupy their former territories. The scheme failed owing to the utter inability of Agha Petros to control the mountaineers as they were passing through the territories of friendly Kurdish tribes. The Tiari commenced looting and burning, and eventually broke away from the repatriation movement altogether, which left the main body of refugees unsupported, and necessitated their return to Mindan and Aqra. A colony of several thousand families was settled in the Dohuk area. These had not taken part in Agha Petros’ scheme, and soon became self-supporting. In February, 1921, another plan was devised. On this occasion the idea was to settle the mountaineers tribe by tribe with a reasonable interval between each move, and relying on our control of the Kurdish Aghas through whose territory they would pass. The tribe or section nearest to Amadia was to move first, and the sections further away were to pass through it until their homes were reached.198 At that time there was considerable uncertainty regarding the ultimate location of the northern border, and all the Assyrians were unanimous in there determination to remain within the British sphere. The frontier as described by the Treaty of Sevres left the Nestorian country to the Turks, and actually gave the latter Amadia. The Assyrians clamoured for an assurance. It was expected that the frontier would be revised, and the whole of the pre-war Mosul Vilayet plus the former Assyrian Ashiret country would pass to our control. On this expectation the second repatriation was carried out. The Assyrians were despatched from the camp at Mindan at the rate of 1,000 at intervals of one week. By July, 1921, some 7,500 persons had been settled in the Bawari-Bala, Zakho and Lower Tiari districts and near Amadia and Dohuk. The remaining sections, i.e., the Tiari, Tkhuma, Baz and Jilu, left Mindan in July, and the Tiari arrived at Dohuk during the month. The last proceeded into the mountains, and reached their own country a month later. The Baz, Tkhuma and some of the Jilu appeared later at Dohuk, and it was discovered that they had formed another plan for their return. They proposed to pass the winter in Barwari-Bala, subsisting on the food and grain gathered by the Moslem inhabitants for themselves. As nothing but disorder would have resulted, the three sections were ordered to disperse. The Baz to join the Baz settlement in the villages round Zakho, the Tkhuma and a few Jilu to settlements in the Dohuk neigh bourhood and at Deralok, east of Amadia.. The remainder of the Jilu had not movecTTrom the Mosul plain. Meanwhile the Upper Tiari, who had been settled in the Aqra district at the end of 1920, became restless and were allowed to move across to Dohuk in September, 1921, too late to return to their own country. They were, however, temporarily settled in the neighbourhood. The following was a rough distribution of the Assyrians in the autumn of 1921 :— Settled and repatriated north of Amadia.. 6,950 persons. Settled in Amadia district .. . . . . 1,100 Settled in Dohuk, Zakho and Aqra districts 7,450 In effecting these settlements and repatriations the Kurdish Aghas and tribesmen behaved with remarkable restraint. A complete amnesty for the past was ordered, to which the Kurds certainly lived up. They showed themselves very willing to resume friendly relations with the Assyrians, and even paid over half the crops they had sown on the lands of the Christians who were repatriated. The repatriation of the Assyrians was continued in the spring of 1922, when the whole of the Upper and Lower Tiari proceeded to the mountains. The Ikhuma joined them and returned to their former habitations in the villages east of the Zab.rendering Turkish efforts to stir up the frontier tribes £utile. The Turks realised this, and, when attempts to raise the Moslem Kurds against them failed, they endeavoured to ingratiate themselves with the Nestorian Patriarch and the Maliks, who were invited to Julamerk to meet Euz Demir, the Turkish Commandant at Rowanduz. Towards the end of 1922 a party of Assyrians drove the Barzan and Zibar rebels out of Amadia, and took the larger share in the subsequent punitive operations. A brigade of Assyrian Levies was also formed at the end of 1922 with its headquarters at Mosul. This brigade did much to restore Government prestige in Kurdistan during 1923. The year 1924 was one of great calamity and disaster for the repatriated Nestorians. In August an affray took place between a party*of Tkhuma tribesmen and the Turkish Wali of Julamerk, who was on a revenue collecting tour. In retaliation the Turks entered territory which was being administered by 'Iraq with very large forces towards the end of September, and compelled the total evacuation of the districts north of Amadia, to which the Nestorians had been repatriated in 1922. Tiari, Tkhuma, Baz and Jilu tribesmen all came pouring back to Amadia with their families before the advance of the Turks, who destroyed all the villages and crops in the Nestorian areas. They were utterly destitute and in great fear of the Turks. As a temporary measure as many families as possible were domiciled in the Shaikhan, Barwari-Bala and Dohuk districts. A few families spread east wards to the Desht-i-Harir and around Batas. The pro-Turkish Malik Khoshaba, a fugitive from 'Iraq, remained in occupation of the lands he held before the war ; but the great majority continued to live as refugees in Mosul and scattered over the towns of 'Iraq. The question of Assyrian re-settlement has proved to be a difficult one. They hold out for sufficient land which will enable the clans and sections to be together, realising that if separated and scattered among the Kurdish communities they must be weakened. Their circumstances, a Christian people in a Moslem country, demand a cohesion which will enable each section to render mutual support. With this end in view a start was made in July, 1927, with what is hoped will be the final settlement of the Assyrians, the money devoted to this purpose being the balance of a sum subscribed in response to an appeal put forward by Sir Henry Lunn. The first to be dealt with were the members of the Nauclnya section under the leadership of the Metropolitan Mar Yqsip, who formerly had his headquarters near Neri, in the Shamsdinan country. This section, composed of refugees from Shamsdinan, Tergawar and Mergawar, who were settled in 1921 in villages in the Shnel pl ain near Dohuk with a colony in Baghdad, were transferred to villages in the Arbil Liwa. The area selected for this section was the Desht-i-Harir and Diana plain near Rowanduz, where up to August, 1928, approximately 361 families H 4 (C 16145)200 have been settled. Through the good offices of the American Near East Relief Committee a central dispensary has been opened in the area, and the settlement bids fair to be entirely successful. A further 315 families of the Tiari-Tkhuma and neighbouring tribes have been settled in the Mosul Liwa, mainly on Government lands ; while of the old settlements some 390 families in Aqra and Doduk area—formerly from Mar Bishu, Jilu and Gawar— may be considered permanent. The Assyrians have more affinities with the Kurd than with the Arab, whom they both despised Several thousand of their men have received a military training under British officers in the Levies, and each discharged soldier has been given a Lee^Enfield rifle with 200 rounds of ammunition. Were British control entirely removed from Traq it is not impossible to conceive of an alliance between the Kurds and the Assyrians to free themselves from an Arab government. It is true that so far there has been no real move towards any form of unity in this direction. The employment, however, of Assyrian cultivators on the lands of Kurdish Aghas is increasing, and it is only a question of time before the latter will realise the very considerable military value of the Assyrian tribesmen. Whether Kurdish Nationalists will be able, or inclined, to combine with the Assyrians in a common cause is at present little more than a matter for speculation. What is more definite is the presumption that, if the prospects which Traq can offer to the Assyrians are not sufficiently attractive, they will turn to other nations which they think are in a position to tender better ones. Already a large section has shown a decided wish to return to Turkey, but the Turks have with equal emphasis refused to have them. As stated previously the settlement of the Assyrians is a problem of extreme complexity ; but they are an industrious and extremely martial people, who should be a distinct acquisition to a mandated Traq.203 ASSYRIANS — 5 6 7 Armed Men.

After the murder of the Assistant Political Officer, Zakho, in April, 1919, Turkish intrigue and anti-Government and anti- Christian tendencies gained immensely in effect, A convoy on the Dokuh-Amadia road was raided, and some of the military escort were killed. As a counter-measure, Haji Rashid Beg was appointed Government Chief of Barwar-i-Bala in order to prevent the disaffection spreading into other districts. The raids, however, continued, and the situation around Amadia rapidly deteriorated! culminating in the murder of the Assistant Political Officer and the Officer Commanding Gendarmerie there by Haji Shaban Agha s party. As a result of these acts a punitive column was then based on Amadia, and the country of the Barwar-i-Bala laid waste. The ringleaders, however, were not caught, and after three months operations British administration was withdrawn from Barwar-i-Bala, Musa Beg being appointed Government Chief vice Haji Rashid Beg, who had led the rebels against us at the Mazurka Gorge engagement and elsewhere. Shaikh Baha-ud- Din, who, while not conniving at the murders, had not used his influence to stop the movement, was removed from Bamurni, and deported to Baghdad. Haji Abdul Latif, whose part'nTthe rising was not clear, was ordered to live in Mosul. In December, 1919, the withdrawal of the troops from the Amadia valley again took place, and Haji Abdul Latif was brought back and installed in Amadia as Government Mudir to keep out Haji Shaban Agha and his party. In April, 1920, Haji Rashid Beg, who had been living in Chal and Julamerk since he had been driven out of Barwar-i-Bala, made unconditional surrender to the Assistant Political Officer! Owing to his favourable conduct after his flight he was appointed Mudir of Barwar-i-Bala in August, 1920. This meant the dis placement of Musa Beg, who had acted in a very satisfactory manner. Rashid Beg’s influence was so strong, however, that there was no other alternative. Owing to Rashid’s hostility to Haji Abdul Latif, Barwar-i-Bala was separated from Amadia for administrative purposes. In the disturbances connected with the repatriation of the Assyrians in 1920, Haji Rashid Beg and the chiefs of Barwar-i- Bala showed remarkable restraint, although they had great cause of complaint, as much damage was done by the Assyrian mountaineers, who became out of hand. The Barwar-i-Bala were not implicated in the attack on Amadia in 1922. On the contrary Haji Rashid Beg brought down a force of his tribesmen to the assistance of the Qaimmaqam, for which he received the “ Nahda ” from King Faisal. In 1924, when the Turks invaded ’Iraq territory, Haji Rashid Beg did not report himself at Amadia when ordered to do so, and207 BARWAR-i-BALA was stated to have interviewed Muslat Pasha, the Turkish commander in that area, and to have accompanied him to Mai. On the withdrawal of the Turks to the limits fixed by the “ Brussels Line,” he returned to Dershish and was brought in to Amadia. He explained his failure to report himself on the grounds that he was afraid to come in to Amadia owing to the fact that the Turkish forces were in his tribal area and would have laid waste his lands. He was permitted to return to Amadia, and has since been of good behaviour. The tribe gives no trouble and pays taxes regularly.211 BARWAR-i-BALA 5 6 7 Armed Men. Rifles. Horse. Foot. Total. Modern.

In 1909 the Turks sent an expedition against the then ruling Shaikh, but very moderate success was achieved. Nazirn Pasha, who was placed in supreme charge of the vilayets of BairaH7Baghdad and Mosul in 1910, patched up a peace, but when he fell in 1911 all settlement crumble'd ; and at the outbreak of the Great War the Shaikh of Barzan, Shaikh Abdul Salim, was contemplating being forced, in self-defence, to accept the overtures which the Russians had frequently made to him. In 1914 the Wali, Sulaiman Nadhif Pasha, sent another expedition against him, and by making use of Paris Agha of Zibar, who was at feud with Barzan, pursued him into the Mazuri-Bala mountains, where he was captured and later hanged in Mosul. His successor inherited his feuds, but not his wits. When British administration was established at Aqra shortly after the armistice, the attempt to hold the balance between Barzan and Zibar antagonised both parties, and gave a promising field for Turkish propaganda, which was skillfully conducted by Haidar Beg, an ex-Governor of Van. Through Turkish mediation the quarrel between the two was temporarily adjusted. The Political Officer of the Mosul Division and the Assistant Political Officer, Aqra, visited Aqra at the end of October, 1919, and imposed a fine on Paris Agha and a second Zibari chief, Babekr Agha, whose followers had sniped our gendarmerie. On the 1st November the two Zibaris, enraged at being called to order and fined, communicated with Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan, who sent his brother and 20 men to their assistance. These and the Zibaris ambushed the officers near Bira Kapra and shot them. The Barzanis and the Zibaris attacked and looted Aqra, but quarrelled over the division of the spoil. The Barzanis then returned home. On the arrival of a punitive column in the Zab valley most of the villagers flew white flags and appeared to be in genuine fear of their Aghas and to welcome protection against them. The houses of the hostile chiefs were burned, but the villagers were not molested. Shaikh Ahmad and his brother escaped into the mountains and were outlawed. On the conclusion of operations it was decided to draw in the administrative frontier to Aqra. The outlaw Shaikhs returned to Barzan, and in 1920 unsuccessfully attempted to oppose the Assyrians when they were crossing the Greater Zab during their repatriation movement. The Assyrians burned Barzan in retaliation. The arrival and continued presence of a Turkish force at Rowanduz in 1921 was the cause of much unrest and disaffection in the Amadia and Aqra areas. The Turkish commander was215 BARZAN successful in inciting the Barzan and Zibar tribes to attack the former town in October, 1922. The attack was beaten off, and in the subsequent punitive operations Shaikh Ahmad’s house and several villages of the Mazuri-Bala tribe were burned. The recent history of the tribe is mainly the same as that of the Shaikh, and the details are contained in the paragraph under his name in Chapter X (Personalities). Shaikh Ahmad has complete control over the Mazuri-Bala and Shirwan tribes in addition to the Barzan, his own immediate followers. This group, acknowledging him as their chief, is known as “ Diwana,” and the sworn liege men of the Shaikh are called “ Mind.” Both they and the rest of the Diwana affect red spangled turbans, and so great is their awe of the Shaikh of Barzan~that the religious devotees are~m the habit of turning towards Barzan when performing their devotions. Although the Diwana are said to possess about 800 modern rifles, they probably could not raise a lashkar for fighting outside their own tribal district of more than half that number. They all have a reputation for bravery and ferocity. The tribes are sedentary, but move to the mountain tops in the summer months. Tobacco, grajges and small mountain grains are cultivated, and flocks of sheep and goats reared. The tribesmen are entirely ignorant and savage, and one of the Mazuri-Bala villages, Teli, is the mythical Bedlam of Kurdistan. Any particularly stupid Kurd is accused of coming from this village.216 Confederation, Tribe or Section. 2 3 Chiefs. Habitat. Barzan Shaikh Ahmad V. Barzan. (ID Rowanduz, sq.Al.)

Neither is there any grouping or confederation of tribes. Previous to the Kurdish rebellion of 1925 the district was very peaceful and was not touched by outside politics. In the past all the tribes, including the Shovan and Garsan, w'ere united under Yacoub Ajgha. In 1913, however, Osman Agha of Tanzi broke away from the Jelian, to which he belonged, and, with the assistance of his retainers, made a bid for independence. He was successful in winning over the Shovan tribe. His efforts were directed against the Eiru, with whose chief, Yacoub Agha, he fought continuously from 1913. Owing to the action of the Shovan, a section of the Garsan were also compelled to assist Osman Agha. After six years of fighting Yacoub Agha was obliged to resign in the spring of 1919, and a certain Dodish Agha was appointed in his place, this Dodish being a nominee of Osman Agha. Old alliances were broken up, and unrest pre vailed in the area. In 1924, however, the Jelian again brought the Tanzi into subjection, and Osman Agha was killed. Yacoub Agha had meanwhile returned and regained his position. In 1926 the Bohtan tribes suffered very heavily for the share they took in the Kurdish rebellion of that year. Practically a clean sweep was made of every person of importance, man}^ of them being executed at Diarbekr and others being deported and imprisoned in distant parts of Anatolia. A few, including Yacoub Agha, succeeded in escaping to Traq territory, and are now settled in villages along the line of foothills north of Mosul. The larger part of the Qadha is agricultural; cereals and grapes being chiefly grown. There are relatively few sheep and cattle. No supplies, except fuel and grazing, can be reckoned on. Military action can be taken against the tribes from Jazirat- ibn-Omar and from Sairt. The country is very inaccessible, but can be approached from the river road, which runs between Jazirat-ibn-Omar and Til. From the latter place a passable track goes to Deh, which can also be reached from Sairt by a similar means. These tracks are only fit for pack transport.223 BOHTAN Armed Men. Rifles. Horse. Foot.

Before the war the Aghas of Chal were on good terms with their neighbours, the Assyrians. When war broke out, however, and the Russian armies advanced towards Julamerk the Assyrians joined them and laid waste the country of Chal, destroying villages and crops wholesale. During the first Assyrian repatriation movement in 1920, the Tiari, having broken away from the movement, again attacked Chal, held the Aghas to ransom and destroyed more villages. The Assyrians were not opposed in the following year, but the people of Chal had not forgotten their excesses of the previous year. The Assyrians are confident that it was at the instigation of Walia Beg that the Turkish Wali of Julamerk, Bekir Lutfi Bey, made his tour into their country in 1924, when he was attacked by the tribesmen of Tkhuma. The Agha of Chal got his revenge when the Turks commenced their punitive operations and drove the Assyrians from the country with the loss of all their possessions. The Aghas of Chal are all on very good terms with the Turkish Government. Chal itself is the headquarters of a Turkish Mudir and there is also a small military garrison in the district.230 1 2 3 4 Confederation, Tribe or Section. Chiefs. Habitat. Families, Tents or Houses.

The Doski were very quiet during the first few years of the British occupation, and gave no trouble until they became dis affected as a result of Turkish propaganda during the visit of the Frontier Commission in March, 1925. The paramount chief, Said Agha of Garmawa, remained staunch, however, and a split occurred in the tribe between him and Shafiq Agha of Zewa, who went off to Jazirat-ibn-Omar to obtain the rifles promised by the Turks. He returned empty handed. Safar Agha, Shafiq and Rashid Aghas were ordered to report themselves at Dohuk and failed to do so. Active measures being taken against them, Shafiq and his brother Taufiq surrendered unconditionally on the 20th May, 1925. They were imprisoned .at Dohuk. Safar Agha had, however, in the meantime been murdered. Rashid Agha failed to submit and his village, Hojawa, was destroyed in consequence. After a short term of imprisonment Shafiq Agha and Taufiq were released. They at once crossed the frontier and resumed their intercourse with the Turks, making overtures to Jamil Agha, the rebel chief of the Sindi. Hostilities were recommenced by two raids on villages south-east of Zakho. Their efforts were mainly directed against the loyal chief, Said Agha. Rashid Agha and the other renegrade Doski chiefs remained in Goyan country, and were permitted by the Turks to harvest the crops of the Christian village of Merga, whose inhabitants had fled to Zakho. The rebels were responsible for further disturbances in the Dohuk area in August. They endeavoured to intimidate the loyal villagers into returning with them to Turkish territory ; but a body of police and friendly tribesmen forced them to with draw across the frontier, from which safe refuge they made half hearted overtures coupled with extravagant demands and conditions for their return to their homes. In February, 1926, they carried out an abortive raid on the frontier between Zakho and Faishkhabur. Later in the year the rebels accepted conditions of surrender and returned to their villages. With the exception of Said Agha there is nobody in the tribe of any influence. The others are reduced in power and influence, and are little more than mukhtars of villages.DOSKI 5 6 7 Armed Men.

In 1922 he assisted the Qaimmaqam of Amadia with a tribal following against the Zibar and Barzan tribes men, and resisted the overtures of the Turks in 1925.

The Doski-Bala appear to have originated from the Doski of the Dohuk district. There is now, however, little intercourse between them. The Doski-Bala, with Sutu Agha of Oramar, whom they recognise as their paramount chief, assisted the Turks to suppress the Kurdish rebellion in 1926, Sadiq Agha, son of Sutu, taking a force of about 300 rifles, including a contingent from the Doski- Bala, to Neri where the unrest was most rife. At the end of the rebellion the tribal chiefs were not deported as other individuals were, but many rifles were confiscated by the Government. The carrying of arms is now prohibited, and it cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty what number of rifles, concealed or otherwise, are still in the possession of the tribe. Possibly they may have about 200 modern weapons which have escaped the general confiscation. The tribe is stated to be well under control, and to have a very healthy respect for the Turkish Government. They come under the administration of the Diza-Gawar Qadha of the Hakkiari Vilayet. i-239 DOSKI-BALA 5 6 7 Armed MW. Rifles. Notes. Horse. Foot. Total. Modern.

They are of some importance owing to the fact that they inhabit the region about the Zin-i-Bardi pass (1C, sq. B4), which is the regular entry for pack transport into Traq from between Oramar and the Persian frontier. The great majority of the Girdi formerly lived in Turkey ; but, owing to their being implicated in the rising led by Saiyid Abdullah in the summer of 1926, the chief men were compelled to take refuge inside Traq territory. The chief Begzadehs, of which there are two families, Mql-i- Salim Beg and MaTi-Ahya Beg, were in 1927 refugees in the Baradost villages, but some of them have since returned to Turkey. This tribe of Girdi do not appear to have any connection with the Girdi Kurds, who live near Arbil.243 GIRDI 5 6 7 Armed Men. Rifles. Horse. Foot. Total. Modern. Old but Service able.

In the first few years of the British occupation of Central Kurdistan the Goyan, a settled tribe occupying a naturally strong habitat in the^Goyan valley 30 miles north of Zakho, ^ere consistently hostile. In April, 1919, the village of Karoar, of which Hasso Dino is the head-man, was responsible^for the murder of Captain Pearson, the Assistant Political Officer, Zakho. In the Amadia rising (July-August, 1919) the Goyan took a prominent part in the hostilities, and it was found necessary to despatch a force to inculcate into them respect for law and order. The tribe mustered some GOO rifles to oppose our advance, and engaged in several actions with resultant defeat. Karoar, the chief centre of disaffection, was destroyed and our forced withdrew without - being molested. Eventually several chiefs came into Zakho. In December, 1919, all, with the exception of Hasso Dino, signified their willingness to submit to British authority ; but so lotIg~ as he remained obdjw^te no real beneficial result could be expected. His attitude was one of complete defiance, and he so harried the Christian villages, which adjoin his Territory, throughout' 1921, that their existence was rendered almost impossible. The hostile attitude of the Turks, who gave the Goyan arms and ammunition, made it impracticable to punish the raiders or check the outrages. In 1922 the Goyan were of rather better behaviour, and did not send raiding parties into ’Iraq territory • but they offered a haven of refuge for outlaws and malcontents of the Dohuk, Zakho and Amadia districts. In 1923 a Turkish detachment was sent to Goyan country to collect revenues and to establish military posts. The tribesmen refused to mate any payments, and resisted the imposition of the posts. In retaliation the Turks set up a blockade of the Goyan, which caused considerable hardship. In 1924 the Turks endeavoured to effect a reconciliation with the tribe, and requested their assistance in the operations directed against the Assyrians. The Goyan, however, refused to comply with the Turkish'wishes, except in the case of Hasso Dino, who proceeded to Sairt prior to the commencement of the punitive measures. The Goyan were not affected by the outbreak of the Kurdish rebellion of 1925 in its earlier stages. In Jfune, however, the Turks commenced a general collection of rifles on the frontier, and showed such brutality that many of the tribesmen of the Goyan fled into ’Iraq territory. Towards the end of the year, all the Christian sei fs living amongst the Goyan were forcibly removed from the'Trontier districts. Many reached Zakho in an utterly destitute condition having lost all their flocks and grains, which had been commandeered by the Turkish troops.245 GOYAN The collection of rifles continued in 1926, and, angered bv this and the loss of their Christian serfs, the Goyan rose in rebellion and laid siege to the Turkish posts in their neighbourhood. They were supported by the adjacent tribes, and soon a large portion of the northern frontier was in active revolt. The Turkish garrison of Karoar was obliged to evacuate the post in that village, and abandoned everything to the rebels, who had meanwhile sent their families into ’Iraq territory for safety. The rebellion was not of long duration, as the Turks took energetic measures to suppress it. By the end of May it was over, and heavy fines were levied on the villages implicated. In July seme 4,000 individuals from the Goyan were allowed to return to their homes in Turkish territory, and were not molested beyond the collection of arms and ammunition from the leaders. In March, 1927, the Turks arrested Osman Qatto and three other chiefs of the Goyan, who had returned'Irom their voluntary exile in ’Iraq. While on their way to Shernakh under escort they are reported to have been murdered. TTasso Dino has not been molested.247 GOYAN 5 6 7 Armed Men. Rifles. Horse. Foot. Total. Modern.

Internal Cohesion. —The Goyan are an independent and democratic tribe, who have no paramount chief. Each village has its own head-man. They hold together well, however, in time of stress, and show a united front to any invaders. Hasso Dino of Karoar is the most influential. External Relations. —The Goyan are enemies of the Sindi and of the Sherifan, Qashuri and Zhirki nomads. The Goyan belong to the Haji Baira confederation of tribes, which includes the Shernakh and the Sloopi. They are influenced largely from Shernakh. Political Attitude. —Were consistently hostile to the British in the early days of the occupation, but asked to be included in ’Iraq on the visit of the Frontier Commission in 1925. Hasso Dinno is irreconcilably anti-British. Resisted Turkish efforts to control them in 1923, and rose in rebellion in 1926 when Turks commenced dis armament of the frontier tribes. Hasso Dino was not implicated. Osman s/o Qatto Agha is pro-British and was arrested in spring, 1927, and deported to Sairt. The tribe is now completely cowed by the Turks. They have ideas of Kurdish independence, free of any dominating government, and resent interference. Fighting Characteristics. —Possess a fair aptitude for hill warfare. Punitive Measures. —The Goyan live in difficult country, but their villages are accessible by pack from Zakho and J azirat-ibn-Omar.248 THE HERKI. The Herki is one of the richest and best armed tribes which winter in 'Iraq. English travellers before the War generally described them as a set of robbers and thieves ; but their behaviour since the occupation does not justify this description. They consist chiefly of the Agha class, the peasant or Kurmanj element being outnumbered by those related to the Aghas, who are said to be descended from one Babekr of the village of Herki, east of Oramar. There is no paramount chief of the sections, which winter near Arbil. A chief is appointed periodically to act as Govern ment, mediator. Tahir Agha, Ahmad Khan and Khurshid Agha have in turn officiated in recent years. Tahir Agha is on bad terms with Saiyid Taha, who generally tries to make things difficult for him. The latter has a great influence in the tribe, as the selection of a chief is usually referred to him. The Herki Migration : The Aqra Division .—The Mandan section and some of the Serati winter near Aqra. Their route to the summer pastures goes through Zibar to Tang-i-Torai, where they cross the Greater Zab at Rezan. At Baidarun they divide. Some traverse the Dasht-i-Birasgird and cross the frontier at the bridge of the Haji Beg river ; passing the Zinu Bar they either proceed north-west to their camps in Turkish territory or follow the Khumara valley through Sirunis into Persia. Others proceed east to Lailkan, and then either follow the Birasgird in ’Iraq territory and spread out where the three frontiers* meet, or join the road of the Arbil Serati. The Arbil Division .—Most of the Serati winter in the neigh bourhood of Dera. The route to their summer quarters goes through Babachichek, the Rowanduz gorge, Diana, Sar Barda, Sidaka, Geli Laitan, Lolan and Khanaira. Crossing the Persian frontier and the Gardar river, they sjpfead out near Ushnu without having touched Turkish territory. Recent History .—Apart from being rather reluctant to register their rifles the nomadic Herki have been well behaved, and have given little trouble. In 1925, however, the tribe was implicated in the activities of Saiyid Abdullah after the suppression of the Kurdish rebellion of that year. Considerable numbers of riflemen assisted the rebels ; and on the 25th June, 1925, the Herki, with a contingent from the Girdi tribesmen, under the direction of Saiyid Abdullah, attacked the Turkish garrisons of Neri and Nushehr, and compelled the surrender of their arms and ammunition. In retaliation the lurks took strong measures and suppressed the revolt. The Herki were severely dealt with, ten of their chief men being summarily executed. In 1926 the tribe took no part in the abortive revolt in the Julamerk area.251 HERKI 5 6 A rmed Men. Rifles. Horse. Foot. Total.

Haji Millo of Beida is the only minor Agha who shows any independent spirit. External Relations. —On good terms with the neighbouring tribes, and with the Artushi nomads. The Mazuri are a peaceful tribe, and keep clear of inter tribal complications. Political Attitude. —Since the occupation by the British the Mazuri have been quiet, and have had no hand in the troubles which have taken place in Central Kurdistan. In 1925, Mirza Agha, the chief of the settled Sherifan section, was murdered by Abdullah-i- Abrahim Agha (Benani Shemkan section), who then fled to Turkish territory. He is outlawed, but re turns occasionally to commit highway robbery in the district. He has ten followers. Fighting Ability. —Poor. Punitive Measures. —Villages accessible from Dohuk and to aircraft.256 MAZURI-BALA. The Mazuri-Bala now belong to the group of tribes known as “ Diwana ” and controlled by Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan. They look upon the ruling Shaikh of Barzan with the greatest religious awe and superstition, and obey his commands without question. The men of the tribe, the liege-men of the Shaikh, are known as “ Mirid.” Many of the Mazuri-Bala villages were destroyed during the Assyrian repatriation movement of 1920 when they, with the followers of Shaikh Ahmad, endeavoured to oppose the return of the Assyrians to their former homes. In summer they leave their villages and go to the higher altitudes in the mountains. The Mazuri-Bala took part in the attack on the town of Amadia in 1922. During the punitive operations many of their villages were destroyed by the Raikan, who took the field against them. Later in the year, they endeavoured to revenge themselves only to meet with further defeat. -Teh, one of the Mazuri-Bala villages, is the mythical Bedlam of Kurdistan, and any extra stupid Kurd is alleged to come from it.259 MAZURI-BALA 5 6 7 Armed M en.

In the days of Sultan Abdul Hamid the Miran Confederation under the leadership of Mustafa Pasha, a powerful personality, was notorious for its looting propensities and general lawlessness. Mustafa Pasha received the title 6f Pasha as a reward for pro viding two regiments of cavalry under the Hamidieh system. Naif Beg s/o Mustafa Pasha, the present chief of the Con federation, is a sensible politician, who, prior to the movement of the main sections of the tribe into ’Iraq territory, was a despot after the style of his father. Prior to 1926, when the Miran were obliged to take refuge in ’Iraq, the tribe was wholly nomadic, and, beginning their migration northwards at the end of May, spent the whole of the month of June on the journey. They passed through Jazirat- ibn-Omar and then on to their summer grazing grounds in the “ Zozan ” between Shattakh and Mukus via Shernakh and the Artushi country. Some sections suniiTiered south of Khaskheir. From 40-60 days were spent in the hills, and in the beginning of September the southward move to the plains south of Jazirat- ibn-Omar commenced. There was generally friction with the Shernakh on these moves as Abdul Rahman Agha endeavoured to levy toll. With the Artushi, however, friendly relations existed. The Musarash, Kichan and Tayan sections are known as “ Shilidiyah,” i.e., not of Miran stock: but owning allegiance to the chief of the Miran. These sections are now practically independent. {Note .—Shilidiyah sections are marked with an asterisk in the tribal list.) In 1915 the Miran were responsible for the massacre of nearly 900 Christians at Faishkhabur. They claim that they were forced to do it by the Turks. On our occupation of the country, Naif Beg feared reprisals for this deed, and his attitude was coloured accordingly. On being reassured he was distinctly friendly, and would probably have welcomed the extension of our administrative area as far as Jazirat-ibn-Omar. The Turks raised a force of 300 horse from Miran in 1925, and gave Naif Beg the rank of Bimbashi or Major in this so-called Hamidieh contingent. He also gave 1,200 gold liras to the Turkish aeroplane fund. Naif, however, had no confidence in the attitude of the Turks towards him ; .and, on the outbreak of the 1926 rebellion, asked permission to take his tribe permanently into ’Iraq territory. This was granted on certain conditions/which were accepted. The Miran are a very wealthy tribe, and are practically self-supporting. In winter the sections are roughly to be found scattered in an area enclosed by the Wadi Suwaidiyah on the north, the Tigris as far as Eski Mosul on the east, the Wadi Shaur on the south, and a line from the Tel Es-Shaur to the WadTSuwaidiyah on the west. In summer all sections are located on the Wadi Suwaidiyah.261 MIRAN Since their arrival in 'Iraq a number of the section leaders have expressed considerable dissatisfaction with the autocratic manner in which Naif Beg rules the tribe. They objected to his exactions, and finally withheld their customary contributions to him.^His position since then has steadily deteriorated till now (1928) when he appears to have little influence of any kind. Moreover he formerly owned a large number of shops in Jazirat- ibn-Omar, but these were confiscated on his leaving Turkish territory, and he has since lost much in tribal spoliation. The Miran are well armed. Their rifles anTall of modern pattern of the Matter type. At present (January, 1929) the Miran appear to be in state of flux and disentegration. During 1928 their division became accentuated, and they were mixed up in the chaotic inter-tribal raiding^which has been taking place in the Syrian ' Bee du canard.” Some of the sections are now in Syria, some in 'Iraq and others are talking of returning to Turkey. The future status and location of the tribe are, therefore, problematical. For the purpose of showing the component parts of the Miran, however, the sections and their locations shown in the following list are those which normally prevail in 'Iraq, (C 18145)263 MEAN 5 6 7 Armed M sn.

In winter each section has its own area, and is scattered where pastures are available. In summer the tribes feed their flocks on common pasturages on the Wadi Suwaidiyah. Internal Cohesion. —Prior to the move- ment into ’Iraq, Naif Beg ruled the tribe despotically, and was able to keep it well in hand. Since arrival in 'Iraq several sectional chiefs have 400 400 350 become discontented, and the tribe is rapidly disintegrating. The sections living in Turkey-Tayan, Kichan, Suran, Garusi Garsan, Aliqan and 230 230 150 Dedera have now little intercourse with the main tribe, and are practically independent. Notwithstanding the — 40 40 — — the internal split it is probable that section leaders would co-operate in — 160 160 120 — the event of external aggression. External Relations. —The Miran made 110 110 100 enemies of most of the tribes through whose territories they passed in their migration from Jazirah to the hills around Shattakh and Mukus. The 60 60 45 Shernakh have held them up to secure payment of debts. On bad terms with Ad Derwish, Ibnaiyan al Shallal and Ahmad al Gharbi of the Shammar over the question of “ kuwah.” Friendly with the Girgiriyah.

Haji Abdul Azziz — 400 400 200 — (Hassanan) is married to Naif’s sister. Political Attitude. —The Miran being a wealthy tribe are not given to law- — 45 45 30 — lessness. Although there has been difficulty about the collection of 265 265 100 revenue, Naif Beg may endeavour to resume friendly relations with the Turks to recover his large properties in Jazirat-ibn-Omar, which were con- 160 160 fiscated. Rashid ibn Muhammad of the Tayan is in prison at Diarbekr. The sections in Turkey have a whole- — 105 105 — — some respect for Government. Punitive Measures. —Ihe flocks and stock of the Miran are very vulnerable in their pastures. Fighting Ability. —The Miran are good I fighters, and are strong enough to hold their own against any other tribe 1 in their neighbourhood. (C16145) k 4267 NERVA 5 6 7 Ai rmed M en. Rifles. Horse.

After the murder of the two Political Officers at Zibar (Bira Kapra) in 1919, Sutu Agha gave refuge to the outlaw Paris Agha of Zibar, and brought a body of Oramar tribesmen to oppose the Government forces. Being defeated they fled to Simko in Persia. Sutu, however, later returned to Oramar, and was appointed Mudir under the Turkish administration. In 1922 Nau roz A gha, a rival of Sutu for the leadership in Oramar, abandoned him, and, crossing the frontier, assisted Government troops in the punitive operations against the Amadia rebels. On the outbreak of the Kurdish rebellion in 1925, Sutu sent his son Sadiq Agha with a tribal force of 150 men to Neri to assist the Turkish troops then engaged in operations against Saiyid Abdullah, the son of the late Saiyid Abdul Qadir. Nauroz Agha meanwhile returned to Oramar, and was deported to the interior by the Turks on account of his sojourn in 'Iraq. Despite their having assisted the Turkish Government, Sutu Agha and his son Sadiq were both removed from Oramar and deported to the interior of Anatolia. Subsequently, Nauroz Agha was permitted to return in the winter of 1925, whilst Sutu Agha with his son arrived back in Oramar in March, 1926. Rebellion again breaking out on the frontier in 1926, Sutu and his sons, followed by Nauroz Agha and some 200 families, fled to Nervek in Traq territory, about 40 families settling there. Several robberies, however, were committed by the Oramar fugitives which led to formal complaints by the Turkish Govern ment. Sutu Agha visited Mosul at the end of 1926 for eye treat ment, and was ordered to account for the actions of his followers. He undertook to bring in the offenders ; but, failing to do so, was arrested together with Nauroz Agha. Subsequently, Sutu Agha was released on security, and finally, in 1928, he and his relations were permitted to return to their homes. Oramar suffered much at the hands of the Russians during the War ; from being a town of some 500 houses it was reduced to a village of some 250 houses. The tribesmen were partially disarmed by the Erzerum Mobile Gendarmerie Regiment on the conclusion of the 1926 rebellion.271 ORAMAR 5 6 7 Armed Men. Rifles. Horse. Foot. Total.

The tribe suffered during the Russian invasion in the war. Many people died when compelled to flee south wards. This tribe is also known as upper Pinianash to distinguish it from Chal or Lower Pinianash.274 THE RAIKAN. The Raikan tribe suffered greatly during the War, when the Russians laid waste their lands. They had their revenge when, with other tribes of the neighbourhood, they trapped a detach ment of Cossacks in the Gglli Belinda, who perished to a man. Persistent efforts have been Tnade for many years by Sutu Agha of Oramar to dominate the tribe ; many of their chiefs being killed by him. Prior to the War Tatto Agha and Tammo Agha were both murdered at his instigation ; and during the unrest at Aqra in 1919 Sutu took advantage of the disturbances to capture Wahab Agha, under the guise of friendship, and cut his throat. The Raikan took a prominent part in the punitive measures subsequent to the attack on Amadia in 1922 by the Barzan and Zibar tribesmen. They turned out loyally to the assistance of the Qaimmaqam, and afterwards attacked the Mazuri-Bala, destroying several of their villages and carrying off much of their stock. ''''Although inhabiting a wild and remote district, the Raikan are amenable to control and pay their taxes without demur. Punitive measures would present the greatest difficulty as the tribe is covered against an advance from the west by the Greater Zab, whilst the nature of their country forms a large obstacle to any move from the south or Rowanduz direction.277 RAIKAN 5 6 Armed Men.

The Shemakh, once the largest and most powerful tribe in the area enclosed by the Tigris, the Bohtan Su and the Khabur river, have now been reduced to comparative impotence by the measuies undertaken by the Turks to break up the tribal svstem after the rebellions of 1925 and 1926. Much of the strength of the Shernakh was attributable to the coherence of the members of their ruling house, which was a Y e i^ ne d by internal feuds. The paramount chief was Abdul Rahman Agha, a strong virile personality who made his influence felt far afield amongst the Kurdish tribes. He was ably supported by Ali Khan Agha, his cousin, who is decidedly pro-Butish. The only malcontent member was Sulaiman Agha who was a self-seeker and dissatisfied with his position. During the Goyan disturbances in 1919 he did his best to involve the Shernakh against the British, but was foiled by Abdul Rahman In 1919, early in the year, Abdul Rahman Agha was the author of a circular letter inciting the tribes against the British. Afterwards, however, his anti-British sentiments underwent a change, possibly owing to the influence of Ali Khan Agha and possibly because he saw that our administration was not hostile to the Kurds ; for the Shernakh Aghas have always been deeply interested in the questions of Kurdish independence. In 1923, when the Turks were making great military pre parations on the Jazirah front and the probability pointed to an attack on Iraq, Abdul Rahman Agha was arrested, and deported lest his known pro-Kurdish tendencies should be a menace to their lines of communication. In 1925 he escaped and returned to Shernakh. The tribe did not rise during the rebellions of that and the following year but on its supression all the tribal Aghas with one or two exception^ were arrested and deported to Sairt. Ali Khan Agha escaped to Zakho, where he remained a refugee till 1928. Sulaiman Agha and Hap ^ usuf were permitted to remain in Shernakh as they had adopted an openly pro-Turkish attitude. All rifles were confiscated, about 700 modern weapons being collected. The centre of the tribe is Shernakh town, which contains about half the tribal population. It was a Qadha under the lurks, but was reduced to a Nahiyah in the Qadha of Deh only to be again revived as a separate Qadha in the new Vilavet of Sairt.279 SHERNAKH The Shernakh are the leaders of the group of tribes known as “ Haji Baira/’ which includes the Goyan and the„ Sloopi. The Hajjan section of the Artushi migrate through Shernakh, with whom they are on good terms. The tribe is now cowed by the drastic methods of the Turks, by the removal of their Aghas, the collections of rifles and the rigorous application of the new laws and edicts from Angora. They are sullen and resentful, but powerless.281 SHERNAKH 5 6 7 An ned Me a. Rif es. Notes. Horse. Foot. Total. Modern. Old but Service able. 2,700 2,700 100 Sedentary, agricultural and pastoral.

Many of the chiefs were arrested after the Kurdish rebellion, and some, in cluding Abdul Rahman, are beheved to have been killed. Others, like Ali Khan, took refuge in ’Iraq, but were permitted to return to their homes in 1928. Sulaiman Agha is hostile to the others, as he has adopted a pro-Turkish attitude. External Relations. —The Shernakh are the leaders of the Haji Baira con federation, which includes the Goyan and the Sloopi. On friendly terms generally with Hasso Dino of the Goyan, but dislikes him. Not on good terms with some of the Bohtan tribes. Political Attitude. —The Shernakh have always been deeply interested in the question of Kurdish independence, and the Turks were frequently obliged to undertake expeditions against them. Owing to the deportations and dis armament following the Kurdish rebellion, tribal attitude is probably submissive, but resentful. Punitive Measures. —The best line of approach is from Jazirat-ibn-Omar. Fighting Ability. —Reputed to be the best fighting tribe in the area.283 SHIKAK 5 6 Armed Men. Rifles. 7 Horse. Foot. Total.

Internal Cohesion. —Cohesion has suf fered within the last few years owing to the rivalry between Simko and Umar Khan. The Persian Govern ment has encouraged the latter to act as a counterpoise to Simko, whose attitude is always rebellious. Simko was in 1928 a refugee in Turkey, being located at Bajirga, north-east of Diza, near the Persian frontier, with a small following of some 100 men. Umar Khan is recognised as chief by the Persian Government, but he is not strong enough to command the allegiance of the whole tribe. The smaller chiefs fear Simko, and keep on good terms with him pending his return to the tribe. External Relations. —Simko is related to Saiyid Taha, on whose land in ’Iraq he was living in 1926-27. Friendly to the Herki of the Mawana area. Keeps in touch with Babekr Agha of the Pizhder. The tribe is the bane of the non-tribal and Christian inhabi tants of the Salmas plain and Oilman. Political Attitude. —Simko, a notorious brigand, prior to his flight, controlled the tribal policy towards the Persian and Turkish Governments. He was always in more or less open rebellion against the former, while keeping on reasonable terms with the latter. A violent pro-Kurd, both Turks and Persians undertook operations against him in 1926, and he was forced to flee to ’Iraq, where he remained for two years before proceeding to Turkey. The tribe is now quiet. Simko pro tests that he is pro-British, but his real attitude is probably confined to being pro-Simko. Punitive Measures. —Would necessitate the occupation of Dilman, Salmas and Urumieh. Fighting Ability. —The tribe has a reputation for quick raiding. The Abdoui and Hanari are the best fighters, the other sections not being of much account.284 THE SHIRWAN. The Shirwan villages did not suffer during the War as severely as their neighbours, and the present day population may be reckoned at 80 per cent, of the pre-war figure. The tribe was formerly controlled by Ahmad Agha, who was very useful to Government, but he died in 1921. Korta.s^Agha was murdered by Mulla Musa in 1922, and Said Agha by the Assyrians during the repatriation movement of 1920? Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan now directs the tribal policy, and the Shirwan chiefs are completely under his influence. The Shirwan villages number some 29, all in the loop formed by the Greater Zab and the Rukuchuk river. Their names are : Mergasur, Goratu, Jazhuk, Sarokani, Karuk, Baidarun, Rezan, Kekla, Piran, Beresia, Shirwana Mazan, Kani Lenja, Serkiri, Marran, Kaulan, Girkal, Mala Suwar, Lira, Bedodi, Galok, Berderi, Mazna, Wazi, Mamisk, Khaira Zooka, Mamola, Laira Mir, Kani Bott, Behi (ID, sqs. A1 and Bl). The mountainous nature of the Shirwan district makes punitive measures extremely difficult. The tribal habitat is, however, accessible to pack transport from Rowanduz.287 SfflRWAN 5 6 Armed Men. Rifles. 7 Horse. Foot. Total. Modern Old but Service able. 570 570 300 90 250 250 100 40 Notes.

The Sindi-Guli is a combination of two tribes, which are ostensibly united under one chief, but which in actual fact differ in origin and outlook. They are a rough turbulent lot, who have displayed little desire for British administration, or in fact for any form of Government which threatened the power of their “ Aghawat.” In 1919 the Guli were consistently hostile, and assisted the Goyan in their rebellious activities ; while the Sindi, although not actively concerned in the Amadia rising, were certainly in sympathy with the rebels. During the earlier part of 1920 the Guli were to all intents and purposes in open rebellion, encouraged in their attitude by propaganda and intrigues from Jazirat-ibn-Omar. In April, however, their chiefs came in with the exception of Sadiq Beru, the most influential anti-British section leader, and swore allegiance, recognising Sulaiman Kitto, who was officially appointed chief in Sadiq’s absence. In July the latter reported himself and made submission, after which the tribe came more or less under control. In 1922 and 1923 the Guli gave unrestricted passage through their territories to outlaws of the Goyan, Zhirki and Qashuri tribes, some of whom utilised the village of Bahnunah as a base of operations. The Guli were perhaps unable to contend with the presence of the Goyan raiding parties, as they are much weaker ; but they certainly could have prevented the Zhirki and Qashuri, who are on bad terms with the Goyan, from making free use of their territories. Sadiq Beru was accordingly arrested and brought into Mosul at the end of 1923. The Sindi had meanwhile been of good behaviour. They are hostile to the Goyan, who are on good terms with the Guli. The Sindi, however, became disaffected during the visit of the Mosul Boundary Commission in the spring of 1925, and rose in revolt. Jamil Agha with a number of followers attacked a small body of police between Sheranis and Marsis on the 4th May, and inflicted eight casualties including six killed. He then wrote accusing the Goyan of the outrage. Marsis and Barzingara were consequently subjected to aerial attack, and Jamil Agha’s house was searched, incriminating documents being discovered. Air action was resumed and Patrumah, Kelok, Barzingara and Marsis, all villages directly under Jamil Apia, were bombed. Jamil Agha then fled to Turkish territory, and the other Sindi leaders reported to Government authority. In a letter Jamil Agha stated that he was willing to meet the Qaimmaqam of Zakho if given safe conduct; but subsequently received a communication from the Turks reminding him of his oath to reject Traq, and promising him arms and ammunition.289 SINDI-GULI In July, 1925, the rebels resumed their raiding activities, receiving active encouragement from the Turks. Mulla Janis of Sheranis-Islam, for years the evil genius of the SilTdtTjuIC was arrested for complicity in Jamil Agha’s actions. Further raids took place from the Turkish side of the frontier during the autumn of 1925. In May, 1926, a party from the Muchuli section fired on an ’Iraq Army patrol, wounding one man. Following protests to the Turkish Government against the carrying out of raids from their territory, the Sindi ceased hostilities ; and towards the end of the year offered to restore all loot if their submission would be accepted. Having paid fines and received security for his future good behaviour, the submission of Jamil Agha and his followers was accepted. The rebel leader and those who had taken part in the hostilities were subsequently disarmed. It has been the custom to regard the Sindi and the Guli as one tribe. This custom is the cause of much annoyance to the latter, because, though certainly under the influence of Abdi Agha of the Sindi for many years, some ten years ago they shook themselves free from his influence and, as things are now, regard the Sindi as one of their enemies The Guli are self-supporting in all their food requirements, the produce of their sheep and the sale of surplus tobacco enabling them to obtain such things as tea, coffee, xtoth and sugar, which cannot be produced locally. They are able to float their wood down to Zakho, and so undersell the Sindi wood which has to be taken overland. Their main crops are wheat and barley in the winter, but the amount of winter cultivation is small. The chief crops of the year are the summer ones, e.g., rice, tobacco and maize. These are grown in the valleys, which have a good water supply. Among the Sindi are some big Christian villages, the most important being Birsivi, Sheranis Nasarah, Sinat and Alanish. The Sindi live in very small villages of only four or five houses, the villages being divided from each other by high mountains crossed by difficult paths. They are, therefore, unable to mobilise their fighting men quickly to repel raiders from the Goyan. The Sindi country is well-watered, but the cultivation is not good among the Muhammedans. The Christians are better and work harder. Their valleys are narrower than those of the Guli, and cultivation is consequently more circumscribed. Tobacco and rice are grown, and around the Christian villages fruit in large quantities. Owing to their proximity to Zakho, marketing is easy. In winter their sheep are taken to the Slivani plain.

The Sindi live in very small villages, divided from one another by high mountains. The sections were once united under Hamid Khalifa, but he now has no influence outside his own section. Jamil Agha of the Pasagha section was nominally paramount, and carried elements of the Muchuli and Mala A jam with him when he rebelled in 1925. Some of the Benistani also went over to the Turks at the same time. There is now no paramount chief. External Relations. —At enmity with the Goyan, who frequently raided Sindi country. On bad terms with the Guli, whom they look upon as vassals. On good terms with the Slivani and the Sloopi. A break with the Slivani would involve them with the Sloopi. Relations with the Shernakh doubtful. 4 Political Attitude. —The Sindi have a bad reputation for deceit and un reliability. Very open to Turkish propaganda from Jazirat-ibn-Omar. Were induced to rebel in 1925, and went over to the Turks. Quiet for the past two years. Fighting Ability. —Reputed fair. Punitive Measures. —Depend on Zakho for their markets, to cut them off from which would involve serious losses. In winter their sheep migrate to the Slivani and Sindi plains, where they can be seized.293 SINDI-GULI Armed Men. Rifles. Horse. Foot. Total. Modern.

Recent History, 1919.—At the time of the occupation of Aqra by the Zibaris at the end of 1919 the Surchi participated to some extent in the looting which followed. Punitive measures against the tribe were considered ; but, as they remained quiet and did not interfere with our lines of communication, it was decided to leave them alone. 1920.'—The intrigue of the Zibaris, however, proved too powerful for the Surchi leaders. In January, 1920, Paris Agha of Zibar came with an armed following to Bajil, the village of Shaikh Ubaidullah, and was so evidently trying to bring about an attack on Aqra that it was decided to bomb Bajil. The Zibaris withdrew, and, although Shaikh Ubaidullah appeared anxious to come in, he failed to report himself. A state of veiled hostility prevailed in February and March, during which time the Turks were busy with propaganda. In April, 1920, a military convoy was ambushed on its way to Aqra, and a few days later the town itself was attacked. A most spirited defence was put up, the rebels being forced to retire. A subsequent punitive column destroyed the strongholds of the insurgents, chiefs of whom fled to the hills. The next four months were uneventful, except for a number of raids by Surchi and Zibar tribesmen in the Aqra neighbourhood. In September, 1920, most of the Aqra Surchi joined the Desht-i-Harir sections in the rising, which resulted in the evacua tion of Rowanduz and Batas. The despatch of columns from Mosul and Kirkuk forced the Surchi to recross the Zab into the Aqra district, where they proceeded to attack the Assyrian camp at Jujar. Being beaten off, they were again driven across the Zab with considerable losses. At the end of 1920 three Surchi chiefs came into Mosul, and accepted terms of surrender. During 1921 the Aqra Surchi, contrary to the sections in the Arbil Liwa, remained quiet. In September of that year Shaikh Ubaidullah visited Arbil, but took fright, rejected the terms of submission, and returned to outlawry. At the end of 1921, the Desht-i-Harir sections became so out of hand that punitive measures had to be undertaken by ground troops and aircraft. These were continued into the following year. 1922.—During 1922 the Surchi succumbed to the intrigues of the Turks, and the whole tribe became almost completely out of control. A police patrol was ambushed near Aqra, one con stable being killed and two wounded. At the time of the attack on Amadia in 1922 the Surchi also gave cause for the greatest anxiety, because Euz Demir was urging the tribal leaders to over throw the administration in Aqra. The chiefs, however, were unwilling to move against a strongly defended town without military support, and the Turkish Commander’s schemes came to nought.301 suitcm 1923.—In March, 1923, Saiyid Taha was sent to Aqra to try and counteract the efforts of the Shaikh of Barzan and the rebel Surchi leaders. At his invitation Shaikhs Raqib and Qayun of the Surchi visited him at Aqra, accompanied by Ahmad of Barzan and a large number of followers. This visit was con sidered as indicative of the surrender of the two Surchi Shaikhs, who were doubtless impressed by the preparations for the re occupation of Rowanduz. After the withdrawal of the Turks from the Rowanduz area Shaikh Ubaidullah was allowed to make submission upon payment of a fine of 70 rifles. He was detained at Aqra until the autumn when he was released on condition that he would not cross the Zab, a condition which he immediately broke. He was, however, brought back and put on security. 1924-28.—Since then Shaikh Ubaidullah and his brothers have been well conducted. Their power for evil has been very much reduced and their influence over the Surchi, although still powerful, has tended to diminish with the advent of more settled conditions. Should Shaikh Ubaidullah see any opportunity of re-establishing himself in the event of any future disturbances, it is very probable that he would ally himself with those in revolt, although it is unlikely that he could carry the whole tribe with him. The Surchi are an ignorant semi-nomadic tribe of sheep and cattle breeders consisting of two main territorial divisions, viz. : Aqra and Desht-i-Harir. The latter is sometimes referred to in the more general term of Arbil Surchi. They are completely under the influence of the various Shaikhs of Bajil, to whom they behave with a craven and superstitious awe. The Shaikhs of Bajil. Shaikh Ubaidullah.—Lives at Bajil (ID, Rowanduz, sq. A2) and has six sons. He owns villages inhabited by the Mamgird and Sinan sections. Shaikh Badi’. —Lives at Dobe (ID, Rowanduz, sq. A2). He also has six sons and owns five villages, the inhabitants of which are of the Mamsal, Mamsid, and Khasri sections. Shaikh Qaiyun.—Oi Kelati (ID, Rowanduz, sq. A2) and has five sons. He possesses nine villages, occupied by the Mamsaki and Mamgird sections. Shaikh Raqib. —Lives at Sardarian (J38/T, Mosul, sq. D2). Has one son, and owns three villages inhabited by the Mamsid section. Shaikh Weji, Shaikh Shaqik.—Uve at Kelane (ID, Rowanduz, sq. A2), and own four villages occupied by the Mamgird and Mamsal sections302 The Aqra Division .—In the Aqra district 34 Surchi villages are &lt;owned by Shaikh Ubaidullah and his brothers. Of the remainder 78 are occupied by Surchi, known as Atraf-i-Shahr, some of which belong to the villagers while others are owned by the Government or by Waqaf. Another 14 belong to Qadir Agha of Shush, who originates from the Zibar tribe. He is unfriendly to the Shaikhs of Bajil and to Fads Agha of the Zibari tribe. The Dasht-i-Harir Division .—The sections living east of the Zab are also under the influence of Shaikh Ubaidullah and his brothers. The Malabbas section own 10 villages, the Mamassan 7, the Serchia 9, the Yusuf Kaski 10 and the Biau and Qulu 5 each. All sections, except the Biau and Qulu, were in arms against the British in the operations to recover Rowanduz in 1923. The Sarchi Migration .—The nomadic portions of the Surchi yacate their winter pastures in the Aqra district in May and return in November. After leaving Rowanduz they have two routes to their summer quarters. {a) Same as the Arbil Herki, i.e., via Diana-Sidaka-Sinin (ID, Rowanduz, sq. C2 and sq. Dl) thence over the Kalashin Pass to the Persian slopes of the frontier ranges. (b) Via Diana-Gewr-i-Majal-Hornai and the Meri Kin Pass (ID, Rowanduz, sq. Dl) into Persia, and to the Persian slopes of Kalashin from this direction. The nomadic sections are led by Majid Agha-i-Baba Shaikh, Papir Agha and Mirga Ag;ha, sons of the old Surchi Aghawat, who ruled prior to the domination of the Shaikhs of Bajil. Some times Shaikh Badi' accompanies the migration, and is acknow ledged paramount chief of the nomads on these occasions. The tendency is for the Surchi to become more settled.

External Relations. —Bitter enemies of the Herki. The Mahal-i-Biau is said to be influenced by Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan. Political Attitude.—The Atraf-i-Hanr and Serchia sections, influenced by Shaikh Ubaidullah and Shaikh Raqib, took part in the 1920 disturbances around Rowanduz and Batas. In 1921 the Atraf-i-Harir section was quiet, but the Serchia was openly hostile. In the event of any other rising in which Shaikh Ubaidullah was concerned they would be likely to join him. At present they are well behaved. Punitive Measures. —The tribe can best be punished by air or ground acUon against their villages, which are accessible from Arbil. Fighting A bility. —Fair. Are well armed, but not of a warhke disposition.308 THE YEZTOIS. This “ peculiar people,” as described by Layard, are popularly supposed to be worshippers of the Devil, whom they call Malik Taus, the Peacock King. They are probably dualists of the old Persian belief who have grafted on to their religion fragments culled from Christianity, Islam, Gnosticism and the varied religions of the East. The Yezidis are found in Jabal Sinjar and in the Shaikhan district north-east of Mosul. Their great shrine is at Shaikh Adi, to which pilgrimage is made in the summer. Their religious and temporal head, the Mir, resides at Ba’idhra, while the High Priest lives at Ain Sifni, which with Bashaikhah is their most important centre after Shaikh Adi. They possess seven golden peacocks—one of which was lost in South Russia at the beginning of the War—which are yearly sent out to the various Yezidi centres for the purpose of collecting offerings for the Mir and the priests. Their hierarchy consists of (1) the Mir, (2) the Pirs, spiritual dignitaries of great sanctity, (4) the Qawwals, attendants of the sacred peacock images, (5) the Faqirs dressed always in black, apparently a kind of lay brother. Yezidis are said to be divided into seven sects (to one of which a Yezidi must belong), each sect having a guardian angel. Other saints are Shaikh Hasan al Basri, whose descendants alone amongst the Yezidis are permitted to read and write ; Shaikh Muhammad Abu Diyak ; Khatun Fakhrah, who keeps the gate of paradise ; and Shaikh Mand, whose descendants can pick up vipers. The Yezidis have a spring fast of three days, one member of the family fasting for the others. They are said to possess a “ Black Book,” generally supposed to be the Quran with the name of Shaitan blacked out wherever it occurs. The Yezidis are entirely agriculturalists and speak Kurmanji, a Kurdish dialect. They are extremely tenacious of their faith ; and conversions, even in the time of persecutions to which they have been frequently subjected, were rare. They are whole hearted supporters of the British, and profess a great sympathy for the Christians, many of whom they sheltered in the Jabal Sinjar during the War. This, coupled with raids on the lines of communications, led the Turks to take punitive measures against them in 1917. The present Mir or head of the Yezidis is Said Beg. He has a rival for the position in his cousin Ismail Beg, who lives at Balad Sinjar. Unlike their co-religionists of the Jabal Sinjar, the Yezidis of the Shaikhan are a peaceful people with no warlike instincts. Outside the neighbourhood of Mosul and the Jabal Sinjar there are Yezidi communities at Mardin, Diarbekr, Aleppo and in the Caucasus. For fuller particulars of the Yezidi faith and customs see Military Report of 'Iraq, Area 1 (Northern Jazirah).311 YEZIDIS 5 6 7 Armed Men. Rifles. Horse. Foot. Total. Modern. Old but Service able.

During the first few years of the British occupation of Central Kurdistan the Zibar tribe were consistently hostile. In November, 1919, the Zibar Aghas were implicated with Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan in the murder of two Political Officers near Bira Kapra, in Zibar territory. They then occupied Aqra, destroyed all the Government records, looted the chest and killed several gendarmes. The ringleaders, Paris Agha and Babekr Agha, withdrew into the mountains, and offered no resistance to the punitive column. A reward of ten thousand rupees was offered for the surrender to Government of either of the rebels, but such is the fear of the Aghawat among Kurdish tribesmen that nothing resulted. In the beginning of 1920 Paris Agha, who had meantime returned to his village, proceeded to Bajil to visit Shaikh Ubaidullah of the Surchi, and endeavoured to obtain his support in an attack on Aqra. The attack did not materialise at that time, but in April a military convoy was ambushed and destroyed, and a few days later the Zibar co-operated with the Surchi and attacked the town, which put up a spirited defence. The power of the Zibar was broken by the Assyrians in the following November during the repatriation movement, and Paris Agha had to take refuge in Oramar. The Zibar were again in active rebellion in 1922, and were among the leading spirits in the attack on Amadia in October of that year. The Aghas were a fertile field for the Turkish propaganda, which was directed from Rowanduz and Jazirat- ibn-Omar. During the operations which resulted in the ejection of the Turks from Rowanduz in the spring of 1923 the Zibar did not oppose the troops, and Paris Agha with other lesser chiefs was permitted to surrender on payment of a fine of 40 rifles. Since that time the tribe has given no trouble.315 ZIBAR Armed Men. Rifles. Horse. Foot. Total. Modern.

Paris Agha is paramount, but the lesser chiefs do not follow his lead. Paris Agha and Babekr Agha are at feud, but are able to combine in the event of any rebellious movement as in the Aqra rising of November, 1919, and in the attack on Amadia in 1922. The Aghas of the Zibar oppress their peasants in order to pay for their armed men and so maintain their authority. Qadir Agha of Shush has now severed his connection with the rest of the Zibar, but would support the other Aghas in the event of inter tribal war. He is loyal to Govern ment, and has staunchly upheld authority in the troubles which have taken place since British occupation. External Relations. —Paris Agha is hostile to Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan. Babekr Agha is the opposite, as his late daughter was married to Shaikh Ahmad. Paris Agha is friendly to Shaikh Ubaidullah of the Surchi, but Babekr Agha is hostile. The Herki and the Zibar are friendly. Formerly at feud with Nerva and Raikan tribes, but now friendly. Political Attitude. —The Zibar chiefs submit to direct control unwillingly, and pay taxes with as good grace. The tribe is truculent and potentially hostile, and would be likely to give trouble if disturbances took place in their vicinity. Punitive Measures. —The tribal habitat is accessible from Aqra. A force located at Bira Kapra could deal with the villages of Paris Agha and Babekr Agha. On former punitive operations the tribe has retired across the Greater Zab. Their country is also accessible from Amadia. Fighting Characteristics. —Reputed good fighters. They have no mounted men, all fighting on foot. The tribe is well armed with modern rifles with a supply of 100 rounds for each weapon.CHAPTER X. PERSONALITIES. Note .—The following normal prefixes and titles are put after the names of personalities in this chapter :— Saiyid. Haji. Shaikh. Mulla. Mar. Malik. For example, Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan will not be found under the letter “ S,” but under “ A,” viz., Ahmad of Barzan, Shaikh. AMul Latif, Haji. I.eader of one of the Amadia factions, formerly Rais Beladiyah and opponent of Haji Shaban Agha. Sent to Mosul for intriguing earty in 1919 ; subsequently allowed to return. The part he took in the Amadia rising was (and is) very doubtful; after our occupation of Amadia he was compelled to live in Mosul until further orders. On our evacuation was given 300 rifles and put in as Government head of Amadia (December, 1920), a position which he filled with dexterity and success. It was subsequently found desirable to reduce his power by gradual stages. During the Assyrian repatriation movements Amadia was incorporated in the Dohuk district as a Nahiyah with Abdul Latif as Mudir ; whilst on the appointment of a Qaimmaqam and the reformation of Amadia Qadha he was deprived of Govern ment authority. His restless passion for intrigue again asserted itself in September, 1922, when, assisted by promises of Turkish support from Rowanduz, he made a spectacular and almost successful attempt to seize Amadia. On the failure of this he fled to Barzan. His sister was the wife of Shaikh Abdul Sala am, the former Shaikh of Barzan. Was allowed to come in after the reoccupation of Rowanduz on a payment of Rs. 10,000. Was on security in Mosul during the visit of the Frontier Commission in 1925, and visited Jawad Pasha, for which he was rewarded by a beating from the Hizb al Istiqlal. After the departure of the Commission was deported to Turkey, where he remained until 1927. He was sent back to Mosul by the Turks and imprisoned there. In 1928 he was permitted to return to Amadia, and has since remained quiet.318 Abdul Rahman s/o Shaikh Hamid, Shaikh. A relative of Shaikh Nuri of Brifkan (q.v.). Lives at Atrash, Dohuk district. Preached sedition in 1919, and was placed under the guarantee of Shaikh Nuri to be of good behaviour. Again engaged in anti-British propaganda at Aqra in 1923. In May, 1925, he visited the local authorities, and promised to obey Government orders, since when his conduct has been satisfactory. Abdul Rahman Agha of Sheraakh. Was Chief of the Shernakh till about March, 1920, when Sulaiman Agha was elected in his stead. At the beginning of 1920 appeared as leader of tne Kurdish Nationalist movement in Shernakh with the avowed purpose of getting one of the Bedr Khans to become ruler of Kurdistan under British auspices. Also despatched a telegram to the Sultan denouncing the Kemalist regime. Became Chief of the Shernakh again in 1921. With other signatories sent a letter to King Faisal in July, 1921, asking for help against the Turks and inclusion in Traq. He, however, gave up the chieftainship in 1922 in favour of Ali Khan. Was arrested in January, 1923, by the Turks, and imprisoned at Diarbekr, but escaped in May, 1925. Remained quiet and did not support the rising in 1926! Was again arrested in the spring of 1927 with five other leading men of Shernakh, since when there has been no reliable information of his fate ; but it is most probable that he has been executed. Abdullah s/o Husain Pasha. His father is chief of the Haidaran Kurds, between Lake Van and Bayazid. For short history of the family see Husain Pasha. In September, 1928, Abdullah arrived in Mosul from Aleppo under a false name. He was endeavouring to take refuge with Saiyid Taha. Was taken into custody, but later released and deported to Syria. Aged about 40, Abdullah seems to have suffered mentally as a result of his privations in exile. Abu Bekr Agha. An Artushi Chief. His brother, Laskin Agha, and he were implicated in the 1926 Kurdish rebellion; fled to Traq and returned to Turkey on a promise of amnesty. Laskin Agha was arrested and executed in Van. Abu Bekr Agha is a fugitive in the LVumieh neighbourhood. Ahmad of Barzan, Shaikh. An important religious chief, who lives at Barzan in the Barosh country opposite Bira Kapra. His famous brother. laiA' fliacter. (tafiicter, let the till the EosaDdu losul in Iqra.

He rebelled against the Turks, and was eventually hanged in Mosul. The present Shaikh Ahmad is not a strong character, and has been hostile to Government for years. Soon after the British occupation owing largely to his chronic feud with the Zibaris, he tried hard to get himself included in the Rowanduz Oadha. This, however, was not done. He came to Mosul in 1919, and always appeared friendly to the A.P.O. Aqra. The Shaikh was visited in November, 1919, by the late Mr. Bill (P O., Mosul) and his assistant the late Captain Scott, whereupon his younger brother Muhammad Sadiq ]eft the house with a few men just after their departure to assist Babekr and Paris Aghas in the murder of these two officers. For this act Rs. 10,000 was put on the head of each of them, and Shaikh Ahmad’s house was burned by our troops during punitive operations. He wrote to the P.O., Mosul, in 1920 protesting his non-complicity in the murder and his good intentions. His tribe opposed the crossing of the Zab by the Assyrians, and consequently Barzan was destroyed in November, 1920. In September, 1922, he was concerned in the attack on Amadia, and many of his villages were destroyed by combined action of R.A.F. and Irregulars. He made submission in April, 1923, and after the reoccupation of Rowanduz. looted the Turkish line of communication to Neri. But there was no real change of heart. In 1925 Shaikh Ahmad’s area was brought under the nominal control of the ’Iraq Government, and in 1927 an effort was made to tighten up the administration there. This he opposed, and Barzan was occupied by force. Later on in the year he again made trouble, but an air demonstration brought him temporarily into line. During 1928 he has not been actively hostile, but his attitude constantly changes—one moment threatening and the next submissive. Shaikh Ahmad is one of the three important Shaikhs of Bahdinan, the others being Shaikh Baha-ud-Din of Bamurni and Shaikh Nuri of Brifkan. He has great religious prestige, and is even referred to by his devotees as the Khuda-i-Barzan or God of Barzan. His followers are known as “ Mirid,’’ and can be recognised by their red-spangled turbans. The Shirwan, Mazuri, some of the Shemsdinan Girdi and other minor tribal chiefs look upon him with the greatest superstitious awe, and obey his orders without question. Shaikh Ahmad is neither a man of great ability nor of even balance. He is easily swayed by the advice of fanatical followers, which probably accounts for his vacillating demeanour. His days as a religious and secular autocrat must end sooner or later, and hs is naturally anxious to stave off that time as long as possible. He interprets any move of Government as a step towards that end, and is conse quently suspicious and irritable. Shaikh Ahmad is not on terms with Saiyid Taha. He is married to a daughter of Babe^r Agha of the Zibar.Akram Jamil Zadeh. A member of the Jamil Pasha family of Diarbekr, aged 30, educated in Switzerland, and accompanied Major Noel on his expedition through Kurdistan in 1919. Is an ardent Kurdish Nationalist. Was actively engaged in this movement in 1922, when he was betrayed by Abdul Karim, a minor Haverki Chief of Challek. The Turks imprisoned him in Angora, but he was soon released owing to the influential position of his family. Akram finally took part in the Kurdish revolt of 1925, for which he was sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment. All Khan of Shemakh. One of the leading men of Shernakh and a staunch supporter of Abdul Rahman Agha. Was appointed paramount chief of the tribe in 1922. Very pro-British.

Babekr Agha s/o Usman Agha of the Zibar lives at Alka in the Bira Kapra neighbourhood. On good terms with Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan, but at feud with Paris Agha (Zibar). In November, 1919, both were summoned to meet the P.O. and the A.P.O. owing to sniping of gendarmes, and when they said they could not prevent it, were fined Rs. 200 each. Whereupon they joined hands, and with the assistance of Muhammad Sadiq, brother of Sahikh Ahmad, to whom they had sent for men saying “there was work to be done,” they waited for Mr. Bill and Captain Scott and shot them dead. A reward of Rs. 10,000 was put on Babekr s head, and his house at Bira Kapra was destroyed. Since then he had been a party to most of the anti-Government intrigues, but has taken little overt action. Opposed the Assyrians in November, 1920, and remained hostile in 1922. Asked for terms in April, 1923, just before the occupation of Rowanduz, but was not allowed to come in. Submitted after the occupation with Paris Agha, and paid a fine of rifles. Is again hostile to Paris and of a most truculent disposition, although he has remained quiet during the past few years. BadP s/o Shaikh Muhammad, Shaikh. A Surchi Chief living at Dobi on the Greater Zab. Half- brother of Shaikh ’Ubaidullah (see genealogical table of the Surchi). At enmity with all his brothers except perhaps Waji. Since321 our arrival has always played a pro-Government game, but very cautiously. Being a man of peace his influence is very limited. Carries a certain amount of weight, however, in the Desht-i-Harir. Originally head Shaikh of the Surchi, but ousted by ’Ubaidullah. Recognised as leader of the migratory Surchi, and occasionally accompanies the tribe to their summer quarters. Badriyah s/o Abdullah, Haji. Zakho district. A leading Sindi Agha living at Spindarog. Formerly a prosperous brigand. Outwardly friendly with Government, but maintained friendly intercourse with the Turks to safeguard his interests in the former disputed territory. Baha-ud-Din of Bamurni, Shaikh. Amadia district. One of the famous Naqshbandi Shaiks of Kurdistan, and one of the three religious personalities of Bahdinan, the others being Shaikh Nuri of Brifkan and Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan. Honest and kindly, and so has little temporal power. Probably with the intention of securing his influence, Haji Shaban Agha held a meeting in his house soon after the Amadia murders. The Shaikh was held to be implicated and his house and “ Takiyah ” were destroyed, and he was sent to Baghdad in August, 1919. Released and allowed to return to Bamurni. Is closely attached to Rashid Beg of Barwari-Bala, their wives being sisters, members of the Abbasid family of Julamerk. Age about 74. His elder brother Ala-ud-Din was described by the A.P.O., Dohuk, as a wicked old man. Another brother of Baha-un-Din is Shaikh Salim of Mosul. Baha-ud-Din’s influence is probably confined to Amadia and Barwari. Dawid d’Mar Shim’un. Brother of Mar Shim’un, who was murdered by Simko. Married to Esther, sister of Mar Yusuf Khananishu, and by her, father of the present Mar Shim’un. Age about 40. Now attached to the O.C.

At present Qaimmaqam of Amadia. A young, energetic and efficient administrator. Was born in Mosul of a Turkish father, about 37 years of age. Was employed by the Turks ; his last appointment with them being in charge of a refugee relief camp at the end of the War. About 1920 he went to Turkey, where he was made a Qaim maqam in the Urfa Vilayet. Returned to Mosul about 1922,and has since been Head Clerk to the Mntasarrif of Mosul, Qaim- maqam of Zakho.

A reward of Rs. 10,000 was put on Paris’s head, and his house at Huke and those of his chief men were destroyed. At the end of 1919 he moved to Bajil, planned a raid on Aqra— frustrated by aeroplane action—in March ; and was instrumental in bringing about the Surchi rising, which occurred soon after wards. His enmity to Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan led to hostilities between them during 1920. In March, 1921, he fled to Simko’s country, and was imprisoned by him. Generally spoken of as an attractive personality, who was lured into trouble by Babekr. His village was burned by a punitive force in 1922 after the attack on Amadia. Remained consistently hostile and was with Euz Demir until the latter was ejected from Rowanduz in April, 1923. Considered to have submitted later, having paid a fine of rifles, but kept up a regular correspondence with the Turks. For the past few years Paris has not been actively hostile apart from ordinary intrigue. He is, however, definitely irre concilable and, should an opportunity present itself, he may be counted as being a live enemy of the Government. Francis David. Chaldean Bishop of Amadia. Age about 65. A very dignified old gentleman, hospitable and always ready to welcome strangers. Lives at Aradin, west of Amadia. Is on friendly terms with Shaikh Baha-ud-Din of Bamurni. Speaks French, and appears to be popular with Chaldeans and Nestorians alike. Haidar Beg. Wali of Mosul at the beginning of the War and well spoken of. Was on good terms with the Chaldean Patriarch, and prevented Christian massacres in the Vilayet. His father was Wali of Van, where he also held several positions. Became Wali of Van and the originator of Turkish intrigues in Persia and on our northern frontier.

Chief of the Haidaran, a large and powerful Kurdish tribe between Van and Bayazid. Husain is now about 80 years of age. In his early days he was a noted brigand. In Sultan Hamid’s time the tribe raised eight cavalry regiments for the Hamidiyeh, in consequence of which Husain was given the rank of Brigadier- General and created a Pasha. Although it is stated that he took no part in the Kurdish rebellion of 1925, Husain and all his family were exiled by the Turks to Kaisariyeh, where they remained for about three years. Here he made repeated applications to return to his home under the terms of the Kurdish amnesty, but they were all refused on the grounds that certain sections of his tribe were still m spasmodic revolt near the Persian frontier. In August, 1928, Husain and his family escaped from Kaisariyeh and went to Aleppo. Twomonths later they came to Mosul, but were deported to Syria. Has five sons alive, namely :— Abdullah Beg (q.v.). Muhammad Beg. Yusuf Beg. Afon. Nadir. Ibrahim Tali Beg. Turkish Civil Inspector-General of the Eastern Vilayets. His headquarters are at Diarbekr, and the Vilayets under his control include, amongst others, Diarbekr, Mardin, Hakkiari and Van. He is, therefore, the chief Turkish civil official on ’Iraq’s northern frontier. Ibrahim Tali was a doctor by profession ; and, until his appointment in January, 1928, sat as a Deputy for Diarbekr in the National Assembly. He was one of the chief organisers of the People’s Party, and for a short time held the post of Turkish Minister at Warsaw. Little is known as to his character, but he appears to be a broad and moderate Governor, who has been commissioned to put into effect a constructive policy of conciliation amongst the Kurds. Ismail Agha. Aqra district. Ashair al Saba Agha of Ruvia. Has a bitter feud with Shaikh Raqib of the Surchi. Stood firm in the raid on Aqra in 1919, and also subsequently.

Described as arrogant and clumsy. Professes pro-British sentiments. Sheltered Simko after his defeat by the Persians. Was implicated with the other chiefs of the Artushi in the 1926 rebellion, and was obliged to take refuge in ’Iraq territory. Did not return to Turkey on the promulgation of the amnesty and so was more fortunate than Laskin Agha, who was arrested and executed in Van. In 1927 Ismail was brought to Mosul under arrest for procuring and selling arms. Has two sons, Hamid and Yusuf.325 Ismail Agha (Simko)— see Simko. Ismail s/o Malik Yakub, Malik. Malik of the Upper Tiari, age about 55 ; formerly lived at Chambad Malik, on the Zab west of Julamerk. Courageous, respected for his piety and feared for his intrigue.

In January, 1927, the Mulla submitted with Jamil Agha to the ’Iraq Authorities. Intelligent, underhand and cunning. Jamil Agha s/o Abdi Agha. Nominally chief of the Sindi. Lives at Darhausan, moving to Marsis in summer. Kept the Sindi quiet in the early years of our occupation, but became disaffected in the spring of 1925 during the visit of the Mosul Boundary Commission. Ambushed a police patrol near Shiranis in April, 1925, and subsequently fled to the Turks. During the years 1925 and 1926 carried on intermittent raiding in the Zakho neighbourhood, using Turkish territory as his base. Applied for terms towards the end of 1926, and made formal submission in January, 1927. His section of the Sindi (Pasagha) was disarmed, and Jamil Agha agreed to pay fines and com pensation to the relatives of the policemen who lost their lives in the 1925 ambush. Quiet and not very effective, Jamil Agha has not the influence of his father Abdi Agha, who was a strong man. He and Haji Badriyah are reported to have declared for the Turks before the Frontier Commission on behalf of the Sindi. Jawad Effendi. A cousin of Faris Agha (Zibar). Lives at Naqabi, 7 miles south-east of Zibar. In February, 1928, a search of his house revealed the fact that he had been carrying on an anti- Iraq correspondence with the Turks ; and an unsuccessful attempt was made to arrest him. Said to hold a cypher by which the Turks correspond with the Surchi and Zibar chiefs.Jawad Pasha, General. Turkish General Officer, formerly Inspector-General of the 3rd Inspectorate at Diarbekr. Was President of the Turkish Delegation on the Mosul Frontier Commission in the spring of 1925. Rich, capable, and possessed of considerable charm of manner, he is said to be very anti-Arab. Jehangir Agha s/o Tahir Agha. A man about 45. The son of Tahir Agha, Chief of the Serati section of the Herki. Jehangir winters in the vicinity of Aqra with the Mandan section, of which he is a chief, and spends the summer north of Rowanduz on the Persian Frontier. His father remains in Persia. Not particularly intelligent, but seems genuinely desirous of serving Government. Is friendly with Qadir Agha of Shush, but is against Paris Agha (Zibar), Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan and the Surchi Shaikhs. During the intrigues which were being carried on by these Shaikhs in 1927-28, Jehangir could be relied upon to give good information. Has recently been granted a village to cultivate near Aqra. Kalkhi Agha of Raikan. The leading Agha of Raikan ; first cousin of Wahab (Habi) f Agha, who was murdered by Sutu Agha of Oramar in October, 1919. Having promised a girl to Khalili Khoshawi, who had sheltered him, he married her to a Raikan Agha, which led to fighting between Raikan and Mazuri-Bala. Restless, but has a wholesome respect for Government. Produced a tribal force to assist the Qaimmaqam of Amadiain the 1922 revolt, and destroyed several Mazuri-Bala villages. Village, Razka. Khalil Khoshawi. A leading Agha of Mazuri-Bala. Completely under the influence of Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan, and took part in the attack on Amadia in 1922.

Khamu of Baz, Malik. - Leader of the Baz tribe, and gained a reputation for leadership in fighting with Sutu of Oramar. Audacious in war, but unsteady in council.

A pleasant individual. His sons were pupils in the English school at Van.327 Khoshaba s/o Malik Yusuf, Malik. Of the house of Ba Polus of Lizan, Tiari; age about 65. The Lizan people have had a feud with the Mirs of Bawari as long as they can remember. Malik Berkho tried to pacify it and, as a result, fell out with Malik Yusuf. In a raid on a Lizan caravan by Haji Rashid Beg of Bawari-Bala and Berkho, a man of Rashid’s named Haidar was killed by the Lizan. Yusuf was also trying to get hold of the Deshtan village in Bawari-Bala and the Kara salt pans. The enmity increased and finally Rashid Beg and Yusuf treacherously seized him, bound him to a tree and shot him over Haidar’s grave. Much fighting followed in which Sa’id, Rashid’s brother, was killed, and Rashid several times declared “ jihad ” to protect himself against the Tiari. Khoshaba vowed he would never set eyes on Rashid except in mortal fight. During the War Khoshaba was one of Lazar’s heroic com panions at the Mar Sawa bridge. He and Shumel Yalda, hearing (falsely) that the British had reached Mosul, made their way from Urumieh to Mosul and back. Returned to Lizan in 1922. Believing his wife to be unfaithful, he murdered both her and his daughter. Was instrumental in effecting the release of Bekr Lutfi, Wali of Julamerk, after his affray with the Tkhuma in 1924. In consequence of this good turn to Turkey he was allowed to remain in the Lizan valley after the flight of the Tiari from the Turkish punitive expedition, and is still living in Turkey. Well educated, speaks English, and is said to be a strong virile character. Undoubtedly, however, he suffers from temporary fits of insanity. Khurshid Agha (Herki). One of the leading Aghas of the Herki, who winter in the Arbil neighbourhood. Has been elected chief for the past few years. A friend of Saiyid Taha. Mami Agha. Chief of the Zaidek Artushi, lives at Shakeftiyan near Ba’idri. A weak man, who is unable to keep his somewhat unruly followers in order. Hated by the Mazuri, and dislikes Haji Rashid Beg intensely. Is somewhat truculent and quarrels with Said Beg and the Yezidis over grazing fees. Mar Sergis—Sergis. Mar Shimun —see Shimun. Mar Timotheus - sg&lt;? Timotheus.Muhammad Agha s/o Haji Agha. Head of the Sherifan section of the Artushi nomads. His father was a Bimbashi of Hamidiyah and tyrant of the Simel plain 20 years ago. Muhammad Agha has not the same influence, and, when the British arrived, owing to poverty and hostility of Turkish authorities, was in danger of being ousted by his cousin Abdul Karim. He has now quite recovered his position, and is looked upon as the most important of the migratory Artushi. Is steady and well disposed to us. Disliked by Shaikh Nuri of Brifkan owing to family marriage troubles. Age about 45. His daughter married a son of Ismail Agha Geravi in 1921. Muhammad Ali Yunus. Of Malifan, 10 miles north of Zokh. Said to have been the leader of a band of Kurdish rebels, including some of the Modki tribe [see Musa Beg). This band was operating in the Bitlis area in 1927, and was defeated by a Turkish punitive column sent against them. Muhammad Ibrahim Agha. Chief of the Hajjan section of the Artushi nomads. A man about 40, and appears a purposeful individual. A close friend of Hazim Beg of Zakho and on good terms with the Aghas of Shernakh. Muhammad Sadiq, Shaikh. Brother of Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan. Reported to have fired the first shot in the Aqra disturbances in 1919, and to have had some share in the murder of the late Mr. Bill in the same year. Also is thought to have been responsible for the murder of Shaikh Ahmad s Miilla in September, 1927. A young hot-head, age about 24, but of no particular significance. Probably used by Shaikh Ahmad for unscrupulous acts. Musa Beg, Haji. Brother of Nuh Beg (q.v.). Chief of the Modki, Bitlis area. He and his brother took an active part in the 1925 Kurdish revolt. Was with Husain Pasha (Haidaran) in exile in Kaisariyeh, but escaped with him to Aleppo in August, 1928. Came to Mosul two months later, but was deported again to Syria. About 65 years of age. Musa Beg s/o Sharif Beg. Of Barwari-Bala and lives at Dergeli. Rival of Haji Rashid Beg in Barwari-Bala, his ancestors having been Mirs of Barwari before Rashid Beg’s grandfather usurped the position. The329 (C 16145) M feeling between the two runs very high. Took no part in the Amadia rising in 1919, and was made head of the district during Haji Rashid Beg’s sojourn in Mosul. In this capacity he kept the district quiet, and it was with some regret that on Haji Rashid Beg’s return he had to be ordered to resign in the latter’s favour. Slow-witted and something of a simpleton. Age about 55. Full of complaints against the local Government officials, whom he accuses of oppression and malice. Mustafa Jibrail, Mulla. A wealthy and important landowner, who lives in Aqra. Has taken no part in any of the hostile acts perpetrated in the Aqra district after the War. Is on bad terms with Shaikh Ubaidullah (Surchi). Professedly pro-Government, but requires watching owing to his penchant for intrigue. Naif Beg s/o Musto Pasha (Miran). Chief of the Miran. Generally on friendly terms with Sulaiman Agha of the Girgiri; but took no part in the Tel Afar rising in 1920. Was to a certain extent under the influence of Abdul Rahman Agha of Shernakh. Has a long-standing feud with Haji Abdul Aziz of the Hassanan. His tribe murdered several hundred Christians during the War at the instigation of the Turks in the Faishkhabur neighbourhood. Was one of the signatories of a letter to King Faisal in July, 1921, asking for help against the Turks and inclusion in ’Iraq. Attempted to raid the Hassanan flocks near Faishkhabur in the summer of 1921, for which he was bombed with good effect. Did not render assistance to Abdul Rahman Agha of Shernakh when the Turks attacked him in October, 1921. Naif’s father, Mustafa Pasha, owing to his position as a Hamidiyeh Bimbashi and the favour of the Sultan, was extremely powerful, and terrorised the country around the town of Jazirat- ibn-Omar. Was finally killed fighting against the Shernakh. In 1925 Naif Beg was ordered to find a force of 300 tribal horse (Hamidiyeh), and was given the rank of Bimbashi. He also gave 1,200 gold liras as a subscription to the Turkish Aeroplane Fund. In the early spring of 1926, however, fearing for his safety, he approached the ’Iraq Government for permission to come into ’Iraq territory. This being granted, the tribe moved down to the right bank of the Tigris to the Wadi Suwaidiyah, where they more or less settled. Formerly nomadic, Naif’s break with the Turks considerably altered the mode of life of the tribe. In March, 1928, Naif moved into Syrian territory, where he appears to have been unable to avoid the turmoil, which has distinguished French Northern Jazirah this year. He is said to have made overtures to Turkey for his tribe to return there, but nothing so far has resulted.Age about 35, active and capable, his position as chief of the tribe is none too strong. Naif used to keep an expensive and liberal guest tent, over 100 tribesmen, feeding them twice daily. In September, 1928, he was reliably reported to have had practically the whole of his property looted. Nauroz Agha of Oramar. A rival of Sutu Agha of Oramar. Left Oramar with some 50 families in 1922, and came to Amadia where he assisted the Qaimmaqam against the Zibar and Barzan tribesmen. Returned later to Oramar and was deported by the Turks to Azzizieh for his sojourn in Traq, but was permitted to return in the winter of 1925. Fled with Sutu to Nervek in Traq territory on the outbreak of the 1926 rebellion and settled there. Was imprisoned in Amadia with Sutu Agha on account of robberies committed by their followers on Turkish subjects. Age about 40, and appears dull and unintelligent. Nuh Beg. A brother of Haji Musa Beg, who is chief of the Modki tribe in the Bitlis area. Both he and his brother played a prominent part in the Kurdish revolt in 1925. After its suppression Nuh Beg fled to Traq, and took refuge with Simko and Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan. In September, 1928, he returned to Turkev under the terms of the Kurdish amnesty. Nuri s/o Shaikh Abdul Jabbar of Brifkan, Shaikh. Derives his name and influence from his great grandfather, Shaikh Nur-ed-Din, a famous holy man of the Bahdinan district, whose shrine at Brikfan is now superstitiously revered in the Mazuri. Present Shaikh is distinguished more for avarice than for holiness. In Turkish times kept a band of robbers, and was several times imprisoned. Took no part in the Amadia rising of 1919—though meetings were held in his house—possibly because the rebels would not accord him the paramount position he desired. Certainly was aware of the current intrigues before the Zibar rising, and notably a prime mover in Mazuri unrest in June, 1920. The tyranny and oppressiveness of his methods as a landlord are a byword ; his cupidity and greed have earned him the title of “ Shaikh Rupiyah.” An adept at local intrigue, is ignorant of the wider world and lacking in imagination. Is immensely rich. He must resent a Government which does something to restrain his oppressiveness and extortions, and it was only his innate caution and pioximity to Dohuk which kept him from overt action against us. Was detained in Dohuk in November, 1920, until he had paid up his arrears of taxes.331 M 2 (C 16145) Age about 60. Speaks Arabic. While treated with respect he is not called upon for any assistance in the administration of the district. For his relations see Muhammad Agha s/o Haii Agha and genealogical table of the Nur-al-Din family. Petros, Agha. For his early history see “ Personalities in Kurdistan.” The fact that he is a Roman Catholic is an important factor with the Patriarchal family. Colonel Leachman ordered his deportation in the summer 1919 owing to his mischief-making, but this was eventually cancelled. In the early days of 1920 he undertook, subject to certain conditions, to lead back the Assyrians to their homes. The move was made in November, 1920, but failed owing to (i) the unfavourable weather conditions ; (ii) the breaking away of the Tiari and Tkhuma. It may be doubted whether his real object was not to amass a fortune and retire to a more favour able country. Was known to be in communication with the French authorities in Syria. Is personally on good terms with Saiyid Taha. Of distinct ability and considerable force of character, it is doubtful if he has a single scruple. At the time of the dispersal of the Mindan Camp in 1920 he was kept in Baghdad and was undoubtedly, by promises of French help, etc., instigating the six “ Repatriation ” sections to refuse to settle pending bis arrival to lead another expedition. Eventually given leave of absence to Europe. Agha Petros lived in Paris and Rome after early 1921, and has been attempting to form an Assyro-Chaldean kingdom, stretching from the Murad Su to the Greater Zab. He claimed to include Mosul in this kingdom at Lausanne in 1922. Is now leading a retired life on a farm in the South of France. Pirot Agha. One of the leading chiefs of the Herki, who resides with one of the sedentary sections in the Urumieh Plain. Had not visited ’Iraq for some 10 years until September, 1928, when he came down to the Aqra district with part of the nomadic sections of the Herki. Qadir Agha s/o Usman Agha. Aqra district. A Zibari Agha of Shush. The eldest of the five sons of Usman Agha, who, owing to tribal quarrels, was forced to leave Herrin in the Zab valley and migrate to Shush, where he died in 1920. Usman Agha was well known for his pro- Government tendencies ; his son Qadir Agha fought for the Turks against us at Shu’aibah and again at Kurnah, where he was wounded by a machine-gun bullet. Has been consistently pro-British and materially assisted us during the Surchi attackon Aqra in April, 1920, and in the subsequent punitive measures. Was helpful to the Assyrian advance to the Zab, November, 1920. In 1921, was somewhat disgruntled at finding he was expected to pay taxes like other people. He came to Baghdad with the Mosul deputation to see King Faisal on his arrival in 'Iraq. Is definitely hostile to Paris Agha and Babekr Agha of the Zibar tribe, and to other anti-Government elements in the Amadia- Aqra area. Married a daughter of Haji Abdullah in November, 1920. Age about 35 ; said to be a good landlord, considerate to bis tenants and protector of Christians. Was given a sword of honour in April, 1920. Rather fat and slow of speech. Speaks Persian. Has constantly resisted repeated attempts of the Turks to under mine his loyalty. Has considerable influence with the Herki. {See genealogical table—Zibar, page 345.) Qambar Werda. Ex Malik of Jilu. Married to a daughter of Nimrud who was murdered on the outbreak of war {see Mar Shimun)—Malik Qambar left Kurdistan some years ago and went to Russia. After the Armistice he went to Constantinople, where he was employed by the British Army of Occupation. On our withdrawal he went to Syria and raised Assyrian Levies for the French. Now living in Beirut, where he edits a Syriac weekly journal. He is a very strong supporter of the Syro-Chaldean movement^ which encourages the unity of all Syriac speaking people irrespective of religion. Raqib s/o Shaikh Muhammad, Shaikh. Aqra district. Half-brother of Ubaidullah. The stormy petrel of the Surchi. His village has been burned three times in ten years, once by us in February, 1920, and twice by the Turks. A lawless individual, who kept a gang of robbers for purposes of highway robbery. His men murdered five Christian gendarmes in November, 1919, when they were retiring to Mosul after the Zibari capture of Aqra. Has taken a prominent part in all the Surchi rebellions. During 1921 he showed himself consistently anti-Government. Transferred his activities to the Dasht-i-Harir, and at the end of July attacked Batas, forced the gendarme garrison to surrender and murdered the Arab Officer. Supported the Turks on their arrival in Rowanduz. Took advantage of King Faisal’s amnesty to visit Aqra accompanied by a Turkish Officer in disguise in July, 1922. However, continued consistently hostile, and lived chiefly in the Batas area. He came in a second time in April, 1923, just before the occupation of Rowanduz, Ubaidullah remaining some time with the Turks to maintain the balance.333 Since his submission has been quiet, but is still truculent and capable of joining in any anti-Government outbreak in his area. (C 16145) m 3 Rashid Beg. Chief of the Shirwan. Both he and his tribe are completely under the domination of Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan, and are therefore hostile to Government. A complete puppet. Rashid Beg of Barwari-Bala, Haji. Village, Dershish. Chief of the Barwari-Bala and one of the iwen of Central Kurdistan. Traces his descent back to the Abbasides. In Turkish times was Mudir of Barwari. In 1916 he joined the movement to drive back the Assyrians, who, at Russian instigation, were attacking the outlying districts of the Liwa. Although he fought against the Christian tribes, he does not appear to have oppressed those of his own districts or to have allowed them to be massacred. Although apparently welcoming our advent, the restriction of a Government soon began to gall him, and the local Mudir found his position getting more and^ more difficult. After the Amadia rising he visited General Nightingale, who was in command of the punitive column, professed himself friendly and obtained supplies As a result of something, however (possibly the destruction of Bamurni), he went out against us, and was present at the Ghelli Mazurka fight, if not in command. After the fight he sent back some Indian prisoners unharmed ; and, on our penetration to Barwari and the destruction of his fine house and village, retired to Chal and Julamerk and took no part against us. He surrendered unconditionally in the spring of 1920 ; and, after an enforced sojourn of some months in Mosul, was allowed to return to Barwari and was reinstated as chief of the tribe. He is a proud and sagacious character with a gift of diplomacy ; very rich and influential. Treats his rival Musa Beg with studied contempt. Married a daughter of the Abbasid house of Julamerk, who is also a sister of Baha-ud-Din’s wife. Eldest son is Tatar Khan Beg. Has a deep blood feud with Malik Khoshaba of Lower Tiari. Age about 55. He gave considerable assistance to Government during the operations of 1922 in the Zibar valley, and was decorated with the 2nd Class of the Nahdah in 1923. In 1924 was a Member of the Constituent Assembly, and voted against the Anglo-Traq Treaty. Was of wavering loyalty during the Turkish occupation of Ashita in September, 1924, and was said to have met the Turkish Commander at Chelki and to have accompanied him to Mai. Failed to report himself at Amadia until brought in by the troops. Explained his conduct satisfactorily, and was allowed to return. During the Doski revolt in 1925 was brought to Amadia and placed on security.334 His inconsistency was probably' due to the fact that the ^ Turco-’Iraq frontier was not settled, and living on the frontier he did not wish to commit himself to either side. He has now Ba’ rebuilt his house and village, and appears quite settled down. With direct control by Government his influence has decreased, hos but he is still the most powerful personality in the Amadia te area. Lives on good terms with the Nestorian Christians of cap; Barwari-Bala. In February, 1928, Rashid Beg visited Mosul in search of Government employment for his son. ^ Jak ftzi Rashid Agha s/o Ibrahim Agha. Dohuk district. Village, Hojawa. By marriage acquired a r leading position among the Doski; was appointed chief of the u. tribe for a few months. Discontinued, however, owing to jealousy and consequent disturbances. Was implicated in the armed demonstration at Dohuk in March, in th 1925, on the occasion of the visit of the Frontier Commission, the I and subsequently refused to come into Government. Active Front measures were then taken against him and other Doski mal- sh 0 fff contents, and he fled across the frontier to the Turks. Hojawa s, was then destroyed. He remained with the Turks and was given permission to harvest the crops of the Christians of Merga, who Salat had fled to Zakho. ^ Submitted in 1926 and has been quiet since. He has no Befor influence in the tribe now, and has little claim to style himself neerii “Agha.” M Sadiq Beru. The most important of the Guli Aghas ; winter quarters, Khuk Guli; summer quarters, Bahnuna. Was, like his father, a notorious brigand. Went out against us after the Amadia rising in 1919. Bahnuna was destroyed by our troops. Remained out till September, 1920, when he made submission and has been of moderately good behaviour since. Not on good terms with the Sindi Aghas. In 192 d represented the Guli before the Frontier Commission and is reported to have voted for the Turks. Said, Mulla. Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan’s clerk. Is employed by the Shaikh as his representative in business dealings with ’Iraq Government officials, and in this connection frequently visits Mosul. He appears to be a moderate man, but whether he has any great influence over his master is doubtful. he ago andm In m q being i quent: A b his hot .'^r, ai has bee: •fe. to&amp;iy Here res Ponsil ktif, or Bolnh (C16145335 : tlie nfier dok «d, idia iof a le y Said Beg s/o Ali Beg.

Village, Germawa The only Doski Agha with much influence. Not a particularly strong character, but sensible. Age about 38. He gave very considerable assistance to Government in the operations of 1922 m the Zibar valley. Remained staunch during the trouble in the Dohuk district in 1925 on the occasion of the visit of the Frontier Commission, when most of the other Doski Aghas showed themselves actively anti-Government. Has a pleasing personality. b Salah-ed-Din s/o Saiyid Ali, Saiyid. A powerful Kurd of the Khisan area, just south of Lake Van. Before the War his father was executed by the Turks for engi neering a Kurdish rising. Salah himself was exiled j but during the War was recalled to become Qaimmaqam of Khisan, which district the Turks were unable to control. In the spring of 1924 he again revolted, defeated a body of troops sent to arrest him, and made good his escape. In 1925 he was to the forefront in the Kurdish rebellion, and was quoted, with Khalid Beg Hassananli (since executed), as being the prime mover of the revolt in the Bit!is area. His subse quent fate is unknown. Salih Agha (Sindi). A brother of Jamil Agha, chief of the Sindi. Took part in his brother’s raiding activities during 1925. Submitted the same year, and was permitted to return to his home, since when he has been quiet. Said to be more virile than most of the Sindi Aghas. Sergis, Mar. Hereditary title of the Nestorian Bishop of Jilu and Baz. A big man about 50. The Assyrian “ Friar Tuck.” Was largely responsible for beating off the attack, instigated by Haji Abdul Latif, on Amadia in 1922. Now lives at Khairshainieh near Dohuk. (C 16145) M 4 (Shaban Agha of Amadia, Haji. The leader of one of the two factions in Amadia (v. Haji Abdul Latif) whose intrigues in 1919 were the prelude to the Amadia rising. The murder of Captains Willey and MacDonald seems to have been due to a burst of ill-feeling among some gendarme chaushes ; he himself was not in Amadia at the time, but some of his relations were and undoubtedly took part. It is possible that he deprecated the murders as unpolitical, and felt that, as they had occurred, the only thing to do was to drive out the British. Whatever the reasons, he subsequently took a leading part in the rebellion ; and, on being driven out by our troops, took refuge in Jazirat-ibn-Omar, where he pursued his original calling of caravan runner, interspersed with attempts to incite the tribes against us. Of low birth, age about 55, and an enemy of Haji Abdul Latif. Submitted in December, 1922, and was allowed to return to Amadia. Made active preparations for a demonstration at Amadia in 1925 on the visit of the Frontier Commission, which, however, did not visit the town. Arranged to participate in the Dohuk demonstration, but again failed owing to the prior departure of the Commission. Fled from Amadia in 1925 through fear of Government action against him, and resided in Tkhuma. In October, 1928, he returned to 'Iraq and submitted to the authorities in Mosul, where it is probable that he will be detained for some time. Shafiq Agha s/o Muhammad Yasin Agha. Another of the malcontent Doski Aghas implicated in the 1925 unrest. Village, Zewa. Came into Government after active measures had been taken against him ; paid a rifle and money fine and served a short term of imprisonment. On being released decamped across the frontier and made overtures to the Turks, which were not very well received. Carried on intermittent raiding on Doski villages, mainly directed against the Chief, Said Agha. Accepted terms of submission in 1926 and returned to his village, where he is now of little importance. Shamsdiu s/o Malik Daniel, Malik. Of lower Tiari, and now resident in Barwari-Bala. His father Daniel and grandfather Berkho were both famous leaders. Shamsdin himself is amicable and straightforward, but seems lacking in strength of character. His son, Zaya, was an officer in the Levies, but has recently been demobilized and is showing himself somewhat dissatisfied.337 Shimun, Mar. The title of the Patriarch or Catholicos of the Assyrians, who in the year 448 assumed the title of “ Patriarch of the East.” The Patriarchal chain has been held by the present family for over 400 yea^s, and usually descends from uncle to nephew, the Patriarch himself being, by rule, obliged to lead a life of celibacy. In the early days of the present century a secessionist party against Mar Shimun was led by Nimrud, a brother of the Patriarch Ruel. Mar Avraham, a son of Nimrud, had been educated and chosen as the successor to Mar Ruel, but on his deathbed the old man changed his mind, and with the support of the Tiari conse crated his nephew Benyamin to the Partriarchate. This action displeased Nimrud and his immediate relations, who immediately joined the Chaldean Party, and worked steadily for the downfall of the young Patriarch Benyamin. On the outbreak of the Great War Nimrud's party persuaded the Turks that Benyamin and the Nestorians were in sympathy with the Allied forces. The Patriarch was compelled to leave his ancestral home at Qudshanis near Julamerk and retire to the fastnesses of the Nestorian tribal country. He then sent for the Baz Tkhuma tribes, who at his instigation massacred the whole of the Nimrud family, except one daughter who is the wife of Malik Qambar of Jilu. This Mar Shimun, who was famed for his courage and energy, was murdered by Simko during a peace conference at Salmas in 1918. His brother Polus, a weak and sickly individual, was elected Patriarch a few weeks later, but died in 1919 at the Assyrian Refugee Camp at Baqubah. The present Mar Shimun, Ishay, a nephew of the late Patriarchs Benyamin and Polus, is the son of Dawid and Esther. He is an attractive, good-looking youth of about 17, and seems bright and intelligent. After studying in England for two years under the care of the Archbishop of Canterbury, he returned to Mosul in January, 1928, to take over the affairs of his house. He is fond of sports, especially football, and for a year or two at least games will prove to be a stronger attraction than ecclesiastical functions and political intrigues. The chief influence guiding Mar Shimun is his aunt, Surma Khanum. Simko (proper name Ismail Agha). Chief of the Shikak Kurds and one of the biggest figures in Central Kurdistan. Notorious as the murderer of the Mar Shim’un. Has been at constant enmity with the Persian Govern ment. After being sent an infernal machine as a present (with great presence of mind he handed it to his brother who was killed) he attacked Urumieh. Hostilities with the Persians in early 1920 were indecisive, but in March-April with a following of Kurds and Turks he twice defeated them north of Lake Urumieh. Was then in alliance with Saiyid Taha with the object of prosecuting an independence movement. At that time was said to be capableof putting 4,000 men in the field. In the summer of 1922 he was beaten by the Persians and betrayed by the Turks, who captured his son and all his property and killed his favourite wife. He escaped in September, 1922, with about 20 followers and arrived with Saiyid Taha at Dera near Arbil. He was pardoned by the Persian Government, and subsequently joined Shaikh Mahmud at Sulaimani, but does not appear to have thought highly of him. When Shaikh Mahmud fell in March, 1923, Simko, who had made terms with the Turks, went with Euz Demir to Rowanduz, and was appointed warden of the frontier. He went on to Neri just before the occupation of Rowanduz. Kept on friendly terms with the Turks during 1925, but in December again fell foul of the Persians on account of the killing of a minor official. Through lack of troops the Persians were unable to deal with him, but released Umar Khan, a rival chief of the Shikak who had been imprisoned, and encouraged him to undermine Simko’s authority in the tribe. Meanwhile the Turks became perturbed by the liberty allowed Simko in Persian Azerbaijan. In April, 1926, he is said to have written to Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan stating that he intended visiting him shortly to discuss the Kurdish independence movement. In November Simko was at the bottom of disturbances which broke out in the Urumieh plain. With a force of 1,500 men he raided Salmas, but avoided any encounter with the Persian troops sent against him. The Persian Government—with the co-operation of the Turks—then decided to deal with him ; and eventually Simko was obliged to take refuge in 'Iraq territory north of Rowanduz, where he threw himself on the mercy of the British and ’Iraq Governments. He was given permission to live at Sidaka. Here during 1927 he made a general nuisance of himself, and abused hospitality and kindness shown to him by fellow Aghas. In June, 1928, Simko made his peace with the Turks, and took himself and his personal followers across the frontier. He at once collected about 150 men from his old tribe, the Shikak, and started raiding into Persia, probably encouraged by the Turks. In October, 1928, he and his band were living in the vicinity of Bajirga, 20 miles north-east of Diza-Gawar. The Persian Government regard his presence there as a distinct menace, and are constantly urging the Turks to hand him over to them or to remove him from the proximity of the Persian frontier. It is not easy to gauge Simko’s character. He is obviously a man of action—his record proves that. He hates the Persian Government with an inveterate hatred, which is understandable in his case. At the same time he has no real leanings towards the Turkish or ’Iraq Governments. He undoubtedly has a strong tie with his old tribe, and this is what the Persians fear. Whatever Simko was he is now little more than a common brigand, who only loves himself and has little consideration for anyone or339 anything else. Being, however, a man who has nothing to lose and all to gain, he is capable of making himself again an out standing figure in Central and Northern Kurdistan. Sulaiman Agha. Of Shernakh. Was elected chief of the tribe in succession to Abdul Rahman Agha in 1920, possibly as a result of Turkish influence. Was friendly and sent down reports of Turkish moves and intentions. Was given a pair of field glasses as a present in October, 1920. Removed from his position as paramount chief in May, 1921. Has always supported the Turks, and is therefore very unpopular with the other Aghas of Shernakh who are Kurdish Independents. Is reported to have been deported from the tribal area by the Turks in spring of 1927 with the other chief men of the Shernakh. Sulaiman Kitto. Zakho district. One of the leading Guli Aghas. Was appointed chief when Sadiq Beru was in revolt, but proved himself incapable of controlling the tribe. Assisted the Zhirki in their raids on our territory in October, 1921. Of little importance. Surma Khanum d’Mar Shim’un. Aunt of the present Mar Shim’un, a nun, and a lady who would take her place in any drawing room without attracting attention other than that compelled by her distinguished appear ance. A mainstay of the Patriarchal house and most faithful lover of her people. Well educated and speaks fluent English ; she was in England during the greater part of 1920 and was present at Geneva at the Lausanne Conference in 1922, and the Mosul Conference in 1925. Age about 45. Sutu Agha. Chief of the Oramar Kurds. Now a very old man. Has a most unsavoury reputation as an oppressor of Christians. Murdered several chiefs of the Raikan, the last one to lose his life at his hands being Abdul Wahab (November, 1919). As far as is known was not concerned in the Zibari rising of November, 1919, but gave refuge to Paris Agha and Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan after their flight. Was untouched by Turkish intrigue in 1922. Assisted the Turks to quell Saiyid Abdullah’s rising on the frontier in the summer of 1925, but was later deported to Azzizieh with his son Sadiq. Permitted to return and arrived back at Oramar in March, 1926. Fled to Nervek in Iraq territory on the outbreak of the 1926 rebellion in the Artushi area. Imprisoned at Amadia in the spring of 1927 on account of robberies committedby his people on Turkish subjects, but was later released, and in August, 1928, left ’Iraq with his family and returned to Oramar. Shaikh Ahmad of Barzan is his son-in-law. Has five sons Ibrahim, Teli, Tital, Na’aman, and Ismail. Sutu is a great enemy of the Assyrians, and is reputed treacherous and insincere. Taha s/o Shaikh Sadiq, Saiyid. Titular head of the family of the Shaikhs of Neri, where he formerly owned property, as well as in Persia. A man of some influence and considerable religious prestige. Owing to his senti ments regarding Kurdish independence came to ’Iraq in 1922, and the following year was appointed Qaimmaqam of Rowanduz. This post he has since filled satisfactorily in a rough-and-ready way. In October, 1928, the question of his resigning the appointment arose, owing to the fact that the Rowanduz district is to be brought under a more regular administration. For a fuller history of this important personality see Military Report, Area 10 (Southern Kurdistan). Tahir Agha (Herki). Chief of the Serati and Kanirpi sections of the Herki, who winter in Aqra and the Arbi! neighbourhood and summer on the Sat Dagh, north of Neri; a turbulent lot with a good fighting reputation. Tahir Agha is usually described as the head cf these sections, but it is doubtful whether he has the whole of them at his back. Was tactlessly bombed owing to Saiyid Taha, with the result that he joined the Turks early in 1923. Looted the ammunition left by the Turks at Rowanduz. Of late years Khurshid Agha has acted as chief of the Herki nomads who winter in the Arbil district. This is probably due to the influence of Saiyid Taha, to whom the selection of a chief is usually referred. Timotheus, Mar. A native of Mar Bishu in Central Kurdistan who was appointed Bishop for the Nestorians in Malabar in 1909. He was educated in the school of the Archbishop of Canterbury at Urumieh, and is considered to be the most scholarly of all the Assyrian clerics. Mar Timotheus is a keen Nationalist and an ardent Nestorian. He is very much opposed to foreign missions among the Nestorians, and attributes, probably with a degree of truth, the misfortunes of the Assyrian people to the misplaced activities of foreign Consuls and Missions. He is also anxious to abolish the hereditary nature of the Assyrian hierarchy and make it elective. In the light of a reformer he considers the boy Patriarch to be both uneconomical and irregular, and has shown his disapproval by marked hostility to the present Mar Shimun.341 Mar Timotheus visited Europe and the United States of America, and attended the 1925 Annual Session of the League of Nations as an unofficial delegate. A man of nervous tempera ment and at times gives the impression of being slightly un balanced. Until his consecration as Bishop, was known under the name of Awimelik Kalaita. Ubaidullah s/o Shaikh Muhammad, Shaikh. Aqra district. His mother was a Zibari woman. Principal Shaikh of the Surchi and leader of the unruly part of the tribe. An intruder on the left bank of the Zab. Brother of Shaikh Qayun and Shaikh Badi’, and a half-brother of Shaikh Raqib and Shaikh Waji. Combines both spiritual and temporal authority ; lives at Bajil where he had a strong castle. Oppressive landlord, avaricious and was very rich ; miserly, obstinate, and with a natural dislike to any Government. Although the elder son, his brother Shaikh Badi’, was nominated by his father to rule in Bajil and carry on the good work of the Shrine, which was a prominent feature in Shaikh Muhammad’s time; Ubaidullah proved the stronger, and after many quarrels Badi’ left Bajil for Dobi, where he now lives. Thenceforth the Bajil Shrine fell into ruins, and the yearly revenues collected from five or six waqf villages were appropriated by Ubaidullah. At the time of the Zibari raid on Aqra, a few of the Surchi joined in the looting but did not rise. In January, 1920, Paris Agha tried to get them to attack Aqra, but aeroplane action drove him from Bajil. In March, however, Raqib attacked and destroyed a convoy. Ubaidullah refused to come to see the A.P.O., Aqra, and eventually the whole of the Surchi rose and made a serious attack on Aqra. Ubaidullah himself was seriously wounded by a bomb in March, and in April Bajil was reduced to a heap of ruins by our troops. Thence forward, in spite of much intrigue, the Surchi were more or less quiescent until September, 1920, when Nuri Bawil, of the Arbil Liwa, an outlaw, persuaded the Surchi of Aqra and the Dasht-i- Harir to rise. They captured Batas and Rowanduz and for some time threatened Arbil (the Khushnao having also risen). Foiled by the arrival of troops at Arbil, they crossed the Zab and, carrying with them a few Ashair al Saba villages, attacked the Assyrian refugee camp at Jujar. Reinforcements arriving, they were counter-attacked and pushed over the Zab with considerable loss. In November, 1920, Ubaidullah sued for terms, but suddenly broke off negotiations. Together with Raqib and Taufiq he was bombed in May, 1921. Made submission in September, 1921 ; but, on receipt of false news from a Turkish source in Arbil that he was going to be imprisoned, he treacherously attacked the Levy and police post at Babachichik in December, 1921. On the appearance of the Turkish officer, Ramzi, at Rowanduz in June, 1922, he and Raqib took refuge there ; and he alone declined to come in until we hadreoccupied Rowanduz, when he asked for terms and was told he must give himself up unconditionally. This he did, and having paid a fine of rifles, his submission was accepted. Since those days his power, wealth and influence in the Aqra neighbourhood have been very much reduced. Villages which he had usurped have been returned to their rightful owners. His power over the Surchi, however, is still considerable. Ubaidullah himself is of small stature and an unpleasant foxy- looking individual. Has six sons :— 1. Muhammad Sadiq (disinherited). 2. Shaikh Mazzo. 3. Taufiq Agha. 4. ’Ataullah. 5. Kashu. 6. Babo. Of these Mazzo is the most influential. Although Shaikh Ubaidullah has been comparatively quiet for some years he is thoroughly untrustworthy, and both he and his tribe must always be reckoned as potentially active enemies of the Government. [See genealogical tree of the Surchi, page 344). Uliya Beg —see Walia Beg. Umar Khan (Shikak). A chief of the Shikak, who was made paramount leader of the tribe on Simko’s deposition by the Persian Government in 1923. Consequently a great enemy of Simko, of whom he is also a relative. Keeps in touch with the Turkish authorities in the Van and Hakkiari provinces. Umar Khan has nothing like the hold which Simko had over his tribesmen. Umar s/o Tamar Agha. A leading Agha of Batwan, north of Jazirat-ibn-Omar. Was one of the signatories of a letter to King Faisal in 1921 asking for inclusion in Traq. Is alleged to have taken part in the 1925 Kurdish rebellion, for which he was arrested. Reported to have been hanged at Diarbekr in the summer of 1926. Walia Beg. Agha of Chal. During the War his lands were laid waste by the Assyrians, and he was held to ransom by the Tiari and Tkhuma after their breakaway from the repatriation movement of 1920. Is said to be a well-educated man and was formerly Murdir of Chal under the Turks. The Assyrians say that it was at his suggestion that Bekr Lufti Bey, the Wali of Julamerk, made his journey to Tkhuma in 1924, when he was attacked and captured by the tribesmen. The subsequent punitive operations and flight of the Assyrian tribes gave the Agha of Chal his revenge.Yawalaha, Mar. The hereditary title of the Nestorian Bishop of Barwari, now held by Yalda of Barwari. Consecrated as a very young man just before the War. An amorous hot-head, who subsequently became entangled in an intrigue with the daughter-in-law of Mr. Nisan, and fled to America. Returned to Barwari-Bala, and is now living in the village of Duri. He is dark, speaks English, and appears weak and ineffective as a bishop. Like Mar Sergis of Jilu, is courageous in warfare and delights in leading his people in a fight.ZIBARI TRIBE.349 APPENDIX No. I. BIBLIOGRAPHY. Official Publications.

Area 9 covers the region of central Kurdistan and is divided into chapters on history, population, political geography, physical geography, climate, communications, resources, tribes, aviation, and personalities. The volume also contains numerous maps of important Kurdish cities and towns, as well as two maps of Area 9. The content of the chapters is dominated by information meant to be useful to military units and therefore contains detailed statistics on the military preparedness of both native populations and Turkish forces in the region.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Demographic statistics</topic></subject><subject><topic>Indigenous populations</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Kurdistan</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Military intelligence</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000239.0x000166#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
