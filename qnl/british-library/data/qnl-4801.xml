The Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman lie between the parallels of 22° and 30° N. and the meridians of 48° and 62° E. They are bounded on the south and south-west by the coastal districts of Arabia, at the head of the Gulf by Turkish Irak, and on the north west by the coastal regions of south-western Persia. The Persian Gulf proper extends in a south-east direction for 460 miles from the mouth of the Shatt el-'Arab to the coast of the promontory of Oman. 1 Here a projection of the Arabian coast, which turns north-east as far as Cape Musandam, narrows the entrance of the Gulf through the straits of Hormuz to a width of 29 miles. The Gulf has an average width of about 120 miles. The Gulf of Oman may be said to bean arm of the Indian Ocean, or Arabian Sea, which forms the approach to the Persian Gulf proper. The outer limit may be taken as a line joining Gwatar in Persian Makran to Ras el-Hadd on the Arabian coast; at its inner end it joins the Persian Gulf proper through the straits of Hormuz. The coastal regions of the Gulf fall naturally into three groups: 1. On the Arabian side, the region which adjoins the south and south-west shores of the Gulf proper, from the Khor Zobeir on the north as far as the entrance at Cape Musandam. and thence along the projecting butt of the Arabian continent as far as Ras el-Hadd, contains a group of sheikhdoms and emirates, the boundaries of which are not usually clearly defined. It includes Koweit, Hasa, 1 The term 1 promontory of Oman ' is used to describe that great projection of the Arabian coast of which the point nearly blocks the entrance of the Persian Gulf, and of which the base is a line running from Abu Dhabi town to the liaraimi oasis and thence to the town of Sohar, A 24 PERSIAN GULF Qatar, Trucial Oman, and a considerable part of the sultanate of Oman, all of which maintain special relations with the British Government. 2. At the head of the Gulf proper the coast of the alluvial plains of Mesopotamia and Arabistan an(l a part of Behbehan, from the Khor Zobeir in the west to a point near Bandar Dilam in the east and the districts inland as far as Basra and Ahwaz. This includes Turkish territory now in British occupation along the lower Shatt el-^Arab, the Persian province of Southern Arabistan under the hereditary government of the Sheikh of Mohammareh. 3. On the Persian side the narrow coastal plain which lies between the shores of the Gulf and the main maritime range of the mountains from Bandar Dllam on the north to the frontier of Baluchistan at Gwatar, together with the mountainous hinterland forming the south side of the Iranian plateau. These comprise the maritime districts of the Persian province of Fars and Laristan, and include the administrative districts which are under the governor of the Persian coast and islands, and the coastal district of the province of Persian Makran. The importance of the Persian Gulf lies principally in its relation to international communications. The head of the Gulf affords the natural outlet on the sea to the shortest route from central and southern Europe to India., while at the same time the whole of the Gulf region lies adjacent to the flank of an advance through Persia in a similar direction. Through the Persian Gulf lie the main trade routes to southern, central, and western Persia from India and Great Britain, via the Gulf ports, Mohammareh and Basra, and Baghdad, and with the development of Mesopotamia and of the Gulf oil-fields its importance will be increased. Surface, Coasts and Islands, River Systems persian gulf pkoper Surface The Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman occupy the southern part of a great depression lying between the plateau of Arabia and the plateau of Iran, of which Mesopotamia forms the northern part. The Euphrates and Tigris have, within historical times, silted up their mouths to an extent that has materially altered the coast-line of the Gulf, and they seem destined in the future to unite Hasa to Fars, just as in the past they have produced the fertile plain ofSURFACE, COASTS AND ISLANDS, RIVER SYSTEMS 5 Mesopotamia. The depression is bounded for about two-thirds of its length, along- the Persian littoral and the coast of Oman, by mountain ranges having elevations of as much as 10,000 ft. in places. These ranges on the Persian side run in an extraordinarily constant direction from north-west to south-east as far as the straits of Ilormuz, where they bear eastwards and run in that direction along the coast of Baluchistan and Sind. The south-east side of the depression is similarly bounded by the mountains of Oman. In places the mountains run steeply down to the sea, but there is usually a narrow coastal plain or flat intervening. The sea-bottom of the Persian Gulf proper, outside the areas affected by recent coral reefs, is flat and gently undulating, and the depth exceeds 60 fathoms only over a small part of the area. On the Persian side, where the coast is mountainous, the water is deeper than on the Arabian side, where the coast is flat. On this side reefs and shoals extend into the Gulf for a distance of from 30 to 50 miles along almost the entire length. The sea-floor of the Gulf of Oman lies very much lower than that of the Persian Gulf proper. This is especially the case where the mountains directly adjoin the sea, as at Musandam peninsula and its long narrow inlets. Near this coast the depth of the water is about 60 fathoms. About 50 miles from Musandam it drops to 150 fathoms, thus forming a wide shelf which follows also the coast of Makran. Islands Rising from the floor of the Gulf proper and above its general level are various isolated eminences which manifest themselves in the numerous islands dotting the expanse of the Gulf. Many of the islands are at least partly of volcanic origin. The two largest are Qishm, which lies off the Persian coast and just within the entrance to the Gulf, and Bahrein off the Arabian coast. (For surface of Qishm and Bahrein, see below, pp. 10 and 24.) The Persian Gulf is lacking in good harbours, the anchorages being for the most part shallow and exposed. arabian coastal region Surface The Arabian coastal region occupies the lowest portion of the long and gradual decline which takes place between the central Arabian plateau and the shores of the Persian Gulf. The general6 PERSIAN GULF slope is broken only by the mountainous district of Oman, which lies in the extreme south-east. The region is bordered on the west by the Dahanah, a hard gravelly plain crossed at intervals by sand belts of varying width. This runs in a south-east direction in a continuous belt and joins east of Oman the enormous block of south Arabian desert known as the Ruba^ el-Khali, which forms the back ground to the whole region. For purposes of description the coastal region may be divided into two parts : (1) the district in the north west which extends along the shores of the Gulf proper from Turkish Irak in the north to the foot of the promontory of Oman at Abu Dhabi; (2) the district in the south-east which includes the promontory of Oman, and thence is a part of the sultanate of Oman as far as the Has el-Hadd. 1. This part of the region, which contains the sultanate of Koweit, the province of Hasa, the promontory of Qatar, and part of Trucial Oman, is either flat or slightly undulating plains, of which the surface is broken only by low outcrops of sandstone or occasional isolated hills. In the interior, west of Hasa, there is a certain amount of continuous high ground, where stony ridges, which run parallel to the coast, intervene between I lasa and the desert. With the exception of certain fertile tracts enumerated below, the region consists for the most part of steppe or desert, parts of which support a scanty vegetation with a certain amount of grazing. For about one-third of the length of the Gulf proper, from Koweit as far as Qatlf, both coastal district and hinterland are almost continuous steppe desert. The sultanate of Koweit extends along the coast from the frontier of Turkish Irak for 190 miles, as far as the boundaries of the pro vince of Ilasa—its maximum breadth is about 160 miles; the effective rule of the Sultan, however, extends for only about a day^s journey from the coast. The soil north of Koweit Bay is gravelly, farther south it is part sand and part clay, and there is only a small patch of fertile soil. There is no running water in the principality with the exception of one small stream. Wells as a rule are 20 ft. deep. Next to Koweit, and adjoining its south frontier, the province of Hasa runs for 300 miles along the coast, as far as the promontory of Qatar, with an average breadth of about 50 miles. With the exception of the two fertile oasis districts of Hasa and Qatif the province of Hasa is a region of sandy or earthy steppe, with, in places, many low white sand-hills. It contains numerous shallowSURFACE, COASTS AND ISLANDS, RIVER SYSTEMS 7 wells of drinkable water, and water is obtainable as a rule a few feet below the surface. There is a fair amount of grazing, and in places there is scrub in profusion. There are occasional depressions in which date-palms and other bushes show the presence of water. In the north there are saline and nitrous depressions. The promontory of Qatar is little known, but is described as a rocky and pebbly desert; the soil is poor, consisting in the better, districts of gravel and marl mixed with sand; the only vegetation is coarse grass mixed with a certain amount of low brushwood, and water is found below the surface without much difficulty. Trucial Oman consists of a group of sultanates which extend along the coast for 300 miles from the foot of the promontory of Qatar to the Ras el-Jebel (or Ru'us-el-Jibal) at the north of the pro montory of Oman. It is a low and sandy maritime plain unsuited for tillage, but not without natural vegetation and even wood; inland plains contain tracts with occasional cultivation. There are enough well- and water-holes to support a scanty Bedouin population. Fertile districts in this region are found in the neighbourhood of springs and wadi mouths. The principal fertile districts are : (i) A small district of cultivated soil in the neighbourhood of Jahrah close to the foot of the Bay of Koweit and about 20 miles from Koweit town. This contains most of the cultivation in the sultanate. (ii) The two important oasis districts of Hasa and Qatif, which form the settled part of the province of Hasa. The oasis of Ilasa is a district which contains cultivated areas of great fertility; the remainder for the most part is barren. It extends for about 30 miles north and south, and 20 miles east and west, and is separated from the Gulf at J Oqair by 16 miles ot desolate country consisting of a tumbled mass of sand ridges. 1 he remainder is for the most part barren. There are extensive date-groves in the fertile parts of the district; a number of springs, all warm and some hot, saturate the land in some parts and permit of an elaborate system of irrigation for rice. The important town of Hofuf, capital of the province of Ilasa, is situated in this district in the south-east corner of the cultivated area. The Qatif oasis is situated on the coast north-east of the oasis of Hasa. Its length from north to south is 18 miles, with an average breath of 3 miles, the town of Qatif lying in the middle. Most of the area consists of a sandy plain saturated by spring water.8 PERSIAN GULF The cultivated tract ends 6 miles south of the town^ but, as in Hasa, there are detached blocks of cultivated ground. (iii) The Wadi el-Miyah is a long valley or depression in the extreme north of the province of Hasa. It contains numerous wells and springs. It has a dark brown cultivable soil, and in spring grass is abundant. (iv) Farther south in Trucial Oman there are small spots of fertility at rare wadi mouths. 2. The district in the south-east of the Arabian coastal region contains the most important part of the sultanate of Oman as well as a part of Trucial Oman, and independent Onuin in the interior. The most important physical feature is the range of mountains or hilly tract which, commencing at Has Musandam, the entrance of the Persian Gulf, sweeps round in a curve parallel to the coast as far as Has el-Hadd, the point which divides the Gulf of Oman from the Indian Ocean. The range of which the northernmost part is the mountainous district of Has el-Jebel is known as the Hajar of Oman. It is cut into two parts, eastern and western Hajar, by the great cleft known as the Wadi Sema'il, and reaches, in the lofty Jebel Akhdar, summits approaching 10,000 ft. The rocks are mainly of limestone, but around Maskat there is an outcrop of volcanic ser pentine which extends for about 10 miles along the coast. Igneous rocks are found also on the coast in the neighbourhood of Sur, a few miles west of the south-east extremity of the district, and in a few places inland. Along the Trucial coast of the promontory of Oman there is a wide and sandy maritime plain. Farther north, in the moun tainous district of Has el-Jebel, the mountains fall steeply into the sea on both sides of the promontory. On the southern side of the promontory the long and narrow coastal plain of Batinah inter venes between the mountains and the coast for a distance of 150 miles. The plain is from 10 to 20 miles wide with clayey soil, which becomes sandy near the sea. In the neighbourhood of Maskat the coast is again mountainous and steep, and east of this the hilly district of eastern Hajar conies close to the sea, and there is no continuous coastal plain. Inland of the mountain range in the north-west the Dhahirah district extends for a distance of about 100 miles. It is a plain of uneven surface which slopes down from the foothills of Hajar to the Ruba' el-Khali, in which its drainage is lost; the hills which diversify its surface are outliers of Hajar, with sparse growth of mimosa and acacia. South-east ofSURFACE, COASTS AND ISLANDS, RIVER SYSTEMS 9 this, Oman proper consists of a central plateau shut in on the north by Jebel Akhdar and on the south by the desert; the surface of this, outside the oasis, is rough and broken ; the central portion is a stony plain thickly dotted with small volcanic hills and mounds. The district in the south has a wide and level surface, sprinkled with dwarf mimosa and bunches of desert grass. Inland of eastern Hajar are sandy plains and a network of small valleys, with cultivation where the land is watered by streams which run down from the hills. Fertile districts in the south-east coastal region: (i) Parts of Batinah coastal plain are very fertile, and date-groves extend along it for many miles. The Batinah plain is crossed by many watercourses, but the irrigation is entirely from wells. (ii) South-west of Maskat, in the Wadi Sema'il district, there are a number of date-groves. (iii) In addition to these there are inland districts which are situated under the main chain of Jebel Akhdar and its coastal continuation towards Ras el-Hadd, and also in the Dhahirah country. To the north of these districts are rich valleys and broad oasis tracts. Coast and Islands The Arabian coast, with which is included the Trucial and Pirate coasts, and in the Gulf of Oman the Batinah coast, runs in a south east direction from the Turkish frontier at the head of the Gulf to Ras el-Hadd. The general trend of the coast is interrupted by the promontory of Qatar, a tongue of land which projects northwards from the coast about midway between the head of the Gulf and its entrance through the straits of Hormuz, and forms the eastern side of the Gulf of Bahrein, and to a still greater degree by the promontory of Oman, which runs north-east from Abu Dhabi to Cape Musandam before turning south-east again to Ras el-Hadd. 1. The coast-line of the Persian Gulf proper as far as the foot of the promontory of Oman is indented with a number of bays. The coast is low, and reefs and shoals extend from 30 to 50 miles off it, for nearly the whole of its length, making it difficult and dangerous to approach. Koweit and Bahrein are the only good harbours on this part of the coast. The coast is barren and desolate, and a great part of it has the appearance of a desert of white sand, with occasional rocky hills of moderate height, on which grow tufts of coarse grass. There are date-trees near the few towns. The A 310 PERSIAN GULF great reef which commences about 70 miles south of Koweit extends along the south-east and south shore to the extreme south of the Gull' proper, and forms a labyrinth of reefs, especially in the Gulf of Bahrein and between Qatar and Abu Dhabi. There are numerous small islands, which are usually fringed with a reef and uninhabited. The only island of importance is Bahrein, ihis forms the centre of the archipelago which constitutes the princi pality of Bahrein. The island has an extreme length of 30 miles from north to south, and a maximum breadth of 10 miles. It con sists mainly of a stony plateau from 100 to 150 ft. high. The coast is low ; alonff the north coast there is a belt of fertile land irom two to three miles wide, which is covered with date plantations; the remainder of the island is uncultivated owing to want of water. Ports The Bay of Koweit affords the only good anchorage for large vessels on this coast, with the exception of Bahrein. 1 he ba^ itself is a large inlet leading out of the north-west corner of the Persian Gulf; it is 20 miles long east and west, and 10 miles wide; in the greater part of the bay there is anchorage with good holding ground. The depths in the harbour are from 16 fathoms to 4^ fathoms, shoaling to 4 fathoms at the narrows at its head ; vessels drawing over 20 ft. have to anchor two miles from the town. Although Koweit is connected by caravan routes with the interior of Arabia, the principal stream of trade in that direction passes through Manumah, the port of Bahrein, whence it flows in native craft to minor ports of the Arabian coast, notably 'Oqair and Qatli. From these ports caravan routes go to Hcfuf, the principal town of the Hasa oasis, and thence to Nejd and the interior generally. Manamah, or Bahrein, is situated at the extreme north of the island of Bahrein. The harbour is sheltered by the island of Muharraq on the south and east, and by the Fasht el-ltarim to the northward. The latter island does not prevent a consider able sea getting up in the outer harbour during a strong shamdl (north-west wind), but vessels ride easily at anchor. The inner harbour, which is really a bight in the reefs, is about a mile in extent; it is chiefly used by hagala (dhows), and vessels of more than 15 ft. should not enter it. For ships approaching the outer anchorage the least depth of water is 21 ft. Anchorage for large vessels is in from 20 to 30 ft. of water. Vessels drawing over 20 ft. lie just over three miles from the shore.SURFACE, COASTS AND ISLANDS, RIVER SYSTEMS 11 The port of 'Oqair is situated on the Arabian coast about 24 miles west-south-west of the south extremity of Bahrein island. The harbour, which seems capable of improvement, has an entrance 200 to 300 yards wide; the channel and a part of the bay are from 3 to 4 fathoms deep ; the sea without is shallower in places and dangerous for ships. Qatif, situated in the oasis of Qatif, is an important coast town which is 36 miles north-west by west from the nearest part of Bahrein island, and 64 miles north-west of ^Oqair. It shares with 'Oqair a considerable part of the trade with the interior of Arabia. It has great defects as a port; boats of over 7 ft. draught cannot reach the town. Larger vessels anchor 10 miles north-east of Qatif, just within Ras Tanurah, where there is a depth of from 5 to 6^ fathoms a quarter to half a mile off the shore. The port of Bida', sometimes known as Dohah, is situated on the east side of the promontory of Qatar ; it is connected by caravan route with Hofuf and the interior. It is a natural harbour 3^ miles long by 2 miles broad. The approach to the harbour is obstructed by reefs and shoals at a depth of from 2^ to 3 fathoms. The greater part of the harbour has from 4^ to 5 fathoms depth, with anchorage of mud and clay. 2. With the exception of the Ras el-Jebel district (see below, p. 12), the coast of the promontory of Oman and of the sultanate as far as Ras el-IIadd has few bays or indentations ; a great part of it is mountainous and bold, especially in the Ras el-Jebel district, on the east side of which the mountains form precipitous cliffs broken in places by small sandy bays. The coast round Maskat is also rugged and steep in places, and east of this foothills of the mountains adjoin the coast. For the rest the coast is low and sandy. The coast to south-west of the promontory of Oman, which forms part of Trucial Oman, is a low and sandy desert, while the coast of Batinah is sandy, and fringed for many miles with date- groves. On the part of the Trucial coast described above the water is shallow, though free from reefs, but the coast is open and exposed to the sharndl (north-west wind). There is as a rule a heavy surf along this coast on both sides of the promontory. There is deep water along the shores of the Gulf of Oman. The coast is deficient in good harbours. There are anchorages in the Bays of Maskat and Matrah, but both are imperfectly sheltered, the former from the north-west, the latter from the north-east winds; there is a good shelter in the Khor Fakan. Maskat harbour is completely A 412 PERSIAN GULF surrounded by a wall of mountains which cut it off from the interior. Goods from Maskat are transhipped and sent to Mat rah, whence run caravan routes to the interior. The importance of Maskat as a distributing centre is affected by the development of Sur, which lies 94 miles south-east from it on the same coast, and Dibai on the coast of Trucial Oman. Sur is an important coastal town second only to Matrah on this coast j it has an open anchorage in from 8 to 11 fathoms. Dibai is a small but growing port which supplies goods to the interior of the Oman promontory and to the Baraimi oasis district; there is an anchorage in 5 fathoms but no shelter from the north-west wind. The mountainous district of Ras el-Jebel is indented on both sides of the promontory with numerous deep water inlets ; of these, two, which are known as Malcolm and Elphinstone inlets, form fine natural harbours with 14 to 20 fathoms depth; the winds in these are baffling, and the heat in summer almost intolerable. River Systems There are no rivers in Arabia which flow perennially from source to mouth in this or any region. There are, however, in Hasa and Oman, as in other parts of the country, watercourses (tvddis) which carry floods after rain-storms. Those which originate east of the western watershed, many of which pass through this region, are mostly long and shallow, their bottoms being very little depressed below the general level. These wadis carry water beneath their beds, which can be reached by wells at varying depth; they also provide 'possible means of communication, and where the ground moisture rises near or to their surface they create chains of oases. The numerous streams, springs, and ponds which water the oases of Hasa and Qatlf are said to form a part of the drainage of central Arabia which has passed the Dahanah underground. the coastal region of irak and southern arab1stan Surface The coastal region at the head of the Persian Gulf lies between the north-east corner of the Arabian desert and the south-west edge of the Persian plateau. The country consists of the alluvial plains of Turkish Irak and of Southern Arabistan, although the coast of the former touches the sea on a narrow front only, between the mouthSURFACE, COASTS AND ISLANDS, RIVER SYSTEMS 13 of the Khor Zobeir and the Shatt el-'Arab. The district extends along the coast from the Khor Zobeir, which is the boundary between the sultanate of Koweit and Turkish Irak, to a point between the mouth of the Hindlyan river and Bandar Dilam, a distance of about 130 miles. The plains are featureless, and the surface is broken only in Arabistan, in the east and north of the Hindiyan district, where there is a considerable hilly tract, and in the Ahwaz district, where a range of hills of red Tertiary sandstone about 30 miles in length rises to a height of 200 ft. above the plain; this range is pierced by the Karun river at Ahwaz; with the exception of certain highly cultivated areas enumerated below, the plains are barren or thinly covered with desert scrub; in some parts there are saline tracts. A considerable part of the plains is in spring covered with grass, and the soil is probably fertile as a rule when the water can be brought to it. Large areas of the country are completely covered with swamp, especially in the Pellahiyeh and Hawlzeh districts of Arabistan and on the Turkish side of the Khor Zobeir. Fertile areas are: 1. The banks of the Shatt el-'Arab, where between Basra and Mohammareh the date-groves are practically continuous on both sides of the river and have a depth inland of from half a mile to two miles. On the right bank below Mohammareh there is generally a fine palm belt. 2. Considerable tracts of irrigated land in the FellahTyeh and Hawlzeh districts which are watered by the lower courses of the Jerrahi and the Karkeh rivers. 3. There is a certain amount of land irrigated by the IlindTyan river. The Karan is used for irrigation purposes only on a very small scale at present; belts of tamarisk and willow and other bushes fringe the banks of the rivers, but as a rule there are no large trees. Coasts and Islands The coast of the alluvial plain at the head of the Gulf is low and marshy, liable to flood, and fringed with flat mud-banks, which have been formed by silt brought down by the Shatt el-'Arab and other rivers. Some of these mud-banks are only partially dry at low water. A considerable part of this coast which is covered at high water has not yet been traced. 1 he14 PERSIAN GULF head of the Gulf seems to be gradually silting up, and the delta is being extended into the sea more rapidly than any known delta—according to one authority the delta now advances a mile in seventy years. Shallows and mud-flats make the coast difficult to approach. The two large banks, Marakat Abbadan and Marakat Abdullah, through which passes the channel to the Shatt el-'Arab, may be said to be under-water prolongations of the mainland. The most important indentation on the coast is the entrance to the Shatt el-'Arab. Besides the river mouth there are numerous deep creeks, of which the most important are the Khor Musa, a large inlet of which the mouth is about 36 miles east of Shatt el-'Arab, and the Khor Zobeir. In the Khor Musa there is a good natural anchorage, but the bar would require dredging to admit vessels of a large size. The Khor Zobeir, which runs up into the desert towards Basra, has fairly deep water, but its approaches make it unsuitable for use as a harbour. With these exceptions there are no natural harbours in this district, although there is an anchorage for small vessels at Bandar Dilam. Bubayan is a large low island about 26 miles in length by 12 in breadth, situated on the north-west corner of the Persian Gulf. It is divided from the mouth of the Shatt el-'Arab by the Khor Abdullah, and from the possessions of the Sheikh of Koweit by the Khor es-Sabiyah. The island is barren and destitute of fresh water; parts of it are at times submerged by the sea. Other islands at the head of the Gulf are little more than mud-banks. The strip of land which lies between the Shatt el-'Arab and the Haffar and Bahmanshir channels of the Karun, which is sometimes called Abbadan island, may be considered as part of the mainland. Ports The two ports of the district, Basra and Mohammareh, are both situated on the Shatt el-'Arab. The port of Basra is situated under the right bank of the Shatt el-'Arab, 70 miles from the outer bar at the river mouth, and 539 from Baghdad. Basra is the chief port of extensive districts, of which Baghdad in Turkey and Kirmanshah in Persia are the trade centres; it is the port of shipment for the date and grain trades of Mesopotamia. As the terminus of the Baghdad Railway it seems likely to play a most important part in the future economic development of the Persian Gulf region. There is an anchorage in mid-channel in Basra reach for a considerableSURFACE, COASTS AND ISLANDS, RIVER SYSTEMS 15 number of ships in from 5^ to 8 fathoms. At Maghil, 5 miles above Basra, there is a long strip of foreshore with deep water close to the bank, and here there are facilities for two miles of of deep-water wharves. If improvement in the navigation of the Shatt el-'Arab were effected, Basra would quickly take its place as a first-rate port. Mohammareh is situated about 16 miles below Basra, close to the junction of the Karun river (through the Haffar channel) with &lt; the Shatt el-'Arab. Large steamers which cannot swing in the Haffar channel anchor near the left bank of the Shatt el-'Arab. The port of Mohammareh owes its importance partly to its position at the mouth of the KarQn, through which a considerable trade to Persia at present passes, and partly to the fact that the refineries of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are situated close by. If land transit from Persia via Ahwaz to Basra should take the place of river transit, it seems unlikely that the port will develop further to any great extent. River Systems The most important feature of the district at the head of the Persian Gulf is the river Shatt el-'Arab, through which the united waters of the Tigris, the Euphrates, and the Ivarun find a common outlet to the sea. The Shatt el-'Arab forms a main line of communication through which passes a large section of the trade of Mesopotamia and central and western Persia. I he drainage from the west and south-west sides of the Persian plateau is carried by the rivers Tigris and Karun, as well as less important rivers of the district, the Jerrahi, IlindTyan, and Karkeh. I he Shatt el-'Arab river is formed by the confluence of the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates, which unite at Kuma, about 125 miles from the bar at the mouth of the river; it is joined at Moham mareh, 48 miles from the river mouth, by the greater part of the waters of the Karun. The width of the river at its mouth is 11 m ile. The land is very low on both sides of the entrance. Below Mohammareh the river is rich in silt contributed largely by the Karun. The waters of the river serve to irrigate through numerous channels and distributaries the extensive date-groves which line its banks almost continuously, especially on the Turkish side, to a depth of from half a mile to two miles inland. The chief obstacle to the navigation of the Shatt el- Arab is the outer bar at the mouth of the river, which is formed by broad flats16 PERSIAN GULF composed of mud and silt of a width of 25,000 ft.; a smaller bar forms in the river at certain seasons in the neighbourhood ol' Mohammareh. With these exceptions there are no obstacles to navigation, and the river can be ascended as far as Basra, a distance of 70 miles from the outer bar buoy, by any vessels which can cross the bar—that is, at spring tides up to 20 ft. draught, at other times up to 17-18 ft. only. The Shatt el-'Arab is wide, with a depth at low-w;iter spring tides of 30 to 40 ft.; there are no very awkward bends or turns. The river is navigable as far as Kurna by vessels of 15 ft. draught. In order to give satisfactory access to the port of Basra the bars at the mouth of the Shatt el- Arab and below Mohammareh must be removed and the channel kept clear; it is said that this work would not present any great engineering difficulties. The Tigris river has so far deteriorated through systematic abstraction of its waters for canals and irrigation ditches that its usefulness for purposes of navigation has been seriously impaired; it forms, however, an important avenue of commerce to Baghdad and thence to Persia. The river between Basra and Baghdad is practicable throughout the year for suitable steamers drawing 4 ft.; there are numerous * bunds' and shoal patches encountered throughout the route, which interfere seriously with navigation when the water is low. The volume of water in the Tigris varies considerably during the year; the low-water season lasts from July to November, the high-water from December to June. It seems probable that the navigation of the Tigris can be con siderably improved. The Karun is the largest and only navigable river in Persia; it rises in the mountains in the Bakhtiyari country, about 100 miles west of Isfahan. After winding through deep valleys and mountain gorges it emerges from the hills above Shushtar and then Hows west through the plain of Arabistan; it breaks through the line of sandstone hills at Ahwaz in a series of rapids; from that point it winds through the alluvial flats of Southern Arabistan for a further distance of 115 miles. The main volume of the water of the KarQn flows through the Haffar channel into the Shatt el-'Arab at Mohammareh, the remainder flows through the Bahmanshir channel, and reaches the sea about twelve miles west of the entrance to the Shatt el-^Arab. The Karan, which when full carries a brown silt, is not at present utilized for irrigation purposes except on a small scale; it is navigable as far as AhwazSURFACE, COASTS AND ISLANDS, RIVER SYSTEMS 17 by river steamers of 2 ft. draught at any time, and of 5 ft. draught when the river is high. The seasonal variations of the volume of the waters in the Karun follow the same general course as those of the Tigris, but it is more subject than they are to sudden irregular rises. The rapids near Ahwaz are practically unnavigable; above them navigation is again possible to within a few miles of Shushtar. The Bahmanshlr channel can be navigated by vessels of 7 ft. draught up to 30 miles from the sea. It is said that the Karun is not capable of material improvement for navigation purposes except at prohibitive cost, and that in the low-water season the water could be more profitably used for irrigation purposes. The Jerrahi is formed in the Ramuz district of Arabistan; it flows into the Fellahiyeh district, where it is mostly carried off by canals for irrigation purposes. Lands watered by the Jerrahi are among the most fertile and productive in Arabistan. The remnants of the stream become the Fellahiyeh-Marid canal. The Hindiyan is formed by the junction of the two streams which rise in the Persian hills between Behbehan and Shlraz. The river reaches the Gulf about 30 miles east of the Khor Musa through mud-flats; there is a bar of soft clay at the river mouth. The Hindlyan in its upper reaches flows through several channels and is made use of to a considerable extent for irrigation purposes. The depth of water at the bar is not less than 3 ft., and above that 6 ft., and it can be ascended by native craft as far as the town of Hindiyan, which is 16 miles north-west of the river mouth. The Karkeh river, which rises in the district north-west of Disful, enters the plain of Arabistan about 15 miles farther west than the Diz river, and waters large areas here and in the Hawizeh district. The waters of the Karkeh are dissipated in streams and marshes which have submerged and ruined the district. A certain amount of the water eventually finds its way through the marshes to the Tigris and Shatt el-'Arab. the persian littoral Surface The narrow coastal plain of south-western and southern Persia consists of belts of low land of varying width situated between the sea and a great maritime range of limestone which forms the southern rim of the Persian plateau. The plain extends along a 518 PERSIAN GULF the whole leng-ih of the coast from Bandar Dilam to the frontier of Baluchistan at Gwatar, with the exception of the coast between Kangun and 'Asalu, where the maritime ran&lt;*e may be said to fall directly into the sea, and here the plain is in abeyance. The width of the plain varies as a rule from 15 to 30 miles. In places as at Bushire, and a^ain between Bandar 'Abbas and. Minab at the entrance of the Gulf, the hills retreat with the effect of widening the maritime plain, which at Bushire attains a width of 45 miles. The width of the plain in the north increases to 60 miles. The surface of the plain is broken by a series of subsidiary coastal ridges and hills, which are either outliers of, or in some cases independent from, the maritime range. These ridges, which are usually of sand- , stope and absolutely barren, are from 1,000 to 3,000 ft. high; in places they skirt the coast and give the plain the character of a trough parallel to the fea; in other parts they divide it into three parts, inland valley, coastal ridge, and maritime strip; in such cases the inland valley is usually fertile. It has been sug gested that the ridges themselves may have been formed by the gradual elevation of the limestone range through a bed of super incumbent light sandstone. These coastal ridges contain large quantities of gypsum, and in places, as at Bustaneh and Khamir, there are deposits of sulphur. The soil of the plain is in a great part of the region a light loam of great fertility, with specially fertile alluvial districts at the foot of the hills, in the deltas of the Rud Hilleh and Minab rivers, on which Bushire and Bandar 'Abbas are situated respectively, and of the Mund river, and in the plains along the course of the rivers. Large quantities of cereals are grown in the plains; there is a good natural grazing in the hills between May and October, and the cattle are sent up there for this period. Behind the foreshore there are numerous date-groves. Along the coast there are extensive mud-flats, and there is a certain amount of saline desert or swamp bearing only coarse grass and tamarisk bushes. Mangroves are found in the swamps beyond Jask. t In Persian Makran the greater part of the coastal plain is a sandy waste impregnated with salt and seamed with lines of drainage, but in places there are patches of alluvial soil; the plain is here wider than on the coast of south-western Persia, and the formation of the coastal ridge and maritime plain less regular. Adjoining the coastal plain and in places actually abutting on % the coast is the south-west portion of the great Persian plateau.SURFACE, COASTS AND ISLANDS, RIVER SYSTEMS 19 This forms a mountain wall, which has to be ascended before the inland districts can be reached from the coast, ihe ascent from sea-level to the Persian plateau is almost everywhere accomplished by a series of sudden steps indicated by rugged and precipitous mountain ranges, formed of folded rocks belonging to many different ages. These ranges, which as a rule run parallel to the coast and to each other, overlook the littoral district in its entire length; they increase in height as they recede inland. The general trend of the ranges, which is from north-west to south-east, suggests easy com munications between the Mesopotamian depression and the intenur of the Iranian plateau. This method of approaching the plateau is, however, extremely difficult. The part of the main lange which adjoins the coastal plain is composed of masses of limestone which have a quaquaversal dip; it rises in places to a height of 5,000 ft. Inside the range and coextensive with it is a large trough divided into two parts by a watershed. Between the ranges are a series of alluvial plains; these are more or less broad and are in places fertile. They vary in length from 15 to 150 miles, and increase in altitude until the central plateau is reached. Farther inland, more especially in the province of Ears, the southern slopes of the mountains are generally fertile with very good grazing, or are terraced for vines or other cultivation. In some parts large trees and wild almonds grow above the 3,000-ft. line, and there are dwarf-oak forests. Elsewhere the mountain districts are bare and rocky. Coast The coast of the Persian littoral from Bandar Dilam to (nvatar includes the Dashtistan, Tangistan, and Shibkuh coasts in the Gulf proper, the Biyaban coast in the straits of Hormuz, and the coast of Persian Makran. The general trend of the coast is in a south east direction from the head of the Gult to the straits of Hormuz, and thence due east along Persian Makran. The Persian coast is comparatively free from bays or indentations, and is deHcient in good harbours and shelter generally : it presents to the sea a bold and mountainous appearance. The seaward face of the various sandstone ridges which occur in the coastal plain is rugged and precipitous, and absolutely barren. There is deep water as a rule fairly close to the shore. The coast is usually clear of outlying shoals; the only considerable shoal is the Ras ul-Mutaf, which lies off the Tangistan coast j this consists of sand on a rocky base and is dry for many miles. The actual coast-line, though bold and20 PERSIAN GULF rocky in places, is usually low and sandy, or merged in ill-defined mud-flats. The coast-line may be described as possessing three alternative characteristics : either it is low, rising 1 about 15 ft. above sea-level, or there are precipitous ranges rising about a mile inland, or there is much swampy ground. Ports and Hinterlands There are three principal ports on the Persian littoral from which the caravan routes ascend to the plateau and penetrate into the interior, viz. Bushire (leading to Shlraz and Isfahan), Bandar ^Abbas (for Yazd and Kirman), and Lingeh. 1 All of these are more or less inadequate and ill protected from prevailing winds. There are also a number of anchorages close inshore which afford shelter to small boats only. Bushire, which may be called the principal seaport of Persia, is situated at the north point of the Bushire peninsula, about 100 miles east-south-east of the mouth of the Shatt el-'Arab. The peninsula projects from the south into a large bay, the greater part of which is very shallow. The outer anchorage, in which the water is from 4 to 41 fathoms deep, is distant about 4^ miles from the shore and is open and exposed. The inner anchorage, situated in what may be called the entrance of the bay, lies 3 miles north-north-west of Bushire town ; the holding ground is good, but the anchorage is rough during the shamdl (north-west wind); it can be entered at any time, except when a shamdl is blowing, by vessels of draught up to 15-17 ft. It is said by some that to deepen this approach would be a costly operation, but this is disputed. The trade centres in the interior which are reached from Bushire are Shiraz and to some extent Isfahan. It is open to question whether Bushire could be converted into a convenient port except at disproportionate cost, and should alternative routes to the interior be developed its impor tance would be likely to be diminished. Bandar 'Abbas is situated on a bare and sandy plain on the mainland coast of the straits of Hormuz. The town is fronted by a flat about H mile broad with less than three fathoms of water. There is anchorage in 4j fathoms about three miles offshore; the chief drawbacks to Bandar 'Abbas as a port are the flat slope of the shore and lack of facilities for handling merchandise. The holding ground, however, is good, and the roadstead, which is well sheltered except from the south-east, affords anchorage to 1 N.B. The natural port of entry for Isfahan is Ahwaz.SURFACE, COASTS AND ISLANDS, RIVER SYSTEMS 21 a fair number o£ vessels. Bandar 'Abbas is the natural port of south-eastern Persia. It also provides the outlet for trade routes to the central tract between Herat and \azd, Meshed and Bampur, although the last two are also reached from ( hai'biir and Gwatar. From it there are possible routes to the interior giving 1 access to the Persian plateau which may prove of con siderable importance in the future. In the event of improved port facilities being required, it is open to question whether they can be provided at Bandar 'Abbas. There are said to be possibilities of a good commercial port at Bustaneh, about 18 miles to the west. The Clarence straits, which lie to the west of Bandar 'Abbas, narrow to three miles in width and contain good anchorage in deep water. Linseh is situated about 96 miles east-south-east of Bushire; there is a good anchorage in five fathoms of water at three-quarters of a mile from the beach with good holding on a clay bottom; it is exposed to south and south-east winds, which sometimes make com munication with the shore impossible. From Lingeh run caravan routes to Bastak, Lar, and Jahrum, but, although the roadstead has some advantages over Bushire and Bandar 'Abbas, its development is checked by the mountainous and arid nature of the hinterland. The trade formerly carried on from Lingeh with the Arabian coast and especially Trucial Oman has now been largely diverted to Dibai. Of the harbours in Persian Makran the most important is Charbar. The Bay of Charbar is 7| miles wide at the entrance by 10 miles in length. Charbar has the makings of a deep-water port, but the anchorage is exposed to the monsoon and is dangerous during that season. There is a depth of 4 fathoms at a distance of one mile offshore at Charbar town; the 5-fathom line is two miles from the beach. There is an important station of the Indo-European Tele graph Department at Jask; it is situated on a promontory about 140 miles south-east of Bandar 'Abbas and about 130 miles north-west of Maskat. There are anchorages suitable for steam vessels on both sides of the Jask promontory in which shelter can be found from all but south winds. Ships usually anchor H mile from the shore in the west bay; there is usually a very heavy surf on the beach. The 5-fathom line is nearly 3 miles from the shore in the west bay and two-thirds of a mile from the shore in the east bay. Gvvatar Bay is a great indentation on the Makran coast, at the point where Persian territory ends and Kalat (British Baluchistan)22 PERSIAN GULF begins; at the entrance the width is 19 miles, the depth about 11 miles. The whole of the bay is entirely open to the south, a considerable swell runs straight into the bay during the monsoon, and the sea breaks in 6 fathoms, rendering it unsafe to enter. From Gwatar there is a caravan route to Bampur which forms an easy line of approach to the plateau. The relation between the ports on the Persian coast and their corresponding trade centre on the Persian plateau is closely con cerned with the nature of the hinterland through which the routes which connect them must pass. The general trend of the mountain chains, which from the Turkish frontier to the straits of Ilormuz run parallel to the coast from north-west to south-east, makes a direct ascent to the plateau from any point between Bushire and Lingeh very difficult. Between Bushire and Shiraz are four ranges of mountains, and the p'^st road between these points, which con stitutes the shortest means of access to the plateau (to Shiraz and thence to Isfahan), is one of the steepest and most arduous routes in Persia. For the first 50 miles the route traverses a level plain which is liable to become heavy or impassable alter rain. Between that and Shiraz four difficult passes have to be crossed through rough and rocky defiles. Of these the highest is the Kutal-i-Pir Zan, which is 7,400 ft. high. The country crossed by the principal alternative route via FlrQzabad contains a series of passes of which the highest is the Muk, 6,600 ft.; none of these are as formidable as those on the post road. The Ahram and other rivers are difficult to cross in times of flood; these, however, occur but seldom. This approach to the plateau, which is to some extent in a transverse direction, is less difficult than the post road, and the same applies in a greater degree to a possible line of communication between Bushire and Jahrum and thence to Shiraz. Between Shiraz and Isfahan the altitude of the central plateau varies only from 5,000 to 8,000 ft., and there are no difficult obstacles to be surmounted. Towards Bandar ; Abbas the valleys between the ranges which form the outer rim of the plateau open out towards the coast, and there is a line of approach to the plateau towards the north-west in a direction parallel to the ranges, from Bandar 'Abbas to Shiraz via Lar and Jahrum. This route, which traverses a succession of fertile plains as well as mountain passes of no great difficulty, is usually made use of as a means of approach to Lar from the coast, in preference to that from Lingeh, which passes through country which presents numerous obstacles, passes and ravines, and is alsoSURFACE, COASTS AND ISLANDS, RIVER SYSTEMS 23 deficient in water. The country to the north of Bandar 'Abbas, through which pass the caravan routes to Kirman and Yazd, com prises a considerable area of the central plateau as well as the ranges which form its outer boundary. The ascent is considerably less arduous than that between Bushire and Shlraz, although the routes are considerably longer. Most of the routes pass through either the Tang-i-Zagh or the Tang-i-Zindan pass, which con stitute fairly formidable obstacles, and are situated in the south part of the route at distances of about 80 and 60 miles from Bandar 'Abbas respectively. Considerable areas of the country are salt and sterile and stony desert, with desolate ranges of hills and numerous ravines; some of the valleys, however, contain fertile soil. There are numerous rivers and fords to be crossed, some of which are at times difficult or impassable. The high mountain passes are blocked with snow in winter, but there is usually an alternative route available. North-east of the Bandar Abbas route there is a depression in the outer rim of the plateau where the boundary range begins to turn east instead of south-east; in this direction is easier country, through which passes the longer route to Kirman by way of Rigan. Only two passes present any difficulty on this route, which provides a fairly easy alignment for a cart- road or railway to the Persian plateau. The route from Gvvatar to Bampur by way of Sarbaz is said by an authority to be the best from the sea-coast to the plateau. There are no high passes with steep gradients ; a considerable part of this road, however, runs along stony river-beds, and three times a year when the Sarbaz river is in flood the way would be im passable for about a week. Islands There are several islands strewn along the Persian littoral, usually at a few miles distance from the coast. Included in these between Bandar Dilam and the outlet through the straits of Hormuz are the islands of Kharag, Shaikh Shu'aib, and Kais. These islands are low and rocky and fringed by reefs; they are all small. From Kharag large quantities of valuable building-stone are now being transported to Basra. Kharag and Kais have both at different times been in British occupation. The principal island on the Persian littoral is Qishm; this is situated in the straits of Hormuz and subtends the Persian coast from Lingeh almost to Bandar 'Abbiis; it is separated from the mainland by a channel known as Clarence straits.24 PERSIAN GULF The island of Qishm is 60 miles lonj* and 1 miles broad; it is nearly covered with table-topped hills of a light brown colour, with precipitous broken-down sides ; at one point a low plain extends for several miles inland. The highest point on Qishm reaches an elevation of 1,300 ft. The coast is generally rocky. There is an anchorage at the foot of Qishm for vessels of moderate draught in 5 fathoms about three-quarters of a mile from the shore; larger vessels anchor two miles off in 6 fathoms. The islands of Henjam and Larak, which lie to the south and east of Qishm, are barren and hilly; they may be regarded as being physically appendages of it. On the island of Henjam there is a British coaling station, and also a telegraph station. On the small island of Hormuz, which lies about 10 miles south-east of Bandar 'Abbas, was situated the once celebrated city of Ormuz, which has now disappeared. The island is barren and is composed chiefly of rock-salt, and there are large quantities of red oxide. River Systems Although the coastal plain is seamed by numerous valley lines, rivers in this region are few and unimportant; they dwindle at certain seasons of the year to a mere trickle ; at other times, and especially at the time of the melting of the snows, they increase considerably in volume and at times become impassable. Many of the rivers and streams are brackish and of no use for irrigation purposes. The river systems which have their origin in the hinterland of the Gulf proper run in a north- west-south-east direction, following the natural trend of the mountain districts, and find their way to the coast with difficulty; those of Persian Makran, where the mountain ranges are more interrupted, flow as a rule from north to south into the Arabian Sea. The only rivers in the district worthy of mention are the Mund, the Rud Hilleh, and the Minab. The Mund river, which rises in the neighbourhood of ShTraz, emerges from the hills in the Dashti district about 60 miles south of Bushire; at times it is not more than 3^ ft. deep, but after rain it discharges a large volume of water into the sea j the water is brackish. The Mund river is navigable for a short distance by small native craft. The small alluvial plains of Rud Hilleh and Minab, on which the ports of Bushire and Bandar ^Abbas are situated respectively, are formed by the rivers of that name. The Rud Hilleh river, which reaches the sea just north of Bushire, isSURFACE, COASTS AND ISLANDS, RIVER SYSTEMS 25 formed by the junction of two other streams, one sweet and the other brackish, about 30 miles inland. The Mlnab river, which enters the straits of Hormuz a few tniles west of Bandar Abbas has at Minab town a bed-width of 400-C00 yards. It usually carries a fair volume of water. It is one of the few rivers oi which the water can be used for irrigation, and in summer is drained almost dry by numerous channels taken off for this purpose. In Persian Makran there is no river of importance. Climate In the Persian Gulf area, weather is a matter of great com mercial importance, for, apart from the pearl-fisheries, the prosperity of the region depends chiefly on agriculture. General Climatology. —The Persian Gulf lies almost outside the region of the south-west monsoon, and its effect on the climate is for the most part indirect. On the Arabian side within Has cl- Hadd the monsoon is not felt at all, while on the opposite or Makran coast the monsoon rains do not extend farther than Ormara. The monsoon reaches Jask only in the form of a light south-west breeze. Seasons. —The summer is very hot and practically rainless. In the winter there is cold and stormy weather with a certain amount of rain. The hot season may be said to extend from the beginning of May to the end of October, and the cold from the middle of November to the middle of March, the remaining periods being transitional. From the middle of May till the middle of July the heat is intense, but is moderated at the upper end of the Gulf by a constantly blowing shamdl, or north-west wind, l^rom the middle of July to the middle of August the heat is very oppressive owing to the stillness of the atmosphere and to excessive moisture. Bad weather generally begins after the muldle of December, and January and February are cold and boisterous. Winds. —The general trend of air-currents at most seasons of the year is apparently down the Gulf trom north-west to south east. This is attributable in winter to the outflow from a high- pressure area over central Europe, and in summer to the existence of a low-pressure area over the Gult itself, Baluchistan, and tne Indus valley. The prevailing north-west wind, known as the shatn&amp;l, blows in the northern half of the Persian Gulf for about nine months in the year. It is very strong in April and almost incessant in26 PERSIAN GULF June. In summer the shamdl rarely exceeds the force of a moderate gale, in winter it is often fresh to a hard gale. The next most prevalent and distinctive wind is the leans, or south-east wind, which in winter alternates with the shamdl. Another wind is the na»hi, which blows strongly from north-east in the Gulf of Oman, especially in winter: during it the Batinah coast is a dangerous lee shore. The suhaili, or south-west wind, is much dreaded by native mariners, as it strikes nearly all the sheltered anchorages on the Persian coast. Temperature. —The difference in temperature between the north and south ends of the Persian Gulf is considerable. At the south end it never freezes, and snow is not seen except on distant mountains; but in Turkish Irak there are strong frosts at times, and snow has been known to fall at Bushire. Highest absolute temperatures are probably experienced in Irak, but the heat is most felt in the lower part of the Gulf on account of the humidity; it is perhaps more unbearable at Bandar 'Abbas than elsewhere. Mean daily maximum temperatures in July and August average: July August o F o F In Maskat .... 93 89 Tn Bahrein .... 98 98 In Bushire .... 95 97 Irak is the hottest of the districts and also the coldest; a reading of less than 19° Fahrenheit has been obtained at Baghdad. Rainfall and Humidify. —Rainfall in the Persian Gulf region is extremely Hg'ht; the following table shows the annual average in inches at the places where observations have been recorded : Arabian side. inches Bahi-ein 2J- Maskat 4 Head of Gulf. inches Baghdad 7 Basra 6J- Fao 2-4 Persian Gtdf. inches Bushire 11 J ask 4 Charbar 5-6 Rain is almost confined to the winter months and hardly ever falls before the middle of October or after the end of May. The principal rainy months are December, January, and February. The humidity is considerable. At Baghdad, which is a long distance from the Gulf, the average humidity is only 58 per cent., but in Bahrein it is 75 per cent.SANITARY CONDITIONS 27 S anitary C onditions The climate of the Persian Gulf region is, during several months of the year, very trying to Europeans, but it is not altogether unhealthy. The cold weather, though less unpleasant, appears to be more unhealthy than the hot; sickness is most prevalent in the transitional seasons, spring and autumn. Malarial fever is the principal disease of the region, and prickly heat and boils are very prevalent. Plague has shown itself in the Persian (jult at intervals since 1889, especially in the Gulf ports; there is but little plague in Mesopotamia. Epidemics of cholera are frequent, and at tiiiu;s severe; they have almost entirely confined themselves to the river towns on the Shatt el-'Arab. Small-pox is prevalent in the Persian Gulf region, and at times assumes an active epidemic form. There was no general organization of quarantine before the war; local systems were under the management of Turkey and Great Britain. Turkish quarantine, which is prescribed by the Constanti nople Board of Health, has, by excessive stringency and constant variation of rules, proved a serious impediment to commerce in Irak, while its protective value has been low. r lhe Turkish Government has at times endeavoured to extend its political influence on the Arabian coast by the establishment of quarantine stations, but without success. Outside Turkish territory sanitation, where it existed, was in the hands of the political representatives of the British Government. On the Persian coast arrangements as to sanitation were entrusted by the Persian Government to the British authorities in 1897. In 1903 they made an attempt to transfer the control from the British authorities to the Imperial Persian customs. In 1904 the Persian Sanitary Council was founded, but in the Persian Gulf there was not much evidence of its activities. The Govern ment of India dispensary was opened at Bandar 'Abbas in 1906, and has been the means of relieving much suffering. The chief quarantine officer in the Persian Gulf is the Residency Surgeon at Bushire, an officer of the Indian Medical Service, who represents the Persian Government.28 PERSIAN GULF MAN R ace, including L anguage Arabian Coastal Region The population of the Arabian coastal region of the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman is almost exclusively Arab, although alien elements occur in many of the coastal towns, especially in Oman. A large number of the population of the oases of Hasa and Qatif and the island of Bahrein belong to a race or class known as Baharinah. These may number 100,000. Their origin is doubtful, and they are regarded either as an aboriginal tribe conquered and absorbed by the Arabs, or as a class formed by the conversion of certain Arab tribes to Shiism about 300 years ago. The term, as now employed on the west coast of the Persian Gulf, is practically a synonym for Arab-speaking Shiah Mohammedans. The Arabs of Oman belong traditionally to two supposed racial groups: (1) Yamani, said to have been the first Arab settlers in Oman; (2) Nizari, less purely Arab and for the most part later immigrants. Each of these groups is divided into a large number of tribes, sections, and sub-sections. Nomads are exclusively Arab or quasi-Arab. Among the non-Arab elements are included the following : 1. On the shores of the Gulf proper there are about 1,000 Persians in Koweit, and 2,500 in Abu Dhabi and Dibai. 2. At Dibai there are about 1,400 Baluchis. 3. Along the coast of Oman there are colonies of Persians, in part relics of Persian occupation. 4. In the neighbourhood of Sohar and elsewhere there are Balnchis and Jadgals, of whom the former, now very numerous, were originally introduced as mercenary troops. There are considerable Indian communities in Maskat and Mat rah. 5. Negroes, both emancipated and slaves, are found in consider able numbers in the coastal towns of the Gulf proper, and there is a considerable negro element along the coast of Oman, the outcome of several centuries of slave trade. Arabic is spoken almost exclusively in this region; Persian, Hindustani, and Baluchi are also spoken in certain of the coast towns.RACE, INCLUDING LANGUAGE 29 Head of the Gulf The population at the head of the Persian Gulf is principally Arab. The district of Turkish Irak, on the right bank of the Shatt el-'Arab, together with the barren hinterland which holds a certain number of nomads, is populated by Arabs. In the town of Basra there are, in addition, a few Europeans and Indians, together with about 3,000 Persians and 1,000 Jews. In Southern Arabistan the population is mostly Arab, with probably in places an admixture of Persian blood. The following non-Arab elements occur: (1) In the town of Mohammareh, besides Arabs 1 , there are a considerable number of Persians, and a few Jews, Sabians, and Oriental Christians. (2) In Hindlyan and other districts there are some Persians. (3) In the eastern part of the country there are a certain number of Lurs. (4) In Mohammareh districts there are some negroes and a few Baluchis. In the province of Behbehan Kuhgiluyeh the population is Lur. In Behbehan town and plain there is a population of mixed Persian (Lur ?) descent, known as Behbelumis. Language in the region at the head of the Gulf is Arabic, with a proportion of Persian words in Southern Arabistan, with Lur dialects in the eastern districts. The Persian Littoral The population of the littoral of the Persian Gulf proper from Bandar Dilam to the straits of Hormuz is composed of a medley of races and racial blends. Among the inhabitants of the coastal region of the Gulf proper the most important elements are Persians and Persian Arabs ; the latter may be described as Arabs under Persian rule who have become denationalized by settlement, sub jection, or intermarriage; considerable numbers of them now adhere to the Shiah sect of Mohammedans, and they speak as a rule the Persian language. The settled population of the region probably consisted originally of Persians or Persian-speaking tribes. The numerous Arab settlements which have occurred seem to have come 1 Arabs in Mohammareh town are chiefly local Arabs with some descendants of Arab refugees from Bahrein.30 PERSIAN GULF partly from the mainland, from Southern Arabistan and the Ka'ab tribe, partly from the opposite side of the Gulf, from among* the Dawasir at Bahrein, and from the 'Ajmiin, Al 'Ali, and Shammar tribes in the mainland of Arabia. In some parts the two races seem to have blended, in others they are more clearly differentiated, as in the case of Arab settlements in Dashtistan, where there is an important group, of which Chakutah is the largest. There are Arab tribes in the Lingeh district and a considerable semi-Arab population in the Shibkuh district. Besides the race described above, and to a great extent mixed with them, there is in the north a strong Lur element, while in the south-east in the neighbourhood of Hormuz a Baluchi strain appears, and farther east the inhabitants of Biyaban are described as being all Baluchis. In Persian Makran there are a number of tribes mostly claiming to be descended from Arabs, who either originally settled in Makran or moved there later from Sind or Kach. Some of the inhabitants are of Indian origin, and there are many Baluchis. There are a number of Swahili negro slaves in Persian Makran. In the coastal towns the population is also very much mixed. The inhabitants of Bushire are mostly Persian, but include about 600 Jews and a few Armenians, Goanese, Baghdad Mohammedans, and some Europeans. In Bandar 'Abbas most of the population belong to a hybrid race of mixed Persian, Baluchi, Arab, and negro descent, and are known as AbbasTs. There are a number of immi grants, including Persians from Lar, from ; Avaz, and from Bastak, also Hindus, Khojahs, and Arabs. Lingeh also has a very com posite population of which the basis is Arab, chiefly immigrants from Trucial Oman and Bahrein. There is an admixture of negroes. Behind the coastal belt the population of the parts of the Persian province of Ears and Laristan which constitute the hinterland of the coastal region is extremely scanty. It is composed of tribes of mixed origin, partly settled and partly nomadic, in which Irani, Turki, and to a small extent Arab strains are present. Among the chief tribes are the Qashqai, a nomad tribe of Turki origin, a large number of whom descend to the garmsir, or warm pastures, from the mountain districts of the Persian plateau for the winter and spring months, and the Mamassani, a group of five tribes of Lur descent. The Persian language or a dialect of it is almost universallyRACE, INCLUDING LANGUAGE 31 spoken in the districts of the Persian coast, both among Persians and Arabs; a certain amount of Arabic is spoken in places. In some parts Arabic, Lur, or Baluchi modifications are introduced into the Persian dialect. In Bandar 'Abbas a dialect known as AbbasI is spoken by a section of the population. In Persian Makran the language of the country is a dialect of Baluchi called Makrani; it contains a number of Persian and Arabic words. P olitical and S ocial C onditions Arabian Coastal Region The districts which adjoin the Persian Gulf proper comprise a group of sheikhdoms and emirates under Arab rulers. Of these the Sheikh of Koweit is a mediatized ruler under British protection. Hasa is ruled by Ibn Sa'ud, Emir of Nejd, who, in June 1914, accepted the title of Vali of Nejd and Hasa from the Turks, but has remained in close relation to the British and Indian Govern ments, and during the war threw in his lot with the British. The island of Bahrein is under the personal rule of Sheikh Isa, who has been supported by the British against other claimants of his family. Qatar was occupied in 1872 by the Turks, who maintained a small garrison at Ddhah. It is now under the control of Ibn Sa'ud, Emir of Nejd. In Trucial Oman the position of the five ruling sheikhs, which include Sharjah, Dibai, Abu Dhabi, and Ras el-Kheimah, is governed by agreements with the British Government. The government of Oman is a sultanate, or absolute monarchy, the present hereditary sultanate having arisen out of an ancient elective imamate. The populations of both west and north Oman do not acknowledge his sway, and live in practical independence of him under their own chiefs, the Sultan's authority being limited to his capital and the coast. A rival imam has been set up in the interior by the principal Ibadhi sheikh. Of the Arabs of the coastal region the large majority are settled and live in towns. The Bedouin nomads who wander over the plains and hinterland, and reach even as far as Nejd or Jebel Shammar in the interior, form a proportion of the population which is small, and varies from time to time according to the location of the tribes. Among the population of the towns are many Arabs, recently nomadic, who have become settled. Among the settled32 PERSIAN GULF Arabs of this region the main distinctions are either religious or bandry, pearl political; tribal feeling is weak. In the districts adjoining the Gulf proper, where religious dis tinctions are paramount, the greater part of the population belong to the Sunni sect. Shiahs are for the most part either Baharinah or of Persian connexion. A few Wahabi Arabs from Nejd are also found among the population. The Baharinah have no tribal cohesion; the richer among them live by trade, the poorer by hus bandry, pearl-diving, and various handicrafts. In Oman political differences divide ^he population into two opposing factions known as Hinawlyah and Ghafiriyah, the result of a general civil war in the eighteenth century. The Hinawi faction consists mostly of Yamani tribes, while Ghafiri are for the most part Nizari. They live intermingled in groups and villages. The factions are equally marked among settled and among Bedouin tribes. The great majority of Hinawi tribes belong to the Ibadhi sect of Islam. Of Ghafiri tribes a considerable portion are orthodox Sunnis; a few are Wahabis of Oman. Tribal organization in Oman is loose; some tribes are scattered, others, though compact, are broken up into sections headed by sheikhs who acknowledge no common authority. In only a few cases is the tribe governed by a tawilmcih, a chief whose power extends all over its branches. This office, which is nominally elective, is in practice hereditary. Among the nomads of the Arabian coastal region tribal feeling is strong. Important tribes are : 1. The 'Ajman, of whom the greater number have their head quarters in Hasa. 2. The 'Awazim and Rashaidah, who are found for the most part in Koweit territory. Head of the Gulf The districts of Irak at the head of the Gulf formed a part, before the war, of the Turkish vilayet of Basra. The government of Southern Arabistan is administered by the Sheikh of Moham- mareh, as Governor of Mohammareh and its dependencies, nominally under the Persian Government; he is head of the Mn- haisin tribe, and exercises control over the powerful Ka'ab tribe. The Sheikh has been virtually independent, but his position was weakened when, in 1902, the control of the customs of the port wasPOLITICAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS 33 transferred to that of the new Belgian administration in exchange for a subsidy. Behbehan, though geographically belonging to Fars, has an administration and a government of its own. On the right bank of the Shatt el-'Arab there is very little tribal feeling, except among the Muhaisin, who look to the Sheikh of Mohammareh as their chief; power is in the hands of the land owners and village sheikhs. In Arabistan the tribal system is more highly developed; it does not rest upon a rigid basis of race, and the strength of the tribe or section is liable to be increased by addition to its numbers from without, or diminished by desertion from within; sheikhs or headmen of the tribes or sections are generally chosen from a family in which the office is hereditary. Some of the tribes are settled, others are nomadic, while a con siderable number are in a transitional stage between the two. The settled and semi-settled tribes are mainly agricultural, and the nomadic mainly pastoral, but even the latter cultivate a certain amount of grain in winter. On the right bank of the Shatt el-^Arab are Arabs belonging chiefly to the tribe of ^Idan, with a few Muhaisin from across the river. In Southern Arabistan the principal tribes are the Muhaisin and the Ka^ab: the former are politically stronger, the latter numerically. The Muhaisin have their centre at Mohammareh and are a settled tribe. The Ka'ab, whose focus is Fellahlyeh, should probably be regarded as settled. The principal nomad tribes are the Beni Turuf, Beni Saleh, and Beni Tamim. In Behbehan province a large number of the inhabitants belong to the Kuhgalu, a division of the Lur tribe; each division of the tribe has its own chief. The Persian Littoral Local districts of the Persian coast are for the most part under the government of a local hereditary chief, khan, or sheikh, who collects the land tax in his own domain on behalf of the Persian Government. Certain districts are in a very disturbed state, others remarkably orderly; the inhabitants are for the most part much more civilized than the tribesmen of the interior. Blood feuds are common, and cattle raids sometimes lead to encounters between the34 PERSIAN GULF different tribes and factions. There are no criminal courts beyond the personal administration of the governor or local khan; civil justice of a sort is dispensed, but it is extremely venal. In religion the inhabitants are almost entirely Shiah Mohammedans. Some of the Arabs are Sunnis, but a great many of them ^eem to have become Shiah. Persian Makran is nominally administered by a governor, who has his seat at Biimpur, subject to the authority of the Persian Governor-General of Kirman; in practice this official is rarely appointed, and the country is in a condition of anarchy. The country is divided into five districts, each of which is ruled by a chief who is supposed to pay tribute to the governor, but in the administration of his district is free from interference by the Persian executive. The chiefs of districts are assisted by the re ligious authorities, or mullahs, and by headmen of the villages. There is no organized system of law and order, and serious dis turbances have been common in recent years. The blood feud remains customary, and slavery prevails in most parts of the country. In religion the people are Mohammedans, most of the Sunni sect. Population Arabian Coastal Region 1. The total population, settled and nomadic, of the districts adjoining the Gulf proper is said to be in the neighbourhood of 300,000. This is made up as follows: Koweit . . 37,000 settled 13,000 nomadic Hasa . . . 100,000 „ 50,000 Qatar . . . 26,000 „ unknown Trucial Oman . 72,000 „ 8,000 „ The islands of Bahrein have about 100,000 inhabitants. The population of the district as a whole is extremely scanty, and vast tracts are either uninhabited or are inhabited only at certain times of the year by a few nomads. Chief centres of population are : (i) Certain coastal towns and ports connected with the interior by caravan routes. The great majority of the inhabitants of these towns take part in the pearl-fisheries and in the smaller industries connected with them, such as boat-building, sail-making, &amp;c. There are also considerable sea-fisheries, in which some of the pearl-fishers take part during the winter.POPULATION 35 The numbers of inhabitants of these towns are as follows: Koweit Qatif . . . . . Bida Abu Dhabi Dibai Sharjah Manamab, on the island of Bahrein Muharraq, „ „ „ 35,000 5,000 12,000 6,000 20,000 15,000 25,000 20,000 (ii) The oases of Hasa and Qatlf. These include extensive dis tricts of considerable fertility; the inhabitants are mainly occupied in agriculture. Hasa oasis has a population of 67,000, of whom 25,000 are included in the capital Hofuf. The population of Qatlf oasis is 26,000. 2. Of the districts which adjoin the Gulf of Oman, the sultanate of Oman has about 500,000 inhabitants, of whom 30,000 are nomads, in the hinterland. Oman proper is said to have a popula tion of 34,300. Bedouins are numerous in Oman proper and on the verge of the desert generally, but their numbers cannot be estimated. The most populated districts of Oman are: (i) The coastal plain of Batinah, which has a settled population of 105,000 engaged for the most part in agriculture and the cultiva tion of dates and in the coastal fisheries. (ii) The Wadi Sema'il, a most populous valley with a settled population of 2,000 engaged largely in date cultivation. (iii) The coastal towns, of which Maskat has a population of 10,000 and Matrah has 11,000. Matrah, Sur (pop. 12,000), and Sohar (pop. 7,500) are starting-points of caravan routes to the interior. Kaburah has 8,000 inhabitants. The inhabitants of coastal towns are engaged in the fisheries and local maritime trade, and also in trade with the east coast of Africa and with India. Tom/s and Villages. —Owing to the barren and waterless nature of the region the inhabitants are found mostly in the coastal towns; villages are numerous only where there are oases and springs and cultivation is possible. There are many villages in the oases of Hasa and Qatif, in the island of Bahrein, along the Batinah coast, and in the Wadi Sema'il, and in the districts inland and in the mountains of Oman. A certain number of the inhabitants of the towns, who are not occupied in the fisheries, are engaged in minor industries, such as36 PERSIAN GULF boat-building, sail-making 1 , metal industries, and the weaving of abhas. In the larger towns, and especially in Hofuf, where contact with the outside world is maintained through Indian and other merchants, buildings and architecture are more elaborate, and a higher standard of life prevails. Village life is primitive. The inhabitants of villages are engaged almost exclusively in agriculture. Increase and Decrease. —Increase and decrease in population are due in the Arabian coastal region chiefly to local causes. In the months between May and September there is a considerable influx of population for the pearl-diving, and boats come to this coast from the Persian shore and from all parts of the Gulf. In autumn there are local movements of population for the purposes of the date harvest. The population also varies according to the movements of the Bedouin. These are engaged in the rearing of flocks of sheep and in camel breeding. During the winter and spring they wander far and wide over the plains in search of pasture. In the hot weather they come in to the wells and oases. They also visit the towns in order to make purchases and to sell live stock and ghi. Head of the Gulf The population of the districts of Turkish Irak at the head of the Gulf probably approaches 120,000; of these about 40,000 inhabit the town of Basra ; most of the remainder are found in the numerous villages, which are situated in the date-groves which line the banks of the river. These are engaged in agricul ture, principally in date culture. The population iu the hinterland is scanty. The population of Southern Arabistan is probably rather over 200,000. The town of Mohammareh has about 18,000 inhabitants, HawTzeh has 5,000, Fellahlyeh 2,000, Hindiyan about 4,000. Large parts of the country are uninhabited or only sparsely populated. The numbers of settled inhabitants and nomads are probably about equal. The former, with the exception of the comparatively small numbers who live in towns, are found in the villages, which are numerous in certain parts of the country. There are many villages on the left bank of the Shatt el-'Arab, and a certain number on the banks of the Karun in the Mohammareh district. In the Fellahlyeh district most of the(E) POPULATION 37 villages are agricultural settlements, situated on canals taken off from the JerrahT river. There are a number of villages also on the Hindiyan river. The great bulk of the nomads inhabit the districts of Ahwaz and Hawizeh; in summer and autumn they camp in the marshes, in winter and spring they roam over the desert with their flocks and herds. A proportion of the nomads migrate between the Persian and Turkish sides of the frontier. The Muhaisin, who are looked upon as a settled tribe, leave Mohammareh at certain times of the year in order to cultivate their grain lands on the Karun. The population of the town of Behbehan is said to be from 12,000 to 15,000. The number of inhabitants is probably over 300,000; this in cludes the population of coastal towns, of which Bushire has about 25,000, Lingeh about 12,000, and Bandar 'Abbas about 10,000. The population of Persian Makran is estimated at about 114,000. With the exception of the towns mentioned above, the population is scattered in numerous small villages along the sea-coast, or in the coastal plain at the foot of the mountains. The inhabitants are engaged principally in agriculture, growing wheat and barley— date cultivation is small on the Persian coast—or in seafaring occupations, pearl-diving, sea-fishing, and Ihe local carrying trade; in the harvest season all are engaged in the fields. The Persian population is mainly engaged in agriculture, the Arabs partly in agriculture and partly in maritime pursuits. There is a con siderable amount of coastal trade between the seaports of the Persian littoral; also between these ports (notably Lingeh) and the Arabian coast, and especially Bahrein and Trucial Oman. Dwellings in the villages are for the most part primitive and consist largely of huts made of date leaves plastered with mud ; in the towns buildings are more substantial and are made of stone and plaster of Paris, or sun-dried bricks and mud.
