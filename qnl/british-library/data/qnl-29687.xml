LDRAFT LETTER uui 194/ Would you please refer to correspondence resting vdth Baxter* s letter No. E.361/3^1/91 of the 20th January, 1947, about the proposal to set up a dispensary at Dhofar? I enclose for your information a copy ^ of letter No. 1797-S dated the 15th October and enclosures which we have now received from Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, on this subject. You will see from this correspondence that a hospital has now been established at Qatar, and that it is to be administered by the American Mission. This mission is the Arabian Mission of the Dutch Reformed Church which has hospitals at Bahrein, Koweit and Muscat. The excellencf. of their medical work has made them popular with^local inhabitants, and it is not surprising that the Shaikh/Shaikh of Qatar has turned to them for advice and assistance in running his hospital. , * Prom our point of view it is perhaps unfortunate that medical facilities at Qatar should have fallen into American hands. There is probably no more effective way of securing influence and friendship amongst the peoples of the Persian Gulf than by providing them with facilities for the treatment of sickness. The opportunity has however passed for the present, though it may be possible to consider the establishment ofrbmmfr Agency hospital at Qatar at a later stage when our interests there demand a resident Political Officer. I do not think that there is any ground hu on which we can object to arrangement now made with the American Mission and, if you agree, I will inform Hay accordingly. Incidentally, it appears that Hay does not envisage any difficulty in securing the assent of 6 the Shaikh to the appointment of an Assistant Political/INDEXED Please refer to correspondence ending with your letter No.Ext.187/47 dated the 28th January 1947. 2. I forward herewith a copy of Jackson*s demi- official letter No.C/992 dated the 3rd October and its enclosure and of his letter No.C/1007 of the 9th October and its enclosure. 3. It would appear that the establishment of a hospital by the American Mission in Qatar is a fait accompli . I see no grave objection and I imagine H.M.G. will be glad to be relieved of the responsibility and expense. 4. It is no longer feasible now to post in Qatar a Government doctor who would also act as a political representative. In due course I think we shall have to post a second assistant to the Political Agent, Bahrain, for Qatar affairs and if possible arrange for him to live on the peninsula, but this matter can wait for the time being. I have discussed the point with Lermitte who says he does not think there will be any necessity for a political officer to reside in Qatar for another twelve months but that one is likely to be required then.

As all the arrange ments for the trip had already been made, and as I knew that Steele was too busy to go, I raised no objection. 4. In the course of conversation Storm told me that the Shaikh had sought his advice on the design of a hospital building and had later asked him what equipment should be bought. Storm told me that he had assisted the Shaikh in the design of the building; and had bought Rs.5,000/- worth of equipment, for which the Shaikh had paid in full. The equipment has arrived and is awaiting delivery to Qatar in the Mission Hospital here. 5. Storm assured me that the Mission had only helped with advice and as purchasing agents for equipment, and that they had contributed no money at all to the Shaikh's hospital. 6. Storm offered to let me know, when he returned, exactly how the project was proceeding. Yours sincerely, Sd/- G.N. Jackson. The Hon'ble Lt-Col.A.C.

This, as your Excellency knows, is a philanthropic project, behind which we aim to afford medical facilities to those who are patient and needy. The Hospital has now been constructed in accordance with the advice given by the doctors who visited us, notably Dr. Storm and I beg to inform your Excellency that the building of the hospital has been completed and implements, medicines, and the doctor have been provided. We would like to have it run; but in the meantime we feel that we cannot dispense with your advice in this respect.

Bahrain Islands, Persian Gulf. October 6, 1947. Dear Mr. Jackson, Referring to our conversation of Oct.l, in reference to Quattar, I returned yesterday, and am sending you this report, with the thought that it can be passed on to the Political Resident, Sir Rupert Hay K.C.I.E. The twenty-bed Hospital is nearing completion, and the Shaikh promises to have it finished in another fifteen days. His desire is that the American Mission Hospital assume full responsibility for its administration. He will pay a thousand rupees a month for the staff, including an Indian Doctor and nurses. He would like to have the American doctors to spend at least one month a year working in this Hospital. In consideration of this thousand rupees a month, the Shaikh and his family will be treated free, but others will be charged fees suited to their ability to pay. This income will be used for the Drugs and running expense. We will collect fees and pay all bills. We look on this as an Out-patient development of the American Mission Hospital in Bahrain.

To The Hon’ble Lt.Col.t.R.Hay, CSI., CIE., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain .(E. 361/361/91) Restricted, IP T) {r*\ Your letter No. Ext.8653/46 of the 8th January, 1947/ ulduul &amp; proposal to set up a dispensary at Dohah in Qatar. We agree with the action you propose. C. U;. (C.W. Baxter) E. P. Donaldson, Esq., India Office.At present the officer responsible for Qatar is the Political Agent, Bahrein. Ife is also responsible, while the post of Political Officer, Trucial Coast, is vacant, for the whole of the Trucial Coast; and with the difficulty of transport he must be unable to give the attention to these areas that the increasing activities of the oil companies would warrant. Apparently Col. Hay considers that the Sheik of Qatar would be unwilling to agree to the appointment of a Political Officer as such in Qatar; but if he is willing that a dispensary should be established with a doctor in charge who could also fulfil political functions if necessary, this difficulty would be obviated. Under Article 8 of the treaty with Qatar of 1916 the Sheik undertook 'to receive, should the British Government deem it advisable, an Agent from the British Government who shall remain at Al-Bidaa for the transaction of such business as the British Government may have with me and to watch over the interests of British traders residing at ny ports or visiting them upon their lawful occasions.' A letter was addressed to the Sheik by the Politica 1 Resident on the date of signature of the treaty saying that the British Government saw no necessity at that time for the execution of Article 8 and would not give , «T ... . , . , , ., , - , , _ ,, effect to them without obtaining the consent of the Sheik. It seems, however, very unlikely that the Government of India will sanction funds for the establishment of a dispensary at Dohah now that H.M.G. is about to take over administrat ive/administrative and if inane ial control in the Gulf. Th^y have recently refused to consider a proposal from the Political Resident for the air-conditioning of the Agency at Koweit until a decision on the financial arrangements is taken. /. . or.' + ■'it / / •mmA-^ X *ritr to affk If you could let no know whether there le any prospect of the Covernifient of Indif* , js providing fund® for the eetablieh^nt of a dlepeneary at Dohah in vatar* Wow that Petroleu® Concesoion®.

I attach a copy of a report on the dispensary at Dubai by the Residency Surgeon, Bushire, from which it will be observed that the average number of patients attending the dispensary has exceeds* all expectations and the number is expected to increase consider ably in the autumn, when the pearl-fishers return. 3. To meet this unexpected volume of work, it was found necessary to engage, as a temporary measure and in anticipation of the approval of Government, one Dispenser on Rs.25/- per mensem and one Dresser on Rs.20/- per mensem with effect from the 10th June, 1959. In their memorandum No *F.18(10)-3(a)/38, dated the 29th July, 1938, the Government of India sanctioned the appointment of one Dresser only on Rs.20/- per mensem plus a house rent allowance of Rs.5/- per mensem. 4* The provision for medical equipment and drugs also proved inadequate and it was found necessary to forward a supplementary indent for drugs to the Government Medical Stores, Bombay. The total expenditure on medical equipment, drugs and other hospital contingencies in the current financial year is therefore expected to amount to Rs.1,600/. 5* In the circumstances, I request that the Government of India will be pleased to accord sanction to (1) the creation of the posts of Dispenser and Dresser on Rs.25/- and Rs.20/- per mensem respectively, from 10th June 1939 to 28th February 1940, (2) sun expenditure of Rs.1,600/- on medical equipment, drugs and hospital contingencies during the current financial year.The extra expenditure involved on the above items in the current year will be met, as far as possible, by reappropriation within tn grants of this Residency. 5. For the ensuring financial year I recommend that (1) the Sub-Assistant Surgeon be granted, in addition to the ^ sanctioned rates of pay, a quarantine Allowance of Rs.25/ permensem for quarantine duties (2) a suitable Compounder be engaged on Rs.40/- per mensem in addition to a Dresser on Rs.25/- per mensem, and (3) a grant of Rs.1,500/- say be sanctioned for the purchase of medical equipment and drugs and Rs*300/- for mis cellaneous contingent expenditure, such as lighting, sweeping, washing charges, saxxk stationery, etc* 7.

As regards your requirements for 1940-41, it is requested that details of the quarantine work done by the Sub-Assistant Surgeon may kindly be furnished at an early date* It is presumed that the post of Compounder on Rs*40/- is required only in the place of the temporary post oi dispenser created by you and that the latter post will cease to exist at the end of February 1940* This may pleace be confirmed. THS ISSUR OF THE ABOVE HAS BEEN AUTHORISED. 31Copy of an apress letter from Britconsul. Bushire, Foreign, New Delhi, No.101-14/226, dated the 13th January 1940. Medical arrangements on the Trucial Coast* • • • • Reference paragraph 3 of your express letter No.F.18(10)- E(A)/38 dated the 21st December 1939. 2. It has been found that the question of quarantine work at Dibai is one which requires further consideration; the proposal fan a quarantine allowance for the medical officer may therefore be dropped. 3. At the same time, however, I strongly recommend that the local allowance of this officer should be raised from Rs.ftO/- to Rs.75/- a month. He has represented, not without just grounds, that his emoluments are inadequate to compensate him for the additional hardships and rigorous conditions of his present employment and in view of his enforced separation from his family, compare unfavourably with the terms under which he would serve in a Military hospital in India, where his pay and allowances amounted to Rs . 113 / 4 /“ as against the Rs.145/- which he now received at Dibai. This is due to the fact that he has ceased to draw ration allowance (Rs.15/- p.m.) and clothing allowance (Rs.3/4/- p.m.) and only received a local allowance of Rs.50/- per mensem over his basic pay of Rs.95/- per mensem. 4. It may be observed that in Government of India External Affairs Department memorandum No *F.18(10)-£(A)/38 dated the 29th July 1938, the special pay originally sanctioned for the medical officer on the Trucial Coast was no\ less than Rs-100/- a month, in addition to the grade pay to which he was entitled; an allowance of Rs.35/- per mensem is therefore in every way rfiaumiai reasonable, the more sxxps especially as the officer concerned has proved fully satisfactory. 5. It would also request that a fixed travelling allowance of Rs.30/- per mensem be sanctioned for this officer. Though his headquarters/P.Z. ' 3573 headqurters are at Dubai, a place eminently auxt i. ing a to its central position and the number of Indians resident there he is called upon in the course of his duties to make frequent visits to Sharjah, eleven miles away, in order to attend the Residency Agent and other Indian Government employees in the Fort# R2SID3NT THE ISSUE OF THE ABOVE HAS BEEN AUTHORISED.4 • The/ •*•••• From - Tho Under Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affaire Department, To - - The Hobble the Political Heeident in the Persian Gulf* Memorandum No*F.18(10)-ii;(A)/38.

Sir, With reference to Foreign Office letter E 4'7?6/50/91 of the 23rd August, 1937, and subsequent semi-oilicial correspondence regarding the proposed appointment of a Resident Medical Officer on the Trucial Coast, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to request you to inform the Marquess of Zetland that the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury have conveyed their authority to share with the Government of India the cost of the appointment, which they note will amount to approximately £500 a year. 2. I am to add that this authority is given by Their Lordships on the understanding that the appointment is regarded as falling within the terms of the existing arrangement under which expenditure on sanitary measures in the Trucial Coast area is shared by Imperial and Indian revenues and that the position of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the wider issues under discussion in connexion with the incidence of expenditure in Persia and the Persian Gulf is accordingly in no way prejudiced.

The situation now is that as nis Majesty's Govern ment are unable to share the cost of the Medical officer before a decision has been arrived at on the general question of the division of expenditure in Bahrain, the Government of India, who were willing to bear a moiety of the cost, prefer to postpone the appointment. 5 This is unfortunate for the following reasons: (a) it is undesirable on general grounas to have American Missionary doctors, or inueea doctors of any foreign nationality on the Trucial Coasu, ana tae only way by which this can be avoided is by having a doctor of cur own there to whom the local Shaikhs ana tneir subjects will turn. (b) (more important still). The lersian Gulf is no longer a cul d^e sac , but from the medical (as well as from the political) point of view an international corri dor between west and East through which epidemics can spread, and contagion can quickly be carried: e.g. by lii+o cir ci r ft passengers. i'cr the sanitary arrangements on J.O.

I have received no comments on these letters either from His llajesty’s Government or the government of India ana so presume that the arrangements made are considered satisfactory). The weak link in the sanitary chain, however, still remains on the Truciai Coast, where we have no medical arrangements whatever, in the event o 1 prominence being given to this fact by, for example, influential passengers by Imperial Airways ^which calls on the Truciai Coast), or by the press, or, worse still, by the outbreak of a serious epidemic in a neighbouring country, such as India, Persia, Iraq, or baud! Arabia, the origin of which could be traced to the Truciai Coast, we should have to face strong criticism against which, in the absence of medical arrangements in that area, it would be impossible to defend ourselves. 4. In view of the foregoing considerations, and having- regard to the small expenditure involved, i trust that it will be possible for His Majesty’s Government to reconsi der their decision, and to agre e to share the cost or the appointment pending a decision on the general question of divisibility of expenditure.

The letter from the Foreign Office dated 23rd August, which is now submitted, is exceedingly unhelpful and ti^ position has now been N reached in which the Government of India are not prepared to sanction the proposal unless H.M.G. accept in advance a moiety of the cost, while H.M.G. are not prepared to accept a moiety of the cost until a decision is reached on the general question of the division of the expenditure at Bahrein and Muscat. In these circumstances there are two possible alternatives. The first is to drop the whole question for the present. This would be the line of least resistance but it seems hardly fair to the local political authorities in the Gulf who have been pressing for a considerable time the urgency of the need for a Medical Officer on the Trucial Coast. The other alternative is to treat the proposal in the same way as the two recent proposals (see P.Z. 8656/36 and p.Z.2141/37) for the reorganisation of the Bahrein Agency Office and the provision of new servants quarters at Bahrein. in both these cases owing to the urgency of the proposals it was decided to sanction the expenditure under existing arrangements (unaer which the total cost falls on Indian revenues) and to inform the Foreign Office that the expenditure will be regarded as forming part of the total Bahrein expenditure of which it is suggested that a moiety should be accepted by Imperial revenues.

If, therefore, the Government of India adhere to the view expressed in their letter of the 13th July 1936 that the appointment can only be made if H.M.G. agree to share the cost, it would appear that it will be impossible to make the appointment for a considerable time. As, however, the project is one to which the local political authorities appear to attach considerable importance, and as the cost involved is comparatively small, the Secretary of State would suggest that ^ this proposal might be treated in the same way as the proposals for the provision of new servants’ quarters at Bahrein (to which 5973 5000 3.37 the/the Government of India’s express letter of the 26th March 1937, No. F. 292-A/35 , refers) and for the reorganisation of the Bahrein Agency Office (to which the Government of India’s telegram of the 27th November 1936, NO.1065-E refers).

I 1 4 833 1 1936, 2956 6000 7/34 In Pebmary 1935 the Political Agent, Bahrein, made a proposal for the establishment of a Medical Of!icer on the Trucial Coast (Flag D). This proposal was forwarded to the Government of India, slightly amended, by the Political Resident. The Government of India however linked it up with a proposal, which they were putting forward at the time, that the expenditure at Bahrein and Muscat, now practically all borne on Indian Revenues, should be shared by His Majesty^ Government. They said that they could not justify expenditure on a Trucial Coast Medical Officer falling on Indian Revenues as he was required largely for Imperial purposes (Government of India letter of 16th January 1936, flag A), and that they were therefore postponing consideration of the proposal. The Government of Indian general proposals are at present hanging fire for the reasons given in the minute at Flag C (namely that we are not satisfied as to their desirability from the political point of view at the present time). The Government of India were accordingly urged to treat the T rU cial Coast proposal separately (letter to Sir H.Metcalfe of 22nd May at Flag B). It was intended by this that the charge should be accepted on Indian Revenues 'without prejudice', but the Government of India have now put in a revised proposal by which the expenditure will be shared 'without prejudice'. They also say that they are accepting a moiety 'on the understanding that' their general proposals will be accepted. In the circumstances it is proposed to write to the Foreign Office and the Government of India on the lines of the draft letters now submitted. /y Secretary, Financial Dept., For concurrence or any observations.

This proposal was originally linked with a general proposal, which was put forward by the Government of India and is still under the consideration of the Secretary of State, that H.M.Gr. should be asked to bear as a charge on Imperial revenues a moiety of the recurrent expenditure in dahrein and at Muscat. In view, however, of the urgency of the need for a medical Ofiicer on the Trucial Coast, it was suggested to the Government of India that this particular proposal might be dealt with independently, and the Government of India have agreed, on condition that h.j hi-i-r&gt;irn ^ the cost, which is now estimated by them at Rs.6310 for the first year and Rs.6210 for subsequent years ; ^ ^ 3- Lord Zetland agrees with the Government of India that, in view of the fact/fact that the ledical Officer in question is required largely for Imperial purposes (for instance, as a result of the opening of the Trucial Coast to air navigation and oil prospection), and that the small expenditure on ”sanitary arrangements” at Bahrein is already divisible, the cost should equitably be shared by Imperial and Indian revenues, without prejudice to a ideeiaion on the general question of incidence of expenditure in this area. His Lordship accordingly proposes, subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and to the acceptance of a moiety of the estimated cost as a charge upon Imperial revenues, to approve the recommendations contained in the Political Agent’s letter dated 21st February, 1935, No 293-2/10, as modified by the Political Resident’s letter of 8th Pay, 1935, No. 887/14/226, copies of which formed part of the papers sent to the Foreign Office on 6th February, 1936, numbered P.Z. 833/36.

As you are aware, this proposal, which was set out in Loch’s letter of 21st February, 1935 No.293-2/10 and Fowle’s covering letter of 8th May, 1935, No.887/14/226 (copies of both of v/hich were enclosed in your letter under reference) has since been mentioned again by Loch in his letter of 19th February, 1936, No.C/85-26/2. Perhaps you would let me know whether the Government of India have considered the proposal and Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, KCIE.,CSI.,MV0•, Foreign &amp; Political Department, whether/ Government of India, Simla.whether they are prepared to proceed with it as a matter of urgency without awaiting a decision on the proposals in your letter of the 16th January* Yours (Sgd.) M, J CLAUSON - mmmiCopy of letter No.887/14/226, dated the 8th May, 1935, from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. Medical work on the Trucial Coast 1 have the honour to forward, herewith, a letter from Lieut.-Colonel Loch, Political Agent, Bahrain, in which he advocates the appointment of a British Medical Officer for work on the Trucial Coast in order to counter the increasing activity and influence in this region of the American Mission at Bahrain. 2. I am in complete agreement in principle with colonel Loch's views but I do not consider that the desired result would be likely to be achieved by the employment of the individual or of the type suggested by him. 3. After consultation with the Residency Surgeon here 1 am of opinion that a far more suitable incumbent of the post would be an Assistant Surgeon 3rd class who would not only be better qualified but over whom as a Government official we would have far more control. 4. The financial aspect of the scheme is given in the enclosure to Colonel Loch's letter. The only difference being that the Assistant surgeon suggested would receive Rs.275/- per mensem instead of Rs.250/~ allowed for by Colonel Loch. 5. In view of the importance in combating American activity and the infiltration of American influence into the Trucial Coast 1 trust the Government ctf India will see their way to sanction my proposal.Copy ol letter No. kl92-^/lG, dated the 21st February, 1935, from Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon Loch, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain, to the Hobble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Medical work on the Trucial Coast. I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with your Express netter No.74, dated the 14th January, 1935, and to submit fuller information on the subject of medical work on the Trucial Coast. ^• Recently the Arabian Mission have shown a renewed interest in Q,atar and the Trucial Coast and Doctor H. Storm (whose action in entering Dhufar without the permission of ■bis Highness tne Sultan oi Muscat is known to you) has been appointed to Banrain with the avowed intention of undertaking vvide travel. He has already approached me with a request for permission to proceed to Sharjah, so that the matter is pressing. Dr. Dame and Dr. Thoms have recently spent a considerabl* time in Qatar, where it seems probable (though proof is unlikely ever to oe forthcoming) that one of them endeavoured to bring influence to bear on shaikh 'Moduli bin Jasim al lhani in favour at the California Arabian Standard Oil Company and both talked considerably in an anti-British and pro-American strain. Doctor Dame visited Sharjah recently at the request of the Shaikh to attend a rich merchant. He was there approached by certain disgruntled persons and said that he would mention their grievance (a purely internal and personal question about an estate) to the Political Agent. This is obviously the best reply from his point of view, but it would clearly be most difficult if an idea were to get about that access to the ear of the Political Agent could be had through an American missionary.a. 3. It is almost impossible to do anything to prevent the doctors of the Arabian mission from bringing medical uid to the Trucial Coast or ^atar, unless we provide medical aid ourselves. 4. For the reasons outlined, that is (a) the dangers of the penetration through medical missionaries of Amercian influence on the Trucial Coast and in Q,atar and (b) the impossibility ol preventing them from coming unlessve provide medical aid, it is, I think, essential that we should make arrangements for medical work in that area. 5. I have done what I can locally by taking Assistant Surgeon E. Holmes, the Medical Officer-in-Charge of the Victoria Memorial Hospital, v/ith me on my recent tours in December 1934 and February 1935 and tables attached to my letter Ho.1791 dated the S9th December, 1934, and to this leoter give some idea of the valuable work which he has done at Sharjah, jibai and Abu Dhabi. I would only add that he speaks Arabic and has an exceptional flair for winning the confidence of the Shaikhs and people, so much so that in Sharjah a number of women came for treatment without their menfolk, which is eloquent testimony to the respect in which he is held. Aven these few brief visits have had the effect of materially increasing the cordiality of our welcome. 6. But I only felt justified in taking Assistant Surgeon Holmes from his work in Bahrain, because it was pressingiy necessary from the political point of view to start our medical work before the Americans should have entered the field. He cannot ordinarily be spared from Bahrain where the hospital and dispensary demand his full attention, and as he is Quarantine Medical Officer it is undesirable that he should be long absent. 7. I have heard, through Assistant Surgeon Holmes, of a ship’s doc cor of the British India Steam Navigation CompanyLimited, a Doctor A. Madkarni, who will be due to retire from their service about the end of March, 1935, but wishes for some otrier employment to supplement his means sufficiently to finish the education of his son. He is aged about 49 years and served in an hospital ship during the Mar. Assistant surgeon Holmes has known him in the course of his quarantine duties for some years and says that he appears quiet and well mannered, and thinks that his experience as a ship’s doctor in the rersian Gulf should have familiarized him with Arab customs. He speaks some Persian and would doubtless pick up sufficient Arabic in a short' time. 8. I recommend that I should be allowed to take an opportunity of seeing Doctor Madkarni on his next voyage and, if he appears suitable, of ascertaining for what pay he would be prepared to serve on the Trucial Coast for a period of say three years. I understand that something in the vicinity of Rs.£50/- and an house allowance of Hs.5G/- a month (total Hs.300/- a month) mi^ht attract him. 9. a attach a statement showing the initial and recurring cost of the medical work, on the assumption that we employ Doctor Madkarni. 1 xoropose that he should have his headquarters at Sharjah, as the Airways Station is there and it will be easy to communicate with him by the Airway’s Wireless, but that he should spend roughly twenty days in the month at Sharjah and Dibai and ten days a month in out- Umm-al-Qawain stations, Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Hamriyah/and Has Al Khaimah, and possibly later on at other villages. His movements would be under the control of the Political Agent, Bahrain, and would naturally be governed by the season. He would need accommodation at his headquarters, for which an allowance is the best arrangement, and at other places the Shaikhs would, 1 have no doubt, place a room at his disposal for his workwhile he is at their towns. GOuimunicat ions are very sketchy and means for performing journeys will be largely made available by the courtesy of the Shaikhs and of His Majesty’s Ships and I think that the best plan is to give him and the dresser a daily allowance while they are on tour. Experience will show whether any further help is necessary. I would recommend that treatment at the dispensary should be free. There will be but little opportunity for private practice on the frucial coast, but 11 well-to-do people wish the Doctor to visit them in their homes, I think that he should be permitted to charge a small fee for doing so.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001b3_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3867</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001b3</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3867</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 30/133 'Persian Gulf.
