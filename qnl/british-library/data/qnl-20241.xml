Dated the 6th December 1917. § Please see Cox's telegram 4488, dated 20th Copy sent vith my Memo- No.7115,dated October in which the inability or disinclination of 22-10-1917 to C.G.S. Shaikh of Koweit to prevent a large caravan leaving Koweit was reported. That particular caravan may have been bona fide but since then we have continued to receive evidence of large quantities of supplies from Koweit reaching enemy destinations. # Shaikh Salim when remonstrated with simply denies statements while averring that nothing can leave the town without his knowledge. At present there is practically no steamer traffic to Koweit and the port receives its supplies almost entirely by dhow from other ports, so that control from the source (i.e. Bombay and Karachi) is not possible. Neither do we desire in view of the urgency of the food question to deprive Mesopotamia of a conveniently situated additional clearing station for foodstuffs. But it is becoming urgently necessary so to supervise ard register all export as to ensure its not passing to enemy destinations. In order to do this, no other course seems left to us but to place \\ • troops at Koweit to form blockade cordon round the town and regulate export under the supervision of the Political Officer, with such assistance as may be far necessary. It i considered that platoons would suffice. Though the Shaikh is new end we have not much ' \nruch experience of him Cox thinks that if the urgency of the matter in onr common interests is brought home to him he will accept the arrangement without serious opposition but that in any case we should go through with it and if necessary locate one of H.M.'s ship there for a time until he has got used to our presence. Request authority to proceed on above lines. Addressed Foreign; repeated Secretary of State and High Commissioner, Cairo. General, Baghdad.

Owing to possible hostility of Sheikh and populace and of outside Arabs interested in traffic, military view here is that detachment to Koweit of force of small strength seems inadvisable. Having in view the undesirabllity at the present juncture of extra commitments and of possibility that action proposed might result merely in diversion of illicit traffio in dhows to other parts of the coast and in alienating the Sheikh, we suggest that other means of achieving the desired object should, if possible, be tried, e.g. substantially inducing Sheikh himself to take adequate measures* However, Cox will doubtless do everything possible, if no other course is open, to convince Sheikh that it is . necessary to act and gMld the pill.

Your telegram No.6420 dated 29th December. Have interviewed Sheikh who agrees to our establishing blockade post for control of export to interior. Extension of scope of blockade post over sea customs house is desirable but I would not recommend our pressing it for the present. I certainly think that a douc^r is indicated not only to induce tractabi lity but generally to encourage him to co-operate in our Bedouin policy to give genuine assistance to Ibn Baud should the latter undertake active operations against Ibn Rashid. At present moment relations between Kowait and Ibn oaud are very bad chiefly on account of latter^$iu2uiucing the vv,'aij;iin which action induced Kovait to intrigue with Ajman. Conciliatory letter has hov.ever been sent by Sheikh to Bin Siud I and^hope from a^urances given me by the latter at Riadh that an amicable settlement is in sight. After ne Vwa^im have been returned it will almost certainly bo necessary to require Sheikh to send away the Ajnan. You will understand that most of these requirements ill go against the grain with Sal in but ^o great is his love of money that I feel sure he would swallow it all if given a good present I find that Kowait owes Government Rs.1,87,500 borrowed by Mubarak for the water plant. The remissior^f this debt would form a splendid present. If in addition a C.S.I., could be conferred with an encouraging.etter from H.lfi. the Viceroy I do not think there would be any question of his tractabi- lity for some time to come.All I have oald to H.E. on this subject so far is that I am confident that Governrnent v/ill take an e irly opx )ortunity of sliowing its satisfaction for his comp liance with their demands.

After having agreed to establishment of Blockade Post on January 4th, Shaikh revisited me on January 6th, and said that ifter deleberation with chief persons of Koweit he had come to conclusion that our establishing blockade post would affect his honour and lower his dig nity. He therefore desired to retract his assent. \t the time and at a long interview next day 1 did my utmost to dissuade him from going back on his word, exhausted every argument and even resorted, to menace. In my opinion Blockade Post is more than ever necessary at this junc ture and I can only recommend a stern rebuke from you ascribing his failure to comply with our demands as due no doubt to bad advisers and threatening him with inter- venti on ^f his obstructive attitude continues. 'eanwhile export of all goods to Koveit from India and Gulf Ports should be suspended pending settle ment of matter. This action will bring to their senses Koweit merchants,who,anxious to avert supervision,are behind Shaikh and will shaJfr® them that they have made a great miscalculation. If considea ed expedient Shaikh might be required to deport AHT'AD al FARSI and YUSUF al DUWAIHI his principal advisers, who are also violently anti- British and anti-Bin baud and wli&lt;s«h I suspect of being at the bottom of most mischief here. | Politi cal A • •To - Navy,- Basrah, FEBRUARY 8.

Main points summarised below:- (1) subject of leakage through Koweit had been consider ed by conference which de ided that establishment of post was clear military necessity. This was moderate measure intended to safeguard his dignity in preference to taking our own military measures and was of course purely■tempo rary and for war purposes only (2) it was inconsisla nt with his position as an ally to refuse simple demand' of this kind.

If Allah will, all your undertakings shall be successful and no hope of yours shall be disappoin ted. The consideration of what has passed between you and ub c .me near causing me some anxiety but we are pledged to follow your counsels and you will find me a true friend. X will never turn aside from this friendship and I wish to see nothing less than the exaltation of your government. Now the state ments which I laid before my friends Colonel Hamilton and Mr.Bill do not show even an approach to 8lacken4«^ ing in the giving of assistance for the suppression of the export of food so that I am surprised at this new arrangement which conflicts with my duties and inclinations, for which I was hoping to be rewarded by the Great British Government and the men associa ted v .ith it, until there came this rebuke in connec tion with what neither my predecessors nor myself were under any obligation to perform. When I refused to allow any tribe to take away even the smallest amount of food supplies, unless they had the autho rized government permit, I was careful to point out to these former that they must make it known that I am at the mercy of your government and that this thing had not been and could not be permitted under any circumstances. Kuweit, thanks be to Allah, is progressive md prosperous, owing to the clemency of the Government of Great Britain and in spite of what envious people hav said, it is we who are the real and sincere friends both in word and deed. You/ You are asking that we accept the carrying out to completion of your simple purposes by the appoint ment of two officers and four men for the organization of the blockade and you are solemnly promising us that this arrangement is temporary only and will be suspended at the terrrlnation of the war. To this I assent, bowing to your cormand, as is incumbent upon us. All honour to you in every event. I hope to continue to have the friendliest relations with you.

His weakness is in imagining himself to be a modern Solomon. He has scarcely ever been out of the principality and his angle of vision is therefore the narrowest. He is fond of money and power and I fancy would stop at nothing to compass his ends. On the other hand since he 'tried a fall 1 with us and was worsted he has, one hopes, learnt his limitations and that the power he loves so much, derives from us in the final count and is only his by our favour - One ho pas so but must boar in mind that at 53 ye? rs of age , he is too old to change his character - a character #iio3#has slwayo been difficile, antipathetic, morose.

According to figures supplied by Sheikh's officials quantities of principal article(s) now in town, and price, are:- piece-goods,175,000 pieces*total value about 2,700,000, rupees, 4,875 bags coffee at Rs.65/- a bag, 8,225. at Rs.48/-. 85,000 bags rice at RSi20/-. 6,500 barley Rs,13/-. 10,000 wheat Rs,25/-. 1,800 chests Rs .ioo. Total purchase price about 5,700,000 rupees. Also comparatively large quantities of mis cellaneous goods such as pepper etc, Elocka'de Officer is of opinion that amounts/largely exceed this and Mylrea tells me that nearly every house he visits has one or more rooms devoted to storage of p ^oods, which is quite unusual. It is of course impossible to make any accurate estimate of real total and customs figures do, not help.

Goods acquired could be utilized by Government to a large extent or resold at Basrah or elsewhere, so that loss should notr be great if any as rice, for instance, is Rs.SO/- a bag here and I believe Rs,25/- in Basrah.

Orders have been issued that no person or animal at all is to leave Ko.eit by night. By day animals and persons not carrying loads are permitted out by a certain route. Anyone disobeying these instructions is liable tobe fired on by ships. No craft is allow ed' to leave harbour by night - anyone doing so is liable to be, sunk by gunfire. By day system of passes will be instituted but in the meantime only water-and fishing-boats allowed to leave and they only after examination. Directly ships leave game will be.^in again merrily, and-as no troops avail- . able suggest (that) two monitors understood,to be now in Basrah be placed one each end of harbour: if filled with powerful searchlights (up to 3 miles) whole back of town and harbour could be lighted Up and permanent effect given to abcJve- orders. They would only have to stay till purchasing operations were finished If successful and success of latter depends to great extent on how effective our block ade measv^res appear of Koweit, It is essential to have two ships or monitors, as we can only observe one side of town and harbour and goods can be taken out of othe^r.

Other Ise mer chants will certainly not sell to Government as they would at once that we would then limit im ports! buying through private buyers is only possible chance and that a poor one. It is useless to threaten people of Koweif with putting in our blocfeade unless they sell: they would only delay matters and possibly in the end sell us a portion of their stocis ('. e have no reliable estimate of these - for instance we thinlc there are between 2 or 3 lacs (in) bags of rice a- gainst Sheikh's figure 86;000) rtdle they would at once remove all they could from the town. Words are no longer of the least use,and'if blockade is of real military importance action must be taken. Ships now here have to leave shortly for coal and water and in any case cannot carry out land blockade which at present is done by Sheikh's men who are quite in effective: it must be realised that whole place is lea—.led against us. Koweit will feel it'has again scored and as likely as not caravans just sent away will return: while it will be -prejudicial to our private buying as no one will sell much if they think there will be no blockade. If military authorities will provide 250 British ranks for blockade, possibly two field searchlights (up to 3 miles Eange) and 2 machine guns, and ifour launch is sent and one ship k'ept here, t /5% can make efficient blockade^in which case I agree with your proposal.

These figures are repa^ted by Koweit' to be much below real and no doubt are so. Perhaps l/3 of these goods will if not stopped find its way to hostile or quas^-hostile destinations(.) This means on figures given (that) about 2000 tons rice and 1000 tons other commodities will reach hostile destinations from' stocks now in Koweit. Considering enormous area over which demand is spread and- arrangements made to Check future consignments from India I do not think these quantities even if below real a figures are enough to justify undertaking -what amounts to military occupation of the town es- ■ pecially when we reflect that trade stopped there will at once begin to percolate through other channels. However this point is for G.H.Q. to decide. Watkins thinks if we. offer facilities to import goods from Koweit to Basrah free of Suss Customs duties leading Arab merchants (at)Basrah / will put up capital and draw off considerable portion of Koweit accumulations. This however does not apply to rice and wheat on which no duty is charged here.

I have told India that this force would be but little affected by its removal but. enemy*3 food supply in other. / theatres may be ameliorated thereby. I also, stated I consider for enforcing a land blockade one battalion is necessary, which must be supplied by India. When a decision is arrived at I will acquaint you at once of it.

Following telegram sent to Simla and London by General Baghdad April 17th# Begins. Question large imports through Koweit has again come into prominence# Large stocks of goods including food stu^is are at present in that town and it seems more than probable that among the caravans which come from the interior for the purpose of purchasing these goods there are many emissaris from trirces who make a profit by retailing these goods to our enemies. The removal of the Koweit blockade will make little difference as far as this force is concerned as owing to our recent successes on Euphrates. I do not consider that any J appreciable amount of food stuffs get through to the enemies forces opposed to me# It may however have an effect on other theatres of war and question of enforcing the blockade or abolishing it is resubmitted for consideration. Our preventJlive measures recently have consisted of (1) (Lemonstrances with Sheikh. (2) Sending «f two officers and four men to conduct tlookade arrangements and latterly (3) sending two of H.M's ships which ty threat of bombardment and use search lights have had a temporary effect in checking illegal caravan , traffic. ^ I consider that any attempt at preventing Illegal traffic will be futile unless m adequate cordon by land is established^ as the ships are unable control at night any movement of stores outside the rays of their search lights. The trade appears to have increased during the past two or three months and I now consider that the least number of troops which it will be advisable to send there, if it is to be abolished by force, is one battalion. The traffic is in the hands of many large merchants and Sheikh is not in a position to oppose the financial interests(interests) -^r of his principal supports nor those of the chiefs of the desert tribes. If the hlockade is to 'be enforced I request one 'battalion may be sent to Koweit for the purpose, I would undertake land it, and would place it under my command. I cannot however spare a battalion from this force. Ends. Addressed Koweit repeated Basrah who will please post copy to Bushire. Political Baghdad. Tfio Dy.

Bahrain where the political situation already somewhat affected by the acutely depressed state of^pearl industry would be adversely affected by the inevitable introduction of a system of passes . It is also probable that similar traffic would spring up between Persian Ports in Arabia. Purchase of surplus X/yyi stocks has proved ^successful as merchants can replace quicker than we can Buy. Under these circumstances it is improbable that prohibition if introduced would be effective and it is certain that it would arnruse almost as much resentment as does present blockade.

Occupation is only % real solution of Koweit question but if not feasible offer of Shaikh must be accepted at once. Discontent is rife in town: rich merchants seriously consider leaving and poor people complain bitterly of high prices while small pearling are lively to aggravate matters. All say that our failure to come to decision is due to weakness of our position, no one believes that we shall win war, and our re gained prestige is rapidly dwindling. Unless we choose one or other alternative now we shall certain ly be forced into military action later on when we shall incur all the trouble and odium without cor responding advantage.

Shaikh should also be informed that we are prepared to place iBasxi local blockade arrangements in his hands, subject to his accepting assistance of our blockade officers that with effect from one month hence no exports from India to Koweit will be allowed either by or steamer except on permit signed by Po litical Ap;ent or his authorised representative:that in granting such permits Political Agent will rely as regards local needs on advice of Shaikh who will thus be enabled to safeguard legitimate requirements of his territories.

On July 7th a meeting was held between Lieut* McGollum and myself on the one hand and Shaikh 'Abdullah, son of Shaikh Salim, who has been deputed by the latter to oversee exports from Kuwait and is himself in charge of the land exports, the Mudir of Customs, who is in charge of the sea exports, and Mulla Salih, a secretary of Shaikh Salim, on the other. It was decided that.a manifest system should be instituted to check the exports by sea and that the existing method of checking exports by land would be kept up by them for their own and our information. I particularly impressed on Shaikh 'Abdullah that his and his subordinates personally foing round and turning away persons who were of enemy persuasion, such as Shammar, Ajman, 'Aqail from Syria etc., would do far more good than any amount of written passes; he agreed to^ ' / this suggestion and A hope will act upon it. As regards the permit system for exports from supply India - there is a considerable/of goods still in the town so that there should be no question of shortage; we know roughly the needs of Kuwait and will issue permits monthly to the necessary amount in consultation with the Shaikh 1 s Representatives: Abdullah al Nafisi, Bin Sard's agent.agent, will inform us of tha amounts taken by caravans belonging to Sin Sa'ud for whioh he vouches and we will inmiediately issue permits to those amount9! aimilarly for any other properly vouched for purchasers.

Hamilton, not to unload her cargo which was subsequently overcarried to Basrah* An immediate improTement in the situation took place and on February leth Shaikh Salim accepted the blockade proposals without reserration* On February 22nd a British Blockade Officer, Lieut. D*V # McCollum, and four British Other Ranks landed at Kuwait to control the blockade arrangements* Though this Officer nominally receiyed ©Tery assistance considerable obstacles were placed in his way and there was reason to belieT© that goods continued to leare Kuwait which was full of foodstuffs and piecegoods, but as the posts were manned by the Shaikh's retainers no proof was forthcoming though it was eTident that while the personnel were Kuwaitis leakage was bound to continue* On March 15th there was a change of Political Attent, as Colonel H*S.A. Hamilton proceeded on leaTe and was relisT©d by Captain P *br* Loch* At the beginning of April sereral large cararans, aggre gating 4900 camels, purporting to be from Qaslm and other eastern parts of Bin Sard's territory, but in reality composed largely Of Miof enemy elementa or traders with the enemy, and oonaiderable numbers of bedouin with some 3000 oamels had congregated at Kuwait and asked for blockade permits to export Tery abnormal quantities of supplies of all aortst After reference to aaghdad It was decided to refuse these requests with the exception of a few which were properly Touched for. On April 10th H.Jl, Ships 'Lawrence* (Oommander L.H. Orozler) and 'SrambJe' arrlred at Kuwait and the next morning the headmen of the oararans and tribes were summoned to the Shaikh's palace to recelTe the answer regarding the permits. The Political Agent and the Blockade Officer interrlewed the Shaikh, inform ing him of the very abnormal quantities and kinds of goods exported in the preceding 15 months and of the still more abnormal quantities asked for by the carayans and tribes then In Kuwait. After some demur the Shaikh agreed to turn them away empty, but «hen the headman were called in his resolution failed and the orders had eyentually to be issued by the Political Agent. A letter was sent to Bin sa'ud explaining the matter and asking him to coma to some arrangement for the future regulation of traffic with ilr.Philby (an officer of the I.O.S. deputed to Bin Sa'ud from the staff of the OI t II Commissioner) and each oarayan leader was glyen a letter to the Amir (GoTornor) of his district explaining why he was brining no goods. During the suddeeding three days the tribes and cara- rana left, always passing in riew of the Agency so that it could be seen that no goods were taken out. Aa a precaution in Tiew of the large numbers InTolyed a machine pun was placed on the Agency roof and subsequently a second was mounted. On the last days news was recelTed that the one remaining cararan was smuggling out arms and ammunition concealed in their saddles and a guard of marines and blue jackets was landed and some of the oamels searched, but without! success. The turning away passed off quietly and after waiting a short time to see if there was any chance of getting goods out by driblets the cara-rans betook th^mselres to Bin Sa'ud oomplainlno- bitterly. Considerable resentment was arouaed in Sajd at the time but diad down owing to the sensible attitude talren up by'•3- « '7 ■f i r y /' Bin sa'ud who now has a properly aocredited rapreaantatlT® at Kuwait to Touch for his oararans# At the same tirce in order to aroid the occupation of Kuwait it was decided to try to settle the Kuwait problem by buying up all the stooVs held in Kuwait and to limit imports in order to preTent their being replaced, ; The effect of the action taken on April 11th was that on May 4th the Shaikh wrote a letter to the Political Agent begging that GoTernment would extend to him the same friendship and protection as his predecessors had received and pledging himself to complete responsibility for anything which might take place in his territory, while a marked improrement took place in the general attitude of the Shaikhs Officials. The Shaikh 1 s overtures ware submitted to Government but owing to some delay in their acceptance the Shaikh grew restive and the Political Agent was authorised dm June 3rd to inform him that Government were giving his letter their friendly consideration and that it was hoped that Sir Percy Cox would deliver their reply on his return to Mesopotamia. The purchases on behalf of Government amount to:- Hice •••••••••••«••« St?,V?53 bags. || Wheat 1,@40 ' Barley 2#900 Sugar ##•••••••««•♦• *7,805 Ooffee ••.•♦••••••#• 10§665 Pepper 350 * Tea •••••••••••••••• 1^65B cases* to a total value of R?. 86,52,943/1^/-. % but purchasing was stopped on June 2nd at the express request of the Shaikh to the Deputy Civil Commissioner, Basrah, and the Political Agent, as^personal concession to himself. It was, however, found that such enormous orders were being placed in India and in other Gulf Ports to replace the stocks bought by Government that further action became neces sary and on June 12th the Shaikh was informed that these p-oods could not be allowed to land pending the reply of Government to his letter and that the merchants could be given the option of shipping to Basrah bnder permit or selling to Government at cost price plus five per cent any goods which the Blockade Officer considered should not be landed at Kuwait# On June- 4 - Jxmo 26th th© S#S» 'Zayani' was ordered to oreroarry her cargo which included more than 21,000 packages, mostly foodstuffs, for Kuwait. On Jun^ 24th the Political Agent represented that occupa tion was still the only real solution of the Kuwait question, but that if that were not feasible the Shaikh's offer must be \ accepted at once as any capital we might hope to make out of the acceptance would be lost by further delayi discontent was rife in the town among high and low and our failure to come to a decision was^/due to the weakness of our position as regards the war. f % On June 28th the GoTernment of India issued orders that the Shaikh's offer should be accepted on certain conditions, which decision was communicated to the sHaikh in the latter quoted at length hereafter, while exports from India to Kuwait were to be prohibited except on permits signed by the Political Agent or his Hepresentatire and such executire action as possible was to be taken to prerent exports to Kuwait from other Gulf Ports. The following statement of policy was mad© 'While the GoTernment of India appreciate the desirability of checking trade with ♦ V Kuwait they do not consider this of sufficient importance to Justify the risk of an open breach with the Shaikh and 'the consequent necessity of military occupation with its possible far-reaching effect on other parts of Arabia'.

He was rather frightened of personal reaponaibility and expreaaed fear of our listening to tale bearera on which point he was reassured# On July 7th Shaikh Salim replied in writing to the same effect and a meeting was held between the Political Agent and the Blockade Officer and repreaentatires of the Shaikh headed by the latter^ son, 'Abdullah, who was appointed to superintend the whole blockade and in particular to deal with exports by land. It was decided that a manifest system should be instituted to check the exports by txaat sea and that the existing system of checking exports by land should be continued.
