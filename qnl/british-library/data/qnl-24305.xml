As we have already explained to you, that the Municipal Council has unanimously decided the liberty in the way of selling firewoods and Chan dals, the Municipality suggested a method by which the dues of the Municipality can be collected. The method is that the Bahrain Government should notify the Director of Customs and Port Officer, not to give back to the Nakhudas who import fire woods and Chandals from Batna and other ports, their rT Kols n unless they produce a Chit from the Manamah Municipality stating their payment of Dilala dues.

After Compliments. The Manamah Baladeyah Majlis will hold its sitting on Tuesday 19th instant(31.7.34)at 2 otclock Arabic time(9.00.a.m.) and I enclose the Agenda for the sitting which is to be held on Tuesday. u • Ux • 30.7.34 ll.ir.\V Agenda for the 8 th Sitting to be held on Tuesday the 19th H/Thani 13b3. 1. Khan Bahadur Abdur Rahman bin Muhammad az-Rayani to be thanhed for acting for the President during the latter T s absence. 3. Haji Ahmad bin Yusuf Falchru to be thanhed for acting for the Secretary during his absence also. 3. The Secretary desires to have pairing done to the Baladeya ^ 1 latrines situs ted on the sea-shore ana the enclosures for the animals m the Barden with tar the price of which Will, not be less than Is. ^ 00 /- including the wages of the painter and the cost of the kerosene oil. 4. As the Baladeyah Barden at Budhaibeyah was totally demolishe^ m accordance with the orders of II.E.Shaikh Hamad owing to the fact that it was harmful to the palace, the Secretary wishes that its area may be surrounded with hall-size rafters and wires and that the ground may be levelled, as it may, on some day, be used as a special play ground for the Baladeyah party or for some other use. Only wires will have to be bought,the price of which is not much as the Baladeyah have a lot of pieces of rafters. 5. The jetty of the slaughter house has been ruined m the middle portion of it by the sea. it is necessary to fill it m with T fashti T stones. Only 6 jollyboatoloads are sufficient for the purpose. formerly property of ^.bdur Rahman bin Abdul Aahhab and now owned by Ilaji Taha bin Bhazwan who wants to rebuild it, is nearly situated in the way,the owner has been desistea from rebuilding it as it is desired to have one half of it cut off so that the way may be wide. This would not cost the Baladeyah much as one third of the shop in question is a right of the Balcdeyah without paying any compensation. The owner will only be compensated for what exeeds one third. 339 6 . Shop No.1040 situated on the street of Bin atar ? s market2 . V. The tenants of the shops of Kaji Abdul Aziz Khunji have a^am put the bad-looking shades on the doors of their shops situated on the C-overnmentbHoad which is the finest road at Bahrain. There used to be }ike this last year but they were removed by the Baladeyah in accordance with a resolution passed the then Majlises. 8 -r After my return I found that most of the roofs of the markets have been played with as the shop-keepers have fixed sun-shades for air ventilation which are taken away when the summer time is over;thus the roofs remain in a Dad state. There will be trouble for the Baladeyah to have to repair such roofs as also the landlords will have to pay the expenses of such repairs. y. Amongst things which are unpleasant beside its being injurious to the public health is what the people ol the market do by using the roofs of their shops as latrines. It can be said that there is no Cleanliness though the Baladeyah is active in this way by sweeping the roads and lanes, in return of which the public through garbage on the market roofs. Some steps should be taken to stamp out this unpleasant action by having some watchmen enagaged to prevent those who do not understand what cleanliness and health are. Sd- Ali bin Husain Al Khalfan Secretary,Manaman Baladeyah 18th Rabi-eth-Tkani 13h3.The agenda for the meeting on Tuesday the 2nd Jamad ath-Thani 1353(the llth September 1934) 1. To read the report of the Inspecting Committee about certain places which wwre inspected by them on Monday the 24th Jamad al Auwal 1353(3.9.34). 2. Thd Baladiyah wrote a letter to the Political Agent about the discussions which took place in the last meeting of the Majlis re the measures for combatting malaria. 3. To submit a map for the artesian wells and places of stagnant water which are situated outsiae ana on the sea shore qf Manamah. 4. To discuss again the question about the appointment of Mukhtars(selected persons). 5. The Baladiyah summoned all the persons, namely the veg^able sellers, who signed the petition which was written against T Alwan bin f Abdul f Al and also the defenaant and enquired from them in the presence of the Inspecting Committee. They alleged that T Alwan purchases the fruits from the sailing boats and from the steamers and used to ask the owners of the fruits that Jhey should tell the people that the goods were sent through him for sale. That all consignments of fruits whether they belong to him or sent for sale through him used to be distributed among the shop owners by him. He replied that he did not purchase anything in the manner described by them but that the goods purcnased by him or sent through him are sold &lt;bn credit to the persons whom he trusted otherwise on cash payment. That he does not give on creait to the persons OJiis whom he does not trust or indebted to him. That if the Balaaiyah unaertake to dispose off the goods for him he has no objection. The Committee consider that f Alwan is correct^ as every person has the freedom to sell to any one he likes. if^xkiawEXKxpciAiwacHxpHrKKxxxx f Alwan shall, however, nave no right to purchase the whole load of the sailing boat which bring fruits and if he does buy i^the market people shall have the right to get a share on payment of the price in cash.- 2 - '}0 6 . On Saturday the 29th Jamad al Auwal 1353(8.9.34) ihe Inspecting Committee and myself met the Acting Adviser to the Bahrain Government with whom there was Mr.Nash, the State Engineer, about the sum asked for by the Company on account of the ice factory and about the sum due on account of the electricity consumed by the lights on the public roads and in the market. We showed him the letter which we received from (Mr.) Belgrave the Adviser to the effect that the Baladiyah should pay 10 per cent to the Company of the pay of the employees of the Power House. The Acting Adviser, (Mr.) de G-renier suggested:- 1. As the. Baladiyah and the Company each of them is correct in his statement, the amount claimed by the Company on account of the factory and the light consumed during the months of Rabi f ,I, Rabi f , II, and Jamad,I, should be left over till the return of the Adviser(Mr.)Belgrave. 2. It is suggested that the amount due on account of the consun&amp;ion during the month of safar should be paid as before, as the ^alaaiyah dia not write to the Company at the beginning of the month to put off the lights at 4 o ! clock at night. 7. Several persons from whom the Baladiyah claim money on account of the balance of the tax of the year 1352 were called before the Committe, but it is regretted that nothing beyond admitting the debt could be recovered from them. They asked to pay(by instalments) from 8 annas to Rs.2/-. If the the Majlis approves I suggest:- 1. Measures may be taken to recover the tax due from the market people and from the owners of the house. Large | sums are being due from them. 2. That destitutes and poor persons especially those who own houses should, siyject to the approval of the Majlis be dealt with under section 56 of the Baladiyah rules as there is no benefit to the -^aladiyah from them and by putting their names in the tax register are waisting time. Therefore it would be necessary to register their house again in two registers. One for the hmises fv'nm which tax will he recover*?// i ■and another for those who cannot pay. The question of any of them becoming rici^or a rich person becoming poor will have to be considered and the number will have to be changed There are so many numbers in the old books which doe not exist now. 8 . The petition received from the haukers should be discussed again. 9. I suggest that the notice No.7 of 1952 which makes it necessary for every one to pay the tax by the 7th of each month should be issued again ana that it is carried into effect. That persons acting contrary to it and ao not pay^ their receipts(bills) shoula be sent to the Police for immediate recovery from tiiem ana to apply the rule against feism them if they fail to pay. I solidte the approval of the xslhk Majlis and thatvthe Government may be asked to help the Baladiyah in executing the same. The reason for this is that the Baladiyah iaks took lot of trouble and has also given the trouble to the Courts. Besides^large sums of money have been lost by the Baladiyah. Persons who lease houses the tax on yearly terms and who will be required to pay/in advance are exempted from this. 10. Owing to the trouble which the ^aladiyah experienced on account of the bakers of bread and Kamach / who come from outside and without taking permission from the Baladiyah they open shops for Kamach and 6 akes and also persons who open hotels, the opinion of the ^ajlis is solicited, on the point of preventing them from opening such shops without kkg taking a pass from the Baladiyah for which they shall have to pay a small tax. This will be a source of income to the baladiyah ana will also ensure tne respect of the rules. 11 . I have collected lot of furniture which is not in use by the ^aladiyah but is left over from one year to another and thus spoiled. The orders of the Majlis are solicited for the sale^of the spoiled and also the good furniture which the Baladiyah can$ ao without it. 12. The Baladiyah have 5 cars of whicn two are used by the _ Baladiyah for their various work and the third is for the?^^-4- ^ d ' of the roads, the market and for use against fire.hrKac The other two cars are not in use and the Baladi/ah can do without them. One of these is a Morris and has spare new parts with it and the other is lorry(cluch). The orders of the Majlis are solicited for the sale by auction oi the two cars which the Baladiyah are not using ana that their price is being created to the Baladiyah. 13.

The Committee selected at the previous meeting gathered on Saturday the 6th Jamad Thani 1353 and reported about the individuals who came to their notice to be owing long outstand ing taxes. 2:. ; :.The submission of the Accounts Report of the Manamah Baladeyah income and expenditure for the month of Jamad Awwal 1353 after it had been examined and approved by the Finance Committee. According to therr report the income amounted to Rs.506V/l/- and the expenditure Rs.2990/7/~. Last year’s income was Rs.4082/2/5 and expenditure Rs.296l/l0/-. 3. Certain people experience some difficulty by the rush of water carriers as also water leaks out from their tins and drops near the artesian wells which are formed into pools. The Baladeyah has already incurred an extra expenditure in pouring oil on the place affected. In view of this, I suggest that a small tax should be levied on such people in the form of a ’Permit’ to be in the hands of a water-carrier in which he is to be warned and bound not to allow water leak at the time of its being carried. What.is the opinion of the Majlis on this point? 4.The question of the Mukhtars should be re-ppened. 5. In the previous meeting held oh 4th Jamad Awwal 1353, I asked the advice of the Majlis on the appointment of a farrash for the office as one was required but it was not accorded with the approval of the Majlis. I again draw the attention of the Majlis to the following if the Baladeyah Committee are pleased to have part of the income saved. (i)Ahmad Jasim and Abdullah Bahlool should be appointed as farrsijes because they did not prove satisfactory in the recovery of taxes and the office is in need for farrshes. (ii^Appointment of two others in their places. (iii)Appointment of one to be posted in the market for supplying(the Baladeyah)with part of the numbers of(^3 of shops situatea outside the markets as, though Abdur Rasul is carrying out his duties satisfactorily and efficiently yet if another fjabi»(tax collector)is appointed for the environs,the Baladeyah would get the whole of their dues and without delay. All of you should encourage all the tax collectors and not threaten them by dismissal etc.,when they come ana ask for taxes. I request the Presiaent and the members to look into this and not to think oi the pay oi these which is to be borne by the Baladeyah as taxes cannot be recoverea ana the affairs cannot be managea without the help of others. Anyhow the order rets with the Majlis.

The Inspecting Committee Qontinues/once a week on every Sunday and have summoned many people from whom the Baladiyah claims taxes as a result of which the Baladiyah have been able to include the balance aue from them in special book and also tne names of the persons who have been exempted from the tax. Do the Majlis want me to read the names of the persons indebted and the amount due from them and also the instalment which they have to pay henceforward, and also read the names of the persons exempted. 6 . On several occasions the question of the Mukhtars was discussed by the Majlis. It is hoped that you have been able to appoint them. 7. The Baladiyah tax on the Baladiyah sea jetties have been given on farm to Sa|ih bin ’Abdullah al ’Ummani for Rs.160/- This was done in the presence of Hajji ’Abdun habi Bushiri, Hajji Khalil Kanu, Hajji Muhammad bin Ibrahim al ’Uraiyidh for a period of one year provided he pays Rs.80/- as a security which have been received from him. The terms of the contract will be read. 8 . A sum of hs.1000/- was accorded for the roads but a sum of Rs900/- has been spent . The opinion of the Majlis is solicited about the labourers whether they be kept to work until the work and other roads on the market/is over or should be discharged ?9. Cesspits in the markets and in the roads have not been cleaned for some years. When the rain falls the water collects for some time. The roofs k&amp;xk fell down recently and were repaired by the Baladiyah through their labourers. What is the opinion of the Majlis if these pits are cleaned and the roofs are repaired before the rain comes which work will be done by their(Baladiyah) labourers. 10 lhat is the opinion of the Majlis about lands which are owned by the people but have no walls as a result of which they have become dunghills? 11. The employees of the Baladiyah should listen to the orders given to them by the person in-charge.translation. Agenda for the 15th Sitting to be held on Tuesday the 14th Rajah 1353. 1. The report of the Inspecting Committee who inspected some places on Saturday the 11th Rajah 1353 is to be read out. 2. Account of expenditure and. income of the Baladeyah for the month of Jamad Thani is to he submitted. The income amounts to Es.6829/2 and the expenditure Rs.3228/8/3. 3. What is the opinion of the Majlis about hawkers who roam about in the streets? The Majlis held on 2nd Jamad Thani 1353 thought of the consideration of taxes which are to be recovered from them after six months. The taxes collected upto the end of Jamaa Thani are Rs.325/-. 4. As many people dig up ditches in the streets of the Balaceyah to serve as cesspools for their houses. In these ditches sometimes carts and donkeys fall which is due to their being unattended to by their owners. Apart from that,they have been done contrary to the Baladeyah instructions and in narrow places. I beg to say, for the approval of the Majlis, that no cesspoools should be made except according to the Baldeyah instructions and alter payment of a tax for it and they should not be mane except on wide streets not be the width of which wouldyless than 16 feet. 5. As regards old cesspools, I suggest that they should be tilled up/unless they are on streets the width of which is lb feet. Those which are on wide streets,a tax should be levied on them. 6 . Whenever owners of such cesspools want to have them cleaned, they should first inform the Baladeyah so that they may arrange for the mud only to be carried away for which a tax should be levied according to what the Majlis fixes. Anyone who leaves the mud in the street before informing the Baladeyah he will be fined and sent to the Court. 7. The Baladeyah has started repairing the cesspools situaiea in the markets and the streets in accordance witn the decision oj. the Budget Committee. TRe work is being carried out by the/street coolies. Repairs to the rest of the streetsand markets have been stopped owing to the fact that winter is coming and rains may fall According to a majority of votes aganist two votH^Qast by2 the Committee,Muhammad bin Irhamah and Jasim Buchiri have been recommended for employment. The former has been appointed ana it is for the Majlis to say whoishould be appointed out of the following Jasim Buchiri Yusuf bin Abdur Rahman and Ibrahim Qambar. J.M. h. &gt;translation. Afenda for the sitting to be held on D rr, OQ4-V, Tuesday the 28th Hajah 1353. 1. The report of the Inspecting Committee who maae inspection, on certain places on Wednesday the 22na Rajab 1353 is to be read 2. I went through the reports of the Majlis for the years 134u and 1347 hut could not find anything regarding the opening of the road which is to the northern siae of the garden o$ Haji Khalil bin Ibrahim Kanoo as there was no mention too regarding the construction of the northen house / property of Hamdeyah al Basreyah. I obtained the Tapu Deed from its owner ana on reading it I found that it was constructed.on the force of this Tapu Reed. From this it will be shown that the road between her house ana the garden of Haji Khalil is a long existed one and was not maae by the Baladeyah as Haji Khalil said. The Tapu Deed oi this house and that of the house of Muila Abbud will be submitted to the Majlis for their opinion and orders. 3. Formerly vegetable ghee used to be cleared from -the Customs after inspection o$ the Baldeyah receipt of payment of Balaaeyah taxes and after which the ghee used to be given to its owner. But since some time^the vegetable ghee has been given to its owner and after that such owner pays the Baladeyah taxes. It is probable that some owners of this sort oi goods receive their goods and do not report to the Baladeyah that they have done so , this will cause the loss of the Baladeyah dues. Other people import vegetable ghees but say that it is oil on which no tax can be levied. What would the Majlis advise? Can the Balaaejsah be allowed to recover a tax on such oils as they uo in the case of vegetable ghee. I request the Majlis to ask trie Bahrain Government to issue orders to the Lirector of Customs ana Port Officer,Bahrain, to supply the Baladeyah with a copy oi the manifest of such goods so that the Baldeyah may be able to recover their taxes. 4. I find it necessary to add a provision in the Balaeayh rules to the effect juss should not be burnt ana beaten witnin the limits of Manamah permanently ana in the narrow streets adjacent to houses made of saaf though it belongs to its' owner. outTranslation. 2.3 Agenaa for the 17th Meeting on Tuesday the 12th 3 ha T ban 1353 (the 19tn November 1934). 1. To read the report of the Inspecting Committee about certian house which they inspected on Sunday the 3rd instant (11.11.34). 2. As directed by the Majlis on 14th hajab 1353(23.10.34) , . - • t / lie I have complied with/order about the shop which was demolished when it was opened in Colonel Barrett T s road/and which is owneu by T Umar bin T Abdur Rahman al T Abdul Wahhab al Khalifah. 3. I have also done in accordance with the order of the Majlis held on 18th Jamad al Auwal 1353(28.8.34) about the house of T Ali al Furaikh which was demolished when the said road was opened. . 4. I have written to the Director of Customs tnat he should not diliver the vegetable ghi before the Baladiyad dues are being recovered. The Budget Committee, however, suggested, after seeing the different kinds of ghi, that the tax should be taken from all imports from Europe and Japan and not as was previously decided,for the reason that it is imported under be various names and it would/improper to leave one kind ana charge the other. The orders of the Majlis are solicited. 5. The orders of the Majlis are solicited as to whether owners of lands situated on tee Captain Prior T s road may be allowed to build on the side of road as was decided when the road was opened or the Balaoiyah should take from these for the widenixig of the road lands/whenever tney intend to build vide section 19 of the Baladiyah Byelaw. 6 . As the rainy season is up 1 .solicits the orders of the Majlis about the purchase of sand for the roads and for what amount. on ,Colonel Banett T s road 7. The work on the market shed/is about to finish and I solicite the orders of the Majlis as to whether it should be painetej and if so whether red colour should be used or tar.8 . The labourers working on the roaas nave 'been discharged after theyhave cone tne work of cleaning and roofing of 56 cesspools both in the market and in the important roaas. Six Kaurajas of Chanaals(rafters) 50 mats were used,the price of which amounted to Rs.136/-. The rest of the cesspools will also be repaired, shortly by the labourers employee for cleaning. There are only few(cesspools) remaining in certain H uarters. 9. The pay of Muhammad bin Rahmah and of lusuf bin f Abaur Rahman al Mutawa 1 is to be fixed. 10. Difficulty is being experienced by the people about annas not which are worn out as they are/t&amp;ken b/ the market people. When the Balaaiyah allows the tax collectors to accept the same they become accumulated in the naladiyah treasury ana when ever they are given to a labourer or other person he refuses to accept the same though slightly affected. On the other hand if the -^aladiyah were to refuse accepting the same, they will not be able to get their taxes. The orders of tne Majlis are therefore solicited on this point.- rr^^ SSai. 2 ?

The Electric Committee held a meeting in which the Engineer of the Bahrain Government was present on Saturday loth inst.(24.11.34). They discussed about the requirements of the Ice machine and it was agreed that the Engineer may order what is required for tne Ice machine. The meber Khalil K&amp;noo, however, was of the opinion that some of tne requirements referred to in the engineer ? s letter No.15/53 may be left out. He said that only an iron tank,Yulid ? and a punkah may be ordered and that their price will not exceed £.40/-. He thinks t^at the rest is not necessary. As there is ample time, the reply to the Engineer’s letter has been postponed till the opinion of the Majlis has been obtained on this point. 6 .

The Balaaeyah nas taken up paintingAtop portion of tne chabrah which has been completed, ihe lower portion has not yet been painted owing to the fact that certain landlords ao not agree to it puid prefer that tne colour of the lower portion may be like that of the iron plate itself, what is the opinion ol tne Majlis on this? 9. The motor-car station situated near the Police-station requires painting, miat would tne Majlis say ii it is^painted with tar. lu. The lialaaeyah nas dispensed with tne services oi tue collector of taxes on Amaras No.1,upper rooms ana stores wno is called Muhammad bin Irnamah as he ran mad. Ibranim Ganbar uas been appointed in his place according teethe previous proposal ol tne Committee. May he be given tne same pay as that oi tue previous collector or less by 5/-Rs which may be given to Muhammad Jalar Collector of Amarus No.2 ana the farsnan in tne market(shops on tne ground) , the ground; because he has been drawing a pay oi AG/nS.since ne was first appointed in the Balaaeyah upto now. he deserves an i i increase m ms pay. 11. The Balaaeyah slaughtered 4 sheep on the day on which tne meat-sellers refused to slaughter. The Balaaeyah made a lass oi Rs.7/0/3 although the meat was sold % l/4/-Ks. a ruba. 12. The letter of Abdul Husain bin Abdul Farim al Busneri m which he asks to be given the contract of general cleaning will be submitted to the Budget Committee to-aay ana their opinion will be put up to tne Majlis. 13. Owing to the approach-of tne month of Ramaanan 1 suggest that this year the Balaaeyah may not purchase ant sheep for slaughter.' A - 1 The reason lor this suggestion is that tne Balaae/an T s object in slaughtering was to help the poor people while most of these people aid! not purcnase iroui tne Balatieyah. If tne Balaeyah intends to slaughter the sale price would be l/4/-its. It would be better if the Balacieyah gets an undertaking from all the meat-sellers that they would not sell a ruba of mutton for more than Rs.l/4 and a ruba of beel lor more than l/-Rs and that an Alan may be issued to this effect warning the defaulters that they mill be punished by the Govt. This m%y be done only during tlie month of Ramadhan. By doing tnis.the poor people can be protected and the Baladeyah can keep Aer money in her safe as it is possible that the sheep may result in profit or loss. In addition the time of tne Baladeyah employees will not be spoilt in the sale of meat and the upkeep of tne sheep. Anyhow the order rests with the Majlis. 14. The Majlis will not hold sittings,as is usual, during tne month of Ramadhan. 15. Gan the Inspecting Committe of arrears of taxes stop their fonctions during Ramadhan ? lo. what would the Majilis say about keeping tne streets and market lighted in tne night upto dawn during Ramadhan? 17. Should we write to the Govt.to issue orders for the following as a mark of respect for Ramadhan or the Baladeyah can do it. 1 .oof 1 ee-shops and hotels snould not be opened during the day time. 2 .Amusements are prohibited in the night and day,inside the houses and in tne market. 3.Smoking in the day-time in the market and streets is prohibited. 4.lime for the bakers to bake should be fixed. J.M.'&gt;381. TT- ■ Translation. Agenda for the 9th Sitting to be held on 2na Thul Eijjah 1353(7.3.53). On this occasion I fine it advisable to put up the following points 1. Most of the tenants of houses quit their houses while they are indebted to the Baladiyah for their taxes. The Baladiyah knows nothing as to when such tenants quit the houses and leave and thereby the Baladiyah lose tneir dues. It is necessary for the landlord to inform the Baladiayh when he lets , his property and also when such tenants leave the place. Such information should be furnished to the Baladiyah in writing. This is in accordance with the decision of the Majlis held on 23ra Thul Qaada 1348 and also Baladiyah Alan No.38/1348 dated 21 st Thil Hijjah 1348. 2. Most of the property are sold or transferred io spme other person while the Baladiyah have no information of the fact and have the name of the former owners written down in their registers. It is better that the Baladiyan should issue an Alan to the effect that anyone who sells his property, he ought to inform the Baladiyah at once in writing. The Tapu Department should likewise inform the Baladiyah of such things. 3. Many of the hpuses and shops bear several numbers and in view of this it is not possible for anyone to know the real number. Many houses bear no number. In my opinion, from the beginning of the new year the numbers should be replaced with new ones which should be mane in proper order. We will nave also to divide the town into four parts. 4. This office requires stationery such as books and receipts printed which we will have to order from outside from one of the presses at Karachi. These are required for the new year. The Ealadiyah are also in need of an Arabic typewriter like the one which is in the office of the Bahrain Govermhent.m ' TRANSLATION, Agenda for the 20th Sitting to be held on Thursday the 16th Thul Elijah 1353. (21st March 1935). 1. Submission of the accounts of expenditure and income of the Balaaiyah for three months,ie.,Shaban, Ramadhan ana Shawal after they have been inspected and verified by the Finance Committee of the previous dissolved Majlis.

Ten workmen are required for a period of two months before the commencement of summer, to wotk on the roads and steets'of the town and get them levelled and also to clean the g^aden water stream A cart is also required for watering the trees along the roads. One catt is available in the Baladiyah but we will have to secure a donkey either by purchase or by hire. 5. As the Baladiyah have to know in detail, at the enu of each month, the arrears of taxes and vacant places etc., each tax-collct- or should, at the end of each month, submit reports on the subject concerning his quarter. The absence of such reports meahs that his(tax-collector T s)duties have not been fully performed. 6 . In the register of the Baladiyah there are long current accounts with certain merchants. No doubt, sich accounts cause scrutiny and investigation in the long run. In my opinion, such accounts should not be opened in the Baladiyah. It is better that debts should be paid at once and dues recovered at once. 7. Within the limits of the Baladiyah there are deserted and The details are shown below:- Income of Shaban ...Rs.4834/6/0 (last year) . .

The Baladiyah have been taking great pains to get such places cleaned and to see that no dirt is cast in them. A tax should be levied on such places for getting them cleaned v or they should be walled in. J.M. \ / ■ • *15o Translation. Agenda for the twenty-first Meeting to be hela on Thursday the 30th Thul Hijjah 1353(equivalent to the 4th March 1935). 1) . I have started cleaning the Garden water drain from the mouth of it in accordance witJa the instructions of the President, but I found that the water was not running to the sea and also found that the end portion which is 160 feet long, 3 feet deep and 2 feet broad, was covered with ’furush' 1 . This coaering requires requires demolishing and re-building every three months which means a loss to the Baladaiyah of a sum of Rs.300/- per year in the least. I submitted the matter to the Inspecting Committee who inspected the situation and reported that this portion should be repaired as follows. Covers of cement blocks 3 feet long,3^ feet broadband 2 inches thick should be made and kept in use permanently. They can be opened easily and the Baladiyah would not incur any expenses by using these. In fact,the opinion of the Committee is correct. I mane out a specimen cover for your inspection. 2) . The said water drain now flows on a ground belonging to Jama 1 Mosque where the water gathers and forms dirts whic£, on most occasions, stop the drainage. Therefore, it is necessary that a straight water drain up to the sea should be mace passing through the sea road. In this way the dirts disperse away and the sea water constantly cleans up the drain up to a distance of 370 feet. 3) . There are hawkers who sell assorted sweetmeats which are really dangerous as they are made of oils dangerous to the health and are sold openly in the streets. The makers of these are dirty people. I have shown some of these stuffs to Br.Holmes the Medical Officer who reported tnat they are harmful to the health. 4) . Reference the minute of the 20th Meeting held on 16th Thul Hijjah 1353 regarding the house of Hasan bin T Ali bin Hibail which was cut off by the Baladiyah for the Muharraq Roaa, at Ras Rumman. I traced the previous minutes ana found that the Baladiyah should compensate him with a piece of land. • ^ ^ — * £.5/ land to the northern side of his house equal to that which has been taken from him ana what is demolishea should be rebuilt. He has, however, the option of having the Balaaiyah builh for him a wall along his house on the southern side and give him a land on the northern side of his house equal to what has been taken from him with a sum of rupees to help him build the remainder. 5;.

The Balddiyah expected to get Rs.16,000/- from the tax on shops but at the close of the year 1352 the total amount realised amounted to Rs•13,249/. In order to meet the deficiency they increased the tax on the market properties!shops) from one and a half anna in the rupee to two annas in the rupee or 12 £ per cent on the rent. There is no record in V.O. that before passing any resolution the Baladiyah should ask the sanction of the P.A.. In the year 1932 the Manamah Baladiyah issued Regulations about cars and Taxi fees without the previous sanction of P.A. As foreign subjects were concerned the matter was referred to the Bahrain Government vide letter at page-43. Another letter was also issued(page-46) but I find that tne original was not sent to the Adviser but filed at page-47. There is nothing on record to show why the letter was not sent nor the office can give any reason. As Ik the interests of foreign subjects are looked after by the P.A. all resolutions or other rules should have the sanction of the P.A. without which it cannot have the legal effect. 14.5.'34 E.O. and C.O. shd see. Unless such an order is approved by the P.A. no foreign subject need obey it - that principle is well understood^ or was in the past. Matter must be Carefully examined and a warning gi/ven to the Baladiyah - prefeshbly verbal to President by me.

According to the previous arrangements all fire-wood and rafters(chandals) should he sold through the Baladiyah broker namely Mir Q.utbuddij^ and brokerage at the rate of two per cent is charged of which half goes to the Baladiyah. According to the letter addressed to Shaikh ’Abdullah the importers of such wood are at liberty to sell it either directly or through a broker provided the tax of the Baladiyah(one per cent) is paid May this be filed,please ? ^ 20.5*. 34 But why shd the Manamah Baladiyah address Shaikh ‘Abdullah ? 2. When and how was the previous arrangement made ? Were we not consulted ? 20.5.34 A.P.A. The Secretary of the Manamah Baladiyah says, in his letter under reference(page-158) and also in his previous letter(see para 3 of letter at page-144),that according to the instructions which were given by the Adviser they should refer matters, which require considere.tion, to Shaikh ’Abdullah bin ’Isa. It appears from item 14 of the Baladiya’s letter(page-147) that the broker was appointed by the Muharraq Baladiyah the reason for which they referred the matter to Shaikh ’Abdullah, presumedly, because he is the President of the Baladiyah. 2 . I understand th&amp;t the above arrangement was made about one year ago, but the matter was not referred to us for sanction^ wk p n 21 -^ 34 &gt;vjrShaikh T Abdullah spoke to me on the 23rd May 1934 in the presence of Shaikh Hamad about the arrangements for selling wood. He said that it was proposed to do away with the single Government dallal and to let anyone who got a license sell wood. The licensees would be compelled before they took, their wood from the Customs to show the Customs the receipt that the Baladiyah f s l/o had been paid. I asked whether it was certain that if there were a large number of dallals, instead of one under Government control, that they would not get together and that the price of wood would be put up - instead of fluctuating only slightly according to the quantity that was available in the market. He admitted that this might happen, but thought that it would be possible to control it through the licenses. I said that provided the arrange ment had adequate safeguards for the poor and did not cause loss of revenue to the Baladiyah I had no objection.
