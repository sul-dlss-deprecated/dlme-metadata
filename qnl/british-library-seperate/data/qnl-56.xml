            the most part the legibility of the text remains unaffected. The main exception being a
            series of holes, which run through ff 3-10 and ff 28-47; the largest of these holes are
            approximately 2cm in diameter, and these do obscure the text in places, which can result
            in some of the content being difficult to read. The paper is also fragile, and should be
            handled with care.Foliation: The foliation sequence commences at the front
            cover with 1, 2, 2a-2d, 3-83, and terminates at the back cover; these numbers are
            written in pencil, are circled, and can be found in the top right corner of the recto
            side of each folio.Pagination: A pagination sequence is also present between ff
            3-83; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled, and can be found in
            the top outermost corners of each page.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The volume consists of letters sent outwards from the Bushire
            Residency, along with correspondence sent by the Resident, Captain William Bruce, while
            away from Bushire. It covers the administrative proceedings of the Bushire Residency,
            and matters related to the British force stationed at Bassidore [Bāsaʻīdū] on the island
            of Qeshm. As well as political affairs in the Persian Gulf current in 1822.Some of the correspondence in the volume also relates to
            legal proceedings initiated by ‘Abd al-Raḥīm Khān against the Resident in the Bombay
            courts, in relation to the Resident's handling of the estate of the late Muḥammad
            Nabī Khān. It also covers the events surrounding the Resident's summons to Shiraz
            by Prince Ḥusayn ‘Alī Mirzā, and the unauthorised signing of a treaty ceding Bahrain to
            Persia; a set of affairs that would lead to William Bruce's dismissal from the post
            of Resident of Bushire in December 1822.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter book</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Prince-Governor of Fārs, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Bombay, Political and Services Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Muḥammad Nabī Khān</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>George Willock</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>'Abd al-Raḥīm Khān</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Bassidore</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sheraz</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000159.0x000012#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
