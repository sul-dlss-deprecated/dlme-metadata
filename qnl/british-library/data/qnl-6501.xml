December 1895. o CONFIDENTIAL. (6704.) Memorandum bv Sir M. Durand on the Situation in «/ Persia. AS I have now been nearly a year in Persia, it may be desirable that I should submit for orders my opinion upon the existing condition of affairs, and upon the steps which should be taken to improve our position in the country. 2. Some time ago I asked Lientenant-Colonel Picot, Military Attache in this Legation, who lias acquired a considerable knowledge of Persia, to make a careful inquiry into the state of the administration, and to let me have all the information he could collect on a variety of points. I append to this Memorandum some interesting papers drawn up by him. Colonel Picot’s facts are, I believe, substantially correct, and though I see no prospect of the introduction of the drastic measures of reform which he recommends, his suggestions are of much value. I have also appended to this Memorandum a statement by Nawab Hasan Ali Khan, Oriental Secretary, [showing the revenues of Persia, and a note on the antecedents and character of the Sadr-i- Azam, or Prime Minister. These papers, and the Reports of my predecessors, afford so much information regarding the internal condition of Persia, and the state of her foreign relations, that it will be unnecessary for me to enter upon a detailed examination of the circumstances which I find surrounding me. It will be enough for any proposals I may have to make if I set out the leading facts. 3. There is no doubt that judged by European standards, the internal condition of Persia is very unsatisfactory. The Governorships of provinces and other high posts are systematically sold by the Shah to the highest bidder, and sold for short periods, so that the country is plundered and the administration disorganized. The Central Government is weak, and is defied not only by the provincial authorities, but by the Mullas, or priesthood, wlfose power has become greater than it should be. The finances are in disorder, and during the last three years there has been an annual deficit of about 50,000/. Heavy arrears of pay are due to the troops and the civil establishments. The army is a worthless rabble, without serviceable arms or drill, or the semblance of discipline. There are no trustworthy Courts of Justice; there are practically no roads, so that the expansion of trade is greatly hampered; finally, the country is being flooded with copper money, which is causing much loss and suffering to the poorer classes, and is giving rise to bread riots. Among the principal causes of this state of affairs are the greed and timidity of the Shah. It is his want of firmness and courage that has led to the regrettable increase in the power of the priesthood, for whom the Persians have little love, and his perpetual [668] ' B Reriew of internal condition.

The Heir-Apparent is a man of neak character, and allows his northern Province of Azerbaijan to be dangerously misruled. The Zil-es-Sultan is allowing disorder to spread in the south, if he is not joining with the Mullas to excite it. The Shah’s third and favourite son, the Naib-us-Sultaneh, who holds the office of Commander-in-chief, enriches himself at the expense of the troops, whom he neglects and robs. The Sadr-i- Azam has gradually drawn into his own hands almost the whole work of the Government offices, which he is unable to discharge. Though clever and bold in his management of the Shah, and in fighting his numerous enemies, he has shown little administrative capacity or power of organization. He trusts no one, and tries to do everything himself, with the result that the various public Departments have practically ceased to exist, while he himself is completely overdriven, and the business of the Administration is carried on in the most unmethodical and slipshod manner.f Moreover, the centralization of powers in the hands of the Sadr-i-Azam has led to another evil. Having everything in his own control, he draws from various sources an income generally estimated at something between 70,000/. and 10G,00GZ. a-year; and the removal of any administrative abuse would almost inevitably deprive him of a portion of this sum. The Sadr-i-Azam declares that the profits of his various'offices go to his relatives and subordinates, not to himself; but this, if true, seems to make little practical difference. I am afraid the Sadr-i-Azam can only be regarded as himself a serious obstacle to all reform. Finally, it must be pointed out that the failings of the men now r in power are not solely responsible for the present state of the country. The Administration is, and has been for generations, corrupt right through. The first idea of every Persian official is illicit gain. Ho doubt the proceedings of the Shah and others who ought to set an example tend to increase the prevailing corruption, but they have not created it. Its roots lie deep in the national character. Of all the Asiatics with whom I have had to deal, the Persians appear to me to be the most shameless liars and thieves.^ j ^- nc ^ there is no patriotism upon which one can work. Patriotism is replaced here by national conceit, which makes the Persians look down with contempt upon all other countries, but will not make them sacrifice the smallest personal interest for the good of their own. Altogether it cannot be denied that the internal condition of Persia is far from promising. 4. The outlook with regard to her relations with foreign Powers is, from our point of view, not much more satisfactory. Though so feeble as to be at the mercy of almost any assailant, Persia is inclined to adopt towards all Powers but one an aggressive and peremptory tone. She encroaches steadily on the frontiers of Kelat, Afghanistan, and Turkey, and her reliance on the good nature of England is so complete that she frequently permits herself to treat our representations with neglect, and even at times with a careless levity amounting to contempt. Towards Russia, on the other hand, her attitude is one of respect and fear. * The Shah’s methods of collecting money from private individuals are numerous, and at times amusing. Before we left Tehran last May I used to meet him driving about on a round of visits. Every Notable whom he honoured in this way had to produce a “ pishkesh ” of from 50£ to 200/. If His Majesty makes a good shot at a moufflon, as he often does, those about him at once subscribe a purse of gold pieces as a token of their admiration. He is fond of playing chess in the afternoon for two or three gold pieces a game. His opponent always loses, and His Majesty pockets the gold. It is said that not long ago he was caught in a snowstorm when out shooting. He found shelter in a hut on the hill-side, and before leaving it he asked what “ pishkesh ” the owner meant to offer for the honour done to him. Eventually the man produced six Russian imperials (something under 5/.), which the Shah carried off.—H. M. D. f The Sadr-i-Azam’s office is a black leather hand-bag, into which he thrusts his letters and telegrams as he receives them. Every one addresses him direct on every conceivable subject, so the bag is always bulging with papers ; and at any spare moment he takes out a few and passes orders on them. Once a paper leaves this bag it is forgotten, and very likely lost, for the two officials who act as his Secretaries are incompetent to a degree that cannot be described. Yet they practically transact all the important correspondence of the Persian Government.—H. M. D. ^ The Sadr-i-Azam tells me he has lately found out that the Minister of Posts, son of the Presi dent of the Council, personally steals from the post-office parcels which he believes to be valuable. The Sadr-i-Azam can do nothing, because the President of the Council only laughs at his son’s proceedings, and is too strong to be attacked. As to untruthfulness, I have hardly ever spoken to cue Persian statesman about another without being warned that I must never believe a word the other says.—11. M. D. V v . y ’&gt;. ? r P « iJ If3 Shjtfeels the pressure of Russia along her northern border from the Caucasus to Meshed, and she regards as almost certain the eventual absorption of Northern Persia in the dominions of the Tsar. As almost all the leading men at the head-quarters of the Government are northerners, and as the capital itself is in the north, this has a very marked effect upon the policy. The Shah and his Government seem to be constantly haunted and oppressed by the sense of their proximity to Russia. There can, in fact, be no doubt that in Tehran the influence of Russia is predominant, and I am afraid there can be no doubt that it is antagonistic to our own. I may add that, according to general belief, the Hostility of Russia to influence of Russia is steadily exerted to thwart any measure of reform or reforra * progress in Persia—to prevent anything which could tend to strengthen and solidify the country, and arrest its downward course. 5. This is one aspect of the case, and it must be admitted that, both with Despondency of regard to the internal condition of Persia and with regard to her foreign Sadr - 1 ' Azara * relations, we have some ground for disquieting thought. The Sadr-i-Azam, when in one of his dismal moods, is fond of saying that all is hopeless—that there is not a gleam of light anywhere. But there is something to be said on the other side, and I will state briefly what seem to me to be the more hopeful features of the case. 6. In the first place, with regard to the internal condition of the country, Disorganization not of it seems to me that the prevailing disorganization is not in itself of a desperate a des P erate nature * nature. It is true that things are out of order, from the European point of view, but I doubt whether they are much more out of order than they ordinarily are in an Asiatic State. In some ways there has been a considerable advance in Persia during the last twenty years. For example, trade has increased, and a more or less regular system of posts and telegraphs has been established. Judged by an Asiatic standard, Persia is, in fact, not very far gone. I have seen native States in India in a worse condition, and have seen them rapidly recover prosperity when taken in hand by the Indian Government. Though the finances are in disorder, Persia has great natural resources, and practically no debt. That is the foundation of everything, and a capable official, with some power of organization, could, in a few T years, if given a free hand and supported by the Shah, make Persia a very flourishing country. The people, with all their falseness, are intelligent and docile. They are obedient to their Shah, whom they regard as the first monarch in the world, and their lazy good temper, and want of fanaticism, make them easy to manage. Even the recurring deficits are not so serious a matter in Persia as they would be else where. Every one is accustomed to irregularity in the payment of salaries, and the salary 7 of a Persian forms a comparatively unimportant part of his income. Salary or no salary, he makes his living somehow—the soldier chiefly by money- lending, and the civil official by extortion of various kinds. A considerable part of the deficit, too, is caused by the existence of an excessive pension list; and when the Treasury is short of money the pensions are not paid—-which is rather an advantage than otherwise.* Altogether, though the condition of Persia is certainly more or less dangerous, it is not, in my opinion, really desperate—not such that one need look for an immediate or very speedy dissolution from internal causes. If 'the Persians were left to themselves they would probably get along well enough in their own slovenly w r ay for generations to come, and a very moderate measure of reform would make the country as prosperous as it ever need be. 7. Again, though Russian influence is the strongest foreign influence in Limits to Russiar* Tehran, and though it is generally believed that Russia is cynically 7 working influence * for the ruin of the country,f y 7 et it is very evident that the influence of Russia is by no means exclusive or unlimited. It may be stated with tolerable accuracy that no other European Continental nation carries any weight at all in Persia, but England undoubtedly carries great weight. Having regard to the geographical position of Russia, it seems to me British influences strange that we should be as strong as we are. In spite of the indifference we % It is said that for less than one year’s payment made to himself the Shah will often continue a lapsed pension for another life.

Possibility of a friendly understanding with Russia. have shown at times, our connection with Persia has sufficed to preventfor many years any material encroachment on Persian territory, or any sene jle curtailing of Persian independence, and thinking Persians know this well. Much as the Russians long for the cool mountain breezes and fertile plains of Khorassan, they have had to lay their line of advance in Asia through a sandy desert. Practically, the Persian frontier is where it was nearly seventy years ago. It must, I think, be admitted that this is mainly due to the respect of the Russians for the power of England, and the fact is recognized here. INo doubt we have lost some opportunities, and might be stronger in Tehran than we are, hut the Persian Government still looks to us for support against Russian, dictation, and Russia still hesitates to take any step with regard to this country which would he likely to give us serious umbrage. 1 do not think, therefore, that we need be altogether dissatisfied with the state of our influence in Persia, or that we need apprehend at present any important move by the Russians against her. This may be a mistaken view, and the death of the present Shah may be the signal, as many predict, for Russia to step forward and declare a Protec torate or annex a province. But I see no reason to believe that she has such an intention. At present Russia seems to me to be very sensible of her weak ness in Asia. Tier frontier officers are boastful and aggressive in their attitude, but nevertheless she shows much nervousness about her Central Asian posses sions, and I think it is only natural that she should do so. She sees herself in Asia with small and scattered forces, far from thir base, possessed of very faulty communications, and surrounded by a population of doubtful temper. She sees us with superior numbers, backed by arsenals and abundant supplies, and able to draw’ on a fighting population numbering tens of millions, which we seem to be able to trust as she cannot trust her Turkomans and Uzbegs. Political developments in Europe, the effect of which we cannot calculate here, may of course make Russia decide at any time to go to war with us; but, judging merely from her attitude in Asia for some years past, I cannot but believe that she fears us, iu Asia, quite as much as we fear her, and more than we ought to fear her. Even from Persia, where we have not a regiment, we could now, by a little judicious manoeuvring on the Turkoman frontier, arouse excitement and alarm from the Caspian to Merv. Hereafter, if, for example, a great war should clear the air in Europe, and set Russia free, as she was set free by the Crimean War and the Turkish War, to devote herself to the East, and consolidate her recent advances, she may. he willing to provoke us in Asia. At present she does not seem to have any wash to do so; and, if this view is correct, there is no reason to anticipate any serious attempt on her part to disturb the existing situation in this country for some time to come. 8. Supposing that the stole of affairs is approximately as I have described it, the general conclusion would be that the internal condition of Persia is unsatisfactory, and to some degree dangerous, and that she is too much under the influence of Russia; hut that there is no cause for immediate alarm on either account, as the country may hold together for a long time if left to itself, and Russia does not seem to be inclined at present to enter upon any course of action which would bring her into serious conflict with us. 9. The question then arises what steps should be taken to maintain and improve our position in Persia, and to guard against future eventualities. I will not stop to discuss the preliminary question whether any steps should be taken at all. It may possibly be argued that things seem to be going fairly well as it is, and that practically we want nothing more in Persia than we have got, hut such an argument would be quite untenable. Our position in Persia as a check upon Russian expansion is not an altogether bad one, but it is not as good as it has been; and unless we are vigilant and careful to make use of our opportunities, it may easily become worse. It may become rapidly and seriously worse if Persia should fall into bankruptcy and disorder, and thereby afford to Russia legitimate or plausible ground for interference. Moreover, we have to think of Persia as a market for our trade. It is evident that from that point of view the existing situation leaves much to be desired. 10. The first course which suggests itself is the radical change of policy which at one time found an advocate in Sir Henry Drummond Wolff. If Russia is not prepared to make any serious encroachment upon Persia, it occurs5 (W) T T v. liv K to one as possible that we might come to a friendly understanding with her, that we might enter with her upon joint action for the reorganization and development of this country. Such a scheme is very attractive. At present the Persian Government plays off Russia and England against each other, with the result that neither can do much, and that Persia remains misruled and undeveloped. If once England and Russia fairly came together, we might divide Asia between us, and we could do anything we liked in Persia without the the smallest difficulty. A joint demand for the necessary reforms would be Joint demand for irresistible, and there would probably be no attempt at resisting it. A refoms ' guaranteed loan, sufficient to permit of the reorganization of the finances and the construction of certain public works could be easily raised, and we could then proceed to open out the country by land and water communications, to extend the area of cultivation, to increase the revenue, and to create a con siderable trade. The country has so many natural advantages, and is in many ways so well off even now, that much detailed interference with the administration would not be required. A little steady pressure on certain main lines by the English and Russian Legations acting together would make Persia in a very few years a solvent, flourishing country, and in course of time it should become a comparatively rich one.* Both England and Russia would gain largely from a commercial point of view; but the question is whether Russia would ever fall in with such a scheme, and whether, if -so, we could hope to carry it out without disagreement and ultimate trouble. This seems to me unlikely. It is possible that the proposal, if made by us, might be accepted by Russia, especially if it formed part of a larger scheme for the general settlement of our relations in Asia. It may also be argued that if, when asked, Russia refused to join us in saving Russia would be Persia from misrule and possible ruin, and developing a trade lucrative to Sous^refoSr^ herself, we should at least have made her show her hand. Nethertheless, I am inclined to think that it is very doubtful whether the experiment should be tried. My belief is that Russia would evade our proposal, and would make capital out of it at our expense by denouncing us to the Shah and his officials, who are all interested*in maintaining the present state of things. If Russia Danger of entering on did join, she would sooner or later play us false, and leave us to press alone unpalatable reforms which she would secretly oppose. Our ways are not her ways, and in the end we should probably be sorry we ever tried to work with her. She might perhaps agree to divide Persia with us, but I do not believe she would seriously help us in trying to regenerate Persia. It must be remembered, too, that the coercion of Persia by Russia and England in the manner indicated would tend to destroy in her all spirit of independence, and would accustom her to be treated as a subordinate State. That might be rather a dangerous lesson for us to teach her. Altogether, attractive as the scheme is at first sight, I do not think it holds out a good prospect of success. That, however, is a matter of opinion, and it might be worth while to sound the Russian Government as to the principle of the proposal. 11. I have not tried to ascertain the views of the Russian Legation on Reticence of Russian this subject. The Russian Minister, M. de Biitzow, is a most agreeable man, t^Russianpoiic 831 '' 1 but he is very reserved and cautious. He would not, I feel sure, commit P ° 1Cy himself to an opinion, and it would not probably be desirable for me to sound him unless authorized to do so. I have given him more than one opportunity of discussing Persian affairs in a friendly spirit, but he seems to be afraid of speaking to me on the subject. 12. If we are not to try the experiment of coming to an understanding British action indepen- with Russia for the regeneration of Persia, it remains to be considered what we dent of Ru9Sia - can do independently of her. At the outset of this inquiry we may, I suppose, put aside all idea of ousting or overcoming her influence, and of gaining an exclusive or predominant influence ourselves. It is true that Islam is still a living force. * The country about Tehran itself affords a good example of what might be done. Some little water is brought down by underground channels from the long line of mountains 6 or 7 miles away, and wherever it is used for irrigation fine trees and crops spring up; but the bulk of the water supply is allowed to run to waste. Every year, with the melting of the snows, brown torrents pour across the plain, cutting deep channels through the stony soil, and destroying the so-called roads, and making it almost impossible to take a carriage outside the rampart. A few well-built dams along the foot of the range would bring under cultivation a great stretch of fertile country now lying barren.—H. M. D. [ 668 ] C6 X Possibility of forming a Mahommedan League.

If the principal Mabommedan countries which still retain their indepen dence could he brought to see the advantage of banding themselves togetl^r for defence against the Power which threatens all alike, England with her 60,000,000 of Indian Mussulmans would he the natural head of a great League which would hold Southern Asia from the Bosphorus to the Punjab, and would command the sympathies of Mahommedans all over the world. When I was in Cabul the Ameer used to mourn over the fatal dissensions among the Mussulman Powers. But those Powers are too hostile to each other, and too selfish, ever to unite for a common end, and perhaps it is just as well. It might not he prudent in our own interests, even if it were possible, to make independent Islam too formidable. Failing such a combination it is, though conceivably possible, in the highest degree unlikely that we shall ever have a chance of ousting Bussian influence from Persia, and bringing the country under our political control. We must evidently be content for the present to aim at something less. 13. Very little, I think, can be done to improve the position through the medium of countries other than Russia. The more foreign capital is invested in Persia the better, from one point of view. Everything of the kind tends to consolidate the country and draw upon it the attention of Europe. But Persia is not in a condition to attract foreign capital, and until it does so foreign nations will not trouble themselves about it. I have found the German, Austrian, and Belgian Legations very friendly, and have received help from them in minor matters ; but for all practical purposes England and Russia are the only Powers represented in Tehran. We must depend on ourselves for anything we want to do in this country.* 14. That being the case, we must, I fear, resign the hope of carrying any general scheme of reform, and making Persia a well-ruled, flourishing country. Some administrative improvements we may gradually succeed in introducing, but the task will not be an easy one, for even if Russia does not oppose us, every reform must involve damage to powerful vested interests, and there is apparently no one in Persia who has a real patriotic desire to set matters straight. For example, the sale of Governorships is the cause of untold oppression. Our great friend, the Firman Farma, was recently appointed to the Governor ship of Kerman. For this appointment he had to pay to the Shah 10,000/., to the Sadr-i-Azam 2,000/., and to others smaller sums. These gifts will have to be repeated, perhaps increased, next March, if he is to keep his place for another year. Pie is now said to be squeezing the people very hard to lecoup himself and provide the State revenue, and the same thing is going on all over the country. But it is useless for us to advocate the proper payment of officials and the abandonment of the farming system, while the Shah and the Sadr-i- Azam have both so much to gain by it. Nothing short of a joint authoritative demand by England and Russia could suffice. The Shah makes, perhaps, 100,000/. a-year in this way, and the Sadr-i-Azam from 10,000/. to 20,000/. Take another example—the army. One of the first necessities in Persia is a body of trustworthy troops to sppport the authority of the Government. But any attempt at reform in the army touches the Shah’s favourite son, who makes a large sum yearly by leaving the troops in arrears of pay, and miserably clothed, and without arms. But if we urged the regular payment of the troops, the Shah would not press his son, and the Russians, with whom he is on very friendly terms, would probably support him against our interference. Again, the immoderate issue of copper coin,or “black money as the I eisians call it, is doing much harm, and may lead to serious trouble. I he reason given for this unfortunate proceeding is that after paying the “ pishkesh demanded by the Shah for the farm of the Mint, which amounts to 26,000/. a-year, it is impossible to coin silver at a profit. This, I believe, is true, but the matter is further complicated by the discovery that the real farmer of the Mmt is the Sadr-i-Azam, who, in conversation with me, denounces the iniquity ot the Shah in extorting this payment and ruining the country. As one more instance of the difficulty of doing anything for the reform ot the Administration, I would cite the case of the Customs. There is no doubt * As one of the French Legation put it to me when I first came to Tehran: “ Ton and the Russians play the game; the rest of us look on and mark the points.”—H. M. D.I Ps f ' I V ) &lt; 4 k k 7 that the Persian Customs, properly managed, would yield far more than they do,#it the Sadr-i-Azam farms them from the Shah, and gives about 200,000/. a-year for them. By sub-letting them himself he makes a piofit of about 45,000/. a-year. Naturally, any real reform of the Customs system, which would result in the loss of this sum, must he a severe blow to him, though he says his brother and his subordinates intercept the money. These examples will perhaps suffice to show how difficult it would be for us to effect any radical reforms in the Persian Administration. By pressing tor them inconsiderately we run the risk, not only of failuie, but of making ourselves disliked by the Shah and the Sadr-i-Azam and other influential persons, and of driving them into the arms of Russia. . 15'. The sphere of our possible action is therefore restricted within comparatively narrow limits. We could, no doubt, by appealing to the cupidity 0 of the Shah, get a certain amount done. He will do almost anything for money. We might, for example, if we secured him a loan which would enable ^oPersto him to pay off the Regie debt, and to keep a large sum ot money tor himseil, pose of financial induce him to hand over to us the management of his Southern Customs, and to reorganization, let us try reorganizing his finances. But any such scheme involves, I fear the downfall of the Sadr-i-Azam, hitherto regarded as our one strong triend in Azam&gt; Persia, and before he fell he would fight desperately, backed by the Russian Legation. He is not an altogether blameless Minister according to European standards, and at times he has been far from satisfactory in his dealings with us. It is possible, as some believe, that since 1892 he has secretly gone over to Russia, but he certainly was with us once, and did much to further our interests, and though not a good administrator, he is probably as good as others, while he is personally most pleasant to deal with. So long as he seems This undesirable, inclined to be friendly it would, I think, be a mistake to force him into opposition for the sake of introducing reforms which might after all prove impracticable. I believe it would not be very difficult to overturn him, and in Home ways the Shah would be more manageable than he is; but it is better, in my opinion, to leave him in undisturbed enjoyment of the income he makes by ruling the country after Persian methods, and to confine ourselves to the objects which we may hope to attain with his co-operation. 16. Being unable to put forward any general scheme for the reorganization GeneraUme to be of Persia, or to advocate pressure on our part for the institution of any radical reforms, I can only recommend that we should adhere to the line of policy which we have followed with more or less energy for many years past. Our efforts will then be mainly directed to preserving the integrity of Persia, gaining the good-will, respect, and confidence of the Persian Government and people, supporting Persia to resist intimidation, watching the proceedings of the Russians, developing our trade with Persia, and taking any opportunities which may occur for advocating measures beneficial to the country. It remains to consider what particular means we should adopt for the accomplishment of these objects. 17. As to maintaining the integrity of Persia, I have already mentioned integrity of Persia, the widespread belief that at the death of the present Shah Russia will make some serious forward move. I doubt it greatly ; but I think we should admit the possibility that she may have something of the kind in contemplation, and should as far as possible guard against it. Though the Shah appears to be in excellent health, he is no longer a young man, and he tries hip constitution in various ways. It would be as well to prepare beforehand for his death, so that Necessity of prepara- when it comes we may know exactly what to do. Russia has more than once death. given an assurance that she desires to maintain the integrity of Persia, and both Russia and England have in one way or another recognized the Yali Ahd as his father’s heir. I think it would be desirable to arrange with the Russians a scheme of action to be adopted by us both in case the Shah should die in the Vali Ahd’s lifetime. A joint declaration by Russia and England in favour of the Yali Ahd immediately on the Shah’s death would, I believe, suffice to deter the brothers, here and at Ispahan, from any attempt to seize the throne, but we should settle beforehand what we are going to do, and should show the Russians that we are not indifferent in the matter. If the British and Russian Legations received general instructions on this point they could concert details here, and submit their views for approval. The question is whether Russia and England agree to support the claim of the Yali Ahd to succeed at his father’s8 I Weakness of Tali Ahd. His good qualities. Advisability of being on good terms with him. The establishment at Tabriz. Should be placed on better footing. death, the territories of Persia remaining undiminished and her political lights unimpared. Russia would probably be willing to come to terms with us about this matter, as the Zil-es-Sultan is showing renewed activity, and she is still suspicious of him. At all events, it seems desirable to try her. We must not, when the Shah dies, find ourselves without a plan of action, and uncertain what Russia means to do, with the result that we shall have to follow her lead, and perhaps have to acquiesce in some very unsatisfactory proceedings on her part. As to the Vali Ahd himself we are at a considerable disadvantage. He is weak and timid, and he has been brought up in a bad atmosphere, surrounded by a family clique of incompetent and untrustworthy officials, who belong to Azerbaijan, and are too much under Russian influence. Still, the Yali Ahd is not hopelessly in Russian hands. He has been to some extent strengthened of late by the Firman Firma, his kinsman, and our most open adherent in Persia. He has also taken into his service an English doctor, and has stuck to him in spite of all the efforts of the Russian Consulate; and some of the most important of his Azerbaijan officials have of late incurred the severe displeasure of the Russians, so that there is hope even of them. I saw something of His Royal Highness when he was here a few months ago, and I found that, though not prepossessing, he had his good qualities. He is less dishonest and less cruel than his brothers, and more open-handed than the Shah. He is also on the best of terms with the Sadr-i-Azam. If he lives to succeed he will probably make a better Shah than his father, and I see no reason why he should be more in Russian hands, unless he has already entangled himself in some secret engagement, of which I can find no indication. In these circumstances, it seems to me desirable to get on good terms with the Vali Ahd, and to increase our influence over him as much as possible. He has been sore at our decorating his brother, and the Sadr-i-Azam thinks we should do well to give him the Grand Cross of the Bath. In spite of the evident objections to so doing, I should be inclined to recommend this if it were not for the recent riots at Tabriz, which are due to the misgovernment of his officials and his own weakness. This would be a bad time to decorate him, but there are two things which I think w r e ought to do. The English doctor is very anxious to be made Surgeon to the Consulate-General, and to get an allowance of 150/. a-year for the appointment. His pay is low, and the Vali Ahd is poor, and, unless we give the allowance, I fear Dr. Adcock may be forced to leave him. This would be a great pity, for Dr. Adcock is a well-meaning man, and it is important to us to have an Englishman always at the Vali Ahd’s elbow. If the Vali Ahd dies before his father, which is not unlikely, the allowance will not have cost us much. If he lives to succeed the money will have been well spent. Secondly, I think the allowances of the Consul-General at Tabriz should be increased by at least 200/. a-year. At present they are not sufficient to enable our Consul-General to keep up his position. The statement appended to this Memorandum will show how unfavourably they compare with those of his Russian, French, and Turkish colleagues. We ought, I think, to give our Consul-General as much as the French give their Representative. If the increase cannot be managed in any other w T ay, I would recommend the reduction of the pay at Resht, where there is comparatively little to do. It is really important that at the head-quarters of the Heir-Apparent to the Persian Throne the official who has charge of our interests should be on a proper footing. By the measures I have suggested we shall do something to strengthen our hold on the Vali Ahd, and to prepare for the future. Our action will be noted by the Shah’s other sons, and will help to convince them, if they have any doubts, that we mean to give the Vali Ahd our support. It will have a quieting effect in Azerbaijan and throughout the country. We need not fear that we shall alienate the other sons. If the Vali Ahd should die, the next heir will turn to us the more readily for the knowledge that if we acknowledge him we shall back him actively. I have not overlooked the possibility that the action I have recommended may alarm the Russians, and stimulate them to assert themselves more forcibly at Tabriz; but both Mr. Wood and Dr. Adcock think there is no danger of this, l= N V \ r \ &gt; ■ ) * % 9 and though they may be somewhat prejudiced in the matter, their arguments a^ear to be sound. I see no necessity to consider now what we should do if the Vali Ahd were to die before his father. The nomination of another heir would then lie with the Shah. I will deal with this matter separately, I do not know that I can suggest any other measures of precaution to Knowledge that insure _ a quiet succession at the Shah’s death, and to guard against any Swouid 0 ^ the infraction of the integrity of the country, unless it be a definite and followed by corre- unconcealed decision on the part of Her Majesty’s Government that any frthe^outhwonM* 1011 occupation of Persian territory by Russia in the north will be immediately probably act as a followed by corresponding action on our part in the south. My belief is that deterrent * the Russians would forego much to keep us out of Southern Persia, for our presence there would be a perpetual trouble to them in the north, and would also bar their way to the Gulf, which they hope eventually to reach. It is a very serious thing to advocate the establishment of a British possession or Protectorate in Persia, for it is impossible to say to what proportions this might develop, or what exertion of armed strength it might entail, and our military resources are not capable of unlimited expansion ; but my impression is that even if we found it necessary to advance from the ports into the interior of the country it might possibly be desirable, from a military point of view, to have a portion of our Indian garrison—European and native—- stationed in the upland districts of Persia, and forming the nucleus of a larger force raised from among the Arabs, Bakhtiaris, and other tribes. At any rate, the Russians and Persians should, I think, understand that any encroachment by Russia in the north will result in our taking such measures as we may consider necessary to make sure of the Persian Gulf ports. This should act as a deterrent.* 18. In enumerating the objects of our policy as they appeared to me, I Advisability of gaining said we ought to try to gain the good-will, respect, and confidence of the fonfidlnceTfSian d Persian Government and people. This may seem a somewhat vague object to Government and™ 311 set before us, but the words are not meaningless. All over Persia we do now people ' enjoy a considerable measure of good-will and respect and confidence, and there are definite means of strengthening those feelings, which are of practical use to us. In the large towns we are perhaps no better liked than other foreigners, but in the country generally the English name still stands high. As an illustration of this I may mention an incident which occurred here a few days ago. The local Governor of a district near Hamadanis, like other Persian Governors, making haste to be rich, and in so doing he has fallen foul of an old Chieftain from the Kurd border. This man, who refused to pay as much as the Governor wanted, and who was possibly, as alleged, in the habit of lifting his neighbours’ cattle, was recently surprised by a body of 600 horsemen, who burned his villages, seized his property, and killed some of his people—men and women. He made good his escape after a running fight, and, leaving the country with his son and one or two attendants, he rode straight to this Legation, a distance of perhaps 250 miles, and claimed the protection of the British flag. He said he had heard that the English insisted on justice to all. He has now received assurances from the Shah and Sadr-i-Azam, and has gone away happy. A fact of that kind is not without meaning, and the reports of English officers who travel among the Turkomans, Bakhtiaris, and other wild tribes show clearly that at present they entertain very friendly feelings towards us. If we show more interest in them we shall strengthen those feelings, and throughout Persia we can win over men to our side if we choose to try. For example, the establishment of a Consulate at Kerman, and the appointment to it of Mr. Sykes, has been a very good move. Mr. Sykes is a capable, manly intercourse with young officer of just the right stamp. He has attached firmly to our interests Bntlsl1 officeis - one of the most important men in Persia, the Firman Firma, and has acquired Kerman Consulate. a great reputation for himself among the country people. It will strengthen our influence materially if we have more of this kind in other parts of Persia as occasion offers, and if our Representatives at Bushire and Ispahan and Khorassan are encouraged to travel and make friends among the Chiefs and ^ .ISot long ago the Sadr-i-Azam said to me that he did not believe Russia and England would ever divide Persia between them, because the Russians were too greedy; they wanted the Gulf, and would rather wait any time for that than take only a part of Persia, and let us have part.— H. M. D. - ^ r [ 668 ] \ D10 tribesmen. We need not excite the ready alarm of the Russians by too frequent journeys along their border, but I think we should spend some moif/ in encouraging travel elsewhere, and in establishing Agencies at important points. For instance, I feel very doubtful whether the Government of India are right in deprecating the establishment of a British officer in Beistan; and, under certain conditions, we might find it very useful to have a man in Shuster to help in the opening of the roads through the Lur and Bakhtiari country, but we must have picked officers, working with definite instructions and objects, not untried boys on leave wandering about and getting into mischief. Reform of currency. 19. There are other means by which we could gain the good-will of the people of Persia, notably by securing for them a respectable currency. ^ If we could gain the credit of restoring the circulation of silver, and saving the poorer classes from the suffering caused to them by the “ black money,” we should undo almost all, perhaps more than all, the harm done to us by the tobacco troubles. Copper is now at a discount of from 15 to 25 per cent., and all wages are paid in the depreciated coin; but, as I have explained, such reforms are difficult to bring about. Unsatisfactory attitude 20. As to the Persian Government, I feel sure we already enjoy their menr ian G ° vern ' confidence in so far that they believe we mean them no harm, but they think we are selfish, and not inclined to do much for them. Their respect I do not think we enjoy as fully as we ought to do; at least they have peculiar ways of showing it. I have been much surprised at the peremptory tone in which the Persian officials have at times permitted themselves to address this Legation, and at the semi-contemptuous carelessness with which in ^ other cases our repeated representations have been ignored or evaded. This may have been due to various causes: to over-centralization and overwork; to Oriental laziness; to the overweening conceit of the Persians, and their fondness for showing off; to the belief in our inexhaustible good nature. But whatever the cause, such behaviour should not be passed over. It is a mistake, from a practical point of view, to stand any want of respect from Asiatic Governments. I have therefore selected two instances in which it seemed to me that ue had not been properly treated by the Persian Government, and have pressed these somewhat seriously upon their notice. One case, in which the Persian Government directly refused to abstain from aggression on a disputed fiontier district, and was generally troublesome, I have already reported at length. _ In the other instance I found that a number of claims justly advanced by British merchants and others, and supported by this Legation,^ had. been allowed to remain for years unsettled, and that some of the Shah s principal Ministers, including the Minister of Justice and Commerce, and the 1 icsident of the Council, were personally interested in defeating them. ^ This seemed a very useful case to take up, and the Sadr-i-Azam declaring himself unable to overcome the resistance of the influential persons concerned, I hi ought the matter to the notice of the Shah. The result was that although the Mmistei of Justice and Commerce tendered his resignation, the Shah, nho can make himself obeyed when he chooses, insisted upon a proper settlement of each claim, and they were all cleared off* I hope that these two cases will have a good effect in Tehran. My view is that, while treating the Persian Government with ah possible courtesy, we should not allow them to trifle with us. We should, I think, do all we can to show our interest in Persia, and our desire for her welfare, but the Government of this country, which may be said to depend for its very existence upon our support, should be made to understand that any representation we may make must be treated seriously. A little wholesome fear, mixed with confidence in our intentions, will tend to make the relations between the Persians and ourselves very much more satisfactory than they are at present. 21. As to securing the good-will of the Persian Government, the question is what we can do for them. This question, unfortunately, is only too easy to answer. The Shah and the Sadr-i-Azam, who constitute^ the Persian ^ Government, want practically nothing from us but money. The Shah no * I would take this opportunity of observing that the Shah is by no means a “ Roi faineant. All important matters go to him for disposal, and papers come down from his Palace with long auto graph notes on them. These are often wide of the mark, but the fault is not entirely his. Ihe cases are in no way prepared for him, and he has often to decide on very imperfect information, s — He regards his officials as mere boys, and attaches little value to their opinions. H. M. D.7 &gt; 11 i \ f v. \ doubt would wish us to support him in case the Russians made auy in convenient d^and, and the Sadr-i-Azam will perhaps he glad of our hacking it into trouble again with the Shah, hut these are contingencies about which neither greatly troubles himself. What both really want us to do now s to relieve them of the burden of the Begie debt, and then let them alone to rule the country as they please. The Shah regarded the debt |r°m the beginning as a hateful extortion, and he resents it doubly now, when the Ml ot silver has largely increased the value in krans of the payment which has t( b made He thinks we could relieve him from the payment if we chose, and t if we were really friendly we would do so He does not beheve that Her Majesty’s Government is powerless to set aside the claims of a trading Company, and he never will believe it. The Sadr-i-Azam understands the question much better, but he also considers that we ought to help him. H s argument is that the Shall never gives him a day’s peace about the mattei but reproaches him incessantly for having introduced the Regie, and jays that he ^ personally responsible for the debt, and must find the money. The Sadi-i»Azam points out that it is most difficult for him to do this, and urges that, a his support of our schemes has brought him into the trouble, the least we c do is to come to his assistance. His Highness forgets that our support has probably helped to keep him so long in power, but it is, I think, natuial that le should feel as he does, and that both he and the Shah should be rather sore on the subject, for we pressed the Regie strongly upon them, dbe sum to be paid yearly is not large from our point of view, but the revenue of 1 eisia is little more than 1,000,000k,* and the yearly deficit of late having been about 50,000/., the payment of over 40,000/. moref as interest on the loan is a not inconsiderable tax. I need hardly explain that, as the pay of officials and soldiers is in arrear, the Regie debt does not make us more popular m Rersia. There are always plenty of people to point out that the revenues of the country are being eaten by the Feringi, while the Persian is denied his due 22. I do not know whether the good-will of the Persian Government s regarded as a matter of sufficient importance to make us incur any pecuniary obligation on behalf of it; nor do I know whether it would be practicable to come to any understanding with the Regie shareholders ; but what wou d greatly relieve the Sadr-i-Azam, and probably enable us to gam consideiable advantages for ourselves, would be the taking over of the debt on proper security, and the reduction of the interest to 3 or 4 per cent. This would save the Persian Government some thousands of pounds a-year; it would look well in Persian eyes; it would apparently cost us nothing, as we could borrow the money at a lower rate ; and it would put into our hands a very useful lever. Ho doubt we might find ourselves in the more or less invidious position of having to press for the payment of interest to ourselves, hut practically that is the position now, for each instalment has to be extracted from the Sadr-i- Azam by this Legation. We should incur no greater odium if the money were for ourselves, and if we made judicious terms as to the repayment of the principal, we might materially increase our hold on the Persian Government. They would, I think, give us almost any security we liked to ask, so long as we confine ourselves to the south..!, ; n I must admit that such a measure would not suffice to restore the finances of Persia to an orderly condition, but it would be a sensible relief, and I grea y fear that unless something of the kind is done the effect maybe to alienate the Sadr-i-Azam, who has undoubtedly been more or less sore with us since the ReMe days. I fear also that the end of the thing may 1m an appeal to the”Russians. They are apparently not unwilling to lend Persia money, and the Sadr-i-Azam has warned me that he will not be able to prevent the Shan from coming to terms with them if we do not help him. This may be mme y an attempt to frighten us, but I believe there is truth in what the Sadr-i-Azam Regie debt. Eagerness of Shah and Sadr-i-Azam to be free from it. Suggestion that Her Majesty’s Government should take over debt on proper security and reduction of interest. Danger of Persia applying to Russia for relief. * It ought to be nearly a million and a-haif, but of late years tbe revenues are not being ' f The deficit is exclusive of tbe interest on tbe loan, which has hitherto been paid from special sources. The last instalment was borrowed.—H. M. D. + It is possible that the Persian Government think we should be less hard with them it tfie money was ours. We should have to warn them about this.

Pecuniary assistance might lead to adminis trative reform. says. I reported not long ago how the Shah was tempted on the occasion of the offer made by the Ottoman Bank.* &gt; 23. But besides securing the good-will of the Persian Government, the grant to them of pecuniary aid ought to facilitate the attainment of the other objects of our policy. It should increase the weight of our advice when we oppose any attempt at encroachment by the Russians, and it should enable us to gain some tangible advantages for our trade, and in other respects. If we meet the Shah’s wishes in the matter, we may naturally expect him to do something for us, and this the Shah recognizes. He has definitely informed me that if we help him about the Regie debt he will throw open the Upper Karun to British trade, and will undertake to maintain security along the routes branching out eastward and northward from Shuster to Ispahan and Boojnoord. This shows that His Majesty is prepared to make some concessions, for he has hitherto been very nervous about any interference on our part with the Upper Karun. In case Her Majesty’s Government were disposed to consider the possibility of granting the help for which he asks, we should, I think, come to a most unmistakable agreement beforehand as to the precise nature of those concessions. We cannot be too frank in these ways in dealing with the Persians, who have no fine feelings about money matters, and whose way is to take all they can get, and if possible give nothing in return. 24. As to trade advantages, the difficulty is to obtain from traders them selves any comprehensive proposals for the general good of British commerce. The improvement of the very rough road between Bushire and Shiraz would be a good thing, and so no doubt would be the opening out of internal roads by which the produce of the country districts would be tapped. But I can think of no important objects to be gained other than roads, and the Persian Government have no money to spend upon public works of this kind. They have not 20 yards of respectable road in Tehran itself, where the main thorough fares are very bad indeed for wheeled traffic. The opening of the Upper Karun, and the establishment of a commercial centre at Shuster, would, I suppose, be a considerable gain, especially if the dam at Ahwaz could be repaired, and if transhipment at that place could be obviated by a system of locks. But English firms would have to find the money for this, recouping themselves by the sale of water to irrigate the surrounding country, and I cannot speak with confidence of the results of such an undertaking. 25. Trading matters apart, I think that the grant of pecuniary help to the Persian Government would give us a good opportunity for asserting ourselves more strongly in Southern Persia. I would press for a delimitation of the Pcrso-Beluch frontier, where Persia is constantly encroaching, and I would insist upon the withdrawal of the Persian flag from the Island of Sirri, if the Indian Government appear to Her Majesty’s Government to have made out a clear case. I would also let it be understood that, in view of our large interests in Southern Persia, we expect the Persian Government to show some consideration for our wishes in such questions as the appointment or removal of Governors. We could hardly make this an official claim, or a condition of any help given to the Persian Government, but they used to consult us in such cases, and I should like to be authorized to bring about an official under standing on the subject. We ought not to have objectionable men forced upon us in Bushire or such places simply because they have bid a little higher than the rest. I do not think there would be much difficulty in exercising some check upon bad selections if it were known that Her Majesty’s Government took some interest in the matter. Ho thing would give us greater weight in Southern Persia than the knowledge that if a Governor were not acceptable to us he would not be appointed. A few years ago this was practically the case, and I should like to see so satisfactory an arrangement again in force. 26. Even in the matter of administrative reform it seems to me just possible that the grant of pecuniary help to Persia may enable us to do some sensible good. I have no doubt whatever of this if pecuniary help were granted on a considerable scale. For example, the reform of the currency is, I feel sure, simply a question of bribing the Shah. If his present “ pishkesh ” were * 1 attach to this Memorandum a note sent to me some time ago by my Oriental Secretary Nawab Hasan Ali Khan, who is very much in the confidence of the Sadr-i-Azam. He wishes me to say that he is still of the opinion he then expressed.—H. M, D. / V' &lt;r'13 guaranteed, and a certain sum offered to him in hard cash, he would give ovei th^Vlint to the Imperial Bank, or any one else we liked to name. So it would he with other matters. If this Legation could dispose of large sums it could do almost anything it pleased with the Shah. Toothing could be more inexpedient than the grant to him of a yearly subsidy, which is what he wants. He would do nothing whatever if once the subsidy was fixed and secure ; but by a frank system of payment for value received we could get practically anything the Shah could give. He would appoint any Governors we chose to name. He would without hesitation depose the Sadr-i-Azam, who keeps his power simply because he succeeds in providing tlje Shah with money. The Shah s concessions, in fact, would be limited by nothing but his fears, by the threats 01 the Russians, or the prospect of a popular outbreak. It is difficult to put this point too plainly. I presume, however, that Her Majesty’s Government would not care to enter upon a policy of the kind I have described, or to lend the Shah a million and undertake the reorganization of his finances on the terms proposed by the Ottoman Bank, which would probably involve, as I have explained, the fall of the Sadr-i-Azam. I will confine myself, therefore, to a consideration of what we might effect by helping the Persian Government only in the matter of the Regie debt. I must preface the consideration of this question by stating that during the last few da} 7 s the Shah, while pressing for help about the debt, has twice formally asked me to obtain for him the advice of Her Majesty’s Government as to what reforms he should undertake, (C whether in the finances, or the army, or the administration of justice.” I would observe, to prevent mis conception, that I have not invited this request by holding out any hopes that the Regie Loan would be paid off. On the contrary, I have steadily declinea to admit that there was any likelihood of the matter being considered by Her Majesty’s Government, and have declined even to promise that I would make any recommendation to that effect. I have pointed out that such a measure of pecuniary aid would be useless to save Persia from bankruptcy, and that it was unreasonable to expect aid from England when Persia was doing nothing to help herself. It is possible that this argument may have suggested to the Shah that a request for advice about reforms might be a good move, but the request was quite spontaneous and unconditional. Of course, too much importance must not be attached to it. I he Shah, h he had once got his money, would always be able to find excuses for not acting upon any advice which he might have received, and, as I have tola him, he must know better than any one the causes of the present state of things. Nevertheless, I believe that both the Sadr-i-Azam and the Shah are at this moment really impressed with the serious nature of the position into which they have drifted, and that they might possibly be willing to do something in the way of reform if it did not involve too great a sacrifice. The Sadr-i-Azam tells me that the constant anxiety about money is becoming such a strain that he is getting quite worn out, and the Shah at his last interview with me spoke very strongly about it. It is just possible that the advice they receive may to some extent be followed. At all events, the Shah has deliberately asked for advice, and whether it is followed or not, I suppose it must be given. We have at least an opportunity for plain speaking, and even if much does not come of it the result can hardly he bad. I do not know whether it will be expected that I should make any suggestions as to the nature of the advice which should be offered, but I shall perhaps be excused if I say a few words on the subject. With regard to the administration of justice, I would suggest that it would be undesirable to enter into details. Whatever is said may be twisted into an attack upon the Mullas, who really administer what justice there is, and the matter is not one of the first importance. The Persians do not require an elaborate judicial system, and could not work one. With regard to the army, it is evident that the sound thing is to pay the troops regularly, and attend to their well-being in other ways, so that they may become a trustworthy force, upon which the Persian Government can depend for the maintenance of order. But the Shah does issue with fair regularity the [668] , E If aid were granted on a large scale, practically no limits to Shah’s concessions. But drastic reform would probably entail fall of Sadr-i-Azam. Therefore consideration should be limited to assistance in matter of Regie debt. Shah’s formal requests for advice.

However, the advice to pay the troops regularly and attend to their well-being can do no harm, I think. It will please the Sadr-i-Azam, who detests the Haib-us-Sultaneh, and the Shah may possibly make use of it to put some little restraint on his son. To make the Persian army worth anything at all except for purposes of internal order is out of the question unless it is officered by Europeans. I do not know whether Her Majesty’s Government would care to propose that any part of it should be handed over to us to train. Such an arrangement would have its advantages, but it would of course be much resented by the Russians, even if the operations of our officers were confined to the south, and the Shah would fight shy of it because it would cost money. If we made him profit by it we could, I think, get him to agree. With regard 'to the finances I would suggest a strong warning as to the results of practically forcing the Mint to issue excessive quantities of copper by exacting too high a payment for the Harm. Here we shall carry the Sadr-i-Azain with us to some extent, and if no great good comes of our advice, we shall at all events get the credit of having tried to stem the flood of “ black money.” Perhaps also it might be desirable to suggest the loan of a trained English official to inquire into the financial system and report to the Persian Govern ment on the matters requiring reform. The Russians would view such an appointment with jealousy, and the official selected would have many difficulties to overcome: but the Sadr-i-Azam might be disposed to accept the offer under certain conditions, and if we got a judicious man who would work quietly and not try to sweep too clean, we could in time, I think, do much good. The result of the offer might, however, be that the Persian Government would bring in some Frenchman or German. The abolition of the sale of Governorships, and the reform of the pernicious system of accounts described by Colonel Picot, should, I think, be pressed on the Shah. The latter piece of advice may perhaps give the Sadr-i-Azam an opening. I have said nothing about reforms in the Customs Department, which offers the most fruitful field for a large increase of revenue.* Every one is agreed that b} r the Customs Farm the Sadr-i-Azam will stand or fall, and it is, I think, to our interest at present that he should not fall. A warning to be less lavish in granting and continuing pensions would be desirable. Finally, though we could hardly go into the details of the Shah’s expen diture, he might, as he has asked for advice, be reminded that care in this respect is as important as anything. He could effect large savings in his Civil List if he chose to do so. In some ways he squanders money very reckessly. Both these warnings would be received with pleasure by the Sadr-i-Azam, and the Shah might pay some attention to them. 27. It may perhaps be argued that if we are to give the Shah financial help he should be made to pay attention to them, and generally to follow our advice. Of course it is true that if we give help we are entitled to expect that our advice will not be altogether disregarded. But I would not insist upon its being swallowed at a gulp. That would, I think, be a mistake. We must not expect too much, and the reforms suggested are very large. It would be better, I think, to put upon the Persian G overnment the duty they are trying to pass off upon us. I would give the best advice we can, and leave the Persian Govern ment to think over the whole question, only making it a condition precedent to the grant of pecuniary help that the Persian Government must satisfy us of its ability and intention, by increase of revenue or decrease of expenditure, or both combined, to balance its accounts for the future. I believe that the Sadr-i-Azam, making use of our offer as a lever, could do this if he chose ; and his doing so would mean a substantial measure of reform. 28. Before closing this Memorandum, which has grown to an unexpected length, there is one other matter upon which I must touch, namely, the * It is generally believed that at least jas much money goes to the sub-farmers, and to the traders who never pay the full duties, as reaches the Sadr-i-Azaui. That would mean a waste by leakage of a quarter of a million.—H. M. D. k / Y 4i a y J! i \ :« . \ 1 ^ S ■ vs 15 washing sf Russian proceedings. This is not a purely Persian question. So long as the Sadr-i-Azam is our friend he will keep us fairly well informed of what the Russians are doing in Persia itself, but he knows nothing of what is going on outside Persia; and this it is very desirable, both for the Government of India and for this Legation, to ascertain as accurately as possible. The Meshed Agency has hitherto been our principal centre of intelligence in this respect, and it does not seem to me that the arrangement has been altogether successful. I therefore asked Colonel Picot to go into this question also, with special reference to military considerations, and I submit a Memorandum by him on the subject. We must, I think, watch Russian proceedings from Russian territory, not from outside, if we are to know what is going on. I do Possible reduction not wish to travel outside my province, and will therefore say no more on this MesifeTand Relbt, point, except that if Her Majesty’s Government should think it desirable to and establishment of establish centres of information elsewhere it might be found possible to reduce o^ervaUon. 8 ° f to some extent the expenditure at Meshed and Resht. The Meshed Agency, however, is under the Government of India, and they may not agree in this opinion. _ &lt; _ S mm r of 29. I have now submitted my views and proposals regarding the situation foreg^g ^ e ws andf in this country. To recapitulate briefly, they are as follows :— proposals. Persia is misgoverned, and her condition is not satisfactory. Her finances are in disorder, her trade and resources undeveloped, and she contains some elements of disturbance, while there is no armed force upon which the Govern ment can depend for the maintenance of its authority. The influence of Russia, which is antagonistic to our own, predominates at Tehran, and it is believed to be exerted against the interests of the country. On the other hand, Persia has practically no debt, and her natural resources are great. Her internal condition is not hopeless, or such as to cause immediate alarm. And the influence of Russia, though predominant, is not exclusive. England has still a strong position throughout the country; and Russia, recognizing her own weakness in Asia, seems unlikely for the present to take any step in Persia which would seriously offend us. The general situation, therefore, might be worse, but it is not one with which we can rest altogether satisfied. It is not probable that Russia will combine with England in reorganizing the Persian administration, and developing her trade; and there is little help to be got in this direction from other European nations, none of whom carry any weight at Tehran. England by herself, especially if thwarted by Russia, cannot hope to over come the opposition of interested persons in high places, and to carry a scheme of reform which shall regenerate Persia. She can hardly hope, indeed, to carry any reform of radical importance, and must fall back upon her existing policy, contenting herself with maintaining the integrity and independence ot Persia; watching and checking Russian aggression ; gaining the good-will, respect, and confidence of the Persian Government and people ; developing trade; and taking such opportunities as may occur of urging measures beneficial to the country. With the view of maintaining the integrity and independence of Persia, it is desirable to make timely arrangements for securing a quiet succession on the Shah’s death ; and we should endeavour to strengthen our influence over the Heir-Apparent by keeping an English doctor with him, by improving the position of our Representative at Tabriz, and in other ways. We should also let it be understood that aggressive action by Russia in the north of Persia will immediately result in decided action by us in the south. In order to strengthen the friendly feelings entertained towards us in many parts of the country, we should encourage picked officers to travel among the Chiefs and people, and we should, as occasion offers, establish fresh Agencies at important points. We should also try to obtain for the people such benefits as a good currency. The Persian Government should be made to understand that they must not trifle with us in the future, as they have occasionally done in the past; but we should try to gain their good-will, and to help them in any way we can. Just now there is an opportunity of putting them under a great obligation by relieving them to some extent of the burden of the Regie debt, which they find very harassing. The Shah has begged us earnestly to help him in this16 / way, and has at the same time formally asked for our advice as to the reforms which might be made in his administration. I think we should give this adwle to the best of our power, and should clear off the Kegie debt by lending the Persian Government half-a-million at 3 or 4 per cent., on approved security, and on certain clearly defined conditions. These conditions should include advantages to our trade, such as the opening of the Upper Karun, and also a satisfactory guarantee that the revenue and expenditure of the Persian Government shall for the future be made to balance. The probable result of such action on our part will be the introduction of a certain measure of administrative reform, and the strengthening of our influence in Persia, especially in the south, where we ought to be able to revive it, and make it very strong. If we do not help the Persian Government in the manner indicated, we run a risk of alienating the Sadr-i-Azam, who has been sore with us about the Kegie debt, and of driving him and the Shah, whose greed for money is increasing with age, into some compromising transactions with Kussia. 30. I will only add that the present occasion seems to be of an exceptional nature. In spite of all I have said to prevent false hopes, the Shah and Sadr-i-Azam entertain the most sanguine expectations from the result of the recent elections in England. They are excited and elated by it, feeling con vinced that England will now take a serious and benevolent interest in Persian affairs. They are also more disposed than usual to be impressed by what is said to them. The attitude of Her Majesty’s Government will he closely- watched here, and any action taken now will, I believe, have a marked and lasting effect upon the future course of our relations with Persia.

I HAVE the honour to transmit, for your information, a series of papers embodying the result of an inquiry into Persian administration, and dealing with the question of interior reform. . . ... I have carefully borne in mind the necessity of retaining, as far as that were possible, those forms of government to which the people are already accustomed, and have therefore brought forward proposals under the form of modification rather than radical change. . . The difficulty really lies with the official classes, who are deeply interested m. maintaining the existing state of affairs, and in very many cases opposed to financial reform. . „ . . These papers will, I venture to hope, prove of some value, Part I presenting a tairiy accurate picture of Persian official life, and Part II offering many suggestions for better government. ° T P ~ I am, &amp;e. (Signed) H. PICOT, Lieutenant- Colonel, Military AiiachL Part I. —Notes on Persian Administration. No. 1. (Confidential.) For the purposes of administration the land area of Persia may be divided into provinces, districts, tc belooks/ J and villages under Governors-General, Governors, Deputies, and Khedkhodas, or village Headmen. The Governors-General and the more important Governors purchase their appoint ments at Tehran, where they are offered for sale to the highest bidders. These again effect sales of the minor appointments, and so on clown the whole length of the official ladder. The appointments are generally for one year. On the departure of the successful purchaser to the province, a Memorandum showing the revenue and expenditure for the year is placed in his hands, no mention, however, being made of the purchase-moneys. The revenue is derived from direct and indirect taxation. The direct is that levied on land, forming the main portion of the revenue; the indirect that from the customs, road taxes ( &lt;f rah dari”), octroi, special guild taxes, and tribal taxes. This direct and indirect form of taxation is what is known as the “ asl ” or real revenue. The basis of the land revenue is the village. There are in Persia two sorts of villages for purposes of taxation, viz., those owned by individual proprietors, and those owned by the peasants. In the first case the proprietor is alone responsible for the collection of the taxes; in the latter the Khedkhoda. The tax is estimated roughly on the cultivated land, on the water supply, on cattle, and heads. No regular system can be adduced, local circumstance, custom, and ancient right being among the many factors. Both cash and kind payments are made, the cash revenue being derived from such cultivation as vines, rice, and comprising also poll and cattle tax. The indirect taxation will be dealt with separately. Under the head of expenditure are included army expenditure, buildings, repairs, remittances of taxation, salaries, and pensions. As already stated, the direct and indirect taxation form what is known as the “asl” or real revenue of the country, but in addition thereto is another tax called the “ fart),” or additional. “ Farh ” may be termed an extra levy in cash, proportionate to the cash payments of the “ asl” revenue. It ranges from to 5 or 6 krans on every toman of the “ asl” tax, and has gradually taken root as part of the system of taxation, though it forms no part of the revenue of the country at large.

The Governors look to the “ farh ” as their special perquisite, and through its means recoup themselves for their initial purchase-moneys. 'The privilege is grossly abused, double and treble the accepted amount being often squeezed from the people. The lat^ are accustomed to this quasi legitimate tax, and would be content to accept it were it not so grossly exceeded. The high sums paid to the Shah give the Governors a good excuse for manipulating public funds to their own advantage. The army may be left unpaid, heavy reductions made on the salaries and pensions, &amp;c.; new expenses may be created, for instance, in the Province of Khorassan, where the revenue is registered at 500,000, expenditure at 420,000, surplus at 80,000 tomans; the Government will reduce the surplus to a vanishing point. With the co-operation of the Accounts Department of the capital the annual accounts will be falsified, and large sums directly peculated. It w r ould be difficult and useless to enumerate the various methods of obtaining money, but enough has been said to show the shifts to which the Governors are obliged to resort with a view to recover what they consider their rightful dues. The burden, as a matter of course, invariably falls on the great producer, the peasant. No. 2 .—The Accounts Department, or “ Daftr.” The “ Daftr,” or Accounts Department, is the great accounting Department of the State. At its head is a Minister (“ Vazir-i-Daftr ”) nominated by the Shah, and assisted by a staff of “ Mustauffis,” or Accountants. These Mustauffis are recruited from Irak, where certain families have provided Accountants for generations. They generally have a very elementary education, and undergo no special training. The duties of the Daftr concern the whole accounts of the kingdom, and comprise the preparation of the Ministerial Estimates, and of all branches of the public service, the compilation of the Budget, the issue of Memorandums showing revenue and expenditure ; finally, the compilation and audit of all accounts. One or more Mustauffis are set aside for the accounts of each province, Ministry, or Department. These men carry out the duties already enumerated, centralization being the first and last word of the system. To suit the exigencies of array administration a separate Military Accounts Office has been created. This branch is nominally subordinate to the Daftr. The Military Accounts Branch prepares the estimates for each regiment and province for the information of the Daftr, and for insertion in the Budget. It also compiles estimates for the expenditure required in each Department of War, for buildings, arsenal, arms, &amp;c., and keeps the account of expenditure. At the end of the year accounts are submitted by each Governor, Minister, or Head of Department, and are taken in hand by the special Accountant of the Daftr already spoken of. The Memorandums serve as the basis of check, receipts as a rule serving as vouchers for expenditure. One important exception must be mentioned. For more important items of expenditure the receipts alone are not accepted; in their place a “Barat” or written order is required. This Barat is drawn up by the Mustauffi, and after receiving the signature of the Minister of the Daftr is sent on for the approval of the Sadr Azm and the seal of the Shah. This Barat system enables the Daftr and the Sadr Azm to pass in special review all heavy disbursements, and though the Memorandums may have authorized the expenditure, yet the Governor or Minister is held responsible until the Barat replaces the receipt. A great power is thus relegated to the Sadr Azm, who acts as a final referee. Very heavy sums are sometimes paid for bribes to the higher authorities for these Barats. The system of audit in the Military Accounts Branch differs but little from that in the Daftr. The Barat system is also in vogue, the Naib-es-Sultaneh (Minister of War and son of the Shah) exercising great power in respect thereto. The accounts are finally centralized in the Daftr, but that Department interferes but little with its sister branch owing to the personal influence of the Naib-es-Sultaneh. The practical outcome of the system is to give the Daftr complete and irresponsible control over every branch of accounts, over the estimates, the expenditure, and the audit. Its staff forms a powerful and interested corporation, and its work is submitted to no scrutiny. It is true its final statements are submitted to the Sadr Azm, but that official has no competent organization to examine the accuracy of the work. The Sadr Azm deals with the Daftr very closely, but not in the sense to be desired. Another cause of the absolutism of the Daftr may be found in the difficulty, not to say impossibility, of the uninitiated to read the peculiar character adopted by all accountants of the Mustauffi class. 4 £ &gt;19 &gt; V i r &gt; ^ i V i\ N No. 3.— The Army and the Minister of War. % . Previous to the reign of Fateh Ali Shah and his son Abbas Mirza, the army was organized on an irregular footing, except for the partially regular artillery. Chiefs binding themselves to furnish a certain number of troops, cavalry or infantry, during times of war. Only in the early part of the century, with the appearance of European officers, was the regular system introduced. The recruiting is based on the village system, each village being held to furnish its quota of recruits. There is, however, no regularity in the system. In the first place, the rough calculations on which numbers are based were made long since, and have not been revised; and, besides, the present dynasty having come from the direction of Astrabad, first took the northern provinces, and thence drew their men and material for the subjugation of the rest of Persia. 'Hie people of the north, too, being of the same race as their conquerors, are considered the most loyal, and are therefore made to furnish the greater part of the infantry. Azerbaijan and Irak are the chief recruiting-grounds. The cavalry are chiefly drawn from Khorassan, where large numbers of Kurdish horsemen were originally established to check the inroads of the Turkomans. The artillery is at present supplied on a voluntary system, Azerbaijan again providing most of this branch. Service is for life, but in practice the men are continually exchanged. Out of a regiment 800 strong, 180 to 200 men only probably live out their lives as soldiers, a money payment to the Commanding Officer sufficing to purchase discharge. The pay being almost nil, the villages are often obliged to offer a bonus varying from 10 to 50 tomans to the recruit as an inducement to serve: further, an annual payment is made averaging from about 3 tomans. No regard is paid to age. or capacity, any objection raised by the Commanding Officer being easily silenced by a money payment. The appointment of officers is made by nomination, and as a rule the Minister of War nominates up to the rank of Major. For higher grades a Firman from the Shah is required, countersigned by the Minister of War. In all cases a money payment is required varying from 50 to 500 tomans ; sometimes more is paid. The number of officers is limited only in the regiments. There is no limit to the grant of honorary titles, the sale of which is a regular matter of traffic. Men on leave draw the equivalent of six months’ pay from the village or district. They are paid by the village authorities, who are allowed corresponding deductions in the village taxes. Actually the men receive but a small portion of their dues, the rest being eaten up by the Governors, Commanding Officers, tax-collectors, and the Minister. In garrison the men receive six months’ pay from the village, six months from the provincial revenue or the Treasury. The sums required for disbursements to the troops in the provinces are, as already stated (vide Part 1, Paper No. 1), included in the Governors’ Memorandums, and payments are effected accordingly. These expenditures are, as a rule, dealt with by the Accountants of the Military Accounts Branch, who are specially detached to the provinces for the purpose of obtaining receipts, checking expenditure, authenticating documents, &amp;c. The appointments are much sought after, 1,000 tomans being sometimes paid as purchase-money. The payment of troops in Tehran is effected by the Minister of War, who draws in a lump sum annually the moneys required for the troops and the various Supply Depart ments. The direct disbursements are made by the Military Accounts Branch of the Ministry. This system is of recent growth, and it is only within the last few years that the Government Treasury has ceased to deal directly with the troops and Supply Depart ments. The troops are paid invariably many months in arrears. The Military Accounts Branch loans out money at high rates of interest to native bankers, and to enable it to command the necessary capital the pay of the troops has to be utilized. Short payments are also invariably made, and as all the superior ranks demand a share in the profits, from the Minister to the subaltern, the regiments are maintained far below their regulation strength. As a rule from 200 to 300 men are always short in every 800. A certain fixed sum is set aside annually in the Budget expenditure of the several War Departments, and is taken over by the Military Accounts Branch of the War Minister. Each and every one of the Departments which comprise the arsenal workshops, ammunition, equipment, harness, ordnance, clothing, and stores is under the immediate control of the Minister, and is exploited in his interests. No check can be exercised, for he not only orders the expenditure, but manufactures and takes over the supplies, and then finally carries out his own audit. To sum up, the whole machinery of the army is so administered as best to serve the private aims of the individual. The troops are left unpaid, ill-clothed, badly fed, discontented, and ill-disciplined. Disorder reigns in every branch of the Service; in truth, nothing is left undone which a wicked ingenuity can devise for spoiling as g'ood material as a soldier could ever hope for.

No. 4 .—The Customs. ^ In the early part of the present century the Customs were in the hands of the various Governors of the frontier provinces, who purchased annually the right of collection for certain sums ; gradually, as the Customs increased in importance, higher offers of purchase were made until, and more especially in Azerbaijan, the revenue so derived assumed, an importance to render it advisable for the Central Government to take some responsibility in the matter. A special officer was sent to control the administration in Azerbaijan, and from this step sprang the idea of creating the post of a “ Vazird-Gumruk” (Minister of Customs), an appointment instituted a little before the first journey of the Shah to Europe. Still, however, important frontiers remained in the hands of private contractors until the Amin-es-Sultan (father of the present Sadr Azm) pointed out to the Shah the feasibility of realizing with proper control much larger returns. His Majesty thereupon placed the entire administration of the Customs in the hands of the late Amin-es-Sultan, with the result of a rapid increase in the revenue—an increase amounting before his death to a sum of some 300,000 tomans per annum. The late Amin further amalgamated the octroi and “rah dari” duties to the Customs. At his death these passed on as an hereditary office to his son, the present Sadr Azm, since which time the total revenue has remained at the same figure it reached three or four years before the death of the late Amin-es-Sultan, viz., about 900,000 tomans per annum. Note .—A slight rise took place in 1895. The Sadr Azm in turn sells the right of collection of customs, including “rah dari” and octroi duties, along the several frontiers to the various provincial Governors or private individuals, the transaction being in the nature of a private contract, and, generally speaking, passing from hand to hand, and renewed annually. Whatever profits accrue over and above the specified sum paid annually into the Treasury (900,000 to 1,000,000 tomans) becomes the perquisite of the Sadr Azm, the same principle holding, one may say, throughout Persian administration and exactly parallel to the case of the Ministers of Posts and Telegraphs (vide Part I, Papers Nos. 9 and 10), who take as perquisite all revenue derived from their Administration, less a certain fixed sum paid into the Treasury. Note .—Reliable native sources give the profits of the Sadr Azm at 200,000 tomans per annum, i.e., 40,000^. As previously mentioned, the Customs form one of the chief sources of the revenue of Persia. Under this head are included taxes on imports and exports, “rah dari” (read tax), and octroi. Two rates of customs duties are levied, the one on foreigners, the other on natives. The customs duties levied on foreigners have their basis in the terms of the Treaty of Turkmanchai (between Persia and Russia, of the 10th (22nd) February, 1828), the conditions of which briefly stated are as follows:— “Article III. Merchandize imported to or exported from Persia is subject to a 5 per cent, duty at the lime of entry or departure; and afterwards is not liable to any other customs rights.” The customs duties levied on natives consist of the payment on imports and exports of a nominal 3 per cent, only (but this sum varies from year to year), and, in addition, the duties of “rah dari” and octroi, the amounts for which constantly vary, depending in reality on the power of the contractor to extract money from the merchant; so that by the time merchandize is brought into the country, or vice versd, tne native merchant has had to pay from 10 to 15 per cent. By the Treaty of Turkmanchai Persia deprived herself of all flexibility in her foreign commercial relations, for though her conditions of commerce with Russia are reciprocal, they are not so with other nations; France, for instance, whilst claiming the right of the most-favoured-nation clause, can import into Persia at 5 per cent, ad valorem, whereas Persia might have to pay 30 per cent, to import into France, the rate changing whenever France is led to alter her commercial relations with other Powers. Feeling the intolerable ness of this burden, Persia some years ago endeavoured to effect a modification in the terms of the Commercial Articles in the Treaty, but the negotiations failed, and Persia nov finds her hands so tied as to be entirely dependent on the will of Russia for any improvement in the terms of her Customs relations with other countries. Again, by fixing the value of the customs at 900,000 or 1,000,000 tomans, and through a long period rigidly adhering to this original valuation, Persia lias further diminished her flexibility. By her system of Government sales she has further blinded herself to the actual state of her foreign commercial relations, and has, moreover, cut herself adrift from all touch with sources of reliable information concerning the real value of her customs. It is at present to the interest of the Administration, the contractors, the Treasury officials, in fact to the interest of almost all connected directly or indirectly with the Customs, to furnish an inexact picture of receipts and expenditure; trustworthy Reports, therefore, are unobtainable. From Consular Reports, however, there seems little doubt of the great increase still developing in the imports and exports during the last fifteen years.Yet again the breaks the system offers in the chain of responsibility prevent proper c^trol by the Central Government. Not only is the Treasury the loser, but the chief and sub-contractors likewise, for bribery enters largely into Customs transactions; and in practice, I am told, both foreign and native merchants take advantage of the venality of the Customs agents, the former rarely paying more than 4 per cent, import duty, and perhaps even less, the loss in this case falling directly on the local contractor. No. 5.— The Treasury. The staff of the Treasury consists of an official with the rank of Minister. The Staff of Treasury. Amin-ul-Mulk, own brother of the Sadr Azm, now holds this post. He is assisted by various writers and cashiers. The duties of the Treasury comprise:— 1. The receiving of all surplus provincial revenue noted in the Memorandums issued by the Daftr. In exchange it gives receipts which serve as vouchers in the final accounts of the Governors. 2. Receiving the fixed revenues derived from Customs and Mint, sale of Governorships, Concessions, and other miscellaneous items. 3. Disbursing moneys according to the special instructions of the Daftr—instructions which generally take the form of Barats. 4. Making payments agreeably to the Memorandum prepared by the Daftr for the use of the Treasury. The Treasury Memorandum differs but little from that prepared for the provinces. It shows all the receipts, whether from revenue, Customs, or Mint, for which the Treasury will be held responsible, and specifies as disbursements all the usual fixed expenditure. The Barat system {vide Part I, Paper No. 2) is much employed in the Treasury, for no extraordinary disbursements can be made except on the Barats vouched for by the Minister of the Daftr and the Sadr Azm. The business of the Treasury is conducted very irregularly, and its funds are utilized Conduct of business, by the Minister and others concerned much in the same way as are those of the Military Accounts Branch by the Naib-es-Sultaneh, Minister of War. In many respects the Treasury is treated as a private banking concern, relations being entered into with private bankers (“ sarafs ”), and moneys loaned out at high rates of interest. To carry out this programme the Treasury seldom is able to disbui’se moneys on due date, and a very large number of Barats are kept out for eight or nine months even without receiving attention. The actual disbursing business is managed through these “ sarafs,” on whom the Minister issues cheques or pays orders in replacement of the original Government Barats. Great delays ensue, and the holders of the cheques, rather than run the risk of indefinite delay, often prefer to compound with the “ sarafs,” receiving from 1 to 3 krans in the toman (10 krans). Large profits thus accrue to the great advantage of the Minister and the bankers. At the end of the year the Treasury submits its accounts to the Daftr, where they Audit of accounts of are written up by the Mustauffis set aside for the purpose. After verification they Treasury, receive the signature of the Minister of the Daftr and the Sadr Azm. A cursory glance at the foregoing will show that this branch of the public finances is General remarks on managed on the lines of a private monopoly. The fact that the Minister is own brother to the administration, the Sadr Azm gives him enormous power, and nullifies the audit which is supposed to be exercised by the Daftr. It also nullifies the value of the audit by the Minister of the Daftr and the Sadr Azm. The Treasury, as regards management, is the counterpart of the Military Accounts Branch. The one is conducted in the interest of the Prime Minister, the other in that of the Naib-es-Sultaneh, Minister of War, neither being under the effective control of the Daftr owing to the high positions occupied by the respective patrons of the subordinate Departments. I make special mention of this contrast, because I think it accounts in great part for the want of influence of the Sadr Azm in all matters affecting the army administration, the Minister of War always being able to reply to any criticism on the part of the Prime Minister by pointing his finger at the Treasury. I ought not to forget to mention that the Amin-ul-Mulk finances all the private business of the Customs for his brother, the Sadr Azm. No. 6 .—Ministry of Pensions and Charitable Bequests. This so-called Ministry is presided over by a Minister known as the “Vazir-i- Organization and Vazaief/’ through whose agency an annual expenditure of 500,000 tomans is said to be scope, effected. On the pensioned lists are found students of religious law, members of the priesthood, “Syeds,” and various Government servants, [66&amp;J G22 Charitable foundations. General remarks. 1o jol Administration. The Religious Law, ' Sharh.’' The “Ulema.” The “Urf,” or law of custom. The students receive pensions to enable them to prosecute their studies, which they caii} out quite independently of all control of the Minister or Government. The oWsgood also with the Ulema and Syeds, on whom no special demands are made. T e pensions to private individuals depend on favouritism, hereditary ri°ht, &amp;c., and are rarely granted for good service. The State seldom benefits by the death of the pensioners, for though one-third of the sum granted is supposed to lapse, two-thirds descending to the family, well-placed bribes secure the full sum, and Government is invariably mulcted of its rights. Charitable foundations consist chiefly of landed property left by the charitably disposed for the building and maintenance of religious schools, mosques, tombs: for the construction and maintenance of caravanserais, roads, &amp;c. !n the absence of Government control and registration, little is known of the value of these chanties. In the time of Nadir Ali Shah the revenue is supposed to have been not i 6 ^^ 95000 ’ 000 t0manS per annum ; at the present time a rough estimate mentions 4,000,000 tomans as a probable figure; in anv case, there is little doubt that a very lar^e sum is annually expended. ^ The management of the revenue rests primarily with the legal trustee, who is theoreti- cally responsible for his trust; practically he is given a free hand, and misappropriation or peculation is the chief feature of the system. Of administration bv higher authoritv there is none. . « j ' Only in one foundation does Government directly interfere, the Holy Tomb at Meshed being the exception to the general rule. The system, both as regards pensions and charitable foundations, presents many anomalies Government receives little or no return for its large expenditure in pensions, and instead of by their means wielding an enormous influence over that troublesome class of people, the students and Moolahs, is more or less a slave in their hands. The moneys wasted on so-called theological training, if directed into proper educational channels, would serve not only to spread theological knowledge, but to place the liberal sciences within reach of large numbers of students. The charitable foundations are either lying idle or dwindling through corruption, tion ^ 0Vernment spirps aP responsibility, and prefers to leave the field open to exploita- 'lhe income accruing from the bequests would, under the most ordinary management, suffice to repair perhaps every caravanserai in the country, and to restore the colleges to a nigh state of prosperity. It is difficult to account for the apathy. No. 7.— T/ie Ministry of Justice. Ihe office of Minister of Justice has until quite latelv been united to that of Com merce. The duties of the Minister of Justice theoretically consist of taking general note of the law throughout the country, of enforcing the execution of judgments delivered bythe f pd® r ^ a , acc&lt; j )Upn S 1° the Religious Law, and of hearing all cases referred to him under the Urf, or law of custom. As a matter of fact, the power of the Minister is quite a personal matter; at times his influence may extend far afield, at others hardly reaching beyond the walls of Ins own dwelling. A strong Minister will have his agents in every province and chief town to take note of the local course of justice; but it seldom happens that the chief is sufficiently influential to invest his agents with proper authority. A glance at the system of law is necessary to explain the method of administration. Ihere is but one codified law in Persia, denominated the “Sharh,” or Religious Law. It is based on the Koran and traditions, and has been developed by celebrated juris consults to a degree of excellence. It takes note of many purely civil matters, divorces, contracts, wills, transfers of property, and certain matters of criminal jurisdiction. With the exception of the latter all are administered by the Ulema. The Ulema are recruited from religious students who, after studying at the great colleges of Kerbela, Nejf-Samara, qualify as teachers and expounders of all questions appertaining to the Sharh. Once qualified, the Mujtahid is independent and irrespon sible, and though their Decrees have not the force of judgments as such are understood in Lurope, yet their influence is great. Their power, however, is limited, in that the execu tion of their decisions rests with the civil authorities, the office of the Ulema bein°-, so to speak, entirely judicial. 0 In addition to the Sharh, there is the uncodified, unwritten law commonly known as the k ' Urf, 5 based on usage and tradition. The Urf is now administered by any official of rank who may have power to enforce the execution of his judgment. Competence depends on that factor alone. Ihere is no sjjecial ruling as to the hearing of cases, the parties concerned having the power to represent their grievances wherever they may consider it to their best interests to do so. The execution of sentences generally rests with the authority delivering judgment.It therefore follows that matters brought forward must correspond in some degree to the pc^ion of the authority to whom reference is made, for though most officials have judicial powers, only the most influential can secure execution. The actual execution of judgment rests with a class of people known as “ Farrashes.” The instruments of In the capital the chief Farrash-Bashi is a personage of much consideration, and a servant justice, of the Shah. Under his orders are subordinate Farrashes, whose business it is to give effect to the orders of the Minister of Justice and others. In the provinces the Farrash-Bashi is nominated by the Governor. All judgments, whether religious or civil, Sharh or Urf, are executed by his staff of Farrashes. It will be seen that theoretically there is a strongly marked line between the Sharh Usurpation of power and Urf laws. The first sign of weakness, however, on the part of the civil authorities, b y the Ulema, or the slightest relaxation of their control, at once adds to the influence of the Ulema, and with it comes an usurpation of the Urf laws by the religious authorities. No. 8.— The, Ministry of Commerce. As already stated, this Ministry till quite recently formed part of the Ministry of The Ministry. Justice, presumably because the role of the xViinister confined itself almost entirely to the judicial side of commercial business. Theoretically, the organization of the Ministry takes the same lines as that of Justice, Organization, the Minister relying on special agents to control or direct commercial justice in the provinces and chief towns. The position and functions of the agents depend entirely on the amount of support the Minister is able to extend. More often than not they are absolutely useless, and ignored by the civil authorities who usurp their powers. Competence in the case of ordinary law is dependent solely on the power of the Commercial business. officials to give effect to their judgments, or to the decisions of special Committees of merchants to which complicated cases are referred. Commercial business is conducted according to the Urf laws, but advantage is always taken by the Ulema of any disorganization in the Urf Administration to intervene between merchant and merchant. Of late years their intervention on behalf of the native merchant has been temporarily such as to cripple foreign trade and to render the relations between the foreigner and the people almost impossible. The cases have been numberless where they have been able to set aside the decisions of the civil authorities, and even the special orders of the Sadr Azm himself, to whom, in the absence of any responsible Minister, all final appeals are now made. No. 9 .—The Ministry of Posts. The first effort towards any definite organization of Posts commenced with the Fj rs t commencemeof*. institution of “ Chappar Khanas,” postal stations built on the high roads between the capital and the provinces, for the better and quicker conveyance of the orders of the Sovereign. At the same time private individuals, merchants, &amp;c., employed foot runners for the conveyance of their own and other correspondence, which they undertook to deliver at a certain charge. Gradually the Government messengers were allowed to carry private letters without fixed charge, and later permission was given to travellers to make use cf the Chappar horses, a privilege at first jealously guarded. On the return cf His Majesty from the first journey to Europe in 1872, an Austrian Establishment oF officer, named Roederer, was engaged to organize a regular postal service with the Emin-ed- Euro P ea n system. Dowleh, at the head of the Administration as Minister. For the first two or three years the service was little used. It then gradually developed to a relative degree of activity, and now that the people have gained confidence is used as a means of transmitting large sums of money, valuables, &amp;c. Insurances are effected through Lloyd’s or other Company by telegraph. Ihe Posts are administered on the usual principle, that is, more or less on the lines of Monopolization of a private monopoly, subsidized in this case by the Government. The Minister is not Posts, called upon to render an account of his trust, but is simply expected to maintain the Department at a certain degree of efficiency, and is at liberty to dispose of the profits as he may think fit. 1 he subsidy is a relic of the old days, when the Government was in the habit of granting a certain sum for the maintenance of establishments and horses at the different Chappar services. These allowances have never been allowed to lapse, and form part of the stock in trade of the Ministry. Any attempt to form an estimate of the revenue can only be guesswork, for the Revenue.Minister and bis associates are naturally interested in showing that the receipts are of no account. Those who should he able to judge maintain that the monopoly is much va^d, and the retention of the Posts for so many years by the same official may be taken as fair proof of their value. Development is much impeded by the disturbed state of the interior, insecurity to life and property along the great highways doing much to hinder progress. No. 10 .—Ministry of Telegraphs. Administration. The Telegraph Department is organized on the lines of a private monopoly subsidized and assisted by Government. The Administration consists of a Minister with a staff of Persian and European officials. The actual revenue is fixed at 19,000 tomans per annum, and this sum is theoretically paid into the Treasury every year by the Minister. Actually nothing whatever is realized, for against this credit must he debited the expenses for new lines, new instruments, salaries of certain of the staff, all of which are met by Government. The Indo-European and Indian Government telegraphs pay a percentage, being the international tax on messages passing over their lines. This sum actually reaches the Treasury, and suffers but slight shrinkage en route. The system of monopoly acts in a manner detrimental to progress and extension; the Minister, though one of the most enlightened of Persian officials, works the lines in his own interests; an enormous staff, especially in the subordinate ranks, is maintained at the expense of Government; projects for new lines are almost invariably obstructed by the Minister, who fears that extension might lead to further demands on his private purse; and, lastly, no check on the accounts can be maintained by Goverment, or any estimate made as to the working value of the Administration. No. 11.— The Foreign Office. The Ministry. Diplomatic and Consular Service. General note. The Foreign Office is presided over by the Kavam-ul-Mulk, an old gentleman in his dotage, who is privileged to figure in name as Chief of the Department. The actual Chief is the Prime Minister, the Sadr Azm, who, with his Frist Secretary, the Mushir- ul-Mulk, personally conducts the affairs of the Ministry. The staff consists of several Secretaries dealing with English, Russian, Turkish - Diplomatic business. Consular affairs, ceremonies of Court, records. As a rule all foreign Representatives communicate directly with the Sadr Azm. The Diplomatic and Consular Services form part of the Foreign Office, the Ambas sadors and Ministers receiving their nominations from the Shah, and retaining their appointments at the pleasure of His Majesty ; similarly, the more important Consuls obtain their nominations by Royal favour. Many of the appointments are of pecuniary value owing to the large returns derived from passports, the sale of patronage and justice, &amp;c. The posts of Constantinople and Tiflis are more especially sought after on this account. The Consulships abroad are usually given to bankers or others to whom the position may be a matter of consideration, and who pay accordingly. The Foreign Office suffers in exactly the same manner as every other Department of the State—over-centralization, want of confidence in the subordinates, sale of office, a disinclination on the part of the authorities to scrutinize too closely the action of its servants, an entire lack of system and of business management being the main features of its administration. No. 12 .—The Council of State. Sketch of the Couacil. The Council is an institution dating from the beginning of the reign of the present Shah. A short sketch of its beginnings may prove of interest, as the principle involved in its constitution is one of great importance. In the early part of the reign the well-known Mirza Taghi Khan became Persian Minister. He was a man of much character, ability, and patriotism; made the law feared, and strengthened the authority of the Central Government. After some years of office the Shah did him to death. Another Sadr Azm, Mirza Aga Khan, of milder disposition and less disinterested character, took his place. He was dispossessed after seven years of office.25 At his fall the Shah divided the responsibility between the different Ministers, giving ±^em the power to report directly to the Sovereign. These, together with other influential personages, formed themselves into a Council to report on all important questions of public interest. The President, though shown much consideration, retained his rank of Minister only, and was not called Prime Minister. About twelve years ago another departure was made in favour of a Prime Minister, and the Mustaufli-ul-Mamalik was nominated as such. The other Ministers were, however, held responsible in their various Departments, and retained their separate privileges. At the death of the MustaufS, the Ministers again conjointly assisted in the govern ment, and this system continued to within the last three years, when the Amin-es-Sultan, then Minister of the Court and now Sadr Azm, or Prime Minister, was promoted to the vacant post. Since that date the value of the Council has been discounted, and for all practical purposes it has ceased to exist. His Majesty has failed apparently to grasp the meaning of a Council of State. He General note, regards the assembly, half suspiciously, as something which might possibly interfere with the Royal prerogative, not as a valuable means for the control of the various Ministries, or as an agency for the higher criticism of the Financial Department, a Department which now has nothing between itself and the Crown except the Sadr Azm. The Sadr Azm’s motive in absorbing the Council is apparent, as thereby he removes the only Assembly which could stand between himself and the Throne, or which might have proved an obstacle to his schemes of centralization. No. 13 .—Employment and Payment of Public Servants, Appointments depend on inherited right, family interest, favouritism, seldom on merit Employment, alone. Government service is a matter of great consideration in Persia, and the staff of servants is exceedingly large when compared to the field of labour, so large that numbers of officials are maintained with pay and without employment. A considerable sum of money is annually budgeted for on account of its servants, but fixed pay is a figure of speech, the influence of the individual being the one determining factor. In the provinces the payment of the subordinates and of all those borne on the Payment of public Provincial Lists is a matter which depends very much on the financial prosperity of the servants. Governor. If his affairs are doing well, and the demands made by the Central Government have been vyithin reason, the officials may be paid. If, on the contrary, the demands have been excessive, the salaries will either be withheld, paid in part, or not paid at all. In the latter case every individual sufferer will set about making good his losses from the people, who eventually reap the harvest of the misdeeds of their superiors. (Signed) Tehran, August 31, 1895. H. PICOT, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military Attache. Paet II .—Proposals for Reform of the Central Administration of Government. No. 1. (Confidential.) The papers on Persian administration, Part I, have entered into the question of Reform in administration in some detail, and have shown the evils resulting from too great a concen- administration, tration of power, the effacement of the individual Minister, the weakening of the central authorities, want of permanency in the administration of the provinces, disorganization and want of control over the finances, &amp;c. In this, the second part of my sketch, I propose dealing with the subject of reform and such other matters, financial or commercial, as may assist the country in re-establishing its finance and credit. In drawing up this scheme I have attempted to keep the following points continually Object aimed at in before me:— scheme of reform. 1. To retain the old forms whilst endeavouring to reconstruct j in other words, to avoid novelty. 2. To restore the central authority, and to extend its control and direction to every Department of the public service, whether in the provinces or the capital. 3. To re-establish the responsibility and individuality of the Ministers, as well as of other chief officers of the State. To extend their powers in the provinces [ 668 ] H26 ) Proposal for restoration of the Council of State. Its deliberative powers. Its judicial powers. Its financial powers. Division of the Council into Boards for the conduct of its business. Proposal for the revival of the Council of Ministers. List of the chief Ministries. 4. To give permanency and continuity of purpose in the Administration. 5. To reintroduce some rational method into the management of the public financ^p more especially to subject them to high control. To give effect to this programme the first and most important step is that the Council of State should be revived, with increased power, dignity, and authority. At present the Council is composed of the various Ministers, or other personages specially nominated by the Shah. I would extend these nominations to ex-Ministers, highest military and civil functionaries, men of great social rank or scientific attainment, and so make it represen tative of the best social and [ 1 ] characteristics of the country. To it would be delegated the highest pov. T ers; as a deliberative body the Council would concern itself with all measures of a permanent nature, and would advise His Majesty on questions of administrative regulation. As the highest judicial authority it would take note of the conduct of the law, and would as the highest Court of Appeal pass judgment in civil and criminal cases. As the highest financial authority it would scrutinize the work of the Finance Minister, and deal finally with all his accounts {vide c&lt; Daftr,” Part I, Paper No. 2). This duty would be performed by the Board of Accounts of the Council, the staff of which would be chosen from others than men of the Mustauffi class of the Daftr. To cope with these multifarious duties, and to prevent the Council being swamped with detail, it would divide itself into Committees or Boards for the consideration of its law, finance, commerce, &amp;c. Each Board would have its own permanent establishment. The direction of the Council would extend to every Department of the State, and its thoroughness would react on all sides, more particularly on that which is concerned with finance. Nothing new or novel has been propounded, though an effort has been made to revive an effete assembly, and to make it what it should be—a body controlling and directing every branch of the public service. Its numbers have been somewhat added to, in order to make it more representative, to give it the .means of coping with its increased labours, and to enable it, by force of public opinion, to resist absorption at the hand of any one individual member of the State. Part of my scheme for the restoration of the central authority includes also the revival of the Council of Ministers, but as this can only spring from an awakening of the Ministers to a sense of responsibility, 1 may at once pass on to that question, and show how I would raise their status, both as Heads of Departments and as members of the Council. The following is a list of the principal Ministers as they now exist in name:— The Prime Minister. The Minister of War. „ „ Interior. Finance. J ustice. Commerce. Foreign Affairs. Pensions, Charitable Institutions. Posts. Telegraphs. Industries, Fine Arts. Court. Ministerial ^ My purpose is to give to each Minister— responsibilities. Responsibility in his own Department, and to rigidly limit his powers to tha Department. 2. To subject his administrative work to the general survey of the Council of State, his financial work to the audit of the Minister of Finance, and final examination of the Board of Accounts of the Council. 3. To restore him to his proper place in the State and Ministerial Councils. I will take each Ministry in turn. No. 2 .—The Ministry of War. Present view of the It l ias I* 6611 shown in Part I, Paper No. 3, that the Minister of War unites in his own Ministry. person several separate and distinct offices, such as those of the Minister of War, Financial Secretary, the Commander-in-chief, and Paymaster-General. As Minister of War and Financial Secretary he prepares the Army Estimates, provides the war material, equipment, clothing, tents, &amp;c,, meets all pay disbursements, and checks the accounts of expenditure. As Commander-in-chief he accepts the material and equipment provided by himself as Minister of War.As Paymaster-General he deals with the executive disbursements to the troops. On him^ierefore, devolves the whole responsibility, administrative, financial, and executive. it is true that the army accounts are theoretically centralized and audited in the Daftr of the Finance Minister, but the officers of that Department dare not oppose the favourite son of the Shah, and on the principle of “ Live and let live/’ interfere as little as possible with the finances of the Naib-es-Sultaneh. The system is one of extreme centralization. I do not propose dealing with the intricate question of army administration further than is necessary to bring the financial and supply branches into a semblance of order, and to define the relative position of the Civil and Military Departments of War. It seems absolutely necessary to break up the confused organization which now centres on the Minister of War. This can, perhaps, best be arrived at by relegating the duties of supply and finance to a civilian War Minister; the duties purely military to a Commander- in-chief. The former would be directly responsible to the Council of State, and would be assisted by various Directors-General, experts charged with the Supply Departments of War under the responsibility of the Minister. A Financial Secretary would deal with the accounts of the army. This officer’s duty would comprise the compilation of the Estimate for inclusion in the Budget of the Minister of Finance, the issues of all moneys to the Supply Departments, the administration of the Army Pay Department, the primary audit before submission to the Great Accounts Department, the Daftr for final scrutiny by the Board of Accounts of the Council. I cannot insist too strongly on the importance of a thorough check on the army expenditure. The accounts of the Financial Secretary would be first examined in his own checking office by accountants nominated by the Minister of War, and chosen from other than the Mustauffi class of the Daftr. They would then be passed on for rigid audit in the Daftr of the Minister of Finance {vide a Finance” or &lt;c Daftr,” Part II, Paper No. 4), and by him would be submitted to the Council of State for final scrutiny by their Board of Accounts. The military branch would be under the orders of the Commander-in-chief, who would be responsible for the personnel of the army, its drill and discipline. Being directly responsible to the Council of State, and not to the Minister of War, he would act as a check on the latter, and would see that the army were not starved, either as regards establishment, war material, or pay. I would add much to the importance of this officer by extending his duties to the provinces, and by bringing the whole army under one military control. At present the powers of the Minister of War in his capacity as Commander-in-chief are limited to a certain extent; for instance, the Zil-es-Sultan practically commanding the troops in his Governorship, the Vali Ahd commanding those in Azerbaijan, the Governor-General doing the same in Khorassan. Whether under the changed order suggested it would be advisable to retain the services of the Naib-es-Sultaneh is very doubtful. The increased power of the Commander- in-chief might act as a sop to his vanity, and induce him to remain in office, but under no circumstances should any son of the Shah be allowed to occupy a position directly dealing with finance. This should be reserved entirely for a civilian officer. The principle is the same as that on which I would bar any official occupying a position equalling or excelling that of the Naib-es-Sultaneh (the Sadr Azm, for example) concerning himself directly and personally with any of the Finance Departments of the State, No. 3 .—Ministry of Interior. This very important Ministry is now merged with that of Finance, both being conducted by the Sadr Azm, the de facto, though not nominal, Minister of these great branches of the public service. In Part I, Papers Nos. 1 and 2, the questions affecting Interior and Finance, such as the sale of office, the appointment of Governors, the system of revenue, have been entered into, and though it can hardly be said that Interior and Finance require reorganization in any more urgent degree than any other branches of the Service, yet the scope of their dealings has such vital bearing on public interests that the urgency of reform is here even more apparent, and demands most careful attention. I have throughout the present papers urged the necessity of dividing responsibility, and of making the different Ministers actual, not nominal, Chiefs of Departments. Secondly, of introducing a practical and efficient control of the public finances. To carry out this programme, the duties of Interior and Finance must be separated, and the functions conducted independently one of the other. The nature of the office of the Sadr Azm is such that he might very properly fill the place of the Minister of Interior. The duties I would limit— 1. To the nomination of provincial Governors and Sub-Governors. 2. To the control of the provincial administration. 3. To the control of the police, safety of roads, and sanitary measures.

Proposals for better administration.28 As regards nomination of Governors. As regards control of provincial adminis- tration. Proposal for permanency of staff. As regards item 1, the nomination of Governors, I have referred more particularly to this in the article on provincial administration. Part II, Paper No. 7* With reference to the duties of control, and with a view to the establishment of a general system in the provinces, it is very necessary that the Minister of Interior, like all- other Ministers of first rank, should have a permanent staff removed from the accidents of Governorship, and responsible to the Minister himself for the proper conduct of their duties. The chief members of this staff would be the Farrash-Bashi, whose office has been explained in Part I, Paper No. 7» and a permanent Secretary. On this organization of a permanent staff I lay great stress. Through its agency the Minister \&gt;ill be brought into direct touch with the provinces; a body of trained men will be maintained in whom the Minister has confidence, dependent on him for the orders they may receive, and indepen dent of the personal idiosyncrasies of the temporary Governor. The power of the Central Government will thus be enormously increased, and we should not see, as at present, the orders of Government set on one side by the obstruction or bad will of the Governor.

Proposal for the better administration of the Ministerial accounts. Proposal for subject ing the Daftr, or Ministry of Finance, to high scrutiny of the Board of Accounts of the Council of State. As regards perma nency in system of finance in provinces. Proposal for perma nency of staff. No. 4 .—Ministry of Finance. According to the present order of finance in Persia, the great accounting Department of the kingdom is the Daftr, a central organization composed chiefly of accountants called Mustauffis, by whom not only are the central accounts administered, but also every account of any importance, whether it be provincial, Ministerial, or local. Held together by ties of birth and self-interest, they are able to manipulate the accounts with impunity. The system may be described as the outcome of a great swindling corporation with feelers extending to the furthermost limits. The Daftr treats the Ministerial and provincial Estimates which are drawn up by the Mustauffis nominated from the Daftr for the purpose. It then compiles the Budget, prepares the Memorandums of expenditure {vide Part I, Paper No. 2), issues or checks the special orders directing disbursements, finally centralizes and audits all accounts. In fact, from first to last, it controls every financial transaction of importance. Keform should, I venture to think, seek— 1. To limit the field and influence of the Mustauffis. 2. To prevent their interference with the finances of the Ministers or provinces except in so far as their legitimate audit is concerned. 3. To establish a higher and more responsible agency for the final acceptance of the accounts of the kingdom, to which the Accounts Department of the Finance Minister would be subordinate. 4. To create more permanency in the system of finance in the provinces. 5. To centralize under the Finance Administration the Treasury, the Customs, and Mint. The first step will be to separate the Ministries of Interior and Finance, for both cannot be controlled by one personage, and under no circumstances should the chief officer of the State, the Sadr Azm, have any direct dealings with this Ministry, i.e., with finance. I would therefore make Finance into a distinct Ministry, under a capable and trusted official, noted for his integrity and courage. It goes without saying that he cannot be a member of the Mustauffi corporation. Now, as regards the Mustauffis, their proper field is in the Daftr of the Minister of Finance, and there alone should they be employed. Their duties v r ould be concerned with the examination of the Ministerial Estimates, the compilation of the Budget, the preparation of the Memorandums of expenditure (vide Part I, Paper No. 2), and the audit of the Ministerial and other accounts. To prevent their interference with the finances of the Ministers or provinces, each Ministry will have its own separate Accounts Office, with accountants nominated by the Ministers themselves, but quite independent of the Mustauffi class, wffio, as already stated, will be employed exclusively in the Ministry of Finance. The Ministerial Accounts Office will prepare their own Estimates, issue their own orders for expenditure, and submit their accounts for audit in the Daftr. The necessity for having some control capable of dealing with the audit of the Accounts Department of the Minister of Finance cannot be too strongly insisted on. This high duty will be performed by the Board of Accounts of the Council of State. I have already mentioned this Board (Part II, Paper No. 1), and need say no further except, on the thoroughness of the check exercised by that Board will depend the financial probity of Persia. Of great importance, too, is the establishment of some permanency in the system of finance in the provinces. A system which allows, for instance, a constant change in the person of the chief agent of the Minister, viz., the “ Peshkar,” or “ Vazir,’ , is one which can only be detrimental to efficiency. The Peshkar is the right hand man of the Governor; on him devolves the collection or administration of the revenue, the issues of moneys, the submission of accounts and29 yiijichers to the Daftr. He occupies a position second only to the Governor, by whom he is Jominated, and, as a rule, lasts just as long as his patron. This constant change upsets the even tenour of business, and all those agents connected with finance in the province should form part of the permanent staff of the Minister. Permanency alone will bring the Minister into touch with the province, preserve traditions, and create a continuity of purpose. I now come to the question of centralizing under the Minister of Finance the Customs, Mint, and Treasury. Each and every one of these is controlled by or in the interests of the Sadr Azm. The Customs and Treasury are administered by the Amin-ul-Mulk, his brother. The Mint by a banking firm of Castelli and' Tumaniansk, who have lately taken a contract xor a term of years, the Sadr Azm being a sleeping partner. To show the extent of the interests involved, I may mention that the personal profits of the Sadr Azm, as regards customs alone, amount, according to those who are best able to make the estimate, from 160,000 to 200,000 tomans per annum, i.e., from 32,000/. to 40,000/., and this notwithstanding the leakage on every side. The Mint is said to have brought a clear 14,000/. last year after paying a royalty of 120,000 tomans (24,000/.) to the Shah. I cannot give any figures as to the Treasury, but the property is highly spoken of. The scheme I would suggest is one that would appeal to 'a very influential body of Persians, and would not give the absolute control to Europeans, against whom the feeling in Persia is yet strong. It is to make the Customs one of the Departments of the Minister of Finance. The Minister would exercise control, assisted by a Board of two advisers : the senior an European of experience, an Englishman or German for choice, the best that money can tempt to lend his services to Persia; the junior a Persian official. Both these officers should have the titles of Directors-General, and rank as Ministers. It might be possible to extend European supervision to the ports and land frontiers, as there the contact^ would be with the merchant class, not with the people, but such extension would require tact, and should proceed gradually. Some difficulties lie in the way of such a scheme, the chief of which are the certain opposition of the Sadr Azm, and the covert hostility of Russia. During the spring of 1895 the Ottoman Bank offered His Majesty a loan of 1,000,000/., with which it was suggested the Regie debt should be paid off, the other 500,000/. replenishing the Imperial coffers. Four per cent, interest was demanded on the guarantee of the Customs. His Majesty was excited by the proposal, and his relations with the Sadr Azm were for some time much strained. The agent of the Ottoman Bank, seeing where the opposition lav, offered to the Sadr Azm, on the part of the promoters, an annual payment of 120,000 tomans. This was refused. The sequel proved interesting, for the Prime Minister enlisted the sympathies of the Russian Legation, and His Majesty the Shah was made aware of the strong objection of the Russian Government to a scheme which would give administrative control of the Customs to the Ottoman Bank. It was also hinted that Russia could find the money on the sahie guarantee. ^ There seems little doubt that sooner or later the bait held out by adventurous banks or foreign Governments will be too strong for the cupidity of the Shah, who will finally compel the Sadr Azm to relinquish his monopoly. ^ For this reason I venture to think any support given to the Sadr Azm to enable him to retain the Customs is thrown away, and that a reform under Persian administration assisted by European experts, has many advantages, and would cause the least possible objection to Russia. 1 Concurrent with changes in the Customs, reform could be introduced in the Mint* but till money is obtained through the Customs, I see no hope for special treatment of the currency question. As regards the Treasury, no personal interest should be allowed to stand in the way and I would insist on the Treasury taking its place as one of the Departments of the Minister of Finance. Its accounts would, like all other accounts, be audited by the Daftr and finally scrutinized by the Board of Accounts of the Council of State. ~ 1 ■&gt; Whatever conclusions might be arrived at as regards the Customs or Mint therP should be no hesitation about the Treasury. 5 Ho. 5. —Ministry of Commerce.

General note. Present view of Ministry. The attributes of the Minister are clear, and it is necessary that he should be placecj^i a position for their due fulfilment. Briefly, he should— 1. Control the finances of his Ministry. • • , 2. Watch the commercial and industrial interests of his country^ collect statistical information, and, in conjunction with the Minister of Finance, criticize all proposals for the development of commerce, taxation, &amp;c. 3. Survey the Commercial Tribunals. This programme does not appear outside the capacity of an ordinary business man of experience ; but it is indispensable that commerce should be independent of other Depart ments, and work entirely within its own circle. For these reasons a separate and respon sible Minister should be appointed. ... . . The first step towards imbuing the Minister with a sense of individuality is to make him absolutelv responsible for the accounts of his Department. For this purpose he should have a Ministerial Accounts Office, composed of men, nominated by himself, of a different class to the Mustauffis of the Finance Minister {vide Part II, Paper No. 4). The system of check already propounded, viz., by the Accounts Department of the Minister of Finance (the Daftr), finally by the Board of Accounts of the Council of State, will be quite sufficient to secure 'honest work in this as in other Ministries. The expenditure would he slight in any case. Now as to provincial duties : these can only be adequately carried out by means of permanent agents, through whom alone can commercial business be controlled or a regular system of commercial law and procedure he attained. A strong Minister even now, under the present system, has power to enforce his will in the provinces through his personal agents, but these suffer through the temporary nature of their appointments, being liable to removal whenever the Minister falls into disfavour. By making the agents members of the permanent staff of the Ministry? not of the Minister, this evil would, to a great extent, be removed. As regards the class of agents : these might he chosen from the commercial classes, and to them would he delegated the judicial functions of the Minister. They would settle all ordinary disputes, and for the more serious cases assemble Committees of influential personages to assist them in giving judgment. The Committees might be of a semi-permanent nature, and could even become repre sentative by election. They would he presided over by the permanent agent. In the capital the Committee might he formed of merchants chosen for their know ledge of commercial business. In foreign disputes, ix., between Persian and European, the existing procedure would remain in force. This consists in the assembly of Committees presided over by a Foreign Office agent, the hearing being watched by Representatives of the Governments conceined. In time, however, as the ordinary Commercial Tribunals inspired confidence, the probability is that foreign Powers would gladly submit to their jurisdiction, thereby rendering com mercial justice a matter of law instead of diplomacy. Now, as regards the execution of justice, the agents would concern themselves solely with the judicial side of the law, the executive function resting solely with the civil authorities, ix. } with the Governor and the permanent staff of the Minister of Interior. The effect of permanency in the administration of commercial law would cause the registration of a mass of precedents, out of which a codification of the commercial law might be expected to grow. The hands of the Minister would be enormously strengthened by means^ of the agents. He would he brought into close communication with the classes, and statistics would be forthcoming on which to base his calculations. r Ihe powers of the Moolahs, too, would be greatly reduced. The scheme itself presents no novelty as to system, being a pure modification of the existing framework. No. 6 .—Ministry of Justicx. It has been shown in Part I, Paper No. 7? that justice, as it is understood in Europe, does not exist in Persia. Various reasons were adduced for this state of affairs. These were 1. The weakening of the power of the Minister, and the withdrawal of all respon sibility. . . . 2. The want of proper division of labour as evinced by the combination of Justice and Commerce into one Ministry. 3. The subservience of the agents of the Minister in the provinces to the will of the Governors. # # . . 4. Want of method in the administration of justice and in the execution of judgment. 5. The excessive power of the local Governors, and their interference in the purely judicial work. . . . Many of these abuses can, I believe, be removed without introducing such radical changes as would be distasteful to the ruling classes or the people.•^Following the principle already enunciated in the foregoing papers, it would seem nev^ssary to establish a responsible Ministry, with a permanent staff in the capital and the provinces. The system of government in Persia has already allowed of a capable Minister appointing his agents in the chief centres of the country, but these, unfortunately, are liable to removal with the downfall of their chief, and consequently their authority is of a very temporary and abstract nature. There is no reason why the agents should not form part of the permanent staff of the Ministry in the same way that the Peshkar forms part of the permanent staff of the Minister of Finance, or the Farrash Bashi of the Minister of Interior. If the principle of permanency were once recognized, the groundwork of government would have been laid. The permanent staff would carry out their duties at the chief centres, whilst they would have sub-agents or honorary Magistrates to assist them in every part of the country. (The latter need not necessarily be paid, for many would serve as a matter of honour and prestige). All ordinary cases would be tried by these agents; more serious cases would be referred to the decision of Committees composed of several Magistrates, presided over by Proposal for the establishment of a. permanent staff. one of the permanent agents. A separation of the judicial and executive functions would form part of this system. Separation of the It would be the duty of the Governors and his permanent staff of Farrash-Bashis, judicial from the Farrashes, &amp;c,, to see that the orders of the judicial agents were properly executed, executive function* It is essential that the judgments or decrees of the agents should be given effect to by the civil authorities; the agents or Magistrates confining themselves entirely to the judicial side of the law. So far I have only spoken of the Urf law as administered civilly. There is also Administration of the Sharh, or Religious Law, to be considered. Sharh laws. It has been stated in Part I, Paper No. 7? that the Ulema have the absolute right to judge certain cases which come under the jurisdiction of the Religious Law. Now such right can by no means be interfered with. The Ulema must remain sole arbiters in their own branch. Like the agents of the Urf law, however, they will be dependent on the civil authority for the execution of their judgments. I would remark that a systematic administration of the Uvf Laws would do much to diminish the influence of the Moolahs, and so, in a very direct way, add to the influence of Government. A permanency of system such as suggested would establish lay justice on a firmer General note, basis, whilst registration of cases by the permanent staff would in the course of time lead to a codification of the Urf laws. Special attention should be given to procedure and law in the capitals, for there would the system crystallize and the law assume finality. The sharp separation of the judicial from the executive function would also do much to purify justice. As regards finance, the Minister of Justice would, like all other Ministers, be responsible for the preparation of the Estimates and expenditure in his own Department, and the regular rendering of his accounts to the audit of the Finance Minister to the scrutiny of the Board of Accounts of the Council of State. No. 7 .—Provincial Administration. Having now dealt with the Central Departments, I come to the question of the Present view of provinces. administration. Firstly, I must refer back to Part I, Paper No. 1, where a brief sketch was given of the method of government and the system of taxation and revenue, the evils resulting from the sale of appointments, the maladministration of the revenues, the manipulation of the accounts in the interests of the Governors and MustauflSs of the Daftr. In the preceding papers an endeavour has been made to show how many of these evils can be minimized ; how the Ministers, through the agency of a permanent staff, can be brought into closer union with the provinces, and what an enormous effect this will have on systematic administration ; how the accounts would assume a healthier tone through the restriction of the power of the Mustauffi class, and the introduction of a comprehensive control by the Minister of Finance in the first instance, by the Board of Accounts of the Council in the second. There remain now two chief questions as far as the provinces are concerned : one, the status of the Governors ; the other, the great question of the revenue. Hitherto the Governor has taken his position in the provinces as the private farmer Present view of of the estates of the King, not as his responsible Representative in the true meaning of position of Govemoras ■ r J in the province*. the word. He has purchased his right to exploit the people, and the Central Government has always felt that it had no power to criticize his methods, or to interfere except in very exceptional and scandalous circumstances. The appointment of permanent agents to responsible positions, and the consequent displacement of the Governors’ own servants, at once alters the status of the Governor,32 r 4 Revenues, and proposals with thereto. regard reducing him ^ to the status of a superior agent of the central authorities. Nothing therefore remains but to treat him as such, and to pav him a certain fixed salary like^iy other member of the staff. I will now proceed to the question of revenue. The two main sources of direct revenue are the “ asl ” and a farh ” taxations, the former of which alone reaches the Treasury, the latter belonging by custom to the Governor, whom it recoups for the original outlay of appointment. Now the people are perfectly content to pay both the “asl” and “farh” revenue, objecting only when the “farh” is exacted beyond all reason. (I have elsewhere (Part I, Paper No. 1) stated that the “farh” sometimes exceeds three times the amount of the “ asl ” tax). Now the unwritten law is that the “farh” should bear some relative proportion to the “asl” revenue, and I take it, if that law were strictly enforced, it would be a matter of indifference to the people whether the collection were made by Government or b&gt; T others. I hat being so, I would lay it down as a principle that Government alone should oeal with the question of revenue; also, that under no circumstances should a private individual be allowed any rights over the public revenues of the country. The means for the execution of this programme are at hand in the provincial permanent staff. A few words as regards this agency. The jiermanent staff would consist of— The Secretary to the Government nominated by the Minister of Interior. The Farrash Bashi, by the same. The Peshkar, by the Minister of Finance. The Treasurers, by the Minister of Finance. The Commander of the local troops, by the Minister of War. The agents and Magistrates of justice, by the Minister of Justice. The agents of Posts, lelegraphs, and Charitable Institutions, by their respective Ministers. 1 The Peshkar, Treasurers, Sub-Treasurers, &amp;c., would control the actual collection of the revenue, as also its expenditure, and the accounting for the same. Khedkhodas, as at present, would be employed as the agents for actual collection in the villages. legalds expenditure, each Minister would give authority to his agents for the provincial disbursements of his Department. The agents would issue orders for payment, which would be checked by the Peshkars from the Memorandums of the Finance Minister. After verification and counter-signature of the Governors the payments would be valid. Reassessment of taxation. The Peshkar would render his accounts regularly to the Minister of Finance for audit by the Daftr. The real difficulty might lie in the reassessment of the taxation of the “asl” and “ farh ” revenues. Before Coveinment could take any action or alter in any way the existing procedure, it would be necessary to have accurate information of the actual amounts now paid by each community, and then, with due regard to local circumstance, custom, a hundred and one other conditions, to fix the actual amounts to which the community were liable. This information could best be acquired by Special Committees nominated by the Ministers of Interior and Finance, which would make the necessary inquiries on the spot. Their statistics and proposals would be considered by the Minister, and thoroughly discussed in Council, final orders being issued after due deliberation. All subsidiary orders specifying the amounts, time, and method of collection would be circulated in every district or village, and the people would at last know' for what they were liable. Naturally every effort must be made to protect the peasant, and to see that additional exactions are not made. The chain of responsibility commencing with the Minister, and reaching down to the permanent agent, who is directly in touch with the people, would seem sufficient to secure fair administration and justice. The peasant would always have the agents of the Minister of Justice to refer to, and further might appeal directly to the Provincial Council, which would deal especially with revenue disputes. I may mention that the permanent agents of the various Ministers in the capital of the province would be formed into a Council of Advisers to the Governor. 1 They would meet constantly under the presidentship of one of the members to discuss questions of common interest, as also to secure that unity of labour which is so essential to success. l \ t ' ' No. 8 .—The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister. iVoposais as regards The foreign relations in Persia are entirely dependent on the Prime Minister, who the Ministry. alone of all the Ministers is in constant communication with the Sovereign. It would seern very desirable, therefore, that he should be nominated definitely as the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Prime Minister would perhaps prefer the existing method, which enables him to absorb the duties of the office whilst remaining himself in the background ; the principlebeing the same as that which gives him the control of the Ministries of Interior, Justice, Commerce without any displacement of the nominal Ministers. An explanation of this attitude may be found perhaps in the desire of the Sadr Azm not to excite the jealousy of His Majesty the Shah, who might resent too great an accumulation of power in the hands of any one individual. Under the system suggested there will be no necessity for this personal effacement, and the Prime Minister will have nothing to fear by assuming before the world his titles of office as Prime Minister, Minister of Interior, and Foreign Affairs. It will be noticed that the Prime Minister will have no immediate dealings with any of the great financial Departments of State, such as Finance (Daftr), Treasury, Customs, Mint, Pensions, Charitable Institutions, &amp;c. This abstention will give great weight to his voice in the State and Ministerial Councils, besides adding immensely to his prestige in the country. It will also afford him the necessary leisure for the proper administration of his own special duties. No. 9.— Ministry of Posts. Posts as a State Department. It has been explained in Part I, Paper No. 9, that the administration of the Posts is Proposal for the now conducted on the lines of a private enterprise subsidized by Government, and that, abolition of the mono despite the insecurity of roads and want of confidence on the part of the public, the service ancl c £® a ti° n has developed in a marked degree. 1 PoR+fl na ' This development has taken place without any corresponding benefit to the Treasury, the whole of the profits going into the private purse of the Minister. As there is every reason for believing the revenue from this source to be already of considerable value, and that a great extension of business would take place concurrently with the improvement in the administration of the provinces, it would appear advisable to bring the Ministry into accord with the various other revenue-producing sources of income; in other words, to make it one of the Departments of State administered in the interests of Government and the people. No. 10.— Ministry of Telegraphs. The tenour of my remarks in the preceding paper on the Ministry of Posts applies Proposal for the also in great measure to the sister Department of Telegraphs. abolition of the mono- In one respect there is a difference, viz., that the Minister accounts annually for a sum and creation of 19,000 tomans to the Imperial Treasury.

I would strongly urge the advisability of Government dealing directly with the Telegraphs, and of making the Minister a public servant instead of a private monopolist. No. 11.— Ministry of Pensions and Charitable Bequests. The interests which are at stake on the above account are doubtless great, demanding The Ministry, the full attention of a competent Ministry ; at the same time reforms are not of such immediate importance as, for instance, in the Departments of Interior, Finance, or Justice. It would be politic to allow the reorganization of pensions, together with inquiry into the management of charitable bequests, to wait over till some progress had been made in other Departments. Following on the installation of the Ministry, the influence of the Minister should be Pro osals f th extended in the provinces by the agency of a permanent staff.

Before the agents, however, could take up the ordinary routine of duty the Minister Preparatory steps would be obliged to have recourse to special Committees. These would visit the provinces necessary, and reyiew the pensions and charitable bequests in detail as well as in general. The reports would be studied by the Minister, discussed by the Council of Ministers, and finally threshed out by the Council of State. The agents would then be placed in possession of registration lists, be given details of pensions or bequests. The legal trustee would, as befoie, carry out the conditions of the bequests, the agent having the ri°'ht to interfere as soon as mismanagement became apparent. What the final effect of a business direction of this Department would be can best be [668] ‘ Kguaged by the monetary interests at stake, interests said to mean the expenditure of several million tomans per annum.

He had not touched wine until he went to Europe, but since he enjoys it. He is forgiving, but if once a man plays unfair with him, although he forgives, yet he does not have such confidence in him that he had before. He is rather vain, fond of society, patriotic. His success and the copious favours he has received and receives from the Shah have caused a great jealousy by his fellow-Ministers against him, and this immediately after the Shah’s return from Europe in 1889, when he was greatly working in the interests of the English enterprise, viz., Concession for the road to Shush ter, Regie, mining, &amp;c., all of which were against the Russian political interests. ^ His enemies, viz., Amin-u-Dowleh, late Mushire-u-Dowleh, Naib-us-Saltaneh, Zil-us- Sultan, Sahibi Dewan, Azud-ul-Mulk, Kavam-ud-Dowleh, and nearly all the attendants of the Palace were working against him, intriguing at the same time with the Russian Minister and M. Spyrs to bring troubles on him. , ^, . . , . , . The most unpopular English institution of all was the Regie, against which, with the intrigues of the Naib*us-Saltaneh, M. Biitzow made a protest in 1890 before that enterprise was inaugurated. . a Sadre Azam, with the counsel of this Legation, fought the Russian Minister and proved to him that the Persian Government were not bound by the Treaty not to grant a monopoly to any one they liked. _ „ , o , * , ^ i The conduct of the manager of the Regie, in spite oi the Sadre Azam s continual advice for the quiet w r orking enterprise, roused first the interested merchants in this f rj *h e and then the people against the Regie, which gave the Russian Minister here and his Consul-General at Tabriz, as well as the enemies of Sadre Azam, the most favourable opportunity and instrument, one to thwart British interest and destroy their opponent, and the other (Sadre Azam’s enemies) to ruin him completely. So they began to work against the Recrie, which they reckoned would naturally ruin the Sadre Azam. In this scheme both the enemies of Sadre Azam and the Russians succeeded in the abolition of this enterprise; and no doubt, if not entirely ruined His Highness, still his influence with the Shah and his popularity with the people were much impaired, nor in such a momentous time, according to his own confidential conversation with Mr. Greene and myself, he received anv practical help from our Legation, for whose interest, he grieveci to say, la From that time, and by other incidents which happened since, Sadre Azam’s real influence with the Shah began to fade, and His Majesty, through the constant intrigues of the Naib-us-Saltaneh and Zil-us-Sultan and others, is impressed with a conviction that Sadre Azam has been the cause of getting him into debt to the English Company. The Russian Minister, having succeeded in his scheme and haying got the better over his opponent, thought it advisable to wdn the one man’s friendship whom he pieferred to the others, nevertheless, they were his colleagues in the scheme. The opportunitv afforded him in 1892, when Sadre Azam fell out with the Shah and. sent in his resignation, which His Majesty did not accept. I hen the Russian Minister came in and showed his friendship and help. He had an audience with the Shah and advised His Majesty to reconcile Sadre Azam, as no other Minister could do any good for him except. Amin-us-Sultan, &amp;c. The reconciliation was made and His Highness was in that year raised to the position of Sadre Azam. The Russian Minister took the credit to himself, and took a good care also to make it known to all the world that he ivas the cause of reinstating the Sadre Azam. 1 , From that time Sadre Azam, discouraged by abolition of the Regie and othei English, enterprises which were, through Ids assistance, introduced, and by the callous indifference of his Master in bettering the state of his country, he has become comparatively careless m the affairs of the country in general, and submits to the wishes of the Shah with foibeaung disgust. Now and then his patience gives way and attempts to resign and quarrels with the° Shah, but those round him, such as his relations and his proteges, force him to be reconciled. . , . . f , ^ , His friends, that is real friends, are few, I may say none than nib wife and family, but those who now profess to be his loyal friends are Amin Khelv at, Ikbal-u-Howleh, Mushire-ul-Mulk, and a few more in the same standing, but these men to begin with are not influential enough, nor, I think, if Sadre Azam came to grief would stand by hirn. Vali Ahd professes a great friendship for Sadre Azana, but we know what sort of weak creature he is, wdiose assistance, as long as the Shah lives, is of no avail to his Highness the Sadre Azam, and in the event of the Shah’s death he may be influenced by those around him against Sadre Azam. I have heard repeatedly from Sadre Azam in our confidential conveisation, saying that he rather would be a peasant in Europe than in his present situation heie, in which, position he cannot do any good for his country under this present Shah, who, he said, has not a particle of patriotism in him, and thinks nothing for the country, but a greed for money and w r omen. Nor, he said, it is any use trying to make him do anything. He was telling me these words with most painful feelings. * tt?- a &amp; (Signed) NAWAB.

Memo) andum by I/icutoncint-Colonel Picot on Past and Pvesent Policy in Persia. (Confidential.) HITHERTO om effoits at reform in Persia have been directed towards the extension of its commerce, or to the development of its internal resources, in the vain hope of thereby materially improving the finances or adding to the stability of the country. Such efforts have ended in failure, the finances have steadily gone from bad to worse, the country has lost rather than gained in stability, and British prestige has to some extent declined. Failuie^ may be traced to such causes as the fear of His Majesty that reform might lead to a diminution of his power, the complete disorganization of the public services, the inability of the Central Government to protect foreigners, and, lastly, the nervous jealousy of Russia. Setting on one side for the moment the question of Russian jealousy, the history of the past few years has shown clearly the impossibility of introducing reform by means of the ordinary civilizing methods of trade without, as a preparatory step, clearing the ground by the introduction of elementary reform in the country itself. ' We have, in other'words, essayed to cure an internal disorder by the application of external remedies. We should have directed our effort at the administration itself, for maladministration is at the root of all the evil from which Persia now suffers, and I am convinced that no good ran come except following on a reorganization of the system of government. What that system is I have attempted to make clear in Part I of my notes on “ Administration.^ In Part II, always adhering to the principle that the salvation of Persia depends primarily on internal reform, I have traced out the broad lines on which that reform mi^ht take its course. The next question is by what means or persuasion can Persia be induced to act energetically on her own behalf. Experience has proved both the inability and unwilling ness of the official classes to carry out any measures of reform, and has demonstrated that foreign pressure alone can supply the necessary motive power towards progress. Hitherto jealousy, commercial or political, has always prevented'England and Russia from exercising joint pressure ; whatever the cause of jealousy, its effects, as far as England is concerned, cannot be deemed satisfactory. We have only partially succeeded in our trading purposes, Persia remains weak, and Russia advances steadily in influence and authority; added to this non-success, the struggle has engendered a bitter feeling between ourselves and our rivals. With these resultants I venture to think some doubt may be expressed of the value of the line of policy adopted in the past. In my opinion nothing short of war can prevent the spread of Russian influence in Northern Persia. The logic of facts proves this to be a hopeless task, and there is little doubt she will acquire a predominance in the affairs of the north. The old lines of policy, therefore, having failed to create a strong Persia, con siderations of a fresh departure naturally arise. It is possible that Russia would meet us half-way were a proposal formulated adequately defining the legitimate spheres of commercial activity of either nation. The advantages of such a course are obvious, and I can see no sufficient reason for objecting to Russia pushing all purely commercial schemes in such manner as she may think fit. Part of the agreement would necessarily include joint action in restoring order in the financial and internal administration of the country, as without such action disintegration and political division would inevitably follow. It is also possible that Russia might be willing to come to an understanding as regards the limitation of our respective spheres of influence, and yet be unwilling to touch the country on the vital question of reform, suggesting, perhaps, a* partial control of certain branches of administration—of the Customs or Mint, for instance. Such suggestion should, I venture to think, be accepted with caution, as without concurrent reform in Finance, Interior, and Justice, political division would rapidly result. It should be a sine qud non that foreign interference should go hand in hand with progress in internal adminis tration. The last contingency is of Russia preferring the status quo and of refusing to co-operate at all. In that case little can be done, except to again approach His Majesty, and to make him understand that all political assistance will be contingent on administrative reform It would also seem necessary to assert ourselves more confidently, and to let it be known that we are as keenly alive to our interests in the south as Russia is in the north. Financial assistance, in'whatever form, should be made dependent on material conces sion. His Majesty is at this moment seeking relief from the burden entailed by the Regie debt. He hints that Her Majesty’s Government could readily obtain half-a-million of money, pay off the Regie debt, and reimpose the same at a lower rate of interest, say at 4 per cent, thereby benefiting Persia at once to the extent of 10,000/. I know nothing of the difficulties which may stand in the way of the furtherance of' -iT *' 39 0 this scheme, but if it were thought desirable to assist His Majesty in this or in any other manner financially, I would suggest that two separate guarantees should be demanded (other, of course, than the Customs guarantee of the southern ports). The first is the opening of the Upper Karun to British trade, with permission to run commercial steamers on its waters. His Majesty does not apparently favour this project, fearing, it is said, the develop ment of our trading Companies on the lines of the old East India Company—an idea fostered by Russia and France. The Sadr Azm is probably also interested in retaining a Persian monopoly above Ahwaz, for rumour declares that he has a financial interest in the Nasiri Company ; in any case, neither the weak fears of the Shah, nor Court intrigue, should be allowed to stand in the way. I attach much importance to the opening out of the Karun, not that British trade is likely to develop by leaps and bounds, but because, till in direct touch with Shuster and Dizful, we shall never be able to compel Persia to open up the roads radiating therefrom, or to insist on the tribes being kept in order. The second guarantee is one that should safeguard our interests against such action as was taken by Russia a few years ago, when she obtained a concession giving her the power to block all railway construction in Persia till the year 1900. This concession struck directly at British development in the south, and showed how regardless Persia can be on occasion of the interests of Great Britain. (Signed) H.

PICOT, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military AttaclU. Memorandum respecting “News Agencies of Central Asia and the Caucasus.” (Confidential.) During the war scare of 1885 about the only information we had regarding the move ments of Russian troops into Trans-Caspia Avas from the telegrams and reports of Mr. Peacock, the Consul at Batoum. Since then the Consulate-General at Meshed has been established, and a watch is kept on the various cantonments of Trans-Caspia as far north as Samarkand. As a rule our reports record the movements of Russian troops only after their arrival in Trans-Caspia. This is not sufficient; what avc require is early and accurate information of activity in the Caucasus, in Baku, Petrovsk, or Astrakan. We may, I think, take it for granted that Russia will foresee coming events, and gradually prepare for the struggle by timely concentrations. Long before the outbreak of hostilities her troops Avill be quietly moving towards Trans-Caspia and Khorassan by way of the Caucasus, and to the Oxus by Orenbourgh and Siberia; whilst both Astrakan and Tashkend Avill be pouring in supplies by the Trans-Caspia Railway system. It is at this time early information AA’ill be of the utmost importance. Our only source at present is Mr. Stevens, the Consul at Batoum, and his powers are limited to watching the arrivals and departures of Russian troops at Batoum from Odessa. He has no funds, neither has he any special organization for recording the movements of troops across the Caspian. Some years ago we had a Consul at Tiflis, but the appointment was allowed to drop with the departure of Mr. Lyall. The re-establishment of this post does not appear to be a matter of great moment, more especially as such a measure might lead Russia to demand similar concessions in India. On the Caspian itself we have no Consular officer. The Consul at Resht, in Persia, is Some 20 miles inland from the port of Enzileh, and is entirely removed from all chances of getting news of any movements that may be going on in Russian ports to the north. His value for such purposes is practically nil. [ 668 ] M40 The question I would now ask is, would it be worth while supplementing our News Agencies in Central Asia by the establishment of other and similar Agencies at Tiflis, Baku, Petrovsk, and Astrakan. We now expend a large sum of money on a system which may fail at the most critical time, and would probably fail on the outbreak of war. It supplies us with doubtful, yet useful, information regarding the present development of Russian resources in Central Asia, but can give no indication of those preparatory movements of which it is vital to us to have the earliest information. There is no reason for thinking any prohibitive expense would be incurred in thus extending the field of our observations, but this can only be determined after consultation with Mr. Stevens at Batoum. As regards the other question touched upon, viz., of Russian operations by Orenbourgh and Siberia, I am afraid we must remain, as at present, dependent on such rumours and reports as come by way of Afghanistan, Kashghar, and Meshed, checked to a great extent by our knowledge of the resources of the Oxus regions, and the activity displayed by Russia in other parts of her Empire.

During the last two years, dating from the arrival of Her Majesty’s Consul-General in Tabriz in 1893, much correspondence has taken place on the subject of Her Majesty’s Consulate-General. Mr. Wood pointed out that tire means placed at his disposal for the maintenance of the dignity of his position and the prestige of the British Government were such as could not bear comparison with those of his foreign colleagues, consequently the Consulate occupied a very secondary and humiliating position. Mr. Wood went to some trouble to prove his statements, and compared the relative positions of the various Consulates in so far as their emoluments and staff are concerned. Extracts from his letters of the 26th November, 1894, and the comparative statement, are attached.* It will be seen that Her Majesty’s Consul-General receives a salary of 6501. per annum, with 270/. for office allowances, and is provided with an unfurnished house, at one time Her Majesty’s Legation in Persia. The Russian Consul-General receives a salary of 2,000/. per annum, has a furnished town and country house, six horses, and carriages provided by Government, besides many public servants, and is, in addition, assisted by a large staff consisting of two Secretaries, two Mirzas, two clerks. The Secretaries are paid for at the rate of 880 gold imperials, the Mirzas 100/. per annum. All are provided with quarters. The French Consul receives 800/. per annum, 400/. allowances. He is assisted by a Vice-Consul on a salary of 228/., and a Mirza paid at the rate of 23 tomans per mensem. All have free quarters. The Turkish Consul-General draws about 1,020/. per annum, is assisted by a paid Vice-Consul and Attache. All with free quarters. An examination of the foregoing shows that the staff maintained by Russia is much larger than that of the other Powers. Russian interests are doubtless greater, and her expenditure is in proportion; her case, therefore, as regards expenditure, does not appear to offer a fair field for comparison. As regards the other Consulates the position is otherwise, and there should be at least no great disparity between the means and advantages allotted to Her Majesty’s Consul- General and those enjoyed by his Turkish and French colleagues. Mr. Wood, however, maintains that a great disparity does exist, and that his means are such as do not admit of his performing his duties, social and political, in a manner befitting the Representative of Government. The details already given explain that Her Majesty’s Consul-General receives 650/. per annum as against 1,200/. of the French Consul, and 1,020/. of the Turkish Consul-General, or a difference of 550/. and 370/. respectively. For the sake of argument the Vice-Consuls attached to the latter Consulates need not be considered, as their emoluments may be taken to represent the sum set apart as office allowance in the British Consulate. The actual difference of salary is very great, and it is evident that Her Majesty’s Consul-General is not as well equipped for the part he is expected to play as those of the other Powers. After a visit to Tabriz, and some study of the conditions of life in that city, I may venture to give it as my opinion that it is impossible for any one to properly carry out his duties on a salary of 650/. per annum. It is difficult to reconcile the fact that the Consulate at Resht is paid for at the rate * Apparently omitted by mistake. Lieutenant-Colonel Picot is not now here, and I cannot lay my hand on the comparative statement. But this note will serve the purpose.—H. M. D,, September 29. A comparative statement was sent to the Foreign Office by Mr. Wood in his despatch No. 1 of the 3rd January, 1893. r 441 °f &lt; 5002 . per annum whilst that at Tabriz receives only 650/. The reduction of the former ^ P°S o le status of a \ ice-Consulate would effect a large saving, and perhaps it might be Tabriz t0 Utl 126 a I ’ arfc ° f tJiat savin S towards improving the position of the post at An additional 200/. per annum seems to be absolutely necessary to place Her Maiesty's Consulate-General on a proper footing. J : Another alternative, and the only one which presents itself to my mind, is that an othcer with large private means should be appointed, to whom the loss of 200/. or 300/. a-year would be a matter of no great moment.

In a Memorandum dated the 1st July, 1895, on the subject of “News Agencies of en lal Asia and the Caucasus/ 5 I made a reference to Her Majesty’s Consulate at Resht, fn a ri as regards furnishing any information of Russian movements on the Caspian, this Consulate could render little or no assistance. Further inquiries have led me to question the necessity or advisability of maintaining an officer of the rank of Consul at a post where British interests can be so little served as at the place m question. The staff at Resht consists of one Consul and a native Assistant: the total cost, not including incidental expenses, being 750/. per annum. The duties of Her Majesty’s Consul extend to the Provinces of Mazanderan and Gilan, and are presumably both political and commercial. On the east is the important town of Astrabad, with its port of Bander Gez. There Russia does a large import trade, watched by a Consul at Astrabad, and a Vice-Consul at Bander Gez (generally the agent of the Mercury Company line of steamers). The exports consist of cotton, raisins, rice, wool, &amp;c.; the imports of sugar, cotton goods, tea, peti oieum, &amp;c. British trade is hardly worth mentioning, and our interests are sufficiently seived by a native agent, who sends information of tribal movements on the Atrek and Gui gan,^ and general reports on the state of the province. iv/r ■^f^'^ eam f rs on this side of the Caspian ply from Ozanada to Bander Gez and Meshed-i-Sar. They proceed no further west, the consequence being that Astrabad has ecome an outpost of Tehran, not of Resht, and all reports are sent direct to Her -l ajestys Minister at Tehran. Once every two or three years the Consul makes a tour to Astrabad, and renews his acquaintance with the province. The next port, and the more important, is that of Meshed-i-Sar, the outlet for Baiturush and Mazanderan. Here again Russia does a large export and import trade, mu a§ alread y e ^P^ a i n 6d, is a town lying 20 miles inland from the port of Enzileh. e trade is almost entirely with Russia. English merchants compete on a small scale in certam classes of cotton goods, a competition becoming every year more and more difficult. British enterprise is further represented by a branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia, established to facilitate exchange operations. This business has so far not been very lucrative. J It is possible that a second branch may be opened at Meshed-i-Sar, as the manager has an idea of profiting by the large exchange, and of engaging directly in the trade with Russian houses ; however, this is entirely problematical. Commercially, therefore, it would appear that our Consul has but little chance of pushing British trade. Politically, his influence is still more questionable. At one time Astrabad was thou&lt;dit politically to be a place of importance, owing to its proximity to the countries of the Yamut and Tekke Turkomans. This led to the Consular appointments of Captain Lovett and Colonel Stewart; but whatever importance the place may have had in the past, such has entirely ceased with the Russian occupation of the Trans-Caspian regions, and this was so far recognized as to lead to the abolition of the Consulate some years ago. Resht is even less favourably situated, and the presumption that the Consul can be of any political value may be dismissed as incorrect. There may be other reasons, of which I am in ignorance, necessitating the main tenance of an officer of the rank of British Consul at Resht; but, as regards our commercial interests, I am of opinion that equally good and sufficient service could be performed by a Vice-Consul. 3 (Signed) H.

WITH reference to Sadre Azam’s confidential conversation about the loan^ &amp;c. 3 my own private opinion and advice would be that if the English Government ever wished to do anything in return for the friendly actions of Sadre Azam since Sir A. Nicolson’s time, as he (Sadre Azam) believes has done a great deal in reviving our influence, this was the opportunity for us to kill two birds with one shot, i.e., to oblige Sadre Azam in getting him out of the mesh, and at the same time, through him, to get something from the Persian Government assuring our continual paramount influence in this country. Should our Government shut their ears to your advice, His Highness will, under circumstances, seek some other remedy, which no doubt would be through the Russians, when the result no doubt will be injurious to our influence in this country.
