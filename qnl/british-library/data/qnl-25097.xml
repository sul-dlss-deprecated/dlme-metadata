India in connection with the additional troops sent to Persia only charges for the 39th Central India Horse have been debited. Does the Political Secretary concur in the 'view of this Dept, that the moiety of the charges incurved on account of the despatch of some 290 officers and men of the 79th Carv.atic Infantry, stationed at Bushire, should also form, the subject of special claims on the Foreign Office? The 520 officers and men of the 7th Raj puts would appear to form the authorised normal consular etc, guards, with the exception of the additional men at Jask stationed there in connection with the arms traffic operations, and of the detachment sent temporarily to Lingah (?from Jask) on account of a threatened attack on that place. It is assumed that the charges on account of the latter may also be regarded as arising out of the arms traffic operations and debitable, therefore, wholly to Indian revenues. (Signed) W, Robinson.

Sir, Foreign Office^ October 17, 1911. IN consequence of the anarchy which has recently prevailed at Shiraz and of Oie insecurity of the trade routes down to the Persian Golf, it has been found necessary to send troops from India to Southern Persia. The recommendation made by Mis Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire a month ago was that the mounted escorts at Ispahan, Bushire, Kerman, and Bunder Abbas should each be increased by 100 men ; the escort at Shiraz by 200 ; that a vice-consulate should be established at Bam with an escort of 200; and that these escorts should be employed to protect British caravans. These recommendations have been supported by His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, and the Government of India, who were consulted on the subject, have proposed a scheme which involves the employment of two native regiments and their distribution at the places mentioned above, they pointed out that the cost of mule transport and of providing barrack accommodation would be very considerable, and they asked that two-thirds of the expenditure might be borne by the Imperial Government. It has been decided to dispatch one native cavalry regiment at once to Persia, to be stationed mainly at Shiraz with, possibly, a detachment at Ispahan. I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to take the earliest opportunity of bringing this matter to the notice of'the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. Further information will be supplied in due course with regard to the actual numbei of tioops and their destinations, but in the meantime it is important to consider what proportion of the cost should fall upon the Imperial Government and from what vote such expenditure should be defrayed. ? , , ^ , Sir E Grev sees no sufficient reason why lbs Majesty s Government should undei- take to pay more than one-half of the outlay involved, hut even that share would amount to a much larger sum than could be made available from the diplomatic and consular vote and it appears to him that the dispatch of troops for the protection of British subjects in Southern Persia, owing to the general state of insecurity now existing, cannot be regarded in the same light as the maintenance of small escorts at the principle diplomatic and consular posts in that country. ^ ’ LOUIS MALLET.

UcJt ^ ac visers consider that it would be preferable to send two regiments of Native Cavalry distributed as follows ^Shiraz area, 1 squadron at BusWre ^squadrons and headquarters at Shiraz, 1 squadron at Isfahan; Kerman area 1 squadron at Bunder Abbas, 1 squadron at Kerman, 2 squadrons addi io^tTP - S a * ba, ', wltl l new Vice-Oonsulate. This only entails small c dition to Cox s pioposal and we are issuing orders for men to be held in readiness It seems likely that troops will be required for one or two years possibly longer, and cost will be heavy. Existing accommodation at the places indicated is non-existent, and barracks or shelters and stabling must be provided. Regiments must take their full complement of mules from India, in view of predominance of British trade and of inevitable necessity ot protecting foreign as well as British and Indian trade, once that.protective measures are undertaken, we trust that the’ Imperial Exchequer will agree to bear not less than two thirds of entire cost. We do not anticipate great difficulty in regard to supply and transport tor squadrons proceeding from Bushire to Shiraz and Isfahan, but extensive arrangements will ^probably be necessary for squadrons proceeding from Bunder Abbas to Kerman and Bam, and Cox should receive earliest possible instructions immediately decision to send troops is arrived at. Military authorities point out that addition of travelling escorts of cavalrv will add to our -polmcal responsibilities unless it is held that attacks on these escorts will not be considered as furnishing cause for punitive expeditions hut will be punished by reprisals of another kind, such as line, &amp;c.’ Although a decision in this sense may be accepted in principle, it is useless to close our eyes to the fact that a successful attack upon and destruction of a convoy by a powerful tribe would entail punitive measures, if only to keep roads open. These are risks which cannot be overlooked, and eacli case must be dealt with on its merits. The proposal entails military measures, costly in themselves, in the interior of Persia for a period of which it is impossible to foresee the duration. These are not unlikely to involve our officers and men in conflict with local administration. It has hitherto been our policy to confine our efforts to maintaining order in Gulf ports by the action of our ships and an occasional interests and residents in those ports. The policy now advocated may, as pointed out by His Majesty’s Minister, precipitate events in Shiraz/will undoubtedly extend our responsibilities in the interior, and might under ce rtain circ umstances lead to a military occupation of Southern Persia, a measure that /; we believe His Majesty’s Government have every desire to avoid.
