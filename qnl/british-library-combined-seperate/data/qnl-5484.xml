Their correspondence contains numerous military reports about Turkish troop and transport movements, the progress of the conflict between Turkish and Arab forces, and the state of the country and inhabitants of Yemen Vilayet, particularly the capital Sana’a, the Red Sea port town of Hodeida, and Asir in Saudi Arabia.
