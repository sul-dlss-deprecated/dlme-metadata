The meeting had primarily been called to consider the best means of obtaining the co-»operation of the British and other Governments concerned in the early provision of the ground facilities which are an essential preliminary to the Empire Air Mail Scheme. Memoranda had been circulated to the Departments represented at the meeting setting out the suggestions of the Air Ministry which envisaged that a small Delegation, consisting of representatives of the Air Ministry and the Post Office should visit the various countries at an early date to discuss on the spot with the appropriate authorities the financial and technical aspects of the scheme and endeavour to secure their co-operation. 2. The Post Office representative explained that his Department are anxious to do all they can to assist but they would not be able to give a decision on the question of a Post Office representative accompanying the Delegation until the return of Sir F. Williamson to this country probably about 26th April next. From the Air Ministry point of view, it was regarded as important that the Delegation should leave England at the end of April. It was decided, however, to proceed with the discussion on the assumption that a Post Office representative* would proceed with the Delegation at that time; any mention of the Delegation meantime would refer to 'a party of technical experts' 3. The Treasury representatives said that in principle they had no objections to offer to the proposals in the Air Ministry memorandum, nor to the suggested visit of a Delegation to negotiate with the authorities concerned. The Treasury would like, hov/ever, to be clear as to the extent of the powers of the delegation to enter into final commitments v/ith the various Governments. T&amp;ey also had certain drafting points which they would communicate separately. Invitation to Palestine and Iraq. The Air Ministry representatives explained that in the case of three countries which lie along the England - Australia air route, namely, Egypt, Palestine and Iraq, it was proposed to ask each of the Governments to participate in the scheme and to contribute postal payments but not subsidies apart from a sura equivalent to the landing and housing fees v/hich would be incurred by Imperial Airways aircraft, coupled with exemotion from taxes on fuel and oil.The Treasury representatives enquired whether these proposals would not he likely to cause difficulties with the other Governments who were being asked for a subsidy in addition to a postal payment* The Post Office representative pointed out that, uhless the countries concerned were actually making some contribution, other than the postal payment, towards the cost of maintaining the air service, their admission to the scheme would, under the Postal Union Convention, be illegal. Indian 5 C With regard to the Treasury enquiry, the In dia Office difficulty ,represe ntati ve thought that the Government of India might raise difficulties on the grounds that the terms offered to Iraq and Egypt * both non-British states - were more favourable than those offered to India, They might feel that it should be possible to reduce India’s contribution by obtaining subsidy payments from Iraq and Egypt, Moreover, the inclusion of Iraq in the scheme was not contemplated when the Government of India were originally informed of the proposals. Her inclusion might mean that India would not be able to levy surcharges on air mails from India to Iraq and to this extent the amount allowed in the estimates of the scheme as receipts from surcharges on air mails for foreign countries would be reduced. On the subsidy payments point the Air Ministry represe n tatives explained that, as the distance between England and Egypt was relatively short, it had not been considered that sufficient advantage would accrue to Egypt under the scheme to justify her being asked for a subsidy s In the case of Iraq, it was also considered inadvisable to ask for a subsidy payment in view of the large expenditure which the Iraqi Government is to be asked to incur on improvement of the ground organization there*, Account was also taken in this connection of the competitioh from Dutch and French air services which operate to and across Iraq. Even if Egypt and Palestine did not participate in the scheme, the aircraft carrying capacity which had been budgeted for would still have to be provided and financial provision made therefor; whilst it was hoped to bring in Iraq as a part compensation for the possible failure to secure full participation in the scheme from all the countries invited or to be invited, cf« Malta. It was appreciated that because, inter alia, of the possible reduction of India's anticipated receipts from surcharges on foreign outgoing mails, resulting from the proposed inclusion of Iraq in the scheme, the Government of India would have to be informed of the present proposals. It was agreed, therefore, that unless these questions had already been discussed with the authorities in India by the United Kingdom Mission which had recently visited that country, the Government of India should be informed by telegraph of the proposed inclusion of Iraq in the scheme and asked whether they had any observations to oxTer.V Xraq» Landi ng A Housing fees . Palestine and Iraq Postal computation. Iraq Meteoro logical facilities. The Foreign Office representative foresaw son« difficulty as regards Iraq with regard to the question of their paying to Imperial Airways Ltd. a sum as a set-off against tne charges to be incurred for landing and housing of the Company’s aircraft in Iraq. If such a payment were made, foreign countries entitled to most-favoured-nation treatment in Iraq might claim similar treatment in respect of their national air companies operating to that territory. The question was raised as to whether it would be possible to cover such payments by an adjustment of the postal contribution required from Iraq* 7o The Post Office representative said that his Department were strongly of the opinion that the postal payments should be based on mail loads and not on elements entirely unconnected with postal arrangements. This had been the uniform basis in calculating the contributions of all the other participants in the scheme. This position was appreciated by the meeting and it was agreed that the adjustment of landing and housing fees, plus exemption from fuel taxes (if necessary) would have to be attempted on the basis of an equivalent subsidy payment* 8 . Meteorological facilities in Iraq have up to the present - been provided by the Royal Air Force but it is considered that the Iraqi Government, as a party to the International Air Convention, should now assume responsi bility for the provision and maintenance of a meteorological service there. The existing facilities are not considered adequate for the needs of the Royal Air Force and civil aviation, and the establishment of additional observation stations is necessary at certain points. If the Iraqi Government desired to use the Royal Air Force system, it was proposed to press for payment in respect of such user, leaving them to recover from the operating companies. It would probably be desirable that a meteorological expert should accompany the proposed Delegation to Iraq to discuss the question with the authorities there. Egypt « 9o The meteorological expert could also consult with Meteorological the Egyptian Authorities on the question of the meteorological i fa cilities, facilities required in Egypt. . He would have the opportunity of discussing with the Air Ministry Signals Representative at Cairo the W/T questions which would arise in this connection. Palestine. IQ* With regard to Palestine, the Colonial Office representative thought that if the Palestine Government agreed to pay to Imperial Airways Ltd* an amount to offset the charges for landing and housing fees, the Dutch Government could, in view of the terras of the Palestine Mandate, claim similar treatment in respect of the K.L.M. company. Moreover, the Palestine Government are incurring large expenditure on the provision and equipment of aerodromes at Lydda and elsewhere, and, although the capital expenditure is not being recovered they will still need to recoup themselves from the landing and housing fees of aircraft to cover maintenance costs. The question of Gaza Aerodrome was discussed and the Air Ministry representative stated that if Lydda were fully equipped, no additional facilities would be required at Gaza. This would mean a saving of £7,000 on the original estimates.T rcna .jordan Peraicin gulf. Gwada r. to Karachi, Malta. Purchase o f The Treasury representatives raised no objection to the proposal that the expenditure in Transjordan should be borne by the Air Ministry. The Colonial Office representative said that his Department would inform the Transjordan Administration of the proposals. 12 0 With regard to the Persian Gulf, the In di a Office representatives thought that certain of the Sheikhs along the Arabian Coast might prove a little difficult on the question of the provision of additional facilities in their territory and that some delay might be involved on that account. It was explained in this connection that it would take about twelve months to obtain the necessary equipment,, The India Office would instruct the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to meet the United Kingdom Delegation either at Baghdad or Basrah, whichever was considered moat convenient, to discuss the question of the technical requirements along the Arabian Coast. The cost of the equipment would have to be borne by the Air Ministry. It was explained that the Air Ministry now found that it would be necessary to provide lightIng^faSilities between Bahrein and Gwadar in order to permit of this section being flown by night in the westbound direction. The cost, which would be additional to that set out in the original proposals, would amount to some £40,000. The Treasury representatives took note of this new proposal, 13„ As regards Gwadar, which is in Muscat territory, the Air Ministry would have to provide the necessary equipment as neither the Muscat Authorities nor the Government of India could accept this responsibility. It was hoped on the part of the Air Ministry, however, that after the equipment was installed, the Government of India would undertake to maintain it as an agency service. A few supplementary facilities (cost £7,000) were necessary between Gwadar and Karachi, but these would be the responsibility of Indiac 14. The question of including Malta in the scheme had been considered f but as the proposals might not offer sufficient attraction to the Maltese Government, the Air Ministry had not assumed that Malta would participate fully in the scheme. The Colonial Office representative considered, however, that the Government of Malta should be given the opportunity of participating in the scheme if they so desire. It was pointed out in reply that the inclusion of Malta, which would be welcomed by tiie Air Ministry, would, by reason of the increased load, involve the addition of another service to those envisaged in the scheme, if British West Africa and Iraq also came into the scheme. These two countries were not originally included in the Estimates, but allowance has to be made for possible refusals by Egypt ard/or Malta. 15. On the question of the purchase of the technical equipment required under the scheme the Air Mi nistry represent a tives contemplated that, to ensure uniformity of pattern, it would be purchased in this country. Moreover, better terms could be secured by the placing of bulk orders. The Treasury repr e sentatives considered that it was important that this should be stipulated in any arrangements made for capital advances, as the provision of large sums of money from the United Kingdom exchequer for the purchase of foreign equipment could not be justified. The Air Ministry senta1 1 yea suggested and the Treasury rep resentativ^aCo5. agreed that the Delegation should be empowered, if this course should prove necessary, to offer advances up to the full capital cost of the equipment on condition that it is purchased in the United Kingdom. It was agreed that communications should be sent forthwith to the various Governments concerned on the lines of the draft prepared by the Air Ministry. The draft would require to be amended to meet each particular case, and the Departmental representatives concerned undertook to revise the draft accordingly. In this connection it could be provisionally assumed that the Delegation would arrive at Baghdad in the first week in May and in Palestine and Egypt during the second week in May.EMPIRE AtHVAYS GROUND 0HGANI3ATI0N BAHREIN » KARACHI ROUTE (LuVKDPLAKES ) COST OP ADD ITI ONAL RISQUIRjaTENTS . a- Vote 8o Remarks Total tireless Light!

In general it may be stated that the total capital cost is estimated at £8,0fC for Tgyot, and £26,0'0 for Iraq* The case of Palestine is complicated somewhat by the fact that arrangements are understood to be already in contemplation for new airports at Tydda and Haifa, which rill largely meet the situation, combined with certain intermediate beacons, which it is believed can be obtained without difficulty by arrangements with the Oil Companieso There remains* however, the problem of whether Gaza should be retained as a port of call and, if so, whether additional equipment will not be necessary to the extent of £6,CCC„ In addition, there is the question of Transjordanla, where equipment is required to the value of roughly £1C y OCC« It should be observed, parenthetically, that these estimates of costs are necessarily somev/hat hypothetical at this stageo Reliable estimates can only be formulated in the light of discussion of the requirements on the spotc The case of Transjordania v/ill clearly call for acceptance by the Air Ministry of the major responsibility for the cost, having regard to the conditions obtaining in i | that country. Similarly the Air Ministry will need to \ l meet the cost of the facilities between Basra and Gwadar, \where India take over resoonsibility© It vrill howeverbe necessary for early orranf^erents to be made for ?uch 7 . ? ork to be put in hand and for pome oooortunity to be afforded for the Air Ministry technical reoresentative to a:et in touch with the Political Resident on the Persian Gulf on the one hand* and the Transjordan authorities on the other&gt; It is hooed that some means of achieving this can be formulated at the prooosed Inter-Departmental meeting&lt;. It also aopears desirable to indicate the basis which the Air Ministry have in mind for meeting the difficulties likely to be apprehended in dealing with the Steyotian and Iraq Governments • Clearly* the caoital esost will be a difficulty and it ma?/- be necessary to offer an advance lump sum payment* to cover an agreed orooortion of the fifteen years' payments which would be due from Imperial Airways in respect of their user of the around facilities during the oeriod of the scheme» In this vjey f the principle would be preserved of requiring the local Government to acceot resoonsibillty for provision of the ground organisation, whilst they would be able to recover corresponding Payments from other national companies. It is hoped at the same time to secure seme adjustment on similar lines of the present position whereby the Meteorological organisation of the R&lt;.A U\ in Iraq does work for the Iraq Government (viz* for the Iran Air Force and the civil aviation of that country) and also affords facilities to other national companies* opart from Imperial Airways The total value of such services is estimated at 1 , 4*000 o.a.&gt;; and, nrima facie* a case exists for arguing that the Iraq Government should assume responsibility for the service« If they desire to continue to avail themselves of our services, then they should make the payment of £4,0'. 0 Doe, and recover from the various Parties concerned ,It will be appreciated that the issues involved are somewhat coinoXex and that this note cannot do more than n;iTe a rreneral outlinec It is honed that the Inter- Departmental Conference may be able to formulate detailed recommendations to regulate the procedure and ensure earlymt FT Ul)i&gt;:.

FKO;: 19?7 0 His Britannic .‘tnjesty’s Governr.ent in the Tinited l-ingdon. have, as announced in the House of Oor.r.ons in December last, decided to introduce as from 1937, a new policy whereby all first-class mail matter, pasrin;' between countries embraced within the British Commonwealth ot Nations and served by the present Kmpire air routes, shall be sent by uir* In pursuance of this policy, it is contemplated to intensify the organisation, to speed-up the journey schedules, and to increase the frequency and capacity of the services.. The scheme, in fact, involves a step forward in the development of long-uistunce air services which will for the first time maKe it possible to secure all the advantages of air transport for first class mail,, without any serious financial disadvantage c It 7 /ill be obvious that such a scheme can offer exceptional opportunities to countries, located along the routes and not themselves operating air services* It is hoped, therefore that the Government of will favourably consider the possibility of entering into arrangements with the Government of the United -kingdom for I the transport under this scheme of all their first class mail to and from all ot her countries w ithin the scope of the scheme* It is suggested that a suitable oasis would be the payment of an inclusive lump sum payment per annum over?, f* period of fifteen years s this period bein^ the tuiiia*ur:« vhich will suffice to give the operating authorities a sufficient security of tenure to ?/nrr*tnt the exceptional financial outlay and ris^s r.vhich the scheme will entail c The schei.e offers such financial terms should enable the 1 ur;o suin payments to be Kept 7 'ithin limits vliich will ])ieclude • ny substantial increase in the normal postal rate« The full details are elunorated in the printed oiemorundun, enclosed herewith, although it is realised that this is not in a for., suitable for direct presentation to the Government of a country outside the British Empire c In addition to the Empire Governments served by the routes, the Governpients of the fhiclan, Egypt, Palestine ana Ira^ nre being invited to participate. It is, however, an inevitable corollary of the Scheme that the various participating Governments should, 9 .p indicated in the printed memorandum, accept responsibility for providing adequate night flying facilities and all other adjuncts for an efficient ground organisation, to ensure the successful application of the proposals, It will be obvious that the journey time schedules can only be achieved if night flying is fairly continuous unless machines tire to be used which provide an exceptionally high rate of speed and give longer periods upon the ground. His lajesty’s Government, however, us the result of an exhaustive review of the whole situation, are convinced that excessively high speeds can be purchase' at too doar a price, for instance, if the average cruising spew'd under the t’cheme were to be increased to BOG miles per hour (as is within the limits ol technical practicability) the total costs involved would be increasedby more than ,30^©. The difficulty ir th^tt machines operating at very high speeds have to be Jitted ^ith fuselages of relatively small cross-section, •-vith the inevitable result that the standard cf comfort is so low as to entail undue fatigue by long periods of flying. ith machines of large capacity (roughly four tens p-\Y load) operating at 150 m.p.h., it is possible, however, to use a fuselage so roovy ar to give a high standard of comfort, roughly equivalent to that of ” agcns-Lit M , and so provide full sleeping accommodation and such urrange- i: exits ur - will preclude any possibility ot. serious f atigue by practically continuous flight. The various Governments of the British impire are accepting responsibility for the ground organisation of the sections of the routes within their territories and the Government of the United Kingdom would therefore as.t that the suggestion to the Government of that they should avail themselves of trie fchene for the transport of their own first-clarr mail, should be coupled with the request that they will undertake the provision of the necessary ground organisation within their territories. It is realised that such arrangements are already accepted by them in principle and that facilities for day flying exist to ne'.t the needs of the various national companies subject to reasonable payment for such services in the form of landing and housing fees. It is, nevertheless, the case at present that the facilities available are not adequate for continuous night flying, and the Government of the United Kingdom attach exceptional importance to ensuring that the route between4, London «.ind Calcuttu shall be available for ni^lit flying v 7 ithin the next tv/elve nonths « Such an arrangeCient is not only desirable fron the present general s tana point of the development of world aviation, but is called for ar a necessary preliminary to the development of the main scheme for the Fmpire Air Routes ar from 1937. It appears essential to get this first phase of the Scheme in full development curing 1936, leaving the further de/ elopment o.i the routes to South Africa ana. beyond Calcutta to follow as quickly ar possible. In the circumstances, the Government of the Suited kingdom would as a the Government of to consider the possibility of providing the facilities set out in the gchedule attached hereto which apoear to them to be the minimum which would suffice to meet the situation.

L 1955 PRCVISION OP lilGHT FIYl^G PACILITIgS t (Brief explanatory note oreoaratory to Inter-Departmental Conference prooosed to be held at the Air Ministry on Friday, March 22, 1935 at 3 p«mo) The Emoire Air Mail Scheme depends for its successful development on the early orovision of full nipht flyinsr facilities over the main trunk routeso As a first instalment. It is desired to initiate immediate action for the equioment of the route between Cairo and Calcutta so that night flying can commence over that sector early in 1936* Such a situation will be an essential oreliminary to the full development of the ground organisation over the remainder of the routes in time for the progressive reduction of lourney schedules visualised under the schemeo At the same time, it aooears desirable that the Governments of Egyot, Palestine and Iraq should now be invited to oarticipate in the scheme by agreeing to air trcnsoort by the Empire Services of all their first class mail matter to and from the countries who are included in the scheme* In view of the short distances between this country and Egynt, °alestine and Iraq in comoarison with the average distances of the other oarties to the scheme, there clearly aooears to be no case for requesting a subsidy from these three Governments, beyond an attempt to secure a oayment equivalent to the housing and landing fees which will be oayable by Imoerial Airways for use of the ground organisation, couoled with exerrotion for the Company from oayment of taxes on fuel and oil* It may, however, prove to be impracticable to secure both reasonable lump sum oostal payments from these Governments and also subsidy contributions2 equivalent to the housing and landing fees; and this ooint will need to be keot in rind in deterrinin' the rniniruin oostal osvDiente which will be acceotable from the three countries * If this offer of oarticioation in the scheme could be made immediately, it would greatly facilitate a collateral request that urgent action should be taken towards the orovision of the night flying facilities required under the scheme* The matter is so urgent, that the Air Ministry feel it essential that a small party should proceed, if possible at the end of Aoril, to negotiate In these three countries with a view to securing agreement and initiating immediate actiono If this is not done, there will be inevitable delays and serious danger of failure to secure the co-operation of these Governments in a matter which is of the utmost imoortance for the future of the Empire scheme* It is suggested, therefore, that the Inter^Deoartmenta1 Conference should consider the desirability of arrangements being made to this end; and it Is hoped that the p oet Office will consider the possibility of nominating a representative to deal with the postal side of the negotiations., The remaining members of the party should comprise, it is suggested, an officer from the Air Ministry authorised to negotiate terms for the provision of the ground organisation and a settlement of the questions attendant on payment of housing and landing fees and exemption from duties on petrol and oil, together with a technical officer from the Civil Aviation Departmento As a preliminary to su&lt;hvisits, it is further suggested that H&lt;,M„Representstives in the three countries should be informed of the position in general terms and3 ^ requested to ascertain and reoort by telegraph whether such visits would be welcomeo A tentative draft of a memorandum outlininc; the position for transmission to HoWo Reoresentatives is attached hereto.? The draft v/ould require slight adjustments for the three cases* and a schedule aoorooriate to each country would be appended* giving details of the orovision which aopears to be desirable and the crobable costo These schedules will be available for consideration at the meeting on Warch 22, if desiredo In general it may be stated that the total caoital cost is estimated at £8*000 for Egypt* and £28,000 for Iraq* The case of Palestine Is comolicated somewhat by the fact that arrangements are understood to be already in contemolation for new airports at Tydda and Haifa, which will largely meet the situation* combined with certain intermediate beacons* which it is believed can be obtained without difficulty by arrangements with the Oil Companies.&gt; There remains* however, the problem of whether Gaza should be retained as a oort of call and* if so* whether additional equipment will not be necessary to the extent of £6,0CC» * In addition* there is the question of Transjordania* where equloment is required to the value of roughly £1C,00G&lt;. It should be observed, parenthetically, that these estimates of costs are necessarily somewhat hypothetical at this stageo Reliable estimates can only be formulated in the light of discussion of the requirements on the spoto The case of Transjordania will clearly call for acceptance by the Air Ministry of the major responsibility for the cost, having regard to the conditions obtaining in that country/* Similarly the Air Ministry will need to meet the cost of the facilities between Basra and Gwadar, yfnere India take over resoonsibility© It will however4 be necearary for early arrangements to be made for such rork to be put in hand and for some ooportunity to be afforded for the Air Ministry technical reoresentative to ^et in touch with the Political Resident on the Persian Gulf on the one hand* and the Transjordan authorities on the other* It is honed that some means of achieving this can be formulated at the proposed Inter-Departmental meeting* It also aopears desirable to indicate the basis which the Air Ministry have in mind for meeting the difficulties likely to be apprehended in dealing with the Sgyotian and Iraq Governments * Clearly, the capita 1 Orost will be a difficulty and it may be necessary to offer an advance lump sum payment, to cover an agreed proportion of the fifteen years r payments which would be due from Imperial Airways in respect of their user of the ground facilities during the period of the scheme« In this way, the principle would be preserved of requiring the local Government to acceot responsibility for provision of the ground organisation, whilst they would be able to recover corresponding payments from other national companies * It is hoped st the same time to secure seme adjustment on similar lines of the present position whereby the Meteorological organisation of the R*A.F« in Iraq does work for the Iraq Government (viz* for the Iraq Air Force and the civil aviation of that country) and also affords facilities to other national companies, apart from Imperial Airwaysc The total value of such services is estimated at £4,OCC o&lt;,a&lt;&gt;; and, prima facie, a case exists for arguing that the Iraq Government should assume responsibility for the service* If they desire to continue to avail themselves of our services, then they should moke the payment of £4,0C0 Ona* and recover from the various parties concerned^It will be appreciated that the issues involved are somewhat comolex and that this note cannot do more than n;ive a rteneral outline. It is hoped that the Inter- Departmental Conference may be &amp;h]e to formulate detailed recommendations to rerpilate the procedure and ensure early action.DR/FT I/iKI-OKAiMDIJw. (Proposed for trunsciisrion, with suitable oeiendation ir each case, to Representatives in K&amp;ypt, Palestine and Iraq). KT.TPIRK AIK M/1L dkvklkjp: iknt /NJ; IKTKHSIKIC.*fION OF KIQ’ihK /IK SKRVICFli AS FRO;; 19?7 0 v His Britannic Majesty's Oovernrient in the United lingdoir. have, as announced in the House oi Oouj-ons in Peceriber last, decided to introduce as froiu 1937, a new policy whereby all first-class mail matter, pasrinr between countries embraced within the British Commonwealth of Rations and served by the present Empire air routes, shall be sent by air. In pursuance of this policy, it is contemplated to intensify the organisation, to speed-up the journey schedules, and to increase the frequency and capacity of the services. The scheme, in fact, involves a step forward in the development of long-distance air services which will for the first time maKe it possible to secure all the advantages of air transport for first class mail, without any serious financial disadvantage e It will be obvious that such a scheme can offer exceptional opportur.ities to countries, located along the routes and not themselves operating air services 0 It is hoped, therefore that the Government of will favourably consider the possibility of entering into arrangements with the Government of the United kingdom for the transport under this scheme of all their first class mail to and from all other countries within the scope of the scheme. It is suggested that a suitable oasis would be the payment of an inclusive lump sun payment per annum over2 p period of fifteen years, this period being the Liiniamm vhich will suffice to give the operating authorities u sufficient security of tenure to warrant the exceptional financial outlay and risKS which the scheiTie will entail fi The scheMe offers such financial terms ar should enable the luno sum payments to be Xept within limits which will preclude any substantial increase in the normal postal rate. The full details arc elaborated in the printed memorandum, enclosed herewith, although it is realised that this is not in a form suitable for direct presentation to the Government of a country outside the British Empire. In addition to the Empire Governments served by the routes, the Governments of the Gudun, Egypt, Palestine ana Ira^ ore being invited to participate. It is, however, an inevitable corollary of the Scheme that the various participating Governments should, as indicated in the printed memorandum, accept responsibility for providing adequate night flying facilities and all other adjuncts for an efficient ground organisation, to ensure the successful application of the proposals. It will be obvious that the journey time schedules can only be achieved if night flying is fairly continuous unless machines are to be used which provide an exceptionally high rate of speed and give longer periods upon the ground. His lajesty's Government, however, as the result of an exhaustive review of the whole situation, are convinced that excessively high speeds can be purchased at too daar a price, for instance, if the average cruising speed under the Scheme were to be increased to 200 miles per hour (as is within the limits of technical practicability) the total costs involved would be increased3 by more than 5o7 0 . The difficulty If that machines operating at very high speeds have to be fitted vvith fuselages of relatively small cross-section, with the inevitable result that the standard cf comfort is so low as to entail undue fatigue by long periods of flying, fith machines of large capacity (roughly four tons pay load) operating at 150 m.p.h., it is possible, however, to use u fuselage so roony ar to give a high standard of comfort, roughly equivalent to that of ,, Uagoris-Lit M , and so provide full sleeping accommodation and such arrange ments ar will preclude any possibility of serious fatigue by practically continuous flight. The various Oovernments of the British Ktnpire are accepting responsibility for the ground organisation of the sections of the routes within their territories and. the Government of the T T nited Kingdom would therefore as&lt;c that the suggestion to the Government of that they should avail themselves of the fchene for the transport of their own first-clarr mail, should be coupled with the request that they will undertake the provision of the necessary ground organisation within their territories. It is realised that such arrangements are already accepted by them in principle and that facilities for day flying exist to me t the needs of the various national companies subject to reasonable payment for such services in the form of landing and housing fees. It is, nevertheless, the case at present that the facilities available are not adequate for continuous night flying, ana the Government of the United Kingdom attach exceptional importance to ensuring that the route betweenLondon and Calcutta shall be available for ni^ht flying within the next tv'elve ncnths c Such an arrangecient is not only desirable fron the present general standpoint of the development of world aviation, but is called for ar a necessary preliminary to the development of the main f scheme for the Fmpire Air Routes as from 1937 c It appears essential to get this first phase of the Scheme in full development during 1936, leaving the further development of the routes to South Africa ana. beyond Calcutta to follow as quickly as possible. In the circumstances, the Government of the United Kingdom would as a the Government of to consider the possibility of providing the facilities set out in the Schedule attached, hereto which appear to then to be the minimum which would suffice to meet the situation. They feel great diffidence in putting forward such a suggestion as to the facilities which should be provided, but do so in the hope that the Government of will appreciate their desire to assist consideration of the matter to the utmost. The Government of the United Kingdom would further suggest that the matters dealt with herein would be greatly facilitated if a small party of official experts from the Air ministry and the Post Office were to visit in the near future with a view to discussing the financial and technical aspects on the spot, as soon as the Government of have had an opportunity of considering the proposals tentatively outlined herein.Marginal Note, Thia paaaage would require suitable amend- ^ent: in the case of Palestine to allow for the provision already approved t Lydd. civ and Haifa,, To Kgypt and Iraq only« o 3'igypt only. It is possible that the Government of the United Kingdom might, if necessary, be able to facilitate the immediate provision of any necessary equipment by making an advance payment in respect of a portion of the landing and housing fees which would accrue from Imperial Airways over the period of fifteen years suggested above ar appropriate for the T&gt; ostal Agreement. It will be obvious, however, that the payment of landing and housing fees is a necessary item in preparing the schedule of operating costs of any such scheme and that, therefore, the postal payments proposed would include some element in respect of such costs. This point is mentioned as having some relevance to the final consideration of the whole project although it is realised that it would be necessary for such payments to be made by Imperial /irways in view of the need for preserving equality of treatment as between them and the operating companies of other countries. In the case of the Egyptian and Iras Governments, it appears to be u question whether useful reference might not be naoe to the value of the provision oi such ground facilities in connection with the Air Forces of those countries and their internal civil aviation. The above proposals do not cover meteorological questions. These will similarly require consideration, but the problems arising in Egypt cun only be dealt with in the light of the facilities which it may be possible to establish in the Eudan. It is desireu therefore to postpone consideration of this aspect for the time being.To Irnq only. The above proposals do not cover meteorological questions. At present such services are provided by the organisation in Iraq; but it appears necessary that any discussion of ground organisation should review the situation in connection with these meteorological services, having regard to the fact that use is mode of them oy the Irar; government for its own Air Force cxnd civil aviation, whilst other national companies in addition to Imperial Airways have hitherto been given the facilities, although they properly fall to be provided by the Iraq government. The matter could doubtless be best dealt with in the course of the general discussion. The Government of the United Kingdom are extremely anxious that there may be no delay in dealing with the problems briefly reviewed in this memorandum and they would appreciate an early intimation that the proposed visit of experts rill be acceptable at a date, if possiole, not later than the beginning of Fay next.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000217_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/1997</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000217</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/1997</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 5/43 ‘Night flying facilities in the Persian Gulf in connection with the Empire Air Mail Scheme’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1935/1936</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-12-20T01:11:09</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (77 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the last folio with 78; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains correspondence, meeting notes (at the Air Ministry on 9 November 1934 and 22 March 1935), and memoranda regarding proposals to introduce night flying across the Persian Gulf as part of the Empire Air Mail Scheme.
