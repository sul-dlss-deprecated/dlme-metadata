A /- A S ^'^- ~ A /&lt;* r ^ Si' /^; ^ ‘ ’ tA 4 i] k r^h nx « A^ r A Cl&lt;nM(^ hbAJlr^ The position as adumbrated in Mr.^Hearn 1 sJ attached letter of the 31st ultimo is that the Anglo- Persian Oil Oo. nov/ known as the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company propose to retain the legal title of their shares in the Kuwait Oil Company and to transfer to the D'Arcy Exploration Company Ltd. the beneficial ownership of such shares. ( This arrangement is all right so long as the L’Arcy Exploration Co. Ltd. is owned and controlled Possibly the D'Arcy Exploration Company Ltd. will be able to insist on the legal title of the shares by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Such a transfer would come within the terms of Mr. Hearn's letter of17th February 1934. If it is desired to continue the effect of that letter it would presumably be necessary to ensure that the D T Arcy Company continues to be controlled and owned by the Anglo-Iranian Company. They should, therefore, be asAed to state whether they agree that they will inform His Majesty's Government of any proposal to transfer any of their holding of shares in the D'Arcy Exploration Company Ltd. , or if in future the legal title to the shares of the Kuwait Oil Co. is transferred to the L'Arcy Exploration Co^in order that His Majesty's Government may have an opportunity of considering their attitude towards such a proposal. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company should also be asked to sen&lt;jl a copy of the letters or the agreement referred to in the last paragraph of Mr. Hearn's letter of the 31st ultimo. The D'Arcy Company should be asked to furnish fetter to the effect that if at any time it should contemplate alienating its beneficial interest in its holding of the Kuwait Oil Company or transferring its legal title in such holding, it will before taking any Steps therefor first inform His Majesty's Government of its desire so to do in order that His Majesty's Governmenjt may have an opportunity of considering their attitude towards such proposals. No doubt you will ascertain the viev/s of the Foreign Office on the proposed arrangement. Z2Z- 3 7- ° W'- 4 -Draft Paper. Department. G.W. Rendel, Esq., C.M.G., Foreign Office. 11 JAN 1937 My dear Rendel, I enclose copy of a letter from Fraser in which he enquires whether we have any objection to the 'beneficial ownership' of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's holding in the Kuwait Oil Company being transferred to the D'Arcy Exploration Company. A copy of the previous correspondence with Hearn which is referred to in Fraser's letter was forwarded to the Foreign Office with India Office printed letter of the 19th February, 1934, No.P.Z.1175/34.
