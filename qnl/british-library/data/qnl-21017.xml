Telegraphic Artdress: ' EASTERTIDE.' (INCORPORATED IN ENGLAND.) Private &amp; Confidential* Major C. K. Daly, Political Agent, BAHREIN, Dear Sir, Khedourie M&gt; Saye^i&gt; I am much obliged to you for your confidential and personal letter of 18th. inst, with enclosures. For some little time past I have had a feeling that things were not as they should be but in the absence of definite information I have been unable to do any- thingin the matter. With reference to the letters enclosed written on Bank note- paper, this clerk is not authorised to sign on behalf of the -Bank. All correspondence purporting to come from this office must bear the ^-v signature of the manager and any letters not doing so should be ignored. It has never been the practice that any Bank Documents could be signed by any other person than the manager and I have issued explicit instructions that in future Bank notepaper is not to be used.^ Snourd any further causes of this nature be brought to your notice I should be much obliged if you will inform me. I am informed that the transactions to which these documents relate are personal and I am afraid I have fto control over this clerks personal affairs outside the Bank provided the transactions are done with the mutual consent of both parties, I admit that transactions of this nature are not in the best interests of the /the Bank ^nd are to be depreciated. If, however, it oan be proved that this eort of business is going on protected by the name of the m- Bank it puts things on a different basis* Any person purchasing drafts or telegraphic transfers on India or elsewhere at this office is entitled to have the same at the current market rate without being charged brokerage # According to my bookSfdrafts etc. have always been issued at current market rate. If, as you state, this clerk has demanded brokerage on such transactions,it has been done without ny knowledge and is quite un authorised. Can you fumiah me with proof of this statement? This clerk is employed by the Bank as a broker and as such receives a fixed salary. He does not receive any brokerage from the Bank. Should any business be done direct with any of the local bazar brokers, then brokerage is paid to them after completion of the trans* action, on personal application, but not through the agency of this clerk* The suggestion that the Bank pays such brokerage through this clerk and is possibly embezzled is unfounded and I can furnish proof if required. The Bank does not recover its expenditure on brokerage by charging a higher rate for the draft. We reiterate our previous statement that drafts and telegraphic transfers are issued at current market rate free of brokerage or any other charges* This individual is not permitted to buy and sell drafts privately without the knowledge of the Bank. He is employed by this Bank to do business on their behalf only and is liable to dismissal should he give any cause for satisfaction. Can you give me any further particulars? I have been informed that his bxother has a shop in Bahrein, but being in his brothers name I am unable to do anything in the/Bage 3« ^ the matter. It is obvious that his brother having a shop in Bahrein cannot affect his terms of service with the Bank. I am inclined to treat * I . with reserve the rumour that he is about to import a motor car. I am aware thfet he recently asked permission to visit Najd for n a change of air* and that permission was refused. I thank you very much for all the information you have given me and it is my duty to protect the interests of the Bank and its customersas far as possible. I should be glad if you will inform the merchants who have approached you that nothing that emanates from this office is official unless it is with the managers signature or consent. Further, allapplicants for drafts etc. can see me simply by ask ing, in fact it is my wish that they should see me® I have issued instructions that no brokerage whatsoever is to be charged in future, and should any case be reported to you kindly advise me I return herewith the documents enclosed with your letter, I am.

Political Agent, B a h r e in. ^ear Sir, P. 11 . . ' ' * ^ Y/e are in receipt of your letter Ho. 464 of the 25th instant, and regret to note that one of our ercployees - llr. Khedouri Sayegh - has been rude to you. V/e have already spoken to him about his conduct to you in the strongest possible manner, and in view of your letter we have again warned him of his conduct. He has promised the Writer that he v/ill respect the Political Agent in the future both within and without the confines of the.Agency. We do not think he will give you any cause for com- plaint in this respect in the future. We are obliged to you for cancelling the order de barring him from the right of entry to the Agency, in view of the fact that as an employee of this -^ank, he sometimes has business with your Office. He has been informed, however, by the Writer that it is only because he is an employee of the Bank that the order has been rescinded, and that any infraction If kt- ItU^yC &lt;L of your order in the future will be severly dealt with. V 4 /\ * Yours fai^f^lly, a n a g e r.Confidential. c A—/U The Manager, The Eastern Bank Ltd, Bahrain. Bahrain, 18/8/21• 7 / (i) y'i Dear Sir , . Sereral of the principal merchants hare recently approache me with the requeet that I would address you on the subject of cert- aln dealings of one Khadourl Sayesh an emplye of your bank,with the request that you will be 6 ood enough to Inform me whether they are in order .for the satisfaction of the merchants w .o appear somewhat mistrustful. I enclose certain documents for your perusal &amp; return. You will notice that on the first letter the address of the Bank has been crossed out &amp; the others appear to be private letters 4 bear neither the Bank address nor the signature of the manager. Is this gentleman authorised to sign such documents on your behalf? If so,at the risk of Interfering with a matter which only very Indirectly concerns this office, may I be permitted to.strongly recommend that In future you discontinue the practice 4 allow no such documents to appear except over yyur signature. The dealings of this clerk do not appear to Inspire the public with any confidence.; Merchants hare also represented to me that whereas formerly An purchasing drafts on India etc they paid the value of the dr .ft ^ only, lately this clerk ,after Issue of the draft has approached them &amp; demanded &amp; for himself as Brokerage. Is this permlssable c with your knowledge. I am credlably Informed that the books of most of the merchants who hare dealings with the Bank will show these payments as made to him recsntly. I am unaware of the emoluments of this individual^ but I learn that he has opened two shops under cover of names of relatives &amp; I am told that this Is against the terms of his servloi with you. I am also credibly Informed that he Is about to Import a motor car &amp; otherwise lives at a very extravagant rate. He Is reported to have.recently bought a 'Howalehfrom Hhan BahMur Abdul Aziz Qosalbl &amp; to have resold it to Yusuf Lutafali without the knowledge of the Bank. Ib this Individual permitted to buy &amp; sell drafts privately. The view of the merchants Is that they are not very well up In Banking affairs &amp; fear that they stand a risk of being let down &amp; • * awould like to know exactly how they stand s as far as possible to do business wltth you &amp; under your signature. Merchants also state,but I do not quite understand this point, that they sometimes personally or through one of their servants apply for a draft but that this clerk represents to the Bank that * ' ' ..j, the application has b^en made through a 'Broker' who ha-s to be pai^ 1 &amp; they believe that the B nk pays such brokerage which however Is Ho not due to anybody &amp; Is possibly embezzled,They believe that In sAcn a case the bank recovers Its expenditure on Brokerage by charging more for the draft so that ultimately this charge falls on them . I forward all the above Information for your personal inform - atlon In the hope that It may be of interest &amp; at the request of certain merchants who have felo somewhat uneasy at the trend of events. I venture to suggest that your business would be likely to Improve If you could as far as possible eliminate any Gorbetweens In your dealings with the merchants. The clerk referred to recently asked for permission to visit Najd for M a chiange of air.'. There are no Jews there &amp; the few that traded thore were driven out some years ago, so that a trip there for a Jew An the mldale of the hot weather seemed dlfflcu to reconcile with a trip for the good of tne health &amp; permission has been withheld. yours faithfully Maj.
