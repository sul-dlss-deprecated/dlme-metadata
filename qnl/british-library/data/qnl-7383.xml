General description of Seistdn as a whole, including both Persian and Afghan Seistdn. Seistdn comprises an area of about 7,006 square miles, of which 2,847 ar e Area and boundaries of Seist^n. Persian and 4,159 square miles are Afghan. The details are given in Appendix I. Seistan of the present day may briefly be defined as the delta of the hi el man d and Khash rivers. The area which forms the delta of the latter river -is, however, only a very small portion of the whole. North of Seistan are the deltas of the Fardh Rdd and Harud Rud which form the Lash Juwain District ■ of Afghanistan.^ All these four rivers—Helmand, Khash, Farah, and Harud Rud pour their waters into Seistan, forming in time of high river a vast lake which fills the whole Himun area and constitutes for some hundred miles the boundary of Seistdn on the north and west. When full the Hamun* overflows * This does not occur every year, in 1903 the through the Sar-i-Shela into the wnde deep :Sheia flowed for one month i.e., August in ,1904 depression known as the Gaud-i-Zireh no water came down this channel. 1 vja.u'a 1 t-ncii. With the exception erf the tract at the mouth of the Khdsh Rdd round Chakhansur in Afghan Seistdn, Seistan is synonymous with the delta of the Helmand river and depends entirely upon that river for its cultivation and irriga tion. Like rivers in all deltaic regions the Helmand is liable to constant changes Ancient and Modern Deltas in SeistSn. COUrse, and thus WC find that the delta as a whole is made up of three distinct com ponent deltas, each of which has been at some time or other the delta receiving for the time being the water of the Helmand river. 5 The first comprises the southern portion of Seistdn now known as the Taraku or Traku, Ramrud, Hauzdar and Kundar tracts. In the days when the Helmand flowed towards Laraku, this was a very rich and populous region and was in all probability the Drangiana visited by Alexander the Great. It has been for many centuries deserted by the river and is now a desolate uninhabited country. Palaeolithic implements have been found widely dispersed over this delta. The second delta forms the eastern portion of Seistdn and is the country round bar-o-tar, stretching northwards to Amirdn. This too when the Helmand flowed in that direction was a rich and, as the numerous old ruins now testifv a very populous country. Like Taraku it is now an uninhabited waterless desert. The third delta is the region through which the Helmand now flows and comprises all the inhabited region of Persian and Afghdn Seistdn. It is watered by t Now often caiiediocaiiy the Rud-i-Afghln. ^f e i rnan d through its three distributary a.u m/j . *i*» , , branches—the Rud-i-Seistdn, Rud-i-Pari^n. and the Nad-i-Ahf channel ’ The past vagaries of the river, its present course and irrigation systems and all details connected therewith are fully dealt with in the concluding Chapters and in the Appendices of this report ; where some further information of a general character will be found ; the irrigation problems of Seistdn form a separate report. ^ Interspersed between the three deltas referred to above are higher plateaux of The high plateaux or Dasht. g ravel covered plains called “ dasht ” which probably have never been irrigated within recent geological times. No ruins of old human habitations are to be found on them.f Serstan derives its present name earlier Sac'?

Whether the Buddhist religion entered Seistdn we do not kno^but^of the It was conquered in A. H. 37 by the Arabs who held it for many centuries. To Seistan the Persian Safavi dynasty, owes its origin in the person of Yakub- bin Lais, a coppersmith of Seistan. From the tenth century onwards the: history of the country has been one of disaster and declining prosperity. A long succession of devastating conquests- by Mahmud of Ghazni, Jingiz Khan, Timur, Nadir Shah, and others; each intu n&lt; left it a more impoverished and stricken country. The local Kayani dynasty, who claim descent from Kaikubad, ruled the- country for several, centuries in the intervals between the mvasions of foreig hordes! but they, like their country, gradually declined in prosperity and p - tance. A genealogical tree of the Kayani dynasty from he times of Lais the Coppersmith, with a brief historical note by Khan Bahadur M.r Sham Shah,, will, be found in Appendix 4. Seistan, hitherto a part of Persia, was included in the Afghan dominion,of Ahmad Shdh Durrani; but Afghan rule was but nominally enforced, andj.he country, still further weakened by petty factions, fell an easy P re y t0 a 3 Persian force which, under Mir ’Alam Khan, Governor of Kain, included a large portion once more in Persia. The dispute, which ensued between Afghanistan and Persia on this proceed- p ’ ing, led to arbitration by the British Goy- General Goidsmid’s Mission in 1872. ernment and Sir Frederick Goldsmid in B872, as Arbitrator, laid down a,boundary line through Seistan to define the Jimits^ of Persian and Afghan territory. This settlement formally perpetuated w t course-of local events had already accomplished, the division of Seistan between Persia and Afghanistan, and Seistan, thenceforth, ceased to possess any individual existence as an undivided whole.Chap.

The name Seistan, which in this report is applied to the whole country comprising both Persian and Afghan Seistan, is no longer ever locally used in that general sense. To the Afghan Seistan means the inhabited portion of Persian Seistan only, and to Persian and Afghan alike Afghan Se.stan is known by the name of the two districts into which it is divided, i.e., Chakhansur and Kala-i-Fath. 1 1CtS lnt0 ' hlch To the Persian the name Seistan does not convey even so wide a meaning as that above stated. It is restricted to that portion of Seistan only which is irngated and cultivated by the Rud-i-Seistan. It is in common usage even stdl further restricted, i.e., to the capital of Seistan, Shahr-i-Nasiriva (called hv us Nasratabad) which is locally known only as Shahr-i-Seistan (city of Seistan’I and often talked of simply as Shahr or Seistan. Other portions of Persian Seistan are known by separate names, i.e., Miankangf (the tract between the Rud-i-Parian and the Nad-i-Ali channel), Ramrdd, Hauzday etc etc The names of the administrative and revenue divisions of the country will be Rmnd in Chapters VI and IX for Persian Seistan and Chapter XVII for AftrMn whirlf h' Seist f n l Persia ' -^Afghan has many char/ctenstms incoS which have not been affected by this division of the country between the two kingdoms These, t e., ethno ogy, the character of the counfry and people soil climate, etc. may be treated independently of national boundaries and are’ therefore, included in this and the following chapters. 1 Physical features of the Country. Seistan presents many aspects. The southern portion, except where, in the The gravel corered pi&amp;ins. Taraku, Ramrud and Hauzdar tracts, He j u* . j i .* tt i si §feat expanses of open land once watered and cultivated by the Helmund, but now a deserted waterless wilderness studded w,th old rums, consists of “ Dasht,” ie, wide gravel covered plains rising in terraces of varying heights and abounding in deep depressions, many of consider- able area, formed eitner by water or wdnd action, it is hard to say which This is a waterless d.smal tract destitute of all vegetation. In the west rise the distant mountains stretching in a long line from Saindak in the south to Bandan in the north, striking features of the landscape in fine weather but more often than not obscured by heat or dust haze and mirage. As one proceeds northwards the dasht ends abruptly by a line of cliffs (from The boundary cliff* of the Basin. * S® f e 6t high) which, commencing at ^ ^ . the Helmund opposite Kiihak, fringe the south of inhabited Persian Seistan, and trend south-west by Kalad-Nau and Sihkuha to near Hauzdar; from these cliffs one drops into the cultivated and inhabited area of Persian Seistan. A similar but higher line of cliffs 400 feet high at the edge of the Dasht-i- Margo fringe Afghan Seistan on the east and commencing near Chahar Bunak run northwards to Aleli in the valley of the Khash Rdd. Similar cliffs aaiin (170 to 180 feet high) mark the drop from the “ dasht ” on the north and west to the shore of the Hamun or the delta plains of Lash Juwain. Wherever seen [C639FD] R- V- f 4 [Chap. U these cliffs are picturesque and striking to the eye especially^ so in places where the Hamiin waters lap the gravel beach at their base. Within the wide territory encompassed by these cliffs, Seistan like all deltaic regions, presents to the eye an appearance of dead uninteresting flatness. The Kdh-i-KhwAja. Kuh-i-Khwaja, an isolated table topped: hill of black volcanic rock, 450 feet high, which stands up as an island in the. Hamiin near the eastern shore, is the one and only natural feature or any eig in the country. Mounds there are in plenty Mounds and ruins. scattered all over the face of the land, co vered for the most part by the crumbling old ruins with which the country so thickly abounds; others, especially in the interior portion of Persian Seistan, t.e., the area watered by the Rud-i-Seistan, are surmounted by villages which with their domed buildings present from a distance an air not only of picturesqueness but prosperity. On nearer approach, how- The Seistdm village. ever, these first impressions give place to disappointment and finally to disgust at the squalor, filth and smells of the build ings and their surroundings. The adjuncts of this^ type of Seistan village are always the same. Rows of men and boys sitting idling along the side of some tumbledown wall, ragged or naked children playing in the mud heaps of decaying refuse, the noise of grinding corn within the houses, starving mangy pariah dogs sleeping in the sun or quarrelling over the last dead donkey and last, but not least, a tank of smelling water covered with green scum complete the scene. As one goes east or north to Afghan Seistan or Persian Miankangi, the type of village changes from dome built structures to collections of wattle and daub huts, other adjuncts remaining the same. The Beluchi nomads and the cattle and flockowners (Part III) may be found all over the country either in encampments Huts and tent* of nomads, graders and Salydds. q{ bknket tents or J n the Hamlin area adapting themselves to the custom of the Saiyads (Chapter XLIII) catchers of fish and wild fowl, whose habitations consist of bundles of reeds tied together. In the interior and more populous tract of the Rud-i-Seistan the eye may search far and wide without seeing a tree Treeless aspect of the country. beyond the few dwarfed fruit trees to be found almost hidden within tumbledown garden walls. All other trees have been cut down and dug up long ago for firewood. Along the banks of the Helmund, however, and in Miankangi and in Afghan Seistan dense jungles of tamarisk trees abound. With the exception of a few Padah or Padag or Padak trees (known either as the Euphrates* poplar or Babylonian Willow) no other indigenous trees exist in Seistan. It is a curious fact that notwithstanding the extreme fertility of the Seistan soil, with but one exception, no wildflowersf are to be found in the country. The above exception being the wild convolvulus which grows in thick tangled clusters in summer in the tamarisk jungle. Everywhere, however, in the deltaic plains of Seistan there is a rich covering ■ , , . of low scrub such as camel thorn, lana, the Rich growth of low scrub grazing. i r • j i * j i • u • dwarf jand and various reeds, which give the country a green appearance and make it appear a refreshing oasis to all who enter it from the surrounding desert. These are described in Part III. As one approaches the Hamuns, the scenery varies according to the amount of water in the Hamun area. At times nothing but a vast expanse of open water is to be seen stretching apparently to the dim mountain ranges on the Western horizon; at other times the high reed beds (Naizar) have grown so high and thick that little or no open water is visible from the shores of the mainland. * The Indian Planting and Gardening of August 1904 stated that the Populus Euphratica in the Mussourie Botanical Gardens was planted at 10 A.M. of the day Dr. Falconer went to Kabul with General Pollock in 1842. -f It is true, however, we have found various wild fiowars on the Kuh-i-Khwaja, but this island of rock has nothing in common with Seistan as a whole. No wild flowers. The Hamun and Naizar. &gt;1 h ^6 [Chap. I chiselled features that characterize the Aryan type as illustrated by the ^ Kay am, but yet all authorities concur in thinking them to be one of, it not the oldest or, the real aboriginal inhabitants. As for the rest, the difficulty of distinguishing aboriginal inhabitants from , . lot-pr comers can be understood by a re - in “ d lerenceTo thelist of the various tribes found in Seistan which is furnished at the end of this Chapter. It contains no less than 137 names. The representatives of many of thes ® tr ^ es P r .° ud t contend that they are of the aboriginal stock. Some, like the Sarbandi and Shahraki, we know to be wrong in this ; others are obviously new comers, but as for the claims of many others, it is extremely difficult to even venture an opinion as to the correctness thereof. Many even confess ignorance of their origin and call themselves by the natnes of the places from whence they last migrated, vide Ramnidi, Dilarami, Farabi and others. Of the Scvthians, Saga or Sacae, who gave their names to Seistan, we can find no trace, except it be in the people The Scythians. who ca ]j themselves Saj (vide list at page • Very interesting note* regarding thi* tribe will I l). The Sajdi* of British Baluchistan be found in the Census of India (Baluchistan), part a 1 sn ]. nown as Zikri or Daiand, of which “ Chapters 3 and 8 - one subclan is still called Saga, are without doubt a Scythian tribe. Whether the Saj of Seistan are connected with the Saidi is a question still to be decided. To arrive at any conclusions regarding the antiquity in Seistan of the tribes now inhabiting it we must refer to the records of the past history of the country. I give below the following valuable note on the subject by Mr. (TP. Tate, who has made the history of this part of Mr. Tate’s note. ^ i;f e _i on g study. At the conclusion of his note will be found a list of the various tribes of which representatives are to be found in Seistan. These have been grouped as far as our present information allows of into classes in the order of their probable antiquity in Seistan. It is to be hoped that these notes may assist in the further study of the wide field for ie.ere.t ..d ...d, i. the Ethnology of this country which, together Ethnology ot Seistin. with its Archaeology, presents a wide held for careful research. The large number of skeletons which have been exposed in their graves by the wind in the tract between Sar-o-tar and Amiran, should prove a valuable sub ject of study to the anthropologist. It is in this tract that the ancient silver coins are found and which local tradition says was inhabited 1702 years ago. The note on the Ethnology of Seistan by Mr. G. P. Tate of the Survey of India. The oldest of all the races which are now represented in Seistan is the Iranian, which at one time formed the Iranian races — Kay 4 ni, Jatnali, Kakhah. ^ 0 f t h e population ; to this Stock are referrable the family of the Art wi Maliks of Seistan and a few others which have shared the vicissitudes of fortune to which that ancient race has been subject. Among the latter are two tribes, called Jamdli and Kamdli, who are spoken of as having been the followers of the Kayams, their tribesmen, or clients. Among others, still in Seistan, is the tribe of Kakhdh, of undoubted antiquity. Theirs was the city, the ruins of which exist upon the southern slope of Kuh-i-Khwaja. They are also said to have furnished the custodians of the Sacred Fire main tained in the Temples which are believed to have existed at Traku and Karku. In addition to this high office the Kakhahs are believed to have furnished the builder of the famous weir in the The band builder a Kakhah.

The pieces of wood being placed on the altar with a pair of silver tongs. Thi* method of placing the wood on the altar is also mentioned in the legend regarding the Pyroeum, said to have existed at Tr&amp;kun.7 Chap.

The Pahlawdn is also considered one of the tribes of Seistan, whose fore- Pahiawan and Saiy&amp;d. fathers dwelt in the country in pre- . . Islamitic periods. The Saiydds also are undoubtedly another of the ancient tribes of this country. The basis of the agricultural races of the nearest east is the old Iranian The Tajik, Dehkan and Arbab. stock wdiich, modified by subsequent ad- mixtures of alien blood, either Arabian, Scythian, or Mongolian, is now called by various names such as Tajik * Dehkan Dehwar, Sart and Arbab; of these a few Tajiks are to be found in the Chakhansur district, but it is not known whether these are new arrivals or not The only representatives of this class of people in Seistan are the last named’ i.e., Arbdb. This name is applied usually to families who have contrived to acquire hereditary authority and who represent allodial proprietors. In their hands has always rested the management of the land and agriculture. The mother-tongue of this race is Persian owing to which they are called Farsiwan or simply Farsi. In the valley of the Helmund, the oasis of Khash arid in Girishk, the Arbabs, who from time immemorial have occupied the arable lands and cultivated it, are said to be branches of one family. In Khash alone do they possess a part of their ancient authority. y The first irruption of alien races from Central Asia, of which there is any The effect of migrations from High Asia in b. c. particular information, were those tribes l6o ‘ . . who ’ hav i n g been dispossessed of their ancestral possessions in High Asia, or in the Farther East, were driven forth by the successes of these hereditary foes to find fresh lands on which to settle. ^ In B.

A period of 800 to 900 years separate these great events and in that time the Scythian element had been absorbed in the general mass of the population, just as the Arab element, once so strong, has in its turn disappeared in the 1,280 years that have elapsed since Seistan was conquered by them; moreover, oriental chroniclers take no thought of ethnological details except where they record the irruption of armed hordes which from time to time issuing from High Asia have come into collision with dynasties that sprang un as the authority of the Caliphs gradually declined. P * See the account of Tajiks in Mount Stuart Elphinstone's “ Kingdom of Cabal” ~ ~ [C639FD] ' r8 [Chap. I. At this distance of time it is impossible to do more than draw attention to some facts regarding some of the tribes The jat element. which had probably an origin distinct from the Iranian or Aryan stock : and whose ancestors in far distant ages pro bably did migrate from Central Asia. In a very small degree the Jat* element itself is present in Seistan. A very small portion only retains this distinctive appellation: but among the other tribes there are probably several, now distin guished by other names, which in reality are nothing more or less than offshoots of that race. There is also to be found in Seistan a tribe called the Dakmarda. On mu ^ a '*u tv, m ; a nf Persian soil they are styled Farsiwan and The Dakmarda connected with the Numna or • J i ,.1 Sind. are both agriculturists and cattle-owners (gaudar). In Afghan territory they follow almost entirely the occupation of graziers, and, being Sunnis, they are often called Baluch. The portion of this tribe settled in Persian territory conform to the State Religion. ^ 1 his tribe is probably of the same race as the Numriasof Sind, who are settled in the Kuhistan district of that Province and around Kotri, on the Indus. In the absence of notes dealing with this tribe, it is impossible here to enter into details ; but from the Numria traditions there seems to have been two tribes, called the Numarda and Dahmarda, respectively, both of which migrated many ages ago from a far country into Persia or Persian territory. After the lapse of a considerable period of time, the Numarda parted company with their fellow tribesmen, and continuing their advance eventually came to rest in Sind. The Bizanjos,^ a so- called Brahui tribe in the Jahlawan division Sangur and Sajiti. ^ ^ j^ a ] at State, is a branch of the Numrias. In Mekran also there is another tribe which migrated from Seistan, called Sajiti. It is divided into two branches, called Sangur and Sajiti: the former extending towards the coast of the Persian Gulf, the latter inhabiting the more inland districts : the head-quarters of this tribe is at a well known locality, called Greshak, at the foot of the Kalat plateau. The family of the Chieftain of the Sajitis is called Sakazi. This digression is relevant, inasmuch as it shews that a subsequent migra tion took place from Seistan, and that the course pursued was practically a continuation of the direction which the Sakas followed after they evacuated Ki- pin, w r hich brought them into the valley of the Helmund. The growth of the Parthian Empire which had increased its prestige very The Amir&amp;n tradition traced to a Parthian greatly at an early period of its develop- ori g in * ment, by the destruction of a Roman army under the command of the Consul C. L. Crassus at Carrhoe in B. C. 53, may have been the determining cause for the further migrations of tribes that had come to a halt in Seistan and the valley of the Helmund. There seems to be little room for doubting the existence of a Parthian or Indo-Parthian principality in Seistan which had its seat of Government probably at Sar-o-tar. The legend of Khwaja Amran, or Amiran, preserves some interesting allusions to this and to the representatives at the present day in Seistan of the Parthian or Indo- Parthian race. This Saint (who may possibly be identical with him of the same name, whose shrine is built on one of the mounds that mark the site of Babylon) met his death at the hands of an unbelieving race, called Ashg-ka- Putr ; and who seemed to have inhabited the district between the ruined fort of Chihilburj and the great fortress (now r in ruins) of Sar-o-tar or Tak ; and also to have been spread generally over the other districts around the Rubat which the Saint had built on the frontiers of the infidels with w'hom he waged an unceasing warfare. The prince of this unbelieving race was a child and his uncle acted as his regent, and abode in Chihilburj. The infidels, being thus within easy reach of the Saint’s position, surprised him one day while engaged in prayer and put him to death. His remains were buried in the Rubat and the * The Jats are to be found among the population of the village of Deh Nawab ; the kadkhuda is Dad, a Jat. There are Jats in Kaud and Warmal which form almost the whole of the race in Seist&amp;n. There are 30 families in Afghan Seistan. The above are classed under the full name Jat, but a great proportion of such tribes as are gaudar (herd Owners) are probably of the same race though known by their sub-tribal names. “ The Jat” is not considered to be much “ class” Kul and a few others as Gurgari being very probably sub-tribes of the Jat.Chap.

Sanjaranis have been mentioned in history as long ago as i ,ooo yearsf in the ninth century of our era. They seem to have had a strong bias towards lawlessness and bad livelihood generally. The Arabs having been the last immigrants of importance impressed their characteristics on the races whom they The Arabs. found in the country and among whom thev settled down. Frorp the Khawarij the Seistanis obtained the fierce, though somewhat impulsive, valour for which they were notorious down to the time o Timur and which in truth led to the severe measures taken by that conqueror to break the spirit of this people.

Seistan is composed entirely of water deposited soil, which like that of the Composition and depth of the silt. deltas of all rivers of great length is a very ... finely divided silt. The depth of the alluvial silt is unknown but must be very great, exposed sections, such as those in the cliffs fringing the Hamun, show 170 to 380 feet of alluvial. If to these are added the heights of the alluvial cliffs fringing the Seistan plains we get a total thickness of some 800 feet of alluvial silt above the bed level of the Hamlin alone. The Seistan soil is very homogeneous, and is a light cool loam, a mixture of Its fertility and freedom from salt. sand, and alumina, that makes it a most . , . . fertile soil, capable of raising excellent crops. Seistan sou may indeed claim to be of very exceptional fertility. Taken as a whole, the soil of the Seistan delta seems remarkably free from salts. There are salt impregnated tracts, it is true, which will be fully described later, but they give much less trouble here, than they have done in India where irrigation used to be carried out in a lavish and unskilled manner. There does not appear to be anything like the same area of salt land here, as one reads about in E^ypt or Mesopotamia. One reason assigned by us to this phenomenon, after very careful investiga- Reasons for the sweetness of the soil. tlOU of this Country, IS the fact that the Slit of . the Helmand, of which the soil is composed, is 01 extraordinary sweetness, as well as fineness ; and that below the superficial surface of loose silt comes at a moderate depth of 8 to 10 feet a bed of hard* * This bed is locally known as “ Sirr.” Sllt &gt; which by very moderate pressure has . , . become very tightly packed, and in course of time entirely staunch and impervious to water. The good natural slope of the surface, not only keeps the subsoil moisture low enough to prevent moisture coming to the surface by capillary attraction, but enables the upper stratum of soil, where necessary, to be thoroughly washed free of salts from above: the salts are, as will be explained later on, only to be found in areas where irrigation has been injudiciously lavish and natural drainage blocked. ^ One of the most curious natural phenomenon of Seistan is the fact that the Reasons for the sweetness of the water in the HattlUns do not Seem tO follow the laws Northern Hamuns. ^ which elsewhere convert similar basins of stagnant water, without natural outlets, into sheets of brine with salt incrustated margins, as is the case of the neighbouring Gaud*i'Zireh. This is due, in part, to the fact above stated that the waters of the Helmand are peculiarly sweet; this is thoroughly recognised by the people; but the real reason is that the pools (chung) are flushed each year by the flood water into the Northern Hamuns, and these are again flushed every few years, into the Gaudd-Zireh, from which the waters can only escape by evaporation. The water of the Hamuns is seldom undrinkable, and the bed whenever dry is of quite sweet soil. For details on this subject see Appendix 22 on the Naizar, its pools and channels. Classes of soil recognised locally. The local cultivators recognise various kinds of soil, and distinguish them by their nature, their situation, or the particular variety of weeds, which grow on them. The general expression for good cultivable lands is milk or kal. The Soils recognised by their nature. ver^ best lands are called sina-i m milk. . Lands, which are the result of recent ab luvial deposit, and by some change in the course of the river come for the first time \Warthuft corresponds with our word silt. under cultivation, are called Warshuftif and as these are generally covered with thick tamarisk jungle, they are also called gazi. Lands not cultivated for ai8 [Chap. II. long time are called kal-i-kharaba, which corresponds to the Punjab word “ Banjar Lands covered with salt efflorescence are called shor (shur). Sandy soil is called regi (rigi). The lands classified by the weeds they produce are, in order of merit, as follows: chaghaki from the chaghak, Soils classed by the weed 3 that they grow. a dwarf j an(J * bus h w hich, everywhere, is taken as a sign of the best land. This grows plentifully, and chokes the wheat and barley crops. Surijki ixom surij, a spinach ^ which grows on cultivated lands near the Hamun, and is eaten raw, and, is said, in the famine during the early spring season of 1903, to have supported many people. It is supposed to prefer hard soils of reddish colour of average fertility. Khdri from “ khar”, the camel thorn, the “ jowasa” of the Punjab. It grows luxuriantly nearly everywhere in Seistan, and to the greatest height, on regz lands where it is a sign of poor land, but, elsewhere, where it grows less high, it is a sign of lands of good average fertility. It springs up with the wheat and barley, and must greatly reduce their yield. Lulingi from luling, which is the “ jao ’’ of the Punjab, a species of tamarisk,which grows in places along the river; it is a sign of poor lands. In some parts of the country, tracts are covered with drift sand, and sand hills overlying the alluvial soil. Such tracts are Sandy or sand covered lands. ^ the cu j t i va ted area, but a tract of about 30 square miles occurs round the villages of Jazinak, Pulgi and Kala- i-Kuhna, extending westwards to Gauri, Khamak, Wasilan, Kala-i-Nau, Bahramabad, Dashtak and Luff. There are also smaller tracts^ near Zahidan. The first named tract is the best wheat growing land in Seistan. No barley, but wheat of a special variety is grown. The lands are extremely fertile and require only one watering to produce a heavy crop ; such cool lands are called 0 £ n \ Part of the fertility of this tract is due to the constant renovation ot the soil by the sand blown over it. Such sand deposits are called bad awura. Part is due to the long period of enforced fallowing caused by the larger sand hills, barchan, or dunes, which travel slowly with the wind across the surface of the tract As a barchan, moves forward, the land set free thereby is cultivated, and is virgin soil. Part of the fertility is due to the tilth obtained by the admix ture of fertile sands with the excellent underlying loams. These tracts are said to yield better if first cultivated with melons, and then wheat. The sand is, of course, the larger particles of the silt, scoured by the high wind off the land of the delta to the windward ; the finer material being carried away by the wind. The lands to the windward of sand hills are called kun-i-reg, and are highly valued. They have their drawbacks, however, and the cultivators have occasionally to abandon their villages to escape the discomfort brought by the invading sand, and rebuild their homesteads elsewhere. Kala-i*Nau, a large village, has been completely buried since this Mission arrived in Seistan, and^has been rebuilt elsewhere. The same remarks apply more, or less, to Pulgi, Jazinak and Khamak. Low lying lands along a river, or its distributaries, which are under water in flood time, and which receive a rich Aumdi and M^shi lands. deposit of silt, are called aumal, (water enriched, a local corruption of dbmdl). They cannot be sown to_ spring crops, as the crops would be covered by floods, before they could ripen, but the higher lands, from which the floods recede first, are sown with melons and millet, while those which dry later are sown with mdk or mdsh ; such lands are hence called mdshi. Lands which have been under water for 20 to 30 days will mature crops, it is said, without any further watering, and are also called okri. Lands on the slopes of the Hamun, or rather the inundated area between the cultivated lands, and the Naizar shore, Lands along the inundate area. are called llirg-i-ddman-i-Hdmun (the high skirt of the Hamun). They cannot grow spring crops, as the floods may cover them before harvest time, but they are sometimes cultivated with small patches of melons and millet. They are, however, famed for the rich grazing of bunnun grass; and are therefrom also known as the Bunnunistdn. * The jand tree, curiously enough is in the Punjab taken as a sign of the very best land ; only one jand tree has been Seen in Seistai .Chap. II.] 19 Both in the above and in the aumdl land, where deep cracks form in the silt, as it dries in the sun, the seed is sown in the cracks, and no ploughing is done. The seed is scattered broadcast, and whatever fails to fall into the cracks is swept in with a broom of tamarisk twigs, called by Seistanis jaura y % and by Baluchis shanpok. This easy form of cultivation is called kisht karkati, or tarkishti. Kal-i-Shela is land in the bed of some old distributary channel, which the river has deserted. This is excellent soil, and is cultivated, if there is no fear of the water finding its ways into the Shela again. Milk-i-Hdmun, Milk-i-Naizar, Milk-i-Chung, are lands recovered from either a Hamun, Naizar, or Chung, owing Lands near nvers and lakes. j-q some change in the direction of the river. These lands are said not to produce so well the first year, or two. They are difficult to plough, as the soil is hard, and in the case of the Naizar, encumbered with clumps of reed roots. Stiff lands round the shores of a Hamun, Naizar, or Chung, deeply pitted with cattle tracks, are called kachruky and are considered useless. Hdmun is a large tract nearly always covered with open water, and often of considerable depth. Naizdr is a tract generally under water, but of moderate depth, which allows of dense growth of reed beds, and which occasionally dries. A Chung is a depression in a Naizar area, where water stays longer, and is deeper, and which is open water, not covered with reed beds. Salt lands. As in all deltas the rivers and their distributary channels flow along ridges, with hollows in between, as exemplified by Excellent natural drainage. the ribs of a fan, or the fingers of an out spread hand. These hollows have themselves been, at some time, the course of distributary channels, and will in time become so again. All deltaic tracts are built up in this way, and have all the longitudinal slope, required to carry the silt laden water to the Hamun, and give all channels an excellent flow, neither too swift, nor too slow. The channels have a good command of the hollows between them, and these hollows too form excellent drains for carrying off flood w r ater. Some of these hollows, however, get blocked by ill-considered branch canals, and water collects, and stands where it should not. The free drainage to the Hamun is thus intercepted, with evil results to the soil in the vicinity, which becomes partially waterlogged, and the moisture escaping by capillary action from below carries up to, and leaves on the surface its soluble alkalis. The salt covered lands near the Hamun, on the ridges formed by old canal systems, are very noticeable. The height Salt lands on ridges of ancient canals&gt; of r;dgeg ^ o{ ^ , ong perio( j during which some vigorous cultivating community, constrained the canal to follow that alignment. There are many such large and prominent salt covered ridges in, or near, the Naizar near Takht-i-Shah in the Helmund delta, and between Peshawaran and Tappa-i-Kharan in the Farah Rud delta. They absorb the moisture of the lower surrounding lands, which drain into the Hamun, and remain sweet, leaving these ridges covered with salt. Other salt lands are to be found where careless irrigation has flooded lands, wdnch have not been subsequently cultivated. Most of the salt tracts in Seistan are due to the disasters which have befallen the country in the past, such as, when some devastating conquest has thrown the land out of cultivation, and let the canal system spill recklessly over the country. The present salt condition of the lands round the Capital of Seistan, which were once very fertile, is due to the gross Sait lands near the city. carelessness in recent years, which has allowed a canal to needlessly flood that tract, at each season of high river. * * Baluchis use the word “ Jaura” for a broom of “ Kirta grass.” C639FD Fr * 20 [Chap.

The salts are the soluble salts. ig so much good land availabIe that it is seldom necessary for the Seistani to trouble himself about tackling salt lands. They are found usually on the higher ridges above mentioned, and even if they occur in village lands, there are plenty of other good lands left to cultivate. The people do, however, know how to reclaim such lands, and generally do so by the simple method of flooding water Methods of reclamation in use in the country. affected fieldSj and a ll owing * t 0 drain off into lower lands, thus washing the salts out. When this is not possible, they dig up, and remove the surface soil, which contains the concentrated salts, and cultivate the sweet soil below. This is, however, but seldom done, except in gardens, or lands in the immediate vicinity of villages. Should cultivation expand in Seistan to such an extent as to make it necessary to reclaim salt land, to any large extent, this would present but little difficulty. Opening out the blocked drainage would suffice in some places, and in others washing the soil. In others, sulphate of lime (gypsum), which is very plentiful in this country, would reduce the salts, as has been done in America.

The bdd-i-sad-o-bist ruz alone blows with hurricane violence for over four months of the year, and there are many other seasons of high wind in the year. The effects of it are abundantly visible all over the country, especially where cultivated lands have been abandoned, and left deserted for long periods. In some of the more ancient of them, the whole surface of the land has been blown away, revealing the canal systems of still earlier ages. In places the original surface of cultivated soil has evidently been scoured away to a depth of 15 to 20 feet. No such heroic measures would be necessary in the case of the present salt lands; all that is necessary is to plough such lands a few times during the windy season, and allow the wind to remove the salt impregnated surface. * JCHAPTER III. Climate. The climate of Seistan is one of great variety and sudden changes, which season' 6 ^ and Eudden cl&gt;an g e characterise the take place with curious regularity year after year. There are practically only two seasons in the year, for spring and autumn can hardly be said to exist. The transition from winter to summer, and from summer to winter, is very rapid; sometimes only a matter of a few hours. Sum mer sets in at any date between the end of March, and the end of April, and vinter egins with equal suddenness at any time between the beginninp and the May, and the first half of June, are very hot trying months.

It moderates a little in the early morning and evening. After four or five days it drops a little for a . ° a y or two &gt; only to recommence with renewed violence. It blows with appalling violence, reaching the maximum velocity, as recorded by the Mission anemome- ers o 72 miles per hour.

Whatever discomforts it may cause q 1 • , f orm of dust laden air, noise, and so on, it is nevertheless the saving of -.eistan. It not only blows away the insects, and mitigates the heat, but clears the country of typhus, small-pox, and other diseases, so rife in the country in May and June.

The barometer in Seistan gives little or n o indication of coming wand, nor does the wind, notwithstanding its duration and violence, seem materially to affect the barometer.

Health. The following note on this subject by Major T. W. Irvine, will be found of interest. ^ Tne very extensive work done by that officer among the people of the country during the long stay of this Mission in Seistan has enabled him to acquire very ample experience and information which render his opinion on this subject of great value :—• Seistan has often been spoken of in the past as an unhealthy country. Seistan not an unhealthy country. With thJs ppinion I do not agree, The . records of sickness, and mortality in the Mission camp, and of the cases treated among the people of the country alone, suffice to give the country a much better character. “ First, and most important, is the fact that malaria is almost non-existent. Malaria. 13 especially the case in the south, and west, of Seistan. A line drawn from ]Nad*i-Ali westwards through Nasratabad would roughly define the limits of this disease. To the south of that line it can hardly be said to occur at all, while little is to be found to the north of it. In Persian Seistan it is practically con fined to the Miankangi and in Afghan Seistan to the country round Chakhansiir and Kala-i-Kang. At Kuhak camp, well to the south of this imaginary line, and on gravel soil, there were in 30 months only 551 cases, all told, ascribed to this Cleansing effect of the wind. cause. At the end of May, before the 120 days’ wind began, mosquitoes were in myriads at huhak, and were very troublesome. Among them I detected no anopheles, nor did 1 hear of any being found. To what cause can this immunity be attributed ? Primarily to the wind, which blows for 120 days without ceasing day, or night, at a velocity varying from 7 to 70 miles an hour. It blows away mosquitoes, and all low forms of animal life ; it dries up spills from canals, and overflows from rivers, and it cannot be kept out of any hut built by Seistan labour. Ventilation is therefore assured. The recognised wind of 120 days by no means represents the total of windy days in the year, as on at least another 120 days a respectable breeze blows, and often a gale; a very common routine being a day, or two s calm, three days’ wind, and so on. The months of November and December are perhaps the calmest. 1 he second factor working towards the desirable end of health is the The excellent water of the Heimand. water-supply of the Helmand. I speak of it as we have seen it, copious, first class . ^y, anc ^ constantly flowing. There is no population on any of its three divisions sufficient to polute such a large body of water. In addition to affording excellent drinking water, it comes down in flood in March and April, and scours its branches and canals, and carries off the debris and filth down to the Hamun. Shortly after the flood subsides the constant wind springs up. The diseases endemic in Persian and Afghan Seistan are typhus, and its Endemic diseases-Typhus. variants, small-pox, and probably enteric. . . The former breaks out every few r years into epidemics. Such years wall be found to be those following years when the Helmand has been unusually low, or failed, and consequently caused scarcity, famine, etc. No effort is made by the Seistani to segregate. I visited many villages, and saw convalescents from fever which, from the description given, was certainly typhus, sitting unconcernedly among their friends. Nor is there any attempt at sani tation, but some instinct teaches them not to use the canal banks as latrines. The nomad Baluch are very particular in always pitching their blanket tents some distance away from their water-supply, whence their women bring it in goat or kid skins. I have been told that the Afghans made an attempt to segre gate typhus.^ This I very much doubt. On one occasion, at Kala-i-Kang, I saw the survivors of an epidemic of c&lt; fever”. Here there w 7 as no attempt made at segregation, and here also there could be little doubt that the fever had Endemic relapsing fever. been typhus. Concomitantly wuth typhus, endemic relapsing fever is also met with, [C63QFD]28 t 28 [Chap. IV. If the Spirillum (Spirochsete Obermeieri), to which this fever has long been attri buted, is a phase in the life history of a Trypanosome (W* the researches of Schaudinn), it is worthy of note that in Seistan one fully developed Trypanasome flourishes, viz., Evans’, the Surra parasite. Small-pox is always present. A few children are inoculated on the usual place above the wrist. iSo enort is Smaii-pox and enteric. made to prevent the spread of the disease. I think it probable that enteric exists, principally among children, as it does in British Baluchistan. When referring to the troops, I have given it as my opinion that the enteric, which two sepoys contracted, originated in camp rom in ux of a large number of people with sick and weakly children to ospi a .

Quarantine from the north could be quickly and easily es tablished, if necessary. While marching and camping through the country during the two winters spent there, the immunity with which it Healthiness of the soil. was possible to camp a large body of men on ground close to, and often hardly raised above, the level of standing water was most striking. In some cases the camping-ground itself had been under water during the previous summer. No harm whatever resulted. The explanation is that instead of finding subsoil water 2 or 3 feet below the surface it was as much as 8 to 12 feet down. This is again due to the wind. Evaporation is so great that there is no soakage. The character of the soil also aids. 1 nese remarks do not apply to Nasratabad and its immediate surroundings. The benefits resulting from the wind are marked and valuable, but it is not without its disadvantages and dis- Discomforts of the wind. comforts. There is hardly an officer, and very few men, whose eyes have not ached, and smarted from the constant gravel and dust in the air. Many have had conjunctivitis, and are commencing to have granular lids. Another great discomfort is caused by the constant movement of tent purdahs and chicks, whereby the light is constantly changing and flicker ing with great resulting strain to those reading or writing. It still remains to be seen how far this has been actually prejudicial ; the discomfort is known. The roar and rattle of the wind, continuous for four months, and many extra days as well, and the dancing light, and the knowledge of the dust outside, constitute a persistent annoyance, which, as time goes on, becomes a serious mental strain. This shows itself either in depression or irritability. All, too, found the glare from the “ shora” and dasht ” (saline efflorescence and gravel plain), very trying; from the The glare from the bare plains. \atter especially it being, I think, intensified from the many facets available for refraction.

The leading men of Persian Seistan are but few in number, and these too are not now of any very great importance, or influence,—a fact which is due to the general policy of the Persian Government in reducing the status and importance of the leading men of each province. Priestly classes. The priestly and religious classes in Seistan, as evervwhere in Persia exercise considerable influence. The decisions of the leading men of that class' are in religious matters considered final, and they are therefore men of some authority. [C639FD]32 [Chap.

(2) Hail Mulla Muhammad Mehdi, commonly known as Mulla Mehdi, a Mujtahid of the Kakhah tribe of Seistams. He resides at Hu- sainabad. (3) Haji Mulla ’Ali .’Akbar, better known by his? title of Imam-i-Juma, a Mujtahid residing at Bunjar* These receive large annual grain allowances, both from the Persian Govern ment and the Governor of Seistan. 1 hey Their grain allowances. k&amp;ve, from time to time, been given revenue free grants of land, which by a very liberal interpretation of the limits thereof they have succeeded in extending to a large area of land. Their religions influence has thus been ausmented by considerable wealth. An attempt is now being made by the revenue authorities to curtail the extent of their revenue free lands to the areas- originally granted. This may, or may not, end in success. The tribal leaders. Of the tribal leaders in Persian Seistan, only the following are men of any influence or importance :— (1) Sardar Purdil Khan, chief of the Sarbandis, who resides at Daulatab&amp;d. (2) Sardar ’Ali Khan, chief of the Shahrakis, residing at Dashtak. (3) Sardar Sa’ld Khan, chief of the Nahriiis, formerly living at Khwaja Ahmad, who died just before the Mission left. He was on his way back from Tehran. (4) Sardar Khan jan Khan, chief of the Sanjaranis, residing at Siadak. Complete genealogical tables, prepared by Khan Bhadadur Mfr Sham Shah of the families of the above four chiefs, will be found at the end 01 this chapter. The above men and their forefathers^ played an important part in the local disturbances and vicissitudes of Seistan in breaking the power of the old Kayani rulers. Sardar Purdil Khan and the late Sardar Sa’id Khan were at bitter enmity, and the country generally is divided into fac- Enmity between Sarbandis and Nahrdis. tionS, Supporting the cause of One or Other of these two men. The Governor of Seistan (Hashmat-ul-Mulk) has taken the part of Sardar Purdil Khan very strongly, while his eldest son, Sartip Mir Ma’sum^ Khan, in consequence of a marriage connection, w r as a strong partizan of Sardar Sa id Khan. The latter has solar got the worst of it, as owing to the hostility of the Government, his villages of ’Aliabad, Kala-i-Nau, Kala-nKuhna, Kimak, Shanf- abad, and others have been given to Sardar Purdil Khan, Haji Agha^ Sai^ad ’Ali, and others, whilst he himself was obliged to take refuge in Khorasan. He had lately been allowed to return, and, with the assistance of the Yamin-i-Nizam, hoped to regain his lost possessions at Tehran, where he went to plead his case ; as already said he died on the return journey. I understand orders have come from Tehran to restore his lands to his family. Neither this Mission, nor the British Consulate in Seistan, have ever mixed themselves up with either side in this feud ; but the Russian Consulate have always espoused the cause of Sardar Purdil Khan. Sardar Khan Jan Khan, who became involved in this feud by a marriage alliance with Sardar Sa’id Khan’s family, ' Sarddr Khan jdn Khan. reGen tly had tO migrate tO Kain, but he has since been allowed to return, and lives in reduced circumstances in the Miankangf, w'here he owns cultivating rights in a few villages and has also a Government service of 15 sowars. &gt; ¥ A33 Chap.

Influential ‘village headmen. The following are the most influential Kadkhudas (village headmen) in Persian Seistan:— (1) Kadkhuda Fakir Muhammad, a Khimar Persian, of Daudi village near the Kuh-i-Khwaja. (2) Kadkhuda Taj Muhammad, a Kul Persian, of Deh Kul. (3) Kadkhudd Dost Muhammad, Saruni Baluch, of Deh Dost Muham mad in the Miankangl The Kalantar, and the above kadkhuda, are in receipt of grain and levy service allowances, as described in the next Chapter.

With but few exceptions, even among the leading men referred to above, , the whole population of Persian Seistan The reasons that the people are miserably poor. ^ miserably poor . This WOuld appear all the more strange, when one considers the extraordinary richness and fertility of the soil on which they live. It will be seen from a study of the revenue system of the country, which will be, hereafter, fully described, that no other result is possible. So great and exacting are the demands made on the unfortu nate cultivators, in the matter of land revenue, and from the many miscellaneous deductions, from their share of the harvest grain, _ that the balance left to be divided among the cultivators themselves is very little. The better the harvest, the more is taken from them, and good harvest or bad the &gt; cultivators are left with barely enough to support themselves and their families throughout the year. There is, therefore, but little inducement to extend cultivation, and many, who would otherwise devote themselves to agriculture, take to the more re munerative occupation of cattle owning, or live a life of idleness and poverty.

These are stored for winter use, and for more than half the year, form almost the sole food of the people. This source of food supply is of itself an^ inducement to idleness, and the greatest portion of the population of Seistan are content to subsist on water melons, as long as the supply lasts, and either to beg, borrow, or steal, sufficient to keep them alive for the rest of the year, or as a last resource to undertake such labour, as will enable them to live till the next melon season,34 r [Chap.

It is true that the revenue system enables the bigger men, from kcidkhuda upwards, to take a fairly large share of the Effect Of restricted export. h £ rvest produce, and in the case of^ some men, the amount of grain they receive each year from various sources is very large. One would naturally expect this class to be a wealthy and prosperous one. Such, however, in Seistan is not the case from the fact that the export of grain and ghi out of Persia is prohibited. There is no adequate market, therefore, for the enormous stock of surplus produce which the country affords. In years of famine, only, is the surplus absorbed by the neighbouring districts in Persia. Grain, or ghi, which elsewhere would be a source of much wealth, is here of little value, and for want of an open market, is left buried in the ground until it rots. The upper classes have little inducement, therefore, to encourage the ex tension of cultivation. Notwithstanding its natural fertility, the material prosperity of Seistan, and its people leaves much to be desired. Character of the people. The absence of material prosperity in Persian Seistan has naturally had The effect of the Persian system of revenue ad- an injurious effect upon the character of ministration. the people. The Seistanis do not at first impress a new comer very favourably. Their disinclination to speak the truth, and propensity for pilfering and theft, are the traits, which first come to notice. The Persian system of administration and revenue have deprived the people of all inducement to labour, or do anything more than is necessary to keep body and soul together. Long centuries of oppression have deprived them of in dependence of character, and like all people under similar circumstances they have had to fall back on the weapons of defence and protection common to all oppressed people, i. e. t cunning and assumed ignorance. Organised system of thieving. Seistan is invested with thieves and robbers. Many of the leading men from the Governor downwards are not above extending their patronage and pro tection to particular gangs of thieves, in whose small profits they demand the lion’s share. Most of the thieves on either side of the border have accomplices on the other side, and property stolen in Persian territory finds its way to Afghan territory, and vice versa. The dense tamarisk jungle along both sides of a large portion of the Perso-Afghan border in Seistan affords safe shelter to thieves, and robberies are specially rife during the season of the year, when the inter vening river is fordable. Much of the thieving in the country is due to the poverty of the population. The poor Seistani carries his faults on the surface. A longer experience of c. .. them brings to light many good character- istics. After our two years intimate deal ings with this people, we hold a very different opinion of them, than that formed on our first arrival in the country. With but very little encouragement, and with the prospect of, but moderate, but assured payment, the Seistani proves himself a most satisfactory labourer. He is always cheerful and willing to work. The average Seistani of Persian descent is a man of very sharp intellect. He picks up a new idea with remarkable ease and rapidity, and is a very easy man to teach. However depressing circumstances may be, a Seistani seldom fails to see the humurous side of things, and has a keen sense of the ludicrous. They are very easy to control and manage, and those employed by this Mission, numbering several hundreds, have given complete satisfaction in every way. No description of a Seistani, would be complete without reference to his The Seistanis skill with the tesha, extraordinary skill in the use of his chief * Known m India as the implement of labour the teshafox adze like spade. This he keeps always well sharpened, and with it he digs earth, cuts wood, and carves a dead camel into neat joints with surprising speed and skill. In the matter of earthwork, and especially canal digging, the Seistani is, perhaps, unsurpassed by any man in the world.35 Chap. V.] Courage in fighting is perhaps hardly to be expected from a long down- Courage and enterprise of the Seistani. trodden people, but that Seistanis Once possessed this manly virtue, in a remark able degree, is shown by many stubborn defences of their country in the past and by the part they have played elsewhere in history in the armies of Persian and other kings. Some forms of courage the Seistani still possesses. He fears nothing in the form of danger in water, and Seistan with its strong swollen rivers, and wide^ floods, presents many dangers in this line. The patient uncomplain ing way, in which our Seistani postal so^vars have faced the dangers of the road, whether from death dealing blizzards in winter, or from heat and want of water in summer, has many a time been deserving of very great admiration. They are not wanting in enterprize, and while deploring their present condition, are fond of talking about what they could achieve with encouragement, and a better administration. Many seek employment in distant Quetta, and have done well in Government service in the Commissariat and Transport Departments. Some even have served in our Native Infantry Regiments. It is not too much to hope that, with a better administration, and with but moderate ecouragement and assistance, the Seistanis would lose many of their present faults, and become a very excellent and praiseworthy people. The curse of Seistan, at present, is one which fortunately affects chiefly The opium habit. the better class, if indeed one can call any community by that name in this country. I refer to opium eating and smoking. This habit is unfettered and uncontrolled. The military class are the worst offenders, and they are an opium sodden and worthless lot.

General administration of Persian Seistan. The district of ^Persian Seistan, for administrative purposes, forms part of the Province of Khorasan, and the Governor of Seistan, locally known as the Amir, is subordinate to the Governor General {Wali) of Khorasan, to whom he pays annually the Government revenue of the district. The present Governor Amir ’Ali Akbar Khan, more commonly known by Some account of the Amir-Alam Khan. his title of Hashmat-ul-Mulk, is the eldest son of Hashmat-ul-Mulk Mir ’Alam Khan who, while hereditary Governor of Kain, took advantage of the factions and dissensions, which were rending the country, to take possession of it (in 1866) m the name of the Persian Government, and thus bring to an end what for some time past had been a merely nominal rule of the country on the part of Afghanistan. He built, as the new, the present capital of Seistan, the town of Nasirabad* (after the name of the Shah Nasir-ud-din). He was Governor of Seistan during Sir Frederick Goldsmid’s Mission, and did all he could to impede and annoy that Mission. A Seistan rebellion in 1873, beseiged him in the Capital until relieved by a Persian force from Meshed. He was replaced, as Governor, first by Samsam-ul- Mulk, a Persian official, and then by Muhammad Ja’far Khan of the Kajar family, but was reinstated in 1874 as Governor, and retained that office together with the Governorship of Kain until his death in 1891. On his death, the Persian Government appointed his eldest son Mir J Ali Amir ’AH Akbar Khan. Kh ^’ Governor of Seistan, with his father s title of Hashmat-ul-Mulk, while the Governorship of Kain was given to a younger son, Mir Ismail Khan, with the title of Shaukat-ul-Mulk. The Governorships of Seistan and Kain thus became separate, and have ever since remained so. Mir ’Ali Akbar Khan has two sons, Mir Ma sum Khanf and Muhammad Raza Khan, aged respectively 22 and 23 years. They have, each at various times, during their father’s absence from Seistan, administered the country as Deputy Governor. Such absences have been of frequent occurrence, as the Hashmat-ul-Mulk periodically resides on his family property at Hajiabad near Birjand. The Hashmat-ul-Mulk, who is now about 53 years of age, is a man of some strength of character ; he has a keen sense of humour, but is of a somewhat indolent character; which detracts from his merits as a Governor. He is not unpopular in his country. His sons have inherited their father’s indolence, but not his strength of character, and have proved weak rulers, too liable to be swayed by the varying influence of others. Neither of them has any popularity among the people of the country. The Governor belongs to an ancient Arab family of the Khuzaima tribe&gt; The descent of the Governor. W !' i&lt; ; h ‘ S S , a ' d , ?° haV ® be6n forcibl y ed from Arabia to Khorasan eight genera’ tions ago. The then chief of the tribe, Mir ’Ali Khan, arrived in Khorasan during the reign of Khalifa Harun-ul-Rashid in the commencement of the ninth century, and was settled in Kain, as a check upon the turbulent people of that district. The tribe already wealthy dock-owners increased in importance until their chief, another Mir ’Ali Akbar Khan, became in the seventeenth century Governor of Kain. Until quite recently the local power and authority of the Governor has been Power of Governor formerly supreme. supreme in Seistan, but of late years the Persian Government have commenced to pursue in this country the policy long practised elsewhere, whereby the power of local Governors has been greatly restricted. To such an extent has this been done in Seistan that, as will be noted at the end of this Chapter, it is difficult at the present moment to say what remaining power or authority the Governor of Seistan still possesses. * This has more commonly been known as Shahr-i-Nasiriya, and is now-a-days referred to by the people of the country simply as the Shahr. It is called, however, by us Nasratabad. f The elder, Mir Ma’sum Khan’s mother, is a lady of good birth and a wife by regular marriage. Muhammad Raza Khan’s mother is wife by a “ Sigha” marriage.[Chap. VI. 42 The instruments of the Governor's power. The instruments of authority, originally conferred upon the Governor where with to rule and administer this country over which he has until recently had supreme and undivided control, are as follows :— A military garrison of four guns and 36 gunners and 500 Infantry. Until recently the latter was composed of (I) The garrison. ^ K £ ini Regiment of Kain, but recently from the Karai Regiment of Turbat-i-Haidari. The Head-quarters and the Artillery remain at the City. The Infantry is divided between the City, and small detachments at Sihkuha, Siadak, Deh Dost Muhammad and other villages. The military receive pay partly in grain and partly in cash. Both are charged to Seistan revenues, and details will be found in the Statement I.* The military garrison, however, is only of nominal strength, and for reasons best known to the Military authorities, often exists chiefly on paper. I understand, however, that bv the exertions of the Yamin-i-Nizam, w r ho has recently assumed charge of all military matters in Seistan, the actual present strength is 410 Infantry. After the Persian custom the men eke out their small pay by following various professions such as shoemaking, peddling, money lending, etc., or by daily labour. Few are, therefore, ever available fer military duty. They are addicted to opium, and incapable of much physical exertion. Each man keeps a donkey on which he rides whenever required to move. The few r we have asked shewed themselves ignorant of how to open or load their rifles. I am told that this regiment compares unfavourably with many other Corps in Persia. An amusing story was told us by the Russian Consul of the occasion in 1901, when the Afghans occupied Deh Dost Muhammad and the Persian Army was called out to go to the Miankangi and turn them out. “Not a man could begot to move. After a couple of days of beating and driving together such helpless soldiers as could be found during which time the city resounded with their moans and lamentations, at last 50 men were collected, who were heavily drugged with opium and sent off to the front tied on their donkeys. ” The levy service consists of (2) Levy Service. 400 local sowars (Khawanin sowars) and 20 officers (Sahib Mansab). They are paid in grain at the following rates :— Per sowar Per officer 12 Tabriz Icharwdr, i.e., g 5 Indian maunds of grain. 24 Tabriz kharwdr, i e., 192 Indian maunds. This forms an annual charge on the Seistan revenues. Two-thirds of the sowars are mounted on horses and one-third on riding or jambdz camels. Seven ty of this Levy service are residents of Kain, and are in the personal service of the Governor and his two sons. The remaining Levies are engaged by the Khawanin and Kadkhudas of Seistan. A list of the number of Levies, which each of them is supposed to maintain and provide for miscellaneous service when required, is given in Statement K. This list is made from the information collect ed in the village to village enquiries. The totals differ a good deal from those agreed upon between the Central Government at Tehran and the local Governor. But the latter is only a budget provision made at settlement. It is, however, all that the Central Government allow for the service. The Priestly classes and judicial machinery cannot perhaps rightly be called , „ . , , an instrument of authority, but it is difficult (3) Priestly classes and ludicial machinery. . . . . . J c c-' • * , v in a general description ot Seistan to dis pose under any other head of the question of the administration of justice in the country. The leading Saiyads and Mujtahids receive grain allowances and grants of land free of revenue, and on this ground they may be deemed Govern ment servants. The part they play, as such, is confined merely to settling, by Shariat, such cases as may be brought before them. Petty cases are settled by such Sardars, or village headmen, as care to take them up. The rest are disposed of by the Governor, or his sons. No rules * Also at the top of Statement (II), Appendix 41.Chap. VI.] 43 appear to exist as to who should dispose of any particular class of cases beyond the fact that serious cases involving capital punishment, mutilation, torture or other severe punishment have hitherto been dealt with by the Governor, or his sons.^ The expense to which litigants are put in the form of bribes and squeezes m Seistan and the^ uncertainty of the results thereof have, of course, reduced all unnecessary litigation to a minimum. In practice the custom in Seistdn is for the Kadkhudas to settle all the cases they can themselves, and pocket the proceeds of the fines and bribes that such cases may permit of. No cases are allowed to proceed to higher authority, if such can be prevented. Needless to say, the parties themselves prefer to have their cases disposed of by the lowest pos sible tribunal, as the expenses involved by the aggrieved, and risks of the aggres- sor, increase materially with the status of the judicial authority concerned. Similarly, tribal Sardars dispose of all cases that come within their cognisance, while the Suiyad and Mujtcihid monopolize all the cases that can be interpreted to fall within the scope of religious law. The more serious cases go to the Governor or his sons, and the income derived from the exercise of these judicial functions is no small one. All cases, that can be construed to be connected with foreigners and aliens, are claimed for disposal by the Kdrguzdr. Agencies by 'which the Governor's power has been curtailed. The Governor was, as before stated, until recently, the supreme local authority in all matters relating to administration, justice and everything else in the country. Lately this has all been changed. A Kdrguzdr (Foreign Office &lt; Agent) has been appointed, whose duty it is to deal with all questions in which foreigners are concerned. He is directly subordinate to the Foreign Minister at Tehran, but in some respects, also, sub ordinate to the Karguzar at Meshed. Most of the work of the British and Russian Consuls in Seistan lie, therefore, with the Karguzar. The present incum bent is Musa Khan Naib-ul-Wazareh. A Sarhddddr has also been appointed. His duties are vague but, they include, as the name implies, the charge of the frontier of Seistan and Baluchistan. The present Sarhaddar is General Abdul Hamid Khan, Ghaffari, Yamin-i-Nizam, a very able and enlightened officer. He interprets his authority to extend to the settlement of all questions relating to the border, and between the inhabitants of either side thereof; also to the charge of the Military garrison of Seistan, as this is obviously necessary for the control of the border; also on the same grounds to the control of the Levy service. He is directly subordinate to the Foreign Minister at Tehran. Quite recently, moreover, a new official called a Muffatish* has been appointed in Seistan with orders to investigate the revenue system and administration of the country, with a view to reforms therein. This officer has, in the discharge of this duty, taken upon himself the administration of the Seistdn revenue, and deals direct with the revenue officials and village headmen of the country. He is directly subordinate to the Minister of Revenue at Teheran. The administration of the Customs posts and passport systems of the country is under Belgian officers, who are directly subordinate to the Belgian Minister of Customs at Tehran. They maintain their own establishments, try their own cases, inflict punishments, and exercise unrestricted authority over the people in all matters connected with their work to the scope of which, I might remark, they apply the very widest interpretation. It will thus be seen that the power and authority of the Governor of Seistan have been reduced to very small proportions, and it is difficult to say what authori ty has been left to him, and his sole remaining duties seem to be the maintenance of order in the interior of his district. The blame of everything is thrown on him by the other officials, while the instruments by which he has, hitherto, carried out his administration have been nearly all taken away from him. The Sarhaddar controls the Military and Levy establishments. The Muffatish controls the revenue officials, and interferes with the village headmen, and thus but little power is left in the Governor’s hands. As regards the people of the country themselves, it is hardly to be wondered that with so many independent masters over them’their position is far from being a happy, contended, or enviable one. [C639FD] * His assessment of the revenue will be found in Appendix 41.CHAPTER VII. CONTENTS. Land Tenure. Land State Assignments of revenue are only temporary—No cultivating rights in land—Rights in houses and gardens.CHAPTER VII. Land Tenure. This chapter somewhat resembles the historic one on snakes in Iceland, but the object of^ bestowing a separate chapter to this subject is not to imitate the above literary precedent, but to lay all due emphasis on the import ant fact, that all land in Persian Seistan is Khalisa, i.e., State property. Land tenures of any other nature do not exist. No one, except the Persian Govern ment, has any form of proprietary right to land in this country. Almost the same remarks apply to tenancy rights, as these also are non-existent, except in the case of a few privileged persons to whom villages have been assigned, such as the leading tribal chiefs, Saiyads and Mujtahids. Theoretically, except in the case of those lands of w r hich sanad of exemption from land revenue have been conferred on individuals, all such lands are liable to land revenue. These tenancy rights, ^however, are of a more or less temporary nature and, as illustrated by the case of Sardar Sa’id Khan, Nahrui, and others can be taken away at the caprice of either the local or the Central Government. Persons, other than the above few privileged individuals, have no rights whatever in lands in Persian Seistan, whether proprietary, tenancy, or cultivat ing. As will be described hereafter, the cultivation of a tract of land one year confers no prior right to the cultivation thereof by the same cultivators in the next or any succeeding year. In only two cases does the Seistani seem to possess some temporary rights of occupation, i.e., in that of the house in which he lives, and in that of gardens {bagh ox baghichd). These latter are small plots of land in the immediate vicinity of a village enclosed by a wall to prevent the ingress of cattle. Some are gardens in so far as they contain fruit trees, vegetables and vines ; others are only fields of barley, tobacco, or melons. In either case the builder of the walls has some sort of acknowledged tenancy right, and com pensation is paid for the cost of the wall or trees, should he be dispossessed. The squalor and worthlessness of the average dwelling houses has probably prevented the right of occupancy therein being put to much test, and the frequency with which most of the population change their village sites and habitations doubtless renders any such right, even if undisputed, of little real value to them. The ordinary Seistani appears to attach as little importance to his habitation in life as to his resting place in death. I have seldom seen such utter disregard for graves as is showm in Seistan. To inter the dead in ground above the ordinary flood level, and if possible near a guardian zidrat (shrine), concludes the last duties of the living to the departed. How soon the badger or jackal rifles the grave after the interment matters little to any one. The Seistani in short may be said to possess no rights of land tenure of any kind whether living or dead.46 coin Seis 7 CHAPTER VIII. CONTENTS.

For a proper understanding of the various weights and measures which will be alluded to in the following chapters, it is necessary to explain what these are. It will be seen from the diversity of weights and measures in Persia, and the different value attached to each in the several provinces, that the question is a complicated one, and confusion often arises therefrom. Weights. There are no less than four different kinds of weights current in Persian Seistan, i.e .— (rt) Kain. (b) Tabriz. (c) Meshed. (d) Seistan. The Tabriz weights are those officially recognized by the Persian Govern ment, and therefore the Government revenues of Seistan are calculated by Tabriz weight. As the Governor of Seistan is a resident of Kain, Kain weights even are used sometimes in calculations in his officiaf records. The trade connection of Meshed with Seistan necessitates the occasional use of Meshed weights. The Seistan weights are those most commonly used in all Seistan local transactions. The above weights each consist of miskdl, sir y man and kharwdr ; but the only weight which has the same value in all is the miskdP which is equal to 7i'99 English grains, or one eight thousandth of an Indian maund— A Kdin sir contains ... 9 miskdl. A Tabriz „ „ • • • ... 16 A Meshed ,, „ • • • ... 16I A Seistan „ „ ... O CO jj In all cases a man equals 4052V and a kharwdr equals one hundred man. Thus a Kain kharwdr equals ... Indian raaunds.

A krdn is said to weigh a miskdl. Very neat wooden boxes, made in Meshed, containing scales and weights, are sold in the city for 12 krdn. The miskdl in such a box weighed. 72 grains. 30 miskdl = x sir Seistdni,. 1,200 &gt;, = r man Seistani. = 6 seers Indian. 8.000 „ = l maund Indian. = 82'28S7 lbs. = 575,9999 grains. 1 „ = 7 * 1 ‘99 grains. f In some Seistani villages, such as Bunjar, a Seistani man equals 32 miskdl, while in Kala-i-Nau it is 31. If 32 miskdl are taken as a Seistani man, the weight of a miskdl works out to 4^ masha Indian, the value given in some books.[Chap. VIII. 4$ Measures, Trade among the local inhabitants is generally carried out in grain. Grain is calculated by measure, seldom by weight. Grain measures, there fore, come first in importance. The measure generally used is a wooden or copper bowl called kil. These vary a good deal in size. The size in ordinary use by the Sarmushrif (see Chapter IX) when dividing the produce of the thrash ing floor contains from 16 to 20 Seistani man of wheat, and needs three or four men'to move it. As the grain is divided by shares and not by w r eight, any large convenient vessel is frequently used. For selling grain from the pits an accurate measure is used holding one, five or ten Seistani man. Such measures are made in wood by the village carpenter, if necessary, the accuracy of the measure is checked by weighing the contents. Measurement by kU admits of fraud especially when done quickly, as there is a great art in filling a kU exactly full, and not either too full, or less than full. An expert measurer {Jill kash or kil gar dan) can cause an increase or decrease of quite 10 per cent. To check this the tahkta kash kil is sometimes used. It only* differs from the ordinary kil by having a flat board, which, after the kil is filled to over-flowing, is drawn across the rim of the bowl thus ensuring correct measure. This process naturally takes a longer time. Cloth measure. —The measure in use among weavers will be described in Chapter XLIV on Weavers, Measures of bhiisa.—Bhusa is calculated by the sack (jwwdl) full. The ordinarycontains an average of 50 pounds of bhtisa. Land measures. —No scale for the measurement of land on any scientific principle is in vogue in Seistan—a fact which came into prominent notice when land began to be purchased for the British Consulate and for traders’ buildings. The Persian land measure of area, the zar is not used in Seistan, and the zark was found to have as many different values in the various portions of Persia as has the sir^ man, or kharwdr. The zar was, after a lengthy discussion in Tehran, eventually adopted for official use in Seistan. It is one and one-sixth yard long, and a square zar is one and thirteen—sixteenth square yards, i.e., 3.556 zar go to an English acre. This measure, however, in Seistan, where sale of land is unknown among the people of the country, is not understood, or used. The only measure of land ordinarily used is called pdgdo, more commonly pronounced pdogdo. It originally means the area of land that can be cultivated by one plough and a pair of bullocks. Half a pdgdo is called locally either nim c'halla or nimali. Lesser areas are calculated by the quantity of seed required for sowing them. Pdgdo vary in area according to the amount of land which can be cultivated h,y a certain amount of seed. An ordinary pdgdo of average resource will sow about 4^ Seistani kharwdr of wheat or barley grain. The area sown by a pdgdo varies as much as from 15 to 92 acres, but an average .pdgdo cultivates about 55 acres (see Statement M, which gives the average areas). There are several kinds of pdgdo in use in Persian Seistan ; these and the important part which the pdgdo plays in the life of a Seistdni will be fully described hereafter. (Chapter XI.) * This corresponds to what in England is called the “ stricken ” bushel. f The Persian Government have exacted from us 5 ^ran per square 2;ir as the purchase priee of land in Seistan, i.e., Rs. 4,845 equal to ^3235 per acre. Note 2. — The masons in the city of Nasratabdd have a treasure called a zar ; this tjs the .distance from the tip of the nose to the end of the middle finger when the hand is outstretched. The ustad or master mason’s stretch is recognized as the standard zar. Note 3.—A document belonging to Mulla Ibr&amp;hum of Sunjar, which was seen just before leaving Seistan, record ed that r5,000 din^r were paid for the hereditary rights [maurusi-i-khud az imlakri-ardei) in the.lands of Shela-h Siah ’Ab in the Mahal-i-Kachian. The area of those lands is given as 15 chains (Jarib), of which 7 jarib 3 dang were said to be culturable. This document was probably made in the year 1081 A. H. (about 1665 A D-), as other documents among which it was found are of that date. Mulla Ibrahim, a very well'informed man said that the was 60 single paces by Co single paces. Taking a single pace at 275 feet, the area,of &amp; jarib would be f of an acre. Four dang are said to be one jarib. The Mulla says that this measure is still used by high officials who have had acquaintancewith Persian lands outside Seistan. He and other educated men believe that up to the time °t Nadir Shah many possessed rights of ow.netshlp ip the land of Seistan,49 Chap. VIII.] _ A SI ^ a ^ ^ e asure is sometimes used for dividing land into special plots. 1 his is the gam which means pace and equals two and three quarters feet. Measurement of •water .—The method of measurement used in the division of water is always by time. The unit of measurement is called a meh y which means a day or night of 12 hours, and corresponds to half the Shabana roz of India. Half a meh is called a mm meh. Lesser measures are seldom used, but in case of necessity calculations are based on hours {sdat). . _ Mo ne y currency. All cash transactions in Persian Seistan are calculated in Persian currency which is as follows :— 5'bo dinar = 1 shahi. 20 shahi — 1 bran.* 2 krdn = 1 kajariy locally called gajari. 10 krdn — 1 tumdn. Krdn are not locally procurable, and all payments in this country are made in kajdri. The value of the Persian money fluctuates largely. In 1903 on arrival in Seistan we found 100 rupees equivalent to about 35 ^ krdn ) whereas now, in I 9 ° 5 ) it i s equivalent, to 4 20 kran. Sir Lepel Griffin said at the meeting of the Imperial Bank of Persia held in London in December 1905. “ The unit of cur rency in Persia is the krdn. There was nominally a gold currency but it was hardly existent. Thirty years ago the krdn was the same value as the franc — about 25 to the pound sterling. When the Imperial Bank was started 16 years ago the rate was 30 krdn to the pound : now it was 60 krdn to the pound. In these notes 55 kran have been taken as equivalent to one sovereign, and 3*67 krdn as one rupee, i.e. } a rupee equals ff or krdn', this was the Imperial Bank rate when the figures were first compiled. * In Seistan 8 shahi — i krdn, but in Persia generally 2o shahi =» i krdn.CHAPTER IX.

Revenue administration of Persian Seistdn. As the appointment of a separate Chief Revenue Officer in Seistan* is of such recent date, and the changes made or proposed to be made by him in the revenue administration of the country are not yet known, I will describe in this and the following chapters only the revenue administration and system, which has hitherto existed in this country. The revenue administration has until quite recently been entirely in the hands of the Governor, who works in revenue matters through his revenue secretary, called the Mustaufi (at present one Kaushid Khan). He is paid a salary of 1,040 krdn from the budget allotment made by the Shah’s Government for carry ing on the administration of the country (see the first page of Chapter XIII) ; the Governor also gives him a grain allowance as a personal favour. For purposes of revenue administration Persian Seistan is divided into four circles (mahdl )— [a) Shib-i-ab.f (b) Pusht-i-ab.f {c) Shahraki and Nahruf. (d) Miankangf. A complete list of villages comprised in each circle, giving much valu- „ able information regarding each, will be Statements A and 3 and the villages. , i • ^ , * i T -&gt; 'm found in Statements A and B. I he names of the Kadkhudas, the tribes and the number of the windmills, etc., has been given by Khan Bahadur Mir Sham Shah, whilst the number of the ploughs and the seed sown was obtained by the irrigation party in their village to village enquiries, the greater part of this work having been done by Amir Singh, Zilladar. The total number of villages shown in the statements as existing in Persian Seistan is very large, but the encampments of the nomad herd and flock- owners, ramaddr and gdoddr, are not included in these of course. The largest villages are found in the first two circles. The larger villages are of a permanent character, but a great number of the small villages are not so. Seistanis for various reasons, sickness, floods, etc., frequently desert villages, and start new ones on fresh sites. Most villages are known by the names of their kadkhuda ; as these periodically change, the village names also change, which is apt to create confusion. Over each circle is a Sar Mushrif whose position corresponds in revenue matters somewhat with that of a Tehsildar in the Punjab. These are appointed by the Governor, and are directly under the Mustaufi. Theoretically, there ought to be five sar mushrif in Seistan, but the number varies. In 1903 there were three. In 1904 there were only two, z.£., Ajuddn (Adjutant) Mir Darwish Beg, and Sultan (Captain) Mir Husain, both Arabs of Kain ; who derive their military titles from their connection with that Regiment. In each circle there is under the Sar Mushrif a permanent official called Tahwilddr appointed by the Governor, The TahwildSr. , , j T u r and whose duty it is to keep charge of the revenue grain. These also are mostly residents of Kain, and usually rela tions of the Sar Mushrif,% and sometimes the Sar Mushrif themselves. * The Muffatish, page 43, Chapter VI. His assessment of the revenue will be fouud in Appendix 41. •j- In Seistan on the Persian side of the river they talk of the north as “ up ” (bala), south as “ down ” (shib). The Helmand in Seistan runs north, and thus ,£ down-stream ” in our sense is called “ up-stream ” by Seistanis and soon. But on the Afghan side of the river and shib are used for up and down stream respectively. Pus hi (back) is also used to denote north. Thus we have Pusht-i-’Ab, Pusht-i-Kuh denoting tne north side of the water or hill. J The present Tah-wilddr are:— 1. Sbib-i-’Ab, Sarbandi. Ajudan Mir Darwfsh who is also Sar Mushrif. 2. Pusht-i-'Ab— Abu Turab. 3 . Nahrui and Shahraki. Amir Badin, brother of Ajudan Mir Darwish 4. Miankangi— Mir Rahman, brother of Sultan Mir Husain.52 [Chap. IX. Both of these officials are the Governor’s own men and are P^d by him. Recoveries are made from the wheat and baney harvest of the p oug or eir services {vide Statements at the end of Chapter XII), since the quantity o grain thus recovered largely exceeds that drawn by the individuals, the Governor makes a handsome profit from their services. Some say that the only remuneration received by these officials is that drawn as Sahib Mansab of Sowars {vide page 42, Chapter VI), the value of the appointment being the favour of the Governor, who conferred it, and the opportunities it gives. Doubtless the remuneration differs in each case and is privately arranged between the Governor and is man. Under each Sar Mushrif there are also a number of Mushrif (crop watchers) appointed by the Governor. Ihese are TheMushrif&gt; generally soldiers; and are appointed temporarily for each year’s harvest. Their duties are to look after the crops from March, the time the spring crops are approaching ripeness, un tu this and the autumn crops have been harvested ; they then take charge of the produce until the Government share is measured out and disposed of, about the end of October or the middle of November. More detailed^ accounts of their duties and remuneration will be found in Chapter XI on the Village Community. The most important Government instruments for revenue^ administration may be said to be the village headmen The Kadkhuda, the deh and the jam. {kadkhuda). As a general rule, there is one kadkhuda in each village {deh). In larger villages there are sometimes two kadkhuda, while in the case of smaller villages there may be one kadkhuda to each village, or to a group of villages. The reason of this is that each circle {mahdl) is subdivided into jam, each of which is under a kadkhuda who is responsible for the cultivation thereof. A jam may include only a portion of a village, one village, or several villages. Kadkhuda are appointed by the Governor, except in certain cases, where Sardars or leading Saiyads and Mujtahids are in possession of villages, and appoint their own kadkhuda. As these appointments depend on the payment of presents, or on acceptance of contracts {ijdra) for Government revenue at enhanced rates, they generally are given to the highest bidder, and thus kadkhuda are constantly changing. Their duties and remunerations are also described in Chapter XI on the Village Community. Under the orders of a kadkhuda and appointed by him is a village official called the Pdkdr. Besides being a sort of water bailiff, he is the orderly and general factotum of the kadkhuda. Pdkdr are generally men of considerable intelligence and skill in laying out, and aligning new water channels, selecting sites for tamarisk bands and so on. They see that the orders of the kadkhuda about the distribution of water are carried out. They call out and collect the men liable to contribute their labour in each village, and distribute among them whatever work has to be done in canal digging, silt clearing, and hand building. They also collect whatever village hashar (labour gang) the local Government may call for. It necessarily follows that the pdkdr is a man of importance in a village. His pay is given in kind at the threshing floor as described in the Chapter on the Village Community. The Mirab. In Afghanistan the pdkdr is also called the Mirdb. But in Persian Seistan the mirdh is a high official, appointed by the Governor, to supervise some important irrigation work, or large canal system, such as the Band-i-Seistan, or the Rud-i- Hasanki. Sardar Purdil Khan and the Kalantar of Iskil were the mirdh on the Rud-i-Seistan, the former managing the Band work, and the Rud-i-Seistan in the Shib-i-’Ab Mahal. In 1905 Mr. Keyes says, the Deputy Governor, Mir Masum Kh an was made mirdh of all Persian Seistan.

System of agriculture and agricultural products of Persian Seistdn. Persian Seistan comprises an area of about 500,000 acres of culturable land Extent of cultivation. irrigable by the existing canal systems. Of this area about 150,000 acres are an nually cultivated. Statements A and B give a careful record of the cultivation done in 1903-04. The total figures at line 131 of Statement B illustrate the proportions of spring and autumn cultivation as follows :— Name of crop. Area in acres.

In the greater portion of the land only one crop is cultivated in the yean Fallows and manure. ^ nd SUch land ' 1S known as yakfasi-i- har-salah or do fasl-i-do-salah, A small portion is cultivated for two crops in the year (do fasl-i-har-salah), and a small area for two crops in three years (do fasl-i-sih-salah). The land is not manured, but fertilized as it is every year by fresh layers of rich silt, there appears no reason why more crops could not be safely and profitably taken from the land than is now done. As a general rule, the land is allowed to lie fallow (darisht) in alternate years, although some village communities go on cultivating the same lands for three or four years, until its fertility is so reduced that they are compelled to re move themselves to other lands. As a rule, the lands cultivated with autumn crops, except millet and maize, are, after the autumn harvest, immediately sown with wheat and barley, and then lie fallow till the autumn sowings of the following year. The area of wheat and barley cultivation so far exceeds that of the autumn crops, that the greater part oi the wheat and barley is sown on fallow land. No manure (ambdr) is ever used in Seistan. Large quantities of camel thorn (khdr) and a bush called chughuk and other weeds grow up on fallow lands. As these are valuable for fuel, no steps are taken to restrict their growth. The spring cultivation (safid bar) as stated above largely exceeds the Spring crops. autumn cultivation. The principal spring are wheat (gandum) and barley crops (jau) which are grown in the proportion of about 8 to 3 respectively. Wheat. The wheat is of excellent quality consists of no less than 12 kinds— and (1) Naishki or Nishki, (3) Boldm. (3) Surkh Khosha* [C639FD] p[Chap. X. 56 ( 4 ) Shutar Danddn. (5) Sidh Das. (6) Safid Chdh. (7) Sidhyak or Sidhdk. (8) Dehyak or Deyak. ( 9 ) Kullah. (10) Zair Barnah or Lobatak. (11) Kela Gandum. (12) Pappo. (1), (2) and (3) above areithe kinds most cultivated; (4) and (5) are much liked, but not largely grown, as owing to their sweetness people are fond of cutting off the ears of the standing crop, and eating the grain after parching the ears over a fire. This leads to much theft from the standing crops of these varieties, and hence their cultivation is unprofitable. Nos. (7), (8) and (9) are largely cultivated, as they are said to be immune from rust (zardi or zarcha). No. (11) is a mixture of several other varieties, and also much cultivated, as it is supposed to be less liable to damage from diseases. The other kinds are less cultivated. No. (12) pappo, the least of all; it originally came from Kandahar. Wheat generally requires three waterings, but nazshki and siahydk are said to be able to do with only one watering. Barley thrives excellently in Seistan, perhaps too much so, because when Bar!ey once grown on land, it reproduces itself for two to three years, and the result is that most wheat crops have an admixture of barley in them. The other spring crops are opium (tirydk), mustard (sarshaf), mando otherspring crops. otmandab, the taramira of the Punjab (eruca saliva), lentils (adas), masur {ervum lens) ; but these are not cultivated in large quantities. A great deal too much opium, however, is grown than is good for the people of Seistan. The kharif or autumn crops are known in Seistan as Sabzbar. They Autumn crops. represent only about one-seventh of the cultivation of the year. The people attach comparatively little importance to them, except as regards water melons on which they set great importance, as they provide them with the principal staple of their food throughout half the year. The principal autumn crops are— Water-melons (hinduana). Millet {zurrat) {sorghum vulgare.) Maize called juwdri in Seistan. Cotton (kdlak). Lentils (mdk) perhaps called lubia in the Punjab. Mash, called mung in the Punjab (phaseolus mungo). Til {kun'jad) {sesamum indicum). China {arzan) {panicum miliacum). Melons (kharbuza). Tobacco {tambdku). Carrots (zardak). Turnips {shalgham). Cucumber (khidr). Beetroot {chukundar). Pumpkin {kadu).Chap. X.] 57 Onions {j)iaz)y or in Baluchi pimaz. Brinjals (badmjan), or in Baluchi banjan. Garlic {sir). Lucerne (rishka). Of the above by far the largest crop is that of water melons. A statement showing the usual times of sowing and harvesting of the various spring and autumn crops will be found as Appendix 6. Cultivation of spring crops. Wheat sowing commences at the autumn equinox on September a 1st, or Sowing of wheat. even a few days before : the sowing time , , eac ^ v iH a g e varies according to the time when water can be urned on to the lands, and labour is available. Early sowings are the best, not only because the outturn is larger, but because the seed sown is less than that required in late sowings. The Seistani proverb says— “ Gandum ra mi-khwaki bi-kuni ba-ambdr “ Sumbula ab bi-gir ba~mizdn bi-kar!' If you would fill your granaries, irrigate when the sun is in the Virgin f August 22nd), and sow when it is in Libra (September 24th). S Larly sowing in September and October is called hisht pagah or gundum-i- nau-mahi. That sown in November or December is called panj-matii or siiish-mahi) while wheat sown later in January and February is called kisht-irah As a rule, sowings end with February, but in some years, such as 1902-04. wheat was sown up to the spring equinox {Nauruz) March, 21st. . Thls lon g s . owi . n g period in Seistan opens out great possibilities in the wav of spnng crop cultivation, and is a remarkable characteristic of the country So long is the period during which sowing is possible, that the local sayinfT' the wheat crops on the Khash* (*&gt;., in the Chakhansur tract of Afghan Seistan) are sown fresh from the harvest at Chaharburjak” has some justification in tcict. In early wheat sowing (kisht pagah) from 6 to 7 Seistani man (from 36 to Quantity of seed sown. 4 ^ Indian seers) are sown per acre. , c . . /s- t i• . VVhilst in late sowings {kisht about 10 Seistani man (60 Indian seers) are sown per acre. On poor lands more seed is sown than on good. More seed is sown when thrown broadcast over the land {tukhm sar) than when it is dropped into the furrows {tukhm kal). More seed is required for sandy land, where allowance has to be made for loss by wind and more seed is also sown in the jungle tracts of Miankangi to allow for loss of seed through wild pig. In Seistan, where the area of land to be cultivated by each plough is entirelv regulated by the quantity of seed to be sown, by each kind of ploucrh much attention is devoted to the distance apart which seed should be scattered’ In sowing broadcast (tukhm sar), if only S to 12 grains come within the space represented by a man’s hand with fingers spread wide apart, this is called tukhm-i-tunak, while thick sowing, where 20 to 30 grains fall within the same space, is called tukhm-i-bdzband. Tukhm-i-tunak requires from 30 seers to one Indian maund per acre while tukhm-i-bazbana takes about one-and-a-half or even sometimes as much as 2 Indian maunds per acre. * The Khash Rud does not come down in flood til! the end of March, and vet a lar?e area nf W I of a special late kind is grown on the flooded area, and is ready for harvest at the end of May. W eat58 [Chap. X. Seed sown early and scattered wide apart on good soil is said in Seistan to produce 40 to 50 stalks from each seed. We have seldom seen more than 14 or 15.* Barley sowing commences in December and ends in February, though on occasion it is sown up to the end of March, Barle J r ‘ U p to a period one month later than that at which wheat is usually sown. Barley is always sown more thickly than wheat seed, to the extent of about one 'Seistani man (12 lbs.) of barley extra per acre. It is chiefly sown on lands in the vicinity of villages so as to be^ near at hand for the grazing of the village animals on the green crop. Its cultivation is in all respects similar to that of wheat. Sometimes self-sown (khud-ni) wheat and barley is cultivated. The area is very small, and the produce belongs to the plough which originally cultivated the field, where the grain has sprung up. They give the necessary watering, and thus secure the maturity of the crop. Method of cultivating 'wheat and barley. The land is first flooded with water, a depth of 6 to 9 inches being preferred. To do this ridges are made to divide the VVaterms * land into suitable plots to secure a uniform depth of water. The plots are therefore larger or smaller as the land is level or uneven. In the warm days of September or October, the land is fit for ploughing pioQoh . n some five to eight days after flooding. No ous ing ‘ preliminary ploughings are done in Seistan. When the soil has reached the right stage of moisture the cultivators of the plough {vide page 70) go forth to clear the jungle off the land, plough and sown all in one operation. Two or three of the members of the plough clear the bushes ahead of the plough, one man {gaoran) directs the bullocks and another sows the seed. The above procedure never varies except in the method of sowing. The sower precedes the plough and scatters the seed broadcast {tukhm sar) either thinly {tukhm-i-tunak) or thickly {tukhm-ubdzband) ) or follows the plough, and drops the seed into the furrow. The method of sowing seed with a drill -is not known in Seistan. Ploughing in most parts of Seistan means little more than surface scratching, for the ploughshare only goes some 4 to 6 inches deep. When the seed has been ploughed in, the plough bullocks are attached to a „ . . ^ , smoother or presser in the form of a flat Covering m the seed. . , , . . f . . . , , log {mala) which is drawn over the newly ploughed ground at the end of each day’s work, and buries the seed out of the reach of birds. Nevertheless a great quantity of seed must be eaten in Seistdn by the vast flocks of rooks which appear at the beginning, and stay till the end of the sowing season of each year ; less seed Is lost, the cultivators say, when the seed is sown tukhm-kal. Grazing down the green crops. A fact which has doubtless some influence on the quantity of the seed sown on various lands is the necessity for good fodder in the depth of winter. Horses and cattle are turned out to graze on the young green barley crops, which are also sometimes cut for fodder. The young wheat is grazed down by sheep, as it is supposed to be indigestible for horses and cattle. The right of Government to levy one-third of the green crop as revenue, and the manner in which this is done, and the young crops are eaten, will be found described in the next chapter. It is doubtless these demands for green fodder which make the cultivators sow late sown wheat and all barley so thickly although they do not seem them- * Japanese and Chinese wheat planted in ridges 20 inches apart (using 10 lbs. per acre) is said to giveSo and some times 80 stalks per grain.59 Chap. X.] [C639FD] R selves to realise the connection between cause and effect in this matter The same phenomenon is to be seen in the lands of the Punjab irrigated by the Muzaffanjarh inundation canals where two maunds of seed per acre is sown for obviously the same reason. Grazing on crops is put a stop to as soon as the wheat or barley is ready to send out stalks. y In the famine period which occurred in Seistan in the winter of iqo2-cw we have seen the villagers sitting out in fields of young barley in large numbers during February, breaking off the green barley stalks and eating them. Barley is preferred to wheat, as it is said to be sweeter and more sustaining. In the warm days of September, October, February and March, the seed sown Watering of wheat and barley. springs up in seven or eight days, whereas __ j t_„„ 0 v i. i rr ln C0 ^ er days of November, December d January, it takes some fifteen to twenty days in appearing. i W f h f t at and b y le Y 1 ece,ve tlle , lr flrst watering when they have sprung up well dear o f the ground and begin to throw out leaves. The people say it is time to g^ve the first watering when the crop is high enough to turn sheep in to graze on it without fear of their pulling up the young plants by the roots. • !,• l a T ary ’ F ? bru . ar &gt; r a ' d March . sometimes April, Seistan enjoys periodical showers of rain, and sometimes a snowfall of 2 to 4 inches. During this season it is often unnecessary to irrigate the crops. On very light soils such as those among the sand hills of Jazmak, which are famous for the excellence of their wheat, only one watering is said to suffice, i.e., that given to the land at the time of ploughing. &amp; In warmer loam sods as many as four waterings are given between the time of sowing and maturing of the crops. Such cases as the above are very exceptional wtat anfcdey. ^ ^ ^ t0 tW ° are squired to mature Weeding* In April immense quantities of camel thorn {khcir) and a dwarf ihand {chughiik) and other weeds spring up in the wheat and barley fields and thereby reduce the yield of the crop No weeding, however, is done in Seistan and no effort is made to cope with this evil. This is doubtless due to the fact that the ands are redistributed every year, and no one has any personal interest in clearino- them of weeds. Thus from time immemorial these weeds and thorns have become an accepted attribute of cultivation. In large portions of Seistan, and especially in the more populous area, where tamarisk jungle has now quite disappeared, the people depend on these thorns and bushes for firewood. In the early spring the cornfields abound with a species of wildf spinach called locally saozt which is largely eaten, and in the scarcity of the winter of 1902-02, helped the people to sustain life. r Reaping* , cu [ ; ^ om a hout the first}; to the end of May, and wheat from about 15th May to 15th June. Owing to the thick growth of thorns and weeds in the cornfields, the corn when ripe is not cut down to the ground as in most other countries; the upper half of the stalks only are cut off with a sickle, and tied into hide bundles. 1 he reapers do their work standing. Little or no value is attached S ? e , 1 ’ f ,, 0 Magazine for A.

Only in winter is bhusa (chopped straw) ever used. 1 he later processes of stacking, threshing and winnowing the corn are described in t e next chapter. Opium. Opium {post) is cultivated by the more influential kadkhuda of the Rud-i- ^ ' Seistan villages, and little is grown by Opium (paparersomnxferum). ordinary villagers. Not only is its culti vation restricted by the personal objections of the better minded people, who recognise the demoralizing effect of opium, but by the system ^ in practice of levying Government revenue on it. Unlike other land revenue this is collected by the Foreign Office Agent (Kdrguzdr), and the illicit profits thereon form one of the perquisites of that office. He sends an assessor {arrdz) round the country about April, who by rough assessment [arrdzi) fixes the quantity of opium each grower should deliver as the Government share of his crop. 1 he authorized share is said by some people to be one quarter of the produce, by others one-fifth, while others again say one-third, as in the case of other crops. In any case the assessor takes as much as he can, and ^ the people complain that the share taken is so great that none but the influential men can grow it» Although, assessed in kind, opium-growers can pay the revenue in cash at the rate of 200 krdn per Seistani man, and this they prefer to do, as they can generally sell it themselves at 240 krdn per man. No opium is grown in the Miankangi. The poppy seed is sown in November and December. The land is irrigated and ploughed in the same way as for wheat and barley. The seed being light is mixed with 10 to 15 parts of earth and both are scattered together on the ploughed land which is then pressed down with the mala. About one Indian seer of seed is sown per acre of land. The field is divided into small plots to regulate the watering. The poppy plants appear in ten to twelve days, and when they are 4 to 6 inches high, the weeds are removed, and the plants, if too thickly sown, are thinned out {siwd kardan) and watered. When the plants flower, the fields are again weeded and watered. Two such waterings are given before the pods form. When the juice forms in the pod 4 or 5 incisions are made for the juice to come out and collect on the skins of the pod. This operation is generally done in the evening, as the nights are calmer than the days. When the juice is collected, the pods are allowed to dry, and are collected by hand. The weight of the opium thus collected is from three to six times the weight of seed sown ; in normal years the divisible produce will be about five times the seed sown. The seed not required for next year’s sowing is sold in the city where it is put through a press to secure the oil which is used for illumination. The cake resulting from the pressing is given to cattle, and is valued equally with that made from Til seed, but not so highly as that from cotton seed. In Statement* A double dagger is placed to all the villages that grew opium in that year, and in Statement L the acreage of opium cultivated on each canal is given, while in Statement G the outturn from each Mahal is given. This information shows that the total area under opium cultivation in Persian Seistan was i45'2 acres; that the total produce was about 90 Seistan man } 24 sir representing a cash value of 21,741 krdn, or 5,924 rupees, while the Government share amounted to 22 Seistani man 26 sir of the cash value of 1,481 rupees. In ordinary years an acre of poppy cultivation should produce from 30 to 40 Seistani sir, but 1903-04 was an unfavourable year for opium, and the produce was only reckoned at 25 Seistani sir per acre. * The ‘ arraz’ works in Kaini man, but the figures in the Statements have been converted into Seistani man.Chap. X.] 61 • Lentils and oil seed. A cold weather pulse, well known throughout Northern India, is sown about Adas, known in the Punjab as Masur (ervum the same time, and in much the same way ] ens:) as barley. About six Indian seers of seed is sown per acre. The crop matures with one or two waterings. There is not much demand for adas and only a small area is sown by each plough. Until recently there was a small press called locally a Marew in the Seistan Mando or mandab known in the Punjab as capital, and a small area of taramira was taramira {Eruca sativa.) ^ ^ grown near the city. The oil is valued at a good price in Seistan as a medicine for camels. It is sown in December and cut in May. Autumn Crops. Melons. • Both sweet melons (kharbuza) and water melons {hinduana) are grown in Seistan, but the former only to a very limited extent. Water melons are very extensively cultivated, and form the principal autumn crop of the country. Our measurements show that in 1904 in Persian Seistan 6,960 acres on the . Rud-i-Seistan and ^,217 acres in the Mian- kangi were cultivated with melons, making a total of 10,177 acres. This represents 61 per cent, of the whole area of autumn crops in the former tract, and 36 per cent, in the latter, or six and ten per cent, respectively of the whole annual cultivation of each tract. Whilst the total melon cultivation is nearly seven per cent, of the whole area cultivated annually. About two Indian seers of melon seed are sown to the acre of land. From careful enumerations made it appears that from 2,400 to 5,120 water melons are ^ f produced per acre, giving an average of Uuantity of seed sown and yield. 1 ^ , 1 &gt; o o . ^ 3,760 melons per acre. 1 hey weigh trom 5 to 20 lbs. each, the average weight however being io lbs. Thus an acre of land produces an average of no less than 460 maunds, 17 tons of water melons. Taking the whole area of melon cultivation in 1904, viz,, 10,177 acres and calculating that the Riid-i-Seistan lands yielded an average of 3 ,000 melons, and the Miankangl lands 3,750 melons per acre, and assum ing that the water melons and sweet melons are the same, we find that Persian Seistan produced in that one season alone 32,943,750 melons. It must be remembered, too, that 1904 was a most disastrous one for melons, and the yield was much below the normal, as worms developed in the young melons, and also water was deficient at the maturing season, especially in the villages at the tail of the canals of Sihkuha, Warmal, etc. It is possible, therefore, to understand what an important part this crop plays in the life „. r , of the people. Water melons are usually Price of melons. i i &lt;- 7 / &lt;t&lt;i sold at from 20 to 40 per kran. 1 he better price being obtained at the city, or the big villages near to it, and the lesser price in the out-of-the-way Miankangl. In 1904 nowhere could more than 15 be got for this price and generally only 10 per krdn (about 4 annas or pence) were obtainable. The melons were difficult to get at the end of October and were exhausted by the end of December, whereas in 1903 they were plentiful to the end of February. There were probably twice as many melons in 1903 as in 1904. Not only were large areas of flooded lands sown to melons, but the crop thrived and yielded in abundance. Both sweet and water melons are sown in the same manner. Sowing of both begins at Nauruz (21st March) Method of sowing. with all the unsuppressed excitement of pleasureable anticipation that Seistanis enjoy in the matter of this their favourite food product. In some villages the sowing may even fee a few days earlier. Sweet melons are not sown after the end of May, but late sowings of water melons are made in July. The land is first watered and ploughed. After ploughing, straight furrows are made about 8 to 10 feet apart, into which a man following the plough drops two seeds at intervals of about 2 feet, and a return furrow is made to cover up the seed.62 [Chap. X. / If the moisture in the soil is such that the melons will mature without further watering, the soil is pressed down with the flat log of wood {mala). If, however, the land has to be irrigated, the, mala is not used, but when the melon plants show above the ground, which happens some six to eight days after the sowing, deep narrow water-courses are cut between the rows of melons. The water is admitted into these a month after the plants appear and is not allowed to spread over the ground, but reaches the roots by soaking through the soil. These water-courses are a characteristic feature of the country, and the vicinity of villages is always cut up with a thick net work of them. They are cut across the paths that form the high roads of the country without the least regard for the-convenience of travellers, and are a great obstruction to traffic. Melons are also sown in straight parallel lines of small holes dug in lands on the shores of rivers, and the Hamlin from which the spring floods have receded. These get no watering. Ordinarily melons mature with from one to four waterings. The earlier melons begin to ripen, and become available for consumption about Time of ripening, ; he laS , t We . e , k „ ° f J™®- and ar f P'ertiM from the middle of July onwards.' Sweet melons are usually over by the middle or end of September. Water melons are collected in the fields in September and heaped into Storing and uses of melons. st f acks to be di vided among the cultivators of the plough. Hired labour has some times^ to be employed in harvesting melons. Each labourer gets ten melons for a day’s work from early morning to midday. When the melons are divided, each man takes his share home, and places it in a hut made of matting, or buries the melons in a pit, but the latter is seldom done. Water melons keep well, and are eaten as food up to the end of February; later than February they are said to be indigestible. * If the supply is in excess of the food requirements, some of the water melons are opened and the pulp is pressed and boiled down into coarse sugar called by Seistanis do shau and by Baluchis shirag, the pulp is also sometimes dried in the sun and stored. The seed is collected and eaten, parched or raw, and sells for much the same price as wheat. Melons pay revenue at the rate of one-quarter of the produce. This is Revenue assessed on melons. levied however in cash, and, as a rule, each , _ ivt u t i • plough is assessed at 20 to 40 krdn after the Muslim has inspected the crop of the village j or sometimes only the mahdl is inspected, and a rate per plough for the whole mahdl fixed. rrom As has been said water melons are the favourite food of the people Value of melons as food. early in July, to as late as the end of Feb- , , , . . , ruary. The food is sustaining, refreshing and thn-st-quenching, and when eaten in moderation is very wholesome During the hot months of the year the cultivators live entirely on melons, and eat onlv one small piece of bread during the day with the melons. On long journeys in the sun, water melons are most invigorating, restoring the tired energies almost instantaneously. Baluchis will face any labour or exertion in the heat if assured of a supply of melons to eat as required. Supplies of water melons are always taken by travellers who risk long waterless journeys in summer across the deserts. mil Leu Millet is known locally as zurrat, each _ plough cultivates a little millet tAMXet (Sorghum Vuigare), ^ addition to melons. It is grown only , x , t the grain and not for fodder.

Some four to six Indian seers of grain are sown per acre. e seed is sown broadcast, and the system of cultivation is the same as that for wheat or barley. About six days after sowing the young plants begin to appear and about fourteen days after that the crop is watered. On cool lands no furthe? watering isrequired but on most lands two waterings are required to matur' the crop. Early sown millet ripens early in August, and late sown at the end of August.. i Chap. X.] 63 ' ■ I On the newly formed beds of silt on the edges of rivers from which the spring flood has receded millet is often sown broadcast and left on the surface, and no ploughing is done or waterings given. The heads are broken off and collected for threshing. The cultivators are generally able to do this work themselves, but if hired labour is employed, each labourer for a day’s work, from sunrise to 4 P.M., is paid from 10 to 20 heads of millet as his wage. This count is usually made in pairs {juft). The stalks are left standing, and are eaten down by cattle. The outturn of millet is said to be one hundredfold, and a man of seed to produce 100 man of grain. This represents about 15 maunds (Indian) per acre, and such yields our measure ments show to be made, but not commonly. Yields of 12 Indian maunds, however, we find to be frequent; so that the yield of millet in normal years in Seistan is about 80 times the seed sown. In 1904 millet suffered in places at the tail ends of canals from deficient watering at the maturing season. Great damage was done also by a plague of mice which overran all Seistan that year. Maize. Maize locally known as juwdri is but little grown in Persian Seistan. Its unpopularity is said to be due to the fact Maize (Zea mays). that it needs more labour in cultivation, as weeding is required to produce a good yield. Moreover the cobs are small and have few grains on them, and the flour has to be ground twice to make it fine enough for bread-making. Maize is sown in March with the other autumn crops, or in June or July when Mash is sown. It ripens in two months. About eight Indian seers are sown to the acre, and the cultivation is done in the usual manner. The young plants appear in eight days, and when tall enough the field is weeded. They are then watered and two or three waterings are required before the crop matures. In the statements the maize is included in the figures fer millet. Cotton. Cotton is locally known as kdlak. Ancient historians have remarked on the large number of weavers in Seistan. Cotton (Gossypium negiectum). same remark is still applicable to the country. Not only are there many men in Seistan who live by weaving only, and do no cultivation, but also the cultivators, the cattle and flock-owners, and the Saiyads, who live by netting fish and duck ; all employ their leisure time in the days of summer in weaving coarse cotton cloth. In every Seistani village will be seen 10, or even as many as 40, places made for men to sit and work looms. The cotton used is, as a rule, grown in the country, though in some years, raw cotton has to be imported from Kain or Farah (see Chapter XLIV). Cotton does best in the Miankangf district where the land has only re cently been reclaimed from the floods, and the soil is very fertile, and where also the surrounding tamarisk jungle shelters the cotton crop from the strong Seis tan wind. The area devoted to cotton in Persian Seistan in 1904 was as follows :— On the Rud-i-Seistan In the Miankangi Acres. 1,837 3&gt;°93 Total 4 93 o and the estimated actual was respectively 7,350 and 18,606 Indian maunds, or a total of 25,956 maunds. These areas represent in the case of the Riid-i-Seistan lands 16 per cent, and in the case of Miankangf 34^ per cent, of the autumn crop cultivation in each tract respectively. Cotton sowings are made at the end of March and continued till the end of Mav, but early sown seed does much better than that sown later, as the young plants have time to grow stronger, and are better able than later sown plants to resist the strong winds which usually commence to blow at the end of May. R6 4 [Chap. X. For early sowings, seed is sown at the rate* of 12 to 15 Indian seers per acre ; whilst for the later sowings some 24 to 45 seers have to be sown to the acre to allow for the loss of seed through parching in the hot sun. To as certain the acreage of cotton sown 24 Indian seers an acre on the average is the best figure to take. The seed is sown broadcast in the usual way of sowing seed tn this country ; the plants come up in about four days and are watered about twenty days after coming up. They mature with two or three waterings after sow ing. The last waterings are made at the end of August or early in September. The cotton is ready to pick about the end of August, but some pickings are not made till November or December. As a rule, only one picking is made, so that thefts may be the more easily prevented. About 20 persons, usually women and children, are required to pick an acre of cotton. If hired labour is employed for picking, a wage of 5 per cent, of the cotton picked is paid. The cotton is picked in the husk, and the figures of outturn given below are for cot ton in the husk. Seistani cotton, as picked with the husk, produces about one- fifth of its own weight of fibre as compared with the one-fourth or one-third usual in the Punjab. In good years cotton in the Miankangx yields! from 8 to 10 Indian maunds per acre and on the Rudd-Seistan from 6 to 8 maunds. The normal outturn of picked cotton is therefore about 10 times the seed sown. The Seistan cotton plant is only some 12 to 18 inches high. This is doubtless a case of the survival of the fittest, as a dw 7 arf plant must have a better chance of escaping damage from the strong hot dry winds than a tall plant like the Indian cotton. Autumn Crop Lentils, Mdk is a species of Lentil, and said to be the same as the Rewan of the mbWigna eating). P un j a b. and the lubia of the United Provinces. It is sown in March in the millet and melon fields, and the beans are either eaten green, or after they have ripened and dried. This mixed cultivation of and millet is locally called gadwad (mixed). If sown as a crop by itself about 6 seers Indian of seed are sown to the acre, and the crop is gathered in two or three pickings, usually by the cultivators themselves without employment of hired labour. If hired labour is employed they get 5 per cent, of the bean pods collected by them. Mash is a pulse or Lentil known in the Punjab as dalmung. It is sow r n Mash (Phaseoiu&amp;mungd), broadcast in June or July, after the cut- . ting of the spring crops ; about 6 seers Indian are sown to the acre. In irrigated lands the crop springs up in about a week, and about 20 to 25 days after sowung receives its first water- mu’ ^, W j 0 water ^ n g s generally suffice. When ripe it is pulled up by the roots. The yield on good lands is about 6 to 10 maunds (Indian) per acre; and the divisible produce in normal years is about 47 times the seed sown. Hired labourers employed get 4 to 5 per cent, of the Mash pulled up by them. The crop is thrashed to extract the grain, and the dried stalks are prized as camel fodder for which it fetches about 1 krdn per sack {juwal) as compared with 1 hr an for four sacKS of barley straw. Mash is largely sown on lands along the banks of rivers where the receding spring floods have deposited fresh silt, and which are not left dry early enough for melon or millet cultivation, but which yield rich crops of Mash. Such lands are known as mdshi {vide page 18, Chapter II). In 1904, 372 acres on the Rud-i-Seistan, and 571 acres in the Midnkangf or a total of 943 acres in Persian Seistan were under Mdsk crop ; the total vield was computed at 5)7°5 Indian maunds. ’ ^ 7 il&gt; sesame or gingelly.

T\\ is^cultivated to little^ purpose except in the Sihkuhaand Warmal villages and in Miankangi, where a yield of 10 to 12 Indian maunds per acre is obtained on good lands ; in a good year an average yield of 5 to 6 maunds per acre of the total cultivation can be obtained ; til is a very valuable crop, and in normal years the seed is returned about 30 times in the divisible produce. The seed is sold in the city, and crushed for oil which is used not for food but for illumination. The oilcake is given to cattle, but is not so nourishing as cotton cake. The small millet. China is locally known as arzan and is only sown once in the year, i.e., in China early March, not twice as in the Punjab. About 3 to 4 seers Indian are sown (broadcast) to the acre. It is but little cultivated, but is more so in years of scarcity, as a small quantity of seed produces a good quantity of food at a critical time. Though treated in this chapter as an autumn crop, in Seistan it is considered a spring crop, as it is harvested and threshed at the kharman (thrashing floor) with the wheat and barley crop, and the Government share of it is taken at the same time as the wheat and barley revenue share. Tobacco (Nicutiana tubacum). Tobacco. A small area of tobacco [tambdku) is grown in most villages. The tnhwil ploughs (Chapter XI) of the kadkhuda usually plant a patch or field of tobacco in common, while the ghami ploughs of the cultivators do the same. There are seldom more than these two fields in each village. The field is situated near the homestead and is protected by a low wall, and is therefore called bdglncha. Tobacco will not grow well in a garden where there are trees. The land is carefully prepared in much the same way as in the Punjab, and the seedlings* are put out in March, and protected from frosts by a covering of kirta grass. The plants are carefully watered at intervals by little water channels {juak) between the beds. The small lower leaves of the plant called yarak are carefully removed, so that the strength of the plant may go into the larger leaves. The flowers are removed, and thrown away as soon as they appear. Three cuttings of leaves are taken from the same plant, but the first is the most valuable. The leaves are laid out in the fields to dry in the sun and are stored for use, and are kept dry unless they are for sale in which case some moisture is added to give them weight. The stalks are given to the poor. In good years tobacco will yield about 1 7 to 18 Indian maunds per acre. In 1904, which was a very bad year, our measurements show that only some 8| Indian maunds per acre were obtained ; in normal years the outturn is about 12 Indian maunds an acre. A village-to-village enquiry gives the following figures for 1904 District. Approximate area under cultivation. Approximate yield. ♦ Government revenue. Rud-i-Seistan ... Miankangi ...

X. Carrots and turnips. Carrots {Zardalz) are sown in many villages and are of good size and flavour. „ Sowings begin in early June, but the cor- Carrots ^ ]uly , 5 , h _ Xhey are fit to eat in November. Revenue is levied on them in cash at the rate of one-fourth of the value of the crop as assessed by the Sar Mushrif or his deputy. Seed carrots are specially treated. They are selected from the other carrots when they are dug out of the ground ; most of the root and leaves are removed, leaving only an inch or so of the crown, and 2 inches of the root; these are buried in a pit for some two to three months, until Nauruz (March 21st), when they are planted out along trenches near the banks of the field water-course. . They ripen and produce seed about the middle of May. Seed thus obtained is called tukhm sar and is considered much better than seed got from a carrot left to go to seed in the field, which is called tukhm-i-khud-ru by Seistanis and isoarud by Baluchis. Very good turnips (Shalgham) are grown in most villages. Sowings are „ . x made in July, in the usual way, from [Brassicanpa). i i ir i J e i one-and-a-halt to two seers Indian of seed being used to the acre. The young plants come up in five or six days, but the first watering is postponed until the leaves show signs of withering up, as it is said that watering before that stage produces smaller turnips. The turnips mature after two or three waterings in November and December. Some are said to weigh as much as 20 lbs., but the average size is a little bigger than a man’s fist. Revenue is levied on them in cash at the rate of one-quarter the value of the crop as assessed by the Sar Mushrif. As in the case of carrots special measures are taken in growing turnips for seed. After being dug up and the leaves removed, the root is cut in half and planted on the canal bank. The seed appears at the end of April and is called tukhm-i-sar-i-shalgham. Self-grown seed is called tukhm lashi. Gardens. There are two forms of so-called gardens in Persian Bagh and baghicha. beistan. Besides the ordinary garden with fruit trees, etc., which is called a hagh, there are bdghicha, which are nothing but ordinary lands in the immediate vicinity of a village, surrounded by a low mud wall to prevent the ingress of cattle. In the latter barley, wheat, melons and tobacco are grown, and these need not here be further considered. Although all lands in Persian Seistan are the property of the State, and no Owner of a garden cannot be di S pos,e SJ ed. 0,16 haS P r0 P rietar y Or Culti- vating rights in them, a curious excep tion to this rule exists in the matter of gardens, whether bdgh or bdghicha. Whoever builds the surrounding wall, which makes a plot of land come under either of the above heads, has an acknowledged right to occupy that land year after year without its being liable to redistribution among the village community like other lands. Should the owner be dispossessed of it, the new occupant has to pay compensation for the cost of the walls and trees. One might imagine that these privileges attaching to gardens would induce many to make gardens, and that these would become numerous. Such, however, is not the case for reasons which will be explained. The Government revenue supposed to be levied on a garden is one-fourth of the value of the produce in cash. If Method Of assessing revenue. an y crops _ are grown in a garden, their 1 . t revenue is included in the cash assessment on the garden. This is assessed after inspection by an assessor, arrdz. In addition to this revenue the owner pays sin rim to the assessor for his trouble, half of which goes to the assessor and half to Government. The assessor also has tho right to be supplied with fruit while he is in the village, and his assistant can also get fruit gratis.

X.] 67 address, is more exposed to attack by revenue harpies than his brother culti vator who, if bulbed too much, abandons agriculture for cattle or flock owning daily labour or thieving according to his means and proclivities ; advantage is taken of this to squeeze the hopeless owner of a garden. Thus only influential men, or those who hold^ land revenue-free, or cultivators who are protected by influential men, find it worth their while to enjoy the luxury of possessino - a gaiden. The assessments are now made with great severity and oreat complaints arise from it. Gardens are being neglected by all but the more influential men. Thus we find the number of real gardens bdgh very limited, and they Number, area and total assessment on gardens. are chiefly restricted to the larger and more important villages such as Bunjar, Iskil, -hahr-i-Seistan (Nasratabad), Sihkuha, Warmal, Aliabad, etc. A careful enumeration and measurement of gardens has been made, and the number of fruit gardens in a village has been entered in column 23 of State- ments A and B from which we get the following figures for 1904 :— District. Number of gardens. Revenue cash assessment for 1904. Shirini. Total. Area, Rtid-i-Seistan 452 4,901 krdn 636 krdn 5&gt;537 krdn 283 acres.

The incidence of taxation* works out to about 20 krdn per acre. This may not appear ruinously high, but in Seistan money is very scarce and the sale proceeds of fruit and garden produce are so little that the ordinary cultivator finds 20 krdn per acre a very difficult assessment to meet. Fruit gardens [bdgh) are enclosed by walls of sun-dried bricks 6 to 8 feet . General description of a garden. ^ wlth a frin g e ° f “ ^r ” thorns GO f°P to discourage trespass. A small low opening in one of the walls is closed by a door of mulberry, willow, or f&gt;adag wood, fastened by an ingenious wooden lock made by the village carpenter out of a block of mulberry or pomegranate wood at the cost of about a krdn. The area of the garden varies from one-quarter to one acre, the average being five- eighths of an acre, but gardens of the more influential men sometimes^cover as much as 3 acres of land. These gardens present a very untidv aspect and no care ever seems to be devoted to their appearance. One sees a number of fruit trees standing in a tangle of camel thorns, weeds or high coarse grass with perhaps a small patch of poppies or vegetable cultivation. The vines are sunk in deep ditches and the whole place looks like an uncared for deserted bit of jungle. Some little care, however, is bestowed on the pruning of vines and fruit trees. Vines apricots, pomegranates, plums [cilu bokhnrci), cdmonds, greengages and t Figs suffer much from tb. wind. a PP! es f&lt; ? rm the principal contents ’of a garden with an occasional mulberry or figf tree. The quality of the fruit is poor with the exception of the grapes which are often very good. Although gardens are usually kept for supplying fruit for home t About 12 lbs, weight for a krdn. consumption, fairly large quantities of grapes are obtainable by purchase at a cheap ratej: during the months of July, August and half September. The varieties and the qualities of the grapes grown are described in Appendix 16A by Mr. Terence Keyes, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice Consul in Seistan. * After this chapter was written opportunity was taken to measure in the villages mentioned above 16 gardens belonging to influential people, whom the Arraz would probably assess correctly.

But if all the gardens in Seistan were measured it is believed, from what we know of the gardens, that the figures in the letter press would prove to be moreCHAPTER XI. CONTENTS.

A village {Deh) and its community is the administrative and executive The Jan, and Deh. unit , of Pe^ian Seistan. It may be defined as the land and people who come within the charge of a Kadkhuda. Such charge is called a Jam* and may be a portion only of a very large village } one whole village, or a group of small villages. The Kadkhuda is appointed by the Governor. He need not have any The Kadkhuda. previous connection, tribal or otherwise, with the village and his appointment is, as a rule, solely dependent on the amount he is able to give the Governor for it. This present is known as There are, however, men who, owing to their ^ influence and importance, may be said to be permanent/WMaz&amp;z of certain villages. Wherever possible the land revenue of the jam is annually leased Contract o, (*&gt;&gt;&lt;?) to the kadkhuda who, as ijaradar, becomes solely responsible for the collec tion of the village revenue and the payment of the amount of the ijdra to the Governor through the tahwilddr. In this case he appoints his own mushrifi and takes his own steps for the watching of crops, etc., which are described below. Usually the responsibility of the revenue farmer ends when he has deposited the grain with the tahwilddr. The tahwilddr then sells the grain, usually when the demand for seed to sow arrives, which coincides with the time Kafila come from Kain to buy. The Governor is by this arrangement dependent on his tahwilddr iox a faithful account of the sum realised for the grain : to safeguard his interests he often sells all the grain to the ijdraddr&gt; at some rate the result of bargaining that goes on during the period of harvest. Private letters from Seistan say that this year the Muffatish has said that all the revenue farmers are to purchase the grain at a rate to be fixed by the Wali of Meshed, who delays to say what the rate is to be. Meanwhile the price of grain is rising rapidly, and the wretched ijdraddr are kept in suspense as to what sum in cash will be eventually demanded from them. The Kadkhuda ) if not just freshly appointed, has at the commencement of The Kadkhuda’s action at silt clearances and the agricultural year, Z.£., JUSt before the canal construction. autumn crop sowing, to take the necessary steps to renew his tenure of office by requisite payments {shirini) to the Gover nor. His position thus temporarily secured for another year ; his first thought is the condition of the irrigation system of his jam. The canals of the preceding year may be still in good working order, but the chances are that they need clearing out of silt and repairs—a task which is entrusted to an official appointed by the kadkhuda called pdkdr^ whom we would call a water bailiff. It, however, often happens that changes in the river, or other reasons, necessitate a new canal; or again the land which it is proposed to cultivate may not previously have been cultivated and therefore requires a fresh canal. The right to make a new canal must be obtained from the Governor and for this a cash present called shirini% (sweetmeat) is demanded. The amount varies with the importance of the canal. Sarnasaki. —Before proceeding with either clearing out and repairing exist ing canals, or the making of a new canal, the kadkhuda first divides out the land of his jam. This division takes place annually and is known * In Miankangl a Jam is called Nasak. f This means sweetmeat, and there are numerous forms of the pecuniary equivalent, as will be seen throughout this report. % The custom now prevails in Seistan to demand Shirtni, whether a new canal is made or not.[Chap. XI. * if' as sarnasaki* He first appropriates the lands he wishes ^ to cul tivate himself, then allots limited portions of land to his relations and friends, if any, and finally distributes the balance of land among those cultivators who have applied for cultivation plots. To understand the details of this system of agriculture it is necessary to grasp the intricacies of the Seistan plough on which the whole revenue and labour system of the country depends. A plough with its pair of bullocks is called a/&amp;//or (pro nounced locally as pdo gdo), the latter term The polugh. being the one in most common use. There are three kinds of ploughs :— (1) Tahwfl (also called begham), (2) Pagavi (also called ghami and jami). ( 3 ) Kalgld. The tahwil ploughs are those which cultivate the lands of the kcidhhuda\ the workers are exempt from general forced raW * labour, but are liable to do work for the kadkhuda. The number of tahml ploughs in a jam depends on the power and importance of the kadkhuda, but they are in any case limited, and do not exceed the proportion of 1 tahml to evtry 6 pdgdvi ploughs. If a kadkhuda wishes to further increase his own share of the village cultivation, he obtains a share as sleeping partner (locally called hissa-i-mard-i-murda) in the ordinary ghami pdgdvi ploughs. The pdgdvi, or ghami, or /aw* plough is that of the ordinary cultivator, , who is liable to forced labour of all kinds, G '“”“ p, °' sh ; Gham (sorrow) is the word used locally for forced labour ; it is also used for taxes. Jami means the usual or ordinary plough. The kalgiri Kalgiri. is the cultivation done by the privileged relations or friends of the kadkhuda ; these are also exempt from forced labour. They are only given land sufficient for sowing 20 to 30 Seistan man of wheat or barley, ie. y some two and-a-half to three and-a-half acres, and comprise only one man each, called kalgirkdr. Kalglrkar are only allowed in the portion of 1 to about 10 pdgdm ploughs. Kalgir means landholder. Kalgirkar borrows or hires a plough, and cultivates the above land himself the assistance of his son or a hired labourer. pro- The with The plough syndicate. Every plough represents a small community or syndicate of men, who arrange to work together for the season. Their duties and emoluments are laid down by custom. Should the syndicate not be able to supply their own seed, they obtain it from some one or other who becomes their bdddr.'\ He does not share in the labour of the plough, but does so in the profits; for these please see the Statements at the end of the next chapter. When there is a bdddr the members of the syndicate are called basgar, but when they supply their own seed they are called kishtgar. Sometimes a member obtains Jiis requisite share of seed from another member of the same plough who thus regards him as his bdddr. A bdddr has also to supply the iron for the chief implements of cultivation, x.e., the mattock (tcsha),etc. He also supplies the cloth in which the corn is carried from the field to the threshing floor known as saruk. ® Nasak means arrangement or organization ; a similar word to the Indian bandobast. The sowing time of wheat is often spoken of as roakt-i-nasak, or the time at which the arrangement for distributing land is made. f Kadkhuda, a landlord (literally the master of the house). Bdddr, a master, the chief man of the plough. In Mesopotamia the man who supplies the seed is called Malik. Kishtgar, a cultivator ; from Kishtan to till, to sow • Bazgar or Bazrgar, a sower ; from Bazr, seed. ’ ’ Kadkhuda, Bdddr, Kishtgar and Bazgar are collect! ve nouns and may be used either in the singular cr the Very few nouns in modern Persian are given a plural termination. The plural in an for persons or ha farthings used in Indian Persian is not much used in modern Persian ; the plural in an is almost obsolete (i) and that in ha . , . ’ 8 generally used for persons as well as for things Thi« pote is due to Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh, Political Attache to the Mission. 2 * plural (i’i VXie Modern Persian Colloquial Grammar, by Dr. Fritz Rosen. Luzac &amp; Co., 1898. )7 1 Chap. XL] He also has to pay the basgar a cash payment, it is said, in consideration for his labour on the band. This payment is called kaushai ) and amounts to any thing up to seven kran for the whole year. It varies with the distance of the village from the band, hence its name, which is said by the people to be a corrup tion of kafsh (shoe). In the case of a plough oi a. kadkhuda {tahwil) he himself is of course the bdddr and the six members of the plough are all bazgar. A pdgdvi syndicate consists of 6 men, made up usually of ^ or 4 kishtgar and 3 or 2 bazgar. In the Shib-i-Ab Mahal there is a plough, called pagavi, which has 8 men. It is only found on lands situated on canals towards the tail of the Rud-i-Seistan which get their water late. The extra men enable two ploughs to be worked, and more land ploughed quickly ; while being only calculated as one plough, the syndicate only supplies the same amount of forced labour as other ploughs. The ploughs of the kadkhuda in such cases are called tdhw'il pdgdvi juft gdo. Statement M shows the area of wheat and barley cultivated by all ploughs in Persian Seistan, from which it appears that the total cultivation done i^ thus distributed— Tahwil ploughs ... Per cent. ... Ill Ordinary ploughs ... 723 Kalgiri ploughs ... ... 28 Pdgdvi juft gdo {ghami) ... 8-3 Tdkwil pdgdvi juft gdo 5'4 As already said above, the two latter are only found in the Shib-i-Ab. The ghami cultivation is 80 per cent, of the whole. The wheat and barley is the cultivation on which the people make all their calculations about the ploughs. The autumn crop cultivation is seldom or never referred to in any of the general facts and figures about ploughs that are current among agriculturists. The plough syndicate select a headman, called sdldr, who represents the brains of the syndicate, and does the lighter duties of the plough, such as turning the water on to the plough land and looking after the plough cattle. He is seldom called upon to work at the plough or to work with other forced labour at the band, but should he have to do so, his duties are restricted to cooking the food for the others. The sdldr has to supply the wood for the woodwork of the plough. The bazgar supply the iron for the shoeing of the ploughshare (nuydd), and the iron band {alghd) which fastens the miydd to the plough. One of the party is told off to work the plough and is called gaoran. Another sows the seed and the rest clear the bushes off the land ahead of the plough. The annual distribution of the lands for cultivation. Having formed the above syndicate their first duty is to obtain a plot of land for cultivation. This necessitates the payment of a cash present to the Kad khuda, called Pul-i-Sarnasaki, or simply SarnasaU, which varies in value in different villages according to the quality of the land and the power of the kadkhuda to turn the cultivator out of the village. In the old established villages near the City Pul-i-Sarnasaki is seldom paid, but in villages along the Rud-i-Seistan, or in the new cultivation of the Miankangf from 30 to 50 are paid each year at this season. The land allotted by the kadkhuda to the pdgdvi ploughs is now divided among those ploughs which by payment of sarnasaki have secured plough plots. The kadkhuda would like to do this division himself, and by dividing the best lands from the bad and indifferent lands, and by making each pdgdo plot separate, compel the ploughs to pay more for the better qualities of land. This, however, has been frustrated by custom, which in ail cases of difference of opinion compels C639FD L72 [Chap. XI. distribution by lot# The result of this is that the land assigned to each plough depends not on selection but on chance, and in most cases, moreover, consists of a number of separate small patches of different qualities of soil, thus ensuring equality among fiagao. In cases of small tracts of land of exceptional value, such as land just cleared by wind of a travelling sandhill or barchan, care ful measurement is sometimes necessary in dividing it between ploughs, and for this a measure called gam (pace) two and three-quarter feet long is employed, and small fields of only one-tenth to one-twentieth of an acre are measured out. In ordinary lands, fields are from one-half to one acre in area, i.e., such as can be ploughed in one winter or autumn day. Each patch of land (in Persian bakhsh ; in Baluchi bar) assigned to a plough as its plot or part of its total plot is marked off from adjacent patches belonging to other ploughs by burj bakhsh, i.e., by leaving an unploughed spacef of 6 inches round each patch. Each plough chooses some distinctive mark by which during that season its lands are distinguished from those of other ploughs. These are of many kinds, of which the names and characteristics are fully given in the statement at the end of this chapter. Division of labour. The plough syndicate very seldom possess plough cattle of their own and therefore arrangements have to be made The plough cattle. ^ hire plough cattle from the cattle- owners (called gdoddr) of the Naizdr for ploughing and again for threshing. Payment for these (called gardani) is made in gram at the threshing floor, as will be described hereafter. As a rule, it amounts to 30 per cent, of the seed sown on the land ploughed by the bullocks in the spring crop, and in the autumn crop a share of the net produce after the expenses of cultivation and the Govern ment demands have been disposed of. In the case of melons this share amounts to about one-eighth and in other autumn crops to about one-tenth of the net pro duce. Unless the cattle-owner happens to live in the village in question, the cattle are left with the plough syndicate and are kept at the house of the sdldr and tended by the kishtgar and bazgar. If lost it is the duty of the sdldr to search for them. If not found, or if they die, the owner, and not the hirer, bears the loss. The feeding of the cattle while hired is a matter of arrangement between owners and hirers and the custom varies throughout the country. The cost is usually nicely distributed over the owner, the bdddr or kishtgar, who supplies the seed for sowing, and the cultivators who labour at the plough. Should any member of the syndicate own the necessary cattle, he hires them out on the same terms. The village blacksmith {ahangar) and carpenter (najjdr) are called upon _ 4 ... , to make the spades, ploughshares and other implements for which the baddr and bazgar supply the materials. Their wages are paid in grain at the threshing floor, as will be described further on. We must return for the moment to the kadkhuda who has now distribut- _ . . , ed the lands of his jam to the various tanwil, katgin and pagam ploughs. He now knows how much labour he has at his disposal. The tahwtl bazgar he sets to work on his own lands, the kalgirkdr are exempt, but the kishtgar and bazgar of the pdgdvi ploughs are available for whatever has to be done. •Lot (Persian beja and Baluchi ^V) are sheep droppings (/&gt;isAAr 7 ) ; they are marked to represent the parties concerned and drawn from a hat {kula) against each patch of land. f It is interesting to note the similarity between this lystem of dividing lands by lot, and of having unploughed strips between fields, and that which prevailed from the earliest times in England until recently. At the end of the eighteenth ctntnxy the custom in 4,000 parishes in England was that each man’s field was a day’s ploughing, and was called his “ yard land. ” It was measured out by the goad used for driving the-plough bullocks • hence the present measure “ rod. ' The unploughed strips were called lynches, linces or links. (See “ Seebohm’s Village Communities.”)r &gt;• 1/ 74 74 [Chap. XI.

This and the manner of watering has already been described for each principal crop in Chapter X.

Division of the profits. Now also come the first of the many demands made on the crop itself. Government has a right to one-third of the green crop in the same way Green crop grazing. prepared of the dates on which various villages will be thus visited*. The kadkhuda distributes the amount of green clop g 7 r«'r/ to be taken among the ploughs. This custom leads to much abuse and is very unpopular. , . . • Any of the Government share of green barley not consumed on the s P ot ^ taken d the City and sold. Green wheat being said to be unwholesome for horses and mules, a flock of Government sheep, some 500 to 6oo m num er, g round from village to village to eat the Government share of that crop. ^ The kadkhuda also exacts his share which by custom is fixed at the ng ^ to cut for the feed of animals on an area of green bar ey sown by 5 to 6 Seistaa . man of seed (say half to one acre) of the lands of each plough. The cultivators themselves get a little profit off the green crop by inng out their share of the green crop grazing at the following rates Per camel at 15 itran a month. „ horse j, 9 ' » » n donkey,, 2 „ „ „ head of cattle at 4 kran a month. ,, 4 sheep j&gt; 1 &gt;&gt; »&gt; It is doubtless partly this demand for green fodder in the depth of winter which makes the cultivators expend so much seed per acre in all their sowings of barley and in their later sowings of wheat (page 57 Chapter XJ.75 Chap. XL] As soon as the crop, wheat or barley, begins to ripen the Mushnf (crop watcher) appears on the scene. He is, as a rule, a Sarbaz (infantry soldier) of the military garrison and is appointed by the Sar Mushrif. He receives a house to himself in the village and the Mashkdr takes up his residence with him and attends to his personal wants. It depends on the size of the village, whether one or more Mushrif are appointed. Generally there is one Mushrif to evexy 10 ploughs of cultivation. His duty is to guard the crops in the interests of the Government share of revenue. He sees that neither the green nor ripe corn is stolen, and that the corn when cut is taken to the proper stacks at the threshing floor. His duties at the threshing floor are described in the following pages of this chapter. He receives pay from Government as Mushrif, whether a Sarbdz* or not at the rate of 50 to 100 Seistan man cf grain as may be agreed upon. Government reimburses this expenditure by levying a payment of 5 Seistdn man of wheat, 30 melons and a small allowance from other crops per plough. The Mushrif \s fed by the cultivator throughout his stay, which lasts from the ripening of the spring crop to the harvesting of the autumn crop and the disposal of Government revenue grain from the threshing floors, i.e., from March till November or even December. Each plough takes it in turn to prepare his food. In some villages the bdddr and kishtgar supply ail his meals, but in others the expense is divided between the bdddr and bazgar. If the bdddr feeds the Mushrif, he takes a half or a third of the chungi, vide next page. The mashkdr arranges the turns in which each plough is to feed the Mushrif, and he himself subsists on the leavings. The cultivator thus feeds both men. The men of the ploughs also take it in turns to guard his house. The following is the customary diet provided for the Mushrif, In the morning some bread and curds. At noon a cake fried in ghi&gt; This cake has to have incisions and crenulations to enable it to absorb more ghi than the ordinary plain cake. At night meat is given with his bread and one Seistani sir of tobacco is provided, which is shared by such cultivators as come to sit and talk with him. If he has a horse or donkey it receives 20 to 30 Seistani sir of grain and a sack of grass per diem. The munificence of the Mushrifs fare is best accounted for by the several ways hereafter described in which a well fed and contented official can profit the culti vators by shutting his eyes at the right time. Sometimes the cultivators agree to pay cash instead of feeding the Mushrif, and in this case 2 or 3 kran are levied per cultivator for the season. It will be seen that the Mushrif is a troublesome and expensive luxury. He gets some further illicit profit in his leisure hours by exacting cattle-pound fines (pul-i-kharaba) on animals found trespassing in the crops. The usual fine is 2 kran per horse or cow and 1 kran per sheep or goat. These fines should be paid to the Sar Mushrif, but this is seldom done. When the revenue is given out on contract {ijdra) the ijdradar makes his own arrangements for appointing mashkdr and mushrif. Revenue is leased whenever possible and generally to the kadkhuda. As the kadkhuda is then practically his own mushrif the official he appoints, nominally, as such is not of such importance as the Government mushrif, and he gets none of the pay, or food and other perquisites of that privileged person. It would appear that every precaution has been made to guard the crop; but it will now be seen how Seistani customs have arranged for its diminution before the threshing floor is reached. Doles from the corn before threshing. (1) First come Pahlavi. The name pahlavi implies green corn sufficiently ripe for the ears to be parched and eaten. It has always been the custom in Seistan at harvest time to allow * The pay of a Sarbaz as a soldier is 50 hran worth of grain per annum. C639FD TJ?6 [Chap. XI. each cultivator and each hired labourer^ a handful of ears of corn to parch each day as long as there is any green corn. Each labourer’s pahlavi yields about 2 to 5 sir (Seistani) of grain and each cultivator’s about 10 sir. The Governor of Seistan has tried to stop this custom, but where the Government itself collects the revenue pahlavi is still taken should the Mushnf prove accommodating. That he often is so, is proved by the number of wisps of cornstalks tied into little bundles as thick as an ordinary man’s w ? rist with the ears parched off that one sees lying about everywhere at harvest time. Calculating pahlavi for 6 cultivators for 10 days at 10 sir and 5 labourers for 5 days at 5 sir, we find at least 10 Seistan man per plough is thus consumed. Another form of pahlavi is strictly enforced and observed, i.e., the cultivators of each plough give the kadkhuda a contribution of 2 man Seistani of green corn, or if none is available, the same quantity of fully ripe corn. Parched corn not consumed at harvest time is kept till winter, coarsely ground and made into porridge. (2) Chungi. The time has arrived for cutting the grain crop. The cultivators themselves, i.e. t the members of the plough syndicate, all set to work to cut it, and, as a rule, a few labourers (daraugar) have also been engaged for this job. Each by custom,^ cultivator and labourer,! is entitled to {chungi) a bundle of corn per diem which is given from the crop under the supervision oi Mushrif. The chungi when threshed should yield half a Seistan man of grain (3 Indian seers), but the the quality of whose meals depends on the cuisines of the cultivators, often winks at more, and chungi at times may amount to one Seistan man per cultivator per diem. If in any plough the hdddr feeds the Mushrif, he gets half the chungi, but when the bdddr only pays half the cost of 'the food of the Muslim} he gets no share of the chungi. The harvest may be said to last 15 days and chungi may now be estimated to amount to 45 Seistan man per plough. In the autumn harvest chungi is only given in the case of millet. Where the area of millet is small, each man gets 10 heads of millet per diem j where the area is large, 20 heads. Each head of millet gives from one to one'and-a-half Seistani sir of grain. ^ Chungi used to be given in the case of cotton crops and was called Damani, and amounted to about 10 Seistani man of cotton per diem. (3) Kuldki. When the harvest has been cut the hired labourers are dismissed and the salar o\ the plough informs the kadkhuda, who arranges with the Mushrif the order in which he will supervise the gathering in of the corn of the different ploughs. Some time may elapse before permission is given to a plough to gather its crop, and during this time it lies about the fields subject to pilferin? and stealing, damage by wind, and no small loss from the ravages of birds and mice. &amp; At last the time comes and the plough cultivators jubilantly set to work to carry their harvest to the threshing floor (khatman). Each plough has its own kharman, but the kadkhuda decides on the spot at which all the kharman should be congregated so as to be easily watched. and barle r ^a 4 rv t est. men ^ ^ P, ° Ugh ’ aS &amp; rule ’ t0 aSSist at the raping and gathering of the wheat The usual rate paid to hired labour for cutting 1 corn is ^ ner cent of flop . r .t. . i addition to any the labourer may get.

XI ] 77 Hired labourers (huUk kash) have often to be again engaged for this. Each labourer gets as his wage a bundle of corn as large as a min can carry for each two days work. This bundle is called kulak and yields about a Seistani man of grain. ° £ ,, y h fv CU !! 1Vat u 0r of . the P Ioi ;g h the matter of carrying the harvest from the held to the threshing floor looks upon himself as working for Government and gets for this labour a kulak ^ man per day. Such kulak are, as a rule, threshed out at once, and if more than 3 Seistani man is obtained, the surplus is treated as an advance of gram to the cultivator from his future share of the harvest • if less than 3 man, the deficiency is made good on the spot. expended Mushrif also gets a kulak, thus 7 kulak per plough per diem are In addition to the above kulaki, the following persons also receive one kulak each when all the gram has been collected at the threshing floor, i.e.— Blacksmith (ahangar), Carpenter {najjdr), Barber (dalldk), Pdkdr, while the Mashkdr gets 5 handfuls of grain called Mbdht-i-Mashkdr equivalent to one oeistam man. In the autumn harvest no kulaki is given. When the corn has been Gleaning. collected into stacks, and not till then • . , 1 , , gleaners (khoshachi) are allowed to go into the fields and glean what they can. Not only the poorer people, but the wives and children of the cultivators, themselves engage in this occupation. Extra labourers are seldom engaged by a plough for the harvesting of Harvest labour for autumn crops.. autumn crops, as the members of the plough generally can do this themselves. ... labourers, if engaged for a millet {zurrat) crop, get 10 to 20 heads of millet ; for cotton 5 percent, of the cotton picked ; for mask 4 to 5 per cent.; for 5 P er cent M an d f° r rnelon 5 10 melons per day’s work, from morning to The harvest has been collected at the threshing floor and the plough syndi* Thrashing. cate now proceeds to arrange for hiring the cattle required for threshing {Tahpdi). These are hired, as in the case of ploughing, from the gdoddr. The work is done by contract and the hire of the cattle is called Ghalla-i-Tahpdi. The owner of the bullocks inspects the quantity of grain to be threshed and states the amount of grain he requires as payment. This is usually two and-one-half per cent, of the whole grain, i.e., one sir for each man threshed. If the quantity be small, cattle are sometimes hired at the rate of one Seistani man of grain per bullock per diem. v Some 9 to 12 animals are employed in treading out the grain linked together with one rope. The cattle and rope are called gdo. The Government exacts a tax (called mshta gdvi or rishta ghalla) of one The tax on bullocks employed on threshinf. kran per bullock thus employed 10 the threshing of wheat or barley. In the contract made for threshing it is decided whether the cattle-owner or the culti vator is to pay the tax, I he Saiar of each plough is held responsible by Government for the collection of it. If it is paid by the cattle-owner {gdoddr) the Saiar collects it in cash, and if by the cultivators, he takes it from them in grain at the time the grain is divided. If the Government revenue is leased, the ijdradar collects this tax from the Salars, but if the Government itself is collect ing the revenue of the village the Sar Mushrif collects it. . ^ he threshing cattle are not muzzled and eat about 60 Seistani man of grain in all during their 7 to 9 days’ work on the threshing floor. They are therefore not further fed by the cultivators. They work from sunrise to midday and after two hours’ rest till 4 or 5 P.M. In the autumn harvest the threshing to be done is little, and it is I’sual to hire the bullocks, of which only^ about 6 are then employed, at a daily wao- e of from one-half to a whole Seistani man of millet per bullock per diem.7 S [Chap. XL The grain and chaff after the threshing is done are piled into a heap called Precautions to guard the grain when threshed kkurdl and tne Muskrif p aCe ^ ^ out. seal (muhr) on it. This seal is made ot wood by the village carpenter. It is a thin piece of mulberry or padqjr wood either square or round, and from 3 to 4 inches wide on which some device is cut. To it a handle about one and-a-half feet long is attached. A new seal is made each year for each Mushrif. On the surface of the heap {khurdi) lumps of wet mud are placed at small intervals and the seal imprinted on each. When the time comes to start winnowing the Mushrif the seals on the heap, and the cleaned grain is each day piled into a heap and seals placed thereon in the evening which are carefully examined before the next day s work begins. When all the winnowing is finished, and the heaps carefully sealed, the Mushirf stts watchmen from among the cultivators to guard them until the Sar Mushrif comes to divide the produce of the ploughs. The remuneration given to the cultivators for the labour of threshing and winnowing is called khaki wa zung and Khaki wazung. j s gi ve n at the final division of the produce of theT&gt;lough. The manner of doing so may be described here. The grain lying next to the ground under the heap of threshed grain {rashci) is called khaki, as it contains some dirt. Such grain as remains in the chaff after the winnowing is called zung. It was formerly the custom to leave a Seistani kharwdr as khaki wa zung on the ground at the division of the • rasha, and this gave each cultivator about 15 man Seistani of grain each as khaki wa zung. Now-a-days in the case of an ydra no khaki wa zung is allowed to the cultivators by the ijdradar, but the bdddr, if any, of each plough gives each bazgar 8 to 10 man of grain. When Government collects the revenue, it is now usual to leave 30 man of grain as khaki wa zung on the ground when dividing the rasha. The bdddr takes one-third of this; the bazgar divides the rest. Sometimes the bdddr foregoes his third. Dividing the produce. After all the grain of the village has been threshed, winnowed and collected into heaps the Sar Mushrif puts in his appearance. Much delay may occur in his doing so, and it depends largely on his caprice. He may have a grudge against the village, or may wait until he is paid handsomely to cease further delay. Needless to say, the ploughs are anxious to receive their hard earned share of the produce as soon as possible, and have done for the season with the trouble of guarding the grain heaps and the expenses of feeding the Mushrif Mashkdr. The village officials, artisans and others, whose yearly maintenance comes in the form of grain at the time of divisions, are no less anxious to receive their dues. Great delay often occurs, however, and I have seen cases where the unfortunate cultivators after cutting their harvest in May have had to wait until the middle of December before the Sar Mushrif arrived to divide the produce. The day at last arrives when the lordly Sar Mushrif condescends to appear and the all-important work of division begins. The whole village goes to attend at the division of the grain ; it is a time of great excitement when the revenue arrangements for the year and the experiences of the harvest are frankly and freely discussed and described. The day is finished by a concert in the village, and the pleasant evening air is filled with the happy laughter of the cultivators. From the grain heaps {rasha) of each plough the following payments are first made:— To the Sar Mushrif* ... ,, Tahwllddr* ... i} Mushri)* „ Kadkhuda } , Band-baf f ... „ Kil-gardan% ,, Cultivators as Khaki wa zuna Total .. 30 Seistani man per plough. ... 30 &gt;&gt; » ... 5 )? &gt;&gt; .. 20 2 \ V ... 2 1 &gt; V !&gt; ••• 3 u » » &gt;• ... 3° v )&gt; » ... 120| n i) )&gt; * This grain is credited to Government and not taken by the individuals named. f These are the experts at weir building who direct the labour of annual construction of the Band-i-Seistin, who are called Band-bdf— mide Chapter XIV.

When the Government’s share of the grain of the village has been separated from the rest, it is handed over to the Gram pits. Tahwilddr by the Sar Mushrif. The Tahwilddr causes it to be buried in pits called Kurk or Kuragh which are made over to the custody of the kadkhuda. The latter appoints a storekeeper (Ambdrchi)* to look after the pits, and he guards the grain until it is removed, when he receives as payment 2J per cent., i.e., one sir in every man of grain removed. The pits are made and filled by the cultivators. They are shallow circular holes some 3 feet deep and 3 feet in diameter, and are generally sunk in some vacant high ground outside the village. Before being filled the pits are lined with chopped straw. The cost of carrying the Government grain from the threshing floor to the pits is paid out of the Government grain at the rate of one sir per man of grain = 2\ per cent. In the case of melons the cost of carriage is one melon in ten. * In small villages the Kadkhuda sometimes dispenses with an Ambdrchi and guards the grain himself Ambdr = a store, used similarly to the Anglo-Indian word godown.

The chief devices used to mark the fields are— Kharmanak —or the little stack of corn ; a small sugar loaf heap of earth. Cardan Shutar—the camel’s neck; a long mound of earth. Do Cham —a small mound of earth with a trench on either side. Sih Chavi —a small mound with a trench on three sides. Char Chavi —a small mound with a trench on all four sides. Par-i-Jalak —a mound in the shape of a four armed star. The jalak is the heavy piece of wood attached to the lower end of the spindle, also made of wood on which the wool yarn is wound, as it is spun by hand; thehas arms or wings, called par. Lash-i-Khar —the corpse of a donkey; a mound in the shape of a three arm star. Do Magak —a mound of three humps made by cutting two nicks or cuts in an ordinary mound so as to divide it into the humps. Juak —or the small canal, or water-course is a trench or nick in the ground. These mark'i are made with a few cuts of the tesha^ and they are very noticeable features in the wheat and the barley fields until the corn shoots up so as to hide them. The corn often extends over a wide tract without any banks or hedges to break the green expanse up into fields : these marks alone distinguish the cultivation of different ploughs from one another. * Kh5n Bahadur Mir Sham Shah estimates that the weight of wheat straw harvested in the form of bhusa is only half that of the grain, and of barley a quarter, while in India the yield of bhusa by weight is from one and a half to two times that of the yield of grain.umber If (lie . ... .CHAPTER XII.

The distribution of the outturn of the wheat and barley crop between Govern^ ment and the cultivators of the plough and others. It will now be instructive to work out the expenses incurred on the cultiva tion of the plough, the payment made from the crop before and after threshing, and the respective shares of Government and the members of the plough syndi cate. It will suffice* to deal with the wheat and barley crop, which has been shown to be by far the most important one in Seistan. To do this it is first necessary to calculate the average outturn of the seed sown in this country. The years in which our observations have been made are very unfortunate ones in this respect, as they were not years of agricultural prosperity. The crops of 1903-04 were exceptionally poor and the net\ outturn only amounted to from 2f to 8 times the seed sown, and as will be seen from Statement G was a little more than 6 times for the whole of the cultivation of Persian Seistan. The net outturn to be expected in poor years is 8 times and in normal years loj: times the seed sown. The best lands sown in good years produce from 15 to 20 times the seed sown, It would not be unreasonable to estimate the average gross outturn in normal years of all lands at, say, 11 times the amount of seed sown. This represents, as will be shown in the first note on the next page, a net outturn of 10 times the seed sown, the difference being the amount expended before division at the thrashing floor. The Statements at the end of this chapter are worked out at this figure for each kind of plough, and to allow of comparison between the respective incomes of Government and the plough in good or bad years, the figures of the ordinary plough (z.£., pdgdvi) in the case of a net outturn of only 6 times the seed sown have also been worked out. As stated on page 73 the amount of seed sown per plough is a fairly w r ell known quantity which does not fluctuate much and is at an average for each plough as follows Seistan man,% Tahwil plough—Beghami ,,, ... ... ... 550 Pdg&amp;m ,, —Charm ... • »* ... 440 Kalgir ,, *«« ... ... 27 Special plough of the Shib-i-Ab Mahal— Tahwil pdgdvi jupt gdo~~Begha.mi ... 714 Pdgavi juft -Ghami ... ... ... 575 Statement of the expenditure met by payments in sheaves of corn before the threshing is made.

This payment varies for wheat and for barley and with the abundance or scantiness of the harvest. * * * § * Some notes for working out the shares of the autumn crops will, however, be found in Appendix 12 . t Net is used throughout this chapter to denote the divisible quantity of grain that reaches the threshino- floor after the deductions referred to in this and in the last chapter have been made during the course of cultivation and harvesting. t The usual charge in Seistan for crops cut while green for forage is ten times the seed sown. § These figures differ a little from those in Statement M : they are rounded forms of figures worked out many ■months ago in Seistan.

Government revenue income from Persian Seistdn. All land in Persian Seistan is the property of the State. Land revenue in the case of crops is assessed at one-third* of the produce and, as a rule, is levied in kind. Revenue is also assessed in cash on gardens, on sheep, cattle and many other things, as will be described in detail later on in the Chapters of Part III. The lease of the Government revenues was granted in some year before 1872 to Mir ’Alam Khan, Governor of Seistan, and was based on the rough assessment then made by Mirza Muhammad Husain, a Mustaufi from Herat, of the revenue of the country, This assessment was arrived at in the following man ner. The whole of Persian Seistan was calculated to comprise 2,001 1 ploughs, and the average share of Government produce was assessed at 12 Tabriz khar- war pdgdo, a total of 24,012 Tabriz kharwar oi grdi\n ) oi which two- thirds were calculated to be wheat and one-third barley. Against this grain income was set off the grain allowances made to Sarddr, Saiyad, Mujtahid, Kadkhuda, officials, garrison and others by the Persian Government amounting to a total of 9,812 Tabriz kharwar. This is the budget provision for such allowances and has never been altered since ; any new allow ance sanctioned by the Central Government must come out of this provision, or be paid by the local Governor, or not paid at all. The Persian system of finance will be found lucidly and graphically described in the first volume of Lord Cur- zon’s “Persia,” Chapter XIV.§ The balance due to Government was thus 14,200 Tabriz kharwar t the cash value of which, calculated at 7 kran kharwar ) or 99,400 kran, or 9,940 tumdn t it was decided should be paid to Government each year by the Governor. In addition to this, he was made responsible for the annual payment of the revenue derived from the sources named in the following list, amounting to 2,600 ttiman :— Tumdn. Sheep tax {Sargalla) ... 800 Cattle „ [Gdo shumdrt) ... 1,200 „ „ {Rishta gavi) ... IOO Customs duties {Gumruk) ... ... 3 00 Shop taxes 50 Taxes on fish and duck netters [Saiydd) ... 150 Total ... 2,600 The Governor thus obtained the lease of the revenues of the country at 12,540 tumdn per annum, approximately ^2,280. These terms were renewed on the succession of Mir ’Alam Khan’s son, the present Governor, and no changes have since taken place in the assessment. Many attempts, however, have been made by the Governor-General of Khorasdn and the Persian Government to increase the cash value of the Government grain paid by the Governor. The Persian Government succeeded in raising the price to 17J kran per Tabriz kharwar a year or two ago, while the Governor- General of Khorasan has lately managed to extract|| 25 rank per Tabriz kharwar * * * § * As will have been noticed on page 84, Chapter XII, this third is assessed on the crop after deductions have been made to defray the grain allowances of certain officials. The share of grain thus foregone, as well as the cost of carriage and storage, can most conveniently be treated as an expense. As a matter of fact, the profit from the former practically covers the cost of the latter. + Falit&gt; melon fields, called by Afghans p&amp;lez. t See page 58 and page 5 o! the Report of Khan Bahadur Maul£ Bakhsh for his journey from Meshed to Quetta in 1898. § The intricacies and ramifications of Madakhal in Seistan called Shirini are also described. fl A Seist&amp;ni man equals 2 Tabriz man, so that this rate is 2 Seistdni man to the Kran.

It will now be useful to examine the revenue of the c01 ^. n ^ r J an ' see largely the revenue realised by Government Estimate of the revenue resources of the country. r Seistdn differs from the amount realised by the Governor from the country. The whole of the report up to this paragraph was written by Colonel McMahonf in Seistan without the aid ot The Revenue Statements. ^ S tatements noW lettered from A to R, which were only got out in their present form after two| months’ work at Simla. As the revenue resources of the country is to be gleaned from them, it will be as well to take them up and examine them and notice what information is to be got from each. The Seistdni does not keep his crop accounts in areas of land, but in quantities of seed sown and the number of times the seed was returned to him.^ Statements A and B show the seed sown for the year 1903-04 in the Rud-i-Seistan and Miankangf tract respectively, while Statement G gives the actual net outturn that may be expected in normal years. It has been necessary to bring in this column of normal outturn, because the year 1903-04 was so abnormally bad that the actual figures obtained therefrom were unsuited for making general deductions. A large part of the revenue is collected in contract {ijara) and the remainder by the Sat' Mushnf direct, locally called amdnl The information about the former is given in Statements G and E and that about the latter in Statements D and F for the Riid-i-Seistan and Miankangf tracts respectively. In Statements H, I, ], K have been collected the information obtained in the village to village enquiries of the revenue assignments, allowances, salaries, etc., paid^by the Governor against the budget allotment of 9,812_ Tabriz kharwar of grain which, as has already been explained, he is given for this purpose. It need hardly be said that it is difficult to obtain information on this subject j we did not go systematically to work to obtain complete information, but it was necessary to try and unravel the intricacies of the system of mu'afi, wazifa, etc., with the connected complications of shirini and return of presents. In doing this sufficient information has been collected to give an idea how much the Governnor has to pay out of his own resources § for the administration of the country. As the settlement w r as made more than 30 years ago and the country has greatly expanded since then, it is quite certain he must pay a good deal, because the Central Government will not depart from the original budget allotment so long as this settlement lasts. The Statements L, M, N and P contain statistics for determining agricul tural equivalents, and Statements Q and R are counts of people ; these do not concern the subj’ect of this Chapter. Statement O is an estimate of the resources of the country which only indirectly concerns this Chapter, but will be dealt with in Chapter XVI. We may now examine the Statements C and E showing the contracts to see The cost of the collection of the revenue from how much the collection of the revenue Statements C and E. COStS.

K In columns 3 and 4 of Statement I the grant, which is made from the Central Government, is distinguished from'that made by the Governor. This is how the people understand these grants to be made up. But the figures, though pbtained trom the best authority are of necessity vague and uncertain.Chap.

Owing to this difficulty in letting contracts the revenue of more villages than usual was collected direct {amdni). In normal years the revenue from fully two-thirds of the villages m the Riid-i-Seistan tract is collected in contract and practically all the Miankangf tract. contract Since the Governor usually collects the major portion of the revenue in contract, it may be inferred that the revenues collected direct do not all reach him and we may safely assume that the loss is much the same as that paid away as* profit to the contractors : from the footnote of the two Statements C and E it will e seen that there is reason to believe that the contractors expect to make 2^ per cent, in the newly established villages in out-of-the-way Miankangi, while they are probably content with 20 per cent, in the long-settled and comfortable villages of the Rud-i-Seistan ; and in estimating the value of the Government share of the produce to the Governor we may use these figures. There are two expenses which have not been taken into account, viz., the Cost of Sar Mushrif and Tahwiidar’s payand the Government share of the revenue not carnage and storage of grain. taken on ^ ^ ^ of wheat and bar]ey {vide pages 78 and 84), which is allowed for the pay of the Sar Mushrif,f Tahwil- dar and Mushrif, and the allowance of 5 per cent, for the storage and carriage of wheat and barley. But the allowance for the salaries of the officials is nearly all * In the Miankangi, where cotton and millet are even more largely grown, one would expect all contracts to require a quantity ot cotton and millet to be delivered ; but the revenue farmers are influential men, who are encourag ed to push on the cultivation by lenient contracts. t The pay of the Sar Mushrif and the Tahwildar is borne entirely by the Governor, i.e., the Central Govern- Blent makes no allowance.

XIII. pure profit as the pay of the officials is a quite insignificant par. of the grain recovered ; and wernay set this off against the carnage and storage expenses and ignore both in these calculations. We may now endeavour with the assistance of Statements H, I, ] and K to ascertain how much more than the The amount which the Governor has to pay from that he receives the his own resources for the administration of the budget allotment tnat ne receive* it country. Hashmat-ul-Mulk has now to expend on administering the country. Statement I gives all the allowances which are paid so far as they can be ascertained among the people. It will be noticed a large SUT ? or h ^ people are the Sarhaidar and the Karai regiment is only payable when these^eople are in Seistan; but as they have been there some time they are now pract.ca ly perma nent in the country; from what has been said at page 4 p is clear that the Hashmat-ul-Mulk can hope for no relief from this expense. A complication arises from the fact that the Central Government, as well as the local Governor, has found it convenient at various times to assign to certain influential individuals the whole or part of the revenue 0 a vi age in _ , grain allowance sanctioned to him. Probably at the time the grant was a fhe village was almost valueless, and the assignee has, as was intended, developed the property, till it is now much more valuable than the grain allowance in place of which he received the assignment. , In Statement T a list of these assignments, so far as they are known to us, has been given and the estimated normal value of the Government _ revenue of each has been compared with the grain allowance which the assignee is supposed to enjoy. It will be noticed from the totals at the end of Statement I that at the rates at which the valuation has been made (180 036—40 460) 139,570 more is assigned in revenue than the grain allowance (37 j 3 0 was worth : thus the assignees are receiving 37 per cent, more than they are entitled to. Not very much more considering all the circumstances of the case and speaks highly* for the Hashmat-ul-Mulk’s business ability. It may be remarked here that these allowances and the assignments given in lieu of them are very insecure ; so long as an individual retains his influence, e enjoys his allowance unmolested; but as his influence declines the Governor comes down on him for larger gifts as shirlni, or as pishkash (presents) and may eventually take his mu'afi or ivazifa away. In 1003, when the Governor was making his arrangements to wriggle out of going to Tehran, it was freely stated that all the mu'afi would be cancelled that year and not allowed again, but after much excitement and some struggling only some small reductions were made, but doubtless a large amount of shinni was paid in during the time of excitement due to uncertainty and doubt. It will be noticed from the totals allowances can be classed as follows at the end of the Statement I that the Kran. (i) Cash allowances ... ... ••• ••• 88,872 (ii) Paid by assignments of revenue ... ••• 37 bj 3 b° (iii) Grain allowances whose value fluctuates, but which valued at present prices are 462,436 Total 927,668 It will also be assumed for reasons to be given further on that the normal rate of grain on which the account should be worked out is four-fifths of that taken in these Statements. • The assignees are leading men, who would probably not have been content with the original gram allowances.Further on, when making the estimate of the value of the revenue to the Governor, the revenue of the assigned villages will be deducted from the Govern ment share of the produce and so item (ii) may be excluded from this total. We will then have the following account for the cost of administering the country:— Kran.

The rates on which the account should be Those used in Statements C and E are struck. high rates that ruled after a period of scarcity, but they are by no means the highest rates that the Governor receives for his produce, for in years of scarcity, when grain was exported to the neighbouring provinces of Persia, wheat has been as high as half a Seistani man a kran. In Statement O the annual resources of the country have also been valued at the rates that ruled in the years 1897 to 1900. These rates are by no means the lowest that have ruled, for in good years, when there- was no export from Seistan, wheat has been as cheap as 5 Seistani man a kran. In searching for a normalf rate we may notice that the Governor-General at Meshed has been able to exact a rate of 2+ Seistani man 3-kran, and this must be lower than the normal rate, or there would be no provision for the government of the country. A well- informed Persian official thinks that one and a quarter Seistan man§ of wheat a kran a normal rate on which to base an estimate of the Governor’s income. It may be assumed that the rates of all the produce of cultivation fluctuates in the same ratio as the price of wheat. The rates current in 1903-04 have this advantage that the price of wheat was 1 Seistan man a kran } _ and therefore the values of the produce for any other price of wheat can be easily calculated from the figures already worked out, * * * § * This should more properly be estimated at the rate of 40 Jcran 3.

System of Irrigation and Protective Works in Persian Seistan, Persian Seistan depends entirely on the water of the Helmand river for its The River Heimand. irrigation. This _ river is some 600 miles in length from its sources in the high mountainous tracts of the Hazarajat, and the country between Kandahar and Ghazni to Seistan. Its rise and fall depends on the rain and snowfall of those areas. The river is at its minimum after the long hot rainless summer in the middle or end of August. It then begins slowly to rise as the winter sets in until about Christmas* when the rise becomes more rapid and freshets caused by rain in the catchment area come down the river. It reaches its maximum flood height towards the end of April or beginning of May when the snow melts. Should rain storms come at this melting season the river rises very high. It then begins slowly to decrease in volume until the minimum is again reached at the end of August. _ The volume varies year by year, but the minimum seldom drops below 1,000 cubic feet a second and the maximum has been estimated to risef to between 600,000 to 700,000 cubic feet a second in 1885. This would be a high flood volume even on the Nile. Three times in the last 65 years the river has dried up altogether in its lower reaches below Chaharburjak and Kala-i-Fath, but only for a short time on each occasion. In some year between 1838 and 1844 it dried up for 22 days below Kalau-Fath ; in 1871 it failed for 40 days below Chaharburjak and in 1902 it dried up for 70 days below the Rudbar canal head. Even in these years the deficiency was only in the hot weather and our notes show that there was an ample supply of water in these years for maturing the spring crop. From time immemorial a weir or band has been constructed at the point The Band or Weir. where the main distributing channel left the main river, and this has varied in posi tion at different periods. For many years the principal distributary has been the existing Rud-i-Seistan and a weir called the Band-i-Seistan or the Band-i- Kuhak has been in existence across the main river at Kuhak. Of recent years, i.e. } since 1896, owing to the formation of a second principal branch of the river, i.e., the Rud-i-Parian, a weir, called the Band-i-Parian or the Band-i-Shahgul, has also become necessary across the Rud-i-Parian for the irriga tion of the Miankangl tract of Persian Seistan. . Such weirs are necessary, not only to divert a sufficient amount of water into the distributary channel, but because the bed of such a channel at its head is always higher than the bed of the parent river. This results from the deposits of silt at that ^ point owing to the slackening of the velocity of the water as it leaves the main stream. The larger and much the _ most important portions of Persian Seistan depend on the Band-i-Seistan for its water-supply during the winter. It is made of tamarisk boughs packed together as will be described later. Its construc tion begins when the Helmand is at its minimum volume, i.e., from the middiet of August to the beginning of September. It generally gets badly breached by the early freshets down the Helmand at or about Christmas time, and as the river rises, more and more of the band is carried away, until at high flood it may be said to consist only of what looks like an isolated island or two in the main stream, and there is not enough of it left to cause any noticeable heading up of the water. Practically, therefore, the work * Sometimes early in December : sometimes not till the beginning of January. . t The maximum of flood volume in 1903 was 70,000 (ist May) ; in 1904 27,000 cusecs (nth April) and in 1905, only 16,853 cusecs (4th May). r I In 1903 its construction commenced on the 17th August and was finished on the 12th September • n iqo - r 1 September 3rd and finished on the 14th ; in 1905 it began on the 14th August and finished on the 21st. ^ * 198 [Chap. XIV. done on it annually amounts to a total reconstruction of the band. Its size varies a little year by year according to the energy of the makers. Its length of course is that of the width of the Helmand, which does not vary much year by year, though the river is much wider now at the band site than it once was. The width of the river now Is about 1,630 feet. In 1903 the width of the band varied from 70 to 90 feet, and it was built some 3 feet higher than the surface of the water it headed' 5 back. Its height from bed-level of the river was from 5 feet at the sides to 15 to 20 feet in deep stream. This, as can easily be seen, is a work of some magnitude and a short des cription of the method of construction will not be out of place. No water rates of any kind are levied to meet the cost of construction of the bandandi no payments are made for the The labour emp.oyed, work done on it. The labour is furnished by the cultivators of all the Ghami ploughs (page 70, Chapter XI) of Persian Seistan, excluding Miankangf, whether they be Kishtgar or Bazgar. There seems to be some idea that this labour being unpaid is irksome, but if so, this feeling must be a very slight one, as the people working at the band always seem as happy and cheery as the same men when harvesting their own crops. The organization of this labour is well managed, and there appears to be little favour itism or partiality. Efficient and industrious labour is consistently enforced on all, and the work is rapidly brought to a successful end, and the labourers return to- their homes to plough and sow their wheat and barley, the crops of the year on which the prosperity and comfort of the community annually depend. The need for annual co-operation in building this band is perhaps an unmixed blessing, as it binds rulers and people together in a common interest, and shows both that neither is independent of the other. No abuses seem to have sprung up such as exist with the corvee (Egypt) or the chher (Punjab) systems of maintaining canals. Some small amount of labour escapes by paying 10 kran to the pdkdr at the band, or 5 or 6 kran to the village kadkhuda, but this is not con sidered good form, and there is no recognised fee as commutation for this labour. If a cultivator is unable, through illness or otherwise, to attend, he must send a substitute, or obtain leave of absence from the Sarbandi Chief. It is said that the Sarbandi Chief of the day has controlled the labour of build ing this band ever since the Kuhak fort was built 130 years ago. The present Sar bandi chief, Sardar Purdil Khan, is a very prominent character on these occasions. The Governor of Seistan gives orders fixing the date of building and the amount of labour required. The ingenious manner in which the labour is distributed over the country is fully shown in Appendix 5. These orders are circulated to all the village kadkhuda who through their pdkdr collect the cultivators of the ghami ploughs and send off the village hashar (labour gang) at the appoint ed time. The six cultivators of each ghami plough are sent off to Kiihak in pairs. Each pair works for about a week and is then relieved by the next pair. The men take their own food and tesha with which they cut the tamarisk. Sardar Purdil Khan, who is now always placed in control of the building, proceeds to Kuhak and takes over charge of V\\e hashar. One man in iof to 20 is allowed off other duty to cook food for the party. There are a few old huts built for shelter at the Persian end of the band which Sardar Purdil Khan and the leading kadkhuda occupy while work is going on. The rest of the labourers encamp in the tamarisk jungle close by. The principal labour of building the band is of course the cutting and collection of the tamarisk wood used. To ensure every man doing a full day’s work Sardar Purdil Khan informs them every evening how many bundles of tamarisk wood,, and of what size, they are to bring in per man next day. The number of bundles varies with the distance they have to be brought. First the tamarisk branches are made up into small bundles (called nimcha by Persians ; baluma by Baluchis). These weigh about 5 Indian seers each. * * The water is headed up about to 3 feet, i.e,, this is the difference of level between the up and down stream; water at the band, f In 1903 one man in every 10 was thus allowed, but in 1904 only one man in every 20, ir V-99 Chap. XIV.] Three or four of these are made up into a large bundle {kulak) which forms a man s load. One man cuts the wood with his tssha and 6 to 8 carry it away to the band. The bundles cut and brought by the gang of each village are placed in a separate place near the band under charge of one of their own men. In the evening Sardar Purdil Khan, accompanied by his riiirza, who has the record of the task given to each village, counts the bundles and they are taken overby him. Work commences at sunrise and continues till sunset with only one hour’s interval in the day for food and rest. . To ev ery ioo men is a task-master to see that none idle. Their duty must be light, as the work seems to be carried on with the cheery energy and skill characteristic of the Seistani in all his avocations. A spirit of goodwill and enthusiasm seems to pervade all the labourers in this band building. The first duty of the hashar is to repair the old huts near the band and then the weir building commences. There is an expert in charge of this called The Bandbdf and Kadkhuda Muhammadi “ Bandbaf. ” He belongs to a family of Kakha * two brothers living in Deh Tuti. Two of the sons of the other brother, now too old to work, also work on the band. They are paid by an allowance of grain taken at the threshing floor at harvest (page 78, Chapter XI). This allowance is fixed at two and-a-half Seistani man of wheat per lahivu and pdgdvi plough. The details collected from the Bandbdf and other information about the band too minute to detail here will be found in Appendix 8* The Bandbaf decides how the work is to be done and issues directions to the village pdkdr. The kadkhuda of Deh Tuti, Muhammad of the taifa Kakha, is considered the head of the pdkdr for the occasion and should Sardar Purdi! Khan be absent takes his place as chief man in charge of the work. The tamarisk cut during the day is put into the band in the evening. The Details of construction. bandbdf place the bundles that go below * water with their own hands. The end of the bundle containing the thick ends of the branches is placed slanting downwards and the bundles are tightly packed together. Work usually commences from the Persian side of the river and the band is run out from that bank until it reaches the force of the stream ; then work starts from the Afghan bank with tamarisk cut from there. The band is not built straight across but from both banks points a little up stream bringing the elbow at the point, where the main force of the current hits the band, thus causing the river when the band is finished to strike the elbow and consolidate the packed tamarisk. The tamarisk bundles below water are packed one on another on a slope, but longitudinally with the band with the heavier ends downwards. Those above water are packed horizontally and laid across the band with the heavier ends up stream. Some layers are also laid longitudinally. The bundles are packed tightest at the end nearer the canal head to pre vent breaches occurring at that end. They are placed more loosely in the centre of the stream and towards the Afghan bank so as to make the band breach when the time_ comes, as far away as possible from the canal head. The object of the builders is to so construct the weir that it sends, as nearly as possible, one-half of_the water of the river down the Riid-i-Seistan, and in this they succeed with wonderful accuracy. When necessary to effect this the band is staunched with rolls of kirta grass and by putting a layer of earth on top of the band to weight it and press the material down tighter. This is not done when the remains of last year’s band are staunch enough to effect this purpose. The number of men employed varies every year with the amount of work to be done, as some years a considerable portion of last year’s band may remain while in others little or nothing is left. Thus in 1903 we estimated that 2,000 were employed throughout, while an extra 500 men were sent for and employed when difficulty was found in closing the last gap of the band. The work in 1903 took just a month to complete, while in 1904 it was done in a fortnight and in ♦ 905 in a week. C639FD ccI GO [Chap. XW. Detail statements of the labour employed on tbe band in each of these years will be found in Appendices 9 and 10 from which it will be seen that the value of the labour expended per cultivated acre of spring crop varied from fths of a kran in 190)3 to |th of a kran in 1904* Arrangements are made to watch and guard the band, so that early informa- ^ iT , , tion may be given of any unusual settle- Oruarding the band. 7 i • i y ment ot the tamarisk structure or any breach in the band. The site is a longish distance from any habitation or culti vation. The watchmen, Bandban, have also to see that no wood is stolen or taken away for fuel, and that no fires are lighted near it. This is a necessary precau tion, as in autumn the band is a popular resort for local anglers and fishermen and forming a comfortable dry road across the river, it is much used by local traffic. Most of the wayfarers sit and rest on the band. The Parian band was partially burnt down by a carelessly placed fire in 1904. For this watch and ward some men with guns {tujaugchi) are appointed. Formerly a small party of local foot levies were placed here, but latterly all the local levies furnished by tbe kadkhud'a have been sowar, and so no footmen are now available. Other arrangements have had to be made, and each season this takes some new line. Generally hitherto a few men have been left at the band as guards when the haskar left, and for their food and remuneration all the remaining supplies of food brought by the hashar were collected and given to these men. Some years as much as 50 Indian maunds were thus collected, fn 1904, however, the evidently got too clever and had little food unexpended. Only about 7 maunds could be collected, and as this was not sufficient, Sardar Purdil Khan appointed four men as tufangchi as a temporary measure for the present year until the Governor of Seistan, who is away at Tehran, returns and makes some permanent arrangement. For their remuneration Sarddr Purdil Khan headed a list of subscriptions in grain with a donation of 100 Seistani man. Other leading men added their names and the total amount subscribed amounts to 430 man Seistani, which the tufangchi ateio go and collect them selves from the subscribers. It is proposed in future to charge each plough in the Rud-i-Seistdn one man Seistani of wheat and one of barley for these guards.* This would amount to over 4,000 man in the year which for the maintenance of four tufangchi is somewhat excessive. The people see in this, and doubtless with some reason, a new attempt to swell the revenue of the local Governor at their expense. The Miankangt portion of Persian Seistan depends on the band across The Band-i-Parian. the Rudd-Parian which is required to divert a sufficient portion of the river into L he j 1 rT, U chann f ’ n0W comin £ t0 he cal!ed the Rudd-Afghan, whence the biadak, Deh Dost Muhammad and Lakhshak canal systems are'fed.

At the present time, 1904, the Afghans and Persians each build their own band, though formerly theyf built one band ]om\\y.

As a rule, and as far as possible each village has its own canal from the rrver . Where such is the case, they take their watef from the riTer without apparently any rules regulating the size of the canal head or period dnrimr which the canal is left filled. No band, however, are allowed in the R ud-i-Seistdnt Some villages owing to their distance from the river, are dependant upon a canal which also feeds other villages. No band are allowed in the canal as far as it is joint property, and if any rotation of turns, or times of taking water is in dispute, the kadkhuda of the villages concerned meet and decide it or on faiiincr to do so refer the question to the Governor. &amp; To assist him in supervising the canals the Governor appoints hmh Chapter J\ aet aS Mtrab of each big canal system as explained at the end of silt (deared^lav ^ v * Ira ^ e hashar (labourgang) and repaired and silt cleared by the same agency except m cases where the construction of a canal is too large an undertaking for local labour, and then the Governor calls out a Wmr from the who!* country.

XIV. In the matter of a proper system of ensuring the water rights m lower villages and of protecting lower lands from damage the otherwise effective system or village co-operation in Seistan fails, and the need of some intelligent and care u central control is badly felt. The duty of water used in irrigation. The usual way of calculating duty is on the volume used during the whole time that the crop takes water. This would be from 21st September to 21st . , . March for spring crops, and from 21st The normal volume of the canals during the c C ontnmn sowing time of wheat. March to 21st September ior_ autumn crops. No autumn crops take w T ater after the 21st September in Seistan, but some irrigation of wheat and barley is made after 21st March, but is then in flood, this is not a matter of any importance. as the river From early in March to about the middle of May of normal years the river is in flood, and there is a super-abundance of water ; but from the beginning or middle of July the river falls to its minimum about the end of August and then gradually rises again. But the volume at the rise is usually larger than that during the fall; so that the volume* of water that is available to sow the wheat crop is rather more than that available to mature the autumn crop. The normal volume available at those seasons and the duty on this volume is of considerable interest in Seistan. It is now common among irrigation engineers especially in Egypt and America to describe the crop-raising power of water in the depth of water required to mature the crop. The acref foot is the unit usually employed ; this is the volume of v r ater that will cover an acre of land one foot deep. Since there are 43,560 square feet in an acre and 86,400 seconds in the 24 hours, one cusec will irrigate 2 acre feet (nearly) in the day or 60 foot acres in a month of 30 days. As pointed out by Mr. R. G. Kennedy, Chief Engineer, in his valuable paper on Irrigation in the Western States of United States, America (Technical Paper No. 157), duty is inversely as the depth of w T ater : and the depth of water poured on to the land during the six months can be readily got from the figure for duty. If N be the number of months— A be the area irrigated by a cubic foot a second throughout the number of months, D be the depth of w r ater per acre poured on to the land during the crop. This is the figure called Delta in the Punjab. Then 60 N = A D. D= 60 N X -1 So that if the Duty is 50 acres a cusec, then D=^^=7’2 feet. The ‘ Duty ’ has been wmrked out in Statement L and is as follows:— For the spring crop. 4 Canals in the SMb-i-Ab and Pusht-i-Ab ... 90 Canals on the right bank of the Rud-i-Parian ... 67 Canals from the Nad-i-Aff channel ... 57 Total average ... 85 * This volume from Statement L is— Canals in the Pusht-i-Ab and Shib-i-ib ... ...

But as a basis for calculation we won’t be far w * 7 rong if we use the same figures. If the duties are calculated on this volume, it wall be seen as stated before, that the expenditure of 'water on irrigation in Seistan is very lavish, as the following areas of land only are irrigated by one cubic foot of water per second:— Acres per cusec. On Rud-i- Seistan „ Rud-i-Parian ,, Nad-i-Ali channel Total average 5 i 44 33 49 In the autumn crop season the results are still more striking: Acres per eusec. On Rud-i-Seistan ...

The conditions of Seistan are such that cultivation should require less, and Strong reasons why the spring crop duty in not more, water per acre in the spring crop Seistan should be much higher than it is in the than the Punjab, Not Only is the Soil a Puniab. , J J . . very cool one, requiring but few waterings to mature crops, but the Seistan winters are much longer and far colder than those of the Punjab plains. The sky during the winter is often cloudy ; there are periodical showers of rain, and sometimes also good falls of snow. Seistan lands during those months do not need nearly so much water as similar lands in the Punjab canal tracts. The Seistani has cultivated land by irrigation uninterruptedly from the very earliest times; palselothic implements have been found in large numbers in the country, and there is little doubt that this was one of the first homes of civilized man.^ So that with the Seistani cultivation by means of irrigation is an inherited instinct derived from intermarrying with the descendants of the most ancient irrigators on the face of the earth. *Rabi Kharif Total 173 acres per cusec. 7 2 &gt;1 &gt;1 H 24s ft II I) [C639FD] DD104 [Chap.

This fact is one which should be carefully remembered in all calculations of possible extensions of cul tivation in Seistan. Seistan suffers more from excess of water than deficiency thereof. Year *3 ,. , , after year in normal seasons large areas of Protection embankments. i 1 J ■ , 1 , . land under crop are damaged either in whole or in part by inundations.

These are to be found along all the river banks near their mouths and round the Hamlin shores in Seistan protecting lands from inundation from the rising of the rivers, large canals, or Hamiins. Protective embankments along the river are needed, because the level of the water of the river in flood is several feet above the level of the country. The same occurs in most deltas all over the world. These embankments are locally known as gura and vary in size. Some are but small banks ; others are very massive, wide and high earth embankments. They are constructed by the labour of the village hashar of the villages con cerned, and in the case of the larger and important embankments by hashar called out by the local Government in the same manner as the labour for the annual reconstruction of the Band-i»Seistdn. The annual repairs and reconstruction of these gura commences in Nov ember and ends in February. Human like the Seistdni neglects their repair after a succession of dry years as in 1902 and is very diligent after a year of flood as in 1903-04.CHAPTER XV. CONTENTS.

As the people lay in their store of grain for the year at the time the produce Quantity of grain consumed by the people in a of the harvest is divided, they have full y ^ ar ‘ . knowledge of the quantity of grain that they ^ consume in a year. The quantity varies a great deal according as the year is one of great plenty,—-a year of famine or a year such as those in which the Mission lived in Seistan, when grain was obtainable, but it was also saleable, and no one kept more gram than he actually required. The quantity of grain stored for home consumption in such years as those from 1903 to 1904 has been ascer tained from a number of families ; the figure is more than the family could sub sist on in a famine year and less than they would consume when living freely in a year of plenty. J Grain consumed in a yeah. Class of family. Wheat and pulses. Barley and millet. Cultivators in the Rud-i-Seistan tract for the most part Farsi, at 5 souls a family on the average. Seistani man, 132 Seistani man, 43 Cultivators in the Miankangi for the most part Baluch, at 6 souls in a family. 138 72 Herd-owners, average family of 6 souls each 168 25 Flock-owners with 6 souls a family on the average ... 201 22 Saiyads with 4 or 5 souls a family on the average 140 21 The people generally cook bread twice a day except in winter when fuel is Cultivators. scarce, and then they cook only once a day n f , . .. , . as a rule. From the 1st July to the 1st October the cultivators live largely on melons, and consume less than half the usual quantity of bread. For the purpose of this estimate the families of influential people and priests as well as those of artificers, labourers, etc., living in the village, may be assumed* to consume the same quantity of grain as the cultivators themselves. It would have taken more labour than there was time for to have collected figures for each of these classes of occupations separately. In the spring and summer, the herd and flock-owners augment their food Herd and flock-owners. from milk and its products. They have, however, to buy the water melons that they consume, though the herd-owners earn some by supplying bullocks for ploughing melon fields ; and in years of high flood the flock-owners are able to grow melons on flooded lands along the River or Hamun, and they talk with enthusiasm of years of flood like 1885 when magnificent crops of melons were raised on the delta of the Sar-i-Shela in the Gaud-i-Zireh (see Appendix 27). The Saiyads live partly on the surplus unsaleable part of the produce of The Salads. their cajches of fowl and fish and partly on grain bought in exchange for these catches, or earned by work as harvest labourers, as will be found explained in Chapter ALl If. r [C639FD]io8 [Chap. XV. Grain consumed by animals. Besides the grain consumed by the people, a large quantity is consumed by the animals; this will now be estimated for each class of animals. The plough bullocks will receive grain for i J months at 24 Seist&amp;ni man a pair of plough bullocks a month or 36 man Cattle * a pair a year. The more weakly of the cows will be grain fed for the two months at the end of winter, receiving eight Seistani man of grain a month or 16 man Seistani a year. In the Rud-i-Seistan tract, where millet is not much grown, the cows may be assumed to be fed on barley and in the Miankangf half on barley and half on millet. It may be assumed that there are 500 cows so fed in the Rudd-Seistan tract and in the Miankangf. The cattle-owners living in the Naizdr do not grain feed their cows. Horses are usually fed for 10 months out of the 12, each horse in the Mian- kangi receiving 7^ man barley and 7-| man Horses ' of millet each month or 75 man of barley and 75 man of millet a year. In the Rud-i-Seistan tract the norses may be as sumed to be fed entirely on barley. Camels are only grain fed when used for riding purposes (jambaz)&gt; and it may be assumed that of the camels Camels * will be given barley for 10 months at 15 man a month each, say 150 man a year. The flock-owners give grain to their baggage camels during the two months that they are used to carry their camp. It may be estimated that there are 300 such camels with the flock-owners in Persian Seistan, and that each will receive 30 Seistani ma?i a year. The donkeys of the cultivators are fed on grain when they are used for rid ing purposes or for carrying loads. It may Donkeys ’ be estimated that of the number of the donkeys will be so fed for 10 months in the year consuming 5 man of grain each a month or 50 Seist&amp;ni man a year. In the Rud-i-Seistan tract this may be assumed to be all barley, but in Miankangf half barley and half millet. The donkeys of the graziers or flock owners will only be fed for two months in the year when they are used for carrying the camp from one place to another; that is, 5 man Seistani of barley and 5 man Seistani of millet a year per donkey. There are about 1,800 such donkeys with the herd-owners in Persian Seistan, and they may be estimated to consume 90 kharwar Seistani ot barley and 90 khar- war of millet. In the foot-note of page 229 to the paragraph in Chapter XXXVIII on S)ee feeding sheep with barley it has been shown ’ eep ' that previous to 1897, when barley was very cheap, all the surplus barley of the country was consumed by the sheep. But from 1897 to 1902 barley, as well as wheat, was exported so largely from Seistan to the neighbouring districts of Persia, and from 1902 to 1905, though these exports fell off very much, yet the demands of the Mission kept the prices of barley too high to admit of sheep being fed on it. It may therefore be assumed that so long as exports are restricted to Per sian districts the sheep will eat the surplus barley in good years when prices are low. But if unrestricted export were allowed barley could never be cheap enough to be fed to sheep. Some grain will be lost or destroyed in the grain pits* ; such losses occur in ^ , 4 . . pits made at sites having unsuitable soil that becomes damp from seepage from flooded lands ; weevil (solak) is also a cause of loss. These losses are very diffi cult to estimate. Some put them at 5 per cent, of the outturn, as they say some stocks lie in the ground till they rot. Even if this is correct, if exports were encouraged, the loss would doubtless become small, as the surplus grain would leave the country before the winter and spring floods. We may estimate the loss at I per cent, on the outturn, i.e., equivalent to 10 percent, of the seed. * It is said that in pits in ordinary dry ground the grain lasts three years; in pits in dry sandy situations five years. These periods seem short compared with what oue has heard of the periods for which grain is stored in the dry parts of the Punjab and Bikanir,Chap. XV.] 109 In years of very extraordinary floods all the grain in the pits on those lands Losses from high floods. t ^ at are unex P e ctedly flooded by a new de velopment in the direction of the river is des troyed ; but it is worth noticing that these floods always come before harvest, and therefore the grain lost in the pits is the surplus grain of the previous year. If exports were encouraged, this surplus would have been sold to the kafila in the autumn and winter and converted into cash to help the people to tide over the loss of standing crops that is inevitable when such floods occur. The wheat, barley and millet grain required for seed is given in Statement S(&gt;ed rain A. The opinions based on our obser vations of sowings made in the three con secutive years—1902, I 9 ° 3 &gt; ! 9 ° 4 —is that the quantity of seed sown in normal years is practically constant. The quantity of seed sown depends on the number of ploughs and the quantity of seed sown by each plough. The number of ploughs in the whole country does not vary much from year to year. The quantity of seed each plough sows is regulated by the leading men in accord ance with the size of the canal and the water in the river ; in practice it comes about that the seed sown by different ploughs does not vary much. The volume of the river may vary at sowing time, but the period over which the sowings are made is so long that the seed sown each year is not much affected by the variations in the flow of the river. The number of ploughs are nicely adjusted by the hereditary genius of the people to the capacity of the canal. There is an extension of cultivation going on in the Miankangf, but the Rud-i-Parian is also flooding lands on its west bank once cultivated, and many of the new cultivators in the Miankangf have come from the Riid-i-Seistan tract. For these reasons, apart from the deliberate statement of the people themselves, we arrived at the opinion that the seed sown in Seistan does not vary much from year to year, though after each period of years there has been an increase of cultivation. In the accompanying estimate the different grains have not been kept separate, as it would complicate the The estimate of surplus grain. estimate without adding much to our knowledge. Wheat and pulses are of equal food value, so are millet, barley and maize, because the people do not grow an undue proportion of pulses or millet. The grains and pulses have therefore been added together in two groups under wheat and barley. The figures for the outturn of normal years and the year 1903-04 have been taken from Statement G with 10 per cent, added, to allow for the grain paid away before threshing to harvest labourers, kalaki, chungi, etc., vide page 75 of Chapter XI and the first statement at the end of Chapter XII ; this grain all goes to feed souls. The surplus in a bad year like I903-04 then works out to 183,195 Indian maunds which may stand for the usual minimum surplus available for export from Persian Seistan. The figure for a normal year works out to 822,840 Indian maunds, and this may be looked on as the maximum likely to be available for export in any one year. As a matter of fact, the figures of total grain consumed annually should be increased when considering the surplus of good years, because, as has been explained, the people live less economically when grain is plentiful. But if exports were encouraged instead of being res tricted, grain would never be cheap even when plentiful ; moreover, the people would prefer to economise in grain and sell the surplus for cash to buy things that they would prefer more. There is nothing to guide one to an estimate of what the total consumption would be under such circumstances, so the figures have been left as they are. They will serve as an indication of what the export from Seistan should be. It should be pointed out here that these estimates deal with all the grain , , . . . available for export, and not that which is available for export to British India. There are large tracts of Persia—notably Kain and Sarhad—which rely on Seistan for their grain. Kdfila come each year and purchase grain; in years of scarcity* * The average load of a camel may be taken at 25 Seist&amp;ni man about 4 Indian maunds; at the same time camels eat grain to the extent of about 5 Seistani man a camel on the average, so that the export was from 1,200,000 to 1,500,000 Seistani ?nan, or 180,000 to 225,000 Indian maunds. As a matter of fact, the people nave no actual knowledge of the number of camels in all the Kdfila ; they are not counted. Forty isalwavs a dangerous number. It is the word for a large party. Chihil Pir*i-Zahidan, ChihiS Dukhtaran, Chihil Burj (as a fact, there are 88 bastions in Chihil Burj).I IO [Chap. XV. all the available grain in Seistan is rapidly removed from the country to supply the needs of the Persian Provinces near by where the harvest has not been so good. The Persians would never permit of an export which jeopardised this supply, as there would be bread riots. But if foreign exports were permitted in good years, the people would be encouraged to extend the cultivation, knowing that they were always certain of a market. At present in years of good rainfall in Eastern Persia there is only a very poor market for gram. The spring harvest of 1901-02 was a good one, much better than the harvest of 1903-04 from all accounts; it is said that from 40,000 to 50,000 camel-loads of grain were taken from Seistan to Birjand, Kain, Meshed, Sarhad, and all the surplus grain was thus removed from the country. ^ The autumn harvest of 1902 was a failure, because the river dried up below Rudblr in August, so that in the winter of 1902-03 there was famine among the people and great difficulty was felt by the cultivators to get grain to sow; though, as a matter of fact, they eventually did sow a full crop, and reaped a good harvest ; the outturn was good and the only loss was the damage done by floods which amounted to about 10 per cent, on the normal outturn given in Statement G— vide Statement P. cr the last paragraph of Chapter XIV.CHAPTER XVI.

The annual resources of Persian Seistdn in normal years. In Statement O the annual resources of Persian Seistan have been grouped together and valued at the somewhat high rates that prevailed while the Mission was in Seistan, and at the more normal rates that prevailed in the years that preceded the great drought. The quantities of the agricultural produce have been taken from the figures of divisible or net produce of the threshing floor given in Statement G, but 10 per cent, has been added to these quantities for wheat and barley and 5 per cent, for cotton, pulses, millet and sesame to obtain the gross produce of the harvest. The way the quantities for animal produce and the value of labour expended on manufactured products has been obtained will be found explained in the Chapters XXXIII to XLV on the classes who earn their living from herds, flocks, udld fowling, weaving, making pottery, etc. Great pains has been taken to ascertain the numbers of the cattle and the flocks as well as the means of livelihood of the wild fowlers, because in any scheme of expansion of cultivation by irrigation it is of the greatest importance to know what other classes will be affected thereby and exactly what the resources of these classes are, and how they are derived. The years that we were in Seistan followed on a great drought in which many animals died, and it was necessary to discover what the number of animals were in the prosperous times that preceded the drought; years of prosperity and years of great loss occur to herds and flocks in regular succession in every generation, as these animals are dependent on the character and distribution of the rainfall for their well being ; for the pasturage as well as the cultivation depends on the river for its supply of water. The experience of the Mission will be a valuable guide to what occurs in time of drought; when prosperous times come back again, the figures can be completed. All the details by which the figures for the years of prosperity are deduced are carefully given in the appropriate Chapters, so that any one interested in the subject, who may be in possession of better information on any point, may be able to recalculate the number or quantities afresh. It is hardly necessary to say that it is very difficult to arrive at a satisfactory figure for the value of animal produce in the years of prosperity from the actual figures that we have for the lean years in which we knew Seistan, but it is believed that the total value would not be much altered, though the probability is that the sum total would be higher than has been given in column 10 of Statement 0 , because the export of this produce is not restricted to the same extent that agricultural produce is, moreover, the animal products themselves are not so bulky as agricultural produce, and are therefore more easily carried the great distances that intervene between Seistan and the best markets, so that the value of animal produce, is not likely to fall as fast as agricultural produce in years of plenty. But even without making any allowance for this, it would appear that in good years the animal produce is nearly 30 per cent, of the annual resources of the country, though on the actual figures of the years in which we were in Seistan the percentage w r as only 135. These figures show what an important position the herd and flock-owners and Saiyads hold in 'the country; and perhaps in no other form could this have been so clearly brought out.

The number of acres cultivated annually per cultivato/s family are 8*4 acres per family. The density of population on the la?id. The area of culturable Persian Seistan is 794‘4* square miles and of Naizar about 473*4 square miles ; so that the tract, which supports the population of 136,591 souls, is 1,268 square miles in area ; thus there are 108 souls per square mile; we may ignore the large area of desert which surrounds the culturable area, off which in occasional years of exceptional rain flock-owners may obtain a little value but no one else. The cultivators are directly supported on the culturable area ; the artizans, labourers, weavers, dyers, are indirectly supported on the culturable land ; the cattle of the cattle- owners are supported on the rich growth of the Naizar ; but they also bring income to their owners from the cultivation. The Saiyads find means of sub sistence from the harvest of the land as well as from the birds and fish that live in the Naizar. The birds and fish too are sold to those who live on the land. The flock-owners find grazing for their flocks from the stubble of the fields, the scrub bushes on the waste lands and from the grass along the margins of inundated area ; but for a part of the year a large number of sheep are taken to graze on the spring verdure of the hills, but the owners take the grain for their food with them from Seistan. The traders doubtless make their money from all these classes, but the largest share of their incomes must come from those who live on cultivation. 1 In order to compare the figures of density with those worked out in the Cen- ^ D . c . * sus Reportf for the Punjab we must work Density in Persian Seistan compared with that , v. . f J i • / \ in some Punjab districts. out the density ot the population (136,59*) on the cultivated area (233 square miles), the culturable area (794*4 square miles) and the gross area (2,847 s fi i:ia r e miles). There are no figures with which we can compare the density of the population on the culturable area and Naizar (1,268 square miles) except, perhaps, those of the districts which have large grazing areas attached to the cultivated areas like the Hill States, the districts in the North-West dry area, like Shahpur and Multan, and districts like Jhelum and Rawalpindi.

In India there is ; the water- rates on the Punjab canals on all the crops grown during the year on an average vary from Rs. 3'86 (Western Jamna) to 2*89 (Swat River Canal) per acre. While the total revenue taken by the State from canal irrigated lands inclusive of land revenue, cesses and water rates varies from Rs. 5*55 per acre on the Western Jamna canal to Rs. 6'39 on the Bari Doab. The revenue taken varies from one- eighth to one-fifth of the average value cf the gross produce already given on page 1 i6 for these canals. {Vide page 3 of “ Note IV of the “ Notes on Irrigation Works in the Punjab for the Commission of Famine Protective Works.”) Incidence per cultivated acre of the gross revenue assessed on the agricultural produce of the Central Government* At the beginning of Chapter XIII it is stated that the Central Government has assessed the agricultural produce of Persian Seistan at 24,012 Tabriz khar- war of grain, and further on it is said that the Hashmat-ul-Mulk pays his revenue to the Governor-General of Khorasan at 25 kran per Tabriz kharwar, while that official passes on only kran per kharwar Tabriz. We are not con cerned now with the deductions that are allowed for the expenses of administer ing the country ; the land revenue assessment is 24,012 Tabriz kharwar at 25 kran — 600,300 kran, or 4 kran per cultivated acre ; about rupee one.

General description of the boundaries, administration, garrison, population, tribes. The country situated within Afghan territory, which originally formed a por- . tion of Seistan, and which is known by us The ooun anes. ^ Afghan, Seistan, is not locally known as such. It is called either Chakhansur as a whole, or by the name of the two sub-districts into which it is divided, ix., Chakhansur and Kala-i-Fath. The boundaries of the whole tract comprising the above are as follows - South. —Baluch Afghan boundary. East and North .—A line drawn from near Kani (on the Baluch Afghan boundary), leaving Kani on the west and running about parallel to and about five miles north of the Kani, Humai, Shah Ismail, Selihdn, Khw^ja Ali route to the point where that route crosses it near Gullachah. It leaves Gullachah on the south and runs thence, leaving Sukaluh on the south to Lat on the Helmand. It crosses the Helmand, leaving the hamlet of Lat on the west, and runs northwards across the Dasht-i-Margo to the Khash Rud. Leaving the villages of Haleli (Hariri and Aleli on map) and Gehkhan on the west, it runs west wards to the hill Takht-i-Rustam. From the Takht-i-Rustam the boundary turns southwards, and leaving Peshawaran on the west it joins the Perso-Afghan boundary line, and follows that to the Kdh-i-Malik Siah. Chakhansur comprises the northern portion of this tract down to a line drawn eastwards through Khwabgah on the Helmand. Kala-i-Fath is the portion south of the above line. The Chakhansur district, including its sub-district, used to form a portion of ,, . . . the Farah Province.

The present^ Governor, the Seistan Mission, 1903.1905. Akhundzada Fakir Muhammad KhAn, a Tarin Afghan, has been Governor for some 25 years. His family originally migrated into this part of Afghanistan from near Pishin. His head-quarters have hitherto been Kala-i-Kang, but are now at Nad-i-’Ali. Kala-i-Fath is under a Hakim, who is generally subordinate to the Governor of Chakhansur. The present incumbent, Sardar Muhammad Ayub Khan, endea vours to shake off this subordination, but with varying success. The revenue administration is under the Governor of Chakhansur or Kala-i- Fath, as the case may be, as far as the assessment or collection of land or other revenue is concerned, but all the revenue assessment is under a Sarishtadar, who is directly subordinate to the Sarishtadar at Farah. The revenue is paid through the Sarishtadar to the Farah treasury, and is included in the revenue totals of that province. All judicial cases, which can be settled by Muhammadan religious law, are diciaI disposed of by a Kazi, appointed by the Amir. Other cases are settled and dis posed of by the Governor of Chakhansur or the Hakim of Kala-i-Fath, as the case may be.

Sardar Khan Jan Khan, the grandson of the eldest son, now resides at Siadak in Persian Seistan. The descendants of the second son, of whom Sardar Ali Khan is the chief, live in the Chaghai district. The descendants of the third son, of whom Sardar Muhammad Umar Khan is the chief, live at Bandar-i-Kamal Khan and Rudbar. Sardar Muhammad Umar Khan has been detained as a hostage for 21 years at Kabul, but his brothers rule at the above named places. This family, the descendant of Sardar Kamal Khan, until the past 2 years enjoyed exemption of all revenue, but this is now being demanded from them with the result that they are very dissatisfied and ready to leave Afghan territory. The descendants of the fourth son, of whom Sardar Atta Muhammad Khan is the chief, live at Chaharburjak. They are exempt from paying revenue, and Atta Muhammad Khan also enjoys an allowance from the Amir of 2,000 krdn per annum. He has to supply 30 local sowars for service.

The Revenue system of AfghXn SeistAn. Tract North of and including the Mirabdd Canal, The Revenue system in Afghan Seisthn will now be described in such a The parts into which the note will be divid- Way as to bring to notice in what respects ed- the system differs and is similar to that in Persian Seistan. For this purpose it will be convenient to divide the tract along the Helmand visited by the Mission into four parts. (i) The Delta tract north of and including the Mirabad canal. (ii) The tract cultivated by the Sanjarani Sardars from the Rudbar canal to Bandar-i-Kamal Khan canalinclusive. (iii) The tract up stream of Rudbar cultivated by Afghan families. (iv) The irrigation from the Khash Riid in Tababa*i-Chakhansur. In the Delta tract has been included the canals along the river which take out below the Sanjarani canals and above the Band-i-Seistan. These are— On the left bank the Dak-i-Dila canal, the separate water-courses for Deh Alam Khan and Deh Mastian. On the right bank (i) the Mirabad,* (2) the Kala i-Fath,* (3) Deh Dost * The Mirabad and Kala-i-Fath canals have Muhammad, (4) Sabz Ghazi 01' Deh Mirak the same head. and (5) the Khogah or Khawbgah canals. All these canals are under the Hakim of Kala-i-Fath and are so classed in the Revenue Statements On these canals the water is distributed by branches as on the canals in the Sanjarani tract which will be described in their proper place. But the division of the produce is practically the same as that made on the canals in Afghan Seistan to the north of the Khwabgah canal. The informatian collected by the village to village enquiries has been worked , , . out in Statements Nos. 1 to q in the same Revenue an ot er ta emen s. wa y as has been done for Persian Seistdn. These Statements shew the cultivation of the villages on the_ Helmand from the Rudbar canal downwards. All these villages have been examined by ourselves or our subordinates. In Statements Nos. 10 and 11 the cultivation done in the Delta of the Khdsh t Except Rai Bahadur Gopal Singh, Survey Rud, usually known as Tababah-i-Chakhan- of India, who made the plane-table survey. s -u.r, is given ; no memberf of the Mission personally visited these villages ; the information is obtained from the guides who helped to collect the information in the Helmand Delta. Statements Nos. 12 and 13 give the population living in the villages of the Helmand below Rudbar and the Khash below Aleli. The Delta Tract.—\t will be convenient to first describe the Delta tract, as the methods and customs there differ but little from those in Persian Seistan. All the lands are khdlisa, i.e., owned by the State. The Hakim of Chakhansur, the local Governor, appoints the Kadkhudas. Kadkhuda .—Formerly there were 10 Kadkhudas Kalan in the tract to the north of the Band-i-Seistan, but all these are now Kadkhudas Kurd except M add at Khan of Deh Ibrahimabad. The 10 Kadkhudas Kalan received an annual allowance (yoazlfd) for entertaining strangers of 300 kharwar —half wheat and half barley and 3,000 krdn, which was divided among them in different shares. This allowance was discontinued some five years ago (about 1899), but each Kadkhuda now takes a contribution from the cultivating ploughs for entertaining strangers as follows + About 15 English lbs. 10 to 20 man Afghani^: of wheat or barley— 4 to 5 man Millet. 50 to 60 This is a village expense ... ... ... Melons, rather than a cultivator’s expense.[Chap. XVIII. 128 Each small village has its separate Kadkhuda Kurd, appointed direct bv the Hakim of Chakhansiir. The fine on entry locally called shinni is paid on appointment, but no further exactions of the nature of shirini are made and the kadkhudan* remains in the family descending to the son or to a brother so long as the family are capable and give satisfaction. The Kadkhuda receives a coat or lungi on his appointment to the village. * If the village is being started, the Hakim of Chakhansiir furnishes a hashar t.e. } a gang of labourers to make the canal; nothing is charged for the labour, it is supplied from the ghami cultivators of the district. The hashar will do only such work as is beyond the powers of the cultivators to do, such as excavating the larger canals or making the band on the river. The cultivators must make the small channels. The Kadkhuda distributes the land to the cultivatprs at the time of sowing the spring crops, and the cultivator retains possession of the land till the autumn crop is harvested, and cannot be removed by the Kadkhuda at the end of any crop as in Persian Seistan. The lands are not necessarily redistributed every year ; in some villages the distribution is only made each year if the cultivators wish it ; otherwise the plough continues to cultivate the same land for a succession of years. The cultivator has a right of appeal to the Hakim of Chakhansur, whereas there is no appeal from the orders of the Kadkhuda in Persian Seistan. The organization of the ploughs is the same as in Persian Seistan, but there The organization of the plough. 'P, ®P e , cial P a S avi iuftgao, nor does the Kadkhuda get any cultivation done by hashargao, though cultivation by kashargao is done for the Hakim of Chakansur on those lands which he cultivates himself. The Hakim supplies the seed and the ploughs work for one or two days and sow one to one and-a-half kharwar of wheat or barley; this is an area of from 1 ^ to 22 acres. The hire of plough bullocks is not paid for, but that of the thrashing bullocks is paid for at the usual rates, as this is considered too large an item of labour to take free. Such cultivation is also done in the sowing of the autumn crop. Kaushai. The kaushai in Afghan Seistan varies from 10 to krdn a cultivator ; but as the amount of kaushai increases, the proportion of the produce allowed to the cultivator is decreased. In one village, where 1 2 krdn kaushai was paid, only one-third share of the net produce left to be divided among Badar and Bazgar was allowed to the cultivator of the plough ; whereas, if only 6 krdn were paid, one-half the produce was divided among them. There is no fixed rule • it would seern that the risks of the cultivation is taken by the man who supplies the seed ; this from his wealthier state he is able to do, and he therefore pays the Bazgar cash down at sowing time, and takes a larger proportion of the harvest On the old established canals of the Riid-i-Seistan the risk of loss of crop from floods, or deficient supply, are so small that kaushai has almost disappeared whilst the labour and seed take an equal share of the produce. On the canals along the river from the MiTabad to the Khwabgah canal, both included the kaushai vanes only from 25 to 30 krdn a Bazgar, whilst the share of the produce is fixed at one-sixth of the net produce of cultivation that remains over to be divided amongst Badar and Bazgar. Kasht Kalgiri. In Afghan Seistan the kalgiri\ cultivation done by the poor relations of the kadkhuda is allowed as in Persian Seistan. But another form of cultivation, also called Kalgiri, is that conceded to the Bazgar of a piouah in that each Bazgar is allowed to sow 2% sangt man (i6£ seers Indian) of &amp; seed j * In March 1904 the talk of the country side said that all .. u u jn 5.1 been recalled and given back their old villages to cultivate; it was also said that thev^a^heTn'^^ that they would not be removed from these villages but would retain them. * * ' V H d b aS3Ured t In Afghan Seistan a-Ka/giVW is also called a Bogrikar.

He finds the seed himself or borrows it from the Badar and repays it at harvest without interest. The Kishtgar has nothing to gain by doing kalgiri for himself ; he takes, however, a share in the Bazgar’s Kalgiri to protect his interest in the general cultivation of the plough just as is done in the Sanjarani tract which see page 149. The hire {gardani) of the plough bullocks that plough the kalgiri land is some times paid for by making the owner of the plough bullocks a shareholder in that cultivation of the plough. He furnishes the seed for his share of the cultivation. Kasht-i-Sarjui. —On the canals from Mirabad to Khwabgah (inclusive) a concession, called Kasht-i-Sarjui, is allowed to the cultivator, in that the canal banks may be planted with the Badar’s seed, but the cultivator takes the profit. The seed is sown with a tesha and the corn is probably thrashed by the cultivators, and the produce after paying the government share of one-fourth is divided among them, no share being given to the Badar or to the owner of the bullocks of the plough. This cultivation has, however, to pay kharmani or kharwari\ that is, the deduction for the salary of the tahwilddr who takes charge of the grain. The Revenue in the Delta tract of Afghan Seistdn. The Revenue taken in Afghan Seistan differs materially from that taken in Persia ; the latter take one-third of the divisible produce of the thrashing floor after allowances for certain government officials have been deducted ; but in Afghan Seistan only one-fourth of the divisible produce is taken, although the same deductions are allowed. The method of dividing the grain produce of the thrashing of wheat and The method of dividing out the grain heap in barley is to begin by measuring out four the wheat and barley harvest. equal heaps from the grain heap until so much grain is left as is estimated will suffice to pay the allowances of the officials which government recovers from the cultivator. 1 his heap is called the ; these expenses of the cultivation are often called the Sarkut, a word not used on the Persian side of the river. The following are paid from the Ghalla-i-Sarkut or briefly Sarkut. Khar- . T ,., , D ... vuari. Mushriti. Mirzai, allowances to i In literate Persian Kilgardani. , ’ . . ' ’ ' . . 7 blacksmith and carpenter and Kailgardant.\ The government themselves take half the allowance paid to the blacksmith and carpenter, and the whole of the allowance for Kharwari and Kailgarddni. Any surplus or deficiency in the Ghalla-i-Sarkut is equally distributed over the four heaps. The four heaps are thus divided. The Government take one heap as their one-fourth share of the net produce after paying the allowances for government officials. The second heap of grain is then used to pay the expenses of culti vation such as gardani, tahpdi, allowances to individuals, carriage of govern ment grain. If there is any excess or deficiency on this heap, it is equally dis tributed over the remaining two heaps, which are distributed as follows. On the Mirabad, Kala-i-Fath, Deh Mirak, Deh Dost Muhammad, Khoga and Dak-i- Dila canals the Bazgar take the half of one heap ; that is, they get one-sixth of the produce after the Sarkut and the government share has been paid. But on the canals to the north of the Khogah (Khwabgah) canal the share of the Bazgar varies inversely with the kaushai which they receive. The whole of the fourth heap and the remainder of the third heap is taken by the Badar ; that is they get the balance of the produce after satisfying all claims In short the Bazgar obtains a varying proportion of the produce, but usually about one-sixth after all the expense of cultivation and the government claims have been satisfied, and the Badar take the balance. Expenses of cultivation. The expenses and the allowances connected with cultivation will now be noted; they differ in a small measure from those in Persian Seistan. [C639FD] LL[Chap. XVIII. Gardani .—The hire of plough bullocks is paid for at 40 per cent, of the seed sown, not at 30 as in Persian Seistan. During the time of ploughing each pair of bullocks are given half a man sang (34 seers Indian) of ardawa dai y by the Badar and Kishtgar. The Bazgar look after the bullocks. The ire of plough bullocks for the autumn crops is paid for the same as in Persian ^enstan by one-eighth share of the net produce of the melon crop and one-tenth share of other crops. Tahpai.—T\\e hire of thrashing bullocks is paid for in the same manner as in Persian Seistan, and may be taken at 2| per cent, of the grain outturned. 1 he grain eaten by the plough bullocks at the thrashing floor may be assume to be 60 man sang, the same as in Persian Seistan. Chungi was formerly allowed, but now it is only given in a very few villages. The all refuse to allow chungi pahlavt. Pah am 18 allowed to the cultivators though some green corn no doubt is stolen and parched. But the blacksmith, carpenter, barber and pdkdr are allowed 5 handfuls^ each which will yield to each man about one man sang (6-|- seers Indian) of grain. The hire of labour {daraugar) to cut the harvest is paid for at the same rates as in Persian Seistan. Kalaki .—The following kaldh are given— Each Bazgar or Kishtgar one ; and each blacksmith, carpenter, pdkdr, mushrif two kaldk of 5 man kru (165 seers of Indian) of grain. But in 1903-04 none was given to the last named individual, as the rust had greatly reduced the yield of the crops. In all 12 kaldk containing 60 man kru of grain where there are 6 Bazgar on the plough. Khaki wa .2W--This is an allowance only made from the Badar to the Bazgar; it is based, as has been explained on page 78 of Chapter XI, on the idea that the grain of the heap next the soil is given to the Bazgar. A Kishtgar since he cultivates his own seed makes no allowance of khaki 'wa zang to himself. On the canals from Mirabad to Khawbgah khaki iva zang is paid at the rate of 12 to 15 ^ for each Bazgar. North of Khwabgah about $0 man kru is paid per Bazgar, but in bad years this is reduced to 20 man kru. Khaki wa zang is seldom or never given on millet, but always on wheat and barley. The Govern^ ment do not allow khaki wa zang now, whatever may have been the custom in previous times, and it is now only given, as has been said above as an allow ance, from Badar to Bazgar.

There are 10 Khatib from Rudbar to Chakhdnsur. The Kadkhuda takes from 20 to 10 man san% from each plough according as the wheat or barley crop is a good one or not. The cultivators are treated more leniently than in Persian Seistan, as much of the tract is newly settled. The Government take half the grain paid to the blacksmith and carpenter, and ajl the grain to the k harm an kash and the kaiigarddn\ the latter is the individual who measures out the grain when the produce of the thrashing floor is divided. The tax of half of their grain recovered by government from the blacksmith and carpenter is said to have originated in the time of Sardar Ibrahim Khan, Sanjarani, to whom the blacksmith and carpenter went to bid against each other to secure the monopoly of the village work. When the Sardar realized how great were the profits that they made he took half, and said that if the remainder did not support both trades, the one least required could be dispensed witfn It is interesting to notice that the whole of the grain of these two individuals is allowed from the Sarkut ) and not that only which government takes. Of the above allowances the following are paid from the sarkut or the grain from which government takes no share. Blacksmith, carpenter, kharnoari or kharmdni } mashrij, Kailsarddni y mirzai. The remaining allowances are paid from the grain after the Government share has been removed, viz., kadkhuda, mirdb or pdkdr, barber, khatib, khishtmdl, mashkdr. The expense of feeding the mashrifxs arranged for in much the same way as in Persian Seistan. The average cost of his food per year per plough is 5 to 6 krdn. As the government take the grain recovered for his pay, it is probable that the cultivators give him some grain before he leaves the village, but if so, it is not given from the thrashing floor, but out of good will. An item of 10 man sang may be estimated per plough for miscellaneous payments made at the time of dividing the produce to various individuals not already enumerated, who consider they have a claim on the generosity of the plough and turn up at this juncture to urge it. Carriage of government grain in Persian Seistan is paid by Government Carriage of government grain. ^ in Afghan Seistan the grain has to be delivered to the Tahwildar at Nadi i-Ali or Kala-i-Kang, and the carriage to that place must be paid from the grain of the Badar, Kishtgar and Bazgar according to their share of the produce ; it is not paid from the sarkut. The Tahwildar therefore takes one man for every ten 7nan of government grain to pay for this carriage. So the government take a quantity of grain equivalent to nearly or per cent, of the grain outturned to cover the cpst of carriage of the government share of the produce cf the plough. In addition the cost of the carriage of the grain taken as naziri, kailgarddnr, as well as that taken from the blacksmith and carpenter, is also recovered from the Badar or Bazgar. The cost of the carriage of the government share of the ghamdar kalgiri grain is recovered from the Bazgar. The grain deductions made to cover the cost of this carriage is placed with the Kishtgar and Bazgar, and they are responsible to deliver the grain at Kala-i-Kang. They doubtless arrange for the carriage among themselves and the cattle owner, and so the grain comes back to them as a source of income otherwise earned. The grain pits {kurg) and the ambarchi are arranged for on the same terms Grain pits&gt; as in Persian Seistdn ; that is, if the grain is stored locally, but, as a rule, it is all car ried to Kala-i-Kang and stored there in charge of the garrison.133 CHAPTER XIX.

The Revenue officials in Afghan Seistan differ somewhat from those in Persian Seistan. The highest Revenue official is the Hakim of Chakhanstir, who transacts his revenue work direct, and has with him a Sarishtadar, who keeps the record of what goes on, and sees that the Hakim’s orders are carried out The ijdraddr receives a written order and his name is entered in the books ; if the ijdraddrt\nvks he has a good contract, he will be generously disposed towards the Sarishtadar. If no ijara is let, a special man is sent out to divide the produce of the village. There is no Sarmasharif so called, but there is an individual called a *. c . , Khirmankash, who attends to divide the gram heaps. Government makes a deduc tion from the produce for his salary, which is called Ndzin* and some times Kharwari, i.e.j the grain for the man who weighs out the grain or Kharmani i i,e.j the grain for the man who divides out the produce of the stack or harvest. There is a Tahwfldar who resides at Kala-i-Kang where the grain is stored under charge of the garrison. He takes over the grain from the ijdraddr ox direct if no ijdra has been given. He is also called a godamdar. There Is no customary mahmani given to the Tahwildar by the cultivators, but as he has charge of the measures by which the grain is taken over, it is usual to give him something. The Sanduqdar lives at Kala-i-Kang and takes over the cash payments from the ijdraddr. He, like the Tahwfldar, receives no allowances from the cultivators. Sanjistgar.-—These are 3 or 4 valuators, usually reliable kadkhudas chosen for the crop, who are sent out at the time the wheat and barley crops are about to ripen to inspect and report on them; the Hakim is guided by their reports in fixing the amount of the ijdra. The Mirza is appointed for the occasion by the sarishtadar to keep the ac count of the grain outturn of the ploughs at the spring crop. If he happens to be a Government servant, the allowance made him by the ploughs is taken into account when paying him his salary. The Mashrif is appointed from among the khasadar of the garrison either by the Hakim or his sarishtadar to look after the fields on which the revenue is to be collected direct by Government. He is paid by Government as a khasadar t but the allowance of 5 man kru per plough that is made to him he is allowed to keep. As in Seistan, he is led while in the village by the cultivators and is attend ed by the Mashkar, if there is one. But he is not paid cash instead of food, nor is he so generously fed as his confrere in Seistan. Formerly he received one kaldk at harvest, but this year (1904) the yield of wheat and barley was greatly reduced by mice and rust, so this kaldk was retrenched. If the collection of the govern ment share of the revenue has been farmed to a contractor he entertains his own mashrif, and himself takes the allowance from the sarkut of 5 man kru per plough. The Mashkar is appointed in the same way as in Persian Seistan. But he is only employed in villages from Mirabad to Khwabgah to guard crops near the homestead ; in all other parts of the village lands the cultivators themselves do the work of mashkar. No mashkar is kept in villages to the north of Khwabgah. When employed he is paid from 5 to 10 man sang a plough; the actual sum is usually fixed by contract. If the crops are good and the mashkar is well paid, he is expected to give the Kadkhuda a dumba (iat tad sheep} after each spring crop harvest. The fdkdr* used formerly to be appointed by the Kadkhuda Kalan, but since * in Afghan Seistan the is often spoken of most of these men have been abolished as the mirab. and only Kadkhuda Khurd are now made, the fdkdr is appointed by the Hakim of Chakhansur. He pays a shirini of 20 to G639FD MM*34 [Chap. XIX. krdn on appointment. The pakdr is not paid by Government, bu y t e cultivators who give him 5 man sang of grain from each plough—half wheat and half barley. The contributions of the grain produce at the autumn crop are not fixed, and vary with the disposition of the cultivators. There are the following pdkdr in this tract:— Khogah or Khwabgah Shoro ... Jarukhi ... Kang Dhin Muhammad Kala-i-Kang Ibrahimabad •«« Sikbsar Nad-i-Ali One. Do. Do. Do. Do. Do. Do. Do. The pdkdr is directly under the Kadkhuda and carries out his orders for the distribution of the supply and the collection of labour for canal and band repairs. Kotwal .—On the canals along the river from Mlrabad to Khwabgah on which the distribution of water is made by branches from regulators (aubakhsh) the Badar and Bazgar employ a kotwal to guard the aubakhsh and pay him one man kru per cultivator from the common grain at harvest. The Kadkhuda distributes the land in much the same way as is done^ by his confrere in Persia, but he takes no shinni from the cultivators. The cultiva tors have a right of appeal to the Hakim of Chakhansur and are therefore not so much at the mercy of the Kadkhuda as those in Pei^ia. The I jar ad art or contractor, who collects the government share of the village, is usually the Kadkhuda, but he may be some other person selected by the Hakim. As a rule, the contract for each village is separately let. In Statement No. 2 the result of the contracts let in each Tababa are shewn. It would have required another statement as long as No. 1 to have shewn each contract: had the year been normal, some useful information might have been got from such a statement, but it is hoped that Statement No. 2 gives all the information that can be got from this year. When the Government collects the revenue direct the method is called amani ; that is, on honour. The results of the collections made direct are shewn for each Tababa in Statement No. 3, and the actual and estimated divisible pro duce is shewn in Statement No. 4* Bdddr, Kishtgar and Bazgar are terms used in the same sense as in Persian Seistan. There are, as a rule, six cultivators to a plough, some of whom are Kishtgar and some Bazgar. The Bazgar may get his seed from one of the Kishtgar or from a Badar.CHAPTER XX. CONTENTS.

It will be useful to make the account of the thrashing floor in the same way as has been done in Chapter XU for Per sian Seistan. Seed sown and outturn. The seed sown by a plough in this part of Afghan Seistan is given in State ment No. 6. It is there shewn separately for the tracts under the Hakims of Kala-i-Fath and Chakhansur. It will suffice if the statements are made out for the latter tract only. It will be seen that the beghami and ghami ploughs sow practically the same quantity of seed, viz., 308 sang man, while the kalgiri beghami sow 22 man sang of seed. The statements will therefore be made out for 300 and 22 man sang respectively. The outturn of wheat and barley this year (1904) in this part of Afghan Seistan was very exceptionally bad; the rust did great damage to much of the wheat ; and mice eat both the wheat and barley grain, so that in this tract the seed is estimated to have only been returned to the plough 2‘5 times for wheat and 3‘o times for barley, whereas in a normal year the produce should be about times the seed sown on the average throughout. It will therefore be useful to work out an example for a ghami plough which sows 3 kharwar sang of seed and which has recovered an outturn of 83 times and ^ times the seed sown. It wall be sufficient to work out the account of one beghami plough which recovered its seed 8^ fold ; the results for the bad outturn can be deduced from the figures of a ghami plougfu An example of the account of a kalgirkar begham who sows 22 man sang of seed will also be worked out. Disbursements in corn before the division of the produce begins. The account may now r be made of the payments made in corn at the in gathering of the harvest. We may work this out for a divisible produce of 8^ times the seed sown. The kalgiri of the Bazgar may be omitted ; he doubtless takes some of the corn, but there are no legitimate deductions ; the produce of his thrashing floor should be the gross yield, less the small quantity of corn eaten by the thrashing bullocks— Cutting the corn five per cent, (say) cn the gross yield of the crop which may be assumed to be (2,422 5 plus 10 per cent.), 2,665 man sang ...

The Badar and Government get nothing from this expenditure, but the Baz gar receives 15 7 nan sang. The account of the Kalgiri Bazgar ; reheat and barley harvest. It will first be necessary to work out the kalgiri account of the bazgar, be- Kalgiri Bazgar. cause these profits are part of his’ income from the plough. To do this an assump tion must be made, for the bazgar alone of the cultivators of a plough does this kalgiri cultivation ; that is, sow^s a strictly limited area with his own seed, so that so far as that limited area in the plough is concerned, he is a kishtgar.[Chap. XX. 138 As has already been said, the class of the cultivators vary on ploughs ; some have all Bdddr, and Bazgar ; some have all Kishtgar, some have Bdddr and Kisht- gar and Bctzgar, this is perhaps the most common ; but it will be simplest to assume that the plough is worked by six Bdddr and six Bazgar. On a beghami plough the Kadkhuda represents the six Bdddr ) and each of his Bazgar does the same limited area of kalgiri as a ghanri bazgar. It has also been explained that the Bdddr to protect his interests takes an equal share of the kalgiri cultivation by furnishing the same quantity of seed as the Bazgar., In this way he profits equally with the cultivators in the extra pains that they spend on this area. It will not be necessary, however, to com plicate the account by showing this seed in the account. The seed sown to pro tect the interests of the Bdddr is part of the seed of the plough in which all share, but the seed sown by the kalgiri bazgar is seed of the plough in which the Bdddr gets no share. Each Bazgar is allowed to sow i\ man sang of seed, so that the kalgiri bazgar account of the plough will be for 15 man sang of seed sown. This cultivation done kalgiri is likely to produce at a little higher rate than the general cultivation of the plough, but not enough to complicate the account by introducing a different factor. The gardani is sometimes paid by allowing the cattle-owner to become a partner in the kalgiri by furnishing a like amount of seed as a Bazgar, but in this example it will be assumed he is paid 40 per cent, on the seed as usual. Kasht Sarjui. Kasbt sarjui will not be brought into the account, as it is only allowed on the canals from Mirabad to Khwabgah inclusive, and though a useful perquisite to the Bazgar of those canals, it is limited to that small tract and will probably soon die out. The Statements. The account of the kalgiri bazgar is given on the next page ; and state ments for the division of the produce of a plough in the wheat and barley harvest, similar to those already given for Persian Seistan in Chapter XII, follow it. These statements need no further explanation here. In Chapter XXVII the results are compared with those got for Persian Seistan in Chapter XII and the Sanjarani Tract in Chapter XXIV.Chap.

This is the northern boundary of Bandar-i-Kamal Khan. The boundary of Deh Ghulam Haidar on the right bank of the river is five miles up stream of the Dak-i-Dila ruin, at a conspicuous mud pillar on a piece of Dasnt.

They first came to Garmsel from Baluchistan at the time that Shah Ahmed established the Durani power. At this period they annually frequented the left bank of the Helmand between Mala Khan and Rudbar under their Chief Abdulla Khan. This tract belonged to the Nurzai Afghans, but, having been some years previously devastated by Nadir Shah, was at the time of the Baluch occupation a deserted waste, as it is still at the present day, for the Baluch were mere robber nomads who lived here with their camels and flocks for eight months of the year only, in temporary booths or tents made of wicker frames of tamarisk called pcuas. but * “ Abdulla Khan appears to have been on good terms with the Nurzais ; his son and successor was constantly at feud with them ; * * In this time the Sanjarani extended their wanderings along the banks of the Helmand as far as the Chakhansur district * * * * Here they came to acquire a sort of position in the country, and changed their migratory life for one in fixed habitations. “ Jan Beg left three sons, viz., Nuwab, Islam and Khan Jahan.

Division of the tract among the Sarddrs. The land of the Saniarani tract is divided up among the present Sanjaram Sardars in the way now to be described. Rudbar canal lands. village of Rudbar, which comprises the lands along the left bank of the river from Lat to KalaA-Madar-i-Badshah, the cultivation of which is irrigated by the Rudbar canal, is divided equally between Sardar Muhammad Raza Khan, son of Sardar Kamal Khan, and Sardar Atta Muhammad Khan, grandson of Sardar Imam Khan, who were themselves the descendants of the two Chiefs who built the two forts at Rudbar mentioned by Dr. Bellew. To make the distribution equal the lands are divided by alternate branches of the canal to each Sardar, for a description of these branches see page 147 at the end of this Chapter. Saidar Muhammad Umar Khan, the brother of Sardar Muhammad Raza Khan, is allowed, however, two tahml ploughs of cultivation in Rudbar as a friendly act among these relations. There is no canal along the left bank of the river from Kala-i-Madar-i- Badshahto Kala-i-Jan Beg‘and*the grazing thereon is shared by the people of Rudbar and Chaharburjak. The lands of Chaharburjak extend along the right bank of the river from Puza-i-Sabz Kim opposite Kala-hHus- Chaharburjak canal lands. sainabad to Puza-i-Dasht opposite the Chigini ruins ; these lands are divided between Sardar Atta Muhammad Khan and Ghulam Haidar Khan, the grandsons of Sardai Imam Khan, who is said to have received the lands from Sardar Ibrahim Khan of Chakhansur, whose sister he married. The lands of both Sardars are irrigated from the Chaharburjak canal which has a main channel common to both Sardars for 15 miles from its head to Kala-i- Husainabad, where the water is divided into two branch canals which run sioe by side to Chaharburjak : the canal for Deh Ghulam Haidar then goes on to the end of the Sanjarani tract on the right bank of the river. Sardar Atta Muhammad Khan has the upper lands and Sardar Ghulam Haidar Khan the lower lands, the boundary dividing the lands of the two Sardars is on aline drawn north by west, from Dam*i-Kuhna about 1,000 yards down streams of Kala-i-Mir. The ownership of the Rudbar and Chaharburjak canals having been des cribed, the remaining canals belonging to Bandar.i-Nau and Bandar-i-Kuhna canal lands. ^ Chiefs are the Bandar-i-NaU and Bandar-i-Kuhna canals which irrigate the small pieces of culturable land on the left bank of the river from Chahar Shaklak, opposite Chaharburjak, to Kala-i-Afzal on the Trakii or Taraku trough. The boundary of this tract is at Kala-i-Jan Beg on the up-stream or eastern end, and at Puza-i-Dasht near Dak- i-Dila on the down stream or north-western extremity. These lands were taken by Muhammad Umar Khan on the death of Sardar Kamal Khan, whilst his brother, Muhammad Raza Khan, took Rudbar. The fort built by Sardar Kamal * In this description only the holdings of the leading Sardars of each family are given; the income of the younger brothers is, as a rule, derived from tahwil cultivation, which the head of the family allows then «Chap. XXI.] MS Khan which was in use when General Goldsmid and afterwards General Pollock visited it in 1872, was badly damaged by the flood of 1885, which sent a large volume of water dowm this trough. The Bandard-Kuhna canal to Kala-i-Afzal was also destroyed, and was not repaired for some years. In the spring ot 1903 the canal had a considerable and flourishing cultivation on it, but the s P nn S floods again destroyed the head reach of the canal which is under a high and difficult bank of the river, and receives the full force of the main current of the river in flood. The canal has not again been put into repair : the small area belonging to its tract cultivated in 1903-04 was irrigated from the Bandar-i- Nau canal. The repairs to the canal have been_ much delayed by the uncertainty about the revenue to be paid which wall be described below. The lands of Ashkinak and Khajo are irrigated from the main channel of the Chaharburjak canal. 1 hese lands were Lands cf Deh Ashkinak and Deh Khajo. at one time in possession of the Birokzai Edozai Baluchis, and their chiefs still live in these villages ; the headman, Shah Gul Khan, Edozai, died at Ashkinak in 1904. The Sardar’s share of the cultivation of these lands are divided between the Saniarani and Edozai. Shah Gul Khan took the Sardar s share of the revenue of Deh Ashkinak, whilst Sardar Atta Muhammad Khan takes the pul sarkhana or hut tax {vide Chapter XXV). In Deh Khajo Sardar Atta Muhammad Khan takes the pul sarkhana and one third of the^ Sardar s share of the revenue, whilst Sardar Shah Gul Khan took the remaining two-thirds of the Sardar's share of the revenue. Various chief men of the Edozai have tahwil cultivation in these two villages.

The Government Revenue m the Sanjaram tract. The Sanjarani Sardars used not to pay any revenue for these lands,^ but rendered a service of horsemen (sowars). Sardar Atta Muhammad Khan furnishes sowars, 15 of which go by turns for six months to serve the Hakim of Chakhansur. In the same way Sardar Ghulam Haidar Khan supplies 10 sowars, five of w r hom go by turns of six months to Chakhansur. Saroar Muhammad Umar Khan himself serves the Amir at Kabul. In the spring crop season of 1902-03 it was said that the grants to these Sardars had been withdrawn, and that they had been called on to divide the pro- duce, giving the usual one-quarter share thereof to government; but late in the autumn they were told that in the case of Sardar Atta Muhammad Khan and Ghulam Haidar Khan the government demand w’as waived, because they furnished sowars. But that Sardar Muhammad Umar Khan and Muhammad Raza Khan must pay, as they had no patent of remission. Whilst urging their claim to con tinue in possession of the lands revenue-free Sardars Muhammad Umar Khan and Muhammad Raza Khan endeavoured to raise the required revenue from their cultivators, but most of their cultivators left, and v\ent to cultivate the lands of the other Sanjarani Sardars, while some went to Persian Seistan and settled near Lutak. In September such wheat and barley crops as they had grown remained unthrashed pending the settlement of this question.t This w^as made about the end of February 1905 when the Hakim of Kala-i-Fath, Sardar Ayub Khan, went to Bandar, and divided the produce, taking the usual one-quarter share for &lt; government.

He is allowed two ploughs of cultrrat.on o{ which he pays no share of the produce to the Sardar. The Mtrab is his subordinate and he takes from him half the grain he receives from the cultivators of the plough. Each Sardar has his own naib. The Nazir who ke&lt;-ps the account of the grain received from cultivators and submits it to the Sardar, He takes over the grain at the division of produce. His duties corresponds to those of the Tahwildar. The Mirza writes up the revenue received from each plough, and at the time of dividing out the produce attends on the spot. The Mashtif guards the crops in the interest of the Sardar from the time that thev ripen until the produce is made over to the Nazir. He is appointed from among 'the sowars of the Sardar.

Since the Saniarani Sardars hold, or rather have until quite recently held Th, system of dis.iibu.mn of water a„d i»„d by this tract revenue-free, they are the Kad- branches of the canal. kkutia Kalan oi their cultivation, but they leave their business affairs very much to the agent described above as the Naib who does the work ordinarily done by a Kadkhuda They dfstr.bute the land for cultivation themselves through the Naib, and as the arrangements for cu t,- vation has many interesting points of difference from that in vogue in the deltas of Persian and Afghan Seistan, it will be described in detail. As in Seistan each village has its own canal, or perhaps it would be more correct to say each canal is a village; in Seistan the water of the canal is divided to the cultivators by turns called Mehruz. But in the Sanjaram tract the canal has branches arranged for the irrigation of each separate patch of culturable land, and the branches are divided among the cultivators by lots. Bdddr, Kishtgar, Juftgao, Bazgar and Kadkhuda Kurd. For reasons that will be explained more in detail in the next paragraph, on each branch of the canal the number of cultivators are, as far as possible, kept the same, but the exigencies of the ground may cause the number to vary a little ; as a general rule, there are from 8 to 12 Bazgar on each branch of the canal’ Each Bazgar’s cultivation is called a kulba, and each plough’s cultiva tion is called a juftgao or a tak ; usually four Bazgar unite to work the plough, but in some years the syndicate consists of only two or three men; the Sardar of the canal decides each year what will be the most convenient number of men to work the plough with reference to the amount of work to be done on the canal, and on clearing jungle from the land. In these notes it will be assumed that there are always four men on the plough. But it should be clearly under stood that in the Sanjarani tract the number to work the plough is decided each year for each canal and varies, being either two, three or four. For each plough of 4 Bazgar there are from one to four Bad&amp;r, and on an average there are probably one Badar for every two Bazgar. There are no Badar, who have more than one plough so far as could be ascertained. Each branch water course has a kadkhuda kurd from among the Badar.Chap. XXI,] *47 Distribution of the 'water of the canal. The quantity of seed each cultivator may sow is regulated to be the same. The canal is divided into branches, and the supply to the branches is gauged by the number of cultivators on them, each of whom is expected to sow the same quantity of seed, or as we would say area. The distribution of the water from the canal to the branches is made very scientifically by weirs, so that each branch may take a discharge proportionate to the number of Bazgaron the branch. The place where several branches take off is called an aubakhsh or regulator. The weirs are made by spreading tamarisk mats on the bed and sides of the branch at its head ; the tamarisk mats on the sides are held up by stakes, while a piece of tamarisk cut by the village carpenter to a rectangular shape serves as a board to form the sill of the weir. If two or more branches take out side, by side one continuous piece of board forms the sill of them all, so that any tampering with the head of one may be detected by an alteration on the heads of the other branches. The sill is kept at the same level, and the same depth of water passes over the sill into all the branches. The irrigating capacity of each branch is altered by altering the width of the sill. The cultivators of course know nothing about volumes of water, but they understand the irrigating capacity of water, and they therefore adjust the length of the weirs, so that the irrigating capacity of the branches may be all the same. The correct lengths of the weirs are obtained tentatively; the Kadkhuda accompanied by the village carpenter makes the weir the length that he believes will be correct after allowing for the number of Bazgar on each branch, the length* of the branch and the height of the land to be irrigated with reference to the supply level in the canal. As a rough rule, one to two nakhun (finger’s breadths) are allowed for each Bazgar. If there is any doubt, the water is made t:o flow in the branches, and the area of land watered by the different branches in a day is compared to see if it is correct. If not, the weirs requiring alteration are attended to. The area is noted in langar, or the area that can be sown by one plough in one day. So far as is possible all their canals are so made that all the water-courses may run continuously, and this is generally possible, as the canals on the river take out from branches of the river which themselves come from above natural weirs, so that by closing the branch of the river by a dam at the place where the canal leaves it a good supply is usually obtained. If the river is abnormally low, a weir or even a damf is built across the river at the place where the branch feeding the canal leaves it. If more land has for some reason been given out on the canal than its volume can irrigate, a rotational closure of the branches is instituted, but this is very seldom needed. The distribution of the supply in the branches among the Bazgar is made by rotational turns ; each Bazgar usually gets the water for two days and two nights. The supervision of the weirs on the canal is entrusted to the petty official, already referred to on the previous page and on page 134 of Chapter XIX, called the kotwdl, and he guards the weirs to see that they are not tampered with. This system of distribution works efficiently and all the canals from the Other canals along the river rvorked on the Kuh-i-Khan Nashin to Bandar-i-Kamal san.esystem, - ^ Khan were seen to have these weirs; and It is said that they are in use on all the canalsJ up the river towards Kandahar. The reason given by the^ people for working these canals on this system is that the land is relatively high compared to the level of water in the canal, and the land irrigated from the canal is in long narrow strips; if a system of distribution based on rotational turns were in vogue, much time would be lost in starting and stopping the water. In the present system high lands are left out of cultivation. It is interesting to notice that this elaborate system is worked on this part of the river by Baluchis who came from the arid Chaghai hills, and only settled in this tract as cultivators about 100 years ago. * It is said that the long branch of the Chaharburjak Canal for Deh Ghulam Haidar is allowed ii times itT S ” ar !L ^ e ^ ermine( ^ on couttt of cultivators to compensate for the greater distance the water has to travel. • t F rom July to September 1902 all the water of the Helmand was turned down the Rudbar Canal leaving the river dry below the dam made at the head of that canal. ' s JThe Dak-i-Dila, Mfrabad, Kala-i-Fath Deh Dost Muhammad, Deh Merab, or the Sabz Ghazi canals north of tsandar-1-K.amal Khan are also worked on this system. They are outside the Sanjarani tract, and the system of revenue on these five canals is practically the same as that on the canals of Jhe Delta north of the Khogah or Khwabgah canal. Except that the share of the grain received by the Bazgar is fixed as it is in the Sanjarani tract, and does not vary with the Kaushai as it does in the tract north or the ixhogah canal. The Khogah canal is worked by turns and not by branches, but the cultivators get a fixed share of the grain. C639FD QQI4 8 y CHAPTER XXII. CONTENTS. The organization of the ploughs for Cultivation.

T/ie organization of the ploughs for cultivation. Cultivators, begham and gham. The cultivation of the Sardar is the kasht tahml of the canal and is beg ham. The begham bazgar receive no kaushai, except those who have to supply the Sardar with fuel or mats of tamarisk for huts, and these receive 10 or 12 krdn as kaushai. The Sardars have a Naib at Rudbar and Chaharburjak. Each Naib is allowed to do one or two ploughs of tahwil cultivation. The Naib at Rudbar pays no share of the produce on the cultivation to the Sardar. The Naib of Chaharburjak, a very old man, named Fakir Muhammad, has two ploughs in tahwil, cultivation himself, whilst his son, Ismail, a youth, has one plough tahwil and his brother,* Sultan, also has one plough of tahwil cultivation. So that the Naib of Chaharburjak and his family enjoy four ploughs, taking all the produce themselves and sharing none of it with the Sardar. The cultivation of the Bdddr, who supply the seed, is the kasht pdgavi or kasht ghami\ that supplies the labour for canal clearances and band-making. As already noted, the bulk of the cultivation is done by bazgar ) who do the labour of ploughing and sowing the seed of the bdddr. Though there are a few kishtgar, i.e., men who cultivate their own seed. An even larger kaushai is paid to the bazgar by the bdddr than in the Delta tract of Afghan Seist&amp;n already described, and a correspondingly larger share of the produce is taken by the bdddr. The kaushai paid is seldom less than 25 to 30 krdn and the share of the produce taken by the bdddr is, as will be seen in Chapter XXIV, about four times that taken by the bazgar. In addition to the Kalgiri cultivation done by the poor relation of the Kad- Tr , Tr , .. 0 khuda which is similar to that in Persian a.it agin az s ar. Afghan Seistan, and which will be described later, there is a special form of kalgiri by which each pair of the bazaar of the plough, whether tahwil or ghanii, are allowed to do a langar, or one day’s ploughing of wheat or barley. In one day a plough will sow from 10 to 12 man kru (32-I seers Indian), enough to sow about -§- or y of an acre of land. For this cultivation the bazgar must supply their own seed, make the following payments from the grain :— They pay no kaldki t but at usual rates, say ... Tahpai ditto Naziri at 2 \% on the Sardar’s share of the grain, say Mirzai Mashrafi , ... Kailgardani included in Naziri and not taken separately on kalgiri. Man kru. 8 4 4 3 10 Total 29 After these allowances are given the Sardar takes ^ of the balance and the remainder of the produce is divided among the four bazgar. The bdddr should have no share of the produce in this limited area culti vated by the plough. But since the water for this area is derived from the branch water-course that irrigates the cultivation of the plough which he controls, and of the produce of which he takes the larger share, it is necessary that he too should have an interest in the kalgiri cultivation, as that part of the cultivation of the plough is sure to receive greater care from the cultivators than the rest. For this reason many bdddr become shareholders, and in such cases a double area, i.e., four langar of kalgiri cultivation is done • This Sultan is the guide, who went with the gallant Khdn Bahadur Mohi Dhin, out on to the Dasht-i- Margo.

The seed thus sown by the bddar is part of the seed he sows for the plough and is not extra thereto. The bazaar cut this kalgiri corn themselves and the produce of the thrash ing floor should therefore be 5 per cent, above the average on this account alone.

He takes no other allowance from the Badar or Bazgar. there is no giving or taking of shir ini in this tract. Kasht Kadkhuda Kurd .—He appoints Kadkhuda Kurd from among the Bdddr to oversee the cultivation on each branch canal; the cultivators on a branch are usually all of the same tai/a. The Kadkhuda Kurd is allowed by the Sardar to do the cultivation of onef Bazgar in kalgin ; this Bazgar is begham. This cultivation is called kalgiri kadkhuda kurd and is always situated on the same branch water-course as the cultivation of his plough. An exceptionally influential Kadkhuda Kurd may be allowed to have the cultivation of two Bazgar begham, that is, two kulba as kalgin. From this area he makes the following allowances as kalaki, which are of course paid befoie the corn is threshed : — 2 Jcaldk to his begham Bazgar. 2 „ to the blacksmith. 2 „ to the carpenter. When the corn is thrashed, the following allowances are paid from the grain heap by the Kadkhuda Kurd :— r J Man kru.

XXII. i From the balance of the produce of his cultivation after paying the fore going, the Bazgar is paid one^sixth and from the balance then left the Sardar is paid one-tenth, the remainder the Kadkhuda Kurd takes himself. Ibis is some times called Nan-i-Kadkhuda, but it is quite different to the Nan-i-Kadkhuda allowed in Seistan to those Kadkhudas who supply sowars. Kasht Hashargdo. —The ghami cultivators of a plough collect together for two days and sow an area to wheat for the Sardar of their plough ; all the produce of this cultivation is taken by the Sardar. The Bdddr —The tract is distant from the Naizdr where the cattle-owners dwell, and it has therefore come about that the bdddr either ow r ns his own plough bullocks, or hires them from a bdddr who does. There is often a distinct difficulty in the valley to get bullocks for ploughing and thrashing. The bdddr takes, of course, the same share of the produce for the hire of his bullocks, that a cattle-owner would. If the bullocks are hired, the bdddr gives each one man kru of ardawa (crushed barley) a day, and one bag of bhusa (about 25 seers Indian) for each pair of bullocks. The bazgar attend to the wants of the bullocks 3s in Seistan, The bdddr supplies the seed for the sowing as well as the iron for the bel or spade used here in place of the tesha (hoe), that is used in Seistan, tjhe material for the making of the sickles, and the iron for the iron work of the plough. The blacksmith is subsidised by the plough to do the labour of making and repairing the tools used in agriculture, but the material must be supplied by the bdddr. The sarukh is the cloth wrap used in Persian Seistan in which the corn is carried from the field to the thrashing floor. In this tract a net made of kirta grass, called a Juli, made by the bazgar himself, is used instead of a sarukh. The bdddr supplies ropes for the ■ juLi at a cost of about a half to one kran. The bdddr pays 25 io kran kauskai 2X the time of sowing wheat to each of the incoming bazgar j the outgoing bazgar have to repair the canal before leaving. The kaushai varies on different canals, but the share of the produce given to the bazgar remains the same, i.e. t one-sixth of the grain after paying the expenses of cultivation (sarkut). The bdddr has to allow the bazgar seed to sow the canal banks {kasht sarjui) ; he enjoys no share of the produce of this seed. The Bazgar, —There are never more than four* bazgar per plough in this *On page 146 it has been explained how in some tra»_t, because there IS much less govern- years the plough syndiSate consists of only two or ment WOrk to be done, and much less three bazgar. jungle to be cleared than in Seistan; though, on the other hand, the band and canal repairs are probably more harass ing as the season for floods in the river coincides with that for the cultivation of wheat and barley. As already said, each of the bazgar receives from 25 to 30 kran from the bdddr as kaushai as well as the seed, the spade and the sickle ; but it is his duty to supply the wood for the making of the plough by the village carpenter. Each pair of bazgar are allowed to do one langar of kalgir'i as already described. They are also allowed to sow the canal banks called kasht sarjui. The bdddr supplies the seed for this cultivation, but after paying the Sardar’s share the bazgar takes the rest of the produce. The allowances that the bazgar gets from chungi, pahlavi, pulgi will be found described in the following Appendix :— khaki wa -*)»Chap. XXII.] *53 APPENDIX. Expenses of cultivation in the tract under the Sanjardni Sarddrs. Garddni or the hire of the plough bullocks. The plough bullocks for sowing wheat and barley are paid for at the rate of 4 man kru per pair per day ; this grain is paid at the harvest from the divisible produce ; ordinarily a plough will sow 340 man kru of seed at the rate of ten to twelve* man kru a day ; so that • Early in autumn when the days are longer 12 the time of ploughing lasts about 20 days, man kru will be sown ; at the end of sowing only an( J garddni Would be 124 man krU. lo man hru will be sown. r _,, . Inis works out to about 40 per cent, of the seed sown, the same rate as is paid in the Delta tract. The Badar feeds the bullocks while they are at work on ploughing ; each animal receives one man kru of ardawa and each pair of animals one juwal (holding 25 seers Indian) of bhusa. The ardaiva would amount to 40 man kru for the ploughing. The Bazgar attend to the plough bullocks. In the autumn crops, after paying the cost of thrashing the millet and the cost of carriage of government grain, one-seventh or one-eighth of the balance is given to the owner of the plough bullocks. Tahpdi ) or the hire of hillocks for thrashing.—The hire of bullocks for thrashing wheat, barley or millet is paid at 2 man kru per bullock per day from the grain outturned from the thrashing. Examples worked out showed that the cost was practically 2-| per cent, of the net outturn, the same as in Persian Seistdn. The cattle employed in the thrashing are not muzzled, and are therefore not fed by the cultivators. They may be estimated to eat 90 man kru, arrived at as follows—9 oxen by one man kru for 10 days. Daraugari, or cutting the corn. —The same rates prevail here as in Persian Seistan, i.e., normally 5 per cent, of the wheat and 6 per cent, of the barley. The cultivators cut the autumn crop themselves ; labour is not usually hired for this work. Chungi.~-lr\ some villages two or three Chungal (handfuls) of corn are given to each cultivator each day; each of the handfuls when thrashed out give two or three sir kru of grain so that the cultivators get about 6 sir kru a day of grain, but the custom of giving chungi is dying out, and in many villages it is not given. Where chungi is given it may be estimated at 4 cultivators for 15 days at 6 sir kru a day, that is, 9 man kru of grain. Pahlavi. —The cultivators gather ears of green corn and parch them while at work in the fields ; this may be estimated at 6 man kru a plough, but no green corn is allowed to be taken home. No green corn is supplied to the Kad- khuda as in Seistan. Khaki iso a pulgi.—Khaki wa pulgi are two w r ords for the same thing, viz n grain admixed with sand. In Seistan the expression is khaki wa zungj zung being as explained on page 78 of Chapter XI, the grain that is left in the chaff, and only got by a second thrashing. From wheat and barley at the time of dividing the produce 15 man kru (485 seers Indian) is given to each Bazgar by the Badar. The Kishtgar being his own Bazgar of course neither receives or gives this allowance. No khaki wa pulgi is given from the autumn crop. Kaldki. —No Kaldki is given at the autumn harvest, but when the wheat and barley is collected at the threshing floor, the following kaldk are given:— Blacksmith from each Bazgar ... Kal&amp;k. ... I Carpenter ditto ... ... ... ... 1 Barber from the plough I Mashnf ditto ... I Each bazgar, whether begham or gham ... ... 2 Total from plough ... 18 [C639FD] SI*54 [Chap. XXII. From a kaldk 3 man kru of grain is got. If no kalaki is given, then 3 man kru of grain is given from the produce of the thrashing floor before any division of produce is made. The grain expended in kaidki is then 54 man kru. Carriage of the Sardar's share of the grain. The carriage of the grain from the thrashing floor to the pits {kurg) of the Sardar is not paid for by the cultivators as in the Delta part of Afghan Seistan already described, but the Sardars make their own arrangements to carry the grain. This is usually done on their own animals, and no expenses need be charged to the grain account for this item. Grain pits.—The grain pits for the Sardar’s and the Badar’s grain are made and filled by the cultivators. The Sardar’s grain is stored at head-quarters and the grain of the Badar at the homestead. Ambdrchi.—An Ambarchi is entertained to guard the grain pits, both by the Sardar and Badar ; he is paid 2 man kru a kharvjar kru when the grain is removed from the pit. As a rule, however, the Sardars remove their grain directly to their head-quarters. Mashkar and sabzwan. —In this tract mashkar are not appointed; the cultivators look after the standing wheat and barley crops themselves. But during the time the autumn crops are ripening the cultivators have to repair the damage done to the canals by the spring floods, and they therefore appoint a sabzwan to guard the autumn crops. He is paid in some villages one-seventh, in some one-eighth of the melon crop after the hire of the plough bullocks has been paid, and from one-tenth to one-twentieth of mash, mdk or millet after the hire of bullocks used in ploughing and thrashing has been deducted. For a large crop one-twentieth is paid and for a small one-tenth. Rishta Grm.—No tax corresponding to rishta gdvi, or the tax on cattle employed on thrashing corn, is made in the tract controlled by the Sanjarani Sardars.156 Method CHAPTER XXIII. CONTENTS. Division of the produce of a thrashing floor. of dividing the gram—The Sarkut—Gram payments made from the oarkut—Division of the grain in the autumn harvest.CHAPTER XXIII. Division of the produce of the thrashing floor. Method of dividing the grain. —The method of dividing the grain on the thrashing floor differs very much from that in vogue in Persian Seistan described in Chapter XI, and Afghan Seistan described in Chapter XVIII, and merits detailed description, because it is probably the system by which the Sanjarani, Nahnii and Shahraki Sardars divided the produce* in the delta while they ruled large parts of it. The Nazir divides out the grain and collects the Sardar’s share; the Sardars never let out the collection of the revenue to contractors, but always collect it through their own establishment. The procedure to effect the division of the produce is to first measure out the grain into six equal heaps with a rogez\ till it is seen that the grain left in the original heap is only sufficient to pay the expenses of cultivation. This is the heap called the Ghalla-i-Sarkut, or simply Sarkut \ the mean ing of the word is probably derived from the way the heap comes about, sar being great or chief, and kut division. In the delta tract of Afghdn Seistan, described in Chapter XVIII, the sarkut is that part of the grain, which is set aside for those expenses of the plough of which government bear their share. The word is not used in Persian Seistan, but there too much the same expenses are allowed from the plough before government take their share. The Sanjarani Sardars, however, allow all the expenses of the plough except seed, kaushai and the cost of implements to be paid from the sarkut. The payments from the sarkut are first made. If there is any surplus or deficiency, it is divided out to or made up from the six heaps already formed. One of the heaps is then given to the Bazgar to be divided among them as their share of the divisible produce. The Sardar takes a half of one of the remaining heaps, or one-tenth of the produce after paying the sarkut and the Bazgar; this leaves 4J heaps to be divided among the Badar, or ^ of the divisible produce after paying the sarkut and the Bazgar. It will thus be seen that the hdddr take 4! times more grain than the hazgar^ whereas in Seistan the hdddr and hazgar share alike. But in this tract the kaushai paid is from 25 to 30 kran^ whereas in Seistan it varies from nil to about 5 kran per hazgar, and the hazgar having been secured against risk of loss by a cash payment made at sowing time naturally receives a smaller share of the grain. i The people always say that kaushai is paid in consideration of the labour given for canal and band repairs. But this is only the case in Persian Seistan ; in Afghan Seistan the hdddr, as a capitalist, guarantees the cultivator a minimum return from the cultivation. * The people in Persian Seist£n, when describina: the division of the produce, say that before Amir ’Aiam Khan, Hashmat-ul-Mulk, came to Seistdn, the payments for gardani, tahpai and menjals were first made and the balance divided into three heaps * I for the government. 1 for the cultivators. 1 for the badar. Now the division is said to be into three heaps— I for the government. I for cultivator and bdddr. 1 for the rasumat, i.e., expenses of cultivation. This is the description usually given by the people; it is of course general and overlooks small details. tit may be explained in passing that to measure out the grain of the large heap of the plough, a sieve called locally rogez is used ; this forms a very convenient large wooden measure holding S man kru of grain • occasionally a rogez large enough to hold 10 man is made. The small stack of grain outturned by kalgiri cultivation is measured for division in a man kru measure (3^ seer Indian aboutj. * [C639FD] j-j*158 [Chap. XXIII. V Grain payments made from the Ghalla-i-Sarkut cf the spring harvest. as follows :— The payments made from the Ghalla-i- Sarkut on wheat and barley cultivation are Gardani* or hire of plough bullocks, 4 man kru per pair of bullocks per day of ploughing; 20 days at 4 man kru per day Tahpai,y or hire of cattle to thrash, 2 man kru per ox per day of thrashing, say 10 oxen for 4 days, at 2 man kru Blacksmith per plough of 4 Bazgar Carpenter per plough of 4 Bazgar Barber 10 to 16 man kru, say an average of Priest and Mu lid, 20 to 25 man kru, say an average of Mirdb, 20 to 30 man kru, say an average of ... ...

They, however, distribute khairat (charity) among the Khatib, the Mulld and the' poor. This charity is expected to be one-tenth of their share of produce of the tahwil plough. In the Sanjarani tract, and, in fact, throughout Afghan Seistan, a tenth of the net produce is given in charity. The payment to the priest and Mulla represents the charity of the plough. Division of the grain in the autumn harvest. —When the division of the pro duce of the autumn harvest is made, the hire of the bullocks employed in thrash ing {tahpdi), and the cost of the carriage of the government grain, are first paid. No allowances are made, such as are paid from the sarkut of the wheat and barley grain. The grain is then divided into 8 equal heaps in some villages, and 7 jn others. One of these heaps is paid as hire of plough bullocks (gardani\ and one is given to the Sabzwan; of the remaining six or five heaps, the Sardar takes one-tenth, and the balance is then divided into four equal shares, of which the Bazgar obtain one share, and the Badar the remaining three shares. The Sanjarani Sardars do not take any revenue from melons, but the Sardar Melons. 40 Blacksmith • •• • • * ... 15 Carpenter M irdb • •• ... ... ...

Worked out examples of the account of the outturn of the PLOUGH IN THE WHEAT AND BARLEY HARVEST. The seed sown and yield. We may assume that on each plough there are 4 Bazgar, whether tahwil or ghami, and each class of plough sows a like amount of seed. The seed sown per plough in this tract is on the average only 340 kru man, vide Statement No. 6 ; this is much less than in the Delta, even allowing that the ploughs are worked by only frds of the number of cultivators. The community is Baliich, who are graziers by hereditary instincts, and have not the same indus trious habits for agriculture as the people in Persian Seistan. The Sardars are lenient and are not pushing and ambitious ; the canals are therefore barely large enough to properly flood the lands under the system of irrigation in vogue. The training works at the heads of the canals are liable to be carried away by each freshet in the river, the season for such freshets being towards the end of the sowing time of wheat and barley. The examples are worked out for a produce of and five times the seed sown ; the former is the normal outturn, the latter is the average actual outturn of the year 1903-04 when the rust reduced the produce to only 5 times the seed sown on the average. The expenses of gathering in the harvest. The account of the grain that is expended before the corn is divided out is as follows :— Man sang. Cutting the harvest [daraugari] at, say, 5 per cent, of the gross yield of the crop, which may be estimated at 1,590 man sang when the yield in divisible produce is 8| fold Chunri if given ... ... ...

The cultivation of the Kalgiri Bazgar. The account of the kalgiri bazgar will be given in the first of the state ments at the end of this Chapter, as this forms unimportant part of the profit of the bazgar. For simplicity it is assumed that the plough consists of and bdddr, but there may also be khhtgar—mm who cultivate their owm seed. They [C639FD] uu162 [Chap. XXIV. of course do not sow kalgiri, as there is no difference in the profits of the two kinds of cultivation, though they protect their interests in the plough by placing a like amount of seed with the kalgiri done by the bazgar, if there is one in the plough. But it is not necessary to complicate the account to show thesodifferent methods of sharing the profits of seed and labour. The Sarjui Cultivation. The Bazgar are allowed to cultivate the canal banks with the seed of the Bd.dar in their own interest. The sowing is made with a spade {bel\ and this, as well as the reaping and threshing, is all done by the Bazgar. All the corn sown is threshed out, and there are no deductions for labour before harvest; but, on the other hand, the canal banks are not likely to yield so much as the fields, so the produce may be taken at the same rates as that of the plough. The seed sown averages about 12 man kru a plough and the produce for the two examples may be taken at 102 man kru and 60 man kru. The Sardar takes one-tenth of the produce, or 10 and 6 man kru respective ly, and the Bazgar divide 92 and 54 man kru among themselves. Since Cno. sarjui is sown with the seed of the Badar, the produce thereof has been deducted from his share of the produce of the plough. But perhaps the fairest way to have shewn the account would have been to assume that the Badar supplied extra seed over and above that sown by the plough for this sowing, and that his expense in this matter is confined to the 12 man of seed sown. Butin Statements Nos. 1 and 6 the seed sown by the plough includes the seed sown sarjui. So in the following statements the is treated as part of the sowing of the plough Statement of Sarjui.

The Sanjarani Sardars collect a hut tax on a count of houses made each year. The rate of the tax is 4 krdn on the following; kadkhuda khurd^ bdddr, kishtgdr, bazgar, merchant (mamldgar) t blacksmith, carpenter, barber, dyer (rangrez), pdkdr, ndzir, mashrif, shoemaker, miller (asia wan), kotwal, ambdrchi, and every owner of cattle or sheep, but his married son if not a malddr himself pays two krdn\ so also does every shepherd {chaupdn) and cow*herd (ckaupdngdo), whether married or not, provided he works as a herd. The widow (glva) is taxed two krdn but the Mulld is exempt. If a son marries and lives at home, he has nevertheless to pay the tax accord ing to the occupation he follows, for example, such a son of a bdddr employed as a bdddr would pay 4 krdn, but if employed as a bazgar, he would pay 2 krdn. The pul sarkhana of Deh Ashkinak and Deh Khaju is collected by Sardar Atta Muhammad Khan, but all the share of the produce of Deh Ashkinak, and one-third of that of Deh Khaju was taken by the late Sardar Shah Gul Khan of Khwaja Ali, who is head of the E^Dozai Babich, who are said to be Sahib Milk of the Ashkinak lands. Water mills for grinding corn. The Sanjaranis have never taken to the Persian wind mill {asia bad) for grinding corn; they use either water mills {asia ah) or hand mills {asia dast). No bullock mills {asia gdo) are used. A water mill is easily arranged along the •The old Arbab said there are ruins of a Helmand, whereas the wind is lighter and wind mill at Lat, but it was not noticed by us. i ess cer tain than in the Delta tract. There are no ruins of wind mills higher up the river than* Ka!a-i-Fath. There are two water mills at Rudbar and one at Chaharburjak and one at Deh Sardar Ghulam Haidar Khan to the south-west of Kala-i-Sabz. The cost of the two stones in Sardar Ghulam Haidar’s watermill is estimated to have been 120 krdn ; they were brought on camels from Kiih-i-Arbu. The stones are a' 6' in diameter and 3| w thick ; the height of the fall of the water through the mill is not much more than three feet. In 24 hours the mill is said to grind 60 man kru, i.e,, 4 maunds 30 seers Indian. For each 20 man kru of grain that is ground 3 man kru of grain is taken. There is a miller {asia wan) in charge of the mill, who gets \ man kru from each of the 3 man kru charged for grinding. The miller is fed by the person who brings corn to be ground. The Sardar takes the remaining 2| man kru. The miller is not paid anything on the grain of the Sardar that comes to be ground. Cattle-tax. The Sanjarani Sardars do not collect a sheep or cattle-tax in cash as is done in Persian and Afghan Seistan, but from each flock one male sheep, one man kru of wool and one man kru of ghixs recovered both from karari and firari flocks. The karari flocks are those which belong to permanent residents of the tract. The firari flocks are those that have come to stay only a short period; for further details please see page 209 of Chapter XXXVI.CHAPTER XXVI. CONTENTS. Special Remarks on the Cultivation in theSanjarani Tract. Maintenance and repairs of canals-—Sowing of spring crops—Following lands—Autumn or kkarif crops.169 CHAPTER XXVI. Special Remarks on the Cultivation in the Sanjar&amp;ni Tract* The Sanjarani tract lies in the gorge or trough of the Helmand river, which ... . , . ,. is very narrow : the canals are therefore long and cultivate a narrow ribbon of land. Since each village has a canal to itself, the canal frequently comes to an end at the boundary of the village just as it has attained a good command; the irrigation is then taken up by another channel, which has been struggling for some distance under the bank of the river to get command of its village at the upper boundary. Thus more channels than are really required must be dug and main tained with the result that the small population, the small area of land can support, has to spend much of its labour on canal repairs. To save excavation the canals lie under the river bank or in the bed of the river in their upper reach, and are seriously damaged in years of great flood, and suffer considerable damage in years of normal flood. The water of the river is turned into the canals by simple training bands* and spurs made and extended as required ; as a rule, these are begun as soon as the river falls so low as to make them necessary; this will be in the hot weather any time after the end of June, so as to insure a supply to mature the autumn crops. In 1903 this work was not required till September ; in 1904 it was required in July. When the autumn crops are matured and harvested the canals are closed for the annual silt clearance. If, however, the floods have been very great, the canal may have been blocked by silt or cut off from its head-works, and will need attention as soon as the labour has leisure from the wheat and barley harvest. The rains on the catchment area of the river come in the winter and freshets in the river may occur in abnormal years as early as November ; they commonly begin towards the end of December. If the rise in the river is enough to damage the canal head-works, the cultivators must turn out and make good the damage, or they will not get water to finish their sowings or mature their spring crops. In Seistan the canal head-works are secure, and once the Band-i-Seistan is made an ample supply is guaranteed. The lands are broad and the proportion of canal mileage to acreage cultivated not excessive. In Statement No. 8 the volumes and duties and some notes about the four canals belonging to this tract are given, from which it will be noticed that the duties are usually very good, due to the fact that the supply of water received from the river is restricted for the reasons already given above. It is the custom in this part of the valley of the Helmand to begin the Sowing Of spring rops. sowing of wheat at the _ first new moon niter the autumnal equinox, whereas in Seistan the sowing begins at the equinox or even a week or 10 days before. In early sown wheat (^5^from 9 to 12 man kru are sown per acre (say, 30 to 40 seers Indian), whilst in late sown wheat {kasht irah) from 15 man kru to 18 man kru (say, from 50 to 60 seers Indian) are sown. Whilst on the poorer lands more seed is sown. From Statement No. 1 it will be seen that on the average 13-6 man kru of wheat and I5'2 man kru of barley are sown per acre. The seed is scattered broadcast on the land {tukmsar) and ploughed in; no seed is sown by the method of the sower following the plough and dropping the seed in the furrow {tukm kal). The sowings in the valley are completed earlier than in the Seistan Delta ; the wheat sowing lasts two months, or to about the 10th of December, and the barley a month later, or about the 10th of January. The area put under barley is one-fifth of the whole area under wheat and barley. The people consider that each plough should cultivate about 30 to 40 langar ; that is, days of ploughing at each of which from 10 to 12 man kru of seed should be sown; this gives from 360 to400 man kru a plough, whereas the figures [C639FD] * See detail drawings among engineering plans filed. YY170 [Chap. XXVI. for the cultivation done in the spring crop of 1903-04 show that only on the Chaharburjak canal did the seed sown amount to 400 man kru a plough ; m Rudbar it was about 240 man kru a plough, and on the average the seed sown was about 340 man kru a plough—Statement No. 6. It is the rule in the valley, as in the Delta, to allow the lands to lie fallow (darisht) in alternate years ; but as the Fallowing lands. patches of culturable land are restricted in area, it often happens that a community make their huts on a patch of land and go on cultivating it for three or four years without giving the land any rest, until its fertility has become so reduced that it is no longer worth cultivating, t en compelled by this circumstance they go elsewhere. If the land is fallowed in alternate years, it seems to retain its fertility unimpaired. The system of fallow here is the same as that in the De ta, to sow the wheat and barley on the lands off which autumn crops ave een harvested, and after the wheat and barley has been cut to sow nothing till the following autumn crop. But wheat and barley are not sown on millet or maize fields. The area under wheat and barley is much greater than that under autumn crops, therefore much of the wheat and barley is sown on fallow land. Manure locally known as ambdr is not used, ihe lands near the village are usually put under barley, as they are then convenient to turn horses into to graze down the green barley and later on the stubble. Great quantities of camel thorn {khdr) grow up in the wheat and barley fields, as well as a stunted jand bush called chaghuk, which is said to grow only on the very best lands. The autumn crops are sown Autumn or Kharif crops. sown within the month. between the first and last day of April and except a little late sown melons and the mash and til (very little ever sown) are all The autumn crops are melons, millet, maize, mash and mak&gt; china (arzan) and very occasionally til (kunjad), cotton {kdlak) ; a very small area of tobacco is done in each village for local consumption. Mash is sown on lands that are flooded by the river in the spring floods at the end of April or beginning of May ; such lands are called Mdshi ) and are low lying patches of rich alluvial (warshufti) soil along the banks of the river.CHAPTER XXVII.

Comparison of the quantity of grain received from the normal produce of the plough hy the different interests m Persian and Afghan Seistdn and the Sanjardni tract. In the statement on the next page the share per cent, of the produce which , each interest takes in each of the three 1 he (jovernment. ,. rf , i • i i , dinerent systems by which the produce is divided is compared. In both Persian and Afghan Seistan some allowances are paid from the produce before the Government take their share ; most of these allowances are taken by Government themselves, but in Persia the Government themselves bear the expense of the carriage of the grain, whereas in Afghan Seistan this expense is recovered from the produce of the plough. So we see that the Government obtain a little less than their third in Persia, while in Afghan Seistan they obtain per cent, more than the quarter of the produce. In the same way, although the Sanjarani Sardar’s share is not really one-tenth of the produce, yet as they recover allowances from the plough for the pay of establishment, they nevertheless obtain a full tenth in the net result. The recoveries made for the establishment are in all cases so much in excess of the expenditure incurred that the recovery is practically pure profit. The Bdddr and Bazgar. — It will be noticed that in Persian Seistan the bdddr only receives about 17 per cent, of the profit, whereas in Afghan Seistan and in the Sanjarani tract he takes 25 and 35 per cent, respectively. In Persian Seistan the canals are so stable and the villages so long settled and comfortable that the bazgar (who represent the labour) share the risks of cultivation with the bdddr (who represent capital) and the profits of capital are accordingly less. In the other two examples the canals are in more precarious situations; the villages have only recently been established and are not at all stable, so the bazgar receive a large cash payment at sowfing time, and if the harvest turns out normal, the bdddr receives a correspondingly larger share of the produce to compensate him for the risks he incurred of losing this money. The difference between the per cent, of the profits of a bdddr of a ghami plough and that of a tahwil or beghami plough represents this kaushai paid. This should turn up again in the difference in the profits of the bazgar, and so it does in Afghan Seistan, but in Persian Seistan the quantity of seed sown by a tahwil plough is so much greater than that sown by a ghami plough that the profits of a beghami bazgar are greater than those of a ghami; this is because so much of the expense of cultivation is a fixed charge and the greater the quantity of produce, the less the per cent, charge under this head. The owner of the bullocks is paid quite 35 per cent, more for his cattle in Afghan Seistan than he is in Persian Seistan. The large number of bullocks that thrive in the Naizar quite close by the Persian cultivation no doubt accounts for the smaller sum paid for bullocks by these cultivators. The other expenses of cultivation in Afghan Seistan appear higher than in Persian Seistan ; this is chiefly due to the fact that the former sow a much smaller quantity of seed, and the allowances being a fixed charge bulk bigger in the results. The tahwil plough of the Sanjarani tract pays more in expenses, because 10 per cent, of the Badar’s share (in this case usually the Sardar) of the produce has been allowed for charity, and this exceeds the sum paid by the ghami\A0\1g\is to menials, etc., who are paid nothing directly by the tahwil plough. The account of the kalgzrkar is between himself, Government and the owner of the bullocks. The Sanjarani Sardars take a much smaller share of revenue from the kalgirkar than either of the Governments do ; but the expenses of cultivation are greater, because the allowances are on a higher scale than they are in either of the other two systems.176 CHAPTER XXVIII.

Miscellaneous sources of revenue in Afghan Siestdn, An account of the cattle and flock-owners will be found in Chapters XXXIII to XLI, and the estimate therein made of the income from taxes on herds and flocks gives the following figures:— Kran. Cattle- On the count of cattle now existing ... ' ... 9/521 On the number that probably existed before 25,000 or 30,000 the sickness.

Some say that the Saiyad families are charged six kran a family, but the Saiydds themselves say they only pay tax to Kadkhuda Muhammadi, the con tractor in Persian Seistan. Dyers are charged 5 kran a shop; there are about 26 shops. A marriage tax called nikah fooli is levied from the husband at the rate of 20 kran on the marriage of a virgin and 10 kran on that of a widow ; in return a nikah nama (marriage certificate) is given. Death duties are also levied to the extent of one-fortieth of a deceased person’s property. This tax is also called chihil-o-yak. Marriages and deaths are therefore concealed, and the collections on this account are said to be very small which is to be expected, as the people are very poor. The tax from court-fees is called Sakukdt, The custom duties from this district are paid into the Kandahar treasury, and no reliable estimate could be got of the value of the income from customs, • This probably mclodo, the percentage collect- but it _ is Said that 60,000* kran were col- ed on the sale of animals described in the chapters lected in the year 1 904 , in Spite of the fact on cattle and flock-owners. that collections are very difficult, seeing that the tract is surrounded by deserts which can be crossed in innumerable directions, and at night with ease. But it is said in explanation that in the last two years the trade with India has increased seven-fold. Of the 60,000 kran collected, only 15,000 kran are said to have reached the treasury, as that was the income expected by the officials there; the balance was concealed at an expenditure by the local director of customs of a few thousand kran on the Mirza in charge of the Kandahar treasury and other officials./ &gt; 7 8 I I CHAPTER XXIX.

In Statement No. 14 an estimate has been made of the Government share of the revenue in Afghan Seistan to compare with that made on pages 92 and 93 of Chapter XIII for Persian Seistan. As already explained in Chapter XVII, the revenue is paid into the treasury at Farah by the Sarishtad&amp;r; we have no infor mation what revenue the Government expect from the Kala*i-Fath and Chakhdn- sur districts. The only revenue known to be now assigned is that to the Sanjarani Sarddrs descended from Sardar Imam Khan. The first 5 lines of Statement No. 14 have been arranged to show how much of this assignment has just been resumed, and how much is still enjoyed by the Sanjaranis. The resumption is, as has been said on page 123 of Chapter XVII, very unpopular, and the cultivation will for a time be very small indeed and much less than here shown, as this cultiva tion was done in the hope of the appeal to K&amp;bul being successful. The cultivation in Tabdbd i-Kala-i-Fath has fluctuated very largely of recent years, as will be seen from the areas given in the Canal Statement No. 8. These canals have all been made in recent years, as will be seen from Appendix 36, and are in a very backward state of development. The figures for cultivation and revenue for the tract under the Hakim of Kala-i-Fath are therefore liable to sudden and great fluctuations. The cultivation in the tract in the delta of the Helmand under the Hdkim of Chakhansuris much more stable, and if the administration continues as efficient, as it is at present, is likely to expand. The canals irrigating Tabdbd -i-Nad-i-Ali have been connected to the Sultani canal, and this channel is capable of very large extension and the revenue from this tract should expand. In Statement No. 2 the results of the contracts let for the collection of revenue in each Tabdbd are given ; the year was an exceedingly bad one from which to estimate the value of contracts. Rust and especially mice did more damage in this tract than was done in Persian Seistan, so much so that there was very great difficulty to get wheat and barley seed to sow in the autumn of 1904. But the present Hdkim of Chakhansur has such an intimate knowledge of the district that he is able to frame very close contracts for the recovery of the Government share of the revenue, and it will probably be correct to assume that the cost is not much more than 10 or 12 per cent, on the value of the Government produce to be collected. In Statement No. 14 the produce has been priced at the rates current in Seistfm in the year 1904, and the value of the Government share at these rates is as follows :— Kean. From the Sanjarani tract • •• ... 24,241 From Tababa-i-Kala^i-Fath ... 54,547 From the Delta tract of the Helmand ... 375,765 From the Delta tract of the Khash ... ... ... 94,155 Total ... 548,708 Add Government share on tobacco ... 433 Total ... 549 ,Hi Deduct one-eighth (say) for the cost of collection ... 68,645 Net Revenue ... 480,496 At 3*67 kran to a rupee... • • • ...Rs. 1,30,925 At 55 kran to a pound sterling .,. ... ... f 8,736 [C639FD] BBBi 8 o [Chap. XXIX. A person, who had the knowledge from which to give a useful opinion, said that the Afghan Government normally realized 300,000 kran a year from the land revenue of this district; this would be the value of the Government share of the produce when the price of wheat was about one and-a-half man a kran. The annual miscellaneous revenue may be estimated as follows:— From cattle ... ... From sheep ... ... ... From shops, marriage, death duties and court-fees, etc., can only be guessed Custom duties ... ... ... Kran. 25.000 30.000 10,000 15,000 Total 80,000 or under Rs. or about 22,000 l M 5 ° Estimate of the produce available for export. The years in which the Mission was in Seistan were bad years for this particular tract ; the spring harvest of the year 1902 was moderate, and was mostly exported to relieve famine; that for the year 1903 suffered some damage from floods. The floods do more damage in this tract than they do in Persian Seistan, because the bulk of the tract lies nearer the main river; the damage done in the floods of 1903 was probably as much as one-fourth of the produce. The spring harvest of the year 1904 suffered great damage from rust and mice, as will be seen by comparing line 16 with line 18 of Statement No. 4, the yield being only about three-eighths of the normal ; little or no grain was there fore available for export. The spring harvest of 1905 promised to be excellent. The same calculation could be made for the amount of grain available for export, as has been made for Persian Seistan in Chapter XV, page 107. But we may notice (from the figures on page 112) that in normal years about one-half of the gross grain harvested and in bad years about one-sixth is available for export; furthermore the grain available for export in bad years is between one-ninth and one-tenth of the gross yield of a normal year. But in Afghan Seistan the density of the population is 1,013 per souare mile of cultivation against 586 in Persian Seistan, so that a larger proportion of the grain will be consumed in the country. From calculations made it would seem that we may safely take one-half of the proportions that obtain in Persian Seistan, i.e. s in bad years one-quarter and in normal years one-twentieth of the gross grain harvested in normal years as available for export. From Statement No. 9 on the annual resources of Afghan Seistan, irrigated from the Helmand only, the gross grain in a normal year is as follows:— &amp; Wheat Barley Pulses Millet Kharwar sang. * 4 , 77 * 5.422 90 1 &gt;734 22.017i8i Chap.

So that from both Persian and Afghan Seistan an export of nearly 10 lakhs of Indian maunds may be expected in good years and two lakhs in poor years.182 CHAPTER XXX, CONTENTS.

The annual resources of Afghan Seistdn. The annual resources of the tract irrigated from the Helmand is given in Statement No. 9, while that of the Delta tract irrigated from the Khash Rdd, and which is included in the Governorship of Chakhansur is given at the end of Statement No. 11 ; whilst the tract itself is described in Chapter XXXII, the figures for population on the Helmand and Khash Deltas are given in Statements Nos. 12 and 13. It will be noticed from Statement No. 9 that on the Helmand the agri cultural produce varies from 74 to 54 per cent, of the total annual resources, and therefore the animal produce is a more important part of the resources of the country than in Persian Seistan. The value of the crops per acre. We may examine the average value of the produce per acre of the crops grown on the Helmand River. The figures to be examined are given below:— Irrigated from the Helmand — Value of the produce of wheat and At rates in 1903-05. Value per acre in kran. At rates in 1897-1900.

Irrigated from the Khdsh Rud. —In the Delta of the Khash Rdd the seed is sown thick, because the sowings are made late, and the people say there is not time for the stalk to spread ; they also confidently assert that the soil is so rich that the number of times the seed is returned to them is as high, if not higher, than in the Nad-i-Ali tract. This is probably exaggerated, but the statements of normal produce and resources have been made for an outturn 8’5 times the seed sown. Therefore the value of an acre of wheat and barley is 87 kran, much higher even than in Persian Seistan, where the value is 80 kran. The value of an acre of autumn crops is 34 kran, and the value of an acre of both spring and autumn crop on the average is 84 kran. We have not examined this tract, and are not able to say of our own know ledge that the crops are really so superior as these figures indicate. The annual resources per head of pupulation. We may now examine the resources per head of population.

XXX. This is only about half the average sum that each person or each family in Persian Seistan receives ; and shews how much poorer this tract is than tie one across the river. The density of population per square mile. The area of lands suitable either for cultivation or grazing, or both, below Rudbar on the Helmand and Aleh on the Khash Rud, is about 600* square miles. These are the lands on which cultivation is done, and where the flocks and herds graze. The population supported on this tract is 68,905 souls, or 115 per square mile, whereas in Persian Seistan there are 108 per square mile. T. his tract in Afghan Seistan is much more backward than that in Persian Seistan,^as there is only a small area around Kalau-Kang, vhere the Hakim of Chakhansur till 1904 used to live, which is as developed as the large tract on the Rud-i-Seistan in Persian Seistan. Density of the population compaved with that in the Punjab and in Persian Seistdn. The density of the population (68,905) on the cultivated area (68 square miles) is 1,013 : on the culturable area (287 square miles) is 240 : on the gross area (4,159 square miles) is 16: and on the culturable area and Naizar (600 square miles) is 115. These figures are compared with those for Persian Seistan and with some districts in the Punjab in the following table :— Particulars. Density of population PER SauARE MILE. Punjab districts.

The density of the population for a square mile of cultivation shews how much less prosperous the agricultural classes are in Afghan Seistan than they are in Persian Seistan. The flock-owners form 2 per cent, of the families in the former and 2‘7 per cent, in the latter ; while the herd-owners form less than one per cent, in the former and 2*5 per cent, in the latter. * From Appendix X.

Jhe villages in the valley of the Helmand above the Sanjaram Tract. The highest point on the Helmand seen by any of the members of the Mission was the village just above the Kuh-i-Khan Nashin. In Appendix 19 is given (1) a valuable note by Captain Webb Ware on the revenue system in vogue in the villages visited by him down to Rudbar; (ii) a list of the villages up the river with the names of the leading men and tribes prepared by Khan Bahadur Mir Sham Shah ; and (iii) a list of the number of ploughs and families that used to live in these villages. This information may be of help to any one travelling along the river ; as a start from which to collect more accu rate information.'® . The revenue system above Rudbar differs a good deal from that m either of the tracts below Rudbar, though the system of cultivation and irrigation is much the same. Government take only one-seventh of the divisible produce and recover certain allowances! to cover the cost of the necessary revenue establish ment. The revenue collection, however, is usually levied for a term of years either in kind or in cash. It is said that only two cultivators are employed on each plough, because the labour on jungle clearance is less than it is lower down the river. ^ The quantitv of seed sown by each bazgar seems to be much the same, as it is in the Sanjarani tract, and may be assumed to be 85 hru man a bazgar on the average, or about 85 sang man a plough. If so, the average area done by one plough is only about twelve acres. It may be useful to notice here that it is not pos sible to determine the area sown from a list of ploughs, as the seed sown by ploughs in different parts of the country varies a great deal, the important item to discover is the seed sown. The people know the number of cultivators to a plough and the quantity of seed each should sow ; and when noting the number of ploughs it is essential to note this information also. The bazgar are allowed to sow sarjui and kalgiri bazgar as in the Sanjarani tract; on this they pay the Government revenue and the cost of cultivation and take the balance of the produce. The kaushai is said to be icj Kabuli rupees, as a rule. The bazgar get one-sixth of the produce after the Government share (one- seventh) has been paid, the badar takes the balance, but he has to pay the 70 man kru taken by Government for allowances, and all the other expenses of cultivation. On the autumn crop the Government collect no revenue on melons, but they take one-seventh of the other crops (maize, millet and pulses), the same as on wheat and barley. Maize is more grown than millet in these villages and wheat is preferred^ to barley ; that is, a less proportion of barley is sown than is usual in the Delta. I he usual small area of tobacco is grown, but very little or no cotton. In fact, the principal crops are only wheat, barley, melons, maize and some pulse. * Cultivators come from these villages into Seistan on business, and are always ready to describe their system of revenue and cultivation. We limited our detailed enquiries to as far up the river as Rudbar; even so the material collected was so large that there was a danger of its getting beyond our power to work it all up. / f It is said that a lump sum of 70 kru man is taken for those allowances from the grain of the Badar.

The Delta tract of the Khash Rud is under the Hakim of Chakhansur and Nature of the water-supply. forms an integral part of his Governorship. , The tract is locally known as the Tababa-i- Ghakhansur, and comprises all the area on the Khash Riid below Aleli and Kadda. T he cultivation in this tract receives its water from the surplus flood water of the Khash Rud alone ; the perennial flow of this river is absorbed by the canal for Lukhi, which takes out above the Band-i*Lukhi: There is a large area of land,® and all the cultivation is done at places con- Fertiiity Of the soil. taming very rich soil and having special . facilities for watering. The soil is therefore described as much richer than that of the Helmand ; or, in fact, any other soil in the deltas of the Seistan depression; and it may be so in actual fact as the cul tivation in the tract is large, considering the somewhat restricted nature of the water-supply. Unlike the Farah Rudf there seems to be no immediate danger of^ this flood supply being so utilized by canals up the river that cultivation in this tract will suffer. The cultivation in Tababa-i-Chakhansur depends on the water that comes T . f . down in flood ; in normal years this flood floes not arrive till the end of February or the middle of March J ; and in consequence all the wheat and barley is late sown. The cereals sown are, as has already been explained in Chapter X, page 57, Class of crops sown. special varieties^ suitable for such late f .. . sowings. These crops usually receive the lull number of waterings needed to mature them : they ripen in sixty days, the people say. The stalk of the wheat is very short and from one grain onlv about 5 or 6 stalks shoot up. But the normal yieldfj is said to be 10-fold and in good fields 15-fold. All say the outturn is better than that in the Helmand Delta in Afghan Seistan, The young wheat is not watered till it begins to look yellow; the final watering is given just before the ear forms. Only such autumn crops can be grown as will mature on the floodings, which are given to the land at sowing time with perhaps one watering made after sowing. So that we find the only autumn crops^f grown are millet, and melons;*® though on specially favourable spots a little til (sesame) may be grown. It is said that only the crops on the lands ff at the western exremity of the tract wnich lie near the mouth of the river and are lowlymg receive a watering after sowing, &amp; ru 1 uG r sa ^ ' m Sardar Ibrahim Khan’s time there w 7 ere three gardens at Ghakhansur, but only a few mulberry trees remain to mark their site.

From lines 9 and 10 column 19 of Statement No. 14.it will be seen that the estimated value of the Government revenue from Tababa-f-Chakhansur is one- fourth of that from the Helmand Delta tract. From line 13 of Statement No. 11 it would appear that in the year under investigation the contractors made a profit of 24 per cent, on the actual Govern ment share which they contracted to realise; it is believed, however, that this was entirely due to the loss from rust and mice being much less than on the Helmand, so that it was overestimated in selling the contracts ; the Governor of Chakhansur has managed the revenue of these tracts for about a generation and has an intimate knowledge of the revenue-paying capacity of each village, so that the contracts do not, as a rule, yield more than 10 or 12 per cent, to the contractor. * The bazgar takes one-fourth of the produce of wheat and barley after paying Government dues and all the expenses of cultivation including the carriage of the Government grain. The Badar takes the remaining three-fourths. It is said that in the time of Sardar Ibrahim Khan Saujarani the revenue system was much the same as in the Rudbar tract, but the Sardar took one-third instead of one-tenth ; the area cultiv tod was larger tnan it is now, but the Sardar was very slack and not more than one-sixih reached his granarie . f The Ghami Bazgar can be sent by order of the Hakim to do urgent work on the canals on the Hdmand. Sardar Sharif Khan took them to Gumbad-i-Yakdast to do some urgent work on the Kala-i-Fath canal, and in 1902 they worked on the Ju-i-Sultani. In 1903 and 1904 they worked on the Band for the Ju-i-Su!tani and helped to carry that canal across the Jharuki Shela. AH along the river in Afghan Seistan it is usual to turn out all labour available to do emergent work on canals other than those of the cultivators themselves.PART III.

XXXIII. on the lands which are flooded nearly every year, but the roots seem to survive a year of drought and spring up on the return ot the water. The rushes [tuzg) grow on the margins of the reed thickets and are most abundant in the direction from which the flow of water comes. 1 hey g r a ua J disappear as the reeds become more dense, just as the reeds disappear as the t becomes more dense. Passing on from the reed and rush beds towards the outflow of the river the dshkin is reached. These are lands on which the flood waters do not stagnate, but over which they move and eventually drain away into the Naizar. Such are the tails of the spill channels of the river. The name is derived from a rush, called ashk, which grows in great luxuriance at the Parian mouths of the main outflow of the river and its (the rivers) principal distributaries to the east of Nad-i-’Ali. In years of flood, like 1903, large volumes of water passed by the Shela-i- Tharuki and the Charkh to the south eastern end of the Hamun, and a luxuriant growth of asU sprang up on the western margins of the Chung-i-Darazgu. The ashk in its turn dies out as the beds of tuzg and nai are reached. Ashk also grows inland at places where the escapage from canals spreads. Such are the lands near the Consulate flooded to obtain ashk grazing for the ponies in the city. Ascending the river and its main uncanalised distributaries dense growths of &amp; . tamarisk are met that belong to the grazing Tamansk. 0 f wa tered and cultivated lands. The gentler sloping shores of the inundated area t hat are under a shallow depth of water for only a short time at the Bunnun - height of the flood grow a luxuriant crop of Bunnun grass ; such tracts are called Bunnunistan ; they are more exten sive on the east and south shores than on the north and west, because the fan of the Helmand provides the gentle slope on which this grass thrives best. It also grows well on the lands to the south of the Kuh-i-Khwaja over which the wind drives the water of that Hamun in a shallow film. The Bunnun contributes to the support of the flocks of sheep and goats, and to a lesser degree to that of the herds of cattle. Camels are also turned on to it in the sickly season ; the people said that they remain healthier here than they do in the luxuriant growth of camel-thorn and grass. The reeds and rushes support the large herds of cattle which will be des cribed in the following Chapters ; they Cattie-grazmg. penetrate the reed thickets along the ridges that first become traversable as the flood waters are evaporated by the heat of the sun shining from a cloudless sky. The sun is assisted by the high winds bringing fresh blasts of dry air across their surface. From column 6, Appendix 1 Acreage of grazing per head. there are 303,000 acres of Naizar in Persian Seistan and 141,100 in Afghan Seistan. In the count of cattle given at the end of Chapter XXXV there are 15,405 head of cattle in the Naizdr of Persian Seistan and 2,895 m t ^ at Afghan Seistan. If we double these numbers to obtain the probable number in a prosperous year, we find that there are 10 acres of Naizar per head in Persian Seistan and 20 acres in Afghan Seistan, A large number of the village cattle also go to the Naizdr in spring and summer. The total area of Naizdr in both Persian and Afghan Seistan is about 10 acres a head on the total count of 45,486 head of cattle. In prosperous years there would be only about 5 acres a head. Specimens of the reeds and rushes have been sent to the Botanical Gardens, , Sibpur.near Calcutta; the bulrush {tut) Identification of reeds and rushes. has not yet been identified, as the first specimens sent were too ripe, but Mr. Drummond does not think it is either of the two species of typha known in the Punjab by the natives as kundar. Better specimens were sent on receipt of Mr. Drummond’s letter, but press of work has prevented them being studied up to the time of writing this note. » 1Chap. XXXIII ] ■95 The reed {nai) Mr. Drummond has identified as the widely distributed Arundo Donax (Linn). The rush, called tuzg , he has described as a new species of Scirpus in a paper published in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (Volume Part 2, No. 4). ' s v /o, The rush, called, &lt;zshk, he has identified as the Scivpus fi'icLvitimus a widely distributed rush which affords, when green, inferior pasture for ponies, buffaloes and bovine stock in various countries.^ Very little need be said of the grazing in the cultivated tract or in the hills. The grazing in the cultivated tract and in the Specimens* of the plants from both these hllls ' . . . tracts have been sent to Sibpur to be identified. This is the grazing that supports the flocks of sheep and goats to be described in Chapters XXXVTII to XLI, as well as the large numbers of donkeys ; and the camels that are kept alive in the country with great difficulty The grazing in the cultivated lands is very rich and varied, but by the middle of winter becomes scarce, and in bad years the animals become very thin. The green wheat and barley described at page 74 of Chapter XI is then used to support the more valuable animals in full flesh. The grazing on the dasht is meagre and consists mainly of hardy salsolcs {Jana) which spring up in favour able hollows : if the winter rains are sufficient to fill the water-holes on the dasht some of the flock-owners take their flocks to the hills along the trough of the Rud-i-Taraku and utilise this grazing so long as the water lasts. From column 9 of Appendix 1 the cultivated and watered area of Persian _ Acreage of grazing per animal in Persian Seis- Seistan is 508,416 acres; tO this may be tdn ‘ Q . , . added the 276,890 acres of Bunnunistan, making 785,306 acres on which the sheep and goats as well as the donkeys and camels find pasturage. The number of sheep and goats counted—Chapter XXXIX—-was 1 /0,43 b, or between 4 and 5 acres an animal ; while the numbers at the height of the period of prosperity in 1896 are believed to be 400,000 animals, or about two acres per animal. It will be seen how dependent these flocks must be on the grazing in the hills, for some 38,000 donkeys and 4 oco camels also find subsistence on this pasturage in the Delta. In Afghan Seistan the area on which the flocks are supported is not so clearly defined, but it may be taken at nearly 600 square miles or 384,000 acres as on page 184 of Chapter XXX. The flocks when counted contained 90,820 animals, or between 4 and 5 acres an animal,f while the numbers are believed to rise to 300,000 at the height of their prosperity ; the pasturage is then very little more than one acre aS animal, if this estimate be correct; there is less cultivation and more pasturage in Afghan Seistan than in Persian Seistan. Further, it is believed that there is a great deal of grazing up the Khash and the Shand. This grazing also supports 2 420 camels and 4,870 donkey s—tT^ Chapter XLII. The /Vaizdr supports the herds of cattle; the cultivated lands and the hills Graziers and pastors. between them support the flocks of . sheep and goats. The owners of cattle are a distinct class from those who possess sheep and goats, and their lives differ in many interesting particulars. Both classes are called mdlddr : but those who own cattle are called gaodan or w(ildav m i~g(io y W'hile the flock-owners are the ramadar or mdlddr-i-rania \ rama being the flock. The owners of herds of cattle seldom possess any other animals except perhaps a horse, but more usually a donkey or two for use when they visit villages in connexion with the arrangements for hiring out bullocks for plouo-hino- and threshing. ^ 43 The owner of a flock possesses sheep and goats, with one or two camels or donkeys to carry his property when he goes to the hills. The country is un healthy for camels, so that there are very few of these animals ; and it is seldom that the camel-owner, pure and simple, adventures to stay in Seistan, even thoucrh there are vast quantities of camel-grazing. The herd-owner will be first deth with, and then the flock-owner. 1 L M ' S ‘ ,C ° lieCCea andn0: ^ ° n a ^ nUmber ° f S P e;imens 1903, and Zilladar t Sir William Willcocks says the Karo veldt of South Africa supports one sheep to four and one o X t 0 sixteen acres, while in the King William s Town D.stnct, where the rain is more plentiful, one acre supports two sheep.

The grazing area in the Naizar is not divided out among the graziers in the „ u . same elaborate way as the waters are 1 he movements 01 the grazier in the Naizar. , &lt;-' • &gt; i c J r -\ • ir ,. among the Saiyads tor hshmg and fowling {vide Chapter XLIII), though certain localities are reserved for certain groups or encampments {khel) of herd-owners. The graziers move from one reed bed to another in search of better grazing, or so as to be more secure from expected floods. These migrations follow a definite routine and are guided by a sound knowledge of the tract that they live in ; as the flood waters recede, the camps are moved tovvards the centre of the Naizdr to get the advantage of the best and thickest grazing. During the hot months only light habitations are pitched for the grazier and his family. These are usually made of the mats called by the people asil, in literate Persian hasir, platted from crushed reeds. They are laid on light frames of tamarisk bent into half hoops or ribs which are easily carried from one camp to another and last for years. The encampment {khel) of a group of families is pitched in a neat line at some high* spot in the Naizar favourable for such camps ; several groups of families will pitch near to one another, but in separate lines. After the winter solstice when the Hamun begins to rise from the floods caused by the winter rains over the Helmand valley, the graziers move their camps out from the centre portions of the Naizar to the margins or shores. Here they pitch more substantial camps, because the wind of winter rises suddenly and is often of great violence and is accompanied and followed by great cold. The winter of 1905 was a year of exceptionally intense cold, such as had only once before been experienced in the memory of the old men then living ; at the end of January the thermometer in the open fell nearly to zero of Fahrenheit, and the waters of the chung as well as the rivers, where the current was slack, were frozen over and bore for several days. The weather had previously been mild and pleasant; this pleasant weather broke up with a sudden and strong gale of wind. Such winds are very dangerous to the dwellers in camps which are to the windward of the large sheet of water in the Hamun-i-Sabari, because the wind drives the water before it, so that a sudden rise of two or three feet of water over the flat on which the camps are pitched is not unusual; numbed by the cold of the long winter night men and animals sink into the water and drown and fSee Appendix 23 on the Hamun*i-Sdbari and 30 many llVCS have ill the past been thus lost.'}' on Seistam Guides—Meshedi Ah. ]\J 0 p ves 0 f men or animals appear to have been lost in January 1905, though the wind was at times very strong and sprang up very suddenly; but in the blizzard at the end of March four human lives and sixty animals were lost. At high places in the Naizar raised embankments are some times made to protect the highest ground from the water driven by the wind; such places are called Par an. The grazier therefore moves his camp to a safe place early in January, and , this encampment he surrounds with a thick fence of selected tall reeds or bulrushes to protect the huts from the wind. He also constructs special huts of thick bundles of bulrushes {tut) stood on end and inclined towards each other to meet on a ridge forming a pent roof enclosing a space about 8 or 10 feet wide, and as many long as is required, usually about 12 or 14 feet. The end towards the wind is closed with bundles of bulrush and the other end partly closed to form a small entrance. Ring fences are constructed of bundles of reed and bulrush near the huts as a shelter for the cattle, while huts similar to those in which the grazier lives are built for the calves. The animals are not provided with coverings as in the Punjab. These encampments are very warm and snug. The winds are always from the north, so that the back of the encampment is put to the wind ward of a reed bed if feasible; in any case the bright sunshine of the cloudless cold day is very pleasant when reflected off the reeds of the fence that is always * Such spots are called Kula.ic8 [Chap. XXXIV. made to the windward of the huts. The grazier will remain in this encampment in years of moderate flood until it is time to follow the subsiding water, but in years of very high flood he must abandon it in early spring and retreat before the advancing water higher up the gentle sloping margins of the lake. The green reeds are cut in summer when about to flower and are stored r ^ f r at suitable places to be used as fodder in the winter. 1 hese places are called Nat Band and are usually high spots in the Naizar on which a platform of earth, two or three feet high, is raised to place the store of fodder out of reach of the flood. These green reeds are required more particularly for milk cows or animals in poor condition. In winter reeds are cut and brought home by the cowherd for the animals to eat at night. The grazier also pays particular attention to the burning of the reeds so as Burning the reeds. to obtain in due season a crop of green reeds free from the stalks of the old ones. Reeds are burnt at two seasons of the year in the late autumn or early winter and the early spring. The former burning is made to secure a late crop of green shoots for the calves and cows, as reeds burnt in the autumn will shoot again and produce tender green shoots, which are very valuable in winter for young or delicate stock. It is obvious that the burning of reeds must be conducted on some system, or loss of life or destruction of grazing will occur. The inhabitants of each khel burn the reeds of the patch that it vacates. When they follow the receding floods and towards the end of the hot weather penetrate towards the centre of the Naizar j they burn the reeds of the tract over which their cattle have grazed during the summer, i.e., as soon as the reeds are dry enough to burn. In the same way, when they retreat from the Naizar, they again bum the reed beds that they can no longer use, taking the precaution to do so before the water rises over the ground on which the reeds grow. At the period of low river the graziers close off the subsidiary spill channels Controlling the flow of the water in the Naizar. that intersect the Naizar, and confine the water to the main channels that tah into the Hamun-i-Saban, or to the large Chungs near Tappa-i-Adira. Thus during the autumn large tracts of the Naizar are practically dry, and the animals pass through the reed beds grazing without the discomfort of wading through mud ; in summer the wet mud is cool and pleasant, but in winter the cold of ft would tell on their condition. The cattle-owner who lives in the village. Those cattle-owners that live entirely in the villages are usually cultivators as w T ell; they build covered sheds for the use of their animals in winter. Up the valley, where the subsoil is dry, these shelters take the form of holes dug in the ground, covered over with tamarisk poles and branches, with a layer of earth over all; access to the hole is obtained by a narrow inclined way j the earth excavated from the hole is utilized to raise the roof above the ground. In parts, where the tamarisk is plentiful, the sheds are made entirely of this material like the wattle and daub booths or Khdnad-Shing in which the people themselves live. These booths are built of a framework of light long tamarisk poles called Shing ) which are planted, with 2 feet set into the ground about 2 feet apart m two parallel rows, 7 to 9 feet apart, and then hooped to ’form the ribs of the roof. Suitable longitudinal pieces are made fast to these ribs by ropes of kirta grass ; the whole forming a strong cage. The lamer booths are strengthened by uprights supporting a ridge piece with suitable 'struts and ties made of large tamarisk. Outside the cage thus formed mats'* made of tamarisk twms are secured with ropes of kirta grass ; the mats are then plastered with two coatings of plaster forming a wattle and daub which keeps out the cold and the heat. ^Such XLIlJ 116 SeiSUiniS 316 eXpGrtS at Plaitin § theSe j ust as Sa h ads are at mats of reeds, ^ page of Chapter199 Chap. XXXIV.] booths are only made where tamarisk is easily obtained. If all the material has been collected on the spot, a shed, 35 feet long, enough to shelter 20 animals, can be put up by three men in a day, a second day being devoted to plaster the mats with the first coat of plaster, a third day being required for this to dry before the second coat is laid on. In those parts of Seistan far removed from the tamarisk thickets the animals are sheltered in buildings made of sundried bricks with dome roofs, exactly the same as those in which the people themselves live. The great bulk of the herd-owners, however, live in the Naizar in huts built of Genera! remarks. r f eds and bulrushes; the larger part of the number ot animals of the herds are always kept in the Naizar, but some herds of bullocks are owned and kept in the villages, where they are used for ploughing; while some of the bullocks of the large herds are sent to the villages on hire as plough, or threshing bullocks while their owners live in the Naizar. The greater number of the herd-owners are Farsi, probably one-third are Race of the graziers. Baluchi; whilst, on the other hand, nearly all the nock-owners are Baluchi. The Persian has an hereditary taste for cultivation, and probably would prefer that, but the present day life of the grazier has many ameliorations which makes it more attractive than that of the cultivators ; many people therefore, who accu mulate enough wealth as cultivators to purchase herds or flocks, do so. The herd- owners are not harassed by calls for their services ; they retire into the depths of the reed wastes, and live there, with their families in comfortable huts; the herds, as a rule, do well and are profitable j the graziers become independent and hold their heads high.

A count made of the men and women and unmarried children in 32 maldar families shows that there are on the average six souls to a family. One maldar will on the average own 30 animals. The cowherds will probably be one of the souls in his or some other family. The number of the maldar souls may be calculated from the count of cattle in the khel, given further on in this Chapter; being the numbers possessed by the matdar who live in the khel in contra distinction to cattle possessed by cultivators— In Persian Seistin In Afghan Seist^n 4.405 The remaining cattle are owned by cultivators enumerated in Statements Q and R among agriculturists, while their cowherds are counted as labourers. The effect of the famine and sickness in 1902 on the cattle. At the present time (1903-05) the number of cattle in the herds is less than it was. The height of the last prosperous period was about 1897. With that year seasons of poor grazing began and ended with the great drought of 1902, when there was great difficulty in obtaining enough water for the animals to drink. A murrain {gdumargi) broke out among the cattle, and large numbers of the animals died from the disease. The losses are said to have been greater among the cattle in the villages than among those in the Naizar. But the winter of 1902-03 was one of early and ample rain, and the spring of 1903 was also one of abundant and late rain, so that the Hamun filled up and there followed a luxuriant growth of herbage, an abundant harvest of corn and a bumper crop of water melons, so that animals, like men, rapidly recovered their condition. The good grazing continued through the winter of 1903-04 and the year 1904. The severe cold of the winter of 1904-05 destroyed much grazing, and tried the animals severely, but nevertheless in the two years that have elapsed since the drought and murrain of 1902, the herds have made considerable progress in numbers; they all quite recovered their condition in the most wonderful way in the summer of 1903. Count of the cattle. The count of these animals made between June and October 1904 is given in the statement at the end of this Chapter. This shews that the Persian cattle number 75J per cent, of the whole number of the cattle in the country and the Afghan 24I per cent. One year old calves have been included in the count, as they are taxed at half rates; but sucking calves have not been included. It is estimated that 40 per cent, of the herds are cows, 39 per cent, are bullocks, 20 per cent, calves and 1 per cent, bulls. The count has therefore been re-arranged to show these details in the supplementary statement also given at the end of this Chapter. There are no buffaloes in Seistan. It is said that Sardar Sharif Khan brought four to Kala-i-Fath, but they died tormented by the Seistani fly. Perhaps the buffaloe is not immune to surra. The hard alluvial, too, underlying the pools would make it difficult for them to obtain congenial ‘ wallows’. [C639FD] HHH Souls. multiplied by 6 = 3,826 ^ ditto 6 = 579' ■ J -4 g *7 202 [Chap. XXXV. Estimate of the number of head of cattle before the sickness and drought. Knowledgeable cattle-owners estimate that there were twice as many head of cattle in the country before the sickness broke out as have been counted now. Though this hardly agrees with the harrowing descriptions that are given of the immense numbers of animals that died ; on the other hand, there is a noticeable absence of bones in the Naizar,* whereas one would expect to see large quantities of bones near the favourite camping-grounds of the Mdlddr. It is said that the losses among the cattle in Afghan Seistan were much greater than in Persian Seistan, and amounted to two-thirds of the total then existing. It is probably correct that more died on the Afghan than on the Persian side, as the main stream of the Helmand now discharges into Persian territory, and therefore these reed marshes are better watered than those in Afghan Seistan; moreover, the big and deep Hamuns that hold water longest are also in Persia. The numbers of animals, whether cattle or sheep, are never enumerated, or come under discussion by the people, as do the numbers of the ploughs, so that the opinions of quite well-informed natives on this subject are little better than impressions which may easily be very wide of the mark. Price of cattle. The price of cattle has gone up rather more than would be expected if the herds had only been reduced by one-half. Before the sickness (gaumargi) broke out the price of the Naizar cow was 60 to 70 kran } and that of a plough bullock 100 to 120 kran. The price of the Naizar cow is now (1903—05) 100 to 150 kran with a limit of 220 Iran, and a bullock 200 to 250 kran with a limit of 300 kran. The price of bulls (gav-i-tukhmi) has risen from 180 or 150, or 175 kran to 300 kran. It is said that about the year 1880 the herds were much larger even than they were in 1897, anc ^ th e price of the animals was then much less. The largest herd of any one owner then reached 200 head, whereas a herd of 100 head is now exceptional. It is said that the best of the Naizar cows could in 1880 be bought for 50 or 60 kran and the best of the bullocks for 60 kran. Many animals were lost at the great flood of April 1885, because the floods in the river were so great, and so sudden, that the Hamun filled so as to cover all the Naiz&amp;r several feet under water in about 10 days. Estimated average value of the animals. The average value of an animal in ; estimated as follows :— 40 cows at 125 kran ,,, 39 bullocks at 225 kran 1 bull at 300 kran ... 2o taxable calves at 50 kran 100 or 150J kran on the average per head. The value of a similar herd before may be estimated at— 40 cows at 65 kran 39 bullocks at no kran 1 bull at 150 kran 2o calves at 30 kran 100 or 76J kran per head on the average, twice as much as they were. grazier’s herd at present prices may be Kran. ... ... 5,000 8,775 300 ... ... 1,000 I 5;075 the sickness and the famine of 1902 Kran. 2,600 ... ... 4)290 150 ... ... 600 7,640 so that the animals are worth about * Some say that the cattle in the Naizar did not suffer severely either from starration or sickness.Chap. XXXVJ 303 Estimated 'value of the herds. The total value of the herds of the present day at present prices may be estimated as follows In Persian Seistan— 34,225 head of cattle at 150! kran each V In Afghan Seistan— 11,261 head of cattle at 150I tcran each ... ... 1,697,596 Total value of the cattle ... 6,857,015 The value of the herds before the drought and sickness reduced their num bers may be estimated on the assumption that there were, twice as many head of cattle in Persian Seistan as there are now ; and three times as may in Afghdn Seistan :— In Persian Seistan— Kran. 68,450 head of cattle at 76^ kran each ... ... 5,236,425 In Afghan Seistan— 33)7^3 head of cattle at 76^ Jtran each ... ... 2,584,400 7,820,825 This is not very different from the value of the herds now and shows, if any thing, that the losses of cattle have been on the whole correctly estimated. Breeds and breeders of cattle. Two classes of cattle are recognised—the Naizari or those that live in the Naizar and the Dehati* or those that live in the villages ; the former are larger and stronger; the people say that they are better bred ; probably the difference is only due to the better feeding and to less work. The lifef of a plough ox is one of almost continual labour throughout the year, and since he is sent out on hire to be used for ploughing, and his food is sup plied by the hirers, it is possible that he is systematically overworked and under fed ; it is only the splendid grazing of the hot season, and the fact that he can usually be easily changed for another, if he breaks down, that saves him. The general colour of all the cattle is black, while some have white patches ; but, as a rule, these patches are not conspicuous. The horns are well developed, but are moderate in size. The breeds most found in the Naizar in Persian Seistan, are said to be Rezdigi, Janbakhsh Muhammad, Mulla Hasan, Afzal, Akbar, Suliman and Buzi. There are said to be only four breeds in Afghan Seistan, Buzi, Kundar, Karim Kushta and Pahlawan. The Buzi are said to be of large size, and the cows to give more milk than the other breeds. Buzi appears to be the name of a Farsi taifa of graziers. No attempt has been made to investigate these breeds ; the names are given for what they may be worth. A bull is kept for each herd of about 130 cows and goes about with the herd. The male calves are at once gelt by the owner himself, who makes the necessary operation and salts the wound. Calves of an advanced age are also gelt, if necessary ; the operation is said to be more painful and difficult, but is not more dangerous. The best season for the operation is early spring. Very cold or windy weather is to be avoided ; also the time when there are many flies about. A sucking calf male or female is called shir-khor bacha ; a calf a year old is called maugas ; a two-year old is called gdo sala nim ; at three years old a heifer * The price of the Dehati bullock is said to have been from 40 to 60 kran before the sickness and to be from 100 to 150 kran now which is much the same as that already quoted for the Naizari animal. , f As a general rule, one pair of bullocks will do the work of only one plough. During the six months of autumn and winter the pair of bullocks will plough during 90 days, working all through the short day. They will also be employed for a short time thrashing cut the small quantity of autumn harvest reaped by the plough. During this season the work is hard, weather cold and grazing poor, and the bullocks lose their condition. During the six months of spring and summer the bullocks will plough for autumn crop sowings, and thresh out the wheat and barley harvest. Each of these operations will be about one month’s work for the animals. The weather is warm and the grazing excellent, and during this season the bullocks recover their condition. Kran ••• 5 tt 59 » 4 i 9204 [Chap. XXXV. is called gastar ; at that age she can be put to the bull. She is still called gastar till the third calf is bom; then she is known as gav and is full grown. The young bullock is known as nauch in its third year, and remains so^ till the 5th year when it is full grown and is called khassi. At 2^ years the milk-teeth begin to fall; two are lost a year ; after the 5th year all 8 milk-teeth are gone. The cow begins to bear in her 3rd or 4th year ; the cow gives a calf every second year ; exceptional cows give a calf each year. Some cows drop twins ; but such a cow here, as elsewhere, in the east is looked upon as unlucky. A cow lives to be from 10 to 15 years old, and if well fed during that time will give from 6 to 10 calves, but the lower figure is nearer, the average number of the calves given by a cow in her life time. The bull also lives 10 to 15 years, though some bulls attain to an age of 17 to 22 years. ^ Bullocks, when^ 3 or 4 years old, are put to work at the plough. As already said they are in their^ prime at 5 years old, and pass it at the 8th year, when their price begins to diminish. Sale of surplus bullocks. The cattle-owners keep enough bullocks to hire out for ploughing, and some to carry their goods and chatties when they move their camps, and the remainder they sell. Merchants come from Meshed to the Naizar to buy cattle ; or local merchants buy the cattle and take them to the markets ; or the cattle-owners themselves take them. A merchant, who comes to Seistan to buy cattle or sheep, is known as a chobdar. Residents of Seistan who take cattle out of the country to sell are called locally gdo jalab hash. The chobdar does not bring cash with him, but he obtains a bill* from the * The Governor of Seisin has to remit revenua Meshed which the to Meshed ; this is a convenient way of doing so. Ofianzaaa J at. iviesneu WniCU Ulc + Governor-General of Khorasan. Hashmat-ul-Mulk Cashes for him in SeiS* tan. The animals of Persian Seistan are taken to Meshed, Shiraz, Ispahan, Nishapur and Ashkabad: from Afghan Seistan they are sent to Meshed, Ispahan, Herat and Kandahar. Before the cattle are taken from the Naizar of Persian Seistan to be sold, either the Hashmat-ul-Mulk or the Yamfn-i-Nizam, or if these are too far away, Kadkhuda Muhammadi of Deh Kamali, must be informed. A slip is also obtained from the passport clerk {tazkara chi) to certify that the animals are not stolen property. No fees are recovered for those animals sold in Persia, but animals taken across the Russian border, at Pul-i-Khatun, for sale in Ashkabad are taxed one kran an animal by the Persian authorities. If the animals are not sold in Russia and are brought back, no rebate of the tax is given. The Russians do not recover any tax from the owner of the animals sold. In Afghan Seistan an animal taken abroad to be sold is valued by the cus toms officers (Bdjgir), and the tax called Bdjgiri at 5 per cent, on this valuation is recovered from the owner. If the animals are not sold, and come back again, the tax is not refunded. A receipt is given for the tax which also serves as a certificate that the animal was not stolen. Animals sold in Afghan Seistan are also taxed 5 per cent. No similar tax is made in Persian Seistan. It is said that some 500 to 1,000 animals^ go from Seistan each year to be sold. The cattle-owner seldom sells cows; very occasionally a cow will be taken to Meshed to gratify the whim of some personal friend of the cattle-ownei, who wishes to possess a cow from the Naizar. t The annual increase may be estimated as follows :~ 4 o per cent.of the count of the cattle are cows say, Vi 700 In Persian Seistan, 4,500 in Afghan Seistan. The calves that grow up to maturity may be taken at half this number. In good years the number will be much more than this ; the number of cows will be greater, and they will be more prolific. In bad years the numbers and percentage of produce may even be less. The heifers are kept to increase the herds, and the bullocks only are available for sale. The bullocks may be taken at half the numbers of calves that grow up, say, 3,400 in Persian Seistan and 1,125 Afghan Seistan. If 1 000 animals are sentfrom Persian Seistan to be sold, the remainder must be absorbed by agriculture in the country as the country is not wealthy enough to eat beef in large quantities, thougjh some bullocks are slaughtered in the city • but most of these are old bullocks past their prime. Perhaps 500 animals are thus slaughtered in a year. The figures of 5oo to 1,000 above given, it may be stated, are based on detail enquiries made among the cattle-owners in the Naizdr, which elicited the information that in 1903 nine Gao Jalab Kash went from Seistan with Lllncks to sell In iQ04three Gao Jalab Kash left Seistan with 360 bullocks, and three Chobdar came and o 9 r J,iio in all i that year. Up to the time the Mission left in May 1905 seven Cne Jalab Kash had collectea 554 bullocks, and one Chobdar had collected 140 animals or 694 animals in all. They were still collecting bullocks, and it was thought that at least 1,000 would be collected m 1905.205 Chap. XXXV.l A good tractable plough bullock is seldom sold, and a good tractable pack ox of whom its owner can boast that it is khassi shisha bar (a bullock that can carry glass) is never sold. The merchants collect the bullocks at some central place in the Naizar, so as to be ready to start at the end of April or early in May, as at that season the grazing is at its best. The bullocks have their feet shod before they start on the long journey to the distant markets, because the roads are for the most part rough and stoney : some are only shod on the fore-feet; others on all four. The cost of the shoeing is from i^- to 3 kran according as two or four feet are shod. The shoeing is done by a cattle-owner; at each khel there is some one wno can put on shoes. The shoes are flatpieces of iron similar to those used on bullocks in India. Most intelligent Baluchis can shoe horses or cattle. The Statement of the count of cattle in SeistAn.

The tax recovered from the herds is called pul-i-sargala, or simply sargala \ Incidence Of the tax. that from sheep pul-%-sar rama } oi sar rama. The tax collected from cattle is sometimes called gaugirt, and even gau shumdri. It is said that in former times one bullock was taken annually for every 40 animals among cattle,* and the tax was then called Chihil Yaki. Amfr ’Alam Khan of Kain, Hashmat-ul-Mulk, is said to have first recovered this tax in cash. For all animals of two years old and over one kran a year is charged ; sucking a year old are taxed at one-half of a kran a head j bulls are not taxed either in Persian or Afghan Seistan. It is said that m the days when ’Ali Khan, father of the present Dost Muhammad Khan, Saruni, first collected the tax, he took one kran for two plough bullocks ; previous to this there is an idea among some that plough bullocks were not taxed. About ten years ago, when Kadkhuda Darwish, Kambar, had the contract, he recover ed one kran from each plough bullock, the same as for other bullocks and cows. * It was also said that the camels to carry the material for the Meshed Seistan telegraph were collected by taking possession of one camel in forty, without payment, from the owners of camels met with along the line of telegraph, or in Seistan. calves are not taxed, but calves of The tax is the same in amount in Afghan Seistan as in Persian, but in the latter the count is made each year, whereas in Afghan Seistan the count is made at long intervals of years. The information collected about the cattle tax in Peisian Seistan will first be given, and then that about the same tax in Afghan Seistan. Sefsr mated value ° f the cattle ‘ tax in Persian The estimated value of the cattle tax in Persian Seistan on the count of cattle now made is as follows : — Kran. 34,225 head of cattle (less 360 bulls) at One kran a head 33,-865 100 head (say) ... ... ... 100 Deduct half rates on 6,844 calves, one year old ... 3)422 Estimated value of tax ... ... 30)543 The contractors will expect a profit of about i (say) ... 6,100 Letting value of the tax ... ... ... 24,443 Before the sickness of 1902 destroyed so many cattle the value of the tax should have been about twice this sum. The cattle-tax is leased in contract separately from the sheep-tax. The cattle-tax for the whole of Persian Seistan SeiS° d ° f collecting the cattle ' tax in Persian has nearly always been farmed to the Saruni’s father or son. They are capable shrewd men, who have during the last 30 years reclaimed large areas in the Miankangf; they keep their own counsel. In the foot-notef the information that can be got from the people is given : from this it would appear that the con tractor secures for his trouble about one-fifth of the tax he collects. f It is said that ’Ali Khan Saruni, father of Dost Muhammad Khan, of Deh Dost Muhammad, who livedat Karko Shah, in the Miankangf, first took the contract (Ijara) of collecting the cattle-tax for 12,000 kran a year, though some say 14,000 kran (14 man Pul)\ and that for 20 years he paid this sum annually for the contract of collecting the tax. While some say that this was not a contract, but that ’Ali Khan collected the tax in Amani, and this was the yield ; at that time plough bullocks were not taxed. It is said that some six years ago Kadhkuda Fakir Darwish and Asghar of the tribe of Kambar fell out with Dost Muhammad Khan, the son of ’Ali Khan, and bid 19,000 kran for the tax. But the contract was not let at all in that year, and in the following year Dost Muhammad gave 24,000 kran for the contract for the two years combined. Some say that in the rivalry Gul Muhammad Khan, anc ther son of ’Ali Khan, got the contract for seven years At 50,000 kran a year ; some say for both cattle and sheep, but others for cattle only. Gul Muhammad Khan is said to have collected the tax for two years only, and then died, and was followed by Dost Muhammad Khan, who took the contract for 50,000 iJraw, but some say that this was for both cattle and sheep. But from the estimate given above of the value of the tax before the sickness reduced the herds, 50,000 kran should be a fair contract for the tax. Taj Muhammad says that Abbas Khan of Kimak had the contract some to or 15 years ago for 18,000 kran and made 4,000 kran of profit out of it. Taj Muhammad was a servant of Abbas Khan ; he says that at that time cattle used in ploughing were not taxed, but that ’Ali Khan first begr,n to tax plough bullocks by recovering half &amp; kran a head. After him came Kadkhuda Darwish, Kambar, who recovered a full kran on plough bullocks. &gt; - vtfT .208 [Chap. XXXVI. In 1902 about one-half of the animals died of drought and sickness and the contract was not taken up, nor was any tax collected in 1903. But in 1904 Dost Muhammad Khan collected the tax amdni (on honour), i.e., whatever was collected was paid in, no contract being made. The tax was recovered for the two years on the animals counted in 1904. The amount* thus realized is not known. The contractor and the Governor are equally interested to keep the knowledge of the value of the tax to themselves, so that others may not outbid them with their superiors. The tax collector goes about the work of collecting the tax much the same as has been described at page 231 for the sheep tax. Gulluk. —The tip [Gullug (sicY\ received by the sowar, who collects the coin from the cattle-owner, was formerly one kran in every 30 or 40 kran of tax re covered, but the people say that the sowar now requires one kran in every 10 or 20. Rishta Gdvi. —The Rishta Gdvi, or tax of one kran for each threshing floor is collected by the Sar Mushrif. This is paid by all threshing floors,_ whether of gham or ploughs. The Kalgirkars usually thresh out their corn with flails, but those who use bullocks pay Rishta Gdvi, but not a kran on each floor, but apparently the Kalgirkars of the village group themselves together till the corn to be threshed is about as much as that of a plough, and then they subscribe the kran amongst them— Kran. The and ploughs pay ... ... ... 2,222 The Kalgirkars number about 1,030 and probably pay ... 66 Total Rishta Gavi ... 2,288 Method of collecting the cattle tax in Afghan Seistdn. The cattle in Afghan Seistan are said to have been counted about 1894, and the list of the owners, with their herds as then made, is kept by the Sarishtadar of the Hakim of Chakhansur, who lives at Kala-i-Kang ; up to 1901 it is said that the Sarishtadar collected both the sheep and the cattle tax. If the man’s herd de creased he still paid on the count; but if, on the other hand, it was known that his herd had increased, the tax was correspondingly raised. In 1902 when large numbers of animals died, the owners petitioned the Hakim for a new count; he referred the matter to the Amir at Kabul, and pending his reply no tax was re covered in 1902, 1903 or 1904. It is said that an order has now (spring 1905) come from the Amir of Kabul that the animals now living should be counted, and the taxes for the three years past should be recovered on that count. This count is being made at the time of writing by each owner going with two or three sureties before the Qazi at Kala-i- Kang, and certifying to the number of the animals that he now has. The Qazi gives him a slip to this effect to the Sarishtadar, who thereupon enters up the information in his books and recovers the taxes outstanding there and then in cash.f Estimated value of the cattle tax in Afghan Seistdn. —The value of the cattle tax in Afghan Seistan may be estimated as follows:— Kran. Cattle in the count outside the Sanj’arani tract at one kran each 10,141 Kran. Deduct for bulls ... 120 Deduct for 2,000 calves, one year old ... ... 1,000 Total of deduction ... ... 1,120 Number of kran recovered ... 9,021 * Mr. Keyes writes that the cattle-tax to be collected in 1905 has been let to Sher Ali Khan (Afghan trader of Burj-i-Afghan) for 30,000 bran. The contract he adds has usually been let for 40,000 kran, but owing to the decrease in the number of cattle it has been let this year for less. He adds that formerly the local Government paid the Imperial treasury the sheep and cattle tax in advance, now owing to the uncertainty of the tenure of the Governorship, and the depletion of the Governor’s treasury, the tax, it jS rumoured, is to be farmed out, and is to be paid in quarterly instalments through the Custom’s Department. fit is said that about 15 years ago one Muhammad Jan Baluch of the tribe of the Pahlawan, a resident of Ibra- himabad took the contract for both the cattle and sheep-tax for 43,000 The graziers were dissatisfied with this arrangement, and to despite the contractor kept shifting their abodes so as to make the collection of the tax as difficult as possible. His contract was not successful for he ended in prison in Farah ; some said that he had lost by the contract, but others say that as soon as he got the contract he increased his personal expenditure and thus became a defaulter. i -209 Chap. XXXVI.] The value of the tax is, therefore, 9,021 kran on the present numbers, and, it all accounts are true, should have been between 25,000 and 30,000 kran before the animals died in large numbers in 1902. Sanjarani tract. No tax is recovered from the herds or flocks in this tract. But there is a hut tax which is described in Chapter XXV which is looked upon by the people as taking the place of animal and other taxes. Kardri and Firdri herds. Graziers are said to be Kardri when they are grazing in the lands of the country of which they are the inhabitants ; they Firdri when they pass over the border, and go to graze their herds or flocks in the neighbouring territory. Graziers cross the border in this way to follow the grazing, or to stay for a time with friends, or to escape some inconvenient restriction imposed by their own Government. Itis said that in Afghan Seistan the cattle-owners have to render some unpaid service, such as supplying ropes, bags (juwal), or carrying grain ; and to escape these, as well as to get the benefit of the better grazing, they pass into Persian Seistan in the spring, and go back about the end of September. Each year some 400 to 1,000 head of the cattle so cross the border. In the year 1904, 400 head came across in the spring, of which 100 went back at the ploughing time for spring crops, and the remaining 300 head were at Lurg-i- Kula Khan near Tappa-i-Machatak in December. Such Firdri herds are charged at a favourable rate both by Afghans and Persians. The rate in Persia is usually one kran for two full grown animals, or for four calves, one year old (sucking calves are not taxed). If the visitor stays into the second year, he is charged full rates like a permanent resident. When he goes back to his own country, he is charged full rates as usual and receives no rebate for having been away. If the Firdri grazier bolts back without paying his taxes, he is charged full rates, and given no concession, if he should ever come on a visit again. The kadkhuda of the Firdri herds or flocks reports himself in person on his arrival in Persia to the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, and receives a written permission to remain in Persia. Before leaving the country the kadkhuda goes again to the Hashmat-ul-Mulk and reports his intention to return. In Afghan Seistan the same rates are charged on visiting {Firdri) herds, as on Kardri herds no concession is made. The count is said to be made at the time the corn stubble is on the ground, when the underlings of the Sarishtadar take with them Mulla Baran, Rashem Khan, Baluch Khan and Kadkhuda Sufi-ud- din and count the animals and collect the tax. The visiting animals thus met with are principally flocks. The assessors receive no emoluments for this service. The Firdri graziers report their arrival in Afghan Seistan to the Hakim of Chakhansurat Kala-i-Kang or Nad-i-Ali, and receive from him a written permit to remain in the country. Labour on Public Works. In Persian Seistan the owners of herds are not liable to be called out on public works, but they must go by turn to cut the reeds for the Hashmat-ul- Mulk’s herd of about 300 animals kept at Kang-i-Haidar, a celebrated reed bed reserved for the herds of the Governor alone. This herd is under the immediate charge of Kadkhuda Muhammad of Deh Kamali {vide Chapter XLIII, Note on Saiyads). In Afghan Seistan the cattle-owner is called on to carry grain, or supply ropes, or any such material as they make for the use of Government without remuneration, but they are not called out to labour on works.

I CHAPTER XXXVII. Expenditure and income oj the cattle-owner. Since the cattle are, on the whole, very healthy, and the cultivators keep no cattle themselves, but hire them from the cattle-owners, the profits are good and assured. The life too is an easy one and the grazier escapes many of the exactions which a cultivator has to bear. Therefore many cultivators of Persian extraction now aspire to own cattle, though the Persian is by hereditary training an agriculturist, and has a proverb “ Yak kal zamin yak ayo barabar ast” One farrow’s length of land is equivalent to a herd of cattle. Kal is land, but the word is also used for the farrow run by the plough. Ayo is a herd of cattle. The capital outlay, the income and the expenditure of the cattle-owner will now be estimated. Capital outlay of the cattle-owner. A grazier requires a herd (Gurm in Baluchi; Ayo Seistani; Galla Afghani and Kaini) of about 35 animals made up as follows At present prices. Previous to 1902.

The cows graze in the Naizar all the year round and receive no grain Food for cattle or chaff, so that the owner is put to no expense on their account. He, or his herd have only to labour to collect and store green reeds for feeding milk cows, or young calves in the winter. The bullocks while employed in agriculture are fed by the cultivators, and when no longer required by them are sent back to the Naizar to graze. So that the cattle-owner is put to very little, if any, expense about feeding them. For the purpose of an estimate it may be assumed that he has to give them 15 Seistdni manoi crushed barley (arddwa), valued at 11 kran. A cattle-owner living in the village would of course have to feed his cows on chaff and perhaps grain, when the grazing became poor, and also his bullocks, when the cultivators returned them to him, but there are very few such. In good years the animals would, however, only need to be so fed for two months at the end of winter; during the remainder of the year the rich grazing to be got in the cultivated tract would suffice. Chaff, or chopped straw, locally known as bhusa, is usually very cheap. It is sold by the bag [juwal) of 25 seers (Indian) ; a quantity sufficient for five animals for a day. Many juwal of bhusa can, as a rule, be got for one kran. The juwal is a bag made of goat’s hair, or of wool ; the former is the more lasting. This is the same size and make of bag that was used in India before the advent of railways, when grain was carried about on camels. The hut of the cattle-owner. The value of the hut maybe estimated as follows:— The nbs of the hut are made of 32 tamarisk poles which can be bought at 8 to the kran. The mats (asil) to cover the hut are made by the cattle-owner him self ; however, if he bought them, he would require about 4 kran worth. So that the hut might cost him 8 kran in the first instance ; as the tamarisk lasts for many years, the annual expense of the repairs of the hut is not worth taking Into account. The cost of the hut is therefore nominal and may be estimated at 2 kran a year. The cattle-owner will require a khurjin, jhuj etc. These are saddle bags to Miscellaneous requirements. pack hlS^ goods On the bullocks, when he moves his camp. He will also require ropes to tie his property on his bullocks. Most of these things his family will make, but he must purchase the material. He will also require a stout sickle locally called to cut reeds. This miscellaneous expenditure may be esti mated at 12 kran a year. • J The dog is not the necessity to a cattle-owner that it is to a sheep-owner, Dog, and many cattle-owners do not possess a t though there are always several round the point encampment of many graziers that are kept as watch-dom; only.

Many herd-owners have donkeys to convey them to and from the cultivated Horses and donkeys. ! and &gt; though donkeys are seldom_ kept in the Naizar, as the grazing is not suitable.

Income of the cattle-owner. We may now pass on to the income of the cattle-owner ; this is derived from the sale of clarified butter {ghi) ) kurud, the sale of calves, and the earnino- s of bullocks at agriculture. Milk and ghi. Cow’s milk is said to yield less ghi than sheep’s milk, and the Baluchi says income of the cattle-owner from g'/if. made from the milk of a sheep 15 much more nourishing than that made from that of a cow. A Naizar cow will yield from 30 sir to 1 man Seistani of milk a day ; the smaller underfed cows of the village will not give more than ten sir a day. One waw of cow’s milk will yield about sir of ghi; from each cow, during the time it is in milk, from 1 to 2 man (Seistani) of ghi are obtained. . _ _ Cows are sometimes lent to people during the time they are in milk ; the individual, who thus hires a cow, is called miangir by the Baluchi; mian or 'miau is the milk in the udder, or perhaps the udder, in distinction to shir, milk. One arrangement seldom made is that the hirer returns f of the vhi and f of the kurud* obtained from the cow to the owner. This leaves too much to the honesty of the hirer to be a popular system of hire. The more usual ar rangement is that the hirer pays one man Seistani of ghi and 5 man Seistani of kurud per cow. It may be estimated that the owner will get man of ghi a cow; the value of this produce from the herd will be —- 18 cows at 1 1 Seistdni man At three sir per kran ... 57 man. 360 kran.

The continued existence of the herd must be provided for from among the calves each year. A heifer does not begin to bear till the 4th year, and a cow may be reckoned onto give from 6 or 10 calves in her lifetime of 10 or 15 years. Perhaps the lower figure should be taken, but we will assume that 1 calf in 6 is needed to replace the cows and bullocks. A certain number of heifers should form an integral portion of the herd to cover the period between birth and the age of giving calves ; these should perhaps have been included in the original capital cost of the herd. But the figures do not claim to be exact and complete, but only tentative. The renewal of the herd may be provided for by estimating an increase of only 10 calves in the year instead of 12 ; by this method the cattle-owner gets the credit of his skill and labour as a breeder, and this is perhaps the more cor rect method. Another way is to write off the value of two cows each year. The last two methods are abstracted below :— Present prices. Prices that obtained Particulars. before 1902.

The Persian herd-owner spends his money more freely than the Baluchi herd or flock-owner, and his method of living is more extravagant, so it is said, thus he does not accumulate savings so rapidly as the Baluch. But herds probably suffer less from disease and disaster than the flocks, and the life of a herd owner seems more comfortable, or more secure than that of the flock-owner, while it is as healthy.CHAPTER XXXVIII.

At ploughing and wielding a tisha he cannot compare to the Farsi, but his zeal and endurance in those walks of life that he has made peculiarly his own are very great, and are as of much value as the fine energy and industry of the Tajik or Dehkan cultivator.

XXXVIIL The flock-owners like to get away towards the end of January; by that time the shepherding of flocks, so that they do Time of going. tres p ass on t h e green wheat and barley, is onerous, and, even if the exodus to the hills cannot begin, many flocks move, from the cultivated tract to the Bunnunistdn, or the shores of the Bamun, where the flocks thrive on the Bunnun grass. By the end of February, in ordinary years, the flocks have departed from the cultivated tract, and at the end of March, the last of those that are going have reached the hills. From the notes made during the count of flocks, it would appear that 173 flocks of Persian Seistan, containing 55,740 sheep and goats, went to the hills in 1904 ; with them went 5 horses, 1,547 camels and 6,160 donkeys. Thus, it will be seen from the count, given in the next Chapter, that half the sheep and goats of Persian Seistan went to the hills, and with them went half_ the camels belonging to the flock-owners, but only ^ of the donkeys, from which it vrould appear that many donkeys are left behind at the exodus. The Iambs and kids accompany the flocks to the hills. The Baluchi flock-owners go to the hills that lie between the Kuh-i- Malik Siah and the Palang Kuh, while the Persian Hills to which the flocks are taken. flock-owners prefer the hills from the Palang Ktih to the Atishkhana* Hills. The great majority of the flock-owners are Baluch, and these almost without exception go to the hills each year. The Farsi flock-owners sometimes cultivate land as well, and remain to look after the cultivation; if so, they sometimes send their flocks to the hills in charge of shepherds. The flock-owners of Afghan Seistan go to the grazing places along the Shand in the Dasht-i-Margo, and along the Khuspas Rud in the Dasht-i-Khuspas. While some pass across the Farah and Hanid Rud and go to the hills between Persian and Afghan Seistan. Flocks to the south of Kala-i-Fath cross the Hel- mand, and go to the Sarhad and Narhui hills. The sheep are taken across the river tied to a pole of willow, so that all may swim together, the shepherd swimming with them. There are no tut in on the river above the village of Khwabgah just above the Band-i-Seistan. Some of the roads by which the flocks are taken. The road to the Kiih-i-Malik Siah hills is called the Rah-i-Muksir (Mukk-i- Surkh) and Rah-i-Supedawa.f The road crosses the Hamun area at the high ridge at the head of the Sar-i-Shela passing from the kucha wells on the east of the Hamun at Regowak across the Hamun to the Dasht from whence roads branch off to Kain, Mukk-i-Surkh Saffddva and Darwazago. Another road, the R&amp;h-i-Turush Ap or Ab, by which General Goldsmid came to Seistan in January 1872 , goes from Regowak to Sipel; this road crosses two miles south of the head of the Sar-i-Shela at a place where the banks are low. It is said that, in the years of great flood, like 1885 and 1890 , both these roads were closed, as the floods covered the country as far as Girdi Chah. When going to the hills in February, water is found in pools along these roads, but when the time for return comes these pools are dry, and the distance from one water to another is too great to take flocks in the hot days of June, so the flocks come to the waters near the Kiih-i-Malik Siah Ziarat, such as Diwan Chah, Hurmuk and Madanak and enter Seistan by the trade route. The flocks are marched at night ; in the cool of the morning and evening, they are put to graze, and during the heat of the day they sleep. Sheep and goats have great endurance, and will march great distances if taken along with due consideration of their habits. Some sheep and goats marched back with the Mission from Kuhak to Nushki in the heat of May and June. If the grazing in the hills is good and plentiful, some flocks remain there till the autumn or even the next year, but in normal years all return to Seistan. ® Some of the flock-owners at Deh Ali Mardan and Takht-i-Shah in the Miankangf take their flocks across the Far&amp;h and Harud Rud to graze in the hills to the west of the latter. They pay taxes to the Afghans for the grazing. The best of the guides that went with the building parties to Kuh-i-Narahu came from among these flocn-owners. t Rdh«i-Saffd£va or SaffdabS (white water).219 Chap. XXXVIII.] The time of the flocks’ return to the cultivated tract is arranged, so that they Summer and autumn grazing secured for the arrive when the harvest is cut and fathered . m; tins in normal years is about the end of May, or middle of June. The flocks are fed on the tall stubble left in the wheat and barley fields which is also thickly overgrown with valuable grazing shrubs. This grazing is called Pdkhdli, and the flock-owner must pay for it to Pdkhdu, Hashmat-ul-Mulk, who receives a sheep . e from a flock. The value of the sheep taken is regulated by the size of the flock. A ram, worth now-a-days30 kran, is taken from a large flock of 300 or 400 sheep. From a smaller flock of 200 sheep a yearling lamb {yaksal bar a or shishak) is taken. From a small flock a male lamb {nimsala ^ bar a) is taken, whose value is about four kran at this time. This tax is called Pakhali y and is distinguished by most Baluchis from alafchar-i- 2.^., sheep grazing tax^ that is collected from the Firari flocks (vide page 231), though some call this also alufchar-i-gusfand. The cultivators are not charged this tax on any sheep or goats that they keep. The Pdkhdli tax is said to have been established in 1898. The method of collecting the tax will be found described in the paragraph on tax collecting on page 231. It is reckoned that two ploughs of cultivation, or about 100 acres in area, are required for the grazing of a flock of about 300 or 400 animals. The sheep thrive on this grazing, and when it is done the flocks are taken to the Bunnumstdn to graze, until the water melons are collected ; then they return to graze on the vines of the melons ; this grazing is called Las hi, and the tax al ready paid for the wheat and the barley stubble covers this grazingalso. In the winter, before the flocks leave for the hills, the grazing for sheep and Winter grazing and feeding with barley. goats IS poor, but in former times grain .... . , . was cheap, and it was customary to give during this period, 2 to 5 sir Seistani of barley to those sheep and goats that were out of condition, or had lambed in the autumn ; the rate for barley was then as low as 8 man Seistani 2. kran \ but since the bad years which began, as the Baluchi sav in the year that the British Thana was opened at Robat (1897), ^e price of grain has been too high to admit of this feeding being given ; it is believed that in years of cheap gram all the surplus* barley was consumed in this way by the sheep. \\ hen the days are hot the flocks are taken out to graze at about 3 a.m. in Best time of the day for grazing. the morning. This \s cd\\e&amp; Shabchar. It is said the animals eat well in the cool of the night, and the flock can be brought back, so that, in the heat of the day they are at rest near their folds, and the ewes can be sent to give milk to the lambs! It is said that the flock sent to graze during the heat of the day are liable to become sick. J There seems to be only one sickness of sheep, and it is called jigar jtish Sheep sickness. bimari it is induced by drinking warm water, sleeping on shur (alkali) lands, or by eating taratak (a salsola) or ashk, the scirpus maritimus, at seasons when they are not suitable for sheep grazing. These two plants are only safe grazing when quite young, or when dry ; but not in the intermediate state. The animal dies in about 70 days from this sickness. If the sickness is due to improper grazing the animal usually recovers when it is taken to the hills. But it is said that when the sickness is brought about from drinking warm water, or sleeping on sMHands there is no cure. It is said that most of the destruction of sheep and goats that occurred in 1902 was brought about by this sickness. , A very limited enquiry only has been made into sheep sickness.

In matters connected with the river, my previous experience and studies has enabled me to appreciate the correct observation, and the sound views of the Baluchi and Seist&amp;ni, who live along the river, of all that concerns the river. Any veterinary officer, who wishes to make himself acquainted with the disease of horses, cattle, sheep and goats, w^ould be well advised to get at the bottom of the Baldchi and the Farsi knowledge of these subjects.

This is not a land ^ of magic, but there are men who are observant, have excellent memories and ripe judgment, though they are illiterate; such men, if searched for, can be found. I have found knowledge stored in the same way among the residents of the Sind Sagar Thai in India and among the residents of the Veldt in South Africa. No doubt the same wise men are to be found in England, but in modern times the most able of them communicate their knowledge to a society, or put it into a book; and the fact that there are many, who are observant and have retentive memories, who do not write, is apt to be lost sight of.CHAPTER XXXIX.

Breedings the number and the value of the flocks. Many breeds are recognised among the flock-owners, named apparently Breeds after the tract from which the animals originally came. The sheep are nearly all white, and of the fat tail variety, though there are some black sheep. The sheep of the breed, called khap ) are said to be of the largest size, but those of the breed, called bukwai, are said to have the heaviest tails, whilst their fleece is also softer and heavier, and the ewes give more milk than tho^e of other breeds. The ewes of the Nahrui breed of sheep are said to be good givers of milk. Some sheep with four horns have been noticed among the flocks. No time has been given to the study of these breeds, and nothing more useful than the above can be said of them. The life of a sheep (gusfand or mish) and a goat {buz) is from 7 to 10 Breeding years. The ewes usually live only 7 years, though exceptional ewes may live for 10 years. The ewe {gusfand-i mada) begins to bear at years of age, and drops the lamb in the 6th month ; three lambs are sometimes dropped, but 5 per cent, of the ewes will give twins, and the remainder a single lamb. The ewe may be estimated to gives t0 7 lambs in her life time; that is, if no allowance is made for ewes that are destroyed by famine and disease. Half the she-goats will drop two kids, and a she-goat may be estimated to give from 7 to 10 kids in her life time. In ordinary years only one lamb is taken from the ewe in the year, and the breeding season is the spring; but in 1903 the grazing was so exceptionally good, both in the hills and in the delta, that the sheep not only recovered their condi tion, but became fat, and the owners took two lambs a year from the ewes in the years 1903 and 1904; one in autumn as well as one in spring. In ordinary years the ewes have not condition to support a second lamb. One ram {gusfand'i-tukhmi or gauch : literate kauch) is kept for every 50 to 100 ewes. After the pdkhdli grazing is over, about July of each year, it is necessary to send the rams away from the ewes for 3 or 4 months in order to regulate the breeding. 1 he man who looks after them at this time is called a mazdur, z.£., hired labourer, and he is paid for his service by receiving the fleece of the rams. The he-goats {buz-i-tukhmi or taka) are also sent with the rams, but the hair of the he-goat is inferior, and only suitable for rope-making; the mazdur is therefore given a sheep’s fleece or its equivalent in cash for each he-goat he herds during that time. The owner himself gelds the male sheep and goats, as soon as they are born, Gelding by making an incision and removing the testicles. The wound is salted and bound with leather. A wether or a male goat is called bakhtah. The count cf sheep and goats. A careful enumeration of the sheep and goats has been made and the results are given in the statement on the next page, from which it will be noticed that there were 261,25?) animals in the country after the great drought, 65!-per cent, of which belonged to Persian Seist^n. Lambs under a year old are free from tax and have not been included in the count. Formerly it is said that one owner possessed as a limit a flock of 1,000 Size of flocks. animals ; but now the largest flocks have seldom more than 400 sheep and goats. The count made gives 200 as the average in a flock throughout the country. In the count 75 per cent, are probably sheep and 25 per cent, goats; so the numbers can be re-arranged as shown in the supplementary statement at the bottom of the next page from which it will be seen that there were about 196,000. sheep and 65,000 goats in the country after the drought.

It is said that the flocks began to diminish from 1897, when a series of dry p . q . . winters set in, but the sum taken for the contract for the collection of the tax seems to have increased rather than decreased ; in 1901, the contract for the sheep tax in Persian Seistan was 22,000 kran {vide page 232) ; the tax was then 1 kran for 15 animals, and making allowance for the profits of the contractors, it may be assumed that there were not far short of 400,000 taxable animals in the country before the sickness and drought reduced the flocks in 1902. It is true that, in the year 1901, the tax was raised from 15 to 10 sheep a kran to maintain the letting value of the contract, but the contract itself was based on the lower tax. The count made in 1904 does not include lambs under a year old, so that 170,000 may be taken as the number of the taxable animals that survived the disastrous years ending with 1902 in Persian Seistan. This estimate of the number of sheep and goats to be found in the country, at the time of the prosperity of its flocks, is of course likely to be largely out, but it is the best that can be made from the information available. Stock is outside our experience, and we should not have been able to take this subject up at all were it not that the Baluchi has all the information at his finger’s tips ; so that industry to write it down is alone needed. Any one, say a wool dealer, whose knowledge of stock enables him to criticise their details, could arrive at a very accurate knowledge of the stock in the country. The sheep and the goats of Afghan Seistan are said to have suffered more Afghan Seistan. fr ?&gt;™ th . e drought and sichness than those of Persian Seistan, and it is freely stated among the flock-onwers that only one-third survived. This makes a total of nearly 300,000 sheep and goats, as having been in existence, before the drought and the sickness began. In Afghan Seistan the tax is not collected in contract, but by the Govern ment themselves, in the same way, as the cattle-tax which has been explained on page 208, hence the amount of the revenue from this source is not obtainable from among the people, since they have no means of knowing what it is. The total number of the sheep and goats liable to be taxed in Persian and Afghan Seistan, before the bad years set in, was then probably 700,000 animals. -Chap. XXXIX. ] 227 Price of sheep and goats.

From large flocks of 300 or over, one ram, at present prices, valued at 20 to 30 krdn y is taken. From smaller flocks an animal of less value is recovered; the tax is similar, and raised at the same time as pdkhdli 2\rea.&amp;y described on page 219. The tax is called alafchar-i-gusfand y and is distinguished from the pdkhdli tax by most Baluchis, though some use the expression alafchar'i-gusf and for the same tax, called pdkhdli. If, however, the Firari flock-owner remains one year in the country, 1 krdn is taken as a tax for every 15 to 20 sheep ; if the flock remains into the second year, full rates are charged. From two to ten flocks come across from Afghan Seistan on a visit to Persian Seistan each year. The Kadkhuda of the flock-owners obtains permission from the Hashmat-ul-Mulk both at coming and going. In Afghan Seist&amp;n formerly the flocks {firdri) that came from Persian . , c .., Seistan were taxed at a reduced rate of In Afghan Seutan. , , . . _ . 1 kran per 10 animals. But it was found that these people then settled in the country and endeavoured to escape being entered in the books as kardri flocks ; so that all are now taxed at one krdn for 5 sheep the same as those entered in the books. When the firari flocks return to their country they have to pay tax there, just the same as if they had been in their own country all the season. Method of collecting the tax. In Persian Seistan the collection of the sheep and goat tax is usually leased . w . 0 . (ijdra) to a separate collector than the In Persian Seistan. ' ■ / ' . ,t r n ,• r . . one to whom the collection of the cattle tax is leased. * The terms firari and karari are explained in Chapter XXXVI, page 209. [C639FD] QQQ232 [Chap. XL- The contractor receives a written authority from the Hashmat-ul-Mulk to collect the tax, and then sends out sowars to recover the cash from the °wners. It is said that those sowars who furnish their own horses receive one-tenth of what they collect as commission in lieu of wages. Some say that the_ maldar has to feed both the sowar and his horse, and anyone he bnngs with him. Some graziers say that this costs them 4 krdn a flock. Others say that the Kadkhuda of the khel of the flock-owners makes the tax-collector his horsemen, camelmen and footmen, his guests, while they are at the khel and in return the tax-collector does not collect the sheep-tax from the flocks of the Kadkhuda himself; whilst, if the Kadkhuda does not thus entertain them, the tax-collector feeds his servitors himself. The servitor takes a kran m every 10 of tax from each flock-owner from whom he collects the tax ; this gift is called fiul-i-gullak. These details in the collection of the tax vary much with different tax-collectors, and, as a general rule, the tax is not harshly enforced and the tax-collector is usually a man popular alike with the Governor and the graziers. The same remark applies to the collection of the cattle-tax. Many of the former tax-collectors* seem to be well remembered among the herd and flock-owners. The tax has not been collected since the spring of 1901, and no instruc tions had been issued about the collection Thetax in abeyance since 1901. of the tax up to May When collected it will probably be on the count of the year of the collection with arrears for the years from 1902 to the date of the collection ; the people recognise that it will be made at the rate of a krdn for 10 sheep. The ease with which taxes are increased in these countries, and the readiness with which they are paid, is a revelation to one accustomed to discuss his taxa tion at length through his representatives in Parliament. The ruler passes an order, and it is forthwith known to all, and is accepted, and if reasonable, the tax is paid ; if not, is evaded. The tax is collected in June and July, when the flock-owners return from the hills and have pitched their blanket tents Time of collecting the tax. (sidh khdna or falas) in the wheat and the barley fields to graze their flocks on the stubble. Some say that the tax-collectors and his servants do not go to the hills to . , , collect the tax, but await the return of the &amp; flock-owners to the cultivated tract and then collect the arrears due. Others say that the tax-collector travels out to the nearer hills that are within a day’s ride of the western shore of the Hamun. Those flock-owners, who remain out on the farther hills all the year, are expected to send in the sum due from them as tax. To encourage them to be honest and do so, and also as some recompense for the trouble, the tax- collector is said to let off the tax on 50 or 60 sheep. This, too, is a detail that varies with different tax-collectors, and the sort of year it is. If the water and the grazing is so good in the hills, that large numbers of the flock-owners do not come down, it is worth the while of the collector to go to them. In Afghan Seistan this tax is collected by the local Governor on a count made ’ in Afghan Seistan some years ago; the count has been remade in 1905, at the same time, and the same way, as the cattle count which has been described at page 208. There are various methods of collecting pdkhdlitax. In one method the Kad- Method of collecting the Pakhoiu khuda the Aock-owners with the assist- ance of two or three of the cultivators collects the animals, and drives them to the city, and makes them over to the Musiaufi, or Secretary of the Governor. This method is a collection by awdni, * One Wali Muhummad of the Taifa Mishmust came from Afghan Seistan and took the contract to collect the tax for the sheep and goats for 12,000 kran ; at that time the tax was Only I krdn for 15 animals ; later on he gave 15.000 krdn of the tax. Later still Mirza Zainal gave 18,000 kran and after some time Mirza Ghulam gave 20,000 krdn for this tax. In recent times Mir Abbas Kaiantar of Iskil gave 22,000 krdn for the same contract up to A.D. 1901 • so that he was the contractor during the period that the sheep and the goats began to die from scarcity of fodder during the dry years of I- 0 sustain the contract he induced the Hashmat-ul-Mulk to raise the tax for the year 1901 to one krdn on ten sheep and goats. The people assert confidently that the contractor made 4,000 kran a year profit- this would be not more than 15 per cent, on the total sum collected. ’ f Mr. Keyes writes that the contract has been let in 1905 to Sher Ali Khan, Kadkhuda of Buu-i-Afghan, for 20.000 kran, who is also to collect the arrears of tax due for 1902 and 1903: it is not said on what terms the arrears are to be collected, I I2 33 Chap. XL.] Kalla Curgi or Kalla Girt. i.e t) on the honour of the individual, and is only made in the villages, where the revenue is collected by the Sar Mashrif, so that he can supervise the collection. If the collection of the land revenue is leased, the tax on flocks is sold as a part of that lease. The collector of the village is usually the Kadkhuda, and the flock-owners, who have squatted on the village lands, are probably connections of his; under these circumstances he may forego the tax from them; but not from strangers. Some times the tax is collected by the same collector who collects the pul- i-sar rama, but not often. The contract for collecting the tax in those villages where the revenue col lection has not been given out in contract is, however, usually let as a separate contract. The contractor then goes forth accompanied by two or three of the Governor’s men, and two or three men of his own. He collects either in cash or kind, but he pays Government only in kind. One year Haji, the pish-ukhidmat of Sartip Mir Ma’sum Khan, had the contract to collect the tax. The last to collect this tax was Ali Akbar of Chah Nima, who is said to have paid 500 sheep for the contract, and to have made a large profit. Since then the collection of this tax has, like the sheep tax, also been in abeyance. A tax discontinued about 10 years ago was levied on sheep in Persian Seistan, c2\\q&lt;\ Kalla-i-Gurgi (wolf’s head). The Hashmat-ul-Mulk at that time reward ed any one who killed a wolf (Gurg) by giving him a lungi&gt; or a coat worth from 1 to 20 krdn. Such rewards are also discontinued. The wolfs head was then carried round among the flock-owners, and a tax of a sheep a flock collected. Only one wolfs head was so carried round each year. At the time kalla-i-gurgi was paid the tax called alafchar-i-gusfand does not seem to have been in existence. Konl Girt. Another tax, that is not now recovered, was Kont Giri (Kont Baluchi, KontGirf. Seistan shdl, % Persian a woven woollen floor cloth having black and red stripes). The contractor of the pul sar-i-rama had orders to collect for the Hashmat- ul-Mulk 50 shdl from the flock-owners at the rate of one shdl y worth 30 krdn from a flock of 300 sheep, and from the owners of smaller flocks a shdl oi less value. So far as can be gathered now, the collection of these skdl was not a contract with the tax-collector, but a part of his duty. But doubtless he collected a great many more shdl than he was ordered to collect and the tax was very un popular. The reasons why the taxes— kalla-i-gurgi and kont ^zW—have been given up, and alafchar-i-gusfand instituted, could not be traced among the flock-owners themselves. The owners of animals found trespassing among the crops are liable to be Fines for trespass. fined a krdn per sheep or goat; this fine is called pul-t-kharaba. To avoid such fines the flock-owner endeavours to keep up friendly relations with the villagers on whose land he pitches his camp, and to this end mutual courtesies are encouraged by many of the flock-owners, who send a gift of a fat lamb {barra-i-kabdbi) to the kadkhuda ; if the friendly feeling is recognised, the Kadkhuda sends in return one or two krdn worth of grain.

The pdkhdli contract is let separately, so, if the contract for the sheep tax proper is 22,000 or 25,000 krdn, there would be a considerable loss on the pre sent count; doubtless this is the reason the contract has not let since the year 1901. It has been shown that there is reason to believe that the numbers were once 400,000 which were taxed at 15 to the krdn, yielding 26,666 krdn. In 1901, the contract was taken up, though at a tax of 10 instead of 15 animals a krdny from which we may surmise that the losses from 1896 to 1901 had been in about that ratio.

Sheep shearing* The income of a sheep-owner is from the woo], the annual increase and from the milk, ghi and kurud, whilst the expenditure is on the shepherd, the sheepdog, the taxes, and tips to the tax-gatherer’s sowars, on sheep shearing and the up keep of his tent. These will now be dealt with in turn. Sheep are sheared (pashnt chidan) twice a year—in the Spring and in the Yield of wool and goat’s hair. Autumn. The Spring fleece yields only .... . . four sir Seistani of cleaned wool, the sheep being then in poor condition and the ewes in Iamb ; but an Autumn fleece cflves t) sir Seistam of cleaned wool, while the best fleeces will weigh as much as 10 sir Seistani. When a lamb is six months old it is shorn for the first time and will yield about two Seistani of cleaned wool {pashm-i-shusta).* Unwashed wool is called pashm-i-ndshusta \ the sheep are washed a week before they are shorn. Goats are only dipt in Spring. Kids of one year are dipt. The hair of the e-goat kept for breeding is only of value for rope-making and such like purposes. About 3 sir Seistani of hair is obtained from a goat and two sir from a kid. The flock-owners and the shepherds help each other to shear the sheep ; Labour for shearing. labourers are not usually hired for this . • u , .. , f 1 r ^ ork * But the ow ner, whose sheep are being sheared, provides the food for all the workers for the morning meal only • this is reckoned at 5 Seistani of food.

The simplest way to estimate the cost of the shearing to the flock-owner is to assume that the entertainment of his friends will cost as much as to hue labourers ; that is, ^th of the wool shorn. The method of shearing affects the income of the shepherd, in that he obtains r 0 th of the wool that comes to the owner, so that he gets less wool if the shearers are paid in wool instead of being fed. The price of cleaned wool of course varies with the market, and there has Price of wool snd goat’s hair. been a large rise in price due to the recent ,1 , f , . . , lar g e loss of animals; previous to 1002 the rate for cleaned wool was six krdn for a Seistani man and 4 krdn for un cleaned wool, while in 1902, the rates were 8 and 6 krdn respectively in iqoq it was 12 kran a man Seistani, The price of goat’s hair is the same as that for cleaned wool.

This is a larger difference from the present value of the produce given above than would be expected* Annual increase. On page 237 the number of animals in a well-arranged flock has been given. Such a flock has 75 ewes and 25 she-goats. In ordinary years, as has been explained on page 225, the Iambs will be 90 per cent, of the ewes, and the annual increase from such a flock will be 67 lambs. There will be a kid for each she-goat on the average; that is, 25 for the flock. There are two ways of considering the value of the lambs and kids. First their value when they come into possession of the shepherd, and second the value they have when the flock-owner parts with them, The shepherd, either takes his lambs when they are weaned, or he takes them as 6-month old lambs {vide page 241). In either case the lambs may be valued at present prices from 6 to 8 krdn, and the kids at from 4 to 5 krdn. The flock-owner sells the increase of his flock as yearlings, when the value of the lamb is about 15 krdn and of a kid about 12 krdn. But it is not likely that the whole of the increase of his ewes and his she-goats will live to be sold, and we may estimate, for the purpose of this enquiry [C639FD] s $s240 [Chap. XL I. that he will have 51 lambs (less the 67 paid to the shepherd), or 44*3 lambs, and 20 (less 2*5 paid to the shepherd), or 17*5 kids to sell. The shepherd takes 10 per cent, of the lambs, as will be explained further on. Before 1902 merchants, who came from these places, took the male sheep and goats in the Spring to Quetta, Bam, Sale of surplus stock. Narmashir and Kerman for sale. But in 1902 the flocks were so much reduced in number that the demands of the Mission in 1903 were enough to absorb the surplus stock available for sale. In 1904 three chobddv came from Meshed and took away about 75 ° wethers. In 1905 the flock-owners said that a chobddr t Ismail, and his two sons, had come from Meshed, and had bought by the end of April one thousand wethers, and said that they would buy five hundred more: there were no goats among this flock 5 ewes are neither sold nor bought. There are no merchants in Seistan, who take sheep away to sell corresponding to the gao jalab kash—vide foot note, page 204. Wethers are bought and taken away by merchants (chobddr) from the distant markets. The merchants come to purchase the animals so as to obtain them in time to travel over the roads when the spring grazing is at its prime and the water- supply has just been renewed by the rains. The owners of the sheep taken from Persian Seistan for sale abroad must obtain a rdhddri from the taz-kara-chi, and pay a krdn for 10 animals. No tax is charged for sales inside Persia. Bdjgiri .—The surplus stock of Afghdn Seistdn is said to be brought into Persian Seistan to be sold to merchants from Quetta and Meshed, and few sales occur within the country. A tax of a krdn for every three sheep sold is recovered within or without the country. The tax is called bajgiri. Milk } ghi and kurud. A sheep gives 5 sir Seist&amp;ni of milk, twice a day, though exceptional sheep will give 10 sir. The morning milk is Yield of milk and ghi. taken by the owner and the evening milk is given to the lambs. From one man of milk about 4 sir of ghi is made. The butter yields ghi in the ratio of 4 to 3. A good she-goat gives 10 sir Seistani of milk a day, and an ordinary one 8 sir ; while the kid drinks less than a lamb, but goat’s milk does not yield so much butter as ewe’s milk. The milk of Autumn is said to give more butter than the milk of Spring. If the flock-owner does not go to the hills, he makes a contract to give the chaupdn (shepherd) one-third of the ghi that he brings back. This is the form of contract that the chaupdn prefers, as he is not tied down to take scrupulous care of the ghi, and bring all of it back to the owner. But the dock-owner prefers to stipulate for a definite quantity of ghi from the flocks. As a rough rule* a flock of 75 ewes and 25 she-goats in milk should give 6 or 7 man Seistani of ghi, while on the hills in a year of normal grazing, and 3 man of ghi, if the flock is kept for grazing on the Seistan plains. The contract is till the milk dries up. But the chaupan will only make such contracts in good years. On the average of years 5 man Seistani of ghi\ per 100 animals in milk may be reckoned to be the annual yield of ghi. * The weight oi ghi produced annually may be calculated as follows:— Seist&amp;ni 7 n an. Persian Seistdn ewes at 5 wiaw Seistdni per cent. ... ... ... SapS Afghan Seistan 21,305 ewes at 5 Seistani percent. ... . ... 1,065 4^63 In good years the yield will be more than this. In 1903 the Kadkhuda Darwish of Deh Luf gave juma his a contract of 3f waw SeistSni for a flock of 100 animals in milk. In 1904 he gave the same man the contract of 7 wan Seistani of ghi on 170 animals in milk. The animals in milk where three-quarters ewes and one-quarter she-goats.241 Chap. XU,] * Perrier’s Caravan Journeys, page 279. The rate for ghi is 2-J to 3 sir Seistani a krdn. The owner of a well-arranged flock would get about 67 krdn worth of ghi in the year. From the butter milk kurud or karut called by the Seistani gharut is made- This is a great article of diet through- Yieid of Jcarut. out faese regions; it is thus described by General Ferrier,* who often lived on it— »&lt; When karut is well prepared it is excellent, though I believe unknown in Europe; in Persia it is calledIt is thus prepared : some butter milk is boiled in a very laro-e saucepan by which means the watery particles escape in the form of steam, and the solid ones are deposited at the bottom of the vessel ; when sufficiently thickened the mass is divided, and made into little balls about the size of a pigeon’s egg, which are dried in the sun and will keep for years. When required these balls of concentrated grease are con tinuously stirred in hot water in a metal dish, till completely dissolved ; the epicures add a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, which gives the sauce an exquisite flavour. It js poured over the bread, maize, or meal which it is intended to season just at the moment it is to be served. Kesht is used with meat, but more particularly with black cucumbers and fish.” The average outturn of karut from a flock of 100 ewes in milk is 30 man Seistani a year; the value of this at 15 Seistani 3. krdn is 80 krdn. The price of karut varies from 10 to 20 sir Seistani a krdn. The churn used is a sheep skin (mushak) into which the cream and milk are put and the mushak agitated. This -is The chum. done in two ways—one in which the skin is laid on the ground and the contents are agitated by working the skin to and fro with the hand ; in the other, the skin is slung from a tripod of sticks and then agitated. The shephered. Each flock of about 150 sheep has a shepherd. Shepherds are engaged from Nauruz to Nauruz, and a flock-owner reckons years by the names of his shepherds. ** That happened in the year Ah served me, since which I have had JMaharo- madi, Nazar and Safar as chaupanT Formerly, when the shepherd was engaged, he received pishmuzd, or an advance of one male or female kid or lamb from the flock but since 1897 this is only given when the owner does not himself accom- pany’the flock to the hills, but 'entrusts it to the shepherd. Some flock-owners give their shepherd, if well pleased with him, 10 or 15 imw in cash for this pishmuzd. The chaupan is paid by a percentage of the wool and milk products of the ewes, and he also receives his clothing and his bread. Some chaupan are paid one-tenth of all the lambs born during their term of service ; such a shepherd is called chau~ Hispercentage of the lambs. pdn-i-dah yaki. Others engage to be paid one six-month old lamb (half male and half female) for each ten ewes of the flock, A shepherd hired on these terms is called chaupdn-i-namtr. The flock-owner usually protects himself from deficiency of lambs through losses by bargaining to pay only 9 or 8| per cent, instead of 10 per cent, of the lambs. Very few chaupan are engaged on these terms. The chaupan-i-dah yaki may be leaving at the lambing time {Nauruz') ; in that case he leaves his lambs with the flock-owner until they are weaned, and then he comes and fetches them. The principle underlying this is, that the shepherd gets the lambs of the ewes he has taken care of. These lambs now-a-days are worth about 6 krdn and kids about 5 krdn, but formerly they were only worth half of these prices. The flock-owner takes the whole of the less valuable Spring fleece. But the shepherd takes one-tenth of the more His percentage of the wool. valuable Autumn fleece. The division is usually made by the owner arranging for the shearing of 9 sheep, while the chau pan shears the fleece from the tenth for himself ; or the wool obtained from the shearing may be divided out between them. If there are only goats in the flock, the incoming chaupan receives one-tenth of the hair dipt in the Spring from the goats. But in mixed flocks of sheep and242 [Chap. XLI. goats he takes wool only at the Autumn shearing, the fleece of a small sheep or a lamb being allowed for every goat in the flock ; the fleeces of lambs are given, so that the total weight of wool shall be equal to the total weight of goat hair. The shepherd is given clothes at the rate of one Seistani yard of country cloth (kzrbds) for each 20 sheep that The cost of clothing the shepherd. , , , , , i .i • V ,1 • he herds ; such country cloth is at this time worth about 2 yards Seistdni a krdn; the rate in 1902 is said to have been 3 yards a krdn. This cloth is given at the time the yearling lambs are counted, and the shepherd’s income from this source may be valued at 5 krdn. The flock-owner also furnishes his shepherd with three pairs of boots (kafsh locally pronounced kaush) at the cost of about 4 or 5 krdn a pair. The chaupan-i-namir is also given a namda^ (cloak), weighing one man Seistani of washed wool, worth about 8 or 12 krdn according to the price of wool. If the shepherd does not live with the flock-owner, an advance of meal for making bread is also given to the shepherd at the time he starts for the hills at the The cost of the food of the shepherd. following rates:— If the flock contains 100 or 150 animals, he receives 20 sir Seistdni of meal per head of the female animals of the flock of one year of age or over. If the flock contains more than 150 animals, then from 10 to 15 sir Seistani of meal per head is given to the shepherd for each female animal over a year old in the flock. The allowance is paid two parts wheat meal and one part barley meal, but some shepherds are paid one man Seistani of grain for every pair and some for every three animals in the flock. In this count the wethers and yearling lambs as well as ewes are counted. The grain paid is half wheat and half barley. The value of this allowance may be priced at 33! Seistani man of wheat at one man for a krdn ; 33-! man of barley at ij man a krdn ; the total value is about 56 krdn. In lieu of ghi the milk of four sheep is allowed to the shepherd. These sheep are called by the Baluchis dinu-i-chaupan ) and the value of their milk to the shepherd may be estimated at 3 krdn. These allowances are only paid to married shepherds, or to the shepherds in sole charge of flocks. Unmarried shep herds live with, and are fed by the flock-owner. The monthly allowances for such a shepherd who goes away with the flock for a short time by himself is 7J man Seistani of meal. Stray sheep unclaimed are called ori rama ; such sheep are divided equally stray sheep. between shepherd and owner. If the shep herd has had no pishmnzd, he takes all the stray sheep. This arrangement seems a direct incentive to sheep stealing. The shepherd, who takes out the sheep and goats of the cultivator to graze, is The villas shepherd called chanaka chardn. Heis paid at the The ge shepherd. time the spring harvest is divided half a man Seistani of grain, half wheat and half barley per animal per annum. People, who have more than 3 sheep, give the shepherd one-tenth of the wool also, but those who have not got 10 sheep give him one instead of half a of grain. He is also furnished with boots, and gets one gaz dehati (5 feet 9 inches) of cotton cloth for every 20 sheep. In this account wethers and yearling lambs as well as ewes are counted.

XL!.] well, or the canal, and the lambs and kids are allowed to go to their mothers for milk ; a lively scene then ensues that may be witnessed in Spring at the tents of those flock-owners who have not taken their flocks to the hills. At two or three months’ old the flock of lambs and kids is removed to a dis tance from that of the ewes, and they are weaned. After this is done the mother’s milk soon dries up. An unweaned lamb is called by the Baluchi masund the weaned lamb ragah. The flute is called nai zadani. Every flock-owner and shepherd has a flute on which to play to .keep himself awake X it 6 snepnerd s niieC* i r 11 * iiji with the charms or the music, so that he may w T atch his flock with skill. They make these flutes from reeds obtained from the Kaccha Kiih and Kuh-i-Malusan; these are considered to be the best. Those obtained from Kuh-i-Wawaila, or from the gardens in Seistan, produce flutes of inferior tone. Those reeds which have the knots far apart send their sound further, perhaps, 1,000 feet at day time ; such reeds are called nai garau. Reeds, whose knots are close, are called nai guti, the sound from flutes made from them, travels only half the above distance. A straight reed is chosen having 6 knots, and which extends 5 fingers’ breadth beyond the first knot for the mouth end, and three fingers’ breadth beyond the sixth knot for the end, of the flute. The diaphragm at the knot is pierced by means of a hot ramrod. With a knife the skin of the reed is pared along a narrow strip from the 6th knot upwards to between the 3rd and 4th knots. The holes are located on this narrow strip, one on each side of the 4th and 5th knots ; in all 4 holes ; the upper tw r o to be played by the two fingers of the left hand, and the lower two with the same fingers of the right hand. The holes should be small (-|th or f^th of an inch in diameter) and direct ly in the axis of the flute. The reed is bound at the knots by bands made of fresh sinews from the peck of a sheep or a camel; these bands not only make the flute strong, but it is said they also improve the tone. The expenses of a shepherd to the flock-owner may now be abstracted as Abstract of the cost of a shepherd to the flock- follows • Kran.

The sheep dog is usually obtained as a puppy from a friend ; if bought, it is Thedo considered to be of the same value as a male lamb or kid, say, about 4 krdn.

The dog is fed by the owner, and is allowed 5 sir Seistani of arddwa (crushed barley) mixed in cold water at evening ; this mess is called by the Seistani galor (kalor).

These animals by their increase and milk products are a source of revenue. It is, however, not worth while to enter into a lengthy description of camel-owning, seeing that Seistan is not a country for camels. But in order to estimate the value to the flock-owner of the camels and the donkeys he keeps, it may be explained that some of the poorer men hire these animals ; before 1902 the hire of the camel to take the flock-owner to the hills, and bring him back again was 36 krdn and that of a pair of donkeys was 20 kran ; the hire is now (1904) 50 and 30 krdn respectively. The animals are made over to the hirer and the proprietor of the animal does not send any one with them. The Fa las or blanket tent. These unique habitations are formed of ribs made of long thin tamarisk poles bent to a half-hoop shape, and over these a large, long covering made of black wool is spread. The ends of these long blankets are made fast by ropes to pegs in the ground, and the tents are open all around. Usually a fence of bushes, or reeds, or whatever material may be handy on the spot, is built as a wall or wind-fence to the north by the west of the tent. The possessions of the family are kept in bags made of carpets, or woven from wool yarn, and are stored at the sides or the back of the tent, and the avocations of the family are pursued in the shade of the blanket covering in full view of all who pass. In front of the tent is the tanur, or oven, to bake the daily bread ; also the tripod from which the skin churn is hung; and to either flank are the pens for the lambs Somewhere in the shade lie two or three oig sheep dogs, who rush out at every passer-by. The cost of the blanket tent is from 50 to 60 krdn, and it will last about 10 years. The annual depreciation may be estimated at about 6 krdn. Such repairs as are required are, however, done by the owner. The flock-owners throughout Baluchistan and Seistan, and I am told through out middle Asia, pitch their camps at a considerable distance from the well, or other source of supply. This is probably done for various reasons ; they thus avoid the direct notice of travellers ; they get nearer to their grazing ; they are able to keep the different camps further apart, and thus avoid difficulties with the flocks. It is doubtful if the preservation of the water-supply is the main object. I have heard all the above reasons given before this one. It will now be possible to summarize the income and the expenditure of the .. t ( . , ,. f f flock-owner, It may be assumed that he has Abstract of the income and expenditure or a flock-owner.

The prices current previous to 1902 affect all the above items, except per haps the tent, and the flock-owner’s expenditure would then have been about 150 to 175 krdn. Before making a profit and loss account, it is necessary to work out the cost of renewing the flock. The lambs and kids The renewal of the floe,r. produced each year have been estimated as sold and none have been reserved from them for the renewal of the flock, as the 100 ewes and she-goats have been estimated to produce 71 saleable yearlings (including those given to the shepherd as his dues) ; the difference between the mothers and the progeny is an allowance for those that fail to grow up to be sold. A ewe will give 5 to 7 lambs, and a she-goat 7 to 10 kids ; if these are assumed to come at the rate of 1 per annum, one-sixth of the ewes and half of the she-goats must be replaced each year, while the males may be assumed to last for 10 years. The cost of doing this is— ' Description. At present prices. Prices before 1902. - Kran. Kran. Kran. Kran. 12| Ewes @ 30 375 @ *3 163 3!

About i=;o to 200 krdn should suffice for this, so that, formerly, about 1,900 kran was sufficient to start a Baluchi with a flock, whilst now he would require about 4,300 krdn to effect the same object. This is verv similar to the result arrived at for the cattle-owner on page 211.Chap. XLLJ 247 Profit andloss account.

The result of the enquiries since made among Baluchis on the above results go to show that the Baluchi is thrifty and careful with his gains, that he hoards surplus cash earnings in good years, sometimes by burying the cash in the ground, though some lend money to the traders with whom they deal for the sale of their products ; they say they reckon to make 20 per cent, per annum on their money in this way. But the risk must be very great, and the average interest spread over a life-time of expenditure is probably small. It is said that there is an increasing disposition among the Baluchis to collect cash, and either hoard, or invest it in trade, whereas formerly all the profits were invested in increasing the size of the flocks. If disease, famine, or flood swept the flock away, the owner had no resource left. An institution like the local branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia should be a great boon to the Baluchi flock and herd-owners, who have the reputation of being more thrifty and businesslike in money affairs than the Persian following the same calling. The annual “value of the labour devoted by Baluchi women to the making of carpets ) shal bags (juw r al), felts (namda), etc. Many of the Baluchi women in the flock-owner’s family, in addition to the toil of the usual duties of the house-hold, employ themselves working up the wool and hair of the sheep and goats into carpets, etc. They employ themselves in this way all the year round, but the largest outturn is in the cool, calm months from August to November, when the camp is settled down in the cultivated tract, and the shearing of the autumn fleeces which produces the best w r ool is brought in. Some enquiries were made to obtain an idea of the value of the labour expended in this work from which the following examples are given:— For^a s/m/50 square feet in area the following expenditure on wool and dye was incurred :— Making a shdl — 1 man Seistani 8 sir of wool valued at Kran. ... 15 Ditto dye do. ...

From these examples it will be seen that the remuneration of the women varies much with the quality of the carpet they make. The figures include the labour of spinning the yarn which is dope by the men. Apparently only the Baluch women in the flock-owner’s family are skilled in this class of work, and not all of them labour at the work, and those who do labour do not of course work full time. For the purpose of^ pn estimate we may assume that one woman in about half^ the number of families of the flock-owners does this work for three full months in the year, and that the value of her labour is 30 krdn a month at the prices that ruled, when wheat was 1 krdn a Seistani man. The annual value of the labour expended in making carpets, shdl, etc., in cluding the labour in spinning the yarn, would therefore be— Kran.

This count may be considered normal for the country, as there has been no unusual sickness or influx of these animals. In Afghan Seistan the sale of horses and camels is taxed {bajgiri) at 5 per Horges cent, on the valuation in the same way as the sale of the cattle and sheep. Mules have not been included in the count. The Hashmat-ul-mulk takes, as a sort of perquisite, all the mules born in Seistan, so that no one breeds them. Mu!es# The Hashmat-ul-Mulk has 61 mules and there are a few others belonging to in fluential Saiyads, or Kazis. The Hakim of Chakhansur has 10 mules. The country is an unhealthy one for horses and camels, but there is no reason to think that the number of these animals is either greater, or less, than usual. The demands of the Mission caused by the loss of animals from sickness are said to have raised the general price of horses from 200 krdn to 700 krdn, and of camels from 100 or 200 krdn to 500 or 600 krdn, and the average value of the horse or camel was perhaps 500 krdn, but this is more a guess than a reliable estimate. There were not enough suitable animals in the country to supply the demands of the Mission, and those who needed horses or camels had to make the best of the undersized animals they could procure.

The Persian soldier is never seen abroad except with hi s donkey, loaded with himself, his rifle and bedding. . As in Spain, all venerable old men, priests and women ride donkeys, livery influential man keeps some donkeys to carry either his family or his friends on gala occasion . The Seistani donkey is a valued animal and is well treated and cared for, half- starved, galled and mained animals are very se dom met with. Several breeds of donkeys are recognised in the country of^ which the following four may be noticed ; the Breeds - Ispahani, the Bandari (Bandar Abbas), Turshizf, and the Seistdni, or local donkey. Ispahdni donkey.— Ispahani donkeys are large and black in colour; are of two kinds; theridingand the baggage animal. The riding animals have two varieties ; the Gaza having black knees and a redish tinge m the colour and the Surkha, a mouse-coloured donkey. The baggage animal has a white b aze on the forehead, and is called lala puz. Traders in cattle, who go as far as Ispahan to sell their herds, purchase a donkey or two there for 20 to 25 tuman, and sell them again in Seistan for 25 to 30 tunidn. Bandari donkey.—The Bandari breed are, however, the most highly prized donkeys for riding; they are small, of mouse-colour and have lovely paces. I his is the breed that the well-to-do and influential people keep They are seldom or never used to carry loads. The price of a good animal of this breed in beis- tan is from 30 to 40 tumdn. Turshizi donkey. —The Turshizf breed are white donkeys of large size. Their skin is said to be thin ; they become badly bitten by the gadfly {magas) which is believed to be the cause of all sickness among animals in Seistan. These donkeys are seldom seen in Seist&amp;n, as they are said not to thrive well. The Seistdni donkeys are small and are for the most part used to carry loads; these are the donkeys that are seen everywhere either at work or at graze.253 Chap. XLIL] Price of donkeys .—A good useful donkey, before the Mission arrived in the country, could be bought for 50 hr an ; but the price asked in May 1905, when the Mission was going, was 100 krdn for either the male or female; doubtless the price has now become normal. Some 50 small donkeys were bought and used by the camp followers to carry them on the journey back, and they all served their lucky owners right w 7 elh No attempt has been made to classify the donkeys by quality, so it is difficult to say what the average value of a donkey is in Seistan, but 50 krdn must be somewhere near the mark. At three years old the donkey is considered old enough to bear burdens ; ^ after his sixth year his price declines ; at iee mg on eys. 8 or 9 years he is considered old ; his life is about 10 to 12 years. A she-donkey will give 6 foals in her lifetime. Entire donkeys, like entire horses, are considered the more honourable of the two sexes for riding, so that probably not 30 per cent, of the donkeys are females ; the number of foals are perhaps not more than 10 per cent, per annum of the count: if so, the numbers should be stationary. It is believed too that the imports and exports of donkeys balance. Many of the donkeys are in the possession of carriers by trade, called kharkdr ; these people are of the Farsi Pack earners. taifa of jur in the list of tribes on page 12 of Chapter I; Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh suggests that jur is derived from tajir, a trader, in some parts wrongly pronounced tajur. They take goods, such as melon seeds, mash, mak, wool, ghi and feathers to Kirman and Narmashir, and bring back henna, dates, hair dye, and opium prepared for smoking. Any donkeys that are not needed to bring return-loads are sold. In each family of this taifa jur some 10 or 12 donkeys will be found. A donkey of the Seistan breed is a necessity to the cultivator, to bring in bushwood for fuel, to carry the Govern- The usefulness of the donkey. tQ ^ ^ to bring jn his share of the grain and watermelons and to carry himself or family on a visit to his relations, or to a shrine. The cattle-owners, as has already been said, only keep a few donkeys, so also do the Saiyads. The flock-owners keep a good many to carry their camps when on the move in Seistan ; some only are taken to the hills with the flocks when they go. The small Seistan donkey, when ridden, is caused to move along quickly by some riders in a brutal way. A rough cord A cruel method of riding a donkey. is p asse d round the flanks to the pack On which the man sits. This cord establishes a raw on either flank, and the donkey moves his little legs rapidly to try and keep the raw from the string ; as the donkey’s energies flag the string is drawn tighter. The donkey does not suffer from disease like a horse or camel. The Seis- tani says this is because his hide is thicker than that of either of these animals, and so he is not so much bitten. But if he is badly bitten by the gadfly the lymphatic glands swell up and the donkey usually dies. Firing is the only known remedy, and this is not often successful. The sickness is called aman biniari. Another disease from which the donkey suffers is called lagri. The donkeys are however as healthy as the men, the cattle, the goats and the sheep ; a dead donkey was just as rare a sight in Seistan. as it is believed to be in most countries.2 5 5 I CHAPTER XLIII.

Those, who catch the fish and net the wild-fowl in the waters among the reed beds that flank the lake on the Character o£ the Saiyad. ^ ^ He!mand disperses itself, are people apart from the rest of the population, and are called Saiyad, i.e., those who live by sport. As a class they appear smaller and are darker in com plexion than the cultivators of the country. This darkness is no doubt in some measure due to the life they lead on the water in a sunny land, though it may be the outcome of their origin. The life is a hard one and the living is precarious; if the inundations are poor the Saiyad has no means of subsistence, and he has no resources to fall back on. In 1902, when the Hamun dried it up, many are said to have died of starvation. They sell all the fresh catches of fish and fowl and themselves eat the stale food that cannot be sold ; their means of livelihood is not lucrative enough to enable them to accumulate wealth; they are all poor; though, as this account of them will shew, they are always hard at work, being an industri ous and skilled, though shy people. This hard work under great exposure and poor living accounts for their small stature. The people of the country look on them as the poorest, meanest and most timid in the land. A frequent expression used of them is ‘ ( Saiydd barakat nadaradf The cultivators, cattle-owners and flock-owners do not intermarry with Saiyads. But their means of livelihood keep them apart from the rest of the inhabitants, and it is probable that they are little understood. Some few families have obtained land to cultivate, and no longer follow the occupation of their tribe, Deh Saiyad, in the Miankangf near the head of the Sikhsar below Burj-i-As, is such a village. A few families work tutin (bulrush rafts, or cradles) on the ferries on the Rud-i- Seistan and Rud-i-Parian. Some of the Saiyads have a tradition that they lived on the Gaud-i-Zireh, and it seems certain, as stated on the bottom Ongm of the Sai;a s. of page 5 of Chapter I, that a residue of them must be descended from people who lived on the shores of the Seistan Lake from the most ancient times. But the people who now control the Saiyads, and who will be described further on, say that the Saiyads are the descendants of people who sought refuge in the Naizar (reed marshes) in times of trouble, and that they were first organized by one Jobakhsh Khan, who was an intelligent man in the time of Lutf Ali Khan, the local sovereign, when Nadir Shah invaded Seistan. Jobakhsh Khan ingratiated himself with Nadir Shah and his Wazir by supplying them with rare feathers from the rarer* birds that were caught in the Naizar. He is said to have classed the Saiyads by taifa (family or tribe), naming the taifa after the lands from which the refugees had come. Jobakhsh Khan is said to have received a written order from the Wazir of Nadir Shah, making him the headman of * It is still the customs for the local ruler on either side of the river to send presents of swans and down to his sovereign.

The present Arbab Muhammad Beg traces his descent from Jobakhsh Khan following way:— JOBAKHSH KHAN, Arbab of Saiyads soon after Nadir Shah’s invasion of Seistan. 1 Afzal KhAn. in the r Ali Beg.

Jobakhsh Khan is said to have built the fort, called Kalad-Arbab, about a, mile south of the Kuh-i-Khwaja, and it is said that he often had to defend himself there from the attacks of Mir Khan, Sarbandi, who ruled Seistan, as Mir Khan wished to take over the control of the Saiyads himself. Afzal Khan, the son, was a man of capacity like his father, and founded the village of Afzalabad on the eastern shore of the inundations near where the road across the Hamiin to Meshed starts, it is still the home of the Arbab. He also made a canal from the tail of the Rud-i-Dali, one of the channels of the Helmand in flow at that time, and irrigated a low area, called Kurg-i-Kal, to the north of the Rah-i-Gardawak, the road along which the Telegraph Line now crosses the inundated area; this canal he is said to have extended across the Shiir Rud to the Kuh-i-Khwaja. Ali Khan, Sarbandi, is said to have divided out the Saiyads into parties {pdgdo) to be described further on ; and to have appointed Ghulam Raza, i\rbab of the Shib-i-Ab, and Safdar Beg, the Arbab of the Pusht-i-Ab. This arrange ment continued till Arbab Ali died, when Muhammad Beg, the present Arbab, now an old and respected man, well known to the Mission, was placed in sole control of all the Saiyads. But Arbab Muhammad Beg is said not to have the energy and ability to manage men that his forebears had, and he was unable to collect and pay the taxes. The Amir Alam Khan, Hashmat-ul-Mulk, had therefore to make some other arrangement. He selected Kadkhuda Muhammadi of Deh Kamali, a man of capacity, and made him contractor (ijaradar) for the collection of the revenue from the Saiyads. Both the Hashmat-ul-Mulk^ and Kadkhuda- Muhammadi treated Arbab Muhammad Beg with consideration. He is still called Arbab and manages the Saiyads as Naib, or Mirza under Kadkhuda Muhammadi. He also enjoys the produce of some pdgdo of the Saiyads, which Kadkhuda Muhammadi allows him, and a free plough of land which Amir Alam Khan gave him. Formerly, in addition to the tax in cash, the Saiyads used to render such unpaid services to the Hashmat-ul-Mulk as their calling enables them to do *, such as to supply him with down and feathers for his own use or presents for his friends, swans for the same object, reed mats for his own use or for the musjids of the country ; but now the Hashmat-ul-Mulk has sold all these perquisites to the contractor, who receives these from each pagao, as will be described further on. The mats are, however, still supplied free to the Hashmat-ul-Mulk. The contractor is also said to send him gifts of wild fowl and fish from time to time, but this is probably only mehmani, i.e., hospitality rather than a due. Kadkhuda Muhammadi, the present Contractor, is son of Ali Murad, Bandani, Kadkhuda Muhammadi, Contractor for the Col* U. Farsi of the tttifci Mishmast, who came lection of the Saiyad revenue. with Amir Alam Khan to Seistan and showed great energy and capacity. He brought a large area of land in Deh Gazbur (or Deh Ali Murad Bandani) near Tappa-i-Adira under cultivation. He also made canals near the city ; and dug karez and wells near the hills Nar Ahu and Mada Ahu. ’Ali Murad also undertook the charge of the Amir’s herd of cattle, and kept them free of charge in the best grazing in the Naizar at Kang-i- Haidar. On his death the lands of Gazbur passed to his younger son Ibrahim, whilst Muhammad, the elder son, gained the favour of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, who gave him charge of his herds at Kang-i-Haidar* and made him Kadkhuda * The animals belonging to the Hashmat-ul-Mulk. The Hashmat-ul-Mulk has the following animals in the city :— 35 horses, 42 mules, 31 camels, 4 cows. The following animals are kept at Deh Kamali or at Kang-i-Haidar in the Naizar under the charge of Muhammadi, Kadkhuda of Deh Kamali, who is said to look after them without recompense.

When it was found that Arbab Muhammad Beg was unable to carry out the duties of headman of the Saiyads the Kadkhuda, as a man of tact, was selected by the Governor as contractor to take charge of and manage the Saiyads. The Saiyads themselves say that there are 400 families, and that each The tax on Saiyads. family, z. £., father, mother and unmarried children pays a tax of 6 a head as tnln-baiyadi, sometimes called Gham-i-Darya, as it is levied on those who earn their livelihood on the waters; also Nauruzi-i-Saiyddi, as it becomes due at Nauruz each year. In 1899 the Saiyads, who took Major Sykes out shooting, told him the same. But the figures obtained from Kadkhuda Muhammadi are larger than these • the explanation of the difference no doubt is that the Kadkhuda must keep to himself the fact that the revenues from the Saiyads is larger than is popularly supposed. r r J There are 691 families of Saiyads in Seistan, divided into 18 families as Number of families. shown in the accompanying statement No. Number Name of Taifa. of Remarks.* families. 1 Taifa -i-Kuhi ••• 40 Came from Baluchistan. 2 Hauzdari «f » «M 60 So-called after Hauzdar. 3 9) Deh Isai «•» •!« 20 So-called after the name of some person. 4 $9 Khwaja ...

All Saiyads pay some tax to Kadkhuda Muhammadi, but the tax varies a little in detail. Four hundred and sixty families, who earn their living in the Naizar, pay 6 k rdn a family and ten sir Seistani of feathers {kurk) and five sir * This is a lame and uninteresting account of the Saiyad taifa ; it was obtained from the iiaradar I have no experience in tracing out tribes, otherwise I feel sure I could have found some one in Seistan who could have given a more interesting account of the origin of the taifa name than this. * T.

Thirty-one families are Kadkhuda Kurd or Safid Risk (white beards) under the Arbab; they receive no fixed allowances from the Saiyads themselves, but they are exempt from taxes. They, however, give Kadkhuda Muhammadi an annual shir ini of one man Seistani of feathers, valued at 7 krdn. The Kadkhuda Kurd at the Kuh-i-Khwaja alone among the above is called Arbab. There are two hundred families who do not pay full taxes ; some of these are too old to work ; some work for Muhammadi himself, and some are favourites of his, but most are following other occupations. For instance, 50 families live by agriculture in such villages as Deh Saiyad in the Miankangf and Deh Tuti near the Kuh-i-Khwaja; these families pay only 3 krdn a family in cash to Kadkhuda Muhammadi; some families work tutin at ferries. He roughly classes these two hundred families into one hundred, who pay 3 krdn and feathers to the value of one krdn y and one hundred families who pay two krdn in cash and feathers valued at one krdn. It would appear that all Saiyad families are liable to be taxed at the full rate of six krdn ) but so long as the Kadkhuda is able to make a profit out of the contract, he is disinclined to refer matters to the Governor and takes what those, who no longer live in the Naizar, are ready to pay. The fifty families in Afghan Seistan pay two krdn a family, so as to retain Families living in Afghan Seistan. the good favour of the Kadkhuda, which , . &gt; Will be necessary to them should the Hamun-i-Puzak become dry, while there was water in the Hamun-i-Sdbari, or should they incur the displeasure of the Afghans and need to leave.

In addition to the cash and feathers above detailed, Kadkhuda Muhammadi The Contractor's share in the catches. ^ ^kare in each working party (pagao), . . m the catch is divided into seven shares instead of six; this share is hissa~i-mard-i-murda oxadam-i-murdci, equi- valent to our expression sleeping partner. This arrangement is one of his own divising and has not the sanction of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, at least so the Saiydd sa y,. since the Kadkhuda finances them when in difficulties they are happy- to give him this perquisite. They say that in the famine of 1902 he was the only man in the country who helped them through the famine. The head of the Saiyads needs to be a man of substance who can advance the tax in bad years and recover it in good years; and as the Saiyads are a necessity to the country to ferry people across the inundations, and also provide the much appreciated luxuries of fish and wild fowl as diet, as well as feathers for domestic use they are as a class an object of solicitude to the Governor and all who have large interests in the country. It is popularly believed that when the Hashmat-ul- Mulk went to Tehran in January 1904, he showed his appreciation of the way tjj? , Saiyads provided him with sport and conveyed him across the Hamun by reducing their tax for that year by one krdn per family.

Kadkhuda Muhammadi is also subsidised by the British and Russian Consulates and by the Belgian Customs to convey their mails as well as anv baggage that may go or come for them across the Hamun.

Perhaps one-half may he charged; if so, he pays from 3,500 to 3,600 kran a year for the contract from which he receives about 6,600 krdn. This is not a very large margin, seeing that he has to help the Saiyads in bad years, and some of the proceeds are of a kind which cannot always be sold. The grazing of the Naizar to which the cattle-owners take their herds has „ u c .. , f , already been described (see first page of Chapter XaaiII) ; the favorite fishing and wild fowling waters of the Saiyads lie in and among these thickets of reeds (nai) and bulrush (tut). These pieces of water are called Chung; they are for the most part open waters with reeds or bulrushes growing as islands or promontories in them so as to form excellent places for the wild fowler to conceal himself when working with his nets and snares. The meaning of words describing physical Jeatures. —It will be useful to explain the local names of the physical features of the Hamun and Naizar tract, as the words used occur frequently in composition for the names of places, and it is impossible to converse with a Saiyad to any purpose without a knowledge of their meaning. The Chung are connected by channels of slowly moving water called Shela through which the waters that are received from the river circulate to the Chung and eventually find their way to the broad expanse of open deep water, called Hamun. The Hdmun is the residual lake ; it is often called by the f Open water is often spoken of as daghdl; Sag ads tht Dai ja the lake IS Sometimes the same word is used by cultivators for flat open Spoken of as the Darya-i-Seistdll.

The high ridge separating different is called Lurg; sometimes such a Lurg is breached and water passes through the breach from Chung to Chung by the channel thus formed ; this channel is called Aukan (du for db water, kan from kandan to dig). Cattle tracts sometimes develop into channels carry ing water from one part of the Naizar to another, especially when a change in the river brings water to a part of the Naizar which has not recently had to deal with such large volumes from quite that direction; such channels are called gobur (go for gao cattle, bur from buridan to cut). A Kang is a piece of land entirely surrounded by water. A Paran is the highest part of some high lying land in the Naizar where Maldars or Saiyads put their habitations; a small protection embankment is built round the huts to save them from being flooded when a sudden high wind blows the water of the Hdmun over the Paran. Nairez is that part of the road through the marsh which requires to have a foot or so of depth of reeds put over it to make a fair crossing through the slush or the water.

A detailed description of each Chung used by the Saiyads will be found in Appendix 22, and it is only necessary to briefly draw attention to the main points, as they affect the livelihood of the Saiyad. The wild fowling areas are the swamps or inundated lands that lie intermediate between the cultivated lands of the delta and the terminal lake or Hamlin. The actual area thus inundated changes whenever the main stream shifts its course ; and the descrip tions given in Appendix 22 only hold good in detail for the present; each year brings small but important changes, and after every very big flood very large changes occur, but the main points that make a good place for wild fowl are likely to be always the same. The favorite fowl of the Seistani is the coot (Chor) and the favorite food of the coot is abrisham ;* abristham grows in deep pools which receive'' water free from silt or salts. The silt that deposits on the bed of some waters seems to kill this weed. The Helmund water is always sweet, but it is heavily laden with silt at flood time; this deposits on the lands where the flood waters must spread themselves out; the salts are washed out of salt lands by rain or river floods and carried into the pools near by. Such lands are those in the delta of the Farah Rud near Tappa-i-Kharan. In years of very big flood, like that of 1885, many favorite haunts of the wild fowl are destroyed by the large amount of silt washed into the pools, and doubtless many others form by the flood inundating new lands. Some of the pools are cut off by ridges and become isolated soon after the floods subside. As none are deep and since the high hot wind of summer is capable of evaporating 6 or 7 feet depth of water during the time that it blows, these pools become dry or are left very shallow; or being shallow, the water is brackish and therefore grow no weeds. The pool must be surrounded by a thick growth of reeds (nai) or bulrush (tut) in which the wild fowlers may hide. There is no lack of this growth in the Chung and Shela opposite the tail of the Rud-i-Parian, but there is a want of it in the Hamiin-i-Puzak; this Hamlin for years received much silt when the main river tailed into it, so that weeds do not now grow so luxuriantly, and in conse quence sport is not so good as it once was. For these reasons the best places for wild fowl are in the centre of the reed marshes out of the reach of the silt laden waters of the rivers, or the floods of water caused by the high north by west wind, but nevertheless connected to the main outflow of the river, so that the pools are replenished and remain sweet. Such retreats can usually only be reached by poling on a bulrush raft for miles along narrow lanes in the reeds. Now-a-days the best places are in the Chung around Chungri-Saruni, Chung-i- Gardan Reg, Chung-i-Shah Beg. Chung-i*Siaho. *The specimen sent was not sufficiently good for identification, but Mr. Drummond says it is probably a chara. -*Chap. XLIII.] 263 It is said that since 1895 when the Riid-i-Parian mouth developed, more water has gone to the inundated area to the south and east of the Kiih-i- Khwaja, and reeds and even bulrushes {tut) and rushes (tnzg) are springing up there. Good weeds are also growing and wild fowl are attracted each year in greater numbers to this part* Good fish are also obtained now in the Hamun-i- Sangal to the west of the Kiih-i-Khwaja. At present these Chung and Shela to the south of the Kuh-i-Khwaja have no names, because the Saiyads have not' yet frequented these parts sufficiently to require to name the waters.* If any water has to be pointed out, it is described by its situation with reference to the nearest village. The Hamun-i-Sabari does not afford good wild fowling grounds. The Hamun itself is too deep to grow weeds ; in the winter of 1904 the general depth was 9 or 10 feet, and in the flood of 1903 the depth must have been 12 or 13 feet. The high winds that lash the surface of the water into big waves prevent the weeds from growing even on the shallower margins ; the winds also drive the water to the south and all Chung and Shela into which these waters force their way are made useless for weed growing by deposits of silt brought by the water; the velocity of the water in some of these channels is very great. When the Farah Riid is in flood, it is said that dangerous under-currents ate set up in the Hamun-i-Sabari, and no Saiyad or cattle-owner will adventure to cross on his bulrush raft, though at other seasons they cross without fear whenever occasion may require. The Saiyads go about their fishing and wild fowling in parties of sfa ; these parties have areas told off to them, called Division of the fishing and fowling areas into pdg&amp;O —a word borrowed from agriculture. pasa °' The boundaries of these areas are usually some well known physical feature, but failing this they are marked by tying reeds together in a particular way, so that the mark once seen is readily recognised. It is said by some Saiyads that the whole of the inundated area has been allotted in such a way that as the waters subside each family knows where to go next to continue its avocations. But Kadkhuda Muhammadi says that the areas are allotted by him, and when redistribution becomes necessary he decides where each tribe should go, and his Mirza goes to see his orders carried out.

The huts are not to be distinguished from those of the graziers in appearance and surroundings except that the graziers have a large numbers of cattle near theirs. At some of the camps {khel) there are both graziers and Saiyad camps near to each other. There is a very large encampment of Saiyads on the shore to the east of the Kuh-i-Khwaja, known as the Khel-i-Zir-i-Kuh; these men also earn a living by ferrying pilgrims from the cultivated tract across to the Shrine on the Kuh- i-Khwaja which seems to be visited at all times of the year, but especially at Nauniz, The visitors pay the Saiyads about one kraris worth of grain for the hire of the tut in ; this includes the services of the ferryman to show the sights on the hill. The water birds in the allotted area of a party is reserved for that party, and the water birds in the whole of Spo,t in the NaM, reserved (or Saiyad,. ^ ^ ^ reserved fcr ^ the Saiyads.

Though individuals may at times arrange with the Saiyads themselves to shoot the waters belonging to them. The report of a gun is never heard in the Naizar, though the firing of guns goes on all day in the cultivated tract ; the Saiyads snare or net the birds and never use a gun ; probably no such weapon is to be found among them as a class. Five men of influence in the country are allowed to catch wild fowl, but not Privileges to catch birds granted to a few in- to sJlOOt ) in Certain areas of the Naizdrj flusntiai men. these are Aga Mulla Muhammad Mehdi, who has been allowed two p&amp;gdo in the Hamun-l-Garkandah, Chung-i-Daraz and Hamun-i-Hashim. He employs 9 Saiyads. Aga Imam Jumd has one pagao'm Deh Hauzdar and Mian Tali. Aga Saiyad Raza, Rukn-ul-Shoria of Kausha, has one pd^do in Kang-i- Haidar and Rud-i-Mamun and employs 4 Saiyads of Taifa-i-Ghor. Aga Haji Mir Said Ali of Aliabad has one and a quarter pdgdo near the Kuh-i-Khwaja. Sardar Purdil Khan, Sarbandi, employs 3 Saiyads in an area near Chash- maka. These men of position maintain the Saiyads whose pdgdo they have and pay all their taxes. The Saiyads as a class are an active and very industrious people and are Occupations by which a Saiyad earns his liv- busy the year round at some suitable in g- pursuit by which to earn a living. From about the middle of February to the middle of May they fish. From the middle of May to the middle of July they go to work as labourers at crop cutting and as gleaners in the field. From the middle of July to the middle of November they weave cotton and make mats of reeds (Jiasir baft). From the middle of November to the middle of February they snare or net wild fowl. In 1902 the Hamun practically dried up and the fish died, so that during the Fish . n time this Mission was in Seistan fish have not been seen in large numbers, but the Saiyads say that the result of a night’s fishing would be about iq fish to each man of the pdgdo, whereas from Nauruz 1903 to Nauniz 1904, they add that in spite of the big flood that year, each Saiyad only obtained 20 fish as his share of the fishing which brought in 4 man Seistani of grain. In a good year each Saiyad will obtain in return for his fish about 50 man Seistani of wheat. People, usually middle men, come from the city and from the big villages and buy the fish in exchange for grain, the barter being made weight for weight as a rule ; when fish are scarce the barter may yield more ; when they are plenti ful the Saiyads often have to hawk the fish round themselves. In winter they say the fish will remain fit to eat for three days, but in the warmer days only one day. The Saiyad prefers to sell his catches and says that he can only afford to eat the stale fish he has not been able to sell. A very large number of the villages go forth and catch fish themselves when the water becomes warm at the end of March ; a large number of the men or boys of the party can be seen plunging about in the shallow w r ater driving the fish into a long net held by the others of the party. The catches are carried off in donkey loads. The Saiyads say that these operations are, by a tacit understanding between themselves and the villagers, only carried on near the places where the canals empty themselves into the inundated area. Fishing places are made at any favourable spot on the rivers and many villagers find amusement and oc cupation in fishing, so that this source of income .must suffer from competition. A brief note by Major H. F. Walters, on the fish and on the peculiar net used to fish the rivers will be found at the end of the “glossary;” Appendix 42. [C639FD] ' BBBB266 [Chap. XLIII. The people fishing at the Band-i-Seistan and along the Rud-i-Seistan may be divided into those who fish for their own food, chiefly old men, or Baluchis from the khel near by, and those who fish to sell ; these are usually Farsiwans from the neighbouring big villages. They say that they sell the fish for an equal weight of wheat grain; at times when the fish* are scarce and grain plentiful they may even get double the weight of the fish in grain. The fish of the Naizarare caught, at night for preference, with a net {dam -i-mdhi), though a spear {naizar) is sometimes used. Each Saiyad possesses a net of his own which lasts about one year and costs about 3 krdn inclusive of the fine line (raisman-i-gihab) used to close it. Saiyads’ widows are sometimes able to let out their deceased husbands’ nets, the rent of the net being one-half the share of one man in the catch, the catch being divided into yi shares. The widow does not go out with the party, nor does she provide ropes with the net. The net is formed like a sack, triangular in shape, 9 feet wide at the base and 7^ feet from base to apex. The mesh of the net is one inch by one inch. Kinds of fish. The Saiyad recognises four classes of fish— Anjak, a fish wdth a small mouth. Mau, a fish with a large mouth. Mdhi, the common fish. Bur, this is a large fish that lives in the deeper waters of the Hamun which is said to weigh as much as 2 or 2^ Seistani man (12 to 15 lbs.). The favorite resort of the wild fowl have already been described ; it is beyond the scope of these notes to give any description^ of the wild fowl them selves, but it is important to know that the favorite bird with the Seistani is the coot, and of these there are large numbers on all waters where the abriskam weed grows. The Saiyad says that the coot collects together by day and is then easily netted; at night the coot separate and the Saiyad therefore does not pursue them at night. The wild duck are netted or snared on dark nights. The net used for wild fowl is usually 27 feet long and 16 feet wide with meshes about i| 'X li' in size. Such a net costs about 7 krdn, while the ropes to draw it in and cause it to close on the birds cost another krdn. The winter of the year 1903-04 was not a good one for wild fowl. The growth of weeds had not recovered from the drought of the previous year, and the great expanse of water over which the few birds, w 7 ho were attracted to Seistan were spread, made them very difficult to obtain. Each Saiyad’s share of the proceeds of the sale of birds only brought in about 50 man Seistani of wheat. In a good year they say that 100 man Seistani of wheat are obtained in exchange for the birds caught. Each Saiyad’s share of the catch will be from 200 to 300 birds. The Saiyads sell the birds for about 3 for a krdn to middlemen who carry them to the city or to large villages and sell them at about 2 for a krdn. It is the duty of the kadkhuda kurd to collect the share of the catch that belongs to the Contractor and to send it to him by hand of one of the men under him. The man gets no payment, but he expects his food when he delivers the catch. In addition to the birds that are sold, other birds are plucked and eaten from , , which each Saiyad may expect to get one Income from feathers. o-.'-ri , , A? . , . man beistani 01 down and 2f man Seistani of feathers. * The surplus fish are tried down into fish oil which is much appreciated as a nourishing food when eaten with bread- This is sold to Kafilas that come from Kain at a a Seistdni s?V. The outturn of this oil is said to be t 1 q of the weight of the fish. t See the list ofBirds of Seistan ” by Mr. J. W. Nicol Gumming, published in Volume XVI, No. 4 of the Bombay Natural History Society’s Journal.Chap. XLIIL] 267 Down fetches about 10 to 12 krdn the man and feathers about 2 to 6 krdn a man. The annual income for a Saiyad from this source is about 15 krdn. The hot weather that comes at harvest puts a period to fishing, and the income from work i„ the harvest fields. Saiyads then go from village to village in search of work as harvest labourers during the time crops are cut and fields are gleaned. To carry their goods and chat tels they keep a few donkeys which are at other times to be seen at graze on the Bununistan of the Hamun. At the spring harvest of 1903 the Zir Kiih Saiyads (near the Kuh-i-Khwaja) first cut the crops of Daulatabad and Sfhkuha as they were early sown and ripened early to the sickle; thence they went to Deh Ali Akbar. One man earned working alone about 30 man Seistani of wheat and 10 wrm of barley. A man with a child of 12 and another of 8 earned 60 man Seistani of wheat and 20 man Seistani of barley. These figures represent the quantities that they took away after deducting what they ate during the harvest. In this year the rates for crop cutting were lowered from 5 to 4 per cent, for wheat and from 6 to 5 per cent, on barley, because the famine had made labour plentiful and grain valuable and the abund ant harvest made the work easy. No pahlawi (green corn to parch) was allowed to them. Each family of Saiyads expects to bring home at the end of harvest 40 man Seistani of wheat and 20 man Seistani of barley over and above what they eat during the time they labour in the fields. The Saiyad is apparently not able to get any employment in the fields in the autumn crop and has to purchase the melons he requires. For he does not appear to grow any. He talks of grapes as an untasted joy. When the Saiyads return from the harvest fields the Seistani hot weather Work of weaving and mat-making. '; ith ‘P hi g h W ' nds haS '° ^ passed through with profit to themselves ; those who are not required to work ferries on the Hamiin employ themselves as mat- makers, or they weave cotton cloth. Sheltered by wind breaks made of reed they ply their looms and get through a large amount of profitable work. Most people in Seistan spin and weave and sufficient cotton is grown chiefly in the Miankangf to keep them going. Though at times it is necessary to import more cotton from Farah and Kain. The Saiyads buy the raw cotton and work it up into karbds, the common country cloth. A Saiyad of average industry during the four months he usually works as a weaver will make 200 yards of such cloth from which he will receive the value of 50 yards as the price of his labour. The Saiyad obtains advances from the Contractor, Kadkhuda Muhammadi, or borrows from friends. There are no merchants who finance him while he works as a weaver. The rate now-a-days for country cloth is about 2 yards for a krdn for the commoner quality and yards for' the better quality. The yard is the dehati gas of two Id, each Id containing 4 ballsht (spans). A span being 8f inches, so that a yard is 5' 9 // long though it would appear that the * For a full description of the cloth measure, see weaver’s trade sometimes vary the number the paragraph in the next Chapter on the weaver’s of balisht ill 3. Id * instead of varying the yar ’ price per Id of the cloth. Previous to 1902 the rate was 3 or yards a krdn. A Saiyad will earn about 20 krdn a year from this employment. Mats (asil or hasir) made of reeds are used to make the huts in which Mat-making. man y . other residents of Seistan, besides the Saiyads themselves, live ; the same class of mats are used to spread on the floors of homes, or on those of the masjid. Tim Saiyad may occupy himself in the hot weather either on weaving or mat-making, or indifferently on both. The reed by this time is at the right stage268 [Chap. XLIII. of its growth to be made into mats ; the Saiyad goes forth and collects 11 speci als ” one by one till he has sufficient for a load, when he returns home. The leaves are removed by beating the reed whilst rotating it with the hand ; for this purpose a mallet made of tamarisk is used. The leaves removed the reed is then beaten out flat and is then plaited into mats. One day will be employed collecting reeds, the next day in trimming and preparing them and the third day in weaving the mat. The outturn will be at the rate of two mats, measuring 20 by 8 pao* and these will sell for a krdn, thus mats are sold at about oneper loo square feet, but as with all commodities the price varies, and formerly 4 such mats would only fetch a krdn. The mats thus made are named from the purpose to which they are put. Those for the hut are— Asil'i'Sar or asil-i-sar-i khanai, the mat for the roof of the hut ; such mats are about 20 pao long and 8 pao wide. Asil-i-pushta, vc\3it that forms the back of the hut, 15 pao long and 8 pao wide. A hut is built up of ribs of tamarisk bent to a half hoof shape covered with 3 asil'i-sar-i-khanai and one asilA-pushta. Such a hut is rapidly put up and as quickly taken down and is very light to carry about. The mats are not plastered over, as they will keep out wet and wind unsupported in this way. But a wall of reeds or bulrushes is built as a wind break to the north by west of the hut. The mats made for spreading on the floor are called zirpai or tahpai (5 X 4 pao) ; these are sold at 8 for a krdn. The average earnings of a Saiyad during the year at mat-making are said to be 40 krdn, but doubtless, if all Saiyads worked at this occupation to the exclusion of weaving cotton, the market would be spoilt. A Saiyad would work partly at mat-making and partly at weaving and earn about 30a year on the average for the time that he-spent on this work, between the end of harvest and the time the wild fowl arrive. The work of poling tut in across the Hamun goes on all the year round ... .. , in those years when the floods have been surncientto flood the main roads across the Hamiin. Those Saiyads who are detailed off for this work do not go out to fish or net fowl or cut the harvest, but their annual earnings are much the same as those who follow the regular routine of employment and the tax is the same on all.. The principal road which is kept open by tut in during floods is that con necting Seistan with Persia which crosses the Hamiin to the north of the Kiih- i-Khwaja between Afzalabad and Bahring or Kala-i-Alam Khan or Mil-i-Nadfri, all names of places on the western shore of the Harmin near to which the tutin start. There are various routes that are followed which are described in the para graphs on the ferries and roads across the Hamiin in Chapter XLVII. At certain times of the year there is some traffic across the Hamun from the neighbourhood of Adimi towards the Ziarat-i-Sabari Shah near where the boundary cuts the western shore. There are also routes to the north which occasionally require ; these too are described in Chapter XLVII. When the Kuh-i-Khwaja is surrounded by water, as it was in 1903 and 1904, a very profitable business is done in the spring in taking visitors to see the Zidrat on the Kuh as already referred to on page 264. In years of low Hamun the income from ferries entirely ceases, and the Saiyads must subsist on their catches of wild fowl and fish. The usual charge now made, as has already been said on page 260, is from Fees chared 2 to 4 for a tutin across the Hamun from Afzalabad to Bahring without refer ence to the load carried. * Pao is the human foot, about 9' or 10'. f In literate Persian hasir.269 Chap. XLIIL] The tutin is a raft for crossing the waters of the H£mun and is made of bulrushes {tut) and sometimes of a rush (^tuzg, Scirpus Wardianus), it is never made of reeds, though it is always described in books on Seistan as a reed raft. This raft with the pole for propelling it is an indispensable piece of property to all Saiyads. The material to make the raft is obtained from the Naizdr near the de- bouchement of the main stream at Chung-i-Baringak and Burj-i-Raisa. The bulrush only flourishes if it receives water every year, and it soon dies out if the land on which it grows is liable to be left dry. There is no tut near the Kuh- i-Khwaja. Up to 1904 there was a large bed at the tail of the Shela-i-Jharuki in Afghan Seistan, but this belt of very fine tut has become dry and is likely to disappear for the reasons given on the first page of Chapter XXXIII. The village of Tuti near the Kiih-i-Khwaja is built at the place where the best tut grew when the main river debouched at the Kuh-i-Khwaja some 60 years ago. The Saiyads cut the tut from June to October and store it for use during the ensuing year, as tut cut green is said to last longer than tut allowed to ripen ; more over, the Naizar in which the tut grows is burnt each year by the cattle-owners. Since the floods come early in the spring, if the tut were not stored, there would be no tutin available when required most. In 1902 the Hamun dried up, but the floods in 1903 covered the roads across the Hamun before the tut had time to sprout even ; yet the Saiyads produced ample tut for tutin as soon as they were required ; a large number were used by the Mission early in May. Tutin are made of various sizes from small light tutin for one man to move . easily through the reeds in pursuit of wild Method or making a r i . , , • ,1 ^ -n i fowl to a tutin that will carry a camel. But all are made on the same principle. The making of a tutin has been illus trated by photographs and sketches and will now be described. The photographs are of a tutin being made by a Saiyad who works a ferry on the river. Such tutin are not so tightly packed or so skilfully shaped as those made by the Saiyad on the Hamun. When the tut has been collected the co-operation of at least three men are needed to press the tut into shape and bind it tight. The tut is made up into three cigar-shaped bundles—two of exactly the same size and one somewhat larger than this pair. The heads of the tut are kept at one end of the bundle and the roots at the other. These heads eventually become the prow of the tutin and the roots the stern. The cigar-shaped bundles are bound with ropes made of tut or of tuzg. Though tutin made for use on the rivers where kirta grass can be got are bound with ropes {chilak) of kirta grass. When these bundles are ready the large bundle is placed in the middle and the smaller bundles on either side. These are then bound tightly together. This is done by a man jumping on them, placed one above the other, while the two other men pull on the ropes. The lashings are made at about one foot inter vals. When the bundles have been securely lashed together, that part of the bundles composed of the tops of the bulrushes are gathered together and bound up into a neat prow {sar). If the tutin is built on the river bank, a deck made of a mat of tamarisk twigs is added and the tutin is ready to be launched ; but on the shore of the Naizar there is no tamarisk and the deck of the tutin is omitted, or some loose bulrushes are spread instead. A small tutin is called a tutin-i-shikar and a large one a tutin-i-bhar ; the latter will take two passengers and their goods across the Hamun ; say a load of about 10 Indian maunds. The passengers sit in the middle of the tutin with their baggage behind them. Sheep are tied by the legs and laid on the tutin, A tutin to carry a camel or a horse is a special and is larger still. Horses can seldom be got to stand on a tutin and go across the Hamun. Though the Mission found no difficulty in getting them to do so when crossing rivers in the * Vide Ur. Drummond’s paper on the JcjV/ims published in Volume 73, Fart 2, No. 4 of the Journal of the Asiatic Society, Bengal. [C639FD] ccccayo [Chap. XLII. depth of the cold winter. In summer weather and when the inundation waters are not very deep horses and camels are led behind the t utin. But in winter the water is too cold and the animal may die. Mr. Merk relates how in January 1886 he saw a horse die after crossing the high Hamun after the great flood 015. The smaller tut in can be made from two men s burdens {kaldJi) ox half a camel load of tut. The larger tutin requires two and-a-half camel loads of tut. One man can cut i-| camel-loads of green tut in a day and 2 camel-loads of ripe tut. Three men will make two shikari tutm in a day, provided the material is collected at the spot where the tutin is to be made. It takes 6 or 8 men to make the larger tutm. Tutin are made by m&amp;ldar as well as by Saiyads, but the Saiyad s tutm are much superior in finish; the tut is more carefully and thoroughly compressed and the shape of the raft is more skilful, so that it sits well on the water and is much easier to pole. The Saiydd stands at a place prepared for his feet at the stern and propels the tutin with a long pole of tamarisk or Pada or Padag (often called sahx baby Ionic a, but more correctly populus Euphratica) at a rate of about 2 miles an hour in still water. Tutin travel well before the wind or down stream, but can with difficulty be taken against wind or current. The poles are obtained from the thickets near Kala-i-Fath or in the Midnkangi. The Padag pole is preferred, because “it does not stick to the bottom ” {sic) ) probably because it is lighter than tamarisk which is a wood that won’t float on water. The poles are about 10 or 12 feet long and cost I to 2 krdn and last several years with care. The Saiyads say that one of their tutin will last two or three months, but the more roughly put together tutin that are found at ferries on the river become water-logged in 10 or 15 days. Apart from the difference of make, a tutin doubtless will float longer when propelled only in still water than a tutin which is propelled against the force of the stream and which is frequently over loaded. If a tutin is kept hard at work at a ferry all day, it will only last^ a few days. The Mission has often experienced great difficulty from the rapid way tutin become water-logged, especially when the tut was not cut till it was fully ripe and dry. A Saiyad usually makes two tutin a year and he values his tutin at to krdn. Income and expenditure of the Saiy&amp;d. The income and expenditure of a Saiyad may now be compared. Income.

The growing of cotton has been described in the agricultural notes and General remarks. it has been explained that all the cotton grown is consumed in the country in weav ing, and in some years more is imported to this end. Every woman, who is not a Baluch, spins cotton yarn, and a large number of the men, even among those w r ho are not weavers by trade, employ some of their leisure weaving the yarn into cloth. The Baluch and Afghan men never weave. Only a few of the Baluch women spin cotton yarn, and then only occasionally; they, however, make the carpets* and rugs which are obtained in large numbers and very cheap in Seistan. The men spin the wool into thread, but these notes will only deal with the spinning of cotton and the weaving of cloth therefrom. That all the women spin is only what one finds or used to find in agricul tural communities all the world over, but Seistan seems to be unusual in the number of men of Persian extraction who weave. Besides those who weave in their leisure, there are a large number of Persian weavers, juldh of the Shiah sect who live by weaving alone. It is said that every Fdrsiwdn Taifd in Seistan is represented among the weavers. Weavers and cultivators intermarry, but a cultivator is held in more honour than a weaver. But cultivators do not marry with blacksmith and carpenter families. When grain is plentiful and cheap many men are well satisfied to subsist by weaving alone, but when years of scarcity come and wheat becomes dear, most weavers endeavour to get a share in the cultivation of a “ plough M of land. There are no taxes {ghani) on weavers. «r, . , The count of people shews that there 1 he number of weaver families and souls. .. f 1 1 . r r ... are- the following number of families of weavers in the country :— In the Rdd-Seistan tract In the Miankangi Total Persian Seistan ' Families. 1,158 748 1,906 In Afghan Seistan— In Tababah Khwabgah (9), Nad-i-Ali (113), Kala-i-Kang (132), Ibrahimabad (140), Sikhsar (92) ... ... ... 486 Total number of families in both countries ... 2,393 There are probably six souls in a family of weavers, on the average making the total number of souls who subsist on weaving alone ... ... ... ... 14,352 Spinning has provided work for a specialist, called a duktarash, who turns the spindles needed to wind the spun yarn on to bobbins ; there are 41 families in the Riid-i-Seistan tract, six in the Miankangf, and none in Afghan Seistdn. There are therefore 47 families of 5 or 6 souls each on the average, or 250 souls supported by this allied industry. The dyers may be considered an allied industry ; there are 73 families of dyers in the Riid-i-Seistan tract and 26 in the Miankangf and 12 in Afghan Seistan, a total of 99 families in Persian and 12 in Afghan Seistan, or a total of 111 families of about 600 souls.

But since about ten years bajgiri has been charged. Further, within the last three years, import duties have also been charged on cotton entering Seistan from outside Persia ; the rate is said to be i krdn per donkey Joad of about 10 man Seistani. Although the cotton of Farah and Bakwa is considered finer than that grown locally, yet the high duties have now stopped its import. But cotton is still brought by kafila from Kain who come to Seistan to buy grain. The raw cotton from-~ Kain is called Narma. Farah „ Josak.

From a similar weight of Seistani picked cotton only 8 sir of husked cotton is obtained. 3Chap. XLIV.] 2 75 The husk [puzt-i-kdlak) is usually about 10 sir to the man Seistani, and the seed (panba dana or pandivana) 22 sir. The husk is removed from the fibre by hand ; the fibre parts freely from the husk. To husk cotton is called kdlak wa kardan among Seistanis. If ladies of high degree hire women to husk cotton for them, they pay 10 sir of wheat for each man of cotton husked. This work and all that follows up to that of preparing the yarn for the warp {tana in Seistan tdr in Persian) is done by women. 1 he ginning is done by passing the husked cotton between two wooden Ginning cotton. rollers ; the seed remains behind and the fibre freed of seed passes on. The machine used is very small and simple and very similar to the belna used for a similar purpose in the Punjab. This little machine is called charak or charkh and is made by the village carpenter for 1 kran \ the rollers {tir) are made of tamarisk and the supports of willow {hid),' poplar willow {padd' or padag) or tamarisk. Iron is never used in the construction of the roller as in the Punjab. . If the machine is obtained on hire, the seed extracted is paid as hire. The woman who spins always gins her own cotton ; ladies of high degree, wTo may wish to show a large outturn of spun yarn at small exertion to them selves, may hire labour to gin at 5 sir of wheat per man of cotton ginned. When the seeds have been removed the cotton fibre is placed upon a tamarisk Cleaning and preparing the fibre for spinning. basket having jtS face turned tO . # the ground ; the fibre is struck with a thin rod of tamarisk cahed shush in Seistan and pushik in Baluchi j the dust and dirt fall through the interstices of the basket work to the ground. This work is called pamba zadan. This beating also fluffs out the fibre ; after the dirt has been removed in this way the floor is sanded and the sand made damp with watei and the fibre is laid out on this and whisked with two sticks—one in each hand. The whisking is so managed that the fibre becomes made up into a long and narrow shaped pad* about 4' wide and 1' thick. This work of beating up or fluffing out the cotton fibre is called daraza shudan. The fiore is then made up into a neat bundle by folding the pad in a parti cular way ; this bundle is called banduk and the work banduk kardan. For convenience of handling the fibre for spinning, small pieces are broken off this banduk about 4 // Jong, ^ Each of these smaller pieces is callad kanduk. They are placed over a little bit of stick as big as a large match called nustak pick and rolled over it on the palm of the hand, the bit of stick is removed and the nustak remains. From the centre of this little roll the fibres will draw when attached to the end of the spindle of the spinning wheel. Extract from the Encyclopaedia Brittanica.

't 276 the meanings of the words used and the object of the various processes Yarn consists of any textile fibre prepared by the process of spinning for being woven into cloth. It is only in a few minor and exceptional cases, such as the weaving 0 hair- c°o?h or of wire, that there is any making of woven fabr.cs without the previous spinning 0 yarn As weaving can be shown to be among the earliest and most universal of the industries of mankind, the process of spinning yarn which of necessity accompanies or rather precedes weaving, can be claimed as one o the primal employments of he race. There is ample evident obtainable, not only of the great antiquity, but also of the wide -almost universal-diffusion of the art of spinning. Remains 0 the implements employed are found wherever traces of prehistoric and early man make their appearance. The primitive spinning implement consists of a spindle, a rod of wood, usually from 9 to 12 inches in length, rounded and tapering towards both extremities. At the upper ex tremity there is usually a notch, in which the yarn is caught while undergoing the operation of twisting, and to the spindle there is commonly added a whorl, a perforated disk o stone r other heavy material-the object of which is by itsweight to give momentum and steadiness to the spindle when it is rotated by the hands of the spinner. Thefibre to be spun ,s common ly attached loosely to a distaff or “ rock ' of wood, which is held under the left arm of the operator; but in the case of certain short fibres the material is made up m ™ or oardings. A rotatory motion is given to the spindle by twirling it between the fingers of the right hand , and the fibre to be spun is then drawn out in a uniform strand between the fingers of both hands and simultaneously twisted into yarn by the rotating spindle to which it is attached. The portion that is sufficiently twisted is wound on the body of the spindle, and the operation is continued till the spindle is fil.ed with yarn of smooth and canal calibre. The quantity thus rolled up gives the name to a now definite measure of yarn &lt;l the spindle Simple and primitive as is this apparatus a dexterous and experien ced spinner is able to produce yarn of an evenness, strength, and delicacy such as can scarcely be exceeded with the aid of the most complicated appliances and by the numerous processes of perfected modern spinning. The first improvement on the simple spindle consisted in mounting it horizontally in bearings and giving it a rotatory motion by a band from a large wheel passing round a small pulley or “ wharve” fixed on the spindle itself. Such was the first spinning wheel which, in the form of the charka has long been known in the East Indies, Weaving is the art of forming cloth by the interlacing of yarn or other filaments in a loom In weaving U\o kinds or sets of yarn are used, the warp and the weft. The warp consists of the threads of yarn which extend generally but not always m parallel lines from end to end the whole length of the web; the weft yarn crosses and intersects the warp at right angles, and fills up the breadth of the web. The warp is mounted on the loom for weaving? and into it the weft is thrown by means of a shuttle. Weaving is thus distinct from knitting netting, looping and plaiting, by all of which methods cloth may be made from yarns. Cloth also is prepared by felting, but in that operation the fibres are simply matted together without either spinning or intertwisting. Plain cloth such as an ordinary piece of calico or linen, will, on examination, be found to consist of two sets of threads, the one intersecting the other at right angles, with each single thread passing alternately over one and under the next. Such a web is pro duced by passino- the weft thread over and under each alternate warp thread in the breadth of the loom, the warp threads under one shot of weft being above the next. To do this, and to beat or close up each successive weft thread so as to make an even and sufficiently close cloth, necessitates a series of operations of which the following is an outline. For a detailed description of the series of operation the original articles should be referred to. It will be sufficient for the purpose of these notes to say that they are warping or the preparation of the warp and plain weaving or the manufacture of the cloth. Spinning in Seistdn. Thefibre is now ready for spinning {charrisa). The spinning wheel (char) and method of spinning is much the same as that used in India. The spindle is called duk and is made of tamarisk in two sizes, a smaller size for use in spinning and a larger size for use in winding the thread into bobbins at a later stage. The duk is never made of iron. The thread that collects on the end of the spindle is called a dastak, about 24 such are prepared from one sir Seistani of fibre. A woman working industriously can spin from one sir Seistani to one sir and a half Seistani of yarn in a day according to the fineness of the yarn.Chap. XLIV.] S7 j . ^ woman comes to help she is known as an arzukct, and is recompensed with her morning and evening meal; such are employed perhaps only to help poorer friends, as it is a point of honour among most women to do their own s P, innin g- ^ woman too lazy to do this may hire labour by paying 10 sir of wheat for spinning one sir of thread. The yarn is afterwards wound from the bobbin* * into hanks) for this purpose Making tha hank or skein, ^ evolving frame IS USfid, Called a chciykh(t dastakgih ; it is a simple contrivance of bent sticks round a central shaft and is made by the woman’s husband. The woman revolves the frame with one hand, while the yarn is passed to the frame with the other. The hank thus formed is called kalawa. The labour^of making the hank is valued at one sir of wheat for each sir of cotton made into a hank or skein, but such work is seldom or never done bv hired labour. 7 The purpose of making skeins is to get at the yarn and wash and prepare it. Washing the skeins. s ^ e ^ n thoroughly soaked in water. . r 7 i « 7 n r' '' “ en rem oved from the water the moisture is wrung out {shakanja kardan) of them by twisting them up. This twisting is effected by putting a little bit of stick at each end ; when twisted as tight as possible the sticks are caught on to the skein to prevent it unwinding. Thus twisted up, the skeins are laid aside for a day; on the second day they are put into a pot {deg) of boiling water into which wheat has been thrown in the proportion of 2 sir of wheat to 20 sir of cotton. The water in the pot into which the skeins are put is kept boiling till the wheat becomes quite soft. The weavers say that the purpose of the wheat is to prevent the thread from being burnt by sticking to the pot, but the probable use of it is to obtain the gluten as a sizing, for they say that this boiling softens and strengthens the thread. In order to prepare the warp the yarn must be got on to bobbins. These Preparation of the bobbins for the making of the bobbins are made of pieces of reed about •. r , 7 . ^ diameter and 4 or 5 inches long and are called muskla kalan. When the skeins are nearly dry they are placed on a drum or frame called a chctrkha kalawa that revolves about a central spindle, and this is set ud on the ground before the spinning wheel. ^ . The bobb ’ in of ree d is fitted to the end of the spindle {dU) of the larger size used for this purpose, and the thread is reeled off the skein on to the bobbin by turning the spinning wheel. Two skeins are wound on to one bobbin, and the labour of winding this bobbin, which holds about 2 sir Seistani of thread, is valued at 1 sir of &amp; wheat grain. But such work is never hired out to be done, so this value only represents a weaver’s estimate. 3 t When the yarn is wound on to the bobbin, the work of the woman ends in Preparation of the warp. Seistan, and the warp is laid out by the ..... , , m en of the house ; but in Northern India the warp also is laid out by the women; the men of the house do not work at all on the yarn ; the women prepare it for the weaver. To lay out the warp a piece of level clean sheltered land near the village is sought for. Here all the men who have this work to do collect and start work by laying out the sticks along which the threads are arranged to make the warp (tad in Seistan tar in Persian). * . - - ■■ ■■ * I call this a bobbin, but it is not mounted on a bobbin ; it is only a roll.

XLIV. rep o Sizing and preparing the warp for the loom. When the warp has been prepared by the owner of the thread as described on page 293 he makes it over to the weaver, who then proceeds to coat it with size. For this purpose it is again taken out to the open sheltered ground near the village, where the w r arp was made, and it is stretched across wooden trestles called khar khatti. The knots (dam) are again replaced ^by sticks (pushak) and the warp is spread out, so that each thread lies along side the other in the same way that it will in the finished cloth. The weaver then prepares a paste made of drd (wheat^ meal) and water in the proportion of 5 sir Seistani of meal to one man Seistani of cloth. To each sir of meal one man of water is mixed. The owner gives the weaver 10 sir oi meal for each man of cloth, and the difference is a perquisite of the weaver.^ 1 he paste is poured over the warp by means of a gourd with a small hole in the bottom. The gourd has a handle of string and the weaver grasps it in such away that he can regulate the flow of the paste over the cloth with a finger. When the warp is thus all pasted over, the surface is worked on with a brush called mala. The mala is made from the roots of a grass called mazh that is only found in Seistan on the Khash Rud. The cost of the brush is about 6 krdn and the brush lasts 10 years. If the weaver buys the grass and makes the brush himself, it costs 2 krdn. The warp is turned over, so that the sizing is laid on from both sides. The work of putting on size is called shir a kardan. The sticks are then removed and replaced again by the knots called dam. The warp is then rolled up and is ready to be fitted into the loom. The above work occupies the weaver about one day. The loom* seems to be very similar to that in use in India. It is a complex machine and could not be usefully described without pictures. The loom. The yarn for the weft must be wound on to a bobbin called mushla kurd ; this is done by the women who spin; if this work is left for the weaver to do, he is paid one yard of cloth in 40 for the labour. The yarn on this bobbin is treated to a. preparation made of egg. The weft is called bafa and the warp tdr or locally tad ; the yarn used for the weft is coarser than that used for the warp. The shuttle [maku) is made at Kain and costs I krdn and will last 10 years. It is strengthened with a piece of iron let into the wood, about the only piece of iron used in the weaving of cotton cloth ; unless we take into account ,, , the bits of miscellaneous ironf the weaver ’ * collects and strings on to his loom to act as a rattle, and make a noise to keep him company, as he sits hour after hour weaving. The looms are set up outside the village at some sheltered spot; a fence of tamarisk poles supporting mats of the same material further protects the weavers and their looms from the prevailing winds ; a pit is made in the ground to receive the feet to work the treadles, and a small staging of tamarisk is built over head from which to support the loom. These places to work the looms are usually arranged in a neat line, and are a prominent feature of every Seistani village. At some villages places for as many as thirty or forty looms can be counted. Each weaver’s place is called J The old Arbab called it Engin-i-Seistdn. En* a kdTgah J the looms Seems tO be Called gin (sic) he added was a Persian word (!!) much kalokala-i-kargahX while the gear which used in Kabul where there is/Ta^Mana. ,, ° . ,, ,, . the weaver requires to prepare the thread for the loom is called kalokala-ifuldh. A weaver will work at his loom for 8 or 9 hours a day and will make from 5 to 10 yards of cloth ; the smaller outturn will be on the wider varieties of cloth. Boys begin to weave from 10 years old and upwards. * Specimens of the loom and all other tools used in spinning and weaving have been made over to the Director-General of Archaeology at Simla.28 i Chap. XLIV.] Some of the principal parts of the loom are named as follows • Maku, the shuttle ; this will last 10 years and'costs a kran. Mushla kurdj the bobbin in the shuttle ; these are made from reeds of suit* able thickness which are sometimes grown in gardens or on canal banks so as to avoid the long journey to the Naizar to collect them. They are valued at 5 sw* Seistani of wheatfor 50. Barf or pui is the weft. Tad more correctly tar is the warp. Jdma or parcha is the cloth as made. Paruk ) is the roller or cloth beam on which the cloth is wound, as it is made ; the beam costs a krdn and will last 20 years ; there are holes at the right hand end into which a turn spoke is fitted when it is necessary to revolve the roller and take up cloth. The turn spoke is called chubd-paruk gardu or chub-i- dimaghak. The supports of the roller against which it revolves are called mikh-i-paruk, Tandb is the rope which lets out the warp, as the cloth is wound on to the cloth beam ; the peg at the weaver’s right hand to which the end of this rope is attached is called mikh-i-dast kash, while the stake at the far end of the warp around which the rope goes before returning to the weaver is called mikh-i-kun-i-kar* This rope is valued at 2 krdn, Tigh is the weaver’s reed, or comb made of splits of reeds ; each split sepa rates a thread of the warp ; they are held in a heavy frame of wood, the whole combination forming the weaver’s reed or tigh. Its use is to press home the weft after each throw of the shuttle. Shdkha —The comb gets its rich brown colour from lubrication which is given it from a Shdkha (horn) containing ghi (clarified butter). Dasta-i-shana sar-i-nal. Dasta-i-shana tahi nal. —These are the upper and lower parts “ lay ” or “ batten ” of the frame which hold the tigh or weaver’s reed. Shana is the ordinary Persian word for comb. This frame is neatly made and finished and the handling it receives at each cast of the shuttle gives it a high polish. It is made of unndb (jujube tree), apricot, or pomegranate wood by any village carpenter at a cost of 5 krdn and it will last 50 years. Gola are the nets made to raise and lower the threads of the warp, so that the shuttle may pass between them. These are, I believe, technically called &lt;( eyes,” “loops” or “ mails ” of the “ heddle ” or “ heald ”(— vide Encyclopaedia Britan- nica, Volume 24, Art. Weaving). Half a sir of cotton is used to make them and six sets are needed in a year. Pusharak.—tThQse are the treadles by which the weaver with his feet actuates the gola (heddles). They are made of tamarisk and cost half a yard of cloth and last 10 years. Cloth is called jama by the Seistani and karbds or karbdsak (literate Price of cloth. Persian kirbds) by the Baluchi. It is sold to cattle-owners, officials and Baluchis, as those people do not, as a rule, weave their own cloth.

There are so many families in Seistan, such as the Saiyads and cultivators, who alsqf weave cotton cloth that the family which subsists on weaving alone has great difficulty in obtaining work enough for its subsistence. The estimate of income just given is said by experienced weavers and others to represent the average or usual earnings of a weaver. With 130 krdn a year about 800 Indian seers of wheat can be bought; this is not much to feed and clothe a family of 4 or 5 souls, and it shews, what is a well known fact in the country, that the weavers have a very narrow margin on which to live. There are so many weaver families and the autumn harvest is so small that none of them could hope to earn melons or millet at this harvest. Nor are they allowed to grow these foods for themselves, as the water of the canals is reserved for the cultiva tors who have “ ploughs ” of land. Nothing corresponding to our cottage garden is known in Seistan, no one cultivates except those directly concerned in tilling the soil. Estimate of the annual value of the labour expended on spinning and weaving cotton into cloth in Persian Seistdn. We may make a rough estimate of the value of the labour expended in spinning and weaving by assuming that all the raw cotton grown in Persian Seistan is spun and wove in the country. This will not be far wrong. No cotton fibre is exported from Seistan; formerly some fibre was imported, but of late years this import has become very small, probably because of the large expansion of cotton cultivation in the Miankangf. Cotton fibre is used for little else than spinning and weaving: quilts and pillows that in India often use up some cotton fibre are here stuffed with down or feathers from birds netted in the Naizar. * But for spinning Jama-i-dah a krdn for 6 yards is the rate.Chap. XLIV.] 283 It has alreacy been shewn that 11*6 Seistani man of raw cotton, valued at 23! krdn, makes 100 yards of cotton cloth, valued at 40 kran. The value of the labour expended in spinning and weaving is therefore 16^ krdn on every 11 6 Seistani man of raw cotton grown, or i ’45 kvdn a Seistani man. We may therefore assume that on each Seistani man of raw cotton krdn of labour is expended by the people to make it into cotton cloth. The value of the labour will vary with the prioe of wheat, and the rate above arrived at is deduced from the value of cotton doth when wheat was 1 Seistani man to the krdn* The normal net or divisible outturn of raw cotton in Persian Seistan is * There will be some other allowances to the 197,200 Seistani man \ 566 line 7 of cultivators which m , y be ig.orcd. ^ ^ Statement G. To this should be added the cost of picking which is paid in kind at 5 per cent.* So the gross outturn of raw cotton is 207,060! Seistani man, and the labour of working this up into cloth valued at krdn a Seistani man, will be 310,590, say 300,000 krdn per annum. t See Statement 0 . %CHAPTER XLV. CONTENTS. The Potter.

It unfortunately did not opcur to me to make a study of the local potters until just before leaving Seistan ; then there was only opportunity for Lala Thakur Dass, Supervisor, to pay one visit to the potter in the City, and the following account was written by him. It is accompanied by a photograph and drawings. The information may stimulate further enquiry and study in this interesting subject. There are 15* families of potters in Persian Seistdn living in the villages given in the foot-note. There are no potters in Afghan Seist&amp;fi. Goat skins are there used to carry water, and china or enamel ironware is used for other domestic purposes ; local made pottery is seldom used, but if a man is going to Seistan, he sometimes brings earthenware for himself and friends. The potter, from whom Lala Thakur Dass obtained his note, was one of four The potter families imported from Birjand, families w horn the Amir Alain R.han, Hash- ma t-ul-Mulk, brought from Birjand, because he found that there were not enough potters in Seistan to supply the wants of the community. All the potters employ the same method of making pottery, but the potters Village potters, in the Cit y are grater experts at the art . . than those who live in the villages ; the potters in the villages are only able to make unglazed or biscuit ” pottery whilst those in the City can also make glazed pottery locally called kashi. The present Hashmat-ul-Mulk continues the favour shewn by his father Pottery for the Governor. to these four families of Birjand potters j f , , ae obtains the pottery that he requires from them and pays for all he obtains. His mirza gives the potter a slip for all the articles required, and every three or four months the potter goes to the Amir with the slips and is paid. The Birjand potters are also exempt from the shop tax of 5 krdn per family Exempt from shop tax. per annum, which all other potters in Seis* tan in r&gt;nm cobblers, etc., pay.

But the more expert potters of the city put a sort of inferior glaze on the biscuit pottery {kachol) to attract buyers. This pottery is not called kashi but kachol, or sometimes sufdl a word of similar meaning to our word spurious, that is, not real glazed pottery! This class of P°ttery is used by the cultivators who prefer it to pottery without any glaze at all because it is more lasting, and is cleaner to use. Only the very poor purchase the pottery that has no glaze whatever on it. * The numbers of potters in Seistan— Husainabad ... Bunjar ... Mir Kadkhuda Saifuddin near Bahramabad Afzalabad M . ...

The labourer employed by the potter is called shagird t i.e., pupil; he is usually a son or nephe'w of the potter and The she gird. is learning the art. If outside labourers are employed, they are paid one krdn a day each. A glossary of the technical terms most commonly used by the potters will be found at the end of this Chapter. Glossary. Selection of earth and preparation of clay pottery. A description of the earth used, the method of making, loading and baking pottery will now be given; as well as a description of the glazes used. An estimate of the cost of the various operations, and an estimate of the probable income of a potter will be worked out. Earth which is free from shur or alkaline matters and has no gravel in it is used for making pottery. That earth which has great sticking property like good flour is the best for this purpose. (Gil bashad ki khub me chaspad misal- i'drd, wa shiradar ast) This sort of earth can be obtained inside as well as outside of the city of Nasratabad. The lumps of earth are first broken very fine and the stuff is then mixed with water. The fine particles of the earth dissolve in 24 hours. The earth about the city is very good in this respect. The earth near Sihkuha is even better than this, but it requires much more labour to prepare the clay. It is too stiff. The lumps are first broken ; then the earth is screened and mixed with water. When the earth and water become of the required consistency, it is continuously trodden by the feet till the clay becomes like dough used in making bread. The potter then mixes sand obtained from the sandhills made by the winds with the clay thus prepared. The clay is made into a flat layer like that of cloth and then folded up. Sand is then spread on the ground and the clay unfolded on it. It is then again trodden on till all the sand is absorbed into the clay. This process is continued till the potter sees that the clay has taken in the required quantity of sand. The earth about the city of Nasratabad does not absorb much sand. The proportion of earth to sand is 4 to 1 or 5 to 1. But the proportion of the earth of Sihkuha to sand is 3 to 1, as this earth is very much stiffer than that at the City. If the vessel to be made is required to keep water cool in the hot weather, the clay is made a little harder and finer by adding a little more sand to it. The vessel too is made as thin and delicate as possible with the material at the pot ter’s disposal. Upon the right admixture of sand and the thinness of the pottery depends the cooling power of the water jar or kuza. The method of -working the potter's wheel and making the earthenware.—* When the clay has been thus worked up it is ready for use; the potter then takes his seat at the wheel or charkh as it is called. One shagird or pupil brings clay from the pits and puts it on the platform in front of the potter. The pot ter puts a lump on the kdlib or upper disc and spins the wheel with a move ment of his right or left foot, resting the idle foot on the horizontal wooden bar fixed conveniently for the purpose. With his thumb and fist the potter makes a hollow inside that lump of clay and shapes it to the form of the vessel as required. During this process the exterior surface of the vessel is from time to time dressed with the mala, paring off any superfluous earth and making the surface smooth and uniform. When the vessel is finished, the potter cuts the bottom off smoothly from the kdhb by means of a fine strong thread ; then he gently puts it aside and starts to make another. The process of making vessels on the wheel is said to be very easy, but much practice is required to give the correct shape to the vessels. The kinds of vessels that are now-a-days made in Husainabad. Glazed pottery is not made for the reasons already explained. Only the following five kinds of vessels are now made :— (1) Kuza or water jar used throughout the country is made in two sizes, but the large size is more generally used. One is a load for a woman carried on herChap. XLV.] 287 head as in the Biblical pictures ; or one is hung on either side of a donkey who carries the man and the water jars to and from the canal. A potter can make 100 such kuzam one day with one man to bring clay. (2) Kdsa-i-khurd-o-kaldn.'-~Ld,rge and small cups. They are shaped like a frustum of a cone. A potter can make 300 large or 500 small kdsd in one day. (3) Taghdr or taghdrcha—YXzt dishes with low edges for kneading dough or eating bread. One potter can make 300 \zxgQ taghdr or 150 to 200 small taghdrcha. (4) Abkhord or tumbler—These are small vessels shaped like a tumbler about 5' high and 2* to 3' in diameter. A potter in one hour can make 40 to 50 such tumblers or 300 to 400 per day. ( 5 ) Bastak or a small vessel with a wide mouth used to keep milk or to make curds. A potter can make 200 to 300 of these vessels in one day. Drying of the vessels. The potter said that at the time of the year that the visit was made (early in May) the kdsa would take two nights and one day or 36 hours to dry. When the vessels are finished on the wheel, they are placed in the shade to dry. When they harden a little, they are again taken to the wheel, where the bottoms are dressed; and then again put in the shade to dry. The taghar and kasa may be placed in the morning sunshine; but kuza and bastak are never exposed to the sun; for they are delicate and are apt to crack if exposed to the sun. The kuza and bastak take a longer time to dry, about 24 to 36 hours more than kasa and taghdr. Randa. — For dressing the bottoms of vessels tools are used called randa. The vessel when it has hardened a little is placed on the top of the kdhb tardshy and while the wheel is in motion the potter chips off the superfluous earth from the bottom of the vessel with the randa and properly rounds off the shape. The vessels are again put in the air to dry. When all the vessels are completely dry they are then ready for being carried into the kiln. Baking of the f ottery in the kiln. The dash or kiln is very simple in constructional details. It has four chimneys at the four corners to draw out Size of the kiln to hold earthenware. ^ A ^ usual l y holds 200 small and 200 large kuzd or 300 small and 300 large ^ kasa at one time. Taghar and abkhord are also loaded in the same ratio, or the kiln can bake 500 large and 100 small kasa at one time. The chief demand of poor men is for kasa and taghdr. The best fuel obtainable for every description of kiln in Seistdn is khdr or the camel-thorn known in Northern Fuel for the irdn. India asThis bush is uprooted and brought by donkey men on donkeys. The donkey can make 3 trips after the spring, when khar grows in plenty all around the City ; but when the supply near the City is exhausted the donkeys can make only two trips a day. The pot ter pays onekrdn a day for a donkey, i.e t) one krdn for 2 to 3 donkey loads of fuel. If the donkeys are of full size and strong, then twelve loads of khar will suffice to burn one kiln. Thus the cost of Cost of fuel. - s f rorn ^ to 6 krdn.288 [Chap. XLV. When the kasa or taghdr are being arranged in the kiln, it is neces- .

These szhpaya are also of various dimensions to suit the varied sizes of the vessels. The pur pose of this article is to prevent vessels joining together when being heated in the kiln. Kuza are arranged very carefully ; spaces are left between each and small things, such as abkhord are burnt with the kuza. The firing takes only eight hours ; the smoke pours out through the flues nn. t « ■ .u t-t ^ the corners. Two men are required e ime o nng e i n. £ 0 attend to the firing; one feeds the kiln with the fuel, while the other attends at the top of the kiln to shut holes and to add more earth or plaster where necessary. The kiln is left for two days to cool; and on the third day it is unloaded. The unloading of the kiln does not take much time. Two men in two hours T can remove all the earthenware out of a kiln of the size mentioned above and arrange them in the shop which is always close by., The potters do not reckon the labour of unloading the kiln: but the loading takes half a day of two men.

But Ghulam Raza has to maintain his reputation and must exert himself to invite and attract people to his shop. So he gives a glaze to all the earthenware which he turns out. The inferior or spurious glaze in pottery. The materials used for this glazing are the following:— Rang .—This is made by grinding the material got by burning together ashkhdr (potash) and sang-i-ld. To make ashkhar a small kiln like the oven or tuntir in which the Seistani bakes his bread is prepared ; dry khan is put inside and fired. Then wishlan or lani, a salsolae rich in potash is added from above. The juice of wishlan runs down and pours into the small lumps of! charcoal at the bottom of the kiln. These lumps are called ashkhar. Sang-i-la is a stone found on the dashU It isibroken into pieces, the size of a pea ; it is then burnt with ashkhar in a small kiln. The stuff thus obtained is ground in a hand mill; and the semi-liquid material is called rang. The proportion of ashkhar to sang-i-la in making rang is 1 ^ to i, i.e., 15 man ofChap.

Seistdni will be used on 4 kilns of pottery ; the maximum that can be burnt in one month, Karbalai Ghulam Raza said that there are two methods of putting the glaze „ a , , . . , on the earthenware and the names of the ©too appymgt e guzo. earthenware thus glazed are two. One is kachol-i-pusht-o-ru ; the other is kachol-i-yak ru. In pusht-o-rtt) rang is always made thin like rich milk and is poured on the vessels after they have been dressed and finished on the potter’s wheel. The glaze is always poured on to the surface with a spoon and is never applied with a brush. This done lines and ornamentation are drawn on the inside and outside surface of the vessel with stah maida. It is necessary that the vessels should have dried thoroughly before the next process is started. The glaze is applied to the whole of the inside surface of the vessel, but only to about one-third part of the outer surface near the top. In the lines and ornamentations are done first, and then the rang Yak u is poured on. In the pusht-o-ru process the lines on the earthenware when baked are well defined and prominent; while in the yak ru process they are dim. These are the two methods of giving a glaze of inferior quality to pottery. If a green colour in the glaze is required, blue vitriol in the proportion of 1 in 40 is added to the rang, i.e., one sir of blue vitriol to one man of rang. The expenses and the income of the potter* As the potter said only four kilns could be burnt in one month, the expenses ExpenseSi and the income of the potter may be cal culated for one month in the following way 1. Fuel for 4 kilns at 6 krdn per kiln 2. The shagtrd or coolie for the month at 1 kran a day ... 3. Cost of glazing the earthenware of the 4 kilns at 23 kran each ••• ••• 4.

XLV.] 291 Glazed pottery or k 4 shf« Karbalai Ghulam Raza said that kdshi was no longer made in Seistdn. However, he had made a few kasa of kdshi to present to the Amir, and he gave Lala Thakur Dass one as a sample of the art that he knew so well. This vessel is among the samples of pottery and the materials used by the potter made over to the Director-General of Archaeology. In glazed pottery, only one more material is required in addition to those ^ mentioned already as used for giving ordinary glaze to biscuit pottery or kachol. This is a mixture of powdered sang-i-ld and ; the latter is brought from Birjand. These materials are made into powder and then screened dry; as much water is then added, as will suffice to make the mixture like butter milk . , ,, locally called dugh. This stuff is called Id, as it is used for the first coating of the earthenware. The vessels are prepared on the wheel in the same way as for ordinary Method of making kdshi. pottery. But the clay iox kdshi \s pre- pared with greater care and the vessels are made as thin as the potter can make them. He takes pains to select the best clay, removes all gravel or foreign matter, keeps it mixed for 2 days and nights and treads it out more thoroughly and makes the earthenware more light and of better shape. When the earthenware is dry, the first coat is given with the material mentioned above, called la. The vessel is put away to again dry, so that the lines and ornamentations may be added with the siah maida already mentioned. When the lines are quite dry, the upper coat is given from the material Kdshi or glared pottery. ? lread y ^ntioned, called rang If green lines are required, a mixture of sulphate of copper and water is used. The coatings of glaze are not laid on with a piece of cloth or with a brush ; Green lines. StU ^ P oure ^ on Outer surface with a spoon in a clever way, so that it is of a uniform thickness ; when it is poured inside the vessel a slight motion is given, so that all the inside surface is evenly covered ; the surplus material is then poured back into the jar. After being thus coated the articles are put in the air to dry. They are never exposed to the sun. The backing is done in the ordinary way. In kdshi the glaze is put on the whole surface inside and outside. The best results are distinguished by the even smooth surface of the vessel after it is burnt; and by the absence of cracks or spots on the vessel. The paint for the red lines is got from Herat. It is not obtainable in Kitin. In Kain kdshi is not made from ordinary earth, as that earth is bisyar Kdshi I. K 4 i„ ..cording to Qibl. Ghulum R..., skirin .&lt; &lt;'«•’ .

Earth of Kdin needs to be mixed with sang-i-la and gil-i-sarsho before it is prepared for manufacture on the potter’s wheel. The method of making and applying the glaze are said to be the same as in Seistan. The baking. Red lines. Sang-i m d$ or the burnt clay mill wheels found among many ruins in Seistdn. Qibla Ghulam Raza, the Birjandi potter, was asked if he knew anything about the burnt clay mill wheels or stones which are found lying near many of the ruins in Seistdn. He said that to the north of Jalai village near Nasratabdd there is a peculiar form of dash that must have been used in ancient times, for preparing those292 [Chap. XLV. burnt clay wheels or 11 stones,” as pieces are found around it in large numbers. He said that such burnt clay mill stones served the purpose of grinding wheat; but they were too* soft to be used in an as-i-gau (bullock driven mill) or as-i^ had (wind driven mill). The potter thinks that in the past the people were for some reason prevented from going to Banddn, for stone and experts arose in Seistdn to prepare mill stones from burnt clay. At that period these mill stones were used all over the country. But later on stones were brought from Bandan into Seistan and the people gradually forgot the art of making burnt clay stones. Ghulam Raza says that the process of making these mill stones is not very difficult- He himself had never had occasion to make them, but if any one would pay the cost of making them he would be glad to un dertake the work, he could not forecast the cost of the work, because he had no experience to guide him. Ihe method he would adopt to make them would be that by which the ancients in his opinion made the “ stones . This process w r as as follows: ashkhar, or the potash obtained from wishlan or shor t a plant rich in potash, is made in large quantities. Pure sand is then obtained ; and ashkhar and sand are mixed together or put in layers in the dash of the pattern generally met in Seistan. This dash is in the form of a long^ arch c&gt;f smaller radius at one end than the other. This arch is formed of highly vitrified earth in layers. It was evidently the custom to replaster the inside after every firing or every few firings. The potter thinks there was a very thin partition wall near the broader end of this kiln, which separated the ashkhar and sand from the brushwood whose flames provided an intense heat. The fuel w r as added from one end and the heat was transmitted to the ashkhar and sand on the other side of the partition wall. Ashkhar and sand became fluid by the intense heat generated from the flames of the bushes and flowed out of a small hole in the other end of the kiln into the moulds of the sizes of the required mill stones. It is a great pity I did not think of consulting Karbalai Ghulam Raza before, for 1 would certainly have put him to work on the old furnace at Jalai to see if he could outturn these burnt clay wheels, perhaps they should more properly be called fused or vitrified clay. It is one of the difficult archaeological problems of Seistan to explain w r hy the people used these burnt clay wheels in place of stones when they had quarries of stone close by at the Kiih-i-Khwaja, Kuh-i-Chaco and Kuh-i- BandAn. The Kuh-i-Khwaja is quite close by and is composed of a basaltic rock of the kind preferred for mill stones. Quarries of vast capacity from which enormous numbers of mill stones must have been taken are found on the hill. The only shaped stone to be found among the quarry refuse are broken hand mill stones. These can be found in large numbers. No. large stones such as are used in wind mills were noticed among the refuse. The quarry refuse consists of spawls such as would be made in chipping stone blocks to fashion mill stones. There is a remarkable absence of big stones. Hand mill stones are not now quarried from the Kuh-i-Khwaja ; in fact, some deny that such ever were got from these quarries, and explain them by saying either they were used to get stone to make the graves of the corpses that w r ere placed here till it was convenient to take them to the graveyard of some shrine ; or that some metal was mined for. The quarries are too broad and shallow to be those of a mine for an ore, which is usually found in a narrow r vein going deep. The graves are numerous but seem to have been made from the stones that could be prized up from the surface of the rock. One intelligent man said that the rock of the Kuh-i-Khwaja was too hard to be easily quarried, and that stones are so much more easily quarried at Bandan, that they can be sold cheaper in Seistan than similar stones from the Kuh-i-Khwaja could be. It is also noticeable that though many pieces of burnt clay mills are found no pieces of stone mills are ever seen among the ruins scattered over the country. ® 1 think the potter must be wrong here, as the Akhunzada Fakir Muhammad said that he had sent for such burnt clay “ stones ” from the sand-buried ruins to the south of Kala-i-Kang and had used them in flour mills driven by water power. We saw many pieces of burnt clav of large size near the ruins of a wind mill to the east of Zahidan. Though many pieces of burnt clay hand mills are found pieces of very big stones are also just as frequently found. The pieces at the dash at Jalai were Of the size for large mills that must have been driven by wind, water or bullocks. 12 93 Chap. XLV,] Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh says that such burnt clay mills are used in the Punjab for husking rice, but I have not been able to get any more informa tion on this point. The Khan Bahadur is of opinion that they were never used in Seistan for grinding corn, but for husking rice, which, he thinks was extensively grown in the vicinity of the ruins, where these vitrified clay mills are found. If this is correct many difficult points are explained. In these days a very small area of rice (shaltuk) is grown on the Afghan side at Kala-i-Kang. Sardar Khan Jan Khan made a trial sowing of 60 Seistan man at Siadak at the end of July 1904. List of technical terms of the Kacholgar or potter. Name in Roman character. English equivalents.

A detailed description of the fords along the river Helmand to the delta The ford, da,s«d. and the channels in the delta will be found in Appendix 21. These fords may be grouped in the following five classes :— Class /.—The fords from Girishk to Rudbar which are usually over boulder bars in the river. Class //.—The fords from Band-i-Mashi, 17 miles below Rudbar to Bandar- Kamal Khan , these are at places where the river spreads out in a wide channel at a bar of single, the bed, perhaps, having been prevented from scour by a harder layer of the alluvial through which the gorge is being cut. ///.—The fords from Bandar-i-Kamal Khan to the Jalai ford at Kabr-i-Haji opposite Deh Dost Muhammad (Arbab) at bars or rapids of gravel. r Class IV.—Vor&amp;s from the Jalai ford, 18 miles above the Band-i-Seistdn to the Banan ford (Shahgul) at places where the river spreads out among sand-hills and a sandy even bottom is obtained. cu ^“~, F °^ S 1 0 . n t ! le distribu tary channels. The Rud-i-Parian below the Shahgul ford, the Nad-i-Ah channel or Rud-i-Afghan and the Rud-i-Seistan. It will be noticed that all the fords are at “ Bars ” or shallows of the river for sand plays the same part where the fall in the river is small as gravel does where it is moderate, shingle where it is large and boulders where it is great. The best fords are then at permanent bars in the river. Our investigations of the river channel up to Band-i-Puza Mashi made in Changes nkeiy to occur at flood time. September i 9°4 shewed that at a great . . dood hhe that of 1885 great changes* occur in the river bed which completely alter the position of the less important fords, but the more important ones are seldom affected. Though some say the ford at Band-i-Puza Mashi was much improved by the flood of 1885 which piled up a great mass of material at this part of the river, and that the fordf at Bandar-i- Kamal Khan reappeared one mile higher up the river. The changes are due to the movement of the gravel and boulders along the bed of the stream during the height of the flood. &amp; 1 he Russo-Afghan Boundary Commission used the Chaharburjak ford both before and after the great flood of 1885 and recorded that no material change occurred; but as explained in Appendix 21 the upper ford is now quite a mile above the fort, while the lower is two and a half miles below : both are at ranids but the fall at the lower is exceptionally large.

In both 1903 and 1904 the latter half of February was distinctly and unseasonably warm ; General Goldsmid in 1872 and Colonel Yate in 1894 had the same experience; as a result in the first week in March of both 1903 and 1904 there was a sudden rise in the river, the volume being doubled in a day or two. This sudden risew'as probably due as much to the rainfall that followed the heat as to melted snow. March in the experience of all four of the years mentioned has been windy and cold. In 1903 an exception ally cold March, the volume of the river fell again in the third week to rise rapidly an d permanently towards the end of the fourth week of March.

XLVI. experience of the Mission all the fords of the Helmand are closed suddenly both for loaded animals and for equestrians early in March by this flood which seems to be usual even in very dry years like 1871 and 1902, when the rains failed altogether ; but in dry years the rise in volume is not enough to close the fords for long or perhaps not at all. The winter of 1904-05 was an abnormal one. The first flood of any t , . r importance occurred on the 20th March 1 he fords in the winter and spring; of 1005. i r 1 • i i t r ^ when the river rose suddenly trom 3,480 cusecs to 15,216 cusecs and the band was breached. Guides were sent up the river to Band-i-Puza Mashi to examine the fords. They had all disappeared for loaded camels, but the Band-i-Mashi, Deh Menai and Bandar-i-Kamal Khan fords were still available for men and riders. This flood passed away quickly, and from the 25th March* to the 15th May the river at the Band varied in volume from about 6,000 cusecs to 17,000 cusecs and then began to steadily decline at much the same rate and volume as in 1905. The fords reappeared on many days in April ; this was not so in 1903-04 ; from the end of April till the end of June the volume of the river day by day seems to have been the same as in 1904, and the behaviour of the fords must have been much the same. The Mission left Kuhak on the 15th May. The noticeable feature about 1905 is that the best fords remained fordable for riders throughout the year, and in April they were often fordable for loaded camels. The river rises to its maximum flood level towards the middle or end of Reappearance of to, d s . ^P' 1 °r in exceptionally late years early in May and then slowly but steadily subsides j the fords then appear in regular and well recognized order and at approximately the same time each year. The winter of the year 1903 was cold and the rains lasted till the end of April; as a result the river fell slowly and the fords did not reappear till July, which the people said was three weeks to a month later than normal. The harvest too was about^three weeks late. In the winter of 1904 heavy snowfall was reported, but the rains were neither heavy or late and the fords appeared in June. The year is said to have been normal. The fords in Class I from Rudbar upwards are said to appear some four or five days earlier than those in Class II. The fords in Class II are much superior to those in Class III which are seldom used for loaded camels except at very low river to save a long detour. ^ The Chaharburjak and Bandar-i-Kamal Khan fords are watched by the inhabitants of this part of the river as an indication of the volume of the river and the season, for they believe that these fords appear for loaded camels at the gathering in of the harvest. The fords in Class III appear about three weeks later. The fords in Class IV except those at Deh Lakri and the Parian are looked on as equestrian and cattle fords only. They do not become fordable for loaded camels for a month after the fords in Class II. Class V is a large one, and comprises fords of very different natures. The Nad-i-Ali channel is difficult to ford, and the fords disappear early in the flood season and reappear very late. There are two really good fords on the Rud-i-Parian at Jahanabad and Musjid-i-Gurg All which appear about the same time as the fords in Class III j the other fords are more suitable for riders and footmen. The Rud-i-Seistan in its broad deep upper reach also becomes fordable about the same time as Class III; but lower down after the head of the Rud-i-Hasanki has been passed and much water drawn off by canals, the fords are favourably placed and only disappear for a short time in high flood. The main river is now discharged by the Parian channel, and the other two The effect of the Band-i-Seist&amp;n on the fords. channels take varying proportions of the volume of the water that reaches the band. * The people have a proverb which says that at Nauruz it is warm whilst the week after Nauruz is the coldest and windiest of the year. This was the experience of the Mission ; each year we experienced hieh winds and great frost at the end of March. The same proverb is known in the Kandahar Valiev These extremes of weather are important to notice because they of course affect the flood in the riverChap. XLVL] 299 The band is completed about the middle of September, but it has little or no disturbing effect on the fords, because the volume of the river is not enough before the winter floods begin to cause those in the Rud-i-Seistan to disappear ; and the fords on the Rud-i-Parian and Rud-i-Nad-i-Ali are easily fordable some time before the band is completed. Very soon after the floods due to the winter rains begin the band is damaged or carried away and ceases to materially affect the distribution of the supply. This happens early in January as a rule. This, be it noted, is said to be what usually happens ; it w r as what happened in 1903 and 1904 the years for which the figures are given.* So long as the band resists the attack of the floods the unimportant fords on the upper reach of the Rudd-Seistan either disappear or are fordable with difficulty, whilst those on the Rud-i-Parian are more easy to ford than they otherwise would be. The important ford of Pulgi across the Rud-i-Seistan on the caravan road from India to Persia is only made unfordable when the river is in high flood. The fords on the Nad-i-Ali channel disappear with the first flood and seldom reappear till the floods are over. The effect of the band is most felt by the fords of Class IV above the band, which become difficult or useless soon after the band is made, but they are not important as they are seldom used for loaded animals and are little more than catch fords. The volume of the main river has been observed at the Band-i-Seistan and The voiume of tKe river at the at the time the volume at the time of the appearance fords disappear and re-appear. and disappearance of the fords for loaded camels has been noted for each ford and has been abstracted into a separate statement which will be found at the end of this Chapter. The fords in Class I above Rudbar appear when the volume of the river falls below 10,000 cusecs. Those in Class II from Band-i-Mashi to Bandar-i- Kamal Khan appear when the volume falls to 8,000 cusecs, and those in Class III and the Musjid-i-Gurg Ali ford on the Rud-i-Parian when the volume falls to 6,000 cusecs, and those in Class IV and the Jehanabad ford on the Rud-i-Parian when the volume falls to 4,000 cusecs. The Nad-i-’Ali channel, which at this time of the year takes about a fifth of the river, also becomes fordable as its fords begin to appear when its volume is under 800 cusecs. As already said the best and most used fords of the Rud-i-Seistan only disappear in exceptional floods. Horsemen and pedestrians can usually cross some ten days before a ford When fordable for equestrian and footmen. appears fit for loaded Camels ; but as the ford usually disappears in a flood, it be comes unfit for both loaded camels and riders on the same day and may, or may not, reappear for a few hours or days during the flood season according to the nature of the floods in that year. It is claimed for the Chaharburjak and Bandar-i-Kamal Khan fords that Fords lor loaded mules. loaded donkeys can be taken across. This is unusual at any time of the year for any fords the Mission have seen in 1903 ^ n d 1904, so no figures have been compiled for loaded mules, but in normal years they will only be able to get across with their loads during very low river in August and September and perhaps October, and then only at the very best fords on the river. When the weather becomes , cold the volume steadily rises, probably, as suggested by Colonel McMahon, due to diminished evaporation in the shorter, cooler days, and to a connected fact well known on the Frontier that underground springs discharge more in the cold wea ther than the hot. Once the rise sets in no ford is likely to appear for loaded mules in any but very dry years.

The notes in Appendix 21 to this Chapter will shew that all the above fords on the main stream of the Helmand have been in existence as far back as we are able to get information about them, and it is probable that they are not # See Appendix 25 on the great flood of 1885. very much affected by the big ^ floods. But the large number of fords that exist between these alter a great deal after each flood and must be carefully examined before they are used for crossing loaded camels. On the Rud-i-Parian the fords of Jahanabad and Musjid-i-Gurg Ali were the Best fords on the Rud-i-Parian, the Rud-i-Seis- best in the years 19^3 ^ 9 ^ 5 &gt; though the tan and the Nad-i-Aii channel. Maliki ford is on the high road from the City to Chakhansdr and therefrom up the Khash Rud ; but the site is not now so good as it was when the main stream flowed more to the east of its present position. On the Rud-i-Seistan the fords at Pulgi, Muhammadabad and Chilling are considered Gusar-i-Padshah. There are no good fords on the Nad-i-Ali channel. Since writing this note I have seen Mr. Merk’s note on his journey from Mr. Mark’s note on the isolated position of Seis- Chaharburjak to Bahnng at the end of tan during a great flood. December 1 885 ; the results of this Mis sion’s acquaintance of the fords of the Helmand fully bear out his remark on page 32 of Volumn V of the Intelligence Branch Records of the Afghan Delimi tation Commission ; “ I would add that from April to July the Helmand is not fordable at all anywhere in Seistan also “ during the time the Hamun is in full flood all ingress into, and egress out of, Persian Seistan for transport animals is confined to the road on the left bank of the Helmand ; for below a point 10 miles down stream of Kala-i-Fath the Helmand is not fordable and the Hamun to the north and west of Nasirabad can be crossed practically by raft only. ” The force of these remarks made on a visit to the country after the greatest flood that the present inhabitants remember will be clear after reading the next Chapter on the ways across the inundated area. The result of the Mission’s observations is that no ford below that of Ban- Tbe great importance of the Bandar-i*Kam£l dar-l-Kamal KhaOj 20 YS\\\QS ClboVB Kttld'l- Khdn and Chahdrburjdk fords. Path, can be relied on to be fordable for loaded camels except at low river. The Bandar-i-Kamal Khan and Chaharbur jak fords are therefore very important ones ; they are not of course fordable from the middle of March to the end of June in years of normal flood, and in years of extraordinary flood they may be closed earlier in March and not reap pear till the middle of July.302 CHAPTER XLVII.

Roads across the inundated lands. In Appendix 28 a detailed description has been given oi the best known roads or ways across the inundated area as they existed at the time the Mission was in Seistan. In those notes it has been pointed out^ that these ways are all situated in the reed marsh between the mouths of the rivers and the deep open water of the lake, and that their condition not only varies each year with the quantity and state of the floods, but also from time to time according to the position occupied by the tail of the main stream of the river. Since it is most important to realise this it may be useful to enlarge further on the general configuration of the country General description of the Se.stdn bas,». ^ s}]ew how the desertSi the river gorge |, cultivated area, Naizar and Hamun are interdependent and connected with each other. Seistan is a deep basin into which the drainage of a large tract of country is poured. The mountains off which the The dramage basin. perennial, and, therefore, valuable part of the water comes, are far removed from the lake basin, the intervening country being arid plains which on examination prove to be of alluvial origin; themselves doubtless deposited at a time when this drainage basin was more favourably placed for catching rainfall. This time must have been very far back in the geological ages. The present rivers have cut for themselves deep gorges or troughs with almost vertical sides through Thenver troughs an the a e. these alluvial plains: as described in Chap ter 1 the Seistan basin is itself surrounded on its eastern, northern and some part of its western and southern shores by similar high almost vertical scarps* or cliffs. The only parts where such cliffs do not exist are where the skirts of the Palan Kuh and Kucha Kuh have come down to the shores of the lake: this is situated at the extreme south-western corner of the great area which drains to it. There is, then, one within the other ; the drainage cr catchment basin an area of 125,069 square miles drained by all the rivers and their tributaries ; the Seistdn basin or depression 7,006 square miles in area containing the deltas of these rivers; the lake basin or inundated area of 2,742 square miles over which the waters spread at high flood ; the Haniun or residual lake of 1,474 square miles, or the ultimate receptacle of the waters of the rivers. In the Seistan basin each river, and in fact each stream, has made for itself a delta, an alluvial fan built up by the material brought by the river. But the fan of the Helmand river is by far the greatest, as the river itself is far larger in volume than any of the others. The fans that are at present watered are not the only ones that the rivers have made. There are ancient fans now deserted which form arid wastes inside the boundaries of the Seistan basin ; large tracts of country which are seldom visited, though they are still important, and are traversed by many of the roads radiating from the inhabitated tract. The alluvialf fans close in around the residual lake or Hamun proper and steadily encroach on it, as year by year more material is carried into the lake basin by the flood waters.]: When a river has spent a long time building up one The fans or deltas. * It is very difficult to get loaded animals up or down these cliffs or scarps except at the ramps made at convenient ravines by previous iTa/?Za. Such descents are called Aerkap by the Baluchi. When about to ascend or descend such cliffs it is therefore most necessary to stick to the path, and notice whore the Baluchi has put his marks or Chedhagh ; the correct way once lost is hard to find in the mass of ravines which cut up the scarp. ■ f The river and its fan may be readily exemplified by the lower arm and the hand. The fingers of the hand are the ridges on which distributaries of the river either flow now or did flow. The spaces between the fingers are the’lower lying lands into which the stream is liable to break. One hand may be used to illustrate the Rud-i- Helmand fan and the other that of the Rud-i-Farah. If the hands are held lightly in front of each other in the relative position of those two rivers, the fingers will touch or even interlace, but there will always be a boundary depression between the two hands which illustrates the Shela-UMesh Kushi. The space enclosed by the thumbs is the Puzak Hamun. t On the other hand, there is reason to believe that all deltas on the sea board subside ; and there is some reason to * .believe that the Seistan delta has also subsided. This point has been made over to the Director of the Geolo. gical Survey of India for study.[Chap. XLVII. 3°4 fan it rises so high over the more ancient and arid fans that it is liable to break away to start the process of building up again from this lower level. The residual lake or Hamun is in the deepest part of the lake basin farthest removed from the tails of the rivers de- The Hamun. livering silt laden water. The residual lake has been broken up into a number of small lakes or basins, the Hamun-i*Darazgu, . The Seistanis say the Sar-Shel, from its Hamun-i-Puzak Hdmun-i-Kah-i-Khwaja head to Gardan Reg at Boundary Pillar No. 12 and the Gaud“l-Zireh * CUt Oil trOUl each is also a Hamun ; while in the times when Sar-o* /-.fl-ior Hrr ptnf , m?tphin tar was inhabited there must have been a Hamun Other DV these encrOUCmn^ lailS. in that corner of the Seistan basin. The volume of the water delivered into the lake is not enough to make good the great loss from evaporation Thecul.ivatedtract. that occurs during the dry, hot summer with its phenomenal winds. Partly for this reason, but more especially because the coarser silt is deposited freely by the distributaries before they reach the terminal waters, a part of the delta is high and dry and quite out of reach of floods that can come from the filling of the lake ; this is the cultivated tract made green by utilising the waters of the many distributaries of the river as they flow to the lake. The sections shew that there is a sudden drop in the slope of the alluvial The Naizar cone as it approaches the residual lake, doubtless where the waters spread out in the inundated area, and deposit the finer silt over a wider area. Below this drop come the lower lying lands over which the waters spread on their way to the lake and over which the inundations rise several feet deep. This is where the reeds, bulrushes and rushes grow in abundance forming the Naizar or reed marsh. The reed marsh is broken up by ridges into pools (Chung) and the pools are connected one with another by channels called Shela by which the water poured in by the river flows from pool to pool till it reaches the Hamun or lake. So that in the Seistan basin we have arid plains, the deserted deltas; cultivated lands irrigated and cultivated by the waters that are depositing the silt that is slowly adding to the delta ; low-lying flooded lands, the Naizar, that have not been raised high enough to be above the flood level of the residual lake; and lastly a long, narrow, shallow lake occupying the lowest part of the basin furthest removed from the tails of the rivers with their burden of silt, so that the water received is clear and free of silt. The residual lake is seldom crossed, and then only by the most experienced . _ ..I tt of Saiyads or Gaodars (herdsmen) on their No ways across the residual lake Hamun. , . , , , v , ' tutin, but there are many short-cuts across the reed marshes or Naizar which save a long and difficult journey round the lakes. The roads or ways that are spoken of as existing in the “ inundated area” are across this Naizar ;f this low-lying land intermediate between the cultivated tract and the residual lakes or Hamun. It is in this tract that 638 families earn a comfortable and assured livelihood as graziers, and 600 families by strenuous exertion and skilled toil earn a living as netters of wild fowl and fish. These people have been described in Part III; they know every pool, every channel and every thicket of reeds and can find their way through what seem hopeless swamps hidden in impenetrable beds of reeds. With their assistance and guidance a cold weather may be pleasantly spent in the Naizar. The traveller or sportsman will see how easy are the paths, once they are known, and how healthy and full of interest are the lives of the people, who earn their living in these rich swamps. The inundated area in years of drought. In years of drought when the floods in the river are poor the water in the Naizar first dries up and then the water in the Hamun. Sir Frederick Goldsmid’s M ission arrived in Seistan in January 1872 just as the big drought that began in 1866 ended, and they found the inundated area practically dry and in much The ways are in the Naizar, f Conversely too the Naizar lies adjacent to the main roads from Seistan up the Kash Rud to Kandahar, up the Farah Rud to Herat and up the Bandan Rud to Meshed.305 Chap. XLVII.] the same state as we found it 30 years later in February 1902 coming as we did after the great drought which began in 1896. The flood waters are spread out in a shallow film seldom more than 12 to 16 t,, . feet deep as a maximun and at a general average depth of 4 to 5 feet only, even in a year of big flood like that of 1902-03.* They are thus easily dissipated by *In 1885 the average depth, excluding the Gand.i- the evaporating power of the hot dry, Zireh, was 8 feet, and greatest depth 19 to 21 feet, high Wind that bloWS from the end of May the depth m the Gaud-i-Zireh was 35 feet, to the end of August. Our measurements shewed that about 6 or 7 feet of water are thus evaporated in this period in the smaller open unsheltered pools. Doubtless the evaporation in pools protected by reed thickets or from large open waters is less. It will be seen from what follows that the absorption of the bed of the M ... Naizar and Hamun is practically No absorption in the bed of the inundated area. „ . * . , xt • ' it Excavations made in the JNaizar and the Hamun area shew that the alluvial is exceedingly hard, compact and dry. It would be thought that wells could be dug and water obtained anywhere in Difficulty in obtaining water in years of drought the bed of the inundated area, but this is in the Naizar and Hamun. on ]y p oss fbl e one or two places which will be described in the next paragraph. In years of drought the people with their cattle go to certain deep pools for their drinking water; such pools are—the long deep channel in the bed of the last 6 or 8 miles of the Farah Rud called Kurg-i-Gard, which is 30 feet deep in places, and which held water fit to drink till the end of the great drought in 1902; the deep pool of the Hamun-i-Sabari becomes brackish when nearly exhausted, but the deep pools, Chung-i-Siaho and Chung-i-Hasan Madaki, in the Hamun-i-Garkando, which lie to the west of Adimi, and are separated from the Hamun-i*Sabari by a ridge, remain sweet or at any rate drinkable to the last drop. The best place in the inundated area, where svreet water c^n be got in large Difficulty of obtaining water in wells in the quantities by digging in a year of great Naizac ' drought like 1902, is in the bed of the Rud-i-Gharutkhar. This is the channel which connects the south-east corner of the Hamun-i-Sabari with the Chung-i-Daraz to the west of Adimi. Through this channel the waters of the Hamun-i-Sabari are forced with great velocity by the high winds. Doubtless great holes have thus been scoured in the hard alluvial and again filled up with sand. This sand lying on the impermeable alluvial remains full of water, which is preserved from evaporation by the fact that the spaces between the grains of sand are too great for capillary action to withdraw the moisture ; in evidence of this is the often noticed fact that the upper few inches of sand are always dry, while below that the sand is moist. The cattle-owners say good wells were also dug at Chung-i-Ala Bakhsh near Khel-i-Autak-i-Kalan, Shela-i-Tishakani, Bahring, and at two places to the south-west of the Kuh-i-Khwaja. Wells are also dug in the Aukan-i-Galgala which connects the Chung i-Barfi with the Chung-i-Saruni, but the water in these wells, though sweet in January 1905, was brackish, though fit to drink in the autumn of 1902. There are sand beds in this Aukan which hold water, but the water when much drawn on becomes brackish, as the Farah Rud silt, they say, is always more alkaline than that of the Helmand. There are other similar places in the beds of shelas in this part of the inun dated area the part to the east of the Sabari Hamiin), where wells can be dug, but in a year like 1902 the water is apt to become too salt to be of any use for cattle, though in ordinary years, like 1904 or 1905, the water is drinkable even for men. It may not be out of place here to digress and say that even in the cultivated Sweet water in the wells in the cultivated tract tract sweet w’aters can only be got m years in years of drought. 0 f drought from wells where the formation is similar to that at the Riid-i-Gharutkar; that is, there must be a bed of sand surrounded by impermeable alluvial into which the water can get and is preserved, [C639FD] MMMM5 o6 [Chap. XLVII. Such places are the deep pools above the bifurcation of channels (see the re marks on the Shah Gul Ford, Appendix 21). These channels may be very ancient and now not apparent on the surface, the pockets of sand being buried under silt. In years of normal river there are many places where water can be got a few feet, or sometimes a few inches below the surface of the ground, the excessive flooding of the neighbouring lands having water-logged the upper decomposed silt or alluvial, which is often many feet in thickness^ and overlies the hard undecomposed alluvium below. This hard layer which is everywhere met with sooner or later in excavating in Seistan is called Sirr by the Seistani. In the sirr there is no water. The inundated area in years of abnormal flood. About three times in a century the Helmand and all the other rivers come down in enormous flood due to heavy rain Intervals between very great floods. ^ folIowing on a heavy Snowfall in winter. Such years were 1830, recorded by Connolly’s visit to Girishk in the following winter; and the year 1885 recorded by Mr. Merk’s visit to Seistan in the following winter. In such a year as 1885 the Northern Hamun, already very full from the winter floods, was rapidly filled to over flowing by an extraordinary flood that ; so that by the end of April the Northern Hamlin* had filled to overflowing and the Sar-i-Shela was flowing some 30 feet deep in places. A large volume of water as great as a big flood of most years also flowed down the Trakii Channel and en tered the Sar-i-Shela. The flood filled the Gaud-i-Zireh to a depth of some 30 feet. All the Shelas in the delta of the Sar-i-Shela in the Gaud—i-Zireh flowed and the tract for two or three years was an imitation on a small scale of the alluvial fan of the Helmand ; flock-owners rushed to the country and fed their sheep on the luxuriant grazing and grew millet and melons of marvellous size and sweetness for themselves. The great flood of 1885. come down in the first week of April •The water rose about 12 feet above the general level of the Naizar and was about 20 feet deep in the Sabari Hamun. Mr. Merk’s observations on the impossibility at such times of ingress to and * . , * c • egress from Seistan with loaded animals made on the occasion or his visit in Decem ber 1885 have been quoted at the end of Chapter XLVI, and the force of these remarks needs no further emphasis here. The same fact was brought to Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh’s notice —vide paragraph 103 (c) on page 71 of his “Report on his journey from Meshed to Quetta in 1898.” A detailed description of this flood is given in Appendix 25 from which it will be seen that the Sar-i-Shela became fordable at the end of autumn except when the strong winds blew, and at such times it was not fordable all through that winter. In such years Seistan is a very uncomfortable place ; large areas of Stand- Loss, discomfort and sickness in years of great mg CTopS and large quantities of grain in fl0od ’ __ t pits in the ground are destroyed. Though the waters drain off the cultivated tract very rapidly, yet myriads of insects are bred and great sickness among animals and some sickness among men is bred from the unusual state of the country. In such a year the roads or ways across the inundated area are only feasible for tutin across the highest ridges, because the depth of water in which the the poles must be worked is too great. In such years it is easy to march round the outside of the lake basin because sweet water can be got from the lake, and caravansf that do not wish to go into Seistan are much convenienced by the ease with which sweet water is obtained. Roads round the lake. t?ee paragraph 103 {d) of Khan Bahadur Maula Bakh^h’s note already referred to. The inundated area in normal years or years of moderate floods. The i Mission first saw the Naizar after the water in the Hamiin had prac tically dried up after drought, but the winter floods had restored water to some &gt;307 Chap. XLVIL] of the pools. The spring floods were high and of long duration, so that the Northern Harrnin filled up by the end of June, and the state of the inundated area subsequently was about normal; so that the notes of our experiences give informa tion of what may be expected in most years. In normal years the ways across the Naizar become closed for loaded animals much about the time the fords on the rivers appear, and travellers must cross the Naizar on tutin. No very exact dates can be given for this event, but the floods from the river may be expected to have produced this result about the end of May or the middle of June. The roads will then remain closed for loaded animals till the effect of the four months wind has lowered the water so much that the ridges which the roads follow are dry. The time of the year when these phases occur never changes, though the date may vary very much; a great deal depends of course on the quantity of water already in the Hamlin when the floods begin, and the strength of the wind and the greatness of the heat of the summer. Position of the roads across the Naizar. The position of the roads across the Naizar are due to the fact that the fans of rivers from opposite sides of the basin have met or even overlapped at certain places providing well-defined high ridges which make the best and only certain roads across the Naizar. Such are the following:— (i) The road between the fans of the Helmand and the Khash Riid nid Khwaja Girak. (ii) The road from Takht-i-Shah past Tappa-i-Kharan over Shela-i- Mesh Kushi from the long extension of the Helmand fan at Takht-i-Shah on to a similar extension of the Farah Riid fan near Tappa-i-Kharan. (iii) The great road from Seistan to Persia which crosses between Afzalabad and Bahring from the Helmand fan to the fan of the Bandan torrents, which bringdown an immense quantity of material from the comparatively high hills close by. These nala have a large catchment and have made a quite respectable, and for this purpose, very useful fan. (iv) The road across the head of the Sar-i-Shela at Tappa-i-Mir Dost is made by the fan of the Helmand piled up when the river went down the Traku Channel; this has been met from the western side of the basin by the fans of the torrents from the hills around Tursh Ab. These hills are quite close to the basin and therefore they bring down much material on the few occasion that they are in flood. These are the important ways across the Naizar ; the others are less important, being only feasible for loaded animals in times of great drought when the Naizar is dry ; they may be briefly described here:— (i) The road followed by General Goldsmid from Kala-i-Nau vid Chash- maka to Salian and Peshawaran runs on high ridges which would often be dry enough for traffic if the Helmand did not happen to discharge its main volume right on to it; but at present the road as the notes will show is abandoned by ordinary travellers, though much used by denizens of the Naizar. (ii) The Rah-i-Tishakani from Adimi to the left bank of the Farah Rud along the spit of land which divides the Naizar from the Sabari Hamun is only fit for horsemen and foot travellers. It is an interesting route, as it travels along spits of land which seem to owe their origin to the waves of the Sabari Hamlin ; these impelled by the strong wind have piled up a beach on the lee shore which has been utilised as a convenient short cut from the City to the Aukat-i-Seistan. (iii) The ways given as items 7 to 10 of Appendix 28, Rah-i-Chung- i-Daraz, Rah-i-Kundil Khani, Rah-i-Tiratki, Rah-i-Surkh Gazi308 [Chap. XLVII. are those suitable for poling tutin when the road across the Naizar from Afzalabad to Bahring is closed by water. At times when the Naizar is dry any one of them may be used for loaded animals, but of course the road along the Telegraph Line is the best. The tutin take the way which is shortest or has water of Just sufficient depth for poling. The notes in Appendix 28 explain which road is used at each stage (level) of the water in the inundated area. Changes in ways due to changes in the direction oj the river. It is outside the scope of this Chapter to discuss what changes would occur to these ways across the Naizar or even to the fords on the river if the rivers broke down some old long since disused bed. The notes indicate whenever possible what happened in small changes in the river such as have occurred in the last 30 years or so. That the subject is full of interest can be easily understood, and any one desiring to pursue this subject may reflect on what must have been the condition of affairs when the Helmand river went down the Trakii channel which it certainly did in the most ancient times, for it is in this delta that the palaeolithic implements have been found, and it must have returned more than once since from the variety of the ruins. The Farah Rud has got into so deep and Iowa channel that it must remain where it is for a long long time to come. We do not know enough of the old channels of the Khash Rud to say what may happen there. Sir Henry Rawlinson’s very interesting and inspiring article on Seistan written on the return of the Goldsmid Mission and published in the Royal Geo? graphical Society's Journal for 1873 should be read; he discusses in a very learned way the probable position of the Helmand River whenever we read of in ancient history.CHAPTER XLVIII.

With the Mission were four Sutlej boatmen,* very able and sterling good men; they had often sailed the big Sutlej cargo boats from Phillour to Sukkur and back ; they had also been up and down the river Helmand as far as Kala-i- Madar-i-Padshah with our survey parties many times. These men asserted confidently that throughout the time they were in Seistan the broad flat bottomed boats, they were accustomed to use on the Sutlej, could be used on this part of the Helmand as far down as its entrance to the Naizar. In the hot weather on the Sutlej the wind blows up the river, as it does on the Helmand, and the boatmen take advantage of this and sail back to their homes up the river against the stream. They are able to sail 30 to 40 miles a day with a favour able wind. The Sutlej boatmen were confident the same could be done on the part of the Helmand that they knew during the time the 120 days wind blew. During the latter part of this wind the river is at its lowest and in years of very low river the boats could not pass the shallows, bars, or rapids. But when the river was in as good flow as we knew it the boats could get up and down the river as far as Bandar-i-Kamal Khdn with the same ease that they travel between Phillour and Sukkur on the Sutlej River. The average longitudinal slopes of the river below Bandar-i-Kamal Khan are not much if any greater than they are on the rivers of the Punjab that are navigated by the big flat bottomed boats, but it is probable that the increase of slope up the river as far as Khwaja Ali would add much to the difficulties of navigation ; and above Khwaja Ali we may expect the slope to stiffen to such an extent that the difficulties would be so seriously increased as to make profitable navigation impossible. Moreover, the one hundred and twenty-day wind becomes less strong as one goes up the valley above Rudbar. Even at Rudbar it is not so strong as in Seistfin. The slopes in short lengths of the river from Kala-i-Madar-i-Badshah vary in different reaches from 1-44 to 5-6 feet a mile, while on the Nile from Khartoum to Assuan the slopes appear to only vary between 0-31 to 2'35 feet a mile ; it would therefore appear that the Helmand is by no means such a favour able river for navigation as the Nile. Since the fall of the Helmand river is so great, power for propulsion should camel thorn and scrub jand are the only fuel; these are highly inflammable bushes that give a great heat in a flame kiln, but could only be used to generate power in special furnaces, which probably do not exist on the market and would need to be designed; such special designs often require years of experience to produce an efficient engine. Boats are in use at the ferry at Girishk and for a bridge of boats ; a boat oounaary commission ana went as tar as Uhaharburjak., This is the only boat the people of the valley remember to have seen, and it is now talked of as Merk Sahib’s boat. Two boats were sent down by His Highness * The names and addresses of the four Sutlej boatmen are given in the following list.

R. Foy, Executive Engineer, Bari Doab Canal, from Rarnpur, a place in the valley of the Ravi, where they are called Drat. The Osgood being a canvas imitation of a birch bark canoe was well-adapted for descending the river; but the Drai required an immense amount of lung power to blow up and keep blown and no one but a native boatman could keep them inflated.CHAPTER XLIX.

After the notes obtained from the above were compiled and the record made, I was able to examine the books of travellers who had visited the Helmand; the two accounts agree much better than could be hoped. The notes obtained from travellers are given in their proper place under the year to which they refer. The Baluchis living along the river appear to be very observant of the , , . K , height and character of the annual floods, and class them in five grades—(1) Nuh % (ii) Sel-i'Kaldn, (iii) Self (iv) Kdlabi or Sdl-i-Khush and (v) Sdl-i-Khushk. Nuh is an extraordinary flood ; two such floods are now spoken of, that in the spring of 1885 when the water found its way down the Trakii Channel; the other was in the spring of 1830. The date of the former flood was fixed by the Russo-Afghan Mission who passed through on their way to the frontier in the previous October and some of them returned in the following December under Mr. Merk. A description of the effects of the flood on the Traku depression, the Sar-i-Shela and Hamiin was given by Mr. Merk, who saw this part of the country at the end of December of that year, the flood is described in detail in Appendix 25. The flood of i83ow r as mentioned by Lieutenant Connolly in his book Overland Journey to India.”.

In I904 the flood was Kdlabi in Seistan, but it was deficient in Garmsel; it did not properly flood the lower lying shelving lands, called aumal or mdshi, nor did it fill the higher canals properly, so the area of autumn crops was small and the inhabitants of the valley were inclined to put the year in the next lower class. Sdl-i-Khushk is a year in which the floods are deficient in volume; such are the years 1902 and 1905.3*7 Chap.

Colonel Yate was told* the same at Milak in 1894. But the Arbab Saif-ud-din thinks there is no such simple connection between the times of floods. How far each is likely to be correct can be gathered from the above statement. The great flood previous to 1872 was in 1865 and the year 1903 was a year of great flood.

A flood mark is called Kachana, and the mark of floods on the vertical bank or cliff near the village is noticed and remembered by observant Baluchis. The flood marks are also found by experts by the characteristic deposit of silt (locally called wars huff) which marks the flood level. Karod is the vertical bank or cliff. Karodi and Karodak are diminutive forms of the word. Karod is limited by some to a bank that is being under cut. _ Aumdl is a shelving shore ; these are lands which are enriched by deposits of silt fmdl) at flood times; they are also called mdshi, as mash is grown on them after the flood subsides, vide second page of Chapter II. Guzar is a scarped or ramped bank down which men and animals can go. The scarp or cliff from one plateau {ddshf) to a lower or to the river or lake is called kirn ; and the road by which camels can descend such a scarp is called aerkaf or the descent. By some kirn is limited to the cliffs made quite vertical by being under-cut by water. Sirr is the hard alluvial of the country ; it is met with everywhere in excavation in the cultivated lands, or on the ddsht, as well as in the trough of the river. C639FD PPPPCHAPTER L. CONTENTS.

This account may be usefully abstracted here; for it shews that the Riid-i-Parian at Jalalabad in 1894 was much the same stream as we saw it in 1903 ; it was then fed by Shelas that left the main stream above and below Burj-i-As. As a result, the country to the north of Burj-i-As was flooded to a larger extent by the moderate flood o ^ 1894 than it was by the great flood of 1903.

That was in July 1859. J The next day Colonel Yate marched from the pillar of Milak to Deh Ghulam. He says they crossed the first branch of the river 3 miles north of Milak and about 3 miles south of Deh Saiyad; the stream was 60 yards wide and 5 or 6 feet deep at the Ferry, but was fordable for loaded camels 300 yards further down. This is now called the Shela-i-Jahanabad or Shela-i-Mehmendi. It is a dry Shela and ceased to flow in 1896 when the river burst the embank ment at Milak. The next branch was met after going for seven miles through dense tamarisk with small clearings for cultivation here and there. The stream was running strong and was 80 yards wide and 5 or 6 feet deep running level with the banks. This was no doubt the channel now called Shela-i-Lakhshak, and is said by the people to have carried the mainstream up to the time the Parian formed. This, too, is now a dry Shela, but a part of its bed is used to feed the Siadak canals. Colonel Yate camped on the bank at Deh Ghulam. Colonel Yate rode from this crossing 3 miles up stream to the Band-i- Afghan, “a succession of embankments which turned off almost all the waters of the Helmand from the main bed into the channel Colonel Yate had just crossed.” The old bed was locally known as the Sim. An Afghan village of Deh Taus stood at the eastern end of embankment. The water flowing down3 2 ° [Chap.

The road to Pulgi then crossed 8 miles of flooded lands covered with dense tamarisk. On the yth the lands around Pulgi were being rapidly inundated and people were hard at work making embankments. Colonel Yate found the water at the Margan {sic) ford I mile wide, and with a high north wind blowing, tntin took four hours to go across and back again.

Colonel Yate described it in 1894. It is evident from Colonel Yate’s description that previous to 1895 the main stream found its way to the Shelas which pass Jalalabad and Margo from the Shela-i-Jahanabad and Mehmendi which pass south of the villages called Pokak; the more direct course from Milak to the Shelas between Jabanabad and lalalabad had not then been formed. The year that the main stream of the Helmand broke to the west from Shahgul is fixed by the Baluchistan Afghan Boundary Commission of 1896. That year is known in the valley as the Sal-i- Godam, or the year in which supplies were collected for that Mission. The supplies were collected at Chahar Shaklak opposite Chaharburjak and at the Gumbad-i-Nadiri near Kala-i-Kamal Khan. The remains of the managers {dkhur) of the horses of the sowars were noticed by the Mission on their march down the valley. The Afghan Commissioner and the Hakim of Chakhansur had some difficulty to get the supplies across the river, as the river was then in high flood. They went with the supplies to Gudar-i-Shah where they met the British Commissioner, Colonel McMahon, on the 9th April 1896, and accompanied him to Robat. When they returned from Robat about 20th April the Sar-i-Shela was in flow and they crossed at the Guzar-i-Shamshiri. The embankment on the left bank of the river between Milak and Shah Gul was breached in 1895 and some crops were destroyed ; it was repaired again, but the breach in 1896 was not repairable. Colonel Yate was told that a breach had occurred there in 1891 and had been repaired. In the flood of 1903 a breach was made in the embankment to the south of Shahgul village, some 2 miles higher up stream, and the water passed down alow&gt; lying tract, called Khadung (low lands). Doubtless a few years hence the river will open up this breach again and the stream will pass through Deh Jehangir and Khadung.321 Chap.

In October 1902 the Persians extended the Jahan- abad Canal up the bed of the river towards the Bnnd- i-Shahgul to draw the leakage into it, and in doing so cut through this hard bed and spoilt this lucky site for a band for ever.

F°r the 2 years, 1896 and 1897, the Persians and Afghans co-operated and built a band across the head of the Rud-i-Parian, called the Band-i-Parian ; this band was of tamarisk and similar in all details to the Band-i-Seistan, built at nftk f Remains 0 t lt J coald be seen before the flood of 1903 just down stream °F,r 6 R tW °,K CU f tS call ^ d th .e J^-Ukhshak and Ju-i-Jahanabad.

Bat Capt j in S T ^ e . S&lt; ^ ritin ^ on the 28th March i 8 99, says that the reason given for Sardar Khan Jan _ Khan’s flight from the Miankangi was that he had made himself unpopular by digging the Lakhshak Canal with Afghan aid. In 1898 the Afghans proposed to dig a third canal for the same purpose and started the work, but the Persians objected to the excavation of a cut in Persian territory and the hashar was removed to Afghan territory and dug the t ju-i-Afghan or Nobar-i-Afghan. existing Afghanf cut. 1 his cut was dug . in 10 days and the Band-i-Shahgul was made for the first time. The Persians tried to make the Band-i-Parian but failed - smce this attempt the Band-i-Parian was not made again till 1904 but the Afghans made the Band-i-Shahgul each year, except in 1903, when an ample supply went down the Nad-i-Ali Channel throughout the spring crop season and wo band were built. But in 1904 the supply to mature the autumn crop was deficient, so the Persians built the Band-i-Parian and the Afghans built the Band- i-Shahgul; the former was built just below the natural mouth of the Nad-i-Ali Channel and the latter just below the Afghan cut; both band forced water into the Nad-i-Ali Channel. The reason given for making two band, instead of co-operating to make one was that neither party could rely on the other to properly complete the work, so each did their own. The Afghan cut is narrow and the bed has a gravel bottom so the ( draw ’ is restricted. The site of the Band-i-Parian is sandy and bad! So that this arrangement is a very bad one. About the end of July or beginning of August 1902 the waters of the Hel- Major Benn’s account of the dry year, 1902. mand fell so low that they were allabsorb- ..... ed by the Rudbar Canal and just sufficed for the irrigation on that canal; all the channels below the baud at Pulalak at the head of the Rudbar Canal becoming dry. Major Benn savs that the strong winds whipped the sands of the bed up into barkhan, and it was difficult to dis tinguish the river beds in the delta from the surrounding country. There were stagnant pools in the bed above Milak and water could be o- 0 t by digging 6 inches or so ; at the Consulate good water w r as obtained in wells 6 to 9 feet deep. The water reached the Band-i-Seistan again on the 22nd September, where it was diverted into the Rud-i-Seistan by the band, which had become water tight by the sand driven over it by the wind. The water reached the City by the morning of the 24th September, a distance by the channels of not less than 25 to 30 miles, so that a good volume must have impelled it along. # On the 24th, too, some water trickled through the band and a crowd of cultivators prepared a way for it down the bed through the sand-hills which were very thick. [C639FD] QQQQ3 22 [Chap. L. The wind had blown sand against the debris of the Shahgul band built the year before by the Afghans; this completely blocked the course of the water and diverted it down the Ju-i-Shahi, another name for the Afghan cut, into the old Helmand or Nad-i-Ali Channel. Major Benn followed it from the band to Milak which it reached on the 25th. On the 26th it reached Deh Dost Muhammad, so that the overflow from the band must also have been considerable to have travell ed so fast down a sandy parched bed. On the 27th it had not reached Maliki on the Rud-i-Parian. By the 22nd October Major Benn says that he crossed the Rud-i-Parian and found a good flow of water, the Band-i-Shahgul having been demolished by the increased flow of water. Rain fell on the 29th October, the first since the 21st March 1901, but by the 5th November the water had not reached the Sikhsar. By the 15th November the Helmand had risen considerably and there was approximately an equal division of v^ater at the band. Between the 1st and 13th December the Seistan band was completely demolished, as also the band at the mouth of the Puza-i-Jang Jah Channel, and w r ater became ample for cultivation throughout the Miankangf except at Takht- i-Shah which got ample water by the end of December. Between the 15th and 21st December there were heavy floods and the Parian and the Helmand had to be crossed by tutin. The above information is from a note kindly made by Major Benn ; turning people say, it appears Events subsequent to September 1902. now to what the that when the water reached the Band-i- Seistan the Afghans wished to have it divided half to each as is the usual custom at the band y but the Persians declined ; when the water reached Shahgul the Persians then wished half to be passed on to the Persian channels on the Rud-i- Parian, but the Afghans declined. In the feeling which arose over these episodes on the return of the water, the Afghans started a cut to draw water from the main river some miles above the Band-i-Seistan and to drop it back into the river above the Shela-i-Jharuki, This cut is now called the Nahr-i-Sultani. The Persians organised by the Sultan Mir Husain of Khadung excavated a channel to outflank the Band-i-Shahgul, called the Naobar-i-Puza-i-Jang Jah ; the bend in the river across which the cut off was made having been the scene of a fight between some Afghans and Toki Baluchis. Both cuts were pushed on with great vigour and energy and were finished in about a month or two. But even so before they were ready the river had come down in unusually early flood and breached the band at Kuhak and Shahgul as described by Major Benn. The Sultani Canal has since been developed into a canal for the irrigation of the tract lying on the east bank of the river from the Band-i-Seistan to the Shela*i-Charkh. But the Puza-i*Jang Jah Channel was closed off by a substantial band at either end after the floods of 1903, it being a useless channel and might have drawn the main river down itself with the consequent loss of the small piece of land now lying between it and the west bank of the river. The Lakhshak cut which, previous to the drying up of the river in 1902, ended in the Nad-i-Ali Channel above Pokuk was extended across the Shela-i- jahanabad and carried down parallel to the river to feed the Shela-i-Lakhshak, which in its turn feeds several important canals near Siadak. The explanation of this course of action given by the people is that on the return of water at the end of September, the Afghans declined to allow any water to go from the Nad- i-Ali Channel into the Persian channels. It is said that the Deh Dost Muham mad Canal was accordingly closed by a band for 20 days after the water reached Burj-i-As, but after negotiation water was allowed to the Deh Dost Muhammad canal and the point settled in a friendly way. The Lakhshak Canals were fed direct from the Rud-i-Parian by the extension described above. The 20 days is no doubt an exaggeration, because the descriptions of eye witness would lead one to infer that water reached the Band-i-Seistan early inChap. L.] 3=3 September, and that it was impounded there about a month by the direct action of the Persians, but Major Benn was on the spot and has left it on record that the water was only delayed the few days already described. It is s ^id, too, that the Afghans had built a band of earth across the river below the Khwabgah Canal head, which was cut in the night by some Persians stealing up the river ; but reading Major Benn’s description, it is evident a much too large a volume of water came down the river to be carried off by the small ivnwabgah Canal and the band was probably overtopped and breached. on 1 ^ ^ no ^ ce d thM Major Benn also says that the water had not reached the bikhsar by the 5th November; from this it would appear that the Afghans prefer- red that all the water should go down the Charkh towards Kala-i-Kang: the bed or the latter is much lower than that of the Sikhsar. In the flood of 1903 the river cut into the west bank at the bend above Precautions needed in working the Lakhshak Burj-i-As and carried away a part of the ? n T C , h ' kh ', . Lakhshak. So that in 1903-04 the Shela- i-Lakhshak and the Deh Saiyad water-course were fed from this 8 point on the Nad-i-Ali Channel above Burj-i-As. But there is a great draw down the Lakhshak from the Nad-LAli Channel and the Afghans limited the waters to the Lakhshak by placing a tamarisk weir across its mouth. Previously they would not allow the Lakhshak to be fed f from its old mouth below Burj-bAs at the place where the Charkh and Deh Dost Muhammad Canals take off, because the draw there is also great. In fact, the Nad-i-Ali Channel from Milak past Burj-i-As and on down the Sikhsar has been the main stream for such a long time that it is now on a ridge,f and at each flood threatens to either break down the Shela-i-Charkh to the east or the Shela-i-Lakh- shak to the west, and the heads of these Shelas are kept carefully banded off by the Afghans and the irrigation is fed from leading cuts that are under control. ’This is the sjgpt known as Janjal or place of dispute. . tFrom the banks at places not obstructed by tamarisk the eye overlooks the country fora great distance just as it does from an artificial canal bank.CHAPTER LI.

Supply tO the main blanch at the bifurca” , , , . * tion of the river; other are built both up and down the river. For instance, since the time of the Goldsmid Mission, band were made above or below Burj-i-As to control the supply to smaller branches of the river or to artificial cuts ; w r e have the history of these band ; there was one above Nad-i-Ali, one below Burj-i-As, one at Deh Taus and one at Deh Bahlol; these have been described in detail in Appendix 31 (Chapter L). These band ceased to be needed in 1896 when the Rud-i-Parian formed. It then became necessary to build the band across the main river at the head of the Nad*i-Ali Channel that has been described in Chapter XIV; this band has since been made each year, except I 9 ° 3 &gt; when the Nad-i-Ali Channel drew the requisite supply without a band. Five miles below the Band-i-Seistan a had for years been made to feed the Jharuki Canal which flowed down an ancient arm of the river towards Shoro in Afghan Seistan, This ceased to be required in 1902 when the Afghans opened up the Sultani Canal, to feed this system of irrigation. But the Afghans then placed a band at the head of the Sultani Canal to raise the water level at times of low river sufficient to feed that canal. In this they have only partially succeeded. The head of the Sultani Canal is 5 miles above the Band-i- Seistan. Each canal along the river from Kala-i-Bist downwards has its scheme of band for feeding the canal at low river; and it is necessary to understand the simplicity and efficiency of these band as well as that of the Band-i-Kuhak, and not to be alive only to their defects, to be able to criticise the traditions which states that a permanent masonry weir once existed on the Helmand. To place an obstruction across the main river would require more labour than the cultivators on these small canals could supply, so the canal is arranged to take out from a branch or side channel of the river. When the period of low river comes and the supply has fallen too low to properly feed the canal, the branch is closed below the head of the canal, and all the water in the branch then goes down the canal. If the river fell so low that the branch became dry, a spur would be thrown out at the head of the branch to force the water into the branch. If the river fell still lower the spur might be carried across the river and become a band; this was done in 1902 at Pulalak when the water that reached that band only sufficed for the Rudbar Canal and was all caught and carried off by the cultivators of Rudbar. The effect of this use of the branch of a river is to give the canal a head much higher up the river. Freshets come down the branch and carry away the band which have to be renewed. These band in the branches are usually closing band or embank ments not throttling band or weirs as the band in the rivers are. The band at Puza-i-Mashi is the only weir that I have heard of up the river which was carried right across. But this band has not been made in recent years; when I visited the site about 20,000 cusecs of water flowed over it, so it is probable that a detailed investigation would show that here, too, the band was only made to close off favourable branches of the river. It may be noticed that from Puza-i-Mashi upwards the band are made of shingle, packed in gabions made of tamarisk; these weirs are not easily carried away and allow regulation of the supply by closing off the leakage through the intervals between the gabions, C639FD RRRR[Chap. LI. 326 The band I saw at the head of the Kala-i-Fath Canal at Kala-i-Mir were made of gravel; a few gabions (locally called pil) had been used to close the final gap. A detailed drawing of the band made at the head of the Bandar*i» Nau canal in 1904 will be found among the plans in the box. Lower down the river, where shingle is not obtainable, tamarisk collected into faggots and layers is used to throttle the side channel of the river from which the canal takes out; such a side channel may be closed with an earth band, or first throttled with tamarisk and then when the supply in the river has become low enough to enable this to be done, closed with earth. The local traditions say that there have Ancient band or weir*. ^ fiye grea t On the-' Hdmand beside the present band at Kuhak— (1) Band*i-Burj-i-Kuhak. (2) Band-i-Dik-i-Dila. ( 3 ) Band-i-Yako or Akwa at or above Band-i-Kamal Khan. ( 4 ) Band-i-Puza-i-Mashi. (5) Band-i-Pulalak. This enumeration gives their names in the order in which the sites are reached proceeding up the stream from Kuhak. An examination of the site of the first three shows that they are at ancient bifurcations of the river. The head of the delta of the Helmand is evidently at Bandar-i-Kamal Khan where the confining cliffs on the south bank of the river end and where a well-marked old bed of the river, called the Rud-i-Traku or Taraku, can be traced to the west. The next old bed down stream of the Traku Rud is found at Dik-i-Dila where the ancient valley or trough known as the Sena Rud goes to the north west. Tradition says that in ancient times a band existed here. It is also more than probable that in ancient times a branch going towards Paisai and Palangi also left the river somewhere between Dik-i-Dila and Kala-i*Fath. Further down the river between Kala-i-Fath and Burj-i-Kushk (some 6 miles above the Band-i-Kuhak) several old river beds with training embankments and canal systems can be traced, and tradition says that a band was once made here on the river. The cultivation around the ruins of Sar-o*tar was done from canals from one of these bifurcations. The big Zorkan and Zarkan canals that extend to Amiran and Chakhansur are traceable to a bifurcation in this vicinity. Puza-i-Mashi is 35 miles and Pulalak is 65 miles above the head of the delta at Bandar-i-Kamal Khan; the former is the site of the weir that feeds the bigChahar- burjak Canal. A gabion and boulder band used to be made here every year till the flood of 1885. It is said that the rapid or natural weir at this site was then so much raised by the shingle brought down by the flood that it has not again been neces sary to build the artificial weir. It is certain that this has been the site of important * Wherever an ancient channel was excavated Canal Systems which irrigated on the right bank river - , because the remains* of blown or washed away. several large canals can be traced at places where they have escaped destruction by the river when swinging from side to side as rivers do in alluvial valleys.

Pulalak is the site of the head of the present Rudbar Canal, and was also the site of the head of canals to the most ancient times. The Ju-i-Gar- shasp mentioned by Bellew can be traced all down the south bank of the river going into the delta along the old Traku river. These are, I think, one and the same canal system which had its head above Rudbar near Pulalak. Though itChap. LI.] 327 is open to doubt whether the canal that went down the Traku Rud past Bandar* i-Kamal Khan ever, took out higher up the river than Puza-i-Mashi. The traces of the canals at the critical point have been swept away by the river. All we can say is that the knowledge of the use of levels we have now attained to would enable the desired object to be got by a canal that took out somewhere at on above Chaharburjak, and if the ancients went higher up the river, they did so, because the river flowed at a lower level than now. evt:- Tradition says that the band or weir on the Helmand for Seistan was of improbability of a masonry weir ever having* dnasonry*; but diligent search has failed existed near the delta of the Heimand. s : to discover any taces of a masonry weif\ ~A * See page 278, Journal of the Royal Geographical careful investigation ^US made when Coming Society, 1873. down the river iri February 1903 ; agsiin in Rawimson's “ Notes on Seistan.” j une irtig^tion party made a careful ex ploration up the river to Rudbar, and again in September 1904 when the river was very low and the water was quite clear a thorough search was made up to Puza-i- Mashi. On each occasion the whole trough of the river was examined and not the present river bed alone. The people could not point out anjf remains of a masonry dam,f though many repeated the tradition that the dam was destroyed by^ the removal of a brick to increase the supply to a favoured part in the delta (zWe first page of Appendix 23). It is very unlikely that the masonry dam was higher up the river than Pulalak and the reach of the river from Pulalak to Rudbar could not be thoroughly searched for a second time. But it will presently be shewn that it is very unlikely that a masonry weir has even been made for the delta. There is no tradition or report or rumour that one has ever been made higher up the river than Pulalak for irrigation in the trough, so that it is almost certain that no masonry weir has ever been built on the Helmand. The regulation of the supply has been done by gabion and boulder band (obstructions) in the upper reaches ip the trough and tamarisk in the lower reaches in the Deka. The only object of making a permanent weir across the river would have been to secure water for the autumn crop. The defect of the temporary band is t This is one of the reasons that there is such a that it can only be built at low river, where- small area of autumn crop on the Rud-i-Seistan as to properly maturet the autumn crop a and such a large area of spring crop. • • k j j .. r i j .1 r *i* i weir is needed to hold up the failing supply and pass it on to the lands. The temporary weirs along the Helmand can only be made at low river, and they are always breached and sometimes entirely carried away during the flood season. A permanent weir would be ready to be used to regulate the failing supply after the spring floods had passed. But if a permanent weir were built across the river, it would obstruct the flow in flood and cause silting up of the channel above the weir and so raise the flood levels. So that under sluices to induce a scour to remove this silt, aswell as a large regulator across the canal head would be required. To guard against the river finding a new channel and deserting the weir large training embankments would be needed, or the weir should be placed where the configuration of the ground made it impossible for the river to break away. The temporary weirs now made are swept away when the river comes down in flood, and thus the supply in the canalised arm or branch of the river does not become excessive for long. • ^ .* t l..’i l Such massive works once constructed vrould leave their traces for all time in a' country where the people never trouble themselves to destroy works and where the climate is not destructive. But no traces at all of such works can be found by searching, nor can the people, who are very observant and take a keen and intelligent interest in old ruins, point out anything that would lead one to suppose a permanent weir had ever been built.. If a weir large enough to control the Helmand had ever been built,; the people would have followed up this ex perience by building other regulators on their irrigation Systems, but the fewbridges, outlets and regulators that have been found are very very small purely local works, evidently built by some private individual and not large public works. With the single exception of the heavy arched bridge {takhta pul) near Karku t We could neither hear of or find the ruins referred to on page 410 of Perrier’s Caravan Journeys, and seen by Lieute nant Pattinson and General Pollock—see footnote to page 278 of Rawlinson’s Notes on Seistan, Royal Geographical Society,328 [Chap. LI. Shah which was probably never anything more than a bridge, and is a clumsy massive structure shewing no scientific knowledge oi bridge building. Sir William'Willcocks in his lectures at Cairo on the irrigation works of Mesopotamia has pointed* out how the Comparison between the delta irrigation works basin System of irrigation in Egypt COuld of Seistan, Mesopotamia and Egypt. ^ ^ ^ ^ with(?ut any b J g w?rbSj b ut the perennial system of irrigation in Mesopotamia required massive irrigation works. For basin irrigation was impossible in Mesopotamia, because, the floods are in the spring and are followed by hot dry weather when the failing resources of the river are wasted by evaporation ; therefore it was necessary to have the weirs and regulators which he says are a striking feature among the ruins in Mesopota mia to force the water at low river over the land. The circumstances of Seistan are exactly similar to those of Mesopotamia, yet there are no remains of massive works of control to be found anywhere among the extensive ruins scattered over every delta. It would seem that in Mesopotamia the people endeavoured to obtain a good autumn crop as well as a spring crop, whereas in Seistan they must always have been content, as they are now, with an autumn harvest of low class crops on the canalised portions of the river that could be matured without massive masonry works, and only grew high class crops near the main stream as is done now* in the Miankangi. It is inconceivable that in the past the people of Seistan did not know of Reflection that the ancients did not consider the works of Mesopotamia; the great masonry works of control necessary in Seistan. Naushirwan is Said by local tradition to have dug the Zorkan and Zarkan canals ; and Dik-i-Dila. where some traditions place their head is said to be named after his local representative. The present Bandbaf believe that their ancestors were taught by a Turkish expert; if so, he probably came from Mesopotamia; this was in comparatively recent times, when the connection between Seistan and the Turkish province of Mesopotamia was very much less than it was in the days when the masonry weirs in Seistan are said to have been built. It would therefore seem that the men in whose time the great masonry works of control in Mesopotamia were conceived realized that such works were not required in Seistan. The destruction of the Band-i-Seistan is often referred to both in tradition The probable meaning of tradition in saying the and in history, and seeing that there is not band was destroyed. a ves bge of a brick of these works that can be pointed out in a land where mud ruins have survived from the most ancient times, and pottery and stone implements from the earlier ages of man, it is worth reflection that the vandals spoken of in history and tra dition could effectually destroy the prosperity of the cultivated tract of their day by diverting the Helmand river down to the then deserted delta, a work requiring little labour or skill. More especially since the cultivation had been long sustain ed in its own delta (the long period of prosperity that provided the wealth that tempted the invader to the land) the people were almost certainly maintaining earthworks to keep the river in its course ; and the vandal had only to cut a few embankments and let the flood waters rush down a steep channel from which it was beyond the power of a beaten and defeated community to again divert the river and recover the water for their landsf. To effectually destroy a masonry weir on such a big river as the Helmand would be a work of great labour. * His words are graphic. ' The basin system of irrigation could defy time and even neglect. It was on this account that it survived every revolution and every trouble of many thousand years, while its rival the perennial irrigation of the Euphrates valley, fell utterly into ruin and decay, such a system needs perpetual and constant attention. ,, ^ f In this connection read Istakhris account of the destruction of the prosperity of one of the deltas that occurred before the Arab Conquest (A. H. 30) given on page 283 of Rawlinson’s Notes on Seistan. The words used are—' but owing- to the bursting of the dyke in the Helmand, the water of this canal was lowered and cut off from it, so that its orosneritv diminished, and the inhabitants removed from it and built Zaranj.” These words would better suit a breach in the protec tion embankment, such as that which occurred at Shahgul in 1896, than one in a masonry weir, and this from what we now know of the system of irrigation in this delta is probably what was meant. nai We C0W It js also useful to note that Istakhri wrote of a tradition.INI)!
