P. 4t)40/-^. MUSCAT : 1908 1928. I.—Administration. 1. Ilis Highness Saiyid Taimnr bin Faisal bin Turki, K.C.I.F. (192G), C.S. 1. (1917), Sultan of Muscat and Oman, born in 1885, succeeded his father, Sultan Saiyid Faisal-bin-Turki, G.O.I.E., who had ruled the Sultanate since 1888, in 1918. He has three sons, of whom the eldest, Saiyid Said, is being educated at an Arab school in Baghdad. His Highness, who is entitled to a salute of 21 guns, represented his father at the Delhi Durbar, 1902—3, and visited England in the summer of 1928, when he was received in audience by the King, and entertained as a State guest for a period of a month. 2. The Sultan is an independent potentate who has commercial treaties with the Governments of France (1844) and the United States (1833), as w r ell as with His Majesty’s Government. There is in addition a commercial declaration of 1877 with the Dutch Government. Under the Anglo-French declaration of 18G2, His Majesty’s Government and the French Government engage reciprocally to respect the independence of ihe Sultan of Muscat (as of the Sultan of Zanzibar). Under his treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government, a precis of which is contained in the memorandum printed as an Appendix on page {9, the Sultan is pledged never to cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation, his dominions, save to His Majesty’s Government, to whom, in addition, the right to search and seize Muscat ships suspected of carrying slaves was ceded in 1373, as was the right (simultaneously ceded to Persia) to search Muscat vessels tor arms in Muscat waters in 1898. The right to search Muscat vessels for arms on the high seas was ceded to His Majesty’s Government and the Italian Government in 1903. His Highness has further undertaken not to grant oil concessions without the approval of His Majesty’s Government. While, however, the Sultan is in theory a wholly independent ruler, since the end of the eighteenth century British influence has been predominant in Muscat, and in practice the relations which obtain between its ruler and His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India very closely approximate to those which obtain between the Government of India and an Indian State under the suzerainty of His Majesty. 3. The internal administration of Muscat is carried out by an Advisory Council of Ministers (President, Minister of Finance, Minister of Religious Affairs, Minister of Justice), 3 purely Arab with the exception noted below, presided over b\ r His Highness’s brother, Saiyid Nadir.t The Council, which the Sultan was required to institute in 1920 as a condition of the assistance of His Majesty’s Government in the reconstruction of his adminis tration and in negotiations with the rebel Omani tribes (see para. 35), is entitled to a salute of 17 guns, individual members receiving five and the President nine, or 13 if a member of the ruling House. In theory it exercises all ordinary powers of administration, not only during the absence, but during the presence of the Sultan at Muscat, subject to the retention by His Highness of power to decide all matters of extraordinary importance affecting the interests of his State or his dynasty4 It does not, however, appear in the past to have exercised in practice a very effective control. At the request of the Sultan, an Englishman, Mr. B. S. Thomas, O.B.E., formerly assistant British representative in Trans-Jordan,§ was appointed in 1925 as Financial Adviser. In 192G Mr. Thomas was appointed VVazir and a member of the Muscat Council, functioning as Finance Minister, but having also a full share in the government of the State. The result has been a marked improvement in the general level of efficiency of administration. 4. His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India are represented in Muscat by the Political Agent, who is an officer of the Indian Political Department, on the cadre of which the appointment is borne.

The limits of the Order are co-extensive with the territories and territorial waters of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. t Lor. i, 499-500, 512-3. § Sir D.

A'o specific reference was made to Muscat in the Report of the Masterton-Smith Committee, and while, under the general principle embodied in that Committee, matters of political significance on the north Arabian littoral which may affect relations with Ibn Saud fall to be dealt with by or in consultation with the Colonial Office, such matters rarely, if at all, arise in Muscat, and political control may in consequence be regarded as resting, as in the pre-war period, with the Government of India, subject to the general control of His Majesty’s Government. Under the principles embodied in the Masterton-Smith Report, the internal affairs of the State are in any event the direct concern of the Government of India. 6. With the inconsiderable exception referred to below, expenditure in Muscat is wholly borne by Indian revenues. That expenditure consists of subsidies to the Sultan, of Durbar presents, and of the cost of maintaining the Political Agency. The subsidies consist of an annual sum of Rs. 86,400 representing the $40,000 payable by Zanzibar to Muscat under the Canning award of 1861 (liability for this payment was assumed by His Majesty’s Government in 18/1, and has since 1st September 1883 been wholly an Indian charge),J and of the annual subsidy of Rs. 1 lakh paid since 1912 (see paras. 12 and 22 below) in compensation for the losses to the Sultan arising out of the suppression of the arms traffic, which will cease with the tenuie of power b&gt; the present Sultan. Ihese charges are fixed, and their amount cloes ^ ^ary. In the latest year for which authoritative figures are available (1.)1J- 0) the cost of the Political Agency was Rs. 78,427, and in the same year Durbar presents amounted to Rs. 5,000.§ The solitary item of expenditure shared with His Majesty’s Government is a yearly payment in ic&amp;peet of anti-slavery measures, the amount of which in 15126 was Rs. 73 -xcmjo lu uctooer 1913 uiuuui raisai. 6.

P ’ Xtept to Indla au(l p ersia, were still unprohibited8. The result was to make Muscat the recognised centre of the trade in arms for the whole Middle East. At the beginning of the period now in question, the main channel of distribution was from Muscat across the Gulf to the coast of Persian Makran, whence arms were taken up country by caravans, ultimately reaching the tribesmen of Afghanistan and the North- West Frontier of India. From 1910-11, the stringency of the prohibitive measures imposed by His Majesty’s Government led to the adoption, in preference, of smuggling to El Katr. on the Arabian coast, then still under Turkish control, and thence across the Gulf to the Persian coast of Laristan. 9. The constant flow of modern arms of precision from Muscat to the North-West Frontier of India created a very serious situation for the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government. The situation was one which could be dealt with adequately only by the suppression of the free trade in arms at Muscat. The fact that the Sultan had commercial treaties not only with His Majesty’s Government, but with the United States of America and France, which expressly provided for the unrestricted import and export of all kinds of merchandise (with certain specified exceptions) ; that he had further a commercial declaration which provided for reciprocal most-favoured-nation treatment between Muscat and Holland ; that a large part of the trade in arms was in the hands of certain French firms with considerable political influence in the Chamber ; and that the French Government, unlike the Governments of the United States of America and Holland, was not prepared to sacrifice its treaty rights provided other Treaty .Powers did the same, made it extremely difficult to take effective steps to this end. 10. The efforts made by His Majesty's Government to provide a quid pro quo acceptable to the French Government having failed, steps vvere taken, in the light of a reiteration at the Brussels Arms Conference of 190S-9 of the refusal of France to modify her attitude, to suppress the traffic so far as was practicable without the violation of existing treaty rights. Towards the end of 1909 a naval blockade was instituted, which was still in being on the outbreak of the War in 1914, but which, though it met with very considerable success, proved extremely costly. Between 1910 and 191^ further lengthy negotiations took place in consequence with the French Government and with the Sultan. The Sultan, who saw' in the suppression of the traffic not merely a possible occasion of immediate compensation from His Majesty’s Government, but the closing of the most convenient source from which the rebellious tribes in the interior of Oman could arm themselves against him, was generally amenable, though in 1911-12 his financial difficulties, which delivered him into the hands of the arms dealers,* led him for a time to change from an attitude of neutrality towards the trade, to active, if surreptitious, participation in it. The French Government, however, remained unyielding, and in view of the complete failure of the negotiations with them, it was decided to disregard France, and to endeavour to concert with the Sultan of Muscat some local arrangements for a satisfactory control of the trade.! 11. It is unnecessary to recapitulate the various incidents which took place in connection with the suppression of the traffic between 1910 and 1912, or to enter into details of the discussions which took place during that period with the Sultan and with France. Suffice it to say that, after lengthy negotiation, an arrangement was finally reached with His Highness in May 1912. Under this the Sultan agreed to establish at Muscat a bonded warehouse under sufficient control, in which all arms and ammunition would be deposited on importation, the warehouse to be in charge of a trustworthy person from among bis subjects. All issues from the warehouse would be regulated by special licences prepared by the Superintendent and counter signed by the Sultan personally, and such licences would be issued ouly to individual purchasers or their authorised agents subject to satisfactory proof that the issue involved was “ free from justifiable objection.” Licences would not be issuable to traders. 12. The terms on which the Sultan agreed to this settlement were as follows. He was to receive as compensation an immediate lump sum I.O. Memo. B. 175, 182, 196. * Cj&gt;. tel. from Viceroy to S. of S. for I., Jan. 14 1911, P. 171, P. 200. t I.O. to F.O , July 19 1911.I payment of 1 lakh of rupees, together with 1 lakh of rupees per annum in\the future, paid monthly in advance. In addition he was to receive compensation for certain specific losses in 1909 and 1911. The Sultan was further guaranteed that Ilis Majesty’s Government would give him all the necessarv support to dispose of objections that might ensue from France or other Powers; that no right was given by the arrangement to His Majesty’s Government or their officials to take action in his territories any more than in the past; and that a friendly understanding should be reached with him by His Majesty’s Government as to suitable arrangements for the supply of the bond fide needs of his administration and his subjects. 13. The arrangement, which was to come into force, after three months’ notice, on the 1st September 1912, was published on the 4th June 1912, came into operation on the appointed date, and was subsequently maintained with complete success. 14. Very serious difficulty immediately arose with the French Government, which expressed its readiness to approve the regulations only subject to the compensation of the French merchants, who had hitherto played a consider able part in the arms trade. Compensation to French interests would have meant compensation to the other interests—Muscat, British, German, Belgian—affected, and the objections to it from the standpoint of His Majesty’s Government were overwhelming. The fact that England, while a joint guarantor with France of Muscat independence under the Agreement with France of 1862, was not a party to the French Treaty of 1844 with Muscat, under which the arms trade was permissible, further complicated the issue. 15. His Majesty’s Government, however, made it clear to the French Government on the 14th September 1912, that they were firmly determined to support the Sultan in maintaining the regulations, which, they stated, in their view did not infringe French treaty rights, but merely regulated a dangerous trade, a right enjoyed by every Government. They added that, while compensation without arbitration could not be admitted, as His Majesty’s Government did not recognise that French rights were infringed, they were prepared to submit the question to arbitration. 16. After lengthy and difficult negotiations, which lasted until the early part of 1914, the French Government agreed 0 to Vecognise the regulations in force at Muscat, and the right of the Sultan to amend those regulations with the concurrence of Ilis Majesty’s Government, if His Majesty’s Government, in direct negotiation with the French trade interests affected, could arrive at an agreement as to the terms on which those interests should t P. 5179 / 13 . be bought out. An agreement having been reached,! under which £‘64,495 was paid by His Majesty’s Government to the interested firms, an exchange of notes took place on 4th February 1914, by the settlement embodied in which the French Government undertook “no longer to claim for their nationals the privileges and immunities secured under the Treaty between 4ranee and Muscat of 1844, in so far as those privileges and immunities conflict with the regulations for the prevention of the illicit trade in arms and ammunition in the Sultanate. In other respects the Treaty of 1844 remains in force.” The expenditure involved was divided equally between Indian and Imperial revenues.^ It was decided that no compensation should be paid to British firms affected. 17. V\ hile a continual vigilance is called for, the steps taken to put § Report of Arms a sto P arms traffic from Muscat, as described above, have been ^, c —completely successful.

(c/. para. 52), Muscat had entirely fallen out of the arms traffic ; and the fact that under the post-war Arms Traffic Convention, to which the Sultan has adhered at the request of Ilis Majesty’s Government,^ Arabia had been made a prohibited area for the import or export of arms, has for practical purposes disposed of the probability of the recurrence in present circumstances of international difficulties.

Of these subsidies the Zanzibar subsidy was one the precise conditions antecedent to the grant of which are a matter of some dispute.fi ^ C f. Lor i P 500 It would, however, appear that those conditions are that a Sultan should be footnote. ' ' 3 ’ acknowledged by His Majesty’s Government and should promise friendship and the maintenance of his treaty obligations, and that subject to this he might prefei an absolute claim. I he arms traffic suosidy of Its. 1 lakh per annum had, however, been personal to Sultan Feisal, and, while it was essential that the new ruler should afford the co-operation in the suppression of the trade 10 secure which it had been granted, he could prefer no claim to it as •of right. LM. After lengthy discussion between the Government of India, the India Office and the Foreign Office, it was finally decided that the Sultan should pending further examination on two connected questions—the assent of His Highness to the establishment of a Muscat Levy Corps, and his agreement to conclude no further treaties with foreign Powers without the consent of His Majesty’s Government. The second of these questions was one which had arisen towards the close of the reign of Sultan Faisalff, the disposal of which presented political difficulties owing to the position of France vis-d-vis the State, and which was still under examination when the outbreak of the Luropean War in August 1914 made its immediate pursuit unnecessary. It has not been revived. For various reasons the proposal to raise a Muscat Levy Corps (to which the Foreign Office saw no political objection in 1914§§ so long as the force was nominally a Muscat force and commanded by officers nominally in the service of the Sultan) produced no result until 1921 (see para. 31). 22. The arms traffic subsidy was renewed without a very clear definition -of the terms of its renewal, though the intention both of His Majesty’s ** I.O. to F.O., Deo. 31 1912; tel. to Vicerov.

In this decision His Highness reluctantlj acquiesced. 23. The dominating position in Muscat throughout the war was the rebellion of the Omani tribes, which Sultan lannur inherited as a legae\ from his predecessor, which he found himself unable to quell on his accession, and the history of which is separately dealt with in paras. 43 to o of tins Memorandum. The pre-occupation of the State with this pioblem absoibed its energies during the War period, while its relative remoteness from the politics of Central Arabia resulted in its isolation from the disputes oi I bn Sand and Ihn Rashid, and from the development of events alike at the head of the Gulf and on the coast of the Red Sea. 24. It is unnecessary to enter in any detail into the internal ailairs ol Muscat (as distinct from the Omani rebellion) in the early years of the war. The control of the arms traffic, itself no inconsiderable element in that rebellion, was on the whole satisfactorily maintained. Hut the Sultan retained Ins throne thanks onlv to the actixe militaiy assistance and suppoit of His Majesty's Government, a support not extended to the administration of his State until 1918; his administration, never distinguished, became hopelessly corrupt; while His Highness’s financial position, as the result of the inefficiency of his servants, the demands of the campaign against the Omanis, and the loss of revenue involved in the Omani rebellion, gradually deteriorated until in 1918 it could he described as desperate.'j' 25. The Government of India and His Majesty’s Government, committed by their undertakings of 1895 and 1913 to secure the safety of the coast towns of Muscat and Muttrah (cp. para. 45), in the early part of the war confined their action to implementing these undertakings with some generosity of interpretation, and abstained from interference in the internal policy of the State. But the inefficiency of the internal administration, the action taken at the behests of His Majesty’s Government by the Sultan and his predecessor, and the Omani rebellion were closely interwoven ; the strategic position of Muscat, athwart the main route to the headwaters of the Gulf and to Mesopotamia, was of vital interest; the nominal independence of the Sultan rendered his situation of more than local importance, and in 1917 the then Political Agent, Major Haworth, submitted for consideration a programme the acceptance of which would involve active interference in the internal affairs of Muscat by the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government. 20. The proposals of the Political Agent were that a levy corps should lie established under British officers ; that a loan should he granted the Sultan sufficient to rid him of his liabilities; and that as a condition of the loan 11 is Highness should agree to the transfer to British control of the Muscat customs, to the appointment of a British adviser and to the establishment of an educational system the ultimate result of which would be the provision of a nucleus of Muscat subjects educationally qualified for employment in the local administration, which had hitherto been wholly dependent on alien talent. 27. Major Haworth’s proposals necessitated careful consideration in the light of the Declaration of 18G2, under which His Majesty’s Government had become a joint guarantor with France of the independence of Muscat A further difficulty was the uncertainty as to the authority with which respon sibility i or Muscat affairs would rest after the war, and the reluctance of the Government of India to initiate a policy the development of which was unlikely to rest with them. But circumstances forced the pace : negotiations with the Omani rebels m the spring of 1918 were unproductive, the financial7 situation became, if possible, more critical; the reactions of maladministration at home, alike on the financial situation and on relations with the tribes of the interior, became increasingly apparent; and in August 1918 the Government of India, after further discussion with Sir Percy Cox and Major Haworth, expressed to the Secretary of State for India the view that action could not be postponed indefinitely, and submitted proposals to meet the situation. 28. The Government of India suggested the offer to the Sultan of a loan of Rs. lakhs at 6 per cent, interest to be paid off in 10 years and to be secured on the Muscat customs ; the loan to be conditional on agreement by His Highness to undertake a definite programme of reform which would result in financial reorganisation and the improvement of the administration of justice. The Foreign Office did not consider' ::: ' that the proposed loan could afford any ground for legitimate protest 1o the French Government, to whom no reference was accordingly made by His Majesty’s Government, and it was finally sanctioned by the Secretary of State for India on 4th December 1918.1 It was borne wholly by Indian revenues, the Treasury refusing to contribute. J 29. The programme of reform accepted by the Sultan as a condition of the loan covered the following points :— (1) Appointment by His Highness of an Indian, to be selected by His Majesty’s Government, as Customs Director, who would in the first instance reorganise existing customs posts, and subsequently extend a customs system to all ports in Oman. (2) Fixation of amount of Privy Purse, remainder of State income being appropriated to charges of administration and payment of instalments and interest of loan. (3) Appointment of a Wazir or Dewan to conduct Courts of Justice and control proceedings of local governors of districts. (4) Improvement of roads, establishment of schools, &amp;c. (5) Reorganisation of Sultan’s guard with a view to its eventual use as nucleus for a levy corps. 30. Considerable discussion took place regarding these conditions in the. .early part of 1919, Sir Arnold Wilson, then Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, feeling serious doubt as to whether they did not at once constitute too heavy .a commitment on the part of His Majesty’s Government, and traverse the principles of self-determination embodied in the post-war policy of the Allies. They were, however, ultimately substantially accepted by the authorities •concerned, and were put into operation during 1919. It may be recorded for •convenience at this point that the Commercial Treaty of 1891, which had been renewed for five years in 1914, was extended for one year in 1919, and has been extended yearly since that date. 31. An additional loan of Rs. 1 lakh, borne, like the original loan, by Indian revenues, was sanctioned by the Secretary of State for India in February 1920, raising the total of the advance to Rs. (U- lakhs, repayment of which was to be made in 19 equal half-yearly instalments of Rs. 46.740. 5.§ 32. The very considerable degree of indirect control represented by the measures described in para. 29 was justified from the point of view of Muscat by their results. By the beginning of 1920 the Sultan’s debts had been discharged with the assistance of the additional loan ; steps had been taken to introduce financial order; the result of the appointment on 1st October 1919 of three trained Egyptian customs officials to reorganise the customs, which provided the major part of the revenue of the State, was seen in a balance in the Treasury on 1st October 1920 of Rs. 3J lakhs, !| and a regular Court of Law, though with less immediately satisfactory results, had also been established. In addition, a European Wazir (Capt. McCollum, formerly Political Agent, Koweit) was employed from January to August 1920, when the reorganisation of the administration referred to in paras. 35-6 below rendered it possible to dispense with his services. Early in 1921, a Muscat levy corps under a British officer, which has since been maintained at a strength varying between 200 and 250, and which is now recruited from the Mai trail coast, made possible the withdrawal of the Indian troops maintained Tel. from Viceroy to S. of S. for I., Aug. 16 1918, P. 3661/18. * F.O. to LO., Nov. 5 1918, P. 4913/18. t Tel. to Viceroy, Dec. 4 1918, P.4913.

Simultaneously with the reorganisation of the internal administration,, the steps referred to in para. 41) below were being taken to bring about a settlement with the Omani tribes. With the attainment of a settlement in September 19:30, the State found itself solvent and in sight of a condition of. political stability such as it had not previously enjoyed. 34. While, however, the active intervention of His Majesty’s Government had secured the results described above in the affairs of the State, the Sultan,, an agreeable but effete and indolent ruler, who had at no stage displayed the qualities of character necessary in the ruler of Oman, saw in the new dispensation an opportunity to divest himself of his nominal responsibilities, and in March 1920, in a private interview with the Viceroy, expressed his desire to abdicate and to reside permanently in India. 35. Other considerations apart, the facts that the tribal situation was still critical, that there was no obvious successor, and that the succession was a matter of more than local interest in view of the Sultan’s international treaties, rendered the proposal inopportune. Lord Chelmsford declined to countenance it, and His Highness was required to return to Muscat on the conclusion of his visit. But the Sultan was in name at least independent; his reluctant co-operation might do more harm than good, and a compromise, which by reducing Flis Highness’s interference with the administration might simplify the task of reorganisation, was not altogether without advantage. As a result, the Omani tribes having in the autumn of 1920 asked that negotiations might be reopened, the Political Agent, after personal consulta tion with the Government of India, was authorised to inform the Sultan that His Majesty’s Government were willing to assist him in the continued reconstruction of his finances and in his negotiations with the rebels on the following conditions :— (a) That if he persisted in his wish to live away from his State as much as possible, he should spend not less than five months every year continuously at Muscat. That he should authorise the constitution of a regular Advisory Council, purely Arab in composition, to exercise all the ordinary powers of administration, not only during his absence, but during the periods of his presence at Muscat. (c) That he should retain the power to decide all matters of extraordinary importance affecting the interests of his State or his dynasty. (d) That should he at any time change his mind and decide to live permanently at Muscat, these arrangements should be cancelled, and he should resume all powers of administration, subject to the conditions of the loan made to him by His Majesty’s Government (see para. 28 above). (b) 33. After lengthy discussions these conditions were accepted by His Highness subject to the reduction of the period of his obligatory annual residence at Muscat and to the fixation of his privy purse at Ps. 10,000 per mensem. The Government of India agreed to modify their requirements; the period of residence was fixed at four months and subsequently reduced to three ; and approval was given to a privy purse of Rs. 10,000 per mensem subject to Ilis Ilighness’s continued good behaviour and to the continued ability of the State finances to bear the strain. An arrangement on these lines has since been in operation. Pol. A Kent to Pol. Ues., Sept. 31 1923, P. 3895/23 ; Pol. Res. to 6. of I., Dec. 22 1923, P. 467/24 ; July 20 1924, P. 4288/24. 37. The financial position gave ground for increasing uneasiness in 1923 and 1924. Trade depression had reacted on the customs revenue; the Egyptian customs officials had not proved an unqualified success—one had been dismissed while another had resigned ; efforts at retrenchment, and the imposition of certain minor taxes, produced no substantial result. A large increase in revenue could be secured only by an increase in the customs duty from 5 per cent, to 10 per cent., and the existence of treaties between Muscat and France and the F.S.A., fixing that duty at 5 per cent., made action on these lines difficult.38. The Government of India endeavoured to meet the situation, to the seriousness of which the Sultan was fully alive, by lending for four months a highly qualified European customs official, Mr. Bower, to reorganise the Muscat customs. At the same time, they agreed, at the request of the Sultan, to find a competent Englishman to serve as Financial Adviser, look after the finances of the State, and aid His Highness and the Council with advice. The Arab Advisory Council established in 1920 (see para. 35) had proved of no real assistance—the Sultan in 1924 had complained that they were, “though very worthy persons . . . absolutely useless as administrators, apart from which they would never come to a decision about any matter, even unimportant questions” ; and the Political Resident agreed * Tei. 22 t. from that “the difficulty was to get them to give a decided opinion on any ^ L * subject.P. 2028/24. 39, The post of Financial Adviser was offered to Mr. B.

The improvement referred to above has been secured for rather than by the Sultan, although His Highness has on occasion shown a definite interest in the action taken.ft Sir L.

An absentee Sultan who does not interfere with the Government has its advantages. It has enabled us to make the arrangement by which with a Council and a British Wazir the finances of the State have been put in order, and there is every hope that in a very few years . . . it will commence a new career in flourishing circumstances.

A critical stage has not been reached, although the local Amir of Jaalan has set up an independent customs administration, but the Political Resident apprehends that should the Amir endeavour to throw off his allegiance to the Sultan and establish an independent dominion similar to that of the Omanis of the interior, the very considerable reduction of the Sultan’s dominions and revenues which would §§ Letter 167 s. from, be involved might necessitate active economic pressure by His Majesty s PoL_iLs.^o g. of 1 'Government on the Sur tribes on behalf of His HighneSs.§§ p.

The usurper was overthrown in 1871 by the legitimate branch; but between that date and 1913 numerous attempts were made by the Omam tribes to dethrone the Sultans, whose survival as rulers may iairly be said to have been due solely to the support of His Majesty s Government. Jn the years immediately before the war, tribal feeling was inflamed by the » t©i. from viceroy stoppage of the importation of arms,* 1 ' following on the suppression of the lllmZ 1 ’' slave trade, both of them measures permitted by Islam, at the instigation p. 3134 / 13 . 0 f Christian Powers; a carefully organised conspiracy followed, and m May 1913, in an outburst of religious fanaticism, the Omani tribes arose in t o/. p. 3744 / 16 . rebe]lion.| 45. Reinforcements were despatched by His Majesty s Government in fulfilment of a guarantee given to the Sultan in 1^95, and then communicated to the Sheikhs of Oman, that they would not allow attacks to be made on Muscat or Muttrah whatever differences the Sultan might have with his tribes—a guarantee, the principle of which Avas extended in practice to the ports of the Batinah coast and to Kuryet, which contained resident British subjects. The warning in question was renewed, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government,! but produced no impression on the Omanis, and while in January 1915 the crushing defeat of an attack in force on the British outposts stationed at Bait-el-Falaj for the protection of Muscat and Mattrah taught the tribes their lesson, by 191(3 the rebels had obtained complete control of all Oman proper, and had organised a Government in it; and they remained thereafter in undisputed possession of the interior, and a constant menace to the coast towns. 'These they would probably have taken had it not been for ihe British garrison at Bait-el-Falaj and the knowledge that the arrival of one of His Majesty’s ships would quickly have forced them to relinquish any hold which they might temporarily have established. 4G. Thanks to the efforts of the Political Agent, a conference to consider terms of peace between the Sultan and the Imam of the Omani tribes took place at Sib on the 15th September 1915. It was completely abortive,§ the demands of the Sultan that the Wadi Samail and its forts (captured in August 1913, and essential to the commercial prosperity of Muscat)!! should be returned to him, and his temporal supremacy in Oman recognised, being categorically refused by the Omanis, who demanded on their part that the Sultan should reform his Government according to their ideas, that their financial claims should be settled in full, and that the free purchase of arms and ammunition should be allowed. No reconciliation proved possible, and the negotiations were broken off. Political Report to Pol. Res.. May 9 1917, P. 370/18.

From the further steps were taken towards a settlement until March 1918. The Imam consolidated his power in the interior, while the Sultan’s Government according to the Political Agent, “became involved in hopeless debt ami reached an unparalleled degree of ineptitude.” 48. Further abortive negotiations took place in March 1918 but there was no substantial advance until the following year. At the beginning of11 OLD ( see paras. 29-30) the necessity of taking drastic measures to preserve the Sultan’s Government on the coast from complete collapse was recognised by the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government; a loan from Indian revenues was made to His Highness to enable him to put his house in order internally, and pressure was put on the Omani tribes through the Political Agent with a view to securing a settlement between them and the Sultan. After much correspondence, the Imam was persuaded to resume negotiations, and a meeting took place between him and the Political Agent at Sib on the J5th September 1919.* 49. Very great difficulty was experienced in arriving at agreement. It was only after negotiations had been broken off, and definite action taken to show not only that the support of the Sultan by His Majesty’s Government was a reality, but that the Sultan was in a position to retaliate effectively on the Omanis by the taxing of their produce when it came down to the coast for export, that any advance was secured. A British Adviser was appointed to the State,! a British warship, which actually inflicted punish ment at MasnaalnJ was despatched to support the Sultan’s authority on the coast, and prohibitive duties were imposed on Omani produce, with the result that in July 1920 the Imam was murdered by his tribes,$ and that on 25th September 1920, after considerable furtner negotiation, agreement was reached between the conflicting parties. || 50. Under the terms of settlement, the Sultan undertook^ not to interfere in the “ internal affairs ” of Oman (no formal admission of Omani indepen dence being given); not to impose taxation in excess of 5 per cent, on commodities brought into the coast towns from Oman ; to allow members of the tribes to enter and leave Muscat and the coast towns in safety and freedom ; and to return fugitive criminals on demand. 51. The tribes, on the other hand, contracted to remain in peace and amity with the Sultan’s Government, with which they were not to interfere; not to attack the coast towns ; to impose no restrictions on trade : to under take that travellers to Oman on their lawful business should be free and safe; to turn out fugitive criminals and evil-doers; and to dispose of the claims of merchants and others against them according to the Sharah law. 52. The agreement, which, as will be seen, involves recognition by the Sultan of the practical independence of the Omani tribes, has, on the whole, worked well since 1920. Action had to be taken in 1922 by His Majesty’s ships in support of the Muscat Government against one of the Omani tribes (the Yal Saad, on the Batineh coast),** but, broadly speaking, the situation has stabilised itself, and the Omani tribes, while they would no doubt constitute an immediate menace were the support of His Majesty’s Govern ment withdrawn, have ceased, at any rate temporarily, to interfere with and harass the Sultan’s Government. V.—Foreign Relations of Muscat, 1908-1928. 53. During the first part of the period now under consideration, the existence of treaty relations between France and Muscat was, as will be seen from paras. 7-lfi above, of the first importance from the standpoint of His Majesty’s Government in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic. It is unnecessary to enter into the details of the relations between the two countries, since the substantial consideration which led to French interest in Muscat disappeared with the amicable settlement reached between His Majesty’s Government and the French Government on the suppression of the arms traffic in February 1914. But the settlement in question did not involve the abrogation of the French Treaty with Muscat of 1844, or of the Anglo-French Declaration of 18(52, and the continued existence of these instruments is of sufficient importance in present circumstances to call for brief notice in this Memorandum. 54. As will be seen from the precis of the Muscat Treaties referred to in para. 2 above, the Sultan of Muscat has a Commercial Treaty with France dating from 1844.

While the agreement concluded by the Sultan with Her Majesty’s Government in 1891, under which he pledged himself and his successors never to cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give for occupation, save to Her Majesty’s Government, the dominions of Muscat and Oman or any of their dependencies, represents a substantial departure from the spirit of the Declaration of 1862, that Declaration remained and remains binding, and an assurance that His Majesty’s Government recognised it as such was formally given to France in September 1913.' ::&gt; Its existence, taken with the existence of the Treaty of 1814, was responsible for the difficulty which arose with France in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic between 1910 and 1914, and it is not only clear that it precludes the establishment by His Majesty’s Government of a formal protectorate over Muscat, but in view' of the action taken under its terms vis-d-vis France at Dander Gisseh in 1899, it seems probable that it constitutes a definite impediment even to the acquisition by His Majesty’s Government of the lease, e.g. for use as a naval base, of any portion of Muscat territory. This latter difficulty is of importance at the present time in view r of the revival by the Political Resident of the proposal for the establishment of a British naval base at Khassab in the Musandim Peninsula (see paras. 65 to 71 below). 55. It is unnecessary to enter into the history of the efforts made between 1910 and 1914, in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic, to secure French concurrence in the abrogation of the Declaration of 1862 and possibly of the Treaty of 1844. Suffice it to say that it proved impracticable to arrive at an agreement which could be confined to Muscat, or even to Muscat and the French possessions in India! ; that France w r as not prepared to cede her rights in return for territorial acquisitions in India alonej ; that the Government of India were reluctant to agree to any cession of Indian territory, save in return for a corresponding acquisition of French territory in India (Chandernagore and the Loges) ; and that proposals of compensation in other parts of the world by the cession of Gambia, the rectification of the Desert Boundary between the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and French Equatorial Africa, or by the grant to the French Government of certain concessions in North Africa, came to nothing. 56. The position, therefore, is that French rights persist in their entirety. On the other hand, for the last 14 years no matter of dispute between the French Government and His Majesty’s Government has arisen in Muscat; the Muscat dhows flying the French flag had fallen by 1920 to seven, of which two only belonged to French subjects§ ; and French interests in the affairs of the Sultanate has shown a progressive decrease, although a Consulate is still maintained by France. In 1920-1 the French Government relinquished the coal depot at Mokalla,!| which had been granted them at the time of the Bander Gisseh incident of 1899 dealt with in Mr. Parker’s memorandum, and in 1928 the Political Resident^ stated that he gathered from the French Consul (at Bushire?) that “ France now takes very little interest in Muscat and is now considering closing down permanently the Consulate, wdiich has not been held by any incumbent for some years.” 57. While, however, France may no longer actively concern herself with Muscat affairs, so long as the engagements referred to in para. 54 remain in being His Majesty’s Government cannot be regarded as free agents in respect of Muscat, even though practical control may rest with them and all external expenditure on the State be financed by them. On a broad view, the interests of His Majesty’s Government would probably best be served by the abrogation of both instruments, and it is possible that, at some later stage, if French interest in Muscat diminishes to vanishing point, the French Government might be willing to consider the extinction of their rights as part of an arrangement which would also dispose of the long-standing question of the French Loges in India itself, wdthout demanding an unreasonable quid pro quo. But it cannot be overlooked that the 1862 Declaration, inconvenient as it maj 7 be in certain ways to His Majesty’s Government, is of value as constituting a certain check on designs on Muscat by other Powers, krom a different standpoint, its existence, taken with thatof the Treaty of 1814, is an assurance to the Sultan, the value of which was certainly fully appreciated by his predecessor, that he will not suffer the fate of Zanzibar. 58. The United States of America, despite their Treaty of 1833 with Muscat, appear in practice to have no relations of any importance with that State, their interests in which are now entrusted to His Majesty’s Government.* No question affecting these relations arose during the period now under consideration. Here, however, as in the case of France, the guarantees embodied in the Treaty of 1833 would make it impossible for the Sultan to increase his customs duty (the most important method of raising revenue at his disposal) without the prior concurrence of the United States Government (cp. para. 37 above). 59. No question affecting the relations between the Sultan and the Dutch Government arose during the period in question, and those relations appear, as in the case of the United States Government, to be entirely unimportant. Under the Commercial Declaration of 1877 Holland is, however, entitled to most-favoured-nation treatment, and so would be affected by any modification of the customs duties. CO. The possibility of the development of a German interest in Muscat was of interest to His Majesty’s Government in the years before the war. The present Sultan was informed in 1913 that His Majesty’s Government could not agree to direct correspondence between him and the German Consul, a practice contrary to the practice of Sultan Faisal, who had referred to His Majesty’s Government matters affecting Powers unrepresented at Muscat.| The danger of the acquisition by Germany of a foothold in Muscat through the grant to Muscat is of German certificates of nationality, was prominently before His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India in 1914. To prevent the establishment of a precedent which could be quoted by Germany, arrangements were made that the British flag should not be granted to Muscat subjects in British East Africa unless a “no objection’’certificate had first been secured from the Sultan through the Political Agent,J and the question of securing the Sultan’s approval to an edict which would have made his personal consent a condition of the transfer of allegiance by an Omani to a foreign State was under consideration at the outbreak of the war.§ The difficulty which would be presented by a German request to the signatories of the Joint Declaration of 1862 for their concurrence in the conclusion of a direct German Commercial Treaty with Muscat (on the basis of which a political connection could be developed), were brought to the attention of Government bv the Political Resident in July 1914.' Relations between Muscat and Persia. 61. No question of importance as between Persia and Muscat has arisen during the period now in question. It may be recorded that in the autumn of 1914, on the request of the Persian Government, the Political Agent was instructed to exercise his good offices on behalf of Persian subjects in Muscat should an appeal be made to him, and in all serious cases of hardship and oppression.^ The report recently received from Sir Lionel Haworth that instructions had been issued by the Persian Government to the Governor of Bushire that Persia can recognise no rulers on the Arab coast of the Gulf, and that persons belonging to and arriving from Muscat (as from the other principalities on the Arab littoral) are to be considered Persian subjects, and Persian passports issued to them, necessitates, however, a brief reference to the possible basis of a Persian claim to suzerainty over Muscat. 8o far as can be traced, the only two incidents in the past on which any such claim could be based are the fact that for a few months in 1623 Persia occupied Sohar and Khor Fakkan and that from 1737 until her expulsion in 1744 she was in occupation of Muscat. It is impossible as yet to estimate the importance which should be attached to the report referred to above, of which no confirmation is available from other sources.

No opinion on the matter has been expressed by the Government of India. But, as in the case of Khassab and the Musandim Promontory (para. 71 above), the extent to which His Majesty’s Government are free agents visa-vis France would need very careful examination before a decision could be taken even were the proposal held to be free from objection on other grounds.

The Sultan undertook in February 1923 not to exploit any oil which might be found in his territories, or to grant permission for its exploitation, without prior consultation with the Political Agent, and the approval of the Government of India. An oil concession was secured from His Highness, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1925. (The general question of oil in the Gulf is dealt with in the Memorandum by the Board of 'trade on p. ^|.) VII.—Summary. 76. The last 20 years have seen the practical elimination of French influence in Muscat and the consolidation of the influence of His Majesty’s Government. Despite the fact that the Sultanate is independent, a very close degree of indirect control has been established ; the succession has been regulated ; the customs administration has been brought under the management of officials recommended by the Government of India, a European adviser, a servant indeed of the Sultan, but recommended and selected by the Government of India, and working in close and friendly co-operation with the Political Agent, is the mainspring of the adminis tration; the arms traffic has disappeared, and, thanks to the active intervention, both political and otherwise, of His Majesty’s Government, a working arrangement has been reached with the rebellious tribes of the interior of Oman. The main difficulties which at the moment conliont the State are the instability of the Sultan’s character, and the possibility that before a suitable successor is available he may renew his desire to abdicate; the financial situation, which is complicated by the need for expenditure on essential improvements, the lact that the main source ol additional revenue—increase of customs duties cannot without great difficulty be tapped, and the necessity of repayment to the Government of India of the balance of the loan made to the State in 1919 : and the problem, the importance of which cannot at this stage be appraised, but which may not prove to be serious, of the attitude of the tribes of Sur. 77. The direct intervention in the affairs of Muscat of His Majesty s Government has been very definitely in the interests of the State, and, so far as those interests are concerned, it is desirable that it should be maintained. At the same time, so long as the treaties at present in force between the Sultan and the Governments of France, Holland and the United States continue to subsist, there can be no question of the establishment of a formal protectorate, even should wider objections of principle not be held to militate against the acceptance of such a policy. From the narrower point of view of the interests of His Majesty s Government and the Government of India, there is no less advantage in a maintenance of the status quo, under which control in everything but name rests with 1 lis Majesty’s Government. With the gradual elimination ol British authority from the south Persian coast and with the adoption, for however long it may be maintained, of an active policy in the Gulf by Persia, the strangle hold on the Gulf which the effective control of Muscat constitutes has assumed an importance, more especially in view of British commitments in Iraq, which it did not in the past present. Moreover, not only is effective, if veiled,15 required ” (i.e. at the mouth of the Gulf) “ should not be either at Bunder Abbas or on the adjacent islands, but on the Ras Musandim promontory or the Arabian shore. There would otherwise be risk of our being driven by military force from our necessary naval base. Moreover, the only anchorages which can be trusted are on the Arabian shore.” 67. Almost simultaneously the Political Resident had suggested that it might be desirable to choose Ras Musandim as a site for a lighthouse in preference to Little Quoin,* and the Government of India, in the light of the expression of the views of the Admiralty quoted above, were prepared to agree to the substitution “ apart from the considerarions arising from the Anglo-French Declaration of ]862.”t 68. In April 1913 the Government of India reported that the Director, Royal Indian Marine, saw technical objections to the selection of Musandim as the site for a lighthouse on the grounds that “ thick weather over Musandim is the rule rather than the exception . . . further . . . worst tides experienced anywhere in the Gulf and its approaches are found round Musandim Island.”t 69. In May the Admiralty expressed the view that “ while a naval base on the Musandim Peninsula would theoretically be in a somewhat better strategical position for the control of a railway passing along the northern shore of the entrance to the Gulf, if threatened by a hostile advance from the north-west, practical considerations point rather for the present to the use of Henjam . . . with Basidu as a subsidiary base. It does not appear necessary to contemplate the actual fortification of a naval base in this region so long as we retain the command of the sea in Eastern waters.”§ This disposed of the question of a station on Musandim; and it was agreed that the lighthouse in contemplation should be erected on Little Quoin as being preferable from the strictly navigational standpoint. 70. There appear to have been no developments until in February 1927 the Political Resident|| indicated that Khassab was of value, not merely in connection with the air route, on which it would constitute a jumping off ground for Gwadur on the Makran coast, but for strategical reasons, since “ the country possessing it can practically command egress from and ingress to the Persian Gulf.” Sir L. Haworth therefore favoured the purchase of Khassab from Muscat, possibly for about £12,000, and the establishment of “a Gibraltar at the head of the Gulf.” He regarded this as practicable vis-a-vis France, in view of the right of pre-emption enjoyed by His Majesty’s Government under the Exclusive Agreement of 1891. 71. No views have been expressed on the subject by the Government of India. With the Persian challenge to the position of His Majesty’s Govern ment in Basidu and Henjam the possibility of establishing, if not a fortified base, at any rate a station, in the Musandim Peninsula or on one of the adjoining islands, on two of which (Telegraph Island and Sheep Island) the British Hag has for a short period been hoisted in the past, becomes of more immediate importance. But, financial and strategical considerations apart, the extent to which His Majesty’s Government are free agents vis a-vis France, who, though aware of, is not a party to, and has never formally recognised, the Exclusive Agreement of 1891, will call for careful examina tion before a decision can be taken. (c) The Cession of Gwadur. 72. It was decided in 1863 after exhaustive examination that no attention need or could be paid to the claims to Gwadur, a dependency of Muscat in Makran, on the Persian littoral of the Gulf, of the Khan of Kalat or of the Gitchkis. This decision was reaffirmed by the Government of India in 1928.^f 73. The question of its retransfer to Kalat at a price was raised by the Political Agent, Muscat, in 1921, when the financial situation of Muscat was critical, but the Government of India were instructed** that no overtures should be made to the Sultan of Muscat without prior reference to His Majesty’s Government, and the matter dropped. * Tel. from Pol.

(a) The Muscat Order in Council—1867 and 1915. 63. From 1867 the jurisdiction exercised over British subjects in Muscai by the Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul was exercised under the Muscat Order in Council of I867. ::: ' The revision of this Order, which had become out of date, was raised by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in 1913. His proposals that the revision should be undertaken were accepted by the Government of India! and His Majesty’s Government, and a revised Order in Council in substitution for the Order of 1867 was approved by His Majesty on the 3rd February 1915. The new Order, which came into force on the 1st January 1916,! vests in the Political Agent, subject to the general control of, and right of appeal to, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, jurisdiction over— (a) British subjects, and British ships, with their boats, and persons and property on board, or belonging to them, within the limits of the Order. (b) Muscat subjects registered in the Political Agency as in the regular service of British subjects, subject to a proviso as to the disposal of cases in which such Muscat subjects are concerned. (c) The property, &amp;c., of all British subjects and of the Muscat subjects referred to in (5), whether within or without the limits of the Order. (d) Foreigners, with respect to whom any State, &amp;c., the subjects, or under the protection, of which they are has agreed by treaty to the exercise of power or authority by His Majesty. (e) Muscat subjects and foreigners, other than those referred to in (6) and (d) in certain specified coses. The limits of the Order are the territories and territorial waters of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. 64. Various regulations, &amp;c., have since 1916 been issued under the new Order, certain amendments in which were approved by His Majesty in Council in 1922,§ but no question of importance has arisen in connection with its working. (b) Proposal for the establishment of a British Naval Base in the Musandim Peninsula. 65 The earlier history of this proposal, which appears first to have been ‘ n a a „ d , e ! j y Slr L . ewi ? PeHy., then Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, in 1863, is given in the 1'oreign Office Memorandum of 1908, and in Lorimer’s Persian Gulf Gazetteer, Vol. I, pp. 251 to 258. Th . e question was again raised in 1913. In a Note communicated to the Committee of Imperial Defence on 17th January 1913, the Admiralty expressed the view that it was “essential that any naval station that may be17 •control of Muscat the point d'appui of the consolidation of British influence on the north Arabian littoral, but the danger, in its absence, of active foreign interest in the State cannot be overlooked, while should it ultimately prove that the difficulties in the way of an Imperial air route through Persian territory are insuperable, Muscat, with its dependency Gwadur, may prove to ^ be of great importance for air reasons. From the naval point of view, should a decision favourable to the establishment of a naval base in the Musandim Peninsula at any stage be taken, and should it prove possible to reconcile the acquisition of a site for such a base with the terms of the Anglo-French Declaration of ISbd, the principality would acquire an additional importance. 78. To sum up. The predominant influence in Muscat of His Majesty’s Government is in the interest of the State itself. The commitments involved in its maintenance are not, in existing circumstances, heavy, though the presence of a British Adviser and the exclusion of foreign interference imposes on His Majesty’s Government a measure of responsibility for the progress, or lack of progress, of the State. The predominant influence of His Majestv’s Government is equally, and more especially in present circumstances, an Imperial interest, whether from the commercial or the strategical standpoint. It can be maintained without undue “Westernisation,” and, while it can never be popular with the fanatical tribes of the interior, its withdrawal is unlikely to be desired so long as the country internally remains divided as it has been for many years, and so long as no ruler arises with a personality so outstanding as to show himself capable of disposing effectively, single- handed, of the problems presented by the government of his State. VIII.—Points referred to in connection with Persian Gulf Sub-Committee. 79. The points in connection with Muscat which have been specifically mentioned in connection with the deliberations of the Persian Gulf Sub- • Committee are as follow :— ( 1 ) Is the maintenance of the independence of Muscat (which is also threatened, though less immediately, by Ibn Saud) necessary for British purposes, and, if so, how is it to be secured? (P.G. 3 (viii).) (2) Steps necessary on the north Arabian coast in connection with slavery and the arms traffic. (P.G. G, 2 (c) 3.) (3) Extent to which British influence is to be maintained in Muscat: question of relations between the Sultan and the Amirs of Jaalan (Sur): position vis-a-vis the French. (P.G. 6 , 2 (c) 5.) IX.—Views expressed by Government of India. SO. The Government of India have expressed the view that “ the maintenance of independence of Muscat, Koweit, Bahrein and the Trucial Chief is necessary. Our veiled protectorate over them suffices against Tel. from viceroy European encroachments. So long as we do not alienate Arab opinion by 23 ms * 1 ’ attempting undue Westernisation, it suffices also against encroachments by p. sss#, p.g’ 9 . the Wahabi State. At need it can be more explicitly asserted.” India Office, 25th August 1928. J. G.
