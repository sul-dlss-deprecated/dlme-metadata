MESOPOTAMIA Present Political Situation 1. In Foreign Office letter No. 142857 dated lOtli September Lc .IHRHHH the attention of the Secretary of State for India to a complaint by Izzet Pasha of This c ai'ters. Mesopotamia '2. Subject to nhimate jnilitary control the existing administrative organisation of Mesopotamia is as follows - --There is a Civil Commissioner with a Secretariat com prising a Financial, a Revenue and a .judicial Secretary. There are certai'' departments, such as Education and Irrigation, whirh are under Directors reporting immediately to the Civil Commissioner himself. There are 10 divisions, no 'one larger than an average Indian district, the officers in charge of which correspond directly with the Civil Commissioner. Work which in an Imiian province (snch as the Punjab) is distributed between the Lieutenant-liovernor, the Financial Commis sioners, Divisional Commissioners, and to some extent the Accountant-General, is concentrated in Mesopotamia in the office of the Civil Commissioner. On 14th Febrnary 1919, Colonel Wilson was invited to submit proposals for the future administration of Iraq. His scheme {vide 1.0. Print B. 317) was despatched on 6th April. It contemplates the continnance of the existing system, subject to the grouping of the divisions into five small provinces; each to be under a Commissioner, and the creation ot Councils of selected Arabs in each division and each province. Colonel Wilson states his ])olicy very definitely as follows :—' I am ol opinion u that the legitimate demand for active participation in actual (loveniment and administration can best be met not by creating central legislative or dehberafive ' Councils but by giving carefully selected Arabs of good birth and edneation feloaging to' Iraq by birth from the very outset positions of executive and ' administrative responsibility.' ' t&gt; • • i . ,1 It is to be noted that this constitution establishes a British Government ami offers scope to Arab officials only in posts of .limited responsibility. It is m no sense an Arab Government; and does not even contemplate the establishment ot clepait- inents There are no posts to which an aspirant to a portfolio conhl look. Urdeis were passed on these proposals in Secretary of State s telegram No. 1. -404. dated 9th May, as follows: Yoor letter, of the 6th Apnl.

More immediate has ftsen the effect caused by the cessation oi hostilities and the consequent return of the Mesopotamians in the Sharif's army. Mesopotamia, according to Colonel Brayne's note dated 25th April 1919, supplied alwut one-third of the forces, and considerably more than this proportion .of the leaders aud staff of the lledjaz army. When Celonel Wilson's proposals were prepared it was impossible to consult either the members of this force or other Mesopotamian Arabs away from their homes, and the capacity of these men for civil work was unknown at Baghdad. The conclusions of nth April were inevitably reached without a knowledge of all available premises. No public announcement has been made that the orders of 9th May are intended to be provisional. The Syrian element seem to consider them permanent and deem them insufficient, with the result that dissatisfaction is being openly expressed at Aleppo, Cairo, and in Mesopotamia itself. (i) As to Aleppo, vide Appendix to Colonel Brayne's note dated 25tli April .1919. Colonel Brayne's main points are, iirstly, that there are in Syria Mcsopotamians whom his experience shows to be capable of administrative work; and secondly, that there is a strong feeling that the longer the change to an Arab Government is delayed, the moiT dilik'ult will that change be. Mespotamians who discussed matters with Colonel Brayne are very insistent on the distinction between an Arab staffed fVritish (rovernment and an Arab Covernment with British advisers. It is the former which Colonel Wilson recommends, but it is a policy which must mmlt in the exclusion of SctetP ^ Pp0S,tl0n - a11 his Arab officials and Councillors will be ' carefully # AstoCai.o rid,'Colonel French's I,.tt,.rX,,. 311, dated ]4th Auiniat reconli.,.- Conversations with Lotfullah, Prcsicfent oi the Union Syrienne of Cairo •'Utfnl ,h evnlently hates the fiaghdadis, who, with .heir ll.-An.'h rXx than S - ^sentnnents andjhnr aMte. of the JiriUsh on accnuU of o„r t potamia, constitute, by their influence over the Moslem fai.iti.-U... f , ' coalmual danger to his finelv-smm srl.emea' l„ / ' au ' ltl&lt;; h ' 1 of the masses, a with one u, I' :,1 -a. hUle ' ne !- '» the same letter a conversation '' -/^opuianna independent extremists nnn-l^ r ' * *, , ' 1U ^egaru to were sob, ,n both countries for a S ' T1 ' J '^bles ^masses.

I therefore pressed „ , '' a f5,r ;! , «ly the question and h i said that local notables would feel thev ^ had him* xlniiih and that they spoke with more weight if they were elected members ol a mejhss and they would defer all their proposals until then.' L Ir is possible to discount criticisms from Aleppo and Cairo as based on imperfect information, it might even he possible to discredit Naji Beg Suwaidi as an ambitious man disappointed at not receiving-power; but it seems impossible to pass over these very ominous conversations and actions of-ad,nittedly infliiential personages at Baghdad itself. It is therefore for consideration whether the policy on which Colonel Wilson's proposals were framed should not be reviewed in the light of these events and whether arrangements should not be made either for the establishment of a more liberal constitution, even during the unrestful interval which must continue to precede the conclusion of peace, or for the pronouncement of such assurances as will allay existing fears. •o. Colonel Wilson's despatch of Oth April contains a possible solution to the problem. 1 Colonel Howell in his letter (Enclosure No. 5 in B. 317), dated 21st February 1919, wrote that ' after discussion with Bonham Carter and Balfour, it seems to me ' that the best way of realising these objects is to appoint Arab ministers to be nominally ' head of four or live of the many departments ; to give the provincial and perhaps •' some of the divisional commissioners Arab assistants or deputies, and to develop the ' class of D.A.P.O.' He adds : ' I think that in making concession to the Baghdadi's ' reluctance to take up positions outside Baghdad we are stooping unworthily.' Colonel Wilson in para. 9 of the same letter also states that the return of Sir Percy Cox as High Commissioner would give general satisfaction. 0. The Foreign Ollk-e and the India Office, dcpartmentally, are of opinion that the time has come lor a lorward move, and in a paper which will follow this the India Office are putting up some concrete proposals for the consideration of the Eastern Committee. But even if these proposals are approved in principle it will be necessary to send them out to Sir P. Cox for examination and concurrence, and that, m turn, will probably involve discussion with the Mesopotamian authorities. Moreover,iHnmnBn ... if peace with Turkey is to be concluded in the course of the next few montlis, it might be held unwise to introduce reforms which will require further con sideration after the mandate has been given. What our critics are asking for is, firstly that they shall be heard when the future Constitution is deter.mined, and, secoudly, that the Constitution shall be a liberal one. w hat they fear is lest the present administrative machinery become permanent. To secure a continuity of policy and to allay the existing unrest it is suggested that a declaration might be published in the sense that an e accept the \ eidiet of Mesopotamia on our behalf as communicated by Colonel W ilson in his report on self- determination in Iraq; that we will accordingly accept the mandate, provided this be ollered by the League of Nations ; that it is our intention to set up such a Government as will fulfil the pledges given in the Anglo-French Declaration of ■ November 1918 ; but that before framing a permaueut Constitution the leaders of a-- c. g. Arab opinion in Mesopotamia will have an opportunity of expressing their views. v 'mymmm Political Depahtmekt, Inima Office, 28th October I'JJ 9. ^ '' •&gt; —-r- i ^'r - . r,- ---V- ; '.'-r ;Jr I'; p^- : - f .t-'-y 'i; y&amp;S&amp;t .'X - • ■ - % -: ^U V.'- gfr,. :•'&gt;re-- -fxi- ■ • ■ plNk'-' •t'---■■■;- i- - ;■ ■ 2&amp;, : ■ -■ &gt;- -■ ., - ' • - ' 1';- . . ^ ' ■% ■'r ■ / ' ...
