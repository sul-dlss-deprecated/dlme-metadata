The correspondence discusses Britain's desire to establish some form of British representation in Qatar, either through the creation of the post of a Assistant Political Agent based in Qatar or the establishment of a 'rest house' for the Political Agent, Bahrain to use while on official visits to the country. The correspondence discusses the political rationale for such a decision, and the reason behind Qatar's initial opposition to it.The file contains a letter to the Political Agency in Bahrain from Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin Jāsim Āl Thānī that is in Arabic (folio 25).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0002df#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0002df#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
