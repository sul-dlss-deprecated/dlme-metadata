In .princj^4&amp; we w ould welcome the establishment of an air attache in KabUIT'and fe£T fnat it would provide us with reliable representation on air matters in an area which is likely to increase considerably in strategic importance. We have, however, consulted his Majesty f s Minister in Kabul on the subject, and he feels that, quite apart from the expense of such an appointment which would also have to include provision of accommodation, it would be of doubtful political wisdom at the momexit to raise the matter with the Afghan Governmexit. They would probably be reluctant to agree for fear lest Russia' might demaixd similar concessions, and they might even be suspicious of our own motives in view of the smallness of our Royal Air Force staff in Kabul. I suggest, therefore, that we defer the matter for the time being. The present Military Attache, Colonel Lancaster, is a man of considerable experience in Afghan matters, and I feel that, at the moment, we are supplied with a satisfactory amount of intelligence on all subjects, including air matters. The proposal might be reconsidered when Lancaster leaves. By then the political arguments against requesting the appointment from the Afghan Goveriiinent may be less strong, and our own economic position at home may have improved, which will increase the chances of securing Treasury approval for the post. In the meantime, a possible solution is that the senior Air Force officer on the staff of the United Kingdom High Commissioner of Pakistan (I presume that if no such appointment yet exists it soon will do so) might be instructed if you agree, to visit Kabul regularly to ensure that matters of air intelligence are dealt with adequately, and to supervise, if you decide it is necessary, the work of the Royal Air Force staff attached to the Afghan Air Force. The senior Royal Air Force adviser in Kabul might be allowed to correspond direct on purely service matters with him. His Majesty’s Minister in Kabul is not in favour of the senior Air Force adviser in Kabul communicating direct with the Air Ministry instead of through the Military Attache as at present, on any matters having political implications. I imagine that you would agree with this and that you had in fact oxily intended to propose direct correspondence on purely service matters. Any other course might raise difficulties having regard to the fact that previous Royal Air Force officers in Kabul have been comparatively junior to Lancaster’s status. However, the problem will hardly arise if you are able to accept the suggestions made above in the previous paragraph. I should be glad to learn your views. I am sending copies of this letter to Ross of the Commonwealth Relations Office axid Major-General Packard of the War Office. Yours sincerely (Sgd.) Paul Grey M.W.

The conditions under which the officer serves with the Afghan Government are, of course, a matter between Squadron Leader Reid and that Government and there is no question of Air ]?orce funds bearing any of the costs involved. The.position as regards his liability for return passage, etc. was, moreover, made clear to the officer before he accepted the appointment. We feel, however, that the requirement that he should bear these considerable costs would weigh most heavily and unfairly on him were the appointment to be terminated for reasons outside his control^before the full term is up. We are anxious, therefore, that the arrangements should be revised in this respect. A- A.H. Whitfield Esq., Room 243, External Affairs Department, India Office^ King Charles Street, S.W.1.4. Would you be good enough, to arrange for the Afghans to be approached with a view to their accepting the condition that if* for any reason outside the control of SQuadron Leader Reid^ —^ the contract is terminated before running it*full term,they would bear the return travelling, etc. expenses within the £150 agreed, in addition to whatever may be agreed as regards the travelling expenses, etc. of any replacement that may be provided. 5. The case of the officer falling ill of a disease incapable of treatment in Afghanistan, necessitating the termination of the contract is, I imagine, already covered, since this was provided for in Wing Commander King^ contract, the terms of which apply to the present case apart from the special conditions as regards rate of salary and contribution of £150 each way for conveyance. 6. I suppose that a contract is to be drawn up and signed locally and if this is the case we would be obliged if we could have a copy. 7* You were good enough to write to the Legation on the 12fth April, about the Afghans paying the return passage after 2 years instead of three. I have pointed out above that Air Force funds cannot bear any of the cost in connection with this loan and we should be most grateful if you could let us know what the position is on this point.

The Afghan Ministry of Defence are very anxious to continue to employ British instructors in the Air Force but they have difficulties with the Ministry of Finance. Especially is it difficult for them to keep on having to go to that Ministry and say that either the pay or some concession to be given to the instructors is to be increased for one reason or another. It is therefore most unsatisfactory to have to ask them to pay their instructors at rates which include such fluctuating charges, as ration or marriage allov.’ances, which are liable to change at any moment. In particular they do not see why they should be asked to provide extra concess ions for a married officer. Now that the European community in Kabul, especially the French and American contingents, has increased to such a*great extent it is no longer so necessary to have married instructors, whether officers or N.C.Os and if we have to ask for increased pay aid allov/ances for married officers then obviously the Afghan Government would wish to stipulate that only bachelors should be appointed. 3 . It it is agreed that we should try and maintain our present influence in the Afghan Air Force, far the best solution would be that the Air Ministry should enter into some sort of contract tc provide suitable instructors to the Afjian Government at more or le-s fixed rates such as they have now agreed to. The Afghans would then pay these sums and these sums only to the officers concerned leaving it to the Air r in is try to decide whether the particular, officer! should draw any additional sums from His Majesty f s Government as allowances or should hand over to H.M.G. any part of what he receives as contribution tovjards his leave, or pension etc. 4. The Afghans have now offered:- (i) Pay £ 1650 (ii) Allowance for passage and carriage of goods £150 each way, once every three years. (If for any reason an instructor does not stay his full time it would normally be for H.M.G. to arrange for a replacement without extra cost to the Afghan Government. If the instructor could be allowed to come with his family, if any, on a trooper £150 would probably be more than enough to cover the cost of railway fares from Bombay for the whole familyand allow something for cartage of furniture. If the Air Ministry feel tnat a two year contract would be better from the point of view of keeping their instructors up&gt;-to-date we could press for this change).’(iii) A free unfurnished house with 4 or 5 rooms. ( Owing to increasing difficulties of accommodetion anci to the tact that one or two French professors have recently arrived with seven children wanting enormous houses the Afghans have said that they cannot undertake to provide more than this). (iv) Other terms as in their contract with King. Xf tne Air Ministry could undertake to provide instructors on these conditions many of our difficulties would be solved. I am sending a copy of this letter to'Baxter and also enclose a spare copy in case you would like to pass it on to the .'iir Ministry who will already iiave got Air Vice Marshal Kingston McClougriry*s recommendations on the subject.

Pilot Instructor in Afghanistan. The present financial arrangements are summarised in a note by the Kabul Legation at flag ’B*, and the new proposals by A.H.Q. India at flag ’A*. It will be observed that the withdrawal of the Government of India's contribution of £550 per annum will leave £450 per annum to be found to meet A.H.^'s proposals, together with marriage and ration allowance, and other incidental . expenses such as passages. Presumably we should in the first place ask H.M. Minister, Kabul to see how far the Afghan Government will go. It will be observed from Ext.6413/46 that Cpl. •Lancaster thinks the highest possible sum to which they 1 fl. agree would be .£1200 per annum. This would leave £200 per annum to be found from other sources together with the other expenses mentioned above. It is not perhaps necessary at this , stage to pursue the matter further but it seems '— -~ T&lt;0 Wt that the Air ’inistry should be invited to contribute this compajjat^ve^y small sum, cf (*4*U4 UcUfMp My. 1* yubyMit ii A slight complication arises from the fact revealed in telephone conversations that the Air LAnistry think that Wing Commander King should leave Kabul as soon as possible, as he is already long overdue for release. If the reply to our telegram No. 144 and the draft express letter below (now suspended) had been more satisfactory it might have been possible to make the changeover about the end of this year. This is obviously impossible now, and it seems likely that the Air ministry will have to accept Sir G.Squire's proposal^.

Sir, Your obedient Servant, • ’POINTS REGARDING THS SKLaGTIQN OF A BRITISH PILOT INSTRUCTOR FOR THS A^'GHAN AIR PORGS . 46 ! 1. He should be of the rank of Squadron Leader, have if possible war experience and be a qualified flying instructor. He will be required to teach Afghan pilots to fly Tiger Moths, Hinds, Avro XIX and possibly Spitfire aircraft. 2 . He should have character and tact and be able to advise the Afghan authorities on all questions relating to the organisa tion, training and operational side of their Air Force. In addition when he has secured the confidence of the Afghans he should be prepared to advise on civil aviation affairs. He must be a discreet officer. 3 # He should be abstemious but prepared to entertain Afghan officers in his house on a small non-alcoholic scale, and be able to mix socially with both Afghans and foreigners including the diplomatic corps in Kabul. 4 . He can be a bachelor or a married man, but he should not be in debt when he arrives in Kabul as happened in the case of one pilot instructor some years ago. 5 . He should be able to maintain discipline amongst the four W/O.or Sgt, instructors of the R.A.F. in Kabul and supervise their work. 6 . The officer appointed (also his wife, if married) should be prepared to live at a reasonable standard in Kabul, and at the same time realise that the life in Kabul is somewhat limited. 0 A very level type of officer is required. 7 . Any officer appointed should be prepared to stay in Kabul two yeans, and if he likes the place and the Afghans like him for three yeans. 8 . The officer appointed should be one who can influence Afghan officers in the right direction, increase the prestige of Great Britain in aviation matters and generally secure such a position for himself that the Afghan authorities will turn to him for advice rather than make approaches to representatives of other foreign countries. He should if possible be an officer who is known in India and who is able to secure help from the R.A.F. or I. A.F. in India. 9. The British pilot instructor acts as adviser to the British Legation on Air Force affairs and also deals with the indent for and check of spares, etc., supplied to the Afghan Air Force by the Government of India and His Majesty's Government. I (Sd) A.S. Lancaster. 3. 9.46.\ So far as the question on this particular file is concerned viz. a successor for Wing Commander King, the matter has been discussed by me with Sir Giles Squire and Air Vice-Marshal Kingston-McCloughry. It was decided that Wing Commander King’s successor, whoever he may be, should be offered the minimum salary now considered necessary for this appointment in the light of the great increase in the cost of living in Kabul viz. (vide paras 15 and 16 of enclosure to S.N.4) £.1400 per annum, plus a free unfurnished house, if a bachelor, plus - if married - an allowance roughly equivalent to the ration and marriage (or separation) allowance usually paid in the R.A.F.DEPTL.

Ms pay during his period of Afghan service was fixed at £1200 per annum the first year, £1350 second year, £1500 third year. Out of this sum the Afghan Government were to pay £960 per annum while the Government of India paid the balance, see their telegram 751 dated 10th May 1939 (PZ 2940/39) and our telegram 1430 dated 25th August 1939 (PZ 4897/39)* If you see no objection, we should be glad if you would pay Wing Commander Burt-Andrews the equivalent of the sum of Rs. 197/1/- which is said to be owing to him by the Government of India, and recover it through the Exchange Account. CW. ^Vcju Jbo ^(LcLk . . 'H')-The attached letter from Mr. Squire is interesting and it will he a useful record to have when advising people in future who are going to Afghanistan. Mr. Rumbold conducted the interview with Squadron-Leader King (before the latter had decided to accept the appointment)^ and I do not remember very clearly what was said to him on these points. I do not recollect that he asked about evening dress. We let him read Squadron-Leader Wigginton’s contract(the officer whom he was to relieve) and the clause there is clearly !f unfurnished house” . I believe the point we made was chat he could not get bulky furniture shipped but could probably hire it out there. ts regards linen, crockery, etc., we passed on the telegraphed information from Kabul to his wife who followed him. He would have nad time oe_. ore sne lef u to oonci ner instructions about things that were lacking in Kabul.

Unfortunately this telegram apparently just missed King who therefore arrived with no linen, crockery or cutlery, xie also says that he ^ was informed by the India Office that though civilian kit was 'necessary evening dress was not. He was also apparently given to understand that the house which would be provided would be furnished which is not the case. 2. in case another new Pilot Instructor or any other employee \ of similar status is being sent out in the future, would it not be : a good thing to leave it on record that full civilian kit is required and that household articles are difficult, if not impossible, to come by in this country, and that therefore linen or cutlery should invariably be brought if possible and crockery either brought out or purchased in India en route. The difficulty about furniture is 1 am afraid unavoidable at th^ moment and newcomers just have to manage as best they can. i...J.Clausoh, ^squire, India Office, London. BEfio.

Ext Telegram from KaLul No dated Subject The Under Secretary of St^.te for India presents his compliments to the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Legs to inform him that the following distribution of the above mentioned paper has been made:- The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office•2CT.TO2A5 I^r&gt;Claus on .Vith regard to Mr .Squire's three points in Katodon 306 (a) alteration of clause 8; (b) Squadron-Leader King's understanding of his contract; (c) cost of return passage. As to (a) I do not think we are expected to comnent. After reading Mr .Griffin's d.o.letter to Mr.Curtis, it seems a very fair way out of a difficulty and if the Government of India will consent to compensate out of the Afghan Fund it seems that every body should be happy. (The Government of India, by the way, made a profit of £lc,000 on the sale of the old Hinds to the Afghans in 1959, and it was agreed that they should use it in subsidising the salaries etc., of the British personnel loaned to the Afghan Air Force.) As to (b), Mr.Rumbold and I showed Squadron-Leader King a copy of his contract before he left, and told him that we under stood that his own contract would be drawn up on similar lines. We had no notion then of this exchange*rate difficulty. He raised no queries oh any points in the contract,-in fact he only had time to glance hurriedly through it. His appointment was so rushed that I doubt very much if he had any clear understanding of the terms of his employment when he left the U.K. We have not yet received the Government of India letter of 2_5th August quoted, so the rest of the remarks on (b) are obscure. As to (c), I think we cannot ask the Afghan Government to pay the return passage to the U.K. A precedent was formed by recruiting Burt-Andrews and Newman from India, and it was just bad -*.uck that no suitable R.A.F. officer has been available in India since. I think that India should pay out of the Afghan Fund, (see our d.o.letter to Kabul, Ext. 5024/42). I think, therefore, that our answer should be as follows :- (a) We agree. (b) King was told nothing in London. (c) Yes, - confirmed.■■■■I111 DEXE 0 x document to any person outside is autho^iaed, it must be paraphrasetre'-»»^- ^ l u j AJj^~ &gt; ^-Ja.- ia^ecnaJt Deo 1 1 0oprl e ^ 01 T*ojfiate cI an d to goreign Office ^ HI a Majes ty 1 e Mini st er, Kabul, To Secretary ol’ State Tor Foreign.

In the latter event the clauses ^ in question could be recast so as to omit any reference to the Peshawar rate. 6 . Logical though either of chese requests would be, it is extremely unlikely tiurt the Afghan hovemiiient would accept either. They would probably take the line that this stipulation about the Peshawar rate had become invalidated by not baying been taken advantage of and tliat though it still appears in every new contract and in each yearly renewal of old contracts the parties when executing these new or renewed contracts /aust have Known that it iwas a dead letter. And since it is our wish to keep this British ; air personnel here, it is clear that we would rot be prepared to {employ the ultimate sanction to back our requests, namely the i withdrawal of the personnel whose contracts the Afghan Government &lt; refused to honour.' 17« In these circumstances it would be a mistake to approach j the^Afghan doverment and Iiave our requests refused, but the fact t we are not in does not absolve hts under their eontrac' Government which is between tne Aignan u s conclusion is not prepared to enforce tneir ririita seems inescapable. 8 .

Though I have had no formal correspondence with Afghan ,«Grovernment on the subject, 1 have lust learnt informally that they would like us to sup ly suitable successor to wigginton whose decision not to stay on both they and i mucn regret.

These are dealt / with in correspondence leadirg up to y our telegram no.243 dated (ofilu-l* Hth July 1942. In addition I attach' importance to new Instructor- / ( having, like Wigginton, war experience and to his beii^j somewhat j older tlian Wigginton. In fact the older the officer the better so long as he is still of flying age. If he could speak french , ‘it wcpuld be useful, though this is not of course an essential Squalification. 4. Date of expiry of tlgginton's contract is just before Independence Da v review in which Air Porce plays a prominent ^ nart'. It is not desirable that new Instructor should be faced with this on arrival without his predecessor as stand-by. i \ Assuming therefore that new instructor takes oyer on l/tii^ August y' .m * - this will avoid complications which v;ould arise if wigginton s w # contract had to be extended for a short period - I suggest that Wigginton stay on till about end of month, his pay for period after expiry of contract being met in full by Government oi India at' Indian rates. I understand that wi. inton will have no objection to staying on these few days more and, thpugh he will no longer be in J their employ, Afghan Government will not, I know, raise any kind of objection* 5. Although the contract with the Afghan Governnent in respect-'^ o^ the new Pilot Instructor will, as usual, be ior one year in !the first instance I consider that the officer who is deputed should be required to undertake to the Government oi india to remain for at» least two years it the Aigban Government alter me initial year ?/ish to renew his contract for a second year.

The Legation was at first informed by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that a relief for d/L Newman as pilot instructor would not be required. The Ministry of Defence were then approached and stated that they had not been consulted, and were unaware that such a decision had been made. The next day the Ministry of Defence informed the Legation that a relief for 3/L Newman would be required, and that the new pilot instructor should be attached to the Afghan Air Force for a further year on similar terms. This was later confirmed in writing by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Squadron Leader Jiggington R.A.F., the new pilot instructor, is now on his way to Kabul from England. The Ministry of Defence and the Comdt. of the Air Force have on several occasions during the quarter stressed the necessity of having a pilot instructor attached to them who is a capable administrator and able to advise them regarding the organisation of their Air Force and the establishment of workshops etc., on the Khwaja Rawash aerodrome.anCO CO D.G.no•420/42* BrLegation, &amp;aBul List i&gt;ecemLeI• 1942. &gt; yr• ^jg^ini^on *s contract Aijth ^fghan Gov ernment* Dear Department, , . . ...

V/e have read with interest Lancaster's quarterly report on the Afghan Mr Force for the period 1st August to 31st October, 1942, forwarded under your covering letter No, 186/4JL of 7th November. 2. Since the Italian personnel 'were removed we have had a clear field for developing our influence in the ^fS han Air Force. There is of course the military value, m the eventuality of the Afghans becoming at any time our of the Afghan Mr Force being equipped so far as possible on same lines as the R.A.P., and the poUtieal value to our relations with the Afghan Government of assistance in this sphere» indeed the main sphere in which the Mghan Government have so far accepted our help, and to some extent they are ^ kel y to judge our ability and willingness to help them m other nutt^ by what we do in this one. There is' the further consideration that these contacts may encourage members of the Mghan Mr Force to entertain friendly feelings towards the R.ii.F. in particular and hence to Great Britain in general. If Mghan^ youths are like those of other countries, we are likely to tmd that it is the more energetic and ambitious among them 'who gc in for flying, and consequently the chances of some of the manbers of the Afghan Air Force becoming, by reason of their personal qualiuies, influential at Kabul when they are tenor fifteen years older, nay be good. It is, therefore, worth while for us to take trouble with them. 3 . Ihe question of Hind spares seems to be the main question of the moment end seperr.tc correspondence is Procec xng on this point (your letter to Ceroe No.463/45 ^ our letter to Curtis Ext. 1557/43 of 1st i.pr:a).

We hope that he is learning Persian and developing personal contacts with the Afghan pilots, I do not know whether he is to remain at Kabul after his first year is up in August, but it seems desirable that as a rule our Pilot-Instructor should spend at least 2 years there. 6 .

The Royal Air Force officers who have previously been loaned to the Afghan Government in this appointment were lent from the Indian establishment of the Royal Air I Force and the Air Council presume that the Government of India will negotiate the loan of Squadron Leader Wigginton on the basis of an officer detailed from the Indian establishment. It is suggested that the fact that Squadron Leader Wigginton v/as selected in this country does not affect the liability of the Indian Government and the Air Council therefore propose that the Indian Government should assume responsibility for the officer's emoluments with ( effect from the date he v/as posted to the Indian establishment and embarked for India, namely the ISth^ June } Q 4.2 , as provided in the memorandum of financial J arrangements between the India Office and the Air Ministry reproduced in Appendix V of the King's Regulations and Air Council Instructions. 5.

Dear Hay, I am writing to you on the subject of Mr.J.W.M.Lewis one of Hawkers 1 men, who is at present employed by the Afghan Government as an Aircraft mechanic. 2. Lewis* contract expires at the end of November, and the Afghan Government are unwilling to renew it in the belief that they can get another man at the same price, i.e. £550 a year, and thus avoid paying the large increment of £200 v/hich becomes due if they renev/ Lewis* contract for another year. They have been told that it is extremely unlikely that they will be able to get anyone from England and that as they have agreed to keep a staff of 4 British air experts for three years they may have to retain Lev/is* services. I understand that he works quite well at his job, which is that of a much * rigger*, and that he does not/mind whether he stays or returns to Hawkers, but I should like to meet the Afghan Government*s wishes if possible. 3. It has been suggested that possibly the Royal Air Force in India can provide a man to take Lewis* place. If this were possible it would help Burt-Andrews a lot, since naturally he does not find it always easy to work with civilians, good though they are at their jobs. 4. There is also the question of the wireless operator and photographic expert, see correspondence ending with my express/ Major V/.R. Hay, C.I.E., Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, in the External Affairs Department, Tteal Viexpress letter No. 465, dated the 20th May, 1939. Burt Andrews would like these men to come up now and to stay a year, since he does not think they would be able to make much progress in less than this time. I feel this is rather a lot to ask from the Royal Air Force at the present time, but as it is our policy to secure our position in the Afghan Air Force, they might consider what they can do to meet this request. 5. The question of pay is also for consideration. If the man or men sent up v/ere from the Royal Air Force I think they should come outwardly as civilians but actually seconded from the Royal Air Force. If that were done they would presumably require less pay than the Hawker civilians, and a -portion of the £550 now paid by the Afghan Government to Lewis could go to the wireless and photograph men. 6. But before going further into details of this sort I should be glad to know how the Royal Air Force view these proposals in general. 7. I am sending a copy of this letter to Peel by air mail.

The Government of India seem to have been under the impression that Flight Lieutenant Burt-Andrews would still be entitled to some payment from R.A.F. sources during his term of service in Afghanistan, but the Air Ministry state that this is not the case.

It was understood that the funds for this purpose would be found from surplus proceeds of the '—■ ; ^ o ! sale of aircraft to the Afghan Government.

POLITICAL Department. Mr.. Yeel — -\a The only points with regard to Burt Andrews' contract as proposed by Fraser-Tytler which might possibly be open to doubt seem to be the following:- (1) Clause 7. Will the Afghans think 5 months leave in 3 years excessive? Russell Stracey got 1 month in 1 year. (2) Clause 8. Will the Afghans agree to the salary 'being paid in accordance with Burt Andrews' wishes'?- (3) Clause 9. The Afghans will probably jib at paying Burt Andrews the price of the return fare from Kabul to Great Britain since he was serving in India before he went to Kabul. (4) Clause 19. The terms for the possible extension of Burt Andrews' contract will require consideration unless it is definitely intended that he should not stay longer than 3 years in any case. The first three points do not seem very important but it might be advisable to say sorre thing about point 4 in writing to the Air Ministry. With regard to the last part of paragraph 4 of Katodon 53 this is presumably for the Air Ministry Perhaps it will be as well for Mr. Crombie to take a look at this on Monday. to say.

I am, therefore, directed to make the following recommendations regarding his appointment:- (a) The services of Flying Officer Burt Andrews should be loaned to the Afghan Government from Imperial Estab lishment and struck off the strength of Royal Air Force in India with effect from the 15th May 1939. (b) His pay should be fixed as follows:- 1st year £1200 per annum. 2nd year £1350 per annum. 3rd year £1500 per annum. jLam to presume that the Afghan Government will pay £960 per annum and that the balance will be met con jointly by the Air Ministry and the Government of India, and to request that the Government of India should be informed at what rate and by what method this payment will be made by the Air Ministry so that they may know their own liability in the matter* They recomnend that the payment should be made direct by the Air Ministry.OF Allotted to Politic ijpp 0 3 re al at ed c SECRET J, * m * - a, i .J ~r U o V .i; - J DECYPHER 504 groups o OF TELEGRAM. 869.

At the request of the Minister at Kabul the Government of India propose to lend the Afghan Government the services of two members of the R.A.F. in India for the purpose of providing the Afghan Air Force with assistance and instruction in Photography and Wireless Telegraphy. In recent despatches Fir W.Fraser-Tytler has emphasized the desirability of offering technical instruction of this kind to the Afghan Army and Air Force both with a view to strengthening the goodwill and stability of the Afghan Government, and in order to counteract the increasing influence of the Germans and Italians over the Afghan Defence Services.
