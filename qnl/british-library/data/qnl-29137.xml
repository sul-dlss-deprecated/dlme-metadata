Jenkin. I have read all of these reports with considerable interest. It is clear that a good deal of dissatisfaction exists among Indian labour but that it is not so marxed with Pakistani labour. it also seems fairly clear that the c^erk element is, as usual, at the bottom of it. ihe references to a a.b.b. organization and to direct touch with Communists in ^omoay are important. If time permits, tne run down of the Indian element may solve that siae of the problem, but I am doubtful whether time will permit and whether their place will not be taxen by a Tudeh element. In any case it seems to me to be unbound to re-employ any man, especially Cj-er^s, in the koweit oilfields ii bhere is the slightest aoubt aoout txieir previous activities in ^baaan. I From reading these papers I get the impression that those in charge at Abadan do not attach tiie importance to the suo 0 ect of Communism that it merits anu that they are inclined to under- estimate the aangers. lisPin^-L 3rd March, 19^9 H iuju. wvEXTRACT PROM MONTHLY REPORT FOR JANUARY 1949 from BRITISH EMBASSY TEHRAN. 13» There are some indications of increased Tudeh activity in Khuzistan. A one-day strike took place in December in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s marine workshops at Abadan and it is feared that there may be further strikes and industrial trouble this year. Mohammedi the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company worker who attended the International Labour Organisation Petrol Committee Meeting at Geneva has recently visited Tehran to present grievances of Abadan workers to the Ministry of Labour; they claim that the customary procedure for settling grievances was being obstructed, that the current rate of real wages is inadequate owing to the increased cost of living and that there have been unjustified dismissals; it is not clear how far Mohamadi's mission June was undertaken on Tudeh orders. A number of Tudeh leaders are reported to have paid surreptitious visits to Abadan recently, and suspicious characters have been arriving at Ahwaz from the North. ■ —TOP S SCR ST &lt; f * &lt;1 H, ~ K~t f i Report for the Quarter October - December, 1948, I 0 1 ^ on the affairs of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Companyv General 1. There were some important developments affecting the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company which came' to light in the last quarter of 1948. It became public ;aiowledge that the General Management are to move to Khorramshahr in the near future; there were signs that the Company may expect trouble from their labour in the course of the next few months; and |there were indications that a fusion of the Tudeh Party with 'the Central Union of Khuzistan Oil Workers is not outside the bounds of possibility. H.R.H. Prince Ghulam Reza and H.B. the Ambassador for Pakistan in Tehran paid visits to these areas during the quarter. Ivor Jones returned to Abadan in Oc tober. 23. India n and Pakistani . The Indian Staff Consultative Committee, which was disbanded at the instance of the Indians themselves about the middle of last year as not being truly representative, was re-formed during the quarter after elections had taken place to appoint a representative to the Committee from each wage level. Reports state that the Committee is meeting at regular intervals and is working well. There is little change in the temper of the Indians as a whole, who continue to resent the fact that they are not treated with the same consideration as the British or Iranian staff employees. They seem however to be somewhat resigned to the fact that the majority of them will be replaced by Iranians in the next five years or so, and appreciate that it is only due to pressure from the Iranian Government that the Company are obliged to dispense with their services. 24. A number of senior Indian and Pakistani employees have been invited to attend aT.I.I. (Training in Industry) course of lectures which the Company has recently introduced for all classes of employees holding key posts. This appears to have been strongly resented by some Iranians, particularly the newly-engaged graduates from Tehran, who maintain that the course is of no use to the Indians, who are in any case going in a few years time, and that they - the Iranians - are the ones who should therefore be given preference. It is reported, however, that this argument has been firmly resisted by the Company officials. ^5* Artisans . Owing to the arrival of fresh recruits from Pakistan and India, the number of artisans from these Dominions rose by about 150 during the quarter. Most of the new arrivals have been engaged on short contracts specifically for the construction of the new Catalytic Plant. Special permission for their recruitment had to be obtained by the Company from the Iranian Government.(E14330/2231/34) (9 IN - EXTRACT PROM A REPORT ON AFFAIRS OF THE ANGLO* OIL COMPANY FOR QUARTER JULY - SEPTEMBER. 1948. iy jr i i ±5'. Indians and Pakistanis . Most of the ringleaders amo^fs? the Indians who had 'been openly disloyal to the Cornfraajfc, inciting others to follow suit have heen weeded out and returned to India on the expiry of their contracts. So far, this appears to have had a salutary effect on the few remaining hot-heads and there has heen no further trouble during the quarter. This may also he partly due to the fact that the senior and junior Indian staff have recently heen receiving more attention in connexion with the supply of furniture and other requirements. They therefore feel that they are not being overlooked, and that there are as yet no signs of the concessional obligations of the Company (replacement of Indians by Iranians) being put into effect. 16. Some misunderstandings arose in August when some of the junior Indians refused to agree to holding a joint function with the Pakistanis to celebrate Independence Day of India and Pakistan, but this problem solved itself when it became known that the Governments of Pakistan and India had decided to celebrate the occasion on separate days, namely the 14th and 15th August respectively. The R.3.3.group continued to hold weekly meetings but no details of these are available. Communist literature continued to be exchanged between the Headquarters of the Indian Communist Party in Bombay and some of the Indians in Abadan, but the volume of this traffic is reported to be decreasing in both directions. *17. Mr. Shaida, a senior staff employee of the Company, was elected President of the Pakistan Association in July, replacing Mr. Dar, who had been dismissed from his honorary post for embezzlement of the Association funds. The latter is employed by the Company in a responsible capacity as Security Inspector. The death of Mohammad Ali Jinnah cast a deep sense of gloom over all Pakistanis. 18. Artisans . 58 Pakistani and Indian artisans were discharged during the quarter on the expiry of their contracts, some being surplus to the Company’s requirements and others being replaced by Iranians who had qualified for their posts. This caused the artisans some anxiety, which was later mitigated to some extent by the news that the Iranian Government had agreed to issue visas for 95 out of a total of 200 Pakistani artisans indented for by the Company. Four of these have arrived and the remaining 91 are yet to be recruited. At the end of the quarter, the total strength of the Pakistan artisans was 988 and that of the Indians 87.'

Large functions were held in Abadan and Khorram shahr to celebrate the firsts anniversary of the establish ment of the Dominions of India and Pakistan. In Abadan, the Pakistan Association was in the first instance invited by the Committee of the Indian Club to make the celebration a joint one. This was strongly resented by the members of the R.3.S. Group (C.f. paragraph 50 of Diary No. 5.) who threatened that they would see to i$ that at least bilf the Indian community would boycott the function if it we?e celebrated jointly. The Committee therefore cancelled 1 their invitation to the Pakistanis and decided to hold an independent, function. The senior members of the Indian staff, mostly Christians, thereupon wrote a letter to the Club Committee expressing their disapproval' of the Committee s weakness in surrendering to the demands of a small group of hot-headed junior Indians, and demanded^ the Committee's adherence to its original plan of a joint celebration. Fortunately the matter was solved at this juncture by the receipt of intimation from the Government of Pakistan to the effect that Pakistan Independence Day - °S fici ? 1 , 1 y observed on August 14th. Functions were therefore held independently in Abadsn on August 14th and 15th and were well attended by members of the^respec- tj.ve coronunities.

His Excellency the Indian Ambassador, Sayed Ali Zahir, accompanied by his First Secretary Mr. Bannerji and Treasurer Mr. Bhasin, arrived in Khorramshahr on the 8th April. Arrangements for this visit were made by Mr. Bhasin with a personal friend of his, Mr. Bell of the A.I.O.C., Station Superintendent in Khorramshahr, by telegram, prior to my receiving official intimation. Mr. Bhasin had asked for accommodation for the party in the Company 1 s Guest House - Khazalieh - but this request was strongly resisted by Ivor Jones when I spoke to him about it on the telephone. I therefore suggested that His Excellency should stay with me in the British Consulate, and the invitation was accepted. Bannerji and Bhasin stayed with Mr. Bell in his private house. The party left for Basra on the 11th and for Tehran by Iranian Airways from Abadan on the 13th. His Excellency made a point of seeing many of nationals during his short stay here. Two large functions were given in his honour, one at the Indian Association Club at Khorramshahr and the other at the Indian Club in Abadan. Further details of his visit were given elsewhere in this report. The Indian Ambassador’s visit was followed by that of Major Hassan, the Pakistan Charge d’Affaires, who apparently arranged for accommodation for himself in the Company’s Guest House through the Company's representatives in Tehran. His two-day visit was fully taken up by social functions and he expressed his regret at not being able to come into closer contact with his nationals here. Two large receptions were held in his honour by the Pakistan community in Abadan, and a cocktail party was given by the Indian Association at Khorramshahr. Major Hassan stressed the strong ties between the people of Pakistan and Iran, and he exhorted his nationals to be loyal to their employers.COPY 1^5668/2231/34) CpU* -K* CxILcati f r vjfc» ^ iblsL&amp;y-^) Extract from Report on Affairs of Anglo-Iranlan J ^ Oil Company for Quarter Ap r il-June. 1948 ) *4 1 ; _ . 5-3 Indian and Pakistani. An important development in respect of the Indian staff employees during the quarter was the organisation of an R.S.S. (Rashtrya Sevak Sangh) group in Atoadan. It is said to he a branch of the party in India, where it is now illegal. As ar as is known this local body has no political significance or ntentions, but has merely been organised as a symbol. Reports have been received that a similar branch has also been opened in Mas jid-i-Suleiman. In general, there has been no change in the temper of the Indians. The Indian Club continues to be dominated by a few of tlie younger elements with a most distorted view of their new 3 state of independence, publication) received a the Indian employees in Diary about the extreme those of Iran. A news The Editor of the Abadan Diary (an A.I.O.C. number of vituperous letters from some of reply to an ill-judged remark made in the poverty of the Indian masses as compared wi item published in the Company’s Daily News th Bulletin about a good-will message from the Sikh leader Tara Singh to the Provisional Jewish ’State’ in Tel Aviv drew another volley of abusive letters. Some of the more prominent mischief-makers, who had been indulging in anti-Company activities and propaganda, were sent back to India on the expiry of their contracts, but a few of them are still left and the Company intend to weed these out as soon as possible. A few of the mischief-m aker s still in Abadan are reliab ly reported to be incTose touch with the Bombay branch Communists# who are reported to exchange views with | fl ^ __ . _ to and frqm_Bonibay.Jby Indian employees going on leave. A certain amount of Communist of In their .an empl oyees gulng on leave. A certain amoun t of Commui material has arrived here, including a Manifesto of the Communist Party in lndj .a ancTan Explanation of the apparent inconsistency of the Teachings of Lenin and Marx on the on ; hand and the present Soviet Union Communists on the other. During his visit to Abadan, His Excellency the Indian Ambassador had discussions with both the Senior and Junior Indian staff, and listened to the grievances of the latter. He also made a tour of the housing areas, and inspected the quarters of the Junior Indian staff about which they had complaints to make. On the 10th April, an informal meeting was held in the British Consulate at which His Excellency and his staff, Mr. Gobey and Mr. Evans of the Oil Company, and myself were present. Mr. Gobey commenced by explaining that considerable pressure was being placed on the Company by the Iranian Government to get rid of British and Indian staff, and to replace them by Iranis. So far as the Indians were concerned, this process would take a long time: numbers had increased considerably since the war, and had risen from 350 to about 728 owing to the increased out-put. Mr. Evans had already explained this to the Indian Staff and it had not evidently been properly understood because rumours were current to the effect that all Indians would have been replaced within five years. Some would, of course, go within this period, but some would be staying longer. The Company would do their best to obtain jobs for those Indians who had served them satisfactorily in other Oil Companies in the Persian Gulf and in India. He added that a small faction of malcontents amongst the Junior Indian staff had been creating a certain amount of trouble, and that their behaviour could not be calculated to be in the interests of either the Company or themselves. The Company, therefore saw no reason why they should continue to employ such disloyal elements. His Excellency said he could see the force of his arguments, but that he had seen for himself that afternoon the quarters in the Park area in which his nationals were living, and that they compared unfavourably with /thosethose 'being 'built for British and Iranian staff. Mr. Gobey replied that the Company had decided to demolish the Park Area altogether and rebuild, and that this was definitely on their programme. The Ambassador then said that he had seen instances of panes of glass missing, water pipes choked etc. and Mr. Gobey said that the Company would attend to these matters. He added that the Company were in a difficult position as regards Indians, owing to Concessional obligations, and that he was ready to admit that the Iranians were better off as regards housing because it was after all their own country and they were in the majority. Any slowing up of building programmes which would result in advantage to Indian staff would necessarily draw strong criticism from the Iranian Government. The question of the disbandment of the Indian Consultative Committee was then discussed. Mr. Gobey explained that the Committee was elected from Indians on different wage levels, that meant that the Committee was representative of all the Indian staff, both Senior and Junior. The Junior staff who were in preponderence had objected to this form of election, saying that the Committee was not truly representative. They wanted free elections irrespective of wage levels. Mr. Gobey could not agree to this criticism because if this was permitted the small faction of irresponsible elements referred to above would undoubtedly be elected, and would not be truly representative of all the Indians. The first Secretary Bannerji was all for giving this a trial, but this was resisted by Mr. Gobey. The Ambassador then made a suggestion that the Government of India should appoint a ’'Labour Attache” who would actually live in Abadan and act as a Liaison Officer between the Indians and the Company. He would be in a position to investigate all grievances and represent them to the General Management. Mr. Gobey thought this suggestion a good one and said that the Company would welcome the idea. He pointed out that the Indians wished to form an Indian Association and draw up a Constitution; this was not feasible however, because such an Association would in fact be a Union, and it was against the Iranian Law to establish such Unions without the permission of the Government. The Ambassador appreciated this difficulty and the meeting then terminated. The whole question of the Indian employees in the A.I.O.C. is a very delicate one. Now that an Indian Ambassador has been appointed to Tehran, the Indians feel that they have a heaven sent opportunity to better their conditions. The matter is not so much one as between the Indian employees and the Company as between the Indian Government and the Iranian Government. The onus is therefore on the Indian Ambassador to take up the matter with the Central Government in Tehran and see whether he can gain their sympathy. This would save the Oil Company considerable embarrassment as it is there is little doubt that the Indians are worse off than the British and Iranians in certain respects, and they are growing more and more conscious of the fact. Owing to the force of circumstances the Company^ attitude towards their Indian employees is inclined to be ’’take it or leave it”. The Indians are extremely well paid, and this has been intentional to make up for their other disadvantages. Take for instance the matter of housing. If the Estates Department hand over say 50 new houses to the accommodation section, 25 would be reserved for Iranian recruits from Tehran. Out of the remaining 25 , 21 would be reserved for Iranian and British staff, and 4 for Indians who are very much in the minority. The Indians are therefore on a losing wicket, their numbers will be steadily diminishing, and they cannot therefore expect to obtain new and better accommodation on any other than a proportionate scale. The senior staff recognise this, but it is difficult to make the junior elements appreciate the reasons which have forced the Company to adopt this system. In point of fact, the Iranian Government are far keener on getting rid of the Indian Clerical Staff than the British. They maintain that there are plenty ofyoung men avai-lable for training in clerical work who have University degrees, and they can see no reason whatsoever why Indians should continue to hold posts which should he available for their own nationals. This is only natural, but it is not possible for the Company to tell the Iranian Government that Indians make far better clerks and that they would prefer them to Iranians. Nor would it be tactful to explain this viewpoint to the Indians themselves. I also discussed these matters privately with Mr. Gobey who was acting for the General Manager (who was on leave) and I impressed on him the advisability of taking urgent measures to remedy the minor instances of lack of maintenance pointed out to the Indian Ambassador. Maintenance is in itself no easy matter these days, and I speak with feeling because I live in a house rented from the Company. It is often extremely difficult to get trivial repairs done expeditiously. It all boils down to shortage of material, and it seerns almost impossible to make malcontents realise this. Mr. Gobey said he would do his utmost to improve matters as soon as possible. I pointed out that any improvements which could be made as a result of the Ambassador's representations would be greatly appreciated not only by the Indians but also by the Ambassador himself, who being a Mussulman, might well become a target for criticism from the non-Muslim elements of his own Dominion. It would therefore, be greatly to the interests of the Company if they could gain his sympathy. It is reliably reported that the Indian employees of the Company are keeping in close touch with the Indian Embassy in Tehran. A number of telephone conversations have been taking place recently with Mr. Bhasin, the Embassy’s Treasury Officer. The Pakistanis' attitude towards the Company contrasts jf strongly with that of the Indians. They feel that their best ^-interests would be served by being loyal to their employers and ‘•this fact is known and appreciated by Company officials. A Pakistan Association w&amp;s inaugurated in Abadan on the 14th April with the Company’s approval. A Senior employee with 27 years of service with the Company was elected President of the Association. This election was a popular one, but not so that of the Secretary and other office bearers, most of whom were suspected of being dishonest. The members* fears were realised when a sum of Rials 4000/- was reported to have been embezzled by the Secretary from funds collected for the function in honour of the visit of the Pakistani Charge d'Affaires. An impartial enquiry was thereupon made by a Committee, whose findings established the Secretary's guilt. He was asked to resign and has since done so. Artisans . The majority of these are Pakistanis. No fresh recruitment of artisans from either Bombay or Karachi have been made since the beginning of the current year and many of the old artisans have not returned from leave owing to visa and other difficulties. The Iranian Labour Training Scheme, whereby most of the Indian and Pakistani labour will be replaced by Iranians within the next 4 or 5 years, is well under way. The present rate of 'wastage” of Indian and Pakistani labour (for reasons of retirement, dismissal, etc.) is between 300 and 400 a year, and if no fresh recruits are to be obtained, it is expected that the existing Indian and Pakistani labour will be reduced to a mere handful in that time. The total number of artisans at the end of the quarter was 11 56 in Abadan and about 500 in the fields areas. In general, the artisans appear to be generally satisfied with their lot. The political activities and changes in their country have little interest for them and they are much more concerned with earning as much money as they can while the going is good. In view of the Company’s intention to Iranianise the artisan classes, the labour authorities have decided to shelve all /long-termlong-term welfare schemes which had 'been on their programme for Indians and Pakistanis. In accordance with a Government order, all foreigners working in this area are required to possess a special Government pass. The Government authorities have accordingly sent passes in bulk to the Company for issue to their foreign staff and artisans. The issue of these passes was completed in Abadan during the month of May. The popular ex-officio President of the Artisans 1 Club, Mr. J.W. McNab, has been transferred from the Indian and Pakistan Section to the Industrial Relations Office. He has been succeeded by Mr. Johnson who has been who has been appointed to look after this section of the labour office until he can be relieved by Major Hodson, a former I.P.S. officer, who is now ill in the Company^ hospital.'•'V COPY ’ ' u lc ' i ' ^ if” 11137/4638/34) X Extract of Khorramshahr Consulate pj- a ry No. 6 for peri.od l^tii Jun e to 15i:h July, 1948• . *On 4tM July, 'atjaut—100 cuplfea ur an abusive letter, written by a recently-dismissed Indian employee of the Company and addressed to the General Management, were circulated in Abadan.

The Commonwealth Relations Office to whom vie sent an extract on 'Indian and Pakistani Affairs' from Khorram Shahr Consulate Diary No. 5 for 1948 have suggested to us that the organisation of 'branches of the R. S. i&gt;. S. in Abadan and at Masjid-i-Suleiman together with the action of the Editor of the Abadan Diary in publishing the message from Master Tara Singh would seem to point to thd possibility of an organised attempt to incite communal trouble in the Refinery and oil-fields areas between Sikhs and Hindus on the one hand and Pakistani Muslim employees of the A.I.O.C. on the other hand. The Sangh, as you probably know, is the Hindu Communal Array and has now been declared illegal in India* It is violently anti-Muslim andboth it and Tara Singh were deeply involved in the communal troubles during the partition of the Punjab consequent upon the separation of the Dominions of India and Pakistan. It would seem from paragraph 17 of the Report on the Affairs of the A.I.O.C. for the quarter April-June 1948 that the Company are aware of the dangerous possibilities latent in the present state of affairs and have already got rid of some of the disaffected Indian staff and intend to get rid of the others as soon as possible. We leave it to you to decide whether anythiiig should be said to the Company on the above lines, or whether they are already sufficiently conscious of the danger.

A few Indians in the employ of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company have organised a R.S.S. (Rashtrya 3evak Sangh) group in Abadan. It will be recalled that the R.S.S. organisa tion came into the limelight in India in connexion with the assassination of Mahatma Ghandi and that it was subsequently declared illegal by Government its branches all over the country being closed down and its leaders arrested. The local R.S.S. group is reported to have been established by an Indian named Pbatak, who has been holding meetings regu larly in the private quarters of members of the group. The object of its establishment in this area is difficult to understand, but inquiries regarding- its activities are being made. Reference paragraph 41_ of Diary No. 4« The Editor of the Abadan Diary ccame in for another letter of vitupera tion during the period under report, this time an anonymous one from an Indian on his way home on leave.

Oh'ffi-oa ny. ^ 18. Indian. There has recently been sone disaffection \jln the Indian aiiib in Abadan, insnired by a snail minority ^ the Junior Indian Staff. The ringleaders are A. 7 T,J. Rodrigues, who holds a Soanese passoort, and P.K.Karianpa. There are about five others. The Secretary of the Indian Consultative Committee, P.X.Vaz, has informed the Comnany that the Indians do not regard this r Committe^ as b^ing truly representative and that they wish to form an Indian Staff Association. They have also exoressed the desire that the retiring President of the Club, Mr.Innes, should be an elected Indian and not an European. The membership of this Club is made up as follows:- v uslims 133 (Senior and Junior Staff); Hindus and Sikhs 261; and Christians (Indian Christians and Goanese) 359. During the recent elections to the Committee, Hindus of the Jnior Indian Staff only were returned wit+r^he consequence that the Muslims and Christians are more or less frozen out of the Club, and hardly ever go there. Moreover, the large majority of the Indians who have given years of loyal service to the Company avoid having anything to do with this Club owing to its small faction of troublemakers. I discussed the matter with the General Management at their invitation on the 25th March and their attitude is as follows:- As regards the proposed Indian Association, they maintain that such an association is in reality a Union, and cannot therefore be officially recognised as such, being against the laws of the Country. They cannot stop the formation of an association nor do they wish to do so, but they can only use the regular^ channels already in existence, namely the Indian Consultative Committee, which was properly constituted in the normal manner. This is bt ing communicated to the Consultative Committee. As regards the proposals that an Indian should replace ’ f r. Innes as President, the Company are unable to associate themselves with this proposition because the Club is subsidised by the v uq Company, and it is situated in a Company building. The same is the case of the Bashgar Iran (Iranian Club). 19. There have been reports of violent anti-Comnany speeches by the ringleaders mentioned above, and the Company feel that the assurances given by Mr. B ha sin who came down here last December in connection with the Sikh trouble (see paragraph 16 of my last quarterly Report) to the effect that the Company would have no further trouble from these hotheads, have proved of little value. The Company are under strong pressure from the Central Government to get rid of their Indians and to replace them by Iranians, and they propose to include these undesirable elements in the list of names of those Indians who are to be retrenched. It is being made known, however, amongst the Indian Staff that the Company will do their best for those Indians who have served the Company loyally and satisfactorily, to obtain jobs in other oil Companies in the Gulf, especially in Kuwait where it is said that the Shaikh is anxious to replace Iranians and Iraqis by Indians. Heedless to say undesirable elements will not be so recommended. I am in full agreement with the attitude of the Company in this matter. They have shown great patience with these communist-minded young men, and I can see no reason why they should continue to harbour them in their midst at such a critical juncture in the world’s history. There are, however, bound to be repercussions when these men find their . services have been terminated, and shoals of telegrams ^ f alleging ’victimisation* will doubtless reach the Indian i Ambassador in Tehran in due course, and anti-Company articles * will appear in the Indian paper ’BLITZ*. /The ComrVA The Company feel that they are on firm enough ground to answer any of* these charges, should they 'be called uoon to do so. 20 . The Indian artisans, the majority of^whom ^ are TJoslens, anoear to be quite contented. This reflects^ great credit ©n the excellent work of Mr. J/V/'c^ab, Assistant Labour Superintendent (Indian; who enjoys the full confidence of the artisans. The name of their Club, formerly known as the Indian Club, has now been changed to the Pakistan Club 1 . s r : io rfvv n i r/T % 'cf ni vlp.

It consists chiefly of extracts of quarterly reports, prepared by HM Consul-General at Khorramshahr, on affairs at the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC), and extracts from the Khorramshahr Consulate Diary. The reports concern working conditions and unrest amongst Indian and Pakistani employees at AIOC, and subversive activities amongst AIOC employees. Reference is made in several reports to the activities of the Rashtraya Sevak Sangh group at the AIOC (also referred to as the Hindu Communal Army [Rāṣṭrīya Svayamsēvaka Saṅgha]).
