Agents that Sheikh Hamad was not to be received as a passenger on boa^d S. s. 'Waroon^a 1 *• B. I should be ^lad to knovf if the action taken by me in this case is approved and have the honour to solicit^ instructions for future dance, should ^heikh [amad attempVto proceed to Basra by the steamer of -another company. It might ~ot be so easy to stop him and neither I, at first sight, nor 'ly-pre- '-decessor whom I have consulted, attach such importance to Sheikh Hamad's attempts to intrigue with the Ottoman authorities as would Justtify the inconvenient of keeping a close watch on his movements. We are inclined to think that after a visit to'Basra he would ^ * probably return empty handed and dis justed and that. In the meantime, Sheikh Isa. fright be advised to con- -fiscate ^heikh f amad * s village of Shahpura, as a punishment for any such act of insubordination, and on his return, make him a subsistence allowance from ^le ^ m * - ^ revenues of tiie attached village.

Sir, * I have the honour to reply to your letter No. 774 dated 18th November 1^10 regarding the proceedings of Shaikh Hamad bin Mahomed bin Khalifa. 2. I agree with you that sufficient importance does not attach to Shaikh Hamad ! 3 attempts to intrigue with the Busreh authori ties to justify the inconvo'nisrvce of your keeping a watch on riio movements. I suggest your explaining this to Shaikh. Esa if -occasion arises and expressing the hope that he tfilJ: devise measures of hie own for preventing Hamad from going to Busreh if he real ly attaches serious importance to his relatives intrigues. I think shaikh Hamad has already been warned that he need not -expect assistance from us if his attitude towards Shaikh Esa prompts the latter to take some drastic action in regard to him, and I do not think we need object if the action taken ic siich as you adumbrate, but think the preferable course would be to concur if Shaikh Esa makes the suggestion rather than to make it yourself.

One of his informants was Sheikh Ali bin Mix^aiouad Sheikh Hamad's brother- one of the three to whom you spoke about the latter*s con duct on 36th August 1910. Sheikh Isa said Lhat relations between himself and the 3 other brothers were excellent hut that Sheikh Hamad was sulky and never came to see him nor paid him any courtesies. 3. I was careful to try and act .in accordance with the spirit of your letter above referred to. I urged Sheikh Isa to try iUvX keep a watch on Sheikh Hamad's movements and head him off from a pilgri mage to ijasra.

With reference to our confidential talk today about the affair of Shaikh Hamad bin Muhammad al Khalifah and hia evil conduct which ia contrary to my desires, I asl'ed you to help i one of two alternatives - either that he should go to Karachi and be detained there for 2 years or that your friend should / £&gt; take away the date gardens which are confided to him tem porarily and appoint a monthly allowance for him and that he should produce a surety that in the future that he will do nothing derogatory to my Government or displeasing to me. I shall be obliged to you.-W- Kanai for hla overtures to the ^urka. iiaat year 3haikh lea ooraplainei to we of tb© In subordination of Shaikh Hairad, but the latter, on my sending for him, asked for forriweneso and was arain for given.

Shaikh Isa was muoh disturbed by the extracts from Herr Harling's oorresnondenco which I showed him, and has gradually come to the conclusion that it was A Shaikh Marsad who had entered into an arrroerent with the Germans. He says that ho has ascertained that Perr Hoist * was in Baghdad at the same time as r.haikh Khalifah, that he returned to -Bahrain immediately after this and had many mysterious interviews with different persons. ihe reality of ths German connection with the' Tan^slris, which was hinted at in Herr Harlinfr's letters, has confirmed Shaikh Isa*3 suspicions, and he now wishes to take the opportunity ^ivpn him by Shaikh Hamad's fresh show of insubordination to come down heavily on him. 4. His proposal is that Shaikh T 'amad should be- sent to Karachi or elsewhere in India on an allowance of Rs. ■ a month, and that his family should receive another Ha.100 A a month, both allowances to be paid from the date rroves assigned to Shaikh Hamad for his life; or that, failinfr this, he should resume all the pronerty assigned to Shaikh Hamad, and irive him Rs.30n/- T&gt;er month. tk 5. 'Thatever may be the truth as to the orlfinal intrigues, shaikh I«amad la quite incapable of actlnp; as an efficient tool of the Germans. He strikes mo as al most half-witted, is a notorious evil-liver anl suffers from a disfip^ring disoass, which makes people avoii him. To deport him to India seems to me somewhat heavy- handed treatment for such a contenmtibl© creature; but it would be a fault on the rifcht side; and would, at any rate, show the people that ohaikh laa is, for a change,■no. Chief Poi^tioal Office, BUS R A H * Dated 4t-h January 1916 • political Agent, Bahrein„ Your letter 59.0. of 8th October. I am sorry this matter was overlooked by me during my hurried visit to Bahrein, and neither you nor Sheikh Esa mentioned the subject. I expect therefore that the fact is that Sheikh Esa has forgotten it. I hardly think Shaikh. Hamod is of sufficient importance to deport; and such deportees and their affairs when in exile are a greathuisance to Governmert % I Short of that the man's record i3 so bad that I. do not * • • # ^ think we need object to Shaikh Esa resuming his proper -ty and giving him a monetary allowance of 300/- If he continues to behave in-subordinateiy; but if Shaikh Esa has forgotten the matter I would be inclined toThe Residency, ^ Bushire, 19th January 1916.

The key correspondents in the file are Shaikh Ḥamad and Shaikh ‘Īsá, and a succession of Political Residents (Major Percy Cox (later Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Cox), Major Arthur Trevor) and Political Agents in Bahrain (Captain Francis Prideaux, Major Stuart Knox, Captain David Lorimer, and Captain Terence Keyes).The opening letter in the volume, dated December 1904, is from Shaikh Ḥamad to the Political Agent (Prideaux) and Resident (Cox), and is a request from Shaikh Ḥamad for an increase in his monthly allowances, which Cox rejected (folios 1a-5). Later correspondence, dated 1910, reported on the growing antagonism between Shaikh Ḥamad and Shaikh ‘Īsá, which led to Shaikh Ḥamad threatening, and then carrying out his threat, to seek the protection of the Wali [custodian] of Busorah [Basra] (folio 13). British officials did not attach great importance to Shaikh Ḥamad’s threats, but nevertheless instructed staff the steam ship company Gray Paul &amp; Co. to refuse Shaikh Ḥamad passage (folios 17, 18). However, in September 1911 Shaikh Ḥamad succeeded in making his way to Basra, and onwards to Baghdad and Constantinople, with the apparent intention of taking his grievances against Shaikh ‘Īsá to the Porte (folios 26-27). The Wali of Basra sent an envoy to Bahrain to negotiate between the two parties (folios 38-40). In the meantime Shaikh Ḥamad returned to Bahrain, where he was reported to be wearing Turkish dress and bearing an Ottoman medal (folios 64, 65).Shortly afterwards, reports stated that Shaikh Ḥamad and Shaikh ‘Īsá were reconciled (folio 71), but in the following years, further clashes between the two periodically surfaced, including an incident in which Shaikh Ḥamad’s Bedouin servant shot the dogs of a respectable Manama resident in 1914 (folios 83, 84), and the beating, in 1915, at Shaikh Ḥamad’s instigation, of Shaikh ‘Īsá’s camel herder (folios 102-03). In a letter from the Political Agent (Keyes) to the Political Resident (Cox), dated 8 October 1915, and in light of Shaikh Ḥamad’s previous intrigues with Ottoman officials, the possibility of Shaikh Ḥamad having been the member of the Āl Khalīfah family suspected of making contact with German agents is mooted (folios 118-20). Shaikh ‘Īsá’s subsequent request to British officials to have Shaikh Ḥamad deported to Karachi, ultimately fell on deaf ears (folio 121).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Khalīfah (Family)</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002e9#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
