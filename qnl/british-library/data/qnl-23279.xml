Major T.Hlckinbotham,CIE,OBE, Political Agent, Manama, Bahrain Island. My dear Major: With reference to your recent inquiry con cerning the application of military law to certain offenses,you are advised that I have delayed reply ing because I have been attempting to get some special infomation regarding the recent arrangement between Great Britain and the United States as to jurisdiction of American Military Courts. You asked what offenses are within the scope of military courts of the United States. The Articles of War that govern^ the Armies of the United States are many in number but I am pleased to quote a few for your infomation:- Article 92 .'Any person subject to military law who commits murder or rape shall suffer death or imprisonment for life, as a court-martial may direct; but no person shall be tried by court martial for murder or rape committed within the geographical limits of the States of the Union and the District of Columbia in time of peace'.' Article 95. 'Any person subject to military law who commits manslaughter,mayhem arson, burglary, housebreaking, robbery, larceny, embezzlement, perjury, forgery, sodomy, assault with intent to commit any felony, assault with intent to do bodily harm with a dangerous weapon, instrument, or other thing, or assault with intent to do bodily ham, shall be punished as a court martial may direct.'-2- A rticle 96« 'Though not mentioned in these articles, all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good orderand military discipline, all conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the military service, and all crimes or offenses not capital, of which persons subject to military law may be guilty, shall be taken cognizance of by a general or special or summary court martial, according to the nature and degree of the offense, and punished at the dis cretion of such court.'

No.9211 Dated and received 21st April 1944. BuMSDIATE Your telegram No.796 March 28th. American Consul for BAPCO. # Question has been discussed with Wallace Murray during his visit here and he was persuaded with some difficulty to be % content with visits from Consul at Dhahran. I must assume there would be no difficulty about arranging for an office to be placed at his disposal by Bahrain Oil Company on their premises and any necessary clerical assistance. It will no doubt be necessary to arrange for him to have radio-telephone facilities. 2. Ijnmediate cause for State Departments pressure in this matter lies in presence in Bapco of large number of American workers engaged in refinery construction and Wallace Murray is concerned that there should be (a) satisfactory police arrangements and (b) some arrangement for American participation on iudicial side. ^ 3. As to (a) it seems doubtful whether control by American Military Police will have been acceptable to U.S.A. War Depart ment and Murray suggested Oil Company might be able to furnish small number of civilian police. If not the State Department would wish to introduce some from elsewhere. While agreeing that assistance of American personnel would be desirable (as police officers under Regulation No.2 of 1939) I do not think we should accept position under which Political Agent would depend entirely on American personnel as his executive agents. At2. It would presumably be equally unwise to depend on existing native police force for control of exiotlng American personnel and it would therefore appear desirable to bring in some British police personnel, say a superintendent and about half a dozen others, in order to maintain our position. I should be prepared to ask War Office to move PAIC to release personnel for this purpose in civilian capacity if no other source of supply, e.g. India, is available. 4. As to (b) Murray^ suggestion was that as a temporary expedient American Consul should be appointed to act jointly with Political Agent in his court for hearing of American cases. This could not be done under existing Bahrain Order- in-Council and further would imply American consular juris diction unless U.S.A. Consul sat on bench as a judge appointed by His Majesty^ Government and not as Consul. Presumably if American Consul chose to attend court ( mut. ) as observer and without any judicial functions there would be ^ no objection to this though it probably would not fully meet Wallace Murray's needs. Alternatively would it be prafcticable under Code of Civil Procedure as it is present applied for Political Agent to try such cases as Senior Judge with aid of American assess ors who might include the U .S.A. Consul if desired or suitable members of the Oil Company. I should also like to be assured that Americans charged with offences will have legal advise readily accessible to them. 5. I should be glad to have your views and those of the Government of India on these suggestions or any alternative suggestions for meeting of American desiderata. You will appreciate that as we have gained our point over Consul it is important that we should go as far as possible to mei wishes of Americans on these other points. Please treat matter as immediate as Wallace Murray has asked to be given our further views on it before his departure before the end of next week. RETAXANDUM/5 iVjlc a b// t\ Telegram Prom To No. J?S S Political Agent, Bahrain Political Resident, Bushire IMMEDIATE \ Dated 21st April 1944. India Office telegram No 2. Police arrangements. 9211 dated April 21st Eight special constables were appointed by me under Regulation No.2 of 1939 on February 8th (see my Printed letter No.C/302 February 9th) of whom four are British subjects and four Americans. These appointments were made after consultation with Chief Local Representative of Bapco and the Station Com mander specifically for the control of Bapco and B.M.P. employees. Station Commander has four British military policemen whose services are always available in case of trouble with Oil Company employees. 3. Native police must not be relied upon and I ehould not. Xc/kt*. $ N welcome^ American military police unless they are picked men. Colonel V/arburton Provost Marshal PAIC was recently here and after discussing the position with him I gather PAIC could increase their provost personnel and this would in my opinion be the best course. Provost personnel could if necessary be appointed special constables under Regulation 2 of 1939. Judicial. 4. Murray * s suggestion that American consul should be appointee to act jointly with the Political Agent in hearing American cases is objectionable from both political and legal points of view. Political Agent's lost of prestige would be very considerable and in no time he would be sharing the bench with a Persian colleague. American consul can attend judicial proceeding here as he can anywhere else in the Empire and also act as juryman or assessor... si 5. Arrangements can be made for all. cases in which Americans are accused to be investigated by a European magistrate as long as there is an Assistant Political Agent. Section 276 of the Criminal Procedure Code already allows for an American j&amp;sgisjbrats majority on a jury and Section 284-A for American assessors and the Political Agent could be instructed not to invoke his section 30 powers in American cases. 6. There are no legal practitioners in Bahrain but such c. advice as I and my subordinates are able to give has never been and will never be withheld from British or American subjects. ?• In my opinion Murray^ concern over the presence of the refinery construction /aen is only an excuse. They will probably have completed their work by the end of the year. 8. I anticipate that Bapco can provide accommodation and clerical staff for the Consul but I cannot/ verify this without mentioning the subject to the Chief Local Representative which I have so far refrained from doing.

To The Hobble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, Sir, I have the honour to inform you that the following off! cers of the United States Army called on mo this morning and questioned me with regard to the procedure for dealing vith American subjects who committed criminal offences in Bahrain:- Brigadier-General Foyall, (Finance) rolonel Stetson, (Finance) Colonel Henkle,(Judge Advocated Branch). 2. I explained to them the significance of the Bahrain Order- in-Council and went on to describe in detail the procedure for dealing with Europeans and Americans accused of offences against the Indian Penal Code. I read to them the relevant sections of the Criminal Procedure Code which provided for the trial of European British Subjects and explained that Americans could and would be treated in exactly the same way # They enquired with regard to the arrangements for the custody of convicted persons and the procedure with regard to appeals. I explained that we were not well equipped as far as jail accommodation v/as concerned but that there was provision for the imprisonment in India of persons convicted by the Agency courts and that in the case of anything but very short sentences I would request that the con finement was carried out in India. With regard to appeals I I explained that an appeal lay to the Chief Court at Bushire. In answer to a further question from Brigadier-General Royall I stated that the usual method of executing perono sentenced to death in Bahrain was by shooting and not by hanging. 3. Brigadier-General 'Royall enquired whether any American diplomatic or military official was in possession of a copy of the Bahrain Order-in-Council or of our Agreements with the /Sh^ ikh■ a'V 2 Shaikh of Bahrain. I informed him that I could give him no information on this point. Bric^dier-General Royall then enquired whether the procedure in Kuwait and Muscat wore the same as here and I stated that, speaking from memory, the procedure v/as exrctly the same in Kuwait as far as American Subjects were concerned, but that in Muscat there was a slightly different arrangement because the United States Government were thetasclves in treaty relatione with the sultan of Muscrt end until the beginning of the p^resent century they maintained a United States Consul at MUecat itself. 4. I understand th^t the party are here in connection v ith financial agreements between the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the Persian Gulf Service Command regarding equipment to be loaned to the Company from United States military sources. They propose to leave for Dhahran on the 28th of May and will return on the 29th of May.

Major G.R.Bartsla tha Daputy Provost Morahal from Tahra.. called to soo me this morning and I explainod to him the legal procedure which would be enforced should cases be brought into Court against American Subjects. 2. Major G.R.Bartela told me that he much deplored incidents which had oc^urrGd nt the Ci3 Company and that he greatly admired the restraint which was displayed by the British personnel in the face of repeated taunts from an unruly element *of the B.M.P.Corpo ration's employees# He said that there was still tension due, in pkrt at least, to some sixteen people some of whom he considered to b e agitators and all of whom he felt should be removed from Bahrain. In addition to these sixteen there were a further tv/enty whose agreements with the Company had been terminated for some reason or other and who were at present awaiting transport to the United States. Major Q.R.Bartels was particularly anxious to have all the thirtysix men removed as quickly as possible and said that he had heard that delay was occurring in regard to the twenty men aforementioned as it renuired three weeks to obtain a visa from the American Consul in Basrah and also because U.S.A.T.C transport was not immediately forthcoming. I made it clear to Major. G.R.Bartels that we can and do issue visa facilities for all Americans from here to the United States and that the Company were perfectly aware of these facts. I suggested that possibly what they meant was that they had sent certain passports to be renewed in Basrah and that the delay was due to circumstances ' outside our control. Major G.R.Bartels said thot he would look into this point and would also see what he could do to accelerate the provision of U.S.A.T.C. transport. He enquired whether I had the power of deportation and I explained carefully to him the contents of Sections 21 and 22 of the Bahrain Order-in-Council. I pointed out to him that they were very wide but that my powers had in recent years been restricted by an executive order from the Hobble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf which necessitated my not carrying into effect orders /of2. of cl«portotion until such time as the Residont hod himself had on opportunity of examining the proceedings and confirming the order. I soid thot should the American authorities make a speci fic request for the deportation of certain countrymen of their own from Bohroin ond bo prepared to put forward a sworn testimony which would fulfil the provisions of Section 21 of the Bahrain Order-in-Councili I felt it most probable that the Political Resident would bo prepared to restore in part at least the Political Agent's powers and authorise him to deport, without prior reference to Bushire, American Subjects whose presence in the Islands was no longer considered desirable by the American Military Authorities. I advised Major QJUBartels to represent the matter to his own Authorities and said that should he desire me to take action im mediately with regard to t he sixteen individuals he had mentioned then I was prepared to communicate with the Resident by telegram pending a more formal settlement of the question. 3. I explained to Major G.H. Bartels that the special pritri-» s leges to which American citizens would be entitled, as far as the Sessions Court was concerned, was contained in paragraph 2 of Section 284-A of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code which granted certain special considerations with regard to the nationality of assessors. I further informed him of the prodedure by which a case could be tried by jury in Bahrain a nd explained that it would require or order from the Chief Court, and that the same privilege with regard to assessors cotald be exercised with regard to a jury under paragraph 2 of Section 276 of the Criminal Procedure Code. 4. //ith regard to cases dealt with in a Magistrate^ Court, which were in themselves not sufficiently serious to warrant trial in the Court of Sessions I explained that as far as the procedure of the Court was concerned there was no fundamental difference between British Subjects, Europeans, and Americans, and as far as Bahrain wob concerned it has been the practice of the Agency Courts to ensure that Europeans and Americans were invariably tried by a Magistrate of the same colour. With regard to cases in which one of the parties was a local subject and the other party or parties /wasv/as a Kuropean or an American I explained the special procedure which wao contained in Chapter XXXIII of the Criminal Procedure Code fiiid which except for certain inter eating comentaries would appear to be exclusively for the trial of mixed cases between European British Subjects and Indian British Subjects. I made it clear that this procedure would normally be brought into effect if the parties or one of them desired it. With regard to the question whether Chapter XXXIII should be applied only in the case of European British Subjects or whether in certain circum stances Americans could be considered subject to the provisions thereof I said that I proposed to make a reference to the Chief Court as I considered it a debatable point but that in the mean time 1 should hold that Americans would be subject to the provi sions of Chapter XXXIII. I pointed out to Major Q.R.Bartels that siiould it eventually bo decided that such a view was not the correct one then no harm cou:.d have been done because Section t*Pi, 628-CjJaade it clear that judicial proceedings would not bo in validated merely by reason ol tho fact that a complainant or accused person who was not entitled to be considered as a European British Subject had been so considered. Major Q.B.Bartels stated that he was communicating telegraphically with Goneral Connolly and General Csborne in the near future and xhat he proposed to compose a report which he would show to me before he despatched it. '24-6-1944V ™ . On the 19th of June 1944 I instructed Mr. T «S* Rogers, I.r.s., Assistant Political Agsnt Bahrsin end e Megistrete of the First Class to hold an enquiry into en effray which was alleged to heve occurred et the mein Refinery gete on the night of the 17th/18th of June 1944.

I have eleo inspected the scene of the effrey. In my opinion the importent polnte aret- (e) The man Kimble admits entering the Refinery erea without an identification dlec end thereby committed en offence punishable under Article 3 of the Prodametlon dated the 18th September 1939 iesued under Defence Regulation Ko.l of 1939. (b) An affray did take piece between certain of the persons who arrived in the 'Jeep' end the Behrein Speciel Police guard during which eundry persons from both perties were eeeaulted. The evidence however is not sufficiently clear and relieble to warrant any proeecution being ordered. (c) The fundamental cauee of the trouble wee the lack of a common language. Neither the B.M.P. Corporation employees nor the Speciel Police could understand each other. If they had been eble to it ie unlikely that the Incident would have occurred. It ie eeeential that the Security personnel on the gates xkoudbd who have to deel with British and Americans should be British or Americen. (d) The Special Police exceeded their duty in continuing to ettack the B.M.P. Corporation employees efter they had left the Refinery gate. /(e)2 (•) Th« main body of th« guard are houaad at a conaidorabla distance from the Refinery gate and it would be quite possible for the sentries to be overwhelmed before the guard could come to their assistance* (a) In view of the tension which I am informed exists at the premises of the Bahrain Fetroleum Company I do not propose to order the prosecution of Kimble for entering the Refinery premises without the prescribed pass* It would not be advisable to precipitate a crisis in the absence of adequate European or American police personnel to preserve law and order for the sake of what would probably be held to amount only to a technical offence. Should a grave breach of the peace occur then the law must and will take its course whatever the consequences* (b) In view of the high state of excitement the Specisl Police were in and the fact that they are inexperienced as police men no further notice need be taken of their exceeding their duty but they should be warned of the extent of their powers for future reference* Political Agency, Bahrain, 26th June 1944 District Magistrate*Tho vorslon of the incl lent nivan by the Americans Is briefly as follows. rhey ar'^lved In a Jeep at the refinery gate about 10 p-rr.

One of the? had nc pass because It had been attached to Ills shirt and the shirt had bcjn le^t behlnl. ^is was e&gt;rDlalned, or attempted to b^ explained, to the guards by tteans of sign language. Xhe guards refused to permit entry without the pass am th^ American ICIaible^ Viho vas without a W pass, claims to hav« got out ci' the Jeep ir. order to telephone for his pass to be arou ^iit. Ht, apparently crossed over the chain ]»arriii§ the wntraiiCc to the refinery in ©rler to ^o and telephone, Leanwhile, the Ai ^ar lean, Stewart, who had beer attempting to parley v*ith one of the two guards on duty at the gate^claims to have been struck by him. No hot words preceded this assault which is claimeu lo have completely surprised the American. He retaliated by hitting the guard, knocking him down, The American,Kimble, ^rho had intended to go and telephone, seeing the exchange of blows anu seeing the other guarii move towards Stewart, seized tne i?ifle which the guard held, apparently to make sure that it was not loaded. Afc this pojnt other guards came on the scene, one (according to Stewart) araied with a pair of shoes, and others variously armed with bayonets, sticks, and belts. There was a general melee between these guards and % Nimble and Stewart,-who, as far as the evidence £:oes, Trere not joined by their comrades. Of these, one. Ma anass, hrd gone to iha telephone ©outh to call for somebody in authority, and another. Swain, had deciued to keep out of the scrap. Evidence was not otVoreci on the part phyei by the fifth American present, but Kimble say^ that his conpeinions other than Stewart did not cross over the chain into the refiner/ &amp;nd did not take part in the set-to. After an exchan^a of blows the two Anericans, Stewart aiid Kimble, forced their way bade to the Jeep which had remained outside the refinery gats. Thejfr were pursuer 5 by the Arab guards who were attaokia^ them .vith sticks and bolts and /who# i.-T? wiio continued to do so until the Jeep moved o f.

The lorry did XKk In fact arrive on the scene but It was not interfered with in any I accent Mr. Rose 's evide.:jLce es conclusive on this point. 3. There are number ef '.isc rep-noies *n the stories told by both sides, but the version put forward by tho Americans, if aore coherent, is neverthelesf less credibla. In the first place, the AL.:rican K^ble admits, as do his companions also, that he crossed over the chain, ostensibly In his desire to f »o to the telephone. E &gt;f en if the telephone had been sitrated inside tho refinery precincts, he v :ould hr.rdly have been Justi fied in entering the reflriery Aithout a pass and In defiance/5. a. 51 of the orders of the guards of which he must have been well a&gt; are. But since the telephone was actually situated outside the refinery gate and some distance to the rear and right of the Jaep as it faced the gate it seems clear that his excuse that he crossed the chain in order to go to the telephone is flimsy in the extreme. Moreover, it is scarcely credible that, as is claimed by the Americans, one of the guards, without any hot words being exchanged, should suddenly assault one of the Americans. Had it been admitted by the Americans that there had been an argument and that the temper of the guards had risen, the taking of the initiative by the guard in striking * man of white race might have begun to be credible. But that tue guard, in cold blood and without any previous sign of rising anger, should have struck the American first and without warning Is not to be believed. 4. I find no difficulty in believing that the root cause of the incident was that one, or perhaps two, of the Americans had no passes; that they were quite properly prevented by the guards from entering the refineryj that they attempted to persuade the guards to disobey orders in allowing them to enter; that the guards refused? that the Americans attempted to ta*e the law into their own hands by lifting the chain in order to force entry; that the guards resisted this and were assaulted. What happened after the preliminary awlt is a little confused but it is clear that the melee which followed was a natural conse- quevtttto of the assaults begun by the Americans; so that, while on tte one hand it could perhaps be argued that in continuing ~o pursue the Americans after they had been disarmed and wanted tj break off the fight the guards exceeded to some extent their doXjy*11'.could more justifiably be urged that once feeling had run high as a result of an unprovoked assault, the guards could hardly he blamed for their action. Moreover, it is reasonable to argue on their behalf that they were entitled to pursue and arrest the Americans, though in fact they do not claim to have had this purpose in mind.5. In any case the technical offence of entering the refinery gates vrithout beln£' In possession of a pass Is proved beyond doubt In the case of the Americans Stewart and Kimble• So much is clear even if discrepancies in the evidence given by the guards (to some extent Inevitable in eye-witness accounts of a somewhat confused struggle taking place at night) render it undesirable to press a charge of assault. 6. While there seems little doubt that the main facts of the incident were as set forth In paragraph four above and that the action by the Americans in forcing an entry in to the refinery precincts and assaulting the guards cannot in any way be condonedj there is one observation which is prompted, by the Incident which, if not an extenuating circumstance relioving the Americans of blame, at least points to a possible means of avoiding a repetition of such Incidents. It is clear that in the case of Arab guards performing the duty of checking passes at the gate but not being able to speak more than a word or two of English, they will be bound to act most literally by 'cheir instructions. fiven whan capable by nature of exercising soae tact and discretion, they cannot exercise it by reason of the language difficulty. This is a danger factor which will not be evident so Iftng as instructions are obeyed in full and promptly by those persons wishing to enter the refinery but which will tend to reveal itself when any Incident out of the ordinary occurs, as in the present case. Where guards and the men whose passes they inspect speak different languages there will naturally be literal insistence on the obeying of orders, and, as a consequence, complete rigidity of procedure. Where the same language is spoken there will be some elasticity, some oive and take f Allowances will be made whereas in the case of language difficulty no variation is possible from rigid conformity to regulations.5 7. So long as there are some American personnel regularly entering the refinery precincts who may be expected to indulge on occasion In disorderly conduct, including perhaps drunkenness, and so long as such persons are civilians unac3U3toined to nili- tary discipline or indeed, perhaps, to any strict discipline, particularly jfis-a-vis foreign nationals whose position they may sometimes confuse with the position of people of similar race in their oim country, so long.will the placing on duty of Arab guards with powers of exercising control over such personnel present an element of danger. It is clearly desirable, without in any way condoning the action of the Americans on the present occasion, that the duties of checking the Identity of persons entering the refinery should be entrusted to Individuals ©f white race who speak the sane language as those v/hom they are expected to control. It is not suggested that any relaxation of strict security rules should be permitted. It is rscely sug gested that occasions will inevitably arise when the exercise of tact and discretion on the part of both guards and personnel will avoid trouble. The trouble laay be well deserved by those who infringe regulations, butyls obviously desirable to take all possible steps to avoid it, considering the special local circum stances of Bahrain and in the interests of preventing ill-feeling among certain sections of American personnel. Bahrain, 25th June 1944 6 f(, fUf*,rlLi-b Sfgmar - Jybroman we were five men in a Jeep and arrived outside the refineiy gate at about ID p.m. One of ug had no pp^s. 3\yo of us got down to explain to the guardc. I v/as the second to get down. Lloyd Kimble ^ot down first. He wonted to go to the telephone booth to have his pass brought and crossed the chain to do so. I got down on the rir;ht of the Jeep. One guard and Kimble were on the inside of the chain when the incident happened. I explained to the guard that I had a badge and it would be all right to let us in. Hie guard had not said much before he hit me. He had no :^in. He hit me with his left hand on the right side of the face. I hit him and knocked him dovm. I heard a click behind me and turned round. I saw a guard on my side of the chain just behind me. Kimble was near him with the guards rifle in his hand examining it. Kimble said it was not loaded. I then saw an Arab without a police head-dress come up with te) shoos, one in each hatfd. I do not know v/herc he came from. I made signs to him to drop the shoes. He looked threatening and did not put them down. I hit him a left and then a right. He stayed do van. I do not know whether the other men got do -n from the Jeep. I later heard Kimble say 'Come on, leVs get out of here'. Another man (I am not sure whether he i;as a policeman, I do not think he had police headgear on ) came with a gun. I did not know whether this was the gun Kimble had seized. I tried to take the gun of ? him. I took hold of t o gun. I could not use it. I!ie guard still kept hold of the strap of the gun. finally I got hold of the gun and then I dropped it. Biere were other Arabs around. About half a dozen of then had long sticks. One stick was about 6 feet lonr; and I was attacked with it. when I heard Kimble soy 'Let's get out', I made for the entrance but fell down short of the chain, inere were too many in my way struggling with mc. I got xsy back to the fence. I protected n^rself with a piece of board which was v/ired to the fence. I raached the Jeep and f;ot into the driver^ scat and there heard Monty say 'Get this started'. Some men were in the Jeep v/hen I arrived. Guards were attacking us, one had a bayonet, he put the point of it on my arm. liie guards were using their belts, hitting with the buckle end. I was hit. Kimble was protecting me and r;ot more blows. As we were moving off I heard Monty say Bill was hit. Bill had actually fallen down and had a wound made by a stone in the middle of the back of his head. (tfe-examined) - I do not remember whether the guard said something or nothing when I v/as talking with him before he hit me. I do not think he said onytiiinr; but just hit me. I have never been more surprised in n$r life. NL i L u Y x ) L» KlLibLfJ - Craiionan . &gt; we arrived in the Jeep and stopped at the gate. I had no baflge. I did not know what the guard v;as saying to me. Usually the guards just say ,, number ,, . ! ls manner was sarcastic. I said I had no number. I was in the back seat. He seemed to refuse% entry. I stepped out in order to see the sergeant in the hut. I stepped across the cln in and then Miles Stewart^ said to the guard that we were cranemen just going in to eat. I thought Stewart appeared to loan on the chain, ilic same guard who asked me for ray number (the big est of them) hit Stewart and knocked his hat off. I do not think the guard said anything before he hit Stewart. I cannot remember if he did. I v/as two feet away. Stev/art said lf You son of a bitch, you hit mc M and knocked him down. Stewart then turned round to fend off ths second guard. I grabbed the gun and twisted it out of the guard*s hand and he dropped it. Stewart came over the chain. We were trying to parley with the guards. I still had the gun. Uiree or four more guards came up. Bie one I took the gun of- ran up and tried to grab the gun. I was holding it in one hand by the sling. ■Bie guards hit me. I hit a man who seized the sling. ii)re guards came and attacked us, 'jftie other men in the Jeep were not scrapping and still on the other side of the chain. The other men in the Jeep did not cross the chain, fcfcmin had the Jeep started when I came. I got into the Jeep, saw Stewart on the ground seventy feet away. I went back and crossed the chain to re-enter the refinery# ihere were some guards on the inside of the chain with bayonets, I scattered them but they hit me as I passed with the bayonets, I ran towards Stewart. Jive or six were attacking Stewart who was near the dispensary, vte ran for the Jeep, Stewart got into the drivers seat, tried to start it, 'Bie guards attacked us with belts until we started off, I do not remember the other fellows in the Jeep fighting at all. JIM feAMNKSS, I was driving and stopped the Jeep clorje to the chain. One guard asked for tteo numbers. He said 'Number ?' Kimble said he had left his bacfee behind on his shirt. He made signs to show the badge had been on his shirt, atie quards repeated •^fumber' 1 . I said^imble you*4 better call (telephone) for it'. He jumped out and went to the front of the Jeep. He stopped \ over the chain to get round the front of the Jeep, 'tfie guard fbllowed Kimble. Another guard came out of the guard hut, \ He had police head-dress. He was rather slender. Another came from the First Aid station. Stewart got out to talk to the first guard, Bie guard said something, Stewart said Something to him. I did not hear what he said, jflie guard hit him.

Memorandum: I forward herewith the fulD. report on the incident which took place at Manama on the 11th morning at 2.00 a.m. The Police night Patrol of 5 Policemen in the brothfcl area heard some shoutings and they proceeded to the place. There they found a Military 1 JEEP ' and one BAP CO Pick - up No. X-201 with 5 occupants. And four American Soldiers trying to enter by force into the houses of some prostitutes and break the outside door of the house of Fatima bint Ahmed. Immediately when the Police appeared the Americ ans came running to them and asked them to get them some women. The N.C.O. in Charge L/Naik Sayeed Habib persuaded them to return back to their homes as it was very late. They refused to do so but asked him to bring some prostitutes which he did not do. There upon they cought hold of him and started beating him causing him slight injury and a hard fist on his face tearing his shirt also. So with great difficulty he made his way out and ran away vrLth other Policemen. Then they were chased by one officer running after them while the others followed in the 1 JEEP 1 until they reached near the Masque in the centre of the town. Then the N.C.O. noticed him having a Torch Light and was lighting it on the house of Ibrahim Nunoo. He shouted to them to beheave well as it was a respectable residential quarter. They refused to do so, saying that there are better women here. Then again these Americans went in search of women when they met two Policemen L /Naik Jamsheer and Mubarak bin Gasab who persuaded them to beh^ave well. They both were beaten also and chased. The 'JEEP 1 remained chasing the Policemen in the streets and every one had to hide himself to a safe place till 3.oo a.m. The N.C.O. L /Naik Sayeed Habib states that one of them was an officer bearing one star on each side of shirt collor and carrying with him a revolver. And also another officer who had stars on his shoulders and says that he can identify both of them. ^ {&lt; . ^ .

C &amp; ^ Dear Sir, y S Please refer to your confidential letter No. D.O. ^ C/1181 dated 14th August, 1944 with regard to the employment of ex National Fire Service men from England as gate checkers at the Refinery. Immediately after the incident which occurred some time ago at the Refinery gate, the Company requested its New York office to engage and send to Bahrein eight men specially qualified to do policing work around Awali and the Refinery. I have been informed that these men have been engaged and are enroute to Bahrein. I am also informed that these men have had police experience in the States. In view of this and in view of the relatively short time (7 or 8 months) remaining before the completion of the project, I do not believe the Company would be interested in employing the men mentioned by you. In this connection I believe it would be preferable in any case to use American policemen to deal with the American construction men we have on the job since in so doing would ^ x tend to avoid any British/American friction which might other wise result. For your information, the Company some months ago placed an order for a photographing machine which would make plastic identification discs containing the employees' photo- graphs. These discs would be pinned to the employees' shirts and would be a great improvement over the present identification discs. This equipment is now enroute and upon its arrival we propose to make such identification discs for all of our employees, including local employees. The use of such discs containing photographs should do much to add to the security of the Refinery. The Company appreciates very much your bringing to their attention the possibility of hiring the National Fire Service men mentioned in your letter. Yours W. P. Anderson. Chief Local Representative.

As of 11 August, 1944, there v»s only one jeep stationed in Awali coming under a non-civilian classification. This was the U .S.Navy jeep belonging to this office. As it is painted a dark blue color, with 'U .S.Navy' in white on the sides, front, and back, it is virtually impossible for it to be confused with any other jeep on the island. 3. During the night of 10-11 August, the U.S.NaVy jeep vjas at all times within the limits of Awali. 4. As of 11 August there were three officers attached to this office: Lt. Comdr. E. F. Height Lt.Cjg) M.Smolak Lt.(jg) EJllbat During the night of 10-11 august, none of these officers left the limits of Awali. 5. Although not under the jurisdiction of this office, for information the only other officers or enlisted men in the U .S. Armed Forces in Awali during the night of 10-11 August were 1st.Lieut.Doyle of the Amy, stationed at Awali, and two visiting officers present with him on business. Investigation shows that none of these officers left the limits of Awali during the night in question. 6. On the night of 10-11 August, the only American ship in port was the 'JtLchardson', which arrived at 1700 on the 10th for bunkers, and departed at 0S00 on the 11th. Investigation shows that no one came ashore from this ship during the night in question. 7. For information, in the U.S.Armed Forces, stars are worn on the collar only by Generals, Admirals and Commodores. Stars are also worn on shoulder boards by other officers in the ^avy only, with certainunifoms. These stars are placed above stripes which are much more prtvinn a The shoulder boards themselves are of such prominence that the first element of description would be 'shoulder oards', the specific markings being a secondary description. These stars can not be detached to be worn directly on the shoulders. 8. The only 'revolver' in the possession of U.S.Mavy personnel ^t Awall is an automatic pistol locked in this office for possible emergencies. This pistol has not left the confines of this office during the month of August, 19/^4. CC! Mr. # P, Anderson General Manager Bahrein Petroleum Co., Ltd E. F. Height Lt.

Following are the results of our investigations into the incident described in the attachment to the above mentioned memorandum The Company possesses a pick-up bearing the number 1 x 201 and its use is assigned to the Bechtel-McCone Corporation. I asked Bechtel-McCone Corporation to check the movements of this car. They state that they have made a thorough check with Mr. William H, H a ckler, their Night Superintendent, who states that this pickup was seen by him at 2 a.m. on the morning of the 11th in front of the Mess Hall, having been parked there by a Mr. Jerry B. Romans, their Night Labour Foreman. Mr. Kackler further states that he instructed one of his employees, Mr. Budd L. Casey, to return the pickup to the Refinery where Jtjb was seen by him at various times during the balance of the shift. The B.M. Management state that they have no reason to doubt the authenticity of Mr. Hackler's statements. If these statements are true then either the number of the pickup or the date is in error.

Ho aold that h^ understood that the Foreign Office had statod that they wore not prepared to admit that American odlitary poraonnel had jurisdiction in Bahrain, I said I had no information on this point. I told him thf ti- (a) Although the eight Special Folic ocaen now beln^ enlisted by the Bahrain Potroleiun Company from ex civil police peraonnQl in the United States would probably be adequate for police work within w the Refinery and Awali areas they v/ould not constitute a suffi cient force for QDiploycaent elsewhere* I conciderad it ue ^ossary that eithor British or A-ncrlcan provost poi 'soimcl aliould be avail /?ble to deal with British or Amorlcan subjects who might cause a breach of the peace ouxside the precincts of the Bahrain Petroloufij ^otTinony. Z had suggested that American provost personnel be posted at Maharraq in conjunction with the where they would be available for employment in aid of the local civil police should the necessity occur but as that apparently was no longer to be hoped for It would, in my opinion, be desirable and more acceptable from some points of view if the Station ^o/nmander 1 s military police could be Increased to such on extent as to provide occasional patrols and a permanent reserve. Major Fox said that he thooMht thot this was very sound but i — he was afraid that until M ald to Husslo f, decreased thereby releasing British provost personnel it would not be possible for Paifor ^e to produce a suxflcloncy of men. He would discuss the matter when he returned to his Headquarters and would also suggest that the position with regard to the Navy might be clarified. I had told him that rap tain f&gt;hllllngton f R.N.V.B., the Kaval Of fie er-ln-rharge had recently refused to aid me in w dealing with five British merchant seamen on the grounds that the Kavy had no Jurisdiction or Interest in sailors ashore. /(b)r r .118 (b) In ariewer to a «7UGstion from Major Fox I said that I v was not satlafird with the present T &gt;osltlon of the special • « 4. police and strongly ttdvlaed thnt 'a Garrison 'ompany take their plnr-e.

I knew that His Highnoss looked on the amount his Oovernment paid as a • 1 • contribution to the war effort nnd I felt that it would be a pity if su^h a petty demand put forward on his behalf reduced w w the prestige whi ^h he had naturally acouired from his generous gifts to 7arious war funds. (d) I informed Major Fox that the position with regard to the Bahrain polire about whi^h he made enquiries was at the moment slightly unsatlsfartory but that I was pressing the Bahrain Government to give substonti^l increases in pay and I felt that the position would be much Improved within the next week or so. / 20-9-44♦Telegram S(D) From Political A^ent, Bahrain, fo Political Resident, at Shiraz, No. 871.

I agree that it is preferable that the extra police required should be provided from British sources. 3. The formation of a British section of the Bahrain Police appeals both to the Adviser with whom I have discussed the question and to me 0 I consider that with Bahrain^ ever increasing contacts with the West it will be necessary for there to be a permanent European section of the police and^Just as a temporary measure to cover the period smii of the Refinery construction. I suggest that steps be taken to recruit the men required immediately but if as is probable some tiire must elapse before they can arrive here PAIPORCE should be asked to make a temporary increase, for this period only in the Military Police under the Station Commander 4-» It is suggested that eight men be enlisted of whom one . could be appointed Inspector on arrival here and one a Sergeamt. the remaining* six being constables. Contracts might be for two years the first six months on probation for constables, and three years with the first six months on probation for the Inspector and Sergeant. This would allow an overlap when replacements were being recruited. It should be possible to house and ration the men with the Royal Air Force until materials become available to provide them With their own quarters and mess. 5 # I am not qualified to suggest rates of pay but those in force in Palestine might be appropriate. Perhaps the India Office could be asked to advise on this point and on what leave terms are desirable. 6. I suggest that the India Office be asked to enquire what the prospects are of obtaining suitable men. It is essential that the men should be trained in police work. 7. I consider and the Adviser agrees that the Bahrain Government should finance the scheme and that the men should form part of the Bahrain police.

Ext. 3502/44 9th August 1944. Dear Hankey, Would you please refer to the telegram from C .in .C Pa IC to the War Office, No. 0/27845 of 3rd August, on the subject of Provost personnel for Bahrain. In regard to General Connolly's recommendation referrred to under 'fifth' we assume that by the words 'qualified civilian police should be furnished by Home Office of Bapco' is meant the provision by B a PCO of qualified civilian police from Aineric ayl rather than the U.K. This seems most probable from the remark under 'sixth' regarding the desirability that Americans should control their own nationals. We would suggest that in the circumstances the best course would now be for the Foreign Office, if you agree, to approach the U.S. Government in support of General Connolly's recommendation as interpreted in the preceding paragraph. It should, ofcourse, be made clear that these American civilian police would derive their powers in Bahrain from their being enrolled as special constables by the Political Agent there, before whose court all offenders would be brought. It might also be suggested to the U.S. Government that in the event of it proving impossible to provide civil police from America in this war, U .S. Provost personnel instead should be sent to Bahrain, despite the difficulty regarding military jurisdiction over U.S. civilians. It could be explained that this difficulty might perhaps be overcome by enrolling the Provost personnel likewise as special constables under the Political Agent. I am sending a copy of this letter to Brigadier Calthorpe at the War Office, and Berthoud at the Petroleum Division. Yours sincerely. The Hon.R.M.A, Hankey, Foreign Office, S,W.I.28/50.

Do you think this will meet your requirements? Yours sincerely, / ^ /f-lli* ■ 0# Dalryaple Belgrave, Esq., C.B.E., Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain*Minutes of a meeting held at the Agency Wednesday the 4th of October, 1944. Present;- Major T. Hickinbotham, C.I.E., O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain. C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esq., C.B.S., Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain. Mr. Howard B. Nichols, Acting Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain Petroleum Co., Ltd., Bahrain. Mr. V/arden, The Bahrain Petroleum Co., Ltd., Bahrain, Special Police - Bahrain Petroleum Co., Ltd. The eight Special Policemen are expected to arrive today. Their records were read and they should prove exceptionally capable men. Mr. Warden will be liaison officer between the policemen and the General Management. The Company asked that they should be empowered as Special Constables for the Refinery and Awali areas, and that the question of giving them powers to deal with Refinery employees (American and British) in the Manama and Maharraq areas be considered. Mr. Nichols said that they proposed to withdraw the four B.M.P. Special Constables on the arrival of the new men but to continue the four Bahrain Petroleum Company men who would carry out their usual role in connection with the club. It was proposed to use the new men in connection with the gates at Sitra and also for general duties in Awali and Mr. Nichols enquired what their powers of arrest were. He was informed that they had powers of arrest exactly similar to those exercised by ordinary policemen and would be protected against civil actions for damages when acting in the execution of their duty. The amount of force which a policeman was entitled to use must be just sufficient to affect the arrest and no more. Should arrests be carried out then the Commandant of Police should be informed immediately and steps should be taken to see that the individual concerned was brought before a magistrate within 24 hours. In the case of Europeans and Americans the company would arrange to inform either the Polit ical A^ent or the Assistant /politicalPolitical Agent as well as the Commandant of police who would ensure that a European Magistrate visited the lock-up, which was understood to have been prepared by the station Commander and in which white prisoners should be confined, within the prescribed period of time. The Political Agent stated that lie wished to make quite clear the position with regard to counsel appearing in court. He stated that every person who appeared in court had a right to ■ legal assistance which could not be denied. Legal assistance was of two kinds, (a) persons who by right appear in court, and (b) persons who appear in court by consent of the presiding magis- trate or judge. As far as the Agency courts were concerned, all counsel who appeared iri court would come under category (b). It was only necessary for the accused to ask for an adjournment to obtain legal assistance for it to be granted. It was desirable | that the accused should inform the court of the name, qualifica tions, &amp;c., of the counsel he proposed to obtain locally or 'engage from abroad at the time he asked for the adjournment in order that consent to his appearance could be obtained immediately. Mr. Nichols complained that the company were suffering from a severe pilfering outbreak and asked whether the Bahrain Police could patrol the Sitra wharfs and barges at night. Ways and means were discussed and it was agreed that Mr. Belgrave would provide the police provided the company provided the transport in the form of a launch or launches. The question of dangerous driving on the Awali road was discussed and it was agreed that a speed limit should be intro duced on the open stretch of land between the palm trees and AwaQi and that the Bahrain police will take steps to prosecute persons exceeding the speed limit. With regard to the limiting of the nuiubers of persons which the Company^ transport could carry it was decided that provided the speed limit was strictly enforced it would probably hot be necessary. Mr. Nichols during the course of the discussion said that his company would accept liability for civil damages /in/5. in respect of their employees travelling in their vehicles. i 4. Mr. Belgrave stated that he did not consider that it would be proper to employ Bahrain Government police within the Company's precincts for the specific purpose of superintending their workmen entering lorries or drawing their pay. Mr. Nichols entirely agreed and said that they would now be able to undertake this work them selves. Mr. Eelgrave suggested that as regards supervision of the Company's workmen entering buses and lorries at Manama and Maharraq it would simplify matters if instead of loading at ARAMCO S house in Manama lorries took up passengers in front of the munici pal building where there was already a Natoor post. At Maharraq the natoors and the police were already on duty within a few yards of the loading point and could be instructed to ensure that order was maintained. up 5. The Political Agent brought^/the question of a reduction of fifty tons in the Bahrain wheat quota being made by the M.E.S.C. on the grounds that the company were rationing their employees and therefore the Bahrain Government need not be called upon to do so. He said that many practical difficulties would have to be overcome if the cut was to be agreed to. He asked if the Company could provide the Bahrain Government with immediate information of the number of their employees, their names, ration card numbers, and the dates of joining their employment and when they were dis charged. Mr. Nichols seemed to consider that it could be done but only with the greatest difficulty and promised to look into the matter. At the same time the Political Agent enquired from the tto Adviser whether there has been an increase in the popula- \ ^ tion since the quota was fixed as it seemed to him that many work men and their families had recently arrived from abroad and that if this was so then far from agreeing to a cut we should have to press for an increase in the quota. Mr. Belgrave intimated that they proposed to hold a census during the coming winter but that he would endeavour to give a very rough estimate of the increase in population which he ^aid had undoubtedly occurred.* ' ' ■The question of the provision of food supplies for Indian employees on contract was then discussed and it transpired that the Conpany had been informed by their New York Office that both shipping space and provisions were available in the United States but that export permission would not be forthcoming unless the Company could produce evidence to show that India and the United Kingdom had both declined or not been able to produce the goods. The Political Agent suggested that Mr, Nichols should inlorm him of the position and the approximate tonnage required and that he would then endeavour to obtain the necessary refusals by telegram.
