Yours faithfully, (bga./ iVt, U.V &lt;v a.s. of s., ' Mr.Zinnow of Messrs. Wonckhaus called on September 3rd, to follow up the interview which Mr.Guest had with Sir Findlater Stewart a little time back. The notes which were prepared for Sir P.Stewart are attached but the Department is not aware of what passed at the interview. I explained to Mr. Zinnow that the Under Secretary was away and that I could only report what he had to say. I informed him, however, that so far as the Department could say it was exceedingly unlikely that it would be possible for either H.M.G. or the Government of India to consider making any payment (which he agreed would in any circumstances be an ex gratia payment) after so long a period of time. Mr.Zinnow said that he entirely appreciated the difficulties of the case and he would not press it except that he thought one point,which he fancied had not been put by Mr.Guest to Sir P.Stewart, ought to be taken into consideration, namely, the many benefactions which the Beit family - his relations on his mother’s side - had made in this country. He said that this point/I 2 . point was brought out in the memorandum which he left with me (in the envelope below). His idea apparently is that since the Beits had done so much for this country H.M.G. might favourably consider the present He explained that the reason for reviving the claim at this late date was the fact that he was now without resources and had a family at University age. Mr.Zinnow said he was just off to Hamburg and I promised to send him a line when it had been possible to submit the matter for orders. 1 LT IHDIA OFFICE» mmsmiL, i* Z th Septomber, 19 Dear Sir, With reference to car interview an September 4th and your letter of September 13th t I have now had &amp; copy made of the papers which yoa left with me and have sent the originals, as you request* to Messrs.

Wonckhaus's claim in Abu Musa oxide. 629 IPri /&gt; j respect of Sir F. Stewart, Please see Mr. Laithwaite's notes below. Before the war negotiations took place with Messrs. Wonckhaus on the question of pecuniary compensation to them for loss due to the interruption of their contract for purchasing red oxide from the concessionaire^. The question of compensation was left pending at the outbreak of war. Any legal claim is presumably barred by the Treaty of Versailles, Art. 439 of which (copy attached) seems prima facie to be applicable. The only question that could arise would appear to be that of an ex gratia payment. This, as Mr. Laithwaite says, might prove an awkward precsdent, and it would seem almost hopeless to get either the G. of I. or H.M.G. to agree to such a payment after so long a period of time. JClJTreaty of Versailles. XXX Article, .4&amp;S- Without prejudice to the provisions of the present Germany undertakes not to put forward directly or indirectly against any Allied or Associated Power, signatory of the present Treaty, including those which without having declared war, have broken off diplomatic relations with the German Empire, any pecuniary claim based on events which occurred at any time before the coming into force of the present Treaty. The present stipulation will bar completely and finally all claims of this nature, which will be thenceforward extinguished, whoever may be the parties in interest.Mr. Walton, 4 I attach a short note about the Wonckhaus red oxide compensation* The history of this case in the political Science Quarterly is very interesting and, broadly speaking, not too far off the mark. On the date of the outbreak of the War Messrs.Wonckhaus had taken up their position on the basis of compensation in the neighbourhood of £10,000, while l*JL *■ u* cZ Co*** ^ H.M.G. thought that £2,000 would be adequate and £3,000 generous. There is thus a considerable gap between the two estimates. The question whether India or the Home Government should pay the whole compensation had also not been finally decided, or indeed investigated in any detail, though Mr. shucfturgh in 1914 took the view, which was not disputed by the Secretary of State, HoIderness, ^hat the vtfiole burden wouldrfall on India. Mr. Wonckhaus was unlucky in this transaction. Both before and during the War his conduct was directed by consideratiorB of German interests (and his own) and I do not think there has been any suggestion that at any time he played unfairly. But I cannot help feeling that/that any proposal give him an ex gratia grant, hard as his case may he, may raise rather difficult questions, more particularly as British subjects (and in particular tiie Railway Syndicate) have suffered severe losses in Persia during the War, with no chance in some cases'of receiving any and in others of I receiving adequate compensation for their losses. The ex gratia repayment to the Sheikh of tohammerah which India recently agreed to share is in quite a different category. I should have thought that the Foreign Office would have been most reluctant to share any portion of a grant to Herr Wonckhaus and that it might well, if it became known (as would he not improbable) involve us in embarrassing claims from other quarters.NOTE , RED OXIDE ON ABU WSA . r -\ A concession, subsequently approved by the ruling Sheikh, was granted in April 1898 by the Regent of shargah to certain Arabs. On 1st June 1906 one of those Arabs entered into a contract with Herr Wonckhaus to sell him from 2,000 t© 5000 tons of red oxide annually for a period of four years from the date of the contract. On 21st February 1907 the Sheikh of Shargah cancelled the concession on the ground, inter alia , that the concessionaire in question had entered into his contract with Herr Wonckhaus without the Sheikhas approval. Herr Wonckhaus appealed to the German Government and a lengthy dispute ensued which was on the point of settlement at the outbreak of the War. 2. npfliQftEy After considerable $&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;£&amp;&gt; discussion, it was agreed that Y/onckhaus and Co. had cause for complaint, though H.M.G. never admitted that the Sheikh had not acted within his full rights. After further considerable preliminary discussion the firm in September 1913 agreed to abandon their case on the understanding that H.M.G. would refund their direct losses to them. They claimed an average sale price of 65s/- per ton for red oxide, or an average net profit of 35s/3d and it appeared that they had in all shipped 3,210 tons (or possibly 3,610 tons) of red oxide from Abu Musa as against the 8 000 to 20,000 which they were entitled to ship during the ■ four years of their contract. The Board of Trade held, however, that the Company were entitled to compensation only in respect of the amount that might have been shipped during the unexpired period of the contract at the minimum contract/&amp; - a - contract rate of 2-,000 tons per annum, i.e. for 2§ years 5,3332 ^ 0I1S * O n 5asis of a selling price of 65s/- per ton and an average profit per ton of 33s/3d the finn would have demanded £9,666. 3. 4. 3. The matter was investigated in detail hy the Board of Trade and H.JvuG. with the assistance of tessrs. Strick and son, who, being themselves interested in the trade, were in a position to advise commercially. As a result the Board of Trade on 10th June 1914 expressed the view that a sum of £1,863. 6. 8 or, in round figures , £2,000, might not unreasonably be offered to Messrs- Wonckhaus in settlement of all their claims. 'Nevertheless as an act of grace, and to give Messrs. Wonckhaus the most complete satisfaction, the Board are disposed to suggest that this sum might be raised to £3,000. 'This would assume a selling price for Abu Misa oxide a little short of 45/- per ton - a price which, according to the facts set out above, Abu Misa oxide, if sold in considerable quantities, could never have realised; and it would assume an average net profit per ton of over 30&amp; on the cost price, as compared with Mr. Strick's outside estimate of 20%.' 4. The Foreign Office, in the light of the qualifications attached to the Board of Trade opinion, suggested that it would be preferable in the first instance to offer a sum of £2,000, and the India Office, while doubtful as to whether Messrs. Wonckhaus would accept this sum, agreed, on 20th July 1914 the Board of Trade were asked by the Foreign Office to prepare a memorandum for the German Embassy setting forth the arguments and the grounds on which £1850 might b e regarded as adequate compensation for all the losses suffered by Messrs. Wonckhaus.3 The natter rested at tills stage at the outbreak of the War, 6 As regards the incidence of cost, a caveat was officially entered in a letter to the Foreign Office lump sum In compensation in 1913 that the question of the division of the cost of any sum paid to Messrs. Wonckhaus between Imperial and Indian revenues would be considered later. The departmental minutes of July 1914 on the paper in which the India Office concurred in the proposal to offer £2,000 to the firm in the first instance in final settlement remarked “Indian revenues will presumably have to bear the whole cost of compensatirg the firm*. 7* The position is thus briefly that we recognised in principle that the firm's claim for compensation was a reasonable one and that H.M.G. were proposing to offer a lump sum payment of £2,0Q0(fHrTuri compensation, but that the firm were not unlikely to have claimed compensation much more closely approximating to £10,000. Had the discussion not been interrupted by the War it would not improbably have been necessary to resort to arbitration by commercial experts with a view to reaching a decision as to the payment to be made by H.M.G. But it will be seen that £2*000 was regarded as an entirely adequate and £3,000 a generous figure by the Board of Trade after the closest investigation of all the circumstances and commercial factors in the case with the assistance of Messrs. Strick. at the stage when Messrs. W)nckhaus agreed to accept aSTATEMENT The Writer of this Statement, Mr.Gustav ZINNOW, a partner in the firm of Robert WONCKHAUS &amp; Co., 54 Neuerwall, Hamburg, Germany, is a nephew of the late Mr.Alfred Beit anu. the late Sir Otto Beit, Bart, of London, his late mother having been a sister of the two d eceased gentlemen. The Case Mr.Zinnow is referring to in this State is the so-called 'Abu Musa' Case, which from 1907 to 1914 was a matter of Diplomatic Correspondence and exchange of Memoranda between the British and the German Foreign Office. Shortly before the outbreak of the war His Majesty^ Government in a Memorandum addressed to the Berlin Foreign Office and given in copy herewith had declared its willingness to facilitate the attainment of a settlement in the form of compensation for the damage done to Messrs.Robert Wonckhaus &amp; Co. on account of the interruption of their business, and had asked for a Statement of the firm 1 s claim:- Owing to the outbreak of the World War the negotiations already entered into, naturally came to a standstill and never have/been taken up after that time. The various Memoranda exchanged between the two Governments as the Writer is informed, are lying with the India Office, London. During the year 1913 upon the request of Baron von Grunau of the German Foreign Office, the firm had worked out a complete Account of their losses sustained in that affair, of which a copy in German and in English is given herewith, showing the total of the compensation the firm thought itself entitled to at Mark 446,000. - to which sum the interest from 1907 to the day of payment was to be added* This figure, as the Writer is informed, has before the war already been mentioned to the British Foreign Office/ Jmmmm a Office and it was practically certain that a settlement at ^ such a figure plus interest would he arrived at* In order to recollect the Case, a short Statement of what actually happened is given herewith as follows* The Sheikh of SHARGAH, whose Territory the Island of ABU MUSA was, had conceded to three Arabs, two of which, father and son, resided at Lingah, the right to exploit the Iron Oxyde of Abu Musa, and in 1907 two of them transferred their rights to work the mines to the firm of Robert Wonckhaus &amp; Co*, which at once prepared to start operations* At this stage the Sheikh cancelled the concession, evidently influenced by the English, who had a Treaty dating from 1892 with him and other Arab Chiefs to the effect that he would enter no relations with any Government, but Great Britain and would dispose of none of his land to any other power* Robert Wonckhaus &amp; Co. took no notice of the Sheikh’s revocation of the concession* In October 1907 the British Warship 'LAPWING” appeared at Aba Musa, towing a number of sailing boots loaded with a few 100 armed Bedouins* The men disembarked seized the workers employed by the firm and removed them to Lingah* Two hours later, when a representative of the firm arrived, he was fired upon but luckily not killed, by these same native warriors* Messrs* Robert Wonckhaus &amp; Co. promptly protested to the German Government, which through the Embassy in London passed on this protest to the British Government. The exchange of long Memoranda began and dragged on, was postponed and re-postponed, until finally some months before the outbreak of the war His Majesty’s Government agreed in principle that the Wonckhaus firm was entitled to compensation, the determination of the actual amount was further postponed* Then the war broke out and in the end Messrs.Robert Wonckhaus &amp; Co. received no compensation at all* All/Wl ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■I HBBHRHHHHHMHHHHHHHHHHH li 3« All the papers referring to the Ahu Musa Case are at India Office, as stated above and the question up to date is still unsettled. The two remaining partners of the Wonckhaus firm, Mr.Robert Wonckhaus, and the Writer, Mr.Gustav Zinnow, are perfectly aware that the firm 1 s claimis superannuated. The British Government of course is under no obligation towards the firm, except perhaps a moral one, for reasons to be explained below# The Wonckhaus firm, before the War a flourishing and prospering house, during the war lost nearly all of its substantial capital and has received a very small percentage of its losses in compensation from its own Government in spite of the stipulation of the Versailles Treaty. The firm furthermore in accordance with that Treaty for many years was prevented of entering its former field of operations the Persian Gulf, after the War, and after establishing itself under great difficulties in Northern Persia has sustained such heavy new losses through inflation ana other Government measures, that for good two years ago they had to retire from Persia and Mesopotamia. The firm therefore through the intermediate of its partner Mr.Gustav Zinnow is forced to appeal to His Majesty^ Government to grant permission to the firm to take up the old negotiations for compensation for the fb f lowing moral reason: Mr.Zinnow*s late Uncle, Mr.Alfred Beit, one ot the Pioneers in South Africa, in his Will opened after his death on July 16th 1906, as per specification herewith, left more than £1,815,000.- solely for educational and charitable purposes in the British Dominions. The Writer most respectfully begs to appeal to His Majesty’s Government to grant/4 grant to the nephew of this man the right of taking up the old negotiations in London again with the result of coming to an Agreement, by which the compensation practically fixed before the outbreak of the war in a way seeming fair to His Majesty’s Government would yet be granted to Messrs*Robert Wonckhaus &amp; Co. The amount today, interest included, would work out to well over Mark 2,000,000.- The firm, represented by Mr.Zinnow, who is at present in London staying at the 'Waldorf Hotel, Aldwhych, London, W.C.2, respectfully asks to be brought together with the competent Authority, in order to discuss such possibilities. The future of Mr.Zinnow’s children is also greatly at stake, as owing to the present Arian law so acute in Germany, they will have great difficulties as regards their future and probably will be forced later on to make their living abroad. The firm neither before nor after the War has ever mixed itself into politics contrary to accusations made. They were a pure business concern, which Mr.Wonckhaus, who more than once had the intention of placing his firm under British protection, had worked up most energetically from the start in the Gulf in 1898. When Mr.Zinnow entered the firm, the late Sir Otto Beit, Bart., K.C.M.G., then Mr.Otto Beit, for a period of 10 years lent him £50,000.-.-, which amount together with Mr.Zinnow’s own capital, went into the firm and was paid back, including interest accumulated for the period of the war, in 1920 in full. This to prove that the bulk of the firm’s money was of British origin and it might be of interest that when Mr.Wonckhaus in his capacity as Honorary German Consul at Bassorah, was ordered shortly after the outbreak of the war by the German Government to do all in his power to destroy the Anglo Persian Oil Wells in Southern Persia, he refused to do so, declaring such enterprise a most foolish thing, to which he would not lend his hand and promptly/EXTRACT from the late Mr.Alfred Beit’s Will Date of death: July 16th 1906 College for Technology in cash also 5000 Deheers prefs.

Early in 1914 a Conference took place at the Foreign Oiiice, London, in the presence of Baron von Kuehlmann and Mr. Thomas Brown, a partner of Robert Woenckhaus &amp; Co. It was then agreed that Robert Woenckhaus &amp; Co. should renounce their right to work the Mine altogether and present a statement of their claim for compensation to His Majesty’s Government. After receipt of this statement the matter was to be referred to the Board of Trade for examination and after the amount of compensation having been fixed by that Board, the sum arrived at to be paid over to Messrs.Robert Woenckhaus &amp; Co. The negotiations subsequently were stopped by the outbreak of the War.Copy of last Memorandum of the British Foreign Office end of 1913. 1. His Majesty’s Government, recognising the desire of Messrs. Wonckhaus for some compensation on account of the interruption of their business as the result of the 'inability of Hassan Samaiya' to carry out his contract with them, are willing to facilitate the attainment of that object. They would accordingly suggest that the firm should be asked to submit through the German Government a Statement of their claim under this head. As to the amount of the losses so incurred, His Majesty's Government have so far received no precise information. 2. Recognising further the desire of the firm to be restored as far as possible to the commeidal position which they occupied at the moment when their operations were interrupted, His Majesty's Government will use their influence with the Sheikh of Sharga to procure from him the grant of a new concession to suitaole persons to continue the working of the mines, and will endeavour to arrange that the contract of June 1st, 1906, should oe allowed to run for a further period equal to that during which it was interrupted. That period was irom Octooer 10th 1907 to June 1st 1910. The contract might, -tor example, run from May 1st next to December 31st 1914. If Messrs. Wonckhaus are reinstated in their contract as here proposed, the only lossustained by them under head /l/ would appear to be those due to the delay in receiving their profits on account oi the interruption of the working of the mines. It should be explained that in spite of any clause contained in the present contract, the parties shall not be bound after its expiration, to conclude any new agreement. 3./</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00018c_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/121</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00018c</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/121</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>PZ 7629/1934 ‘Messrs Wonckhaus’s claim in respect of Abu Musa oxide’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1934/1935</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-11-08T22:03:28</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (29 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate reverse chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the first folio with 1 and terminates at the last folio with 29; these numbers are written in pencil, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains correspondence and other papers relating to the claim of Robert Wonkhaus and Company, Hamburg, for financial compensation for loss due to the interruption of their contract for purchasing red oxide at Abu Musa from a concessionaire, following the cancellation of the concession by the Shaikh of Shargah [Sharjah].
