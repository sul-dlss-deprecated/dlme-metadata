These affairs follow on from a special mission on which Pelly had accompanied Lord Lytton (Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 2nd Baron Lytton) in an attempt to prevent what would become the second Anglo-Afghan War (1878-1880). Also discussed are matters relating to the Indian Frontier and the India Office, the work of Lord Lytton as Viceroy, and Lord Salisbury's (Robert Gascoyne-Cecil) work since leaving the India Office.Personal matters discussed in the correspondence include Burne's wife Evelyne's illness and subsequent death in April 1878, their attempts at meeting up with each other in both London and Bournemouth and matters relating to his brother George William Burne.Cover note (folios 1-2) states that the file contains correspondence from Sir Owen Tudor Burne, Lord Lytton and Lord Salisbury 1877-1878. The correspondence from Lord Lytton and Lord Salisbury was removed from the file at the request of Lady Amy Pelly in 1924.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Owen Tudor Burne</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Cabul</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Afghanistan</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001524.0x00037d#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001524.0x00037d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
