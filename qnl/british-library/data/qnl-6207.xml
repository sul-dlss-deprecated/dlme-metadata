(Confidential), dated I8th March 1924. IW 1 h T wuiA'f'T T t0 r ?I &gt;ort ’- for t}le mfom!ati on of the Government of India that on the 16th March I paid a visit to Muscat in the course of which I paid a farewell call on His Highness the Sultan, in the course of which a variety of subjects was discussed. 01 * fron^nw 16 1 * 1 ! 6 Politic T a I , . Agent had told me that since his return 1 ^ , Db i’ f * t ] le ,® nd ? f . January His Highness had frequently enquired when might be expected to visit Muscat as he had a communication to make to me • he would not however say anything to the Political Agent on the subject. I con- exnected y b expect n il]S H !S hness to say something of a confidential nature, and expected he would raise tne question of his abdication again. , ,, 3 -, Aftera good deal of conversation about his stay in Hholar and the nature f that province and its inhabitants, His Highness came to his confidential com munication. At first he dilated a good deal on the worries and troubles of govern ment, saying that he had no desire to rule, etc , and I thought he would definitely heaVilTT 1 ,? 16 ld °? ° f abdlcat “g&gt; 80 1 said tia t I toped he would continue to hear the burden and carry on the government until his son became old enouoh to ‘ ak e over the reins. His Highness said that he would, and I then gathered'that what he wanted to say was not so much the question of abdicating as of obtaining Government s recognition of his son as his successor. I reminded His Highness ^^^^^^oo®twi^h^^lread^beei^ai^before Government who had decided that they could not officially recognize his son as successor. I added that in such cases my own prac tice was to recognize informally as heir the son or other relative recognized by the character &lt; or b' 8 Til 1 ?° Ught Gov e mm ent took the same line unless the character or behaviour of the heir was such as to prevent their doing so : I felt sure that Government granted the same amount of informal recognition of his son ^ayyid Saeed as they had done in his own case when his father the late Sultan this* 1 C0USldered um tfle belr - Hls Highness seemed perfectly satisfied with 1 4 * * * ; Hi j Hig \ ness then y enfc on t0 sa 7 that he could find no suitable person in 1 he state to advise him in reforming the administration, and keeping the finan.es rai ght, when he was present at Muscat, and when he was not present to galvanize the Council of Ministers into life. His Highness said that the members of the fchou | h 1 ve jy worfcii y Persons, were absolutely useless as administrators, apart from which they would never come to a decision about any matter even unimportant questions, and persisted in leaving everything over to await his return. In this I cordially agree, though, of course, I did not say so. Hls High ness said that he wanted to get an Englishman who would advise him when^in Muscat and during his absence “ run ” the Council of Ministers. Would Govem- inent give him a man ? I said I thought it might excite unfavourable comment if Government actually appointed an officer as Wazir or Finance Member of the Council which was what I thought he required. I thought it better that I or rather my successor should make enquiries and see if a suitable man could be found, f so he could visit His Highness at Dehra Dun (where he intends to go at the begin ning of May for about five months), and His Highness could see if he liked the ap- pheant and if his temperament and conduct seemed suitable ; if so His Highness could bring him back when he returned in October under contract as Financial Adviser with the prospect of becoming Minister of Finance if he proved suitable and worked satisfactorily. After some discussion His Highness said that if a suit able man presented himself he could engage him as Secretary in India and see how he shaped, whether his manners and treatment of Orientals seemed likely to satisfy Arabs, etc.; if so he would bring the man up. I said that I thought that to attract a suitable man it would be necessary to offer at least Rs. 1,500 but more probably Ks. 2,000 per mensem with house and travelling allowance, etc., and added that this would be a severe strain on the finances of the Muscat State. His Highness agreed and said that if only he could secure a suitable man he would gladlv pav M0680FD ! ^ ^2 half his pa y up to R s. 1.000 a month from the privy purse. I said this was a generous otter and I thought that the State Treasury could easily bear the other half. While on the subject of the State Finances and the existing stringency, His Highness stated that he would be glad to refund half his monthly allowances to the State during his stay in India, and live there on Ks. 5.000. 1 said this was a very gene rous otter on His Highness’ part and would go far to rehabilitating the State finances. His Highness then said that on his voyage up from India about a year ago he had met an officer who had seemed to him to be a very suitable person. He was then or had recently been employed in the Iraq Customs Department, he could not remember the officer’s name but believed he had his visiting card somewhere if he could find it. I said that if he could find and send me the visiting card or the officer's name I would endeavour to trace him and ascertain if he was suitable and qualified to undertake the job, and willing to take service \Hth the Muscat State ; and let His Highness know the result. 5. We then had some conversation as to wha t the position of the English Mem- her of the Council would be vis a vis His Highness’ brother Saiyid Nadir ; I was inclined to think it would be very difficult but His Highness thought he could easily arrange matters so that their relations would be on a satisfactory footing. His Highness said that Saiyid Nadir’s sole idea was to avoid responsibility and put everything off till the Sultan’s return, he thought that if Saiyid Nadir found he had a colleague who would take responsibility and do things he would be only too glad to leave matters in his hands. 6. I think the Sultan’s proposal, in the form it emerged from this conversation, to try and find a suitable Englishman who would take service with him and run the State finances is a good one. His Highness harped a good deal on his desire only to do what was right in the eyes of the British Government, and said he parti- cnlnVlv wished to avoid getting an Englishman who w ou l d ii^g.^urk cordially with the Political Agent; he wanted a man who w T ould be guide a by tlie Political’Agent’s advice when necessary and who would guide his policy on lines agreeable to the British Go\ eminent. 7. Should a suitable man be found and engaged as Finance Member of the Council, it will of course be unnecessary for the Ccmmandant of the Levy Corps — to be Financial Adviser. It se( ms possible that Captain Alban, the present Com mandant, will shortly be given another appointment. If so I think that his succes sor might be simply Commandant of the Lev} Corps and his staff pay reduced to, say, Rs. 400 per mensem. If His Highness s( i ds me the card of the officer he met last year I will endeavour to trace him ; if net I propose to make enquiries with a view to finding a suitable man. If one is found I will instruct him to visit the Sultan at Dehra Dun. If the Sultan approves of him it would be easy for His Highness in consultation with the Political Agent, who could if necessary visit His Highness while on recess, to make a suitable contract. ■2(25) Letter from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, No. 567-S.(Confidential), dated the 11th October 1924. With reference to my letter No. 418-S., dated the 20th July 1924 [Ser. (16)], I have the honour to forward for the information of the Government of India a copy of letter No. 1262, dated 12th September 1924, from the Political Agent, Muscat, giv ing cover to a half-yearly statement of the Muscat State finances. It is satisfactory to note a strain of optimism in this report, however momen tary it may be, which has been so unfortunately lacking in the reports of the past few years. Coming as it does on the eve of Mr. Bower s arrival in Muscat, it augurs well, I trust, for the success of his efforts. Since the despatch of my last report on the subject in July last [Ser.(16)], I have not been able to visit Muscat, but hope to do so in a few weeks’ time. In the meantime every endeavour is being made both by Major Hinde and the officials of the Muscat Government to avoid a deficit. If the estimate of the Finance Depart ment of the revenue for the latter half of the year can at all be relied upon, there is reason to hope that they will be successful. Letter from the Political Agent and His Majesty’s Consul, Muscat, to the Hon ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, No. 1262, dated 12th September 1924. I have the honour to forward, herewith, the customary half-yearly statements of the Muscat State finances showing the actual revenue and expenditure under the Budget heads for the first six months of the year and the estimated expenditure for the remainder of the year. 2. On the face of them the statements appear to be satisfactory- 1 —more satis factory than for several years back—but I am not certain that the Finance Depart ment of H. H. s Government has not on the crest of a wave of optimism estimated the revenue for the latter half of the year at rather a high figure. - However if the figures are a fair estimate Muscat stands to have a surplus of revenue over expenditure for the whole year of something approaching three quarters of a lakh of rupees. 3. I will now proceed to comment on the various items on the revenue side. Actual revenue from the Customs seems to have worked out fairly accurately to the estimate but it should be remembered that of the four big consignments of rice from India which arrive yearly three have already come and we only expect one more. To balance this w~e have had one oil ship in this month and expect another shortly. I should say the receipts for Muscat are slightly below what they ought to be and those for Matrah about correct. Gwadur has produced its quota but there is no doubt we are losing heavily on the outlying customs. This however is a political matter and is being taken up separately. The landing revenue has increased considerably and this of course argues a/n increase of trade but the item itself does not improve the position as all but a veiy small percentage is paid out again to the Contractor. Zakat revenue is all payable in the second half of the year the amount already received representing arrears from last year. Quarantine shows a considerable decrease but here again the latter half of the year should be more profitable as many people return to Muscat in August and September. The Miscellaneous item includes rents from Government gardens, hire of the stone quarry, municipal taxes in Matrah, Beit al Mai, passport and court fees and other minor sources of revenue. It is a difficult one to estimate and on going into the figures it appears to me we have been unduly optimistic to the extent of some Rs. 5,000. This revenue is collected practically entirely in the latter half of the year and I shall have an opportunity of commenting on and explaining it then. The dollar still keeps up and a small increase has been registered on this account. Sahar Revenue is a new item. It was included under Sahar Customs before and represents the income from the Government lands in the vicinity of that place. As it is the first year it has been made a separate item. I presume w e must 72 ■ * 8 excuse the Finance Minister for being so much out in his estimate which shows a probable loss of nearly Rs. 9,000. 4. There are not many comments to make on the expenditure side. The deaths of one or two of the Ruling Family will result in a slight saving on that item. Sayud Saeed has not spent quite as much up till now as usual and the administra tive charges show a decrease of over Rs. 1,000 due mainly to Sahar being differently accounted for as explained above. Customs contingencies are down at present by a considerable sum due mainly to repairs to buildings not having been carried out; Military expenditure shows a saving of Rs. 8,000—in part due to the saving on the Commandant’s pay during the period between Captain Alban’s departure and the arrival of Captain Eccles and partly to less capital expenditure during the first half of the year on equipment, etc., for the Muscat Infantry. There is also a small saving on the pay of the personnel as numbers have been cut down to nearly two hundred. Miscellaneous and Sahar both show up badly. The remarks on these items as appeared on the revenue side apply here also. Zakat claims have been extinguished and this item will not appear in future. The Police scheme has fallen through and will not be proceeded with for the present. 5. The position under the prevailing conditions is not too unsatisfactory but as the statements show we are living entirely from hand to mouth and the effect of abolishing the post of Financial Adviser has not yet been felt. The Minister of Finance, Sayed Mahomed bin Hamad is completely illiterate and any accurate arit hmetical statement is entirely beyond him but I have had considerable assistance from Iskander Effendi, the Egyptian Director of Customs and also from Syed Liaqat Ali, the Treasury Officer. The former has been a tower of strength since he became Director and it is safe to say that without his energy and probity of character the entire customs fabric, and with it the main revenue of the State, would collapse. 6. In conclusion I may say that provided the price of dates keeps up and nothing untoward happens Muscat should be able to carry on (but with no margin for emergencies) until the proposed new arrangements for administration come into force.Letter from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, No. 418-S. (Confidential), dated the 20th July 1924. With reference to your memorandum No. 749-X., dated the 17th April 1924 fSer. (13)], I have the honour to forward herewith for the information of the Government of India a copy of letter (No. C.-15-R., dated 9th June 1924) from the Political Agent, Muscat, on the subject of the finances of the Muscat State. 2. Since my arrival in April last I have had no opportunity of visiting Muscat or of consulting the Political Agent at length on the difficult question of the State finances. 3. As far as I am able to judge from a perusal of the records the view of the situation taken by Major Hinde in his letter is a reasonable though admittedly un favourable one. It is evident that unless means are found to increase the revenues the Muscat State will be insolvent in a very short time. 4. Of the proposals, both for reduction of expenditure and increase of revenue, hitherto submitted to the Government of India and provisionally accepted by them in your memorandum under reference, the attempted increase in Excise licenses. Municipal and Camel Taxes has produced an almost insignificant result; the reduc tion of the Sultan’s privy purse has proved impracticable—the proposal [Ser. (12)] having been made under a misapprehension; the reduction of the Muscat Levy Corps below a strength of 200 appears inadvisable owing to the Sultan’s entire dependence on it for authority of any sort outside the local limits of Muscat town, and finally Mr. Bower’s deputation or the appointment of a British Officer as Finance Member of the Muscat Council can hardly be expected to produce any immediate result in the required direction. 5. It is very unfortunate that circumstances beyond our control have prevent ed us till now from finding a suitable Financial Adviser for the State. 6. We would have been delighted to have Mr. Bower last January, but he could not postpone his leave to England. The Sultan asked [Ser. (12)] in March for a Mr. Murray of Iraq ; we were told in April that this officer was medically unfit. We were then offered by Sir H. Dobbs a Mr. Monk, Director of Customs at Basra who however could only join in November. Then Sir A. T. Wilson recommended to qs a Mr. B. S. Thomas, O.B.E., now Assistant British Representative in Trans- Jordania, who could reach Muscat for duty about September next. This gentle man has taken short leave from Amman and has interviewed me. He is now in India where he will see the Sultan and Major Hinde. He was formerly a District Revenue Officer in Iraq and has a very good reputation as an all-round capable man. Unfortunately he has done no Customs work. 7. I was expecting to be in a position in a few days’ time to submit to you Mr. Thomas’ name as the most suitable candidate for Muscat we can find. In the meantime, however, I have received your telegram No. 749-X., dated the 11th July 1924 [Ser. (15)] offering Mr. Bower’s services from 1st December. I am discussing this proposal with the Political Agent and will telegraph my views very shortly. 8. Major Hinde has deprecated Mr. Bower’s deputation “ on the ground of insufficient scope.” I am inclined to think that the Political Agent may be under estimating the possibilities of improvement which a Customs expert can devise, and that if Mr. Thomas can retain his present appointment at Amman until, say, next April, it will be most advantageous that we should entrust the re-organization of the Customs at least to Mr. Bower, and then employ Mr. Thomas—if in the meanwhile he has found favour with the Sultan—to carry on the good work.2 Enclosure. Confidential. Copy of a letter from Major R. G. Hinde, LA., Political Agent, Muscat, (on recess), to Secretary to the Political Resident in ths Persian Gulf, No. C.-15-R., dated Srinagar, the 9th June 1924. I have the honour to refer to your endorsement No. 254-S., of the 2nd May 1924, covering a copy of the Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department's memorandum No. 749-X., dated Simla, the 17th April 1924 [Ser. (13)]. 2. I presume that, as the view of the Government of India as expressed in the above-quoted memorandum is labelled provisional, it is liable to modification and, therefore, I propose to reiterate my previous views that, failing the Government of India refusing entirely to entertain the ideas of remitting the repayment of the loan for five years or increasing the Sultan’s subsidy, the only real remedy for Muscat's financial ills is to arrange for an increase in the Customs Duty. The other economic proposals are really merely palliatives and do not strike at the heart of the problem. 3. I will take the paragraphs as they stand in the memorandum. (a) Excise licenses have not yet been carried into effect. It appears that all that would be required in • he case of Muscat subjects would be a pro clamation by the Sultan, but this would be useless if British subjects were not compelled to take out similar licenses at the same time, and a King’s Regulation would be required for this. Co onel Trevor promised to look up the machinery for the issue of a King’s Regula tion and the scheme was postponed pending a communication from Bushire. The commodities proposed to be included under Excise licenses were wines and spirits (Rs. 500 per annum) and opium and preparations of hemp (Rs. 1,000 per annum and I est mated the total financial effect at about Rs. 1,500 annually. The Municipal house tax was to have been carried into effect in Matrah by Captain Alban and as far as Arab subjects were concerned wa&gt; v I believe, started but some doubt arose as to whether or no a King’s Regulation would be necessary here also as most of the revenue would come from British subjects. Captain Alban was very ill for the last four months he was at Muscat, and I fear the matter slipped my memory. ■ In any case the revenue from both the above taxes would be extremely small and would hardly affect Muscat’s financia position. The camel tax was brought into operation, but after a spirited protest from the Omanis, Colonel Trevor, while at Muscat, ordered me verbally to advise the Muscat Government to drop it as it might lead to a renewal of the ill-feeling between Muscat and the Omanis. This was done from April 1st and it was a matter of considerable regret to me as it was then bringing in about Rs. 400 a month and would have produced consi derably more in the date harvest season. (b) With regard to the proposed increase in Customs duty may I point out that the 5% rate was fixed in 1891—35 years ago—and I think I am right in asserting that every country which has a system of tariffs (and India itself is no exception) has increased its rates within that period. It is not, therefore, an unfair request to make to the other countries concerned, and short of perennial and financial aid, which is undesirable from many points of view, is to my mind, the only pos sible way of balancing the Muscat Budget. It should be remembered that the customs are the only way the Omanis can be compelled to contribute to the Muscat Government revenues and that they form the main sour e of revenue of the State. The only other tax which is collected is the date harvest tax (zakat) and that is open to so many abuses that it does not produce the revenue it should do. A re organisation of it was begun by Captain Alban but it entails a detailed survey of all the date groves and cannot be complete for some time..1 think it should be borne in mind that the ra’sing of the Customs dues would not materially aifect France or America as the import trade from the one is nil and from the other so small and so indirect as to be practically negligible. (c) Remission of the repayment of the loan for five yea s. —I suggested this as I considered it would give us time to search about for other sources of revenue. The discovery of oil was what I had in mind at the time. The remission will come automatically, I presume, if matters go on as they are at present. (d) Reduction of the Sultan’s Privy Purse. —It appears that Colonel Trevor and I misunderstood the Sultan’s attitude on the subject of halving his privy purse. As he has explained to me since, what he meant was that, if while he was away from Muscat, the Treasury became empty, he was willing to let half his salary lap^e in order temporarily to stave off a financial crisis. He denies that he ever intended to surren- • der voluntarily and permanently Its. 5,000 a month. He says he could not in any case offer to submit to a lesser income while at Muscat, as the^e he is subject to heavy calls on his purse from the many descendants “ a la main gauche” of his forbears and from outlying chiefs who demand his hospitality. ‘ In any case I would not re commend any reduction in his purse as it would quite possibly lead to an immediate renewal of his previous idea of abdication and it is to be remembered that he is after all an independent ruling sovereign, and as such can hardly be expected to keep up his position on any.hing smaller than his present income. (?) Reduction of the Muscat Levies. —The strength of this force was originally fixed at 300 but owing to financial stringency it has already been reduced to a trifle over 200 and I have further ordered the new Com mandant not to enlist any more until it is down to the latter figure, which is in my opin on the lowest possible compatible with safety. The Sultan’s authority is to my mind largely dependent on the exist ence of a suitable striking force in the vicinity of Muscat, and if it should be possible to station detachments of this force at o: near the other coast towns under adequate administration to suppo t the authority of the local Walls I think we should find a considerable improvement in Government and most probably an increase in reve nue. We should seek therefore rather to augment the State Forces in order to ensure that local authorities’ hands are strong enough to cope with incipient disorder (this applies particularly to Sur) and that the Central Government be in a position to insist on satisfactory administration in the outlying towns. May I correct the misappre hension of its being an alien force ? True, it is largely composed of Baluchis, descendants of previous immigrants from the opposite coast and subjects of His Highness. There are some Baluch from Gwadur District, which, incidentally, is also an appanage of Muscat, and a few Yemenis from near Aden but otherwise it is in all senses a national and not an alien force. (/) Increase in the Sultan’s subsidy. — I suggested this more as a means of driving home the seriousness of the financial situation at Muscat than anything else. I am not in favour of anything in the shape of doles whenever they can be avoided. It would be preferable to see Muscat stand firmly on its own feet than existing on the bounty of a foreign Government. (g) Mr. Bower’s deputation. —Colonel Trevor suggested this as Mr. Bower had made such an improvement in the Bahrain Customs but matters are rather different in Muscat. I do not think the State is losing much on the central customs, which are under the control of an able Egyp tian, but probably there is a certain amount of loss on the outlying ones, the control and inspection of which depend more on political factors and adequate and rapid means of transport rathe: than ou system and organisation.4. To sum up the points of the above-quoted memorandum : paragraph (a) is partly nearly negligible in effect and partly found impracticable, (d) is undesir able, and (e) inadvisable ; (g) seems unnecessary and the Government of India do not wish to accede to (6), (c) or (/) except as last resources, (h) is agreed on but its financial effect will not be immediately apparent. 5. In the circumstances the estimate of the immediate future financial situa tion remains as previously described by my predecessor and myself, that is to say we may look to a crisis occurring before very long. I find that in 1922 the State lost Ij lakhs of rupees, in 1923 1 lakh and this year the deficit can hardly be less than f of a lakh. This will by the end of the year leave Muscat without any balance in hand and as the current revenue is not sufficient for the expenditure, which under the present administration cannot, I believe, be reasonably reduced, there can be only one result, namely, bankruptcy. This year we ought just to weather, helped by the present hight rate of the dollar and the prospects of a fair date crop. I have also hopes that the appointment of the new European Finance Minister may alter the situation materially but, as I pointed out above, I do not think he can be ex pected to improve the position much in the immediate future.4 U thinlc much ab»ut it ar shaw any signs sf alarm'tr sf bsing fsrswamsd*' • As regards (3), the same tendency en the part ef the Muscat autheritles te alienate the tribal Sheikhs may be traced in the files, regarding Sur, theugh the matter is semewhat mere cempllcated. lile t ® wn •* Sur censlsts ef twe large quarters separal I ed by a creek.

The tewn art the fert at DIK were accerdingly handed ever. After the fixed peried Isa bin Salih made ne sign ef returning the fert te the Sheikh ef Ibri and the latter upbraided Sulaiman bin Hamyar fer failing te make Isa bin Salih keep his premise. Sulaiman bin Hamyar then went te Isa bin Salih and demanded that he sheuld keep his ward. A dispute arese between Isa bin Salih and Sulaiman bln Hamyar and the latter left the farmer and teak away his fighting men with him* 39. The defectien frem Isa bln Salih 9 s fighting farces gave ceurage te the remaining Ghafiri tribesmen te resist amd Isa bln Salih feund himself se weak that he evaouted ibrl and all the ether places that had surrendered te him and has gen 6 back te his heme at KABIL, 440. In his letter fte. 83 dated 30th fteYember 1925 Celenel Creethwaite etates|f 9 The DHAHIREH tract has always maintained mere er less friendly and qasl-subject relatiens with the Muscat State» theugh at ne even cemparatirely recent time has the ruler ef Muscat raised any taxes frem its inhabitants, tfhen Isa bin Salih led the rebellien ef the tribes in Oman preper in 1913 the DHAHIKBH inhabitants de net appear te have jeined him in any great numbers. 41. The reasen why leoal epinlen Is new exercised by Isa bin Salih 1 s mere inte DHAHIHEH is that certain ef the tribes ef that tract lie astride the range ef hills separating DHAHIBEH frem the Satineh districts ef Oman. Sheuld he bring such tribes under his pewer in the DHAHIREH he may be able te exercise an influence centrary te the interests ef the Muscat State in the Batineh. The general impressien 9 hewever, is that Isa bln Salih as a HINAWIYAH will net be able te win ever the Ghafiriyah tract the ef DHAHIREH ? 42. I weuld peint eut that hlstery has already shewn Isa bln Salih capable ef surmeunting such difficulties. Majer Hawerth in his letter He. 91-C dated 9th May 1917 states!- M Isa did net epenly jeindt the rebellien immediately. It was jeined by Hamiyar bin Baser el Mebhani, Temeemeh ef TABU? and chief sheilch ef the Rlyami tribe ef Ghafirls. MS SALAMI went abeut raising the tribes and OHAEIRIS and H1BAWIS alike declared their allegiance but the main bedy ef the latter factien enly came in when Isa bin Salih epenly attached himself te the mevement. Mrem previeus histery and subsequent direct!en ef the rebellien 9 there is little deubt that Isa was, and had been, the hidden pewer behind the scenes frem the cemmencement and the Sultan cenflrmed this as being cerrect. He was, hewever, clever eneugh te see where previeus revelutlens had failed and te perceive the wisdem ef bringing in the GHAEIHIS first in erder te make the mevement a universal ene In Oman.' The eriginal Imam selected in 1913 was SALIM BIN RASHID 43.isa bin Salih during, Is.te rehelllan, af instigating the BHA.MRI tribes ts rebel against the Sultan and then stepping in and •btaining the Orerlerdshipi it weuld seem that the same tactics have been empleyed by Sheikh Isa in instigating the Baraimi tribes » whe were in eppesitien te him f te shew eppesitien te the Air ?erce Party. 48. fhere is alse a suspicien that Mehemed bin haser ef the BANI BU ALI may have empleyed similar tactics te create frictien between the ARABIA, sectlen ef the JBK&amp;BEH with whem he was at enmity» and Mr, Themas, 49 . In paragraph 8 above* mention is made that the Sultan present sheiKh bin Zald* ef the MAIM* has fer the last few years, been sending and receiving presents te and frem IBM Maud* when he has new apparently invited te take possession and majce a sort ef protectorate ef Baraimi, 50. There are two important tribes in Baraimi* the MAIM, and the DHOftAHIR, The Malm used te be sponsored by Muscat State* whilst the DHGWAHIB* strongest numerically* are in alliance with the Sheikhs ef Abu Dhabi, 81. It is possible that overtures te Ibn Sand by the MAIM may have been fer the purpose ef replacing the support ef the Muscat State which no longer has any value. It is mere prsbable that it was sought fer the purpose ef counteracting the activities sf Isa bin Salih and their abssrptxsn within his sphere sf influence, 52. In this csnnectien* I wsuld draw your attention te the fact that Sheikh Maneur bin jiaser* ef tne JEmEBEH * mentioned above* and Hamdan bin Baser and Salem bin Maeer* brothers ef Mehemed bin Maser mentioned above* ef the BAMI BU ALI* ( a tribe which is eahabl ) stayed at Mecca fer three months this year and the party were the guests ef H,M, Ibn Saud whose hespitalityihey enjoyed threugneut. 53, In this connection* it is interesting te note the attitude ef these particular tribes towards the WAHABIS duringk- 14 *&gt;■ - tribes had risen and thus we ceuld net de etnerwise than eentinue that suppert te his representative whs teeic ever tne reins ef Government. N ^ He ( Saiyid T&amp;imur ) admitted te me tiiat if it were net fer tne vulnerable peeitien ef tne tribes en tne ceast* many ef them would join tne imam and ne bad few tribes left upon wnem he ceuld rely* a number wnicn decreases as tne Imam's strengtn increases and defections have taken place in the last year. M 59. In hio letter He. 476 dated 10th February 1920* Mr. wingate statesi- M The sultan has thrown himself practically unreservedly en eur suppert new* and his attitude is* M You have paid my debts* you are managing my customs and I realise that without your suppert I would no) be able te maintain my authority at all. But you must maintain it or you will de nothing with the customs. w 50 # xt would appear that since tnen the sultan has completely abandoned any attempt te Keep in touch with or maintain friendly relations with tne tribes * relying solely on the support of tne British Government to maintain his dynasty. ( 5 X« It seems to me that tne seeds tor future trouble are being sown by the present apathetic policy sf the state towards the tribes. In view of the possibility of an Air Boute passing over this country a more satisfactory state ot affairs would be desirable. In any case if the state is to consist/of anything more than a customs cordon maintained by British ships for tnt purpose of furnishing an income for Saiyid Taimur and his relatives* the duty of maintaining relations with the tribal sheijchs and settling inter-tribal disputes is one which, in my opinion* the Sultan's Government should not be permitted to neglect. 62mJfc 15 / 62* In his letter dated 26th January 1919 te the Pelitical Agent Saiyid Taimur states *• As regards usual presents te bheiJchs we will put them with eur persenal expenses ter tney concern eur ewnsext * 11 it is clear that this is put in merely te justify a large persenal income and net from any desire te cultivate friendly relations with the siheijms. 63* It is curious te tnat tne same argument was put forward by the sultan's brother Salyld i»adir, when the Political resident visited muscat last march, te justify a larger allowance, in view of the constant absences of tne Sultan, and the consequent expenses for entertaining which fell upon him. Kadir has a notorious reputation as a miser 64. 1 doubt very much whether any appreciable amount has been spent by Saiyid Taimur for tnis purpose. He would appear to consider himself absolved from such a duty by the subsequent inclusion of ttwadur with tne Customs control, as may be gathered from his letter to Hr. Wingate dated 7th June 1921. H with regard to tne allowances of the Sheiichs, it does not exceed Hs 3000/- and perhaps it is less than that amount. 1 cannot accept less tnan Hs 10000/- • You are aware that the receipts of Owadur can meet tne deduction demanded ( on account of tne allowances of the sheikhs ). M 65. In the Annual Administration Heport for Muscat for 1924, in connection with the settlement of a somewn&amp;t humiliating expedition to HAIL against tne BAhl BATTASH undertaken by baiyid Hadir on his own initiative, it states, n As regards the personal submission of the Sheikh, His Highness asked that the incident be now considered as finally closed on the score of the expense which His Highness would have to undergo if the Hhelkh came to Muscat. The latter would naturally^ring a large following with him and tney would have to be treated as His Highness' guests.' 66 . In April 1926, when he visited &amp; 0 HAR, His Highness9 16 Highness is said to have spent a fair amount in presents and entertainments to tiheiichs but such expenditure seems to have been included in tne budget under tne head 11 Transport and Travel', hs 10708/- were spent under th05head during the period January to June 1926. % 67. In March 1920 His Highness Saiyid Talmur expressed verbally to His Excellency tne Viceroy a wish to abdicate in favour of his son 8 aiyid 8 aeed but the Government of India decided he must return to Muscat. In this connection it is interesting to note how the son has followed in his fathers footsteps, where tne father failed* the son has succeeded for he has to all intents and purposes thrust all responsibility for the administration of o the State on us. 68 . In his letter Ho. 598 dated October 1903 Major P.Z Cox reports the desire of uaiyid faisal to abdicate m favour of his son Saiyid Tairnur and reports Faisal as saying* H I do not feel that I am getting old but 1 am weary of ail tne cares of my position; the incessant worry wnicn I experience from the tribes and the constant anxietjrj^t from Jcnewing where to loox for money to meet all the calls that are made upon me. 1 have come u to the conclusion that X should/happier if I took an allowance from the SARKAR and gave up the Government. My idea is this* that I should abdicate in favour of saiyid Taimur and that the British Government should recognise and direct him. I am afraid he is too inexperienced to run alone and would require some one to guide his footsteps.' I observed* ' The conditions would be the same as at ZAitZIhAK 7' he replied* ' Yest that is what it comes to. ' I asked him what he thought the people of Oman would nave to say to sucn an arrangement. He replied that he did not tninx tney would be affected or interested at all as % their own condition would remain practically unaltered and tnat in any case he did not consider tnat they constituted a factor of17 •f any difficulty . 11 69. In his letter !&lt;•• 898 dated April 1920 Mr. Wingate writes i- * Saiyid Taimur is net unintelligent • He is, hsveyer, incredibly weaK and incurably Tain. Bsth these characteristics have net made him a successful ruler ef an Arab State.

H The valuable suppert ef aalih bin All ( father ef Isa he alienated it by shewing faveur te said bin Ali, a rival SheiKh ef the Harth, and the catastrephe thereafter was net leng delayed.

I am ef epinien that, under present cenditiens, neither the bultan ner any member ef the ruling family ceuld be relied upen te be ef any assistance in bettering tne relatiens between the State and the tribal Sheikhs.* They realise that it is their unpepularity which has enabled them te acquire an inceme whilst divesting themselves ef all respensxbility.

There is ne State guest heuse and there are ne regular arrangements fer the entertainments ef guests in accerdance with Arab custem. In 1920 sheikn Rashid^ { minister efm£ f#r Shara ) pay was fixed at Ks 1000/- and he was asked t# feed the State guests. His pay was cut dewn tt Rs 600/- in 1921. I understand that the Walis and ether State efficials and petty Sheikhs and headmen are entertained at StA/Uexpense theugh I can net trace this in the State Budget. The entertainment ef mere impertant Sheikhs has te be undertaxen by tne Minister whe is meet friendly with them at his ewn expense. 75. There is ne deubt that this state ef affairs is due te the very precarieus cenditien ef the State's finances and the efferts the varieus successive financial advisers have made te effect ecenemy and preduce equilibrium. In his Demi Official dated 20th march 1926 Mr. Themas writes n As regards Mr. Wingate's reference te the balmy financial situatien in 1920» it is relative; his reugn estimate in August shewed up even better in the acceunts at the end ef the year in ths^t there was a balance ef three lakhs abeut 9 instead ef twe as he had anticipated. But as I have said befere 9 the presperity was apparent and net real. It was pessible enly en the ber rewings ef six and a half laichs six menths be fere and it weuld appear that en the basis ef this unreal presperity military and ether expenditure was ailetted en a scale which time has shewn was bejrend the State's current reseurces te meet# hence the subsequent financial crises ef the Muscat State. The scepe ef Mxpenditure seems new te have ceme te be regarded as nermal and irreducible with tne result tnat the State is disabled frem under- -taxing any measures ef administrative imprevements er secial amelieratien.

Copy forwarde to the Ron'ble the Political Resident in the Persian ttulf C/O Assistant Superintendent, I.JS.Telegraphs, Henjam, for inforiaation. I. ▼Muscat 30th October 1928. Prom Major G.P.Murphy, I.A., Political A&amp;ent and H.B.M’s Consul, Muscat, To The Hon*able the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I hare the honour to submit for your consid ©ration, the following report on the general situation in Oman. This country is occupied by numerous tribes both settled and nomad. For the sake of protection a- gainst their neighbours, with ^hom they are constantly haring blood feuds, the weaker tribes become allied to stronger tribes and this method of alliance has resulted in the formation of t^o political factions: Hinawi and Ghafiri, so called after two tribes, Bani Hina and Bani Ghafir, who at one time possessed very powerful sheikhs to whom the other tribes became allied. The racial tie being a strong one, the Hinawi faction is composed large ly though not essentially of Yemeni tribes whilst in the same way, the majority of Ghafiri tribes are of Adnani origin. Most of the tribes of Oman belong to the Ibadhi sect, an offshoot of the Khawarij, and the Imamate of Oman owes its origin to the peculiar religious tenets of the Khawarij as adopted by the Ibadhiyah. They dis allowed the claims of the Baghdad Khalifahs as well in civil as religious matters and set up one of their ownown whom they invested with corresjjonding powers in both capacities. At first, for a period of nine hundred years, Imams were elected for their personal merits or capacity. From A.D. 16£4 onwards, this principle gradually underwent modification. The post was still elective but with a strong preference to the ruling family over strangers. The present dynasty was founded in 1744 by Ahmed bin Said who was elected Imam on account of his patriotism and bravery in expelling the Persians. During his administration, his sons obtained the title of Sey- yid which their descendants have claimed ever since. ine House of Seyyids** like the reigning houses of Europe, has become a recognized dynasty; but the gradual increase in the number of rival and aspiring Seyyids has been one fertile source ol intestinal feuds which have arrested the prosperity of the country. The title of Sultan is an extraneous one and dates from the time of Seyyid Sultan bin Ahmed (1792- - eo4 )* It is seldom used by the people of the country. The authority of the Imam or Sultan over his tribes has always been somewhat she,dowy # owing perhaps to the inac cessible nature of the mountains, ravines, and valleys of which the country consists. Intestinal feuds and Tahabi invasions combined with the weak and vacillating policy of recent Sultans, the degeneracy and incapacity of members of their family and intermixture with negro blood, have gradually estrang ed the sheixhs of the various tribes. Rebellion followed reoellion until at last after the rebellion of 3913-1919, when the Ghafiri and Hinawi elements combined for the first time in opposition to the Arms Warehouse which we had induced the Sultan to establish, a fresh state was formed by Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al Harithi, supporting a puppet Imam of the Khalili iamily, who are identified with the Kutawwa or extremistextremist moTement in the Ib&amp;dhi sect. H.H. the Sultan of Muscat and Oman has been left ^ith Muscat # ^-atrah, and its vicinity ^hich ^ere defendedby British troops; with the Batinah coast which is always vulnerable to British ships; ’*ith Owadur on the } r e)cran coast; with Sur and Jaalan, the inhabitants of which supported him in the last rebellion, but ^here his authority is being challenged at the moment; with Musandum where his sover eignty over the Shihuh tribe is shadowy; and ^ith Dhofar, a province which ^e assisted him in recapturing in 1896. I attach a map shoeing the extent of his influence and nominal rule exclusive of G^adur and Dhofar. The revenues of the State consist of a subsidy from Government, and a 5% import and export tax at such customs posts where it can be levied. Other revenues are negligible. The export tax has taken the place of Zakat on dates and fish which the Muscat authorities are incap able of collecting on the spot. It will be seen from the above that the Muscat Government exists entirely on the support which it is able to obtain from the British Government. This is the natural result of our policy in 1913, of defending Muscat and Mntrah and affording naval assistance on the toast but maintaining an attitude of non-intervention in the hinterland. As regards Oman proper and the Semail valley, the rule is in the hands of Sheikh Isa bin Saleh and the Imam, but Sheikh Isa’s position at the moment is to a certain extent precarious. He has tue sup;ort of the Hinawi tribes but he has never had much influence over the Ghafiris and so there is always the possibility of some fresn claimant to power ousting him with the- support of this faction. He has also been looking anxiously towards Ibn Saud whose agents have since 1925 collected Zakat fromfrom Baraini. Ho force Has been used by Ibn Baud for collecting this Zakat, but it nas probably been paid through fear of Ibn Baud's agent instigating neighbouring trib«s to raid them. Baraimi is the key to Oman: the '-hole of the Batiaah coast can be raided from that -iuarter with impu-. nity, whilst a little instigation and assistance from there to the fJhafiri tribes would bring about the collapse of Isa's administration. Should the hinterland eventually fall into Ibn Baud's hands, the position of the Sultan v/o u Id toe c oni6 un te ha b 1 e • The considerations which influenced our policy in 1913 no longer hold good. At that time operations in the interior would have been difficult owing to the moun tainous nature of the country. A large number of troops would have been retired to carry them out and the result which could have been obtained would have been meagre, but I venture to submit that the case is different today. A few aeroplanes in support of an effective administration is all that would be required to consolidate the country and bring about peace and prosperity. At the present moment Sheikh Isa bin Saleh is in correspondence and on friendly terms with the Mus cat Council and I think in the precarious position in which he is placed, he would require very little induce ment to persuade him to throw in his lot with the Sultan. If this wore done and if the administration thus fcomed were supported by a few aeroplanes, it would become poss ible to consolidate Oman into an efficient State and the present unsatisfactory condition could be terminated. I hare the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. Major, Political A^ent and H.B.M’s Consul, Muscat.Ve ry Confidential , .British Residency L. Consulate-General* JBuahire, the 14th Hovr. 1928# .Demi-official ho 407-S. letter ho 132 of the 30th October# 1 doubt very much, however, whether your proposals really afford a solution of our present difficulties in taiscat or one that His Majesty's Government would be ready to consider. Apparently Isa bin Saleh is now in a somewhat weak position sc that he might be induced again to coalesce with Muscat under .British protection. The Muscat Government seems to be weak enough and it is difficult to see how the coalesence of two weak elements will.produce strength. We should apparently only be introducing a new element in taking upon ourselves the responsibility for an outbreak between Hinawi and the Ghafiri, giving an additional inducement to the latter to appeal to outside assistance. hor do 1 see how the coalition would affect the Sur question which would apparently stand very much as it do now, except that an advance by the Hinawi 9 n s ^ r would considerations of ap.-eals to outside assistance would obtain to which Ibn Saud is prepared at present to flout diplomatic opinion by embarking on aggression and annexation, and should be inclined to think that he is more likely to content himself at the present stage with a be nominally at any rate a Muscat advance. Hut the same Personally 1 am a little doubtful of the extentmore general widening of his influence* Again I cannot quite see what we are to do with a regiment at Sur unless the arrangement is to be more or lees permanent. When the regiment leaves it will merely be the difficulty of the ships coming and having to go- as you point out- except that the stay will be longer. 1 should imagine that the position and weakness of Muscat which is well recognised there and the policy to be observed in the future will form one of the subjects of the Committee now sitting in London,’and we may very possibly expect to be asked soon for our views, and obviously something must be done. As 1 am entirely strange to this part of the country I feel considerable diffidence in expressing any views. 1 should have liked to come along to Muscat and have gone into the various questions with you on the spot, but it seems rather difficult to get away so soon after arrival. 1 should be very glad, therefore, if you could let me have a full and free expression of your views. Government would probably look askance at any long absence by you from Ti/Tuscat in view of the red hot messages that have been going over the wires, but if you can be assured shortly that things have settled down and can safely be left to simmer a bit, 1 should be very glad if you could come over here and have a full discussion with me.

Demi Official No. /O Tith reference to your D.O.Ho 407-S dated 14th Hot. 1928, My letter No 132 was written because I gathered from Sir Lionel Haworth,when I Piet him at Dibba.that the whole question of our relations with the Arab side of the Persian Gulf was now under consideration and that t/*e question of a Proteetorate orer Oman was bein£ considered. In fact,in his report No 382-S dated 25th October, Sir Lionel has recommended such a course# ^That is it w# are goin^ to protect ? A. A protectorate which embraces a narrow and rulner- aole coast llne.exposed to raids from the interior, seems to me an unsatisfactory solution to the situat ion.

There is also the possibility of future trouble with the Imam. It seems to me t:iat,if a protectorate is to be decl ared,the inclusion of the Imams territory in tie Sultan ate is a necessary preliminary. — Looking at tie subject from a military point of view, if we are to protect Muscat from any future invasion oy is really L.ne hey to Oman in the north. Its possession would enable the Wahabis n.;t only to invade Oman,but also to raid tne Batinah coast and the Trucial coast with impunity. Any protective measures we undertook would have to be concentrated at that place and not spread all over tne country. Inter tribal feuds and skirmishes occ ir cenetantly and * it ^ould be almost impossible to checx t iem except oy inducin^ the x^rties to brin* tneir cases before the Council for adjudicatien. It was the refusal of Saiyid Faisal to take the trouble to adjudicate in such disputes and tne consequent lack of any impartial authority oefore whom tney could be brought.which was the main cause of the rebellions of 1895 and 5913,and whicn led to the setting up of anotner Imam in the interior. I have gathered from a study of former rebellions, tnat pr.ivir to 1913,they were engineered invariably for the purpose of placin* another member of tneSultan's famiiy on the throne. Prior to that date, there doe. not ap;ear to have been any idea of forming a separate state. Many of these rebellions,including that of 1895, Wahabis,this will have t© be doneappear to hare been engineerfrem Zanzibar,wherethe Harth tribe,to which Sheika lea bin Saleh belen^s, is particularly strong. Until 1913,rebellions failed ©win* to tne raxid rally of the Ghafiri tribes to the succour of the Sultan. Kxcept for the Bani Bu Ali and the Bani Rasib, in Jaalan,the Ghafiri tribes are not W&amp;n&amp;bl. I doubt whether they would welcome Ibn Sand or call for his assistance unless they are grossly mishandled. Any inclination on their part to join hands witn the Bani Bu Ali is probably due to the fact tnat Isa bin Saleh is the Sheikh ©f a Hinawl tribe. Possibly the Ghafiris feel that a puppet Imam in his hands is not a impartial tribunal before which they can take their disputes. The weakness of the Muscat Gerernment is due in a large measure,to Isa’s rebellion and his formation ©f a fresh state including the valuable Semail valley, which was actually pro Sultan but which Isa succeeded in including in his area. This lias undermined the prestige of the state. Isa himself is a strong Plan. Ho has several strong men in his administration. Their inclusion in the Muscat Council would,I think,strengthen it considerably. If we really wanted t© rally the Sheikhs of' the vari ous tribes to the Muscat Government,! do not think tnat it wo U i* b Q a difficult matter. It could bo done at the trice of a little entertaining and small presents Muscat cannot afford to do this at present,and it is the absence of such entertaining which has alienated the Sheikhs from the present Sultan. Please see ray report No C.90 dated 12th Nov. 1927. This report is long and t.omewhat cumbersome as I deemed it necessary,being some what new to the post at the tirae.and writing to aRecident wh© ha.d hiraself serred here,to &lt;iu#te cha-pter and Terse f.&gt;r all my stateiLeats,but it ctTers a censider- able portion of the factors which will hare to be ctnside ered if a protectorate is contemplated. It seems to me that t ;e present state of the country is due to the absence of any authority and not to any natural propensity towards fi^.itin^ on the part of tne population. On the whole,the Onanis are not warlike and it is really surprising how peaceful tne country is considering tne lack of control everywhere. I realize the matter will have to be examined fully in detail by someone in higher authority before it could be considered by H.M.Gort. but I think the ipiestien of inclusion or exclvicion of Isa bin Saleh* s territory should be decided before the declaration of any protec- orate. Then once he was assured against attack from Ibn Sand, there would be no inducement for him to join. Our task of consolidating the state would be more diffi cult, also, without his assistance. I do not anticipate an immediate aggression on the part of Ibn Saud and the idea of Akwan raids did not emanate from this office, as I pointed out in my D.O. No. 152 dated £!st November. All I anticipated was a gradual undermining of authority through ^ahabi machina tions which might lead to a local conflagration in which the country ''ould become exhausted and an easy prey to (&gt;•&gt; subsequent annexation by Ibn Saud^V^he suggestion put forward in ray letter No. 13^ was not intended as a solu tion of the Sur question which I think win have to be decided first. Since you have asked me to express my views fully^I think it necessary to point out that I do not a*ree with the view that the Sultans of Muscat maintained their authority in Sur by playing off the Ba^i bu Ali and thequoted above, I have based my vie^e on *^hat has actually happened at Muscat. I shall be ^lad of the opportunity of having a full discussion with you on the subject. The situation at Sur.howeTer,is hardly likely to settle down until somo action is taken with regard to the Bani Bu Ali and Ibn Bauds fla^. Matters have been allowed to siMner for so lon^fthat it is almost inpossible to say that the patience of the parties will not become exhausted er that further developments will not ensue.(- /W oLUl 4-flj.

This was a personal guarantee to Saiyid Turki and not applicable to uis successors. lui-j-.r (No'- Sir Lionel) Hawurth reroarked on thit that aucu a restriction,though it sounds ’^ell on paper,is in practice or indeed on analysis of no value.Taking into consideration the circumstances in Oman,a guarantee of *- V ‘ lia '•ature.once fiiven.must be continued to a succe- fcsor lf he is to mintain his place for the withdrawal of the aipport is practically an encouragement to attack, Turki died in 18C6. In leyo.a successful attack was laade on Muscat. Saiyid Faisal himself fled to Port Jalali. The Britisu Hepros- ontative remained neutral but objected to the more effective blockade of Fort Jelali from the quarters in 'hich the Agency is situated. The situation ended in a ucadlocji ’ Inch was finally terminated by the Sultan pay ing * 12000/- to the rebels together with agreeing to tne payment of a pension to the Rustaq family. In 169b, after the rebellion,the British Government extended to Saiyid Faisal the guarantee given to his fa tiler that they -ould not alio- attacks to be made ua Muscat and Matrah whatever difference the Sultan might have with hie tribes. In spite of this guarantee,however,from 1695 to 1 S 99o-in^ to our -rant of support of him durinj the rebellion.

The underlining is mine. It seems to me that in obtaining such an important and far reaching under taking, we ^ere not only assuming certain ri^.its but also incurring very grave responsibilities. The settlement of the rebellion of 1913-1919 TT as our settlement. ' The Sheikhs were cordial and accepted the mediation of H.X.Government. The Sultan also desired a settle ment and .^ave t ie Political Agent carte blanche. The Political Resident recommended that the Political Agent be authorized to proceed with negotiations on the basis of the recognition of the status quo by both parties and tne Government of India autnorized these negotiations on condition that the terms of final agreement be submitted to the Government of Indiapri#r to approv«il Pfr'i Sfo joe ddu j.&lt;r. ij' Thu reforms introduced after the rebellion ivere our reforms. For many years,Saiyid Faisal fought the desiate of tjie (iovernment of India to m&amp;na^e the customs for him fearing the disappearance of the last vestige of his inuepenuance • liiis i ee liri£ Saiyid Taimur, to a certain degree inherited. nevertheless tne customs 'vere reformed and finally brought up to date on the recommendations of Kr G. T ,. ho-’er 01 the Indian Customs Service who ^as deputed, in 1924,for that purpose. It is o.t interest to note the Sultans words in this connection. 'Perhaps you remember the days when ^e met in Bombay and my objection to the suggestion of sending Mr Bower -tiie cutoi-i.s purpose as I think and consider they ars — t suc h i mpTtant affairs as Colonel Prideaux thinks about the arrangement of customs and there was a Ijng discussion between us, and you know the fact of ^hat it is in our country fet_^he_r econeiliatio n for us is t-ian ^gosiUoi; ii i__t.iis matter and long contest hu,c no benefit excej^t misunderstanding.” ( The Sultan seems to have been thinkin,. of his original undertaking.) 19&lt;i0,txie Sultan liad thrown himself unreservedly ° n ° Ur support# He r ealiaed he could do nothing towards maintaining his authority without us,and in view of the way w e had tied him down,this is not surprising. He wisned to abdicate in favour of his son Saeed ( tjlen ueri dears old.) leaving the management of affairs entirely in our hands. Ptur N. fJ ( ieA Government '■rould not i^ree to this. They did however oluiU l^iopermit him to limit his period of residence in to three months a year,and his personal allowances were also fixed by Government. He -as permitted,in 1920, to form a Council of Ministers to carry on state affairs during his absence. In 1921,on the recommendation of various Political Agents,a Levy Corps was formed under a British Officer in order to relieve us of the necessity for keepiny a Hejiment at Muscat in order to maintain our under taking to protect tiese towns. In 1924,a British Officer,Mr Thomas, was appointed by the Sultan,on our rec 0 *mendatien,as finance Minister and a member of the Council of Ministers. In tne words of my predecessor ; ' I think Thomas can usually t his collea gues to t ”ive a decision in favour of his own wishes.” To w nat extent are we responsible fpr the actions of a British Officer (Not a Government Servant.} controlling a Council of State arl absentee Sultan ? •Latever interpretatien we may care to put on it, tne general Arab opinion will be that he is acting in accordance with tiie wishes of t e British Government. To quote ; c ajor (Now Sir Lionel) Haworth ayain. M My opinion,if I may be permitted to express it,is tnat ior many years our policy in Oman has been ^ron^ in its blind support of the ruline Sultans,a support diven without enquiry into the reasons for the many rebellions of the tribes and which made little attempt to improve the Government as it existed. Were the circumstances different today,to what they were before I would undoubtedly use them to inform Saiyid Taimur that he hat forfeited our support but I have shewn that we have no ground for this statementSn^a^ements ^/ould became iiapjseible if each sucescor ^rere to break an en^a^eiuent without warning,because ne did not a^ree ritli tlie principles which induced his predecessors in their ictlon*.' Fnatever has been done in Muscat during the past eijht years,has been carried out on the recommendation or with the approval of a British Officer. Gan we in fairness say that any particular action taken by the Council of Ministers is futile when we ourselves have laid conditions and restrictions on these actions ? how,when largely as a result of such action,we are faced with a biyjer problem,can we withdraw our support and leave t ie state to what would be its inevitable fate? If I may be permitted to say so,I think that we have gradually but imperceptibly usurped the functions and authority of the state. The Sultan,mindful of his undertaking and realizing that M Important matters' is a very elastic term,has _iven ' ,r uy on every point. The movement has taken place by such slow decrees that we have been unmindful of the ^.rave responsibility which such an assumption throws on our shoulders.mm*••• '| • i (Zw I VISIT OF SENIOR NAVAL OFFICER TO TRUClAL COAST* 5th :.;AY TO iOth MaY, 1931. 5th may.

II AFTERNOON h/rffaTING On landing we met with a very cordial reception and were entertained at the wall's fort. After the usual commonplaces a very ling complicated discussion too* place. (a} The first part ot the discussion dwelt upon the question of the sheikh of Dibah's conciliatory ad vances. The Wall repeated that they had come through the Kumazarl, but that he was at a loss to reply to them without instructions; the matter was dropped at that point while the general talk jtook a. unexpected turn. (b) The wall turned first to Mohammed bin sulai- “ an 0t KU “ Zar andQlen t0 Sheikh Hilal bin A li of ..hassab and demanded of them to tell him now in the presence of the Senior naval Officer ana hrs officers whether they had any treaty or secret understanding with tne sheikh ol nas-al-Ahaimah, they enterea a spiri ted. denial of having made any such agreement or indeed of intending to ao so. but the., sOOi&amp;Sa^SSadmi tted that they had been friendly wi tn tne Joswami whion did not me.tn that they owed any allegiance to Raa-al -hhuimah. As the Wali had ‘The 'Aali has taken st -ps to get into touch with mentioned during the forenoon meeting that he wished to speaxw to me privatei.y as to' ( the advisability of taking these t/o men with him to Has-al-Khaimah to see^ an explanation of his demauds from shiexh sultan, i began to see some day- li 0 ht through the general maze of intrigue. The Excellent understanding which seemed to exist between the Wali and two Sheikhs, now appeared to be less evident in the po litical sphere, in other words thjjyali distrusted them. (c) Having taken advantage of our presence to put this leading question to them, and having obtained a reply which dia not altogether satisfy him the wall kept the con versation on general lines until the time arrived, for him to dismiss the two sheikhs and the remainder of the company. He then unburdened his soul to me, put his real suspicions into words ana asked for advice. Prefacing his remarks witn an allusion to the edan ru q e tjaat if no water is availaule to wash before prayer then sand is a suitable substitute, by which he was understood to suggest that if Mohammed bin sulaiman of icumz® ana Halal bin Ali of Khassab were not able of tneir own au thority to resist the pretensions of sheikh sultan of Kas- ak-^haimah then they should fall back on ,he general body Of their subjects for the necessary support, the Vali proceed eed to describe what he thought was the true pos tion. H e suspects thit th.e overtures of sheiih 3 aleh of D ibah are not honest tney are intended to throw off the scent of other morey important events, sheikh B aleh is in fact doing all in nis power to undermine the sh^ hc*dowy influence of Muscat ^ ^ penin6ular &gt; wor* he is assisted by H ilal bin A i : anu Monammeu bin Sulaiman who are making secret overtures to ahemn Suitan of fias-al jaaimah, while s^leh himself i s arrau . ^ Q1Vert ^ Wali ' s at ® a «tion by persuading sheikh suits leuers incorporating tne demanas mentioned above, (ejSiieiJch Saleh, and haa intended to write for instructions from Muscat on this matter. He was (3$ advised oy me to carry out his intention. At first when Ras-a^Khaimah* s claim ?/as put for- warn, he had thougnt of gping tu Ras-al-Khaimah with Hilal Moh&amp;mmea to see^ an explanation, but his suspicions of these two individuals’ attitude being aroused, he deferred taking any action beyond informing the Muscat Government and is now awaiting a letter from the council. He is very strongly of the opinion tnat the Council should reply definitely that the tri bes are not to pay tribute to Ras-al-Khaimah and that it should ta^ce steps to reprimand sheikh Saleh of Dibah for his machina tions. Otherwise he is of the opinion that tin last vestige oi tne Sultan’s prestige in the Russ al jibal peninsular will ( disappear. 1 agreed with him that he should continue to re port on the whole question, to Muscat and should await the Council’s decision, rather than go himself to Ras-al-Khaimah in the company of two persons of seemingly doubtful integrity. x- o.British suoject resident in Khassab was ol tne company r he gave it as his opinion that much of the trouoie was caused by tne tact that th-^e wali Y ;as trying to enioree a tax on the fisheries export trade.
