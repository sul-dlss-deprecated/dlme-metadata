Dear Sir, We enclose herewith copy of a letter we have today addressed to the Manager, Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd., Bahrein, from which you will see our firm are contemplating the introduction of light portable speech transmitting and receiving sets so that we may keep in touch with our sub branches on the Arabian Coast. Before we could operate these transmitters and receivers we presume it would be necessary to obtain the sanction of the Governments concerned and we should be glad to have your views and advice as to how we should proceed in this matter.

Dear Sir, You are no doubt aware that much of our work, especially in connection with lighterage business, is conducted at or with such outlying places as Has Tanura, AlKhobar and Zekrit anti it is probable that in the near future we shall also be operating at Ras el Mishaao* There are no means of. communicating with these points by civilian telegraphs and it is important that we should be in constant touch with our staff at these various places. We have had under consideration for some time the question of improving our means of communication with automatic transmitters and receivers. Our Head office in London inform us that such equipment is available as surplus Government stores. They inform us that one of the essential conditions for the use of such instruments is that they can be used on a frequency within a range of service material. Our London office are making further enquiries, but, in the meantime, we have been asked to ascertain at our end as to whether there would be any difficulties or objections to our operating such installations. We should be glad to have your advice in this regard. Yours faithfully,mmm m No.C/787. / 9 5 POLITICAL AGENCY BAHRAIN. The 10th of .July, 1947.

Gray Mackenzie &amp; Company, Limited, Bahrain, and its enclosure are forwarded herewith. 2. Unless Cable &amp; Wireless offer to provide the facilities required by Gray Mackenzie and Company, there seems no good reason why a request from them for such facilities should not be granted. 3. Should they make such a request, it would be necessary to ascertain that the Bahrain Government and the Shaikh of Qatar had no objection to the operation of the R/T sets in their respective territories. It would also be necessary similarly to address the Saudi Government through the appropriate authorities; and also to ensure that there is no objection from the servicej, Cable &amp; Wireless and possibly B.O.A.C. 4. Permission is requested for the Political Agent, Bahrain, to reply to Messrs. Gray Mackenzie that they should write to him stating specifically where they wish to operate transmitters and receivers, and enquiring whether there is any objection to their so doing.

BENTLEY’S SECOND PHRASE CODE. The Political Agent, Bahrein* Dear Sir, Bahrein, 20th si 19 We refer to our letter L/206 of the 6th instant regarding the proposal to instal radio telephone sets to enable us to establish direct coraraunication between our office at Manama and such points as Ras Tanura, Al Khobar, Zekrit and Mishaab. As Lloyd*s agents we are required to cable Lloyds, London, daily the movements of vessels at Bahrein and at Ras Tanura. Since there are no civil Post and Telegraphic communications with Ras Tanura we are obliged to rely on the Arabian American Oil Co* for advice of arrivals a nd departures of shipping at Ras Tanura, but although we have impressed on them the importance of our receiving such information promptly it is not infrequently several days old before it reaches us* In this connection Lloyds London have written us on the date 10.7*47 as follows M With regard to reports covering Ras Tanura, we have noticed that the information telegraphed by you covering that port is frequently several days old* Is it possible that your Sub-Agents at that port could also telegraph direct to this Office without incurring the delay of transmitting the information to you? It should be strongly emphasised to them that telegrams to be of value should be sent without delay, otherwise no advantage is gained in incurring the expense of telegraphic transmission. I shall be glad to hear from you in this connection as soon as possible M . If we could have our own means of direct communication with our office at Ras Tanura we would be able to obtain prompt advice of the arrivals and departures of shipping at that port, and so would be able to pass it on to Lloyds London without the delay at present experienced. No doubt we shall later be required to advise shipping movements at Mishaab also, and this alone may be considered by the authorities concerned as sufficient to warrant our being permitted to instal radio telephone sets. lb •#•*••**Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co.

With reference to your letter c/821 of the 20th instant, we have to advise that to begin with we should definitely have to operate radio telephone sets at Manama, Ras Tanura and Mishaab. We may later wish to instal radio telephone sets at A1 Khobar and Zekrit, but these two latter points are not so important at the moment. In reply to our letter to Cable and Wireless Ltd. here, ^ their local Manager called on us and suggested that our Managing Director in London should get in touch with Cable and Wireless in London as he feels that they will be better able to give us all the information we require and we have, therefore, written to our Head Office in London accordingly. \k Yours faithfully.

Lj. ttU — ^ CD T)^u. . ; u During the war Gray Mackenzie have been keeping contacts with their ships in Ras Tanura through the BAPCO-ARAMCO R/T - vide sls.4B ^ 49 of F.10/15-I. per mission will be required from tlie S^udi Government for the operation of r/T sets by Gray Mackenzie on the mainland (Ras Tanura and Ras al Mishaab), and this can be obtained through Minister, Jedda. Gray Mackenzie also want to instal R/T sets in Zekrit (Qatar), and the Shaikh of Qatar’s permission for this 1 would be necessary. According to Art. 8 of the Political Agreement attached to the P.C.L. Qatar Concession, P.C.L. ’s R/T installations 'shall not interfere with the lations as may be established by the Shaikh or H.M.G.”. and as such there may not be any difficulty iV\ obtaining the necessary permission from the Shaikh. In 1942, P.C.L. were refused permission to operate an R/T set in Bahrain (s.13, E.0. F.28/20) for reasons detailed in pp.72 and 73 of F.38/3; they were allowed to have R/T installations only in two of their launches - 'Ghazal' and ’’Shahin” - pi. see sis.3 &amp; 9 &amp; p.34 of E.O. F.28/20. If Gray Mackenzie were allowed to operate an R/T set in Bahrain, their request may be followed by one from P.C.L. We may have to ascertain from the services, the local government, Cable &amp; ’Vireless, and, presumably, B.O.A.C. also, if they have any objection to Gray Mackenzie’s proposal to use portable transmitting and receiving sets. P.A. may wish to send a copy of p.u.c. to P.R. saying that we would approach him for obtaining the permission of the services and the Saudi Govt, on receipt of further particulars from Gray Mackenzie; also for authority to address the Bahrain Government and the Shaikh of Qatar.
