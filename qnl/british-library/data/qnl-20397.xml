(i.y Ibn Saud to Sir G. Clayton. I HAVE received with pleasure your Excellency's letter, dated the 14th March, 1929 informing me of your arrival in Iraq and of your assumption of the duties of High Commissioner. I congratulate you on your safe arrival and on your assumption of the charge of affairs which have been entrusted to you in the sister country oi Iraq What we have known in your person, O your Excellency, as to the truthfulness of word, the anxiety for the fulfilment of pledges, and the unmistakable desire for the strengthening of good relations between us and the British Government, renders us hopeful of a change in the present burdensome situation (which has arisen between us and some of those in Iraq), as a result of the drastic and wise measure which we believe you will adopt with resolution and determination for the clearing up of the atmosphere and the removal of the unpleasant matters which have clouded it. We would like your Excellency to feel certain that yon will have the support of myself and my Government in every endeavour which is calculated to strengthen the good relations between us and the British and Iraq Governments, in deference to your person and out of desire to strengthen the ties with the British Government and of confidence in the result of your endeavours. You shall, by the will of God, find us always up to your good opinion of us, while we, on our part, are hopeful of finding yoil always up to our good opinion of you. Please accept, &amp;c. (Seal of Ibn Saud.) \m Dhul Oi'dat, 347 {April 24, 1929). (20 Ibn Saud to Sir G. Clayton. WE have received your letter, dated the 14th March, 1929, and we regret, as you do, that the first communication from your Excellency, after your assumption of the office of High Commissioner, should be on the subject of raiding incidents and attacks, &amp;c., between Nejd and Iraq. I like that you should feel certain, in the first place, that the attack on Mr. Crane's car and the murder of the American missionary- were not of the doing of the raiders referred to by you, since the enquiry which we I made into this incident in particular has shown us that the raiding party m question had not reached the place reached by Mr. Crane's car, and that the party had not at all come across that car. . 1 . , As regards other than what relates to the Mr. Crane incident, we wish to acquaint your Excellency as follows :— You will no doubt recollect the verbal discussions which took place between u&amp; at Jeddah, when we emphasised to your Excellency the fact that Iraq s continuance in the policy pursued by it would lead to continuous disturbances along the frontier. You will also recollect that we told you that unless the fortifications erected were pulled down it would be impossible to prevail over the forces in the vicinity of the frontier, because the people of Nejd as a whole were displeased with the conduct of the Iraq Government, their revocation of their pledge and their interpretation of the treaties between them and us according to their own wish and desire, to which has been added (or which were aggravated by) the activities of certain British officials, and their creation of causes for wrongdoing. All the foregoing has led to certain [875 p—1] B2 incidents to which you have referred. In our opinion, those responsible for these incidents are those who have been the cause of them, as we have already informed the British Government on more than one occasion, and as we also iniormed you at Jeddah. The incident of the action by aeroplanes and cars in Nejd territory, when you were in Jeddah negotiating with us for the solution of the problems, is not far to recollect. This, and what preceded it and what followed it, and their persistence in their intrigues, have reduced the conditions on the frontier to the state which you described in your letter. We, on our part, being anxious to prevent disputes between us and the British Government, and in the hope that existing problems would be solved following the arrival of your Excellency in Iraq, found it inevitable to take the hazardous step of stabilising conditions on the frontier. Accordingly, I set out in person at the head of 30,000'of my troops, attacked the forces assembled in the vicinity of the frontier under the leadership of Sultan-bin-Bujad and Faisal-al- Dawish, and dealt them a fatal blow, in the course of which the Dawish was wounded and surrendered himself to us, whereupon we sent him back to Artawiyah temporarily, until his wound is healed, when he will come back to us. As regards Ibn Bujad, we captured him, together with those who were with him, beheading some of them and sending the others to jail. Thanks to these strong and harsh measures, affairs on the frontier have calmed down completely. Those of our subjects whom we have thus fought had not complained of any injustice or oppression on our part, all were the subject of our sympathy, deference and justice. Their only complaint against us was that the Iraq had transgressed upon us by the erection of those qasrs on the frontier, and put our honour to contempt by violating our territory, while we did not retaliate the aggression. This is what had induced them to march on the frontier, to disobey our orders, and to be obstinate in their behaviour, and it was on account of this that we have dealt them this destructive and hard blow. This is what we have done for the pacification of conditions on the frontier, and we wish to know the action taken and to be taken by his Excellency General Clayton, on his part, with a view to assisting us in the removal from Iraq of the causes of these disturbances. There are three matters which should receive the attention of the British Government, so long as they wish to insure their interests and comfort in Iraq and also the interests and comfort of the people of Iraq, and so long also as they wish for the comfort of their friend {i.e., Ibn Saud himself— Translator). These three matters, which should receive consideration and for which a definite settlement should be improvised, and over which agreement should be reached between us and the British Government, are :— Firstly. —The Ashraf and their intrigues—both the Ashraf ruling in Iraq and Transjordania, and those residing there. They are the cause of the disputes between Nejd and Iraq and Nejd and Transjordania. Before they came there no such difference or disputes existed. They should either leave these neighbouring countries or have their hands bound, leaving them no power or authority over matters outstanding between us and Iraq and Transjordania, or over the frontiers of these two countries. Secondly. —A ' liquidation ' of former treaties should be effected so as to obviate misinterpretation and alteration, the qasrs and 'recent innovations' being removed. With this accomplished, the British Government will find us anxious to ward off any occurrence against Iraq. Thirdly. —British officials in Iraq and Transjordania should be made the subject of an enquiry {literally: should be considered), and the removal effected of those of them who have been the cause of instigation to evil, the others being prevented from persistence in their activities which are productive of trouble and mischief. The above three matters we place before the British Government and before his Excellency the general, for urgent examination with a view to subsequent agreement over a definite and conclusive solution, in order that neighbouring Arab countries might devote themselves to affairs of reform and reconstruction and to the ensuring of the happiness and prosperity of their peoples. We are confident of receiving, at an early date, from your Excellency and from the British Government, practical reply for proceeding with the settlement of these matters.

I THANK your Majesty very sincerely for your kind letter, dated the 24tli April, 1929, in which your Majesty sends congratulations to me on my appointment as High Commissioner in Iraq. . I welcome with deep gratitude your Majesty's assurance of support ana sympathy in the task of strengthening and confirming the good relations between your Majesty's kingdom and the Governments of His Britannic Majesty and of Iraq. Your Majesty's sympathy and confidence has always been extended to me in lull h measure, and I sincerely hope that the time will come when friendly discussion of iwasi| matters of mutual interest will afford me the privilege of once more meeting your to 5 Majesty in person and of renewing the friendship with which your Majesty has - Asi \ honoured me. ■ V Accept, &amp;c. D' GILBERT CLAYTON, t Acting High Commissioner for Iraq. (4.) Sir G. Clayton to Ihn Saud. Your Majesty, The Residency, Bagdad, May 25, 1929. I HASTEN to acknowledge the receipt of your Majesty's letter, dated the 24th April, 1929, a copy of which I have duly communicated to His Britannic Majesty's Government. The information which I have gathered on the spot regarding the attack on Mr. Crane and his party leads me to the belief that your Majesty has been misinformed, and that the perpetrators were men from the forces of Ibn Hithlam, who was at that moment carrying out a raid in the immediate vicinity. Neverthe less, it will serve no useful purpose now to continue discussion on this deplorable incident, which is only one of the unfortunate effects of an unsatisfactory situation which I hope may be remedied by mutual confidence and understanding. I venture once more to submit my respectful congratulations on the signally successful manner in which your Majesty has dealt with those who attempted to disobey your orders. Whatever may have been the motives of those who dared to flout your• authority, their punishment has been timely and well-deserved. The question of the posts is one on which we were unable to reach agreementy and, as your Majesty is aware. His Britannic Majesty's Government and the Iraq Government have signified their willingness to submit to impartial arbitration the interpretation of article 3 of the Uquair Protocol. At the same time, I am bound to point out to your Majesty that the existence of the posts during the recent troublous period, to which your Majesty has now happily put an end, has been the means of saving much loss of life and property. On no single occasion have raiders ventured to attack any post or to carry out raids in their immediate vicinity. They have invariably confined their attacks to defenceless shepherds and tribesmen who have moved far afield in search of grazing. In these circumstances, it is not unnatural that considerable value should be attached to the posts by those who are responsible for the protection of Iraq tribes from unprovoked attack. Nevertheless, I am in a position once more to assure your Majesty—with full knowledge—that these posts are in no way designed to interfere with the free movements of tribes, whether Nejdi or Iraqi, nor do they constitute any menace whatsoever against your Majesty's people and country. I have myself visited the posts and satisfied myself on this point by personal inspection. Provided that the situation on the frontier remains normal and peaceful, there is no intention of making them anything more than police posts for the better control and administration of the desert areas of Iraq. I have also satisfied myself by careful investigation and enquiry that the authorities in Iraq have, since our conversations in Jeddah, been scrupulous in observing their treaty obligations and have on no single occasion taken action which could be construed as provocative, or even incorrect. So patient and forbearing have they been that they have been the object of sharp criticism in many quarters, and have been accused of failing adequately to protect the interests of their own subjects. [875 p—1] b 2The Government of Iraq has no hostile or aggressive intention against your Majesty or your dominions. Their own aim is to devote themselves to questions of reform and reconstruction and to ensure the progress and development 01 Iraq m an atmosphere of peace and amity with their neighbours. I would here speak particularly of the unwarranted accusations levelled against Captain Glubb. I have made very careful enquiries, and I am in a position to affirm that they are entirely unfounded. Captain Glubb is an officer of high principle who discharges his duties unselfishly and conscientiously, and it is intolerable that he should be subjected to continual persecution not only in the ' Umm-el-Kura ' but also in the anti-Government press in Bagdad. If criticism is to be levelled, let it be at those who are responsible, but I am confident that your Majesty s chivalrous and generous spirit will no longer tolerate these continual attacks on an individual officer who performs his duty with courage and devotion and who, moreover, holds your Majesty's person in high respect. i . 1 „ It will be obvious to your Majesty that I have no authority to speak of any revision or interpretation of former treaties. That is a question which can only be considered by His Britannic Majesty's Government in consultation with the Iraqi Government. I can only say that any proposal for friendly discussions which may tend to remove misunderstandings and causes of friction will receive my warm support. It is of vital importance to the interests of the neighbouring Arab States of Nejd and Iraq that relations of mutual amity and co-operation should be established and maintained. Accept, &amp;c. GILBEET CLAYTON, Acting High Commissioner for traq. (5.) 11)71 Saud to Sir G. Clayton. {Translation.) THE ; tender feelings and good wishes which you have expressed in your letter dated the 25th May, 1929, have left the deepest and best impression on my heart. It is hardly necessary for me to assure your Excellency of the particular sympathy and the affection which I felt towards your noble person when I met you for the first time. I still entertain that very same feeling unchanged. The confidence to which you refer is, in fact, all that I can extend to you, and there is no doubt that you are the most worthy of being made the subject of such confidence. As to the hope you express for an opportunity for us to meet once more, this is a desire which is cherished by us as well, and we consider it in the interests of both countries that the affording of an opportunity for such meeting at an early date should be expedited. Please accept, &amp;c (Seal of Ibn Saud.) Mecca, 11 th Muharram, 1348 {June 24, 1929). (6.) Ihn Saud to Sir G. Clayton. (Translation.) WE acknowledge the receipt of your Excellency's letter of the 25th May, 1929, and we have noted certain points in it, on which we have to remark as follows :— 1. We have already informed you that the investigation which we ordered to be made into the regrettable attack on Mr. Crane and his companions proved that Ibn Hithlain and his party had no part in it. We did not give you the assurance that the people in question had no part in the crime from a desire on our part to lessen their responsibility, because you are aware of the extremely severe punishment we meted out to them because of their attacks on Iraq and Koweit territory. Our intention in sending such an assurance was to describe the facts as they occurred and to throw light on the incident, w^hich has been veiled around with much suspicion and ambiguity. 2. As for the question of the forts, our position in this matter is well known to you and to the British Government, since these forts are the original cause of most5 of the regrettable incidents which have taken place on the frontiers. As for your Excellency's statement that the use of the forts has been clearly shown, in that they were the means of preventing attacks in their neighbourhood, it is true in one sense but not in another. That no attack has happened in their vicinity is correct, but that they were the means of preventing the attacks is not correct. For you doubtless know that when forces marched last year to attack the forts and the frontiers, we sent certain people after them, who brought them back, in the hope that the problem would be solved in the course of the conversations which it was expected to hold with your Excellency. When they set out this year for the frontiers with the same intention, we ourselves went after the aggressors and dealt them a decisive blow which prevented them from reaching the Iraq frontiers. But, as we have already verbally informed your Excellency, if the Iraq Government believe that such forts will protect them against the Arabs of Nejd, we can decline all responsibility regarding any aggression that may occur against Iraq on account of these forts or others, and then the Iraq Government will defend themselves with their forts. We k believe that an expert would not consider such forts as conferring an advantage so im|ch as having brought harm, and likely to do still more harm, to Nejd and Iraq. This is the point we wish to explain, just as we expect our friend the general to do his best to put an end to any harm that may arise because of them. 3. As regards Captain Glubb and his activities, we have always believed that these activities on the frontiers, with the harm that has resulted and will still result to Nejd and Iraq, were not carried on with the knowledge of the British Govern ment. If such activities have been carried on with the knowledge and consent of the British Government, this is a matter for much regret to us, and we are convinced that the British Government does not fully appreciate the consequences of such activities and conduct. Captain Glubb personally has never for one instant been hateful to us, and was deserving of our respect when he met us at Jeddah, since he was in your Excellency's company. The activities we have noticed and which we believe to be harmful to the interests of both parties are those which we have mentioned to the British Govern ment and to your Excellency. We have therefore been criticising actions and not persons. 4. As regards the question of arranging a liquidation of treaties, the object of this is to agree on the stipulations of the treaties concluded between us and Iraq, on the points the execution of which still gives rise to dispute, and to fix a definite limit, without any possibility of further explanations and interpretations, in all those matters over which so much wrangling has taken place both verbally and in writing. The clearing up of such questions and their being put into one clear form into which no doubt or interpretation can enter will preclude any future disputes and will remove the causes of the present ones. This is what we have suggested to the British Government through you. You will find us always ready to meet whole-heartedly and sincerely every effort directed to the strengtheniug of relations between Nejd and Iraq.

Faisal al-Duwish's request Six, ' W With reference to my telegram No,600 dated 31st October and subsequent telegrams, I have the honour to submit the following report. ■' 1, On the night of the 30th October at about 7,30 p,m. His Stcellency the Shaikh sent round his Secretary to report to me that al-Duwish had written in asking for an interview at Jahrah or Saada the next or follow ing day, adding that he hoped I would meet him also. He had certain questions to ask, he said, as well as certain important information to impart. The Secretary added that as His Exoellenoy thought such interview would be useful especially as it was not known, if al- Duwish intended preventing the Awazim from entering Kuwait or not, he, the Shaikh, suggested that he should be allowed to see the Rebel Leader and that I shculd accompany him, I accordingly sent off my telegram y ii. uo, 600 early on the morning of 31st October, 2, On the same day (31st October) at 10,50 a.m, I visited the Shaikh to discuss a4-Duwish latest request, explaining at the same time that I had telegraphed you, and that we could do nothing till we received your reply 3, Whilst with the Shaikh and at about 11 a,m, a messenger accompanied by al-Duwish's nephew suddenly brought the startling news that al-Duwish himself witha considerable retenue had followed up Ms letter in person and had reached a point 6 miles from the city# The Shaikh who was very angry indeed sent for the Duwish's nephew, a mere boy, and to his face abused his uncle roundly for being a n worthless and thick headed Bedouin who could not wait a few hours for a reply to an ordinary letter* • ^e youth replied with spirit that no man could stop al-Duwish in anything, when once the latter* s mind was made up, nor would he the Shaikh be able to stop him from coming to Kuwait snxfrir now he had got so far and the city itself was in sight# His Sroellency much upset dismissed the youth and asked what my advice waso I suggested his being returned to his camp at once© But on the Shaikh pointing out that the Rebel Leader would certainly refuse to do this and would come straight on^ I came to the conclusion that the best means of ^turning' hiTn was to send a joint order to al-Duwish to retrace his stieps and then proceed half right to Jahrah, where he could await our reply# To insure his going back, xz a car was sent for him and he was invited by Abdullah bin Jabir the Commander of the Kuwait forces to proceed to Jahrah. The trick succeeded and at noon al-Duwish was successfully shephearded to Jahrah, but the situation was still difficult, and both His Excellency and I fully realized the danger of allowing al-Duwish to remain inside the Kuwait border# After a further discussion with the Shaikh, it was decided that I should send for Abdullah al Jabir from Jahrah and give him a definite order from myself to al-Duwish to quit Jahrah that night, informing him at the same time that no meeting could be held at all with him till he recrossed the border# As stated in my telegram No# 604 Abdullah was further instructed to obtain from the Rebel Leader either verbally or in writing exactly what he desired to say, and to tell him that tt it would be reported to His Majesty's G-overnment and if the latterthought necessary both His Excellency and I would be sent out to his camp to interview him© 5 # It was iuat about this time, and shortly after we had sent ott Abdullah on his second mission, that your telegram Ho # arrived impressing on me the necessity of meeting al-Duwish outside Kuwait territory in company nvt with His Excellency the Shaifclu 60 Abdullah who was very late in reaching Jahrah owing to his car breaking down duly relivered my message and after an all night discussion successfully got Duwish out 6f Jahrah two hours before dawn, on 1st November 1929 and across the border about 2^ hours later# With al- Duwish were the following Rebel Shaikhs:- Talah jJlbn Hanaiah. ) ) Dooshan Mohamed ibn Watban. ) ) Mutairo Mikhlif ibn Jarbuh. ) Muahi ibn Ashwan© ) ) Braih* Jazzah ibn Ashwan# ) also one hundred and twenty five retainers# 7 0 Abdullah bin Jabir returned to Kuwait at 10 aom# on 1st Hovember and reported to me verbally what he had done and delivered the message which al-Duwish desired to conveyed to His Majesty^ Grovernment# /c This I sent off to you under my telegram No# 606 of the same date. Abdullah also brought a personal and rather typical letter frcm the Akhwan Leader, translation of which I append totiis report# 8# Among dbta other interesting statements made by Duwish to Abdullah the following is I think worth of record# s e stated that Bin Saud had spread the report among the Ataiba that he had received recently a letter from Shaikh Ahmad of Kuwait^ to the effect that as he Bin Saud had now destroyed the Rebels in Hassa, he the Shaikh of Kuwait desired to be allowed to take over and protect the Mutair and Ajman women and children who had survived the King^ chastisement, and that he intended placingn.

WITH reference to Foreign Office despatch No. 71 of the 11th April last, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Henderson to transmit to you the accompanying copies of a revised memorandum on the question of the channels to be used for communications between His Majesty King Ibn Saud, or the Hejaz-Nejd Government, and the High Commissioners for Iraq, Palestine and Transjordan, and certain British officers in the Persian Gulf. The present memorandum should be substituted for that enclosed in the Foreign Office despatch referred to above. 2. You will observe that insertions have been made in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the original memorandum so as to cover the question of communications regarding Hejaz-Nejd affairs to and from posts in the Persian Gulf. I am, &amp;c. G. W. RENDEL. Enclosure in No. 1. Communications with Ibn Saud. UNTIL August 1928 communications intended for Ibn Saud were sent through His Maiesty's agent and consul at Jeddah when Ibn Saud was in the Hejaz, or through the Resident in the Persian Gulf (at Bushire) when Ibn Saud was m Nejd. 2 In August 1928, Ibn Saud requested that this arrangement should no longer be followed, but that in future all communications should be addressed to him through His Majesty's agent and consul, even during his periods of residence m Nejd It may, therefore, now be laid down as a general rule that all communications for Ibn Saud shall pass through His Majesty's agency at Jeddah. ^ + 3 The High Commissioners at Bagdad and Jerusalem are authorisea to correspond direct with Ibn Sand on matters of detail arising out of the Bahra and Hadda agreements, and such communications will ordinarily he sent through Mis Maiesty's agent at Jeddah, who will act merely as a channel of communication. In cases of extreme urgency, however, it will still be open to the High Commissioners to communicate with Ibn Saud through the quickest available channel, while sending a repetition or copy to His Majesty's agent and consul at Jeddah. ( Communications intended for Ibn Saud will ordinarily be addressed to His Majesty s agent at Jeddah direct bv the High Commissioners concerned, but copies in the case of despatches, and repetitions in the case of telegrams, should in every case be sent to the Colonial Office. 4. As a general rule, such communications, whether sent by telegram or despatch, will be transmitted textually by His Majesty's agent at Jeddah, and they should be drafted on that understanding. His Majesty's agent will, however, have discretion, more particularly in the case of telegrams, to introduce any minor modifications of style or wording which, in the light of his local knowledge he may consider desirable. It will, further, be open to His Majesty s agent at Jeddah, m any case where he considers that the proposed communication raises issues of political importance, to refer to the Foreign Office for instruction. Information received from the Iraqi and Transjordan Governments respecting raids on their tribes by Neidian tribesmen and other minor frontier incidents, or replies from those Govern ments to complaints by the Hejazi Government respecting raids on Hejazi or Nejdian tribesmen and other minor frontier incidents, should, subject to the proviso indicated above, be communicated by His Majesty's agent to the Hejazi Government, without awaiting the receipt of instructions from London. TT . . „ . 5 Communications for Ibn Saud, or regarding Nejdian or Hejazi affairs, from lyaq, Transjordan, Palestine or the Persian Gulf posts, on all other questions, [903 q—1]should be addressed to the Colonial Office, but repeated, or copied, to J eddah in every case. In such cases His Majesty's agent at Jeddah will not take official action on the communication until specifically authorised to do so by the Foreign Office. He may, however, if the matter to be dealt with is in any way urgent, take such informal action with the competent Hejazi authorities as he may think desirable. 6. Similarly, His Majesty's agent at Jeddah may address the High Commissioners for Iraq, Trans j or dan and Palestine, the Political Resident at Bushire and the political agents at Koweit and Bahrein, direct on points of fact, on matters of routine, or in reply to enquiries, sending a repetition, or copy, in each case to the Foreign Office, and in the case of Koweit and Bahrein to the Resident in the Persian Gulf also; while, on all other questions, he will address the Foreign Office direct, sending a repetition or copy to Bagdad or Jerusalem, when either is concerned, and reporting in each case in the body of the telegram or despatch that he has done so.

You should inform Ibn Saud in reply to his memorandum of September 14th, that His Majesty's Government gladly agree to his posting a force near the Iraqi frontier to intercept rebels. They would further welcome any proposals which he may be prepared to make for the establishment of close liaison on the frontier, and suggest that he should designate emissaries to Keep the local frontier authorities in Iraq and Koweit informed of the movements of his troops and of the rebels. His Majesty's Government regret, however, that they cannot reconsider their previous decision against any crossing of either frontier by Ibn Saud's forces. As Ibn Saud has already been assured, all possible steps will be taken to prevent the use oi iraq and Koweit as a refuge by Akhwan rebels, and the local milioary authorities have been authorised if necessary to uaice V drastic action to achieve this object- Ito Saud will, however, himself realise that it rebels should succeed either in crossing frontier with their women and children, or in effecting junction with latter in Iraqi or Koweiti temtory, local miliuaiy d^dunoixui-os may...... -i mimay be placed in most embarrassing position, xds Majesty 's Government therefore hope that Ton Sand will be able to take effective measures to prevent such a contingency arising.

Insurgents accompanied by their ?/omen and children have in fact entered Koweit territory and have been prevailed upon to leave. In the event of a further influx of refugees into Koweit it must, in my opinion, rest with the local authorities, acting in the light of existing instructions, to take such steps as are practicable to expel them, obtaining the assistance of armoured cars should this be necessary. His Majesty^ Grovernment are not themselves in a position to devise special measures in advance to deal with such a situation. 3. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Acting High Commissioner for Iraq.. I have the honour to be.

Should there be objec tion to this which s unaware of^ he suggest^ to ensure order ^nd to avoid possible cause of friction and unplea santness^ the Dhafir and Shammar now grazing in his territory and watering at Safwan be transferred to some of many wells existing south of railroad, for instance, Shajra, Baswa, Abu Ghar, Nabha or Chabda, the last named in particular having a supply of water for any number of camels with an inexhaustiole supply of graz^in the vicinity. Sheikh rather pertinently asks why his territory^which he wants for his own people^should be selected for the grazing of •Iraq camels in, iihen »Iraq has superb grazing available near at hand. Sheikh adds his above remarks are not in tended to apply to the special migration of the Muntafiq shepherds tribes into Kuwait which is of advantage to him self as well as to shepherds %ing to the wool and ghi they bring in. (unquote) if'/tU? WhiIst/notwish to raise an unnecessary awkward Jh issae I cannot lal sympathise with Sheiid^s pointer of view especially as from my knowledge of the country in question I know that he is right about this there being an abundance of water and grazing at the places mentioned by him.

I would further suggest that tho original in- formation has been sent by al-NaJlsi of this town, who Is, as you know. Bin Saud's agent, and highly interested in pushing his master's propaganda in 'Iraq, I say this as I hare seen the original of one of al-Nafisi's letter to a friend in Zubair (it was brought back to Kuwait &amp; shown to the Shaikh &amp; myself as an instance of the type of news that al-Nafisi was forwarding to Zubair) which oontained almost word for word the same statements as hare been made by Captain Buttolph and Captain Burton in particular where the presence of rebels has been reported inside Kuwait territory, 8, I do not wish it to be thought that I write in a carping or critical spirit but both officers apart from making several incorrect statements about thebattle of Zagalr etc* whioh may be excused as being open to argument, bar* suggested or stated as facts the following:- (a)* That Many of the rebels, both AJman and Matalr bad aeoped close to Kuwait Town (under the mils la fast). (b) That other rebels bad mixed with the Shaikhs Bashaida tribe at Jahara to escape notice. (Oaptaiu Bttttolph*s statement). (o) That some of the rebels (Uutair) vers camped at Arhaiyah 10 wiles south of Jahara \ (Captain Burton's statement)* (4) That al-Duwish with his family had arrired at Tawil wall In Kuwait territory end 10 miles North West of Subaihiyeh, , * (a) That part of the rebel under their leader Naif al Hithlain (Abal Kllab) had camped at 3hlaiba on the coast, end 80 miles Inside Kuwait territory (Captain Barton's statement). (f) That the Jiblan section of the rebel Mutair j£ had camped at Manaqlsh hills, 15 miles west of subalhlyeh with the implication that they were across the border (Oaptaln Burton's atatemetit) • (g) That the Shaikh of Kuwait had supported the rebel loaders la their negotlatioms with the Iwazim with a latter pressing than to enter Kuwait territory and that this would undoubtedly bo viewed by Bin saud as a further aot of the abalVb of Kuwait's hos tility (Captain Buttolph's statement). 3, In wiew of the expressly stated policy of His Majesty* s Government, that no rebels ere to be allowed inside Kuwait territory, the serious nature of the above statements are obvious. And I think it not onlydesirable , but fair in tbe interests of Els SxoeHenoy the Shaikh of Kuwait not to mention my o*n ; that suoh statements be emphatioally denied. The shaikh of Kuwait's position Tis-a-Tis Bin Saud Is diffioult enough as It Is, without reports of suoh nature being sent in* 4. That the sane stories have already been passed on to Bin saud by al-Nafisi, there can be no doubt, and that I shall before long be asked to oaoment on them. Is also eertain jbut while It is fairly easy to refute charges made by Bin Saud's agents, it is highly undesirable to hare to enter Into a wordy disoussion as to the merits or demerits of British officers* reports* The point I think is obTious. 8* I hare already protested in by telegram Ko»598 of 30th Oetober on Captain Buttolph's letter forwarded under Els Szcellancy the High Cassaissioner*s No,8013 of 2Srd October, Z shall merely oonfine myself to Captain Burton's report, my casaaents on which will bf found attached.

Thla has bean rather held up by my absanoa on tour la the Amarah Uwa, and also by tha faat that I was anxious to gat as Bany reports froon, as nany souroes as possible on the recent events south of tha Kuwait frontier, before render- a report on th# •Ituatioiu As you wiU sea, my lnfo«atton on the fight on 5/10 and subsequent erents differs froa that reoelred by you in oartain Important respects. I received a largo number of reports from varied sooroaa, acne of which I know to ho usually reliable, and as a result I think that the account I have given in this report is a fair Bumnary of the events. All the reports I received agreed that the Avazim fe Ibn Sand's people got slightly the best of the show, although the Awazim undoubtedly received as severe casualties as the Ajman. X am also inclined to plaoe the rebel locations further north than you do in fact, as you see fm m 'Stop Press- news, latest reports are quite definite about many of them being in Kuweit territory, and s«e of the AJman in the Sh«niyah. the latter has been consistently reported ever since the fight on 5/10. There are also numerous reports from everywhere about this concentration in Bashuh, and their move to Hafar al Batin. I wonder whether you have heard anything about it? Most of the newa from that Direction usually comes up to Safsan and Sutoan, ao perhaps you have no information on this. It is curious how reports from Bahrain tend to■ 2 ' /// a To exagarate news in favour of Ibn Saud, to an even greater extent than the rebel protagonists in Kuwait, and for tbat reason I em not inclined to put muoli faith in these vague reports of ooneentration i$ the Hasa district.But I hare had many reports froa all orer the place of a large force with $aud ibn Saud at Hasa t and also of a con centration at Hafar al Aj, where they say that Ibn Saud btmself has arrlred, although I doubt that myself. She JLtalbah still seem to be causing a good deal of trouble, but perhaps this more to Hafar al Batin is an indication that Ibn Sand thinks that if he can finish off Dawish, the rest wlU be easyt I was rery glad to get all your telegrams, for which very many thinks, I thought it as well to let you know the gist of the infomation I have reoad.rod on these , events, although X sa afraid you will disagree with a good deal of itI Still, having regard to the variety of sources froa which Z obtained by reports, I could not very well pat another construction on the events. I am enclosing a note to Mrs* Dickson in answer to hers about seme stores froa Ashar, which have left by boat. With kind regards.

From a large n\aib«r of report* reoeiToi fraa t*- rlous souroas, It Is consider«d that the following Is a fairly aoourate outline of the engagement between the rebels and Ibn Baud's forces and the Awalm on 5th Oot:- 1. The AJaan attacked the Awazlm camp in the rlelnlty of NadJIra at dawn on 5th October, After serere fighting, in whleh both sides suffered heavy casualties, and Hazsm ibn rwan Ibn Hithlaln (Ajman), was killed, the i-wazlm suooeeded is driving off the Ajmsn* Naif ibn Hithlaln was wounded in this encounter. 8 On this 7aisal ad-Dawlsh ordered Farhan ite. ito«v»n&gt; and All ibn Ashwan, with a force of oaralry, to attack the Baai Khalid, Bani Hajir, and Ibn 6aud*s regular troops under Muhansaed as—Suhalli and Abdul Asia ibn Tuxki Aim Dhaar, iho ware also in the neighbourhood of the Awaslm. camp. This attach met with success at first and it appears that the Uutair were about to gain a decissire victory, when reinforcements of the Awaatim, under Mubarak ibn Drei, arrived, and succeeded In driving off the Mutair, The casualties in this latter fight were not so great, and the Uutair withdrew successfully, but apparently without any desire to renew the combat* All aba Shuwalrbat and All ibn Ashwan of the rebels, and Uuhanaad as-Sohaili of Ibn Saud's forces, were severely wounded, S, Subsequent to these engagements, the remnants of the AJman and Mutair retreated northwards and camped in tie area Wafrah -Mlshash-Shitaf, and the Awasim, Bani Khalid, and Hajir, with Abdul Asia ibn Turki Abu Dhaar, at al Badjsa, The latter later on wlttidrew to Juball with his regular troops and a caw of the Bani Shalid and Bani Hajir, leaving the Awazlm at al-BadJsa, where they are now, 4. Mi y whoy and Mutair retreated into Ku wait terri tory and quite a number cf scattered tents are still 11il&gt; ''fc. ■ raport eA to to a 1' th«. in maAlate Tlalalty of KulttiA toro* 5. It now appears to be quite certain that tke rebels hare come to terms with the iwuim at BftdjM* and they hare agreed not to interfere with one another's movemant* Messengers errired from Send ibn Saud (how at Base), ebot* 18th Ootober with letters/the Awazim reprorring them for maTHng terms with rebels, and stating that he was sending than, reinforcements. 6.

Abu Dhaar, but falling to locate him, returned to Shltaf on Iftth Ootober, It ie reported that he captured a supply oolunn In the neighbourhood of Nts* 7. A report, considered fairly reliable, states that on 13th Ootober fifty esmelman of Subai raided Dhawi Bashld, (Mutair), near Ash-Shaq^, looting 400 oamelso (b) Rebel Looaticne. 8. The following are glren as the present locations of the rebel forces, and are beliered to be fairly accurate Faisal ad-Dawish at Miahash abu Dhaar, (South East of Wafrah)• A report of unknown reliability reoelwed on 86th Ootober, that ha aored to SUb aihiyeh on 81st October, but this is unconfirmed from other sources, and oennot be considered as more then a rumour at presant. 9.

I have received a letter from the King dated November 17th with reference to my letter to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs of Movemher 1st. Following is its gist. News regarding the Awazim is incorrect; It is possibly a trick of Doweish in order to have friends within Koweit territory whom he can use. Even supposing it were a fact, is it lawful, for the Sheikh of Kuwait in present critical circuiiistances to allow portion of King^s subjects to leave his country and settle in the Sheikhas territory.? King therefore protests strongly against the Sheikh of Kuwait as also against the approval given to it 'by the British Government and requests that all persons claiming to he Awazim or other subjects of His Majesty's who may have taken refuge in Kuwait should he expelled at once as this .embarrasses his action against the rebels.

Messenger from Eiyadah to Amir Peisal in Jeddah has brought report that Doweish has asked for pardor hut that Ibn Saud has replied that this is a matter which only Shariaat can decide. Eeport adds that King proposes to attaog; at once in 'force. It is privately stated that Bin Saud intends attacking Kuwait* as the Sheikh s&amp;s supporting the rebels. In this connection it is significant that in my eonversat- -ion yesterday with Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs the latter restated somewhat amphatieally his case against Kuwait. He also handed me a Ala' Memoire which he said represented only his own personal views. It is mainly a tirade against the perfidy of Kuwait, similar to Hon Saud's memorandum enclosed in my despatch of September 30th No 255 though it states in addition that Incidents have taken place in Kuwait which are difficult to explain except on the grounds that His Majesty's Government have gone hack on their undertakings. Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs also demanded with insistence that any rehel entering Kuwait or Iraq, should he arrested, tried and punished and that, in accordance with international law, he should be disarmed In this he said he also spoke for the Hedjaz Government. News of-Dawish*s submission had not yet 'been received 'by him. 'The coincidence of the King's projected move to the vicinity of the 'border of Kuwait as foreshadowed by Hafiz Watiba (see my telegram No 165 of r' r '@!

Before every- -thing Thn 3aud must improve the food situation of Nejd, where famine conditions prevail. Situation is aggrav -ate^d by lack of transport. To sum up, Dawish does not appear to contemplate submission as a result of milit -ary pressure but at the dictates of common sense. Though he is immensely strong judging by Arab standards he feels that without friends or supplies he cannot hope for ultimate success; with unimpaired forces he realises theftbn Saud is likely to offer him generous terms now.

I have received a letter from the King dated 17th Hovemher of which following is gist:- Tlie re'bels, who have learnt of Ihn Saud t s imminent attack, have 'been advised from high quarters in neighbouring countries to scatter if they cannot with- -stand him and to save themselves 'by mingling with the ■ AraTis or Iraq, and Kuwaiti. He says that paragraphs 4, 5 and 5 of my letter of Ootoher 16th (vide my despatch No. 268) ' ' call for special attention. Referring to paragraph 4 he says he has not the least intention of crossing the frontiers of Mesopotamia or Kuwait. His request for permission to do this is only as a precautionary measure to he acted upon when absolutely necessary and in the event of forces in Kuwait and Iraq 'being unahle to prevent the insurgents from taking refuge there when pressed 'by him. In such an event is he to withdraw leaving the mutineers safe in Kuwait territory firee to create fresh trouble or what does the British Government expect him to do ? As to paragraph 5 it is obvious that the British Grovernment knows of rebels^ intention to scatter amongst Arabs of Kuwait and Iract when hard pressed. As regards the hope expressed in this paragraph he wishes the British g -overnment would have explained how he can prevent the rebels entering Kuwait and Iraq when the Government 61/14. P. British Agent, Jeddah. Secretary of State for foreign Affairs, London, ETo. 174. Political Resident, Bushire, High Gommis^ioner, Baghdad, Political Agent, Kuwait,V Government of Kuwait has not prevented tiiem and they are still watering their animals within refuge of Kuwait territory, he himself heing debarred from entering. As the British Government must realise, the position is difficult for him. As he has already started and expects to establish contact with the rebels in a few days and as it is essential to seize the first opportunity of attack in desert warfare, he suggests the following (a) that the Kuwait Government should order their subjects to collect in an appointed locality far from any likely scene of action and should cover them wtzl with an armed force. He should be informed of the locality chosen. Having done this the Shaikh's Govern- -ment should place an adequate force on the frontier to repel the rebels. He does not think the Air Force alone would suffice. British Government officials should be with the two forces (presumably Bin 3aud # s and the Kuwait frontier forces). Frontier force should push back insurgents as far as possible even operating within Nejd itself. Should any Arabs succeed in crossing the frontier they should be arrested and handed over so that there would lae no need for him to cross the frontier himself. ('b) if all this is impossible he suggests that Kuwait suhjeots should be oonaentrated as in (a) and that he should then he left free to pursue the rebels anywhere. In this oase he undertakes to protect the subjects of neighbouring countries from any aggression. He also promises that immediately after the pursuit of the in- -surgents is over he will not leave a single soldier in those countries. Thus the rebels will be annihilated. In his opinion this is the only waj to deal with the problem and exterminate the mutineers; after all his efforts, trouble and expense he cannot return ['m without completely ekjoxxjis crushing them. If/ /v s) If neither suggestion is agreed to 'by the British Government the GonsequenGes will 'be regretted. He grieves for the suffering which he is inflicting on part of his subjects and on their women and children when noth-* -ing originally obliged him to punish them except the fact that they have violated assurances (given 'by him to the British Government) 'by ajbtacking Iraq, and Kuwait subjects. It was in order to safeguard his pledge that he felt it was incumbent on him to punish them most severely. If neighbouring countries do not wish to assist him in his efforts to secure the safety of their subjects he does not whish his action to result in clasfc. between his forces — particularly as he is commanding his forces in person —and those of the British Government. This is the situation which he is trying to avoid and which, please god, will never arise. If the immediately fore- -going presj^umption is correct he would have to abandon not only punitive measures undertaken but also a plan for ensuring internal security, in v/hich case he will not be responsible for any aggression against neighbouring countries. He will be justified before himself and the world for he will have fought against his own people ior the sake of neighbours who give shelter uo theii own % deadly enemies and help them against himselx. He is now setting forth* If either of his two suggestions is met, well and good. If not he will be regretfully compelled to adopt the last mentioned attitude and^eclining all responsibility will take no further measures to prevent , attacks against neighbouring countries. These countries will then be responsible. BRITISH AGENT.ai/i4. Telegram Prom To Repeated P. British Agent, Jeddah.

He suggests that the Kuwait yrcTsffreg Gov- -ernment should collect its subjects in an appointed locality far from likely scene of action which should be notified to him and that either the Shaikh should place an adequate force on the frontier to repel raiders ( he does not consider Air Force alone would suffice ) or he '(Bin Saud) should be free to pursue rebels anywhere. In this case he undertakes to protect the subjects of neighbouring countries and to remove his forces the moment pursuit is over. He contends that it is in fulfilment of pledge to His Majesty's Government to prevent raids into adjacent territories that he is acting against rebels and he particularly wishes to avoid clash between his forces and those of the British Government. But he will repudiaterepudiate responsiMlity for aggression against neigh- -'bouring countttes if his proposals are not accepted. British Agent stajtes that runour regairding Bin Saud f s intention to attack Kuwait is current among higher orficials and that he learns from fairly reliahle source that King has heen expending oonsiderahle sums in fostering pro Bin Saud movement in Kuwait and that mam object of Hafiz Y/ahha^s visit is to gauge and if occasion arises take charge of movement.

Dawish himself, who is now in itexa: Qaraa South ¥est of Taallat Ramadi watering camels at Wafra, is proceeding with all Mutair and Ajman to Jariya es Sifla and Safa. I have therefore countermanded request for armoured cars. Dickson and Shaikh consider that prospect of attack 'by Bin Saud is remote. In their opinion Dawish,ix judged 'by Arah standards, is immensely strong while Bin Saud is weak. Dawish is not submitting owing to military necessity hut because he realises that with no friends or supplies ultimate success is impossible and he hopes that 'by surrendering while his forces are still unimpaired he will obtain generous terms.

( Fear I am unahle to understand arguments put forward. ) From all sources of Shaikh's information, which hitherto has 'been extremely good, the nearest Bin Baud's proved concentrations, apart from insignificant force near Artawiyah, are at Ajihba and at Hafar Atz, each over ZOO miles from the Kuwait frontier across parched desert in which no raiil has fallen this year. The whole of the rehifel force, which is greatly superior to anything Bin Saud can put in the field intervenes and is ahout to occupy the line Jariya^Wahra and Safa, 90 miles from the Kuwait frontier. The rebels are further contemplating suing for peace as such course is now to their advantage. Should Ihn Saud however (foolishly) drive them to extremes 'by imposing impossihle demands, which I do not (for a (it seems prohahle) moment) anticipate, ( I have no doubt) that Bin Saud will (fare hadly.)
