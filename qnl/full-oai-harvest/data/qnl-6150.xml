The British were concerned that recognising the title would compromise treaties acknowledging the independence of other Arab chiefs.The papers include: reports by the High Commissioner, Egypt, Sir Arthur Henry McMahon; reports and discussion of the issue by the India Office, the Foreign Office, British officials in the Middle East, British diplomats, and the Government of India; suggestions for alternative titles by McMahon, the French Government, the Government of India, and others; the vital importance, in the British view, of supporting the Sharif's military operations against the Ottoman Turks (e.g. folio 134); the question of whether to allow the circulation of the newspaper
                           Kiblain Egypt in order to inform the Egyptian public of the Sharif's move, 1916; references to the views and actions of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Edward Lawrence [T E Lawrence] (e.g. folios 6-7); the British decision that the most suitable title for the Sharif would be 'Malik-el-Hejaz', translated as 'King of the Hedjaz [Hejaz]' (folio 36); and discussion of the reactions of Bin Saud [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd].The French language content of the papers consists of approximately ten folios of diplomatic correspondence.There are no papers in the volume dated 1917 (for which, see IOR/L/PS/10/638).The file includes a divider which gives the subject number, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Grand Sharif of Mecca</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Hejaz</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Egypt</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Titles</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000214#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000214#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000214#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000214#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
