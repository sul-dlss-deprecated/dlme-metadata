On the 1st of April, the Abbot of the G-yantse monastery gave a party to local officials and the Agency staff. During the party I had a long conversation with Tsoko Depon Surpa (Revised V/ho* s 77ho page 38) who talked at some length about aeroplanes flying over Tibet. He told me that some of the G-yantse headmen had recently returned from Shigatse, with the news that an aeroplane passed over Shigatse at dawn on the 19th of ..iarch 1944 and tha; a number of people had seen the plane flying towards the 2ast. Since the American plane crashed near Lhasa last November, aeroplanes flying over Tibet have been the main topic of conversation amongst local Tioetan officials, and I feel that it is more than likely that reports are invented from time to time, because the inventor invariably becomes the centre of local interest.-iJxt, 2249/44 CONITDJ 2 OTIA.L Extract from Gyantse News Report for the period ending the 13 th April 1944- 2, Ta-Sur, the Tibetan official deputed to supervise the annual grain collection in Gyantse, told me on the 13th April th.;t the aeroplane sightea over Shigatse on 19th of larch was Chinese, This report has been circulated by a Chinese residing in Shigatse,CONFIDENTIAL .

However, I have no reason to change my opinion that it was not an aeroplane which was seen but sane natural phenomenon. Nearly all officials are still convinced that it was an aeroplane, but many shepherds at once described the light as a '’Cho' 1 or sane kind of meteor. This morning, March 26th at 1015 hours there was a prolonged thunder-like rumble away to the north of Lhasa, although the sky was perfectly clear. In the present state of Lhasa nerves regarding aeroplanes, I will not be at all surprised if this is also described as emanating from an aeroplane.# CONFIDENTIAL . • Ext. 1863/44.

Gyantse has reported that about the same time and date, lights green and white were seen north of the dzong. There are a few officials in Lhasa who do not believe an aeroplane was seen in this area, but the great majority are convinced that the light in the sky (and there seems little doubt that a light of some sort was seen) was from an aeroplane.Ext» 1035A4&gt; &amp; Extract from Yatung News Re-port for the period enlinj; the 31st Januar^/-, 1944* !• Please refer to para. 1 of my news report dated the 17th January, 1944* It is reported that when the five .American airmen arrived at Phari on 5th January, 1944, the Chinese traders there jointly gave a sum of Hs. 120/- to the aimen.

It is to the effect that the Tibetan Government fully realise that orders have been issued by the United States Government to the United States Army Air Force not to fly over Tibet and that the recent incident was due solely to an error of navigation when the aeroplane was enroute from China to Assam by night.

The report illustrates the hostile relations existing between the Tibetans and Chinese in Lhasa and it is significant that the stone-throwing incidents by the Tibetan populace happened only when the airmen were at the Chinese Representative’s residence or in Chinese company. Dr. Rung himself appears to have behaved in a very arbitrary way to the Tibetan Government over the incident.

Subject: News letter of the Gyantse Trride Agency for the period ending the 31st December, 1943 * The American airmen arrived in Gyantse on the 2 th of December and left for India on the 31st. Two members of the party fell sick shortly after they arrived in Gyantse and it was considered advisable for the party to halt until the sick men recovered. The Americans were impressed by the apparent friendliness of the Tibetan Government in Lhasa, but were surprised at the hostile attitude of the population. On one occasion, when they were on their way to the British Mission accompanied by Chinese guides, there was a halfhearted attempt to stone the party. The strained relations between the Tibetans and the Chinese in Lhasa did not escape the notice of the Americans^ I understand that an English speaking Chinese official told them that the Tibetans regarded the airmen as devils. It is difficult to Judge whether or not this was a mild form of Chinese propaganda, but there appears to be little doubt that the arrival of the Americans in Lhasa stirred up a fair amount of indignation. While in Gyantse the party expressed a wish to see the Gyantse monastery. In view of rumours, current in Lhasa regarding the ^ephistophelian of airmen*, I decided it may be unwise for them to visit the Pal-chho.(£y O'! .. nb( r 15tS T c? He d on the Fbreigp.
