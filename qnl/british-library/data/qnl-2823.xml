Mainly requirements are iron and brass bars of various sizes, and sheet brass and copper, to be worked up in Persia for domestic and agriculture use. For finished products there is little demand. Much inconvenience and hard ships have resulted from practically complete stoppage of exports of metal in bars and sheets and the institution of a ration seems best way of meeting case. Customs, Bombay, can scarcely be in a position to judge of merits of applica tions from Persian Ports and inland towns, e g., Dizful where stoppage of imports of metals has caused considerable hardship which has unfavourable political effect. Hence I should be glad of further consideration of proposed ration as in case of tin.

From—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Baghdad. Although at present there is no great shortage of tin in India there is very serious shortage of copper, brass and cetain sorts of iron goods which precludes possibility of giving Collectors of Customs any general discretion. Munitions Board now agree however to withdraw concession m favour or copper and brass domestic utensils and to allow in its place a fixed monthly ration of copper and brass sheets and bars. Please telegraph urgently estimate of minimum monthly requirements of each and let us know what territory this ration is intended to cover. Prom every point of view it would be con venient if ration agreed on were consigned to you or to political officers named bv you by the Indian Munitions Board and distributed at your discretion. Beference in mv telegram of 14th January regarding treatment of applications to export iron goods appears to have been misunderstood by you. Custorns do not attempt to consider relative merits of the consignees. In the absence of special recommendations from your end on political or military grounds cases are decided after reference to Munitions Board solely on question of whether demand in India for war purposes enables articles to be spared. Quantity of iron now going to the Gulf is being closely observed by munitions Board and, owing to constantly altering conditions in India, the Board thinks that for the time being the present arrangement should remain in force.

This Mercury was exported from the United Kingdom under the authority of Licence Do. 14609/17 A issued by this Department on the 7th September last, and I am accordingly to suggest that in the oircurnstancres a cable may be sent to the Grovernment of India authorising the release of this consignment. g/st have the honour to be Sir, Your obedient Servant, 22nd January, 1918.

Reverting to the above issued early in September last in respect of a shipment per s.s. 'CHIIIKOA'' from London to Bombay in transit for Bushire, Persia-1 Gulf, we have to-day received a telegram from our Bombay Porwarding Agents that the Indian Authorities are requiring documentary proof that this shipment was duly licensed on this side before they will grant the necessary release. The fact that shipment has been allowed should be sufficient proof to them as the Customs Officials on this side will not allow any prohibited goods to pass through without your Export Licence accompanies same, and of course this document is retained by them as usual. We had occasion to write you about a similar difficulty on the 11th December in respect of some shipments of Tin, to which you replied on the 19th December reference 317923/17 R.T. informing us that the necessary instructions for release had been telegraphed through the India^ Office to Bombay. We must ask you to please give instructions at once for a telegram to be despatched immediately releasing the 4 bottles Quicksilver now held up quite unnecessarily in Bombay, and shall be glad of your Assurance ohat this has been done so that we may at once cable a reply to the telegram we have received. We would add that if the Indian Authorities are to continue oneir present attitude it will be essential that your licences be 1issued in duplicate (one copy to be retained by us for sending abroad) or that a certificate be sent us from your Department which we can pass on with our other documents to Bombay in order to obviate this unnecessary expense of telegrams and the annoying delay and inconvenience that is being caused.

Understand that customs Bombay intimate that they no longer insist on objection certificate from Political A Officer concerned before allowing export of metals or other prohibited articles to Persian Gulf ports and Basra. Is this in accordance with your wishes in India? If export IS allowed without certificate from Political Officer concerned trade with enemy will be difficult to check.

No. 973-W, Prom The Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, To The Hon* ble Major-General Sir Percy Cox, G.C.I.E., K.C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Baghdad. Dated Simla, the 13th October 1917. In reply to your telegram of the 30th of September 1917, No. 4056, I am directed to say that the custom of requiring no-objection certificates in the case of metals arose originally from the necessity of preventing these from reaching enemy hands. The position has j altered to such an extent that exports of these articles (with the exception of tin which is referred to below) are now only allowed when they tn are required for special reasons connected with the war. So long as they are restricted in this way, it does not seem necessary that no-objection certificates should be required, since these would presumably be ti given as a matter of bourse in cases where the article was essential for war purposes. 2. Certificates of this nature have never been required Sirin respect of other articles, end, consequently, the abandonment of the requirement does not affect the position except in regard to metals. If you consider it desirable to institute a general system of no-objection certificates in regard to articles in respect of which internal requirements have not led to so strict a system of control as is the case with metals, then the Govt, of India will be glad to have definite proposals on the point from you. In the absence of such, however, they do not consider that any action is necessary. 3. I am to add that in the particular case of tin, at the instance of the Tin and Rubber Exports Committee in London , re-exports of tin from India to Persia and the Persian Gulf have been limited to a ration of 10 tons quarterly. The Collector of Customs, Bombay, has been given discretion to allow exports freely within these limits, and as this metal is thus not restricted to consignees who require it for war purposes, it is considered desirable that no-objection certificates should still be required from importers of this article. Instructions are, therefore, being issued to the Collector of Customs BombayBombay, only to allow export of tin on production of such a certificate from the political authorities concernea. 4. A copy of this letter is being forwarded to the Deputy Chief Political Officer, Basra, and the Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bufehire. The latter officer is also being furnished with a copy of your telegram referred to in paragraph 1 shove. I have, etc., f/hi-! SdA Denys Eray, Deputy Secretary to the Government of IndiaCOPY.

My dear Green, Will you please refer to my demi-official letters Nos. 10698, dated the 7th of September 1917, and 8613, dated the 7th of July 1917. I am to say that the requirement of no-otiection certificates in respect of shipments of metals was with drawn on the ground that in any case such shipments would not, as a rule, he sanctioned hy the Government of India unless they were required for purposes connected with the prosecution of the war. In the case of tin, however, you have been given a more or less free hand in regard to exports within the quarterly limit of 10 tdns, and I am therefore to say that nonobjection certificates should, in future, be required in respect of exports of tin, as otherwise it is possible that this commodity might find its way into undesirable hands.

In connection with the pressure of Russian commercial influence from the ^orth into Central Persian markets, particularly the province of Ispahan, the ollowing facts are noteworthy.

Everything points to further accessions of the tea trade via Russia and spread of the import via Russia southwards, with a corresponding decrease of import at the Gulf ports. Question of freights and possible check on tea trade in Russia. The diversion of Indian and Batavian and China teas from the Persian Gulf to the Black and Caspian Seas has undoubtedly been fostered by the opening of the Batoum-Baku, Batoum-Tabriz and Batcum-Mashad routes to this trade. But the reason for the rapid encroachment of the import via Russia into the commercial sphere in Persia up till lately supplied almost entirely via the Persian Gulf, notwithstanding the far greater distance to be travelled, is probably to be found in :— (a) High shipping freights from India to the Persian Gulf, as compared with freights from India to Batoum. (b) High rates of transport hire from the Gulf and Kermanshah to » Ispahan, which have been exorbitant and still are far too high. As regards (a) a considerable check on imports to Persia via Russia might possibly be affected if the principal British shipping line to the Gulf (the British India Steam Navigation Company) would make rates of freight considerably lower, at any rate as a temporary experiment, in order to see if cargoes of tea from Calcutta and Bombay to the Gulf showed signs of increasing, and com peting better with consignments to Batoum. It will be seen from the letter from the Director-General of Commercial Intelligence in India, attached herewith, that freights on tea by British India Steam Navigation Company, Limited, are :— Calcutta to Baghdad (for Kermanshah, Hamadan, Ispahan, etc.) Calcutta to Bushire Calcutta to Bushire vid Bombay Rs. 50 per ton of 50 cubic feet. 30 do. do. 26 - 14-0 per ton. (Probably over Rs. 30 with Bombay charges, or by rail.) On the other hand it costs by :— Rs. A. p. Messageries Maritimes from Calcutta all the way to Batoum ... ... ... only 25 14 o per 20 cwt. Austrian Lloyd from Calcutta to Batoum ... 30 o o per ton, soc-h* Russian Volunteer Fleet from Calcutta to Batoum 30 o o do. do. £ While as regards Persian transport charges of tea, from Bushire to Shiraz costs about ... 15I per ton. Shiraz to Ispahan costs about ... u do. (camel hire),The charges per ton from Batoum to Baku by rail, from Baku to Enzeh by steamer and over the short distance between Enzeli and Resht are not known here, but it is clear that the total cost per ton from Batoum to Ispahan must be considerably cheaper than from Bushire or Baghdad to Ispahan. As regards ( 3 ) high rates of transport hire from Bushire to Ispahan and Kermanshah to Ispahan, combination among forwarding merchants in Bushire has made it possible to bring rates down and keep them steady during the diffi cult period of scarcity experienced in Persia in 1913-14, and it is hoped that a good harvest in 1914 will permit of a return to still more moderate and normal rates between Bushire and Shiraz. Cost of transport and the capacity for forwarding large quantities of tea and other goods from Bushire to Ispahan are, however, seriously hampered and affected by the dispersion and dearth of transport animals on the road and the growing seriousness of this problem, which is partly the cause of so little tea and other goods reaching central Persian markets from the Persian Gulf, makes it urgent that His Majesty’s Government should direct His Majesty’s Consular Officers at the towns en route to secure the co-operation of the local authorities in bringing more owners of animal transport to work on this route. Meanwhile rates of steamer freight from India to the Gulf might be better adjusted to compete with rates to Batoum-a prominent Indian merchant of Persian origin in Calcutta has stated that the cheapness of freight to Batoum and dearness of freight to Bushire and Baghdad has much to do with the tea trade being diverted to Russia and the north of Persia. With the great interest which Lord Inchcape now has in the trade of the Gulf ports and Baghdad, he might possibly be willing to make experimental reductions of freights on tea, if placed in possession of the above facts and figures. 2. Reduction of duty on import of tea into /Vsi'a.—(Previous references Foreign Office to His Majesty’s Legation, Tehran, No. 8 (9620-10) of 29th April iqio. Bushire despatches to Legation, Nos. 64 and 89 of 15th September and 30th November 1912 ; to Government of India, Nos. 2216 and 3190 of same dates.) The reduction of duty (from the present 66 per cent ad valorem) would much improve the import of tea vid the Gulf to Central Persia, and thoug o equal incidence in Northern and Southern Persia its effect would certain y e much greater in Southern Persia, for not only, would it stimula e merchants in the Gffif region to larger imports, but by putting an end to the large smugging which now militates against bona fide trade in tea vid Persian ports, it would send the traffic back to its proper channels and give merchants confidence.

A written answer is being prepared in reply to my previous representations, but 1 did not gather that its sense would be favourable. He says that the action taken over the wheat and a reduction in the duty on tea are not on a par with one another. I hardly think that this matter can be pressed without a reference home as a modification of the Commercial Treaty of 1903 would be involved and we might lay ourselves open to a demand from Russia or some other country for a reduc tion of some import duty which might harm our trade to a greater extent than good would be done by a reduction in the duty on tea*</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100034963854.0x000001_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/448/2</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100034963854.0x000001</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/448/2</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 1032/1914 Pt 2 'Persian Gulf: TRADE with Gulf Ports'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1914/1919</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-03-30T18:55:13</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 item (152 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the part.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Part 2 concerns the shipping of goods between India and Southern Persian ports.
