The Muscat Government have recently been importing five horse power diesel and petrol water pumps through the agency of Nasir Abdul Latif of Dubai for installation on wells along the Batinah coast. The pumps are sold free of duty at Rs 2,200 and Rs 1,2^00 respectively to Arab owners of date and vegetable gardens. Twenty-seven such pumps have been imported so far and twenty-four disposed of. They are proving very popular and it is expected that before long the whole Batinah coast will be ple-ntifully supplied with these pumps, thus irrplementing one of the first suggestions of Mr, Hartley, the Aden Government’s Director of Agriculture, who toured the coast last year at the invitation of the Sultan. The Political Agent and Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co, Ltd’s local represen tative and agent for Rustom and Hornsby engines inspected one of these puj^ns on the 6 th November at Wudam, about sixty miles up the Batinah coast. It proved to be an English Better pump, and to have been installed some seven months ago, the first to arrive. It belongs to the Shaikh who is delighted with it, and considers it is definitely going to prove more econo mical than using bullocks. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co; hope that their 'Rustems' will compete favourably, and three have just arrived in Muscat. T RIBAL AFFAIRS . 166. Reference para; 150 of I.S, No, 10 of 1950.

He was an Uncle of the Sultan and elder brother of Saiyid Shihab, who is representing the Sultan during his stay in Dhofar, TRIBAL AFFAIRS, 136.. The general situation now appears to be that the Imam has not confirmed the nomination of any definite successor which he is believed to have made during his severe illness in 1948. Shaikh Suloiman bin Hamyar, the Ghafari leader, is*however#sponsoring the candidature of Yahya, eldest^son of the previous Imam, and one of the present Imam*s Walls, This is opposed by Shaikh Saleh bin Isa, the Hinawai leader, who wants the next Imam to be a HLnawi, He appears to have no actual nominee at present. In ohe meantime the Sultan wcofw^ both loaders with presents and hospitality to obtain their allegiance aiM to undermine the position of the Imam generally. He hopes that upon the death of the Imam, the tri^e^influenced by these leaders and persuaded that reform*development and financial benefit is only to be found through the Sultan, will discard the idea of an^Imamate altogether, and unite with the rest of the Sultan*. ate into one Kingdom with himself as head. Shaikh Suleiman bin Hapyar, who is ambitious and more progressive than most of the Shaikhs, has/ideas of securing recognition of himself as . an independent Shaikh, and has made certain overtures, without success, to the Brxidsh authorities, and, it is thought, may now be looking into the possibilities of achieving his purpose through American and Saudi contacts. The tribal situation,at present cxM'-enciy peaceful, is therefore likely to be very uncertain upon the death of the Imam, who is nor; over seventy, and liable to almost any development.SECRET No. 8, INTELLIG ENCE SUMMARr FOR THE BRITISH CONSULATE.
