I am desired to sey that the GoTenuaent of India agree in principle that arrange®ontsshould be made for the demarcation of the Kuwait*Iraq boundary aa soon as possible, while the political situation in Iraq is farourable. They accept generally the Tie»e expressed by fowls in his demi- oiiicial letter No.0/264, dated the 1st of August, except that with reference to paragraph 5 they are doubtful whether it will be necessary for the line to run as much as a mile south of dafwan. This is a point, however, on which the Shaikh of Kuwait can be consulted as Fowla suggests. 2. So for as expenditure is concerned the Government of inaia altar consulting .• rior, are doubtful whether the ^htiika oi Kuwait would be willing to pay for anything except the expenses of the personnel he himself supplies, ney Kreeume that if all the technical personnel are supplied from India, the Government of Iraq will meetkkaM half of their coat and also half of the coat of material used/mamlifted in the ftreotion of th* boundaxy pillare and that all expenditure which is not net by the Government of Ir&amp;q or the Shaikh of Kuwait will be shared half and half between His Majesty*s Government and the Government of India unless any other agreement has been reached regarding responsibilit) for expenditure generally at Kuwait in the meanwhile* 3 • The Government of India wish to know what expenditure is involved before they finally commit themselvee and are making enquiries to this end* A further communication on this subject will follow* 4* I am sending a copy of this letter to i rior and to the Baghdad embassy* Yours sincerely 3d/- W*R.HayConfidential Political Agency, 6 # \. * Kuwait, 'V&gt; ^ * D»0.

I have, therefore, estimated below the extra funds which the Political Agent will req.uire presuming that he visited the scene of operations on the frontier once a week. He could not regularly go more often as to reach the frontier, except that portion near the main Basra road, is a day # s journey. 2. The amounts are as follows*- A (a) Travelling allowance for the Political .Agent at an average of 250 i ailes a week for, say, about 2 months would amount to about 1,500 (b) Halting allowance for about 20 days. 200 (c) Tentage would be required but I have written to you separately on that subject - vide my letter No. C/427 of the 16th December, 1939.

Bines then the pro^reaa 3Hde with the plan for the creation of an Iraqi port at Urn user has raised questlone directly concerning tne intareats of His Majesty's Oovermsent and tha difficulty of deciding what interpretations it will be reioembered that the proposals contained A'- ^hen that despatch was written no important British /should The Kight honourable The Viscount iialifax 9 y /i a n. d * U* , U * O • i)&gt; • * * , 0* w • 1 • ?*■ • , etc.» etc., etc. etc.nhottld be given to the 4eecription oi the frontier ieid do%n by Sir Fere/ Cox in hme in coneo^oenee been inoreaeed. 4« Man/ aspeeta of the whole question of deiaaroation in relation to the Urn ^aar port »cher/«e were diaeueeed in a letter from the foreign Office to the AgaifX^ty last August « Ci,p/ of which was enclosed in Ue. dagg^llja/ 1 » letter to me ho. &amp; 64h9/: a/9ar Oi ioptember 19th, 1&amp;59. The two outatanking features appear to me to be* firstly* that a wide latitude la possible in the permissible Interpretation of the existing description of the frontier end, secondly* that the exact manner in which the frontier is finally defoarcated has acquired great importance in view of the urn £ jL&gt; M\- K V r wear port project and of the potential oil reacurcea of the whole area. As earlier correapond^nc© has anown it aeema possible to place tne frontier *lurt south of the latitude of Sal’wan” anywhere from a yard up tc a mile to the south ©f whatever point may be fixed as being the southern limit of bafwan *elia; a similar latitude is possible in deciding upon the turner In .Ich t : ;.e line is trxn centinued.and also in fixing the 'junction of the F.hcr ^ubair with the hhor \bdullah M which may be t&amp;iten ao the interaection of the deepest channel with the deepest channel of the hhor Bubiyan or ao the intersection of the respective smedian linee* or be fixed in seme other manner without reference to the comparatively small hher Bubiyan at all. £♦ Of course before ary t ;Ivan interpretation of the boundary line can be implemented by demarcation it oaiat be accepted by both novelt and Iraq but it seems clear that the /initiativev&gt; -3- initiative in brin^in^ about the cUiaa real Ion will have to be taken by iiiii Ooverncjunt and that the interpretation proposed by Hia Majesty• a Govarmr-ient when ta«.ini£ thia initiative in li&amp;aiy within certain limiia to have considerable im iuence over both Ira^ and 4c. wait. The affect which a final choice of a line could have on the U® *aer echerae la apparent fraa a study of the imp and of iiir John * ard 1 e report©, dir John favours n »ite for the port Juet below U® Creek and whether Uue cite la in 4o*eiti or iraii territory depend* on the esanner in which the description of the frontier ia interpreted. Moreover tiie ifflportant question of control of the approaches will also be influenced by tn© way Uri which the line is brought to, and continued fro®, the function of the ^hor ^.ubair with . her Abdullah. According to the chart which 1 enclose herewith I would however point out that the hher ^ubair is only that part of the Khor which extends inland fro® the creek to the weat known as Ura ^aar Creek, below that creek the name given on the enclosed chart is &amp;hor U® Qaar. ^orth of warba Xol&amp;nd the Khor Abdullah la alao described as the Khor ^ he tana. According to the above description on the enclosed chart the frontier point here would therefore be at the function of the Ahor w he tana with the khor U® ^aar. o. One interest which ilia M^iea ty f « Gov emergent ud^ht have in preventing the Iraqi Government from constructing a port at Ufa *Asr would be to ward off eventual encroseiuawnte on, or attempte to dominate, ho welt, but the tsalntenance of an obstructive attitude on such a ground would no doubt be resented in Iraq and might well have unfortunate political /rofiultoreftulta In the long run* another latere*t mi** be the protection of the British ospitel inveeteh in Beere, but thie egetn would hardly juatify «tr ng opposition to the developroent ©r an alternative port* Ctherwiee on general grounds* political, eotafsorcial and strategic it would see® to be deeiraole that tnia addxtieaal means of acoeaa to ir*&lt;i by sea should bo developed, and that tuererore the frontier should not be drawn in such a manner as to discourage Iraq from creating a port at all or ao aa to give rise to perujanent friction between Iraq and i.oweit* ‘''abject to these latter considerations British interests presumably coincide more closely *ita those of Koseit rather than of iraq, seeing that howsit is for all political purposes under British protection whereas Iraq is independent In the present circumstances of our relation with both countries, every concession made to Iraq at the cost of Koeeit is a loss to ourselves unless it directly entails a compensating gain to our own special interests in Iraq, f* In conclusion therefore 1 suggest that his Majesty 9 ! Qcvsrnmont should decide altheut further delay what are in fact the possible Variations of it*terpretat^.on which may reasonably be given to the accepted, description of the frontier. In particular is it possible, firstly, to assign Urn «*asr Creek, i.e* the creek seat of the tmin hhor at U» qasr either to Iraq or to keweit V Uecondly, la it possible to assign a part of the Jnct da &lt;«ssr (or Khor hubair) below Um v^asr Creek either to Iraq or to howeit ?

A 10 7J &gt; ___ With reference to India Office letter 1.^.375/40, of the 30th January, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to transmit to you herewith, for the information of the Marquess of Zetland, r ^ copy of a despatchf rom Hie llajesty^ Ambassador at Bagdad&gt;^p regarding 'the proposed demarcation of the iLoweit-Iraqi frontier* * ' ! Lord :alifax agrees with the view expressed by Sir Basil Newton that the wish of the Iraqi Government to develop a new pori on the Khor Abdullah has lent further importance to the question of the frontier line in the neighbourhood of that inlet. In the circumstances, it certainly seems desirable that the whole Koweit-Jraqi frontier should, if possible, be delimited at an ^ early date, and, in view of the decision of the Sheikh of Koweit that v he con contemplate no territorial cessions to Iraq, this can clearly only be done on the basis of the definition of the existing frontier made by Sir lercy Cox in his letter to the Political Agent, Kowelt. of the 19th July, 1923.\, v ;,^^| ^ ^ l' 3. It will be recalled that in his despatch No. 335 of the 1st July, 1939, (of which a copy was sent to the India Office with Foreign Office letter F 4936/66/91 of the 28th July, 1939) Sir Basil Newton enclosed the draft of e letter to the 4 Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, together with the draft of a Note which it was proposed the latter should address to him embodying an explanatory formula interpreting the definition of the frontier given by Sir ^rcy Cox. Since it iA as stated in the India. Office letter under reference that Lord Zetland agreed general ly with the proposals put forward by Sir Fasil Newton, Lord Halifax is reluctant to cause further delay by suggesting at this stage any amendments to the draft Notes in question. It seems to hiir, however, that certain alterations, both in the draft Notes and in the explanatory formula itself are desirsfelc. “.i • m the first place, in view of the importance which now attaches to the eastern part of the frontier, it seems preferable to advance in the draft Note to the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, as the reason for which Hie Majesty's Government desire that the frontier shall be demarcated (if any reason has to be advanced t 11), the need for avoiding disputes in connexion with the development of the new portToh the Khor Abdullah, rather than f , the embarrassment which has been caused by incursions of Iraqi r ;dlice into j oweiti territory. So far as Lord Halifax is aware, there have not in any case been any incidents of the kind for seme time past and since any reference to them might arouse the sueceptibilitiei of the Iraqi Government, this could, in his view, w ith advantage be omitted. , second place, it seems desirable to include both in the draft Note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and in the draft Lote f rom the i inister for Foreign Affairs to the Ambassador the actual wording of Sir Percy Cox's definition of the frontier. If this is done, not only will the two Notes be more readily intelli- gible in themselves, but it will also be self-evident why some elucidation of the existing deft nition is necesaarv before the work of demarcation can be started. \ C. Thirdly, Lord Halifax haf^noted from the late Str Trenchard Fowle's letter of the 1st August, 1939 to Mr. Peel (of which a copy was sent to the Foreign Office with India Office letter No.P.'Z.4978/3&lt;| The Under-Secret try of State, India Office. of/of the 19th August last) that there are in existence a post and board indicating the frontier on the track between K owe it and i;ubair south of Safwan. To* determine the frontier at this point by a reference to the most southerly palm in Safwan has always seemed to His Lordship a somewhat unsatisfactory expedient, and he is of the opinion that it would be definitely preferable to adopt instead a reference to the existing post and board, as being less likely to a rouse controversy either with the Iraqi Government or with the Sheikh. Since t^.s board is apparently less than one mile south of Safwan, His Lordship assumes that this suggestion will commend itself to Lord /.etlaiid. ') .. , u. | 7. The next fixed point on the frontier is that described by Sir iercy Cox as the junction of the Kfyat* Lubair with the Khor Abdullah. It will be recalled that in his despatch of the 1st July last, Sir Basil fcewton proposed that this should be defined as the junction of ■t* 16 thalweg of the Khor Zubair with the thalw eg of the north-westerly arm of the Khor Abdullah, known as the Khor Shetana. In the enclosed despatch Sir Basil Hewton points, out that below Urn ^aer the Khor Zubeir is described on certain Admiralty charts as. the Khor Um j,asr and he therefore suggests that it will be more accurate to substitute Khor Um Gasr for Khor Zubair in this formula. Lord Halifax has noted 1 that in the same charts the westerly part of the Khor Shetana is des cribed as the Khor Sakan. Logicallytherefore, it would be necessary to substitute the term 'Khor Sakan' for the 'Khor Shetana', if the , Khor Um Cesr ie substituted for the Khor Lubair. On the,whole, however, His Lordship doubts whether it ie necessary to adopt either ^ f of these names, since it seems to him that the meaning of the as incorporated in Sir Basil Newton’s despatch of the 1st July is already sufficiently clear. Moreover, in view of the existence of the Urn ' asr Creek, the use of the term 'Khor Um Casr' is likely to cause some confusion. 8. The most important point, however, to which I am to draw- attention arises in connexion with the frontier between the two fixed points mentioned above (the point just south of the latitude of Safwan and the junction of the Khor Zubair wfth the Khor Shetana) . The explanatory formula as drafted by Sir Basil Newton contains no explanation of this eection of the frontier, while the relevant extract from Sir lercy Cox’s definition reads as follows; V&gt;vi), ... thence eastwards passing south of Safwan wells, Jabal^^- Sakan and Um Qlasr, leaving them to Iraq, and so on to the ^ 'juhction of 'the Khor Zubair with the Khor Abdullah.' This d efinition, although it specifically leaves Um L.asr to Iraq, does not seem,to Lord Halifax to provide in itself an adequate basis for the demarcation of the frontier, since it is not even stated that the frontier shall follow the slur test line, between the two terminal point* No doubt the reason for the somewhat imprecise nature of this defini tion was that the time it wae regarded as sufficient to make it clear that Um tasr belonged to Iraq and that the frontier should reach the thalweg of the Khor Abdullah at the junction of the tthor Zubair with the Khor Shetana. Be that as it mtqr, some amplification now seeme necessary end Lord Halifax can only suggest that, in. order to avoid disputes, the frontier should be defined ns following as far es possible the shortest line between the post south of Safwan and the junction of the thalwege of the Khor Zubair and the Khor Shetana. It would not appear, however, thet this definition could be proposed without seme modification, since so ftr as can be ascertained from the available maps, the shortest line between these two terminal points would not only cut across.the Khor Zubair at its south-eastern extremity, but would even include part of the left bank of the Khor Zubair. It has never been suggested, nor could the Iraqi Government ,| be expected to qgree, that any part of the left bank of this inlet ,belongs to Koweit, while, as stated above, it is clearly the implica tion of Sir lercy Cox’s definition that the frontier of Koweit shallnot extend to the thalweg until the Junction of the Khor Zubeir with the Khor Shetana* 9. I era therefore to suggest that if the frontier ie defined ae being the shortest line between the two terminal points referred to above, it should be added that if this line ©hail be found, when followed on the ground, to strike the right bank of the Khor Zubair oefore it reaches the junction of the thalwcrs of the Khor Zubair and the Khor She tan a, it shei 1 be modified Tn 'such a manner as to follow from theft point the low water line on the right bank of the Khor Zubair, thus leaving the whole of the Khor Zubair to Iraq* It /79/seems clear that this was the least which ^Article 7 of the Anglo- Ottoman Convention of the 29th July, 1913 (vihich forms the origin of 5 8 Sir i ercy Cox’s definition) and the accompanying map were intended to give to Turkey. It is possible that the drafters of the Convention supposed that Turkey would soon secure thereby some territory on the right bank of the Xhor Zubair, , A 3 10.

However, I insisted and went out with Ali al Khalifah on the 9th June and erected a board on the old spot. A frontier official came to meet us from Safwan post, but was pleasant and made no objection. The day was appallingly hot and dusty and the official swore by both Huhanmad and Ali that he would not remove the board, and so save us the trouble of coming out again. He could not answer for the wind he said.* Unfortunately the lorry with the cement on it never arrived owing to burst tyres, but we are sending out later to cement the poles in the ground and hope thereby to defeat both the wind and the Iraqis. 2 His Highness displayed uneasiness at the thought Yours sincerely, The Hon*ble Lieut-Colonel C.G.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs present their compliments to His Britannic va.lesty's Fmhassy, Bagdad, and have the honour to state that at 2 o'clock, on the l?th of the current month. Major McOueen, a British official from Koweit, together with Shaikh Ali al Khalifa al Pahah, accompanied by an armed car carrying 17 armed persons, crossed the Iraqi frontier to a depth of 1000 metres from Safwan post and erected a pillar which Major Mccueen alleged would mark the separating boundary between the Kingdom of Iraq and Koweit. 2. it appears that the new pillar was erected instead of an old one which had stood there more than one year ago and disappeared recently. Jt should, however, be noted that the new pillar was erected at a point far from the site of the old one at a distance of 250 metres within the Iraqi frontier. 3. The Ministry would like to draw attention to the fact that the armed crossing of the Iraqi frontier by the Koweit authorities and the erection by them of arbitrary frontier pillars is regarded as an act of frontier violation. It is therefore requested that the esteemed Fmbassy will use their kind offices in this connexion by inviting the attention of the appropriate authorities to the matter with a view to punishing those responsible for this action and to preventing the recurrence of similar acts in future. 4. It should be noted that orders have been issued to the appropriate Iraqi authorities instructing them to remove the pillar from the place in which it was recently erected. The Ministry avail themselves of the opportunity to express their highest consideration and esteem. Hi s Britannic Majesty f 8 Fmibassy, BAGDADCONFIDENTIAL.

You will see that the Iraqis claim that we put the hoard up too close to Safwan post. The spot we selected was the one pointed out hy the Kuwaitis as the place, anl certainly it appeared to he for the ground there was soft and had been dug before. I tried to check tne position hy counting the telegraph poles, hut owing to the haze ana dust I found this difficult. Dickson is of the opinion that we should have been at the tenth pole from Safwan which would make the post not a mile from Safwan, and both he ana Scott are of the opinion that the distance was less than a mile. I was faced with difficulties on the ground and obviously did not want to go to Safwan to measure, and more obviously still I was not going to put the hoard farther away from Safwan than it was before. All things considered I believe we found the old place. 3. A report has been received tills morning that the Iraqis have reinoved the hoard again, and done their best to obliterate the mark. I think this is of no importance as the Iraqi Government have now admitted that their idea of the line of th© frontier at Safwan coincides with ours, and that is all that is required. 4. Should you wish me to go out again to fix the frontier at Safwan, I think it would he unwise to do so except in conjunction with the Iraqi Government, as saould this not be done an incident might occur ahich would he The Bon’hle Ileut-Colonel O.G.drior, CIS., Political Besident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. deplorable./U deplorable.

My dear Galloway, i am not very happy about the facte disclosed in your demi-official letter ITo.C/323, dated the 9th July 1940, regarding the signboard on the Kuv/ait-Iraq frontier. In the first place it was obvious that the board was to be erected on the exact spot which it had formerly occupied, and before asking you to replace it i told you that Dickson could show where it had been and asked you to confirm it. lou did not A do this but told me in reply that the Shaikh knew where it was. Prom your demi-official letter ho.C/293 of 20th June 1940, you apparently took neither of them with you, though Dickson has ample leisure, and left the cementing to some one else to do. it now appears that you cannot say for certain that you did replace the beard on the exact spot, or even that you carried out Dickson’s instructions, and to make matters worse you informed the BrA-i-ok Embassy of your doubts. §urely you realised that the fixing or re-fixing of a frontier boundary mark is a matter for the most meticulous accuracy ? 2. Secondly you tell me that you think it would be unwise for me to ask you to go out again ’’to fix the frontier” at Safwan exeex-t in conjunction with the Iraqi Government. ¥ ou are, of course, correct in, giving me your viev/s but you are BRl correct in repeating them to the Bagdad Embassy as this has the effect of committing me in advance on a matter of policy where i may think differently. Y ours^s4iicerely. Major A.C.Galloway, I .A., • ' Political Agent, Kuwait.PerBonftl confidenti al, J: The Agency» Kuwait, 20 th July t 1040. (Zcj \ With reference to your •pereonal* letter of the 16th July, I *u# eorry that you are not happy in this matter, but hope that the following will dispel this. #hen it comes to the point it appears that there is no one here who can d finitely point to the exact spot on the ground where the board originally was. Both sides are out in their calcula tions. 2. You ask why I did not go with either the Shaikh or Dickson. The Shaikh did not wish to cone although X asked him and sent All al Khalifah with me. This man is the beet desert authority here and knows the country as well as the. Shaikh. He assured me that lie knew the spot. As regards Dickson, I knew the spot according to him was between the 10th and 11th telegraph pole from Safwan. With this know- ledgs and the Shaikh*s rsprssentatiye i considered that I had enough to go on. When I got on to the ground the Arabs did not at once find the spot but quite soua they did find a place which had been previously dug and this they affirmed to be the pl^oe. I did my best to check by the poles but X discovered that Dickson’s spot (between 10th and 11th poles) did not bring me to a mile away from Safwan. I did not then know as I know now that there are between 17 and 18 poles to the mile. But as far as I could tell I was at about the 10th pole and as this coincided with the spot found by the Arabs I was forced to the conclusion that it was the right spot. The figures given by the Iraqis are not correct. i r+ -4 A j K rl* K The Hon’ble Lieut-Colonel C.G.Prior, C.I.S*, The Residency, Bashirs.Th«y Bay that the board was 1100 yards from Safwan and that I entered Iraq to a depth of 275 yards. This may be so but if It is it brings me to about the plaoe found by the Arabs whioh also agrees (though tnsre is about 100 yards dlfferenos) with Dickson's ieeoription, I did not go out to do the cenenting because All al Khalifah said that he vould arrange that without any trouble and I trusted him in this matter. 4. I am sorry that I sent a oopy of my D.O. to the Kmbasey but my object was only to let them know that I had informed you that I was not so much in the wrong as the Iraqis claimed. I knew full wall that you would rsply officially latsr. LcTelegram Trom To Hepeated to Dated the 3rd and received the 4th August, 1940. - Inter. - M.M’s Ambassador, Baghdad.

Government suggest that there should be an exchange of notes providing that the work of demarcating the frontier and erecting pillars should be carried out in a manner similar to that laid down in the notes exchanged for the same purpose between the Iraqi and Saudi ^ ' - Arabian Governments in February 1936. l n order, however, to avoid difficulties which might otherwise arise. His Majesty’s Government think it desirable that the proposed notes should include agreement on the interpretation of certain points in the wording of the definition 2 With this end in view. His Majesty’s- 2 - of the frontier as re-affirmed hy the prime Minister in his letter to the High Commissioner /f v ® No. 2944 of July 21st, 1932. 3. In that letter the definition of the frontiers was re-affirmed in the following terras ’’From the intersection of the T *Tadi al Audja with the Batin and thence northwards along the Batin to a point just south of the latitude of Safwan; thence eastwards passing south of Safwan wells, Je'bel sanam and Um Qasr leaving them to Iraq, and so on to the junction of the Khor zoheir with the Khor Abdullah. The islands of Warba, Bubian, Maskan (or Mashjan) pailakah, Auhah, Kubhar Qaru and Um el Maradin appertain to Koweit.' 4. The points to be interpreted and the interpretation which it is suggested should be given to them are as follows :- t (1) 'Along the Batin’’ the frontier line shall follow the thalweg , i.e. the line of the deepest depression. (2) The 'point just South of the latitude of Safwan' shall be the point on the thalweg of the Batin due west of the point a little to the South of Safwan at which the post and notice-of —o*' notice-board marking the frontier stood until May 1959. (3) prom the Batin to the neighbourhood of S a fwan the frontier shall be a line along the parallel of latitude on which stands the abovementioned point at which the post and notice-board formerly stood. (4) The 'junction of the Khor zubair with the Khor Abdullah' shall mean the junction of the thalweg of the Khor Zubair with the thalweg of the north-westerly arm of the Khor Abdullah known as the Khor Shetana. (5) prom the neighbourhood of Safwan to the junction of the Khor zubair with the Khor * e • Abdullah the frontier shall be the shortest line between the point defined in sub- paragraph (2) and the point defined in sub- paragraph (4). But if this line shall be found, when followed on the ground to strike the right bank of the Khor zubair before it reaches the point defined in sub-paragraph (4), it shall be modified in such a manner as to follow the low water line on the right bank of the Khor Zubair until a point on the bank immediately opposite the point defined in sub-paragraph (4) is reached, thus leaving the whole of the Khor zubair to Iraqi* (6) prom the point defined in sub-paragraph (4) to the open sea the boundary shall follow the thalweg of the Khor Abdullah. 5. In the hope that your Excellency will agree in principle with my Government’s viewof the advantage to 'both the Iraqi and Koweiti Governments of a demarcation of their common frontier, J am enclosing, as a basis for discussion, a draft of a Note which I suggest Your Excellency should, on behalf of the I^aqi Government, address to me.

I have now received instructions from the Foreign Office to make a formal proposal to the Iraqi Government for the joint demarcation of the frontier.

A signboard which marked the Kuwait-Iraq boundary was placed in position by the Kuv/aiti authorities about the year 1923. it remained there until June 5th, 1932, when it was removed by Iraqi police from bafv/an, who, however, replaced it after it had been pointed out that the board had been put up by and was the property of the Kuv/aiti Govern ment • 3. In March 1939 the board was again removed by unknown persons and on the occasion referred to in the Ministry’s note Kuwaiti officials (accompanied by the British Political Agent) acting on official orders put up a new board on the site of the one that had been taken away• 4. The Kuwaiti authorities are satisfied that great care was taken to put up the new board on the original site and in the absence of confirmatory evidence regret that they are not able to accept the allegation contained in the note under reference that the new board was re-erected at a point 250 metres within Iraqi territory. His Majesty’s Embassy avails itself of this opportunity to renew the expression of its highest consideration British Embassy, Bagdad. 3rd August, 194 0.CONFIDENTIAL (360/25/40) Kuwcii i eceipt Dated &amp; 50th August,1940 My dear Ba&amp;gallay oo OJ - xc *Jr&gt; ^ | I enclose herein a copy of a letter from A' \ A Edmonds commenting on the enclosure to ycur letter of May 5th to the India Office (No.E 1758/309/91) about the interpretation to be given to the definition of the Koweit-Iraq frontier laid down by Sir Percy Oox. It may be a pity that he did not reply sooner but it is not surprising as he in common with all of us has had much too much to do during the summer which has been exceptionally hot. i have not studied at all closely the points which he now raises, and I do not propose to « &gt; delay action on your telegram No. 356 of July 31st ' foi' the technical examination v^hich may be required. The points of interpretation which will be put forward to the Iraqi Government will be only a basis for discussion and the Iraqi Government will have ample opportunity to make counter proposals if they wish to do so. In the meanwhile you may care to pass Edmonds 1 letter to the experts so that they may be ready with their views if the Iraqis take up his points. &gt; after his palm tree but I agree with the Political Resident who strongly deprecates any x-eversion to this method of defining an important point, and is confident that it will be easy to ascertain the position of the notice board which was improperly removed by the Iraqis in March last year for the second time. It was replaced the xirst time and obviously can be again. ,/he re as wnat is a palm of Safvvan, and how is it to be distinguished from a palm of Eubair or a palm of Fao? The whole of Southern Iraq is dotted with palms. I should say therefore that it would be much easier to obliterate any given palm than the position of a unique notice beard which was in situ for sixteen years until it was forcibly removed for the second time. 6 - * am sending copies of this letter and its enclosure to Bushire and howoit. Yours ever ) Basil A ttvion. H.X.BAOOALLAY BSQ. 4/ifcu^istry of the interior, Iraq. Bagdad, August 20th 1940. P.S-149. lly dear Holt, Please excuse my delay in answering your letter 060/6/40 of 5th June, which we put aside during a rush of urgent work and was then overlooked. 1 have discussed the matter with you verbally, but I may as well put down my remarks to complete the file. 1. Agreed. 2. As the notice board has been removed for some years now we should have to say M Gafwan at which a post and notice board formerly marked the frontier'. But the exact point is likely to be disputed after so long; indeed the Iraqi reports on the Political Agent’s recent attempt to re-establish it unilaterally state that he rfLaced it well to the north of the original position. A definite distance from a specific palm would therefore have been simpler, but perhaps both parties will be able to find some reputable map&amp;hose oath they will accept and so settle the matter. 3. Agreed with corresponding amendment to (2) i.e. ”for merly stood' for 'have been erected'. 4. See my letter P-S. 246 of 2nd December, 1937. I think we should either say 'the trijunction of the thalweg of the Khors Zubair, Shetana and Sabiya as shown on the 1:500,000 map of 1936' or add the co-ordinates as read off that map, or better still both. 5. With the maps at our disposal we cannot be quite suie that the straight line would not cut off the tip of the north bank where it separates the two Khors or even leave Um Qasr in Iraq, which by tlr terms of the original agreement it must; also low-water boundaries must be unsatisfactory. It would be hardly human for the owner of the bank to respect the ownership of the adjacent water. The 'clarification' I would suggest here would be as follows: 'From the point south of Safwan defined in para 3 the frontier ^ shall run in a straight line to (the point on the high-water line * due west of) the junction defined in para 4, provided that if such a line were to cut either bank of the Khors more than once or were not to leave Um Qasr in Iraq, the line shall be modified by agreement between the two parties in such a way as to prevent eithe r c ontingency'. If the words in brackets are accepted neither of the contingencies seems likely but it might be wise to leave them in nevertheless. This proposal is intended only to give a good line. It is perhaps unfortunate that it would give a few extra square yards to Ifcaq as against the line straight to the junction, and so is likely to stampede the Kuwait authorities who seem inclined to haggle over inches; but it would be childish to insert provision for compensation elsewhere by an equivalent area of equally useless mud and sand.

He replied that as the boundary responsibility was the Government’s he did not see the need for a Kuwaiti representative. He tholight that the representative from Kuwait would, of course, be the Political Agent. I said that I had no instructions on that point, but that His Majesty’s Government thought it necessary for him to depute a representative and asked him to let me know whom he would select. In those circumstances he agreed and promised to give me the name. 3. I then informed him of the proposal regarding payment as contemplated in the first half of paragraph 10 of Sir Trenchard Fowle’s letter No. C/284 of the 1st August, 1939. He said that s. 6.

He agreed, however, to pay half the cost of the boundary marks and the expenses of his own representative. I did not lead him to understand that this would be agreeable to His Majesty’s Government and so did not go into the question of transport nor into details of the cost of erection. 4* I suggest that we might agree to the division as proposed by him on the understaniing that he provides camel transport and lends tentage. ■ As he has agreed to pay half the cost of the posts, His Majesty’s Government might well bear half the cost of erection as the labour- party is a necessary adjunct to the Committee and is not part of the fixtures which, I think, the Shaikh wishes to consider as half his.7 GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, Department, EXPRESS LETTER [2V, B % -—This is an ORIGINAL MESSAGE, sent by post to save telegraphic expense and undue use of the wires, but intended to be treated, on receipt, with the same expedition as if it had been telegraphed.

This is a peculiar selection, and is probably due to the fact that the Shaikh wishes to remain in the background so that His Majesty's Government, and not the Subah, may bear any odium should there be any. Nazzal himself knows the terrain probably better than anyone, and is a man known and respected by Bin Saul and the desert people.

With regard to paragraph 3 of your telegram No. T/466 of the 3rd October 1940. It is my opinion that the chief representative on our Commission should be the political Agent but whether it is he or another officer neither should be subordinated to any Kuwaiti. My reasons are (a) we are responsible and to transfer that responsibility to a Kuwaiti would be ’wrong (b) our prestige would suffer, (c) no Kuwaiti representative would be able fully to understand tile technical points which are likely to arise and (d) as any doubtful points are to be referred to Government it is essential that an officer should do this, otherwise the situation may arise when the British representative is unable to put the case in dispute to Government, or at the best only in a garbled manner.

The Iraqi Government have probably taken a leaf out of tne Iranian book and hope by delaying demarcation to be able to jump a claim or two (in the style of their recent removal or* the frontier post at Safwan), and perhaps even to acquire the islands of Warbah and Bubian. Before I received the Iraqi reply Mr. Ldmonds had already made it known to me that the Ministry of Defence, when asked for their views on His Majesty’s Government's proposals, had deprecated the demarcation of the frontier until what yd they called 'the question of the cession to Iraq of the Islands of Warbah and Bubian” had been settled. 3* Your Lordship will recall that the Iraqis at one time had the idea that these two islands might be given to them for nothing in order that ihey should have complete control cjer the approaches to the projected Port at Urn Qasr. 4. Nevertheless I myself feel some doubt whether the present is really a convenient time for this frontier to be ‘ - demarcated. If, however, the demarcation is to be postponed, we should perhaps insist on satisfaction regarding the boundary post at Safwan; either by having it replaced or at least by having its exac 1 position placed on indisputable record. 3* Apart from this consideration, now that, in the absence 3. of British help, the Iraqi Government have apparently shelved for the time being the Im Qasr port scheme, I am not sure that delay is necessarily to our ultimate disadvantage, or likely to prejudice the attainment of such local objectives as we may have at an eventual Peace settlement. I hope that the importance of Koweit will grow in the near future, seeing that it may eventually prove to be a key point not only on the route to Bagdad and beyond but also on any air or lan' route which may be developed between Transjordan aid the Persian Gulf. Koweit, moreover, seems to be rich in oil, that the Iraqi Government should b- pressed to agree to demarcation now I can return to the charge. 7* • I think however that in the circumstances explained above the need for avoiding disputes in connection with the development of the new Port on the Khor Abdullah would not be a persuasive argument and that it would probably be better to take the line that in the general interests of good neighbourly relations it is desirable to demarcate a frontier that has remained unmarked on the ground for so long. I could refer to the recent affair of the boundary post at Safwan (my despatch No.^ 36 3 of the 3rd August) as an illustration of the misunderstandings that arise between neighbours when frontiers 2 .

Meanwhile there is a deep water anchorage at Khadhma about ten miles west of the town of Koweit. An obstacle to tiie a evelopment of a terminal base in Koweit for the land transport of troops may be the lack of water. At other points on the route and also elsewhere on the Arabian side of the Gulf, e.g. at Bahrain, the water problem seems to present no insoluble difficulties, it is to be hoped that by modern methods is could also be solved at Koweit. Water could oi course be pumped from Basra or some nearer point on tile Shatt-al-Arab but this solution would be open to the objection of involving dependence on Iraq.Telegram a from Government of India., .New Delhi.

It seems likely therefore that the exact position of the boundary will not be complicated by the discovery of oil, though this cannot be assumed for all time.

The exact alignment of the Kuwait-Iraq Frontier in this area is a question of considerable complexity, and came up during the war in connexion with the construction of a port at Umra-Qasr by the British Military authorities.

The latter definition was also accepted both by the Shaikh of Kuwait and the Iraqi Government in 1932.

Now that Umm Qasr has been abandoned as a port it no longer provides in itself a reason in favour of the early demarcation of the frontier. As Sir Geoffrey Prior suggests however, the discovery of oil in the area may before long bring the question up in a more acute form, and is not likely to make it any easier to reach agreement with the Iraqis.

Prom To No.C/444 Dated the 16th June, 1947. CONFIDENTIAL. © P 1 :. ‘/T v Reference your telegram No.667 dated the 9th June, 1947. Kuwait - Iraq Frontier. 2. In 1939 the then Political Resident was of the opinion that a demarcation of the frontier would render less likely Iraqi incursions into Kuwait for which His Majesty’s Crovernment had been able to obtain no satisfaction^vide - Residency telegram No.80 dated the 29th January, 1939 and /H' Residency express letter No.C/94 dated the 22nd February, 1939. Since then the incursions have continued and we have been no more successful in obtaining satisfaction for the Shaikh: and this in spite of the fact that there have been British advisers attached to the Iraq police who have done their utmost to prevent such incidents, and in spite of the presence in Iraq since 1941 of British forces and a pro- British Gtovernment. In my view nothing has occurred since 1939 to make a demarcation of the frontier any less desirable, 3. Should there be in the future, as a result of the revision of the present treaty with Iraq or for any other reason, no British advisers, or advisers of some other nationality, in Iraq, I anticipate that the situation would become much graver. I understood from Colonel Sargon of the Iraq Police on his visit here two years ago that, as his police were incapable of reading or understanding a map, there was little prospect of their respecting the frontier until it was demarcated. 4. Both the Iraq Petroleum Company and the Kuwait Oil Company are fully occupied in developing promising oil fields at some distance from the frontier, but it is probable that when proved fields are fully in production intensive exploration at new levels will be begun and the companies may then take an active interest in the frontier area. Demarcation would seem likely to proceed more smoothly now when the area is not considered vitally important from an oil point of view than at some later date when this position may have changed. 5. The Umm Qjasr Port project appears to be dormant for the present and therefore unlikely to complicate or embitter the demarcation operations. 6. The frontier where it follows the Batin Is marked by an unmistakeable natural feature and it would seem that demarcation here is not urgently required, provided that Iraq agrees that it follows the thalweg and instructs her officials accordingly. Similarly the frontier once it reaches the Khor Abdullah does not seem to require demarca tion. The section where incidents have occurred in the past and are most likely to recur in the future is the comparat ively short one between the Batin and the Khor Abdullah, the demarcation of which would not, I suggest, present any ' considerable physical difficulties, or involve much expense. 7. It is clear that the accurate definition of the frontier will present questions on which Iraq and Kuwaita Kuwait are unlikely to agree - notably the problem of ar south of Safwan 'just South' is. This question, ver, seems to have been considerably narrowed by the admissions contained in the Iraqi note off the 25th June,1940 forwarded to you with Baghdad Embassy despatch No.360/10/40 dated the 27th June, 1940 and the other questions are unlikely to be more acute now than they were in 1939. 10^7 8. The Shaikh’s attitude will probably be just as it was described in Colonel Dickson’s letter No.80 dated the 7th June, 1932 and it is probable that he will endeavour to take a minor part in the demarcation and to take shelter behind His Majesty’s Government from the slings and arrows of the Iraqi Nationalist Press. 9. Iraqi objections to demarcation# in the past appear to have arisen from the hope that they might at some future date annex part or all of Kuwait should British influence in the Middle East and British support for the Shaikh of Kuwait decrease as a result of developments elsewhere. It appears that Iraq may demand revision of her treaty with Great Britain with the object of decreasing her influence in Iraq, and, should this happen, I regard it as of prime importance that we should make our consent to such revision conditional upon a staisfactory demarcation of the Kuwait - Iraq frontier. 10. The only objection that I can see to demarcation ' is that it might arouse or accentuate ill-feeling between the parties. In my opinion this objection should not be allowed to prevail unless His Majesty’s Government are certain that British influence in Iraq and the friendliest relations between Iraq and Kuwait.and Iraq and His Majesty’s Government will remain indefinitely.INDIV Telegram \ To From India Office, London.

X enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter Ho*5753/993/91 of the ?th August which we have new received from the Foreign Office on this subject. You will see that the Foreign Office hold strongly to the view that if it is hoped to reach agreement without recourse to arbitration it is useless to approach the Iraq Gcvexment on this question on the basis of a ftermLa less favourable than that put to them in 1940* This 1940 formula however would seem to raoan that the Sheikh of Kweit would lose the site of the Port of Uom h&amp;ar$ and it seems clear from the political Resident’s telegram dated 3rd August, 1941, the Sheikh would regard such an outcome with great concern* ^oreever, in view of the additional evidence on the interpretation of the frontier which had been adduced since 1940 , it is difficult to agree to basing any further efforts at a settlement on the 1940 fornuln* It seems very doubtful whether, in the opinion of the shaikh,^ the advantages to K.oweit of an early demarcation of the frontier in securing a cessation of frontier infringements and a division of oil rights would outweigh the loss of Ucm -asr* It would seem, therefore, that it is becoming increasingly clear that there is little chance of securing an agreed frontier without arbitration, arbitration would have the disadvantage that it might be attended by a certain amount of publicity of /an Lieut.Col* A* 0 *Galloway, C*I* -*, 0*B*3., The Residency, Bahrain* Kan undesirable kind, but it would enable us to put forward the further evidence in the Shaikh’s favour which has emerged since 1940.

The most satisfactory method might be for H*I , representing tlie Shajadl’a interests, and the Government of Iraq to a^ree on a neutral arbitrator whose award would (in the case of# Iraq subject presumably to ratification by the Majlis) be given international acceptance by registration with U.II.O, + Yours sincerely, «■ ' ’• ' - * t ' f' F.

Following is Political Agent’s report on Shaikh's reaction begins; Shaikh reacted well; said he would welcome tmrely British port at Um Qasr but desired me to tell you with all emphasis he could command that there must be no handing over of port to Iraq after the war as that would place Kuwait in mortal danger. He would prefer its utter destruction rather than that happened. Nor would it be enough to dismantle port if purely in Iraq territory as Iraq could easily replace group mut . ies etc and carry on campaign of diverging Kuwait's trade to Um Qasr. If port is located in Iraq and His Majesty's Government is unwilling to retain permanent control then either it must be dis mantled under British guarantee that Iraq will not rebuild^ or if port Is half in Kuwait and half in Iraq a joint Kuwait Iraq harbour committee might possibly be set up under direct British control though this solution may not please Iraq. Kuwait in any case to retain control of her water rights and not to be asked to transfer territory. Regarding Kuwait itself Shaikh said he mut. military authorities developing port facilities and improv ing road to Basrah but hopes that former will mainly be in direction of Shuyaikh. Ends.

I have heard fro* Tandy that he agrees with Galloway's views. ^ 3. 'My own view is that we should not at present lightly surrender any territory in the vicinity of Umm Qasr even though only a few square miles of desert are concerned. If any port is constructed at Umm Qasr - I have no information whether the Iraqi Government are still keen on this project - it will certainly assist matters if Kuwait has some say in the proceedings as will have to be the case if it is necessary for some of the pert build ings to be constructed in her territory. Further the oil potent ialities of this region are not known and this is an additional reason for not surrendering any territory though I should not attach very great Importance to it if there were no prospect of Umm Qasr's ever being developed as a port. 4. I do not know whether it is in my province to express any opinion about tactics in this case but I would suggest that arbitration should only be resorted to if no other course appears possible. I presume that in any case the Iraqi Government will be asked in the first place whether they are willing to take up the question of demarcation now, and that before even this is done the Shaikh of Kuwait will be consulted. I would suggest that if the Iraqi Government reply in the affirmative we should present them with a reasonably-large scale map showing them the line we claim on behalf of Kuwait under the definition of the frontier as re affirmed by the Prime Minister for Iraq in his letter No.2944, dated the 21st July 1932, to the High Commissioner for Iraq vide Annexure No.VIII to Wakefield's note a copy of which was forwarded with my letter No.181-3 of 20th December, 1941. Whether this definition should be interpreted as proposed by Wakefield in his note or by me in my letter No.C-78 dated the 10th March, 1942, or in some other manner will first have to be decided. If the Iraqi G Government then propose the 1940 or some other line we can presumable argue with them and should I think in any case consult the Shaikh of Kuwait before proposing arbitration.

V,e notice that Colonel Johnson has Umai ^asr in mind as a possible site for the new port installation. You will remember thot although the authoritative definition of the Xraqi-Kuwait frontier of 1932 speaks of u Safwan ^ells and Irani ^asra, leaving them to Iraq”, the frontier ras not in fact been demarcated, and the ground interpretation of 'Ucm ^asr 11 has been a subject of dispute. Part of the military port of turn x asr which was constructed during the last war was probably in Kuwaiti territory, and that port threatened embarrass ment both in its construction and its dismantling - (see Hogg*s letter to Knight fto.593/9/45 oi 26th December 1945). .Ve presume Colonel Johnson is aware of this back ground and of the consequent difficulties in the way of constructing any Installation at Uaa H asr. Mr. relhaia has already mentioned these difficulties to him during a ccx versation in Basra on 18th January. ^ We hope therefore that Colonel Johnson will not give his blessing to a project which might precipitate frontier dispute which we are of course particularly anxious to avoid.

I have had occasion recently to discuss with the Shaikh the question of maintaining security in the northern part of his territory, and he is now patrolling the area with 4 armed cars and is taking exceedingly effective steps to stop smuggling to Iraq. In fact my information is that this traffic has been brought to a complete standstill. 3. This is satisfactory; but the Shaikh is nervous that his armed cars, although they do not go north of the Raudhatain, which is indubitably some miles within' Kuwait territory, will meet Iraqi police cars which are said to enter Kuwait for illicit purposes with out the knowledge of the senior police officers. Should a meeting take place he is afraid that the Iraqis would open fire and the Kuwaities have to reply. well 4. The Shaikh is perfectly/aware of the desirability of avoiding any such incident but, while emphasising this, I have told him that I cannot advise him to relinquish control of what is undoubtedly part of his territory for fear of a clash with marauding Iraqis. I feel, that, since this patrolling is on a larger scale than that practiced previously, it might be as well to inform the Iraqi Government that it is being carried out and to ask them to ensure that their police co-operate, as it is in their interests of Iraq* that smuggling should cease, it would be desirable for the Iraqis to agree to Kuwait cars going right up to Safwan for purposes of liaison with their own police. 5.

He pointed out that if Kuvaiti patr^s were allowed to enter Iraq for liaison purposes Iraqi patrols would probably demand similar rights in Kuwait territory. He said that in his opinion the present system was working satisfactorily, but if His Majesty’s Government wished to proceed with the suggestion, he would prefer us or the Iraqi Government to produce the concrete 3ll 8g e 3tions and he would comment on them. 3.

Vvren, which I have received through the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, giving a summary of a discussion which he held recently with the Director of Ports and Navigation, Basra, on the subject of the development of the port of Umm Qasr. No copy of the notes referred to in paragraph 8 of the report was forv/arded to me. 2. When I visited Baghdad on the 9th November, I was informed by Trevelyan that the Iraq Governments note on this subject had not yet arrived but was shortly expected. Before the port can be developed, it will be necessary to arrive at some arrangement with the Shaikh of Kuwait regarding the use of his territory and territorial waters, and in discussing the matter we came to the conclusion that this could only be done after the frontier between Iraq and Kuwait has been demarcated. 3. I also discussed the case with the Director General, Ports and Navigation, Basra, during his visit to Bahrain. He informed that it has now been decided that the piping for the projected Abadan-Mediterranean pipe line should be unloaded at Basra for storing at Shaibah so that the development of the new port is not quite so urgent a matter as it was. He also said that in his opinion it would be necessary for vessels visiting Umm Qasr to use the channel between Warba and Bubiyan, which is entirely within Kuwait territorial waters, and not the Khor Shetana where the boundary between Kuwait and Iraq follows the thalweg. He further stated that in the very near future he wishes to errect tide gauges in the approaches to Umm Qasr and that some of these will inevitably be located in Kuwait territorial waters, and w r e shall no doubt shortly receive an official request to approach the Shaikh on this subject. 4. In correspondence which took place between you and the Foreign Office while you were acting as political Resident, it was decided that after taking over at Kuwait you should seek the consent of the Shaikh to a further approach to the Iraq Government regarding the demarcation of the Kuwait-Iraq frontier on the basis of the 1940 formula. I should be grateful if you would kindly do this at an early date and inform me of the result. Lt. Col. A.C.

The Staff Officer (Intelligence) Levant and Eastern Submitted a The following brief summary of a conference on the develop ment of the port of Umm Qasr held with the Director of Ports and Navigation, Basrah, on Monday 18th October, 1948, is forwarded as requested by the Senior British Naval Officer, Middle East. 5 2. Background . The capacity of the Shatt-al-Arab river is estimated at about 170 ships a month, but this figure could be raised temporarily to 200. At the present, Abadan accounts for 146 and Basra 24 ships a month. 3• Recent Developments . Oil has been found in quantity at A1 Zubair some 15 miles from Basra. The requirement has therefore arisen of getting this oil away. Owing to the remarks in paragraph 2 above, it is not possible for Basra or any other port in the Shatt-al-Arab river to be used as the tanker loading point for Zubair. A satisfactory alternative has suggested itself in UMM OaSR, some two-thirds of the way up Khor Abdullah (Chart 1265). 4. Umm ^asr . This port was started ifcn 1941. Surveys were carried out by the Port Directorate, Basra, the channel was buoyed, and by the end of the second Yforld War, a jetty had been built. The jetty is now derelict, and all the navigational aids are either missing or destroyed. Therefore it is necessary to carry out another survey of Khor Abdullah, and an aerial survey of the terrain between Umm Qasr and Basra. 5. Territorial Boundaries . The frontier between Iraq and the Sheikhdom of Kuwait lies along a line up the middle of Khor Abdullah, and Khor Shetana and then goes inland from a position 1 mile south of the site of the present jetty. The disadvantages are that it will not be possible to expand the port Umm Qasr in its present site due to the close proximity Mediterranean Date: 19th October, 1948 NO. 2686/36 of theof the boundary line. Also, innumerable difficulties are envisaged with the Shaikh of Kuwait, regarding port and harbour dues, anchoring in Kuwait territorial waters, etc. The question of boundaries is already being dealt with by the Foreign Office. 6. Future Developments . The first problem affecting the port of Basra is that of unloading the large number of 30 feet lengths of 36' piping, this being for the already projected Abadan-Mediterranean pipe line. Fairly extensive alterations have to be made to the Margil docks at the up river end to enable them to handle the extra 1,000 tons a day of shipping which this project will entail. Later it will also be necessary to unload all the materials for building up the new oil field at Basra and for laying a smaller pipe line to take the oil away (in years to come) to Umm Qasr, and also the materils for the development of that port. 7. Approval has yet to be given by the Iraq Government for the development of Umm Qasr, and it is anticipated that it will be atleast 3 years before the port will be in full operatipns. 8. The attached notes are now somewhat out of date, having been compiled in 1941, when Khor Abdullah was originally surveyed'. They should therefore be read with caution. Large scale charts of the 1941 survey are available from the Port Directorate, Basra, but it is not considered that they would be of use until something definite has been decided.

(B 11151/700/91) 8 th September, 1948* COHMPSHTIAL Would^ou please refer to your letter Ho. 135 (53/54) of 16th August about the Kuwait-Iraq frontier. After consultation with Hay we had thought that it might be adrisable to find out from the Sheikh of Kuwait how he himself regarded the frontier line as running on the basis of the 1940 formula, at the time he accepted it, in case the Sheikh should subsequently claim that the frontier, as demarcated according to this definition, gawe Iraq territory which in his Tiew should properly be part of hie Sheikhdom. This in its turn would raise the question of our good faithfln giving the Sheikh an assurance that the 1940 definition was only 'a clarification of the existing frontier w . As a result of your letter we have re-examined the whole question taking into account Hay's letter No. 119 of the 20th July. We are Impressed with your arguments against asking the Sheikh how he thinks the line runs and our conclusion is that it would be best te proceed as you suggest and simply to seek the consent of the Sheikh to a further approach to the Iraqi Government on the basis of the 1940 formula. But in order that he may know exactly what is proposed we should like you to show him on a large scale map just how this frontier will run. If he does not demur, then we can proeaed to approach the Iraqis. If he does we can consider whatever he has to say. Will you now approach him and let us know what transpires? If any resulting negotiations with Iraq come to nothing, if there is then resort to arbitration and in the course of arbitration reference is made to the 1913 agreement, our line with the Sheikh must be that legally the 1913 agreement cannot be taken into account in interpreting the 1923 and 1932 te/ts and that we do not consider the 1940 formula to involve in any way 'surrender' by him. In negotiating with Iraq His Majesty's Government cannot, as we have said before, put forward any line other than the 1940 line. It is not therefore practicable to argue that the junction of the Khor Zubalr with the Khor Abdullah is immediately south of Unm Qasr as suggested by Hay. In any case we do not regard this point as a valid one* Hay's view as set out at the end of paragraph 5 of his despatch No. C/7&amp; of the 10th March, 1942 is that Sir Percy Cox must have regarded the Khor-att-Tha'alab as part of the Khor-Zubair and that he did not Intend hia line to end at the tri-junction of the Khor-att-Tha'alab, Khor-as- Sablyeh and Khor Abdullah but at 'the right bank of the southern extremity of the Khor-att-Tha'alab'. But what the/ Lieutenant-Colonel A.C. Galloway,C. I. E., 0. B.E. Bahrein. fth# 1923 definition is that the line shall pass eastwards passing south of Safwan Wells, Jabal Sanaa and Um Qasr leaving them to Iraq and so on to the Junction of the Khor Zubair with the Khor Abdullah* We must therefore suppose either that the Khor Zubair comes down to the junction of Khor Abdullah with the Khor*ae*Sabl/eh or that the Khor Abdullah reaches up to the junction of the Khor Zubair with the Khor Um Qasr* Ae do not think that any convincing evidence has been offered in favour of the latter alternative and a strong argument against this probability is the fact that it was thought necessary to mention the point at all in the 1923 text. And the specific mention of the Khor Abdullah certainly suggests that the intention was to refer to a channel identifiable under that name and not to the Khor-att-Tha*alab which is described by Wakefield as H a prolongation of both the Abdullah and Sabiyeh Khors'.

Dear Residency, We regret that we should hardly feel justified in making representations to the Iraqi Government about the Iraq - Kuwait frontier incident referred to in your letter 154/5/48 of the 23rd October on the strength of the rather meagre information available and after so long an interval of time. _ &gt; ' You will observe that while the report enclosed in letter No. R/82(17/10 &amp; 4/6) of the 6th October from the Political Agency Kuwait is dated the 30th September, the date on which the alleged incident occurred is not given. Moreover, while Metla*, the place where the incident is said to have occurred, may mean something to those who know the district, this name does not appear in our maps with the result that we should not be in a position to identify the place were the Iraqi authorities to ask us to do so. We are, however, asking the Consul-General at Basra to obtain from the Political Agent more information about the date and locality of the alleged incident, and then to bring the matter to the attention of the local Commandant of Police. Would it not be better if in future these frontier incidents were in the first instance taken up by our authorities on the spot, namely the Political Agent at Kuwait and the Consul-General at Basra, on the understanding of course%that the Political Agent and the Consul-General should keep us informed of what they .were doing? Jli vfft© In this connexion our attention has been drawn to a letter of the 5th June, 1945, from Colonel Sargon, then Inspector of Iraq Constabulary at Basra, to the Consulate- General. Colonel Sargon stated that after a visit to Kuwait, when he had discussed these matters with Sheikh Abdullah Mubarak, he made the following suggestlons:- 1. If an Iraq Police Armed Car or Lorry was seen in Kuwait territory the number should be taken and a note made of the description, whether Lorry or Armed Truck. 2. It should be possible to take the number of the Policemen, as all wear metal numbers, and have shoulder badges as well.as Iraq Police Badges on their Agals. 3* A report should immediately be sent to the Political Agent, who would In turn telegraph to him, in order that he could institute an enquiry without any delay. 4. Regarding any stranger who might be suspected of being an Iraqi Policeman in plain clothes, the Security Police of the State had the powers and would be within their legal rights to detain the person and to check up on his identity. 5• When/ Political Residency, Persian Gulf, BAmm*5. When Sheikh Abdullah went on an Inspection Sargon suggested that he should call at Safwan, when the Assistant Commandant of Police could accompany him on his tour. On the face of it these suggestions seem sound, although the Political Agent should presumably telegraph not to the Iraqi Police authorities but to the Consulate-General, (c.f. 3 above). Indeed in their letter No. 8(22/2/4) of the 3rd January, 1947, the Basra Consulate-General told us that they had recently been requested by the Political Agency at Kuwait to point out to the Mutasarrifiyah of Basra that the proper channel for correspondence between the Agency and the Mutasarrifiyah was the Consulate-General. On that occasion the Mutasarrifiyah alleged to the Consulate-General that as a result of correspondence between the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs and this Embassy it had been agreed that correspondence on ordinary routine matters or matters of an urgent nature could be exchanged direct between the Mutasarrifiyah and the Political Agency and vice-versa, but that procedure should not be used for correspondence on matters of importance which should be dealt with by the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Embassy direct. On looking into our records we find no trace of any corres pondence which dealt with direct communication between the ( Political Agent and the Basra Mutasarrifiyah, but subject to the qualification that the Political Agent should deal with the Iraqi authorities through the Consulate-General, it seems to us only sensible that routinf matters or matters of an urgent nature (such as minor frontier incidents) should be dealt with in the first instance by our authorities on the , spot. Matters involving a question of principle would, of course, be dealt with by the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign | Affairs and this Embassy direct. If you agree with the foregoing perhaps you would be good enough to instruct the Political Agent accordingly, while we for our part would so inform the Consulate-General at Basra. We are copying this letter to both.

I have had my old records searched, and all we can find is that in 1936, Fowle proposed that a mixed commission should deal with outstanding cases, vide his letter C/82 of the 20th July, 1936, to the India Office of which a copy was forwarded to Kuwait under P.L C/83 of the same date, and that such a commission subsequently met, vide De Caury’s letter C/59 of the 11th February 1937* After this, an endeavour was made without success to get the Iraoi Q-overnment to accept the principle of Joint enquiry, c.f. Fowle's D.O. letter No. 517-S of 6th July 1937, to Clerk-Kerr, a cooy of wheih was sent to Kuwait under endorsement No. 518-S of the same date. I note, however, that in 19^6 Tandy proposed that if details of a specific case of the violation of the Kuvrait frontier by Iraqi Police were obtained, he should report it unofficially to Saagan and that I agreed, vide my telegram T/273 of the 18th June, 19^6. * Z'l 3.

Pi /ill you please refer to your letter No.154/9/48 dated 20th December, 1948? I am sorry for the delay in replying which is due to our fruitless endeavours to obtain more information about the incursion. 2. With regard to the ’metla* this is the pass and hilly area some 12 miles from Kuwait at the head of Kuwait bay. It overlooKs Jahra, and is on the main road from Kuwait to Zubair. It is not possible to leave Kuwait for the north direct except by traver sing the ’metla’. 3. With regard to the points raised at the time ]j ^ • of Col. Jargon 1 s visit to Kuwait in 1945: 1. This can be done, but would not be so easy as it may sound because of poor visibility, dust, etc. It is oossible that a car chasing an Iraqi police car across the desert to obtain its number might give rise to a further undesira ble incident. 2 . This is even less easy to do than 1 . above. We could try. 3. Reports should, I think, be sent through the proper channels. To deal direct - .particularly now that Col. oargon has gone - with the Inspector of Constabu lary, Basra, might lead to misunderstan ding and would be unlikely to jrove satisfactory. 4. There is no objection to ohis procedure on the understanding that the Iraqi Government would raise none if we do follow it. 5. I think the Kuwait authorities should keep their independence of action when touring in Kuwait territory, to do otherwise is to sell the pass. 4. Chancery’s penultimate para raises the whole question of correspondence between Kuwait and the Iraqi authorities, and personally I doubt whether it is appropriate to do so on the issue of speeding up settlement of frontier incidents.

In actual facts matters of policy are few and far between, but there is considerable correspon dence on what might be termed unimportant, or routine matters. All this at present comes through the ninbassy and the Iraqi Ministry of foreign Affairs and if this is materially reduced in volume, we shall undoubtedly give the Iraqis reason to thinK that we have altered the form of our representation. This might have unfortunate repurcussions on the rather patronising attitude of Iraq towards Kuwait.

These suggestions will be complied with whenever possible which is not likely to be often. 3.

We do not like this proposal at all and are doubtful whether the Iraq authorities would be willing to reciprocate. 2. Generally speaking, we agree that the Political Agency should ordinarily inform the Basrah Consulate- General direct in the first instance of all frontier incidents for such enquiries and action as may be possible, leaving it to be decided at a later stage whether any particular incident should be taken up at a higher level or not. We propose however to leave it to the discretion of the Political Agent to report an incident to this Residency in the first place rather than tc the Basrah- Consulate- General if he has special grounds for prefering this procedure 2.

C/323 of the 9th July, 1940 ). At that time he was of the opinion ( with which Scott agreed ) that the location was at the 10th telegraph pole from Safwan which would ma^e the location about 1000 yards, in accordance with which the board was re-erected in 1940. 3. The Iraqis in their protest ( vide Baghdad P.L. No. 360/10/40 dated the 27th June, 1940 ) stated 2 (W*- -^s regards the location of the notice that?* , Hi- 'h* locally that the frontier was crossed to a depth of 1000 metres from 3afwan. ^his statement is not easy to understand; it seems to mean that the party arrived at a point about 1000 metres from Safwan, and allowing their claim of penetration of 250 metres, that the frontier board, according to their estimation, was 1250 metres south from Jafwan. His Majesty’s Fjnbassy, Baghdad, refuted the protest (vide Baghdad P.L. No. 360/17/40 daoed the 3rd August, 1940) but to the besu of my belief no final decision as to the actual past position of the notice board has been arrived at by His Majesty’s Government. A n authoritative ruling was given by the Foreign Office (vide Mr. Hendall’s letter No. E 7061/127/91 of the 22 nd January, 1936) when a point one mile south of Safwan was decided upon. Presumably the 1940 formula was based on this ruling on the understanding, as clearly stated by Mr. fiend-11, that the position of the board was/accepted as one mile south of 3afwan which statement itself was based on Colonel Dickson’s statement. It seems to me therefore, that the point one mile south of Safwan should be adhered to. 3• At this stage, before marking the point on a large scale map, I suggest that a closer definition of Safwan is necessary due to the fact that that term itself leads to ambiguity. Safwan consists of a well, a palm grove, the Security Police lost, and 100 yards south of that Post, the Customs Post enclosed by a compound wall.
