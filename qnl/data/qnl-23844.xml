Jones writes that he has written to Commodore Richard Ethersey, Commanding Officer Persian Gulf Squadron, the British Agent at Sharjah, Hajjī Yaqoob, and the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, Zayid bin Khalīfah, requesting clarification of events at Abu Dhabi, and information on those who should be held responsible for the theft and damage, in response to conflicting reports he has received to date, suggesting that it was Shaikh Zayid’s supporters, and not his enemies, who ransacked the bazaars of Abu Dhabi. The three letters requesting clarification are enclosed:1. Letter no.266 of 1856 (folio 52) from Jones to Ethersey, dated 29 August 1856;2. The translation of a letter (folio 53) to the British Agent at Sharjah [Yaqoob], dated 29 August 1856;3. The translation of a letter (folio 54) from Jones to the Chief of Abu Dhabi [Shaikh Zayid], dated 29 August 1856.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024066926.0x00000f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
