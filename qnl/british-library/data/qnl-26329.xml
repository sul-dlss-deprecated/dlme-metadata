(a ) Increase R . A »F . inst ruc tors in Kab ul. (i) There are no proper training facilities in Kabul. The airfields are 6000 ft. high; hills rising to 12000 ft. dn close proximity surromd them, thus limiting the air space available. M&amp;ff'flying is unsage. Stocks of petrol, spares, and even the aircraft themselves, are not available to meet a large flying training commitment. There are no tech nical schools eouipped to undertake the training of tie ground staff. (ii) R.A.F. instructors ’’off duty' are not allowed to mix with their pupils. If they do sc, they will be accused of trying to pump British propoganda into the Afghans. (iii) The R.A.F. will be under the closest observation, all movements are reported by the police, and nobody is allowed outside tie town without permission and an escort. Living conditions in the town are not too good. This would make the R.A.F. instructors unhappy and frustrated. (iv) The necessary discipline of a school oould never be enforced in the atmosphere of the Sherpur or Khaja Rawah airfields. (v) The Afghans pupils would miss the opportunity of going to India, and og observing the effects of the British rule, which has entirely misrepresented’ ' r ’'' i a ' '■ 11 ' ' \ to them. Trainees returning to Kabul, after a stay in India, are generally sympathetic to our cause, and sceptical of any adverse reports that they may hear. (b) Limiting training in India to itffa En Af ghan instr^tors only . &lt; . ■% (i) There are a fev/ Afghan officers, train**—‘^origin ally by the British and- Italians in th, 1930s, who would make ouite good instructors. However on return to Kabul they would meet the same difficulties that R.A.P. instructors would, as enumerated in (a) (i) &amp; (ivj above. Furthermore training would be greatly reduced by senior Air Force officers on the grounds of economy. 2. Ibwsver, of the two suggestions, I prefer the latter. The u/t instructors should receive the approval of w/Cdr. B.P. King before leaving Kabul, and the Afghan Government should be informed that on return, their instructors must receive every co-cperation, or else their efforts will be wasted. i 1 Wing Commander. -oft A. 20 ^ 0 ^ J /t- &amp; ^ F' -WARNING.—This cypher message must first be paraphrased if it is necessary to publish its text or to communicate it to persons outside British or United States Government Services and Departments.

The officer selected to have had experience in giving instruction in and practical experience of observers work. A knowledge of W/T would be an additional advantage. (ii) whether it would be possible for the R.A.F. in India to provide facilities for the training of 2 radio mechanics, 2 photo graphers, and 2 officers or N.C.O’s in electric and gas welding. A complete and full course of training required in each case. % (iii) an enquiry as to whether 2 youths could be given a full course of apprentice training in the manufacture and repair of aero engines with a civil firm in India or England, and similar facilities given to 2 youths for training as fitters. i The requests at (ii) and (iii) are at present in the nature of enquiries as to the cost of the training, length of the course etc. and have been referred to the G-ovemment of India.

On 22nd August the Chief of the General Staff stated (A) that his Govt were desirous of revising the terms of service of officers of the Afghan Air Force with a view to securing a more rapid turn over of officers of suitable age for service in the air force and greater efficiency. The Ministry of Defence proposed to post a number of cadets who have recently passed out of the Military College to the air force, and then send them to India for initial and advanced flying training. Later on these officers would replace officers in the air force who have now 10 to 20 years service as pilots or observers, and are too old for retention in their present employment.D.O.No.581/44. R.

In further answer to your letter of May 11th to Air Coramodore Beaumont, we have consulted the Air Staff about the suggestion that some Afghan pilots should be given flying training in this country, and their view is that, apart altogether from the ban on travelling, it would be more convenient if this training were given in India, where excellent facilities are available. We take it that the Afghans' desire for advanced training tt would be more than satisfied if they were taken as far as our third stage, a Service Plying Training School, as it is difficult to imagine circumstances in which they could employ the complicated flying technique of the final stage, the Operational Training Unit, We have received a copy of Mr.C.B.Duke's letter of April 28th to Mr.Squire, and from this it would seem that it will be quite easy to make the necessary arrange ments in India; but if we can help in any way, please let us know.

Requests for Advanced Training for Afghan Pilots . The Afghan Chief of the Oeneral Staff stated on 29th March, that his Government .wished to send two or three of the air force pilots to India or England, for advanced flying training, and asked the Military Attache to make enquiries as to whether this training could be provided by the Royal Air Force. The Officers to he sent would also like to see various new types of aircraft, and acquire some knowledge of modern developments in air matters.Copy (E 2652/414/97) Foreign Office Minute on letter No* 561/44 of 1st April from His Majesty T s Minister»KePul Subject : Proposal to train Afghan pilots in InPiu or the United Kingdom. If the Afghans are anxious that their pilots should come to England I hope we shall be able to comply. Though they might get as good training in India - possibly even better in view of the greater similarity of conditions there to those in Afghanistan - it would do much more for their general education to be trained by the Royal Air Force here: and this is really fnore important in the long run. A few picked and English-trained pilots in the Afghan air force could make a lot of difference.

But if they do hanker after sending them to the U.K - and it is possible that they may wish to follow Persia's example in this - it would be as well to have our answer ready. The Poreign Office, who have experience of arranging training of Persian pilots over here, will be able to advise as to practicability, facilities, cost and length of course.

The position had not beer very easy for his Government during the war, but fortunately the connection with the R.a.F. had been established before the present war broke out. They had been compelled, for political reasons, to give up much of the programme they had mapped out for dispatching a few of their army and air force officers and students to India for training, but later when the international situation became more clear it might be possible to carry out some of these projects.a SjiCKjii 1942. lixlracfc from Kabul Inf611 once Summary no.^6 for the week ending the 14th november 1941.

As in the past the preliminary lack of knowledge of English has been a serious handicap in training and on this occasion despite very extensive instruction progress in this respect has not been good, it will however be realised that technical training can be given and absorbed in an imitative fashion and there is net the same urge nor urgency in acquiring English that exists __on c have a period of two'to three months with other forms of training, me tion of training under war conditions makes that any future entrants should concentrated teaching of English and elementary mathematics prior to joining a school from Afghanistan. 3. The original party consisted of 24 and of these 23 have completed training. During the 12 month's training, one cadet who had previously received a. year's instruction at Aircraft Depot.

Air Forces In Training of Afghan Air For Personnel - Final Renort The training of 26 Afghan Ai personnel was concluded at Ambaia and Lahore'’ on 14th April and the parties proceeded to Peshawar 15th April whence they departed en- route for Afghanistan 16th April 1939. The original party which arrived in April 1938 numbered 29. Of these one, under training as a pilot was found physically unfit to continue such training and having refused to undertake technical training as an alternative, was returned to Afghanistan; one under training as a fitter/rigger was found to be physically unfit to continue training in India and was returned to Afghanistan and one other under training as a fitter/rigger died shortly after arrival at Karachi. It was originally planned that the following training should be carried out - 8 pilots 8 observers 8 flight mechanics 2 fitters aero engine 1 electrician 1 armourer 1 wireless operator. The selection of personnel for each branch of the training was left to the discretion of Air Force Headquarters in India. Medical and selection boards were convened at Peshawar and allocations made accordingly withthe single exception that 10 were placed under training as fitter/riggers instead of 8 as flight mechanics and 2 as fitters aero engine. It is desirable as and when occasion arises in c the future and if this practice is to he follow* again that the trainees should understand clearly that the selection board alone are in a position to judge fitness for the various branches of training. The medical standard of the trainees on arrival was not up to normal Air Force require ments. On the other hand there was a reason able expectation that with careful feeding and exercise a comparable standard would be reached. This hope has been realised and in every instance there has been a very considerable improvement in general physical fitness. The selection for training in the various groups occasioned a certain amount of distress for naturally the majority aspired to train as pilots or at least as observers and were apparently aware that such qualification would carry with it higher rank and pay on completion of training. The particular instance which may be quoted is that of the wireless operator Amin Khan. His trade requires considerable intelligence and ability and although this individual might with advantage have been selected for pilot train ing it was equally important that one of the outstanding candidates should be chosen for wireless operator training. During initial training there was from time to time arecrudescence of feeling over this matter since the mechanics felt that theirs was rather a menial position. It is believed that this situation is not likely to arise again since there appears now to be a general understanding and appreciation of the true position that in an air force organised on the Afghan lines all groups are equally vital links in successful operation. To foster this understanding, during training final it was arranged that pilots and observers took their full share of the work involved in refuelling aircraft, in cleaning and where practicable in inspection and repair work. The propagation and main tenance of this spirit of active cooperation should receive particular care, one manner in which it may be facilitated is to arrange that mechanics should be taken as passengers when ever possible and invariably when test flights are being carried out subsequent to repairs or overhauls made by them, only thus is it possible to engender that pride in workmanship and to create that high standard of main tenance essential in an Air Force. On arrival the trainees were supposed to possess a reasonable knowledge of English and to have received a sound basic education. On investigation it was however evident that their knowledge in these respects was inadequati generally for air force training purposes. In these circumstances English and educational classes were organised inmediately and continu ed throughout the initial eight months training’ 1 ''■’ l - 4. ^ period. The majority of trainees took full advantage of the instruction offered and several now have a good working knowledge of English. It cannot he too strongly impressed that a good sound knowledge of English and elementary mathematics are essential to the proper assimilation of air force instruction since it is impracticable to translate into Farsi or Pushtoo the highly technical matter involved. For this reason any persons intended in future to he placed under Instruction should receive an intensive course in English and a refresher course in mathematics for approximate ly three months before commencing instruction. One final point arises on the general aspect of training. The recent trainees were on the average about 17i years old. This , practice should be continued and entries restricted to those between 17 and 19 years of age. Such young men develope rapidly during their period of training. It is desirable therefore that they should acquire from the outset a military smartness and a pride in their personal appearance since this will be directly reflected in their work, in the care of aircraft and in their personal discipline. To this end it is advisable that funds be provided to enable them to purchase uniform, sports, and civilian clothing on arrival and that a regular monthly sum be issued as pocket money for minor essential purchases and to facilitate the development of a sense of independence and care in money matters. Itis suggested that money should not he spent on clothing in Afghanistan since frequently this is, owing to the different climates, unsuitable for wear in India and essentials can generally be purchased at short notice and more cheaply in India, a sum of approximately Rs. 250 each would be required to supply the full require ments of uniform, civilian and sports clothing and would be best controlled by some central authority to ensure that good quality materials and uniformity of pattern is obtained. It is necessary for candidates to be in possession of blue uniform caps and buttons and badges of their service since these are not obtainable in India. Subject to this money being available a monthly allowance of Rs. 15 would be adequate for pocket money. There is little regarding training to add in this final report to that included in the report on the period up to 15th December 1938. The past four months has been spent in consolidating the knowledge acquired and in practical experience in operating an air force detachment. Each party at Ambala and Lahore had two aircraft placed in their charge and ran in effect an independent flight with a min imu m of Royal Air Force supervisory personnel. In view of the length of training the standard of work throughout has been commendably high and that of two or three pilots and at least one fitter/rigger outstanding. Individual reports on all trainees are attached. The pilots are generally very good, safe and reliable in their work. Instruction duringthe past four months has Included bombing and gunnery and since in these subjects as well as navigation and reconnai^ance they have achieved a good average standard it may be said that they are fit to take their places on air operations. It must be realised however that the pilot is only one member of the crew. Given good co operation between pilot and observer the present trainees will display a higji standard of skill in air operations. The observers have reached a good standard of efficiency. They have, with the pilots, been instructed during the past four months in bombing and gunnery and as crew members may therefore be considered fit to participate in air operations. The fitter/riggers have acquired an immense amount of knowledge. One or two possess a natural aptitude for such work and are more advanced than their colleagues, on the other hand constant practice will now be necessary to enable all to obtain the ultimate benefit of the instruction given, owing to the specialised nature of the knowledge they have acquired it is of great importance that they should be employed for at least one year solely on Hawker aircraft. The work they have carried out qualifies them for the execution of day-to-day maintenance and periodic inspections. Ability to carry out major inspections, repairs and workshop overhauls will develops with continued practical experience. No effort should be spared in these first few months inimpressing on these officers the vital importance of meticulous care and attention to detail in their work if the high standard of maintenance essential to successful air force operation is to he achieved. The armourer has done very well indeed and is now competent to carry out normal main tenance of amament equipment. He can also develops and mark camera gun films and act as observer of bombing practices over a camera obscura. The electrician has a fair knowledge 4f his trade and will be competent to carry out normal electrical maintenance work. He requires however considerable practical ex perience to develops the necessary skill-of- hand for fine electrician work. The wireless operator has had the most difficult and involved training. Nevertheless he has reached a stage when he is capable of operating in the air and on the ground. It is of importance that he should be provided with regular opportunities to practice his trade since otherwise the knowledge and ability he has acquired will be rapidly lost. Moreover the practice is necessary in order that he may acquire that meticulous care necessary to the maintenance of inter-communication under all conditions. This report cannot be concluded without a reference to the two outstanding trainees. • Adam Khan, pilot, has shown throughout ability in all directions, he possess/a quiet and0 MM 8 . pleasant manner and has imdouhted qur-litles of leadership. Ahdul Sattar Khan, fitter- rigger, has a natural aptitude for mechanical work. He Is careful and sets a hi^i example to others in this respect. He has an attractive and engaging personality, good power of command and should with further experience he qualified for supervisory duties. Finally it may he said that the spirit of cooperation between the instructional staff and the pupils and the enthusiasm and readiness at all times of the trainees to put in long hours of work and study have contributed in no small degree to the successful conclusion of a difficult task. $dJ- H A' , '-j • C'* Air Marshal, Commanding, Air Forces in India.

He is a very good type of officer, punctiliously polite and correct in his attitude towards all. He has a keen sense of humour which, on occasion, he is prepared to turn against himself. Although there must be a doubt that he will develop into a good observer7 it may well be that the all-round knowledge he has acquired with regard to Air Force matters will fit him for en?&gt;loyment on Air Force administrative duties if such an appointment is to be made.

The training of the 13 Afghan CBiiets ^ -ar Force station, Tribal a. coi^'ienced on 15.12 • 1938 and was completed on 15.4.1939. 2. The progreas achieved by the cadets during this period has been most gratifying. They have maintained the high standard of keenness shown during their initial training at Aircraft T)epot and at all times they subfiiitted reexlily to discipline. No untoward incidents of any kind occurred during their stay at Mbala. 3. Among the Ambaia contingent, the four pilots are out standing in progress made. The very sound foundation of their flying instruction at Aircraft Depot has proved its value in their advanced training and they now handle the Hawker hart \aircraft with confidence end skill. By comparison with British trainees of equal flying experience they are up to standard in every respect. In particular their formationiak take-offs and general formation flying are above the average of the junior British Pilot Officer. IU.gg.i p llftg A . 4. Throughout the course discipline has been excellent. There was no evidence at Ambaia of the ill-feeling which arose at Drigh Hoad when the mechanics were detailed to perform the 'menial' work of starting aircraft. Strict impartiality was observed in all dealings with the cadets and all were made to perform in turn the miscellaneous flight duties such as cleaning aircraft, handling aircraft in and out of hangars, refuelling, keeping the pilots' room tidy, taking messages to various Sections, etc. Frequent lectures were given to them on the importance of unity mid of strict compliance with orders. 5. Flying discipline was excellent and only two minor cases ~ of bl each of orders' came to my notice. Preventive lectures v were given at frequest intervals. '—-— 6. The cadets were drilled by the Drill Instructor to Ho. 1 Squadron, Indian :±r Force; the exercises included elementary rifie drill and were very popular with the cadets whose general appearance and turn-out has improved considerably during the past four months. In the event of future training being under taken io is recommended that frequent drill parades snould be held under a qualified instructor. Imaging. apd 7. The cadets were accomodated in a large private bungalow at 102, tile mall. The bungalow included a Mess and catering was provided by Mohammed Saaaim &amp; Co., Contractors to Air Force fetation, Ambaia. 0. The quarters were adequate in every way and the standard of messing was excellent. unly a very few minor complaints were received from the cadets in respect of messing and the Contractor was always eager to give them satisfaction. /Cigarettes/ 23 •» t 2 t- Ci^arettes were provided as part of the contract and at one time the Contractor complained that the cadets were increasing their consumption to unreasonable limits. This was explained to the cadets who were then limited to one packet of ten cigarettes per day per smoker; no exception was taken to this rule. 9. The cadets were frequently entertained to dinner at the Officers 1 Mess. 10. In the early stages of their stay at imbala the cadets were given every encouragement to play association fobtball and badminton. Football games against the airmen were arranged for them and presentation cups were promised for badminton contests. It soon became evident, however, that they are not naturally keen on games and were only playing them to please their instructor. As soon as the novelty of the games wore off their interest waned and when, for instance, they had used up the supply of shuttlecocks, they were careful not to ask for more until their instructor insisted on knowing why badminton was no longer played in their mess. 11. Darts and a 'carrum' board were provided for their ante room and appealed to them far more than the strenuous exertion demanded in a lively game of football against British troops. 12. The cadets were taken to see the Quarter Finals of the Northern India Boxing Championships held at Anbala. This event probably did more to given them an insight into the British character than any one month's contact with Englishmen. The 1 Afghan mind, accustomed to taking immediate and xiin violent offence at any physical or mental assault, was at frist quite unable to understand the friendly smile and handshake given by a blood-stained and vanquished opponent. I endeavoured to take this arid other opportunities to enlighten them as to some of the characteristics of the English. ^ ^ 20. A farewell Guest Night in the Officers' Mess was held in honour of the Afejian cadets on 11.4.1939, and the following Cups were presented : Pilots Forced-Landing Test &amp; General Formation Flying Cup, Observers Air-to-Ground Hear Camera Gun Competition and Pinpointing Test Cup, Flight Mechanics Cup for Practical and Theoretical Examination, as also a cup presented by Flying Officer Burt-Andrews for the 'Best All-Round Pupil of the Course*. Wing Commander C.F. Horsley, M.C., made a speech of farewell to the cadets and Adam Khan replied in a short, extremely well delivered speech in English. 21. A Course photograph was taken on 11.4.1939 and a copy is attached to this Report. OmslmioiLu V| 22. The general progress made by all the cadets during the last year has been surprising. They have always shown great keenness in their work and it is my opinion that they have thoroughly enjoyed their stay in India. With good leadership the cadets will become efficient members of their Air Force.25. In conclusion I wish to record the unstinting co-operation given to the Afghan Training Flight by the Officer 5oiinaming Air Force station, Aaibala, mid by all ranks of No. 1 Squadron, liidiau lir Force and of No. 60 (Bomber) Squadron, Royal Air Force. It is literally true to state that without their generous guidance and assistance the Flight could not have functioned. od/- C'.B.F.

No actual syllabus of instruction was laid down for the Afghan mechanics. The aim of their training at Ambala was rather to give them practical experience in the maintenance of a Flight and to familiariBe them with the hundred and one details of Service custom and requirements. They have made excellent progress and with suitable supervision can be trusted to carry out ail but major inspections. 2. It must be borne in mind that their training at Dri^i Road only lasted 8 months end that prior to this their general knowledge concerning mechanics and the manipulation of instru-^ merits was negligible. It is therefore most gratifying that they are now capable of routine maintenance of a Hart type Flight. 3* As regards major inspections, they have a sound knowledge of tiie procedure to oe adopted, but they are still lacking in detailed knowledge of individual components of airframe and engine (such as complete dismantling of &amp; carburettor and method of carrying out a flow teat) and they are inexperienced in workshop procedure. It is difficult to* see how this advanced knowledge can be gained by the cadets without a further course of instruction; flight experience alone will not suffice. 4. During their stay at Ambala the cadets carried out successfully tiie following inspections; Daily inspections, 6 15-hour inspections, 4 30-hour inspections, and 1 60-hour inspection; in addition they assisted materially in carrying out a 120-hour inspection. 5. They have reached a satisfactory standard of efficiency in all miscellaneous Flight duties, o.g. refuelling, handling of aircraft on the tarmac and into hangars, starting up and running up of aircraft, maintenance of a high standard of cleanliness. Form 700 procedure, Flidit petrol book procedure, etc. In addition to the above the mechanics have acquired a gpod working knowledge of general aerodrome rules. They were frequently flown as passengers on the morning air tests mid aftor inspec tions. 6 . The observers* training has consisted primarily in advanced F.T.b. exercises, as follows: pinpointing accurately on the one-inch imp, reconnaissance, wind speed and direction finding with the C.S.B.3., dummy bombing runs over the Camera Cbscura, rear camera gun oir-to-air and air-to-ground, artillery reconnaissance (puff shoots), cross country naviga tion end log-keeping.7. The observers have reached a satisfactory standard of training and their general air sense and experience is adequate# 8# Lectures were given to the observers on the following subject : Compasses and comp&amp;cs correction, Formation flying and sisals, T'ind speed and airection finding, Bombing, The C.r#B#S, t The Tail Drift bjgjit, The Camera Obscura. The observers are capable of operating the camera cbscura unaided by British personnel# In addition to the ai ove lectures, they were given a series of lectures on armament, tne details of which are attached as Appendix A to this neport# 9. ’Hie observers were unable to carry out camera obscura bombing with W/T owing to the length of time required to obtain wireless eouinment from Aircraft i^epot* ^hen the equipment was finally obtained the Bomber Hart had become time expired# 10.

BOMBING. Instruction in the use of the C.S,B,S, was given to all observers, and air exercise involving its use (straight runs over the Camera Gbscura and finding «,S, CD,) were carried out. The tendency of all observers, however, is to neglect essential points in the manipulation of the C,S,B,£, when in the air, and is &amp; feature that will need constant supervision, 5, gamers, luscunu (a) The theory of the Camera Cbscura was explained to all pilots and observers and instruction given in its use. All observers have carried out practices involving the calculation of W,S, &amp; D, and the air and ground-speeds of aircraft flying over the Camera Obseura and are now capable of working a fixed Camera Obscura unaided, (b) All crews carried out strai^it runs over the Camera Obscura and attained a reasonable standard of proficiency, (c) It was not possible to carry out Camera Obscura bombing as the aircraft fitted to take the W/T installation had become time-expired when the wireless equipment was eventually received, 6. , an d , .Piya.. (a) It was not possible to carry out any practice bombing as the Bombing Range was not available when the pupils had reached a sufficiently hirfi standard to carry out these exercises. Practice dive-bombing on the camera gun target was however given to all pilots, (b) Practice in the loading and testing of bomb-carriers prior to flight was given to all pilots and observers. /GUNNERY7, Vjglar g , tm* All pilots received instruction in stoppages and immediate action* It was not possible, however, u&gt; carry out any ground firing (when a sat is factory standard of training nan been reached] owing to lack of Armament personnel and other commitments* Knowledge of the mechanism of the gun is satis factory, but all pupils require constant practice in immediate action* 6* JmiJL am* All observers received instruction in stoppages and immediate action and were practised in immediate action on tne 25 x range* Though very keen on this side of their instruction, they need constant supervision and are not yet ready to carry out air firing* Knowledge of gun mechanism is satisfactory* 9.

(b) Observer's. All observers carried out air to ground exercises, but the results obtained were not satisfactory* 10. All equipment had to be obtained on loan from one of the Squadrons stationed at Ambala as and when it could be made available* This at times made it difficult to co-ordinate ground instruction and air practice, and to drain*' up programmes in advance. 11* As mentioned in para. 9 above, no front camera gun practices could be carried out owing to the lack of the parts necessary to modify the aircraft to mount a Camera gin* In any case, receipt of these parts would have necessitated putting the aircraft l T /§ for several days for the incorporation of the modification and consequent loss of valuable flying time. rnSQU ML. 12* The Armament personnel of Nos* 28 (AC) and 60 (B) Squadrons, R.A.F., and No.l (AC) bquadron, I.A.K* co-operated to the best of their ability with the Officer i/c Afrfian Flight, but it was not always possible to meet his requirements regarding programmes owing to the demands of their own Units, ana to the shortage of personnel. ommm. 13. Many of the difficulties encountered could be avoided by the formation of a self-contained unit f however small; the provision of aircraft fitted with the equipment necessary to carry out the work required; and the posting of an N.C.O. e uallfied to instruct and supervise in Armament matters. This nit could then, for the most part, be independent of, and be /ableable to operate without, the assistance of the other Units on the Station as regirds either personnel or equipment, an arrangement making for greater efficiency.

The main point of note is the keenness shown by all throughout their course and the manner in which they worked so hard, without exception there was no one amongst them who wasted Ms time. If by chance there was sometime to spare in the day ’b programme, they always asked for some extra work, apart from this they invaribaly asked for questions to be set for them to answer in the evenings, they always wnated some form of homework. 2.

The majority on the gound witn the aid of a pole model. The number was high because it ms impossible to get good results for a long ttne; they seemed to grasp where they ought to aim but when the films were developed, the results were conaistently poor. Finally one Af^ian obtained a good result and shortly after all were satisfactory. 7. Similarly, wind speed and direction finding and camera obscura bombing results were poor until one crew produced a good result iamediatelv after which everyone else’s results improved. 8. The results of the last few camera obscura bombing exercises v»ere distinctly gratifying. Sven so it is felt that it is not possible really to assess them as bombing pilots or bomb aimers until they have had exercises on a range with practice bomba. 9. The exercise which was grasped the easiest was artillery reconnaissance, good results were produced in id this right from the beginning. 10. During ni^ht flying at Lahore, Afghans were always present. Tne wireless operator with the duty signallerf the armourer with the duty armourer, the pilots and observers either with the officer in charge of night flying 4 or the Aerodrome control officer. The Afghan mechanics usually stayed with the crews of the aircraft which were eng^geu in the flying. 11. The mechanics attended pilot end observers lectures numbered 1 -2, 8, 10, 19 - 20, 32-41. They a.1 so received several lectures on the Kestrel engine, particular attention being paid to'the oil system. 12. t All inspections on the two Karts have been carried out by Afghan mechanics up to and including 120 hours, they having signed the'forms 700 for thus work. 13. ius it decided to have a Board of Survey on one of the Harts, all the Afghans were permitted to take part Krprn this they derived great benefit, learning seferal things that tney did not know before. 14. t Due to the amount of non-flying days due to having to writ for spares and also to bad weather it was tound possible for the mechanics to spend a large amount oi time in the station workshops.

It is stated that their general bearing and their smartness, particularly in dress, has made a considerable impression. To their colleagues they have spoken in enthusiastic terms regarding their training in India, and how well they were looked after during the year they spent there.P.Z.2775/39 SECRET 57 EXTRACT from N.W.R.P. Weekly Intelligence Summary No. 16 dated 17th April, 1939. 16-A. Twenty-six 3 ^oung Afghans, all inhabitants of Kabul, who have received training with the Royal Air Force at Lahore, Delhi and Karachi during the past eighteen months, returned to Afghanistan from Peshawar on April 16th.(15) Training of Air Force Personnel Abroad. 367. In April the Afghan Government despatched eight pilots, eight observers, eight engine mechanics, two fitters, one AV]T operator, one armourer, one electrician and one meteorologist to India for one year’s training in “ iei ^ respective duties by the Royal Air Force. These aviation students were selected from various schools in Kabul, and were given very sketchy theoretical tram- ins before being sent to India. The training is being provided free by the Gov ernment of India. Reports from India indicate that all the students are making satisfactory progress and the Afghan Government have frequently expressed their oratitude for the facilities given to them for training their air force personnel in India In November an officer of the Afghan Air Force visited the students at Karachi with a view to ascertaining the progress they had made. On his return to Kabul he expressed his complete satisfaction with the type of training being given by the Royal Air Force and the standard of efficiency attained by the students Two of the students have been returned to Kabul owing to ill-health, mid one student died in Karachi. When these students return to Afghanistan next April they will form a useful nucleus of trained personnel for the Afghan Air Force. 368. The grant of facilities for training Afghans in aviation in India has alreadv produced a change in outlook and a more friendly attitude towards the British amongst officers of the Air Force and the Ministry of Defence and while owing to tne high cost of British aircraft, it may not be possible for the Afghan Government to purchase all their aircraft from British sources they will probably continue to obtain a proportion of their requirements from England. •v-q j n February it was reported that sixteen students for training in avia tion'were to be despatched to Italy, and that these students were being given instruction in the Italian language in Kabul. During the summer reports were very eondicting and the number of students to be sent to Italy increased to thirty- three So far as is known none have been sent during the year, and it is possible that the offer by the Government of India to give free training for one year to some thirty aviation students forestalled an Italian offer.FILE CORY fo • _ 959 j 1959 , MXL AFFAIRS New ljelid 9 &lt; 23 -^ J anu^oy tafcl939, e are fenwding by thia lla.il a report on ti^e recent train ing of Afghan lir Force peraomiol at Karachi f witli a copy of a not© recorded by the Air Officer Coomnciing. 2* The Air Officer G(k&amp;muaiii&amp; hm ©ug^eated that when his obsenratxons are conveyed to tiie Af^ian Oovornr^ent, their reaction© mtgfit be ascertai neu to a proposal titfit a Hawker flight of four aircrf%ft should viait Kabul in hay next.

Training facilities for the Afghan Air Force in India and Afghan purchase of Italian aircraft. Please see the previous minutes at P.Z.8227/37. 2. The Government of India hove now agreed (P.Z*1342/38) to provide a year’s training in India for 8 pilots, 8 observers and 12 mechanics of the Afghan Air Force, trainin ; to comnence from 15th April next. They also hope to be able to undertake the training of a meteorologist and a wireless mechanic, as requested by the Afghan Government. Me: sing and accommodation in India will be provided free for all these personnel by the Government of India, and the Afghan Government will only have to pay the cost of their travelling expenses to and from ndia at the beginning and end of the period of training. The entire cost which the Government of India have agreed to meet is estimated at about three lakhs and it is proposed to meet it from the Afghan Reserve Fund. The Afghan Government have accepted these arran ements 'with much gratitude”. This is extremely satisfactory. 3. Particulars furnished by the Afghan Prime Minister regarding the Afghan purchase of Italian aircraft and regarding the Italian air instructors who have been sent to Kabul were reported in Colonel Fraser-Tytler f s despatch of 24th January at P.Z. 926/38. Twenty-four aeroplanes were purchased in Italy; sixteen Romeo machines, costing £4,800 each and eight Breda training machines at £2,250 to £2,500 each. The v/hole Italian contract, including spare parts, war material, etc., amounted to almost £160,000, payable by the Afghans as follows:- the first instalment on the signature of «474B Wt 22530/P 144 10,000 9.37 IOP the/the contract, the second on the arrival of the consignment, and the balance in three further annual instalments conmencinc from a year after the arrival of the consignment. It will be remembered that the Afghans had to pay 56,250 to 56,500 each for the eight Hawker Hind aircraft purchased in this country. The total Hawker contract amounted to somewhat over 580,000, repayable by the Afghans throu$i the Government of India in six annual instalments. It will be seen that the price of the British aircraft compares rather unfavourably with the Italian, though the credit facilities granted to the Afghans were somewhat more favourable in the case of the Hawker contract. If His Majesty’s Government could be persuaded to allow the Afghans to purchase British aircraft on future occasions at 'Government prices” the position vis-a-vis foreign competitors would be greatly improved. 4. TCith regard to the Italian Air ?/!lssion, three Italians, a civil pilot, a clerk and a mechanic, arrived in Kabul at the end of November last, and a further five Italians have just recently arrived (forminka 17 at P.Z. 937/38 and Katodon 24 of 7th March at P.Z, 1566/38). According to Colonel Praoer-O^/tler’s present information the five new arrivals are the instructors referred to in paragraph 2 of his despatch of 24th January (P.Z.926/33), while the three who arrived previously are representatives of the Italian Company providing the machines, and will return to Italy after handing them over* In any ease the Italian Mission cannot be regarded as excessive in view of the number of Italian aircraft purchased by the Afghans; there are four British instructors at Kabul/Minute Paper Department. In view of what they are already doing the G.of I#eay that they would be unable to meet the expenditure on this. J.C.r, 15.3 5. Kabul to deal with only ei$it machines. In view of this it seems unnecessary to pursue any further the Air Ministry proposal to stiffen the British party of instructors by sending out to Kabul a senior British Air Force Officer. + Such reports as we have received * * indicate that the British Air Instructors have made a good impression, and the evolutions performed by Mr. Russell Stracey, the leader of the party, with one of the Hawker aircraft, over Kabul, have been much admired (though some attempt was made by Italian propaganda to pretend that the machine was Italian). The Italian aircraft on the other hand have not, at first at any rate,.proved very satisfactory, but this state of affairs will no doubt be remedied by the arrival of the new instructors. Ye have asked Colonel Fraser-Tytler to send us reports from time to time on the relative performance of the British and Italian aeroplanes. 5. The Air Ministry are still investigating the possibility of Gelling aircraft to the Afghans in future , at Government price and also the (question whether they would be able to give us some aBSurance that they would, if necessary, be able to supply the future requirements of the Afghan Air Force in respectr of aircraft in spite of the British armament programme. r 'here is no urgency about these questions since it is 'unlikely that the A'$ians will require, or will be able to afford, to purchase any further supplies of aircraft for one or two years. 6. It is to be hoped that the training facilities which are being provided in India will have the effect of preventing the Afghan Air Force from falling too much/ (U74B Wt 22530/P 144 10,000 9.37 IOPp rzn 1 COPY XT/AW, (219 groups) DEC YPKE R OF TELEGB AM .

The previous submission is at P.Z. 7379/37. It has been agreed that the most effective action open to us with a view to counteracting the increase of Italian influence over the Afghan Air Porce is to accept the Afghan Government's request for further training facilities in India, and it will be remembered that the P.Z. 7379/37 Secretary of State telegraphed to the Government of India about this on 19th November. The Government of India appear to have been somewhat hampered in replying owing to the vagueness of the Afghan Government's proposals since in putting forward their request the latter failed / P.Z.7222/37 to specify the number of personnel which they wished to / send to India (Katodon 133 ). This information has been / P.Z.8142/37 supplied in Colonel Fraser-Tytler’s telegram of 15th December No.151 reporting that the Afghans propose to send 1C pilots, 5 observers and 15 mechanics. As a result the Government of India have now been able to telegraph (Government of India's telegram of 18th December, P.Z.8227/37) accepting the Afghan Government's proposals. It will be seen that the Government of India entirely agree with H.M.G. that it would be undesirable to make the offer of training facilities conditional on an undertaking from the Afghan Government to purchase future requirements of aircraft from British sources. They have suggested certain practical considerations which might be put to the Afghans in conveying the acceptance of their request, viz. (a) that it would be more convenient if training could take place between the beginning of May and the middle of September; (b) that the Afghan personnel should be sent in batches and that &lt;U74b Wt 22530/P 144 10,000 9.37 io p the/the number under training at any one time should be limited to 6 mechanics, 6 pilots and 6 observers; and (c) that two competent interpreters should be provided, preferably with a knowledge of aviation. It is not proposed to insist on any of the above suggestions since the Government of India are entirely in agreement with us as to the importance of meeting the Afghan Government’s wishes in view of the danger that failure to do so will result in the Afghans accepting an offer of training facilities in Italy. The Government of India’s attitude is very satisfactory. It is submitted that we should telegraph at once to H.M.Minister at Kabul instructing him to inform the Afghan Government of the Government of India’s offer and suggesting that the detailed arrangements might be worked out in direct consulta.tion between him and the Government of India. Certain further points are still outstanding. In this connection reference is invited to the record of the interdepartmental meeting which took place at tne x Foreign Office on 25th November. As mentioned in the previous Minutes, the Air Ministry have made a suggestion that a Senior British Officer might be sent to Kabul in order to strengthen the position of the party of British instructors (at present headed by a young Flight Lieutenant on the Air Force Reserve) vis-a-vis the Italian Mission which is being sent to Kabul (see para.2 of the record of the meeting on 25th November'. I do not think that we can get very much further with this suggestion until we have obtained definite information regarding the &amp; composition of the Italian party, for which we asked in our telegram of 30th November (Forminka 126 - &amp; P.Z. 7810/37)♦ Cur latest information is contained in the Government of India’s most secret telegram of 2nd x Flagged.

P.Z.823S December (P.Z.7883/37) but this has net yet been confirmed. Meanwhile the Air Ministry have been trying to find some suitable officer to send to Kabul and they hpve now suggested the name of a. retired Air Commodore who does not speak Pushtu or Persian, though x he is said to speak a certain amount of French. It seems very doubtful whether an officer of such exalted rank without any knowledge of the language would be suitable for our purpose. But if it is true that the Italian party is headed only by a 'Captain pilot”, it may not be necessary to pursue the matter any further. In view of the difficulties experienced on the last occasion in supplying the Afghans with a sufficient number of British aircraft, it has been suggested that it might help us to counteract Italian influence if we were in a position to give the Afghan Government some assurance as to our ability to fulfil their future requirements (see paras.3 and 4 of the record of the meeting). The Air Ministry have also undertaken to consider further the possibility of selling aeroplanes to the Afghans at 'Government price” which would certainly make it very much easier for the latter to pl^ce orders in a British market, (para.7 of the record of the meeting^. We have not yet had a reply from the Air Ministry on these points, but they can be separately considered at a l^ter stage. It seems desirable to make our offer of training facilities to the Afghan Government at once without further delay. A draft telegram to H.M.Minister, Kabul, is submitted.COPY OF r.Z.8227/37 Cypher telegram froxii Secretary of State for Foreign affairs to His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul, dated 24th December, 1337?

I am to suggest that, if His Majesty T s Government agree, His Majesty's Legation, Kabul, may be asked to transmit a copy to the Afghan Government. 2. The strength of the party which was trained was as follows Pilots - - - 10. Mechanics - - - 10. Observers 4. 2 .

I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Secretary to the Government of ^ sc / India.E^?ORT.m TH4 TRAINING OF AIR F(BQ£ PERSONNEL ♦ This report has been compiled under four headings : I* Instruction of Pilots, II * Instruction on Navigation^ III. Instruction of Mechanics, IV. Instruction of Observers and .Tireless Operators. Under each heading the report has been divided into two parts : (A) General training, (B) Individual progress. I. INSTRUCTION OF PILOTS . (A) General training . YJhen the course commenced little was known regarding the previous experience of the pilots, but as some said they had not flown for some time and the Hart aircraft was entirely new to all, it was decided to start from the beginning with the whole course. It was soon obvious that some pilots had done more recent flying than others and their progress at first was therefore more rapid,. Some also had forgotten a good deal of their previous training and in consequence at first their progress was slow. No attempt was made to hurry the training of the pilots so that an imposing syllabus could be shown. They were taught each practice in the air and had it explained to them on the ground, nor were they allowed to proceed with anything more advanced until all previous practices were thoroughly understood. The intention of the instructors was to build a foundation of a sound knowledge of the principles of flying. This /This intention has been realised and all pilots now understand the basic principles, and from this can now proceed with service training on return to Kabul* Without this basic knowledge the advanced training of these pilots could not be efficient and their future value to their country would be lessened# It will be understood, therefore, that the Afghan officers are not fully trained service pilots but have acquired a sufficiently sound knowledge of flying to be able to proceed with service training without being handicaoped by the necessitv for learning to fly a new type and undergo a long refresher course, which is always necessary if flying training has been curtailed for any length of time# It is quite unnecessary to enter into a detailed analysis of each pupil r s flying for the purposes of comparison. Those in flying practice have shown themselves slightly more advanced than the others but the difference is very slight and generally sneaking all pilots are much of the same standard. Sven were it possible to plane the pilots in order of merit this would be misleading at the present stage of their training as those who were slow in the initial stages may later turn out to be the better# One pilot is however, outstanding as having flown consistently well throughout the course and having worked very hard to raise himself to the l«vel of ability he has achieved. This pilot has also a light touch on the controls, his name is Abdul Hazaq Khan# About half way through the course, the instructions decided to have a forced landing competition and present a cup to the winner. The object of the competition was not to test /' (3 - 3 - test the ability of the pupils but to give them an opportunity of flying under difficult conditions* The competition was won, after a very close contest, by Abdul Razaq Khan* The instructors were well pleased with flying of the Afghan pilots for the competition showed that they had progressed very well up to this point in their training. At the beginning of the course there was a little difficulty over the question of languages. This was largely overcome by the good feeling and n cameraderie' which existed between thft instructors and the pilots. By their keenness and real efforts tn do their best, the pilots made the task of the instructors very much easier. IB) I ndividual progress . If it is required that any of the pilots on this course should later become instructors, the most suitable in ability and temperament is Abdul Razaq Khan. None of the others can be recommended at the moment but with more experience Mohammed Shirin Khan, Shah Mohamned Khan and Mohammed Juma Khan may be suitable. Of these Mohammed Juma Khan, though not so experienced as the other two, is considered to have the most suitable temperament for an instructor. The following remarks have been made by instructors on the individual pilots Mohammed Juma Khan . Has worked very hard and improved steadily throughout the course. Will be a good safe pilot and develop well if he has sufficient flying practice. d ay ah Abdul Ahmad Ilian . Was very out of practice when he arrived and also lacked confidence but he lias worked hard, shown a great deal of common sense and greatly improved. Though not by nature a skilful pilot he is now sound /■■■■Ml nC) sound and steady and has regained his confidence® Llohammed dhirin Khan * A steady pilot who has natural ability and has made good progress# Has a tendency to become over confident of which he should be careful# Abdul Khalik Khan # Is highly strung and has an excitable temperament which had made his progress slower than it might have been. He has settled down now but needs a good deal of flying practice otherwise he will lose his confidence# Fazal Ahmad Khan # His progress was slow at first but improved ranidly after flying solo# Is steady now but has occasional erratic days. hohammed dharif Khan # Has maintained steady progress and his general flying is sound# Has occasional days when his landings are not good# This is due more to lack of experience than lack of skill and with more flying practice he should be good# Abdul Razaq Khan # Showed early promise of flying well and his progress has been most satisfactory. A safe and steady pilot# Mohammed As if Khan # A pilot who has an excitable temperament which has somewhat retarded his progress but he uses his intelligence and is much improved. With a little more flying practice should be a safe and steady pilot# Abdul Mohammed Khan # Made slow progress to start with but later showed steady improvement# Is now flying quite safely and will continue to improve with practice# Shah Mohammed Khan # Has maintained good progress throughout the course and is a safe and steady pilot# His only fault is that his great physical strength causes him to be /be somewhat rough with the controls* II. INSTRUCTION ON NAVIGATION* (A) general, * VJhen the course commenced the officers appeared to have forgotten most of their previous training and this, together with the fact that the standard 01 mathematical knowledge was not high, made it necessary to commence with the elementary principles* The object of this course has been to give a sound knowledge of first principles which officers can expand by further study on return to Kabul* The navigation instructor speaking fluent French, lectures were given in that language and translated by one of the several officers who also speak French well * An attribute esrRcially useful to the Navigator is the ability to do simple calculations in his head.* Most officers need more practice in this* Officers worked well during the course and did their best to make the instructor's duties easier. All have a fair knowledge of the subjects which were taught but it must be remembered that considerably more work must be done before they can be considered proficient navigators. All pilots carried out map reading and compass flying with the instructor and also short cross-country flights with the instructor* (B) Indi vidual progress * Eilotg* ha r m ed Khan * Has worked well and has a good idea of the subjects covered but must continue to study in order to get his results more quickly and with greater accuracy.

INDIA. 1,0 SEP w' 1 WEEKLY REPORT ON TRAINING OF AFGHAN AIR FORCE PLRSOHNEL. WEEK ENDINGri 30^H JulY, 1937. m *‘* GENERAL, V ' 1—1957 J ff ‘ 1. Training has been interrupted during the past week by rough weather and unserviceability of the aerodrome due to heavy rain. This has retarded flying progress but has enabled much needed lectures on airmanship and theory of flight to be given. PILOTS. 2. For the reasons stated above it has not been possible to do as much flying as was hoped. However, as the previous knowledge of pilots in airmanship ana elementary theory of flight was negligible, the time spent on the ground resulted in instruction which was necessary to further progress in the air. '8 ■ 3. The necessity for explaining faults and giving further instruction to those pilots who cannot speak French, by means of an interpreter renders progress slow and laborious. Unfortunately the three worst pilots are all I unable to speak French. The assistance rendered by the interpreters lent by No.l Squadron, I.A.F., has been invaluable. 4. Two more pilots were sent on their first solo flights this week, making a total of six pilots who have flown solo. Of the remaining four, three are very out of flying practice, uncertain, and at times unsafe; the other one, although very out of practice, will be solo in the near future and is fairly sound, but slow to learn. 5 . ^hen the aerodrome was tafit for dual landings, the pilots were given map-reading practice in the air. This was -- 2 - 6 . A table of flying times and remarks is shown below. Also a list of lectures given by the flying and navigation instructors. OBSERVffiS. 7. All lectures on navigation were attended by the observers. These lectures were given before breakfast. After breakfast observers reported to No.31 (A.C.) Squadron who have rendered a separate report on their progress. (Attached). MECHANICS. 8 . The Afghan mechanics reported at E.R.S. a.m. 17.7.} 37. This day was spent in a conducted tour of departments connected with engine repairs. 9 . It was decided that owing to lack of interpreters it was impossible to have small and separate parties under instruction. One class comprising the whole, was foraed, being instructed by Corpl. Warren and Corpl* Loham. A Naik from the Indian Air Force served as Interpreter during the whole of the instruction classes, his knowledge of technical terms and the iSnglish and Persian language greatly assisted the B.O.R. instructors. 10. The party was instructed on the Kestrel IB5 engine in the following sequence: (i) Stripping, (ii) Viewing, (iii) Inspection, explana tion and erection of reduction gear, (iv) 'wheel case and hand starter gear, (v) Crankcase and bearings, (vi) Lubrication system, including dismantling and erection of oil pumps and relief valves, (vii) cooling system including water pumps. Special instruction was given on the cylinder blocks and camshafts including fitting liners, removal and replacement of valves and guides. The carburettor and fuel pump were stripped, explained, and erected. Super/Supercharging could only be dealt with diagraromatically. This, together with boost control, was not satisfactorily understood by the class. 11. The class erected the engine under the supervision of the B.O.R. instructors. They also carried out valve and magneto timing individually, - it was difficult to make them understand and fully appreciate the fine adjustment of magneto timing. 12. The general technical knowledge of the party and their knov&amp;edge of running faults is fairly sound. All the officers were very keen, but generally lacked the ability to grasp the more involved and essentially complicated points, which necessitated a considerable amount of time being spent on some subjects. 13. The party generally is considered competent to deal with any running fault, change a component, and carry out a top overhaul. 14. Man hours: Corpl. Warren 57i Corpl. Loham 57i Naik Mohd. Islam 47 Material. Nil. NAVIGATION. 15. Both pilots and observers attended lectures before breakfast. Pilots who flew before breakfast were given the same lecture after breakfast, and other pilots not actually flying at the time also attended. Pupils were given examples of triangles of velocities to solve in their own time, and these were corrected with them during the following day. 16. Pupils had practically no navigational knowledge whatever. Although they are fairly intelligent, none has a knowledge of even elementary mathematics. Their progress is therefore painfully slow. Although m ore tha n ten','3 - 4 - ten lectures and many examples have been given on the triangle of velocities alteration of the data still causes considerable confusion. The theory of triangles of velocities is still not understood by most. LflCTURffij . (1) Si?en by flying Ins tructors to Pilots .

On the 19th July the six Afghan officers reported to this unit for a course of instruction in Army Co-operation work* 2* They were shown round the Squadron by an officer i accompanied by the interpreter in order to give them a general impression. Latfcr on in the morning a lecture was; attempted, but the official interpreter’s knowledge of inglish was so poor that it had to be abandoned* 3. It was found that with the interpreter more progress; could be made with some demonstration in which equipment / was available* 4. Lectures were delivered on the 20th July on Artillery Observation and the Clock Code described. A general description of the H.A.D. sight and bombs was then given. They were shown the W/T and RA sets but very little % progress could be made as the interpreter only knew very simple English words. 5. On July 21st the new interpreter, Subedar AFZAL KHAN from the Baluch Regiment arrived. He has a good knowledge of English and real progress is now being made. Copious notes are being taken by the Afghan trainees so that they are only able to complete about 4-5 pages of the lecture daily. 6 . Lectures on the following subjects have now been given:- (1) The organisation and allotment of the Army Co-operation Squadron* (2) Types of Reconnaissances. (3) Liaison between the Army and Royal Air Force.

Four pilots (two per instructor) have flown before breakfast and six afterwards. First solos have been sent off before breakfast. Pilots not flying have attended lectures on navigation and observer duties with the Observers. Their standard oi navigation is higher than that of the Observers, the standard of all is very low and is aggravated in most esses by ignorance of elementary mathematics and trigonometry.

Since then they have been reporting to 31 Squadron after breakfast for lec tures in Observer duties. 5. The lectures given by F/Off. Dudgeon are the same as those given to the pilots; as their standard of navi gational and general knowledge appeara to be lower, however, they need more instruction them the pilots ond this is balanced out by the pilots missing some of the lectures when flying.

You may like to know how we are getting on with the Afghans. We have got their various courses well under way now, but a great deal of avoidable delay was caused by the complete lack of information as to how much they already knew. As I anticipated sLkxgfc also, the one interpreter provided was inadequate apart from the fact that as an interpreter he is almost useless owing to the fact that he has only a very elementary knowledge'of English. I have borrowed an English-Persi an speaking Subedar from the 4/10th Baluch Regiment and have found two I.A.F. naiks who also speak English and Persian, but the lack of interpreters at the beginning has cost us four days 1 delay. We have four pilots flying solo, but most of the others will take a long time as they are hopelessly out of practice. The navigation training is very hampered by the lack of knowledge of elementary mathematics of a large proportion of these people - for example, one pilot was found dividing 10 into 27 by long division, and we cannot hope to do any thing more than teach them the rudiments. As all lectures and demonstrations have to be interpreted, you can imagine it is a slow process. The Mess is, of course, hopelessly overcrowded. We already have 31 Squadron and the Indian Air Force above our proper establishment, and I hope you will be able to scotch the idea that all the party shall stay and go back together. We can almost certainly finish off the mechanics long before the rest, and I want to get rid of them as soon as possible. I also need the married quarter in which they are liv ing as I have two families coming back from leave very soon. I think the Afghans are quite happy. They are settling down to Mess life quite well. One has even been seen in a dinner-jacket.* We are giving you an official report on their progress every week.* —1675 . Telegram XX. No. 407, dated ( &amp; reed) 7th July, 1937.

SEEN POLITICAL COMMITTEE 29 JUL1937 Previous papers :— The Goverment of India offered, as part of the deal for the purchase by the Afghan Government of British aircraft, to train at Karachi 10 Afghan pilots, 10 mechanics, 4 observers and 2 wireless mechanics. The line taken with the Afghan Government was that no date could be fixed for the beginning of this training until the negotiations for the sale of aircraft had been concluded. This stipulation Y/as dropped early in July with our approval ? after the Afghan Government had agreed, in deference to the strong pressure which we brought to bear on them, to employ a party of 4 British instructors at a rather high figure to train the Afghan personnel on their new Hinds when/ 4136b 1000 10.35when these reach Kabul This had been the main obstacle to the conclusion of the negotiations and on its removal maintenance of our refusal to fix a date for the beginning outweighed by the danger that it might become an irritant. Moreover, as the Government of Indian arrangements at Karachi required the trai ning to be finished by the beginning of October^it was necessary, in order to permit a two months 1 course, for it to begin at an early date. The Government of India at first wished the Afghan Government to pay for the messing and accommodation arrangements of the party, but on reconsideration offered to undertake this themselves^which is satisfactory. The party which was to be accompanied by an Afghan Camp commandant and by an interpreter, was due to arrive at Karachi on 15th July. of training seemed ungracious, indeed its JWPMWQjOtt [Me s&lt;5n‘at Cc\«- SEEN POLITICAL COM MITTEBbV sx ACP/'OIA: t- c COPY SECRET • r v ^ ■ 4438 (9&lt;? groiJbs) A \9B7 3577o P iS C Y P H 3 R OP T SlTs G R A M- Prom (COPIER CIRCULATED AMD TO FOREIGN OFFICE) His Majesty^s Minister at Kabul to Government of India and repeated by former to Secretary of State for Foreign Affalro ?

Afghan Minister was informed as in the Government of India’s telegram ho. 1015 of 16th April aiid was ashed whether the Afghan Government, having considered our offer of British instructors and their approximate cost, have decided in principle to engage them. He was told that pending the receipt oi his reyjly it is impossible uo s etule the place of delivery for aviation equipment. He has replied protesting against the contract for the sale of equipment being thus made dependent upon the employment of British instructors and is referring to his Government for orders. 2. 1 suspect Minister of bluffing (as v/e now have reason to believe he was in insisting on credit for more than £45,000). He is of course misrepresenting what he was told, and it would seem desirable not to leave Afghan Government under impression that we have aimed throughout at employment of British instructors at Kabul. You have therefore discretion, subject to considerations in following paragraphs, to point out that both offer to sell aircraft and that to supply instructors arose from enquiries by Afghan Government, ,,nd that it was only when the Afghan Government objected to employment of their machines at Karachi that we stipulated for employment of British instructors at Kabul. ¥e want to secure that Afghans will in fact be able to fly and maintain our Hirds, and for this it is obvious that British training on them must be provided somewhere. 3. We have always been aware that Afghan Government might buy part of their requirements abroad (your telegram No. /1T0.76 of End September). As the Government of India know, there is now reason to believe that Afghan Government hope to buy eight Italian aeroplanes of latest model and sixteen, or failing that eight, German aeroplanes. If they make these purchases, both Italy and Germany would pr asumabiy wish to send air missions to Afghanistan to teach Afghans to fly and maintain the machines. This prospect seems to emphasise importance of our requirement chat British instructors should go to Kabul as otherwise field might be left clear for Italians and Germans. But I should be glad of your views on the risk that the presence in Kabul of instructors from rival countries, including our own, might result in friction and conflicting advice (thus embarrassing the position of the British instructors) and conceivably in opportunities for sabotage of British machines. 4. Subject to your views on this point, it seems best for the reason indicated above to make the employment of British instructors a condition of the sale of British aircraft, at any rate if Italian or German instructors are employed. I suppose that if we went further than this and suggested to the Afghan Government that if we sell any British aircraft, they should undertake not to employ German or Italian instructors in their Air porce, the Afghan Government would be likely to react badly to such a proposal as an attempted interference m their own affairs. But I should be glad of your views on this also.t \ P.Z,3010/37. SECRET .

Copy (N 3346/2/97) NO.159 AFGHANISTAN LEGATION 31, Princes Gate, S.W.7 29th April, 1937. Sir, I have the honour of acknowledging the receipt of a letter No.N 2174/2/97 dated the 27th April, 1937; and in the first instance wish to express my thanks for the consideration of the Government of India for agreeing not to retain any aircrafts for training Afghan students at Karachi, but have the delivery of all material to be made direct to Kabul. permitted to observe that in ail of my discussions, I had understood that the contract for the purchase of aircraft and material was not subject to any condition of employment of the British instructors; but the purchasing of the aforementioned items was considered as a separate objective. employing the instructors is now thought to be the first and the more important factor than the actual contract for buying of the material. Since, however, this is the decision of the Air Ministry, I have nothing to say but to inform the department concerned at Kabul of the full details, and, shall, of course, communicate to you their reply upon the receipt of it. In regard to the paragraph 3 cf your letter, I may be But your letter makes it clear that the agreement for With the assurance, etc. (Signed) Ali Mohammad. Afghan Minister.

Sir, in the course of an interview here on the 12th April you requested that the aircraft material which the Afghan Government propose to purchase in this country might be delivered direct to Kabul, instead of part of it being used at Karachi for the training of Afghan pilots and mechanics. You explained that the Afghan Government contemplated that after these students had been trained on Wapitis, Harts or Audax machines at Karachi they would be transferred to Hinds at Kabul by the British instructors who, as you have been informed, can be made available for that purpose. 2. 1 now have the honour to inform you that the Government of India have been consulted on this point and agree that all the material which the Afghan Government are purchasing here may be sent by Messrs. Hawkers direct to Kabul and should not be used for training purposes at Karachi, on the assumption that British instructors are employed at Kabul. The purpose of their original proposal was to ensure that the Afghan students would receive satisfactory training on Hind aircraft, none of which type exists in India; and this point will be met if personnel acquainted with Hinds are engaged to instruct these students at Kabul. It has been ascertained that personnel made available by Messrs. Hawkers on the lines described in the fifth paragraph of my Note N 1637/2/97 of the 25th March last would probably require remuneration on a similar scale to that necessary in the case of serving Royal Air Force personnel. An estimate of the cost to the Afghan Government of employing the latter was given in the fourth Ali Mohammad Khan, paragraph/ etc. etc. etc.paragraph of my note N 531/2/97 of the 1st February last# 3. In these circumstances, and as the engagement of British instructors would be to the great advantage of the Afghan Government, 1 hope that you will be able to inform me at a very early date whether the Afghan Government, having considered the offer made to them, and the approximate cost to them of British instructors, have decided in principle to engage such instructors, as, pending the receipt of your reply on this point, it will not be possible to settle the wording of the clause in the draft contract between Messrs. Hawkers and the Air Ministry regarding the delivery of the material. 4. m my note of the 1st February it was suggested that one instructor in signals and aerological duties together would suffice for the requirements of the Afghan Government. The Air Ministry advise me that in view of the small number of aircraft which will be at Kabul, one instructor should be able to carry out both duties; but if the Afghan Government wish to have two instructors, one for signalling and one for meteorological work, the Air Ministry will be willing to try to obtain them from among serving personnel of the Royal Air Force. 5. The Government of India are not. yet in a position to fix a date for the beginning of training at Karachi. In any case, however, on account of the arrangements which must be made, they could not receive the students before the latter half of May. I have the honour etc., (For the Secretary of State) (Sd.)

Muhammad Ihsan refuses to consider employment of his own Hinds at Karachi in training scheme, and contemplates that after training on your machines at Karachi his xulots and mechanics would be converted to Hinds at Kabul, under instructors whom Hawkers are ready to send there on payment. He points out difficulty of providing spares for Hinds or repairing them at Karachi. Afghan Minister at interview at Foreign Office on 12th April said that his Government insisted on aircraft being sent direct to Kabul otherwise Afghan people would not understand why the squadron did not arrive unused and complete. 2. I doubt whether Afghan Government will give v/ay on this point on account of propaganda considerations. Also acceptance of Muhammad Ihsan 1 s suggestion would presumably influence Afghan Government to accept offer contained in paragraph 5 of Foreign Office note of 25th March (copy by secret air mail of 29th March) which has been referred to Kabul by Afghan Minister. Moreover difficult problem might arise if Afghan machine was damaged at Karachi e.g. by British pilot. Do you agree that we should accept Afghan suggestion on assumption that British instructors are employed at Kabul? 3. Afghan Minister is anxious for training at Karachi to start as soon as possible. What date do you propose if we accept Afghan suggestion?P.Z.2176/1937. COPY (N 1748/2/97) Afghan Legation, 31, Princes Gate ^ NO.34 S.W.7 30th March, 1937 Sir, I have the honour of acknowledging the receipt of your communication No.N 1637/2/97 dated the 25th March, 1937; and beg to say in relation to the second paragraph of that letter that the Afghan Government is prepared to pay the difference between the total credit of seventy five thousand pounds offered by the Government of India and the total contract price eventually agreed upon. This sum to be paid along with the first of the six instalments due on the date on which the consignment in question is shipped from London. Further, the subject of paragraph three has been noted; and regarding the training of Afghans; would you be so good as to let me know the date of the earliest convenience c£ the Indian Government for giving such a training so that I could inform my Government for sending the Afghan mechanics and pilots for training in India. I am communicating to the department concerned about the employment of British personnel, and shall write to you when I hear from Kabul. Meantime, I await the receipt of a contract draft for approval and ultimate signature: in which, I hope that our request for speeding up the matter might kindly be kept in view. vVith the assurance of my esteem yours sincerely, (Sd.) Ali Mohammad Afghan Minister His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, London, S.W.lfa. **&lt;1(*1. FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l 25th March, 1937. No.N 1637/2/97. Sir, With reference to my note No.N 413/2/97 of the 1st February last, I have the honour to address you further on the subject of the purchase of British aircraft by the Afghan Government, in order to confirm the arrangements discussed with you at this department on the 23rd March. 2. It has been ascertained that Messrs. Hawkers would take payment for the aircraft and equipment required by the Afghan Government in two equal instalments, the second to be paid in April 1938 from the credit supplied by the Government of India. This being so, the Government of India have found it possible, in order to enable the Afghan Government to purchase a complete squadron of eight British aircraft and equipment, to make available, besides the sum of £45,000 mentioned in the second paragraph of my note under reference, a further sum of four lakhs of Indian rupees (£30,000) as a credit for the Afghan Government. I understand that, while the price quoted by Messrs. Hawkers for the material which the Afghan Government originally intended to acquire amounted to nearly £100,000 the contract at present £80,000, and that your Government are prepared to pay in cash, as part of the first instalment whatever sum is required to make up the difference between the total credit of £75,000 offered by the Government of India and the total contract price eventually agreed. I shall be grateful to receive confirmation of your acceptance of this arrangement. 3. As you were informed on the 23rd March the Government of India have only been able to offer the extra credit facilities now made available to your Government on the contemplated is not likely to amount to much more than understanding/2 understanding that it will be impossible to consider any question of further credit to the Afghan Government for the purchase of war material before April 1939 at the earliest. 4. The position as regards the training of Afghan mechanics and pilots in India remains as stated in the fourth paragraph of my note of the 5th December last, as modified by the fourth paragraph of my note of the 1st February last; that is to say, the Government of Indiajare prepared to train ten pilots and ten mechanics, since the Afghan Government have agreed to take advantage of the credit now offered to them sn d to purchase a squadron of eight aircraft and equipment in the United Kingdom. I understand that your Government wouJd like this training to begin as soon as possible. 5. With reference to my note No.N 531/2/97 of the 1st February last, 1 have the honour to inform you that Messrs. Hawkers have now stated that they could make available certain British personnel for service with the Afghan Air Force. They could provide a flying instructor, an instructor with specialised engineering qualifications and two individuals for workshop maintenance and electric work; and if the Afghan Government definitely decide to employ British personnel, the Air Council would endeavour to obtain a volunteer from among serving personnel of the Royal Air Force to act as instructor in signal and aerological duties. I trust that these arrangements will meet the requirement of the Afghan Government and I shall be glad to learn whether they desire to take advantage of them. 6. As was arranged at this department on the 23rd March, the Air Ministry will proceed immediately to draft a contract to be signed by them and Messrs. Hawkers for the purchase of the material required by the Afghan Government, and will submit it to Muhammad Ihsan Khan for his approval before signature. When/When the main lines of this contract are clear, His Majesty’s Government will at once draft an agreement to be entered into by themselves and the Government of India on the one side, and the Afghan Government on the other side, providing for the cash payment by the Afghan Government of whatever sum is necessary to make up the price of the contract beyond the amount of the credit offered by the Government of India, and for the repayment of that credit in six equal annual instalments, the first instalment of payment for each part of the order falling due on the date on which the consignment in question is shipped from London.
