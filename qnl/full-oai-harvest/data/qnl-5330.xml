An account of the incident written by Agnew is contained on folio 118.The correspondence also discusses a number of other issues including Shaikh Salim's desire for a steamer to regularly visit Ra's al Khaymah, the possibility of a geologist visiting Ra's al-Khaymah and his relations with Muscat.The file also contains a limited amount of correspondence from Yusuf bin Ahmed Kanoo, a Bahraini merchant who acted as an intermediary between the British authorities and Shaikh Sultan.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Emir of Ra's al-Khaymah Sultan bin Salim Āl Qāsimī</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author; subject</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Ras al-Khaimah</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0002de#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0002de#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0002de#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0002de#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
