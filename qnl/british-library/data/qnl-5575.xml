'^^India Office, dated 15th March 1941, Ref: PP/EtiP. ^ I would like to ask your advice on another matter which w concerns the National Anthem of Bahrein. We made some enquiries about national anthems in the Gulf last summer but were unable to find any evidence of their existence. Unite by chance a few weeks ago I was informed at Levi f s Sound Studios that Mr. Levi had orchestrated and recorded the National Anthem of Bahrein on the instructions of Mr. Dalrymple-Belgrave. The date on the recording, which I have borrowed, is 29th November, 1934. Presumably the National Anthem of Bahrein has not changed since that date, and we should like to get it recorded by the B.B.C. Military Band. I imagine a cable to Belgrave at Bahrein would be all that is necessary. Perhaps you would let me know if there is any objection to this on the part of the India Office?P.z. 5957/68. SaCRET.

With reference to Foreign and Political Department letter No.F.96-N/34, dated the 22nd March 1934 on the above subject, I have the honour to state that there appears to have been some confusion regarding the design and colour of this flag, largely no doubt owing to the fact, as reported in my predecessor’s letter No. 265-3 dated the 28th April 1932, that ideas regarding a national flag were at that time in a somewhat fluid state in Qatar. From further enquiries made from the Political Agent, Bahrain, it now appears that the Admiralty are correct in thinking that the flag of Qatar which was reproduced in the Admiralty Flag Book ’’Flags of All Nations” is incorrect. 2. The Political Agent now reports that there is only one flag flown in Qatar and that it is used both by the Shaikh and his subjects. It is a crimson flag with a serrated white strip near the staff pierced with crimson-diamonds. The word 'Qatar” in Arabic characters is inscribed in white on crimson on that half of the fly nearest to the staff. A sample of the flag has been obtained and is being forwarded with this letter together v/ith a sketch. 3. It will be observed t£iat the sketch shows the flag to the left of the staff instead of, as usual, to the right. This has been done in order not to invert the Arabic word 'Qatar”.• %(T^ 4* So much for the design of the flag. There remains the question of its colour. It will be seen that the specimen flag forwarded is not crimson, nor does it correspond with the sample of material forlwarded by the Admiralty in their letter of 8th March 1934, which formed an enclosure to India Office letter No. P.Z.1608/34 dated the 9th March 1934. The explanation lies in the fact that white cloth is purchased in Bahrain and dyed crimson with locally purchased dye. The dye is of poor quality and fades rapidly, and the flag takes on a chocolate colour. The original dye also probably varies. 5. The enclosures in original mentioned in the Admiralty letter referred to above are returned haewith.r\ ;/ N. L. 2117/34 Dear Clauson May 1 refer you to your official letter July, 1936. P.Z .546/193 6 of the 25th January, about the design of the flag of Qatar. Has the Political Resident been able to find out about this from the Sheikh? Failing information from the Sheikh it would suffice for us to have an authoritative report as to what flag is in fact being used. The Naval Authorities reported in November, 1933, that the flag shown in the Admiralty Flag Book, and used by them for official ceremonial purposes, was not correct. As they appear to attach great importance to using the correct design and say that the Arabs do likewise, would it not be possible for the Political Resident to be asked to cL*, report what the poiaiMM? flag is, without necessarily consulting the Sheikhl .'Yours sincerely, 2 0JUL1936/ Draft Paper.

The Governraent of India are in general agreement with the Political Resident’s views both with regard to the condonation of breaches of Treaty obligations relating to the flying of these flags, and as to the use of the term 'State flag', which seems to them suitable for application to the conditions of the Arab States in the Persian Gulf and is well understood in India. , , . .

B,—This is an ORIGINAL MESSAGE, sent by post to save telegraphic expense and undue use of the wires, but intended to be treated, on receipt, with the same expedition as if it had been telegraphed. To save time and formalities it is worded and signed as if it had been so despatched,] From .Resident, Bushire, To Foreign, New Delhi Repeated toi The Secretary of State for India, London, '14/132.11 Dated 2 February Foreign and lolitieal Department Express Letter No, • D.3202-N/35 dated the 26th July 1935. 2. The f irst poin t raised by the Lords Comiriis si oners of the Admiralty is whether there is any objection to changing the title of the flag at present called rt Trueial Coast Flag' at Plate 31 in 'Flags of All Nations' to 'Trucial Coast Flag No. 2 ISharjah and Ras-al-Khaimah)'. 3. This is the flag known as 'white pierced red' pres cribed in the General Treaty of 1820 to be flown by all the signatories.. W, s. MFP—1515 S&amp;P—(M-20S9)—2-4 35—200,0 00.t - 2 - signatories to the Treaty, viz., Bahrain, Ahu Bhahi, Dihai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm-al-Qaiwain and Ras-al- Khaimah. in practice it is now, and has for many years 'been, flown only hy the Rulers of Sharjah and Ras-al-Khaimah, and is now regarded exclusively as the tribal flag of the Jowasimi family. 4. 1 see no objection to this. Admiralty proposal provided their s econd point, with which I am about to deal, and on which it is dependent, is accepted according to my recommendation. 5. This proposal is that an oblong flag, the length being approximately three times the breadth, about five-sixths of the flag being red and the remaining sixth ithat nearest the mast} white, should be included in 'JTlags of All Nations 6 7 * * * 11 under the title of 'Trucial Coast Rlag No. 1 (Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Debai, Qatar and limm-al-Qaiwain}.The Admiralty say that this flag is flown by all the Trucial Sheikhs other than Sharjah and Ras-al-Khaimah. 6. This flag is in fact flown only by the Rulers of Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Debai and limm-al-Qaiwain. It is not flown by Qatar which has its own separate flag, vide 'Hags of All Nations**, Plate 118 A, and corres pondence ending with my Express Letter No. 1228/14/ 132.H dated the 26th May 1934. 7. These four Rulers should strictly speaking fly the Treaty Hag, but they have not done so for many years, and could hardly be induced to do so now, as the Treaty Hag has come to be regarded as the tribal flag of the Jowasimi family, as explained in paragraph 3 above. ISee correspondence ending with my prede cessor’s letter No. 1143 dated the 4th June 1932).(2&gt; -3 8. I see no objection to the Admiralty proposal if mention of Qatar is excluded, provided that the Government of India are prepared tacitly to condone a continuance of the hreach of the letter of the Treaty hy the Bulers of Ahu Dhahi, Ajman, Dihai and Umm-al-Qaiwain. A similar tacit condonation has already been made in the case of Bahrain which, as one of the signatories of the General Treaty of 1820, should strictly speaking also fly the Treaty Blag, hut in fact flies its own flag, vide 'Blags of All Nations' Plate 43 A, I accordingly recommend that the hreach he tacitly condoned, and the existing situation recognised, in the case of the above- mentioned four Eulers also. 9. The third -point raised hy the Admiralty is that the title of the Bahrain State Blag should he changed to the Bahrain National Blag, as the word 'State* 4 is said to imply a personal flag which is precisely the impression it is desired to avoid. 10. The word 'State' would not appear necessarily to imply a personal flag, e.g., State flags of Indian States. The word 'national' would, in my opinion, he unsuitable, and I deprecate any change in this respect. 11. The fo urth -point raised hy the Admiralty is that the two Trucial Coast flags, which it is proposed to call Nos. l and 2, should he employed, in lieu of the Muscat Ensign, when saluting the Trucial Sheikhs. I concur in this suggestion. RESIDENT. ( b)een authorised. 4/CK*CrK^UwUX.

I learn from Abdul Latif that you mentioned in a letter to him about other matters that inshallah you would comply, but that vessels of your subjects only went to Debai, Lingah and Bahrein. Now Lingah is just the place where it is most important that the Treaty Rules should be complied with, so I am obliged to trouble you again.

The Government of India observe that according to Treaty, there should be two forms, a “ Register ” and a “ Port Clearance,” but that you propose only to have one form, though that one would combine most, hut not all, of the particulars required to be shown in the two forms prescribed by Article V of the Treaty of 1820. I am, therefore, to enquire whether there are any reasons for your suggesting a course which is not strictly in harmony with Treaty provisions in that not only is one form substituted for two, but all mention is omitted of the ports of departure and destination as well as of the time of departure.

No. 52. trust that the circumstances set forth in the following paragraphs will he considered to furnish sufficient explanation of the delay which has occurred in the submission of my reply. The question of the proper articles to be used is so closely connected with that of the correct flag to be flown that I venture to deal with them in one communication. 2 While recognising from the first that it would he a matter of consider able difficulty to persuade the Trucial Chiefs either to fly the correct treaty flag or to furnish the vessels of their dependants with formal Articles in accordance with the letter of the Treaty, two considerations prompted me to endeavour towaidsthecloseof 1904. to persuade them, if only in their own interests, to adhere more closely to their engagements in the matter of ships papers. These w ore * — Firstly, the consideration that the Senior Naval Officer had drawn atten tion to the fact that none of these dhows were in the habit of carrying any ^Spcondlv the fact that the Residency was having great trouble at the time, with the Belgian Customs Administration, owing to their rigorous enforcement Gainst native dhows of the literal provisions of the new Reglement Douamer. They were inlined to resist our attempts to protect Arab dhows and to argue that such were not identifiable either by flag or papers as coming from localities entitling them to British intervention.3. A little later on (the fair season of 1904-05) during my cold weather tours I was impressed by the fact that the Trucial flag was never seen at sea, an ^ accordingly I addressed Government in my letter No. 201, dated 3rd May 1905 in that connection also. As regards the flag, when I had first discussed the subject with the Sheikhs before addressing Government, the Sheikh of Shargah replied “ ilismillah, he would be more punctilious in future especially in regard to Tamb and Abu Musa; M and with him go his son, the Sheikh of Has-el-Khaima, and the Sheikh of Ajman. The other three Sheikhs, Abu Thabi, Debai and Um-el-Kowein said that they had from time immemorial never been accustomed to fly anything but the plain red flag and did not want to change it now and argued that in any case they could not be expected to fly the same “ Jowasmi ’ flag as that flown by the Slieikh of Shargah (head of the Jowasmi). In refly to this on my next visit I took down the original treaty of 1820 prescribing the pattern of the flag, showed the Sheikhs the signatures of their ancestors and the picture of the flag and proved to them that the red and white flag was not they' Jowasmi but the Trucial flag. Cn seeing the treaty and the signatures they said “ Yes ”, “ we have nothing more to say, this is indeed binding upon us At the same time they agreed to use suitable articles. When however my back was turned they thought better of their acquiescence and, guided no doubt by the Sheikh of Abu Thabi who has always been troublesome in these matters, wrote that their subjects could not be persuaded to adopt these new flags and that if they attem- ted to press them to do so they would leave their protection and migrate. 4. In August last I directed the Residency Agent to go down to Abu Thabi and make another attempt to convert the Sheikh, but he was not successful. The Sheikh repeated the alleged disinclination of his subject to change their flag and added that if the Sultan of Maskat changed his flag then only could he and the Beni Yas follow suit. He then went off into a long ventilation of his old grievances, some real some fictitious. The references in my letter to him No. 317, dated 28th October, of which I attach a copy, will give all necessary expla nations of what passed. It will be seen that I postponed discussion of the question of flag (cum Articles) until I could discuss it with the Sheikhs in person. Unfortunately when the opportunity arrived for a visit to the coast some weeks later my time was taken up with the negociationsf for the release of the imprisoned Sheikh of Umm- el-Kowein, and I did not see the Sheikh of Abu Thabi in person. After Sheikh Rashid’s release however I did discuss the whole subject in conclave with him, and the Sheikhs of Debi and Shargah together, and asked them to tell me exactly what was in their minds, explaining that our only objects in pressing this matter was their own benefit; by-making it, easier for our representatives to help their dhows when in difficulties at foreign ports. I added that if there was too much white on the flag for their taste or if they were anxious to keep the red flag and write the name of the port across it, I would explain their wishes to Government; but that they must tell me frankly what their objections wire. They replied, firstly, that they did not realise the need for the change themselves; that their subjects objected and that they them selves could not coerce them. Debai added that whatever might be said about a common Treaty flag the red and white flag had been known to all from time immemorial specifically as the “ Jowasmi ” flag and that nothing would induce the Beni Yas to fly the same flag as the Jowasmis. As to the articles they had no objection in principle to the forms shown them or any other forms according to Treaty, but it w r as a trouble to have them made out, and they would never get their subjects to bother about taking them and therefore begged that they might be allowed to take their chance and go on as heretofore. 5. Such then is the position at the present moment. It is, I am aware, not encouraging from any point of view, neither is it satisfactory to drop the matter, but that nevertheless is the course which seems 3to me the most politic. The matter was originally mooted in their own interests when the Belgian was more rampant than he is now. If the Chiefs, unlettered Philistines that they are, cannot appreciate their own advantage, it is no fault of ours. Prom the point of view of our own interest it is certainly somewhat incon venient that the Treaty provisions should not be rigidly adhered to owing to the presence of European foreigners in the Gulf, hut w^hat I feel is that our own position generally in relation to tbese Chiefs and other Arab allies or depen dants, and the Besident’s position in particular, has been much affected and rendered difficult by the influx of the foreign element of late years ; by the vag aries of the Belgians, now fortunately much less frequent; and by the disinclina tion of His Majesty’s Government to authorise any strong line in Tehran ; so that neither does the time seem suitable nor can we really afford just now to place any unnecessary tension upon our relations with them. Por these consi derations if Government see no great objection, I would ask permission to let the matter drop or to postpone it until some more opportune moment. 6. As to the precise form of the Article to be used when addressing Govern- . ment in my letter* No. 359, dated 29th July 1905, I had the Treaty before me but was rather lead away by the action taken in the case of Koweit. The items which I included in my draft form were such as would be in a great measure permanent. I think however that it would be necessary for a Nakhoda to take also for each voyage a separate clearance ticket briefly showing the ports of departure and destination, and time of sailing as suggested in the Assistant Secretary’s letter. I must apologise for the undue length wdiich this letter has reached, but it seemed advisable that after such a lapse of time l should place the facts fully before Government. Enclo. to Pro. No. 54. Translation of letter No. 317, dated 28th October 1903, from Major T. Z. Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to Sheikh Zaeed bin Khalifah, Chief of Abu Thabi. It is more than a month ago since I received from Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif a purport of what had passed during his visit to you in the month of Eajab, in connection with the flags. I have delayed writing to you before because I thought I might be able to pay you a visit, but now I see that I cannot do so for some weeks more, and meanwhile it is necessary that I should write to you. You seem to have conversed with Abdul Latif in very heated terms, which was neither w'ise, my friend, nor becoming your greybeard and experience. I can quite understand your feeling sore about the Taona Case. I too am sore on your account, and it is for that reason that I bear with you longer than I ordinarily should. But remember that even my patience and that of Govern ment has its limits. About the Taona Case, I have left no stone unturned in order to get it settled, and we have even referred for the orders of the British Government in London for the purpose of obtaining money compensation from the Persian Government, but the difficulty is that the Persian Government is in great straits for money and is at the present moment seeking to borrow large sums. I do not lose sight of it for one week together, and I firmly believe that you will receive compensation before long, but I cannot make definite promises as the matter does not rest with me. With regard to the other 3 cases about which you consider that you have a grievance 4£ * (1) The colonisation of Zora. I am fully conversant of all the circum* stances of that case and of your reasons for wishing to get a foot ing there. There can be no other answer in regard to that matter than what you have already had ; therefore what is to be gained by your continually bringing it forward? (2) The Sambookh of bin Shaiban. This case was explained to you fully in my letter No. 252, dated 6th August 1905. The rules of the Persian Government about smuggling arms are well known. If any Nakhoda ships arms in his boat, whether his own or any- - body else’s, he cannot say that he does not know that they were there; it is his business to make sure that his boat contains nothing contraband. If he neglects to assure himself, the evil consequences are on his own head. (3) Then the case of the confiscation of barley at Kishm. When I saw you in May last, you spoke to me about that, and on my re turn I made full enquiry and sent you the result in my letter No, 138, dated 10th June 1906. namely, that the Director of Customs had released the barley and remitted the fine. Do not my letters reach you ; if so, how can you say that no justice was done ? (4) About the flag and the articles. First you see the Treaty and the signature of your ancestor Shakbat, and you say to me “Bismillah this is indeed binding on me. ,, Then a little while afterwards you say “ I have asked my subjects, they do not like the flag.’* I am not able to compel them to use it. I only asked you to fly the proper flag because your Nakhodas go about without any distinctive flag and without any articles, and the result is that they are treated badly, whereas it is clear that if they fly a treaty flag and carry pro per articles, as I showed you, they will be treated with more respect. If there is too much white on the flag or if all the Trucial Chiefs want some other change in the pattern, then I will ask Government accordingly. But this matter is chiefly of importance to you in order that your rights may be respected, and in any case will keep until I see you again. Meanwhile if your boats travel with the plain red flag and without articles and if they are oppres sed, it will be your own fault. May you be preserved and salaam.

According to the Almanack de Gotha, the Oman flag has a white border and a white inscription on a red background. According to the British flag book this is not correct. In this book an Arabic inscription is shown in the flag- of Koweit and a white-bordered red flag for the Trucial Coast. Count Bernstorff would be grateful to the Marquess of Reading if he would forward this request of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the competent British authorities, and ventures to add that the German Embassy are prepared to refund any expenses which may arise.

With reference to Admiralty Book of Flags of All Nations herewith is submitted a drawing of the Standard of the Sheikh of Bahrein. 2. His Excellency has recently drawn attention to the fact that when saluting at Bahrein H.M.Ships fly the Muscat flag and I he has requested that this practice may cease. At the same time he has provided four of his own flags one of which has been issued to each ship of the Persian Gulf Patrol. 3.
