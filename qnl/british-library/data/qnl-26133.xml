HGopy of letter Mo.C/835, dated the 19th May 1936, from The Chief Commissioner, Aden, to the Joint Secretary to the Government of India, Department of Commerce. Subject:-Administration of the Aden Lights after the separation of Aden from British India. I have the honour to refer to your letter Mo. 430-P.&amp; L.(17)/35, dated 7th May 1936 addressed to His Majesty’s Under Secretary of State for India, a copy of ♦ which has been forwarded to me. I am entirely in agreement with your proposal that, after the separation of Aden from India, the Perim Lights should be administered by the Board of Trade, and that the Board of Trade should themselves levy dues sufficient to cover the expenditure involved. I am, however, strongly of opinion that these dues should be collected not at Aden but in the same manner as is done in the case of Jebel Tier and Abu Ail Lighthouses in the Red Sea which are at present administered by the Board of Trade. In their case contributions are received from certain Governments in varying amounts based on the proportions of mercantile tonnage under their respective flags passing through the Red Sea, and the British contribution is raised by means of light dues levied on British ships at Port Said. My authority for this statement is the accompaniment to the Board of Trade, Mercantile Marine Department, letter Ho. M. 11844/35 dated 31st December 1935 addressed to the under Secretary of State for India, a copy of which was sent to me under India Office endorsement dated 6th February 1936. 2. The procedure that I recommend would, in my opinion, offer two advantages to the Board of Trade. In the first place, practically all ships that pass through the Suez Canal also pass through the Straits of Bal el Mandeb and therefore derive advantage from the Perim Lighthouses and ought to contribute to their upkeep, rhis object will be achieved by the method that I recommend, but not by the collection/collection of dues at Aden, which port is touched by only about 25 per cent of the veesel-^ that pass through the Ked Sea. Secondly, the Aden Port Trustees consider that the abolition of the collection of light dues at Aden would be so great an advantage to the Port that I am confident that in order to facilitate this step they would be prepared to forego the contribution now paid to them by the u-overnment of India towards the upkeep of the Marshag Lighthouse at Aden. The other Aden lighthouse (Elephant’s Back) is already wholly maintained by the Aden Port Trust. I submit, therefore, that my proposal would effect both an increase in receipts and a decrease in expenditure for the Board of Trade in respect of the Aden and Perim Lighthouses* 3.

It me than understood that Bis Majesty's CrOvera.ent ms of the opinion that the sinpleet arran^anont would probably be that the Board of Trade should take over these lights possibly with a contribution from the aowora- neat of India. It was also understood that the Colonial Office had undertaken to consider the question with the Board of Trade. At that tiae the jowsntesnt of India hm under consideration the possibility of constituting &amp; Statutory Body to control the lights in India and Burma after the separation of Sanaa from India* and they came to the tentative conclusion that it would probably be found most convenient to bring the austinistration of the .Aden and Peris lights as well within the purview of that authority, if and when it was constituted. There is, howevsr, now no prospect of such &amp; body being constituted and the Oovorment of India have com# to the conclusion that the beat course would be to go beck to the original idea that the Board of Trade should administer the lights in question after the separation of Men trm British India. 6. I am to say that ths expenditure involved in the maintenance of these lights, based on the figureu for ths year 1W4-3&amp;, is aa follows t*&lt; t (b) • • * • (1) Qoatributioa payable to tbe .dan port Bruat oa account of the light at m Karahag 6 t 6&amp; of the lighta at } erira Island 0) Indirect charges * IS,164 ension&amp;ry charges 762 169 Contribution to Ksaerta funds 26,661 Indirect charges on account of the coat of accounting unci csuj.it work and the share of the Kcnd^uar ter a charges of the Sevenmet of India sbich itaca snounts to fc.7,000/* approxhi&amp;vciy, hare not, hossrer, bean taken into account, as the running of tease lights will not, prescaably, coat tee Board of Brade anyteing additional.

I am to add that the Grovarnment of India consider that the rates suggested, which are the same as those at present obtaining in respect of vessels calling at Aden but not proceeding to or from a British Indian port, are ^ite fair and that no contribution need be paid by them to His Majesty 1 a Government for the maintenance of the Men and Perim lights. 9. I am also to say that, in the event of these proposals being accepted by His Majesty’s Government, the Government of India are prepared to make over in due course to the Board of Trade a proportionate share of the various Reserve Funds of the Indian General Lighthouses and Light ships Department. 10. Finally I am to say that, if the Board of Trade so desire, there would be no objection to repairs to the Men and Perim lights, if any, being carried out at the Madras Lighthouse Workshops of the Inaian General Light houses and Lightships Department and to an occasional inspection of those lights being made by a member of that Department. If either or both these arrangements would be of any material assistance to Hie Majesty’s Government, mutually satisfactory terms could doubtless be arrived at. 11.

Dear Walton, Will you please refer to Laithwaite’s letter to me P.Z.7877/33 dated 4th December 1933 enclosing copies of my letter of the 10th August 1933 on points arising in connection ?/ith the transfer of Aden, and of the minutes of the meeting at the Foreign Office at which my letter was discussed? As it has been proposed that 1 should go to England this summer to discuss details connected with the transfer with the India Office and the Colonial Office, I have prepared a note reviewing the fourteen points that were then discussed, an! adding remarks on further questions that appear to me to require consideration and decision before the transfer takes place. I enclose a copy of this note. 1 also enclose a copy of a draft estimate for Aden (as distinct from the Aden Protectorate) showing probable revenue and expenditure after its separation from India. I am sending' a copy of the note and of the draft estimate to the Colonial Office and to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. Yours sincerely, (SD.) B.R.Beilly.

At the meeting in London in 1933 the Colonial Office undertook to take up the question of future arrangements in connection with lighthouses with the Board of Trade. I do not know the result of this consulta tion, but I adhere to the view that the two lighthouses on Perim Island should be taken over and maintained by the Board of Trade, possibly with a contribution from the Governnent of India, light dues from ships on their account being collected not at Perim or Aden, but at Suez, as I understardl is already done for the upkeep of other lights maintained by the Board of Trade in the Bed Sea. The two lighthouses at Aden are at present managed by the Aden Port Trust, the Government of India paying for half the up-keep of one of them. It is possible that the Port Trust would be willing to forego this contribution from Government, and would undertake the entire upkeep of these two lights from its own funds. In that case no light dues of any kind would be collected from shipping at Aden or Perim, as the present collection of light dues at these places on behalf of the Government of India would presumably cease. This change would be welcome here, as being calculated to enhance the popularity of the Port.L etter from Colo nel Reil ly to Mr.La i thwaite . FILE CO [nington T el: Lmiin^rto n 252 10th August, 1933, D^ear Laitlwaite, n In conversation in London some weeks ago it was suggested that I should enumerate some of the points that; will require consideration if Aden is separated from India. Those that occur to me are:- included in the new Colony - two at Aden and two at Perim. The two at Aden are managed by the Aden Port Trust, but the Government of India pay for half the upkeep of one of them. The two at Perim are maintained by the Government of India, to whom lighthouse dues are paid. If Aden is separated from India the responsibility and expenditure of the Government of India will presumably be undertaken by the Imperial Government - perhaps with a contribution from the Government of India, as the lights are largely used by ships engaged in Indian trade. It would not be right to make Aden bear these charges unless it receives lighthouse dues sufficient to cover them, and the imposition of dues at Aden ought to be avoided as much as possible, as it tends to drive shipping away to the rival French and Italian ports in the neighbourhood.13 r 7 Ik o /■) i | ti . i 1 (The references in the note below.are to the points raised in Colonel Reilly’s demi-official letter of 10th August 1933). Colonel Reilly’s d.o. letter of 10th August 1933 was discussed at the India Office on 15th August. In addition to Colonel Reilly there were present Mr. Cowell of the Colonial Office, Mr. Walton and Mr. Laithwaite of the India Office. LlKhthouses . The Colonial Office undertook to t^ce up the question of the future arrangements in connection with lighthouses with the Board of Trade. The simplest arrangement would probably be that the Board of Trade should take them over, possibly with a contribution, as suggested by the Resident, from the Government of India. The Resident emphasised that from the point of view of maintaining trie attractiveness of Aden as a port, it was most important that the light dues sxiould not at any rate oe raised above the level at present charged by the Government of India. The result of any increase might well be to drive traffic to Jibouti or elsewhere.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00000e_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/1478</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00000e</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/1478</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 1/42 'Aden.
