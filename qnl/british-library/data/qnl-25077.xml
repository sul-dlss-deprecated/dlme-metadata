Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 14.) (No. 545.) Sir, Therapia, September 6, 1908. I HAVE the honour to reply to your despatch No. 347 of the 25th ultimo, in which you intimate that the recent introduction of a constitutional regime into this country seems to offer a favourable opportunity for securing the settlement of outstanding claims against the Turkish Government. With regard to the Abbott case, I have written to His Majesty’s Consul-General at Salonica, directing him to endeavour to obtain from Mr. Abbott some contribution towards the expenses incurred by His Majesty’s Government on his behalf, for the reasons given in your above-quoted and previous despatches With regard to the claim in respect of the attack on the “ Blosse Lynch,” I have the honour to draw your attention to the Confidential despatch from His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bagdad, forwarded to you in Mr. Barclay’s despatch No. 394 of the 16th July last. According to this it appears that Messrs. Lynch gained rather than lost by the recent disorders in Mesopotamia, and the question of pressing a claim was one, not for obtaining recompense, but for imposing a deterrent upon similar attacks in the future. Under the new regime, moreover, it seems that we may count much more on the good-will and probity of the Turkish authorities. Further, it must be borne in mind that the present movement is being attended by a considerable revival of national feeling, with a consequent tendency to restrict the privileged position of foreigners. Now, Messrs. Lynch’s steamers ply, under a foreign flag, in the internal waters of Turkey, which the present regime is not unlikely to view as an infringement of their sovereign rights. Moreover, the Firman upon which Messrs. Lynch’s rights are based is loosely worded, but certainly gives the right to navigate, not on the Tigris, but on the Euphrates. Under these circumstances it would seem advisable in their own interests that Messrs. Lynch should limit their claim to actual losses, which, however, according to Major Ramsay’s report, were nil, and that they should endeavour to gain the good-will of the new Government without the intervention of this Embassy. I have hopes that the general reforms which are now being gradually taken in hand for the whole country may obviate the necessity for making representations as to the security in Mesopotamia and in the vicinity of Salonica, as directed in your despatch, for I fear that at the present juncture such representations would be neither very well received nor very effectual. The remainder of the British claims against the Turkish Government are described on pp. 5, 6, and 7 of the Annual Report. Satisfactory progress is, on the whole, being made with No. 3 (Red Sea piracy claim). I will not fail to take the earliest convenient opportunity for presenting the remaining outstanding claims, including that for the refund of the excess duty levied on dates at the Katif Customs, to the Turkish Government, but it must be borne in mind that they are at present in the greatest straits for money to furnish the most necessary payments, such as salaries and arrears, a loan being offered them at this very moment only upon arduous terms.

C ' 7410) nir:- Tha recent Introduction of conotitutionfd Govern- mm% into the Ottomn Empire appears to offer a favour able opportunity to secure the settlement of tho va rious outstanding claims against the Buhline Porte. It would therefore be advisable to prepare a list of T ritish claims and hold them in readiness for a favourable opportunity of discussing them with the Turkish Government, diieh Your* Excellency will use your discretion in selecting. With regard to the Abbott Case, Your Excellency will see from the accompanying copy of the reply which I have received, from tha Treasury with reference to Mr. Barclay’s Despatch No. 313 of the 6th. of June that the Lords Commissioners concur in the view that the claim need bo no further pressed apa inst the Ottoman Govern ment but consider it should be urged on Mr. Abbott, senior. Is Excellency Sir 0. Lowther, K.C.M-G., C.B.,senior. Your Excellency should accordingly cull upon that gentleman to sorae contribution towards the expenses incurred on his behalf. Your Excellency should inform the Turkish Govern- roent that His r./fcajesty's Government would have found difficulty in foregoing the balance of the ransom had not a change of Govern unt occurred at Constantinople: for they are convinced that the present Government will take measures to ameliorate the insecurity prevailing at Balonica and thus rent or the occurrence of such inci dents impossible. You should also remind them that His Majesty 1 *^ late Minister has urged the removal of Mias&amp;i Bey, the Director of Police. I consulted Hit Majesty 1 s Consul at Basra now on leave of absence v/ith respect to the feasibility of de manding the despatch of a Military Expedition for the punishment of the Arab Chief Gadban for his recent at tack on the Euphrates and Tigris Bteam Navigation Com pany’s Steamer “Blosse Lynch* and the propriety of put ting forward a claim against the Ottoman Government onI £100 £ 40 £ 20 the Company's behalf on this account, (see v r. Barclay*b despatch o. 3 4 .;4 of July 16th.) I enclose copy of r. Crow's reply to my enquiry. In view of all the circumstances of the case, I consider that the claim should be limited to the actual damage caused to the steamers, a sum estimated by Mr. Crow at One hundred Pounds, to the cost of tele- » grams exchanged by the Company and their Agents, Forty , Pounds; ana to a solatium for the injured fireman of Twenty Pounds; or One hundred and sixty Pounds in all. In presenting this claim for payment Your Excel lency should point out to the Cublime Porte that, under the former regime His Majesty's Government would have been obliged to make a larger one as the only way of bringing home to the Turkish Government the necessity of {affording protection to British Subjects and vessels, you should call attention to the state of affairs in the part of the country where that incident happened and ask that measures my be taken to prevent a recur- rer co of such outrages and that, if possible. Gadban may be punished.I enclose copy of a letter from the India Office respecting the treatment of British Indian traders at K1 Katif and have to request that Your Excellency will include in the list of claims the payment of the sum of Two thousand eight hundred and twenty-one Rupees which the Sublime ^orte admitted to he due in August 1905 and which tha utussarif was instructed to re cover (see Sir T . O’Conor’s despatch to Mia Crow of , 2Bth. August of that year). With regard to the second point m-ntioned in the despatch of the Government of India I should be glad to he favoured with Your Excellency’s opinion as to what action might usefully taken in the matter. Your Excellency should use the concession which His Hujoety’s Government are making in regard to the Abbott and Blouse Bynch claims, as an argument in favour of settling this and any other claims which you w.,y include in the list for presentation to the Turkish frovermiant, hut as 1 have indicated above, I leave the time7 S &gt; tirtia for approaching the Porte entirely to Yovr Excel- loncy’e discretion.

We have the honour to refer to Mr. Brodrick’s Secret despatch No. 61, dated the 23rd December 1904, regarding British Indian commercial interests at Katif, and to enclose a copy of further correspondence on the subject. 2. In the despatch cited it was intimated that orders had been issued by the Turkish Government to the Mutessarif of El Hassa forbidding, for the future, the levy by the Katif Customs farmer of the excess duty on dates shipped by British Indian traders, and directing the recovery of the amounts levied in excess in the past. It was anticipated that, if practical effect were given to these orders, it would be unnecessary to press for the appointment of a Consular Agent at Katif, a measure which had been recom- * Despatch No. 74 (Secret-Extemai), dated the mended* by Lord Curzon’s Adminis- 3ist March 1904 . tration, and the Government of India were asked to report whether the orders proved effective. 3. As regards the levy of excess Customs duty, it will be observedf that the orders issued in 1904 have been evaded, t Enclosure No. 4. Q us t oms + farmers at Katif have in no way relaxed their opposition to the British Indian traders doing business in that district, the export trade of which is almost entirely in the hands of two merchants who are determined to keep § Enclosure No. 4. traders out of Katif. §In 1905, 1906 and 1907 the Hindus were altogether prohibited from dealing with the growers in Katif, and were compelled to purchase dates only from these two merchants at “ delivered on board rates This resulted in a loss to them of about Rs. 20 per 100 Katif maunds. 4. The position as regards the recovery of the sums levied in excess is clearly explained in a letter, || dated the II Enclosure of enclosure No. 1. 16th November 1907, from the Political Agent, Bahrein, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The total of excess duty levied is now reported to be T Enclosure No. i. Rs ^187-4-7 as compared with Rs. 2,8211- quoted by Mr. Gaskin in September 1904, and communicated to the Porte at the time. No refund of the illegal exactions has been made, and it seems desirable that the Turkish Government should again be addressed on the subject. In order to avoid the introduction of a new element of discussion we would confine the claim to the sum (Rs. 2,821) originally quoted.4 5. The present may not be an appropriate time to press for the arrange ments which we originally suggested, but Tour Lordship will observe that the Turkish authorities have failed entirely to do justice in the case and we trust that a strong representation may be made to the Turkish Government in the interests of the Indian traders.

Captain Prideaux’s present communication explains the position clearly. It will be seen, in the first place, from the figures given in State ment A accompanying his letter, that the total amount of excess duty levied now works out to Rs. 3,187 as compared with the Rs. 2,821 quoted by Mr. Gaskin in September 1904 and communicated to the Porte at the time by Bis Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. It will also be noted that for 19,748 Katif maunds shipped to Karachi, representing excess duty amounting approximately to Rs. 1,017, certificates of import granted by the Karachi Customs have been duly produced before the Political Agent at Bahrein; but that in respect of 61.890 maunds consigned to Kathiawar ports, especially Mandvi and Verawal, the claimants express their inability to obtain certificates from the Administration of the Native States concerned. It is true that certificates endorsed by a Turkish Consular official are ot forthcoming, but on the other hand, the statements of Tekchand and five at of the other ten Hindus concerned have been recorded on oatffi and as leir original claims have been corroborated in regard to the Karachi shipments y the Karachi Customs, they seem entitled to credence in respect ot the rest, 'urthermore, His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople^ in the despatch • • marodnallv cited, of which I enclose a Dated 28th August 1905, to His Britannic ° , i j.r^ Tri«w that the Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, from whom a copy Copy, has expressed t &gt; „ , . , as received. production of certificates ot a lurKisn lonsular Officer “ is now immaterial to our case as the Acting Vali °f Basrah .as admitted the justice of the claims by instructing the Mutessant ot hi lassa to recover the money.” In these circumstances, there seems no reason why we should not finally iress for the refund of the Rs. 3,187 now shown to have been il ega y ev ^&gt; mless perhaps it be considered more convenient in order not t 011 } ro uca i tew element of discussion, to adhere to the amount, Es, ^ ^ U0 o the Turkish authorities. This if recovered might be divided rateabiy. 3. As regards the last paragraph of the Secretary of State s d^patc fo. 61, dated the 23rd December 1904., I have the honour to state tha th Political Agent, Bahrein, informs me that up to date C Tn ),°“ it Katif have in no way relaxed their opposition to the Bntis i p t loing business in that district in spite of the orders of t e u ‘ Llie export trade of Katif is practically entirely in the ban s o farmer Sdansur bin Juma Pasha and Ali bin Paras. The la 18 . , an( j )f the Customs for some twelve years past. There is i Customs mmity between these two Katif merchants^ and w enever p • ’armers are in favour with the constantly changing ^ vern0 ], s Mansur bin ind districts, they are as ready to levy illegal rates °f y 1 and Ali bin fuma as from every other trader. At the same time bo ^ ^ Katif Faras are both at one in their determination to keep the unia ot i ier i oca i and as every successive Kaimakam makes friends with one or2 magnate, Hindus will ne^er receive fair play until the power of these two persons is reduced. If the Porte could only be induced to realise that a greater revenue would be obtainable from the date gardens as soon as growers are permitted to sell tueir stocks to the highest bidders in an open market, the present unsatisfactory state of affairs would be speedily ended. Under the present system, however, by which the tax is levied per tree irrespective of produce, the prosperity of the cultivators is a minor consideration and the periodical bleeding of the two monopolist buyers is perhaps considered an easier method of collecting revenue. ” 4. It will be remembered that the question of the seeming need for British Consular representation at Katif was raised in connection with the unfair treatment of our nationals in the instance now under correspondence but was not at the time pursued. The fact that the British India Steam Navigation Company have just set apart one of their vessels, the S.S. Megna^ for a regular run, with Basrah as her heal-quarters, between Katif, Ojair, and Basrah, with an occasional call at Bahrein, seems to afford fresh grounds for the further consideratmn of this measure ; but it is clear that neither the appointment to ivatir uself of a Native Agent, such as we employ at Lingah, nor the endow- ment of the Political Agent at Bahrein with Consular powers in regard to Katif, would be of any practical advantage unless the overt support which His Majesty s Government felt prepared to give him were sufficient to reattract tie Hindu traders, who, before the establishment of the Turkish Customs ouse and the disabilities resulting to themselves therefrom, were able to carry on a lucrative trade of some magnitude with the port, f . ^ 0S f % however ’ Majesty’s Government may consider that the enter tainment of the proposal has been rendered less inconvenient, as well as more mportant, m the two years which have elapsed since it was first put forward.

I would venture to mention that besides the amount of duty given in the statement, an extra fee of Bs. 3 per 800 Katif maunds was paid by Tekchand Dwarkadas for weighment and clerical attendance.

With reference to Mr. Townley’s confidential despatch of September 10th 1904, and to Acting Consul-General Monahan’s reply No. 57 of the 21st of October of the same year, I transmit to you, herewith, copy of a Notice which 1 have received from the Sublime Porte in to them by His Majesty’s Embassy on the British Indian traders by the Katif Sublime Porte’s Notice, No. 62358, dated 24th August 1905. answer to the representations made the subject of the treatment of Customs. The Prememoria from the British Embassy referred to in the Sublime Porte’s “Notice ” did not state, as the wording of the note would appear to imply, that the Bs. 25,000 was the specific total of the sums due to British Indian traders for excess of import duty paid on deposit to the local Customs, but that it was calculated that in the year lu03 that amount had been extorted from British Indian traders under this head. The Prememoria also said that in 1899, after a prolonged correspondence, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf had only succeeded in obtaining a refund of Rs. 5,012 out of a sum of Rs. 15,000 claimed by British Indian subjects who had appealed to him. The sum of Rs. 2,821 cited in the enclosed communication from the Sublime Porte as being the amount claimed by the Indian merchants them selves would appear to tally with the total of the claims the particulars of which were obtained in September 1904 by the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein and formed the first enclosure in Mr Monahan’s above-mentioned despatch. You will observe that Mr. Monahan reported that the Acting Vali had assured him that he had instructed the Mutessarif of El Hassa to recover these sums and to abstain from levying such charges in the future. You will observe that the Sublime Porte state that the reason why these claims have not been paid is that the Indian traders have not yet presented to the Custom House the properly legalised certificates of Ottoman Consuls in India proving that the goods exported were really delivered at an Indian destination. I consider that the production of these certificates is now im material in our ease as the Acting Yali of Basrah has admitted the justice of the claims by instructing the Mutessarif of El Hassa to recover the money, and the question is merely raised by the Ottoman Government as a pretext for further delaying payment. It would, however, be advisable to ascertain from the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein whether the Indian traders have furnished these certifi cates to the Katif Customs when applying for the refund of the excess duty deposited by them, or, in the event of their not having done so, then to advise them to fulfil this formality, if possible, in order to facilitate the return of monies unduly levied.

From—M ajor P. Z. Cox, C.I.E,, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—S. H. Butler, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary |to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. With reference to the correspondence ending with my telegram No. 143, dated 19th February 1908, on the subject of the levy of excess duties from British Indian Traders at Katif, I have the honour to forward herewith, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a letter which I have received Politic*! Agent, Bahrein, letter No. 139, dated from the Political Agent, Bahrein, on the 7 th March 1908 subject. 2. Captain Prideaux estimates that British Indian Traders have been put to a loss of about Rs. 20 per 100 Katif maunds of dates through being forced to purchase dates at “ D. O. B.” rates from the two wholesale dealers, Mansur bin Juma Pasha and Ali bin Faras, and that owing to this interference with the legi timate course of trade, British Indian traders have incurred a loss of some Rs. 30,000 during the last year. It will thus be seen that the orders of the Wali of Basrah to the Mutessarif of Hasa have been evaded, and I am of opinion that this state of affairs will continue until we are in a better position to press our claim locally in Katif. Under present conditions in Hasa any orders of the Sublime Porte or of the Wali of Basrah which are distasteful to the local authorities remain a dead-letter. No. 139 , dated Bahrein, the 7 th March 1908 . From— Captain F. B. Prideaux, Political Agent, Bahrein, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your office endorsement No. 657, dated the 25th February 1908, in which a report is called for as to whether the Katif Customs farmers have ever levied excess duty from British Indian traders on exported dates since the prohibitory orders were issued to the Mutesarrif of Hasa by the Vali of Basrah in September 1904. 2. In reply I beg to state, that as explained in my letters Nos. 324 and 410, dated, respectively, the 20th September 1905 and 4th November 1905, the Hindus were altogether prohibited in 1905 from dealing with the growers in Katif and were compelled to purchase dates only from the two largest wholesale merchants in Katif at “ delivered on board ” rates. In 1906 and 1907 the same procedure was enforced, which the Hindus estimate as causing them a loss of about Rs. 20 per 100 Kataf maunds of dates! 3. The details of the above estimate are as follows:— Price of dates ashore, average Hammali (cooly) charges Weighing charges Bag sewing charges Godown and lighter charges Customs duty at 1 per cent Rs. A. per 100 maunds no o &gt;1 » » 5 0 1 ) »&gt; 0 4 H &gt;* t ) 0 4 » » n 3 0 » tt &gt;» 1 2 Total ... 119 10 Against the foregoing, the Hindus have paid an average rate of Rs. 140 per 100 maunds. The quantity of dates purchased in this fashion is estimated at 150,000 maunds for last year, the greater portion of the trade having been done by boats which proceeded direct from Indian ports to Katif and did not touch at Bahrein either coming or going.

From— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Besident in the Persian Gulf, To The Secretary to the Government o£ India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to submit the further report promised in my letter No. 464, dated 28th September 1905, to Political Agent to Resident, No. 564, dated YOUr address, OU the Sllbiect of excess loth November 1907. % .• t r -r» •x* i t i- , i duties levied Irom British Indian traders at Katif. I regret that owing to the difficulty experienced in procuring the atten dance at Bahrein, with their account hooks, of the parties interested, several of whom have terminated their trading connection with Katif, it has not been possible forme to address Government until now. 2 . Captain Prideaux’s present communication explains the position clearly. It will be seen, in the first place, from the figures given in State ment A accompanying his letter, that the total amount of excess duty levied now works out to Bs. 3,157 as compared with the Rs. 2,821 quoted by Mr. Gaskin in September 1904 and communicated to the Porte at the time by flis Aiajesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. It will also be noted that for 19,748 Katif maunds shipped to Karachi, representing excess duty amountinsr approximately to Ks. 1,017, certificates of import granted by the Karachi Customs have been duly produced before the Political Agent at Bahrein ; but that in respect of 61890 maunds consigned to Kathiawar ports, especially Mandvi and Yerawal, the claimants express their inability to obtain certificates from the Administration of the Native States concerned. It is true that certificates endorsed by a Turkish Consular official are not forthcoming, but on the other hand, the statements of Tekchand and five out of the other ten Hindus concerned have been recorded on oath, and as their original claims have been corroborated in regard to the Karachi shipments by the Karachi Customs, they seem entitled to credence in respect or the rest. Furthermore, His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople in the despatch -n t j ocj. 1 . k l mn- ti- m. • marginally cited, of which I enclose a Dated 28th August 190o, to His Britannic ixiai-giixiixy Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, from whom a copy COpV, has expressed tue V16W tliat tile was received. production of certificates of a Turkish Consular Officer “ is now immaterial to our case as the Acting Vali of Basrah has admitted the justice of the claims by instructing the Mutessarif of El Hassa to recover the money.” In these circumstances, there seems no reason why we should not finally press for the refund of the Rs. 3,187 now shown to have been illegally levied, unless perhaps it be considered more convenient in order not to introduce any new element of discussion, to adhere to the amount, Rs. 2,821, originally quoted to the Turkish authorities. This if recovered might be divided rateably. 3. As regards the last paragraph of the Secretary of State’s despatch No. 61, dated the 23rd December 1904, I have the honour to state that the Political Agent, Bahrein, informs me that up to date : “ the Customs farmers at Katif have in no way relaxed their opposition to the British Indian traders doing business in that district in spite of the orders of the Sublime Porte. The export trade of Katif is practical y entirely in the hands of two merchants, Mansur bin Juma Pasha and Ali bin Paras. The latter has been farmer of the Customs for some twelve years past. There is bitter rivalry and enmity between these two Katif merchants, and whenever the Customs farmers are in favour with the constantly changing Governors of the Province and districts, they are as ready to levy illegal rates of duty from Mansur bin Juma as from every other trader. At the same time both Mansur and All bin Paras are both at one in their determination to keep the Buniahs out of Katif, and as every successive Kaimakam makes friends with one or the other local2 magnate, Hindus will never receive fair play until the power of these two persons is reduced. If the Porte could only be induced to realise that a greater revenue would be obtainable from tbe date gardens as soon as growers are permitted to sell tiieir stocks to the highest bidders in an open market, the present unsatisfactory state of affairs would be speedily ended. Under the present system, however, by which the ta* is levied per tree irrespective of produce, the prosperity of the cultivators is a minor consideration and the periodical bleeding of the two monopolist buyers is perhaps considered an easier method of collecting revenue. ” 4. It will be remembered that the question of tbe seeming need for British Consular representation at Katif was raised in connection with the unfair treatment of our nationals in the instance now under correspondence but was not at the time pursued. The fact that the British India Steam Navigation Company have just set apart one of their vessels, the S.S. Megna, for a regular run, with Basrah as her heal-quarters, between Katif, Ojair, and Basrah, with an occasional call at Bahrein, seems to afford fresh grounds for the further consideration of this measure ; but it is clear that neither the appointment to Katif itself of a Native Agent, such as we employ at Lingah, nor the endow ment of the Political Agent at Bahrein with Consular powers in regard to Ivatif, would be of any practical advantage unless the overt support which His Majesty’s Government felt prepared to give him were sufficient to reattract the Hindu traders, who, before the establishment of the Turkish Customs House and the disabilities resulting to themselves therefrom, were able to carry on a lucrative trade of some magnitude witli the port, . Possibly, however, His Majesty’s Government may consider that the enter tainment of the proposal has been rendered less inconvenient, as well as more important, in the two years which have elapsed since it was first put forward.

With reference to correspondence ending with my letter No. 219 , dated the 5 th July 1905 , on the subject of British Indian commercial interests at Katif, I have the honour to report that the Bahrein representatives of four of the firms who claim a refund of Customs dues paid in excess to the Customs Farmers of Katif, are now in Bahrein, but that the most important witness and claimant, Tikchand Dawarkadas, has not yet arrived. This man has been written to by the other merchants concerned at least four times to hasten his return to Bahrein, and Messrs. Gungaram Tikamdas’ agent has informed me to-day that Tikchand has promised to come here by the steamer due on the 22 nd instant. 2 . Without the sworn statement of Tikchand Dawarkadas and an inspec tion of his^ account-books there is absolutely no case worthy of presentation to the Turkish Government, for the only proofs which the other firms can offer are in support of the fact that they paid certain sums in 1903 , on account of Customs duties to their common agent Tikchand. It is possible that Tikchand may be able to produce witnesses also to corroborate portions of his evidence, but I find that the representative of Messrs. Perrnanand Vasandmal who told me that Tikchand held the Customs Farmers’ receipts was mistaken, and that the statement on this subject contained in the fourth paragraph of Mr. Gaskin’s letter No. 88 , dated the 9 th April 1904 , is correct. 3 . This year the Hindus have arranged to buy a considerable quantity of boiled dates from, the Customs Farmers of Katif delivered on board their boats. jBy this arrangement the Duty question has been evaded, but the largest share in the profits of the trade has naturally gone to the Custom’s Farmer;; middlemen at the expense of the gardeners and the Hindu exporters. 4 . As the present Farmers are the same firm as in 1903 , I took two of the Bunniahs with me to Katif on H. M.

GOVERNMENT OF INDIA* FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. EXTERNAL. To The Right Hoh’ble St. JOHN BRODRICK, Mis Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 21st April 1904. Sir, We have the honour to address you regarding the affairs of Bahrein and the arrangements for British representation at Manama. The situation is peculiar. The protection of the British Government has converted the island from a scene of chronic external aggression and intestine feud into a peaceful and flourishing centre of industry and commerce. We have not only secured the stability of the present Chief’s rule, but, at the Sheikh s entreaty and with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, we have recognised h s son Hamed, as his heir, and have thus practically guaranteed the succession on Sheikh Isa’s death. Yet we have never declared a formal piotectorate we have demanded no tribute; and we have abstained from interference i domestic affairs, except at the Sheikh’s request, ^cure in the gratuitous enjoyment of the benefits thus conferred upon him, tUe . fo the past vicissitudes of the Khalifa family and the independence to which his ancestors submitted at the ^f bl House and of the Imam of Maskat during the period fA' our intervention: while our moderation seems to have induced the belief the Chief’s mind that his relations with the British Government are of a kind that involve no corresponding obligations on his own par 2 The incorrectness of the Sheikh’s attitude has been conspicuously ine mcorrec nuestion of his Customs revenues. His noticeable in connection with the quesin i r; U otoms Majesty’s Government are aware of the existing sys ^ tbe i nc0 me are farmed to British Indian Banias, and o e n ^ „ our Political which is obtained under this arrangement. So .ba c k as 1898 ™ Po “ Resident in the Persian Gulf broached the subject wi h toChiet, who gave Colonel Meade to Anders an^ without first communicating which had then r bout foul teen montns 5 . liaT10 p 0 p « -nroposal with the Resident. Later in the sa 1 m ® isite ^ Ba i ire i n w ith the object approved by your predecessor, c «l°nel - « to manage his Customs, of inducing the Sheikh to receive f l [ ease had in the meanwhile Despite the previous understanding, ^iow ’ ars and n0 ac ti 0 n was taken been extended for a f ” th y, b Iead e o£ y hi s disapproval of the Sheikh’s beyond an ex P ressl0a b y. t + olo “v e l ^ op though still indisposed to revise his bad faith. Three months later ^ l k n ’ ofc to ° nter into any fr e S h agreement Customs arrangements, again pro 03 withou t first informing on the expiry ot the c’^l Meade reported that the Sheikh the Resident. B . u * '“ U u[ s y eno . aCTemen ts, and had prolonged the lease had again departed from his e iou3 intimation. A remons-( 2 1901, at the instance of Sir Nicolas O’Conor, it was again suggested that he should employ a British subject to supervise his Customs, he once more declined to accede to the wishes of His Majesty’s Government. In November of the same year, the Sheikh appeared to become more amenable, and declared his intention of assuming the direct management of his Customs on the expiry of the lease then current. Within a fortnight, however, he had renewed the contract for a further period of two years. No further action was taken until, during his recent tour in the Persian Gulf, His Excellency the Viceroy spoke seriously about the matter to the Chief, and pointed out to him the necessity of a change in the existing arrangements. The Sheikh asked for time to consider the matter with his brother and sons; and the Resident was accord ingly instructed to report further after renewed consultation with the Sheikh. In his letter of the 18th February 1904, of which we enclose a copy, Colonel Kemball has recounted the failure of his further endeavours with Sheikh Isa, who steadily declines to revise the arrangements under which his revenues are at present collected. 3 . The need for reform is clearly indicated by the figures given in Colonel Kemball’s letter. The Chief’s present income from his Customs is Rs. 1,16,200, while the revenue which may be expected under an efficient system is estimated at Rs. 3,50,000. The practicability of the change is proved by the example of Maskat where, in partial compliance with our wishes, the Sultan has taken the Customs administration under direct management, and has already reaped considerable benefit from the arrangement. The matter is obviously one to which we cannot remain indifferent. Committed, as we are, to the support of Sheikh Hamed, it is incumbent on us to take measures to ensure that, on his accession, he may find his house in order, and may not be burdened with a heavy legacy of debt accumulated by the improvidence of his predecessor. For this reason we consider that the question is not one which can be allowed to drop, even if it were possible to overlook the Sheikh’s repeated breaches of faith and his persistently contumacious attitude with regard to it. In fact, the reform of the Customs administration of Bahrein has become a test case of the nature and degree of the influence which the British Government may reasonably claim to exercise over the ruler of those islands. 4 . To coerce the Sheikh would be a simple matter. He possesses no troops or ships, and the towns of Manama and Muharrak, where the Sheikh himself resides, are completely open to attack from the sea. But the adop tion of forcible measures would be liable to arouse unnecessary suspicion and alarm as to our intentions in the Gulf; and we prefer, therefore, to effect our object by means which, if slower, may, we trust, be not less effective. During the Viceroy’s recent visit to the island, His Excellency was impressed with the fact that our Assistant Political Resident at Manama does not carry that weight with the Sheikh which should be expected in the representative of the British Government. That Mr. Gaskin was not entirely suited for the post has been recognised from the outset; we think that Lord George Hamilton was right when he expressed the opinion in 1901 that the appointment was one which should be held by an officer of superior status; and we propose, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, to select an officer of the graded list of our Political Department to take the place of Mr. Gaskin, for whom we hope to be able to provide elsewhere. To emphasise the change we would send a small guard of native infantry as a permanent escort to our new Agent. It has been recognised as desirable that a gun-boat should visit the island frequently during the pearling season to check the piracies which then occur. During the present year it can probably be arranged that the gun-boat shall make a more prolonged stay at Bahrein. It will also be necessary to provide the Assistant Political Agent with a boat of some descrip tion, so that he can at intervals visit Katif and the outlying portions of his charge, and this boat could, perhaps, be utilised for the suppression of piratical outrages in the shallower waters which a British gun-boat cannot reach. In this way we think that the difficult question which has been raised, of allowing the Sheikh to arm and equip a dhow for this purpose, might be satisfactorily met, while an additional proof of our title to police the pearl banks would be secured.5 . The Sheikh will probably not be slow to recognise the significance of the action which we suggest, and we anticipate that it will not be Ion 0, before a suitable officer is able to secure a proper influence over the Sheikh and to find an opportunity of bringing pressure to bear on him in connection with the Customs question or any other matter. ^Apart from affairs of domestic interest, the need for a more definite assertion of our position has recently come into greater prominence owing to the establishment of a German trader on the island, and by reason of ^ the growing interest in this quarter displayed by foreigners of other nationalities. We also contem plate that the officer posted at Bahrein should be invested with Vice- Consular powers for‘the Turkish district of El Hassa, and should be charged with the superintendence of our commercial interests at Katif regarding which we have recently addressed you in a separate despatch. We have the honour to be, Sie, Your most obedient, humble servants, (Signed) CURZON. » E. P.-G. LAW. E. R. ELLES. 0 A. T.

We should leave no doubt in their mind upon this point.

Sir, We have the honour to forward, for your information, copies of the correspondence noted in the schedule annexed, regarding our commercial interests at Katif. Prior to the Ottoman occupation of El Hassa, a flourishing settle ment of Indian traders carried on business at this port. In 1871 the place became the head-quarters of a Turkish Kaimmakam; a Customs House was instituted; and official regulations have since been so used, or rather abused, as to destroy the British trade which had previously been established. An export duty of 1 per cent has practically been converted into one of 8 per cent bv the demand that a deposit of this amount should be made on the value of all dates exported. This exaction was ostensibly intended to prevent the diversion of cargo to the Persian coast, exports to which were previously chargeable with a duty calculated at that rate. Every possible difficulty appears, however, to have been placed in the way of obtaining a refund even on proof of the goods having reached a British destination. Remonstrances have from time to time been lodged with the responsible Turkish officials. In 1899 Colonel Meade, our Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reported that, as the result of a protracted correspondence, the refund had been procured of a sum of Rs. 5,012-9-0, out of a total amounting appar ently to some Rs. 15,000, which certain traders had been required to deposit in accordance with the practice which we have noticed. But the abuse has not been checked. 2. Other complaints which have been received have charged the local officials with deliberately hampering Indian traders by delays in Custom-house formalities, by prohibition of the supply of transport, and by the use of quarantine regulations as a pretext for the detention ot Indian craft which had been clear of infected ports for periods entitling them to exemption from restraint even under the most rigid sanitary rules. In 1900 Colonel Meade s successor forwarded correspondence which showed that the bama community at Katif had been reduced from one of 70 or 80 persons to a single trader, and that a party of those who were still desirous of carrying on business at the port had furnished the clearest evidence of the harassment to which they had been subiected by expressing their willingness to pay in advance the cost of maintaining a British Agent to protect their interests on the spot. In view of Se antagonism with the Turks into which we had been brought m other parts of the Gulf, we deemed it inadvisable at the time to propose an attempt to obtain the recognition by the Porte of a British representative at Katit His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, however, brought the complaints which had beenmade to the notice of the Wali of Basrah, who undertook to issue instructions to the Kaimmakam to remove the disabilities under which British traders laboured. Later reports show that these representations have been ineffectual. In 1903 we were informed that our traders still found difficulty in obtaining - /% -i • L J 'Un-m-i **^r*r\n f 1 xr ill onpQ 1 rl n ncs ow* o-4-^l 1 refunds of deposits, and we have recently heard that illegal dues are still exacted in spite of the exemption of exports to Persia from the duty which previously formed the pretext for such demands. The majority of the sufferers sailed straight for their destination as soon as they had cleared their cargoes, and precise figures are not, therefore, available, hut it is stated that a sum of about Rs. 25,000 was wrongfully extorted from British traders in respect of dates shipped during the season of 1903. During the Viceroy’s recent tour in the Persian Gulf the British Indian merchants of Bahrein renewed, in a petition to His Excellency, their request for the appointment of a British representative to protect their interests at Katif. 3 . We think that a good case has been made out for such a step, the simplest form of which would probably he to appoint our Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein Vice-Consul for El Hassa, and to station a native Consular Agent at Katif. Should His Majesty’s Government be unwilling to take f? action on this sense, we can only suggest that a clear statement should be made to the Porte of the disabilities to which our traders have been subjected in order that measures may he taken for their mitigation or removal. But our experience of Turkish official action in those parts does not lead us to place any confidence in the results of such a representation. We have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servants, ^ Letter, da tember _ eures, 'ill Lette: (ii) Lett Septem Letter 1 the 8tl enclosu i) Letti 13th J In) Tra 1 Letter the with i i) Let the 2i (ii) Tr datec (hi) ] the Addr eml Lett; lot encLis t of Enclosures in Secret Despatch No. 74 (External), dated the 31st March W04, from the Govern Serial No. r^j d tourij Britisl tep, ment of India in the Foreign Department, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India.

I hear that the Kaimmakam of Katif is a good sort of person, but I am afraid writ ing to him will not have much effect unless explicit orders are sent him by the Wali of Basrah through the Mutasarif of A1 Hassa, and I think it would be well to have a personal interview with him and point out everything clearlv. The banias are prepared to place a boat at my disposal for the trip, and I would pay my own expenses, so that it would cost Government nothing, and as it would be useful to see the place I would ask whether I may undertake the trip. If this proposal meets with your approval, I think it would be well to have a passport vised by the Turkish Consul at Bushire, to identify me if I should be questioned. The passport might be made out in general terms not showing where I am going, otherwise the Turkish Consul might say he cannot vise a passport for Katif. Should he charge a fee for it, I would gladly pay the sum. Should I go, 1 think it would be well also to take a present for the Kaimmakam, say a gold watch and chain, or else a Mauser pistol: the former, however, would be more appreciated by an official like the Kaimmakam, who is a civilian.

I send you copy of a letter addressed to me by Mr. Gaskin, my Assistant at Bahrein, and I shall be much obliged if you will consider the question raised by him and favour me with your views. I do not approve of Mr. Gaskin’s suggestion that he should visit Katif. The interests of the banias concerned are not, in my opinion, sufficiently important that we should undergo the risk of having our action misunderstood or misconstrued by the Turks. Neither do I think the appointment of a native agent feasible. It seems, however, somewhat hard on these banias that they should be prevented from trading at Katif, and perhaps a word from you to the Wali of Basrah might put matters straight. One would think that it would be to the lurk sown interests to encourage the trade of the place. Dated Basrah, the 1st September 1900 (Confidential). From—H. S.

Either the mer chants will ignore them, or if the Kaimmakam attempts to obey the Governor- General’s orders they will find means of procuring his recall and getting some one more pliable in his place. The only real way in which any permanent good might be done is that recommended through Gaskin by the banias themselves, though I doubt very- much, as you do, whether at this juncture the appointment of a native agent is feasible. This is a matter, however, which I should like to submit to the Ambassador, and if you see no objection I would propose to forward to him copies of your correspondence with myself and Gaskin, not with a view ot suggesting or recommending the appointment, but merely as a question ot general interest for His Excellency. What do you say? Please excuse the haste in which this letter is written as the mail which only came in yesterday goes out again to-day in a couple of hours time.No. 3-S.

I have the honour to submit for the information of the Government of India copy of a letter with enclosure ad- No 117 , dated 13th June 1903. dressed to me by the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein on the subject of the re-opening of trade relations with Katie by the Banias of Bahrein. It will he remembered that some demi-official correspondence^ has already taken place on this subject, and I beg to invite a reference to this correspond ence ending w 7 ith my demi-official letter to Major Daly, dated 23rd May lyO . I do not put much faith in the professions of the Mutassarif of Al Hasa, and I doubt if he has the power to support the Banias against the oppression ot their Mahomedan rivals at Katif. However this may be, I see no objection to the Banias re-opening trade relations at Katif at their own risk, and I am instructing Mr. Gaskin to this effect. I am also requesting him to supply me with such information as he can re o ‘ardin cr the trade of Katif and the nature of the former operations of the Hindu traders at that place, and I am also asking him to furnish, if he can more detailed information regarding the disabilities under which the foimei Hindu traders at Katif suffered and which led to their withdrawal Irom -he place.

I also suggested to them that before making any definite arrangement in the matter of sending agents to settle there they had better despatch a responsible member of their com munity to interview the Mutassarif and satisfy himself as to his good faith and his arrangements regarding them. The Hindus expressed their gratitude for the steps taken in their interests and are sending Tekchand Dwarkadas on their behalf to Katif. I am giving Tekchand a letter of introduction to His Excellency and it is hoped that his deputation will meet with satisfactory results. Khamis Effendi has taken much trouble in the matter, and as an encourage ment for future efforts, I would like to repay him for his services in a suitable manner.

Translation of a letter, dated 9th June 1909, from His Excellency Seyi/id Talib Pasha, Matas- sarif of El Hassa, to the Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein. After compliments ,—Khamis Effendi has explained matters according to V our wishes that some of the Hindu merchants from Bahrein desire to come to Katif for the purpose of trading in boiled dates. Let it be known to you that under the shadow of our Lord, the Commander of the Faithful, the gates of justice and liberty are open to him who takes shelter therein {i.e., Katif) and there is no objection to traders. They have the option and liberty to trade wherever they may desire. For the purpose of information and to prove conti nual friendship this letter has been written. No. 17-S.

I fear that there is little doubt that, even if the Hindu traders at Bahrein do succeed in re-opening trade relations with Katif, it will not be long before difficulties will be placed in their way. The facts set forth by Mr. Gaskin are, I believe, mainly correct and in my opinion give us a fair case for requiring the establishment of a Consular officer at Katif to look after the interests of the Hindu traders. 3 3. Whether it would be possible for the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein to be given Vice-Consular rank for Katif, I do not know, but this would, it seems to me, be a solution of the difficulty. As Vice-Consul for Katif he would be under the orders of the Consul at Bussorah, so far as his work at Katif is concerned. He would probably not require to visit Katif very frequently. Another solution of the difficulty would be for a native Consular Agent to be appointed at Katif. Our Consul at Bussorah might be able to secure the services of a native of Turkish Arabia wffio could suitably fill the post. Even if the Turkish Government did object to our demand for Consular representation at Katif, it is in my opinion as well that it should be made, as it may result in the better treatment of our traders at Katif.wmmmmu No. 160, dated Bahrein, the 25th July 1903. Yrom J. C. Gaskin, Esq., Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, To—The First Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In continuation of my letter No. 117, dated the 13th June 1903, I have the honour to forward a translation of a letter I have received from His Excellency Seyyid Talib Pasha, Mutassarif of El Hassi, in reply to a letter of introduction I gave to Tekchand Dwarkadas. The Mutassarif has sent a letter to be delivered by Tekchand to the Act ing Kaimmakam when he again goes to Katif. The duty payable according to treaty by British subjects on exports from Turkish territory to places in the British Empire is 1 per cent., and with a view to prevent fraud the full duty of 8 percent, is usually charged, and on the production of a certificate endorsed bv a Turkish Consular Officer residing at the port of destination a rebate ol 7* per cent, is refunded. So long as the rebate is promptly paid there can be no obiection to this system, but past experience has shown that the farmers of the Katif Customs are reluctant to pay up the rebate without pressure being brought to bear upon them by the Turks. The Hindu traders to get over the difficulty made private arrangements with the Customs farmers subse- nuentlv to‘pay from 1J per cent, to 6 per cent, on the goods exported by them. ‘ It is to be seen what measures the Mutassarif will take to remove this pernicious practice of overcharging. I understand from Mahomed bm Abdul Wahab Pasha that in respect to the respectable Hindu traders only the 1 pei cent, duty will be levied and the rebate system dispensed with m their favour. Some well-to-do Hindus in Bahrein and Karachi have appointed Tekchand Hwarkadas to go to Katif on their behalf and Messrs. Gangaram Tikamdas also sending an agent there and they will go at about the end of the month when the boiled dates will be ready for export. I have instructed the Banias to see that the duty question is put on a satisfactory basis before they purchase any dates The Banias will report to me what is arranged, and on receipt of their communication 1 will submit a further report.

No. 2-B., dated Busbire, tbe 2nd August 1903. From _J. O. Gaskin, Esq., Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, qi 0 The First Assistant to tbe Political Resident, Peisian Gulf. T We the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 622, dated I have the nonour i ^ ^ Hindu trader8 o{ Bahrein re-opening the 16 th July 1«03. on the J following information which I have heen^ableTo c 0 ^!®^ ^ e ^ ar ^i°S c °™ oial 0 P erati ° nS and the disahalities under which they suffered thei . ^I am given to understand that business relations with Katif were first established in the year 1864 by a wealthy Kutchi, named Kalungi, who carried on a general trade for twelve years on his own behalf as well as other Hindu trading houses. In 1866 another enterprising Hindu named Telandas Khub- chand with a staff of six assistants established a house of business, and two years later he took a partner named Sandal bin Kisu into the business. This firm appears to have carried on a large trade till 1876 when it had to with draw from Katif owing to the incurrence of heavy losses through the bank ruptcy of many of their leading native clients brought about by the total failure of the Indian pearl market. The large firm of Assanmul ^nadrara &amp; Co. opened a branch office at Katif also in 1866 and continued to do busi ness there for about 18 years, first under the agency of Mulchand Jairandas and latterly under that of Sandal bin Kisu. Messrs. Gangaram Tikamdas &amp; Co. in 1880 sent three brothers named Tarachand, Darsingh, and Tekchand jDwarka|ias to conduct business for them, and another capitalist named Damanmal Lalchand established himself there till his death three years later. The former firm, however, kept up its trade there till 1895 when Tekchand w r as mutilated by the notorious pirate Ahmed bin Selman on the high sea. Besides the big firms mentioned, a number of petty Hindu traders visited Katif periodically and at one time I am told they numbered about sixty persons. I have been unable to ascertain definitely the aggregate amount of capital employed by the Hindu firms in the Katif trade, but at one time it must have been considerable owing to the fact that, prior to the Turkish occupation of the port and for a few years subsequent to that event, they controlled the greater portion of the trade which was principally in rice, cotton goods, sugar, &amp; coffee, spices, metals, and hardware imported from India via Bahrein,°and pearls dates and hides exported to the same country. I am informed by the Hindus to the effect that during the five years ending in 1895 their trade with Katif, when about a third of the former number of traders of their community shared m it, the value of the merchandise bought and sold by them was between seven and eight lacs of rupees annually, and judging from these fioures I think that the volume of trade carried on by them when their prospects were better may be considered to have been about fifteen lacs of rupees annuallv without risks of over-estimation. J The causes which led to the withdrawal of the Hindus from Katif date from about three or four years after the establishment of a Turkish Customs House m the port with a system of farming the revenues, which obtains to the present day. The farmers of the Customs to meet the exactions of the iuikish officials gradually and illegally increased the duty from 1 per cent to 6 per cent, on the Hindus merchandise, which placed them at a t'reat advantage m competing with the more fortunate native traders whose local influence obtained for them better treatment.

No figures of the volume of the present trade of Katif are available, but persons who have knowledge of that port estimate it to be between thirty- five lacs of rupees and is capable of much expansion when the surrounding districts become more settled. I am of opinion that the Mutassarif’s present acquiescence in the Hindus re- openin 0, trade relations with Katif is only of a temporary nature and to attract purchasers for the large date crops, which, since the expulsion of the Hindus, have been mostly bought up by Haji Mansur bin Jima, who is compelled to be absent from Katif owing to the recent action taken against him and tne seizure of his estates by the Mutassarif, and which otherwise will find no sale and cause a loss of revenue. The trade along the whole of the Arabian Coast may be said to have been created and is maintained by the extraordinary energy and enterprise _ot the Hindu merchants, and if they are to beep their hold on the trade they will have to be given adequate support and protection, which can only he done, as far as Katif is concerned, by appointing a Consular Officer who can look after their interest on the spot. 1To His Excellency the Eight Hon’ble George Nathaniel Baron Curzon of Kedleston, M.A., P.C., G.M.S.I., G.M.I.E., Viceroy and Governor-General of India. Mat it please Your Excellency, We the undersigned British Indian Merchants, residing at Bahrein, have •\ pleasure in taking advantage of Your Lordship’s visit to these Pearl Islands of the Gulf, to extend to you a most hearty welcome in the name of our com munity. We hope you have had a pleasant passage on your way up the Gulf, that your short stay here will be agreeable to Your Lordship, and that your return voyage will he acoomplished in safety and comfort. We consider ourselves especially fortunate in having this opportunity of meeting Your Excellency, as the Gulf was never honoured with a visit from a Viceroy of India, and as we know that Your Lordship takes keen interest in questions affecting the Persian Gulf and the East in general, we sincerely hope and trust that this visit will be an harbinger of prosperity, felicity and peace in the Gulf. We beg to acknowledge the manifold blessings we have derived from the just and kind British rule. May it be known to Your Lordship that we came up to the Persian Gulf about two hundred years ago, when no steamers visited the Gulf, and all business had to be done by means of sailing boats under very trying and disadvantageous circumstances. But now the times are changed and British protection has brought with it its usual blessings peace, safety, and prosperity—which reflect great credit on the British enterprise and civili zation in the Gulf. , , _ ^ , We have no desire on this occasion to trespass unduly on Your Lxceiiency s precious time, but humbly venture to lay before you one or two questions of vital importance and considerable interest to Bahrein trade.^ This port is naturally placed in a very favourable situation for trade and is a commercial centre for A1 Hassa, Ojaar, Katif, Katr, and their hinterlands; and to accelerate the trade of this port a pier at Manama is absolutely necessary to enable lighters to ply at all times and tides to give the steamers a speedy despatch. We most respectfully beg to put this want before your kmc In 1864 we opened trade relations with Katif and did large business ther.. We generally command respect and enjoy some prestige in the Gui , bu through misgovernment at Katif, we were not only ignored but we sus amea heavy losses and were exposed to insults. In 1895 one of us was attacked by pirates, and his right hand was severed and pearls worth Its. 40,000 were plundered from him. Our unprotected condition placed us at a great dis advantage there, and we had finally to retire from Katif. Since Ba irem enjoyed unexceptional tranquillity and great advantages tor trade, both Arab and Persian traders have come and settled down here. The keen ^ m P e 1 lon now prevailing here, has made it necessary for us to seek new fiel s, an we are anxious to share in the growing trade of Katif and Katr, and pray Your Excellency to appoint officers at those unrepresented ports, or it it be impracti cable to extend the authority of the Bahrein Political Agency over them. In conclusion, we offer our prayers to the Almighty to bless and prolong the life Of His Most Gracious Majesty the King-Emperor, under whose benign rule we are able to live here in peace and contentment, and we sincerely wish Your Lordship a happy sojourn, prosperous career, and long lire. We have the honour to be, Your Excellency, Your most obedient Servants, On behalf of our Community, VERSIMAL EHELIARAM. GANGARAM TIKAMUAS &amp; CO. LAKHMIDAS THAVERDAS &amp; CO.

I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with my letter No. 17-S.A., dated the 22nd August 1903, on the subject of trade with Katif. 2. It has been abundantly proved that our traders, who did business at ^ Katif this year, have not been subjected to fair treatment at the hands of the Turkish Customs authorities. Tekchand Dwarkadas, referred to in Mr. Gaskin’s letter No. 160, which formed an enclosure to my letter No. 17-S.A., dated the 22 nd August last, has informed Assistant Political Agent that the Customs farmer at Katif demanded a duty of 12 per cent, on the dates exported from Katif. In the case of dates taken to British Indian ports a refund of 11 per cent, would be made on the production within 91 days of a certificate from a Turkish Consular officer that the dates had been duly landed in a British Indian port. In the case of dates exported to Cutch ports the full ^ 12 per cent, duty would be levied and no rebate made. I made a reference to the British Consul at Basrah in the matter, and I have been informed hy him that under the Commercial Agreement between Turkey and Persia of the 5th September last, the 12 per cent, export duty on goods destined for Persia was abolished, and that there is therefore no longer any reason for claiming the deposit in the case of goods sent to India and elsewhere. Mr. Crow was unable to understand on what grounds the Customs authorities at Katif continue to demand it. 3 . I have the honour now to forward, for the information of the Govern- &lt; No. 243, dated 14th September 1903. I 1 ' 1 ' 3 ’ 3 C( W « f ‘J 16 J 38 * ^ * received by me from the Assistant Poli tical Agent at Bahrein on the subject. I am of opinion that little good will result from attempting to obtain a refund from the Turkish Customs Parmer of the overcharges made, but it is clear that, if it is decided to appoint a Consular representative at Katif, a good case has been made out for such a step. No. 242, dated the 14th November 1903. Prom—Mr. J. C. Gaskin, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, To— Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your office endorsement No. 936, dated the 9th November 1903, forwarding copy of a communication from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, on the subject of the complaints against the farmer of the Customs at Katif. I would venture to state that the farmer of the Customs has merely followed the system in vogue prior to the new treaty of 5th September last, and if he had known the terms of the Commercial Treaty quoted, they would have in no way induced him to modify his course of action. His whole action throughout was premeditated to coerce our traders into paying more than he is entitled to receive. I am informed by Tekchand Dwarkadas who went to Katif on behalf of the Bania traders that the latter were obliged to consent to paying a rate which worked out at 3 per cent, and pass a bond to that effect before they were allowed to export the dates, and that had they not done so, the farmer of the Customs would have caused them to deposit 12 per cent, for shipments to Karachi and to pay the full 12 per cent, on those to Cutch ports. The farmer refused to pass receipts for the amount of duty received by him. Many of the traders went direct from Katif to India with their dates, it would therefore be difficult to ascertain now the precise amount of the over charge ; but I believe it to be in the neighbourhood of Bs. 25,000. If the overcharge can be recovered, it will have a salutary effect on all concerned. Should it, however, be found impracticable some proper arrangement ought to be made with the Turks by which our traders can hope to receive fair treatment in the future.1904.
