India Office , J. G. L. 10th January 1930. I.—Arguments for and against KOWEIT. Express Message No. 293 S. of 1929 from the Hon. Lieut.-Col. C. G. J. Barrett, C.S.I. r C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla. Your telegram No. 2243 C. of the 17th July 1929.Transfer of Residency * Not printed. headquarters to Kuwait. Arguments for:— 1. Brings Resident definitely on Arab side, and in close personal touch with Gulf Arabs and their special problems. 2. Location of Residency will enhance the prestige of Kuwait and will support Kuwait independence against aggression of Iraq and Najd. 3. Resident will be brought into closer touch with the High Commissioner for Iraq and with Arab politics. 4. Resident will be in closer touch with the Navy, who now definitely avoid Persian ports as much as possible owing to Persian attitude. He will also be in touch with the Royal Air Force, which tinds it difficult to visit Bushire owing to Persian regulations. 5. Harbour is probably best in Gulf. 6. Motor-cars have brought Kuwait within four hours of Basrah and its sea and air communications. In favourable weather Baghdad could be reached by- air in three and a half hours. 7. Kuwait offers excellent harbour for flying boats, which will in future become more and more useful as means of rapid transportation for inspection visits of short duration. 8. Resident will be freed from Persian bureaucratic control and at his own headquarters will assume position of high British representative instead of mere Consul-General. 9. Taken throughout the year best climate in the Gulf. Of the above, 1 and 7 apply with greater force in favour of Bahrain, while 8 could apply to both. Arguments against:— (а) Climate, though best in Gulf, is very bad in summer, and Resident would have to recess for three months each year. (б) Residency would have to be built as no suitable building available. (c) Complete lack of society. Although there is a handful of American missionaries there are no Europeans in Kuwait. {d) Bin Sand's policy has killed trade of Kuwait and few conveniences are procurable in its bazaars, which are much worse than those of Bahrain. (e) No facilities for recreation. (/) No conveniences such as electric power and ice. These are available in Bahrain and Bushire. (g) Lack of water. This is brought in dhows from the Euphrates. (h) Depressing scenery owing to sand and absence of trees. In this respect it is much worse than Bushire or Bahrain. 4234 25 3.30 Ar I (i) Although natural harbour is probably best in Gulf, it is undeveloped, and embarkation and disembarkation from steamers involve considerable difficulty at low tide. (?) Present sea communication, which is by slow Gulf mail calling weekly on journey to Basrah, but only fortnightly on journey from Basrah, is unsatisfactory. The unpunctuality of this service is the cause of endless complaint. {k) Situation at extreme northern limit of Resident's charge makes headquarters unnecessarily far from India and from Muscat and the Trucial Coast, which requires more of the Resident's personal attention than it has received in the past. (I) Lack of security owing to liability to raids from desert. (m) Absence of wireless and ease with which land line can be cut by raiders. Of these defects the following can be remedied : — (6) by building suitable Residency on suitable site which is available ; (d) by coming to an understanding with Bin Saud. This would probably be facilitated by transfer of Residency to Kuwait as this should kill Bin Sand's hope of forcing Shaikh to submit to absorption by Najd State; (e) by making tennis courts and playing fields for staff and clerks who would accompany Resident; if) Government would presumably supply Resident and his staff with these necessities in tlie climate of the Gulf ; (g) Government might consider question of condensing plant; (?') building of a Residency pier would meet this drawback ; (j) arrangements could probably be made for fast mail to call weekly. Owing to proximity of Basrah, this, though great convenience which would make move popular with inhabitants, is not such a vital necessity as it would be in the case of Bahrain ; (l) although raids have been conducted up to walls of Kuwait no attempt has been made to attack the town. I he 1 Residency would be safer than the Sabzabad Residency in time of tribal trouble. Shaikh of Kuwait, who looks upon himself as bone between the two clogs Iraq and Bin Sand, would welcome location of Residency in his territory as he would consider anticipates move it as Government guarantee to preserve his independence. He would settle his quarrel with Bin Saud and bring increased trade. ^ 0 P ll ^ 0ri the greatest objection to Kuwait is its isolation at one extremitv of e Gull and the consequent difficulty of keeping adequate touch with Oman Close liaison with Consular authorities in Khuzistan would be possible, but the move will decrease toucn with the Persian coast south of Bushire. p- J- B arrett, Lieut.-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

Political. ^ m aLtifet. k (1) The location of the Residency at Kuwait will enhance the preptige of the Principality, showing that His Majesty's Government intend to support the inde pendence of Kuwait against both Iraq and Ibn Saud, whose policy is to acquire it as it is the natural port of northern Najd. Owing to the constant corning and going ol' Najd Bedouin to and from the town, Kuwait is in closer touch witli Najd politics than Bahrain, whose insular position renders it more unapproachable for the desert dweller. (2) Kuwait's proximity to Iraq facilitates relations with the High Com missioner for Iraq and joint discussion of Arab problems. In Kuwait the Resident would also be in close touch with the situation in Najd and in proximity to the Royal Air Force, on whom he has to lely for the defence of the town. This is a distinct advantage in times of stress though of much less value in normal times. I have myself found it difficult recently to control affairs from Bushire, and have twice visited Kuwait for consultations. (3) Close liaison with British authorities in Khuzistan, but decrease of touch with Persian coast south of Bushire. (1) On the other hand, although the interest of His Majesty's Government at Bahrain is already clearly shown, it will be absolutely necessary for His Majesty's Government to be represented by an official of the highest rank in the Gulf if American oil interests obtain a footing in the Gulf and are possessed of the powers granted to the Eastern and General Syndicate in their Concession of 1925. {'2) Bahrain attracts at intervals all the rulers of the Gulf, who come either to receive hospitality from the rich Shaikhs of Bahrain or to receive medical attention at its famous American hospital, which is better known and closer to their homes than that of Kuwait. The presence of these rulers affords opportunities for the establishment and maintenance by the Political Resident of personal relations with them. I lay great stress on the accessibility of the Resident, who should know the Shaikhs personally. It is for this reason that I recommend frequent tours by him along the Trucial Coast and to Muscat. This is one of the chief reasons for preferring Bahrain to Kuwait. (3) Owing to their visits to Bahrain, maintenance of touch with Shaikhs of Persian coast south of Bushire, which is mainly peopled by men of Arab blood. 2. Commercial. Kuwait is a large Bedouin town and the natural port of northern Najd. Bahrain is the commercial capital of the Gulf and the centre of the pearl trade, on which the Arabs of the Gulf live. It is the entrepot for llasa and southern 3. Situation. Kuwait is at the extreme northern end Bahrain is in the centre of the Gulf, of the Gulf, at one extremity of the which saves 24 hours' steaming when Resident's charge. visiting the Trucial Coast and Oman. (See 1 above.) C. J. forrdi n i-- n Serretan o raurte^ JUL# 4. Communications. (I) Owing to the proximity of Basrah, communication with the outer world by sea, air, and motor-car is easier than at Bahrain, but it' the Residency were in Kuwait the fast Gulf mail should call weekly both on the inward and outward vovage. (I) Visits by the fast Gulf mail both on the inward and outward voyage would be essential if the Residency were in Bahrain until the perfection of the Air Mail rendered this unnecessary.K uwait. B ahrain. (2) Telegraphic communication, how- (2) Hahrain has the best flying boat ever, is only by a single land line to harbour in the Gulf, more protected than Basrah, which is liable to be cut at any that atKuwait. Its aerodrome has probahlv time by raiders. a better surface than that at Kuwait and is secure from hostile attack, whereas that 9 at Kuwait, which is outside the town wall is more open to attack. With the development of air communi cation, Bahrain and not Kuwait will be the Gulf centre of airways. The present superiority of Kuwait in the matter of communications with the outside world will then vanish. (3) Telegraphic communication, through the Indo-European Telegraph Department Wireless Telegraph Station, is less liable to wilful interruption. If the Wireless lelegraph Station at Bushire is handed over, Bahrain can work Basrah direct, bu t the danger of jamming and atmos pherics has to be considered. 5. CLimate. Provided a really suitable Residency is built the climate is preferable to that of Bahrain. C. Accommodation. House rent for the staff would probably be a little cheaper than that at Bahrain. No temporary accommodation available for ilie Resident. As at Kuwait, a permanent building would have to be erected, but Shaikh Hamad would probably lease or sell temporary quarters for the Residency. Drinking water is brought by boat from Fao. ^ ell watei lor washing, &amp;c., is scarce and very brackish, and consequently no gardens are possible. Water Siippltj. 1 he water of Bahrain is not drunk by Europeans although the American missionaries use it. It is probably whole some, but it has a bad taste. Ample water for washing and gardening'. ^ o o (l) t No European society, a few Ameiican missionaries, a conservative type of Arab. (-) Except foi a small power plant possessed by the Shaikh and another worked by the American missionaries for their own use, there is no electric power plant nor ice factory in Kuwait. (3) Depressing scenery owing to the absence of trees or verdure. (4) No roads, nor can they be constructed owing to the loose, sandy na'ture of the soil, though it is possible for motor -cars to pass over certain areas. (5) European stores and similar con veniences not available locally. (Gj No facilities for recreation. 8. Amenities.

Article 4 of the Convention of 1861 between the Sheikh of Bahrein and the British Government provides that ' all offences which they (Brkish subjects) may commit, or which may be committed against them, shall be reserved for the decisions of the British Resident, provided the British Agent located at Bahrein shall fail to adjust them satisfactorily.' Jurisdiction in Cases affectingf Foreigners. 2. By the Agreement oE 22nd December 1880 and the Exclusive Agreement of 13th March 1892, the Sheikh bound himself not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with any Governments other than His Majesty's Government; not to allow the Agents of such Governments to reside within his territory without the assent of His Majesty's Government; and not to alienate, mortgage, or give for occupation any part of his territories save to His Majesty's Government. Responsibility for the protection of foreigners in Bahrein may be regarded as having passed to His Majesty's Government as a corollary to these two Agreements. But the question of jurisdiction does not appear to have arisen in an active form until 1900. In December of that year the Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, reported that a German subject, Mr. Wonckhaus, intended to open a branch of his business in Bahrein. The Political Resident suggested that, in the event of any mercantile or other cases arising between Bahreini subjects and Mr. Wonckhaus or his agent, the Assistant Political Agent should be instructed to deal with such cases as if they were cases between British subjects and subjects of the Sheikh. 3. The Government of India informed the Political Resident in reply that ' Mr. Wonckhaus being a foreigner and not a protected person, the Assistant Political Agent cannot claim any jurisdiction in such cases. Mr. Wonckhaus and his agent, if a foreigner and not a native Indian subject of His Majesty, must be regarded as liable in such cases to the jurisdiction of the Sheikh. ' As, however, the Sheikh is bound, under treaty, not to admit the consular agencies of other nations without the consent of the British Government, it is expedient that the British representative should, as a matter of courtesy, extend his good offices to European foreigners in any disputes between them and the Chief of Bahrein or his subjects, and, in the event of necessity, he should claim to protect all such foreigners as he would a British subject. I am to request that Mr. Gaskin may be instructed to this effect.' The action taken by the Government of India was subsequently approved by His Majesty's Government. 4. In June 1903, the question having arisen of the purchase by Mr. Wonckhaus of certain premises in Bahrein which he had hitherto held on a temporary lease, the Government of India instructed the Political Resident as follows ;—' In view ... of the belief which Mr. Wonckhaus is reported to hold that, in the event of his acquiring property, he will not be amenable to local law, but will be. subject to the extra-territorial jurisdiction of Courts of his own country (though there are none such with local jurisdiction in Bahrein), the Government of India approve your proposal to warn the Sheikh of Bahrein that no such acquisition can give to any Consul or other representative of a foreign nation the right to enter into direct relations with the Chief, and that, should any such official address the Chief, he should be referred to the British authorities. The position should also be clearly explained to Mr. Wonckhaus.' 4371 75 3.30 Lr. d. 4 May 1901, No. 708 E.A., end. in G. of I. Desp. 72 y of 9 May 1901 P. 614/01.

Ihe boieign Office at a later stacre instructed the Charge d'Affaires at Berlin that, should representations be^made to him in the matter by the German Government, he should state that it had been brought to the notice of llis Majesty s Government, and that a British ship would be sent to Bahrein in order that an inquiry might be instituted. The German Government do not appear to have taken any action. The German Consul at Basra subsequently thanked the Political Resident 'for your efficient help to the German firm, which, I trust, settles the case.' G. In the second case (November 1904), an accidental quarrel having arisen between a retainer of the Sheikh's nephew and a Persian, attacks were made upon Persian subjects in Bahrein. Apprehensive that the Sheikh would endeavour to deal with the case in the local Courts, they telegraphed for support to the Shah, and conversations took place between His Majesty's Minister and the Mushir-ud-Dowleh, as the result of which the latter telegraphed to the Persian community urging them to keep calm, as ' 5 1 have had a long talk with the British Minister . . . and I am sure he will take early steps to get the affairs settled and the culprit punished.' The Sheikh, however, adopted an uncompromising attitude on ihe question of jurisdiction, maintaining that he would not admit any interference ' in cases between Arabs and Persians, who were all Mohammedans,' and that they must go before the local Shara Courts, which, composed as they were of Sunnis, were unlikely to do justice lo the Shiah Persians. Argument proving unavailing, an ultimatum was presented to Mis Excellency, lie accepted the demands of His Majesty's Government, and though no specific reference to the point was made in the ultimatum, the jurisdiction of the Political Agent appears thenceforth to have been definitely established, as a a matter of practice, in respect of British and foreign subjects in Bahrein. i. Correspondence took place between 11)08 and 1911 in regard to the preparation of an Order in Council to confer jurisdiction over British subjects and foreigners in the Islands on the Political Agent at Bahrein. It was decided that it was desirable to obtain a formal request from the Sheikh that he should be relieved of jurisdiction over foreigners. After discussion with the Political Agent, His Excellency addressed the latter on K'th duly 1909, in the following terms ;—' Alter compliments. It is not hidden fiom .&gt;ou that I have had considerable trouble in many cases (that arose) in my territory in which foreigners were involved. For this reason I wish that I may not be held responsible in these cases, and I would be grateful to British Government if they remove this trouble and responsibility from me. I mean that it (the British Government) should exeicise .authority m all cases in which the foreigners onlv are concerned but not in other cases ; and in cases that occur between foreigners and my subjects, it is necessary that you and 1 should settle them jointlv.' 8. Ihe Pohtical Resident remarked, with reference to the reservation contained in the concluding sentence of the Sheikh's letter, 'As its effect is simply that such cases will be disposed of by the joint Court, and gives foreigners the same treatment that British subjects now receive there seems no need for exception to be taken to it ' -mno' Sh - lkh s^^uently represented that his letter of IGth Julv 190J, giving jurisdiction over foreigners to the British Government was intended only to cover subjects of recognised Powers and not the dependents ox petty Arab potentates in Gulf, with some of whom he claimsto Lave special arrangements providing for reciprocal acceptance of each other's direct jurisdiction. I informed him that if he could produce Vice { r g 7 ' f s te j' agreements, and if the other parties, on being referred to, acknowledged 0 f e their validity, I thought we should be prepared to recognise them . . peating tel. from In the light of the protest in question, the wording of the Draft Order in p ol 2632 8 /i2. Council was amended to its present form, under which (Article 8 of the Order in Council of 191.3) the power conferred by the Order extends ' to the persons and matters following in so far as by Treaty, grant, usage, sufferance, or other lawful means. His Majesty has jurisdiction in relation to such persons, matters, and things, that is to say ;— (1) British subjects as herein defined within the limits of this Order. (2) Foreigners with respect to i oho in the Sheikh of Bahrein has agreed with His Majesty for, or consented to, the exercise of jurisdiction hy His Majesty. (3) Bahrein subjects registered in the Political Agency as being in the regular service of British subjects or foreigners; with the proviso that all cases wherein such Bahrein subjects are concerned shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Part V of this Order. (4) The expression 'person to whom this Order applies' shall be construed in accordance with the above three sub-Articles. (5) The property and all personal or proprietary rights and liabilities within the said limits of British subjects and of foreigners within sub-Article (2) and of Bahrein subjects within sub-Article (3), whether such persons are themselves within or without the limits of this Order. (G) British ships and ships belonging to foreigners within sub- Article (2) with their boats, and the persons and property on board thereof, or belonging thereto, being within the limits of this Order; provided that jurisdiction over foreign ships shall not be exercised otherwise than according to the practice of the High Court in England in the exercise of jurisdiction over foreign ships. (7) If any question arises whether the subjects or citizens of any country, State, or tribe have or have 'not been placed under the jurisdiction of His Majesty by agreement with, or the consent of, the Sheikh of Bahrein, it shall be referred by the Court to the Political PesideiU, and a certificate under his hand and seal shall be conclusive on the question and judicial notice shall be taken thereof.' 10. Part V of the Order, to which reference is made in Article 8 quoted above, deals with the important class of case, whether civil or criminal, in which the parties are respectively a Bahrein subject and a person to whom the Order applies. The procedure laid down in it is as follows : — ' (a) Criminal. Article 41.—(1) When a Bahrein subject desires to institute a complaint against a person to whom this Order applies, or a person to whom this Order applies desires to institute a complaint against a Bahrein subject, the Political Agent shall entertain the same, and may— (а) with the concurrence of the Sheikh of Bahrein, himself hear and determine it in his District Court, or (б) send it to the Joint Court, or (c) if the defendant is a Alahomniedan, refer it to a Kazi for decision, sending a representative of the Agency to record briefly the proceedings. Such decision, when endorsed by the Political Agent, shall for all purposes be considered as if it were that of the District Court. (2) Nothing in this Article shall prevent the Political Resident from exercising the revisory powers possessed by him under Article 4 of the Convention with Bahrein, dated the 31st May 18yi.' :;: ' * See para. 1 above.P. 5040/20. P. 5668/27. Pol. Res. Desp. to G. of L, No. 295 S, of 1 Sept. 1927, para. 28. (b) Civil. Article 45.—(1) When a Bahrein subject desires to bring a suit against a person to whom this Order applies, or a person to whom this Order applies desires to bring a suit against a Bahrein subject, the Political Agent shall admit the complaint, and (a) with the concurrence of the Sheikh of Bahrein, may hear and determine the suit in his District Court, or {h) may hear and determine it in a Joint Court, or (c) may refer it to the Majlis-el-Urf for decision, or (d) in cases between •pearling-masters and divers, may refer it la the Salifah Court, or (e) with the consent of the several parties, may refer the case to one or more Arbitrators for settlement. (2) The judgment of the Joint Court or of the Majlis-el-Urf shall for all purposes be considered the same as if it were that of the District Court. (3) An appeal from the decision of the Salifah Court shall lie to the Political Agent acting in concert with the Sheikh of Bahrein, and in all Salifah cases their joint decision shall be final. (4) The award of the Arbitrator under Sub-Article 1 (c) shall he final, and shall not be open to appeal unless the same shall within a reasonable time have been ordered by the Political Agent to be set aside on the ground that it is not final or is defective, or that the Arbitrator has exceeded his authority, or has been guilty of misconduct in the matter. (5) Nothing herein mentioned shall prevent the District Court, the Joint Court, the Majlis-el-Urf, the Salifah Court, or the Arbitrator from referring any matter in the progress of a suit which involves a point of Mahommedan law to a Ivazi for decision, or from sending any partv or witness, being a Mahommedan, to a Xazi for the administration of an oath.' 11. At no subsequent stage does the Sheikh appear to have shown-, any signs of going back on his delegation of responsibility in respect of foieigneis other than the subjects of States in the Persian Gulf, to His Majesty s Government Difficulties, however, arose in the post-war period m connection with his claim to exercise jurisdiction over Nejdis and imiabitjints of El Katr.

(Corrected up to 1st April 1931.) Introductory. 1. The history of Aden, in relation to British India, commences with its capture in 1839 by H.Al. steamers Volage and Cruiser, and 700 men of the East India ■Company's troops (Bombay Army), and its annexation to the territories then in the possession of the Company, ft was vested in the Crown, as part of India, by the Government of India Act of 1858. Aden Settlement. 2. The Aden Settlement is a small area of British territory situated on the Arabian coast about 100 miles east of the Straits of Bab el Mandeb, of some 75 square miles (excluding Perim). It consists of two old craters forming rocky peninsulas in the south and west, and a flat strip of coast about 3 miles broad, the whole enclosing a bay known as the Aden Back Bay, about 8 miles broad east and west, and 4 miles deep north and south, with an entrance 3 miles across. British territory was formerly limited to the peninsula of Aden proper, extending to Khormaksar. In 1868 the island of Sira and the peninsula of Tabal Ihsan or Little Aden were acquired by purchase from the Sultan of Lahej, and in 1882 the flat strip of coast was also purchased. The southern peninsula—AdBii proper—has an area of about 21 square miles, and contains the native town of Aden, Steamer Point with a modern anchorage for large vessels, Maala with a dhow anchorage and wharf, and Tawahi. Khormaksar is in the isthmus with the aerodrome and lines of the Royal Air Force to the north. The peninsula on the we st—Little Aden—has an area of about 15 square miles, and the flat strip of coast, in which are situated the villages of Sheikh Othman, Hiswa and Imad, has an area of about 39 square miles. A general plan of the Aden Settlement is printed as an p.z. sow/si Appendix to the Aden Administration Report for 1930. Perim, 3. The island of Perim, in the Straits of Bab el Mandeb, at the entrance to the Red Sea, was occupied in 1799, subsequently abandoned, but reoccupied in 1857. It is now attached to the Aden Settlement for administrative purposes. It has an area of about 5 square miles and a population of 2,075, and is a coaling station, cable station and lighthouse point. 4. The territory forming part of Aden was defined by section 2 of the Aden Laws Regulation, 1891. ' It forms part of the Bombay Presidency as defined in section 3 (7) of the Bombay General Clauses Act, 1904 (Bombay Act No. 1 of 1904). The total population is approximately 53,000. Of these, 31,612 are Arabs and p.z. 364u/3i. 5,594 Indians (Census 1921). Aden Protectorate. 5. It very soon became evident that the occupation of Aden itself would be of little use unless a good understanding were arrived at with the neighbouring tribes, and treaties were entered into as occasion offered between His Majesty's Government and the Arab chiefs of the independent tribes occupying the hinterland. Turkish encroachment along the boundaries of the protected tribes was a constant source of trouble and various agreements were entered into as to the boundary line. These agreements were combined in an agreement between His Majesty's Government and the Turkish Government ratified in March 1914, in which the boundary line of the Protectorate was demarcated. This boundary begins at Ras Turba, on the mainland north-east of Perim, and extends in a north-easterly direction for over 200 miles to a point on the River Bana, near Kataba, excluding, however, the territory of Zuraiki and Kubati. From Kataba, a line drawn north-east from Lakamat Al Ash'ub to the desert defines the dividing line. In an easterly direction the area extends from this line and along the coast to the borders of Oman. The zone within which British influence is more immediately felt may be said to be the area comprised within the boundary line Ras Turba—Kataba on the west and a line east-south-east from Kataba to the coast, on the east. Beyond this line to the borders of Oman lies the territory known as the Hadramaut.3. The territorv forming the Protectorate is in the possession of 13 principal tribes The chiefs who are allowed salutes aie the following.—1 he Abdali, the Fadli the Kaiti, the Amir of Dhala, and the Sultan of Kishn and Socotra. The first named possesses great influence in the interior and renders valuable assistance to Government. 'Judicial Assistant,' para. 105.) Sphere of Political Influence. 8 From the north-west of the Ras Turba-Kataba line to the coast to a point about 41)0 miles north of Perim (Hall Point) are the territories of Yemen and Asir. These were formerly Turkish provinces, but since the war have been governed by their own Arab rulers, the Imam of Sanaa and the Idrisi (of whom the latter has uow been absorbed by Ibn Sand). Political influence is exercised in this area from the Residency. (See also para. 147.) Kamaran. 9. The island of Kamaran, situated near the Arabian coast, 200 miles north of Perim, was formerly a Turkish possession, and has been in British occupation since 1915. The island was not expressly mentioned in the Treaty of Lausanne. By Article 16, Turkey renounced 'all rights and title whatsoever over or respecting' islands other than those over which her sovereignty was recognised by that Treaty. The renunciation was not, however, in favour of the British or any other specified Government, Article 16 referring to the future of the territories and islands within the scope of the renunciation as 'being settled or to be settled, by the parties concerned.' Xo settlement of the future of Kamaran was effected at the time of the Treaty, and none has been effected since, and its political status remains undefined. It is at present administered by the Government of India through a Civil Adminisirator (at present Captain G. Wickham, I.A.R.O. Pay Rs. 1,000—100—1,500, T.A. Rs. 15, appointed 14th February 1024 , who is under the control of the Resident at Aden. 10. The island has an area of 22 square miles and a population of about 2,200. It contains a Quarantine Station for pilgrims on their way to Mecca from the East, through which about 66,000 pilgrims pass annually, and which, under an Anglo- ^utcii Agreement, bigned in 19J6, is managed jointly bv the Government of India and the Government of the Netherlands East Indies. Clause 2 of the Agreement provides that the Civil Administrator appointed by the Government of India shall be Director of the Station and in that capacity shall exercise general supervision and control over the whole staff of the Station ; that he shall be assisted by two Medical Officers, one appointed by the Government of India and the other bv the Government of the n! fAt r i n* f ; i that the Iudian and D,,tcl1 doctors shall alternate as l C n . 0fficero V he - Statl c Cm - Further, is agreed that these two Medical ioindv bv H ? ^ otmg of complete equality. Certain advances were made , H Majesty 3 Government and the Government of India in respect of a deautou the working of the Quarantine Station to 31st March 1922.

Shortly after the outbreak of the war the Government of India assumed control of political relations with the Yemen and Asir as well as with the Protectorate ; Kamaran was added to the civil administration and its safety became an additional military responsibility. 14. In 1917 it was decided to transfer the control of political relations (i.e. primarily relations with the Yemen and Asir, but the arrangement was applied also to political relations with the Protectorate) to the Foreign Office and military control (defence and operations) to the War Office. This arrangement was made to secure co-ordination of political action in the Middle East and unity of control and co-ordination of the military effort there. Local administration remained unchanged. 15. The resulting position was unsatisfactory. No clear line could be drawn between defence and administration or beiween political and administrative affairs. The Resident was responsible to four separate higher authorities on the subjects coming under his control. Questions of finance and incidence of expenditure outlined in the ensuing paragraph were in an untenable position. 16. Prior to 1900 the whole charge for the administration, civil and military, was borne by Indian revenues. In that year the Welby Commission recorded that, in equity, one half of the military charges should be met by the United Kingdom. In pursuance of this recommendation a contribution of £72,000 ;:: ' was made by the Imperial Government in addition to their bearing half the capital outlay on special defence works. The administrative reorganisation of 1917 referred to in para. 14 above was unaccompanied by any readjustment of financial responsibility. Indian revenues continued to bear the charge for internal administration and the cost of the pre-war strength of the garrison at current rates (subject to the contribution of £72,000), while the cost of additional forces maintained at Aden was shared equally between India and His Majesty's Government. (c) 1919-26. 17. In 1921 a Committee, appointed by the Cabinet under the chairmanship of Sir James Masterton-Smith, presented a report, which resulted in the formation of a Middle East Department within the Colonial Office, and which recommended the transfer of the administration of Aden to the Colonial Office, with, however, no proposals in regard to expenditure. 18. This recommendation was approved by the Cabinet, subject to the approval of the Government of India. The Government of India, after considering the Committee's recommendations, were prepared to agree to the transfer of Aden to the Imperial Government and to make a contribution of £100,000 per annum from Indian revenues, subject to His Majesty's Government undertaking responsibility for all charges connected with Aden. The Secretary of State for the Colonies, however, suggested an Indian contribution of £500,000, but ultimately a Colonial Office proposal that India should pay Rs. 50 lakhs a year was officially telegraphed to the Government of India, this amount to be open to reconsideration after five years. The Government of India were unable to accept this proposal. Various discussions subsequently took place on alternative proposals, but it was not found possible to arrive at a solution. In the meantime Indian sentiment, at first indifferent to the question, definitely hardened against the relinquishment of Aden. Finally, the basis of a settlement, which, whilst meeting the essential needs of Imperial policy and strategy, would not be unacceptable to Indian opinion, was arrived at and submitted to the Cabinet in a joint memorandum by the Secretaries of State for the Colonies, War and India (C.P. 414/26). Cabinet Decision of December 1926. 19. The Memorandum was considered by the Cabinet at a meeting held on the 16th December 1926, when, after considerable discussion, the Cabinet agreed : — ' (a) To approve the proposals of the Secretaries of State for the Colonies, War and India, in regard to the responsibility of the administration of Aden, the principal features of which are set forth in paragraphs 11, 12 and 16 of C.P. 414(26} in the following terms :— ' ' 11. ... that a single chief authority should be appointed in control at Aden by the Imperial Government, with the concurrence of the * The contribution by His Majesty's Government was nominally £100,000, but of this amount £28,000 was a contribution towards the cost of the India Office.f 1 nvernment of India, in the shape of a Political Resident or Governor, Cjovernme■ The Governor&gt; w ho would have with him a mihtarv P ffi pr a to command and administer the troops should be responsible to ?he Imperial Government in all political and military matters, and to tb e Pnvtrnment of India only for the internal munic.pal admmistration of ^ o m i .ant of Aden which would continue on the same basis as if have the titular rank of Commander -in -Chief, as is customary elsewhere, it being understood that the possession of th.s title w ,l not confer on nm • v.f in oivp executive orders to the troops, ihe Officer Commandiug th! Troops should be appointed by the War Office after consultation with i p Colonial Office. He should communicate direct with the War Otlice on ouestions of intelligence, training and preparation for war, as well as n.attprs ■iffectino- the routine administration of the troops. We recommend that this arrangement should take effect from 1st April 1927 as regards linance, and as regards administration as soon aftei that date as practicable. i • n c ^9 r phis arrangement would secure Impeiial contiol m all esSfiutial matters but leave India the satisfaction of retaining Aden as part of Judia mid still controlling the civil affairs of the Settlement, including its resident Indian population. In view of this we consider that India should be prepared to contribute towards the military and political charges a sum of £^50 000 a year for three years, and alter that £100,000 a year, or one -third of any total cost (including the cost of any Air Force units at Aden) whichever is the lesser figure. ' 4 16. We consider that the responsibility for the political and military administration of Aden should be vested primarily in the Secretary pf State for the Colonies, and that Imperial expenditure in connection with Aden should be borne on the Middle iLastein A ote. J hb military expenditure will in the first instance be borne bv the W ar OtHce, subject to reimbursement from the Middle iLastern \ ote. (The Chancellor of the Exchequer demurred from this decision oj principle being taken before it was known whether the two inquiries referred to below will achieve compensating economies in expenditure from British funds.) u (h) That the Lord Chancellor should arbitrate on the claim of the War Office set forth in C.P. -ill (^6), para. 15, that from the date on which the new increases to Imperial charges come into force (1st April 1927) the payment to India of a subsidy of £130,000 for sea transport out of Army Funds should be discontinued. ' (c) That the Committee of Chiefs of Staff should be instructed that the Cabinet desire that the defence of Aden should be reduced to a less costly basis, and should be asked to advise the Committee of Imperial Defence as to whether this can be effected without undue risks by an addition at Aden of a squadron of the Royal Air Force, combined with the withdrawal and disbandment of the British Infantry Battalion at present stationed there, or by any other means.' 20. It was decided early in 1928 that the responsibility for the defence organisation at Aden should be transferred from the War Office to the Air Ministry, and a Royal Air Force officer was appointed in April 1928 to assume the command and administration of the troops in the garrison. 21. During the following year steps were taken to implement the Cabinet decision by correspondence between the India Office and the Colonial Office, but little material result was attained, and in January 1928 a Standing Committee, consisting of representatives of the Colonial Office, India Office, Air Ministry and Treasury, was formed to make definite recommendations for giving effect to the decision. The Committee was under the Chairmanship of Mr. A. J. Harding, C.M.O., C.B.E., Assistant Secretary in the Middle East Department of the Colonial Office, who was succeeded by Mr. H. R. Cowell, C.M.G., in October 1928. Mr. J. 0. Laithwaite was appointed as the permanent representative of the Secretary of State for India on the Committee.22. The conditions of appointment, &amp;c. of the personnel for the future administra tion of Aden, Kamaran, Police, &amp;c. were discussed at these meetings and resulting therefrom the arrangements detailed in this memorandum have now been made. Administrative Arrangements. The Resident. Title. 23. The first point for immediate consideration by the Standing Aden Committee was to determine by what means and on what conditions of service the Resident or Governor was to be appointed. The title of the principal officer of the Settlement whilst the administration was controlled by the Government of India and the post was held by a Major-General of the Indian Army had been Political Resident and General Officer Commanding. In view of the delegation of executive authority in regard to military affairs the title of General Officer Commanding was considered unsuitable. A preference was expressed by the Colonial Office that the officer should be known as the Governor, but in view of the fact that he is subordinate to the Governor of Bombay in civil affairs this title was not acceptable to the Government m 23^/192H k&gt; of India or to the Secretary of State for India. It was finally agreed that the officer should in future be styled Resident and Commander-in-Chief, Aden. Position and Duties. 24. The Resident is the single and supreme authority responsible to, and representative of, His Majesty in Aden. He is responsible to the Imperial Government in all political and military matters through the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and to the Government of Bombay for the internal administration of the Settlement. The question of the transfer of direct control of the Civil p. 7297 /29. 1 .0. to Administration from the Government of Bombay to the Government of India is under c ' 0 ' 20 Nov ' 1,929 • consideration. In matters of military responsibility the power is delegated to the Air Officer Commanding, who is directly responsible to the Air Council and who deals with all questions of policy and major questions of administration of the military forces at Aden. The general relations of the Air Officer Commanding to p 971 / 28 I0 to the Resident follow the lines of Colonial Regulations 4 to 9, I9B and 199. do. 29 Feb. 1928. 25. It was agreed that the Resident should occupy in relation to His Majesty's p. 5044/27. 1 .0. to Government the position of an ordinary Colonial Governor, and that in respect of p^n/^'De^p those matters remaining under Indian control his position should be generally from s. of 's. for c. assimilated to that of the Commissioner in Sind in relation to the Government of o' ^ esdt Vn?o' 67 ' ■-w -| * j 1 Aug. -Ly^Jo. Bombay. 26. The Resident is responsible to the Secretary of State for the Colonies for political relations with the Arab chiefs m the Protectorate and in the conduct of relations with the local potentates outside the Protectorate. In this work he is assisted by the Protectorate Secretary (para. 85) and Political Officers (para. 110). 27. The administration of Civil and Criminal Justice is vested in the Court of the Resident by Bombay Act II of 1864, as amended by Act VI of 1927. The Resident is Chief Judge and Sessions Judge, but the exercise of jurisdiction is, in general, delegated to the Judicial Assistant (para. 104). In the internal administration of the Settlement the Resident is a Commissioner of Excise, Salt, Revenue and p. 5810/28. Noto Income Tax, and is responsible for the revenue collection.

The Government of India, in agreement with the Government of Bombay, recommended that the pay for an Indian Service officer appointed to the post shouM be that of a Resident of the Second Class in the Indian Political Departmeiit, viz. Rs. 3,000 per mensem plus overseas pay £13 65. Sd. per mensem with a sumptuary allowance of Rs. 500 per mensem (converted at I*?. Gd. = £2,700 per | annum, pins £160 overseas pay and sumptuary allowance of £450). These recom mendations were accepted by the Secretary of btate for India and His Majesty's Government. 36. Pay, sumptuary allowance, and travelling allowances are shared equally between Home and Indian revenues, irrespective of the Service from which the Resident is drawn. The entertainment or sumptuary allowance is transferable to the officer acting as Resident in the absence of the Resident on leave, &amp;c. 37. Residents from either Service are now exempted from the payment of bouse rent, lighting and sanitary charges.| ^ Sir Stewart Symes was succeeded as Resident, on his appointment in March 1931 to be Governor of langanyika, by Lieutenant-Colonel B.

Prior to 1927 no furniture was provided for the Residency by Government Furniture was hired from a local firm at a monthly rental and passed on from Resident to Resident. The question of equipping the Residency in accordance with Colonial practice, at Government expense, was considered, and it was decided that the Residency should be furnished and equipped on the scale shown in paras. 359 to 364 of Colonial Regulations. The cost of the equipment, which amounted to slightly less than £3,000, was shared equally between His Majesty's Government and the Government of India. 0 54.

The War Office have intimated that there is no objection to a civilian holder of the post being styled Aide-de-Camp. Pay. 59. An officer of the Indian Army appointed as Aide-de-Camp to the Resident and General Officer Commanding' received the scale of pay for this appointment as determined in Army Instruction (India) No. 1—S/1925, as follows :—- Appointment held by Lieutenant.

At the date of the Cabinet decision (see para. 19) the garrison at Aden, ler jjj pN' excluding technical troojjs, consisted of one Indian battalion, one British battalion S and an Indian unit raised specially (from India) for service in Aden, known as the t r ; a |, Aden Troop. These units were responsible for the defence of Aden and the islands o nv i ?^% 0 f Perim and Kamaran. On the transfer of control to the Air Ministry, that Department took immediate steps to dispense with these troops, undertaking to discharge the defence responsibilities hitherto borne by the battalions at Aden by— ^ ^ CoiiiicJ ( a ) Aeroplanes ; &gt; . r ^Coiu^ (?&gt;) Armoured cars ; jorisdictin, (c) Tribal levies for emplovment in the Aden Protectorate from which they were iComcil^: to be raised; (d) Armed police raised locally to be employed in the Aden Settlement, in Perim and Kamaran. 115. The Aden Police, under the control of a Deputy Superintendent, of the 901) Bombay Provincial Police Department, were not organised, armed, nor trained for dealing with any local disturbances of internal security. The existence of the British ,jj i f|H and Indian battalions was of sufficient moral effect to prevent any troubles and the battalions formed an efficient backing in reserve for the Aden Police. The removal of the battalions consequently necessitated an improvement in the organisation of the (dure, as apt existing Police Force. In addition, this Force needed bringing up to strength and a wed a certain t certa i n amount of reorganisation to enable it to perform the ordinary civil duties of the police. Consequent on the decision in para. 112 (d) above it was necessary to se the wr ra ^ se a f orce arme d police which could provide the moral support hitherto provided Md tbEeiV the battalions. idian 114.

Wilkins, M.C., D.F.C., of the Indian Police Service, were detailed by tlie Government of India and the Government of Bombay to proceed to Aden to study the reorganisation of the civil police at Aden, and to examine further the scheme for the recruitment of armed police. Reports were submitted on the 6th and 13th July 1928. 115. The reports recommended that the force should be organised as a whole udicial pay at t.: unc ] er a District Superintendent of Police and an Assistant Superintendent, to replace 50-300 per i^he Assistant Resident at present in charge of the police and the Deputy to Indianreveffiguperintendent in immediate charge. The establishment considered necessary was :— British officers - - 2 Armed police - - 254 ice within tin Inspectors - - - 14 Constables - - - 292 Jamadars - - - 4 Clerks - - -13 116. The proposals were generally acceptable to the Governments concerned. It p. 5816/30. .Col. M. C. Laic was, however, ultimately decided to limit the armed police to 200 in the ranks, while [•untilhecanr^the Government of India's concurrence in their recruitment locally was subject to the i C ontribntioD, Preservation that this should be regarded as an experiment. Pending the recruit ment locally and training of the armed police it was decided to employ an interim force of 100 armed police (subsequently increased to 115 to provide a reserve), . , p ip recruited from India and the disbanded Aden Troop, This force was not to be LiDitea w ithdrawn until it was clear that the locally raised armed police were really efficient and capable of carrying out the duties entrusted to them.

The recruitment and training of the locally raised force of armed police is now proceeding. A Superintendent for the combined force, who is also in charge of the temporary force of 100, and an Assistant Superintendent for the armed police have been posted, and the conditions of appoint ment, &amp;c., of these officers are detailed below.

It was agreed that the infantry barracks at Crater should be adapted as accommodation for the interim force, the cost ot alterations, repairs, maintenance, to be borne by His Majesty's Government, lu the event of any portion bebg subsequently used by the Aden Tolice Force a readjustment is to be effected. 118 Considerable discussion took place on the incidence of the cost of the police arrangements. The Air Ministry and the Colonial Office were oi opinion thai expenditure on the police was a civil charge and was therefore not apportionable, To this view the Secretary of State for India and the Government of India were unable to a o Tee and it was maintained that India could not he expected to bear any expenditure additional to that regarded as necessary to bring the civil police to a reasonable level of efficiency. Ultimately a compromise was ettected under whicli His Majesty's Government are to contribute £5,000 per annum towards the cost of the new force, this payment to be outside the existing financial aiiangements, with an additional £3,000 per annum in respect of the policing of Kamaran. The remaining recurring expenditure is shared between the Government of India and the Government of Bombay. Two additional platoons of levies are also at present maintained by His Majesty's Government, one on the mainland as a military backing for the police, and the other at Kamaran, where, however, it will be replaced by police in or about September 1931, and will then be disbanded. This compromise was subject to the reservation by the Government of India that it would be open to revision ' if local recruitment, which is the basis cf the present calculations, should prove a failure, and recruitment in India became necessary with a corresponding increase of cost.' The cost of the new buildings and equipment required for the permanent Aden Police Force will be shared between His Majesty's Government and the Government of India in the same proportion as the recurrent expenditure, subject, so far as equipment is concerned, to credit being afforded to His Majesty's Government for any serviceable equipment transferred from the temporary armed force. Superintendent and Commandant of Police. 119. It was agreed that the Superintendent of Police should invariably be a British officer of the Indian Police Service. A Superintendent was accordingly appointed from the Indian Police Service to take command of the interim armed police and to supervise the arrangements for the reorganisation of the unarmed police and the recruitment, training, &amp;c., of the permanent armed police. He arrived in Aden in November 1928. The interim police came into being on 9th January 1929, and arrangements for the recruitment and training of the permanent armed police and the reorganisation of the ordinary police are proceeding, 120. The Superintendent is in sole charge of the Aden Police Force, armed and unarmed, subject to the administrative control of the Resident, and has full powers of appointment, promotion and dismissal. He is responsible for the training, discipline and working of the Force and the control of the detachment of armed police in Perim and Kamaran.

Civil and municipal expenditure and receipts continued to be defrayed by and accrue to the Government of Bombay. It was recognised, however, that certain items of expenditure might be partly civil and partly political. The amounts involved were, in the main, small, but it was found necessary to consider each ieiit' s paj^ item in detail. Definite allocation of posts between political and civil, in particular bv the Go'* 1 i n regard to the clerical and menial establishment, was not considered practicable, )ine vjii ^iaclJ and was, moreover, regarded as undesirable, owing to the tendency which would iet1 ^ 1 t^illc®'arise for the administrative machinery to be broken up into compartments, instead of ernflieD working as a whole, were such a division carried out.

The liability of the a.g. 8319/30. c.o.

The question of the rvice, wk) is m liability of the Superintendent of Police, Civil Surgeon and the Superintendent of Officer. HeisF the Residency Office, and also of the locally employed staff (in those cases in which His Majesty's Government make a contribution to the Government of India of a proportion of their emoluments), was the subject of considerable discussion between ipriate rates as r the Colonial Office and the Board. Ultimately it was agreed that no liability to a.g. 7083/so. British Income Tax should attach to the salaries of the personnel in question on the ^c'o irasahfA grounds that, although a definite contribution was made from British funds towards p. 2044/758/29,' the salaries, the payments were, in effect, generally in respect of services rendered 10 June 1930. by the civil administration to His Majesty's Government and that the conditions of service, &amp;c., are determined entirely by the Government of India. 146. The Board of Inland Revenue also agreed not to press the question of the 1642/30. f .printer liability of Indian Service officers in respect of additional allowances received when Revenue 1 to cx?, a '' 1 ' acting for Colonial Service officers on leave, or of the liability of the Resident for the t. 2044/758/29,' year 1927-8 and of the officer who acted as Protectorate Secretary pending the arrival of the officer appointed by the Colonial Office. etuals.

The addition of 2 platoons, making 6 in all, has been made to the force and the strength has been increased to 3 British Officers, 2 British Non-commissioned Officers, 2ol Native Officers and other ranks and 34 followers, with animal and mechanical of approj^ transport. The force is under the administrative control of the Air Ministry and the cost is borne entirely on United Kingdom funds (Colonial and Middle Eastern Services Vote—Class II, 9). ■quarters. 18 Feb. 1930.Mission at Hodeidah. 148. The salary (Us. 175 per mensem) and expenses (Us. 25 per mensem) of a Political Clerk at Hodeidah and the wages of a Peon (Us.

The Political Clerk is under the control of the Second Assistant Resident, Aden, and is required on account ol the relations between His Majesty's Government and the Idrisi of Asir and the Imam of the Yemen.

The cost of this force is borne entirely by His Majesty's Government (on Air Ministry votes) subject to a contribution from the Government of India, referred to in para. 19 (12). U. FRANCE. Political Department, India Office, April 1931.93 APPENDIX. Memorandum drawn up by the Colonial Oflice dealing with the Financial Arrangements relating to Charges against the Funds of the United Kingdom. 1. (See paras. 12 to 19 of the Main Notes for greater detail.) Prior to 1st April 1927, Aden was administered by the Government of India and the cost of adminis tration and the cost of the garrison with the exception of the cost of the Royal Air Force was borne by the Government of India subject to a financial contribution by the Government of the United Kingdom. Since 1914 this contribution consisted of (1) a fixed sum of &lt;£100,000' :;: ' per annum, and (2) a moiety of the charge for troops in excess of the pre-war garrison. As from 1st April 1927 responsibility for the political and military administration was vested in the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the civil administration of Aden remaining under the control of the Government of India. The Government of India contributed £250,000 per annum towards the cost of the political and military services in Aden for three years from 1927, and the whole of the £250,000 was appropriated in aid of the votes on which the defence expenditure was borne. As from 1930 the contribution was fixed at £.150,000 per annum or one-third of the total cost borne on United Kingdom, funds (whichever was the less), excluding the cost of the Resident's pension, the United Kingdom contribution towards the cost of the local police force and the cost of the mission at llodeidah. In 1927, the total cost of expenditure on Aden borne on United Kingdom funds, including defence expenditure, was provided for under subhead L of the Vote for Middle Eastern Services (Class IT, 10) and the contribution from the Government of India (£250,000) was brought to account under subhead M (Appropriations-in-Aid) of the same Vote. From 1928 onwards the cost of defence expenditure (apart from the cost of a small local force) has been borne on Army and Air Votes and the United Kingdom Government's share of the cost of the civil expenditure in connection with the Protectorate and the cost of the local force has been borne on the Aden subhead of the Vote for Colonial and Middle Eastern Services (Class II, 9). 2. The United Kingdom share of the Aden expenditure, apart from expenditure on the Royal Air Force, which is borne on Air Ministry Votes, can conveniently be shown as follows ;— (1) Contribution to Government of India in respect of the Civil Services connected with the Protectorate. The expenditure on the above Civil Services is met in the first case by the Government of India, and a claim is submitted quarterly to the Colonial Office for the agreed United Kingdom share of the expenditure. No supporting vouchers are forwarded, but the claim is certified by the Accountant-General, Bombay, who is responsible for the local audit of Aden expenditure. The agreed United Kingdom share of the expenditure for the three years 1st April 1930 to 31st March 1933 is referred to in para. 133 of the Main Notes. {2) Contribution to Government of India in respect of whole cost of a temporary armed Police Force of 100 Indians {plus a reserve of 15 men) pending reorganisation of the permanent Police Force. (See para. 115 of Main Notes.) The cost is met in the first case from Indian revenues, and a claim for the whole cost unsupported by vouchers but certified by the Accountant- General, Bombay, is forwarded quarterly to the Colonial Office, and when agreed is set off against funds advanced by the Colonial Office to the India Office. (3) Contribution to Government of India in respect of the reorganised Police Force (see para. 117 of Main Notes). No contribution lias yet been paid, pending the completion of the reorganisation of the permanent Police Force. The full contribution when payable has been fixed at £8,000 per annum and when due will be paid over by'the Colonial Office to the India Office in such instalments as may be decided upon. * See para. 16 and footnote.including Chiefs antl other miscellaneous. (4) Cost of wholly political services, (oi Second Assistant Resident and Protectorate [secretary (6) Political Officer. (c) Pension contributions ot (a) aiuM,^;. (d) Cost of leave passages of (a) am (e) Expenditure on Protectoiate expenditure. . . . , (/) C^ost of Mission at Hodeidali. (g) Miscellaneous expenditure. The salary of the present Second Assistant Resident is, for his convenience,, issued by the Colonial Office direct to his bankers in the United Kingdom. Certain expenditure under (6) (c), (d), (e) and (g) above is also occasionally paid in the first place by the Colonial Office, but generally the expenditure is incurred by the Resident in Aden from Indian Government funds in his hands and accounted for direct to the Colonial Office with supporting vouchers. After examination so much of the expenditure as is allowed as being in order is notified to the India Office as having been accepted by the Colonial Office and is set off against the advances which the Colonial Office has made to the India Office in respect of Aden expenditure. As the expenditure under this head is wholly chargeable to the Government of the United Kingdom it was found more convenient that the Resident should account for it direct to the Colonial Office rather than to the Government of Bombay. (5) Cost of the Tribal Levies. (Sec para. 14G of Main Notes.) These Levies are administered by the Air Ministry on behalf of the Colonial Office. The cost is wholly chargeable to the Government of s the United Kingdom, and is met from the Aden subhead of tho Vote for Colonial and Middle Eastern Services (Class 11, 9). The Colonial Office makes quarterly advances to the Air Ministry on account of the estimated expenditure, and the Air Ministry Accounting Officer certifies as to the actual expenditure on the force after the close of the year. No details of the expenditure are given by the Air Ministry. 3. The Colonial Office makes advances from time to time to the India Office in respect of (1), (2) and (-1) referred to in para. 2, and the relative claims are received in the Colonial Office and are checked, and the India Office is thereafter notified that the whole for part) of the amount of the claim is admitted and can be set off against the advances already made. In certain exceptional circumstances (e .g. purchase of furniture for Residency) the expenditure has been incurred in the first case by the Colonial Office and the Government of India's share has been debited to the India Office and treated as an advance on account of further expenditure debitable to United Kingdom funds.

The following were present at the meeting: Mr. G.W. RendeL, (in the Chair) Foreign Office Mr. K.R. Johnstone Sir A. Ryan, His Majesty's Minister at Jedda. Lieutenant-Colonel T.C. Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Mr. J.G. Laithwaite, India Office. The meeting had before it Sir Andrev/ Ryan r s note of the 16th August, regarding the attitude of King Ibn Saud towards Koweit (see Appendix A). MR. RENDEL outlined the present political situation of Koweit. The Sheikh was tied to His Majesty's Government 'by his treaty engagements, but at the same time was being courted both by Ibn Saud and by Iraq. It was clear that the Sheikhdoaa was not in a position which in the ordinary way fir- would enable it to stand alone either as a political or as an economic entity and that it must therefore depend on some stronger Power. He understood that it was the policy of His Majesty 1 s Government, in view of the strategic importance ot Koweit, not to allow it to be absorbed by any foreign Power, but, so far as was possible, to maintain tneir present treaty relationship with the Sheikh. MR. LAITHWAITE/: SU 2. MR. LAITOTAITE suggested that Koweit was at the present moment of more vital importance to His Majesty's G-overnment than it had 'been at any time since it had 'bulked so promin ently as the terminus of the Baghdad railway before the war. This was the result first of the development of the air route to India and Australia, which had made the Gulf as important imperially from the air standpoint as was the Suez Canal for naval reasons, and secondly owing to the expira tion of the mandatory regime in Iraq and the uncertainty of the future relations of His Majesty's Government with that country. So long as Iraq had been under British control, there had been a natural tendency to give it prior con sideration and the less important question of Koweit had been kept comparatively in the background. But now that Iraq had attained full independence, the position was changed and Koweit had once again assumed major importance. Geographically, Koweit occupied a key position at the head of the Persian Gulf, and one from v/hich the Gulf could be controlled. In the event of war we could probably safely assume that Koweit would be on our side and her territory would afford us a base of operations of definite value to the use of which, on the assumption in question, no objection could be raised on the ground that we were violating her neutrality. Further, with the development of the Arabian coast air route to the East, Koweit was likely to prove more and more vital as a station on that route, especially if our relations with Iraq should at any time become so strained that we were unable to rely on the use of the Iraqi aerodromes for the purposes (?f that route. COLONEL FOWLE/COLONEL FOWLE cnggcsted that in point of fact it night one day he possible to avoid the use of Iraq altogether and fly direct from Palestine to Kov/eit^ as the range of the aircraft using the Arabian route in creased* MR. RKMDEL concurred with Mr* Laithwaite's estimate of the position as regards Iraq» In view cf recent events in Iraq it was possible that our whole relationship with that country might have to be modified and he considered that both the future of the .Anglo-Iraqi treaty and of the position of the Royal Air Force in Iraq must be regarded as doubtful. On the general point at issue, he observed that one of the main points to be borne in mind was the fact that Koweit was not naturally inde pendent from either the geographical or the economic point of view* It was a port without a hinterland^ cut off at present by the Iraqi and Saudi frontiers from the territory which it would naturally feed, and at present • denied free comnunication with the country behind it» Moreover 5 even its present trade might be jeopardised by the development of the Saudi port at Ras Tanura under the auspices of the American oil concessionaires on the Hasa coast. What was even more important was that its fresh-water supply was not derived from its own territory ? but had to be imported from Iraq* It was for considera tion therefore whether it would in fact be practicable for Kis Majesty^ Government to maintain the independence of Kov/eit as against itts neighbours^ at any rate on the present basis of a rather loose and ill-defined dependence on His Maj esty f s Governments COLONEL FOWLE/ftit 4. COLONEL i'OV/LE concurred generally in Mr. Rendel's description of the economic position of the Sheikhdom. He pointed oatj however, that Kov/eit had alvrays been the port of the deserts of northern Arabia, as Bahrain was the pert of Central Arabia. In regard to the position of Koweit vis-a-vis of Iraq, he added that beside the influence which Iraq could exert by controlling Koweit's fresh-y/ater supply, it ¥/as also powerful enough to biing pressure to bear upon Kcweit cver^ for instance, the question of smuggling. MR. RENDEL agreed that both Iraq and Saudi Arabia were in a position to exert strong pressure on Koweit. This being so, the rivalry between them over Koweit was likely to j-ncxease, unless ol course Saudi Arabia disintegrated. The present position of Koweit between these two States was weak and oir Andrew Ryan's note showed how powerful an attraction Ibn Saud could exert. The question therefore was -ffhether His Majesty's Government would not be well advised to develop and tighten up their own relations with Kov/eit in order to strengthen its positiono It had in fact been suggested that it '-light be more advantageous to convert our present treaty relationship into a definite protectorate, on, for instance, ohe analogy oi the Hadramaut, which was now regarded as part of the Aden Protectorate but where our treaty relationship with the local rulers and obligations to afford them protection had ^e^ if anything looser than those we had towards Ko?/eit» i/ould not a Protectorate ensure Koweit more effectively against aosorptian than the present attempt to maintain the oheikhdom as a kind of political vacuum in the Persian Gulf, MR. LAITHWAITE drew attention to three points:- (a)/(a) At present the obligations His Majesty's Government to Kowelt were represented by their undertaking * to grant 'good offices' In respect of Kowelt under the 1899 Agreement, by their premise of 1907 that 'the town of 'Kowelt and Its boundaries belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us- 'Suba, Hiler of Kowelt, and to his heirs after him' and their undertaking of 3rd November 1914 that Kowelt, In the event of a victory over the Hirks, would be recognised by us as an Independent principality under British protec tion. They were thus vary general in tems, and, in ac cordance with our normal policy on the Arab littoral, which (3ftted from a period In which It was possible to protect a sea port by action from the sea, but not to afford effective help inland, we had consistently endeavoured to limit our obligations save as regards 'good offices' to Kowelt town and the Inmediately ad- Joining area. Recent eiperlence had, however, shown that in cases of intervention from outside it was in fact necessary to give the Sheikh, at our discretion, and on cur own terms, a measure of active assistance up to the limit of his frontiers and with the development of aircraft the problem of Inland defence was now less difficult. This was to sane extent a strengthening of his strict treaty position, as also possibly an extension of our strict treaty obligations. ( o Ol^laftjvdU^ (b) With regard to the suggested establishment of a Protectorate it was necessary to consider wtat the reactions of the Sheikh wculd be, and also what Gffect the proclama tion of a Protectorate mi^it have on the other Arab rulers of the Gulf. It wculd in any case be wiser not to make an overt proclamation of this nature since both in Bahrain and in Qatar and along the Trucial Coast it would probably rouse apprehensionsapprehensions and might even cause the local Sheikhs to turn away from His Majesty's Government and consider aub- raifting ttoeraaelvss to Persia or to Ibn Saud. (c) The basis of His Majesty's Goverament's present treaty relationship with Kowait was unsatisfactory. In the first place it did not rest, as we.s the case with Bahrein, Muscat and the Trucial Sheikhdoms, on a long series of formal treaties with the gb®ikli (Sating back for over a century or, &amp;a in the case of Qatar, on a compre hensive treaty-, hut sras 'oarisd only 01 a comparatively brief correspondence exchanged between the Sheikhs and His Majesty's Governraeot since 1099 and on the reciprocal ens*geneats, still presumably binding since thsy had not been abrogated, entered into in connesiou with the lease of Bunder Shweikh in 1307; secondly thare were certain gaps, e .g. we had no slavery agreement wl'fch Koweit. It might, he suggested, be possible to fill in the gaps left by this correapcndencs and tighten our ccetrol in that way. An example was cur rocsat requsst to the Sheikh for certain undertakings in regard to air facilities in his Sheikhdom, one result of which would ba to concentre to effective control of such facilities, whether military or civil, in the hands of His Majesty's Government. Another instance was the recoat proposed am en® i ent of the Koweit Order-in-Council so as to place rssponsibility for Juris diction over non-Moslan foreigners in the hands of His Majesty's Government. A gradial tightfHitog of cur control of this character, particularly if pursued as a definite policy on all convenient occasions, would, he thought, at once avoid the difficulties Involved in establishing a■ formal protectorate and would make it very nuch simpler. COLCNEL....1 i. 7. COLO vEL POWLE expressed the view that there did not seem to he any intermedipte position possible 'between a treaty relationship with the jheikh on the present lines and a lull Protectorate. The Bheikh would certainly he unwilling- to agree to the sheikhdom becoming a formal protectorate, and p rime , fac ig he (Colonel Fowle) was not much in favour of it. He agreed, however, that it would be advisable on suitable opportunities, to try to tighten up our control over the Sheikh. On being questioned whether he did not consider that our restricted position vis-a-vis of the Sheikh in regard to the Koweit oil concession indicated the essential weak ness of our treaty position, he replied that our difficul ties in that case had been due rather to the special undertakings given to the United States Government in that matter than to any v/eakness in our normal control over the Sheikh under the treaty engagements. Had we been able, without violating our pledges to the United States Govern ment, to tell the Sheikh that we required him to give the concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company he would have done so. MB. PvEMDEL drew attention to the fact that in the event of serious misgovernment by the Huler of Koweit such as nrejudicially to affect foreign citizens in Koweit we might find ourselves in a difficult position vis-a-vis the foreign power concerned. MP!. LAITHWAITE said that on this noint he thought that Bahrain might be regarded as loc us cla ssic us. He had for many years put up with a considerable degree of misgovernment by Sheikh Isa. But when conditions at last in our view became intolerable we did not hesitate to intervene and to depose the Sheikh. There3. here were obvious argumente--for doing so, for were we not to intervene when mlsgovernment had reached a certain pitch it would be most difficult for us to justify a re fusal to allow foreign governments which migfrt he affected to take steps to protect the interests of their nationals. e did not think that there need be any apprehension in the case of Koweit that we would fail to bring pressure on a Sheikh who was abusing his position, once it became necessary to do so. The case for early intervention would probably be stronger now that the Gulf was so much more in the public eye. The meeting then went on to consider relations between Ibn Gaud and Koweit. . BIH AMD7-.EW HYAN stated that he had been impressed by the apparent weakness of His Majesty's rrovernment 1 s position vis-a-vis of Ibn Baud with regard to Koweit. His 1 pjesty's Government were not strongly Blaced, when it becr.ne necessary to warn Ibn Saud to keep his hands off Koweit, since they were committed to maintain ing that Koweit was technically an independent State. A case in point had been the Saudi intrusions into Koweit territory referred to in paragraph 3 of his note, when Saudi officials had performed acts ox authority within the limits of the sheikhdom. COLOJEL FOWLID pointed out that in fact our treaty engagements did entitle us to prevent foreign Powers from dealing direct with the Sheikh. Ibn Saud had certainly been informed of the special relations existing between the Sheikh and His Majesty's Government. Speaking generally, he added that in fact little trouble was likely to be experienced with foreigners in Koweit,so long as it remained a Beduin town ruled by a Beduin Sheikh and not, like Bahrain, a relatively cosmopolitan commercial centre. If,however,oil were discovered within the bheikh- dom, it was possible that difficulties might arise. MH.KLJDEL.PN, i * v 9o IvIR. HENDEL pointed out that the Arabian air route was likely to develop quicklyo If Iraq were to adopt an anti- foreign policy, and Koweit 'became correspondingly more important as a centre of international traffic, other countries might well wish to take advantage of the facilities there 0 We might well find many foreign Powers 'becoming increasingly interested in Koweit, We could not have it both ways, and should sooner or later have to define our position. His Majesty's Government ought ? therefore, to orient their policy definitely either towards the greater independence of the Sheikhdom or towards a tightening of their own control„ MR, LAITHWAITE agreed and added that, in his view, our policy should he directed towards a closer control B hut that it v/as undesirable to hasten any overt declara tion of full control, such as the establishment of a protectorate would he. Such a declaration might well frighten the Sheikhs of Bahrain and of the Trucial Coast and do more harm than goodo The policy to he followed was, therefore, one of occasional minor adjustments, as these became necessary, tending to increase, or at any rate not to relax, our control over the Sheikhdom. Reverting to the question of Saudi-Kov/eiti relations, SXH HYxla drew attention to the toleration extended by His Majesty's Government to direct correspondence on business matters between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud, This, no less than the independence formula, placed us in a weak position in defending Koweit s and the correspondence in Question was of such long standing that it was difficult now for us to take the line that Ibn Saud should write to us rather than to the Sheikh* What was desirable was that we , „ 010. v.'e should oe able to tell Ibn Saud openly that v/e were responsible for defending the Sheikh's interests in any given dispute. MR. LAITHWAITE said that the explanation of the system of direct correspondence between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud v/as, he thought, that it dated from a time when the latter was not so important a ruler as he had since oecome and when we had token the view that it was un necessary to take too strict a view of correspondence between Sheikh and Sheikh. That position was now changed, and reconsideration seemed desirable. Ibn Saud was well aware both that His Majesty's Government conducted the foreign relations of Koweit and that the Sheikh hod undertaken certain obligations towards us,. He agreed that it was now necessary to exert stricter control over the correspondence in question and to emphasize our own special position in Koweit vis-a-vis of Ibn Saud more definitely than had been the case while Iraq was still under British control. He suggested that we might; (a) check Ibn Saud when he appeared to be presuming too far with regard to Koweit - a policy which we were in lact now prepared to follow in regard to the Saudi-Xovfeit blockade, and (b) enforce stricter regula tions on the Sheikh in the matter of direct correspondence. 00101®! FOWLS agreed. Such action would show both theSheikh and Ibn Saud that we considered the Sheikh to be under our direction. If we did not take some such step as this, we might be in danger of finding ourselves faced with the results of a kind of conspiracy between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud, We ought, therefore, to write to the .,.r- 11. the Sheikh in bho sense that we noted that his private correspondence with Ihn Baud had a^-Jined an Increasing importance ©.rid tell h:bn iaat that corrarj'pondonce must now cease. MR. RSNDEL concurred^ A straightfonvard control of thifi nature would he easier to maintain and would prevent a repetition of. such incidents as the letter in which Ihn Baud had recently tried to detach the Sheikh of Koweit from his connexion with His Majesty's Government, SIR Ao RYAII also concurred, and drew attention to the success with which Ihn Baud was spreading the idea that he might naturally ahsoro Koweit and was hound to do so sooner or. later 3 He pointed out that such an idea could never have prevailed to the extent to which it had, if His Majesty's Government had equally definitely made known their own special position with regard to Koweit P The meeting then discussed what point in the corres pondence between the Sheikh and Ihn Baud could most suit ably he taken up in connexion with the reprimand which it was proposed to address to hoth parties 0 MR* LAITHWAITS suggested that if it were discovered that the Sheikh had committed himself to Ihn Baud in regard to the grant of an oil concession in the Koweit Neutral Zone, this might he an excellent opportunity for checking him. The question then arose what action could he taken if the United States Government^ in dealing with whom His Maj isty-s Government had consistently emphasized the Sheikh's independence3 were to produce communications from him regarding the grant of a concession in the Neutral Zonec It wasj however, agreed that His Majesty's Govern- merit could demonstrate from the Sheikh's treaty engagements that he had not he en entitled to make any such grant with out o s 0without our knowledge ana consent. Eventually it was' agreed that the most suitable occasion for the proposed representations to the Sheilm and Ita, Baud would he Ihn Baud's letter suggesting terms for the settlement of the Saudi hlockade of Koweit and warning the Sheikh against His Majesty's Government= At the conclusion of the meeting SIR A, RYAN raised the question of the pressure which might te exerted upon Ibn Saud in regard to the Saudi blockade of Koweit. This blockade had one of two purposes, either to complete the economic strangulation of Koweit and lead to its complete absorption in Saudi Arabia, or else the safeguarding of Saudi economic interests. His Majesty's Government could not possibly allow the first of these alternatives. The question therefore was what real force there was in Ibn Baud's suggestion that his own purely economic interests required the maintenance of the blockade. COLONEL POWLE suggested that we might well revert to the SheiKh's proposal that Ibn Saud should have customs posts at a given place along but outside the Koweiti border, and that this might, if necessary, be coupled with a system of manifests for Koweiti~Saudi trade. He gave it as his opinion that even if Ibn Saud were to develop Ras Tanura, possibly-v/ith American help, this port was not likely to compete seriously with Koweit, which served quite a different hinterland, nor was there any port between the Koweit area and the Ras Tanura area which could be successfully developed as a rival to Koweit. COLONEL FO'TLE suggested that on his return to the Gulf ..,Gulf on 16th October he should discuss the slbuation ^vith Colonel Dickson, Political Agent, Kowelt, who had great experience 01 the sheikhdoir. } In the light of the conversa tions at Hie present meeting, and should suhrait a compre^ hensive report. It was agreed that this course should 'be adopted s and that in the light of the Eesident's report and of the conclusions of the present meeting the question of future policy in Koweit should he discussed if necessary in the lliddle East Official 3ub«Comitteec The conclusions of the meeting were as follows: (1) That in dealing with Ton Baud, His Majesty's Government should increasLugly emphasize the closeness of their relations with the Sheikh, (2) That the Sheikh should he told that his personal correspondence v/ith Ihn Saud on official matters was to ceasec (3) That the issue of the Saudi 'blockade of Koweit should he taken up with Ihn Saud hy His Ilajesty's Govern ment on the basis of their obligation to protect the interests of Kcweit* (4) That on receipt of the despatch promised hy Colonel Powle the whole question of relations between His Majesty's Government and Koweit might suitably he referred for further discussion to the Middle A'ast Official Sub- Committee 5 to which a note should he sent recording the points discussed at the present meeting5 and sebting forth the arguments for and against the possible declaration of a protectorateo•A b Ii)IX_A. - 4. -i _ . 14: ii9-lg^j J Z xxiidrew Ryaru Ibn Sand's attitude tov/ards Kowait c I have been turning over in my mind for some time the possibility that it may be a definite object of Ibn Saud's policy to reduce Kowait to a position of dependence on him somev/hat similar to that of iisir from 1926 to 1950» This is in the nature ol a pure speculation but it is a speculation so interesting that I think it worth while to collect the principal data bearing on it. It must be admitted at the outset that, if Ibn Saud had such an idea in his head, he would realise the need for great caution lest he should indispose His kajesty's Government. His only formal obligation towards the latter is that contained in Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda but he understands very well the implications of the words therein !I who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty's Government'. On the other hand he has seen His Majesty's Government tolerate direct correspondence on business subjects between him and the Sheikh of Koweit. He might think that they would not react over strongly if he and the Sheikh confronted them with the fait accompli of a political deal. 2* Apart from the correspondence, of which we have knowledge, there has been other intercourse between the rulers, notably the Sheikh's visit to Riadh in 1932, the secret messages brought by Ibn Saud's comidential messenger to the Sheikh early this year and the Sheikh's mysterious dashes into Nejd last February, when Colonel Dickson surmised that he had gone to meet some high Saudi personage, possibly Ibn Saud himself. 3. I may interpolate, as a minor indication of Ibn Saud's attitude, a reference to two occasions on which it has been suggested or hinted by his Ministry of Foreign Affairs that His Majesty's. ^ ''V i t f ■ \ bW 15. iajesty's Gov^riuient should not concern theuselvcs v/ith afiai^'s loetweeu Saudi Araoia mid Lowait. I class then as minor, hecause this position has never heen categorically asserted, rne lirst v/as when, in reply to a couplaint of riine regarding Saudi encroachiacnts on l^ov^ait territory, ^diich had pertui'hed i.lis Majesty's aoveniiaent, the reply was in eifect: 'Sorry you have heen perturbed. You need not have heen if xhe matter nad Oo^n pursued through An. ilafisi'. ''-n another occasion r'uad ^ey, in rather light conversation, asked me wny we concerned ourselves in jiatters between his Govteennent and xvowait. 4. vhe personal relations between tne two rulers are peculiar. Ibn Gaud grew up at l.owait and it is sometimes said that he has shown himself ungrateful to his former hosts. It is saiu &gt;...y o-chers, I do not know on what precise grounds, that leubarak treated Ihn Baud very 'badly. - nyhow, through all the relations there runs a thread of old friendsnip, however flimsy and however frayed by frequent friction over raids, the emeargo and so on. It has helped towards the settlement of minor questions. It has not deterrea Ton oaad irom eniorcin 0 embargo on trade but the embargo on trade has not destroyed the Sheikh's ostensible friendliness towards Ibn Baud, aney are 1 arcades W as I once wrote and tlioy Doth couMne soue real friendship for His iajosty 's Govsrauent and a healthy fear of then with a good deal of fundamental mistrust. 5. vhe point of ay theory or speculation is that, i-l me Sheikh of Kowait were at all willing to he -asirized', Ibn Sauu could iiiake the proposed gaite attractive on the following lines, if I may venture to put into his mouth the sort of language he could use:- (a) 'You are not really inuependem, aty dear fello .. You a.-. a-uv i i qh ' 'hev miaht annex you at 51 are under tne tamio oi the .ngiisn. ^ &lt;=&gt; 'anyj 'any moment or even present you to Iraq, If you must 'be 'dependent on some one, v/hy 'be dependent on those untrustworthy 'imperialists, when you might depend, without 'being exactly 'dependent, on a man like me, old friend, fellow Moslem, fellow 'Arab and the one 'big independent man in Arabia'.. (b) 'I don't like squeezing you, I really don't, with that 'embargo. As things are at present I have to think of my own 'interests. But if your interests were mine, we could easily 'have an understanding, a sort of 'Zollverein' as they say: 'same duties levied in our ports; free competition 'between 'yours and rniue; free trade over our land border. 'That have 'the English done about it? Nothing, because they cannot get 'at me. Sois mon frere, e t je t e X c li§-. vivre, Sois le leur, 'et je te tue 1 ' □ (c) 'I should not mop you up of course. You would rule 'your state under an understanding with me a Indeed, if you 'were in with me, I might recognise a sort of influence of 'yours over those three Lost Tribes that you always want back. 'Look at how I treated the Idrisi. I made a sensible agreement 'with him in 1926. He remained a ruler with tribal influence. 'I did not take charge in his country, until he got into such 'a mess that he asked me to in 1950. I did not hit him on the 'head until the poor mutt thought he could try conclusions with 'me in 1932. He looked to foreigners and he got it in the neck 'from me' . (d) 'You have had trouble with Iraq over your property there. ' '/hat has England been able or even willing to do for you? 'If I had the right to protect you against third parties, you 'would find that I knew how to see you through.' (e) 'Then there's oil 0 People are after it in my country 'and in yours and in the neutral Zone. hy not have an agreed 'policy^ policy and prcsGnt 9. coniiiioii ipont to tli© ^ss't» You knov/ what 'the it.P.O.G. is 0 Another name for the British Government, 'as we saw in Persia the other day* even if we had not known 'it 'belore, lake my tip and keep them out at all costs® 'Play aoout v/ith Holmes, if you like. But don't trust him 'and remember tnat in the long run your 'best policy would be 'to deal like me direct with American interests, using the 'others to put up the price'. 6 0 It is easy enough to detect fallacies in the above imaginary address, I do not know enough about the Sheikh of Koweit to judge what his reaction to it would be but many an Arab, not well pleased with British protectors, might find it convincing enough to be attracted into Ibn Saud's parlour. 7. I wrote the above notes in Jedda at the end of Junee I thought them too hypothetical at that time to submit them for official consideratioiio They may, however, be worthy oi some attention now that the Political Resident and I are both in this country and Colonel Dickson will soon be available for consultation. Except that Ibn Saud continues to shew a marked anxiety to avoid all complications, I see no material reason to modify what I wrote nearly three months ago, subject always to the consideration that I merely suggest an uncertain working theory to be tested by further examination and by keeping a close watch on future developments.

A- Naoure oi' the i.inaert a king:s ^ive n. By the Agr eement of 23rd. Ja nuary 1899 His Majesty's Government formally assured the Sheikh 'of the good offices of the British Government towards you, your heirs and successors, so long as you, your heirs ana successors scrupulously and faithfully observe the conditions of the saia Bond', under which the Sheikh had pledged himself, his heirs and successors, not to receive the agent or representative of any power or government at Koweit without the previous sanction of the British Government and not to cede, sell, lease, or mortgage, or give for occupation or for any other purpose, any portion of his territory to the government or subjects of any other power without the previous consent of His Ivajesty 1 s Government. 2. By Article IX of the Secret Agreement of 15-th Octooer 1907 for tne lease of the Bunder shweikh foreshore, the Political Agent intimated that he was 'duly authorised on hehalf of the precious Imperial English Government to promise ana do hereby promise that the town of Koweit and its boundaries likewise belong to sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Huler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him, and that all Sheikh Mobarak's arrangements in the matter of customs etc. and all his arrangements at the present day shall remain in the hands of Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and of his heirs after him, and...' In consideration of this promise the Sheikh undertook not to levy customs dues in excess of 4% on goods imported or exported by 'the subjects of the aforesaid English Government' save with the approval of that Government.5. The undertakings given In writing to the sheikh on 5rd Koveiuber 1914 in return lor his cooperation against the Turks contained an assurance that 'Koweit shall he recognised as an independent principality under British protection.' S- Constr uction of the undertakings ,-i ven to the Sheikli 4* As will be seen, the engagements entered into 'by His Majesty's Government with the Sheikh are in rather general terms and it is perhaps desirable briefly to record tho constiuction placed upon tuem a o various times oy His Majesty 1 s Government. 5* In 1901, when there was a Turkish threat to Koweit the Viceroy was informed (secretary of State's telegram No,45 of 4th December 1901, p.1417/01) that this 'appears to constitute a distinct violation of the Sultan's promise' (to respect the status quo) 'and in these circumstances His Majesty's Government are prepared to support the Sheikh ana will not tolerate an attack by Turkish troops or ships upon Koweit. The Sheikh should not leave Koweit and should continue to observe his engagement with us'. The assurance given is clearly limited by the words 'in these circumstances' to this particular case. Moreover, it is not conditional on and is independent of the sheikh 1 s observance of his Agreement of 1899. On 21st March 1903 Lord Lansdov&amp;ie, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in a Memorandum on the situation in Koweit remarked that our obligations towards the Sheikh were 'as ill-defined as the boundaries of his Principality. We have distinctly announced that he does not enjoy British 'protection'; on the other hand we once made him a present of £1,000, and promised him our ' goo a offices' whatever that may mean. When we made this promise we were, I feel no doubt, thinking/JL I - 3 - thinking of Koweit proper, if there is such a thing,and not of Boobyan or other outskirts over which the Sheikh has rights of one sort or another...We might it seems to me * explain (1) to the Porte (3) to the Sheikh, and (3} to the foreign Powers immediately interested the objects of our policy. I bliquid ije inclineo. to say that our engagements to Koweit do not extend beyond the district adjoining or close to the bay of that name and to endeavour to obtain the adhesion of the Porte and of the Sheikh to our approximate • definition of that district...' 7* Later in 1902 it was reported that Ibn Rashid was making energetic preparation for attacking Ibn Baud, then the Sheikh of Koweit 1 s friend, said the Sheikh was warned not to take any action likely to bring him into difficulties with either Nejd or Turkey. About the same time the sheikh informed us that IbnEss-nu had with him a gun presented by the Turks and asked for a gift of 2 or 3 guns which it was understood were wanted for Jehara to protect Koweit against /OZ land attack. The Viceroy (telegram No.39 of 3rd October 1902) proposed to reply that the Sheikh's request could not be granted, 'but that provided he c omplied with the injunction conveyed to him in pursuance of your telegram of 4th December 1901 (see paragraph 5 above) His Iva j e sty f s Government would charge themselves with the defence of Koweit district.' The Secretary of State after consultation with the Foreign Office (P.O. letter of loth October 1902) replied (telegram No.133 of 14th October 19 02) 'I approve your proposed reply about the guns, provided Koweit district is clearly defined as the district adjoining or close to the bay of that name.' This assurance similarly admits of being read as an assurance ad hoc , and it is relevant that when, in April 1911, enquiry was made by the Secretary of State for India of the Government of/a/s t3 G /I.telrn. 51.3.11. 3/S for I. to Viceroy telni, 1/- 18.3,11.

The more specific undertakings embodied in the Bunder ohweikh lease of 1907 and Quoted in paragraph 2 above may be regarded as to some extent conmitting us in respect of 'the town of Koweit and its boundaries', ihe phrase 'its boundaries' is, hov/ever, very vague, and eould perhaps most reasonably be construed as applying to tne irmiediate district around Koweit town. The discussions as to our obligations to the oheikh which took place in 1911 and which are summarised in paragraphs 9 to 1^ oelow, appear to have turned essentially on the undertakings ol 1899. 9/ In 1911, in connection with the jmglo-Turkish negotiations, the question of our obligations was examined in some detail. , ^ . ... The Government oi India, on being askea, with reference to Lord Lansdowne's Memorandum oi 190^ to which reference is made in paragraph 6 above, to 'aefine the region to which-our obligation extends, and 'wnether tney accepted' general description of boundaries in Persian G-ulf Gazetteer, page 1059 etc;' replied 'We are oi opinion that (1) our obligations extend to the limits oi tne Sheikh s territory, (2) these limits, to the best of our knowledge, are defined with fair accuracy by Lorimer, especially as regards northern portion...' 10, The Secretary of State for India in the light of the Government of India's views, wrote as follows to the Foreign Office (p.594/11, 8th April 1911); 'Viscount/1 'Viscount Morley is not aware on what grounds the opinion \ M expressed by the Marquess of Lansdowne in his memorandum of 21st March 1902 is based, but he observes that the language used is very tentative, and, so far as he knows, the subject was never pursued along the lines suggested by His Lordship, except in the case of the attack on the immediate neighbourhood of Koweit threatened by Ibn Pashid in the autumn of 1902. It will be seen from the Government of India's telegram of 6 April that this incident does not affect their opinion that our general obligations extend, to the limits of Koweit territory as described in Vol/II pp.1059-1061 of LorinBr^s G-azetteer of the Persian Gulf, copy of which is in your possession. In this Lord Mor ley concurs: that is to say he thinks that in the event of unprovoked aggression by the Turks or ' by Ar ab tr ib e s under Tur ki sh co ntro 1, upo n tho se 1 irni t s, H.M.G. could not abstain from using their 'good offices' in the Sheikh's favour. But the term 'good offices' is a very vague one, which H.M.G. are at liberty to interpret at their discretion, and which they would doubtless interpret with more or less strictness according to the nature and locality of the aggression, and all the circumstances of the case. It would, however, in His Lordship's opinion, be very impolitic to attempt, in dealing with the Sheikh, to whittle down the extent of our obligations, since such a course would fill his mind with suspicions and could not fail to affect o ur unfavourably^prestige in the Persian Gulf \ o 489/ q 11, The F.O .replied on 9 May 1911 that Sir iC.Grey concurred 'in the view of the Government of India., shared by Viscount Morley, that these obligations extend to the whole territory of the Sheikh as described in the passage of Lorimer's Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf to which your letter refers.' 12./) ■\iy h i 6 12. In Aug: 1911 the Government of India, after consultation with the Political Resident (Sir P.Cox) ^ recommended that should communicate to the Turks ' iceroy a copy of the Agreement of 1899 with a note that h.M.U-.had ^or^I^ subsequently informed the Sheikh that so long as he and his De 1 of 50 Aup heirs and successors acted up to their obligations under the i1 P 1446/ 11 Agreement, we charged ourselves to support them and to protect Koweit against attack by land or sea. 5 ' The Secretary of State for India, on closer consideration, founa himself unable to accept this proposal. India Office letter to the Foreign Office of 30th October,1911, P.1446/11, remarked: 'The telegrams of 4th December lyQl and 14th October 1902, on which the Government of India appear to base the obligation to protect Koweit by land ana sea, in the Marquis of Crewe's opinion clearly refer only to the incidents that occasioned them and cannot be understood uo have given any general undertaking. Nor, in view of the fact that it has since been decided that our obligations extend to the whole of the Sheikh's territory as describee, in Lorimer's G-azetteer, would it be safe to pledge ourselves to any specific method of defending them. As was pointed out by Lord Morley in this Office letter of 8th April last, uno term 'good offices' (which by Colonel Meade's letter of 2urd January 1899 we undertook to accord to the Sheikh)is a conveniently vague one and Lord Crewe is oi opinion that it is neither necessary nor safe to go beyond it. ine action taken by H.M.G-. in 1901/02, when men and. guns were landed at Koweit to defend it against unprovoked iurkisn aggression, will, moreover, have made it plain to the Porue in what ay we are prepared to interpret the term it necessity arises. 'His Lordship would therefore suggest that the formula should run: 'As regards No.l, have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that so long as he and his heirs and successors/successors act up to their obligations under the Agreement, TT .M,(j. undertake to support them and accord them their good ^ officeswith perhaps the addition that H.M.G-. reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion,' The Foreign Office (F.O.letter dated 1st November 1911) accepted the proposed redraft and addition and a communication in this sense was made to Tewfik Pasha in Sir EdY/ard Gray's letter of 24th October 1911(42135). 13. The undertaking given in 1914 that Koweit 'shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection' may be regarded as importing a degree of responsibility for the protection of the principality as a whole, 14. On the death of Sheikh Mobarak his eldest son was informed in March 1916 on his accession by the Viceroy that n so long as you act up to the existing arrangements with the British Government you'may expect the same support as was 13, enjoyed by your father,' A similar assurance was given on .15, Sheikh Jabir's death in 1917 to his brother and successor, 13, Sheikh Salim, in March 1917. Sheikh Salim's conduct was .18, unsatisfactory and it was found necessary to warn him,through the Political Resident, on 5th July 1918, that the assurances (which presumably covered the assurance of 3 Nov. 1914) conveyed to him on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour and that should acts 'contrary to the interests of (His Majesty's Government' 'unfortunately be 13, committed in future' he would be held personally responsible. '.20. 15. In connection with the operations against the Ikhwan in 1928 the question of the precise extent of the obligations of H.M.G.for the defence of Koweit was considered innfche India Office, when the view was put forward that 3f.P,G. ^2,p. consideration of our engagements suggested that on a strict 32 para. reading our liability could be confined to the protection of/@ ^ I - 8 - of the town of Koweit and that we ars not called upon to protect Koweit territory as a whole. Con clus ion., 16. As will be seen from the correspondence summarised above (a) we appear consistently to have taken the view that our obligations are conditional on the good behaviour of the Sheikh; (b) secondly, ' subject to this reservation, we are committed to 'good offices 51 in respect of 'Koweit an assurance which has since 1911 been accepted as extending to the whole territory of the Sheikhdom, but which would not commit us to anything further than diplomatic support; (c) thirdly, we have promised 'that the town of Koweit and its boundaries' 'belong to ' the heirs of Sheikh Mobarak; (while the payment of rent for the Bunder Shweikh : site was terminated in 190-7, the Agreement of 1907 was not abrogated, and the reciprocal pledges embodied in that Agreement should apparently still be regarded as binding in so far as they are not affected by other subsequent instruments. We communicated Article IX of the Eunder Shweikh Agreement to Ibn Saud in 1928: and in 1933 the P.A.Koweit and the Political Resident brought to notice the continued e; istence of the obligations of the Sheikh in regard to Customs duties(para,2 above) under Article X of the Agreement) (d) fourthly,that we have undertaken to recognise, and have in fact recognised, Koweit as an independent principality under British protection. No definition has been given or attempted of the meaning of 'British protection' in this connection; and while prima fa.cie the Sheikh might apparently be justified in claiming that it represented an assurance of effective protection in respect of the v.^ole of his principality, there is some room for discussion as to its precise implications, and it is noteworthy that no appeal rppears to have been made under it either by the present Sheikh or by his predecessors.

Si:ntnR of Basidu o The .Tiemorandum attached sets out in some detail the relevant facts since 1720 in -0 far as they are on record bearing on the status of the British concession au Basidu in the Island of Kishm in the Persian Oulf. The concession in question is held under a written grant Ox 1820 from the Imam of Mur-cat, at that period in effective possession of Kibhm. The essential point in issue is whether the Imam in making the grant in question in 1820 did so as sovereign of Kishm or in his capacity as a tenant of Persia. 24 Tne :::atter was closely investigated in 1821, hy an officer specially deputed to the Persian Uilf consequent on Persian protests against the landing of a British detachment in the Island of Ki^hm under the authority granted by the Imam, Great difficulty was even at that period experienced in reaching any positive conclusion as to the strength or weakness of the Imam's claims to sovereignty. The aifficulty in establishing the true facts is hardly less to-day. A survey of the correspondence as a whole and of the history of the island of Kishm, in which Basidu is situated, in the century preceding 1820 tends to suggest that the basis for the Imam's claims is unsubstantial* -1720-1794 . 3. According to Lorimer's G-azetteer of the Persian Gulf, which is the accepted authority on the history of the Gulf States, and which is based on exhaustive local researches some 30 years ago by an officer of the I.C.3. of great experience, it does not appear that the Arabs of the Oman Coast were much in evidence in/in the neighbourhood of Bandar Aubas, or anywhere on the Persian side of the G-ulf, before the Afghan invasion of Persia which began in 1720e Consequent on the Afghan invasion in that year the Arabs of the Trucial Goast (also described on this occasion as the 'Muscateers established themselves in Basidu in the island of Kishm, in which they were attacked and defeated by a British naval force in April 1727. But Nadir Shah of Persia in 1737 not merely overran the South Persian coast, and so reimposed an effective Persian control over areas such as the island of Kishm, but extended his conquests across the G-ulf and in 1737-8 occupied the Sultanate of Muscat, from which Persia was expelled only in 1744. 4 # In 1747 the Persian Governor of Bunder Abbas and its dependencies entered into an alliance with the Jowasimi Arabs of the Trucial Arab coast; consequent on which those Arabs appear to nave established them selves between 1750 and 1765 in various posts in the island of Kishm. But they were expelled from Kishm about 1765 and the other dependencies of Bandar Abbas by Sheikh Abdulla, who had been appointed ruler of that area by the Persian Vakil in S. Persia, and they had not regained their position so late as 1780. 5. From the above it will be seen that there appears to have been no Arab connection of importance (as distinct from piratic raids) with the S. Persian Goast, and with Islands such as Kishm, at any rate for a considerable period prior to 1720: that between 1720 and 1794 Arab invaders (apparently normally from the present Trucial Oman and not from the Muscat Inamate) were established for varying periods the total of which does not appear to have exceeded some 20 years, in Kishm Island or in Basidu/% -1 3. Ba-idu; that during the bulk even of that period they were in occupation as the mercenaries of the local Persian ruler; and that theres is no suggestion at any stage of an abandonment by Persia of her claims to sovereignty over Bunder Abbas and its dependenciesj including Kishnu It would appear difficult, if not impossible, on the facts recorded to base any Muscat claim to sovereignty over Kishm on the history of that Island between 1720 and 1794» 179^-1820 . ■i % 'Arabs but Persian aubjects) 6. In the year 1794, the Imam of Muscat x defeated the Bani Ma ! in rulers of Kishm and Ormuz and consequent on this victory was able to secure the transfer to himself by Persia of the revenue lease of Bunder Abbas and its dependencies Precisely what was covered by the term 'dependencies H is not very clear. But there seema a very strong probability, almost amounting to a certainty, that it included the island of Kishm and so Basidu. Further, while the Imam appears to have secured the lease as a result of his victory over the Bani Ma f in it is to be noted that he secured from Persia a lease and not a grant, that a substantial annual rental was paid for the lease and that, according to Lorimerj ,y a surety for payment seems to have been required by the Persian Grovernment/ 8 9 .0 mm4. Government from the Saiycd and to have been provided hy him in the person of a Persian merchant or banker named Haji Khalat 11 . The liulers of Muscat temporarilj^ lost control of some, if not all, of the areas covered by the lease, on the death of Saiyed Sultan in 1804, and while they were to some extent reinstated with British support in 1805 and again in 1806 the available records do not make it clear whether they in fact exercised effective dominion even as tenants of Persia in the whole of the area covered by their revenue lease of 1794 so late as 1818, In the latter year the pirate i^rabs of the Trucial Coast, who are not under Muscat control, were apparently proposing to establish themselves at Basidu as a stronghold which could be held against the Egyptians, and were led to abandon this intention largely because of the defeat by one of the Bast India Company f s ships of one of their squadrons towards the end of that year. 7. This record suggests that while the ruling family of Muscat did indeed secure from Persia in 1794 a revenue lease which almost certainly included the island of Kishm, their effective occupation of that island prior to the grant in 1820 by the Imam, quoted in paragraph 21 of the Memorandum attached, was subject to lengthy interruptions. It would be as difficult in these circumstances to base any claim by Muscat to absolute ownership or sovereignty in Kishm on the history of the period 1794 to 1820 as it would to base a similar claim on the history of the island in the period 1720 to 1794,5, OorrespondenQQ of 1819 to 1822 . 8. When the Government of Bombay decided in 1819 that in the interests of the suppression of piracy it would he advantageous to establish a central station in the G-ulf and that the island of Kishm was geographically the best situatea for this purpose, the question of the status of the island at once came up for consideration. The correspondence which passed between the Local Government, their officers in the Persian G-ulf, and the Teheran Legation, the relevant extracts from which are contained in the memorandum attached, makes it clear that the viev/s of the Government of Bombay as to the uncertainty of the Persian title to Kishm were sincere and real, and ,that when they finally so far deferred to the claims of Persia as to arrange that the British detachment should be removed from Kishm, they did so formally without prejudice to the claims of the Imam of Muscat over that island. The loading document on the subject is the report of 14th iiUgust 1821 by Dr. Jukes, who was specially sent from Bombay to investigate this, among other aspects of the Kishm question, the Report, in view of its importance, is given in full in paragraph 29 of the memorandum attached. Dr. Jukes, while elaborating the arguments in support of the Muscat claim and in particular emphasising the statement made to him by the Confidential Secretary to the then Imam of Muscat that ''neither Kishm, Ormuz, nor Larak/6. I^rs-K arc spcoificd on the receipts annudlly granted by the Persian Government for the stipulated sum paid to them' and the Imam's statement that 'the islands of Kishm, Ormuz and Larak belonged exclusively to the Imam n , admits tnat he was unable u to obtain a sight of the old Persian Purmauns by which His Highness the Imam farms Bunder Abbassee from the Sovereign of Persia, in order to asccrtein what places are particularly specified as constituting its dependencies. I think it unlikely chat such an important document. e .should not be in existence; it is possible that it may have been mislaid at the time I was at Muscat or it might have been intentionally withheld.., 5 ' I)r. Jukes rightly concludes that 'the claims of Persia to the islands of Kishm, Ormuz, etc. seem to rest entirely upon their being considered as dependencies of Bunder iJobassee /and not on Persian claims as to suzerainty over Muscat itself/. Tnese points I have not yet been able to ascertain, but it is quite evident that the Imam is not disposed to acknowledge the right of Persia to the islands in question and it is, I believe, the universal law of nations to claim as a right that which they have obtained by the sword.' Dr. Jukes f s premature death in November, 1821, and the fact that a modus vivendi was for the moment reached by Persia in regard to the future of the British detachment appears to have prevented any more exact examination of the rival claims of Muscat and of Persia to the overlordship of Kishm being proceeded with* i^s will be seen, his remarks arc by no means conclusive on the point now in issue. The Muscat claims to which he refers were unsupported by any documentary evidence, though this should/4L should not have been difficult to produce; in so far as those claims arc based on right of conquest, (i.e. presumably on the forcible occupation by Muscat in 1794 of Bunder Abbas and its dependencies) they appear to be vitiated by the fact that the Imams of Muscat used their victory merely to secure a revenue lease and not a grant in sovereignty of the areas affected. Finally in estimating the importance of Dr. Jukes^s report, the comments on it of Mr, Lorimer, who in matters such as this speaks with authority, are relevant. He says n Ls his (Dr. Jukes's) investigations were conducted chiefly under the auspices of Oman officials, whose statements he would be inclined to accept, his report dated 14th August 1821 can hardly be regarded otherwise than as an ex pails, document, but as such it is of interest 10. The general effect of the correspondence which is set out in extonso in the accompanying memorandum is to suggest that there was in 1819 some degree of genuine doubt as to where the true title to Kishm lay, but that such doubts were based on statements made by the Imam of Muscat unsupported by any written document such as the text of the firman granting the revenue lease. On the facts available it is, I suggest, difficult to feel that the Muscat claim has been established, or that it has any solid foundation either in history or in lav;.. ^ to 1928. 11. It may be convenient briefly to refer to the more important points bearing on the question of title/titlo between the reoccupation of Basidu by H.M.Gr, in 1823 and the reassertion of a Persian claim in 1928. The most important are the terms of the re-lease of Bandar ibbas and its dependencies (including Kishm) by Persia to Muscat in 1855; iJftides 2 and 14 of the Treaty of Paris of 1857; the reference to Basidu in the Telegraph x-igreement of 1864 with Muscat, the terms of the further lease granted to Muscat by Persia in 1868, and the Government of India*3 pronouncement as to the status of Basidu in 1868# 12, While the G-overnment of India's pronouncement is of much importance as indicating the considered view taken by them at that period, it is conceivable that it may have been made without close enquiry into the claims of Muscat to sovereignty in Kishm - an issue which was probably in their view of little active importance, since in 1855 Muscat had abandoned any independent rights she might have had in Kishm to Persia; and it cannot of course by itself have any decisive value. Of greater importance are the Firmans of 1855 and 1868, the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1857, and the Telegraph ijgreement of 1864j| a,nd the facts that \ (a) the re-lease by Persia to Muscat of Bunder/4 9. ^ Bunder Abbas and its dcpGndcnciGs, including specifically Kishm, in 1855 makes no reference to the British station at Basidu, although certain articles of the re-lease are so worded as to appear as being inconsistent with the retention by HJuGr. of military forces and stations in Basidu; (b) the Treaty of Paris provides for the evacuation by British troops in certain events which come to pass of 'all ports, places and is lands h belonging to Persia. Basidu was not however evacuated, nor does it appear that our failure to evacuate led to any rerionstrance from Persia, (c) The telegraph agreement between and Muscat of 1864, specifically saves the Title of H.M .Gr. to Basidu ''that station having been freely granted to the British Government by my late father on behalf of himself, his heirs and successors'. (d) the re-lease of Bunder iibbas of 1868 repeats and, if anything, emphasises the articles in the lease of 1855 referred to above. 13. It is noteworthy moreover that in the period 5.823-1928 not only does it appear that there was no challenge even in general terms by Persia to our special position or rights in Basidu but that we appear in 1905 and again in 1930 to have referred without contradiction to the concession as British territory in communications to the local Persian customs officials« Ooi^clusiQru/10. OonclusiQn . 14, The general impression left as the resu of a close investigation of the relevant correspondence is that the claims of the Imam oi Muscat to have held Kishm, and so BGLsidu in sovereignty at any recent period are probably ill founded, and that it would be difficult to fight a case on the material at our disposal; that on this assumption the grant to us of the island of Kishm (ultimately in practice restricted to the occupation of Basidu) in 182C was made by the Imam in his capacity of a tenant of Persia that this being the case Persia must be regarded as having tacitly confirmed in 1855 and again in 1868 the grant of the concession though without specifically prejudicing her own claims in regard to sovereignty; and that in the circumstances such rights as we may possess in the area and such title as wg may be able to claim to it must be based on (a) unchallenged occupation for over a century; (b) the tacit recognition by Persia of our position constituted by the phrasing of the Persian Leases to Muscat of 1855 and 1868, -irticles 2 and 14 of the Treaty of Paris of 1857, i.rticle 6 of the ijiglo-Musoat Telegraph .ugrccment of 1864, and such minor incidents as the assertions made apparently unchallenged by us from time to time that the station was British territory and its waters British territorial O I waters. It is for the Lav/ Officers to advise, if/) y .. OUJ J 11. if the view suggested above as to the status of British Basidu is accepted as correct, whether wc can decline to evacuate the concession save on our own terms in view of the length of the period of uninterrupted and unchallenged occupation, and the degree of recognition of our special position which the minor incidents referred to above might be held to constitute; and to say what if any rights wc are entitled to exercise in it, and in particular whether we are justified in regarding it as British territory and its waters as British territorial waters, so long as we remain in possession.

According to Lorimer's Gazetteer the Arabs r.i. 79,631. of the Omam Coast do not appear to have been much in evidence in the neighbourhood of Bunder Abbas or indeed on the Persian side of the Gulf before the Afghan invasion of Persia which began in 1720. About 1720 certain islands including apparently Kishm were seized by the 'Muscateers'. A Persian army under Luft Ali Khan was sent into the interior of Bunder Abbas but returned north to Kirman in consequence of the Afghan invasion of Persia without having effected anything^the Arab invaders apparently remaining in possession, r.i.96,135,6S1. 2. In April, 1727 a British naval expedition exacted compensation from the Jowasimi Shaikh Rashid (probably the Shaikh of Ras-el-Khaimah) for losses occasioned to the East India Company's factory at Bunder Abbas by the establishment by the Jowasimis of a naval port at Basidu. &gt;r. i.84,88,632. 3. In 1737 Nadir Shah of Persia crossed the Gulf and overran Oman from which the Persians were finally expelled only in 1744. In 1747 on the decease of Nadir Shah, Mullah Ali Shah, who had been Governor of Bunder Abbas and its dependencies under him called in the assistance of the Jowasimi Arabs to help him to maintain his position against inter alios the hereditary ruler of Lar and appear to have entered into a sort of alliance with them which subsisted at least until 1763. It is probably (according to Lorimer) consequent on this that the Arabs of the Oman Coast obtained a foothold on2. Lor. 1.135 on the island of Kishm. &gt;TI In June 1760 the Jowasimi ? who appear by then to have established themselves at Kishm and Luft in the island of Ki&amp;hm and also at Lingah and Shanas on the coast of the 95 - mainland to the west, assisted Mullah Ali Shah against Bunder Abbas, the fort of which was then held by the Khan of Lar. In 1763 xviullah Ali Shah is reported as being in possession oi the j.ort of Kishm, the record stating also that he had spent all nis substance in the three previous years in subsidies to rtas-e 1 -Khaimah» In the same year a treaty was concluded between the Bani Ma 1 in on the one side and Mullah Ali Shah and the Jowasimi Arabs on the other, one provision of which was that the revenues of Kishm should be equally divided between .135 the three parties in future. 110 4. About 1765 Kerim Khan, Zand, the Persian Vakil of this area, had appointed Shaikh Abdulla of the . 633 1^25 Local tribe or family of the Bani Ma'in (elsewhere described by lorimer as an Arab tribe, but Persian subjects) as Ruler over Bunder Abbas, Ormuz and Kishm, and this Shaikh, who was still ruling in 1780, • 6 33 succeeded about 1765 in expelling the Jowasimi and other intruders from his dominions and was able during his lifetime to keep them at a distance. In 1777 the Shaikh Sagar of Ras-el-Khaimah, on his accession, married a daughter of Shaikh Abdulla and so adjusted his differences with the Bani Ma'in family. •1^4 5. In 1769 Kerim Khan, Zand, demanded and was refused a renewal of the tribute paid by Oman during the time of Nadir Shah, and hostilities arising from this refusal continued for some years after this date.lit4L '0 '4 \ 0 \ J sqf : O-J i.:3 4 148 i.421-22 i ,422 i .175 i.180 6. In 1794 Saiyid Sultan, a new Ruler of Muscat, found himself strong enough to add Swadur and Ghahbar on the Makran coast to his dominions proper and consequent on his defeat of the Bani Ma*in rulers of Kishm and Ormuz in a sea battle, to secure the transfer to himself by Persia from ttB Sheikh of the Bani Ma 1 in, a Persian vassal, of the revenue lease of Bunder Abbas, and its dependencies. The dependencies at this state included, according to Lorimer, (who had of course before him the Muscat claim to Kishm and Ormuz referred to in Dr. Jukes 1 s report of August 1821 quoted in para» 29 below), Minab and the islands of ICishm, Ormuz and Henjam: the lease 'if it was formally granted' appears to have been granted (probably, according to Lorimer, because it could not be refused) either by Aga Muhammad Khan, Qajar, or by Lutf Ali Zhan Sand. The actual rental was probably not more at first than 4,000 dollars, the amount at which it still stood in 1821, A surety for its payment seems to have been required by the Persian Government from the ruler of Muscat and to have been furnished by him in the person of a Persian merchant and banker named Haji Khelat, 7. In 1800-1801 Captain Malcolm when adjusting the Commercial Treaty with Persia endeavoured, but unsuccessfully, to obtain from Persia a cession of the islands of Kishm, Henjam and Kharag. 8. In 1804, on the death of Saiyid Sultan of Muscat the Persian port of Bunder Abbas and its dependencies which he held on lease from Persia were seized by the Bani Ma 1 in. In June 1805 a joint Muscati-British expedition which had been organised against the Jowasimi pirates of the Trucial coast before taking action against them recovered by force Bunder Abbas, and/1q) 4. and its dependencies for the Imam of Muscat, The steps thus taken for Its recovery subsequently evoked a strong protest from the i. 438-9 638. Persian Government as an act of hostility against themselves. Later in July of the same year the allies blockaded a considerable Jowasimi flotilla in the anchorage of Kishm. 9, In 1806 the Ruler of Muscat kidnapped the head of the Bani Ma 1 in, whom he carried off to Muscat and detained until Kishmand Ormuz should be i, 439 delivered up as a ransom for his release, but the Sheikh of Has al Khaimah, by throwing a force into the town of Kishm, made it impossible for the Bani Ma 1 in to comply with these terms. 184 10. In 1809 the Jowasimi were driven out of Lingah 643 ' i, 647 and Charak by the Persians and were compelled to 1930 retire to Basidu, while in the same year the Jowasimi stronghold of Luft in Kishm was captured by the British and handed over intact to an agent of the Ruler of Muscat,, 11/ The sequence of events in Kishm, and at Basidu between 1809 and 1818 is by no means clear, but in the latter year the Jowasimi pirates are reported to have entertained the idea of forming a settlement at Basidu to which they could retire if attacked by the i, 658 Egyptian invaders of the Gulf area. The execution of this scheme is believed to have been frustrated largely by the defeat in December 1818 of a Jowasimi squadron by the Company 1 s ship 'Antelope'. 12. In 1819 Gulf policy was under discussion i, 559 at Bombay. , The Government of Bombay appear to have/ i. 6575. have inclined to a scheme under v/hich the Ruler of Oman should be placed in charge for the future of the Pirate or Trucial coast and the islands of Bahrein, and should in return authorise the formation of a British settlement on the island of E!ishm and even defray the cost of maintaining it. 13, It may be noted that the Chief Secretary, Bombay, an expert official who had made a special study of Persian Gulf subjects, while agreeing as to the establishment of a British station at Kishm 1T to this end would have negotiated with the Government of Persian rather than that of Oman'. He was overruled by the local Government, but Mr, Lorimer remarks: ' T It cannot be doubted that he stood on firm ground when he insisted that his (the Imam of Muscat 1 s) claim to sovereign rights over Kishm as against Persia, was probably illfounded, TT 14./0??

IS. in a despatch of 15th December 1619 to the Government of India, the Government of Bombay remarlced with reference to the same point:- '10.. . . .We anticipate, however,- some opposition on the part of the Persian Government to that measure /forming of a British establishment in the Persian Gulf/ 7 , since it would be difficult we apprehend to satisfy that power that our views were limited to the professed object of our policy, the more especially as the Persian Governnent has manifested some degree of alarm at our contemplating the occupation of the island of Bahrein, 11.With a view to allaying these alarms and of enabling the British Envoy at Tehran to afford to the Persian Government an explicit and candid exposition of the objects to which the expedition is exclusively directed&amp; Qj 7 directed and of the ultimate plan which wejcontemplate for the permanent suppression of piracy, our president has addressed a letter to Hr.Willock, (Charge d'Affaires at Tehran) of which the enclosed is a copy, which we trust will produce the effect of conciliating the Government of Persia to the arrangements which we have submitted to your consideration or to any other which Your Lordship may he pleased to prescribe, and in particular to our permanent occupation of Kishma'. X6. The despatch of 15th December 1819 to the Charge d'Affaires at Tehran, to which reference is made in the preceding paragraph, after explaining in some detail the considerations weighing with the Local Government, added '8. The Imam of Muscat having asserted a positive claim to, the sovereignty of the Island of Kishma, tnis Government has not hesitated in fixing upon that station as a rendez-vous for the expedition. The occupation by the British Government of a more commanding station in the Gulf being considered to be indispensable to enable us to exercise a more immediate and efficient controx over it than can be done either from Bushire or Massora, the possession of that island would be an important object either permanently in full sovereignty, or temporarily until the beneficial effects which the presence of a British force in the vicinity of the piratical ports may be expected to produce, in reforming their habits, may enaole us to relinquish the possession. The latter expedient should xn my opinion be preferred only on a failure of obtaining the cession of Kistoa in perpetuity. 9, I entertain no doubt that the cession of Kishma might be obtained from the Imam of Muscat provided his Highness's pretensions to it be indisputable, buu I believ that the sovereignty of the island was at one time claimed/a n claimed bj Persia, and under any circumstances 1 am satisfied that tne Supreme uovernment v/ould not unless on extreme emergency be inclined to take any measure regarding the occupation of that island, which you might conceive to be permanently injurious to our general interests at the Court of Tehran# ^•0. fou must be the best judge whether we are required either by justice or policy to negotiate the previous consent of Persia, or whether we may content ourselves with the simple explanation of our views and intentions; in either case after the above exposition of the motives which impel us to depart from the principles which governed our interposition in the expedition of 1810, and which its entire failure in eradicating piracy has imposed upon us. I must leave to your experience, judgment and address to adopt the line of conduct which may most effectually reconcile the important object of eradicating piracy, with the maintenance of the good understanding that so happily exists between His Majesty's Government and the Court of Persia.' 17. A copy of this despatch was also sent to Sir W.G, Keir&gt; with the remark that f, 4,....^By the 8th paragraph you will perceive the nature of the relations which it appears to the Governor in Council to be expedient that we should form with the Imam cf Muscat. The 9th and 11th paragraphs relate to the interests of Persia, and you will be guided in the prosecution of your operations or your negotiations with the ports and islands which may be disposed to acknowledge its allegiance by the communications you may receive from the Envoy at Tehran.. v^ ...It is the intention of the Governor in Council to reduce the foice under your command....at as early a period as practicable. , , leaving, as you are authorised to do, one 'battalion of native infantry and a detail of artillery should you judge it necessary at Kishma or any other eligible island with the view of overawing the Arab tribes'.\ vf (--J i &gt; Precis S .235A Precis S .236 Precis S.237 10. 18, Sir W,G, Keir's reply to the Government of Bombay t s Despatch of 28th October 1819 referred to in paragraph 14 above does not appear to have discussed the question of the status of Kishm, but he repeated (para.17) in strong terms an earlier recommendation that the eventual removal of the British detachment 'should be to the Island of Kishm, All that I have learned since offering that recommendation has tended to confirga my opinion of that Island being the most favourable situation in every respect, and if no other circumstances existed than those of political expediency^ I should be disposed to urge that the removal should take place immediately', (Despatch dated 1st April 1820). 19, In the light of the Despatch referred to in the preceding paragraph, the Governor of Bombay instructed Captain Thompson, the Commander of the garrison at Ras-al- Khaima, that its removal to the island of Kishm, to the occupation of which the consent of the Imam of Muscat was to be obtained, if not already conceded, had now been approved, (Bombay letter dated 17th April 1820) . With this letter, was enclosed a letter to the Imam from the Governor, the text of which is not availaole, 20, On 15th May 1820, Captain Thompson reported that he had despatched the 'Mercury' with the Governors letter to the Imam, and also his own letter to His Highness for the purpose of obtaining his consent to the occupation of the island of Kishm, In a letter of 29th May, Caotain Thompson reported that the 'Mercury' had returned on that date from Muscat, bearing the full consent of the Imam to the removal of the troops to Kishm, una an open letter to the Sheiich of that island directing him to afford/X 11. 3C1S .258 M.1936 fcis 3.241. afford every assistance to the embarkation and conveyance of the troops. 21. ihe material portions of the Imam's letter to the Governor ot Bombay are as follows: 'With regard to the ooservations made oy you, connected with the removal of the troops from Ras-a1~Khaima to Kishm, God knows that the Island in question, and all other territories, appertaining to me and subject to my authority, appertain also to the Honourable Company, and that I do not reckon these dominions as appertaining to me, hut as appertaining to the Honourable Company'. &amp; 21 . The Imam's letter is, as will he noted, in very general terms, and couched in hyperbolical language not unusual in Oriental communications; and v/hich would, indeed on a strict interpretation, cover not only Kishm, hut Muscat itself. On the other hand the letter was with specific reference to a request (the terms of which are not on record) for the removal to Kishm of the British detachment stationed in the Gulf. 28. The Persian Government on a communication heing made to them in accordance with the instructions referred to in paragraph 16 above, made it clear that they by no means welcomed ths idea of a British occupation of Kishm or any other Island in the Gulf. The Shah refused a personal interview to the Charge d'Affaires and communicated his instructions on the point through his Ministers. These were to the effect (Tehran Despatch of 10th May 1820), that when the proposal had oeen previously made (in 1800-1) for the cession of an Island in the Persian Gulf, the Shah had not been prepared to entertain it; that His Imperial Majesty considered that a proposal of such importance as the present was one which ought to originate either from His Britannic Majesty, from the East India Company, or f rom the Governor-Genei al of India* that according to tho Persian Ambassador at London, the Prince Regent intended to send an Ambassadoi go ieheran, and that it would be preferable that a discussion should be deferred until the AmDassador ! s an ival. liis iviajesty was surprised that the Irnaiii of Muscat should claim the sovereignty of the Island of Kishm. It was contended that the Imam held the government of Gambrun, (Bunder Aooas;, and of its dependencies, of which Kishm was one, under the supreme authority of the Sovereign of Persia, and the records of the .Empire would e stablish this fact, ,f 23. In their despatch of 3rd October, 1820, No.1485, to Sir Henry V /illock, at Teheran, the Bombay Government, after notifying the transfer of the British detachment from Ras-al-Khaima to Kishm, remarked:- ir 3. I have already had the honour of informing you that any claims which Persia might possess to the sovereignty of the Island of Kishm would receive the most candid consideration from the Government, but I do not consider it politic on our part to renew the discussion. Should any proofs of its claim be produced 'by the Government of Tehran, I would suggest your referring them to this Government, and should hope that during the that must he occuxoied by the requisite investigation, the King of Persia will have leisure to observe the good effects arising from our occupation of this land;and be induced to consent to our retaining it, even if he should estaDli.sh his right to demand its evacuation', 24. On the 20th December, 1820, Sir Henry Wil-lock reported to the Government of India that consequent oil strong representations from the Prince-Governor of Pars as to the dangers of the occupation at apart of Kishm by the British detachment the Persian Government had demanded.13 25./ demanded, in a strongly worded Note dated 9th December 1820, of which the following is an extract, the immediate departure of the British detachment from that Island '...His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires likewise stated that after punishment of the Joasmis it would he necessary still to keep some British troops in the Persian Gulf to prevent a recurrence of piracy, and that the Imam of Muscat (who on that part of Persia,- is the Governor of Bunder Abhas and its dependencies) was willing to allow of a British settlement on the Island of Kishm or Henjam; to this was answered tha.t fir^t Muscat is a dependency of Persea, and as the Imam has not the power of permitting the residence of British troops at Muscat, much less can he grant a permission at Kishm and Henjam, which are dependencies of Bunder Abbas At this time we have heard that a British force has landed at Kishm. The state of affairs does not require the presence of British troops We do not know on what account the troops from India have settled in the Persian Gulf...... In short orders will be issued by His Majesty to His Royal Highness the Prince of Pars, to send a person to the troops on Kishm desiring them immediately to leave it, and we now request His Majesty's Charge d r Affaires to direct the Officer Commanding at Kishm to return to India with his troops, and to write to the Honourable Governor of Bombay, or to whomever it may be necessary, with a view to avoiding such acts, which are contrary to the spirit of the Treaty between our two States4. ■—TTx Tr— i 14. 1 25. The Governor of Bombay Sir Mountstuart Elphinstone noted on this correspondence as follows: Precis 'The King of Persia's claim to Kishm does not appear S 250-56 D to be strengthened by his present arguments, but on the contrary to be weakened by His Majesty's making it in part depend on his sovereignty over Muscat, a pretension which seems to be entirely untenable. The King of Persia's alarm at our occupation of Kishm appears however, to be serious and unfeigned, and on this ground the Honourable the Governor would be disposed to give up the measure if it were not one of urgent necessity. It is believed also that the British Government has in some measure countenanced the claim of the King of Persia to Kishm by requesting from His Majesty in the year 1799, the cession of that Island. The application seems not (? but) to have originiated in an erroneous notion of His Majesty's rights, but it ought to make this Government more delicate in its conducat at present 26. Apparently at the beginning of 1821 a Vakil of the Prince Governor oi Shiraz visited KishJi, Lor.i.1939 consequent on unfounded allegations that the British were building forts there, to prohibit their construction. He satisfied himself that there was no foundation for the report, and undertook to assure his master that the British detachment had evidently no other duty than that of checking piracy. In/(lOl) 15. 27. In May 1821 Dr. ^ndrew Jukes was deputed to the Persian Gulf by the Government of Bombay with a view to allaying the suspicions of the Persian Government in regard to the retention of the British force on the island of Kishm. The following extracts from his instructions bear on the question of the title to the Island. ,? 1. You are already informed of the doubts which are being entertained in regard to the sovereignty over the Island of Zishm to which the Governments of Persia end Muscat assert pretensions. The former having recently betrayed the strongest apprehensions at our occupation of it, and nreferred a formal demand for the removal of x the detachment, as you will perceive from the accompanying despatch dated 20th December from Hie Majesty's Charge d'affaires at Teheran... the Hon'ble the Governor in Council determined to despatch you on a mission to the Persian Gulf with the view of allaying these unfounded claims or of adopting such measures as the exigencies of the case may render expedient.».• 3, Equally solicitous has the Governor in Council been to ascertain the justness of the claim which the Imam of Muscat advanced to the Sovereignty of xvishm, the result of Captain Stiuleir'^ enquiries leading the Governor to believe those claims to be well founded. The detachment was transferred from Basool Khima to that island with the sanction of the/(1°^ 16. the Imam. This document will enable you to draw from the Government of Persia a statement oi the grounds on which her pretensions to Kishm may he founded, ana waich may he as untenable as her claim to tribute from Muscat which the Imam has refused to pay and Persia has been unable to exact since the death of bh ah ivb b a s • • • » 7. .Should it appear impossible to avoid hostilities by other means...you are empowered to propose to the Prince that the detachment should be withdrawn from Kishm to Muscat.,, pending the negotiation regarding the ultimate fate of it. You will explain that this concession originates in the reluctance of this Government to disturb the friendship subsisting between the British and Persian nations 9 especially on a point which has not been decided by the Governor General in Council that the removal of the troops is not to be interpreted into a recognition of the King of Persia's title to Kishm nor to act as a restraint on our reoccupying the position, if the decision of the supreme Government, or any other cause, should render such a course expedient.

About 26 or 27 years ago the inhabitants of Kishm, being dissatisfied with the tyrannical system adopted towards them by Mulla Hussan Maainee, their Chief and Governor, solicited His Highness Syed Sultan, the Imam of Maskat , to take the Islands under his government and control; the Imam proceeded accordingly with an army, and by force of arms took possession of the Islands of Kishm, Bunder Abassee and Ormuz, from Mulla Hussein, and it has ever since remained under the general control of the Imam of Maskat. 5. Syed Sultan, notwithstanding he had taken these places by force of arms from Mulla Hussein Maainee, continued to farm Bunder Abassee, and its dependencies from the Persian Government, as the Bini Maainee tribe had done before him, and his son Syed Saeed, the present Imam of Maskat, continues to do the same; he pays four thousand Tomans annually for the town and dependencies of Bunder Abassee, including Meena Humeel and Khumeer. Syfe bin Mubhaun, an Arab Chieftain, is at present Governor of Bunder Aba.ssee on the part of His Hignness the Iman, and his younger brother is the Governor of Crmuz. Sheikh Abdul Rahman Maainee, the Governor of Kishm, is related to His Highness by marriage» so that the Government of all the principa.1 places farmed by the Imam of Maskat is entirely in the hands of the Arabs at present, and I do not know whether the Persian Government would venture to risk the attempt of taking these places forcibly from them, under any circumstances, bUu as the Imam has several ships, and could command theL - — . ' (3) S o\ 19. sources (? services) of a great number of buggalas and boats belonging to the different Arab tribes in the Gulf, it is almost certain, I think, that the Imam would be able to retain the Islands of Kishm, Ormuz and Larak, in spite of every exertion of the Persian Government. 6. The whole of the Persian shore of the Gulf is in the possession of different Arab tribes, and though they may have little differences and quarrels among themselves, they would cordially unite to repel any attack the Persians might make to accept or subdue any one of them. 7. It is quite impossible that the Arab tribes and the Persians can ever cordially blend their interests and act in concert together. The habits of the people are very different, the independence of an Arab Shaikh submits reluctantly to the Persian yoke, and the difference of religious feeling effectually prevents anything like a cordial co-operation between tnem. 8. I regret extremely that neither at Maskat nor at Kishm, have I been able to obtain a sight of one of the old Persian Furmauns by which His Highness the Imam farms Bunder Abassee from the sovereign ol Persia, m order to ascertain what places are particularly specified, as constituting its dependencies. I think it unlikely that such an important document as the grant, or Furmaun of the King of Persia, by which His Highness the Imam, farms so large a portion of territory and for which he pays 4,000 Tomauns annually should not be in existence; it/4L 20. it is possible it might have been mislaid at the time I was at askat or it might have 'been intentionally withheld, but I was expressly informed by Syed Abdul Kahir, His Highness's confidential Secretary, that neither Kishm, OiTiiuz, nor Larak are specified on the receipts annually granted by the Persian G-overnment for the stipulated sum paid to them; and in reply to a series of questions which I wrote out to be answered at Maskat, and which I know were carried by Syed Abdul Kahir to His Highness the Imam himself, it was expressly declared that the Islands of Kishm, Ormuz and Larak, belonged exclusively to the Imam. 9. It appears to me extreme presumption in the Persian Government to declare that even Maskat itself is a dependency of Persia, and the information I have obtained satisfies me that Maskat never was tributary to that State; perhaps the pretensions of Persia may be grounded on the following circumstances which I obtained in det8.il from what must be considered the highest authority, the Imam itself. 10. About 78 years ago, Sultan bin Syfe Gaarubi was Imam of Maskat and the Province of Omaun; he made himself very unpopular by his tyranny, and was removed from the Government by the general voice of the people; he went and sought the aid of Madir Shah, then sovereign of Persia, to reinstate him in his Government; JTadir Shah complied with his request, and sent an army back with him to restore him to influence and to power. This army landed at Ras -sul-Khima, and after much hard fighting they succeeded in marching through the country as far as Maskat which/13./ ————^ 10 ij | A 21. which place alone seems then to have 'been retained hy the adherents of Sultan bin Syfe, while all the Province of Qnaun remained unsubdued. The independent Arabs now advanced and surrounded Maskat, and the Persian Army was reduced to considerable difficulties. About this time intelligence of the death of Nadir Shah reached them, the Persians ma.de certain proposals to the Arabs, which were finally agreed to, and the Persian Army returned back to Bundar Abassee without effecting the object of their coning. 11. In this state of affairs Ahmed bin Saed, the grandfather of the present Imam of Maskat , and then a Chieftain Camnanding at Sohar, assumed the Government of Qmaun and was proclaimed Imam. 12. The claims of Persia therefore to the Islands of Kishm, Ormuz , etc., seem to rest entirely upon their being considered as dependencies of Bunder Abassee. This point I have not yet been able to ascertain, but it is quite evident that the Imam is not disposed to acknowledge the right of Persia to the islands in question, and it is, I believe, the universal law of nations to claim as a right, that which they have obtained by the sword. Persia with equal presumption claims the Island oi .Bahrein because it was once tributary t o it, though it has thrown off the yoke, and paid no tribute for these 30 years. Persia may with equal justice lay claim to Delhi at the present day because Nadir Shah once conquered and plundered it.♦ 22. 13. In my discussions therefore with the Persian Ministers, I think I shall be able, in point of right, to support all the measures the British Government have adopted in occupying the Island of Kishm, when I consider, however, the very heavy expense of supporting the establishment, the impossibility of employing the troops on any active service in the Gulf, for four months in the year on account of the excessive heats, the sickness that has prevailed there ever since the hot weather commenced, and the inefficiency of the force arising frcm that cause alone, I confess, I feel more doubts than I have heretofore done, as to the expediency and utility of the measure; but as I am aware that different sentiments have been and probably still are, entertained by those who are far more competent to decide than I am, I beg to offer such a hint with extreme diffidence and with the most perfect conviction of the fallibility of my own judgment. ,? 30. Dr.Jukes's report, while of great value, is as will be observed, by no means conclusive. Mr.Lorimer comments that {, as his investigations were conducted chiefly under the auspices of Qtnani officials, ■whose statements he would naturally oe inclined to accept, his report, dated 14th August, 1821, can hardly be regarded as other than an ex P arte document, out as such it is of interest. 31. Dr.Jukes subsequently proceeded to Shiraz, in a letter dated 25th October 1821 fran which he refers to the Prince Governor, in tne course oj . discission as having made sonie observations regarding the IslandKtf) i 0 &gt; 23. that tne Imam was only a subject of his. The Prince however added that he had personally no objection to the British detachment remaining in Kishm, since in Lor.1.1941 view of Dr.Jukes's explanations it appeared to have the peace and tranquillity of the Gulf for its only motive, and that he would so inform the Shah. ihe i -'ersian Government however maintained tneir opposition to the maintenance of a British detachment in Kishm, and the Government of Bombay accordingly referred the general question to the Government of India, in a despatch of 9th March 1822, lvo.469. In the matter of the title of Muscat to Kishm tney remarked that while Kishm seemed much the most satisfactory station from the point of view of Lcr. 1.1943. suppressing piracy, however desirable it might be to retain the island we could not overlook considerations r ^ irrecis of justice and policy towards Persia: the King of § 276-8 Persia, had not yet shown any proof of his title whatever to Kishm, except its alleged authority (sic) on which ground he had also claimed Muscat and the whole province of Oman. Even the arguments mentioned by His Majesty's Charge' d'Affaires do not establish the claims of Persia. Sir John Malcolm on his first mission solicited a grant of Kishm from Persia, which was refused. If it had since appeared that Persia had no title to the territory so solicited what should prevent our applying to the right owner ? Still less did a casual expression of one of the Imam's officers destroy his master's right, if he ever had one. The/'V, -I I Db 24. The Governor of Bombay in Council was not acquainted with the nature of the Imam's rights either to Bunder Abhas or Kishm, hut supposing them equal there seemed abundant reason why he should waive his claim to Bunder Abbas, an integral part of Persia, and within rdach of Agha Mahomed Khan l s army; and retain it to Kishm, which was probably beyond the reach of that monarch's power. A claim, however, to which His Majesty's Minister at Teheran attached importance ought not to be hastily set aside, and supposing the King of Persia to possess any reasonable ground of pretension to the island, it would be unfriendly, at the least, to oppose it by military occupation. It seemed incumbent on us to avoid giving the Shah this ground of disquiet, if we could do so Yfithout a very serious sacrifice of our own interests ... It remained to be considered how far our withdrawing would affect the Imam to whose interests his zeal and fidelity to the alliance required that we should pay every attention, 33, The Government of Bombay's opinion vms therefore that we should ultimately retire from Kishm; if we y /ere to retire we should, however, they thought, take advantage of the time allowed by the King of Persia's own proposal, and in the interim apprise the Imam of the probability of our withdrawing from the Persian Gulf. 34. To Persia we might say that the time the Shah had allowed for a reference to England would probably be sufficient for the purpose as our occupation was only to be temporary; and that at all events the decision of H.M.G. would of course be binding on the authorities in Inaia; but in this and in all other communications the utmost care should/(0? 0 25. should 'be taken to avoid pronouncing an opinion on any claim which the Imam of Muscat might possess to Kishm. 35. These views were approved by the Government of India, 'but owing to a sudden change of atmosphere at Tehran, which led the Charge d'Affaires to ask for Lor.i. his passports, action was not taken on them; and rumours 1944. that the Shah had demanded a substantial increase in the rent payable by Muscat for Bunder Abbas and its dependencies (including Kishm) led to steps being taken to reinfoarce the garrison of Basidu - steps countermanded in June 182E on the restoration of good relations with the Shah, but too late to prevent the Charge d'Affa-ires from acting on instructions to notify them to the Persian Government. 36. On 1st September 1822 Sir H. Willock accordingly informed the Persian Government that it had been found necessary to augment the detachment on the island of Kishm as a temporary and precautionary measure Precis S.284. and received a reply in general terms, 36A. While in the circumstances described above, Basidu was evacuated by British troops in February 1822, it proved impossible to secure an equally convenient naval station in the Gulf. Basidu was accordingly P.G.13 pills. reoccupied by H.M.G. in 1823, from which year until 1878 it remained the headquarters of the .British Naval bQuadron in the Persian Gulf. No protest aga^inst its reoccupation appears at the time to have been made by Persia. 37. On 3rd September 1822 Captain Bruce, the Resident/|© O n ) V ^ f %/ 4^ 26 Resident at Bushire, reported to the Governor of BomlDay the unauthorised agreement which he had concluded in the preceding month with the Prince of or. i»1946~8 Shiraz, in regard to Bahrein and Gulf questions. The agreement which inter alia embodied an arrangement in regard to the island of Kishm, on the hasis of Persian sovereignty, was at once formally disowned hy the Government of Bombay, while the Persian Government on their side subsequently instructed the Prince of Shiraz tnat he had exceeded his powers in entering into discussion with the Resident. The Government of Bombay in a letter of 1st November 1823 to the Resident, No.1491, intimated to Captain Bruce that he had acted without authority arid was removed from his appointment as a punishment. In informing him of tne disavowal of the treaty which he had concluded with the Prince of Shiraz ana criticising its terms, they reimrked:- 'It admits the claim of the King of Persia to Kishm contrary to all history, to the protections (? protestations) of His Highness the Imam of Muscat and to the repeated declarations of this Government. It thereby admits the occupation of that island without the King of Persia's consent to have been an unjust aggression, and it agrees to admit a Persian force into Kishm, and to make over to the Persians the island which we received from the Imam' 38. The Governor of Bombay simultaneously addressed 'ecis 3.289 a letter to the Prince Regent of Pars in which after &gt;r.i.l94B. repudiating the treaty he remarked;- 'With/'J 27. 'With regard to Kismn I had long since applied to the kost Nohlo the Governor General for his consent for the Vvithdrawal 01 the detachment and having now obtained it, tlie troops have 'been ordered to return, and the island to he made over to the MaiL of Muscat, from whom it was received by the British Government: but in doing so this Government is actuated by considerations of its own convenience: and with respect to the claims of the Government of Persia on that island they have not as yet been provea. 51 ^9• Ihe instructions issued by the Government of Bombay ih uhelr letter oi l^th November 18^, No. 1584, to Captain Bruce*s successor as Resident at Bushire, remarked;- i« ihv&gt; ufluct Ox Lx^^ptci jj . j . jjrace 1 s proceedings is calculated to impress the Imam of Muscat and the 3iaik:i of Bahrein with an apprehension that, instead of observing a perfect neutrality in the Gulf, and limiting our interference to a control of all measures likely to lead to a renewal of piracy, founded on Major General .oil/ vvilliam Keir's treaties, we have thrown our whole influence in the scale in favour of Persia in support of its general views of supremacy over every island and possession in the Gulf of Persia.

Between 1823 and 1826 the Persians endeavoured but without success to dispossess the Imam of Muscat of his revenue lease of Bunder Abbas and its dependencies. Between 1846 and 1848 a second attempt of the same nature was avoided by gifts of the Imam of Muscat to the Persian negotiators. In 1852 -4 in the absence of the Imam of Muscat in Zanzibar the Muscat! Governor of Bundar Abbas 'was expelled by Persia but the lost districts were subsequently forcibly recovered by the Imam. The Imam was, however, unable to hold them, and an agreement was finally reached between Persia and Muscat in 1855 under which a fresh lease for twenty years was granted to the latter whach involved not only the payment of an increased rent to Persia by the ruler of Muscat but the specific recognition as Persian territory of the Islana of Kishm. 41. The Persian firman of 1855 specifies in its preamble that the islands of Kishm, Ormuz, e tc. are Persian territories leased on certain terms to the Imam of Muscat. The firman contains no specific reference to Basidu. Article 15 runs as follows:- 'As long as Bunder Abbas, the above named two islands, Shernal, Minab, and their dependencies, are in the hands of the Imam of Muscat, he should not allow any officers of foreign Governments to go there. He should also promise to protect these places by land and sea, providing for every port having an anchorage some ships . . • He should further promise to protect the bounaaries of any of the above-named places, from all interference or intrusion/« 30 - intrusion of strangers whether in an amicable or hostile manner. He should not at any time allow any ship .... or any hostile person, armed or otherwise, Arab or foreign, to approach or get a footing in Bunaer Abbas or the Persian territory, with hoxile intentions or other pretexts,' Article 14 proceeds that:- 'The Imam of Muscat, notwithstanding these conditions has not the right of letting Bunder Aobas and the above-saia places to any foreigner . . . 42► Article 2 of th* Treaty of Paris, of 4th March 1857, on the conclusion of the Anglo- Persian war, provided that 'the forces of Her Majesty the Queen shall evacuate the Persian territory, subject to conditions and stipulations thereafter specified..' Article 14 of the same Treaty provided that tchison 'as soon as the stipulations in regard to the I P.81 .XVIII. evacuation by the Persian troops of Herat and the Afghan territories, as well as in regard to the reception of the British Mission at Teheran, shall have been carried into full effect, the British troops shall, without delay, be withdrawn from all ports, places, and islands, belonging to Persia', Despite this, not only did the Naval station at Basidu remain in British occupation: but no evidence has been traced of any complaint on this score by Persia, nor does any request lor its evacuation appeal 1 to have been maae» 48A. /31. Letter from Sir L. Pelly dated S2. Oct.1864. The refer ence is to the letter quoted in para.21 above. Precis S.145. 42A. In 1864 the Resident in the Persian Gulf emphasised that Persia had 'tacitly acknowledged our right to possession, 'because when at the conclusion of the war between Muscat and Persia in 1856 the Treaty (under which the present lease obtains) was entered inLo, x^ersia raised no objection to the presence of our flag or to undisguised maintenance of a considerable station, coal depots, hospital, etc- at Bassidore'. 43. The telegraph agreement of 1864 between Muscat and Great Britain, which has never been secret, contains the following Article:- H Ai -ticle 6. In like manner nothing in these Articles shall be held as invalidating or derogating from the title of the British Government to the Station of Bassadore, that station having been freely granted x to the British Government by my late illustrious father of blessed memory, the late Imaum Syed Saeed bin Sultan, on behalf of himself, his heirs and successors'. This Article had been deliberately inserted at the time by the Political Resident, who remarked:- 'Government will observe that Article 6 relates to our station at Bassidore. Our title to that station has of course been for many years a bona fide one, but on telegraphic and general considerations the present seemed a convenient opportunity for giving to our title the sanction of a written confirmatory deed'. 44. In 1866 the lease of 1855-6, which was for twenty years only, and was limited to Sultan Said and his son, automatically came to an end. The Persians accordingly transferred the lease to a member of the A1 bu Said family, but as a dependent of Persia and not as representing the Sultans of Oman. The lessee having withheld the revenue (^■y_0 from him, steps were taken by Persia in 1868 lor nis forcible/forcible removal. This lea to a demand 'by the Sultan of Muscat, 'backed 'by a threat of force, tor the transfer to him of the lease. As the result of British mediation p.i.480* refusing to allow the Sultan to blockade S.Persian ports) the lease was accordingly renewed for a period of 48 years in favour of Sultan Salim and his descendants'. In the course of the discussions the Sultan claimed Henjam and Larak as dependencies of Oman irrespective of the Bunder Abbas lease; nor was his claim to the islands either abandoned or disproved'. The re-lease in question, dated 4th August 1868, follows the Firman of 1855 in making no reference to Basidu, but contains provisions in its 13th and 14th articles substantially identical with those quoted in para. 41 above from that Firman. Article 13 emphasises that no foreign ships shall under any circumstances be permitted 'to anchor within the limits of the anchorage ground of the said territories'* or.i.2147. 45. On the deposition of Sultan Salim at the end of 1868 the leaae granted by Persia in September of that year was automatically determined, and was never thereafter renewed in favour of Muscat. 46. The surrender of fugitives who had taken refuge in the Basidu concession appears to have been jor.i.2106. demanded by Persia on various occasions between 1863 and 1868, but never granted. Government regarding it 'as virtually British territory', and no extradition agreement existing with Persia. In September 1868 the Government of India on an examination of the legal position ol the settlement which had been raised by a demand lor the surrender of a slave who had taken refuge in the concession, informed/33, informed the Government of Bombay that in their opinion 'the station in question cannot properly 'be considered as British territory. It is perfectly true that we have occupied Bassidore either as a naval or coaling station for nearly half a century. But the island has always 'been treated 'by us as a dependency of Bunder Abbas, and Bunder Abbas and its dependencies, including this island of Kishm^ and consequently Bassidore, have been leased to the Sultan of Muscat 'by the Shah of Persia in circumstances with which Government of Bombay is perfectly familiar ... As the British Government holds 0 i' t-J 16 town of Bassidore by permission of the Sultan of Muscat, while that potentate derives his lease of Kishm, which includes Bassidore, from the Shah of fersia, it follows necessarily that Kishm must still be considered as Persian territory# There may be some obscurity as to the exact nature of our derivative title to the town of Bassidore, and it iiay have been thought that our rights over the town existed by continued usage or that we had obtained a prescriptive title; but in looking closely into the question it becomes evident that our rights are subordinate to those of Muscat, which again admittedly, are entirely subordinate to those of rersia, and always have been so treated up to this very hour'. 46.A. The opinion expressed by the Government of India in 1868 has since hela the field and was maintained by them in 1875. In 1901 the Political resident was instructed by I to Pol. the Government of India that no official of the Persian '•9th ... . r_t 1 Ly 1901. Government can be permitted to reside m any part ol the station at Basidu without the express sanction of the British Government. H 47. In 1905 the coal agent at Basidu was instructed by the/34. P .G.13 the Resident, Sir Percy Cox, to v^am a Persian customs p.119» officer who had interfered, that 'he has no 'business in British t erritory, and if he persists he should not he allowed to come within British territory'. 48. In November 1926, the Foreign Office remarked P.O. to in a letter to the India Office that in view of the effect 1.0. 6th Nov*1926, on the status of Henjam of admitting the Persian claim to P.3847/26. Basidu 'it would 'be dangerous to allow doubt to 'be cast on the validity of the British rights to Basidu whi*h rest on undisturbed occupation over a long period'. 49» In 1928, consequent on a suggestion that the Persian Government were likely to make an armed descent on Basidu, the Charge d'Affaires at Teheran was instructed to make representations to the central Customs authorities and if necessary to warn .the Persian Government that any molestation of British Basidu 'which has 'been a British station for 100 years, would be a complete negation of x Minister of Courts promise to Sir R,Olive'. The Senior : Naval Officer was simultaneously instructed to resist by to maintain the status force in the last resort should this prove necessary any quo in the Persian landing of armed Persians in Basidu.

The Persian official stated that he had not had any instructions from Tehran as to anchoring in territorial waters, that he did not know that he had anchored in British waters, and that he had anchored in the same place several times before without protest. He added that he was prepared to move if he had a written/35. * wri11en reques t I'rom the Commanding Offi cer H. M. S. ,, ORIvIONDE 1, or from Lieut• Gretton.

This will be effected by moving your dhow about 300 yards to the south Eastward'. The dhow in due course removed itself on the completion of its work in Persian Basidu. No protest against the claim that the territorial waters of British Basidu were British appears to have been made. Sir R.Hoare 51. In December 1932, H.M.

Text of Treaty, dated November 3, 1916, and ratified on March 23, 1918, between His Majesty's Government and Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Jasim-bin-Thani of al-Katar. Whereas my grandfather, the late Sheikh Mohammed-bin-Tham, signed an agreement on the 12th September, 1868, engaging not to commit any breach of the maritime peace, and whereas these obligations to the British Government have devolved on me his successor in Qatar; I. I, Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Jasim-bin-Thani, undertake that I will, as do the friendly Arab Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi, Dibai, Shargah, Ajman, Ras-nl-Khaima, and Umm-al- Qawain, co-operate with the High British Government in the suppression of the slave trade and piracy, and generally in the maintenance of the maritime peace. To this end, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, has favoured me with the treaties and engagements entered into between the Sheikhs above mentioned and the High British Government, and I hereby declare that I will abide by the npirit and obligations of the aforesaid treaties and engagements. c IT. On the other hand, the British Government undertakes that I and my subjects and my and their vassals shall receive all the immunities, privileges, and advantages that are conferred on the friendly Sheikhs, their subjects and their vassals. In token whereof, Sir Percy Cox has affixed his signature with the date thereof to each and every one of the aforesaid treaties and engagements in the copy granted to me, and I have also affixed my signature and seal with the date thereof to each and every one of the aforesaid treaties and engagements, in two other printed copies of the same treaties and engagements, that it may not be hidden. : III. And in particular, I, Sheikh Abdullah, have further published a proclamation, forbidding the import and sale of arms into my territories and port of Qatar; and in consideration of the undertaking into which I now enter, the British Government on its part agrees to grant me facilities to purchase and import, from the Maskat Arms Warehouse, or such other place as the British Government may approve, for mv personal use, and for the arming of my dependents, such arms and ammunition as I may reasonably need and apply for in such fashion as may be arranged hereafter through the Political Agent, Bahrein. I undertake absolutely that arms and , ammunition thus supplied to me shall under no circumstances be re-exported from my territories or sold to the public, but shall be reserved solely for supplying the needs of my tribesmen and dependents, whom I have to arm for the maintenance of order in my territories and the protection of my frontiers. In my opinion, the amount of my early requirements will be up to five hundred weapons. IV. I, Shaikh Abdullah, further undertake that I will not have relations nor correspond with, nor receive the agent of, any other Power without the consent of the High British Government ; neither will I, without such consent, cede, to any other Power or its subjects, land, either on lease, sale, transfer, gift, or in any other way whatsoever. V. I also declare that, without the consent of the High British Government, I will not gjant pearl-fishery concessions, or any other monopolies, concessions, or cable landing rights to anyone whomsoever. VI. The customs dues on the goods of British merchants imported to Qatar shall not exceed those levied from my own subjects on their goods, and shall in no case exceed ■5 per cent, ad valorem. British goods shall be liable to the payment of no other dues or taxes of any other kind whatsoever, beyond that already specified. 2383 75 12.33 O (r$KC (S F VI, Shaikh Abdullah, further, in particular, undertake to allow British subjects reside in Qatar for trade and to protect their lives and property. to.

I also undertake to receive, should the British Government deem it advisable, an agent from the British Government, who shall remain at A]-Bidaa for the transaction of such business as the British Government may have with me, and to watch over the interests of British traders, residing at my ports or visiting them upon their lawful occasions. IX. Further, I undertake to allow the establishment of a British post office and a telegraph installation anywhere in my territory whenever the British Government should hereafter desire them. I also undertake to protect them when established, X. On their part, the High British Government, in consideration of these treaties and engagements that I have entered into with them, undertake to protect me and ray subjects and territory from all aggression by sea, and to do their utmost to exact reparation for all injuries that I, or my subjects, may suffer when proceeding to sea upon our lawful occasions.

The question for settlement is that of the boundaries of the Sheikhdom of Qatar •&lt; where it is not bounded by the sea. In the pre-war period the boundary to the south was to some extent indeterminate, but broadly speaking was regarded at the time of the compilation of Lorimer's Gazetteer in 1905-07 as running across the base of the Qatar Peninsula more or less south-east from Dohat-as-Salwa to a point north of d ' Khor-al-'Odeid. There is reason to believe that the Sheikh of Qatar still regards it as following approximately this line (see paragraph 8 below), but conditions have not been propitious for raising the question specifically with him, and the present note aims at reaching a provisional conclusion on the material available as to— (а) the southern boundary of Qatar ; (б) if the boundaries of Qatar on the south and west do not extend to the blue line agreed as the eastern frontier of Nejd in the unratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of July 1913, the position of the intervening area. The history of the question is as follows :— The Boundary on the South-East. 2. To the east, the boundary between Qatar and the adjoining Trucial Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi has been the subject of frequent dispute in the past. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi has claimed sovereignty over a stretch of Qatar territory running so far Lor. II, 405, north as the Bay of Umm-al-Hul, south of Wakra on the map attached.* The Sheikh of Qatar, for his part, has claimed sovereignty over areas in the Abu Dhabi Sheikhdom running as far east as the Sabakhat Matti. His Majesty's Government Lor. II, 88- have consistently refused to recognise claims so exaggerated by either party, but they 89 - have repeatedly intimated that they regard the Khor-al-'Odeid, which lies about mid way between the extreme points referred to, as appertaining to Abu Dhabi. They have Lor.TI, 89. also recognised the Abu Dhabi claim to the district of 'Aqal, geographical details of which are given in I (iii) of the Appendix to this note, and which contains both the Khor-al-'Odeid and the Khor-adh-Dhuwaihin. We have thus a fixed point for the south-eastern boundary of Qatar. The Boundary on the South-West. 3. On the south-western extremity of the Qatar boundary there has been no corresponding dispute, nor is there a fixed point equally definitely established which can with confidence be regarded as marking the western limit of the territories of Qatar. The Position prior to the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. 4. The southern boundary of Qatar was closely investigated locally between 1904 and 1907 by experienced political officers in connection with the compilation of Mr. Lorimer's 'Persian Gulf Gazetteer.' The result of their investigation is given in the extract from the Gazetteer reproduced as item I (i) in the Appendix to this note. Broadly speaking, it went to show that the southern boundary of the State ran south-east from Dohat-as-Salwa to a point to the north of the Khor-al-Odeid. Over the first section, running Irom Dohat-as-Salwa to the Wells of Sakak, there was no dispute. The boundary between the Wells of Sakak and the sea on the eastern side of the Qatar Peninsula was, however, indeterminate. Two alternatives (the difference at its widest point being some 20 miles) were reported by Lorimer. For the reasons given by him (and substantially based on the historical considerations referred to in paragraph 2 above) he regarded the second alternative as preferable. I he effect of its acceptance would be that the eastern sector of the southern Qatar boundary would run south-east from the Wells of Sakak to the sea north of the Khor-al-'Odeid. 2560 12, 12 2.34 Not reproduced.

Discussion over the years 1911-13 between the Turkish Goverum His Majesty's Government on the various matters in dispute between them Persian Gulf area culminated in the latter year in the signature of two ConV 9 defining inter alia the eastern limits of Turkish authority in Arabia. The On Ventl0118 of 29th July 1913, which defined the eastern boundary of Nejd, is alone relevaTfl the present purpose. Under that Convention, which, though reference is made t in the ratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of 9th March 1911, was never itself rat fi f the eastern boundary of the Turkish Sanjaq of Nejd was detined by a blue lin 6 the map running due south from the head of the bay opposite Zaqnuniyeh Island ^ the Persian Gulf to the 20th parallel of latitude in the Central Arabian' Desert Tj! n text of the relevant article is given in section II of the Appendix attached to this N t ^ Its wording (' une ligne . . . separera le Nedjd de la presqu'ile d'El Katr J ^ limites du Nedjd sont indiquees par une ligne bleue . . . ') would iustifv contention that the blue line was at once the eastern frontier of Nejd and the western frontier of Qatar. But there are definite objections to adopting this view. la the first place, there is nothing to show that this was, in fact, the intention of Hp Majesty's Government at the time when the Convention was concluded, or that tliev had any object beyond limiting the eastern boundary of the Turkish possessions in this area. Secondly, there is no evidence of any claim to suzerainty by Qatar so far P.Z. 299/34 to the west or so far to the south. Thirdly, the Resident's telegram of 11th January 1934, T. 19, emphasises the absence of control by the Sheikh of Qatar over the interior of his State (and a fortiori over regions so remote from Dohah as are now under consideration). Fourthly (though this by itself is probably not of serious importancei the position vis-a-vis Ibn Saud is to some extent compromised, as explained below' at any rate as regards the Harr-al-Qarah, by the line fixed by Sir Percy Cox in 1922! Fifthly, it is arguable that even in a formal document such as the 1913 Convention, the fact that the blue line is spoken of separating Nejd from the Qatar Peninsula, need not be regarded as determining the boundary of Qatar. The Qatar Peninsula was the closest prominent geographical feature and the nearest adjoining Arab political entity on the mainland, and a reference to it for descriptive purposes was not unnatural. Finally, there is much to be said for giving no avoidable extensions to the boundaries of Qatar, even if the consequence is that we have to deal with an area of indeterminate ownership between those boundaries and the blue line. Line indicated in 1922 by Sir P. Cox to Ibn Saud and Major Holmes as the Eastern Limit of any Oil Concession in respect of Hasa. 6. One more incident of importance should be recorded before coming to the latest evidence as to the view held by the Sheikh of Qatar as to his southern boundary. 1 he incident is that referred to in Colonel Dickson's letter of 4th July ]9.)-&gt;, No. 14-'), to the Political Resident, copies of which were received under the Political Resident's express letter of 18th December 1933, No. 1934 8., when Sir P.Z. 180/34 Percy Cox, who was then High Commissioner for Iraq, in a discussion at Oqairinl922 with Ibn Saud, then Sultan of Nejd, and Major Holmes, warned both the Sultan and Major Holmes that the Sultan could grant no concession, and Major Holmes leceive none from him, in respect of the Principality of Qatar, and drew on a map a line imining from Djau-ecl-Dukhan to Dohat-as-Salwa, which, he indicated, must repiesent the eastern boundary of any concession granted by Ibn Saud in respect of Hasa. Such a line, as will be seen from the map, excludes the whole Qatar Peninsula (and incidentally a substantial area lying to the west of the blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention). It also includes in Hasa an area to the east of the blue line of the Anglo-1 urkish Convention. It should, however, be noted that while it constituted a definite indication of the High Commissioner's view as to the eastern oundary of Hasa, it in no way specifically defined the boundaries of Qatar save in so iar as Qatar might be regarded as marching with Hasa and Nejd, or might he i rn ^rf aS . heen granted a western frontier bounded by the blue line of the o Convention at the time when that Convention was concluded.f Bushire Memo. 947 S. of 20th Dec. 1922.

The statement is, no doubt, an alternative version of Sir P. Cox's warning to Ibn Saud as to the eastern boundary of any concession to be granted by him in respect of Hasa discussed in the preceding paragraph, of which an authoritative record based on personal knowledge is given in Colonel Dickson's letter of 4th July 1933, Ko. 143. l.P.C.

J/ Position of Area lying between Base of Qatar Peninsula and Blue Line of' A nglo -Turkish Convention of 1913. 10. If, in these circumstances, it is accepted that the southern houndary of Qatar should be a line running via or to the north of Sakak more or less south-east from Dohat -as -Salwa or a point slightly to the north ot Dohat-as-Salvva to a point to the north of the Khor-al-'Odeid, the difficult question arises of the position of the country lying between such a line and the blue line 01 the Anglo-J urkish Convention of 1913 Importance of Maintaining the Blue Line. 11. On the one hand, it appears definitely important if possible to maintain the blue line laid down in the unratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 as against Ibn Saud or any other future ruler of this part of Arabia. While the 1913 Convention was never ratified, the blue line at any rate represents the agreement reached at the time between Turkey and His Majesty's Government as to the limits of Turkish authority in northern Arabia and on the Persian Gulf, and in dealiug with Ibn Saud as the successor in title to the lurks we can, it would seem, not unreasonably take our stand on it. The difficulties of finding any satisfactory substitute are patent. The undesirability of giving Ibn Saud, in the absence of any definite eastern boundary to his territories, 'an excuse for territorial expansion (as distinct from the exercise, as at present, of an informal influence and the receipt from our Arab clients of payments which we do not recognise and the existence of which we ignore) in the hinterland of the Trucial Coast and of Muscat is equally clear. Such expansion would clearly involve a risk either of his coming into conflict with the local rulers, whose treaty relations with His Majesty's Government he has formally lecognised, or of his establishing an influence in the Sheikhdoms in question so powerful as to be embarrassing from our point of view. Disadvantages of Maintenance of the Bmje Line while fixing Southern Boundary of Qatar at the Base of the Qatar Peninsula. 12. At the same time, important on general gmunds, for the reasons given, as the maintenance of the blue line appears to bey the fact must be faced that in the present case, if we continue to regard it as the eastern boundary of Ibn Saud's territory, and if, as suggested, we accept a southern boundary ior Qatar running roughly across the base of the Qatar Peninsula, a not inconsiderable area lying between the two States, arid peopled by migratory Bedouin tribes, will be left in an indeterminate political position. There is a possibility that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, who has in the past exercised a wide influence, and made tribal alliances of his own, in the Trucial hinterland—c/. Sir P. Cox's letter No. 176 of 28th June 1904—might prefer some claim to such an area. But, though on this point further information will be sought frpm the Resident, there seems little evidence of any active interest on the part of 'Ahw-Dhahi in any area to the west of 'Aqal. Assuming that no such claim exists, or could be substantiated, the alternatives are to recognise the area as belonging to Ibn Saud ; to recognise it as belonging to the Sheikh of Qatar; or to regard it as a political no-man's land. 13. If,we-recognised it as belonging to Ihn Sand we could, if necessary, call upon him to keep Bedouin raids into Qatar from it under control. But such recognition would not merely be inconsistent with the maintenance of the blue line of the li'l^ Convention, to the abandonment of which, as stated above, the objections appear to be strong, but would represent a formal acceptance of Saudi sovereignty to the borders or Qatar and Abu Dhabi which might well prove embarrassing. 14. If, on the other hand, it is attributed to the Sheikh of Qatar, we should be justified in expecting the full co-operation of the Sheikh in dealing with Bedouin activities within its limits. But such an attribution would not meicly give to Qatar a substantial area which she does not in the past appear to have claimed, but would extend the limits of any liability for protection which we may undertake in connection with the grant of an oil concession. It might be necessary to claim the area (or at any rate its coastal strip) for Qatar if there were serious signs of foreign interest in it or of an intention on the part of Ibn Saud to occupy it. But pending sucn developments it seems wiser to limit our commitments and to avoid any extension ot the area recognised by us as Qatar. ■ ■. ,15. The decision to regard it as a 'political no-man s land would, so far as can be judged, be likely to mean little more than the acceptance of the de facto position to-day. As will be seen from paragraphs 16 to 18 below, the area, save for the Barr-al-Qarah district, is largely desert, peopled by nomadic tribes yielding uncertain allegiance to Ibn Saud, and it appears to differ little in general conditions from the Rub-al-Khali further south. Admittedly the absence of a limitrophe ruler who could be made responsible for the activities of his subjects, may make it more difficult to secure the southern border of Qatar against nomadic Bedouins. But the difficulties involved may be less than they appear. The difficulties of any alternative to regarding the tract as of indeterminate ownership are great, and at any rate as a provisional policy there would appear to be much to be said for treating this area as indeterminate in ownership and avoiding, if possible, raising the thorny questions of its boundaries to the west and of political control within it w T ith Ibn Saud. Nature and Political Conditions of the Indeterminate Area. 16. Before reaching a conclusion it may be well to place on record such scanty information as is available about the nature and the political conditions of the indeterminate area. Apart from the coastal district known as the Barr-al-Qarah, which is further discussed in paragraph 18 below, the bulk of it appears to belong to the Jafurah desert, which Lorimer describes as an area ' possessing only a few wells of very bitter water, a little scanty grazing, with a surface of red and burning ^ or - 892 ' sand,' in which living conditions are extremely difficult and which is frequented * 44 to any considerable extent' only by 'the hardy A1 Morrah, and even they avoid entering it unless in winter or in search o£ a refuge from more powerful enemies ' (cf. Appendix, section I (vi)). Since the date of Lorimer's Gazetteer, Mr. Bertram Thomas, on his recent crossing of the Rub-al-Khali, has passed through this area from south to north, travelling from the well of Banaiyan near Latitude 23° 11' 40 // via Haluwain, Nakhala, and the western extremity of a salt lake lying immediately west of the Khor-al-'Odeid, across the pre-war Qatar frontier to Dohah. His account is of importance because it makes it clear that such local control as is exercised is exercised solely by nomad Bedouin tribes (and principally the A1 Murra, who are a tribe dwelling in the sands, whose influence extends well down into the Rub-al-Khali). Secondly, even though he travelled with a 'rabia,' or guarantor, from the A1 Murra Arabia tribe, the journey was rendered extremely dangerous by the risk of an attack on the Felix, party by Ikhwan fanatics, who roam apparently at large, over the whole area. 216 - 7 . 28 1- Thirdly,, the sites of Salwa, Iskak (? —Sakak) and Mabak, the first two of which lie on, Arabia and the third slightly south of, the pre-war boundary of Qatar, were at the time of his journey in the hands of the Ikhwan, with the result that he could not visit them, footnote # 17. On the question of political conditions Mr. Thomas throughout his journey (the route of which lay well to the east of the blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention) from the centre of the Rub-al-Khali northwards to the Persian Gulf refers to^ the established influence of Ibn Saud and its beneficent results, and remarks: 'To-day peace, the peace of Bin Saud, prevails throughout the sands. Aral)ia The influence of the Ruler of Central Arabia, wielded through his able Viceroy at jrellx^ Hofuf, Ibn Jiluwi, compels peace between all these old enemies, not through direct pp. 271-2. control, for there is and can be none, but through the immense personal prestige of Abdul Aziz himself. A belief in his strength and star has swept across the sands. Not love, but awe, serves this wise providence that so directs affairs. . . . Thus, the sand tribes proper are in some degree leagued with Bin Saud. They pay to him a nominal tribute and by that act are ensured mutual protection one from the other. In theory the tribute is an annual levy of one dollar on each camel. In practice, the Rashid have no money, and in any event they escape proper payment by reason of their remoteness. They do, however, send a camel from year to year as occasion offers in token of submission. When, however, rains fall in the northern sands and they migrate thither, the tax-gatherers' demands must be met, and a few camels are sold for the purpose. Light as is the bond, the tribes grumble at it. . . . They all swear that the existing peace shall last only as long as the present regime of Riyadh. Let Riyadh or Hofuf be thought to have lost its power, and raiding will be resumed immediately, and blood will flow again. ...' Mr. Thomas's remarks may be compared with those of Mr. Philby (who in 1932 travelled through the Barr-al-Qarah area and thence south-west to the Jabrin oasis) reproduced in section III of the Appendix to this Note. 2560 A 2Conclusions. 19'. In the light of the examinatioa of the position given above, and subject to the observations of the Government of India and the Political Resident, the best course would appear to be the following:— (а) Boundaries of Qatar. —To agree that the boundaries of Qatar shall be accepted as being on the north, east and west, the sea ; on the south, a line running across the base of the Peninsula from a point not south of the latitude of the bead of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay to a point not south of the north side of the Khor-al-Odeid inlet. The line indicated on the I.P.O. map would satisfy these criteria, and if it is confirmed that it is the line at present claimed by the Sheikh of Qatar it could be accepted. A slight modification to bring the line some \2 miles south to the head of Dohat-as Salvva Bay, and so to reduce the area of sea coast in indeterminate ownership, could be considered if necessary. (б) The hlae line of the 1913 Convention, to be maintained as against Ibn Saud, for the reasons given in paragraph 11 above, as the eastern boundary of Saudi Arabia. (c) If a claim is advanced by Ibn Saud to the Barr-al-Qarah on the ground of the line indicated by Sir Percy Cox in the Oqair conversations in 1922Jreferred to in paragraph 6, that His Majesty's Government should either— (i) concede the claim, on the ground, if necessary, that they regarded themselves as committed by the informal conversations of 1922, but without prejudice to the maintenance in principle of the blue line,, and in return for a formal recognition by Ibn Saud of the validity of this line. The attribution to Ibn Saud of the Barr-al-Qarah area, undesirable as it may be on other grounds, would have the advantage of leaving no gap of indeterminate territory bordering on the sea coast, for we can without difficulty, as suggested in (a) above, recognise the frontiers of Qatar a^ beginning at Dohat-as-Salwa, i.e. at the point at which the Barr -al-Qaran ends. (ii) If it was thought preferable to make no concession in respect of the blue line, then to argue that informal discussions such as those o 1922, which had never been confirmed in writing or been the subjec of formal agreement, had no binding effect, and that His Majesty s Government took their stand on the blue line. Play might be made wit the fact that the line drawn by Sir Percy Cox would, in fact, deprive n Saud of a substantial area lying between Djau -ed-Dukhan and the western side of the blue line. ■ U*. i* £i Uj Sfc f &gt; T The Barr-al-Qakaii District. 18. The importance of this district for the present purpose is first that it embraces the coastal strip lying between the blue line and the pre-war western extremity o( Qatar, and secondly that it appears to correspond fairly closely, if not exactly, with the triangle of land' lying to the east of the blue line, which falls within the urea left to the west of the rough line indicted to Ibn Saud and Major Holmes by Sir P. 0 ox in H)22 (see paragraph 6 above). Mr. Phdby, with the assistance of recommendations and guides furnished by Ibn »Jiluwi, the Saudi Governor of Hasa, travelled throncrh a portion of it in 1932. The impression left by his ' Empty Quarter' is that the dominant political influence at the present day are the Saudi Government and the Ikhvvan. Details of the Barr-al-Qarah district are given in the extract from Lorimer reproduced as item I (v) in the Appendix to this^ Note. As will be seen, Lorimer considered that it ' might perhaps be reckoned as included in the Sanjaq of Hasa'— in other words, in the pre-war Ottoman Sandjaq of Nejd. On this assumption the boundaries of Nejd in the 1913 Convention might well have been fixed so as to include it, with the result that the limits of Nejd would have touched the pre -war limits of Qatar on the coastline at the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay, the hinterland (actually the Jafurah Desert) being left in indeterminate ownership. For whatever reason (and it must be assumed that substantial justification was produced to persuade the Turks to relinquish their position in the Barr-al-Qarah) the line was in fact fixed farther to the west. But the history of the Barr-al-Qarah, and the fact that the 1913 Convention had never been ratified, may well have been the reasons which led Sir P. Cose in 1922 to fix the limits of Hasa at a point which included in it the Barr-al-Qarah rather than at the blue line of the 1913 Convention.7 [d) The a7e(i lying hetween the hlue line and the houndavies recognised for Qatar as in (a) above to be regarded, subject to confirmation by the Resident that no claim to them is made or could be substantiated west of: Aqal by Abu Dhabi, as of indeterminate ownership. As it appears to be largely inhospitable desert under Ikhwan control, save for the coastal strip of the Barr-al-Qarah, the likelihood that oil companies will actively interest themselves in it is probably small, if they do, on the principle that Ibn baud has no interest east of the blue line, it might be necessary to consider whether to attribute it to Qatar or Abu Dhabi (the wording of the 1913 Convention, as quoted in paragraph 5 above, would assist us in claiming it for Qatar). It would in any event be desirable, in order to prevent foreign interests from endeavouring to establish a foothold in it, to consider in what way it could best be made clear that we regarded it as falling within our own sphere of influence or that of one of our Trucial allies.

The question of any communication in respect of Nejdi tribes (if any) using Qatar territory could equally be postponed unless and until circumstances may make It necessary to consider it. J. G. Laithwaite. India Office, 26th January 1934:. APPENDIX, Boundaries of Qatar.' I —Extracts from Lorimer's Gazetteer. (i) Qatar. (A.B. Mr. Lorimer s article on Qatar is stated to be the result of special enquiries made over a number of years locally.) Lorimer, Vol. II, page 1506, defines the boundaries of Qatar as follows On the east, noith and west, Qatar is surrounded by the sea. The southern boundary is somewhat indeterminate. It begins at the foot of Dohat-as-Salwa on the western side of the promontory, and from that point runs south-eastwards to the wells of Sakak: thence, according to one account, it strikes east-north east to the north end of the Naqiyan sandhills, or, according to another, east by south to the southern end of the same hills on the north side of the entrance to Khor-al-'Odaid. As the territory of the Trucial Sheikh of Abu Dhabi has never clearly been asserted to extend beyond Khor-al-'Odaid, and as the Al-Thani Sheikhs of Qatar undoubtedly claim the Naqiyan tract, the latter of the two^' alternative lines is to be preferred ; the British Government have recognised! Khor-al-Odaid as beloliging to Abu Dhabi and the boundary consequently cannot be placed nearer to Trucial Oman, though the Al-Thani Sheikhs assert a right to the whole coast as far as the Sabakhat Matti. It is said that three men stationed at Dohat-as-Salwa, Sakak and Niqa-al-Maharah, respectively, can watch the whole southern border of Qatar from sea to sea.'(ii) Kh or-al-'Odaid. Tn Vol J I, on page 1367, Mr. Lorimer describes Khor-al-'Odaid as 'an i n i et creek on tlie coast of the Abu Dhabi principality as its extreme western end* it l' 01 * about 180 miles almost due west from the town of Abu Dhabi. The boundary If Qatar is either at, or a short distance to the north of, the inlet.' ' y (iii) 'Aqal. In Vol. II, pagea 88-89, Mr. Lorimer describes 'Aqal as 44 a small littoral district at the base of the Qatar peninsula upon the east side ; it is bounded by Khor -al -Odaid on the north-west and by Dohat-an-Nakharlah on the south-east, the distance between which in a direct line is nearly 35 miles. Inland the depth of the district is on an average about 20 miles.' [N.B.—Nathil (Saudah) in 'Aqal is 20 to 25 miles inland westward, from the foot of Khor-al-'Odaid.J ' On the landward side 'Aqal is enclosed by Mijan on the east, the Jafurah desert on the south and south-west, and by Qatar on the north-west. . . . The Bedouins do not regard 'Aqal as geographically included in Oman, which in their view is terminated on the west by the Sabakhat Matti; but the district has been recognised by the British Government as forming part of the territories of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, and must therefore be considered to belong, in the political sense, to Trucial Oman.' (iv) Ahu Dhabi. In Vol. II, page 405, under 'Aha Dhabi,'' Mr. Lorimer remarks: 'Upon the coast Abu Dhabi reaches from ... to Khor-al-'Odaid on the west—a distance of over 200 miles. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in 1695 claimed that his frontier extended to the Bay of Umm-al-Uul, near Wakrah in Qatar, but his claim was not approved by the Government of India; Bishairiyah has also been named as the limit of his State in this direction, but no good reason has been adduced for supposing that his jurisdiction ever extended beyond Khor-al-'Odaid, though the northern shore of that inlet should perhaps be reckoned as included with the inlet itself in his territories. Inland the frontiers of Abu Dhabi are not defined. It is asserted that on the east they reach to the Baraimi oasis, but without taking it in, and on the south they may presumably be placed at the margin of the Ruba'-al-Khali.' .Nijj (v) Barr-al-Qarah.

Upon the coast it meets Barr-al-'Oqair to the north and Qatar to the south of it; and inland, in all directions, it merges in the Jafurah desert. Some authorities would even make Barr-al-'Qarah a part of Jafurah. . . .' (vi) J a fur ah.

On the east it is separated from the sea ' from north to south ' by Barr-al-'Qarah, Qatar, 'Aqaland Mijan ; on; the south it is bounded by the Rnba-al-Khali. It may be added here that Jafurah encloses Jabrin upon the north and east and that, in the opinion of some, Barr-al- Qarah is a portion of Jafurah desert and not a separate tract. Jafurah differs from the waterless Ruba-al-Khali only in possessing a few wells of very bitter water and a little scanty grazing; its surface consists of red and burning sand.

[E 6077/16/91] 1. —Final Record of a Meeting held at the Foreign Office, on October 5, 1933. THE following were present at the meeting :— Mr. G. W. Rendel {in the Chair), Foreign Office. Mr. K. R. Johnstone, Foreign Office. Sir A. Ryan, His Majesty's Minister at Jedda. Lieutenant-Colonel T. C. Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Mr. J. G. Laithwaite, India Office. xP The meeting had before it Sir Andrew Ryan's note of the 16th August, regarding the attitude of King Ibn Saud towards Koweit (see Appendix A). Mr. Rendel outlined the present political situation of Koweit. The Sheikh was tied to His Majesty's Government by his treaty engagements, but at the same time was being courted both by Ibn Saud and by Iraq. It was clear that the sheikhdom was not in a position which in the ordinary way would enable it to stand alone either as a political or as an economic entity, and that it must there fore depend on some stronger Power. He understood that it was the policy of His Majesty's Government, in view of the strategic importance of Koweit, not to allow it to be absorbed by any foreign Power, but, so far as was possible, to maintain their present treaty relationship with the Sheikh. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that Koweit was at the present moment of more vital importance to His Majesty's Government than it had been at any time, since it had bulked so prominently as the terminus of the Bagdad Railway before the war. This was the result first of the development of the air route to India and Australia, which had made the Gulf as important imperially from the air stand point as was the Suez Canal for naval reasons, and, secondly, owing to the expira tion of the mandatory regime in Iraq and the uncertainty of the future relations of His Majesty's Government with that country. So long as Iraq had been under British control, there had been a natural tendency to give it prior consideration and the less important question of Koweit had been kept comparatively in the background. But now that Iraq had attained full independence, the position was changed and Koweit had once again assumed major importance. Geographically, Koweit occupied a key position at the head of the Persian Gulf, and one from which the Gulf could be controlled. In the event of war we could probably safely assume that Koweit would be on our side and her territory would afford us a base of operations of definite value, to the use of which, on the assumption in question, no objection could be raised on the ground that we were violating her neutrality. Further, with the development of the Arabian coast air route to the East, Koweit was likely to prove more and more vital as a station on that route, especially if our relations with Iraq should at any time become so strained that we were unable to rely on the use of the Iraqi aerodromes for the purposes of that route. Colonel Fowle suggested that in point of fact it might one day be possible to avoid the use of Iraq altogether, and fly direct from Palestine to Koweit, as the range of the aircraft using the Arabian route increased. Mr. Rendel concurred with Mr. Laithwaite's estimate of the position as regards Iraq. In view of recent events in Iraq it was possible that our whole relationship with that country might have to be modified, and he considered that both the future of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty and of the position of the Royal Air Force in Iraq must be regarded as doubtful. On the general point at issue, he 7329 [9823] b* ' : i ■■ wiHI11 ent on s observed that one of the main points to be borne in mma was uie fact that Koweit was not naturally independent from either the geographical or the economic point of view. It was a port without a hmtei land, cut off at present by the Iraqi and Saudi frontiers from the territory which it would naturally feed,'' and at present denied free communication with the country behind it. Moreover, even its present trade might be jeopardised by the development of the Saudi port at Ras Tanura under the auspices of the American oil concessionaires on the Hasa coast. What was even more important was that its fresh-water supply was not derived from its own territory, but had to be imported from Iraq. It was for consideration therefore, whether it would, in fact, be practicable for His Majesty's Government to maintain the independence of Koweit as against its neighbours, at any rate c the present basis of a rather loose and ill-defined dependence on His Majesty Government. Colonel Fowle concurred generally in Mr. Rendel's description of the economic position of the sheikhdom. He pointed out, however, that Koweit haa always been the port of the deserts of northern Arabia, as Bahrein was the port of Central Arabia. In regard to the position of Koweit vis-a-vis of Iraq, he added that beside the influence which Iraq could exert by controlling Koweit's fresh water supply, it was also powerful enough to bring pressure to bear upon Koweit over, for instance, the question of smuggling. Mr. Rendel agreed that both Iraq and Saudi Arabia were in a position to exert strong pressure on Koweit. This being so, the rivalry between them over Koweit was likely to increase, unless, of course, Saudi Arabia disintegrated. The present position of Koweit between these two States was weak, and Sir Andrew Ryan's note showed how powerful an attraction Ibn Sand could exert. The question, therefore, was whether His Majesty's Government would not be well advised to develop and tighten up their own relations with Koweit in order to strengthen its position. It had, in fact, been suggested that it might be more advantageous to convert our present treaty relationship into a definite protectorate, on, for instance, the analogy of the Hadramaut, which was now regarded as part of the Aden Protectorate, but where our treaty relationship with the local rulers and obligations to afford them protection had been if anything looser than those we had towards Koweit. Would not a protectorate ensure Koweit more effectively against absorption than the present attempt to maintain the sheikhdom as a kind of political vacuum in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Laithwaite drew attention to three points :— (a) At present the obligations of His Majesty's Government to Koweit were represented by their undertaking to grant '' good offices in respect of Koweit under the 1899 agreement, by their promise of 1907 that 'the town of Koweit and its boundaries belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him,'' and their undertaking of the 3rd November, 1914, that Koweit, in the event of a victory over the Turks, would be recognised by us as an independent princi pality under British protection. They were thus very general in terms, and, in accordance with our normal policy on the Arab littoral, which dated from a period in which it was possible to protect a sea port by action from the sea, but not to afford effective help inland, we had consistently endeavoured to limit our obligations, save as regards ' good offices '' to Koweit town and the immediately adjoining area. Recent experience had, however, shown that in cases of intervention from outside it w T as in fact necessary to give the Sheikh, at our discretion, and on our own terms, a measure of active assistance up to the limit of his frontiers and with the development of aircraft the problem of inland defence was now less difficult. This was to some extent a strengthening of his strict treaty position, as also possibly an extension of our strict treaty obligations. (h) With regard to the suggested establishment of a protectorate, it was necessary to consider what the reactions of the Sheikh would be, ana also what effect the proclamation of a protectorate might have on the other Arab rulers of the Gulf. It would in any case be wiser not to make an overt proclamation of this nature, since both in Bahrein and in Qatar and along the Trucial Coast it would probably rouse1 sonld ■R!' **2 ^ fedel-,,- ^an-Ws,, ?

J apprehensions and might even cause the local sheikhs to turn away from His Majesty's Government and consider submitting themselves to Persia or to Ibn Saud. (c) The basis of His Majesty's Government's present treaty relationship with Koweit was unsatisfactory. In the first place, it did not rest, as was the case with Bahrein, Muscat and the Trucial Sheikhdoms^ on a long series of formal treaties with the Sheikh dating back for over a century, or, as in the case of Qatar, on a comprehensive treaty^ but was based only on a comparatively brief correspondence exchanged between the sheikhs and His Majesty's Government since 1899 and on the reciprocal engagements, still presumably binding since they had not been abrogated, entered into in connexion with the lease of Bunder Shweikh in 1907; secondly, there were certain gaps, e.g., we had no slavery agreement with Koweit. It might, he suggested, be possible to fill in the gaps left by this correspondence and tighten our control in that way. An example was our recent request to the Sheikh for certain undertakings in regard to air facilities in his sheikhdom, one result of which would be to concentrate effective control of such facilities, whether military or civil, in the hands of His Majesty's Government. Another instance was the recent proposed amendment of the Koweit Order in Council so as to place responsibility for jurisdiction over non-Moslem foreigners in the hands of His Majesty's Government. A gradual tightening of our control of this character, particularly if pursued as a definite policy on all convenient occasions, would, he thought, at once avoid the difficulties involved in establishing a formal protectorate and would make it very much simpler. Colonel Fowle expressed the view that there did not seem to be any inter mediate position possible between a treaty relationship with the Sheikh on the present lines and a full protectorate. The Sheikh would certainly be unwilling to agree to the sheikhdom becoming a formal protectorate, and, frima facie, he (Colonel Fowle) was not much in favour of it. He agreed, however, that it would be advisable, on suitable opportunities, to try to tighten up our control over the Sheikh. On being questioned whether he did not consider that our restricted position vis-a-vis of the Sheikh in regard to the Koweit oil concession indicated the essential weakness of our treaty position, he replied that our difficulties in that case had been due rather to the special undertakings given to the United States Government in that matter than to any weakness in our normal control over the Sheikh under the treaty engagements. Had we been able, without violating our pledges to the United States Government, to tell the Sheikh that we required him to give the concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company he would have done so. Mr. Rendel drew attention to the fact that in the event of serious misgovern- ment by the Ruler of Koweit such as prejudicially to affect foreign citizens in Koweit, we might find ourselves in a difficult position vis-a-vis of the foreign Power concerned. Mr. Laithwaite said that on this point he thought that Bahrein might be regarded as locus classicus. We had for many years put up with a considerable degree of misgovernment by Sheikh Isa. But when conditions at last, in our, view, became intolerable, we did not hesitate to intervene and to depose the Sheikh. There were obvious arguments for doing so, for were we not to intervene when misgovernment had reached a certain pitch, it would be most difficult for us to justify a refusal to allow foreign Governments which might be affected to take steps to protect the interests of their nationals. He did not think that there need be any apprehension in the. case of Koweit that we would fail to bring pressure on a sheikh who was abusing his position, once it became necessary to do so. The case for early intervention would probably be stronger now that the Gulf was so much more in the public eye. The meeting then went on to consider relations between Ibn Saud and Koweit. [9823] b 24 Sir Andrew Ryan stated that he had been impressed by the apparent weakness of His Majesty's Government's position vis-a-vis of Ibn Saud with regard to Koweit. His Majesty's Government were not strongly placed when it became necessary to warn Ibn Saud to keep his hands off Koweit, since they were committed to maintaining that Koweit was technically an independent State A case in point had been the Saudi intrusions into Koweit territory, referred to in paragraph 3 of his note, when Saudi officials had performed acts of authority ^ within the limits of the sheikhdom. ^ Colonel Fowle pointed out that, in fact, our treaty engagements did entitle us to prevent foreign Powers from dealing direct with the Sheikh. Ibn Saud had certainly been informed of the special relations existing between the Sheikh and His Majesty's Government. Speaking generally, he added that, in fact little trouble was likely to be experienced with foreigners in Koweit, so long as it remained a Bedouin town ruled by a Bedouin sheikh, and not, like'Bahrein a relatively cosmopolitan commercial centre. If, however, oil were discovered within the sheikhdom, it was possible that difficulties might arise. Mr. Rendel pointed out that the Arabian air route was likely to develop quickly. If Iraq were to adopt an anti-foreign policy, and Koweit became correspondingly more important as a centre of international traffic, other countries might well wish to take advantage of the facilities there. We might well find many foreign Powers becoming increasingly interested in Koweit. We could not have it both ways, and should sooner or later have to define our position. His Majesty's Government ought, therefore, to orient their policy definitely either towards the greater independence of the sheikhdom or towards a tightening of their own control. Mr. Laithwaite agreed, and added that, in his view, our policy should be directed towards a closer control, but that it was undesirable to hasten any overt declaration of full control, such as the establishment of a protectorate would be. Such a declaration might well frighten the Sheikhs of Bahrein and of the Truciai Coast, and do more harm than good. The policy to be followed was, therefore, one of occasional minor adjustments, as these became necessary, tending to increase, or at any rate not to relax, our control over the sheikhdom. Reverting to the question of Saudi-Koweiti relations, Sir Andrew Ryan drew attention to the toleration extended by His Majesty's Government to direct *, correspondence on business matters between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud. This, no less than the independence formula, placed us in a weak position in defending Koweit, and the correspondence in question was of such long standing that it was difficult now for us to take the line that Ibn Saud should write to us rather than to the Sheikh. What was desirable was that we should be able to tell Ibn Saud openly that we were responsible for defending the Sheikh's interests in any given dispute. Mr. Laithwaite said that the explanation of the system of direct correspon dence between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud was, he thought, that it dated from a time when the latter was not so important a ruler as he had since become, and when we had taken the view that it was unnecessary to take too strict a view of correspondence between sheikh and sheikh. That position was now changed, and reconsideration seemed desirable. Ibn Saud was well aware both that His Majesty s Government conducted the foreign relations of Koweit and that the Sheikh had undertaken certain obligations towards us. He agreed that it was now necessary to exert stricter control over the correspondence in question and to emphasise our own special position in Koweit vis-a-vis of Ibn Saud more definitely than had been the case while Iraq was still under British control. He suggested that we might (a) check Ibn Saud when he appeared to be presuming too far with regard to Koweit—a policy which we were, in fact, now prepared to follow in regard to the Saudi-Koweit blockade; and (h) enforce stricter l egulations on the Sheikh in the matter of direct correspondence. Colonel FowZg agreed. Such action would show both the Sheikh and Ibn baud that we considered the Sheikh to be under our direction. If we did not take some such step as this, we might be in danger of finding ourselves faced with t he results of a kind of conspiracy between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud. We ought, hereiore, to write to the Sheikh in the sense that we noted that his private5 correspondence with Ibn Saud had assumed an increasing importance, and tell him that that correspondence must now cease. Mr. Rendel concurred. A straightforward control of this nature would be easier to maintain, and would prevent a repetition of such incidents as the letter in which Ibn Saud had recently tried to detach the Sheikh of Koweit from his connexion with His Majesty's Government. Sir A. Ryan also concurred, and drew attention to the success with which Ibn Saud was spreading the idea that he might naturally absorb Koweit and was bound to do so sooner or later. He pointed out that such an idea could never have prevailed to the extent to which it had, if His Majesty's Government had equally definitely made known their own special position with regard to Koweit. The meeting then discussed what point in the correspondence between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud could most suitably be taken up in connexion with the reprimand which it was proposed to address to both parties. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that if it were discovered that the Sheikh had committed himself to Ibn Saud in regard to the grant of an oil concession in the Koweit Neutral Zone, this might be an excellent opportunity for checking him. The question then arose, what action could be taken if the United States Government, in dealing with whom His Majesty's Government had consistently emphasised the Sheikh's independence, were to produce communications from him regarding the grant of a concession in the Neutral Zone? It was, however, agreed that His Majesty's Government could demonstrate from the Sheikh's treaty engagements that he had not been entitled to make any such grant without our knowledge and consent. Eventually it was agreed that the most suitable occasion for the proposed representations to the Sheikh and Ibn Saud would be Ibn Saud's letter suggesting terms for the settlement of the Saudi blockade of Koweit and warning the Sheikh against His Majesty's Government. At the conclusion of the meeting Sir A. Ryan raised the question of the pressure which might be exerted upon Ibn Saud in regard to the Saudi blockade of Koweit. This blockade had one of two purposes, either to complete the economic strangulation of Koweit and lead to its complete absorption in Saudi Arabia, or else the safeguarding of Saudi economic interests. His Majesty's Government could not possibly allow the first of these alternatives. The question, therefore, was what real force there was in Ibn Saud's suggestion that his own purely economic interests required the maintenance of the blockade. Colonel Fowle suggested that we might well revert to the Sheikh's proposal that Ibn Saud should have customs posts at a given place along but outside the Koweiti border, and that this might, if necessary, be coupled with a system of manifests for Koweiti-Saudi trade. He gave it as his opinion that even if Ibn Saud were to develop Has Tanura, possibly with American help, this port was not likely to compete seriously with Koweit, which served quite a different hinter land, nor was there any port between the Koweit area and the Ras Tanura area which could be successfully developed as a rival to Koweit. Colonel Fowle suggested that on his return to the Gulf on the 16th October he should discuss the situation with Colonel Dickson, Political Agent, Koweit, who had great experience of the sheikhdom, in the light of the conversations at the present meeting, and should submit a comprehensive report. It was agreed that this course should be adopted, and that in the light of the Resident's report and of the conclusions of the present meeting the question of future policy in Koweit should be discussed if necessary in the Middle East Official Sub-Committee. The conclusions of the meeting were as follows ;— (1) That in dealing with Ibn Saud, His Majesty's Government should increasingly emphasise the closeness of their relations with the Sheikh. (2) That the Sheikh should be told that his personal correspondence with Ibn Saud on official matters was to cease. (3) That the issue of the Saudi blockade of Koweit should be taken up with Ibn Saud by His Majesty's Government on the basis of their obligation to protect the interests of Koweit.(4A That on receipt of the despatch promised by Colonel Fowle the whole question of relations between His Majesty's Government and Koweit might suitably be referred for further discussion to the Middle East Official Sub-Committee, to which a note should be sent recording the points discussed at the present meeting, and setting forth the argu ments for and against the possible declaration of a protectorate. Appendix A. Note by Sir Andrew Ryan. Ihn Sand's Attitude towards Koweit. I HAVE been turning over in my mind for some time the possibility that it may be a definite object of Ibn Baud's policy to reduce Koweit to a position of dependence on him somewhat similar to that of Asir from 1926 to 1930. This is in the nature of a pure speculation, but it is a speculation so interesting that I think it worth while to collect the principal data bearing on it. It must be admitted at the outset that, if Ibn Saud had such an idea in his head, he would realise the need for great caution lest he should indispose His Majesty's Govern ment. His only formal obligation towards the latter is that contained in article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, but he understands very well the implications of the words therein 'who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty's Govern ment.' On the other hand, he has seen His Majesty's Government tolerate direct correspondence on business subjects between him and the Sheikh of Koweit. He might think that they would' not react over strongly if he and the Sheikh confronted them with the fait accompli of a political deal. 2. Apart from the correspondence, of which we have knowledge, there has been other intercourse between the rulers, notably the Sheikh s visit to Riadh in 1932, the secret messages brought by Ibn Saud's confidential messenger to the Sheikh early this year, and the Sheikh's mysterious dashes intoNejd last February, when Colonel Dickson surmised that he had gone to meet some high baudi personage, possibly Ibn Saud himself. ... . A 3. I may interpolate, as a minor indication of Ibn Saud s attitude, a reference to two occasions on which it has been suggested or hinted by his Ministry for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty's Government should not concern themselves with affairs between Saudi Arabia and Koweit. I class them as minor, because this position has never been categorically asserted. The first was when, m reply to a complaint of mine regarding Saudi encroachments on Koweit territory, wnicn had perturbed His Majesty's Government, the reply was in effect: 'Sorry you have been perturbed. You need not have been if the matter had been pursued through An. Nafisi.' On another occasion Fuad Bey, in rather light conversa tion, asked me why we concerned ourselves in matters between his Governmen and Koweit. tu q ^ 4. The personal relations between the two rulers are peculiar, ibn oaud grew up at Koweit, and it is sometimes said that he has shown himself ungratetu to his former hosts. It is said by others, I do not know on what precise grounds, that Mubarak treated Ibn Saud very badly. Anyhow, through all the relations there runs a thread of old friendship, however flimsy and however frayed by frequent friction over raids, the embargo and so on. It has helped towards tne settlement of minor questions. It has not deterred Ibn Saud from eniorcin^ the embargo on trade, but the embargo on trade has not destroyed the Sheikiis ostensible friendliness towards Ibn Saud. They are 'Arcades amlxv as ^ 0I1C( : wrote, and they both combine some real friendship for His Majesty's Governmen and a healthy fear of them with a good deal of fundamental mistrust. 5. The point of my theory or speculation is that, if the Sheikh of Kowei were at all willing to be ' Asirised,' Ibn Saud could make the proposal qui attractive on the following lines, if I may venture to put into his mouth the sor of language he could use :— (a) ' You are not really independent, my dear fellow. You are under the thumb of the English. They might annex you at any moment, oi e\en present you to Iraq. If you must be dependent on some one, ^ y7 be dependent on those untrustworthy imperialists, when you might depend, without being exactly dependent, on a man like me, old friend, fellow Moslem, fellow Arab and the one big independent man in Arabia ? (b) 'I don't like squeezing you, I really don't, with that embargo. As things are at present, I have to think of my own interests. But if your interests were mine, we could easily have an understanding. A sort of ' Zollverein as they say; same duties levied in our ports; free competition between yours and mine; free trade over our land border. What have the English done about it ? Nothing; because they cannot get at me. ' Sois mon frere et ie te fais vivre. Sois le leur et ie te tue.' (c) 'I should not mop you up, of course. You would rule your State under an understanding with me. Indeed, if you were in with me, I might recognise a sort of influence of yours over those three Lost Tribes that you always want back. Look at how I treated the Idrisi. I made a sensible agreement with him in 1926. He remained a ruler with tribal influence. I did not take charge in his country, until he got into such a mess that he asked me to in 1930. I did not hit him on the head until the poor mutt thought he could try conclusions with me in 1932. He looked to foreigners and he ffot it in the neck from me. (d) 'You have had trouble with Iraq over your property there. What has England been able or even willing to do for you ? If I had the right to protect you against third parties, you would find that I knew how to see you through. {e) ' Then there's oil. People are after it in my country, and in yours, and in the Neutral Zone. Why not have an agreed policy and present a common front to the West ? You know what the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is. Another name for the British Government, as we saw in Persia the other day, even if we had not known it before. Take my tip and keep them out at all costs. Play about with Holmes, if you like. But don't trust him, and remember that in the long run your best policy would be to deal, like me, direct with American interests, using the others to put up the price.' 6. It is easy enough to detect fallacies in the above imaginary address I do not know enough about the Sheikh of Koweit to judge what his reaction to it would be, but many an Arab, not well pleased with British protectors mi^ht find it convincing enough to be attracted into Ibn Saud's parlour. 7. I wrote the above notes in Jedda at the end of June. I thought them too hypothetical at that time to submit them for official consideration. They may, however, be worthy of some attention now that the Political Resident and I are both in this country, and Colonel Dickson will soon be available for consultation. Except that Ibn Saud continues to show a marked anxiety to avoid all compli cations, I see no material reason to modify what I wrote nearly three months ago, subject always to the consideration that I merely suggest an uncertain workin 0 * theory to be tested bv further examination and by keeping a close watch on future developments. August 16, 1933. Appendix B. N ote. Obligations of His Majesty's Government towards the Sheikh of Koweit. (A)— Nature of the Undertakings given. By the agreement of the 23rd Januarv, 1899, His Majesty's Government formally assured the Sheikh 'of the good offices of the British Government towards you, your heirs and successors, so long as you, your heirs and successorsscrupulously and faithfully observe the conditions of the said bond,' under which the Sheikh had pledged himself, his heirs and successors, not to receive the agent or representative of any Power or Government at Koweit without the previous sanction of the British^Government, and not to cede, sell, lease or mortgage, or p -ive for occupation or for any other purpose, any portion of his territory to the Government or subjects of any other Power without the previous consent of His Majesty's Government. ^ i ^ , 2. By article 9 of the Secret Agreement of the 15th October, 1907, for the lease of the Bunder Shweikh foreshore, the Political Agent intimated that he was ' duly authorised on behalf of the precious Imperial English Government to promise, and do hereby promise, that the town of Koweit and its boundaries likewise belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him, and that all Sheikh Mobarak's arrangements in the matter of customs, &amp;c., and all his arrangements at the present day shall remain in the hands of Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit. and of his heirs after him. and . . . In consideration of this promise the Sheikh undertook not to levy customs dues in excess of 4 per cent, on goods imported or exported by the subjects of the aforesaid p:nglish Government,' save with the approval of that Government. 3. The undertakings given in writing to the Sheikh on the 3rd November, 1914. in return for his co-operation against the Turks, contained an assurance that ' Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.' (B) —Construction of the Undertakings given to the Sheikh. 4. As will be seen, the engagements entered into by His Majesty's Govern ment with the Sheikh are in rather general terms, and it is perhaps desirable briefly to record the construction placed upon them at various times by His Majesty's Government. 5. In 1901, when there was a Turkish threat to Koweit, the \ iceroy was informed (Secretary of State's telegram No. 45 of the 4th December, 1901) that this 'appears to constitute a distinct violation of the Sultan's promise' (to respect the status quo), ' and in these circumstances His Majesty's Government are prepared to support the Sheikh, and will not tolerate an attack by Turkish troops or ships upon Koweit. The Sheikh should not leave Koweit, and should continue to observe his engagement with us.' The assurance given is clearly limited by the words ' in these circumstances ' to this particular case. More over, it is not conditional on, and is independent of the Sheikh's observance of his agreement of 1899. % 6. On the 21st March, 1902, Lord Lansdowne, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in a memorandum on the situation in Kowert, remarked that our obligations toward the Sheikh were '' as ill-defined as the boundaries of his principality. We have distinctly announced that he does not enjoy British ' protection '; on the other hand, we once made him a present of £1,000, and promised him our ' good offices,' whatever that may mean. When we made this promise we were, I feel,no doubt, thinking of Koweit proper, if there is such a thing, and not of Boobyan or other outskirts over which the Sheikh has rights of one sort or another We might, it seems to me, explain (1) to the Porte; (2) to the Sheikh; and (3) to the foreign Powers immediately interested the objects of our policy. I should be inclined to say that our engagements to Koweit do not extend beyond the district adjoining or close to the bay of that name, and to endeavour to obtain the adhesion of the Porte and of the Sheikh to our approximate definition of that district ' 7. Later, in 1902, it was reported that Ibn Rashid was making energetic preparation for attacking Ibn Saud, then the Sheikh of Koweit's friend, and the Sheikh was warned not to take any action likely to bring him into difficulties with either Nejd or Turkey. About the same time the Sheikh informed us that Ibn Saud had with him a gun presented by the Turks, and asked for a gift oi two or three guns, which it was understood were wanted for Jehara to protect Koweit against land attack. The Viceroy (telegram No. 39 of the 3rd October 1902) proposed to reply that the Sheikh's request could not be granted, but that, provided he complied with the injunction conveyed to him in pursuance o your telegram of the 4th December, 1901 (see paragraph 5 above), His Majesty 3F7^! fit Government would charge themselves with the defence of Koweit district.' The Secretary of State, after consultation with the Foreign Office (Foreign Office letter of the 13th October, 1902), replied (telegram No. 133 of the 14th October, 1902) : 'I approve your proposed reply about the guns, provided Koweit district is clearly defined as the district adjoining or close to the bay of that ^ name. This assurance similarly admits of being read as an assurance ad hoc, ▼ and it is relevant that when, in April 1911, enquiry was made by the Secretary of State for India of the Government of India whether the definition in question of Koweit territory had been communicated to the Sheikh, they replied that it might be assumed that it had, but that it '' only referred to our pledge to defend him against Ibn Rashid, who was threatening the immediate neighbourhood of Koweit ' (telegram of the 6th April, 1911). 8. The more specific undertakings embodied in the Bunder Shweikh lease of 1907, and quoted in paragraph 2 above, may be regarded as to some extent committing us in respect of 1 c the town of Koweit and its boundaries.'' The phrase '' its boundaries '' is, however, very vague, and could perhaps most reasonably be construed as applying to the immediate district around Koweit town. The discussions as to our obligations to the Sheikh which took place in 1911, and which are summarised in paragraphs 9 to 12 below, appear to have turned essentially on the undertakings of 1899. 9. In 1911, in connexion with the Anglo-Turkish negotiations, the question of our obligations was examined in some detail. The Government of India, on being asked, with reference to Lord Lansdowne's memorandum of 1902, to which reference is made in paragraph 6 above, to ' define the region to which our obligation extends,' and ' whether they accepted ' general description of boundaries in Persian Gulf Gazetteer, p. 1059. &amp;c., replied: We are of opinion that (1) our obligations extend to the limits of the Sheikh's territory; (2) these limits, to the best of our knowledge, are defined with fair accuracy by Lorimer, especially as regards northern portion. ...' 10. The Secretary of State for India, in the light of the Government of India's views, wrote as follows to the Foreign Office (the 8th April, 1911) ' Viscount Morley is not aware on what grounds the opinion expressed by the Marquess of Lansdowne in his memorandum of the 21st March, 1902, is based, but he observes that the language used is very tentative, and, so far as he knows, the subject was never pursued along the lines suggested bv his Lordship, except in the case of the attack on the immediate neighbour hood of Koweit threatened by Ibn Rashid in the autumn of 1902. It will be seen from the Government of India's telegram of the 6th April that this incident does not affect their opinion that our general obligations extend to the limits of Koweit territory as described in Vol. II, pp. 1059-1061, of Lorimer s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, copy of which is in your possession In this Lord Morley concurs; that is to say, he thinks that, in the event of unprovoked aggression by the Turks or by Arab tribes under Turkish control, upon those limits, His Majesty's Government could not abstain from using their ' good offices ' in the Sheikh's favour. But the term ' good offices is a very vague one, which His Majesty's Government are at liberty to inteipret at their discretion, and which they would doubtless interpret with more or less strictness, according to the nature and locality of the aggression, and all the circumstances of the case. It would, however, in his Lordship's opinion, be very impolitic to attempt, in dealing with the Sheikh, to whittle down the extent of our obligations, since such a course would fill his mind with suspicions, and could not fail to affect unfavourablv our prestige in the Persian Gulf. ...' 11. The Foreign Office replied, on the 9th May, 1911, that Sir E. Grey concurred in the view of the Government of India, shared by Viscount Morley, that these obligations extend to the whole territory of the Sheikh, as described m the passage oi Lorimer's Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf to which your letter refers.' - p , 12 -, In A) 1 S ust 1911 Government of India, after consultation with the Political Resident (Sir P. Cox), recommended that His Majesty's Government should communicate to the Turks a copy of the agreement of 1899, with a note that His Majesty's Government had subsequently' informed the Sheikh that, so long as he and his hen s and successors acted up to their obligations under the agreement, we charged oui selves to support them and to protect Koweit against [9823]10 attack by land or sea. The Secretary of State for India, on closer consideration found himself unable to accept this proposal. India Office letter to the Foreign Office of the 30th October, 1911, remarked s® ' The telegrams of the 4th December, 1901, and the 14th October, 1902 on which the Government of India appear to base the obligation to protect Koweit by land and sea, in the Marquess of Crewe 's opinion, clearly refer only to the incidents that occasioned them, and cannot be understood to have ^ given any general undertaking. Nor, in view of the fact that it has since been decided that our obligations extend to the whole of the Sheikh's territory, as described in Lorimer's Gazetteer, would it be safe to pledge ourselves to any specific method of defending them. As was pointed out by Lord Morley in this Office letter of the 8th April last, the term ' good offices (which, by Colonel Meade's letter of the 23rd January, 1899, we undertook to accord to the Sheikh) is a conveniently vague one, and Lord Crewe is of opinion that it is neither necessary nor safe to go beyond it. The action taken by His Majesty's Government in 1901-02, when men and guns were landed at Koweit to defend it against unprovoked Turkish aggression, will, moreover, have made it plain to the Porte in what way we are prepared to interpret the term if necessity arises. 4 ' His Lordship would therefore suggest that the formula should run: 4 As regards No. 1, His Majesty's Government have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that, so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obligations under the agreement, His Majesty's Government undertake to support them and accord them their good offices,' with, perhaps, the addition that His Majesty's Government reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion.' The Foreign Office (Foreign Office letter dated the 1st November, 1911) accepted the proposed redraft and addition, and a communication in this sense was made to Tevfik Pasha in Sir Edward Grey's letter of the 24th October, 1911. 13. The undertaking given in 1914 that Koweit 'shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection,' may be regarded as importing a degree of responsibility for the protection of the principality as a whole. 14. On the death of Sheikh Mobarak his eldest son was informed, in March 1916, on his accession, by the Viceroy, that, ' so long as you act up to the existing arrangements with the British Government, you may expect the same support as was enjoyed by your father.' A similar assurance was given on Sheikh Jabir's death in 1917 to his brother and successor. Sheikh Salim, in March 1917. Sheikh Salim's conduct was unsatisfactory, and it was found necessary to warn him, through the Political Resident, on the 5th July, 1918, that the assurances (which presumably covered the assurance of the 3rd November, 1914) conveyed to'him on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour, and that, should acts ' contrary to the interests of His Majesty's Government unfortunately be committed in future,' 1 he would be held personally responsible. 15. In connexion with the operations against the Ikhwan in 1928, the question of the precise extent of the obligations of His Majesty's Government for the defence of Koweit was considered in the India Office, when the view was put forward that consideration of our engagements suggested that, on a strict reading, our liability could be confined to the protection of the town of Koweit, and that we are not called upon to protect Koweit territory as a whole. The history of the 1928 discussion is, however, examined in greater detail in Appendix C, to the conclusions of which attention is invited. C onclusion. 16. As will be seen from the correspondence summarised above, («) wf j uppear consistently to have taken the view that our obligations are conditional on the good behaviour of the Sheikh; (6) secondly, that, subject to this reservation, we are committed to ' good offices ' in respect of ' Koweit,' an assurance which has, since 1911, been accepted as extending to the whole territory of the sheikhdom, but which would not commit us to anything further than diplomatic support; (c) thirdly, that we have promised ' that the town of Koweit and its boundaries belong to the heirs of Sheikh Mobarak (while the payment of rent tor the Bunder Shweikh site was terminated in 1907, the agreement of 1^7 was not abrogated, and the reciprocal pledges embodied in that agreement shoulil apparently still be regarded as binding in so far as they are not affected by other subsequent instruments. We communicated article 9 of the Bunder Shweikh Agreement to Ibn Saud in 1928; and in 1933 the Political Agent, Koweit, and the Political Resident brought to notice the continued existence of the obligations of the Sheikh in regard to customs duties (paragraph 2 above) under article 10 of the agreement); (d) fourthly, that we have undertaken to recognise, and have in fact recognised, Koweit as an independent principality under British protection. No definition has been given or attempted of the meaning of British protection 5 ' in this connexion; and, while prima facie the Sheikh would apparently be justified in claiming that it represented an assurance of effective protection in respect of the whole of his principality, there is some room for discussion as to its precise implications, and it is noteworthy that no appeal appears to have been made under it either by the present Sheikh or by his predecessors. J. G. LAITHWAITE India Office, October 11, 1933. Appendix C. S upplementary N ote. Question of Liability for the Protection of Koweit against Aggression from Outside, 1928-29. Akhwan raids on Koweit had taken place in 1924 and 1925, but on an inconsiderable scale. The Akhwan raids on Iraq by Feisal-al-Dawish and the Mutair tribe at the end of 1927 had, however, more important reactions on the principality. At the request of the Sheikh His Majesty's Government agreed to aerial reconnaissance over his territory; and, with his concurrence, it was later decided to withdraw the restrictions originally imposed by His Majesty's Government on bombing in pursuit of raiders within Koweit territory. An Akhwan raid was successfully dealt with by Koweit forces at El Riqai on the 27th January, 1928, and whilst retiring into Nejd was pursued and successfully attacked by the Royal Air Force on two following days. A further raid occurred late in February, which was not opposed by ground forces, but was again success- fully pursued by the Royal Air Force for two days. In view of the possibility of further serious developments, and of the recognised liability of His Majesty's Government under existing engagements for the 'protection of Koweit '(a phrase the exact scope of which is open to argument), further defence measures were now taken. A temporary air base (political objections to a permanent station being regarded as conclusive) was established in Koweit: a flight of aeroplanes and a detachment of armoured cars were despatched to the town for its protection : three vessels of the Persian Gulf Squadron (later reduced to one) were stationed off Koweit itself, and a landing party disembarked and remained on shore until the crisis had passed. All action taken was taken with the concurrence of the Sheikh, who was, in addition, allowed to purchase from the Government of India a small supply of machine guns and Lewis guns. After some discussion His Majesty s Government and the Government of India agreed that his Excellency might be allowed to purchase armoured motor cars, on the understanding that they would be used only for defence, and would not cross the borders of Koweit in repelling raids save with the concurrence of the Political Agent. The crisis, however, passed off without incident, and the special forces which had been despatched to Koweit were withdrawn during the late spring, lor financial reasons the Sheikh abandoned the idea of purchasing armoured cars. 2. On the 15th August, 1928, the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, in order to provide against all eventualities, asked permission to send car or air recon naissances into Koweit territory and to establish a defence air base at Koweit in the event of a raid. The India Office remarked (letter of the 22nd August, 1928) . The Secretary of State would see strong objection on political grounds to the use of Koweit territory in connexion with air operations against the Akhwan, by which Koweit was not directly or immediately threatened. Having regard, however, to the treaty liability of His Majesty's Government for the protection of Koweit and to the action taken with the consent of the Sheikh in the early part of this year, he would see no objection to the grant of the authority now requested when Koweit was directly or indirectly menaced on the understanding that the prior consent of the Sheikh was obtained from' the c 212 Resident .... so far as may be practicable, on each specific occasion, and subiert to the further restriction that there shall be no question of establishing permanent base in Koweit territory.' As the result of considerable furthfi 1 interdepartmental discussion, the Air Officer Commanding was authorised on tl/ 25th September, at his discretion, to carry out occasional reconnaissances over Koweit territory, both by air and car. ' His Majesty's Government are anxious I f| however, that— ' * (1) These reconnaissances shall be carried out as infrequently and in as unprovocative a manner as possible, and (2) That the Sheikh shall be given no ground for supposing that responsi bility for the defence of Koweit has been assumed by His Maiestv 's Government, or that he himself has been relieved of his obligations in this respect. These considerations should be borne in mind by the Air Officer Commanding in acting under the authority now given him.' (Colonial Office telegram to Bagdad, No. 306 dated the 25th September, 1928.) 3. Approval was subsequently given in view of a threatened Akhwan raid over the border, to the concentration, subject to the approval of the Sheikh, of armoured cars in Koweit '' for protection of Iraqi tribes for so long a period as one month.' (Colonial Office telegram to Bagdad. No. 76, dated the 23rd February, 1929.) 4. In April 1929 the question of the policy to be adopted by the Sheikh of Koweit in the event of Nejdi tribesmen taking refuge from King Ibn Sand in Koweit territory arose, the air authorities suggested that the Sheikh should be asked to concur in the use, if necessary, of military force, the nature and extent of which should be determined by the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, for the purpose of preventing any such refugees from entering or remaining in any part of Koweit territory. On the 8th May, 1929, the India Office, in a letter to the Colonial Office, remarked: 'Viscount Peel gathers that the attitude of the Sheikh is no longer in question and that he has already promised to endeavour to prevent refugees making use of Koweit territory. As regards the question of giving the Sheikh military assistance for this purpose, the Secretary of State remains of his previous opinion that it is undesirable to extend in any way the general liability hitherto accepted by His Majesty's Government for the defence of Koweit territory, if this can at all be avoided It would, on the whole, be preferable, if possible, to avoid asking the Sheikh to concur in the use of military force, but if ... . such a request is still essential, he is prepared to agree that the Sheikh should be asked to concur ' The other Departments regarded it as essential to make a request in the sense referred to of the Sheikh and the necessary instructions were sent to the High Commissioner on the 11th May. 5. The view held as regards our liability for protection of Koweit during the operations of 1928-29 is perhaps best stated in the India Office letters of the 22nd August, 1928, and the 8th May, 1929, quoted in paragraphs 2 and 4 above. While our precise liability for protection was not investigated in any great detail, the course of action adopted in dealing with threats to Koweit territory appears to have been generally consistent with the construction of our liability suggested by Colonel Fowle in paragraph 10 of Bushire despatch No. 1365-S of the 25th October, 1933.(^ J. G. LAITHWAITE. India Office, February 6, 1934. i 1 ) [Note .—The paragraph referred to runs as follows : — Ihe 1914 agreement states that in return for the Sheikh's co-operation against the lurks Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection, ihis, unlike the phraseology of the previous agreements, is a most categorical assurance, and the word principality and not ' town ' being used, would seem definitely to place the responsibility of protecting the whole of the Koweit Sheikhdom on His Majesty's Government Personally, I cannot agree with the view quoted in paragraph 15 of the India Office note, tha on a strict reading our liability could be confined to the protection of the town o Koweit, and that we are not called upon to protect Koweit as a whole.' It is true, as pointed ■out in the note, paragraph 16 {d), that neither the present Sheikh, nor his predecessors, appear to have appealed under this agreement to His Majesty's Government, but that hardly relieves 's from our obligations. This does not imply, of course, that His Majesty's Govern- 0 .^§ a J 1(&gt;n s relieve the Sheikh completely of the responsibility of his own defence^ Ihe Sheikh should certainly be able to deal with any small raids across his frontiers, and b iou ^ on y ook for assistance from His Majesty's Government in the case of more serious ™ 0n \ uf' was P resurna bly the attitude taken up after the Akhwan operations ™' When Sheikh was encouraged to purchase half-a-dozen Ford vanettes, Lewis guns, fr unin^^ vanettes ' an d ammunition, and when some of his men receive training from the Royal Air Force as machine -gunners.']13 [E 7141/16/91] 2.— India Office to Foreign Office.—{Received November 22.) Sir, India Office, November 21, 1933. I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to transmit to you, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf respecting relations with Koweit. I am, &amp;c. S. F. STEWART. Enclosure in 2. Political Resident, Persian Gulf, to Secretary of State for India. (Confidential.) Sir, Bushire, October 25, 1933. I HAVE the honour to refer to your letter dated the 13th October, 1933, enclosing a copy of the record of an interdepartmental meeting held at the Foreign Office on the 5th instant, note by Sir Andrew Ryan on Ibn Sand's attitude towards Koweit, and India Office provisional note, dated the 11th October, 1933, on the obligations of His Majesty's Government towards the Sheikh of Koweit. I discussed the matter with the Political Agent, Koweit, when I passed through there recently on my way to Bushire. 2. One of the two questions (the other is dealt with below in paragraphs 7 and 8) discussed at the meeting was, briefly, whether, with a view to maintaining our control over Koweit, which was undoubtedly fast increasing in importance as a political and strategical centre in the Middle East, {a) it was advisable to declare a British protectorate over that sheikhdom, or {b) whether sufficient control could not be obtained over it by adopting a policy of tightening up our control over the sheikh as opportunity offered by filling in the gaps which at present existed in our agreements with him. 3. As will be seen from the record, prima facie, I favoured (b) rather than («), and further reflection and my discussion with Colonel Dickson, who agrees with me, has confirmed me in that opinion. The objections to (a) are that, in our {i.e., Colonel Dickson and my) opinion, a protectorate would most probably meet with considerable opposition from the sheikh, who, while valuing his British connexion, values equally highly his independence in the eyes of his fellow Arab rulers, and the outside world in general. The declaration of such a protectorate would likewise alarm the other sheikhs on the Arab coast of the Gulf. It might also involve His Majesty's Government in a measure of interference in the internal affairs of Koweit which can at present be avoided. The question of slavery in Koweit, for example, as part of the slavery question in the Gulf generally, will doubtless be raised in the future by the recently established Permanent Slavery Committee of the League of Nations, and as we have no slave agreement with the ruler, such as exists with the other Arab rulers by which the local Political Agent can manumit slaves, the Koweit aspect of this problem offers special difficulties. So long as Koweit remains 'independent,' His Majesty's Government's responsibility in the matter is presumably limited to representations and persuasions to the sheikh. In the event, however, of a British protectorate being declared over the sheikhdom. His Majesty's Govern ment might possibly be committed to more drastic action. Finally, it is not improbable, though this is a matter outside my sphere, that the declaration of a Koweit protectorate might lead to somewhat awkward accusations from other Governments of 'land grabbing' and the like, with which we have been familiar enough in the past with regard to other areas. 4. An examination of the alternative policy {b) shows that, unsatisfactory as our present treaty relationship with the sheikh may be (as was pointed out at the meeting), we have a certain control over the ruler (see India Office note— Obligations of His Majesty's Government towards the Sheikh of Koweit), and where our agreements show gaps, these can, to a large extent, be filled up. Thus, control of aviation through Koweit, whether military or civil, would be in the hands of His Majesty's Government under the proposed air agreement {videcorrespondence ending with India Office letter dated the 11th August, 1933 to the Government of India. Foreign and Political Department) with the sheikh while the proposed amendment of the Koweit Order in Council (vide correspon dence ending with Government of India, Foreign and Political Department express letter dated the 21st August, 1933, to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India) would place jurisdiction over non-Moslem foreigners in Koweit in the hands of the Political Agent. 5. A third 'gap ' is the habit of direct correspondence which has grown up between the sheikh and Ibn baud, and which was dealt with at some length at the meeting. The outcome of my discussion with Colonel Dickson on this point is as follows : There would appear to be two ways in which we can ensure control over this correspondence : — (1) By informing the sheikh that before despatching any official communi cation to Ibn Saud he should show it to the Political Agent, and should take similar action with communications received from Ibn Saud. This has been the sheikh s custom in the past, at any rate in regard to his outward correspondence; whether he has shown all Ibn Sand's official letters- to Colonel Dickson, we do not, of course, know. After the sheikh had received our communication, which would! of course, be tactfully worded and would merely ask him to continue the practice which he already observed, he would not be able to quote officially any letters which he had not shown to the Political Agent. If, for instance, in order to present His Majesty's Government with a fait accompli on some point agreed upon between Ibn Saud and himself, he should produce a communication which had not been seen by the Political Agent, we could ignore it. Both Colonel Dickson and I think that perhaps it would be better in our communication not to refer to any particular correspondence, but to treat the matter on general grounds. The above refers, of course, to official correspondence; nothing we can do will prevent ' private and personal ' letters passing between the two potentates. (2) The second alternative is to insist that official correspondence between the sheikh and Ibn Sand should pass through His Majesty's Government's local representatives: the Minister at Jedda, and the Political Agent, Koweit (or, perhaps, the Resident, Persian Gulf). This is already the procedure in force (at the sheikh's own request) in regard to the sheikh's correspondence with the Iraq Government, and so no new departure in principle would be involved. The advantage of this alternative would be its emphasis to Ibn Saud of the special relations that Koweit has with His Majesty's Government, which emphasis is apparently particularly needed at the present juncture (vide conclusion 1 of the meeting). As against this advantage. Colonel Dickson is of the opinion that the sheikh, who regards Ibn Saud, in spite of the latter's treatment of Koweit, in a somewhat different light to Iraq, might object more or less strongly to the proposal. 6. Considering all the circumstances, I would suggest that I be authorised to instruct Colonel Dickson to approach the sheikh verbally on the following lines : That His Majesty's Government have had it recently brought to their notice that Ibn Saud apparently harbours designs of trying to reduce Koweit to a position of dependence on him, similar—for instance—to that of Asir; that it is possible that the practice of direct correspondence between him—the sheikh— and Ibn Saud which has grown up of late, even though he—the sheikh— shows the correspondence to the Political Agent, has somewhat obscured in the eyes of Ibn Saud the fact of Koweit s special relations of protection, &amp;c., with His Majesty's Government; that it would put this correspondence on a safer and more regular footing, if it was conducted as was the correspondence with the Iraq Government, i.e., through His Majesty s Government's local representatives; that, in addition, an intimation to this effect to Ibn Saud would bring sharply to his notice Koweit's relations with His Majesty's Government; and that, finally, His Majesty's Government would be glad to learn, confidentially and informally, what were his -the sheikh's—reactions to the proposal. I trust I may be authorised to take this step as soon as possible, and when the sheikh s attitude has become known I will make recommendations as to which alternative should be adopted. 7. The other question discussed at the meeting (referred to at the beginning of paragraph 2 above) was the exact extent of His Majesty's Government s 115 obligations to protect the interests of Koweit. The most important of these obligations, which are dealt with in the India Office note on the subject, and the one which in a sense determines any others there may be, is that of protection against hostile incursions or invasions. His Majesty's Government s agreements with the sheikh are three in number : that of January 1899, that of October 1907 and that of November 1914. 8. The agreement of 1899, as far as ' protection ' is concerned, in return for the good behaviour of the sheikh and his successors, merely promised '' the good offices' of His Majesty's Government, 'whatever that may mean' as Lord Lansdowne later remarked. Our construction of this agreement appears to have been the convenient one that we could choose the circumstances in which we need, or need not, protect Koweit in any particular crisis that arose, the exact area which we were responsible for defending being left more or less vague. 9. The agreement of 1907 merely confirmed from His Majesty's Govern ment that '' the town of Koweit and its boundaries '' belonged to the sheikh of that day and his successors. This agreement in no way added, in principle, to our nebulous responsibilities for the defence of Koweit, though, possibly, read with that of 1899, it might increase these responsibilities up to the ' boundaries.' 10. The 1914 agreement states that, in return for the sheikh's co-operation against the Turks, ' Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.' This, unlike the phraseology of the previous agree ments, is a most categorical assurance, and the word 'principality,' and not ' town,' being used would seem definitely to place the responsibility of protecting the whole of the Koweit sheikhdom on His Majesty's Government. Personally, I cannot agree with the view quoted in paragraph 15 of the India Office note that ' on a strict reading our liability could be confined to the protection of the town of Koweit, and that we are not called upon to protect Koweit as a whole.' It is true, as pointed out in the note (paragraph 16 (d)), that neither the present sheikh, nor his predecessors, appear to have appealed under this agreement to His Majesty's Government, but that hardly relieves us from our obligations. This does not imply, of course, that His Majesty's Government's obligations relieve the sheikh completely of the responsibility of his own defence. The sheikh should certainly be able to deal with any small raids across his frontiers, and should only look for assistance from His Majesty's Government in the case of more serious incursions. This, in fact, was presumably the attitude taken up after the Akhwan operations of 1928, when the sheikh was encouraged to purchase half a dozen Ford vanettes, Lewis guns which were mounted in the vanettes, and ammunition, and when some of his men received training from the Royal Air Force as machine gunners. 11. In conclusion, I venture to suggest that this question, the exact extent of the obligations of His Majesty's Government for the protection of Koweit, be investigated with a view to a definite decision on the subject. The question is an important one, and the advantages of having a clear conception of what our responsibilities may be in time of crisis, before such a crisis arises, are obvious. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India and His Majesty's Minister at Jedda. I have, &amp;c. T. C. FOWLE, Lieutenant-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. [E 7141/16/91] 3.— Mr. Johnstone to Mr. Laithwaite. My dear Laithwaite, Foreign Office, November 25, 1933. WITH reference to our telephone conversation yesterday, I write to confirm what I said to you about Ryan's views on the proposed instructions to Dickson, which are outlined in paragraph 6 of Fowle's official letter of the 25th October regarding Saudi-Koweit relations. On a cursory reading of that letter, Ryan concurred generally in the proposed instructions, except for the opening clause, which states that Ibn Saud intends to reduce Koweit to the same sort of position as Asir. In Ryan's view, itis undesirable to say anything to the sheikh in the sense of that clause, as it miffht conceivably come to the ears of Thn Saud, whether through the sheikh h or indirectly, with unfortunate effect on our relations with him. Ryan therefore suggests that this sentence should be omitted from the instructions. send you this simply as a record of Ryan's remarks to me; I gather that he spoke to you in the same sense. Fowle's letter has not yet been considered by my higher authorities. - „ . D lours sincerely, KENNETH JOHNSTONE. [E 775/739/91] 4—India Office to Foreign Office.—{Received February 1.)* gi r India Office, February 1,1934. I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that he has had under his consideration the proceedings of the interdepartmental meeting held at the Foreign Office on Thursday, the 5th October, 1933, to discuss relations between His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and the Sheikh of Koweit, and also the Political Resident's despatch of the 25th October, 1933, containing Colonel Fowle's recommendations on the tentative conclusions of the meeting in question in the light of discussion of them with the Political Agent, Koweit. 2. In the light of Colonel Fowle's views, Sir Samuel Hoare is definitely of opinion that the question of declaring a protectorate over Koweit should not at present be further pursued, and he considers that it should be possible to ensure a sufficient degree of British control over the sheikhdom by adopting a policy of tightening up our control over the sheikh as opportunity offers, by filling in the gaps which at present exist in the agreements between the sheikh and His Majesty's Government. The gaps (with the exception of that discussed in the following paragraph and of a slavery agreement) are not, in fact, very serious. Apart from the major assurances contained in the agreement of 1899, the sheikh has already given undertakings in respect of the arms traffic; he is precluded from granting a pearling, sponge-fishing, or oil concession without the approval of His Majesty's Government (though as regards oil the specific undertaking contained in the letter of the 27th October, 1913 (No. XLI on p. 264 of \ olume XI of the 1929 edition of Aitchisoris Treaties), is by no means so clear as could be desired); the control of aviation, whether military or civil, in his State will pass to His Majesty's Government in the event of his accepting the proposals which the Resident has recently been instructed to make to him on this subject; while the proposed amendment of the Koweit Order in Council, once the sheikh's con currence in this has been obtained, will place the question of jurisdiction over non- Moslem foreigners in his State on a securer and more satisfactory basis. 3. The delicate question of the direct correspondence which has gradually established itself between the sheikh and Ibn Saud remains for consideration- Sir Samuel Hoare has considered the alternatives discussed in paragraph 5 ot Colonel Fowle's despatch of the 25th October, and as a result he is of opinion, subject to the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that the first alternative suggested by the Resident (which incidentally is, apparently, likely to prove the less objectionable to the sheikh) is the right solution. Subject to Sir John Simon's concurrence, he would propose, however, to approve tne Resident's recommendation that Colonel Dickson should approach the sheikn verbally on the lines suggested in paragraph 6 of Bushire despatch under con sideration, with the modification suggested in Mr. Johnstone's demi -official letter of the 25th November last to Mr. Laithwaite. Sir Samuel Hoare would also propose that it might be left to Colonel Fowle's discretion, after the sheikn s attitude has become known, to settle the matter in accordance with either ot the alternatives discussed in paragraph 5 of his despatch. The important question whether special action should be taken to emphasise at Jedda to Ibn Saud t e nature of the relations which exist between His Majesty's Government and t e sheikh might be considered when a report has been received from Colonel ^ oW e ; 4. The question of the obligations of His Majesty's Government ioi 1 protection of Koweit, to which the Resident refers in paragraphs 7-11 ot 18 ■mwrr'—iiiiinimiii17 despatch, is one of considerable importance. The general position is examined in the India Office memorandum B. 427/P.Z. 6535/33, of which copies have already been communicated to the Foreign Office. The Secretary of State agrees with the Political Resident that the agreements of 1899 and 1907, containing as they do merely a promise of good offices, the applicability of which to the whole sheikhdom as distinct from the town of Koweit is open to doubt, are not of great material importance so far as 'protection' is concerned. The undertaking of real importance is that given to the sheikh in 1914 in return for the co-operation of his predecessor against the Turks. 5. Subject to Sir John Simon's views, Sir Samuel Hoare, on a consideration of the position as a whole, is in agreement with Colonel Fowle's view that the phraseology of this undertaking and the use of the word 'sheikhdom' and not town would appear to place definitely a responsibility for the protection of the whole principality of Koweit on His Majesty's Government. He is, at the same time, in entire agreement with the Resident that such an obligation, if His Majesty's Government now formally confirm that they recognise its existence, cannot be regarded as relieving the sheikh completely of the responsibility of his own defence, and that '' the sheikh should certainly be able to deal with any small raids across his frontiers and should only look for assistance from His Majesty's Government in the case of more serious incursions.' Such a construction would, as Colonel Fowle suggests, be consistent with the attitude adopted by His Majesty's Government after the Akhwan operations of 1928-29, though it is relevant that no close examination of the precise obligations in the matter of His Majesty's Government was undertaken at that time. Should Sir John Simon share the views expressed in this paragraph, Sir Samuel Hoare will cause the Resident to be instructed accordingly. 6. While the Secretary of State, as stated above, would be opposed to the declaration of a protectorate, and is satisfied, as at present advised, that the desiderata of His Majesty's Government can be sufficiently secured by indirect tightening up of our control over the sheikh, he is at the same time impressed by the informal character of the engagements which have been entered into on behalf of Koweit. He would, therefore, be disposed to see advantage in consolidating the various undertakings which have from time to time been given on either side in a formal treaty on the lines of the Qatar Treaty of 1916, could this be secured without much difficulty. This would probably involve a reiteration and possibly a more formal specification by His Majesty's Government of their responsibility for protection of the principality of Koweit. Moreover, as stated in the India Office note B. 427/P.Z. 6535/33 on this subject, the assurances at present given to the sheikh are, in practice, renewed to each successor in return for his acceptance of the obligations, liability for which was accepted by his predecessors, and in 1918 it appears to have been held that our obligations held good only so long as the ruling sheikh on his side complied with his engagements. It is arguable that a formal treaty might place a heavier burden on His Majesty's Government with out correspondingly binding the sheikh. But it seems doubtful whether this view could, in fact, be sustained. Formal recognition by His Majesty's Government of a Sheikh of Koweit would presumably be necessary before the engagements entered into with previous sheikhs could be regarded as binding on either party. Any formal comprehensive treaty which might be drawn up could presumably be so framed as to make it clear that obligations were entirely reciprocal, and that the liability of His Majesty's Government held good only so long as they were satisfied with the performance by the sheikh of his obligations under the treaty. Finally, so far as protection is concerned, if the view suggested in paragraph 5 above is accepted, that a general liability (within the limits described) for the protection of the principality of Koweit as a whole must already be regarded as resting on His Majesty's Government, no material increase of their responsibilities would be involved in reiterating their acceptance of that liability in a formal treaty, while the mere fact of reiteration might make it easier to obtain the consent of the sheikh to a consolidating agreement. The Secretary of State would welcome Sir John Simon's views on this point. 7. Subject to the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of State would suggest that, in view of the small margin of difference which appears to exist between the provisional recommendations of the inter departmental conference of the 5th October last, the recommendations of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the proposals in this letter it will be [9823] ' D18 unnecessary, if those proposals commend themselves to Sir John Sim the question for discussion to the Official Middle East Sub -Committe OI1 n to . re ^ er the relevant papers might, however, once final instructions havp h^' ? pies of Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, be circulated for information t 86 ^ t0 tlie Departments represented on that committee. t ^ e 0 ^er I am, &amp;c.

I AM directed by Secretary Sir John Simo/you\'ilflay before Secretary Sir bamuel Hoare the following observations on India oS letter of the 1st February, regarding relations between His Majesty's Govenimem in the United Kingdom and the Sheikh of Koweit. eminent 2. Sir John Simon concurs in the view expressed in paragranh 2 of tW etter that the question of declaring a protectorate over Koweit should not fo the present be further pursued. or a u - ^ lth ^ e g arci , t0 the question of direct correspondence between the sheikh and King Ibn Sand, Sir John Simon agrees that the sheikh should first be sounded orally m the sense suggested in paragraph 3 of your letter. He would, however suggest that thereafter the Political Resident should report further which of 1Ve i C Q 0 Q 1 Q rS t S 0f aCtl0n d i scu ® s ® d in Paragraph 5 of his despatch of the 25th October, 1933, he recommends, before adopting either, in order that His Majesty s Minister at Jedda may be given an opportunity of furnishing his observations. As at present advised, Sir John Simon is inclined to prefer th second alternative proposed by Colonel Fowle (viz., that all official correspondence between the sheikh and Ibn baud should pass exclusively through the Political Resident or I ohtical Agent and his Majestv's representative at Jedda) as emphasising more strongly the special position of His Majesty's Government in Koweit and placing a more effectual check upon Ibn Saud's attempts to strengthen his own position there to the detriment of that held by His Maiesty's Government I his course would, in Sir John Simon's view, have the additional advantage that the influence of His Majesty's representative at Jedda could, when necessary, be more easily exerted upon the Saudi Government, if he were tne actual channel of the sheikh's communications. t' ^ cas ^' a PP ears that, were the first alternative adopted, it would not be sufficient simply to exercise a discreet control in Koweit over direct correspondence between King Ibn Saud and the sheikh. For, although the iff s sicle . of the correspondence would be seen by the Political A^ent. there 110 ^^cation ot this fact on the document which reached Ibn Saud. li, tnereiore, the sheikh were to send Ibn Saud a letter which the Political Agent a no seen and which His Majesty's Government wished to repudiate on that ground, they might find some difficulty in establishing with King Ibn Saud the ac 1 , f e ) were justified in doing so, since, so far as he could see, this letter wo V i 0 u 0 i f authentic than others which he had exchanged with the sheikh, f/ 1 . y lu ■ o- t ^ ee i P. tacitly led to consider perfectly in order.

He has also considered the proposal in paragraph 6 of that letter for the conclusion of a new and comprehensive treaty between His Majesty's Government m the United Kingdom and the sheikh, which should include inter alia the acceptance by His Majesty's Government of a general liability for the protection of the whole sheikhdom within the limits indicated in paragraph 10 of Colonel Fowle s despatch of the 25th October, referred to above. While agreeing that there would be advantage in such a treaty. Sir John Simon assumes that it is not proposed to undertake the negotiation of it immediately. Prima facie it seems inadvisable to raise a possibly controversial issue of such importance with the sheikh until the question of his relations with King Ibn Saud and that of the projected oil concession (which appears likely to indispose the sheikh, since he may lose financially by the elimination of competition between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the United States oil interests) have been disposed of. 9. As regards the possibility mentioned in paragraph 6 of your letter, that a^ formal treaty might be considered to place a heavier burden on His Majesty's Government than that which they at present bear in respect of Koweit, without correspondingly binding the sheikh, I am to observe that, in accordance with the construction which is usually placed upon treaties with heads of States, auy formal treaty concluded with the Sheikh of Koweit would attach to Koweit as a State, and would apply automatically to the sheikh's successors. The under takings given by the two contracting parties to a treaty must certainly be construed as reciprocal. Sir John Simon notes, however, from statements made by the India Office representative at the meeting held at the Foreign Office on the 5th October to discuss this question, that it is considered that His Majesty's Government could and would remove a Sheikh of Koweit for hopeless misgovern- ment. He presumes, therefore, that His Majesty's Government could in practice prevent the accession of a ruler who seemed unlikely to observe his treaty obligations towards them, or could, at any rate, remove a ruler who after his accession in fact refused to observe those obligations. If this be so, there appears no ground for fearing that a situation might arise in which His Majesty's Government would be faced with the alternatives either of acquiescing in a refusal by the sheikh to recognise his treaty obligations or of putting an end to their treaty relations with Koweit. 10. Sir John Simon concurs in the view of Sir Samuel Hoare that it is unnecessary to refer this question to the Official Middle East Sub-Committee, but he assumes that copies of the relevant papers will be circulated later to the Departments represented thereupon.

A concession in respect of red oxide deposits on xiba Masa was granted by Sheikh Salim-bin-Sultan ex Shaikh- of Shargah, while acting as Regent in the absence at Mecca of his nephew Sheikh Sagar-bin- IChalid, Ruler of Shargah, on 10th April 1898 to Hassan Samaiyeh, his son Abdullah, and Isa bin Abdul Latif, son of the Residency Agent at Shargah. The ruling Sheikh on return 'saw nothing objectionable in it, and so I acquiesced in it Tr . The concessionnaires are described in the subsequent official correspondence as British subjects. In 1899, the ruling Sheikh associated himself for a few months with the concession. The concessionnaires started the regular mining of oxide a, few months later, their plan of operations being to keep about 50 coolies on the island extracting the oxide in a leisurely way and accumulating heaps of it with which to fulfil orders when received. On 1st June 1906 Herr Wonckhaus entered into a contract with Hassan Samaiyeh to buy oxide f.o.b. On 21st February 1907 the Sheikh of Shargah cancelled the concession on the ground inter alia that Hassan Samaiyeh had entered into his contract with Herr Wtftickhaus without the Sheikh 1 s approval, A lengthy dispute. /2.

This discussion lapsed with the War, and the Foreign Office in November 1921 expressed their concurrence in the view that Messrs. Wonckhaus had no standing in regard to any new concession for mining or for exporting oxide mined under a new concession on Abu Musa, even though their pre-war claims remained unsettled» 2. Messrs. Prank C. Strick had in the pre-war period been closely interested in the possibility of obtaining a concession for the Abu Musa red oxide and had been in close contact with H.M.G., on the subject. Towards the end of 1921 they revived the question of a concession. After discussion with the interested departments and the G. of I, the company were informed on 20th January 1922 that negotiations should be coMucted through the mediation of the political Resident and were asked to furnish a general undertaking not to sell, lease, or otherwise transfer to persons who were not British subjects any concession or contract which they might obtain, from the Sheikh of Snargah. The necessary undertaking was given by the Company in a letter of 26th January, 1922. 3. The company subsequently, with the approval of H.M.G., entered into an agreement (the text of which has not been received) with the Sheikh of Shargah for a-lease of 5 years from the 1st January 1923/ —.A; ■' y£j j rt 3. % 19 23 of the red oxide deposits in Abu Musa on the follomng conditions: 1 A single irnnediate payment of Rs.6000.

It is not clear whether the agreement was, as originally contemplated by the Company, subject ,T to the usual restrictions regarding liberty of action on the island and freedom from other dues TT . Hor does any formal expression of the undertaking regarding British control referred to in the preceding paragraph appear to have been included. It was decided at the time that the undertaking in question sufficiently met the practical necessities of the case and that this point need not be pursued. 515/23. On 27th April 1923 Sir Percy IiOraine telegraphed to the Foreign Office that he had learned confidentially that the concessionnaire (the Moin-ut-Tu^jar) of the Hormuz Oxide Concession was urging the Persian Government to raise the Persian claim to Abu Musa, couple that to Bahrein, and refer both matters to the league of Nations. TT As he has considerable political importance he may succeed in persuading the Persian Government to send an agent from a Gulf port to endeavour to stop work at Abu Musa'. The fact that the Persian claim to Abu Musa ' was/Pa6S5/E3, P.1784/23. P.1852/E3. P. 2664/23. 4. v /as 'being revived Yi/as simultaneously confirmed by Messrs, Strick from information received by them from Tehran. The Foreign Office replied (Ho.88 of 1st May 1923} instructing the Minister to draw the attention of the Persian Prime Minister to the incident of 1904, when we were prepared to take naval action to remove the Persian Flag from the islands of Tamb and Abu Musa which we considered to belong to the Sheikh of Shargah, and to give him a friendly hint that it would be unwise for the Persian Government to follow the advice of the Moin-ut-Tujjar because H.M.G. would undoubtedly resent any such step and might take the measures contemplated in 1904 to counteract any Persian designs in this direction. On 11th May 1923 Messrs. StSrick reported that there was nothing fresh to advise in regard to oxide on Abu Musa, 6. On 15th May Sir Loraine informed the Foreign Office that he proposed to communicate an aide memoire regarding Abu Musa only on the lines of the instructions referred to in paragraph 4 above. f Tel. 1^0.148). The necessary communication was made on 16th May (Tehran Desp.220 of 18th May 19 23) and supplemented by oral explanations. On the 30th May he reported that the Prime Minister had apparently kept the communication to himself, as ten days later the Persian Minister/5. minister for Foreign Affairs had sent in a note claiming Persian ownership of 'both icu-b and Abu Mas a. The Note was returned J -' minister to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs through the Oriental Secretary on 26.th May. There vjere no further developments. Has Persian Gulf Administration Report -tor 192j (page 56) reported that 'A certain amount of work in mining oxide was done at Abu Musa by Messrs. Strick's representative on tie island under the supervision of the company's agent at Bunder Abbas, but so far no oxide has been shipped to Europe.' 8. She Persian Gulf Report for 1924 (page 57) reported that 'During the year Messrs. P.C.Strick &amp; Co.,in accordance with their agreement with the Sheikh of Shargah, shipped 20 tons of red oxide which had previously been mined and left by Messrs.R. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. from Abu Musa island, as a sample, to England. They did no mining themselves during the year, although their representative, Mr. Habakkuk, has been some weeks on the island'. :h Hov.1925. 9 * 0:1 9til Oo '• I 925 4116 Political Resident informed H.M.Minister that the Residency Agent had reported in September that the Persian authorities at lingah had sent a man by launch to tne Island of Abu Musa to fetch some ample bags of red oxide.

The Resident had addressed a complaint to the i-ersian customs authorities, pointing out tnat the island belonged to Shargaii and protesting against the impropriety of the action taken» Diplomatic correspondence ensued in the course of which the Persian Government asserted that Abu Musa was Persian territory; while H.LI.G. made it clear that no such claim could be admitted. The Administration Report for 19 25 (page 70) remarked that 'Messrs. IHrank C.Striok &amp; Co. have intimated that they see little chance of exporting any further quantity of red oxide from Abu Musa at present, as the quality has proved to be very inferior. In the meantime the Persian Government have laid claim to the island, but they have been informed that H.M.G. cannot recognise such a claim'. 10. iiothing further has been heard of red oxide at Abu Musa since that date. The concession for five years granted to Messrs. otrick in January 19 23 would have expired au the beginning of 1928, but there is nothing to show that any application was then made for a renewal. J.

After compliments, With the hand of pleasure I have received your confidential letter No. C.193 ; dated the 9th inst. (23.5.34), and 'understood what it contained with regard to the military aeroplanes belonging to or used in the service of His Majesty's Government. We always have pleasure in assisting in any matters that appertain to His Majesty's Government, The said military aeroplanes have, in the past, been using the aerodrome without ever being asked for anything in the way of fees, and the benzine which is imported and stored for their use is exempt from customs duty - all this in order to assist His Majesty's Government. We now confirm that they, the military aeroplanes, shall also enjoy priority in the use of any aerodrome, and without any prior permission or being charged anything. We, however, should like to draw your attention to the fact that the Bahrein Government charges on account of the said aeroplanes an annual rental of £120 apart from the customs duty^ which it levies on benzine. We pray therefore that His Majesty's Government will very kindly put us on an equality with others in this respect. Usual ending. Draft Letter to His Excellency Sheikh Sir Ahmad al-Jabir as-Sabah, K,C.I,E,, C,S,I,, Ruler of Koweit. I have the honour to refer to Your Excellency's letter No, R 4/1518 of 12th Safar 1353 (26th May 1934) to the Political Agent, Koweit, and note that Your Excellency confirms that the Royal Air Force aeroplanes shall enjoy priority in the use of any aerodrome, without prior permission, and without being charged anything, I am directed by His Majesty's Government to thank Your Excellency for this, 2, In the same letter Your Excellency draws attention to the fact that the Bahrein State are paid an annual rental of £120 in connection with Royal Air Force aeroplanes, and asks to be put on an equality with that State. 3./ ^These letters are confidential and are not for publication. The Draft Letter to the Sheikh is still under consideration.His Majesty's Government have directed me to reply as follows: It is possible that Your Excellency has not appreciated the difference between conditions at Bahrein and Koweit, ^ At Bahrein there are two aerodromes, one on Manamah island, for which the Royal Air Force pay the £120 referred to, and which is a military aerodrome, established before the civil route was opened, and the other on Muharraq,, which is used by civil and Royal Air Force aircraft, for which the same agreement has been signed by His Excellency Sheikh Hamad as has been signed by you. 4. Moreover the £130 already referred to also includes the site for the Royal i.ir Force base, quarters for personnel, ^ Rest House, ccc., which is situated on Uanamah. 5. At Koweit there is only one civil aerodrome, and no base. His Majesty's Government regret, therefore, that they cannot pay Your Excellency the £120 which is paid to Bahrein, and Your Excellency, in the light of the above facts, will doubtless see that condicions in the two States are materially different.Pol.

It was conquered about 1320 by the (Arab) rulers of Hormuz, a kingdom finally subdued by the Portuguese in 1506, but which appears to have been tributary to Persia in at any rate its later days. Bahrein appears at the same date to have fallen under Portuguese control. The Persians have adopted in a recent Note on the subject a statement that it remained under Portuguese control from 1507 to 1622. It would appear, however, that there are at any rate some breaks in the continuity of Portuguese control. An agreement of 1515 between the Portuguese and the Persians, under w T hich the King of Hormuz was to be ruler of Hormuz in the name of King Dom Manuel, his Lord,' provided inter alia that Portuguese shipping should be available to enable the Persians to invade Bahrein and Qatif. In 1522 a revolt stimulated by the King of Hormuz broke out against the Portuguese at Bahrein among other places, but was quelled, and in 1528 endeavours by the Portuguese to quell a subsequent rebellion in Bahrein against the King were beaten off. In 1559 it was temporarily occupied by the Turks, who were, however, driven out by the Portuguese in the same year. In 1602 the Portuguese were forcibly expelled from the islands by the Persians. The Persian occupation was of uncertain duration, and in their Note of 2nd August 1928 they refer to 1622 as the date on which Persia regained possession of Bahrein. They appear in any event to have had a military depot in Bahrein in 1622. Curzon states that ' the Portuguese ... in 1625 concluded a treaty with Shah Abbas, by which they restored to him all his coast possessions, retaining only the pearl banks at Bahrein. ...' 4. In or about 1718 the islands were occupied by the Arabs of Muscat, who, however, appear to have maintained their occupation for a short time only. It is not clear whether at the date of this attack the islands were derelict or whether they were held by a Persian garrison. About 1753 the Ruler under the Persian Government of the town of Bushire made a descent upon Bahrein, the chief resident tribe in which (the Huwalah Arabs—at the present day still strongly represented in the islands) was seriously divided by internal feuds, and established his authority there. In this manner the islands again became, at least in name, dependent on Persia. In 1782 the Arabs of Zubarah, on the Arabian mainland, efforts to reduce which had been made by the Governor of Bahrein under the Persians in the years immediately preceding that date, retaliated by a descent on the island of Bahrein. They defeated the Persian Governor, drove him to his fort, plundered and destroyed the town of Manama, and took possession of a Bushire vessel, with which they retired to Zubarah. A counter attack was repulsed, and in the following year the Uttabi Arabs of Zubarah, assisted by contingents from various tribes of Qatar, occupied the Bahrein islands, the Persian garrison of the Manama Fort capitulating on 28th July 1783, after a siege of about two months' duration, and being allowed to return to Bushire. Summary. 5. It will be seen that while the history of Bahrein prior to 1783 is very obscure, it would appear that Persia for not inconsiderable periods exercised control over the islands. Lhe nature of that control is not, however, very clear; it seems probable that it was only very rarely of a definite character; and even in more recent periodsPersian relations with the islands were for a substantial number of years interrupted by Portuguese occupation of or overlord ship over them. It is, however, clear that Persia or a 1 ersian vassal was in effective control of the islands during the 30 years prior to the expulsion of the Persians by the Arabs of the mainland in 1783.

Projects by the Persian Government for the re- establishment of its authority in Bahrein between 1783 and 1800 did not materialise. In 1799 the Imam of Muscat declared war on the Uttabis of Bahrein, who, alarmed bv his proceedings, opened a correspondence with the Persian Governor of Bushire, in the course of which they stated that the island originally belonged to the Turkish Government, but that it was many—about 70—years since the Turks had • been in possession of it.- He, on their offering to become ^' or - tributary to Persia, proceeded privately to Bahrein and received from them an instalment of revenue on account of ■the preceding year. Muscat occupies and loses Bahrein, 1800-01. 7. In 1800 Bahrein was occupied by the Imam of Muscat, the occupation lasting until 1801, when the Muscat forces were invested by the Uttabis and compelled to surrender and evacuate Bahrein. In 1802 the Imam of Muscat, having obtained some assistance from Bushire again landed in Bahrein and attacked the Uttabis. The latter had, however, by now secured the support of the Wahabi rulers of Central Arabia and the Muscat project was abandoned.

In 1811 the islands were freed from Wahabi rule by the Imam of Muscat, when the Uttabis were restored to power, though according to a claim subsequently made by by the Imam, in subordination to Muscat. In 1816 the Uttabis sought the protection of the Wahabi rulers of Central Arabia, and the Imam of Muscat undertook an armed expedition against Bahrein, explaining to the British authori ties that he was compelled so to act by the repudiation bv the Attabis of his suzerainty, which they had admitted in 1811, by their alliance with the Wahabis and by their piratical practices. The Muscat expedition, to which three Bushire vessels were added by the Persian Government effected a landing in the summer of 1816, but was signally repulsed and withdrew. Unsuccessful negotiations* took place later m the same year between Muscat and the Persian Bo. Sel 'Government with a view to a fresh attempt on Bahrein.

Teh. Desp. 10. In April 1817 His Majesty's Minister in Persia reported the arrival at Tehran of an agent from the Imam of Muscat, the object of whose mission was credibly stated to be to inform the Shah that His Majesty's Government contemplated the capture of Bahrein, and to ask for armed assistance for the Imam in order that he might thwart their design by taking possession of the island in the name of the Persian Government. His Majesty's representative stated that an agent of the Sheikh of Bahrein was also at Tehran, bearing a letter Avhich stated that as the inhabitants of the island were of the same sect as the natives of Persia, they had always looked up to the Persian monarch as their protector and head, and that they therefore hoped for the Teh Des assistance of His Majesty to cloak them from the oppressions No.'10 of P ' Wahabis. Approval for the grant of the military 6.5.1817. assistance desired was stated to have been given by the Shah to the Imam, but no action appears to have followed. 11. In 1818, on the appearance of the Egyptians inHasa, the Sheikh of Bahrein appears to have offered to-assist them Lor. 1,846. w ith sea transport. In February 1819 the Sheikh entered into an agreement with the British Government, with the terms of which he subsequently failed to comply, for preventing the sale of captured British property in his dominions, and in the same year he expressed great indignation at the violation by the British authorities, under a misapprehension as to the nationality of certain vessels, of the neutrality of his port. Teh. Desp. 12. On the 19th April 1819 His Majesty's Representative 25°5^1819 at Tehran reported to the Government of India that the Imam of Muscat had complained bitterly against the non- fulfilment of the engagements contracted with him by the Persian Government for the capture of Bahrein. The Minister added that letters received by him showed that the troops of Ibrahim Pasha, the Viceroy of Egypt, had occupied Bahrein (this appears to have been incorrect) and that the Imam had suggested to the Shah that he should send a messenger to the Pasha asking him to evacuate the island. The Imam is stated to have urged upon the Shah the necessity of endeavouring to recover a possession which according to him ' had for ages acknowedged the sovereignty of Persia.' He was, however, unsuccessful, and in June 1819 His Majesty's Minister reported that the Shah had ' for the present dropped all intention of taking any steps in pursuit of his pretensions to the sovereignty of the island. It may be added here that the Government of Bombay in a despatch of 21st July 1819 to the Government of India, in which they discussed the desirability of assisting the Imam of Muscat, in return for assistance in connection with the expedition pioposed against the Gulf pirates, to establish his claims to Bahrein, referred to an 'arrangement some time since concerted ' between the Shah and the Imam, whereby the formei had agreed to relinquish all claims to the island of Bahrein in favour of the Imam, under the condition of ' receiving a portion of its revenues.' Bahrein submits to Muscat, 1820, 13. The Persians, at the beginning of 1820, moved apparently by a desire to anticipate any attempt by Muscat to establish control over Bahrein with the support of His Majesty s Government, unsuccessfully requested the Imam o convey t leir tioops to Bahrein. They addressed a similar&amp;) application, equally unsuccessful, to the Commander of the w T R47 Expedition in the Persian Gulf. In the early part of J.S20 the rulers of Bahrein made full submission to the Imam ot Muscat and agreed to pay him a tribute of 30,000 dollars An instalment (12,000 dollars) of this tribute appears subsequently to Jiave been actually remitted. Policy of British Government, 1819-20. . 14 P oli cy to be adopted by the British Government m . r®g ar d to Bahrein was examined between the Government of Bombay and the Government of India in 1819-20, and was ultimately defined as one of complete neutrality. ' The Govt, of transfer of Bahrein to the Imam of Muscat had been contem- Bombay to plated, but this project, so far as the British Government G - of L ' were concerned, was now abandoned. The Government of Bombay suggested that the Sheikh should be informed that paraS ' ^ ^ so long as he restrained his subjects from piracy he would reap the advantage of a friendly neutrality on the part of Britain, whereas should a piratical spirit manifest itself forcible measures of coercion would be applied to him. ley added that the conclusion of an engagement in general terms with the Sheikh 'would probably tend to convince the Uttabi Arabs of the integrity of our intentions.'

I here is, however, reason to believe that P 8 ™. 11. provided the Persian Government will consent to the Uttabis contmumg m the undisturbed occupation of Bahrein the bheikh would readily agree to pay them tribute, and for this purpose the mediation of the British Government would be gladly afforded provided it could be employed in such a manner as to avoid anything which might in any shape involve lis in the transactions of the parties after the conclusion of the negotiation immediately referred to. . . ' Treaty of 1820 between Bahrein and His Majesty's Government. 16 On the 17th January 1820 the Sheikh agreed to surrender certain pirate craft which had taken refuge in his territories, and undertook to the British Government not to^ admit any more boats of the same character until authorised to do so by the British authorities. On the 5th February 1820 a preliminary Treaty of Peace was signed between the bheikh and His Majesty's Government, and on the 23rd February 1820 the Sheikhs were admitted to the benefits ol the General Treaty of Peace which had e, 611 made between His Majesty's Government and the Arab y T xi *' rulers of the i ersian Gulf and under which His Majesty's No - Tiii,'233. Government undertook, in return for abstention by those Aitchkon, rulers from piracy and the slave trade, that ' if any shall Vo1 - XI . attack them the British Government shall take notice of it' . m ' c (Article 10). The Sheikh of Bahrein went so far as to claim subsequently that the treaty in question established to Govt of relations of protection and dependence between the British Bombay, Government and himself, but it was made clear to him bv No - 8 ' date&lt;l the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf while on a visit 17 - 2 ' 1823 . to Bahrein in 1823 that this was not the case. ItT 30 ' Proposal for British Mediation with Bahrein not taken up P ™ 0iS ' 297 ' hy Persia, 17 ; P 11 ^ 1820 His Majesty's Minister at Tehran reported to the Government of Bombay that he had been received m audience by the Shah on 5th May and had out 2953 T3 H6 Teh. Desp., 10.5.1820. No. 1485 to Tehran. to him the proposal referred to in paragraph 15 for British mediation with a view to securiDg tribute to Persia from Bahrein. The Shah had replied that ' he wished that advices should be received from Shiraz before the mediation of the British Government to render Bahrein a tributary to Persia can be accepted.' Sir H. Willock remarked that 'the great repugnance of the Shah to the formation of any British settlement in the neighbourhood of Persia was strongly manifested by His Majesty's not immediately accepting the British mediation to obtain a tribute from the island of Bahrein, an object which he so urgently desired and which His Majesty was aware must at a future period be difficult of attainment from the already advanced stage of negotia tions between the Sheikhs of Bahrein and the Imam of Muscat.' and withdrawn (1820). IS. On the 3rd October 1820 the Government of Bombay instructed Sir H. Willock to take the earliest opportunity of informing the Persian Government ' that as our views are exclusively limited to the extirpation of piracy, it would be contrary to our policy, in the present state of the Gulf, to afford the mediation we formerly offered between His Majesty [the Shah] and the Uttabis of Bahrein.' Summary, 1783-1820. 19. In 1799 the Sheikhdom, independent since 1783, professed allegiance to Persia and paid a year's tribute, but it was immediately afterwards conquered by the Imam of Muscat, and thereafter fell under the influence and ultimately the control of the Wahabi Amir. Liberated by Muscat in 1811, it appealed to the Wahabis in 1816 against the Imam and defeated him. 1^16 or 1817 a Persian envoy was received at Bahrein and presents exchanged. While no details are available as to what precisely took place on this occasion, the incident had no effective sequel, Persian authority was S not asserted in the island between the date of the visit and 820, and in the latter year the island became temporarily subject and tributary to Muscat. t ? Bahrein entered into its first formal treaty with the British Government, and that Government, on condition that the Sheikhs abstained from piracy, undertook to ' take notice ' if any shall attack them.' IV.—1820-30. Unauthorised Agreement between Captain Bruce and the Prince Governor of Shiraz, 1822. 20. In 1822 Captain Bruce, then Political Resident in Persian Gulf, acting on his own initiative and without any authority from or prior reference to Government, having proceeded of his own accord to Shiraz there signed an agreement with the Minister of the Prince Governor of iraz, on the part of Persia. This agreement alleged, inter aia, m rtgaid to Bahrein, that the islands had always been - m G, ? ve J rn . or of Fars ' a g aillst ^e authoritv the Uttabi Sheikhs had lately become rebellious; that the f , assi ?p e t0 t ' ie Uttabis of Bahrein under the General ireaty of 1 eace with Britain in 1820 should accordingly, if fntnrL l, granl ^ be withdrawn, that no assistance should in hat on ,h ^ 7 i t0 the Uttabis of Bahreil1 . ^d rpauesLl L '-T ff 7 rj . British Government should, if or two 'tut l f ersians against Bahrein with ' one Capfc. Bruce t 0 w a r - I' other words, the title of Persia to Govt, of ^ j ^ Bahrein was explicitly admitted. The 3 9'^' conclndW thk Ca t r 1 rled r ight With Ca P tain Bruce g is nnauthonsed agreement appear to have beenthat the reversion of Bahrein to Persian authority wouJd tend &lt;c more to the tranquillity of the Arabian side of the Oriilf than almost any other act.' 21. I he Resident's action was immediately disavowed and disapproved by the Government of Bombay, in letters from the Governor to the Prince Regent of Fars (which stated that it is not the intention of this Government to take any part in the claims of the several Powers and States of the I ej sian Gulf further than may be necessary to prevent lenewal of piracy. . . . There can be nothing in t e nag [granted to the Tjttabis] to give offence to Persia, as there is not the smallest connection between it and the Bntish flag, nor the smallest pretension to supenoritv on the part of the British Governmentthe Imam of Muscat, and the Sheikh of Bahrein, and as a mark of dis approbation he was removed froqi his appointment. With regard to the clause of the agreement affecting Bahrein the Government of Bombay remarked : 44 It acknowledges the King of Persia s title to Bahrein, of which there is not the BomW to least proof, and which the British Government cannot assert Capt Bruce without injuring the pretensions of the Imam [of Muscat] and 1491 of' the Uttabis. . . On the Persian side, the Shah not only l ll- 1 ^, refused to cippiove tlie 9-rraii^enieiits wliicli held been made, but expressed his displeasure that the Prince of Shiraz Teh. Desp. should have entered into any engagement with the British No - 1' Government without his knowledge and injunctions. The agreement was thus repudiated by both sides. 1822—29. Bahrein—Muscat Disputes. 22. By 1822, if not earlier, the Sheikhs of Bahrein had Lor. I, 851. ceased to observe the engagement undertaken by them in Govr. to ooi) to pay an annual tribute to Muscat. In August 1822 Imam, an attack by Muscat on Bahrein seeming in consequence 19«8.1822. imminent, the Governor of Bombay, in letters to the Sheikh and to the Imam of Muscat, suggested that if this tribute 19.8.1822 was oi ancient origin it should be regularly paid, but that Precis, 307. otherwise it should be dropped. In January 1823 the Lor. 1,850. optical Resident (Lieut. McLeod) visited Bahrein to Resdt. to reassure the Sheikhs in regard to the unratified treaty Govt - of concluded by Captain Bruce with the Prince Governor of S 0m o ay ' uhiiaz, and to inform them that that treaty was of no effect 27 2 1823 and that no change of policy was contemplated by Govern- w't «*&gt; ment. In the spring of 1823, on rumours of a contemplated G ovt ' of joint attack on Bahrein by Persia, Muscat and the Arabs of Bombay to the mainland, the Minister at Tehran was asked at a suitable Teil -» juncture to dissuade the Persians from disturbing the N0, tranquillity of the Gulf. g 26.3.1823. 23. In February 1824 the Resident composed for a period ot two years the acute internal disputes between members of tending house which were for many years a feature of the Lor. I 851. history of Bahrein. In 1825 the Governor of Bombay personally remonstrated with the Imam of Muscat on an endeavour by the latter to interfere in the question of the Bahrein success 1011 consequent on the death in that year of bheikh Salman, who had ruled the Sheikhdom since 1796 (in Lor I iii x association m his later years with his brother Abdulla). Table 9. ' ' Eeassertion of Persian Claim, 1825. 24. In 1825 an intimation was made by the Political Resident to the Prince Governor of Fars, who had been meditating an expedition to subdue Bahrein, and whose Minister had requested the Resident to give directions to the Sheikh to strike the flag which the British Government had authorised the Uttabis of Bahrein to fly. u He was informed that no control was assumed over the people of8 Bombay Bahrein and that the letter disapproving of Captain Bruce's- Political treaty had manifested the line of conduct (Government. 2 Tis^ 811 won Id pursue in regard to Bahrein.' The expedition was Abstract. abandoned on a pretext, 'but the Sheikh averted the danger which threatened him by presents of considerable amount.' 25. In October 1828 a last attack by the Imam of Muscat was severely defeated and driven off, ' after several Lor. 1, 854. undignified attempts to conclude a peace with the ' Sheikhs of Bahrein, and on 2nd December 1829 peace was finally Lor.1,855-6. made between the Sheikhs and the Imam. The main provisions of this agreement were that tribute should not in future be paid by Bahrein to Muscat, and that neither ruler should henceforth interfere in the affairs of the other. By a supplementary verbal agreement the parties bound them selves to aid one another in the event of an attack by a third party. Summary, 1820-30. 26. During the first two years of this period the islands acknowledged the supremacy of and, for a time, paid tribute to Muscat. From 1822 to 1829 they were intermittently at feud with Muscat. In 1829 a treaty was concluded by which Muscat withdrew its claims to supremacy and to tribute. The Persian claim was alluded to in 1822 and 1825 but not pressed. V.—1830 40. Bahrein and the Wahabis, 1830-35. 27. In the course of 1830-31 the Sheikhs, His Majesty's Government having refused to intervene in their favour, and fearing a combination between the Amir and Muscat, formally submitted to the Wahabi Amir of the Arab mainland. They agreed to acknowledge the Amir's supremacy and to pay a tribute to him. He on his part undertook to protect Lor. 1,856 -7. Bahrein against external aggression. In 1833, however, the Sheikh felt strong enough to repudiate Wahabi supremacy, and he conducted a not unsuccessful offensive against the Wahabis between 1833 and 1835. Bahrein and the British Government. 28. Sheikh Khalifah-bin-Salman, who had been joint Lor. I, iii, ruler with his uncle Sheikh Abdulla since the death of Table 9. Sheikh Salman in 1825, died in 1834, and was succeeded as joint ruler by his son Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifah. Effective control continued to rest with Sheikh Abdullah. Internal dissension in the ruling family became more- marked between 1834 and 1889, and the misgovernment of the island continued to grow with unfortunate effects on its prosperity. His Majesty's Government, although in 1834 they had to take forcible measures against the Sheikh to secure reparation for an insult to their Residency Agent in Bahrein, were, however, content to abstain from any interference in the internal affairs of Bahrein so long as the Sheikhs discharged the obligations undertaken by their Treaty of 1820. R estrictive L ine applied to B ahrein , 1836. 29. In 1835 the British Government renewed the maritime truce which they had imposed in 1820 on the Arab rulers of the Gulf in the interest of the suppression of piracy. Ihe Sheikh of Bahrein was not, however, included in the renewed truce, partly apparently because he had Lor. I, 860 behaved so well that this was thought unnecessary, partly Precis, 350. because he could be easily punished in the event of this proving desirable, and partly lest in the event of his inclusion he might claim British intervention if attacked by Muscat. In March 1836 the Sheikh agreed, however, to the- ijfll iMMWI 11''9 application to Bahrein of the ' Restrictive Line,' this being a Jme laid down in that year by His Majesty's Government between which and the Persian coast no naval hostilities were in future to be permitted. ^ Redsscvtiou of P ersian c I clitti. Bahvein tTibutavij to the Wahabis, 1836. 30. In the middle of 1836 the Sheikh, alarmed by a Bombay communication from the Governor of Shiraz calling on him Selections, as a Persian subject to tender his submission to the Shah and by the possibility of the co-operation of the Imam of Lor - I ' 858 - Muscat in^ a Persian attack on Bahrein, took steps for a reconciliation with the Wahabi Amir. As a result he agreed to pay a nominal tribute of 12,000 to the Amir, the Amir on his side agreeing to supply troops for the detence ot Bahrein against external attacks and to refrain from calling on the Sheikh for marine transport in the event of a \V ahabi attack on Muscat by sea. a / t t ^ e Sheikh, with the prior approval of Her Lor I 860 Majesty s Government, was allowed to punish certain pirates. In 1839 the Resident was invoked to settle internal disputes m the ruling family, but the parties would not agree to any settlement witjiout a guarantee by Her Majesty's Government, which tier Majesty's Government were not prepared to give. Egyptian Invasion of Hasa : Sheikh professes to be a Persian Subject, 1839. x t t ^ e Egyptians conquered Hasa and cap- Bombay tured the Wahabi Amir. They thereupon demanded the Selections, payment o± tribute and certain territorial concessions from XXIV , t e Sheikh of Bahrein. The Egyptian Commander about the same time intimated to the British authorities his inten tion to attack and reduce the island. The Sheikh appealed lor assistance to the Government of India, but in the absence of instructions from Her Majesty's Government the Govern ment of India were at first not prepared to give him any pledge and the Sheikh was instructed to decide for himself as to waiting on the Egyptian representative. Much alarmed by the proceedings of the Egyptians, 'and perhaps even more so by a rumour, apparently well founded, that the oaiyed of Oman was intriguing with the Egyptians to obtain ^and hold Bahrein as a fief under the Viceroy of Egypt,' the Sheikh thereon professed, in reply to demands n l a&lt; r 1 e 0T ^ llln ? m the name of the Egyptians, to be a subject ot the 1 ersian Government. Apparently as the result of overtures by the Sheikh designed to substantiate this, the Prince Governor of Shiraz thereupon sent an envoy—one Lor I 862 Haji Qasim formerly supercargo of a trading vessel—to reside Bahrein as Persian agent, 'and to be the medium oi receiving and transmitting tiie annual tribute which the 1 ersian authorities vainly flattered themselves the Bahrein C net was^ disposed to pay for their countenance and a t0 ^ ear a Honour and a letter to tne feheikh.

Maitland, then p.fcis 375 commanding the Gulf bquadron, was instructed by the Sort, of Government of Bombay to give the Sheikh all support Bomba y to against the Egyptians, short of actually entering on hostilities. If the Sheikh asked for a new engagement with dated4 - 1839 Her Majesty s Government he should offer to transmit his proposjils to India. The Resident was simultaneously to send a formal protest to the Egyptians. On the 18th April 2953 cLor. I, 864. Lor. I, 865. Bombay Selections, XXIV, 389. Pol. Res. to Govt, of Bombay, 4.7.1839.

Hertslet 1874, p. 5. 10 the Government of India empowered the Admiral, if the Sheikh claimed British intervention and offered to place his territories under British protection, ' to assure him of the temporary protection of Her Majesty's squadron in the Gulf,' to inform the Egyptians that this pledge had been given and to urge them to abstain from futher military proceedings until the views of both Governments were known, failing which Bahrein would be defended against intervention by them until the pleasure of Her Majesty's Government had been communicated to the local authorities. In the same month the Sheikh promised the Assistant Political Resident to take no steps to place himself under the authority or protection of a foreign Power without first consulting the Political Resident. Sheikh submits to Egyptians (July 1839). 34. In July 1839 the Sheikh 'suddenly and un expectedly' acknowledged the supremacy of the Egyptians and agreed to pay them a tribute of 2,000 dollars a year, on the understaading that his local authority would be observed and that no representative of the Egyptians would be sent to reside in Bahrein. The Resident protested in writing to both the Sheikh and the Egyptians, and expostulated with the Sheikh on the way in which he was sacrificing his independence. The Sheikh explained that his action was the result of the refusal of Her Majesty's Government to give him advice or a specific assurance of support. For a trifling financial payment he had now secured immunity from interference. He offered, however, in return for a written and distinct pledge of protection, to repudiate his agreement with the Pasha and to avow himself a dependent of Her Majesty's Government; but on being pressed he refused to confirm this in writing and said that in any event it would be necessary for him to justify his change of attitude to the Egyptians on the ground that it was the result of compulsion by Her Majesty's Government. 1839-40. Views of Her Majesty's Government on future Policy towards Bahrein. 35. As a consequence of the activities of the Egyptians discussion appears about this time to have taken place as to the desirability of declaring a regular protectorate over Bahrein On 1st July 1839 the Secret Committee of the East India Company informed the Government of India that if necessary they would ' not disapprove of your entering into an engagement with the Chief of Bahrein to protect him against encroachments from Mehemet Ali, but we concur in the doubt expressed by Captain Hennell [then Political Resident] as to whether it would be expedient for that island to be taken under the protection of the British Government.' On 24th February 1840 the Foreign Office wrote to the India Board (with reference to an enquiry from the Bombay Government) that it was important that the Egyptian troops should not be allowed to take possession of Bahrein and that if the Company's troops could occupy it, even provisionally, such a measure could not fail to be attended with advantage. On the retirement of the Egyptians from Hasa in 1840 their relations with the Sheikh came to an end. Summary, 1830-40. , 1^1~33 Bahrein was subject and tributary to t le ahabi Amirs. She revolted from them in the latter year, ut in 18 t )0 again entered into an understanding, which I 111 appears to have lasted until 1838, under which Bahrein paid a tribute and received guarantees of assistance against external attack In 1838 the Wahabi Amir was himself conquered by the Egyptians. The Persians reasserted their claim in 1836, the Bahreini answer being a renewal of their understanding with the W ahabi Amirs. In 1839, when faced by a demand for tribute from i^gypt, Bahrein appealed to Persia, claimed to be a Persian subject and received a Persian envoy. But immediately alter she formally acknowledged Egyptian supremacy and paid tribute to Egypt. The visit of the Persian envoy had thus no effective sequel. VI.—1840-50. 37 In 1840 the Government of India, provoked bv the attitude which the Sheikh had adopted, decided not to restrain the Imam of Muscat in the event of his wishing to conquer Bahrein. On 27th March 1840 the Secret Committee remarked to the Government of India ' We consider our- No. 591, at -fi ' i r 1 elieved from a11 regard to the interests of the 27 - 3 - 40 - feneikn of Bahrein, and we should be glad to hear that his Pr ^ cis ' 394 - island was m possession of a friendly chieftain.' • f j 0 ^ arcl ® thf encI 0 f 1840 the Imam of Muscat India Board mioimed the Resident that while his views in regard to le^er, Bahrein remained unaltered, he had been restrained from 22 - 10 - 1840 - giving effect to them by his impression that Her Maiesty's Government were averse to the prosecution of his claim and that without their assistance or that of the Egyptians he would have no chance of success. Expulsion of Sheikh Abdullah. Succession of Sheikh Mohamed bin Khalifa (1843-68). , &lt; J 1 n ^ r 1 na ^ c ^ ssens ions in the Sheikhdom between the ruler, i-heikh Abdullah, and his grand-nephew and co- ruler, Sheikh Mohamed, became increasingly bitter, and bheikh Mohamed was finally expelled from the island. In ^November 1842 he was given permission by Her Majesty's Lor. I, 866. Government to attack Sheikh Abdullah. After a civil war which lasted from January to April 1843, Abdullah was expelled by Mohamed, who thereafter held the Sheikhdom no reply bemg sent to an appeal to restrain the attackers which was made by Abdullah to the British authorities in -February 1843: Inteigues of ex-Sheikh, 1843-49. 40. Between 1843 and 1849 the ex-Sheikh appealed at various times for the assistance of the Wahahis, the Trucial bheikhs, the Sheikh of Koweit, and the British and Persian authonties to enable him to recover his position. In 1843 Lor. I 873 Her Majesty's Government dissuaded Muscat from trying to conquer Bahrein—considerations which weighed with them being inter alia the risk of provoking the Wahabis and the danger of giving Persia an excuse to espouse the cause of the ex-bheikh. In the same year the ex-Sheikh twice visited Bushire, where he failed to find any consolation from the .Resident, who, on his stating that if disappointed by Her Majesty s Government he was ready to throw himself into the arms of Persia, informed him (October 1843) that the adherence of Persia to his cause would not be recognised by Butam unless it was open and declared. 41. In the course of his visits the ex-Sheikh entered into discussions with the nephew of the Persian Sheikh of Bushire, who, while holding no official position himself,Teh. Desp. 86, Oct. 1843. Lor. I, 875. F.O. to Teh., ISo. 23, of 21.8.1844. Hertslet, 6. Lor. I, 876- 7. 12 promised him military assistance from Persia. On repre sentations being thereupon made to the Persian Prime Minister by Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran, the Prime Minister ''informed me that Sheikh Suleiman had acted with great presumption in having interfered in political affairs without having any authority from the Government, and he said that he would reprimand him for his conduct. His Excellency added that Bahrein belonged to Persia and that she would take possession of it when more pressing affairs were disposed of. As I looked on this as mere idle boasting which was never likely to be iulfilled, I thought it unnecessary to pursue the conversation.' 42. It may be recorded that on a second visit of the ex-Sheikh to Bushire from December 1843 to March 1844, he is stated to have been received with distinction by the Persians, and to have offered, if reinstated, to pay the cost, to remit in future a large annual tribute to the Shah, and to leave one son as a hostage in Persia. His proposals were not, however, accepted by the Persian Government. 43. In 1844 the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was instructed by the Government of India to resist by force any attempt by Persia to establish troops on the island of Bahrein. During the same year the ex-Sheikh, having, while residing at Naband in South Persia, captured two Bahreini vessels, the ruling Sheikh appealed to the Resident, with the result that an injunction was issued by the Central Persian Government at the instance of the British envoy directing the Governor-General of Fars to compel Sheikh Abdulla to give up the boats he had taken and abstain from disturbing the peace of the Gulf.

Consequent on indications that Persia intended to intervene in the succession at Bahrein on behalf of the ex-Sheikh Abdullah the general question of policy was considered by Her Majesty's Government in the early part of J 844, in the light of an intimation by the Government of India that they would see the strongest objections to any such interference by Persia, which could not but react adversely on British interests. As a result, Her Majesty's Minister was informed (Foreign Office Despafch to Tehran, No. 23, dated 1st May 1844) that ' the question of the right of Persia to interfere and of the Indian Government to prevent interference necessarily depends upon the validity of the pretension put forward by Persia to the sovereignty of Bahrein. Her Majesty's Government are ignorant of the grounds of such pretension, and, assuming those grounds to be insufficient, they would claim for the British Govern ment the right to prevent, if it accorded with its policy to do so, any direct interposition of Persia in the quarrels of rival claimants to the possession of Bahrein. The British Government in India at present consider that any such disturbance as may be occasioned by military operations on the part of Persia directed against the island of Bahrein would be injurious to British interests, and, therefore, unless Persia can show that she has a clear and indis putable right to the sovereignty of Bahrein; that she has exercised it without interruption under the dynasty of the ajar family ; that consequently her present policy is directed to t e maintenance of her lawful claims and not to the assertion of a pretension not founded on law, she must beprepared to encounter in any scheme of this kind the active opposition of the British Government in India.' In these circumstances the Minister was instructed to inform the Persian Government that ' Her Majesty's Government had heard with regret that that Government contemplated taking part in the disputes respecting the Government of Bahrein ; that such a proceeding would be viewed with much jealousy by the British Government in India; and that unless the right of Persia to interfere in the matter is beyond dispute, any interference on her part might lead to unpleasant discussions with England. For, although Her Majesty's Government do not dispute the right of Persia as an independent power to adopt any line of policy not inconsistent with its engagements to foreign states which she might think advantageous to herself, they claim for themselves a corresponding right to judge and act in such matters as they may think fit.' Discussions with Persia, 1844-45. 45. On a communication in these terms being made to Teh toFO the Persian Prime Minister, the Prime Minister ^ said he No. 69 of' '' would undertake to prove the right of Persia to possession 22.6.1844. of that island, and that in the meantime he would not make any movement against it without giving previous notification of such an intention to the British Government.' 46. In February 1845 the Minister at Tehran sent home Tph a letter ieceiA/ed from the Prime Minister, from which it No. 19 of ' appeared that the Persian claim was essentially based on the 25.2.1845. Convention of 1822 between Captain Bruce and the Minister or the Prince Governor of Fars. (See paragraphs 20-21 above.) 47- Li a subsequent despatch the Minister said that he Teh. to F.O., had informed the I rime Minister that the Bruce Agreement ^ 0 • 28 of was unauthorised and had been repudiated at the time, and 18 - 3 - 1845 - that the Prime Minister had thereupon sent him a fuller statement of the grounds of the Persian claim. The result of enquiries which His Majesty's Minister had made con sequent on the receipt of this statement ' confirmed me in the opinion that this island has not formed part of the dominions of I ersia since the accession of the Kajar dynasty [1795]. It is true that the Chiefs of Bahrein have in all probability from time to time given ■peeshkesh, offerings, or tribute to this country [Persia] as a mark of superiority, as Kandahar and Herat continue to do, without an acknow ledgment of subjection,^ and it is' also not unlikely that the rulers of that island may have declared themselves to be subjects of the Shah when threatened with subjugation from ^ Bagdad, but I cannot ascertain that Persia has exercised ^ any real control over it within the last 50 or 60 years.'' The Minister added that in further support of their claim the Persian Government had sent him a gold coin struck at Bahrein in 1817 in the name of Fateh Ali Shah Ivajar, which he believed to be genuine. 48. Ihe fuller statement of claim put forward by the Secret Com- Persian Government was investigated by the Secret Com- :mitteet oBd. mittee of the East India Company, who, after detailed examination of it, reached the conclusion ' that Persia has ' ' no legitimate claim to the sovereignty of Bahrein.' It mav be remarked that the Persian claim was largely based on a general claim that the Persian Gulf from the Shatt-el- Arab to Muscat and all the islands in it belonged to * On this point the Secret Committee of the East India Company remarked : ' Presents and complimentary messages do not imply an acknowledgment of sovereignty, and they have not been confined to Persia. (Secret Committee to India Board, 31st July 1845 ) 2953 ' t-V14 Persia; that the einployrnent in English of the term ' Persian Gulf' was itself evidence of this; that from about 1300 A.D. the island of Bahrein had always been in the possession of the Governors of Fars and had paid revenue to them until its conquest in 1783 by the Uttabi Arabs, from which tribe &lt;4 itself, likewise, presents have generally been sent to the Governors of Fars ' ; that Her Majesty's Government had recognised the position when they warned Mehemet AH of Egypt in 1840 not to attack Bahrein, which did not form part of Arabia, but rather of the Persian Gulf ; ' and that accordingly the British Govern ment would not allow him to extend the hand of possession over that island ' ; that the British authorities had formally and repeatedly asked Persia to rent the island to them and that British representatives at Tehran had frequently declared that Her Majesty's Government had no right what ever to the Gulf or its islands [there is no foundation for either statement] ; and that the fact that Captain Bruce's treaty was on record supported the Persian claim. The following extract, which (except as regards the initial date) appears correctly to represent the true facts, may, however, be placed on record from the Prime Minister's memorandum : ' In the commencement of the reign of His Majesty the late Shah, the Arabs of Beni Attabi came from the desert and conquered the island by sea. The object and desire of the Persian Government has since always been and is the recovery of that island from its spoilers.' 49. Her Majesty's Government, in view of the unlikeli-* hood that Persia had, or could give effect to, any serious designs in Bahrein and the undesirability of engaging in those circumstances in a correspondence which might merely cause irritation without serving any useful purpose, instructed the Minister at Tehran not to revert to the subject unless it was forced upon him by the Persian Prime Minister. In that case he was to employ certain arguments supplied to him (apparently the critical comments of the Secret Committee of the East India Company on the Prime f o t t Mil ? ister ' s memorandum) to show generally the grounds on No. 38° of e w hich Her Majesty's Government were ' unable to recognise 7.8 1845. as va ^ t 'h e claims advanced by Persia to the sovereignty of Bahrein, and you may add that they would . . . very much disappiove of any attempts on the part of Persia to interfere m the affairs of that island and thus disturb the peace of the Gulf and to afford an opening to piracy.' The question appears to have dropped for the time being.

A request by the ruling Sheikh ot Bahrein to be allowed to call in the assistance of the feneikh of Debai against the Wahabis was equally refused in November 1846. la August 1847 a Treaty of Peace was c uded between the Wahabi Amir and the ruling Sheikh, 4 OOOdTn ruling Sheikh agreed to pay a tribute of 4 000 dollars a year while the Wahabi Amir agreed not to encourage the ex-Sheikh. ■ ;X?

The ^ Court o directors concurred m the Government of Bombay's recommendation 44 that any attempts upon Bahrein ought to be resisted by the British Naval Force' and that the Kesident should be so informed. + iS 0 ? ^ ()ct p ber 1847 the Foreign Office, in a letter to the India Board, m which tbey referred to recent Turkish assurances that the Turkish Government had no intention of using compulsion with regard to Bahrein, added that u if + i. e T an Go y e ;' n 1 me nt has any further apprehensions on e subject, and if the Bahrein Chief is really an independent ruler, the best course would be to make with him a treatv of alliance which would ^ secure his independence and 'his friendly connection with England.' The Resident, who . eeD l ^ inexpedient that Her Majesty's Government should involve itself m the embarrassments likely to arise from a closer alliance with Bahrein (letter of 25th January 1848) was, however, opposed to making the existing connection closer, as were the Secret Committee of the East India Company, who expressed the view that the Resident 'had -exercised ^ wise discretion in not taking any step for the negotiation of a new treaty with Bahrein.' The Resident was, at the same time, authorised, while avoiding discussion with the Turks, to ascertain whether the Sheikh was inclined to enter into a closer connection with Her Majesty's Govern ment. Sheikh's Request to be taken under British Protection refused (1849). 56. In January 1849, however, the Sheikh spontaneously 2 - asked to be taken under British protection. The Resident!

Persian Protest, 1848. 57. During the course of these discussions, the Persian Government protested against British interference in the affairs of Bahrein, whereupon they were informed by the Minister at Tehran in February 1848 that the British Government were unable to recognise as valid the claims advanced by Persia to the sovereignty of Bahrein. Designs of Muscat, 1849. 58. In June 1849 the Imam of Muscat, having intimated his desire to send an expedition to take possession of Bahrein, and having asked the opinion of Her Majesty's Government, was strongly dissuaded from doing so by Her Majesty's Government. Summary, 1840-50. 59. The ruling Sheikh was expelled in 1843 and con tinued to intrigue to regain the throne till his death in 1849, appealing for assistance during this period to the Wahabis, Persia, Muscat and Great Britain, in all cases unsuccessfully. In 184? Turkey asserted a claim to Bahrein. In the same year the islands submitted themselves to the Wahabi Amir and agreed to pay tribute to him. Claims by Persia were advanced, but rejected, in 1844- 45 and 1848. Muscat was dissuaded from attacking Bahrein in 1849. Her Majesty's Government, on consideration of the policy to be adopted in regard to Bahrein, decided against establishing a protectorate and refused a request put for ward in 1849 by the Sheikh to be taken under British protection. They assured him at the same time of their general goodwill, and their deliberations made it clear that they regarded the island as independent, but were reluctant to assume further responsibility in relation to it so long as its independence and the performance of the engagements undertaken by the Sheikh could be secured without their doing so. VII.—1850-61. Disputes with Wahabis, 1850-51. 60. In 1850 the Resident found it necessary to take disciplinary action against the ruling Sheikh—an individual of ''irresponsible character.' Consequent on strained relations between the Sheikh and the Wahabi Amir, the Amir, with whom the sons of the ex-Sheikh Abdulla were associated, in 1850-51 threatened Bahrein, whereupon the Sheikh against his own better judgment . . . tendered a small annual tribute to the Amir,' a circumstance from which it may perhaps be inferred that he had failed to observe the agreement of 1847 referred to in paragraph 50 above. The Amir rejected the offer and made exorbitant demands instead. I he Sheikh was about to succumb to a combination of the sons of the ex-Sheikh and the Wahabi Amir when a British squadron arriving off Bahrein took the islands under their protection.' Peace was subsequently made with the Wahabis in July 1851. Her Majesty's Government and the Claims of Turkey (1851). . s *J me y ear Her Majesty's Government decided that the Turkish Government should be informed at Con- stantmople that Her Majesty's Government, having heard la e leikh was desirous of placing himself under ur ash protection, could not acknowledge or acquiesce in seeing that the Government of British ia a ad lelations with Bahrein as an independentgood 8 ? tat o JJ uc J concluded with it certain treaties, namely, one India Bd. in loJO for the suppression of piracy and one in 1847 for to F - 0 -' the prohibition of the exportation of slaves, and that Her P' 1 ? 5 ^ Majesty's Government must object to any arrangement which t ' 0 . eiSl 2H would transfer Bahrein to the dominion or protectorship of S. Canning, ^ tie ^ any other Power. Constanti- t ^-n ^ ie corres P on( ^ erice leading up to this decision 12 21851 m -Lord t almerston remarked : ' I come to the conclusion that ^ Js the opinion of the East India Company that the object irst to be aimed at is to prevent Bahrein from falling under the control of any foreign Power, and to keep that island in Its present condition of political independence. But I infer from what has been stated in the despatches which you ^ liave communicated to me, that if that independence could no longer be maintained, and if the ruler and the people of Bahrein were determined to place themselves under some oieign protection, the Last India Company would think that less evil would arise from affording to Bahrein British w. protection than from allowing French, Persian or Turkish ^ authority to be established in that island.' is, Attitude of the Wahabls and of Muscat, 1852-53. .• 63. In 1852 the Sheikh proposed to withhold his tribute Lor. 1,885. ™ ±rom the Wahabi Amir, but on the advice of the Resident i decided to pay it. In the same year the Consul at Zanzibar was instructed to inform the Imam of Muscat that Her Majesty s Government saw no reason to alter the views regarding the possession of Bahrein communicated to His Highness in 1849 (paragraph 58 above). In May 1853 the Government of India authorised the Government of Bombay to otter every obstacle to an attack on Bahrein by the Wahabi Lor. 1,887. Amir (who was now nominally subject to the Turkish Government) on the ground that Her Majesty's Government would not permit the occupation of Bahrein by the Turkish Government or by anyone acting for them or in their interest. Principle of Non-interference in Internal Affairs laid down by Bombay Government (1854). . 6 1 4 - 0n 20t ^ November 1854 the Government of Bombav m a letter to the Resident laid down the principle of non- mter ei en c e m the internal affairs of Bahrein, and authorised simultaneously to inform the Sheikh of Oatif on the Aiab mainland that the British Government would not tolerate his further interference with the affairs of iiahrem.

Its contents were No. ix 234 identical with that of corresponding engagements entered mto at the same time by the Arab rulers of the Trucial Coast. DD. I ne bneikh s internal government continued to so from bad to worse. In September 1858 reparation was secured from him for the ill-treatment of British subjects in i din em. In 18o9 a Wahabi attack was averted by British intervention. The local Wahabi Governor sued for pardon Lor. 1, 887. to the bemor Naval Officer; the Wahabi ruler, however made a formal protest, asserted his authority over Bahrein! and declared that he was himself a vassal of the Sultan of Turkey. The Resident, in reply, informed him of the determination of Her Majesty's Government to preserve the independence of Bahrein, and pointed out the inconsistencv ol his ^ piratical attacks on Turkish shipping with his piofessions of dependence on the Ottoman Government. Sheikh's Appeal to Persia and Turkey, 1859-61. 67. At the end of 1859 or early in 1860, as the result, Lor.

Resdt. to Constant. 3.6.1860. 18 partly of irritation at the restraint exercised by the Resident over his piratical activities directed against the Wahabis, the Sheikh made a siinnltaneons appeal for assistance to the Persian Governor of Fars and the Turkish Wali of Baghdad. The Turkish answer was delayed. A Persian agent (Mirza Mehdi Khan), bearing a Persian Firman to the Sheikh, arrived in April 1860. The Persian flag was hoisted, Persian sovereignty proclaimed, and the Sheikh's agreement to pay tribute secured. These ceremonies were, however, scarcely over when a Turkish emissary arrived. The Persian flag continued to fly during the Sheikh's negotiations with the Turks, but on the latter withdrawing, and subsequently communicating assurances of a character satisfactory to the Sheikh from the Turkish Government, the Tuikish flag was hoisted on the forts in place of the Persian flag in May 1860 and the Sheikh agreed to pay tribute to Turkey. The Persian emissary, however, refused to leave Bahrein ' or surrender his imaginary authority in the Sheikhdom.' The Resident reported in July 1860 that ' the Ottoman flag has now become the national one.' The Sheikh appears to have endeavoured to play off each party against the other. Views of the Minister at Tehran and the Government of Bombay. 68. The Minister at Tehran regarded the matter as one of relatively small importance. He pointed out to the Persian Government ' that under no circumstances can the British Government be expected to concur in the proposed transfer of the sovereignty of Bahrein to the Persian Crown, since we have contracted engagements with the Arab Sheikhs of the island as independent Chiefs, and since the mainten ance of their independence is indispensable to the successful working of those plans of maritime police in the Persian Gulf which we have been at so much pains and expense to establish ' ; and obtained an assurance from Persia that no military occupation of Bahrein should be attempted until the title to the island had been settled through the diplomatic channel. He advised the Resident that, while hostilities against Bahrein were to be repelled by force, a voluntary tender of allegiance by the Sheikh to any other Power might, so long as it was unaccompanied by any military occupation, be ignored as of no particular importance. In the light of the Minister's views the Government of Bombay instructed the Resident that he should not interfere with the occupation of Bahrein, whether by Persia or Turkey, save by protest and by an intimation that the matter had been referred to Her Majesty's Government; but at the same time that the agents of both Powers (Turkey and Persia) should be warned that aggression by or in the name of Bahrein on neighbour ing tribes would not be allowed and would, if necessary, be prevented by force. In representing the matter to the Secretary of State for India they urged that in the interests of the peace of the Gulf it would be better that Bahrein should be regarded as independent and as subject neither to 1 urkey nor to Persia, that its independence should be recognised, and the engagements into which in the interests of humanity we had entered with its rulers for the preserva tion of the peace and good order of the Gulf should be maintained. Her Majesty s Government decide that Bahrein shall be regarded as independent (1861). ^ t .^ n February 1861 Her Majesty's Government, after F o to I o dlscussl0 l n between the India Office and the Foreign Office, i2 2.61 ' app r ° v ed the recommendation of the Government of S.

On the 27th February 1861 the Political Resident reported that the Persian and Turkish flags still fly on the forts of the island and in an interview that Com mander Cruttenden had with Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah at his own request he (the Chief) remarked in respect to them that they were displayed 'merely to suit his own fancy. What did he care for Turk or Persian ? He valued the friendship of the British Government highlv.' ' British Convention of 31st May 1861 with the Sheikh. /O. In May 1861 the Sheikh, refusing to discontinue a blockade which he had imposed on the Wahabi coast, was informed by the Resident of the decision of Her Pol.-Res. Majesty's Government that he was regarded as an indepen- to Sheikh, dent Chief and that in these circumstances he must be held responsible by them for any piratical activities in which he might indulge. Ibe Sheikh proved obdurate; he was threatened with forcible measures by the Resident and two of his ships were seized. He accordingly submitted, and on 31st May 1861 he signed a Friendly Convention with the Resident, acting on behalf of Her Majesty's Government, by which he entered into a 'perpetual treaty of peace and friendship ' with Great Britain, and in which, as ' indepen dent ruler of Bahrein,' he acknowledged as valid and in force the earlier conventions entered into between Bahrein and Her Majesty's Government, and undertook in return for^ a guarantee of protection against aggressions ' by the Chiefs and I ribes of the Gulf ' to abstain from maritime aggiession, piracy, the slave trade, &amp;c,, and to agree to Aitchison, certain conditions in regard to residence and trade in Vol. XI, ' Bahrein by British subjects and to jurisdiction over them. No - x ' 234 - One of the ships seized from him was thereupon returned; the second, the Hamrah, was retained. 71. The Puikish and Persian agents would seem to have Pol Res to disappeared from Bahrein before the Resident's arrival. The Teh., No'. 20, Persian authorities at Bushire in June 1861 asked the 8.6.1861. Resident for an explanation of his proceedings. The Resident, however, contented himself with forwarding their enquiry to Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran. The Convention was approved by the Government of India in 1861, and the Turkish and Persian Governments were informed of what had happened. Summary, 1850-61. 72. The Turkish Government were informed in 1851 that Her Majesty's Government could not recognise any claim on their part to Bahrein. The Sheikhs appear to have continued to pay tribute to the Wahabi Amir in the early part of and possibly through out this period. In 1859 the Sheikh appealed simultaneously to Turkey and to Persia, as the result of apprehensions of a Wahabi attack, and received a Persian envoy, who hoisted the Persian flag. On the arrival immediately afterwards of the Turkish envoy the Persian flag was hauled down. Sub sequently the Sheikh for a time flew both flags side b3 7 ' side. The envoys seem to have left Bahrein in the early part of 1861. No action was taken by the British authorities pending a decision by Her Majesty's Government as to whether they regarded Bahrein as independent. The Persian Government undertook not to endeavour to occupy the islands until the title to them was settled. Her Majesty's Government decided in February 1861 to regard the Sheikh as an independent ruler and so hold him responsible for^ piracies, &amp;c. Punitive action against him by Her Majesty's Government having proved necessary in May 1861, he^ entered in that month into a convention with them in which he was described as ' independent ruler of Bahrein,' and secured certain guarantees of protection.' 20 VIII.—1861-67. From the Convention of 1861 to the Punitive Expedition of August 1868. Persian Protest (1862). 73. In January 1862 the Persian Minister Lord Cowley 73. In January 16^ tiie i 'ersian ^ Minister m Paris to F.O., protested to Her Majesty's Ambassador in Paris against the 7^7 1862 seizure of the Hamrah. He was informed in reply that Her F.O. to Lord Majesty's Government could not recognise^any claim on the Cowley, part of Persia to question their proceedings in regard to No. 209, Bahrein, and must therefore decline to offer him any 22.2.1862. explanation on the subject of his complaint. Persian Protest (1866). Lor. 1,891. 74. Between 1863 and 1865 the Sheikh continued to misbehave, and in the latter year his ship, the Dinar, was seized under the instructions of the Resident. The Persian Government in 1866 made a complaint in regard to the Dinar proceedings on the ground that Bahrein under the unratified agreement of 1822 was a dependency of Persia. The Government of India, after ascertaining from the Government of Bombay the nature of the agreement of 1822, Lor. 1,691. communicated the result of their enquiries to the Minister at Tehran, and added their own opinion that ' whatever might have been the pretensions of Persia or the grounds of the same to the sovereignty of Bahrein in former days, the Shah could not now be regarded as possessing in point of fact any rights in the principality.' This communication was approved by Her Majesty's Government in the same year, and the matter appears to have dropped. I.O. to G. of L, No. 37 of 28.2.1867. Lor. I, 892. Nature of Relations between Bahrein and Wahabi Amir (1867). 75. In 1866-67 the Resident, on the instructions of the Government of India, investigated the relations of the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Wahabi Amir. He reported as a result that the Sheikh claimed to be independent so far as his islands were concerned, and that the annual tribute of 4,000 dollars ' which he indubitably paid ' (cp. paragraph 50- above) to the Amir was on account of the possessions held by him in Qatar on the Arabian mainland, the object of the payment being to secure those possessions against attacks by Arab tribes under Wahabi influence. The Government of India,^ in the light of the Resident's investigation, expressed the view in March 186&lt; that the Sheikh was independent of all other Powers in respect of his insular possessions and owed fealty to the Wahabis only in regard to Qatar. Summary, 1861-67. 76. This period is marked by assertions of the Persian claim in 1862 and 1866. Her Majesty's Government on both occasions made it clear that they could not regard that claim as well founded. Investigation show r ed that the tribute still paid (1867) by the Sheikh to the Wahabi Amir was in respect of Bahreini possessions on the mainland of Arabia, and not in respect of Bahrein, which the Sheikh held independently of all other Powers. IX.—Discussions and Incidents, 1868-70. *7. Questions of considerable importance as bearing on the status of Bahrein arose in 1868—70 consequent on-— {a) the disciplinary action taken by the Government of India against the ruling Sheikh Md. bin Khalifa, -view of his breaches of the Maritime Truce of lo-O, which resulted in his flight from Bahrein — September J 868 and the succession as sole Sheikh of his brother, Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa; [b) the punitive action taken at Bahrein by the Govern ment of India in November—December 1869, consequent on the invasion of Bahrein by the ex-^heikh Md. bin Khalifa, the murder of Sheikh V :■* r-;er Je ^ lo w 21 Ali, and the attempt of Sheikh Md. bin Khalifa and Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah to establish themselves in control of the islands. 7b. Jn view of the weight attached by the Persians to the declarations made in the course of those discussions as indicating the view held by Her Majesty's Government on the status of Bahrein, of the Persian allegations that over tures to Persia had been made by the ruling Sheikh, Ali bin Khalifa, and by the ex-Sheikh, Md. bin Khalifa, and of the misleading bnt categorical accusations made against the Kesident by the Persian Government, it seems desirable to examine in some detail the correspondence which passed and the sequence of events. Punitive Expedition of August—September 1868. ? 9 - In 1868 '. consequent on an attack on Qatar by the bheikh of Bahrein, the Government of India resolved to take disciplinary action against Sheikh Mohamed bin Khalifa The Sheikh sent an agent to Bushire to satisfy the Resident' but the agent having no powers from his master, his mission proved fruitless, and he returned to Bahrein in August 1868. An armed expedition was thereupon sent against the Sheikh in August-September of that year. Before it reached Bushire Bahrein the Sheikh fled to the Arab mainland, and he was D esp. 3 of thereafter regarded by the people of Bahrein and by Her 25 - 9 - 1868 ' Majesty's Government as having abdicated the Sheikhdom, ihe expedition found it unnecessary to use any force, a full submissmn being made on its arrival by Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa, brother of Sheikh Mohamed, who had previously been associated with Sheikh Mohamed to some extent in the bheikhship. An agreement was reached by the Political Kesident with Sheikh Ali, which disposed of the matters in chspute, on Gth September 1868. The agreement was signed by Ah Jmi Khalifah and the inhabitants and subjects of Bahrein. It declared inter alia that ' Md. bin Khalifah having repeatedly committed acts of piracy and other irregularities at sea, and having now, after his recent Aitch. XI, pnatical acts, fled from Bahrein, has forfeited all claim to ^ 0 - his title as principal Sheikh and Chief of Bahrein.' 236 - 7 - 80. Subsequently to the conclusion of this agreement the Kesident, by way of punishment, destroyed the fort of Muharraq by gunfire and burnt certain vessels of war belonging to Sheikh Mohamed bin Khalifah. His despatch, Pol. Bes. to which contains a detailed report on the course of events ^ ov t. of makes no reference to any flying of the Persian flag bv ?T 0ni o a7 ' Mohamed bm Khalifah, and the bombardment of Muharraq « 0 Q^fi R and the punitive destruction of the warships took place after the submission of Bahrein, and so after Mohamed biu Kh alii ah had fled from the islands. Persian Protest, November 1868. 81. The facts appear to be as stated in the precedino- paragraph. It was some time before a full account of these proceedings reached either India or London. Meanwhile, as will be seen from the correspondence, extracts of which Teh. Desp. aie quotea below, the action of the Government of India G'. of L, drew a vigorous protest from the Persian Government The 28 - 10 - 1868 ' protest, after appealing to the treaties concluded between Teh. Desp. England and Persia in 1809, in 1814, in 1822 (unratified) 149 and in J8.&gt;/, uiged that the Resident, instead of respectino - ^ 1l.l.SGS. the rights of I ersia in the Gulf to the extent provided for m those treaties, had, without any prior intimation to the i ei siau authoi ities, attacked Bahrein, which island had been and still was the property of Persia ; had bombarded and destroyed the Governor's fort and house and caused considerable damage ; had appointed the Sheikh's brother 2953 FF.O. to 1.0. 1.2.1869. From Gen. Mohsin Khan, 11.2.1869. To Gen. Molisin Khan, 5.3.1869. Gen. Mohsin Khan to Duke of Are y 11, 13.4.1869. 1.0. 21.4. to F.O, 1869. as Governor over the island on the flight, through fear, of the Sheikh ; had imposed a fine ; and had required the new Sheikh to find his brother and deliver him up to the British authorities. These proceedings had taken place at a time when 'Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah, the Governor of Bahrein, was openly avowing his submission to and dependence upon Persia and declaring that he considered Bahrein to be indisputably Persian, in proof of which the Persian flag was flying over his fort,' 82. Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran was instructed to communicate a suitable explanatory statement to the Persian Government. The Foreign Office suggested, how ever, that it might be advisable, in the event of similar proceedings again becoming necessary, that communication should be had with that Government. While this question was still under consideration a formal protest against the Resident's action was received (11th February 1869) from the Persian Charge d'Affaires in London, who complained, inter alia, that the Resident had sunk three ships belonging to the Governor of Bahrein and fired on his palace on which the Persian flag flew, and requested that the British Govern ment would give orders for the repair of the damage caused. He was informed in reply that the Sheikh of Bahrein was an independent chief with whom the British Government had treaty engagements and whom they must hold strictly to the performance of those engagements.' 83. This contention the Persian representative disputed and in support of his view he forwarded letters addressed ' from 1858 to 1869 by the Sheikh of Bahrein to His Imperial Majesty the Shah and the Prince Governor of Shiraz.' The translations of these letters are dated 9th April and 12th April 1869 respectively. From internal evidence it seems probable that they were, however, written in 1860 on the occasion of the visit to Bahrein of the Persian envoy, Mirza Mehdi Khan (paragraph 67 above). They acknowledge the receipt of a Firman from the Mirza (apparently recognising Sheikh Md. as Sheikh and accompanying a Firman and a Sword of Honour for Sheikh Ali). They state emphatically that Bahrein forms part of Persia, and has always done so. They refer to an agreement reached for the future payment of tribute; remark that the slight neglect which was lately shown on our part towards Your Imperial Majesty's Government was because they had not for a while superin tended and protected us, but as now the Government of Your Imperial Majesty has intended by sending over Mirza Mehdy to enquire into and manage the affairs here, I, with my brother and all the inhabitants, feel quite ready to declare at once that we are most willing to render any services required from us towards Your Majesty's Government, being already aware that Bahrein (Persian Gulf) is part of Persia,' and add '... I will hasten to hoist the flag on my residence bearing the Lion and the Sun which are the signs of the Persian Standard.' British Note of 29th April 1869. 84. The question of the reply to be given to this further protest was carefully considered between the India Office and the Foreign Office. The Duke of Argyll, then Secretary ' of State for India, remarked that although he was of opinion that the line of policy which had hitherto been pursued of regarding the Sheikh of Bahrein as an independent sovereign, and of refusing to recognise the right of sovereignty advanced by Persia, as had been done in 1845, 1848 and ISbO, could not now be abandoned without very serious risk of endangering the peace of the Gulf, yet that ' he was not blind to the expediency of avoiding all causes of unnecessary irritation at the Court of Tehran and that23 lie was willing, therefore, should Lord Clarendon desire it, as a matter of courtesy to the Persian Government, to issue instructions to the Government of India to direct the ^sident in the Persian Gulf (whenever he might on any suture occasion, under orders from India, be about to call the C hief of Bahrein to account for any breach of his engage ments with the British Government) to notify the fact to the British Minister at Tehran for the information of the Shah's Government. Circumstances might, however, arise in which the Resident might, in the general interests of peace and order be called upon to act promptly on his own responsibility, and in such cases the Secretary of State was not willing to waive what he considered ' as not onlv a right m r pertaining to but a duty incumbent upon, the' British Motsin Government.;' The Foreign Office concurred in these views Khan, and the Persian representative was informed accordingly. 29.4.1869. The p ersian representative on receipt of the Foreign F.O. tol .0., Uttice letter asked that m order to make it more palatable 11.5.1869. to the Shah, certain modifications should be made in it. * a to F - 0 ' After private discussion between Lord Clarendon and the Luke of Argyll, of which no record exists, and an interview between the Envoy and Lord Clarendon, it was finally agreed to accept the modification embodied in the opening para graph of the letter which follows, but also to make the addition contained in the last paragraph of that letter • and a letter so amended was despatched to him. The text (omitting an introductory paragraph) of the amended letter, w ich is of importance as one of the principal pieces of evidence subsequently adduced by the Persian Government m support of their claim that Her Majesty's Government have recognised Persian sovereignty over Bahrein, is as a a T ' ■ T1 w sentences ^ Dalies are those which were added m deference to the further representations from General Mohsm Khan referred to above : — ' The British Government readily admit that the Government of the Shah has protested against the Persian right of sovereignty over Bahrein being ignored by the British Authorities, and they have given due consideration to that protest. But it is the fact, as yourself and the Government of the Shah are un- doubtecHy aware, that the Sheikhs of Bahrein have a '[ ! e i ren 4 ? e . ri 1 od ® entered directly into engagements X r.i n • r - tl 1 r. 0rninent; and 1 be g t0 ass ' re you that the British Government hold the Sheikh to these engagements solely for the purposes of preventing p ir + ? cy S1 2J e 1 Tracie » an d of maintaining the police 0 tJle ^'ll- I± the Persian Government are prepared to keep a sufficient force in the Gulf for these purposes this country would be relieved of a troublesome and cost 3 duty; but, if the Shah is not prepared to undertake these duties, Her Majesty's Government cannot suppose His Majesty would wish that in those waters disorder and crimes should be encouraged bv impunity. J ' I need scarcely assure you of the friendly feelings entertained by Her Majesty's Government towards 1 ersia, and their desire on all occasions to meet as far as possible the wishes of the Shah; and, in regard to this question, I have the honour to state to you that whenever it is practicable to do so, Her Majesty's Government will cause the Persian Government to be informed beforehand of any measures of coercion agamst himself which the conduct of the Sheikh of Baliiein may have rendered necessary.

Overthrow and Death of Sheikh Ali {August—September 1869). 86. lu August—September 1809 Uahrein was icvaded by the ex-Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifah, who was joined by one Mohammed bin Abdullah, son of the Sheikh who had been deposed in 1843 (paragraph 39 above). The ruling Sheikh Ali was defeated and killed, while Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdullah assumed the leadership of the usurping party. 87. Her Majesty's Minister reported on 14th November 1869 a conversation on this incident with the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs in the course of which the latter admitted that Persia had not acquired sufficient power or authority in that part of the Gulf to enable her to repress acts of piracy and to maintain order, but added that he hoped that before long the Shah's authority would be fully established at Bahrein, when full redress would be given for losses suffered through the recent events, and that in the meanwhile it would not be considered necessary that the British authorities should undertake coercive measures. Her Majesty's Minister further reported that ' Ali bin Khalifa having forwarded letters to this Court admitting his allegiance to the Shah and offering his services to the Persian Government,' an agent (Mirza Mehdi Khan, who had been Persian Envoy to Bahrein in 1859 (para graph 67 above)) had been despatched with a Royal Firman,, recognising Sheikh Ali bin Khalifah as Chief of Bahrein, but that on receipt of the news of the murder of the Sheikh by the ex-Sheikh Mahomed bin Khalifah, the Firman had been recalled and the name of the ex-Sheikh substituted (from paragraphs 94-5 below it will be seen that these statements subsequently proved to be incorrect in material particulars)^ British Punitive Expedition (November—December 1869). 88. Punitive operatioos consequent on the murder of Sheikh Ali were undertaken by the British Government in November of the same year. Previous notification was given to the Persian Government of the grounds of this expedition, the object of which was stated to be ' to call the chief now in possession of Bahrein to account for his breach of the maritime peace and for the attack on Sheikh Ali bin Khalifah, who had been placed in power by the British Government.' 89. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs on receipt of the notification in question stated that the ex-Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifah, who had, he said, been the cause of the recent disturbances, had been killed (this was in fact incorrect); that the Resident's action w^ould therefore be- useless, and that the Persian Government hoped that he w r ould be telegraphically instructed not to proceed to Bahrein. He added that the Persian Government would themselves keep the affairs of Bahrein by land in order and that should anything happen to affect its affairs by sea they would request the British Government to send a naval force to put affairs in oider, but up till now the state of affairs in Bahrein had not fallen into disorder.' 90. The Persian agent referred to in paragraph 87 above arriving in the Gulf at this stage addressed letters to Sheikh?/«, ■ W1 ? 5 25 Mohammed bin Abdullah (see paragraph 86 above) intimating his recognition as Sheikh, and despatched them by a special messenger, who proceeded to the island in a native boat belonging to a Persian. The messenger was, however, on his arrival prevented by the Resident from landing or communicating with the Sheikh, and his letters were Bushire ' detained and ultimately handed by the Resident to Sheikh Desp. 216 of Mohammed bin Abdullah after the submission of that 1^.12.1869. Sheikh, who returned them to Colonel Felly after perusal. 1 he messenger stated that he had himself no authority from the Shah's Government and was deputed by the Chief of Bayer, who was acting in obedience to Mirza Mehdi Khan. Submission of Usurping Sheikhs. Sheikh Isa bin Ali becomes Sheikh. 91. The punitive operations against Bahrein resulted in the complete submission of Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah and p ( ,i. Res. to the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah in September 1869. It may Govt, of be remarked that prior to the opening of operations Sheikh Bombay, Abdullah made overtures to the Resident, which were, how- liqfqpn ever, rejected, with a view to securing recognition by His 181 of Majesty's Government. He also appealed to the Wahabi 25.9.1869, Amir for recognition and protection. Sheikh Isa bin Ali, 184 son of the murdered Sheikh Ali, voluntarily assumed the 5 - 101869 - vacant Cbiefship and was recognised by the Resident on behalf of the Government of India ('in no way did Colonel Pellv influence the succession') and the ex-Sheikh and Mohammed bin Abdullah were deported to India. Shortly Teh. Desp. after his installation the new 7 Sheikh received a letter from ■^ 0 ' 94 of one Hydar Khan, Zabit of the Bashti district on the Persian coast, advising him to place himself under the Shah 's ^ Des P- piotection, but the incident appears to have been unim- 1870 portant. Persian Protest, 1869-70. \ lews of Government of India. 92. Ihe Persian Minister for foreign Affairs appears at hrst to have received news of the removal of the ex-Sheikh W1 *k equanimity and is said to have remarked that Persia and Great Britain had an equal interest in the maintenance of peace by sea and that Persia had therefore no reason to object ^ to the punishment of the delinquent. But he protested in strong terms against the Resident's action in preventing the Persian agent from landing and holding communication with the Sheikh, and a still stronger protest was made by the Persian Minister in London. The Govern ment oi India, in the exhaustive reports they submitted on the Resident's action, urged, after a review of the history of the islands, that the Shah had no legitimate control over the Sheikh of Bahrein ; that his Government had nevertheless encouraged the piratical faction in the Persian Gulf by sending letters of recognition to the piratical leader; that in styling Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah Chief of Bahrein the Persian Government ignored the facts that he had never held sway in Bahrein, belonged to the younger bianch of the ruling family, and so had neither by right nor possession claim to this title; and that, so far from the Shah having any just cause of complaint against the Resident, the Persian Government should be called upon to give some explanation of the conduct of its officers in encouiaging a piratical expedition which was prejudicial to British mteiests in the Persian Gulf and for the successive appointment by them of Ali bin Khalifa and Md. bin Khalifa to the sovereignty of a district over which they had no legitimate control. The Government of India added that a v 'i -d I . 10 c 9 n fi rm ation of the alleged overtures of Sheikh Ah bin Khalifa to Persia (paragraph 87 above), as to which fuither enquiry was being made of Her Majesty's Minister 295 ^f To Teh., No. 22, 30.3.1870. 26 (see paragraphs 94-95 below), but in any event could not admit ' that such overtures, made without its knowledge and consent, can in any way affect its treaty relations with Bahrein.' British Reply to Persia, March 1870. 93. Her Majesty's Minister was therefore instructed by the Foreign Office that it appeared possible that Her Majesty's Government, instead of furnishing explanations to Persia, might have cause to complain ' of the proceedings of the Persian authorities in endeavouring to communicate with a piratical chief who had been guilty of a breach of the Mari time Truce, and who had attacked the Chief placed in power at Bahrein by the British Government,' and was informed that no notice would be taken of the complaints against the Resident until the Persian Government gave a full explana tion of the intercepted letters. Supplementary Reports hy Her Majesty's Minister i Tehran, April 1870. 94. On 6th April 1870 the Minister at Tehran reported as follows to the Government of India : — ' In my Despatch No. 81 ... I reported that the Firman of appointment was originally in the name of Ali bin Khalifa, but that, on hearing of his death, it was altered in favour of his brother, Md. bin Khalifa. This information had reached me from a relation of . . . one of the principal Persian officials in Shiraz, and not . . . from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. When further intelligence reached Shiraz from the Gulf and it was supposed that Md. bin Abdullah would retain possession of Bahrein, the Firman was probably again altered in his favour, as it was to him that it was eventually forwarded. In conversation with the Persian Minister this afternoon His Excellency admitted that this was probably the case. He said that Mirza Mehdi Khan on leaving Tehran had received general instructions for his guidance respecting the Bahrein question, but that the details were settled at Shiraz and the Firman was issued in the name of the Persian Governor of Fars and not in that of the Shah. The name inserted in this document had certainly, he said, been altered once to his knowledge, and it was not unlikely that it had been changed a second time before being forwarded to its destination. ' With regard to the overtures said to have been made by Ali bin Khalifa to the Persian Government, as reported in my Despatch No. 81, I have the honour to state that that information also reached me from a private source and not from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. His Excellency has, however, asserted very positively to me to-day that Ali bin Khalifa had repeatedly written to the Persian Government professing allegiance to the Shah and that a number of letters containing assurances of this kind are now in his (the Minister's) possession. ' It appears to me that on the receipt of a correspon dence which passed last April between Her Majesty's Government and the Shah's representative in London, the Persian Ministers, believing that the Bahrein Chief was himself well disposed to further their designs, resolved to take measures with a view to establishing, if possible, the Shah's authority in that quarter and make good his claim to exercise sovereign rights over Bahrein. Mirza Mehdi Khan was accordingly dispatched to bhiraz and Bushire and a certain latitude was given to him as to the mode in which he should proceed to carry out the wishes of his Government. The Persian authorities in Shiraz finally determined that a Firman should be addressed to Md. bin Abdullah, conferring f VupQn him the government of Bahrein and with this . ^^ lan toped to be able to come to terms with the Chief then in possession of the place. But in this matter the sole object of all concerned would seem to have been to carry out the policy of the Persian Govern ment at Bahrein without reference to the interests or wishes of Her Majesty's Government in that quarter.' ^ 1S70 the Minister at Tehran addressed the following despatch to the Government of India : — . ' With reference to my despatch of the 6th instant, m which I stated that the Minister for .Foreign Affairs had informed me that Mi bin Khalifa had lepeatedly made overtures to Persia admitting his allegiance to the Shah, I have the honour to report to Your Excellency that Mirza Sayed Khan has just sent to inform me that he was mistaken in making this assertion, and that he finds on enquiry that the letters to which he referred were not from that Chief, but from Md. bin Khalifa.' Views of Government of India, May 1870. 96. The Government of India, commenting on these facts, remarked that Mehdi Khan appeared to have left Tehran with a general discretion as to which of the various Sheikhs should be recognised as ruler. 'At the capital no more definite plan appears to have been resolved on than that measures should be adopted to establish the Sheikh's assumed right of sovereignty over the island.' 97. The Government of India proceeded that they had already pointed out that any disposition to admit the claims of Persia would probably lead to the revival of similar claims on the paitof lurkey, a result which had in fact now been brought about (cp. paragraph 99 below). ' This (i.e. the Turkish) claim rests on no better foundation than that of Persia. It was summarily rejected by Lord Palmerston m^. 1851 and m oui opinion should not again be reopened. With equal reason the Wahabi Amir and the Sultan of Muscat could claim the sovereignty of the island, if the nominal and temporary tender of allegiance, in times of difficulty, and as a security against foreign intervention, be considered sufficient ground on which to base such preten sions. On the same ground indeed we might claim Bahrein as a part of the British dominions. But, as we have repeatedly observed, the real status of the island, and the only one which we have recognised and admitted, or are prepared to recognise and admit, in all our dealings in the Persian Gulf and our negotiations with the Chiefs, is that of an independent State, subject neither to Persia nor to Turkey, neither to the Wahabis nor to Muscat, nor vet to E)esp the British Government.' of20 - Review of Discussions of 1868-70. 98. The matter ultimately lapsed. But from the facts and the correspondence summarised above it will he seen, in the first place, that there appears to be no foundation for the alleged overtures to Persia by the ruling Sheikh, Ali bin Khalifa, or for the statement that the Persian flag was flying at the time of the punitive expedition of 1868 ; and that if any overtures were made to Persia in 1868-69 (and there is no confirmatory evidence of any such overtures) they would appear to have been made by the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Khalifa, presumably in his anxiety to secure Persian support for his restoration. Secondly, while the statements contained in the Note sent by the Foreign Office on behalf of Her Majesty's Government to the Persian Charge d'Affaires on 29th Apnl 1869 were widely phrased, and afford some justification for the interpretation placed on them by Persia, and while the Persians may have been confirmed in their view by the absence of any protest by Her Majesty's Minister against the mission of Mirza Mehdi Khan, the terms of that Note do not, in fact, constitute more than a recognition that28 Persia had in the past repeated]}' pressed her claim to Bahrein, and that Her Majesty's Government did not claim sovereignty over that island and interested themselves in its affairs only to the extent necessary to discharge their treaty obligations to its rulers (which included a guarantee of defence against external aggression) and to ensure the peace of the Gulf. Finally, that while Her Majesty's Government agreed to notify Persia, when circumstances permitted, before taking punitive action against Bahrein, on the only occasion on which (immediately after) they appear to have given effect to this undertaking, the terms of their communication made it clear that they regarded themselves as at liberty to punish the usurping Sheikhs Md. bin Abdullah and Md. bin Khalifa (in accordance with the obligations assumed by them under the Treaties of 1820 and 1861 with Bahrein) for their piratical attack on Bahrein and murder of the Chief placed in power there by the British Government. X.—1870-80. From the Turkish Occupation of Hasa to the First Exclusive Agreement. Turkish Protest, 1870. 99. In January 1870 a protest was received from the Turkish Government against the recent actions of the Resident at Bahrein. In reply the Turkish Government were informed that Her Majesty's Government could not recognise the Turkish claim to sovereignty over Bahrein; and were courteously reminded of the intimation made to them in 1851 on Lord Palmerston's instructions (para graph 61 above). Turkish Occupation of Hasa. British Assurances to Bahrein, 1871. 100. In 1871 the Turks occupied Hasa. Protests at Constantinople in April and May 1871 against rumoured Turkish designs on Bahrein resulted in a repudiation by Turkey oi any such designs. The assurances received from the Turkish Government were communicated to the Sheikh of Bahrein, who had asked Her Majesty's Government for their advice and their protection against the Turks in May 1871, and he was informed that so long as he observed the provisions of the Convention of 1861 (paragraph 70 above) the reciprocal obligations towards him of Great Britain would be fulfilled. Ipl • Protests about the same time at Constantinople led to a lurkish repudiation of the designs which the Turkish Government were alleged to have entertained at Bahrein, and the 1 urkish authorities in Hasa were given instructions by their Government which debarred them from approaching Bahrein. In May 1871 the Shah enquired from Her Majesty s Representative at Tehran as to the probable effect on Bahrein of the lurkish occupation of Hasa and was informed in reply of the assurances which had been given to Her Majesty's Government by the Turks. Reply to Persian Legation at Constantinople as to meaning of British Note of April 1869. 102. In November 1871 the Secretary of the Persian Legation at Constantinople made enquiries of Her Majesty's Ambassador in connection with a rumour that a Turkish expedition was to be sent for the reduction of Bahrein, i i ^ ^ Persian Secretary stated had been +1° V c § ef by the British Government as a portion of tne l ersian dominions and ... in proof of this assertion f t0 i, r IL Eniott a C0 P- V of tlle note Wtl, 4 -Mvcn c!' es r ed t0 General Haji Mobsin Khan on 28th April 1869. Sir H. Elliott, however, observed that he29 saw in that note nothing more than an acknowledgment that the claim had previously been made, but that he was unwilling to discuss the point, as he believed there was do danger of any attempt being made to interfere with the position of.Bahrein as it then stood.' Turkish Claims, 1871-79. . Consequent on the murder of a Turkish messenger ' in Bahiein in August or September 1871, the Turkish (jrovernment demanded reparation direct from the Sheikh and leceived a conciliatory reply. On their demand being piessed the Sheikh, on the advice of the Resident, suggested that the matter be arranged between the British and the iurlush (governments, by whose joint decision he would abide, but the Turkish Government preferred that it should be settled direct by the parties by agents. Her Majesty's Government saw no objection to such a procedure so lon^ as no compulsion or show of force by Turkev was involved. llirks ' however, let the matter drop. The incident is oi some interest as illustrating the view taken bv Her Majesty's Government of the Sheikh as an independent ruler who might deal direct with foreign Powers. 104 In August 1872, a further complaint having been received from Turkey of British proceedings in regard to , rem and the commission of 'acts of sovereignty' on F.O. to the part of the English, the Ambassador was informed in Turkish reply that enquiries would be made into the point raised bv Ambassa dor him and that his Government might rest assured that it was ^ 8 '\ S ^ Q n not the intention of Her Majesty's Government to interfere ' m the afiairs of the Persian Gulf beyond what was imposed J* 0- to F - 0 '' upon them by treaty for the preservation of peace in the ^ 0 ' 7 - 1872 - The Ambassador was finally informed in April lo/3, after investigation, that there were no grounds what ever for the statement that the British Government had attempted to exercise acts of sovereignty over Bahrein. 105. In 1874, consequent on a Turkish claim to conscript Bahremis resident m Basra, the Turkish Ambassador in London was referred to the British Notes of J 851 and 1870 (paragraphs 61 and 99 above), which stated that Her Majesty s Government did not admit the claims of Turkev to consider Bahrein as part of the Ottoman dominions In the same year, on a piratical attack being made on the island Y. certain l ahreini exiles who had signed a petition claiming lurkish protection, the Ambassador at Constan tinople handed a memorandum to the Porte in which it was stated that Her Majesty's Government could not recognise any rights or pretensions of the Porte over Bahrein? In J 0 a rum 9u r that Her Majesty's Government were forti- lymg bahrem led to representations from Turkey The Lor I 914 rumour was unfounded and the Turks were so informed. On its becoming known about the same time that the Turks Lor.

In 1876 consequent on steps taken bv the Turkish authorities to enforce the claims of Qatar merchants against Bahremis a Note was addressed to the Porte reminding them of the determination of Her Majesty's Government to protect Bahrein against any attack on its independence. 107. In 1879-80 the Turkish Government took up the canse of the rebels of 1809. Her Majesty's Government, after again disclaiming the exercise of sovereignty over Lor I 915 Bahrein which thgy regarded, they said, as independent ' ' promised to make enquiries as to certain acts of which com- p amt was made by petitioners to the Turkish Government. 2953 H30 First Exclusive Agreement between Her Majesty's Government and the Sheikh of Bahrein (1880). 108. In 1880 the Political Resident, finding that the Sheikh was disposed to conclude a special arrangement with the British Government, entered on the 22nd December into what is known as the First Exclusive Agreement with him. Aitchison, By this Agreement the Sheikh undertook on behalf of Vol. XI, himself and his ' successors in the Government of Bahrein Na xxn, ^ ^ British Government to abstain from entering into negotiations or making treaties of any sort with any State or Government other than the British without the consent of the said British Government, and to refuse permission to any other Government than the British to establish diplomatic or consular agencies or coaling depots in our territory, unless with the consent of the British Government. This engagement does not apply to or affect the customary friendly correspondence with the local authorities of neighbouring States on business of mioor importance.' The agreement was approved by Her Majesty's Government and ratified in 1881. Summary, 1870-80. 109. The claims of the Wahabi Amir disappear with the subjugation of Hasa by the Turks in 1871. The Turkish claim was repeatedly pressed during this period and was consistently rejected by Her Majesty's Government. The Persian claim appears to have been dormant. Her Majesty's Government repudiate suggestions that they have committed ' acts of sovereignty ' and continue to express their view that the Sheikh is an independent ruler. In 1880 the Sheikh entered into his first exclusive agreement with Her Majesty's Government. XI.—1880-92. From the conclusion of the First to the conclusion of the Second Exclusive Agreement with Her Majesty's Government. Persian Demarche, 1886. 110. In September 1886 the Shah sent a verbal message to Her Majesty's Government through the Minister at Tehran or ' ' 1 ' that he considered the communication, made to him in April Teh. tel. 188, 1869 as tantamount to an admission of his rights in Bahrein 27.9.1886. ailc [ j ie was anx i ous establish his authority effectually F O to I O 0ver t ^ e ^ s ^ an( ^ s Gitlier by sending a Governor to Bahrein or 30.7.1886.

An answer 8.10.1886. was prepared by Her Majesty's Government to the effect that they did not concur in His Majesty's interpretation of the communication of April 1869. They had treaty engage ments with the Sheikh, whom they considered to be indepen dent, and must hold the Sheikh to his engagements while fulfilling those they had contracted towards him. As, however, the Shah did not return to the subject, the message was not delivered. Lor. I, 911. m j n g arae year presents sent from the Persian Governor of Lar to the Sheikh were returned to the sender. 112. In 1887-88 Persian intrigues took place with a view to the establishment of Persian influence on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf. These were of little importance in the case of Bahrein, but it may be recorded that it appears that in the case of that principality the Persian Government had sanctioned a scheme for the seizure of Bahrein by Sheikh Lor. 1,920 Jasim of Dohah in Qatar, who had seemingly undertaken to put the Persians in possession of the Sheikhdom. Two British ships were in February 1888 stationed off Bahrein, ith instructions to prevent by force any hostile attempt to land by the Turks, Arabs or Persians, and the Minister at31 Tehran was asked by the Government of India so to inform the .Persian Government. As, however, the Amin-us-Sultan on bemg questioned disavowed all designs on Bahrein, Her ; a l (3s y 8 ^mister thought it better to avoid the reference to Jorcible action. Warning to Turkey, 1888. . ^ arc ^ 1 i^S8 the Turkish Government were informed that any attempt to effect a landing in Bahrein would be opposed by force, and that no claim by the Porte to jurisdiction over Bahrein could be admitted, since Her Majesty s Government regarded the Sheikh as an independent uler with whom they were in treaty relations. Second Exclusive Agreement between Her Majesty's Government and Bahrein (1892). • 'f- 0n the , 1 ^ h , ]V -! aroh , 1892 the Political Resident signed a second Exclusive Agreement with the Sheikh of Bahrein on behalf of Her Majesty's Government. The prov'sions of the Agreement (which was ratified on 12th P T • ?

' ' Will on no account cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give for occupation any part of mv territory, save to the British Government.' ^ Further Warning to Turkey, November 1892. 115. In November 1892 the Ottoman Government were n f warned (apropos of the position of Bahreinis at Basra) that C 348 of P ' was 'nder British protection, and that no interference 15.11,1892. with its natives by the Ottoman authorities could be admitted. In the same year the Porte was informed, with reference to a rumoured intention to land Turkish troops, that such action would be opposed by Her Majesty's ships.

The views of Her Majesty s Government on the status of the island were again ofiicially repeated at Constantinople on two occasions in 18J6. In 1897 the Constantinople Board of Health proposed to establish a sanitary post in Bahrein. The pioposal was abandoned on the objections of the British delegate, who represented that Bahrein was an independent principality under British protection. 118. In 1898 a Turkish request that a British Vice- Consul alleged to have been appointed at Bahrein shouldmlTV ' 1 ' 32 apply to the Turkish Government for his exequatur was Lor. I, 935. refused on the ground that Her Majesty's Government could not admit the right of the Turkish Government to insist that a British Consular Officer in Bahrein should be provided with a Turkish exequatur. In 1899 the Minister at Tehran informed the French representative at that capital that since 1880 the Sheikh was precluded by treaty from holding direct relations with any Power other than Her Majesty's Government and that his subjects abroad were now under British protection. 119. A native British Agent had for a long period of years been maintained in Bahrein. In 1900 a British Political Agent was appointed at Bahrein. The post has been maintained since that date, and has been filled by an officer of the Indian Political Department since 1904. Lor. I, 935- 6. Teh. Desp. No. 140 of 18.9.1901. &gt; . T he I ncident of 1901. 120. On 31st August 1901 a Belgian customs official in the service of the Persian Government visited Bahrein, where he called on the Sheikh and informed him that he had been deputed by the Shah to obtain his consent to place Persian custom officials in Bahrein. An official protest was at once made by His Majesty's Minister to the Persian Government, in the course of which Sir A. Hardinge remarked that no intimation had been given to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf u of this Persian mission to an Arab State under British protection and bound by special treaties, of which the Persian Government cannot be ignorant, to the Government of India .. . It is my duty to place on record in the clearest manner that His Majesty the Lmperor of India cannot acquiesce in any foreign interference in the affairs of Bahrein . . . and^ that any attempt to disturb the relations established by treaties of long standing between those Chiefs and the Government of India will be regarded as an unfriendly act.' The Attabeg- i-Azam, in a note received on the I7th September 1901, replied : ' As I have told you verbally, M. Simais has had no instructions from the Persian Government on this matter, and if there have been any steps on his part it must have been by mistake and he will be reprimanded for it.' T he D isorders of 1904-05. 121. In 1904-05, consequent on a series of attacks on Lor. I, 938— Persians and on German subjects in Bahrein, the Persians 42. appealed to ^the Shah. The Persian Government replied that His Majesty's Government would take action on their behalf. Ihe text of their telegram was as follows ; '* To the Merchants and traders of the High Government living in Bahrein. Your telegram on the subject of the assaults which have been made upon you by the Arab roughs of Bahrein has . been received. Certainly let your minds be at rest. Con sultations with the English Legation have taken place on this subject, and it will shortly be settled in such a way that the oppression will be removed and that the offenders will receive their proper punishment.' 122. The Germans complained to the German Vice- Consul at Bushire, who made a direct request to the Sheikh tor reparation in reply to which he was referred by His Excellency to His Majesty's Government. The Sheikh was ultimately compelled by His Majesty's Government to give redress. Lor. I, 944.

Un the Ambassador reverting to the subject later in 1905 he was informed (20th May ly05) that His Majesty's Government must decline to entertain any further represen tations from the Turkish Government on the subject. Reassertions of Persian Claim, 1905-13. n }uu tlle ^ sians again reas serted their claim. On the 19th February 1906, in reply to a further reiteration winch appears to have been based on the treaties of 1809, 1814 and 165/ the Minister at Tehran informed the Persian Government that 'The Treaties of 1809, of 1814 and of K w 0n J • 1S f 1 , 1 ^ We ^ways been scrupulously observed by His Majesty s Government, but have no bearing on the present question. His Majesty's Government have never admitted the ownership or sovereignty of Persia over Bahrein: Such a claim is m their view entirely inadmissible. His Majesty s Government consider the island of Bahrein and its inhabitants to be under British protection, and must decline to entertain any further representations on the subject. I am further to mention that this reply has mvana y een made to the Ottoman Government, who have on several occasions advanced a claim to Bahrein.' The JNote concluded by a reference to the Persian appeal for our assistance m 1904-05 and quoted in extemo the telegram of reassurance (paragraph 121 above) to the Persian inhabitants ol Bahrein then sent on behalf of the Persian Government. • 12 j' 2 a J i ; :th September 1906 the Persian Grand Vizier revived the Persian claim in a letter referring to Captain Bruce s unauthorised agreement of 1822. He was reminded bv Hi's Sst ^ p greeinent '^been expressly disavowed by His Majesty s Government and that Captain Bruce had been recalled. In a supplementary note the Grand Vizier's attention was drawn to the fact that the then Shah himself ISa? re * us ® d , t0 ,cognise ' the stipulations of the Treaty of 1822 which had never been ratified, and had 'expressed his displeasure that the Prince of Shiraz should 'have any f n / a g em .ents with the British Government without his knowledge or instructions.' m. 0n t ! le e^^^^eh reviving the Persian claim, on the ground of the Agreement of 1822, in August 1907 ns attention was drawn in a Note dated 13th August 1907 the fact 1 'tlfat referred to m the preceding paragraph ; and to the fact that the Agreement had been disavowed alike by His Majesty s Government and by the Shah. The Note added that ' since 1822 the Turkish Government hav® raised claims on Bahrein, and, like the Persian Govern ment, have been informed that Bahrein is under British protection. 12 r* Tn + i 1908 th ® f ersian Government, in a correspondence regarding the punishment of a Bahrein subject at Lingah intimated that instructions had been sent to Lingah thai reparation should be made, but added that His Majesty's mister would admit that 'the proprietary right of the ditZted° 0V Thr e N t t 0Ver the , islan 1 d is 11043 be f v a r aS r e ta med as inadmissible to the Ministry of foreign Affairs.

Early in 1910 the Persian Government assimilated the formalities to be fulfilled in the case of persons visiting- Bahrein to those prescribed in the case of travellers to Persian ports, a measure which, as pointed out by the Foreign Office at the time, constituted a fresh attempt to Teh. Desp. assert Persian sovereignty over the island, but it was agreed No. 95 of that in view of the undesirability of raising the general p 6 '3539/10, question, no protest should be made to them. In July of the same year it was reported that internal Persian coastal passes issued to persons proceeding to Bahrein from Persian ports were vise by a Persian merchant residing in Bahrein. In 1912 the individual in question was forbidden to take any action in regard to the endorsement of passes held by P.G. 13: 67, Persian subjects for travelling in Bahrein. The endorse ments in question were, however, henceforth granted by the Political Resident—a practice, as pointed out by the Political Resident nine years later, 'of itself open to objection, as it might be construed into a tacit admission that the Persian passport authorities are justified in giving passes for another Persian j)ort to persons going to Bahrein.' Withdrawal of Turkish Claim to Bahrein in Anglo-Turkish Convention of 29th July 1913. 129. On 29th July 1913 His Majesty's Government signed a convention (which still awaited ratification on the outbreak of the War of 1914-18) with the Ottoman Govern ment. under which that Government renounced all their claims to the islands of Bahrein, the independence of which they recognised. His Majesty's Government on their part declared that they had no intention of annexing the islands and undertook not to allow the Sheikh of Bahrein to disturb the autonomy of the peninsula of El Katr or to annex it, and to ensure that the Sheikh should not discriminate against Ottoman subjects in the matter of dues levied upon pearl fisheries. The Turkish Government on their side accepted a reservation of the right of the population of Bahrein to visit Zakhnuniyah Island for fishing, and recognised the rights of subjects of the Sheikh to British consular protection in Turkey. This arrangement, followed, as it was, by the disappearance of Turkey from the Gulf after the War of 1914-18, disposed of the Turkish claim to Bahrein, which had been reasserted ou numerous occasions and with great insistence since 1847. §24. Summary, 1892-1913. 130. The Turkish claim was repeatedly raised during the early part of this period, but consistently opposed by His Majesty's Government. It was finally abandoned in the (unratified) Anglo-Turkish Convention of July 1913. While that Convention was never ratified, the abandonment of the Turkish claim was confirmed by Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausaune of 1923. The Persian claim was also frequently pressed and was consistently repudiated in strong terms by His Majesty's Government. Xin.—1913-34. Exercise of Jurisdiction over Foreigners hy British Agent in Bahrein. i ^}' v ^ tue the Convention of 1861 (paragraph 70 §10, p. 63. D Vv. a o subsequent delegations by the Sheikhs, the Representative in Bahrein has for over 70 years I35 exercised important judicial powers in the islands. The -Sheikh m 1909-12 formally requested His Majesty's bovemmcnt to exercise jurisdiction over foreigners in Bahrein other than the subjects of Arab potentates. An Order m Council conferring such jurisdiction on the Political Agent was made in 1913, It was supplemented by a further Order in 1922. Since 1920 jurisdiction over all foreign subjects has rested with the British authorities within the limits of the Orders in Council. 132.

Persian Claim reasserted, 1922-23. 134 In 1922 His Majesty's Consul at Bunder Abbas r^pojted ^ ersian passport officials at Hingah had ruled that Bahreinis were Persian subjects and should be given Persian passports. They seized two British certificates or identity granted to Bahrein subjects, but on representa tions being made by the Minister at Tehran instructions were given by the Central Government that there was to be no repetition of this incident. In 1922, also, the Persian delegate at a Postal Conference held at Bushire stated that 3 while not for the moment pressing for the transfer to Persia ^ ot the Bahrein post office, his action was without prejudice to the Persian claim to Bahrein. 135. In 1923, consequent on a Press campaign and a discussion m the Majliss on the desirability of oivin^ Bahrein the right to return a member to the Persian Parlia ment, which was referred to a Commission for report His Majesty's Government decided that it was desirable to address a formal Note to the Persian Government in terms similar to those employed in 1906 (paragraph 124 above). Owing to the difficult internal situation in Persia this proposal was dropped, but in September 1923 the Persian P - G - 13 - Government was informed that the island was now a British q 7 ' 8 ' §§ 27 ~ pi otectorate, and that His Majesty's Government did not contemplate any alteration of its status. The Persian Minister for loreign Affairs replied that the Government of which he was a member had no intention of laying claim to Bahrem on behalf of Persia. But despite this statement the Minister for Foreign Affairs again reverted to the question m the following month. His Majesty's Government remove Sheikh Isa for Misgovernment (1923). 13*5. Consequent on the gross misgovernment of Sheikh Isa, who had been ruler of Bahrein since 1869, the Sheikh was deprived by His Majesty's Government of his control of affairs m Bahrein on 26th May 1923, and was granted an allowance, his son, Sheikh Hamad (whose right of succession had been recognised by His Majesty's Government in 1901) §s fi-u being appointed to act for him 'as his father's fullv empowered agent.'

The Treaty of Jedda, concluded on 20th May 1927, between His Majesty's Government and Ibn Sand, the ruler of Saudi Arabia, in substitution for the Treaty of 1915' (paragraph 133 above), provided inter alia that 'His Majesty the King of the Hedjaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies' should l&lt; maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the territories of . . . Bahrein and with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty's Government.' Consequent thereon, a strong protest was received on 26th November 1927 from the Persian Government, copies, of which were despatched to the League of Nations. The Persian protest was based essentially on the recognition stated to have been accorded to Persian sovereignty over Bahrein in Lord Clarendon's Note of 29th April 1869 (paragraph 85 above). A reasoned reply to the Persian Note was despatched hy His Majesty's Government on 18th January 1928, and circulated to the League. While avoiding any definite statement as to their own position in Bahrein or its basis. His Majesty's Government in their Note repudiated the Persian claim in the strongest terms, and intimated that no argument such as was suggested could be based on the communication of 29th April 1869. Attitude of Sheikhs to Persian claim (1928). 139. The Sheikhs of Bahrein, on being apprised of the- revival of Persia's claim, gave a letter to the Political Resident, requesting His Majesty's Government in accordance P. 1409/28. with their treaties ' to defend Bahrein from outside inter ference ' and to act as their agents in rebutting the Persian claims, and intimating that the Sheikhs proposed to send Sheikh Mohamed, brother of Sheikh Hamad, the deputy ruler, and son of the deposed ruler, Isa, as their representative in answering the claim should the case be taken to Geneva. Further Persian Protest, 2nd August 1928. 140. On the 2nd August 1928 the Persian Government P. 4184/28. communicated a lengthy and reasoned reply to the British Note of 18th January 1928. The Note based its reiteration of the Persian claim on the principle that territory belonging, to a sovereign State could definitely be detached from that State only with the consent of the State in question, which had not been given in the case of Bahrein ; and alleged that the terms of the Foreign Office Note of 29th April 1869 were con clusive evidence of the view then held of the rights of Persia by His Majesty s Government; that Bahrein had consistently recognised Persian sovereignty, as could be proved by documentary evidence, up to the date when the Sheikhs were instigated to rebellion by a foreign government; that no valid argument could be founded on the direct relations into 'which the Sheikhs had entered with His Majesty's Govern ment, since their action had been without the approval of then suzeiain ; that the relations of Bahrein with Persia were more highly developed than with any other independent civilised country; that the Persian claim had been con sistently and uninterruptedly pressed ; and finally that even if the Ireaty of 1822 was disavowed by His Majesty's Government, it was material evidence of the view held by a British officer of great experience at the time of its con clusion, and that its disavowal by the then Shah of Persia was not because of any doubt on his part as to the true status of Bahrein. 1640 29. 141.

Persian Government, based on the ground that, Bahrein 0I1 being Persian territory, neither the Sheikh nor His Majesty's li Government had any right to grant a concession. The piotest reserved the right of Persia to claim damages, lieaty negotiations were at the time proceeding with Persia, and it was thought unnecessary to send any reply to this Note, which was, however, circulated, at the request of the Persian Government, to the League of Nations. Discussions between His Majesty's Government and Persia 1928-34. ^ ' 14o. Between 1928 and 1934 treaty negotiations, with a view to the conclusion of a general treaty which should dispose of outstanding points of difference, were in progress with Persia, the question of Bahrein figuring prominentlv in those negotiations. The general attitude taken by 'the Peisians was thai Bahrein was a point of great importance to them, but that in return for a sufficient guid pro cjuo they would be prepared to abandon their claims. His Majesty's Government on their side consistently maintained that the Persian claim was worthless, and that while they would gladly see it finally oisposed of as part of a general settlement, they would not be prepared to make any specific concession in return lor its abandonment. Various formulas were worked out in discussion between His Majesty's Representatives in lehian and the lepresentatives of the Persian Government with a view to an agreed solution. The negotiations have, however, failed^ to reach any conclusion and are at the moment suspended without any prospect of early resumption. . 144: ', Iri 1935 the Persian Government protested to His P.Z.4902/33 Majesty's Government against the issue of British Indian postage stamps surcharged ' Bahrein,' and repeated their protest ^to the League. Their protest was rejected by His Majesty's Government, and the stamps issued in August 1933. On 22nd May 1934 a further protest against the operation of the Bahrein oil concession was addressed by P.Z. 4343/34 the 1 ersian Government to the United States Minister at lehran, the United States Government and His Majesty's Government, and copies were circulated at the request of leisia to the League of iNations. His Majesty's Government propose to reply to this communication in a Note drawing attention to their Notes of Januar} 7 1928 and Februarv 1929 and to request the League of Nations to circulate this reply to the States Members of the Leag-ue. XIV.—Conclusion. 145. It may be convenient in concluding this memoran dum on the recent history of Bahrein to summarise very briefly the claims to sovereignty over the island which have been advanced by various countries since 1783 ; the particular basis of those claims in the case of Persia (whose claim is alone at the present time of any importance); and the basis and development of the attitude of His Majestv's Government. A. Claims to or Assertions of Sovereignty over Bahrein 1873 to 1934. 146—(a) Muscat. —Bahrein subject to Muscat 1800-01 1811 ? to 1816, 1820-22. Tribute paid to Muscat 1820' 2953 k38 Bahreini independence recognised by Treaty 1829. Muscat thereafter deterred by His Majesty's Government from pursuing its claims. (6) Egypt. —Representative of Mehemet AH, Viceroy of Egypt, informed by Her Majesty's Government in 1839 that no claim upon Bahrein could be admitted. But in 1839-40 the Sheikh acknowledged Egyptian supremacy and he paid tribute during this period. (c) Wahahi Amirs of the Arab Mainland, —Bahrein under protection of or subject to Wahabi Amirs 1803-11 ; 1816 ; 1830-33 (tributary); 1836—1838-39 (tributary) ; 1847 (tributary); 1852 (tribute). In 1867 (see paragraph 75) it was held by Government of India that tribute was paid to the Wahabis only in respect of mainland possessions and not of Bahrein. The claims of the Amirs disappeared with the conquest of Hasa by Turkey in 1871. {d) Turkey. —The islands have never in the period subse quent to 1783 been occupied by Turkey or (if the incidents of 1860-61 (paragraphs 67-9 above) are ignored) subject to Turkish sovereignty. But Turkish claims to them were advanced, directly or indirectly, in 1847, 1851, 1870, 1874, 1875, 1876, 1879, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1895, 1896 and 1905, and on each occasion, save in 1847, when certain assurances were given by Turkey (paragraph 52), were rejected by the British Government. The Turkish claim was finally withdrawn in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. That Convention was never ratified, but the withdrawal of the claim was confirmed by Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923. (e) Persia. —The Persian claim has been consistently urged on a variety of occasions through the period in question. The Sheikhs momentarily submitted themselves to Persia iu 1799 and paid tribute. In 1816-17 they received a Persian envoy and apparently appealed for help to Tehran. They again momentarily submitted to Persia and received an envoy in 1839. Persian aid was invoked and a Persian emissary received at Bahrein in 1860-61, while in 1869 the deposed ex-Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa may have made overtures to Persia (though there is no confirmation of this) to enable him to re-establish his control over the island. The Persian claim appears, apart from this, to have been asserted in 1822, 1825, 1844, 1848, 1861, 1862, 1866, 1868, 1869,1886, 1901, 1905, 1906, 1907, 1910, 1927, 1928, 1930, 1932-33 and 1934, and to have been rejected by His Majesty's Government in 1822 (as part of their refusal to accept Captain Bruce's Treaty), 1825, 1844,1848, 1861,1862, 1866-67,1869, 1901, 1906, 1907, 1908-09, 1923, 1928, 1929, 1933 and 1934. B.—Basis of the Persian Claim. 147. Ignoring contentions such as that the use of the term ' Persian Gulf ' is a recognition of Persian sovereignty over the various islands of the Gulf, Persia has at one time or other based her claim on the nine grounds examined below :— (1) History of the Islands prior to 1783. The history of the islands prior to the expulsion of the Persians in 1783 is dealt with in paragraphs 3 to 5 above. It will be seen that at various periods since the beginning of the Christian era, Persia has exercised a degree of control over the islands, and in particular that during the 30 years prior to 1783 her control was of a more definite character. On the other hand, the facts recorded above do not support any clairn by Persia to an uninterrupted occupation or control of the islands.39 Persia has on various occasions in the past appealed to the early history of Bahrein in support of her claim that it is historically Persian territory. Since 1930, too, certain Persian newspapers, presumably inspired, have dealt at considerable length with the history of Bahrein in the more or less remote past, and have supported their statements by quotations from, or references to, Arab or Persian geographers or historians. Owing to the absence of records and the shortness of time available, it has been impossible to check these statements in detail, or to conduct elaborate researches into the writings of Arab geographers and others from which further information might be secured. But it is arguable that the position of the islands prior to 1783 is at most only of very indirect importance in the present connection. The essential weakness in the Persian claim ib, it is suggested, thst there has been no effective exercise of authority in the islands by Persia since her expulsion in 1763, and that the Sheikhs, who originally established themselves by conquest, have now acquired a prescriptive title, based on an uninterrupted occupation of 150 years by the present ruling family. (- j ) The Absence of Pevsian Consent to the DetcLchment of Bahrein from Persia. The Persian Government, in paragraph 2 of their Note of 2nd August 1928 (Appendix B), invited attention to the following international juridical principle. ... A territory belonging to a sovereign State cannot be lawfully detached so long as the right of ownership has not been transferred by this State to another State in virtue of an official act, in this case a treaty, or so long as its annexation by another State or its independence have not been officially recognised by the lawful owner of the territory.' They added (correctly) that Persia has never renounced her sovereignty or ceded it to another State or ever recognised any of the Sheikhs of Bahrein as independent rulers. The argument put forward by the Persian Government under this head is examined in detail in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Note despatched by the Foreign Office on 18th February 1929 in reply to the Perlan Note of 2nd August 1928 (Appendix _B). His Majesty's Govern ment expiessed their inability to agree that any such principle, if alleged to be of universal application, formed part of international law. The deciding factor in the question of international title in cases in which territory has effectively established its independence of the former sovereign is the effective establishment by that territory of its independence, 'and in the case of Bahrein His Majesty's Government regard as wholly untenable the pro position that effective possession and administration by the present ruling family for 145 years, during which these rulers hava been independent of Persia and during which no Persian authority has been exercised in their dominions, can be affected by the mere consideration that the Persian Government have not set their signature to a document formally recognising the fact of their independence.' In paragraph 7 of the same Note His Majesty's Government cite historical precedents to show that the theory of the necessity for the formal consent of the dispossessed State is not one which has ever obtained international acceptance. (3) The Unratified Treaty of 1822. The circumstances in which the Treaty of 1822 was concluded by Captain Bruce with the representative of the 1 unce Governor of Shiraz are set out in paragraphs 20—21 above. As will be seen, Captain Bruce concluded it without40 the authority of or reference to Government. The treaty into which he had entered was immediately officially dis avowed, and the Persian Government so informed, and Captain Bruce, as a sign of disapproval of his action, was removed from his appointment. The Persian Government on their side equally disapproved the action of the Prince Governor of Fars in entering into any treaty discussions without the prior approval of the Shah. [The Persian Government were reminded of this in 1825, 1845, 186G, 1907, 1928 and 1929.] It appears impossible in these circum stances to base any legitimate claim to Persian sovereignty over Bahrein on the provisions of the Treaty of 1822. (4) The Gold Coin alleged to have been struck at Bahrein in 1817. Please see paragraph 47 above. A Persian Mission appears to have visited Bahrein in 1816 or 1817 (paragraph 9 above) and it is conceivable that a coin might have been struck on that occasion. On the other hand, it would probably be extremely difficult to prove that the coin had not in fact been struck elsewhere,, though with an indication that it had been minted at Bahrein. The incident is in itself of relatively small importance, and it would, it is suggested, be impossible for Persia to use such an incident, even if it could be proved, save in support of arguments of much more sub stantial character. (5) Payment of Peeshkesh, Offerings or Tribute at various Stages by Bahrein to Persia. From paragraph 6 above it will be seen that tribute appears to have been paid by Bahrein to Persia in 1799. The rulers of Bahrein may also have offered to pay tribute in 1839 (paragraph 32) and appear to have offered to do so in 1860 (paragraph 67). In assessing the importance of the payment of tribute in 1799, or, if it then took place, in 1839 or 1860, it is relevant'that such payment or promise of payment was immediately followed by the submission of the rulers of Bahrein, in 1800 to Muscat, in 1839 to the Egyptians, and in I860- to the Turks.^ In estimating the importance of such payments as evidence of a recognition of Persian suzerainty, the arguments advanced by Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran in his Despatch No. 28 of March 1845, in which Colonel Sheil remarks that the Chiefs of Bahrein 'had in all probability from time to time given peeshkesh, offerings, or tribute to Persia as a mark of superiority, as Kandahar and Herat still continue to do, without an acknowledgment of subjection and the comment thereon of the Secret Com mittee of the East India Company that ' presents and complimentary messages do not imply an acknowledgment of sovereignty, and they have not been confined to Persia ' are also relevant. (6) Flying of the Persian Flag by the Sheikh of Bahrein. (a) The Persian flag was hoisted by the Sheikh of Bahrein in^ 1860. But as will be seen from paragraph 67 above, hardly had it been hoisted when, on ihe arrival of a luikish emissary, it was lowered and the Turkish flag hoisted m its place. At a later stage in 1860—61 the Persian and Turkish flags were apparently flown side by side by the Sheikh. It appears difficult in these circumstances to base any substantial argument on the incident. The Notes addressed by the Persian envoy in London to the Foreign Office in February 1869 alleged that the 1 ersian flag had been hoisted by Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah and that the Resident had in September 1868 bombarded the41 Sheikh s palace on which the flag was flying'. There appears to be no foundation for the suggestion that the Persian flag was flying when the Resident reached Bahrein or that it was fired on (see paragraph 80). If previously hoisted it had, by the time of the Resident's arrival, been hauled down. (c) In the undated letters from Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah communicated to the jForeign Office by the Persian envoy in April 1869, the Sheikh stated that he was hoisting the flag of the Lion and Sun over Bahrein. If, as seems probable from internal evidence, these letters date from the period of the abortive Persian Mission to Bahrein of 1860-61, it is relevant in assessing their importance that immediately aftei the reception of the Persian envoy, a Turkish envoy was received, the Persian flag hauled down and the Turkish flag substituted, and that in the early part of 1861 the flags of Persia and Turkey appear to have been flying side by side on the forts at Bahrein. There is nothing to show that either flag flew in Bahrein between the conclusion of the Convention of 1861 (paragraph 70) and 1868. (d) In September 1869 the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah attacked the islands, and with the assistance of Sheikh Md. bm Abdulla killed the ruling Sheikh Ali. The Persian flao' may have been hoisted on this occasion. But there is no reference to this in the detailed reports of the capture of the islands by Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah and Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah, or of the operations as the result of which those bheikhs were reduced at the end of 1869. (Enclosure to Government of India's Despatch No. 7 of 25th January 1870 • Resident s Despatches of 11th September, 25th September' and 5th October 1869.) (7) Letters from past Rulers of Bahrein admitting Persian Suzerainty. It is by no means improbable that in 1799 1816-17 and 1839 the rulers of Bahrein addressed letters to the 1 ersian Government acknowledging Persian suzerainty over a S ' J , inc ' appear certainly to have done so in iobU. But the only letters the text of which has ever been communicated to Her Majesty's Government are the two letters communicated by the Persian envoy in London in 1869. i hose letters indeed categorically acknowledge Persian suzerainty over Bahrein and state that it has been uniuter- ruptedly exercised in the past. But they appear to date trom looO, and the submission of Bahrein to Turkey and the hauling down oi the Persian flag in the same year are it is suggested, material in assessing the weight to be attached to them. (b) Declai ations made hy Her Majesty's Government to the Persian Minister in London, April 1869. (a) These declarations are examined in paragraph 98 above. Ihe text of the Note addressed by the Secretary of fetate lor r oreign Affairs to the Persian envoy on 29th April lb69, on which the subsequent Persian claims have to a considerable extent been based, is given in paragraph 85 above. The wording of that Note, and the general attitude adopted by Her Majesty's Government, as evidenced by their acquiescence in the despatch of a mission to Bahrein bv Persia, undoubtedly afforded Persia justification for the mierences she appears to have drawn. But, as pointed out in paragraph 10 of the Note addressed to the Persian Minister on loth February 1929 and reproduced in Appendix B tie Note m question, while very loosely expressed, was 2953 jj42 never intended to bear the interpretation now placed upon it by the Persian Government (cp. in this connection para graphs 102 and 110 above), and in stating that due consideration had been given in the past by Her Majesty's Government to the Persian claim it did not in any way admit that that claim was valid. The Note, indeed, con firmed the intention of the British Government to continue to hold the Sheikhs to the treaty engagements which had been entered into with them as independent rulers. (6) The undertaking given by Her Majesty's Government in the same correspondence to communicate in future with Persia before undertaking punitive action against the rulers of Bahrein is prima facie consistent with a recognition by Her Majesty's Government of Persian claims to that island. But it appears, however, in fact to have been no more than a courteous indication by His Majesty's Government of their desire to pay the fullest possible attention to any Persian claims. It will be observed that the first (and apparently the only) communication made to the Persian Government in discharge of this understanding, intimated to that Government the intention of Her Majesty's Government to proceed at once against the ' Chief now in possession of Bahrein ' consequent on his breach of the maritime peace and his attack on the Sheikh who had been placed in power at Bahrein by the British Government. (9) Closeness of Relations at the present Day between Persia and Bahrein. The Sheikhs of Bahrein are strongly opposed to any recognition of Persian suzerainty (cp. paragraph 139). The Persian suggestion that relations are at the present time closer between Persia and Bahrein than between Bahrein and any other independent civilised State is without founda tion. Relations are at least equally close with Saudi Arabia, and the closest relations are maintained in addition with Great Britain and with British India. The Terms of the Treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857 between the British Government and Persia. 148. In addition to the nine arguments examined above, Persia has on more than one occasion appealed to the provisions of her treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857 with the British Government in connection with her claim to Bahrein. Her appeal is based substantially on the fact that those treaties provide in certain circumstances for the evacuation of Persian territory occupied by British troops. The relevant passages of the treaties are as follows :— # (i) By the preliminary Treaty of 1809 between His Majesty s Gro \ernment and Persia, the Persian Government undertook not to ^ permit any European force whatever to past) through 1 eisia either towards India or towards the ports of that country ; while His Majesty's Government undertook ' in case any European forces have invaded or shall invade the territories of His Majesty the Kino- of Persia ' to ' afford to His Majesty the King of Persia a force or in heu of it a subsidy, with warlike ammunition and officers. ...' Article 5 of the same treaty provided ; ' If a detachment of British troops has arrived from India in the Gulf of Persia and, by the consent of His Persian Majesty, landed on the island of Karak or any of the Persian ports, they shall not in any manner possess themselves of such places, and from the date of these preliminary articles the said detachment shallW) : ^ 7 Zjt ■M: 43 be at the disposal of His Majesty the King of Persia, the amount of which shall be settled in the definitive treaty.' Article 6 piovided that £&lt; If the said troops remain by the desire of His Majesty the King of Persia either at Karak oi at any other port in the G-nlf of Persia ' they shall be treated in a friendly manner by the Governor and arrange ments made for the supply to them of provisions, &amp;c. at fair prices. (ii) Treaty of 18!4.—Article (2) provides that 'His Aitch XIII im ' i tannic Majesty further engages not to interfere in any No.vii, 60. dispute which may hereafter arise between the Princes, noble men and great chiefs of Persia, and if one of the contending parties should even offer a Province of Persia with a view to obtaining assistance, the English Government shall not agree to such proposal, nor by adopting it possess themselves ol such part of Persia.' Article 11 provided that ' Should His Persian Majesty Aitch. XIII, require assistance from the English Government in the No. xviii, 81. Persian Gulf, they shall, if convenient and practicable, assist him with ships of war and troops. The expenses of such expedition shall be accounted for and defrayed by the Persian Government, and the above ships shall anchor in such ports as shall be pointed out by the Persian Government and not at other harbours without permission, except from absolute necessity.' (iii) The Treaty of Peace of 4th March 1857, drawn up on the conclusion of the war between Persia and Great Britain, provided that^ ' Peace being happily concluded between f 1( l MajeS V e8 ' 11 18 hereby agreed that the forces of ■ l ?• 9 Tieen s ball evacuate Persian territory, subject to the conditions and stipulations hereafter specified ' (Art 2) and that''immediately on the exchange of the ratifications ot this treaty the British troops will desist from all acts of ostility against Persia, and the British Government engages lurthei that as soon as the stipulations in regard to evacua tion by the Persian troops of the Herat and Afghan territories as well as m regard to the reception of the British Mission at lehran shall have been carried into full effect, the British troops shall without delay be withdrawn from all ports places and islands belonging to Persia. . . If Bahrein were Persian territory and if it liad been occupied by British forces at the times envisaged by the treaty provisions to which appeal is made by Persia, there might be some force in the Persian argument, though even then His Majesty s Government might claim that the fact that their actual relations with Bahrein had in no way been affected by the provisions of those treaties, and that ersia had made no protest at the time against any failure to implement those provisions clearly showed that Persia had accepted m the past the fact that Bahrein fell outside her territorial limits. In fact, neither in 1809, 1814 nor u- ivr WaS ) ^ an y British occupation of Bahrein; while Mis Majesty s Government, never having admitted Persian sovereignty oyer Bahrein or regarded Bahrein as an part Persia, have in the past adopted the attitude that the terms of the treaties referred to above are irrelevant tor the present purpose. As stated by His Majestv's Government m 1906 in reply to a Persian Note which based the Persmn claim upon the provisions of those treaties, ' the treaties of 1809 1814 and 1857 on this subject have always been scrupulously observed by His Majesty's Government iiave 110 bearing on the present question. His Majesty 's44 Government Lave never admitted the ownership or sove reignty of Persia over Bahrein. Such a claim is in their view entirely inadmissible.' Review of the Persian Claim. 149. It is relevant in the first place that from 1847 to 1913 the Turkish claim to Bahrein was pressed with at least equal vigour to the Persian claim, and that through much of that period the Turkish claim had a stronger practical justification than can be claimed by Persia since a period long prior to 1783, in that Turkey was the suzerain of the adjoining continental littoral of Arabia and held or preferred claims to both sides of the Gulf by which Bahrein is enfolded. Moreover, Muscat, which in the early part of the 19th century on more than one occasion established a temporary control over Bahrein and drew tribute from it, was deterred from urging its claims by force from 1829 onwards only by the attitude of His Majesty's Government, while the Wahahi Amirs brought effective pressure to bear on Bahrein and drew tribute from it, though latterly probably in respect only of Bahreini possessions on the mainland, at frequent intervals through the early part of the 19th century, and desisted only with their subjugation by Turkey in 1870. Persia, in other words, was up to 1913 one only of the claimants to Bahrein, and through much of the period 1847 to 1913 if anything a less insistent and to some extent a less plausible claimant than Turkey. 150. These considerations, however, apart, the general effect of a review of the history of Bahrein over the last 150 years aud of an examination of the specific arguments put forward by Persia and referred to in paragraphs 147-8 above is to suggest that there is no solid basis for a Persian claim to suzerainty or sovereignty over the islands. The geographical remoteness of the islands from Persia and the fact that their population is Arab are admittedly not decisive arguments. The real weakness in the Persian claim appears to be that there has been no effective exercise of Persian authority in the islands since the expulsion of Persia by the ancestors of the present ruling house in 1783. Such incidents as the momentary hoisting of the Persian flag in 18G0, its flying side by side with the Turkish flag in 1860-61, or ^e temporary tender of aJlegiance to Persia in 1799, 1816-] 7 and 1839 must be considered in relation to the history of the islands as a whole, in the period now under consideration, and in particular to the consistent claim of Turkey between 1847 and 1913 and to the absence of any sequel to such momentary acknowledgment of or appeals to Persian power; and they cannot carry the weight of a long dealing extending over a course oi years. The remarks of the Government of India in 1870, quoted in paragraph 97 above, are relevant in this connection, as are the observa^ tions in paragraph 8 of the British Note to Persia of 18th February 1929. It may be added, too, that during the period from 1783 Bahrein has at various dates been in a position to enter into treaty engagements or discussions with neighbouring States s y -J 18 Muscat (paragraph 26), Turkey (paragraph 103), n -6 ^ Pti * n y^ cero y» Mehemet Ali (paragraph 34) and His Majesty s Government on a basis inconsistent with her being at the time subject to Persian jurisdiction. A further pomt of some importance is the absence, so far as available records show, of any reference to Persia by the Sheikhs of em, at any date since the conquest of Bahrein by the ancestors of the present rulers in 1783, on the occasion of? ip fcir 1^—BB 45 their accession, or of any formal acknowledgment by Bahrein on such occasions of sovereignty or suzerainty such as might be expected from a Sheikh who regarded himself as a vassal of Persia. Nor does any protest at the absence of any such formal acknowledgment appear at any time to have been made by Persia. 151. The correspondence of 1869-70, to which particular attention has been paid by Persia in the past, and which may be thought the strongest contention that Persia is in a position to put forward, may indeed be quoted as evidence of the view taken by Her Majesty's Government at that period of the relation of Persia to Bahrein. But it cannot be valid as against the Sheikhs, and while it is sufficiently loosely expressed to afford some justification for the construction which has been placed on it by Persia, it is relevant that the construction placed on it by Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, and supported by the Government of India, passed without challenge in 1871 (paragraph 102); that^ a similar interpretation was placed on it, with a minimum of preliminary discussion, iu 1886 (paragraph 110); that at frequent intervals between 1870 and 1880 His Majesty's Government maintained the independence of Bahrein against Turkey (paragraphs 99-107 above); that so early as January 1870 they drew the attention of the Turkish Government to the British Note of 1851 (para graph 61 above); and that His Majesty's Government have uninterruptedly maintained the independence of Bahrein against Persia and Turkey alike since the date of the correspondence in question. 152. The Sheikhs themselves appear, particularly in the early part of the past century, before their relations with Her Majesty's Government were placed on a more definite footing by the Agreements of 1880 and 1892, to have been guided by a consideration of their own immediate interests in deciding on the line of policy to be adopted towards the stronger rulers by whom they were surrounded. But not only is it now almost three-quarters of a century since any appeal, however flimsy, appears to have been made to Persia by Bahrein, but the present Sheikh (like his predecessor) is keenly apprehensive of any recognition of the Persian claim, to which he is most strongly opposed. C.—Attitude of British Government, 1820-1934. 153. From 1820 onwards His Majesty's Government consistently dealt with the Sheikhs as independent rulers. They concluded treaties with them on that basis in 1820, 1847, 1861, ]868, 1880 and 1892, and they have been prepared to maintain their independence by diplomatic, or on occasion by forcible methods against challenge from outside, whether from Persia, Turkey, Egypt or the Wahabis. They originally entered into relations with the Sheikhs and promised them a measure of protection (para graph 16) in the interests of securing the peace of the Persian Gulf. In the early stages of those relations they appear to have been solely concerned to achieve this object (in 1820 they even offered their mediation, which was, however, not accepted by Persia, to secure the payment of tribute to Persia by the Sheikhs), and they restricted their inter ference with the internal affairs of the Sheikhdom to the minimum required to secure the interests of British subjects. They were consistently reluctant to establish a protectorate over Bahrein in view of the probable local embarrassments in regulating the succession, &amp;c., in which this might 2953 M46 involve them, and in 18 -19 they formally declined a request by the Sheikh that he and the islands should be taken under British protection. In 1861 (paragraph 70) they gave the Sheikhs more categorical guarantees of protection in return for more binding undertakings. Their corre spondence with the Persian Minister in Loudon in 1869-70 shows the Home Government, however, still ready at that date to adopt the attitude that if any other Power would discharge the objects which had led Great Britain to undertake certain responsibilities in relation to Bahrein, she would gladly see them do so. Closer relations with the Sheikh and closer control over his freedom of action were established for the first time by the Exclusive Agree ment of 1880. Relations became closer still with the conclusion of the Exclusive Agreement of 1892. Since that date the position of Bahrein, though His Majesty's Government make no claim to sovereignty, though the Sheikhdom continues to be regarded as independent from the international standpoint, and though the Sheikhs enjoy a very large measure of interual autonomy, has tended increasiugh' to approximate to that of a State under British protection.

Government and the Wahabi Amirs and Ibn Saud himself; and tmally the extent to which either the Wahabi Amirs or Ibn baud m the pre-war period can properly be regarded as Turkish vassals or have admitted or claimed Ottoman nationality. 2. The period to be covered falls into the following sections : (!) 1745 to 1800.—First development of the VVahabi sect, (2) 1800 to 1870-71.—From the first expansion of the Wahabis in Eastern tq - w Vn,, 4 , ^ Baraimi and the Turkish occupation of Hasa.

O rigin of the W ahabi S ect. annecessar y to examine in detail the sources and early history of the Wahabi movement. The sect appears to have been founded by Abdul Wahab and his son, Mohamed Ibn Abdul Wahab, in the early part of the eighteenth century in ^ejd, and to have advocated a return to the primitive simplicity which prevailed among the early followers of Islam in the lifetime of the Prophet. The founders of the sect connected themselves with the Sheikhs of the Saudi family, who then ruled at Denyah m Nejd ; and the movement, originally religious in character rapidly assumed a political complexion. The Saudi Sheikhs, with the assistance of the impetus given them by the Wahabi movement, rapirllv extended their local influence under the Amir Mohamed, who ruled from 1745 to 1765, at the expense hrst of the neighbouring rulers of Riyadh and then of the Beni Khalid, who had, since the middle of the seventeenth century, been the principal tribe in Hasa. 4. The first Wahabi Amir died in 1765 and was succeeded by his son, Abdul Aziz, who ruled till his assassination in October or November of 1803. Riyadh was captured in 1/72 and the whole of Nejd came under Wahabi rule. The Lor. I, province of Hasa was subdued for the first time in 1792 and finally in 1795, and 1053-6. the powei of the Beni Khalid broken. Attempts by the Ottoman Government to Ross: Nejd, re-establish its control failed, and a truce for six years, under which the Wahabis pp ' 38 ~ 9 - remained in possession of Hasa, was concluded in 1799. ^ 1059. The Political Situation in Arabia in 1800. o. With the conquest of Hasa the Saudis commenced to turn their attention to the east and south. The occasion is a convenient one briefly to review the political situation in Arabia in the year 1800. It was as follows :— furkey^ held Iraq; exercised what appears to have been a controlling influence in Ivoweit, and maintained a claim to Hasa and its ports. The Hejaz was also held by a Turkish vassal, the Sherif of Mecca.Lor. I, 429. 2 7. The Wahabi Amirs held Hasa and Nejd. 8. Bahrein was in the possession of the Uttabi Sheikhs, who, originally settl on the mainland of Arabia at Zubarah in Qatar, had expelled the Persians f Bahrein in 1783. The Bahreini Sheikhs, apprehensive of attack by Muscat hacT 1 1799 made overtures to Persia and paid her tribute. In 1800 they were temnorari 11 subdued by JMuscat. 9. Qatar. —The Uttabi Sheikhs of Bahrein had hereditary possessions in Qat and took refuge there on their expulsion from the islands by Muscat in 1800. ^ 10. The present-day Trucial Coast, then knowm as the Pirate Coast, was ruled by Arab Sheikhs, the ancestors of the present Trucial Sheikhs. Of these Sheikhs only twx) were of real importance, the Beni Yas Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and the rival' Jowasimi Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah, whose capital was later removed to Shargah These rulers were separated by a secular enmity, and belonged to the opposing religious factions of the Hinawi and the Ghafari. The fact that the Rulers of Muscat also belonged to the Hinawi faction formed a link between Muscat and Abu Dhabi The Sheikhs of the Pirate Coast held a fringe of varying depth along the coast, hut do not appear to have exercised any real influence in the remoter hinterland, which was in the possession of Bedouin tribes. 11. At the eastern end of Arabia was the independent Sultanate of Muscat, at this time ruled by the able and vigorous Saiyid Sultan, who succeeded in 1792, and who had in 1794 extorted a lease of Bunder Abbas and its dependencies from Persia. The Sultan had in 1798 entered into an alliance with the British Govern ment and had in 1800 agreed to receive a British Political Representative. In the same year he succeeded in establishing his dominion over Bahrein. 12. The British Government, represented by the Government of India and the Government of Bombay, were closely 7 associated with Gulf affairs for commercial reasons, but their policy in 1800 and until late in the nineteenth century was essentially to restrict their activities on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf to the minimum necessary to secure the security of the seas and freedom for British and Indian commerce. They were consistently extremely reluctant to involve themselves in any way in the affairs of the hinterland, save to the extent necessary to secure these objects. As will be seen from the statement which follows, they were anxious in these circumstances to observe strict neutrality towards the Wahahis and to abstain from involving themselves in difficulties with this new and considerable mainland Power. II.—1800-1871. From the first expansion of the Wahabis in Eastern Arabia to the Conquest of Hasa by the Turks. 1800 to the Death of Amir Abdul Aziz in O ctober- November 1803. First Wahabi Encroachment in Eastern Arabia. 13. In 1800 the Wahabis for the first time turned their attention to Eastern Arabia. In that year a Wahabi expedition invaded Oman and occupied the oasis of Baraimi—a strategic point of the first importance commanding the approaches to Muscat. In 1801 the Sultan of Muscat was forced by the Uttabi Sheikhs to abandon Bahrein. In 1802 a fresh attack on Bahrein by Muscat was repulsed with ! assistance, but thereafter with brief intervals Bahrein remained under ^anabi influence till 1811, tendered tribute to the Wahabis in 1803, and afforded nava assistance to them against Muscat in 1805. By 1802 the whole coast from Basra to the boundary between Muscat and Shargah at Diba bad been reduced to nonnna submission, and in 1803 the Sultan of Muscat was forced to conclude a tiuce wi the Wahabis, under which Muscat agreed to pay zakat to them, and to al o\\ a Wahabi representative to reside at Muscat. The Wahabis in Western Arabia, 1800-1804. 14. In Western Arabia in the meantime the Wahabis had captured and destroy Kerbela, and had in 1802 decisively defeated a punitive expedition sent a p 11 . them by the Turks. Their control of Hasa and Nejd was now complete, during t t i at; t ? they overran the Hejaz and completed the conquest of the Turk^h is r 1067.' 0 ' on the Red Sea littoral.

Shinas, which was held by a Wababi Governor was 1 forced to surrender. The Government of India, anxious to avoid involvina th selves in any way with the Wahabis, turned a blind eye so far as possible to Wa] 61 }!' responsibility (as to the degree of which there is room for difference of opinion) f the activities of the pirates and gave stringent instructions to the Political Resid t to avoid involving himself in any way with the Wahabi power. 19. The Wahabi Lieutenant in Baraimi, Syed bin Mutlak, proceeded to Neid' 1813, whereupon his successor, Ibn Azdakah, was murdered by the Ben^Yas^f Dhafrah. On Syed bin Mutlak's return later in the same year, he was himself Lor.I, 445, killed in action against the Hajriyin of Oman, and was succeeded by Ibn Ma7r. 650-1, 1076. j n 1^13^ anc [ again in 1814, the Beni Yas Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, who appears to have been more independent of Wahabi intiuence than the Jowasimis, on two occasions combined with Muscat against the Wahabis. In the autumn of 1814 the Wahabi Amir associated himself with explanations Lor. I, 652. and assurances furnished by the de facto Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaima to the Resident in regard to the piracies of the Jowasimis, consequent on which a preliminary agreement, immediately violated by the Jowasimis, was reached in October 1814 ' B ahrein and the W ahabis , 1804-1818. 20. The Wahabis assisted the Sheikhs to regain possession of Bahrein from Muscat in 1801, but the islands thereupon came under the influence of the Wahabi Amir, to whom they offered tribute in 1803, and with whom they co-operated in that year and again in 1805 against Muscat. The Government of Bombay in 181)5 gave no encouragement to suggestions -from the Sheikhs for material assistance to Lor. 1,842-3 enable Bahrein to withhold her support from the Wahabis, under whose control they remained until 1811, when, with the assistance of Muscat, thev again regained their independence. The Saltan of Muscat subsequently claimed that Bahrein had then accepted a liability to pay tribute to him, and in 1816 he made an attack upon the islands which, thanks to the assistance of the Wahabis, with whom and with the Jowasimis the Sheikhs now again allied themselves, was, however, unsuccessful. K oweit and the W ahabis , 1804-1818. 21. In 1803 Koweit, like the rest of the coast, was under Wahabi control, and in that year it assisted the Wahabi Amir in an expedition against Muscat. In 1805 the Sheikh described himself as subject to the Wahabis. But by 1808 Koweit was strong enough to decline to respond to a further appeal for assistance; a Wahabi attack was driven off in J809, and the Sheikh of Koweit appears thenceforward to have remained relatively free of Wahabi influence. Q atar and the W ahabis , 1804-1818. 22. Wahabism was dominant in Qatar between 1809-11, but the Wahabis were expelled by Muscat in the latter year and the authority of Bahrein re-established. In 1816, however. Sheikh Rahmah bin Jabir of Khor Hassan and Damman sided with Muscat against the Wahabis and the Sheikh of Bahrein.

In 1804 Mehemet Ali was appointed Viceroy of Egypt, chiefly in order that he might recover the Hejaz for Turkey. From 1804 to 1810 he concerted bis plans for achieving this object. Between 1810 and 1815 he reconquered the Hejaz and drove the Wahabi Amirs back into Nejd. In 1815 his lieutenants advanced into Qasim, and later in the year the Wahabis were severely defeated, submitted to Tusun Pasha, and sent hostages to Egypt. But the Egyptian Viceroy refused to ratify the understanding reached, and was content with nothing less than the complete subjection of the Wahabi Amirs. x\n offer to accept an Governor of Nejcl and to pay tribute was rejected ; Deriyah was invested, reduce and destroyed in September 1818; and the Wahabi Amir was taken prisoner, sent to Cairo, and executed at Constantinople. His four brothers were sent to Cairo as prisoners. The Wahabi power was, for the time being, completely destroyed, an Turkish (or rather Egyptian) control re-established over Nejd, Hasa, and the tiasa coastal area in the Persian Gulf. Lor. 1, 844.

It is there fore proper that I should assure you that the late expedition to the Persian Gulf did not originate in hostility towards you, but was, as above noticed, directed solely to the destruction of the pirates who had, in direct breach of their own positive engagements and with an entire forgetfulness of the former instances of condescending lenity manifested towards them, long infested the seas in that quarter, plundering vessels and murdering subjects of all nations indiscriminately, for the British Government does not concern itself with the hostilities carried on by you against the members of the Mussulman faith, on account of their alleged deviation from the ordinances of the Koran, and its power will alone be directed against those who, exercising the detestable profession of piracy, are the common enemies of all nations. I he channel of communication between us being now open. I request you will continue to afford me the pleasure of hearing of your prosperity and success.' British Ref usal to assist Muscat against Wahabis, 1810-1811. 27. In 1810, and again in 1811, on the Sultan of Muscat appealing for assistance Nejd Precis, against the Wahabis and representing that his recent co-operation with the British § 26 a. Government had involved him in perpetual and implacable war with them, in which he trusted that the British Government would not remain neutral, the Government of India replied that the British Government had always considered itself to be at peace with the ahabis, their late co-operation with the Sultan not having been in piosecution oi war against the Wahabis generally, but merely for the extirpation ofthe pirates, and that they were therefore no further interested in the him and the Wahabis than they were solicitous for the welfare a C ] 0n etwee n the Imam.

In the same year, however, Bahrein repudiated the agreement of 1831 and maintained itself against the Amir, whose coast it blockaded, until 1836, when peace was made. It is recorded in 1830 b 0 g e i that,^ while pretending to be free and independent, 'Turki had agreed, and XXIV, 439. continued, to pay a small annual tribute to Mehemet Ali Pasha, who approved of his proceedings which he took care to represent in a favourable light.' 3076 c39 Govenirrient below.

Between 1824 and 1830 the Sultan of xMuscat was principally busied w'fh unsuccessful endeavours to reduce the Sheikhs of Bahrein. In li^O'lie suffered severe defeat at the hands of the Bahreinis and made peace with them. In 183^ Lor. 1,1096. in the hope of forwarding his designs in Bahrein, he sent an embassy with presents to the Wahabi Amir. 41. In 1833 the Sultan, with the encouragement of the Government of India made a general agreement with the Wahabis, by which he undertook to pay a zakat of 5,000 dollars a year. A condition of the agreement was that each should hold possession of his coast according to the limits then existing; the Muscat coast extending to Jaalan, and the coast of the Amir to Qatif. Reciprocal assistance was also promised in putting down rebellion. There is nothing to show for how long the tribute continued to be paid. 42. No other events of importance affecting Muscat took place until 1839. In face of the Egyptian invasion and the threat which is constituted to Eastern Arabia, the Sultan of Muscat, with a view to promoting his designs in Bahrein, which he had never abandoned, was then at first disposed to co-operate with the Egyptians, but on becoming aware of the hostility to Egyptian advance of the British Government, he associated himself with the views of the latter and refused a demand for assistance made upon him by the Egyptian Commander in Nejd. Wahabi Relations with Trucial Gman , 1824-1840. Wahabi Overtures, 1824. 43. Immediately on the revival of the Wahabi power in 1824, the Wahabi Amir opened correspondence with all the Sheikhs of the coast, inviting them to renew the relations which had existed prior to the overthrow of the Wahabis by Ibrahim Pasha. The Jowasimi Sheikh of Shargah appears forthwith to have opened Bo. Sel., negotiations with the Wahabis. 'This measure he did not attempt to conceal, but XXIV, 316- assigned self-preservation as his only motive for adopting it.' Matters do not, 9, 437. however, appear to have proceeded far, and in November 1825 the Sheikh enquired Lor. 1, 687. of the Political Resident whether Great Britain would help him to maintain his independence against the Wahabis. He was informed in reply (see paragraph 52 below) that he was the best judge of his own interests, but that no connection or authority would be accepted in excuse of predatory proceedings, while action against Muscat would be considered unfriendly by H.M, Government. Disputes between Muscat, Abu Dhabi, and Shargah over Baraimi, 1824-1826. 44. It may be recorded that in 1824-25 considerable difficulties arose locally between the Sultan of Muscat, the Sheikh of Shargah and the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, over the occupation of the towers of Baraimi, which had apparently been re-occupied by the Trucial Sheikhs on or shortly after the downfall of the VVahabis in 1818.' :i: ' By a solemn treaty the towers in question had previously been declared Bo. Sel. neutral, and on their occupation by Shargah the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, whether in ?TQ IY i^ 17 ^ collcert or independently of the Sultan of Muscat is not clear, had taken up the matter. In December 1824 a reconciliation was negotiated by the Resident, un which the Sheikh of Shargah was to destroy the towers, the Sheikh of Abu Dha i It should, however, be noted that Lorirner (1,450) records a successful raid ' at some time, apparently, between 1821 and 1828 . . , by Saad bin Mutlaq, Wahabi, from Baraimi on the Hajny tribe to avenge their slaying of his father Syed bin Mutlaq (paragraph 19 above). ■ - *4^im on his side destroying a fort which had been built at Derah. In February 1825 the Kesident addressed a strong remonstrance to the Sheikh of Shargah for his delays in destroying the towers and received an evasive answer. In May 1825 the Resident sent his Native Agent, armed with authority from the Sheikh to effect the immediate destruction of the towers, to accompany a Muscat force. Hostilities, ^ r?rr er 'iQOK 01lt be . fc 1 we ? 11 Shargah and Muscat, and the towers remained. In Jctobei lo^o a reconciliation was finally mediated between the two States by the Kesident in which no^ word was said about Baraimi, which appears to have remained m the possession of one or other of the Trucial Chiefs until about 1833.

The Sheikh of Shargah, who had in 1821 abjured Wahabi ' tenets, now, while outwardly professing sympathy with the Wahabis, wrote to the Kesment in July 1830, expressing his earnest desire to co-operate with the British Government m checking their further progress, and went so far as to declare that he was determined to oppose them even in the event of his not receiving anv support. In reply he was informed that the British Government were iolelv interested m the suppression of piracy and could not interfere in the internal affairs oi the Arab States. But the Wahabi Amir soon made it clear that he was not prepared to encourage any revival of piracy, and that he proposed to look upon the Sheika of Shargah and the Sultan of Muscat as the heads of all the Arabian tribes in Oman. The Sheikh of Ajman, who had asked for a body of troops to Lor -^ 68a enable him to throw off his dependence on Shargah, or even to attain the ascendancy m Shargah territories, and who had also suggested that he should cruise against the enemies of the Waliabis in the Gulf, met with a refusal on the ground inter aha that the h/iiglish being the masters of the sea, the Wahabi Amir was not able to contend with so powerful a nation. In 1831 the Sheikh of Aiman was, however, used by the Amir as his intermediary with the Governor of Bombay (paragraph 53 below T ). * J Wahabi Claim to Suzerainty over Trucial Oman, 1833. 46 By 1833 the Wahabi ruler had established his influence throughout the 1 racial Coast, and m that year a direct demand by the Resident on the Sheikh of onargah for redress for a piracy led to an intemperate letter from the Wahabi -Lieutenant at Baraimi to the Residency Agent at Shargah. As the Wahabi representative had written without authority, no direct notice was taken of his •communication, but the Residency Agent was instructed to point out the long t 0 ij ' A/r an r? ^ reat or ^ eai ' ance s hown before coercive measures had been resorted to by 11.M. Government, 'and further to use other arguments importing the evident E n a P i m 0 , U - 1 , ri ^ t0 ( ^ emaD d redress.' The Wahabi representative replied XXIV, 442. that Amir lurki 1 was now the only authority on the continent of Arabia, and that citizens and Bedouins, maritime as well as inland tribes, having all acknowledged his supremacy, he was in fact the ruler of the country, includino- Majar, Oman, and the coast from Jaalan to Qatif, and that, therefore on the occurrence of any piracy it should be reported to the Wahabi Chief, or in the event of his being at too great a distance, to his Agent at Baraimi.' Abu Dhabi submits to the Wahabis, 1833. i ^ a ^ er ^ le sarrie year the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi was murdered by his brother, who, anxious to consolidate his position, tendered his allegiance and an annual payment of tribute to the Wahabi Amir. The Amir in return informed •onargah that Abu Dhabi was under his protection and that he would permit of no Bo - Sel. aggression upon them. Despite this, and the very categorical assertion of suzerainty XXIY ' 161 ' relerred to m paragraph 46 above, the threats of the Wahabi representative al m Baraimi proved insufficient to overawe Shargah, and in 1834 peace was concluded between Shargah and Abu Dhabi, one condition of which was that Debai should Lor.

The Wahabis about this time were still blockaded by the Sheikh of Bahrein and called in the assistance of Shargah against the Sheikhs of that island. On the murder in 1834 of Amir Turki this question, however, dropped, and the effect of the murder is stated to have introduced such confusion and discord into Wahahi affairs ' as to counteract the operation of any ambitious views of late entertained ^ by the murdered chief, and for a time, at least, to loave the maritime tribes m the same relative position as before. fn 1836 the preponderating influence of Mehemet Ali in the west began to afford a salutary check on Wahabi encroachments towards the coast of the Persian Gulf. In that year the Wahabi agent at Baraimi failed to secure the maritime assistance of Muscat and the coastal tribes against Bahrein, and by 1838 the Wahabis had lost Baraimi to the local tribe of the Beni Nairn', though in what circumstances is not clear.

By 1833, however, the Sheikhs of Bahrein felt sufficiently strong to defy the Amir and between 1834 and 1836 they blockaded the coast of Ilasa and caused sufficient inconvenience to the Wahabis to lead the latter to call in the assistance (which was not, in fact, accorded) of the Jowasimi Sheikh of Shargah. In 1836, however, alarmed by' indications of an active assertion of the Persian claim and by the possibility of a coalition between Muscat and Persia, Bahrein reached a friendly agreement with the Amir, under which the Sheikh was to pay a nominal tribute of 2,000 dollars, while the Amir undertook to supply troops for the defence of Bahrein against external attacks, and to refrain from calling on the Sheikh for marine transport in the event of a Wahabi attack on Muscat by sea. In 1839 the Wahabi Lor. 1,1098. general, Umr bin Ufeysan, took refuge at Bahrein on the fall of the Amir Feisul Q atar and the W ahabis , 1824-1840. 50. Little of moment happened in Qatar between 1824 and 1840. Daring much of this period the authority of the Sheikh of Bahrein was paramount. In 1835 Lor 1 857 the people of Huwailah rebelled against Bahrein and entered into correspondence with the Wahabis.

In 1825 on the revival of the Wahabi power in Nejd, the Jowasimi Sheikh of Shargah enquired whether he might look to the British Governmen assistance should he endeavour to maintain his independence against a intrigue. He was informed in reply that he was the best judge of his own ui eie L &gt; ' but that no connection or authority would be received by the British as an excuse for any proceedings bearing a predatory character. _ He v ''! s warned against co-operating with the Wahabis against the territories o - * Nejd Precis, ' The language held on this occasion was confirmed by the Governor L oi on V J we § Council, with a further intimation, that, however improbable it might e ^ should act against the Wahabis so long as they confined their conques s shore, it was still not desirable that we should bind ourselves to a f ^ a11 ] 1 am ' s interposition or hold out so great an encouragement to the invasion ot t ie territories as our avowed indifference would be likely to afford.'Khalid. A letter addressed hy him to the Sultan of Muscat, directing Muse assist or be considered an enemy, was returned, but the Jowasimi Chief of Shar ] at his instigation, summoned the Beni Naim, ' who had lately got possession i Baraimi,' to surrender it to the Nejdis. The Beni Naim refused and appealed t Abu Dhabi and the Chief of Sohar in Muscat for aid against the common enem Representations were also made to the Political Resident. ^ British Countermeasures and Support for Beni Nairn of Baraimi, 59. H.M. Government were at this time principally concerned to reduce Mehemet Ali to his proper position as a Turkish vassal and to prevent any further Egyptian advance in Eastern Arabia. The application of the Beni Naim chiefs was therefore well received ; the Resident held out hopes that a British agent would be sent to Baraimi (Captain Hamerton subsequently visited the oasis in January-Februarv of 1840) ; and he undertook, if necessary, to supply ammunition to the Chiefs. The Suftan of Muscat, who had at first shown a disposition to take the side of the Lor. I, 4o7. Egyptians, in the hope of re-establishing his ascendancy over Bahrein, was informed of the attitude of H.M. Government, and was called upon to support the Beni Naim chiefs, a request to which he acceded. The Resident, after a formal protest against the proceedings and intrigues of the Egyptian Commander as being in direct opposition to the assurances which had been given by Mehemet Ali to H.M. Govern ment, obtained a written agreement from the maritime chiefs of Oman to cultivate close relations with the British Government, to abide by its wishes and instructions, and to resist to the last extremity all attempts by the Egyptian Commander to subdue them. Withdrawal of Egyptian Agent under British pressure. 60. The Sheikh of Shargah, at his own request, was furnished with a document requiring him to demand the immediate departure of the Egyptian Agent. This was communicated to the Agent, who was also informed that, the British Govem- ment having taken the chiefs and tribes of Nairn in Baraimi under their protection, he would be held responsible for any injury to them; and he was required, in accordance with the assurances given bj 7 Mehemet Ali, to withdraw from Trucial Oman. After repeated remonstrances he quitted the Trucial Coast and, embarking at Shargah (where he is alleged to have been assured by the Sheikh that if he returned to Oman in force Shargah would join him and place all its resources at his disposal), proceeded to Ojair. The withdrawal of Sa'ad Bin Mutlak was a severe blow to Egyptian influence and is stated to have broken up the combination rapidly forming in favour of Mehemet Ali. The Government of India approved the action taken by the Resident, but intimated to him that they would not be prepared to extend protection to Baraimi. Egyptian Evacuation of Nejd, 1840. 61. After the departure of the Wahabi Agent an attack w T as made on the Beni Naim at Baraimi by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, who was called to account by the Resident and required to make reparation to the Beni Naim. In the same year (1839) the Sheikh of Qatif was warned that any expedition against Oman or the territories of the Sultan of Muscat would be opposed by the British naval squadron in the Gulf. In 1840, internal dissensions breaking out among the Egyptians, Sa'ad bin Mutlak was arrested and sent under escort to Riyadh, while in May ot that year the Egyptians evacuated Nejd, leaving the puppet Amir Khalid in charge as an Egyptian tributary. Attitude of H.M. Government, 1839-1841. 62. During the period 1839-41 H.M. Goyernment departed from their policy of refusing to concern themselves in the internal affairs of the Trucial Sheikhdoms and of their hinterland. This modification of their attitude was directed by considerations of European rather than of Arabian policy. As will he seen below, once the Egyptian menace had been disposed of they reverted to their policy of non intervention, and the Sheikhs of Baraimi, who, not unnaturally, had been encourage by the attitude adopted b} 7 H.M.

For a year at the beginning of this period the Egyptian nominee Khalid remained m control. He was overthrown in September 1841 by Abdulla bin Soneyan, likewise a member of the ruling Wahabi family. Abdulla was himself overthrown m May-June of 1842 by the ex-Amir Feisul bin Turki, who had now been released by the Egyptians and who thus regained the Wahabi Amirate, which he held until his death in 1865 During this period the Wahabis re-established themselves m Nejd and Hasa and to a considerable extent regained their influence in Trucial Oman, though from 1853 to 1865 it was less marked than it had been in the past. 1 hey repeatedly conducted aggressions against the Sultan of Muscat but their relations with H.m.

A protest was received from the Resident, who supported his 14. ' representations by a British naval demonstration. Towards the end of 1845 an agreement was reached under which Muscat was to pay a tribute of 5,000 dollars and the Wahabi forces were withdrawn. In 1849 the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, who Bo S p I w i i slI PPP rt i,rom the Sultan of Muscat in his campaign against the XXIV,'218, Wahabis finding that it was unlikely that his hopes would be realised, made peace 228 ' 232 ' with the Wahabis. In March 1850, however, Muscat, in concert with Abu Dhabi 460 ' 493 - ■organised an expedition against the Wahabis. In 1852 the Wahabi Amir sent his son Abdulla on a mission to Trucial Oman with a view to redressing the grievances alleged to be entertained by the Oman Sheikhs against Muscat. Hostilities broke out shortly thereafter between the Wahabis and Muscat, which were concluded at the end of 1853 by an offensive and defensive alliance by which Muscat undertook to pay tribute of 12,000 dollars (with arrears of 60,000 dollars and certain provisions and stores), the Wahabi Amir on his part undertaking to assist the Sultan in every our 01 emergency. It was agreed that the boundaries of both parries should remain unchanged. In December of the same year the Wahabis responded to a demand by Muscat under the terms of the treaty that they should bring the Batineh • tribes, who had refused to pay tribute, back to their allegiance. The Disputes of 1864-66. 66 Towards the end of 1864 the Chief of Rostack in Muscat, whose family had been dispossessed of Sohar in 1840, informed the Sultan of Muscat that he proposed to transfer his allegiance to the Wahabis and to pay them tribute. The Sultan •suggested that the differences which had arisen, should be decided by the PoliticalP.R. to Bo. Resident, but Colonel Pelly reached the conclusion that it was open to question 21.1.65, whether the Wahabi Lieutenant at Baraimi, m the support he had given to the Chief ? &amp; ej 7 d 7 P n7 Cis ' of Rostack, was acting under instructions from the Wahabi Amir. It transpired Lor I 473- that the differences which had arisen had a two-fold aspect: the first the rebellion 4. of the Chief of Rostack ; the second and more important, a demand on the part of the Wahabi Amir for an increased annual tribute from the Sultan, coupled with# a threat of invasion in the event of non-compliance. j 67. In August 1865 the Heni bu Ali and the Jenabah tribes of south-east Muscat, both of them Wahabi by religion, captured Sur, inflicting considerable damage on British Indian subjects. A piotest was at once made to the Wahabi Amir and to his deputy at Baraiini on behalf of the British Government and the Resident was authorised to take, in consultation with the Senior Naval Officer such measuies as they might think likely to promote an arrangement between the 5. of S. to Wahabi Amir and the Sultan. 'He is not, however, to undertake anything G. of I., on land.' ? 811 - 60 - Undertakings seciired from Wahabis, 1866. 68. The Amir defended the action of his Lieutenant on the ground of an agreement alleged to exist between the Wahabi State and the British Government, a statement for which there proved to be no foundation. The discussions which subsequently took place were unfruitful It proved necessary to bombard and destroy the forts of Sur, and to destroy a Wahabi tower at Ajman and certain Wahabi warships which were lying at Qatif; and the anabi Amir, faced with these evidences of a positive British intention to support the Sultan of Muscat and to secure reparation for the injuries which had been inflicted, sent an envoy to Bushire early in 1866, who requested the Resident, on behalf of the Amir, to mediate between the Amir and the British Government, and gave undertakings that no attack would be made upon British subjects residing in territories under the authority of the Amir or upon the territories ' of the Arab tribes in alliance with the British Government, especially of the Kingdom of Muscat, further than in receiving the zakat that has been customary of old.' The overtures made by the Amir were accepted by the Government of India and friendly relations were restored. T he W ahabis in T rucial O man , 1840-1870.

Overtures of the Amir Ahdulla to the TrueiaL Sheikhs, 1842. 70. In February 1842 the Amir Abdalla addressed letters to the Sheikhs of Oman intimating his intention of sending Sa'ad bin Mutlak as his deputy to them and requesting them to afford him every aid and assistance. The originals of these letters (save in the case of Abu Dhabi, where the Sheikh refused to surrender the letter addressed to him) were obtained by the Political Resident, Colonel Robertson, who thereupon formally protested to the Wahabi Amir against his attempt to bj 111 ^ the 1 rucial Sheikhdoms under Wahabi influence, on the ground of the ill-effects which had hitherto resulted 'from the establishment of \Vahabi interests amoug the pirate chieftains, which had led to their chastisement by the British Government. The Amir, in reply, declared his intention of co-operating with the Bntis Government to stamp out piracy and added that he had promulgated tins to the people of Oman, whom he referred to as his subjects. The correspondence dioppe with the overthrow of the Amir Abdulla in May-June of 1842, but it ma ^ e noted that in their published reply to the letters received from the Amir, e Sheikhs of Baraimi claimed a species of connection with the British Goyeinmeii (no doubt based on the encouragement given them in 1839—paragraph 59 a 0 ^ e /| although there was reason to believe that secret letters of a different tenoui a also been despatched to the Amir by the Wahabi partisans among them.^ A,| /.

Towards the end of 1852 the Wahabi Amir despatched his son, Abdulla to Trucial Oman. Abdulla is stated to have come ' in the character of arbiter and redresser of wrongs suffered by his people^ (the Sheikhs) in Oman at the hands of Muscat.' He established himself at Baraimi, supported by an imposing fore, e and called upon all the maritime and inland Sheikhs to attend him. All the maritime Sheikhs responded to this summons with the exception of Debai, who sent Bo Se i. his uncle to represent him, but explained to the Resident that he was opposed to XXIV. 232, the presence of Wababis in Oman. Shargah, anxious to injure Muscat, lent his 359, 496, fullest support to the Wahabis and urged an attack on the Batineh, Abu Dhabi 507, 520. thereupon adopted an opposite couise, intimated that he would not be prepared to co-operate personally in such a policy, and disbanded most of his forces.

The Trucial Sheikhs other than Debai were all at Baraimi, and Ummal Qaiwain, in particular, ' in seeking permission to return to his port for the purpose of meeting the Resident, had some degree of restraint imposed on his actions,' Shar^ah also alleged that he was detained at Baraimi. He was instructed in reply to proceed forthwith to the coast. The Resident informed the Wahabi Commander of his extreme surprise that any circumstances whatever should induce him to prevent the Sheikhs from obeying his call, and a warship was sent tu patrol the Trucial a -f ytt Coast.

The Amir appears at one time (between 1852 and 1856) to have had a representative of his Lor. I, 800. own at Dohah. But Lorimer expresses the opinion that it is probable that this agent was only the local Sheikh, 86. By 1868 the El Thani family had obtained a dominant influence in Qatar. Lor. I, 802.

From 1843 to 1847 the Wahabi Amirs from time to time lent a considerable degree of support to the dispossessed Sheikh Abdulla of Bahrein, and in 1845 the ex-Sheikh unsuccessfully attempted to capture the islands with their assistance. Lor. I, 880. In 1846 the Wahabi Amir was refused permission by the Resident to call in the Irucial Sheikhs of the Arab littoral against Bahrein, a corresponding request by the oneikh of Bahrein to be allowed to enlist the Sheikh of Debai against the Wahabia being equally refused in November of the same year. In August 1847 a treaty peace was concluded between the Wahabi Amir and the ruling Sheikh, under « the ruling Sheikh agreed to pay a tribute of 4,000 dollars a year, while the aaabi Amir agreed to abandon his support of the ex-Sheikh. 88. In 1850-51 the Amir was prevented from taking and possibly subduing Bahrein by the intervention of H.M. Government, and a peace by which Bahrein Lor. 1.1112 agreed to pay tribute was concluded between the Sheikh and the Wahabis in July 'Oi that year. In the following year, the Sheikh proposing to withhold his tributefrom the Wahabi Amir, on the advice of the Resident decided to pay it. I n |gro the Government of Bombay were authorised to afford every obstacle to an attack on Bahrein by the Wahabis (who were now nominally subject to the Turk/h Government). In 1859 a Wahabi attack was again averted by British intervention but the Amir formally asserted his authority over Bahrein, declaring that he w ' himself a vassal of the Sultan of Turkey (see paragraphs 91 and 105 below) • ^ 18(51 it proved necessary to bring pressure to bear on the Sheikh to discontinue blockade of the Wahabi ports which he had instituted, and, later in the same vea to take forcible action for the removal of the Bahreini pretender from Qatar despite the support accorded to him by the Wahabis. Koweit and the Wahabis, 1840-1870. 89. In 1841 the ex-Amir Khalid took refuge in Koweit. In 1863 relations between the Sheikh of Koweit and the then Wahabi Amir were friendly, but no tribute was paid to the Wahabis. In 1866 the Wahabi Amir, ' who maintained an agent at Koweit for political purposes, as his father too had done even so early as 1851.' waa prepared to assist the Sheikh in a quarrel between the latter and the Turks. The Wahabis and Turkey, 1840-1870. Wahabi Tribute to Turkey. 90. In 1862 the Consul-General at Bagdad stated that since the Egyptian invasion of Nejd in 1839-40 'Amir Feisul has remained tributary to the Turkish authorities at Mecca, his tribute being regarded probably as an offering to the head of the religion.' Amir professes to be a Turkish Dependent, 1855. Turkish Claim to Suzerainty, 1862. 91. In 1841 the Porte, having received presents from the puppet Amir Khalid, advanced claims to authority over Kejd and appointed him Wali of Nejd on their behalf. In lcS5I the Amir was understood to pay tribute to the Porte, despite the accredited envoys of the Pasha of Egypt were present in his camp and the Wahabi agent ^at Koweit professedly supported Egyptian interests.' In 1855 (see paragraph 105 below) the Amir stated in terms, in writing, that he was a dependent ol the ! urkish Government and that the dependence of Nejd on Turkey had been made clear to Mehemet Ali in 1839. In 1859, again in writing, he reierrecl to treaties between Nejd and the Porte (paragraph 106 below). In 1862 a luikish protest against the bombardment of Damman in Qatar, on the ground that, a! p w ^hin the territories of 'Feisul Beg the Kaimakam of Nejd,' it was 'part or the hereditary dominions of the Sultan,' was rejected (paragraph 108 below). Wahabi Appeal to Turkey, 1866. -L. In 1800 the Amir sent an envoy to Bagdad complaining of English aggression upon the coast of Nejd and its dependencies, and soliciting Turkish intervention agarnst its lecurrence, and the Turkish Wali raised the matter officially with the . t - 11 /' „ ^cmsul-General, and 'loudly asserted the suzerainty of the Sultan over n e l ' ^ ^ ^ ie . following month the envoy was abruptly dismissed; and the onsul-General conjectured, in the light of further discussion w T ith the Wali, that t le explanation was that the Amir, ' when urged by the authorities of Bussorah to e moie explicit in his communications, not only evaded compliance, but signified us lepuchation oi 1 urkish supremacy by despatching envoys to Bushire to tieat with the Resident, while on the other hand the Ottoman Ministry at onstantmople . . . probably pointed out the inexpediency of extending to more remote tribes and principalities in Arabia that condition of quasi dependence which is tound only too onerous and embarrassing in the case of the Bedouin tribes. . • 9b. Nothing further of importance emerges in regard to the relations between lurkey and the Wahabi Amirs between 1865 and 1870, but thereafter the Turks took immediate advantage of the dissensions which had broken out in the ruling ami y, conquered Hasa in 1871, and re-established themselves in that Province and in Nejd.19 % if 1 0 alfi roys I# ^ eitA; n I he W ahabis and H.M.

Overtures hy Amir Feisal, 1843. 98. At about the same time the Wahabi Amir on his side informed the Resident Bo. Sel. of Ins anxiety for the renewal of the amicable relations which had formerly existed XXIV,' between his father, Turki, and the British Government. An appropriate response 157 - 8 ' 454 - was made to thm communication, and the Amir was also informed that the sole object of the British Government in this quarter was the suppression of plunder ana bloodshed on the seas and the security of all well-disposed inhabitants on the shores of the Gulf. Policy of Government of India and Government of Bombay, 1843-1845. ^ ^ of Bombay, having at about this time suggested doubts as Neid Precis to vvnethei the W ahabi Amir should be allowed to obtain a preponderating influence § 50-2. at Bahrein and over the Arab chiefs who were in treaty relations with H M (government, were informed by the Government of India that it was ' not'at present necessary or expedient to interfere with the proceedings of the Chief.' 100. The Government of Bombay reverted to the subject on 26th August 1844, aud pomted out that in the &lt;; now certain event of the Amir Feisal, the legitimate Wahabi Ruler, extending his authority over the chiefs of Oman, and especially if he endeavoured to eirect this object by sea,' British relations with Oman and the niantime Arab Chiefs might be affected and the resumption of piracv facilitated. 1 hey suggested the possibility of an arrangement with the Amir ratifying and securing existing engagements at sea; 'In other words, that as the' price of orbearance on the part or the British Government this chief should become a party^to its maritime engagements, whereby commercial interests may be secured.' Ihe C-xovernment of India took no action on this suggestion. 10P Early in ^ 1845, consequent on the re-establishment of the Wahabi Agent at Baraimi and his inroads into Muscat, the Bombay Government again consulted the Government of 4 India as to the action to be taken if Muscat asked for British help against the Wahabis. The Government of India replied that if 'the mere G. of I. to establishment of the VV ahabi power in Oman and the reception of the willing 6.5.45. allegiance of the maritime chiefs, whom, on a former occasion, we took under our protection and encouraged to resistance, were to be the only result of the present expedition . . . the Governor-General in Council would see no occasion to modify Nejd Precis, the opinion given in the letter from this office of 7th October 1843, that our § 56 - 3076 f20 interference is not called for.' If, however, the Amir's purposes appeared to b encroach on Muscat, or if ' the result of these proceedings is found detriment ] to our relations with the maritime Arabs and our measures for the suppress' 3 of piracy,' a case for interference would arise, and in such an event it roi 1 }!! be desirable that the Government of Bombay should warn the Amir that o forbearance would be extended no further. Such an expression of the vierS of the British Government would probably be sufficient to cause him to desist from active operation against Muscat. At any rate, a demonstration by sea b the British naval forces would produce the desired effect. If the Governmel of Bombay considered ' that the mere declaration of our views or naval operations alone would in all probability effect what is desired ' they were oi ven discretion to proceed accordingly. Otherwise, they should refer for further instructions to the Government of India. A strong naval demonstration was subsequently made, and forcible remonstrances addressed by the Political Resident both to the Amir and to his Lieutenant at Baraimi resulted in the conclusion of an understanding between Muscat and the Amir. 102. In 1846 the Wahabi Amir was refused permission by the Government of India to borrow aid against Bahrein from Trucial Oman, a corresponding request Lor. I, 881. from Bahrein being likewise refused. Bahrein supported against Wahahis, 1851. Lor. 1,1112. 103. In 1851 the Amir, consequent on British naval intervention, found himself obliged to come to terms with the Sheikh of Bahrein. Muscat supported in Negotiations with Wahahis, 1852. 104. In 1852 the Resident, on Abdulla, son of the Amir, entering Oman, remonstrated sharply with him for detaining at Baraimi the maritime Chiefs at a time when he (the Resident) desired their presence to discuss a renewal of the maritime truce, and negotiations between Muscat and the Wahabis were facilitated by a British naval demonstration along the Arabian coast. Correspondence with Amir, 1855. Nejd Precis, 105. In January 1855 the Resident pointed out to the Imam that the British § 61. Government regarded the Arab tribes on the coast as independent Powers. The Amir's reply is of some importance. He stated that ' being a dependant of the Exalted Turkish Government I hold the confirmation of the Sultan to my con tinuance in authority over all the Arabs. To exemplify this, when Mehemet Ali Pasha , . . deputed his envoy to me, professing to hold me dearer and more cherished than his own sons, to induce me to forward his interests in respect of the coast of Oman and elsewhere within the peninsula of Arabia and to offer no hindrance or opposition ... I replied ' You know that I am a dependant of the Sultan of the Faithful, from whom, if you possess orders to that effect, let me be informed of them. Otherwise this thing is impossible.' Thereupon war broke out between me and him which lasted two years, and intelligence thereof duly reached the Sublime Porte and they (the Sultan's Government) greatly rejoiced and were much pleased with me and my influence and consideration w T ith them increased exceedingly. May God perpetuate their rule and the glory of their state.' ' regard to what you observe, that engagements have existed between the chiefs of the coast ol Oman and the Resident for a period of 30 years, this is well known to me, their object being to guard against the occurrence of irregularities and the harbouring of disorderly characters, nought else. This is an arrangement of which 1 quite approve on the part of Residents—both those who have gone before and those who come after—for there is an understanding between us and the British Government of 100 years' duration for the security of traders and travellers passing on the seas. The coasts of Oman, however, and the territories thereof appertain to the peninsula of Arabia under my control, and acknowledging my authority, further, the people of the districts in the interior of Oman and at the seats of the Bedouin tribes are more powerful than, and have the command over, the inhabitants of the coast and could not be restrained From preying upon and slaughtering them, but that 1 maintain a Lieutenant with a force in Oman, who holds them back from the people of the coast. These last are well assured of his protection ; otherwise, were they abandoned to their fate, they could not subsist. Moreover, when, owing to their negligence, disagreements, too long to be detailed, and bloodshed have¥ 21 arisen between some of the Chiefs of the coasts aforesaid, there was none could check them and restore order and goodwill among them except the Lieutenant in T , ln . T£ t tSs&amp;SSWP ^ *** - Ood h » ^ jlW f Further Correspondence with Amir, 1859. 106. In 1859, the Wahabi Amir threatening to support the Bahreini pretender, Muhammad bm Abdnlla, agamst the de facto chief, the Persian Gulf Squadron was despatched to Bahrein with the result that the Wahabi Governor of Oatif abandoned his designs and begged for pardon. The Amir, however, after justifying his proceedings on the ground that the Sheikh of Bahrein was one of his feudatories whom he had a perfect right to chastise for various misdeeds, strongly protested n L r 8 - agamst British interference and added that ' between the Wahabi Amir and the §63. '''' British Government treaties have been made by the several authorities, authority after authoiuy, and, m accordance with treaties between the Wahabi Amir and the Sultan Abdul Mejid, there are matters which everyone is precluded from meddling with, unless on special grounds.' The Resident replied that the British Government recognised Bahrein as an independent Sheikhdom and was prepared to onpose all foreign agency, including that ot H.H. the Amir, by every means m its power. He added that the Amir s claim to be a dependant of Turkey was inconsistent H ' n .! e P nacle s which were at the same time being committed by his Lieutenant at Qatii on vessels bearing the Turkish flag. Bombardment of Damman, 1861. 107. In June 1861 the Amir was required to eject the Bahreini pretender from Damman m Qatai and was advised to enter into a peaceful convention with the ruling Sheikh No answer having been returned, the Persian Gulf Squadron forcibly compelled the Pretender to flee from Damman in November 1861. The Walial)i garrisons took no steps to molest the Squadron. Turkish Protest and British Reply, 1862. 108. A Turkish protest against the bombardment of Damman—a nlace which . as lying within the territory of ' Feisul Beg, the Kaimakham of Nejd,' '' was part of s 67 ' tbe hereditary dominions of the Sultan '—was received from the Turkish Wail of Bagdad at the end of 1861. The British Consul-General at Bagdad replied that H.M. Government bad hitherto always maintained direct relations with Amir pi HS u-ol! as vnl'i all the chiefs and principalities situated on the shores of the rersian Gull. In the prosecution of our pacific policy in the Gulf, which was well known, we have never acknowledged the authority or jurisdiction of any othei State an authority and jurisdiction, moreover, which assuredly the Porte neither does exercise nor has ever exercised in that quarter.' The Consul-General m reporting the correspondence to the Ambassador at Constantinople, remarked B . isfq 4 0 n g A r 7 bG demed 1 tha . t 1 siuce ^6 Egyptian invasion of Nejd in ow 1839-40 Amir Feisul has remained tributary to the Turkish authorities of Mecca, 1.1.62.' his tribute being regarded probably as an offering to the head of the religion it is certain that the Porte has never exercised any jurisdiction or attempted to extend its authority over that country. ... In point of fact the Porte has not the power o punish or coerce its tributary; not a single Turkish functionary exists in the country, and to judge from my own experience of the duties of the British Resident f CM 1 ?? ' assured that, were the relations of that officer with the Amir or Nejd to be disturbed in a manner to withdraw the Wahabi coast from his immediate supervision, the effect must be highly prejudicial to the policy which has hitherto obtained under the orders and sanction of Her Majesty's Indian Government m that quarter.' Resident authorised to mediate between Muscat and the Wahabis, 1864. 109. Towards the end of 1864, serious difficulties having arisen between the Sultan ot Muscat and the Wahabi Amir consequent on the endeavours ot the vv ahabi Agent at Baraimi to secure a substantial increase in the amount of zakat ^ ^ „ . reauestpd t cat , to f fj 16 ^fbabis, Colonel Pelly, then Political Resident, was ^ 2 dtrec ' s ' requested ^to report fully and to employ his good offices if mediation were of any ,. but , t0 l ' ; ' t t ' !0 Sultan clearly understand that the British Government had no intention of interfering in the differences between the powers on the shores ■ot the 1 ersian Gulf by aiding one party to coerce the other.'1 P.R. to Bo., 14.2.65.

In February 1865 Colonel Felly decided to visit the Wahabi Amir at V capital. This visit is of some importance, as Ibn Sand has tended to surest (\ I recently, in 1911 (paragraph 148 below) and in 19 L3 (paragraph 152 bS that an agreement (in 1911 alleged to have been oral) was reached betwpp Colonel Felly and his ancestor on this occasion. It may, therefore, be recorded that the Resident's visit, though subsequently formally approved by both th Government of Bombay and the Government of India, was undertaken on his 0^ initiative and without any previous reference to or sanction of either Government 1 - and that the Resident had no instructions on the basis of which he could have conducted negotiations. 'Che Despatch reporting that he was proceeding to Riyadh remarks : ' I hope that I shall leave the Wahabi Frovinces on polite terms with Lor. 1,1118- the people, and with the prospect of more friendly relations with the Wahabi 20. ' Government. It is possible, also, 1 may find an opportunity for a casual and friendly office towards smoothing the present differences between the Sultan of Muscat and the Wahabis.' No Agreement concluded with the Amir. 111. Colonel Felly's report on his visit makes it clear that there was no discussion with the Amir regarding the conclusion of any treaty or understanding. Towards the end of the visit, however, the Amir's Secretary (elsewhere described as a 'frivolous and vindictive mongrel') intimated that he (the Secretary) 'was very desirous that I should enter into some treaty whereby the Arabs of Oman, Soor and the Fersian Gulf should be exempted from our slave piracy (sic); and receive from us the same consideration which we had accorded to the Sultan of Zanzibar in entering into a treaty with His Highness confirmatory of the slave trade. The Secretary added that he was empowered by the Amir to offer an exchange treaty binding him to prevent the Arabs of Oman and the Gulf from committing depredations or injuring our telegraph establishments. The manner of the Secretary became somewhat familiar and he stated that, as I was in their capital it would be a convenient time to have a draft of the agreement made. I rebuked his manner ; absolutely refused his request; and gave him his conge.' There is no further reference in the report to the conclusion of any agreement, and no reference was made to the point in the Resident's farewell interview with the Amir, at which, however, the latter expressed a wish that in regard to Qatif and Oqair I would refer to him if piracy or wrecking happened and that he would punish the aggressor to the utmost . . . begged me in like manner to protect his maritime interest on the Fersian coast . . . concluded by expressing a wish that I should write to him . . . and said that his curtness had been owing to his previous relations with the Residency, but that now he would turn over a new leaf and had given instructions accordingly to his Governors on the coasts.' There is nothing to suggest that the Resident concluded any agreement with the Amir, verbally or otherwise, that any understanding or agreement was reached during his visit, or that the visit aimed at, or achieved, any object other than the establishment of friendly personal relations, the dissipation of the view previously apparently held that it was difficult if not impossible for a European to penetrate to Riyadh, and some preliminary exploration of the ground in regard to the differences which had arisen between the Wahabi Amir and the Sultan of Muscat. Suggestions thai Great Britain might assist the Amir in fighting the Turks or other tribes were not encouraged by the Resident. 112. It may be added that among Sir Lewis Felly's private papers in the India. Office there exists a rough private journal of a fragmentary character, whic contains inter alia some notes of his conversations with the Wahabi Amir. Here- likewise there is no reference to or suggestion of any agreement, but the follow'D© notes are of interest : ' Assurance to my interpreter after my departure that e Busbire Desp. to Bo.

The Resident, in reporting the result of his final interview with the envoy, wrote : ' I asked the Wahabi envoys what the Amir meant by stating in his letters that agreements had existed of old between his Government and the British. The envoys replied that the Wahabi Amirs had, from time to time, received friendly letters from the British authorities, and that the Wahabi Government considers a friendly letter to be synonymous with a Treaty Agreement. . . .' 11.6.66. Government of India and Turkish Claims to Suzerainty, 1866. 121. In connection with the Sur disturbances Sir Lewis Pelly appears to have suggested that Turkish interference should be invoked against the Wahabi Amir. The Government of India, on 11th June 1866, recorded the following comments GL of I. to on this proposal. ' . . . The Government of India entirely concurs with the Bo.^ No. 602, Government of Bombay in discountenancing Lt.-Col. Felly's suggestion that the interference of the Turkish Government should be invoked. No good, but much harm, would result from the question of Turkish supremacy over the Wahabi territory being imported into our relations with the latter power. It has always been our policy (see letter from H.B.M. Consul-General at Bagdad to our Ambassador at Constantinople, dated 1st January 1862) [paragraph 108 above], to repudiate the Porte's claim to authority in that quarter ; and the Governor-General in Council is satisfied that any deviation from the principle will give rise to complications mucli to be deprecated.' 122.

Amir Saud and the Turks, 1872-1873. 127. A brief reference may be made to the relations between Saud and the t Turks as bearing on the question of the relation of the Saudi dynasty to the Turkish Neid Precis, power. In 1872 it was reported that the terms of the understanding contemplay §150-6. were to be his recognition as the Chief of Nejd on condition of his paying the Turkish war expenses and the same yearly tnbute as had been paid by the Amir Feisnl There were certain supplementary conditions which are immateriaJ. Both he and the Turks professed their anxiety for a settlement on this basis, but no conclusion was reached. In 1872 a letter from Saud offered to invest the Resident with full power of mediation with the Turks, but the negotiations which succeeded again came to no conclusion. In 1873 Saud, now in a stronger position in Nejd, sent Abdul Rahman, the father of the present Saudi King, to Bagdad, with a view to the reaching of an agreement. Abdul Rahman was treated as a hostage and detained until 1874, but negotiations proved unfruitful. In 1875 Saud died and Abdul Rahman was elected Amir of the kingdom of Riyadh 'by the general consent of the people ' Internecine quarrels between members of the Saudi family continued from 1875 to 1880, but in the latter year it was reported that Abdulla and his nephews (including Abdul Rahman) were living in peace and friendship. The nephews possessed Kharj, Hotah, Harik, Aflaj, &amp;c., and had followers of the Ajman, Murra and Dowasir tribes. Rise of the Ihn Rashid Family. 128. In 1881, however, the Ibn Rashid dynasty, assisted by the divisions among the Saudis, gradually established themselves in control in Nejd, and the Saudis, who in 1879 had been reported to exercise control only in Riyadh and the district round it, sank into obscurity for 20 years. The Ibn Rashid dynasty of Hail had from 1832 occupied the Jebel Shammar and its Sheikhs had paid homage to the , p / , Saudis The homage to the Saudis was gradually abandoned with the decay of Nejd recis, ^ Wahabi State) ail a m 1876 Ibn Rashid is described as ' the greatest prince in Nejd.' In 1888 Ibn Rashid decisively defeated the Saudis and captured Riyadh, and his dynasty remained in complete control in Nejd until 1901. It may be recorded, however, that in 1890-91, on the Saudis regaining Riyadh, both parties \r -ri p.^-« wrote to the Mutasarrif of Hasa, Ibn Rashid to denounce Abdul Rahman as §217. ' C1 ' meditating an attack on Hasa ; Abdul Rahman complaining of Ibn Rashid and Extl. A: professing his obedience to the Turkish authorities, who were disposed to listen Nov. 1890, favourably to him.' The Ibn Rashid family throughout professed allegiance to the Turkish Government, though Turkish influence in their dominions appears to have been of the smallest; and even on the occasion of his capture erf Riyadh m Ibn Rashid posed as the officer or lieutenant of the Ottoman Government.

Projected Visit hy Ihn Saud to Trucial Coast, 1905-1906. 138. Towards the end of 1905 information was received that Ibn Saud had visited Katr (still nominally under Turkish rule) and composed certain tribal disputes there, and that he was meditating a visit to the Trucial Coast and to Muscat. This news had seriously disturbed the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, who had himself been instrumental in the final extinction of Wahabi influence from Baraimi and the Trucial Coast in 1870, and the Sultan of Muscat, both of whom (with the Sheikh of Dabai) belonged to the Hinawi tribe and feared that the arrival of Ibn Saud would be the signal for a combination against them of the remaining Trucial Chiefs who belonged to the Ghafari tribe. Ibn Saud, moreover was reported to have remarked ' By God, I will explore the country belonging to my father and grandfather from Muscat to Jaalan.' Views of Government of India and H.M. Government. 139. The Government of India were seriously disturbed as to the possible effect on our position on the Trucial Coast and in Muscat of a visit by Ibn Saud. H.M. Government in the light of their views decided after consultation with the Ambassador at Constantinople that if Ibn Saud appeared on the coast and failed to give satisfactory assurances as to his intentions, he should be warned that any attempt on his part to interfere in Oman or along the Arab coast, either with the Chiefs or with their subjects, would be regarded as an unfriendly act and that steps would be taken to frustrate it. Before these instructions were received, Sir Percy Cox had conveyed a hint in this sense to Ibn Saud through the Sheikh of Kovveit (who regarded the proposed visit as a mere attempt to blackmail the coastal Chiefs). The visit, probably owing to the unsettled situation in Nejd, was abandoned. It should be recorded that, on the instructions of H.M. Government, the I ruciai Sneikhs were in the same connection warned by the Resident that, on the ground that general unrest prejudicial to British commercial interests on the Coast would inevitably result, the Government of India would not view with complacency the intrigues of any of them with Ibn Saud. Defeat of Ihn Rashid, May 1906. Const, to 140. In May 1906 Ibn Rashid and bis immediate following of 250 were P.O., 292, surprised and annihilated in Qasim by Ibn Saud, and Ibn Saud was reported from 1.5.06. Jedda in June of that year to have declared himself, consequent on his victory, ruler of the whole ' Shark ' (East) and to have sent letters to Constantinople, Basrah, Bagdad, the Hedjaz, and the Sherif of Mecca. Sir Nicholas 0'Conor doubted, however, whether Ibn Saud would be able to cope with the Turks, should he decide to proclaim his independence of the Sultan.' Turkish Alloirances to Ihn Saud. 141. In August 1906 the Consul at Basrah reported that the allowance granted Ko ' it t ^ ^ urks to Ibn Saud was by a recent arrangement paid through the Sheikh of Resdt., Koweit, who deducted it from the land tax on his Fao property. The Sheikh 30.9.06. stated that the allowances paid by the Turks were 90 liras a month to Ibn Saud s father and 200 liras and about 300 tons of rice to Ibn Rashid. In October 1906 Resident at Bagdad reported a statement that Ibn Saud had in the past received £ T.30 a month from Turkey, with 100 suits of clothes and some grain— an allowance now alleged to have been discontinued.29 Withdrawal of Turhs from Qasim, September 1906. 142 Tn September 1906 inconclusive negotiations took place between the n Turiush Commander of Qasim and Ibn Sand, and at the end of that year most p o 824 of the Turkish troops were reported to have been withdrawn from Qasim, a step 27 12 06 «hicn was regarded as a definite success for Ibn Saud, Further Overtures hy Ibn Saud to EM. Government, 1906. 143. As stated above no reply was sent to the overtures made to H.M. Government on behalf of Ibn Saud in 1904. Further indirect approaches having- been made through various channels during 1906 with a view to ascertaining whether H.M. Government would be prepared to give him protection at any rate bv sea 4 to the same extent as it was accorded to the Sheikh of Koweit and other Arab Rulers of the Gulf in the event of his driving the Turks out of Hasa and Nejd the Political Resident m September raised the general question of policy. Major'Cox ^ . said that he was aware that 'it has been a recognised principle of their (H.M. of I. 2181 Government s) policy not to allow themselves to become involved in the tempestuous 16.9.06, politics of Central Arabia,' but expressed the view that it might be unwise to carrv R 1817/06 - aloofness too far. He suggested that an understanding with Ibn Saud would be of advantage in various ways, and that if we had any intention a of establishing some measure of friendly intercourse with the Ruler of Nejd, the present seems kTbe the time for us to do so,' Attitude of H.M. Government, 1906. 144. Loid Morley, then Secretary of State for India, replied, however, that H M Government maintained the view that their interests and influence should be Tel - to ^ confined to the coast, and that no steps should be taken to enter into relations with 9 - 11 - 06 - ^Nejd or to send agents into the interior without his previous sanction. Further Overtures to E.M. Government, 1906. 145. Towards the end of 1906 further indirect overtures on behalf of Ibn Saud were received through the Sheikh of Koweit and the Sheikh of Qatar. The Resident reported that from the statements made by the latter it appeared that the Saud u considers that the oases of Hasa and Katif were alwa\ 7 s the most protitable possessions of his Wahabi ancestors. He is anxious to recover the two districts and he pioposes that a seciet understanding should be arranged between the P R. to G. British Government and himself under which he should be granted British of L ' protection from Turkish assaults by sea in the event of his ever driving the Turks, ^^fo/or unaided, out of his ancestral dominions. In return for this protection the Amir 2 12 06 is willing to bind himself to certain agreements (probably similar to those of the P- 2799/06. Trucial Chiefs) and to accept a Political Officer to reside at his Court. . . . Ibn Saud is determined to make an effort to obtain possession of Hasa and Katif. He proposes, therefore, in the first place, to apply to the Sultan for the Mutasariflik (Governorship) of the districts, and to throw off the Turkish yoke as soon as he considers the moment favourable, after establishing himself. If his application is refused he will invade the districts as soon as he is ready and having captured them will appeal openly to the British Government for protection.' Murder of Mutaad ibn Eashid, January 1907. 146. In January 1907 Mutaad ibn Rashid, the young Amir of Hail, who had p 2660/07 succeeded his father in the Principality of Jabel Sharnmar at Hail in September ' 1906, was murdered by his kinsman Sultan ibn Rashid. Further Consideration of Policy towards Ibn Saud, 1907. 147. On 21st February 1907 the Government of India, in the light of the Resident's reports, again raised the question of the policy to be adopted towards Ibn Saud. They suggested that if the Turks were really likely to disappear from the stage and Ibn Saud to be a power in the land, 'it seemed desirable that this Desp.No .28, Chief should, when a suitable moment arrives, be led to a friendly understanding 21 - 2 - 07 - with us.' But on a review of the various factors in the situation, they expressed the opinion that no immediate response to the advances reported by the Resident was necessary and that the ansAver to Ibn Saud's reiterated enquiries might be that30 H.M. Government, ' while anxious to maintain friendly relations with him so loner as he comports himself in a manner consonant with British interests and o^ engagements with the Arab Sheikhs on the coast, see no necessity under preset conditions for making him any formal promises of protection, which might ev' 1 have the effect of stimulating Turkish opposition to the consolidation of ^ authority.' 1 148. The Ambassador at Constantinople, Sir Nicholas O'Conor, thought that our right policy was ' to intervene as little as possible in the internal affairs of these , No. 17 tribes and let them work out their own destiny as best they can,' to wait on events and to modify our policy if subsequently a closer understanding with Ibn Saud seemed desirable. With this view H.M. Government agreed, and they instructed the Government of India that they saw no reason to modify their earlier policy that British interests and influence in this region should be strictly confined to the coast. If it was quite inevitable to give an answer to Ibn Saud's enquiries the answer should be that as Ibn Saud's proposals involved considerations which it'was impossible for H.M. Government to entertain, no reply was to be expected to them Ihn Rashid is defeated and abandons Qasim, 1907-1908. 149. In October 1907 Ibn Rashid was decisively defeated by Ibn Saud and besieged by him in Boreida ; and in February 1908 Ibn Rashid entered into negotiations with Ibn Saud and abandoned Qasim to him.

Eis ascendency in Nejd. 150. In May 1908 Ibn Saud was asked by the Turkish Wali of Basra to settle certain tribal differences in Hasa in the Arab way. In July of the same year Sultan Ibn Rashid, himself the murderer in April 1906 of Mita'ad Ibn Rashid, was murdered by his brother Saud, who succeeded as Amir and made overtures to Ibn Saud. But by September of that year the Consul at Damascus reported that to ' Abdul Aziz Iba Saud has become practically the undisputed Amir of Nejd, with his ascendancy recognised in Riyadh, Qasim and by all the Bedouin tribes of Nejd. Lven Saud Ibn Rashid himself admits that his Amirate of Hail is only a vassalage under the suzerainty of Ibn Saud.' In the same month Saud Ibn Rashid was overthrown, and the Amirate reverted to a minor under a Regency. But by January 1909 the Ibn Rashid faction had to some extent consolidated themselves. Ibn Saud and the Turks, July 1909. 151. In July 1909 Ibn Saud's agent at Bagdad, in the course of a discussion with the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia, remarked that ' Abdul Aziz had thought of approaching the Sultan with the suggestion that he should fly the .Turkish flag, pay a certain amount of tribute to the Turkish Government, and be recognised as the Governor of the whole of Arabia,' and had actually sent an emissary to take soundings, who had reached Basra, but had returned to Nejd on the news of the Young Turk cou V d'etat of April 1909. Ibn Saud's object and that of many Arabs was Arab independence. If they could not secure this they would prefer the supremacy of a foreign Power to that of the Turks, and the emissary clearly indicated that the Power they had in view was the British Government. First Conversations between Ibn Saud and Captain Shakespear, 1911., ^ 11 ^ le spring of 1911 conversations of much importance, though of a 1^20 4. n ^ holl y informal character, took place between Ibn Saud and Captain Shakespear,. ^ len ^ optical Agent, Koweit. Captain Shakespear was the first European whom ibn baud had met, and close personal relations appear at once to have been established between them. The Amir described his position and his ambitions in gieat detail. The following extracts from Captain Shakespear's Report of the convei sation are of interest as illustrating Ibn Saud's view as to the previous lelations of the Wahabi rulers with the British Government, his own relations with ui key and his attitude to the Trucial Sheikhs : — • .* • After the Egyptians had been expelled from Nejd, his ancestor,, 1 urki-Bin-Abdulla, had re-created most of the original Wahabi dominion,, including Hasa, Katif and most of the Oman coast from Qatar to near Muscat,, . . . and had then made a treaty with the British Government . .

The As Sand have never received anything else from the Turks in the way of subsidies and on His fathers death Abdul Aziz proposes to allow his subsidy to lapse.'

Captain Shakespear bearing, adetail ® d re P ort of h ls discussions, from which the following extracts, Deanng on the matters now under discussion, are relevant; in P 56 ; F a ' I1 ? n S f u(: l' accor ding to Captain Shakespear, stated that ' his power '.J lafjla had increased till he no longer feared any of its Sheikhs or the Sharif was ' moreov e r . in alliance with all of them, excepting only one, viz. : Capt. tee Sharif ox Mecca, who, fearing a second Wahabi invasion of the Heiaz had Shakespear what thev^ad hlmself the Jurks. The As Saud were prepared 3 to hold Arabia Tnd fpir 00 '' 6 ^ ^ V aSt ^ years of tlleir ancient dominion in fs s.W ' Arabia, and felt capable of being able to do so comparatively easily but for the o()7fi32 menace of Turkish aggression only possible from the East by way of Hasa and from the West by Mecca and Medina. To withstand the Turks from both directions they felt was beyond their strength, and to render secure their eastern borders, thus making their full force available for the defence of their western boundaries, was one of the reasons for their desire to evict the lurks from Hasa and Katif. Another most important one was that possession of these ricl# districts, with their ports, and especially Ojair, would furnish a valuable source of revenue. Moreover, the As Saud had other grounds, and just ones, for their claim to Hasa and Katif. One was that these districts formerly belonged to their house; another was that the Turks themselves, in a document given to Abdulla bin Faisal by Nafiz Pasha, the General who commanded Midhat Pasha's expedition to Katif in 1871, had agreed that the area should belong to and be governed by Abdulla and his family. The Amir informed me that this document had only recently come into his possession, and on his return to Riyadh he would send me a copy. Another document of which he had heard, but so far had not succeeded in tracing, was one which purported to be an agreement made by Colonel Sir Lewis Pelly guaranteeing on behalf of the British Government that the As Saud family would be recognised as the Sheikhs of the Katif District. This document, he said, was the result of negotiations after the naval action at Katif and Dammam (in 1865), when four men named Muhammad bin Ma'ana, Abdul Aziz bin Umr, Saleh A1 Widawi and Ibrahim bin Ghanim were sent by Faisal As Saud as his representatives to the Resident. I have no archives with which to test the accuracy of the Amir's assertions, but I find a declaration printed on page 156 of Aitchison's Treaties, Vol. XII, as No. XXVIII, which seems to bear on this transaction. 157. Captain Shakespear in his report stated that while for want of early records he was unaware of the earlier relations of H.M. Government with the As Saud family, ' I am aware, however, that we had frequently to take punitive measures against the Wahabis for interference with the Trucial Chiefs and Bahrein, but in this connection now I am convinced that ' Bin Saud ' would be only too glad'to furnish us with any undertaking we desired for the maintenance of the ' Status quo ' in the future.' J58. Sir Percy Cox, in forwarding this report, remarked: ''As regards Captain Shakespear's references to past history and to certain putative agreements between the British Government and the Wahabi Amir, I think one of the letters to which he refers is probably that addressed by Colonel Pelly to the Amir on 6th January, 1866, in which he alluded to ' Your Highness's Governor of Katif,'* . . .

Neid Precis, §103. Capture of Hasa hy Ihn Saud: May 1913. 159. On 13th May 1913 the Political Resident reported that Ibn Saud had captured Hasa without opposition. On 31st May the Viceroy reported that Sir P. Cox had pointed out that the draft Anglo-Turkish Convention, which had been under consideration since 1911 with a view to regulating relations between Turkey and H.M. Government in the Gulf Area, and which inter alia dealt with Nejd as a Turkish Sanjak, and the expulsion of the Turks from Nejd and Hasa, were somewhat irreconcilable phenomena, and had suggested the possibility of getting the Turks to look the facts in the face and ' with our help to arrange to include in the Convention a satisfactory solution of the problem, the basis being that Ibn Saud should be recognised as autonomous ruler of Nejd under the suzerainty of the Porte, and that we should be accorded the right to accredit an agent to him as one of the maritime rulers and make agreements with him, with the knowledge of the Porte, in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic, slave trade and piracy, and our mission in the Gulf generally.' 160 The Government of India thought it impossible at this late hour to raise the question of the status of Nejd without running the risk of wrecking the negotiations with Turkey—a view accepted by the Foreign Office; and Sir Edward Grey indicated that he thought it ' preferable to await developments. * This letter embodied an ultimatum to the TVahabi Amir in regard to the Sur incident of 1865, and stated: ' Ihis letter will be handed to Your Highness's Governor of Katif. . . . ,1\ A QX i 33 wd Wvt. and to adhere as long as possible to the present policy of H.M. Government, which is to abstain strictly from intervention, direct or indirect, in the affairs of Neid. The general attitude of H.M. Government, which in this matter is based on considerations of iLuropean policy, is to consolidate the power of the Central Government in Asiatic lurkey, and if H.M. Government were to approach the f Ottoman Government, as suggested by Sir P. Cox, with a view to concludino- direct agreements with Ibn Saud as an autonomous ruler, it would give rise to suspicion and might have far-reaching and regrettable effects.' Ihn Saud and the Trucial Area 1913. ^- t ^' • , June the Viceroy reported that Ibn Saud had sent an envoy to P 2449/13 the Residency Agent at fehargah, bearing a letter to him and one for the Sheikh of Dabai, intimating that he had recovered without bloodshed 'the ancestral possessions of his forefathers, namely, Hasa and its dependencies, and had established peace and public security therein.'' Overtures l&gt;y Ihn Saud to H.M. Government, June 1913. 1-62. On 13th June 1913 Ibn Saud wrote to Sir P. Cox informino- him of the conquest of Hasa, and suggesting a friendly understanding. The following p r to G of extract from his letter is of importance because of its reference both to an earlier I-, No. 2048, British treaty with Wahabis and to the ' dependencies ' of Hasa, &amp;c. 4.7.13, 'We heg to address Your Honour in consideration of the previous r - 33441:1 friendship between us and you and of the still earlier treaty belonging' to the time of my grandfather, Faisal—may God forgive him—of the period of which 55 years have elapsed and 55 years still remain to run. I desire to establish the same in the same manner as it existed between you and my ancestors, and this (fact) has prompted me to make this reference. Firstly, I am confident that there will happen nothing to your people to produce causes which may be contrary to friendship and rules. And we have nowadays conquered the countries of our fathers and forefathers (viz.), El Hasa and El Katif, as well as their dependencies. ... I desire to be on the same terms with you as existed between you and my ancestors and I desire that those terms should exist between me and you after them (mv ancestors).' v J 163.

Jul y 1913 Sir P - Cox re P ort ed that an envoy from Ibn Saud ia reached Bahrein en route for Basra with telegrams to Constantinople P. 2763/13. explaining that the Amir s action had been forced on him in the public interest, and that he entertained the utmost loyalty to the Sublime Porte. The Resident urged that H.M. Government should inform Ibn Saud that we should be glad to see him reconciled to the Turks and to assist in promoting such reconciliation. ^-0. to I.O., i i could be informed that we had so replied. This proposal was supported by the Government of India and the India Office; but, the Foreign Office obiecting polVon'o to the suggestion that we should offer to ' assist in promoting such reconciliation ' it was abandoned. A nglo -T urkish C onvention of 29 th J uly 1913. 165. In July 1913, as the result of the negotiations referred to in para. 150 above, a convention between Great Britain and Turkey was initialled under which Turkey : {a) recognised Koweit as an autonomous kaza of the Ottoman Empire and accepted as valid the Sheikh's agreements with H.M. Government- [b) abandoned all its claims and rights in respect of Qatar; H.M. Government undertaking not to allow Bahrein to interfere with the internal affairs of Qatar, to infringe its autonomy, or to annex it;34 (c) agreed that the eastern boundary of the Turkish Sanjak of Nejd should be represented by a line, shown in blue on a map appended to the Convention, running due south from the head of the Gulf opposite Zaknuniyeh Island, which formed part of the said Saniak to th 20th parallel of latitude in the Rub'al Khali. Ihn Saud and Qatar; Apprehensions of the Trucial Sheikhs, July 1913 p. 3082/13. 166. On 1st August the Government of India reported the death on 17th July of the Sheikh of Qatar, and stated that the Political Agent, Bahrein, had Vic. to S. of informed the Resident that while at Katif Ibn Saud had addressed the Sheikh p'solvis Q atar an( ^ demanded the expulsion of the Turkish garrison from A1 Bidaa ' Residency Agent, Trucial Coast, reports that Sheikhs of Debai and Abu Dhabi, who are of the same tribe, have had a conference, and latter who since the Wahabi evacuation has achieved a paramount position in Ba'raimi and neighbourhood, is convinced that Ibn Saud will now turn his activities in that direction. In this fear the two Sheikhs have decided to mobilise their Bedouins in the Sabakhat el Matti {vide page 1200, Persian Gulf Gazetteer) and take the initiative against Ibn Saud. There having been nothing unfriendly in our reply to Ibn Saud, I [Sir P. Cox] should not imaging that he would think it worth while to hostilize us by such action, but of course the state of Oman generally at present offers him a very favourable oppor tunity, if he be so disposed. I am warning Sheikhs of the improbability of such a development, and deterring them from provoking hostilities, but I should be glad to give them, if possible, something reassuring as to the attitude of the British Government towards a possible enterprise of this kind on the part of Ibn Saud.' t S. of S. to Vic., 6.8.13, P. 3157/13. P. 3234/13. British Guarantees to Qatar, 1913. 167. The Resident was instructed in reply that the new Sheikh of Qatar ' and, if necessary, Ibn Saud, should be informed that H.M. Government would allow no outside interference in the peninsula. Latter should clearly understand that if he attempts it, he will be forcibly resisted. Former may be told that he has nothing to fear from Turks.' H.M. Government and Ihn Saud as a Potential Danger in the Trucial Area, 1913. 168. On 7th August the Political Resident telegraphed to the Government inter alia that— ' At any rate for a long time to come the Porte can exercise no control whatever over Ibn Saud and that meanwhile he is in a position to give a varying deal of inconvenience alike in regard to Oman, the Trucial Coast and Katr, which inconvenience an innocuous modus vivendi, arranged if necessary with the knowledge of the Porte, would obviate. It is not a question of any desire to interfere in the politics of Central Arabia. Ibn Saud is now at the coast, and for us it is a question of a new menace to our interests in the Gulf sphere which we need either to sterilise or protect ourselves against.' Views of Government of India, August 1913. 169. The Viceroy on 10th August in a telegram commenting on the general situation, and urging a modification in the policy hitherto adopted by H.M. Government, said that— ' It is clear from his [Ibn Saud's] relations with the Sheikh of Katr and the recent reports as to the apprehensions of the Trucial Chiefs that Ibn Saud is becoming a more and more prominent factor in the politics of the Persian Gulf littoral, and has thus brought himself within the sphere 01 our interests and influence. As long as Ibn Saud confined himself to A1 Hasa he could be ignored with impunity. Such a policy, however, cannot m our opinion safely be pursued now that there is a possibility of his inter ference in El Katr, with the Trucial Chiefs, and possibly in Oman, where the rebellion may give him an opportunity for encroachment on Musca territory Unless we come to some mutual and amicable under fori35 Standing with, the Amir, who has hitherto been friendly disposed to us the probability is that we shall force him to adopt an attitude of permanent hostility, which cannot but react unfavourably on the Chiefs of the littoral We therefore strongly advocate not any definite treaty with the Amir, but a tnendly interchange of views in which we should intimate to him'that we expect im not to interfere with the territories of Chiefs with whom we have treaty or other relations on the Gulf littoral. We see no reason why if this were done with the full knowledge of the Porte, to whom our mtentions could be clearly explained, there should be any risk of offending Turkish susceptibilities or raising their suspicions. We might warn the Trucial Chiefs seriously against any provocative action against the Amir, but instead of assuring them of immunity from him, which is only likely to encourage them to assume a truculent attitude towards him, we might tell thern that our relations with the Amir are such that their fears of aggression on his part are groundless.' Views of H.M. Government, August 1913. 170. H.M. Government on consideration agreed generally with the Govern ment of India, and on the suggestion of the Secretary of State for India Hakki Pasha was also informally told that H.M. Government owing to the death of the bheikh of Qatar and subsequent events must in order to carry out their obligations make Ibn Saud either their friend or their enemy; that they could not afford to make him their enemy; and that they therefore proposed to enter into a friendly exchange of views with him in order to regularise the position—a communication ^ asha received in a friendly spirit and promised to communicate to his Government. 171. In September 1913 Ibn Saud, in reply to the Resident's letter of 9th July vir +o s nf (paiagraph lo3 above), asked for a clearer explanation of the British attitude. S., 5.9,13, bir Percy Cox intimated on 11th September 1913 that it was somewhat difficult P.'3666/13 to give the explanations desired without fuller information as to Ibn Sand's wishes. He suggested a meeting, and added '' Meanwhile, I have my Government's authority to assure you that, pro vided you undertake on your part to abstain from all action calculated to disturb the status quo ov to create unrest, among the Arab Principalities Bre.toG.of whose rulers are m relation with the British Government, including the I., 2796, Principality of Katr, the independence of which under the Government of the late Sheikh Jasim and his successors of the Bin Thani family has been R 4184 / 1:1 recently recognised by the British and Turkish Governments, the British Government will continue to maintain the friendly relations which have been sustained in the past.'

Discussion between A cting Political Resident, Captain Shakespear, and Ibn Saud: l§th December 1913. 174. Endeavours were made to arrange a meeting between the Political Resident and Ibn Saud towards the end of 1913, and on 16th December Manor Trevor and Captain Shakespear met Ibn Saud and had an exhaustive discussion with lum. The following points are taken from a memorandum of the interview which was read over to Ibn Saud and in the terms of which he concurred : 'His family, he said, had been in Nejd from time immemorial and had tor generations ruled over it without interference from outside. He himself I.O. to P.O., 13.8.13. P.O. to l.O., 16.8.13, 37510/13. S. of S. to Vic.. 21.8.13.HiIII III IlliiiiiiinrmTWMn- 36 was an Arab chief, whose views on matters of policy naturally differed from those of European powers. Bedouin tribes are not concerned in weighin? the merits of different governments, as they live as nomads and when oppressed move off to another locality In recent years he had been able to consolidate his authority in Central Arabia and has now taken Hasa and Qatif All he wants is to be left in peace and he sees that the British Government keeps the peace all along the coasts of the Persian Gulf, except^ in this small section of the coast of the Hasa province. If he could get an assurance that the British Government would maintain the maritime peace on this strip of coast and recognise his position as de facto ruler he would be satisfied. If not, he would have to trust in his own sword In the discussion which followed Ibn Saud said he would be glad to co-operate with the British Government in the suppression of piracy and the illicit arms traffic and in the maintenance of the maritime truce and would also agree not to interfere in the politics of Qatar and the Trucial Coast and to admit British subjects and representatives in his territory, provided that the British Government would give him the assurances mentioned above. In fact, he went further than this and said he would be willing to consult the British Government in all matters if he received these assurances. We again repeated that it was quite impossible to give him any such assurance.' In the course of his remarks Ibn Saud pointed out that though he claimed Trucial Oman and Qatar as part of his ancestral dominions and could make his power felt there, he was quite willing to meet the wishes of the British Government in regard to them. He hinted that the only reason which restrained him from overrunning Qatar and possibly Trucial Oman after he had occupied Hasa and Qatif was his desire not to alienate the sympathy of the British Government.' 175. In a separate memorandum the negotiators recorded that Ibn Saud, after the discussion on the subject of arranging a modus vivendi had been con cluded, enquired the policy of the British Government ' in regard to Qatar and the Trucial Oman States. We said that we could not make any definite pronouncement on the subject, but that as a general rule, as far as we were aware, the policy of the Government was one of non-interference in internal matters. In the case of the Trucial Sheikhs we had certain agreements of long standing regarding the maritime truce, the slave trade and arms traffic, to which we held the Sheikhs, but we did not as a rule interfere with their rule on shore. As regards Qatar we translated to him the clause referring to that region in the recent Anglo- Turkish Convention and said that we assumed the British policy there would also be one of non-interference It proved that Ibn Saud's enquiry was due to the possibility that enemies of his might take refuge in some of these States and plot against him, and he enquired what the attitude of Government would be in regard to such cases.' The negotiators were unable to state definitely, but promised to refer the matter to higher authority. ' He was apparently satisfied with this, but urged that the matter was important to him as affecting his authority over the adjacent Bedouin tribes. At any time in order to check the intrigues of such people, it might be necessary for him to take reprisals, and this might involve him with the British Government, which he was anxious to avoid.' The nego tiators recorded that Ibn Saud had also said ' in a more informal manner that he would not interfere in the politics of Qatar and the Trucial Coast States.' Views of Political Resident. 176 Mr. Lorimer, in forwarding this report, suggested the desirability, m the event of a mutual arrangement being reached between H.M. Government and Ibn Saud, of disposing of the question of his relations with the Sheikhs of Qatar and Trucial Oman and that of the control of refugees from his authority who settled under their protection. ' These questions arise from Ibn Saud's own position as an Arab chief and do not concern the Turks. It might be arranged with Ibn Saud, on condition of his not entering the territory of the said Sheikhs without our consent, that we should use our influence to prevent or restrain refugees whose conduct in their chosen places of residence is shown to be injurious to Ibn Saud's legitimate interests.'38 in the eviction of the Turks from Basra, TT.M. Government would be prepared to recognise him as independent Ruler of Nejd and Hasa, and enter into treaty relations with him, and to guarantee him against attack by sea. Ihn Sand's Response. 183. Ibn Sand on the outbreak of war took the field against his rival p i( 9 , . Ibn Eashid, and used his preoccupations in this quarter as an excuse for not 490 ' responding to the Turkish request for active military support against the Allies. It proved impossible to pursue discussions with him as to an understanding on the lines referred to in the preceding paragraph until the end of 1914, when v . . Captain Shakespear, on the instructions of H.M. Government, met and discussed 2 Tin ' the position with him. Ibn Sand intimated that he was entirely on the British P. 43/15. side and that he would commence verbal negotiations on the subject of the offers , ( made him by H.M. Government in the near future. In a letter to the Political p. 697/lo. j^egident of 28th November 1914 he referred to the British promise of recognition of his independence as ' Her recognition of the independence of my Chiefship of all the parts of Nejd, El Hasa and Katif.' Ibn Sand's terms, January 1915. 184. In January 1915 further discussions took place between Ibn Saud and p r to G of Captain Shakespear. The Amir's attitude was that being ultimately dis- l ' 18.1.15, appointed of British intervention on his behalf in April 1914, he was obliged to p' 975/15.' C ome to an understanding with the Turks sufficient to secure his immunity from their aggression. He was now anxious for a signed treaty giving him a solid guarantee of his position under the segis of Great Britain. If the treaty was not soon concluded, force of circumstances might drive him to give some overt demon stration of his intention to side with the Turks. On the other hand, once it was concluded he would use all his resources and influence on our side. He proposed a draft. 185. The following are the portions of the draft submitted by Ibn Saud, which bear on the question of his boundaries and of his abstention from inter ference with the territories of the Arab proteges of H.M. Government ' (1) That the British Government will acknowledge and admit that Nejd, El Hasa, Katif, their surroundings and the ports appertaining to them on the shores of the Persian Gulf are to me and (are) the territory of my fathers and forefathers; that I am the independent ruler of them and after me my sons and their descendants by inheritance; and that the above -mentioned territory is an independent territory in which there is no (right of) inter ference by any Foreign Power; • ' (2) That they (the British Government) will declare its (the territory s) boundaries north, south, east and west, by land and by sea, and that (regarding) the nomads who wander between neighbouring towns, which are either under British protection or (directly) under British Government, it there should arise differences between me and the Chiefs of the said towns and complaints be made in (these) matters, they should be decided according to the ownership of fathers and ancestors ' To P.R., 186. Captain Shakespear, in his letter forwarding this draft, remarked that the addition to our responsibility did not appear heavy. The Turkish menace from the west and north of Nejd, though very real to Ibn Saud, need give us no anxiety; and while we should probably be called upon to act as arbiters som ^ w ^ more frequently than hitherto between Arab Sheikhs along the coast and ibn Saud, this was a duty largely to the advantage of our own interests. 187. Sir Percy Cox saw no special difficulty as regards the clauses referred to in paragraph 185 above, but remarked, as regards protection against externa aggression by land, that, ' apart from the Turks, Central Arabia is practical y inaccessible by land to any power but ours, and I venture to think that we snou incur little risk by giving the desired undertaking, subject to the reservation that aggression be unprovoked.' Views of Government of India.

Its terms are of some interest as showing the extent at the tune of Ibn Saud's tribal claims. The agreement provided 'that Neid a ? tk o \ nter ^ or f rom A1 Kahaf to the valley of Duwasir and all territories ot Ibn baud and the encampments of Matair, Ataiba, Harb, Bani Abdulla Ajman, A1 Morra, A1 Manasir, Bani Hajer, Sabia, A1 Sahul, Qahtauf, and Al JJuwasir, and everybody included among them, are subjects of Ibn Saud.

The Saudi draft of Article I, as set p pTr f ouu in paragraph 189 above, was accepted. It appeared that the reason for the I,' No 36 c baucli version was that Jubail was the locality where Ibn Saud's limits on the 3116 - coast approached those claimed by Koweit, and that for that reason he wished to Aitch.

Govern- No ' '• ment for Koweit in their negotiations with the Turks, Sir Percy Cox saw no ' 06 ~ 8 objection to its acceptance. 3076 LSpecial 7. Aitch. XII, No. iii, pp. 213-4. 193. In the case of Article VI, the Saudi draft, with a very slight verbal modification, was accepted. In its final form it ran as follows :— ' Ibn Saud undertakes, as his fathers did before him, to refrain from all aggression on or interference with the territories of Koweit, Bahrain, and of the Sheikhs of Katr and the Oman coast, who are under the protection of the British Government and who have treaty relations with the said# Government, and the limits of their territories shall be hereafter determined' The words ' other chiefs and tribes ' proposed in the original British draft quoted in paragraph 189 above were omitted in deference to Ibn Sand's state ment that the several chiefs whom we did protect and had relations with were all mentioned, so that the words in question seemed unnecessary. 194. In Article VII, the British draft of which provided that a further detailed treaty should be concluded '' in regard to other matters jointly concerning' the British Government and Jbn Saud, Ibn Saud successfully pressed for the omission of the word ' other.' He pointed out that some of the matters such as boundaries were among those already alluded to in the present treaty, so that there seemed no need to say ' other.' 195. From the above it will be seen that it was H.M. Government who them selves suggested the inclusion in the treaty of a provision for the subsequent determination and definition of the boundaries of the Persian Gulf States, our special relations with which Ibn Saud undertook to respect. Construction of Articles I and 11 of Treaty of 1915. 196. During 1916 Sharif Husain of Mecca wrote to Ibn Saud asking for an alliance and assistance. This overture was reported to Sir Percy Cox by the Amir of Nejd, who expressed mistrust of the Sharif's intentions. As a result, Sir Percy Cox recommended on 8th September 1916 that Ibn Saud should be ' informed definitely that no present or future understanding between us and the Sharif would prejudice our adherence to the terms of Articles I and II of our treaty with him of 26th December 1915.' He was instructed in reply that 'as the policy of encouraging an Arab State or confederation of States was not dead, anything repudiating it should be avoided,' and that ' reference to the treaty should be confined to Article I, as we could not admit that Article II was binding on us against other Arabs.' A verbal assurance on the lines indicated appears to have been given to Ibn Saud by Sir Percy Cox at Koweit on 21st November 1916. 197. The Foreign Office in a memorandum drawn up about this time remarked that the wording of Article I of the treaty in effect 'commits us to arbitrate on the territorial questions at issue between Ibn Saud and King Husain, and in the last resort to impose an effective sanction for our award.' A greement of 1922 with I bn S aud on K oweit B oundaries. 198. In 1922 an agreement was reached with Ibn Saud, who in that year overthrew the Rashid, in regard to the boundaries of Koweit. The agreement referred in terms to the boundaries accepted by H.M. Government for tna principality in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 29th July 1913, but, by agree ment between the two parties, and with the subsequent concurrence of the Snei of Koweit, it varied those boundaries in favour of the Saudi ruler. . S ummary , 1914 to 1922. 199. During this period Ibn Saud in 1915 concluded a» treaty with H.M. Government, in which the latter recognised him as the independent ru e of Nejd, and he undertook not to interfere with the territories of their r proteges. By 1922 he had finally defeated and captured the re P rese1 ^ the Ibn Rashidi family. In the same year he entered into agreements under w ^ he received certain concessions in the Koweiti hinterland, and by wnici boundaries of Koweit, Nejd and Iraq were delimited.41 1922-1934. R epresentations by the S heikh of Q atar , 1921-22. Ihn Saud warned to respect Qatar, 1922. Sheikh of Qatar represented that he was alarmed lest some of his townspeople should become Akhwan and join Ibn Saud, and enquired whether H.M. (government would assist him should he be attacked from the interior. He was informed that H.M. Government were not prepared to promise p ns more than diplomatic assistance should Ibn Saud attack him. Late in 1922 he intimated that, while he did not fear an open attack by Ibn Saud so long; as the latter remained on good terms with H.M. Government, he was seriouslv concerned by the more subtle methods employed, he alleged, by the Nejd authorities to undermine his position. The Resident suggested that a hint might be given to Ibn Saud to k^ep his people in order, but no action was taken on this proposal In November-December 1922 Sir Percy Cox, finding that Ibn Saud proposed to include the whole of the peninsula of Qatar in a concession for oil in the Hasa district which was then under consideration, intimated to him that this could not be accepted and that he had nothing to do with Qatar except to respect it under the terms of his Treaty with us, and insisted on the limitation of his discussions to country west of the longitude of Salwa Bay. Sir P. Cox is stated by Lt.-Colonel H. K. P. Dickson, who was present, to have drawn on a map a line running from Djau-ea-Dukhan to Dohat-as-Salwa, which, he indicated must represent the Eastern boundary of any concession granted by Ibn Saud in respect oi Hasa. Ine Sultan accepted this injunction without argument. The line in n r question, it may be remarked, cuts across the Blue Line, which was never men- Bagdad, to tioned m the discussions.

In June to c o -' 1925 it was reported that the Awamir and the Dam had appealed to the Wahabi 9 - 6 - 26 - Amir of Hasa to protect them from Abu Dhabi, and in the same month it was reported that the Amir had sent an official to collect zakat in the Baraimi oasis, who was generally, but not invariably successful. This official also arrested and hanged a Hasawi refugee in Baraimi and notified the Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi and Debai that the Amir of Hasa had taken the Awamir and Daru tribes, who were fundamentally Muscat subjects, under the protection of the Sultan of'Nejd. Anti-Wahahi combinations in Oman, 1925. iri. 20 -u In July 1 ? 25 ^ a PP eared tliat tlie Sheikhs of the Beni Naim, Beni Khatib and the Beni Kaab had been negotiating with Shargah for mutual assist ance m the event of aggression by the Wahabis, and in August 1925, after a conference between Debai and the Imam of the fanatical Ibadhi tribes of the hinterland of Muscat, it was agreed that the two should support one another against the Wahabis. Further Wahabi activity, 1925-26. 203. In December 1925 a letter received by the Sheikh of Debai from the Amir of Hasa contained a serious threat against the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. In February 1926 the Amir of Hasa appears to have sent police to Shargah in pursuit of a Nejdi criminal. He was not found there and the police proceeded to Ajman and Has al Khaimah. The man escaped detection. It was reported at the same time that Nejdi slavetraders were bringing negroes and war captives to the coastal towns for sale, and that the Trucial Sheikhs were afraid to interfere with them.Pol. Res. to G. of I., 137 S , 30.4.27, P. 3996/27. 42 In March 1926 the Amir of Hasa sent two officials to collect zakat in Dhafra and Baraimi, and in two judicial cases about this time he is stated to have written first to the Kazi of Shargah and secondly to the Sheikh of Debai 'chiding them for not satisfying Nejdi complainants. The Kazi sent his son to Hofuf to express regret.' Views of Political Resident, 1926. 204. The Political Resident expressed the view in 1926 that the region of Dhafra, some 14,000 miles square, which stretches 175 miles from west to east and 80 from north to south, bounded on the north by the Persian Gulf and on the south by the Rub al Khali, belonged, with three smaller coastal tracts to its west historically and de jure to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. The first business of the Wahabis, if they were to establish themselves in Eastern Arabia, must be to absorb this region. East of it they would have little difficulty in procuring the adherence of the people of Baraimi, Haffit and Dhahirah, on account of the antipathy of some for Abu Dhabi and of others for the Ibadhi fanatics of the Muscat hinterland. He added that the kazis in all the chiefships except Abu Dhabi and Debai were actually Nejdis. 205. The Resident stated that the tribal situation was that Abu Dhabi and Debai were wholeheartedly opposed to Ibn Saud, and were followed by the Beni Yas and Manasir of Dhafra, Mijan, Akal, and the Dhawahir of Baraimi. Umm al Qaiwain, the Beni Khatib tribe and the Beni Kaab were inclined to be neutral. Shargah and Ras al Khaimah had a century earlier been bigoted Wahabis. Trucial Oman and the Wahahis, April 1927. 206. A further report by Sir Lionel Haworth in the spring of 1927 confirmed that Debai and Abu Dhabi were opposed to Wahabism and had no desire to come under the sway of Ibn Saud, and stated that Ras al Khaimah and Shargah were closely sympathetic to the Wahabis, and that with them there might be bracketed the lesser chiefs of Ajman and Ummal Qaiwain. ' The latter four chiefs were actually Wahabis some hundred years ago, and are already in private communication with the Wahabi leaders.' Position at Baraimi 1927-34. 207. The oasis of Baraimi was, the Resident reported, occupied by three different sections of Arabs, the Nairn, in close touch with Muscat and with no desire to be absorbed by the Wahabis; the villages belonging to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, partly occupied by the Dhawahir, and equally anti-Wahabi; and the El Shamis, a branch of the Naimi, in close touch with the chiefs of Ras al Khaimah and Shargah and strongly Wahabi in tone. ' The Baraimi section of this tribe have recently paid willing tribute to the Wahabi agent of the Governor of Hasa, who came to Baraimi, and they would encourage the extension of Wahabi power.' Of these sections, the first were the strongest and their chief occupied the fort at Baraimi. It will be seen that the pro-Wahabi element was in a minority and did not in 1927 occupy the fort, and this is of importance in estimating the weight to be attached to the payment of zakat to the Wahabis by Baraimi. 208. Later in the same year, however, the Baraimi Sheikhs, apparently acting under the influence of Ibn Saud's agent, and possibly apprehensive that P.R. to G. of the presence of the Wazir of Muscat, Mr. Bertram Thomas, portended aggressions I.. 181 S., by the Sultan, or that the establishment of a landing ground was likely to be a threat to their independence, refused to allow an R.A.F. party to reconnoitre the oasis. For convenience it may be recorded at this stage that despite this incident, however, no interference with the affairs of the Trucial Sheikhs by Ibn Saud's agent for Baraimi was reported in 1928-1931. In 1932, a cousin of the bheikh of Baraimi having been ambushed by Bedouin consisting of Abu Dhabi subjects and Manasir tribesmen, hostilities broke out between Abu Dhabi, Baraimi and Dibai. Peace was restored after three months' fighting. It may be noted that there appears to have been no interference in this dispute by any representative of Ibn Saud and that the parties fought it out among themselves without any outside interference. There is no record since that date of Saudi 29.5.27, P. 3404/27 P.G. Ad. Reports, 1928-33.J J y 43 interference; and in July 1934 that Ibn Saud had no agent at Barkimi, althou K h Bnshire his zakat gatherers sometimes went as far East as this point, 'where, howevlr De S p they do not press for fixed rates, but take what is given to them.' ' 671 S., The Resident stated that the Awamir and Manasir had for the last four pz ^' ro / • P m d Z fT t0 Ibl 3 , Saa ? ( havin g at a n earlier stage paid it to 34 7 w Abu Dhabi). JNo zakat was paid him by the Trucial Sheikhs. rr K e treaty envisaged hy Article VII of the Treaty of 26th Decembei 191o (para. 194 above) was never, m fact, concluded, nor 'was any supplementary agreement entered into with Ihn Saud on the matters then u ? T^ r discussion, with the exception of the agreement regarding the houudaries of referred t0 ln Paragraph 198. The treaty of 1915 held the field until 1927. The Treaty of Jedda, 1927. ^ t ^ at J e j r '^ ter iengthy negotiations, a fresh treaty was concluded Aitch. Xii with Ibn Saud at Jedda on 20th May. H.M. Government, concerned bv the ^o. vii, ' 5 Ctl -■ Amir of Hasa, to which reference is made in paras. 201-207 pp - 227 - 33 - decided to aim at the embodiment in any new treaty of the provisions of Article VI 21 Tlj y binding Ibn Saud to respect the position of the Arab Sheikhdoms m alliance with H.M. Government, despite the fact that Ibn Saud had since the date of that treaty grown greatly both in strength and in international stature. They accordingly included that Article as Article VI in a new draft treaty, acceptance of which by Ibn Saud their negotiators were to endeavour to secure. ,, J 11 ' Th . e ms tructions to the negotiators remarked that the draft reproduced F.o. Desp the provisions of Article VI of the treaty of 1916 save that no reference is to Jedda, made to the question of determining the limits of the territory mentioned, H.ftt Government have given careful consideration to the question whether 3/ - i6 ' Ibn baud should be invited to refrain from aggression on the Rulers of the .Persian bulf Coast. It appeared to them doubtful whether in practice such an engagement won d effectively deter Ibn Saud if he were determined to absorb some petty neighbouring Arab State. Moreover, H.M. Government did not wish to commit themselves to recognise the extent of Ibn Sand's domains or to protect territories outside those domains, but would have preferred to remain free to take what action they considered necessary in each particular case, havino- regard to the precise nature of their relations with the principality concerned and to other relevant circumstances.' In view, however, of the recent instances of interference by the Amir of Hasa, referred to in paragraphs 201-207 above H .M. Government came to the conclusion that if Ibn Saud were not asked to reassume the obligation imposed upon him by Article VI of the treaty of 1916, e might infer that they would not oppose any interference by him with the integrity of the Rulers in question and would thus be encouraged to extend his mnuence m South-East Arabia. ... If, however, Ibn Saud should finally prove unwilling to agree to reassume the obligation in the new treaty, you should inform Him that H.M. Government hold themselves free to take what action thev consider necessary m particular cases.' 212 Saud raised no objection to the draft Article, subject to the Sir G - siiDstitution of the words 'maintain friendly relations with' for the words Gla - yton to to retram from all aggression or interference with,' and the omission of the p ^/£ 7 ' words or under the protection of the Government of His Britannic Majesty.' Jedda to ins grounds were that the earlier wording was not compatible with his dignity F -0., as an independent Ruler, and more particularly that the term ' interference ' ^'in 2 , 7 ^ seemed to him to be capable of too wide an interpretation. The terms of the 494 / 27 - Article as finally agreed were as follows — His Majesty the King of the Hedjaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies undertakes to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the territories ot Koweit and Bahrain, and with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Maiestv's Government.' - ' d ^ 3076 4 mAnglo -Turkish Conventions of 1913-1914 not communicated to Ihn Sand in 1927. 213. It may be recorded in this connection, as a point of some importance, that Ibn Sand, in connection with the discussions which culminated in the Treaty of Jed da, asked for a statement of the treaty engagements of H.M. Government with the'rulers whose special treaty relations with them he undertook under# Article VI of that treaty to respect. The list of engagements with which he was furnished did not contain the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913-14. Ihn Saud informed that H.M. Govei-nment continue to regard the Blue Line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 as binding on him, 1934. 214. It is unnecessary to examine in any detail the events between the Treaty of Jedda and 1934. Towards the end of 1933 the question of the continental boundaries of Saudi Arabia was raised in an actne toim b\ the application of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to be allowed to negotiate for an oil concession in Qatar on behalf of the Iraq Petroleum Company, and by uncertainties as to the Eastern boundary which had been set by Ibn Saud to the .oil concession lie had ^ranted in respect of Hasa. In connection with this, the Sheikh of Qatar and the United States Government were officially informed in the spring of 1934 that H.M. Government regarded the Blue Line of the 1913 Convention (para. 165 (c) above) as the eastern boundary of Nejd, and as a matter of courtesy the Saudi Government were informed that, enquiry as to the boundary position having been made by the United States Embassy at Angora, a communication in this sense had been made to them. Ibn Saud subsequently intimated that he did not accept the Blue Line as binding upon him, and that he preferred ancestral claims to the territory to the east of it. It is now accepted that the question of his eastern continental boundary is one on which further discussion will be necessary in the near future between him and H.M. Government. VI. —Conclusion. 215. The history of the relations of the Wahabi Amirs with Trucial Oman, Muscat and with the British Government is given in detail above. It may be convenient, in conclusion, briefly to summarise the position and to touch upon certain of the more important general questions bearing on the difficulties which have arisen in connection with the Blue Line and the claims made in that connection by Ibn Saud. I.— G eneral H istorical S urvey. 216. It will be seen that the Wahabi sect originated in Xejd in the early part of the eighteenth century; that by the end of the eighteenth century it had conquered Nejd and Hasa; and that between 1800 and 1818 it established a commanding influence in the hinterland of Trucial Oman, the headquarters o its agent being in forts built by the Wahabis at the oasis of Baraimi—a strategy point of the first importance on the borders of Trucial Oman and the Musca Sultanate. The Wahabi influence came to an end, and Baraimi was lost, witn the defeat of the Wahabis of Nejd and Hasa by the Egyptians and the capture and execution of the Wahabi Amir in 1818. 217. On the revival of Wahabi power in 1824 overtures were again made by the Wahabis to the Trucial authorities. By 1831 those overtures had^ a considerable effect. By 1833 Baraimi had been reoccupied. a n d A , influence appears to have been as powerful in Trucial Oman and its ^ mt€ , r . „ as it had been in the period prior to the defeat of the Wahabis by the iigyp i ^ The Wahabi agent at Baraimi appears to have been maintained there un ^ was driven out by the local tribes about 1838.

He alleged his preoccupations with Ibn Rashid as allegiance tothem^TnTof^f wi th the Turks but did not repudiate his allegiance to them. In 1915 he concluded a treaty with H.M. Government nntW which he undertook to resp«3t their special relations with the Sheikhs of Bahrein Koweit, Qatar, and the Trucial Coast, whose boundaries should thereafter be delimited, and thereafter he co-operated with them. The treatv of 1915 regulated relations between H.M. Government and Ibn Sand until 1927! 223. Throughout this time there were no signs of any importance of Wahabi wXhfv 11 cla 0man or its hinterland. In 1925^26 emissaries from the Wahabi Viceroy of Hasa were reported to have been moving in the hinterland to ave approached the Trucial Sheikhs, to have reached Baraimi and to have collected zakat from the tribes (paragraphs 201 to 207 above). The matter was not regarded as of great moment and no special steps were taken to deal with , the attairs of the hinterland being at that stage of no concern to H M Government. But when the Treaty of Jedda of 1927 replaced the Treaty' of tuLlff 8 Were , !t ke a n u t0 , 1 , ncI, i d ^ in ^ a P rovisi011 that Ibn Saud would respect , territories of the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast which were in special treaty relations with H.M. Government. 1 ih m ' Information accumulating since 1927 goes to suggest that Ibn Saud as tne result ot the general prestige which he has achieved, and his authority with ine tJedoum of Central Arabia, is becoming increasingly a power in the f racial mterland and even as far east as Baraimi. H.M. Government have aaopted the attitude, both in the Persian Gulf and in dealing with the King;, that tne eastern boundary of Nejd is the eastern boundary represented by the Blue -Line ot the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913, and that they cannot acknowledge f 11 ^ authority to the east of that line. This contention is vigorously con- claims ' Ibn partly 0n the basis of what he describes as ' his ancestralII.—P oints of S pecial I nterest, 225. The following are certain of the main points of interest in thig connection :—- (A) Policy of H.M. Government 1800-1934. (B) Extent to which H.M. Government are committed by Treatv enga^pmom v with the Wahabis: 1800-1934. ' ' 8 8 eillis (C) Status of the Tmcial Sheikhs and their relation to the Wahabis - 1800 to 1934. (D) Extent of Wahabi control in the area to the east of Nejd : 1800 to 1934 (E) History and position of Baraimi: 1800 to 1934. (F) Extent to which Ibn Saud and the Wahabi Amirs in the pre-War period were Turkish subjects or vassals. (G) The legal position. (A) Policy of H.M. Government, 1800-1934. 22f). It will be seen that from 1800 to 1920 the policy of H.M Government on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf was consistently to avoid any interference in the affairs of the hinterland. In the early part of this period they were solely concerned to make the seas safe for commerce; to put down piracy; and at a slightly later stage to suppress the slave trade. As time went on and the strategic importance of the Gulf area, particularly from the Indian stand point, became greater, they consolidated their relations with the rulers of Bahrein, Koweit, Qatar, and Muscat, and with the Trucial Sheikhs. 227. Their relations with the Wahabi Amirs in the period 1800 to 1870 were on all fours with their relations with the other rulers of this area. Once the Wahabi Amirs established themselves on the sea coast they became a matter of concern to H.M. Government, who were, however, content to abstain from all interference with their activities in the hinterland save to the extent that these might react on the position of the other maritime rulers of the Trucial area and so lead to piratical outbreaks, the revival of slavery, or the absorption of Muscat or Bahrein. 1 hey had no treaty relations with the Wahabi Amirs, and their com munications with them (apart from formal representations or demands for reparation for injuries committed at their instigation or by their subjects or vassals) were confined to polite exchanges of letters. The one formal engagement given in the period 1800 to 1870 is a unilateral undertaking given on behalf of the Wahabi Amir in 1866 (paragraph 118 above). 228. From 1870 to 1901 H.M. Government pursued their policy of con solidating their position on the littoral. In the period 190rto i913 th(ty repeatedly re t used to involve themselves in liabilities towards Ibn Saud. In 1913 they reached an agreement with Turkey in which the eastern boundaries of l urkish influence in Arabia were delimited. Their endeavours at the outbreak of the Great War to secure the co-operation of Ibn Saud against the Turks were successful, and in 1915 they concluded a treaty with him as an independent ruler, under which he undertook to respect the territories of their Arab allies. 229. Supplementary agreements were concluded with Ibn Saud after the wai to regulate the boundaries of Koweit and Iraq, and the treaty of 1915 was replaced m 1927 by one less favourable to H.M. Government. Since 1925 the gi owing power of Ibn Saud and the reassertion of Persian influence by sea, the development of air communications, the transfer of the air route to India and the East to the Arab littoral of the Gulf, the discovery of oil on that littoral, and the tact that international oil agreements make it difficult to exclude foreign exploitatK)!!, have combined to make it necessary to take a more active interest in the an airs of the 1 rucial Coast, and more difficult to ignore the position in its mteuand ; in the case of Qatar it has been necessary in the interests of securing lat any oil concession granted shall be under British influence to offer the Sheikh guai antees of protection by land; and the importance of setting a limit to ^ ahabi expansion m the hinterland has been held to justify the positive challenge to the position of Ibn Saud represented by the intimation to him that the Blue Line of the 1913 Convention is his Eastern boundary.47 (B) Engagements of H.M. Government with the Wahabis between 1800 and 1930 230. The Treaty of 1915 was the first formal engagement concluded by H M Government with the Wahabis. In 1810 friendly letters were exchanged between the Wahabi Amir and the Government of Bombay (paragraph 26 above). In ♦ 1813, similar letters were exchanged, and again in 1814 (paragraphs 28—30) In 1820 (paragraph 32) reference was made to the existence of an earlier An^lo- Wahabi Treaty^ In 1831 the Wahabis (paragraph 53) expressed a desire for the renewal oi ^ the treaty .... which was made between you, the British and Imam Sand No such treaty could be traced, but a friendly letter was sent in reply to the Wahabis (paragraph 54). In 1843 the Wahabi Amir (paragraph 98) expressed a desire for the renewal of the amicable relations which had existed between his father and the British Government, and a suitable reply was sent. In 1855 (paragraph 105) on the Amir being warned that the British Government regarded the Arab tribes on the coast as independent powers, the Amir referred to an understanding ''between us and the British Government of 100 years^ duration for the security of traders and travellers passing on the seas.' No reference was made in reply to the contention that such an understanding existed In 1850 the Amir (paragraph 106), endeavouring to justify himself for his attacks on the Sheikh of Bahrein, alleged that 'between the Wahabi Amir and the British Government treaties have been made by the several authorities authority after authority,' 1 and referred to his treaties with the Turks The reply sent to him took no notice of this point. 231. In 1865 Colonel Pelly, then Political Resident, visited the Wahabi Amir at Riyadh. It was repeatedly subsequently alleged that some undertaking was then entered into by the Resident with the W^ahabi Amir. There is nothing to support this ^(paragraphs 110-112). Subsequent to the visit, the Amir (paragraph 115), in reply to a protest against the activities of his Lieutenant at Baraimi, alleged that there existed between the Wahabi power and the British Government an agreement originally effected in the time of the late Saud and again ratified in the time of the then ruler. No trace of any such document or agreement could be found, and on the point being raised with the Wahabi envoys by Colonel Pelly they replied (paragraph 120) ' that the Wahabi Amirs had from time to time received friendly letters from the British authorities, and that the Wahabi Government considers a friendly letter to be synonymous with a treaty agreement (1866). On 21st April 1866 a Wahabi representative volunteered the declaration recorded in paragraph 118 above. This was a unilateral declaration. 232. It will be seen that, if the Wahabi declaration of 1866 is left out of account, there is no foundation for any suggestion that any treaty or agreement, whether affecting the Trucial Sheikhdoms or the hinterland, was concluded between the Wahabis and H.M. Government between 1800 and 1870. Nor was any engagement subsequently entered into until the formal treaty of 1915 between H.M. Government and Ibn Saud, now superseded by the later Treaty of Jedda of 1927. No Saudi argument in regard to the Blue Line or the territorial limits of Saudi Arabia can thus be based on any engagement concluded prior to 1915 by H.M. Government. It is, on the other hand, a legitimate argument on the Saudi side, and one which they have not neglected, that no reference was made to the Blue Line in the lengthy discussions which preceded the conclusion of the Treaties of 1915 or 1927, and that the Anglo-Turkish Conventions were not communicated to them on the occasion of the latter treaty; though it is no doubt open to H.M. Government to argue, on the other side, that while as the result of their breach with Turkey they were prepared to ignore the Blue Line, and, as proposed on the initiative of H.M. Government, to agree to a subsequent territorial delimitation, the Blue Line, which was internationally legally binding, must be the starting point of any discussions designed to bring about a modification. (C) Status of the Trucial Sheikhs, and their relation to the Wahabis: 1800 to 1934. 233. H.M. Government, without consultation with or any protest by the Wahabi Amir, in 1806 entered into an agreement with the Jowasimi Sheikh of Ras-al Khaimah-Shargah for the suppression of piracy (paragraph 24 above). In 3076 N1820 (paragraph 34) they entered into a general maritime treaty with f i predecessors of the present Trucial Sheikhs. They have maintained those tJf relations since that date and have supplemented them by engagements, either 2 individual rulers, or with the Trucial Sheikhs generally, regarding slavery . 5 piracy in 1838 (Ajman, Debai, Abu Dhabi, Shargah); 1839 (Ras al Khaimlf 1843 (all Trucial Sheikhs); 1847 (all Trucial Sheikhs); 1853 (all TrucialSheiky 1864 (Shargah, Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Debai, Umm al Qaiwain); 1868 (AbuDW/t and Qatar); 1873 (Shargah, Abu Dhabi). In 1887 they secured ^exclus^ 1 agreements' from the Trucial Sheikhs, which were confirmed and strengthened in 1892, since when control of the foreign relations of these sheikhdoms has rested with H.M. Government. Further undertakings were obtained from the Truciai area in 1902; 1911-12 (pearling and sponge-fishing concessions); 1912 (SharaaL Tamb light-house); 1922 (oil). The treaty of 1820 and all subsequent treaties were entered into with the Trucial Sheikhs as independent States, and H.M. Govern ment, in so far as they have found it necessary to apply forcible pressure to the Sheikhs to ensure their compliance with the engagements accepted under those treaties, have done so without reference to, protest by (save in 1833— paragraph 46 above), or the prior sanction of, any other power. 234. Since 1823 H.M. Government have (paragraph 36) been locally repre sented by a native Agent, with headquarters at Shargah, of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Since 1932 the Trucial Coast has informally been placed under the supervision of the British Political Agent at Bahrein. The history of the period since 1800, as recorded above, illustrates the close contact consistently maintained with the Trucial Coast by the Resident, which inevitably arose from the obligations assumed by the Sheikhs and by H.M. Government under the Maritime Truce of 1820 (paragraph 34), and the subsequent engagements by which it was supplemented. 235. The historical survey above goes to suggest that between 1800 and 1870 the Trucial Sheikhs (but Abu Dhabi to a much less extent than the Jowasimis of Shargah), were for considerable periods under a large, though not consistently an effective, degree of Wahabi influence, if not control. But the important division in the area seems to have been that between the religious factions of the Hinawis (represented by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and the Sultan of Muscat) and the Ghafaris (represented by the Jowasimi Sheikh); the minor Sheikhs of Ajman and Umm al Qaiwain, who normally co-operated with Shargah-Ras al Khaimah, and of Dibai, who normally co-operated with Abu Dhabi, changing sides according as one or other of the two major Sheikhs seemed likely to assume a dominating influence. Wahabi influence declined in this area after 1853 and disappeared altogether, save as a purely religious movement, after 1870. It appears to have revived only in the period subsequent to 1920. The long breaks in the continuity of Wahabi influence in Trucial Oman apart, it can fairly be maintained that the Trucial Sheikhs have throughout, in continental as well as in maritime affairs, been independent political entities, even if some of them were negligible in size, and if most, if not all, were by land responsive to or entirely under the influence at various times of the strongest neighbouring power, whether that power was Muscat or the Wahabi Amirs. It seems difficult in any event for Ibn Saud tobase any substantial claim to suzerainty over these sheikhdoms or their immediate hinterland at this stage, merely on the broken record of Wahabi influence in Trucial Oman during the period between 1800 and 1870, or on its revival in the period subsequent to 1920, at a date when he had by formal treaty engagements undertaken to respect the independence of these States. (D) Extent of Wahdhi control in the area to the east of Nejd from 1800 to 1934. 236. From the historical statement above it will be seen that this has varied very greatly, both in degree and in area, and that there are considerable gaps i its continuity. From 1800 to about 1815 it appears to have been a tairy substantial control, less marked in the case of Abu Dhabi, extending as tar ea as the boundaries of Muscat and largely exercised from Baraimi. The sa ^-, true of the period 1831-33 until 1836, or possibly as late as 1838. ^ rom T' oin to 1853 Wahabi influence is again marked over the same area as before- 1853 to 1869 it underwent a steady decline, and from 1869 until 1 practically non-existent, though the Sheikhs react quickly to the fortunes o48 sss^ *') tlK ' wh , iok ^ir^ 11 relations ®ge4p' 'y of isa is i ^cessarv : h the ^cial Coast k Agent at] '' Wrates i ^ Resident 4), and the 49 ruler of Nejd (cv. paragraphs 138^9, 152, &amp;c.).

The main test of the existence of this influence is the payment of by tribes or rulers, ^o payments are now made by the Trucial Sheikhs who how ever exchange presents with the Amir of Hasa. The local political authorities positively state that this payment is, in fact, a form of danegeld or blackmail and does not connote any political subjection 'The position seems to be that the Trucial Chiefs and the tribes fear vzmoi-u aggression from Ibn Sand and try to placate him, the former by presents of P ' 5U860Ai4 courtesy, and by listening to representations, for example, in cases affecting his nationals and the latter by paying zakat to him.

Baraimi was m the past the only important Wahabi settlement in the irucial area. I he oasis of which it is the centre is well watered, fertile and strategically of great importance, since it commands the approaches into the Sultanate of Muscat. It was captured by the Wahabis in 1800, and from that date to l«b9 was the headquarters of their representative in Eastern Arabia with intervals during which it passed out of Wahabi control from 1818 or slightly earlier, to about 1833; from 1838 to 1845; and in 1848-9. In 1869 it was captured by the Sultan of Muscat, and appears never since to have been reoccupied by the Wahabis. Its forts are at present held by the Beni Naim who appear to be hostile to the Wahabis, though a minority of the tribes who occupy the oasis were reported in 1924 to have paid zakat to the Wahabi tax collectors. It will be seen that there is thus no history of continuous Wahabi occupaUon, and that the oasis has not been under effective Wahabi control since 1 od 9. (F) Extent to which the Wahahi Amirs and Ihn Saud have in the past professed allegiance to Turkey. 239. The Wahabi Amirs were decisively defeated in 1818 by the Egyptians w 6 ! Amir himself executed at Constantinople. On the revival of the Wahabi power in 1824 and for some years afterwards, the then Amir Turki appears to have paid tribute to the Viceroy of Egypt, and to have endeavoured to represent himself to the Viceroy (though not locally in Arabia) as the Viceroy's agent (paragraph 37). They were again decisively defeated by the Egyptians in 1837-39, and the Wahabi Amir taken prisoner to Cairo. He was released by the Egyptians and returned to Nejd in 1842. From 1839 to his death in 1865 it would appear (paragraph 90) that the Wahabi Amir paid tribute to Turkey though, at any rate in the latter part of this period, through the Turkish authorities at Mecca. 240. In 1855 the Wahabi Amir professed (paragraph 91), in writing, to be a Turkish dependant, and stated that he had made it clear to Mehemet^Ali, when the latter approached him in 1837 with a view to securing his co-operation against the tribes of eastern Arabia, that he could do nothing without the approval oi the Sultan. In 1859 the Wahabi Amir, again in writing, referred to treaties w 1 !. e( * ^ t ^ e P ast an d the Sultan of Turkey. In 1866 the Wahabi Amir (paragraph 92) made overtures, apparently almost simultaneously to Ureat Britain and the Turks. But the overtures of his envoy were ultimatelv rejected by the Turkish Wali of Baghdad.'M i Mi] (cp. paras. 145, 152, 164.) 50 241 In 1871 the Turks were called in by the Amir Saud, who subsequently became the head of the Wahabis. The negotiations between the Saudis and the ^ i • .i -4 rv 'U or^-noQ-p or^nci of onf lir frk i i Turks in the 10 years which followed appear consistently to have proceeded the basis that the Wahabi Amirs, in return for Turkish support to enable them to re-establish themselves in Nejd and possibly Hasa, were prepared to accept Turkish suzerainty. In 1890 they professed their obedience to the Turkish# authorities (paragraphs 125, 127, 128). Ibn Rashid, by whom they were finally' iqq« onrl wVin from 1876 to 1901. was the leadinp- rnW in rw 'i F.O. to I.O. 31.8.34. CXULUll^JL X kAJ-M- -- — ^5 — -7 / ' AI ~Ll€Hiy defeated in 1888, and who, from 1876 to 1901, was the leading ruler in Central Arabia, consistently professed allegiance to Turkey. Between 1901 and 1913 Ibn Saud, while continually endeavouring to secure British protection and British assistance against the Turks, on various occasions appears to have submitted to Turkish authority (see in particular paragraphs 136, 137, 150, 151), to have drawn allowances from them for his father or himself (paragraph 141, but see paragraph 152), and to have settled tribal disputes on behalf of Turkey (paragraph 150). In May 1914, abandoning hope of the active assistance of H.M.^ Government, he concluded a treaty as ' Wali and Commandant of Nejd' with the Wali of Basra, 'who was specially empowered by imperial iradeh,' the text of which will be found in Appendix A, and which is only consistent with Ibn Saud's full acceptance of the status of a Turkish subject and official. It may be noted, too, that on the outbreak of the War, Ibn Saud did not repudiate allegiance to Turkey, but gave as an excuse for his failure to lend armed assistance to the Turks that he was engaged in hostilities with Ibn Rashid, while at the beginning of 1915 he hinted to H.M. Government that, failing a satisfactory written understanding with them, it would be necessary for him to make overtures to the Turks. 242. The true position is no doubt that, throughout the whole of this period, the Wahabi Amirs, solely concerned with their own interests, were prepared to give a formal acknowledgment of Turkish suzerainty or to pay a nominal tribute to Turkey if by doing so they could be assured of non-interference by Turkey in their concerns. From one standpoint it would be unreasonable therefore to attach undue importance to the acknowledgments of suzerainty constituted by the series of incidents referred to above. But it is on the other hand open to H.M. Govern ment in any dispute in which they may be concerned with Ibn Saud in which that ruler claims that he and his ancestors have for the last century been the indepen dent rulers of Nejd and Hasa, and that he is not the successor in title of the Turks in those areas, to take advantage of the very frequent and consistent reiterations of Wahabi allegiance to Turkey over almost the whole of the period. (G) The legal position. 243. On the limited issue of the continued validity of the provisions affecting the Blue Line of the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 (paragraph 165) and 1914 (paragraph 179 above), the Foreign Office, at an earlier stage, expressed the view that the Blue Line remained internationally legally binding as against Ibn Saud. On the wider question of what precisely H.M. Government are legally entitled to maintain as against the King in regard to the Blue Line, they have since expressed the interesting and important opinions :— {a) That there is reason to believe that the territory immediately east of the Blue Line, on the assumption that neither H.M. Government nor any Arab State under their protection exercises any authority there, is at present either res nullius or (conceivably) in parts already under the sovereignty of Ibn Saud. (6) That ' while we are perfectly justified to use the Blue Line and the position of Ibn Saud as the successor of Turkey, &amp;c., as much as we can in negotiating with Ibn Saud in order to secure the most ac( J e P' able frontier possible in wording future agreements, I do not thinK we should win before a tribunal deciding the matter on legal principles if the issue was whether the area immediately east of the Blue Line was a part of the territory of the Sheikh of Qatar, a British protecte principality, or, if it was res nullius, whether Ibn Saud was free o acquire territory by occupation or prescription if he could produce evidence of the state of affairs necessary to support such a claim.

Inland on one side, it is bounded by a line of uncertain course which runs from a spot between the contiguous villages of Dibah and Bai'ah on the East coast to Ras Shaam on the West coast, and so divides it from the Ruus-al-Jibal district of the Oman Sultanate to the North; on another by a line even more indeterminate, which leaves the Gulf between Khor Kalba and Murair and after partially crossing the promontory in such a Avay as to exclude the Madadhah and Jau districts to the South, is eventually lost in South Khatam; West of Khatam the inland limit of Trucial Oman is at the commencement of the Ruba al Khali and the Jafarah deserts. Aitch. The existing Trucial Sheikhdoms are Abu Dhabi, Debai, Sharjah, Ajman, Vol. Xll, Umm al Qaiwain, and Ras al Khaimah.

Its political position in 1905 Barainii« was as follows : ' Baraimi is independent, but the influence of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in the district is strong and increasing. The ruins of the fort at Muraijib bear witness to the hereditary connection of his family with Baraimi, and he has recently acquired and is now engaged in developing an estate at Jahali, while Masudi is being formed into a village by his eldest son. Moreover, a regular tribute ... is paid him by the Dhawahir, who are numerically a majority in the Ihaiklidoiiis of f oasis.

II, Lorimer (1905) describes the Manasir as 44 a bedouin tribe of Trucial 0 1162-4. whose headquarters are in Dhafrah. Their general range is from Qatar on? north-east to the Baraimi oasis on the east, and they are found all over Dhafrah but especially in Dhafrah proper and Limah and also in Khatam. A few frequent the neighbourhood of Abu Dhabi town and visit the Baraimi oasis and some are settled in the coast villages of Khan and Jumairah. On the north the tribe are' contact with the Beni Hajir in the neighbourhood of Qatar, and further inland on the west with the Al Murra ; their raiding parties sometimes reach Wadi Faruq On the east their territory marches with that of the Beni Yas, with whom, moreover they are intermingled in Dhafrah, and to the south of them the country is uninhabited, being part of the Rub' al Khali. The Manasir, except those at Khan and Jumairah, are altogether nomadic. Most of them winter in Qatar or its neighbourhood and spend the summer in Liwah, where they have temporary villages of huts and some date groves possessed as tribal joint property. ... The total number of the tribe is about 1,400 souls. . . . The Manasir were formerly subject to the Wahabi Government, and in 1865 were understood to pay a contri bution worth 2,000 dollars a year, chiefly in kind, into the Wahabi treasury. Now they are independent of all control, .but maintain some degree of intercourse with the town of Abu Dhabi and its Sheikh.' Vol. I, p.89. The Admiralty Eandbook of Arabia (May 1916) describes the Manasir as 'a small independent tribe in the ill-known Dhafrah district, bordering on the domain of the Sheikh oi' Abu Dhabi, to whom, if to anyone, they owe a vague allegiance, having for a generation or so been free of tribute to Ibn Saud. They are the last predominantly nomadic tribe towards the south, the Great Desert and the Jafurah Desert enclosing their dira south and west, and the mainly settled and friendly Beni \ as of the r l rucial Coast lying east. North lies the dira of the Al Murra, with whom the Manasir seem to be on better terms than anyone else. In ivinter the whole tribe moves into or near EI Qatar. In summer part of it may be found as far south as the Baraimi oasis in north-west Oman. Mainly pastoral, the x \lanasir possess arable land and summer settlements in Dhafrah (Liwah district) and are much in advance of the Al Murra in civilisation. Both in religious tenets and political connections they pertain to Oman. There seems to be no paramount Mansuri chief. The tribe numbers about 1,500 souls.' T he A l M urra. Lor. II, The Al Murra are described by Lorimer (1905) as a considerable Arab tribe 1239-42. of Eastern Arabia, very notorious for their misdeeds, but otherwise less is known of them than of an}' other tribe of equal size and importance in the same region of Arabia.^ I he Al Murra inhabit the country in the south of the Hasa Sanjak and that adjoining it, but lying beyond its border on the same side. Some are general) to be found in Kharma, near the wells of Zarnuqah. They visit Barr adh Dhahran and their raiders sometimes invest Wadi Faruq. They are the only inhabitants ot the Jafurah Desert, Jabrin is their property. They sometimes visit Qatar in t 6ir peregrinations and they frequent the district of Aqal to a certain extent. A M Al Muna aie among the bedouins who resort annually to Anik in the Qatif oasis and who are regarded as having a permanent connection with the place . • • Lorimer estimates the total number of the tribe at approximately 7,000 ana total fighting strength at 2,000. He adds that ' the Al Murra, when pressed DJ enemies more powerful than themselves ordinarily take refuge in the imp^netra55 Jafurah Desert. But in 1902 the Turks, after the Oqair outrage [when the Al Murra cut up a Turkish foice neai Oc[aii Port], succeeded m surprising a large body of them at the wells ot Zainuqah in Ivharma and inflicted on them a sanguinary defeat. The Amirs of the Wahabis sent frequent expeditions against the Al Murra, but one only, led by the Amir .Feisal, was partially successful.' His force, however, reached the scene of action in such a feeble state owing to want of water, that he was obliged to be satisfied with a nominal arrangement, and returned to Nejd vanquished rather than victorious. In connection with the postal service in the Hasa Sanjak the Turks pay small subsidies to the chief Sheikh of the Al Murra. But these do not avail to secure the good behaviour of the tribe, nor can any revenue be realised from them by the Ottoman Government. About 1865 the Al Murra were paying the value of 3,000 dollars as revenue to the Wahabi Amir, and during the recent conflict in Central Arabia they supported the Wahabi cause, but they are not at present tributaries of Ibn Saud.' The Admiralty Handbook of Arabia (May 1916) describes the Al Murra as Yol. I, a savage and ill-kuown tribe, wholly nomadic, who range from the south of Hasa 88-89.' into the Jafurah Desert and down to the wild oasis of Jabrin. ... On the north they come up to near Oqair, while inland they lie south of the Hofuf-Riyadh routes, which they harry, as far as the borders of Kharj. In most of this inhospitable tract they wander alone and neither the Turks nor the Ibn Sauds, whose feudatories they nominally are, have ever been able to follow them far enough to subdue them. . . . They are said to number about 7,000 souls and to turn out 2,000 fighting men. . . . The whole tribe . . . maintains perpetual feud with the Aiman and the Eeni Khalid.' /IcrtTK C(YPV.

Article 3 of the Ireaty of Commerce between His Highness the Imam of Muscat and the King of the French of November 1844, which is still in force, provides inter alia that ' the French shall be at liberty to purchase, sell, or rent land, houses, or warehouses in the dominions of . . . Muscat.' The Anglo-French Declaration of 1862. 7. The Anglo-French Declaration of 10th March 1862 places on record that Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and His Majesty the Emperor of the French, taking into consideration the importance of maintaining the independence of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and of His Highness the Sultan of Zanzibar, have thought it right to engage reciprocally to respect the independence of these sovereigns. 3227 75 11.34P. 1717/99.

The Declaration arose out of discussions which had reference primarily to the position of Zanzibar. Sultan Saiyid Said, who had ruled over both Muscat and Zanzibar, died in 1856 He had been anxious that his elder son, who had acted as his deputy in Muscat, should succeed to the rulership of Oman, and his younger son to the rulership of Zanzibar. Serious differences arose between the 'sons, 1 as the elder in virtue of his succession to Muscat also claimed feudal suzerainty over Zanzibar. These difficulties were finally composed by the inter vention of Lord Canning, then Viceroy of India, who, in an arbitral Award of 2nd April 1861, decided that Zanzibar should be independent of Muscat and should pass to the younger son of Saiyid Said, but that it should pay to Muscat an annual subsidy of 40,000 crowns. 9. As both ELM. Government and France had on the date of the Award separate treaties with the Sultan of Muscat, it was apparently considered necessary that France as well as H.M. Government should recognise the separate independence of the two States. (It is noteworthy, however, that this does not appear to have been thought necessary in the case of the United States of America, which had been in treaty relations with Muscat since 1833.) But the immediate c^use of the Anglo-French Declaration of 18()2 appears to have been the erection by the French of a large barrack at Zanzibar for occupation as a mission house and hospital. The building could easily be occupied by troops, in which case it would dominate the town, and H.M. Ambassador in Paris was accordingly instructed to make enquiries on the subject of the French Government. M. de Thouvenel in reply gave satisfactory explanations and added that the Emperor of the French was ready to enter into a reciprocal engagement to guarantee the independence of the Sultan of Zanzibar. In the light of this intimation the Anglo-French Declaration, under which both parties recognised the independence of Muscat and of Zanzibar, was prepared and signed at Paris on 10th March 1862. Despite the paramount importance of Indian interests in Muscat, no prior reference was made to the Government of India, who first learnt that the Declaration had been concluded in 1871. British Treaty of Commerce of 19£/i March 1891. 10. The Treaty of Commerce of 1839 referred to in paragraph 5 above, was replaced in 1891 by a revised treaty between Great Britain and Muscat (signed on 19th March 1891 and ratified in 1892), which is still in force. Article 4 of the Treaty of 1891 provides inter alia that each of the High Contracting Parties 'shall allow the subjects of the other to enter all ports, creeks and rivers with their vessels and cargoes . . . and ... to hire, purchase and possess houses, warehouses, shops, stores and lands' in each other's dominions. Exclusive Agreement of 20th March 1891 between Great Britain and Muscat. 11. The Exclusive Agreement of 20th March 1891 recorded that the Sultan of Muscat and Oman ' does pledge and bind himself, his heirs and successors never to cede, to sell, to mortgage or otherwise give for occupation, save to the British Government, the dominions of Muscat and Oman or any of their Dependencies, This agreement (which may be regarded as being inconsistent with the terms of the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862) has never been officially communicated to the French Government by H.M. Government. When it was communicated by the Sultan to the French Vice-Consul at Muscat in 1899 (see paragraph 31 below) the Vice-Consul replied in writing that he could not recognise it as it was contrary to the Declaration of 1862. Relations of Muscat with France and Great Britain, 1770-1934. 12. Before proceeding to consider the importance in the present connection of the engagements referred to above, and the interpretation which has been placed on the Declaration of 1862 in correspondence between the British and the Irene Governments, it may be convenient to refer very briefly to the relations of France and of Great Britain with Muscat in the period from about 1770 to the present time.Muscat and France, 1770-1934. 1770-189], certain!^none oTanyLportnce 0 ) MlSlr 't ^ (and ^itl^tb^^'ul'rs'of ^Al'nso 6 '?estebSlS 428,'430, 16 ' with the rulus ol .Muscat through the French Agents at Baghdad and in the 462 ' 468 - ManrUms. Jhose lelations were temporarily interrupted in 1781, but were renewed in 78o. Kelations remained generally friendly up to 1798 in which vear bl,ltim entered an agreement with Great Britain under which he undertook to co-operate with her against Pranoe. Overtures made by the French Governmpnt in 1799 were rejected, and the Sultan in 1803 declined toCeive a FrenchTS or a French Consul who had been appointed to Muscat by Napoleon. In 180? however, a treaty was concluded between Muscat and the French Captain-General at Mauritius. A revised reaty was substituted in 1808 and a French Consular Agent sent to reside at Muscat, where he remained until 1810. French influence, now for a short time predominant m Muscat, disappeared with the capture of Mauritius and !Tr 0 u f 'i' 1111 I 11 . From 1815 onwards relations were again re- estabhs e . . commercial convention finally came into existence and (after prior reference by the Sultan to H.M. Government) a regular Commercial Treaty was concluded with France in 1844 No Irench representative was, however, accepted in Muscat up to the death of Saiyid Said in 1856, and while the French authorities in Mamitms appear to have attached importance to maintaining the connection ot France with the bultanate, those relations were of no special significance. 14. There were no developments of importance between 1844 and the conclusion of the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862, which was, of course, concluded without reference to Muscat, nor did the French Government show any si£&gt;-ns of oreater interest m Muscat between 186^ and 1891 In 1874 a French Vice-Consnl appears Muscat Pre- to have been appointed to Muscat (under the terms of the French Treaty of 1844), cis, § 205, but the appointment never took effect. Tn 1881 a British subject (who w r as already foot:note - acting as Consul for the United States of America) was appointed to act as French Lor ' I ' 525 ' Consul, but the period for which he held this post is not clear. 1891-1899. 15. hxom 1891 onwards there is a marked increase in French interest in Oman. At about this peiiod 1 ranee and Russia had entered into a combination for the r t ^4,7 purpose of diminishing British influence in the Persian Gulf and of promoting a ' ' joint policy of their own in that region. In Oman the task of opposino- British interests devolved on France. In 1891 the French Government protested 1 without foundation) that the rule of succession to the Sultanate of Oman had recently been altered under the advice of the Government of India. In 1893 an undertaking was given in the French Chamber that a Vice-Consul should be established at Muscat, and unsuccessful endeavours were made by a French subject to obtain a site for a coal shed at Sur. 16. In 1894 a French Vice-Consul w^as appointed and took up his post. Between 1894 and 1899 no effort was spared to increase French prestige in Muscat at the expense of H.M. Government. In J 895 a French war vessel reached Muscat only a few days too late to assist the Sultan in dealing with insurgents against his authority. In 1896 France protested against assistance given by H.M. Government to the Sultan to re-establish his authority in Dhofar, on the grounds that it was contrary to the Declaration of 1862. In 1897 they themselves offered the services of a French war vessel, which were,, however, declined, to suppress the Dhofar rebellion ; and in 1898 they acquired, without prior reference to H.M. Government, a site for a coaling shed in Muscat territory. The difficult situation which resulted is described in more detail in the note on the Bunder Gisseh incident in paragraphs 30 to 36 below. Suffice it to say that after considerable diplomatic discussion and as the result of the delivery of an ultimatum to the Sultan by H.M. Government, the Sultan in 1899 cancelled the lease and agreement was reached between the British and French Governments on the basis of the division between France and H.M. Government, with the Sultan's approval, of an area which had since 1874 been occupied by British coaling sheds. The French Flag Question, 1899-1905. 17. Since a period prior even to the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862 the French had been in the habit of granting the protection of their flag to Muscat vessels—a practice which gave rise to very considerable difficulty owing to the fact th vessels so protected engaged freely in the slave trade and the arms traffic and th t they were immune from search by British vessels. In 1898 the Sultan, in connectio with the arms traffic, gave wide rights of search to the British Government over aS vessels belonging to his State and no protest was made by the French. The situation, however, became increasingly serious with an increase in the number of vessels flying the French flag. In 1899 the Sultan notified the French Consul that he could not recognise French jurisdiction over Muscat subjects flying the Freuch flag. In 1902 H.M. Government formally protested through the Political Agent against the exercise of French jurisdiction over flag holders as a breach of thp Declaration of 1862. Decision of Hague Tribunal in the Muscat Dhows Arbitration, 1905. 18. The questions of the scope of the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862 in relation to the issue of papers by France to subjects of the Sultan authorising them to fly the French flag, and the effect of the holding of such papers by Muscat subjects on the Sultan's jurisdiction were ultimately referred to the Hague Court in 1905 by agreement between the French and British Governments. The Hague Tribunal on Sth August 1905 ruled that while prior to the ratification of the Cmd. 2736. Brussels Act of 1890 by France on the 2nd January 1892 the French Governmeut had been at liberty to authorise Muscat vessels to fly the French flag, they had ceased so to be entitled as from that date, save when the owner or fitter out of the ship could establish that he had been considered and treated by France as a protege prior to 1863 (a date chosen as one at which, in virtue of legislation by the Ottoman Court and of the Franco-Moroccan Treaty of that year, the creation of new proteges was regulated and limited) ; that in these circumstances the right should not be given in any future cases, although owners of vessels which, prior to 1892, had been authorised to fly the French flag should retain this authorisation so long as it was renewed by France to the grantee, but that the authorisation could not be transferred to another vessel or owner, and that the flying of the French flag under such authorisation conferred no rights on Muscat subjects as against the Sultan. 1905-1934. 19. Between 1904 and 1912 the most important matter affecting French interests in Muscat (where France continued to endeavour to maintain her special position) arose out of the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf. The arms traffic was, up to his death in 1907, conducted by a French citizen, M. Goguyer, who lived in Muscat. Substantial FVench manufacturing firms were closely interested in it; and, it being essential from the point of view of H.M. Government that an effective check should be placed upon the trade, a question of great political difficulty arose. The French declined various proposals made to them under which, in return for important territorial concessions elsewhere by H.M. Govern ment, France would abrogate her rights under her Commercial Treaty of 1844 with Muscat and the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862, thereby leaving H.M. Government liberty of action in the Sultanate. The question was finally settled in 1912 independently of the French authorities by the issue of a proclamation by the Sultan prohibiting the arms traffic. H.M Government in return gave certain compensation and guarantees to His Highness, including a guarantee of the support necessary to dispose of objections that might be raised by F'rance or other Powers. 20. Great difficulty arose with France consequent on this settlement of the arms traffic question, and it was only after long and difficult negotiations that in P.G. 13, the early part of 1914 the French Government agreed to recognise the regulations p. 46, §16. which had been put in force at Muscat and the right of the Sultan to amend those regulations with the concurrence of H.M. Government. H.M. Government in return paid £64,495 as compensation to the interested FVench firms. 21. In 1913, on the accession of Sultan Taimur, the French Government, who had suggested that the two Governments should simultaneously recognise the new ruler, were informed that while H.M. Government, as they had already indicated, adhered to the Declaration of 1862, they had, in accordance with their usual practice, already taken steps to recognise the de facto ruler—more especially as they under stood that the French Consul at Muscat only awaited the receipt of instructions by his British colleague to accord official recognition on behalf of France. No protest was received from the French authorities.^ &gt;h. &gt; f aipr 22. Between 1913 and the present day French interest in Muscat has steadily declined, and since tiie W ar it has been of negligible importance In the course of the Peace negotiations of 1919 the question of securing the abrogation of the Commercial Treaty ot 1844 and a free hand for Great Britain in Muscat was under consideration, but (toes not appear to have been pursued. The French coal depot in Muscat was relinquished in 1920; the number of Muscat dhows flyW the French flag had m that year fallen to seven, of which five only belonged to Muscat subjects, and it is impiobable that any Muscatis are at the present time entitled to fly the French fiag. ihe Consulate has now been closed for many years thouo-h recently 10 secure rrencn concurrence m certain modifications proposed m me Muscat tariff) and to a visit to Muscat and its waters by a French sloop which usually takes place annually. ' ' British Connection with Muscat, 1770 to 1934. 23. The British connection with Muscat dates from the early seventeenth century The first formal treaty between H.M. Government and Muscat, under which Muscat undertook to co-operate with Great Britain against the French, was signed in 1798 That treaty has, since the beginning of the nineteenth century, been supple mented by a laige numbei ot engagements. Of these the most important are the Treaty of Commerce of 1839, which has since been replaced by the Treaty of Commerce of 1891, and the Exclusive Agreement of 1891, to which reference is made in paragraph 3 above. In addition, Muscat has contracted engagements with H.M. Government in regard to the suppression of the slave trade, the arms traffic, piracy, the grant of concessions for oil and coal, the making of air regulations;' and she has conceded exclusive jurisdiction over British subjects (including British protected persons) and the subjects of Indian States to H.M. Government. ' &gt; ^4. It is not unfair to say that through much of this period the continued existence of Muscat lias been possible only because of the moral, financial and, occasionally, the military or naval assistance lent her by the Government of India and H.M. Government. But lor these she might have succumbed to the Wahabis at various periods between 1800 and 1870 ; she would have found difficulty in retaining her control in Dhofar in 1896-97 ; and the ruling house might well have been driven into the sea by the tribal rebellion of 1895 or by the fanatical Imam of the hinterland and his Ibadhi followers between 1914 and 1922. Since 1873, moreover, when Zanzibar ceased to make the annual payment due to Muscat under the Canning Award to which reference is made in paragraph 8 above, the payment, now known as the Zanzibar Subsidy, and amounting to Rs. 86,400,' has been made annually by the Government of India. From 1913 to the present day an annual subsidy of I lakh of rupees (the discontinuance of which has recently been under consideration) has in addition been paid to successive Sultans by the Government of India in recognition of their co-operation in the putting down of the arms traffic. 25. The interest of H.M. Government in Muscat has thus throughout the period under consideration been substantial and of vital practical importance to the continued existence of Muscat as an independent State. It is in marked contrast with the interest taken in Muscat by the French Government, which may not unfairly be described as having been actuated largely by political motives which were not directly related to the special interests of Muscat; and which in more recent times appears to have been based on the desire of the French Government to assert itself in a region in which British interests have long been predominant, or to use the nuisance value of the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862 to secure concessions in other areas of the international field from H.M. Government. The Angflo-French Declaration of 1862 : its importance in Muscat Policy, and the Interpretations which have been placed on it. 26. The leading case on the interpretation of the Declaration of 1862 is the so-called Bunder Gisseh incident of 1899. But before dealing in greater detail with the discussions to which that incident gave rise, it may be placed on record that the existence of the Declaration has for many years bulked largely in British policy in this area. The circumstances in which the Declaration was concluded are described in paragraphs 8-9 above ; it will be seen that it was made without 3227 BG prior consultation with the Government of India and that it had regard pri '] to a possible French challenge to Zanzibar ; and it seems not unfair to suggesUh t no special consideration was given to the embarrassing consequences to whi •} &gt; might give rise in Muscat. c ^ 27. In 1890 an India Office proposal for the establishment of a protectorate Muscat was rejected by the Foreign Office partly because of the existence of 0 ^ Declaration; in 1891 a French protest, based on the Declaration, was received S. of S. to against alleged British activities. In 1894^ the Sultan was advised to plead the G. of I. terms of the Declaration should France claim to grant protection to French flaw rno^' llolders wl10 were Muscat subjects ; in 1895 the proposal for the establishment of g a protectorate was revived by the Government of India, who thought that it might be possible to obtain French consent in connection with the arrangements then contem- S of S. to plated in regard to Madagascar, but H.M. Government considered that there was no G. of 1. tel. prospect of this. In 189(3 the French were officially informed of assistance proposed 28.3.96. to gj ven t0 Sultan to maintain himself in Dhofar, and were assured that the action proposed in support of His Highness implied no intention of establishing any protectorate over Muscat. The assistance in question was, however, followed in May 1896 by a protest by the French Ambassador against unilateral action of this nature, in reply to which the Foreign Secretary assured him that there was no intention 'of establishing any protectorate over Muscat or any departure from the F.O. to engagements undertaken in the Declaration of 10th March }86&gt;J.' Fn 1897 the Paris, grant of armed assistance to the Sultan in Dhofar was again approved by H.M. Government, but with a specific warning by the Secretary of State for India 10.2.97. to the Political Resident of the importance of bearing in mind the Declaration of S. of S. to 1862. In 1898 a proposal for assisting the Sultan by taking control of his Customs 18 298 tel was re j ecte d by Il.M. Government on the ground that actual and direct control of the Muscat Customs by the Government of India would be in conflict with the independence of the Sultan secured by the Declaration of 1862. In the Bunder Gisseh incident of 1899 H.M. Government took their stand on the Declaration as against the French Government (see paragraphs 33-35 below). Law Officers' Opinion of February 1899, 28. In February 1899, the Law Officers of the Crown advised as follows :— ' (I ) The Declaration of 1862 does not in our opinion require the British Government to abstain from exercising a preponderating influence in Muscat, so long as that influence is not exerted in any way inconsistent B/122/99. with the independence of Muscat. For instance, the [Zanzibar] Subsidy and the terms on which it was made payable involved no breach of the Declaration. '(2) We think that the British Government would be justified in punishing or even deposing a particular Sultan who broke his engagements with the British Government. The undertaking contained in the Declaration is an engagement to respect the independence of the Sovereigns of Muscat as representing the country, and does not carry with it an inability to punish any particular Sovereign for breaches of treaty or of international law. For this the consent of France is not necessary. But it would be a breach of the Declaration if after deposing a particular Sultan a successor were set up who was not independent. ' We should add that whilst the question whether the Sultan could consistently with the Declaration be required to dismiss a particular adviser must depend on the special circumstances of the case, it is hardly compatible with the independence of Muscat that the Sultan should be compelled to accept Ministers and advisers who are acceptable to the British Government.' 29. In the discussions over the Hying of the French flag by Muscat dhows which culminated in the reference of 1905 to the Hague Court (paragraph 18 above), H.M. Government again took their stand on the Declaration and contended that the I 1 rench claim to j urisdiction over Muscat dhows or subjects flying the French flag was inconsistent with its terms—a view in substance accepted by the Hague Court, frequent reference was also made to the existence of the Declaration in the dis cussions which took place between 1904 and 1912 about the suppression of the arms traffic, but the ellorts of H.M. Government to secure its abrogation were unsuccessful. In 1929, when the air route to India along the Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf wasf X 'VrrCoLS^Snal/^^ 60 '' 6 ?- inter ^ e P art ™entalIy. after consultation G of I tel with the Orover t ot indid, that exception could not reasonably be taken by the 449 S.' FTench under the terms of the Declaration to the establishment of a station for the 31.1.29, civil air route m Muscat territory. It seemed probable, however that a protest p - 1022 / 29 - would be justified in the event of strategic aerodromes being established in the r 0 i r T to ownership of H.M. government m that territory ; and the Government of India, after consuhation witli the 1 olitical Resident, agreed that the best solution would P. 2556/29. probably be that the necessary lauding grounds should be provided bv the Snltan of l - teL the expenses of equipment and maintenance being met by H.M. Government fees or a regular rent for the, r use being charged by the Sultan, the British flag not p 4270/29 being hoisted and defence arrangements so far as possible being carried out bv the Muscat authouties, m leturn, it' necessary, tor some financial consideration. The Bunder Gisseh Incident of 1899. Grant to France by the Sultan of a Coaling Station. 30. The history of the Bunder Gisseh incident of 181)9 is as follows. In the early part of 1899 a French war vessel visiting Muscat (at which, as stated in paragraph 16 above, France was then represented by a Vice-Consnl) secured from p ol Ees to the Sultan of Muscat an undertaking to grant a coaling station to the French S oft T 8, Government. 1 he terms of the agreement, which was dated 7th March 1898 1^2.99. were as follows : Be it known to all that we have given to the French Government ?: of h a place for coal on the coast at a distance from dwelling houses where it would not . aX ' hurt them, outside Muscat, a piece of land about the size of a godown in one of the P 345/99 coves dependent on Muscat as a mark of favour and respect to the great French Government on account of the friendship and concord.' It will be seen that this agreement, which is in quite general terms and does not specify the location of the coal depot, makes no leference to fortifications or to the flying of a flag. Cancellation of the Grant consequent on pressure from H.M. Government. 31. On the news that this concession had been granted becoming public propei ty, the Sultan was at once called on for an explanation of his action in granting a coal depot to the French in violation of his Agreement with Great Britain of 1891 (paragiaph II above). His Highness replied that he had merely given the French as a sign of friendship, coaling facilities similar to those already enjoyed by H.M. Government (see paragraphs 39-40 below) and declined to communicate the text of the concession. Strong further pressure was brought to bear on the Sultan. On 10th Itebruary 1899 he informed the French Vice-Oonsul that he was being pressed by H.M. Government to withdraw the grant as being a violation of the Agreement of 1891. Hie Consul, in writing, entirely declined to recognise that Agreement, as being in contravention of the Declaration of 1862, and stated that should any difficulties arise between the Sultan and H.M. Government 'I will have them removed in accordance with the Treaty of 1862.' On 13th February the Sultan cancelled the concession. On the 15th February, faced with an ultimatum, coupled with a threat of bombardment failing a public cancellation, he ^ French Vice-Consul that he could no longer resist the pressure of H.M. Government, and he enclosed a copy of the Agreement of 1891 for M. Ottavi's information. The Vice-Consul, in a written reply, intimated that he had already made it clear that he could not recognise the Agreement of 1891, which was in contravention of the Declaration of 1802, and that he could not accept the cancellation of the grant which the Sultan had made. On 17th February the bultan announced his cancellation of the concession in a public Darbar. Discussions hetiveen Lord Salisbury and M. Cambon. 32. In the meantime, however, discussions had taken place in London with the French Ambassador, and the record of the conversations which took place between M. Cambon and Lord Salisbury is of sufficient importance as bearing on the construction of the declaration of 1862 to merit quotation. 33. On the 15th February 1899 Lord Salisbury informed the Ambassador at To Paris, 1 ans that the French Ambassador in London had spoken to him 'about the No. 48, supposed acquisition by France of a harbour at Muscat. ... He said he had no instructions to speak to me about it, but that he thought it better to mention it at once to avoid any misapprehension. The only thing that had happened was that the French Government, wanting both for their ships of war and for their p. 1762/99.F.O. to Pans, 58, 22.2.99, P. 1781/99. commerce a coaling station, had leased of the Imam of Muscat act' ■ that station. He called to mind the engagement we had entered into in'ws fot to trench on the independence of the Imam of Muscat and reminded m 1 n0t arrangement into which Muscat had entered in the time of Louis Pliilin t 0 of 11 tlle all Frenchmen to hold land, or receive leases or alienations of land in n + of the Sultan. He apprehended that the action of the French Government i te [ r | t0ry a coaling station was within their powers. J said that the matter had ho ^ , g ^ r / i x 3 t i ^ ueen m the hands of the Indian Government, and I was not absolutelv certain rvf • • ifi which it stood, but 1 won Id enquire, lint it app^reY t^e' uwn'hir!!!! statement of it, that Prance had ^one somewhat beyond her treaty rights ?f State accepts the lease of the territory of another potentate it practically intprf a in the independence of that potentate and the integrity of his dominions W h had sundry examples to illustrate that proposition recently. According to reading of the engagement of 1862, it is not competent for' France as a Stale 7 accept a lease from the Imam of Muscat, because so far as that lease extends it 1 interference with the independence of a sovereign. She can no more accept a leas! than she can accept an alienation. This view, of course, would not apply to a leas? given to a French citizen in his private capacity. I would, however, enquire into the matter, which I did not think was of very great importance, but my impression is that a coaling station leased by the French Government from the Imam of Muscat would be an infraction of the Declaration of 1862.' 34. On 22nd February, a week after the public 'cancellation of the French concession by the Sultan, M. Oambon was again received by Lord Salisbury. 'He complained very earnestly of the excessive action which he thought the Admiral had pursued towards the Imam of Muscat and of the publicity which had been given to this affair, which induced the newspapers to adopt a very disagreeable tone towards the P rench Government. ... I replied to him that I had examined into the matter since he spoke to me last time and I was compelled to adhere to the view which 1 had laid before him. It seemed to me that the Treaty of 1862, which bound both France and England to respect the independence of the Imam of Muscat, was seriously threatened if either Power, acting as a sovereign State, could take from the Imam a lease of any portion of his territory. If it could be done for a small piece of ground, it could be done over a large piece; and after what had takeii place in China it was impossible to say that the practical independence of the Imam would not, in regard to such portions of territory, be impaired. His Excellency declined entirely to admit my interpretation of the Treaty but, setting that question aside, he thought that our view on that subject, which was certainly open to discussion, need not have been asserted by a threat of bombardment. I mentioned, and 1 reiterated the opinion in order that he might be under no doubt with respect to it, that France had so far violated the Treaty by taking a lease of a portion of the territory of the Imam. I quite admitted that the aifair had not been conducted as quietly as I think it well might have been. ... I admitted t lat in the matter of sentiment he had a grievance, though in the matter of substance our action was entirely right. I also told him that we had for a great num )er of years special engagements with the Imam which involved some payments 0 money on our^ side and a very rigid prohibition of the alienation of his own leiritoi} on hi* side. The existence of these stipulations must be taken into account, 1 t e action ol our authorities had seemed to be rather summary, and they had undoubtedly been actuated by the fear lest the lease which France had obtained s ion on y e a step on the road to the obtaining of a portion of the Imam's littoral in permanent possession.

J 35. On the ^2/th February 1899 M. Cambon again called on the Foreign F.O. to I.O., Secretary and said that the trench Government accepted our reading of the Treaty of 1862 that neither State might accept any cession or lease of Muscat 1 ' 1794/29 ' territory, and that they no longer pressed the proposal that they should keep the grant ol Bunder Gisseh under formal assurances excluding the idea of territorial right. His Excellency maintained, however, that it was necessary for his Govern ment to be able to piocure coal in these waters and they accordingly proposed to establish a coal depot on exactly the same terms as our own, that is to say, on sufferance. But he lecjuested that the British Agent at Muscat might be informed that this had been done with the assent of Her Majesty's Government, as otherwise the Imam might object to the arrangement. . . .' Settlement of Bunder Gisseh Incident, 36. Aftei lengthy fuither discussion between the French Government and io to F 0 H.M. Government and examination of alternative sites, the matter was finally 21.4.99, settled m July 1900 by the grant to France by H.M. Government (after reference p - 14(55 /99- to the Sultan) of one-half of the area which they had hitherto themselves enjoyed i ^ to for coaling purposes in the Makalla cove in Muscat harbour. The conditions 20.3.99, of the grant were that the area in question should be held on precisely the same 8.6.99. conditions as the British area, i.e. that no political or territorial rights of any kind should be involved and no right given to fly the national flag or to erect fortifications. H.M. Government successfully insisted on having a determining voice in the question of the site to be granted to France, the argument that they were entitled to ensure that that site was in no way superior to the site held by F.O. Desp. Great Britain, since 'France, under the Treaty of 1862, had no right to any to p ff is ' privilege which England had not a right also to possess,' being employed in the 7 course of the discussions. ' P 237i/99. 37. The main points which emerge from the incident are:— (a) \V hile the acquisition of a lease of land by a private individual for use as a coaling station would not constitute a violation of the Declaration of 1862 and would be permissible under the French Commercial Treaties of 1844 and the British Commercial Treaty of 1891, acceptance of a lease or cession of Muscat territory by either Government would be an infraction of the terms of the Declaration. {h) H.M. Government based their representations to the Sultan on his violation of the Exclusive Agreement of 1891. Vis-d-vis the French, on the other hand, and in Parliament, H.M. Government took their stand on the Declaration of 1862, the India Office, while emphasising that the Agreement of 1891 ' conferred exceptional rights upon the British Government agreeing with the Foreign Office that it was impossible to found any argument on that [ q. to F 0 'to which France was not a party.' That Agreement has never been 2.5.99, officially communicated by H.M. Government to the French Government, p - 1949/99. and the French Vice-Consul declined to recognise it when it was officially communicated to him by the Sultan on the ground that it contravened the Declaration of 1862. On the other hand, H.M. Govern ment in dealing with the French made some play (c/. paragraph 34 above) with their special treaty relations with the Sultan, and recorded their financial assistance to him and the fact that he had undertaken not to alienate his territory. (c) H.M. Government felt unable to resist a French claim for precisely equal treatment; but were able to require that the area attributed to the French should be attributed on conditions identical with those on which the British area was held, viz. that no political or territorial rights were acquired in it and that the national flag should not be flown or defences erected.The French Coal Shed at Muscat, 1900-20. 38. The French maintained their coal shed until December 1920 -21 wh \ abandoned it, H.M, Government taking a lease for one year of their interest 6 ' 11 Later in 1921 H.M. Government informed the French Government tha? tl proposed to advise the Sultan to resume the site, for which they had themsel - P. 4262/21. use &gt; an(:1 ^h the concurrence of France they took action accordingly, tn IwV 0 P. 1682 /22. 1921 the Muscat Council of Ministers, after acknowledging the abandonment Ttlf French coal depot, added: ' We will be honoured if you inform your Hio-h Gov ment that we return that portion to her according to the past gift to h(?r fmJtr' Highness the Sultan.' The Political Agent in reporting this offer, which wa* accepted by H M. Government, stated that while the word used bv the'('Wnil S 'gift,' the intention was 'use of the site.' ' History and Position of the British Coal Depot at Muscat, 1874-1934 39. Up to the year 1875 the Government of India used to stock their coal in three godowns in Muscat, and the British-India Steam Navigation Company had a small coal shed in the Makalla cove in Muscat harbour, for which no rent was paid An annual rent of Rs. 174 was paid by Government for one godown, the 'others having been given rent free by the Sultan. Two fires, which endangered the safety of the town of Muscat, having broken out in the coal godowns in 1875, Saiyid Turki offered to allow H.M. Government to build a godown at Makalla next to the British- India coal shed, and the Government coal was accordingly stored there. In 1876 the British-India Steam Navigation Company broke up their coal depot at Muscat and sold the materials of the shed by auction, the site being resumed by the Sultan, who handed it over to the Political Agent for the use of Government. As stated in paragraphs 31 and 33 above, a portion of the British site was in 1900 made over to France, by whom it was held till 1920. Its use was regranted to H.M. Government by the Sultan in 1921. 40. The ground on which the Makalla coal sheds stand was not purchased by Government, nor was it rented, and the Political Agent reported in February 1899 that there was nothing in the records of the Muscat Agency to show whether the P^A Mus Sultan made a gift to the British Government of the site or whether he merely cat, to G. of a ^ owe( l the British coal sheds to be built there out of courtesy. The Political I., 28.2 .99. Agent added that the whole cove was not taken up by H.M. Government, a portion ^ being occupied by fishermen, whose houses adjoined the British coal shed ; Desp 39 ^ at ^ ie cove w as open to all ; and that no British flag has ever been hoisted at of 2.3.99, Makalla. So far as is known the British flag has not subsequently been hoisted on P. 345/89. the Muscat coal sheds, nor has rent been paid for them. They have not been KZ. 4963/ actively used ror many years, and in June 1934 they were transferred to the R.A.F. 34. for use as an oil depot with the written concurrence of the Sultan. Conclusion. 41, From the note above it will be seen that the French interest in Muscat is of long standing and dates back to the eighteenth century ; that it is based essentially on the Commercial Freaty of 1844 and the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862; but that it has been of active importance only between 1890 and 1914, although the Treaty provisions referred to still remain in force. Any sentimental attachment based on long historical association apart, the French have in the past, even during the period of the Entente Cordiale and immediately prior to the Great War, shown themselves fully alive to the ' nuisance value ' of their position in Muscat; and between 1908 and 1912 they declined offers made by H.M. Government of a not ungenerous territorial compensation elsewhere in return for an abrogation of their treaty rights. While France might be expected not to raise difficulties so long as the importance of any anchorage or rights acquired is minimised, and so long as H.M. Government are in a position to claim that no infringement of the Declaration of 1862 is involved, it is prima facie unlikely, even now, when for many years her active interest in Muscat has been slight, that her consent to the abrogation of the Declaration of 1862 or of the Commercial Treaty of 1844 could be secured without long discussion and a quid pro quo which might be disproportionately large.11 42. On this assumption, the questions for settlement appear to be— (a) the extent to which, and the conditions on which, H.M. Government are H ip V wi I t regarc to the construction which has been placed on the Declaration ol 1862, to acquire rights in respect of the use of a site m Muscat t6riitory ior ritival purposes; (b) whether such conditions are capable of fulfilment. 43. As regards the first of these points, it would be open to a British subject in bs private capacity (as distinct from the British Government) to acquire land for use as a harbour or a station under the terms of Article 3 of the British Commercial Treaty ot 1^1. n.M. Government themselves suggested to the French in 1899 that the dilfaculty which had arisen over Bunder Gisseh should be solved by the acquisition of a site for a coaling shed by a French subject, and the suo-gestion was rejected at the time by the French Government professedly only because it would not have been consistent with their prestige to accept it in the lio-ht of the references which had been made to it in the English Press. There are? however in any event, obvious difficulties about the acquisition of an area which would in practice be used only or even predominantly for naval purposes by any private individual. 44. If, on the othei hand, rights acquired are acquired by Government and not by a private individual, the construction of the Declaration of 1862 at once becomes material. 'The construction placed on that Declaration in the discussions of 1899-1900 described above was that neither signatory of the Declaration can, consistently with its terms, obtain a lease or cession of Muscat territory; that no action is permissible which would be an infringement of the independence of the Sultan (compare on this point the opinion expressed by the Law Officers in a different connection in 1899, paragraph 2S above) ; and that in these circumstances to acquire territorial or sovereign rights over property which they use in Muscat, to fly the national flag, or to erect defensive works, on such property would be a violation of the terms of that Declaration. (The coal sheds which H.M. Government have held in Muscat since 1874 have accordingly been held on sufferance only ; the national flag has not been flown, defensive works have not been erected, and no territorial or sovereign rights in the area have been conveyed. The coal sheds held by France from 1900 to 1920 were held on the same basis. Of the other sites at present occupied by H.M. Government, the use of the site of the civil aerodrome at Gwadur has been granted by the Sultan, who will receive an annual rent in return; its use is not confined to British subjects or aeroplanes ; the British flag is understood not to be flown ; and liability for protection rests with the Sultan. The position in regard to the strategic aerodromes is not clear; but it would appear that the Sultan, while retaining full sovereignty, has granted the use of the sites in question rent free, the British flag not being hoisted, and defensive works not being erected.) 45. It is open to question, in the second place, whether, on the construction placed on the Declaration in 1899, H.M. Government are not committed to recognising that either signatory can claim rights under the Declaration •corresponding to those which may be acquired by the. other. H.M. Government felt unable in 1899 to plead the Exclusive Agreement of 1891 against the French; that Agreement has at no stage been officially communicated to the French Government (and a French statement to the Sultan that it is inconsistent with the Declaration of 1862, and cannot be recognised, remains on record); and H.M. Government urged in the course of the discussions that France has no right to any privilege which England has not also a right to possess (paragraph 36 above). The point is of some importance because of the risk that the French, for reasons of prestige or from a desire to embarrass, either now or at a later stage, might advance a claim to a corresponding concession which (despite the provisions of the Exclusive Agreement of 1891) it might be difficult for the Sultan or for H.M. Government to resist. 46. From the above it would appear that H.M. Government might reasonably •claim to be entitled, consistently with their existing international engagements, to acquire rights in the Khor Quwai from the Sultan of Muscat, so long as those rights were without prejudice to the sovereignty of His Highness, conveyed no territorial or sovereign rights, and did not involve the flying of the national flag or the erection of defensive works. There need be no question of any acquisitioniz of territorial or sovereign rights, and no difficulty need arise over this So f defence is concerned, it would seem reasonable to suggest that no exception ^ a be taken to the equipment of tlie staff of the station with rifles, &amp;c., for ord purposes of self-defence, or to the building of boundary walls ; while the know] ln ^ that, thp stalirm was visit.ftd at rpynlar intprvals hv cln^T^c. i, • „ that the station was visited at regular intervals by the sloops of the Persian 0 If Squadron would seem likely to deter surrounding tribes from making ra is im t The question of the flying of the flag is one of greater difficulty. Having regard to the visit paid annually to Muscat by a French sloop and to the fact that th existence of the new station must become known to the international shipni 6 using the Gulf, it seems unlikely that if the flag were in fact flown it would escarf notice. Even if a flag other than the National flag were flown, and if the +v.^ ,•+ XT* a i , 'goian were not fixed in the ground, it might be open to France to argue that the presence of a flag was only consistent with the existence of a naval station or depot of such a character as to constitute an infringement of the Declaration of 1862. 47. A difficulty which should not be overlooked in connection with the acquisition of the site is perhaps that discussed in paragraph 45 above. It is perhaps relevant in this connection that under the Red Line Agreement Muscat falls within the sphere of the I.P.C., which contains a French group which has in the past shown itself extremely anxious to obtain a share in any oil development in the Persian Gulf area. Should oil at some time in the future be found in the Sultan's dominions and be exploited by the LP.C., French interest in Muscat might very well revive and the French Government be glad to take advantage of the existence oi a liritish naval station to make a corresponding demand on the Sultan.

Such a statement is liable to be regarded, and would certainly be interpreted by Chinese, as an admission that British Government, in some degree, recognises Liu Chen Line as the frontier, which is a position which Government has never accepted and is not in the least likely to accept, as claim to Scott Line as minimum is well authenticated. W hile it is true that expedition operations and present scope of administration will be limited by Liu Chen Line, His Excellency is strongly averse to anything like the implied admission to Chinese authorities that we, in any way, recognise the line as a boundary, and on the map issued for expedition purposes the line is described merely as provisional protection limit.

But it mi^bt be taken as certain that there was no question of its crossing the frontier recognised by His Majesty s Government. So far as was known it had not in fact crossed that claimed by the Chinese authorities. The information on which his memorandum was based was therefore undoubtedly incorrect. No doubt it had reached the Oentral bovernmerit before they had received the text of the statement made on 19th February by His Majesty s Consul-General at Yunnanfu to the local authorities a copy oi which was handed to Mr. Quo (No. 7). m Aft fr r remarkin g ou the desirability of establishing a definite frontier the Chinese Minister agreed that the matter w r ould only become pressing if the expedition were to enter the debatable territory. He was informed that before so doing, the expedition would report to London, and that nothing had been heard of any such intention on their part. It was observed to Mr. Quo that frontier Gommissmns had been found m the past to be ineffective owing to the reluctance ot Chinese Commissioners to come to any decision, a remark from which he did not attempt to dissent.

Translation of a Note from Wai-Chiao Pu to His Majesty's Charge d } Affaires, Nanking, dated 2nd March 1934. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that several telegrams have been received from the Yunnan Provincial Government to the effect that recently British subjects accompanied by troops have invaded Panhung (Panghung or ' Panhung') and other places of the southern section of the Yunnan frontier, and that they have organised a company, opened mines, built bridges and roads, established wireless stations and aerodromes, and have made a military demonstration with machine-guns and artillery. This Ministry duly telegraphed ordering the special Delegate for Foreign Affairs in Yunnan to ascertain the facts and take action on the matter, and have now received the following telegram in reply :— ' I have received a Note in reply from His Majesty's Consul at (Yunnan) to the effect that His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires in Nanking, to whom he had referred the matter, had now replied by telegram staling that the Scott Liue, as the Chinese Government were informed by a Note in 1904, was the boundary between the two countries and that any boundary whatsoever claimed by China to the west of that line could not be recognized ; and that it was not at present anticipated that the party sent on this occasion to the Burma frontier to carry out investigations would proceed beyond their present position at Lufang. I was very much surprised on receiving the above communication. On looking up the old records 1 find that on the 28th day of the third moon of the 50th year of Kuang Hsu (1904)1 a Note was received from Sir Ernest Satow, then His Majesty's Minister, and that on the 4th day of the fifth moon of the same yearj a Note was returned in reply asking him to transmit to His Majesty's Government the request that officers should be appointed to effect a joint demarcation with a view to a satisfactory agreement. Nevertheless, a delay ensued which has continued down to the present time, and no joint demarcation has yet been held or a satisfactory agreement reached. As for the so-called Scott Line, it is merely a boundary line delimited at the time by the British Commissioners alone, as * Not printed. This telegram reported the visit to the Foreign Office of the Chinese Minister (see No. 10). t i.e. 13th (? 12th) May IQCH. X i-e. 17th June 1904.Sir Ernest Satow himself admitted m his Note under reference, and since that date, also no mutual agreement between the two countries was reached as to the point. Absolutely no authority, therefore, can be adduced for this line and the matter does not call for further argument. Turning to the circumstances of the demarcation of the frontier at that time, both sides held to their own thesis and it was found impossible to reconcile their views, so that it has not been possible to reach a settlement of the dispute during the length of time that has elapsed since, i 'angh.mg and the other places being far to the east ot the ' Yellow Line ' undeiimited boundary, the fact that they are in any case in Chinese border territory is perfectly manifest. Ihe present actions of the British side in leading an expedition across the boundary, carrying out a demonstration, opening mines, making all kinds of military preparations and forcibly adducing their own unilateral views as grounds for their action are most unjustifiable. For the above reasons the Chinese Government certainly cannot recognise the unilaterally delimited Scott Line, and further must lodge a protest against the activities of the British at Pano-huno- and other places. I have accordingly the honour to request you to take note and to inform His Majesty's Government that pending the definite demarcation of the Yunnan-Burma undeiimited frontier, both sides should scrupulously observe the old established boundaries and should not transgress them. I have further the honour to request that immediate orders be issued for the cessation of the above -mentioned operations in regard to the^ opening of mines, the several threatening demonstrations and military preparations of all kinds, so that the border regions may be pacified and friendly relations strengthened. The favour of a reply is requested. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to you the assurance of my high consideration. W ang C hinq -W ei. (Seal of Ministry of Foreign Affairs). No. 13.

Pang- Ion- mines Chinese Legation have been informed in reply to representatu.ns here W Scntt Line is the only frontier we recognise, that we consider that we have the right to go beyond the line claimed by the Chinese, but that expedition would not do so without reporting. 2 It appears that Chinese Government are mainly exercised regarding Pano-huno- State. 1 believe that this Slate is bisected by Scott Line, but would be o-lacT if vtm could telegraph as soon as possible anymore particular mformatiou that may have recently become available regarding its position. 3 Chinese Minister here has referred in vague terms to desirability of settling the frontier. It might perhaps be worth while for us to consider again whether present Chinese attitude gives any ground for hoping that progress could be made towards a settlement if we entered on negotiations. When matter was last considered in 1929 and subsequent years, Lampson took the view that internal political situation in China was too unfavourable to make progress possible (see Peking telegram 974 of 29th November 1929- and Peking despatch to \unnanfu, No. 10 (16/77) of 24th July 1931*).

Mr. Hsu Mo (Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs), and Mr. Liu (Head of the European and American Department). His Majesty's Minister, and Sir E. Teichman. B urma -Y unnan F rontier. His Majesty's Minister referred to the Note which he had just received from the Waichiaopu (No. 12 a ) on the subject of alleged British aggression on the soutiiern section of the Burma-Yunnan frontier. * • „ tf&gt; Sir A. Cadogan proceeded to make a few remarks on the subject, reiernng the fact that the section of the frontier in question had not yet been delimited, a it was situated in wild and largely unexplored country, and that different ? ron * lines were claimed by both parties. His Majesty's Government mamtammg line claimed by them. He, Sir A. Cadogan, had received a certain amoun information about the affair which had given rise to the Chinese Note and won be happy to place the Waichiaopu in possession of all the facts. A S ™ !. SU1 TJ| expedition had been sent out into the country on the British side of the (ils P U i ^ area, accompanied by an escort. This expedition had not in actual fact apprcac , very closely to the disputed line. Their actions had been entirely regu * Not printed.gave no grounds for complaint On the other hand, he, Sir A. Cadogan, was bound to say that, according to the indications he had received, it seemed that the Chinese had in tact entered the disputed area from their side. Mr. Hsu Mo asked various questions, with reference to the localities concerned, the status, whetber official or otherwise, of the Burma Corporation, and the size of the escort. As regards these latter points, His Majesty's Minister said that the Burma Corporation was, he understood, a commercial company, and they were accompanied by an escort of troops, since it would not in any case be safe to approach the v\ a otate country without military protection. As regards the question of localities, it soon appeared from the conversation that the Waichiaopn had been given to understand by the Yunnan authorities that the British had invaded Panghung, which was admittedly in the disputed area. A map was produced, and it was found possible to convince Mr. Hsu Mo that Panglong, to which neighbouihood the British expedition had been sent, was well oil the British side of the disputed area, i.e. to the west of the Chinese ' Yellow ' Line. As to the exact^ localitv oi Luiang, the point which the British expedition had leached, feir IL. Teicnman stated that it was understood to be m the immediate vicinity of Panglong, i.e. a few miles to the north-east of it but well on the British side ol the Chinese-claimed line. These explanations seemed to some extent to satisfy Mr. Hsu Mo, who pointed out that Panghung was indisputably in territory claimed by China, 'but accepted our assurances that Panglong was where the maps showed it to be and that that was the district in which the expedition was operating. Fortunately, the Chinese map which was produced confirmed the position of Panglong on our map. At the conclusion oi the conversation Mr. Hsu Mo enquired of Sir A. Cadogan whether he thought it desirable that attempts should be made to delimit the frontier. Sir A. Cadogan replied that, speaking personally and privately, he certainly thought it would be a good thing, but that he could not, of course, speak for His Majesty's Government. In the course of further conversation he said that he felt sure that His Majesty's Government would sympathetically examine any such proposal. He would, if Mr. Hsu Mo wished, ascertain their attitude towards it. Mr. Hsu Mo concurred, and Sir A. Cadogan said he would telegraph in that sense. Mr. Hsu Mo (in his usual guarded way to avoid any commitment) said that the Chinese Government on their side would also consider the matter. Mr. Hsu Mo mentioned in the above connection that the best method would doubtless be delimitation in the field. Sir E. Teichman observed that wdiile, of course, a measure of delimitation in the field would be necessary, it might well be desirable in the first instance to seek agreement on certain main principles at a conference table. Otherwise the two Governments would merely be sending out a new boundary delimitation commission to do the work based on the Conventions •of 1691 and 1897 which previous boundary commissions had so signally failed to accomplish. Mr. Hsu Mo did not demur. £1 T 7th March 1934. .No. 17. P.Z. 1758/34. Telegram from Mr. Holman {Nankinq, via Peking) to Foreign Office, dated \0th March 1934.

Your telegram of the 8th instant, 552.* Panghung State is bisected bv Scott Line as shown on Panglong map, 1929, reprinted 1933. Small wedge of Panghung territory about 5 miles long and 2 miles broad lies west of Liuchen Line in close proximity Lufang. This wedge divides Yungpang and Panglong territories. Latest information does not confirm any serious violation of Scott Line by Chinese troops and militia. Probably messengers and agents have been sent into Panghung and other States and possibly small parties may have crossed the Scott Line in search of information regarding our position and intention. Evidence is lacking, however, that Chinese troops or militia are preparing any organised counter -opposition in Panghung or elsewhere. Much more probable that ChiDese will try to instigate Wa resistance. Burma Government would welcome settlement of boundary question and consider best basis that suggested in Foreign Office telegram to' Peking, No. 427, 23rd November 1929.* Recent information from Yunnan-fu indicates growth of somewhat intransigent feeling leading to extravagant claims over British territory, including most of Shan and Bhamo and Myitkyina districts. Experience of Joint Boundary Commissions has been that Chinese representatives, in defiance of all facts and argument, have never been willing and probably have never dared to abate Chinese claims. Even in case of Liuchen Line, Chinese Boundary Commissioners who suggested it were subsequently disgraced. So far as Burma Government can judge, general conditions in China do not seem to have changed sufficiently since 1929 to modify views held then that the situation was unfavourable to make progress towards settlement. Burma Government does not think that the Joint Boundary Commission would achieve any useful result and, for reasons indicated above, doubts whether negotiations are likely to be fruitful mainly because it cannot discern any likelihood of China in any way compromising her extravagant claim. Only further recourse, therefore, would seem to be arbitration, to which there are presumably objections, or reference to League of Nations, to which Burma Government would not be averse, but would prefer that initiative should come from China and consider it necessary that China should at any rate bind herself to accept the League of Nations decision.'

Mr. Hsu Mo enquired whether any reply had yet been received from His Majesty's Government in regard to the suggestions made for a joint delimitation of the frontier. Sir A. Cadogan said that while the telegrams he had seen indicated that the matter was now under consideration, he had received no definite instructions yet. He expected, however, to do so very shortly. Mr. Hsu Mo referred to the desirability of doing something about the matter in view of the excited tone of the articles in the Chinese Press and the growing agitation regarding the whole question. Owing to the great distances involved, they, the Waichiaopu, had not yet been able to obtain confirmation of what Sir A. Cadogan had told him at the interview on 7th March (No. 16). He enquired whether His Majesty's Minister had any further information to impart. Sir A. Cadogan replied that the only information he had to communicate was that he had received telegraphic confirmation of the fact that the expedition had not crossed the so-called 'Liu-chen' Line. There was some further conversation about the vagueness of the boundaries of Panhung and the neighbouring States, and Sir A. Cadogan observed that be rather gathered from one of his recent telegrams that a small area of Panhung might extend across the Yellow (Liu-chen) Line. E, T eiciiman. 19th March 1934. 3435 B10 No. 23.

Telegram from Government of Burma to Secretary of State, for India, repeating telegram addressed to India, dated 1th April 1934. {Repeated to Secretary of State for India and Wa States.) It is now definitely known that Sung Teh Hsin, commanding garrison at Chuan Lo, north 23/54 east 100/11, with chief of Mongnyimtao, crossed Scott Line into Panghung, with escort consisting of partly Chinese militia and partly Muhsos. They are known to have been at Panghung capital on 19th and 2Uth March,^ and the facts referred to below indicate continued presence there up to date. This party was sent by the Lantsang deputy magistrate, Chang, whose official station is Chienpien (V 14), but who has transferred himself to Mengtung (L 8), capital of (? Mongkawtum), where he has stated that he has been sent by the Provincial Government to enquire into the Lufang matter. There is information that another Chinese party has crossed the Scott Line near Hsengwa (L 6), but this information not yet definitely coiroborated. Efforts of friendly element in Panglao, supported by Panglong, who is now .actively helping us, are being counteracted by unfriendly elements which are unquestionably being supported and instigated by the Chinese influence in Panghung referred to above. This is definitely preventing the clearing up of the Panglao situation. Communications received from Panghung chief, formerly courteous and conciliatory, have lately become definitely unconciliatory and discourteous, and the form of these communications and internal evidence contained in them suggests their composition by the Chinese rather than by Panghung chief himself.

Cadogan, in his discussion with the Chinese Vice -Minister for Foreign Affairs on 7th March (No. 16), explained the position of the Burma Government's party at Lufang and pointed out that it appeared from our reports that the Chinese, on the other hand, had actually ciossed the line claimed by His Majesty's Government (telegram No. 12 Tour, dated 8th March) (No. 16). Sir Samuel Hoare would suggest that the Government of Burma's telegram of 7th April (No. 24) should be repeated to Sir A. Cadogan, and that he might be instructed to inform the Nanking Govern ment of this definite confirmation of the reports previously received, and to make energetic representations against this violation of the Scott Line. 4. Sir A. Cadogan might perhaps at the same time be informed that it is regretted that it is not yet possible to send him instructions on the question whether it would be desirable to attempt by negotiation to arrive at a general settlement of the frontier question, as this question is still under consideration, but that he should not delay his representations regarding the crossing of the Scott Line on this account.

Dear Walton, Dr. Chen of the Chinese Legation called yesterday and said that the Chinese Government were anxious to reach a settlement of the Burma-Yunnan boundary question. I rather gathered from his manner that they might be prepared to make some concessions in order to have a fixed frontier and avoid trouble in the future. I said that the matter was under consideration, but I could not say what the outcome would be. It was not altogether an easy question, as past experience did not encourage one to hope that an agreement would easily be reached, and if there was not a good prospect of agreement the expense and trouble of a Boundary Commission might be wasted. As to avoiding trouble, was it certain that a fixed boundary would really have this result? We were suffering from all kinds of false reports though our expedition had not even entered debatable territory and there was no sort of excuse for them. Could we be sure of being spared them if the frontier were fixed ? So far from our being at fault, we were having to protest at Nanking against an incursion of Chinese into the disputed area.1 referred also to the complication caused by the fact that Burma, which might eventually be separated from India, was interested and not India only. We were however, examining - the proposal and an answer would be sent in due course. Yours sincerely, C. W. O rde. No. 28. RZ. 2579/34. Telegram from Sir A.

At these interviews Sir A.

' Sir A. Cadogan is instructed by His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to remind the Chinese Government, as they were informed by Sir E. Satow in his Note of 7th March 1905, that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom regard the line laid down by Sir G. Scott as provisional boundary Chinese officials and troops cannot be allowed to transgress. According to definite and reliable reports now received by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom the Lantsang (Chenpien) deputy magistrate, who had proceeded to Mengtung, allegedly under orders of Provincial Government, to enquire into situation on the frontier, recently despatched a party of Chinese officials and militia who crossed the Scott Line into Panghung and were actually in capital of that territory on 19th March.

If negotiations were entered unon he presumes that they would be undertaken solely in the hope of arriving at a direct agreement w.th the Nanking Government. The question, therefore! is lal-elv whet lei le chances of such an agreement are sufficiently great to make it worth while to commence negotiations. 3 From recent telegraphic correspondence with the Government of India it will have been seen that no commercially exploitable mines have been found in the area traversed by the Panglong expedition, and furthermore that the Burma Corporation are satisfied from the geological evidence obtained that there are no such mines even on the east of the Liuchen Line Despite these negative results, it is clear that for political reasons the area actually traversed by the expedition must now be brought ■under some form of permanent control, and consequently the Government of Burma for administrative reasons, consider it desirable that the frontier should if possible be settled, and, it there is any chance of settling it by negotiation, they would favour tnat course. 4 Sir Samuel Hoare notes that the Nanking Government have themselves mooted the question of an attempt to delimit the frontier in the interview between tti ! at f Sty S 1 ^ mis | er a nci the Chinese Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs on ,h March, and that the Counsellor of the Chinese Legation in London has stated that his Government are anxious to reach a settlement (Mr. Orde's demi-official letter of 14th April) (No. ^7). It seems possible that, as a result partlv of the ang ong expedition, the piospects of the Chinese authorities agreeing to a reasonable settlement may be more favourable than they have been 'considered to be in the past. . 5. If negotiations were decided on, it would seem advisable to adopt the Focedure suggested in 1929 (Foreign Office telegrams to Peking, Nos. 426 and 427 ot -ord November 1929). In that case, before any demarcation on the spot took place, an attempt would be made to arrive at an agreed basis for demarcation bv means of a conference, to be held at Nanking or elsewhere, at which the Govern- ment of Burma and also, possibly, the Yunnan Government might be represented. Ibe aim of the British representatives would be to revert to the spirit of the Conventions of 1894 and 1897 and the political attachments of tribal groups existing at the date of the annexation of Upper Burma in 1886. In view of the administrative inconvenience and danger of dividing homogeneous tribes, our object should be to include within the British frontier either the whole of the Wa •country or as much of it as possible We should no doubt claim at least the Scott Line (which is supported by the definite geographical indications in Article 1 of p Convention of 1897) or (in view of the second paragraph of Article 6 of the Convention) some modification of it, in our favour or otherwise, which would avoid the bisection of Panghung State. Our minimum desideratum would be the Scott compromise line. In order to secure an administratively sound frontier in the VVa country, we might be prepared to offer some concession in the Hpimaw region, * Not printed. This letter forwarded a copy of No. 16.The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. 14 on the other undetermined stretch of the Burma-\unnan frontier north of latitude 25° 35'. If the conference appeared to be making good progress, its scope might possibly be extended with a view to a treaty settlement ul the latter and longer stretch of unsettled frontier, which was reserved by Article 4 ot the Convention of 1894 for future decision. 6. At the present stage, however. Sir Samuel Hoare would be grateful for an expression of the views of Sir John Simon on the question whether, il negotiations were opened in regard to the frontier in the Wa country on the lines suggested above, there would be a reasonably good chance of a satisfactory conclusion, by means of direct negotiations, and without incurring an_\ undue risk of the Chinese Government pressing for a reference to the League ol Nations in a manner which might be embarrassing to His Majesty's Government. 1 am, &amp;c., J.

Waichiaopu are now engaged in ascertaining whether in fact Yunnan Provincial Government sent officials and troops to Panlumg to make investigations, but this is stated to be a matter of Chinese internal affairs, and has no concern with points raised in our memorandum (presumably because the Chinese maintained that Panhung is within the old limits of jurisdiction). Waichiaopu therefore state that our protest has no basis and cannot be entertained.

As you are aware, neither the expedition nor the Burma Corporation's experts crossed the Liuchen Line, but the Corporation are satisfied, from the geological evidence which their experts were able to obtain, that there are no commercially exploitable mines to the east of that line. There would be no objection, if y ou think tit, to your letting the Chinese Government know that geological evidence was obtained which demonstrates to the complete satisfaction of our experts the absence of any commercially exploitable mines anywhere in the neighbourhood.

Dr Chen did not mention the decision of the Chinese Government to send a party to the Burma-V unnan frontier and instruct it to cross the Scott Line He did. however refer to the suggestion which he said had been made bv Sir Alexander Cadogan that as the Burma expedition had not crossed the Yellow Lme so the Chmese should not cross the Scott Line, and remarked that this could hardly be accepted as a solution since the Chinese Government had not agreed to the latter boundary. s 3. In Sir John Simon's opinion the possibility of the Chinese Government's proposing without due notice to refer the question to the League of Nations is one to be reckoned with, and it would seem advisable that Sir Alexander Oado^an phould be instructed as to the terms of the reply he should return, should he be confronted with such a development. Subject to the views of Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare Sir John Simon considers that His Majesty's Minister could emphasise the fact that, while not formally opened, negotiations on this highly complex question have been definitely envisaged, and that it would be entirely unreasonable to suggest relerence to a third party. mi rT i o o, J am » Ihe Under Secretary of State for India.

He said that Chinese Government were sending a party to the frontier and that it would be instructed to cross Scott Line. He emphasised that it was a bona fide mission of enquiry and was only being sent to study the •conditions on the spot in the disputed area. He felt such information as was possible to obtain would be most useful in any delimitation negotiations which might take place later. '2. Speaking personally, I strongly deprecated the issue of instructions to cross bcott Line. The Chinese view seems to be that, while we must not enter the ■disputed area, they were free to do so. I could net accept this view. I understood Chinese Government were anxious for settlement of frontier, but 1 must tell him 1 fear such action as this might prejudice negotiations for delimitation such as he seemed to desire. Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs would not alter his standpoint and simply requested me to report to you intentions of Chinese Government. ''3. I then informed Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs that I was now awaiting receipt of a letter from India Office on whole question and that it might be some time therefore before I could reply to his proposal for delimitation of frontier. vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs quite understood and added that his advice was that a commission would be appointed straight away to delimit the frontier on the spot, but that he was quite prepared to consider any proposal for negotiation in the first instance at Nanking or elsewhere by representatives of the two Govern ments of the general trace of frontier and thus avoid as far as possible difficulties ior delimitation commission.' •Not printed.It) 44 No. 39. 1 felt it undesirable to make any communication to Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs in the sense of final paragraph of your telegram No. 157 (No. 33).

Peking telegrams 38 and 39 Tour of 15th May, repeated to you in my telegram No. 1350, dated 23rd May (No. 35). Burma-Yunnan frontier. Counsellor of Chinese Legation in interview at Foreign Office on 16th gave assurances that his Government had no ulterior motive in proposing delimitation negotiations; made no reference to despatch of party to frontier with instructions to cross Scott Line, but indicated that Cadogan's suggestion, that as Burma expedition had not crossed Yellow Line so Chinese should not cross Scott Line, could hardly be accepted as solution, since Chinese did not recognise latter boundary. 2. Subject to your observations, which please telegraph very urgently, we are inclined to think that following would be best line to take with Chinese: that while they do not admit, and we claim, Scott Line, status quo in this region is. of 30 years' standing, and any suggestion to upset it, such as despatch of exploratory party would involve, could only give rise to serious difficulties and postpone, perhaps indefinitely, friendly settlement of disputed frontier. It would, of course, be necessary for His Majesty's Government, in event of Chinese Govern ment proceeding with proposal, to retain complete liberty of action, and Chinese Government would appreciate difficulties likely to arise if exploratory missions were to be despatched by both parties. Other considerations apart, a serious difference between His Majesty's Government and Chinese Government over an area semi-civilised in character and, to the best of our knowledge, devoid of any mineral or other wealth, would be foolish. (On this question of the potential mineral value of this area, to which apparently the Chinese attach exaggerated value. Minister might assure Chinese Government, in such manner and at such juncture as he thinks fit, that result of recent investigations is negative and that there does not appear to be any ground for believing that the area contains any commercially workable mineral deposits.) This dispute was of long standing and could only satisfactorily be settled by agreed delimitation such as Chinese had already suggested. His Majesty's Government were quite prepared to agree to this and would, of course, adopt reasonable attitude on points in dispute, but thought first step was to settle principles underlying delimitation. They suggested, therefore, that these should be discussed at Nanking with representatives of His Majesty's Government. It would, of course, be essential that representatives of Government of Burma and Government of Yunnan should be associated with the discussions from the outset. Once principles had been agreed joint delimitation commission could, if necessary,, be sent to delimit on the spot. To send an advance party before agreement had been reached on principles would, other objections in preceding paragraph apart, be mere waste of effort and unlikely to lead to any satisfactory result. Ihe essential thing was to settle the governing principles, and until this had been done to avoid any interference with the status quo. His Majesty's Government felt confident that on further reflection Chinese Government would agree as to this,, and in that event would let them have early proposals for consideration. 3. As regards League of Nations, Foreign Office suggest that if, but only if, Chinese rai&amp;e and press point His Majesty's Minister should emphasise that, while not formally opened, negotiations on this highlj' complex question have been definitely envisaged, and that it would be entirel}' unreasonable to suggest reference to a third party. Ihis seems the best line to take. 1 should be glad to know whether, after consulting the Government of Burma, you agree. * Not printed. See Xo. 31.17 No. a?. P.Z. 3636/34.

Following telegram from Burma Government, 66, 29th May: — 'On Brd May, Consul-General, Yunnan-fu, telegraphed reporting proposal of Yunnan-fu L rovmcial Government to send two officials, accompanied by Attaches and small escort, tu Lufang via Tawnio to get an idea of what is happening there In reply, Consul-General, Yunnan-fu, on 16th May, was informed that^ Burma Government declined to contemplate anything in nature of visit of inspection by Chinese party accompanied by Attache and escort; but, on the other hand, Burma Government did not consider it advisable to close the door entirely to the Chinese request, piovided that visit weie paid at lime suitable to Burma Government, that official of suitable rank, not less^ than Tupan, was designated as visitor, that the Burma Government should issue invitation for the visit, and that from the frontier he should be entirely in our charge, his Chinese escort being left behind at the frontier. It was explained that the Civil Officers on the spot were opposed to the visit at present, both because the recent Wa opposition was due to Chinese instigation and because (? omission) would be likely to be misinterpreted, but that they agreed that, if the situation were favourable, a visit might be contemplated next cold weather. It was added that the Chinese visit could not be arranged without the sanction of higher authority and such sanction would take time to obtain, with the result that the rains would be on before anything could be done. It was suggested to the Consul-General that, if he saw no objection, he should reply in suitable terms intimating Burma Government's inability to accept the proposal in the form communicated, and saying, further, that Burma Government would have to refer matter to higher authority with result that rains would be on before any decision could be reached, but that, if all were quiet and situation permitted and if Provincial Government still so desired, Burma Government would be prepared to issue invitation for visit of courtesy next cold weather on the lines indicated above, subject to sanction of higher authority as well to situation permitting. ' Burma Government agree generally in the line of reply proposed by Secretary of State, but suggest that commencement of the argument suggested by him would he strengthened as follows :— ' ' While they do not admit and we claim, Scott Line, we do not admit and they claim, Liuchen Line, and as we have scrupulously refrained from crossing latter line out of consideration for status quo of 30 years' standing in this region, it is reasonable to expect Chinese to refrain from crossing Scott Line out of similar consideration, and because despatch of proposed party could only give rise to serious difficulties, &amp;c.' u Government of India and Secretar}^ of State have already been informed of former violations of Scott Line, and present Chinese proposal only pushes stage further and gives previous intimation of Chinese interference in the area between Scott and Liuchen Lines which has already taken place, and is no doubt designed to attempt establishing a fait accompli in advance of negotiations. Local Government agree that Chinese should be informed of negative results of mining investigations.' We agree generally with Burma Government and have the following comments :— {a) We cannot without further consultation undertake any financial liability from Central revenues in regard to preliminary discussion at Nanking, at 3435 C18 which it is not proposed that we should be represented, nor in regard to the delimitation commission if that subsequently materialises. (h) We do not propose to make any increased contribution towards extending administration in the neighbourhood of the Burma-China frontier, (c) We do not understand which line Buima Government refer to in their telegram, repeated above, when they suggest that Chinese visitor should be in their charge and should leave his Chinese escort behind at the frontier. We are asking for further elucidation of this point, but presume His Majesty's Government will not agree to this visit unless satisfactory progress is made meanwhile with the discussion at Isanking.

In the last few days inEormation has accumulated which, while probably exaggerated as regards numbers, definitely pointed to bands of Chinese moving on both sides of the Scott Line. Civil Officer, Lufang, now reports that on 30th May Chinese body arrived at Manchiu (H 6). Reconnaissance found uniformed Chinese entrenched on Panglao ridge who opened fire on our men. It was necessary to dislodge them, which was done without casualty on our side. Over a dozen dead picked up, all Chinese ; uniform and property show that they all were or had been Chinese regulars. Rifles and bandoliers with modern cartridges and two-and-a-half days' rations. French Indo- Chinese newspapers of 30th March this year, personal articles of French origin and nature of the money found indicates that they had come from Tongking border or Yunnan-Fu railway zone. Manchiu had been made the headquarters, red and white flag flying and intermittent bugling from that village and troops then opened fire on us. Subsequently, at least 200 were seen on the road to Chingsan (G 6) west of Liuchen Line, endeavouring encircle our force. Manchiu villagers later informed Civil Officer that force w^hich occupied and looted Manchiu was 500, partly Chinese and partly wild Was. Later telegram says, presumably from information from villagers, that Chinese force was called in by Panghung Sawbwa to assist Ranglao and had 400 rifles; 10 Chinese were mounted and four claim to be officials. Chinese plan was to invest Lufang while Was attacked Manchiu and Manhsiang (G 7). Another 100 Chinese proceeded direct to Panglao. It is expected Manhsiang w T ill be attacked and arrangements are being made to defend it. It had been reported before that Panghung had called in Lihsiche, said to be dacoit leader, but acting under instructions from the Chinese. Latest information that he had gone to Kengma to consult Chinese officials. Chinese will presumably repudiate the force as bandits, but it seems clear that they were acting with Chinese approval. Military police, who had already begun to move back to Lashio for the rains, have been sent back to Lufang, and further report is awaited. Repercussions west of Liuchen Line not yet known. No. 40.

Telegram from Government of Burma to Government of India, dated 5th June 1934. {Repeated to Secretary of State for India.) 75. ^ Reference your telegram of the 2nd inst., 1303 (No. 41). As protest to the Chinese Government suggested, this Government thinks it may be useful to state how the present position presents itself to it In the first place, the occupation of the undelimited territory between the Scott and the Liuchen Lines by the Chinese may be regarded as partially accomplished fact. Evidence already quoted in previous telegrams shows that Chinese regular troops are being employed and that they are working on detinite scheme. Regular patrolling is being carried out and ] t is reported that Chinese have not only re-occupied positions on the Manchiu picket spur, but are digging themselves in there and at other strategic positions along the20 Manchiu Road nearer to Lufang. On Jst June morning during mist strong Chinese patrol came up the Chinshan Road as far as Macheig (G b), where it retired on discovering we held ridge. In Local Government estimate therefore it seems definitely established that Chinese main objective is to occupy zone between Scott and Liuchen Lines specified by us in order to face us with settled fact. In the neighbourhood of Lufang this objective may be regarded as established and in all probability Chinese will attempt to establish same objective in remainder of the Wa States between Scott and Liuchen Lines. This was anticipated in this Governmeut's telegram 66 29th May (No. 38), and the present view merely makes more definite protest contemplated in your telegram 1303, 2nd June (No. 41), and foreshadowed in the Secretary qf State's 1379, 26tli May (No. 36), read with suggestion conveyed in my telegram 66, 29th May (No. 38). ■ , , Regarding Chinese objective so far referred to as a certainty rather than probability, Governor of Burma considers there are two fuither factors to be taken into account: (1) the probability, amounting almost to a certainty, that Chinese will use their occupation of zone between Scott and Liuchen Lines as a Ibasis of intrigue or cause trouble in our States west of Liuchen Line, and (2) the further possibility that they will actively invade our area west of the Liuchen Line either by directly attacking us or by sending Chinese forces to the States to instigate and stiffen an attack on us. , . . ' . . Chinese intrigues o£ 31st May and their continuance is contimied by infor mation referred to in paragraph 2, my telegram of the 4th instant, 72 (No. 42). Furthermore, it report referred to in the same paragraph of the arrival of 500 Chinese in Mankwei and Motlong is confirmed, this would be consistent with second possibility referred to above, namely, active invasion of our territory. Previous correspondence refers to information received of Clunese intentions of attacking Lufang and Hopang and the fact that no attack has so far taken place is not conclusive that an attack will not be made. Engagement with Chinese, 30th May, reported in my telegram of the 1st instant, 70 (No. 39), may of course have been due to deliberate intention to attack us, but, on the other hand, is not incon sistent with possible view that Chinese thought we were encroaching, or intending to encroach, over Liuchen Line, and that they merely intended to resist any such ■encroachment. . . , . . .• i As, however, Chinese have no maps, it is obvious that there is continual possibility of clashes between our parties and theirs in the vicinity of Liuchen Line. Events of next few days will probably show how far Chinese are prepared to push their attacks on us. In the meantime. Local Government is doing whatever possible to strengthen military police force in Wa States and for this purpose will probably accept offer district headquarters to garrison Lashio temporarily with Burma Rifles, thereby relieving Military Police for Wa States operations. Situation in Burma precludes Local Government from sending reinforcements from other battalions to Lashio. In Burma Government's view, Chinese occupation of zone between Scott and Liuchen Lines cannot be allowed to pass without strong protest and clear statement that such occupation can in no way prejudice British claim to territory up to Scott Line. If it were intended to make such protest effective by turning Chinese out of zone, Burma Government would, of course, be unable to undertake the task, which would involve military measures. Local Government considers that strong protest also is justified against Chinese intrigue in our territory west of Liuchen Line, but recognises that so long as Chinese activities are dedicated to intrigue. Local Government must attempt to deal with situation, and control tribes with available Military Police. If Chinese go beyond this, and invade our States west of Liuchen Line, in Local Government's opinion this clearly cannot be tolerated, and will have to be subject of military action. No. 44. P.Z. 3792/34. Telegram from Government of Burma to Government of India, dated 5th June 1934. {Repeated to Secretary of State for India and Yunnanfu.) 76. Since my telegram of the 5th instant, 75 (No. 43), was sent, definite information received indicating that approximately 2,000 Chinese troops are concentrated at Manchiu (H 6) with intention of attacking Lufang. It is repQrte also that troops at Mengcbang (M 1), referred to in my telegram No. 72 (^o. 4-;,21 dated 4th June, are intended for attack on Hopang, thus threatening our communications. Chief Yungpang states that Chinese have arrived in his State Every md.cation therefore points to the second possibility foreshadowed in my telegram &lt;5, 5th June (No, 43j, of Chinese invasion of our area west of the Liucheu Line and direct attack on us, as well as sending Chinese forces into States, is on the point of being realised. Burma Government has accepted Burma District's offer to send one section of guns to operations area and Burma Rifles to garrison Lashio in order to relieve maximum number of Military Police at L. to reinforce our columns, bituation undoubtedly gives cause for anxiety and Local Government ■consider that developments now reported emphasise the necessity for immediate protest m the strongest terms As stated in the last sentence of my telegram of the 5th instant, ib,No. 43), if Chinese attacks in strength develop, military action will be necessary. J No. 45. P.Z. 3754/34. Letter from India Office to Foreign 1934. .Sir, I am diiected by the Secretary of State for India to refer to the telegrams from the Government of Burma, Nos. 70 of 1st June (No. 39), 71 of 2nd June (No. 40). and 72 of 4th June (No. 42), and from the Government of India, Nos. 1289 of 1st June (No. 58) and 1303 of 2nd June (No. 41), regarding Chinese activities on the Panghung-Panglong border in the Wa States. It will be observed that uniformed •Chinese troops were found entrenched on the Panglao ridge, and that another body was seen on the road to Chingsan west of the Liuchen Line. It would thus appear that bodies of Chinese troops have been located to the west of that line. It is also' -anticipated by the Officer-in-Charge of the Panglong Expedition, from reports received, that attacks may be made on Manhsiang, Lufang and Hopang, which are well to the west of the Liuchen Line. 2. Sir Samuel Hoare would suggest, for Sir John Simon's consideration, that His Majesty's Minister, Peking, should be instructed to lodge immediately a protest in the strongest possible terms regarding this unprovoked aggression by Chinese uniformed, and presumably regular, forces which have penetrated deep into British territory west of the Scott Line, pointing out that bodies have been located even to the wept of the Liuchen Line, which is claimed by the Chinese Government as the frontier. It is suggested that Sir A, Cadogan might be instructed to demand that immediate orders should be given for the withdrawal of a]l bodies of troops which have crossed the Scott Line, and to state that, failing this, His Majesty's Government must of course consider themselves free to take such action as they consider necessary and ■desirable. 3. With reference to His Majesty's Minister's telegrams Nos. 38 and 39 Tour of 15th May (No. 35), and your letter of 18th May (No. 34), Sir Samuel Hoare would suggest that Sir A. Cadogan should bo instructed to reply in the following sense to the Chinese Government's announcement of their intention to send a mission of enquiry to the frontier to study conditions on the spot. While the Chinese Government do not admit, and His Majesty's Government claim, the Scott Line, His Majesty's Government do not admit the Chinese claim to the Liuchen Line, and, as His Majesty's Government have scrupulously refrained from crossing the latter out of consideration for the status quo of 30 years' standing in this region, it is reasonable to expect the Chinese, out of a similar consideration, to refrain from crossing the Scott Line. The despatch of the party proposed by the Chinese Government could only give rise to serious difficulties and postpone, perhaps indefinitely, a friendly settlement of the disputed frontier. If the Chinese Govern ment proceed with their proposal it will, of course, be necessary for His Majesty's Government to retain complete liberty of action, and the Chinese Government will appreciate the difficulties likely to arise if exploratory missions were to be despatched by both sides. ^n the question of the potential mineral value of this area—of which apparently the Chinese have exaggerated notions—Sir A. Cadogan might assure the Nanking Government, in such manner and at such time as he thinks tit, that the recent mining investigations carried out by the Burma Corporation's experts in areas west ■of the Liuchen Line have yielded only negative results, from which they are22 satisfied that the neighbouring areas also do not offer any more favourable prospects than those investigated. Sir A. Cadogan might go on to point out that the dispute regarding the frontier is of long standing, and can only be satisfactorily settled by an agreed delimitation such as the Chinese Government have already suggested. His Majesty's Govern ment are quite prepared to agree to this, and would of course adopt a reasonable attitude on all points in dispute, but they consider that as a first step it is necessary to settle the principles which should underlie a delimitation, and therefore suggest that these should first be discussed at Nanking with representatives of His Majesty's Government and the Government of Burma. It would, of course, be essential that representatives of the Government of Yunnan should be associated with the discussioDS from the outset. When once principles had been settled, a joint commission could, if necessary, be sent to demarcate the frontier on the spot But to send an advance party before an agreement on principles has been reached would, apart from the other objections already referred to, be a mere waste of effort and unlikely to lead to any satisfactory result. The essential points are to settle the governing principles for a delimitation of the frontier, and until this has been done, to avoid any interference with the status quo. His Majesty's Govern ment feel confident that, on further reflection, the Chinese Government will agree with this view, and will let His Majesty's Government have early proposals for consideration. 4. It is further suggested that His Majesty's Minister should nut himself mention the question of a reference to the League of Nations, but that if the Chinese raise and press this question, he should emphasise that direct negotiations on this highly complex issue, though not formally opened, have been definitely envisaged, and that while this is the position it would be premature and entirely unreasonable to suggest a reference to a third party. 1 am, &amp;c..

Please submit at the earliest possible moment, in consultation with the local military authorities, appreciation of the situation arising from the Chinese incursion, with particular reference to the necessity for defence of the frontier by (a) civil armed forces, (6) military, in the event of penetration proceeding to the extent suggested in your telegram quoted above. 3. Government of India would much prefer that troops should not be moved to forward areas without prior reference to themselves and to His Majesty's Govern ment. There still seems hope that settlement may be effected by diplomatic methods, but difficulties of this will be greatly enhanced if military operations between forces of the British and Chinese Governments are commenced. They therefore trust that troops will not be involved unless you, in consultation with the military authorities, decide that it is essential to employ them to maintain our position west of the Liuchen Line.

Our appreciation of situation is as follows : Position of frontier has been in dispute for many years, Chinese claiming Liuchen Line and British Government claiming Scott Line. Chinese now appear to be putting forward claim to whole '■0\ s&gt; Q ' S ^0*23 of Wa States, and it may be that Chinese authorities either at Nankins or Ynnnnn are acqmescmg m, if not acttvely promoting, incursions to west Liuchef 1 iae with subsequent negotiations for delimitation of frontier. Su^rUtion^is ^aUy . ® 1 ^ tlon . however, still extremely obscure, and since any semblance of war With Ohma .S obviously undesirable, we are anxious to avoid precipitate military 3. Immediate action therefore recommended is the strongest possible diplomatic protest at Nanking, both against the Chinese occupation of the disputed zoue and against the violation of the Liuchen Line. Should this protest fail to secure the withdrawal of the Cnmese forces, if any now west of the Liuchen Une or to prevent further incursions, it will be necessary for His Majesty's Government o decide what policy we and the Burma Government should adopt. For the present we are as far as possible, adopting purely defensive attitude with the Military Police, but it may become impossible to maintain such attitude if the ChineS troops come ^ force into the area between the Liuchen Line and the Salween R°ver and raise the Wa tribes against us. mver Alternatives then open to us would be either to restore the position by the use of troops or to withdraw entirely to selected line west of Liuchen Line.

Telegram from Government of Burma to Government of India, dated §th June 1934. {Repeated to Secretary of State for India.) ,, ^ Referenceyour telegram of the 6th instant, 1319 (No. 46). My telegrams lb (No. 43) and /6 (No. 44), dated 5th June, contain full appreciation of imme- diate situation, which has concurrence of the military authorities, and is supplemented by military appreciation contained in Burma District's 6598-G dated to-day, m which this Government concurs. Only additions to be made 'are as lollows:— (1) Our Military Police forces are at present confined to the defensive by laige Chinese forces, which according to reliable information are threatening to attack, and are unable at present to deal with Chinese penetration into our States west of Liuchen Line, referred to in my 75 (No. 43) and 76 (No. 44), and also 72 (No. 42), dated 4th June. If this penetration goes on, and, still more, if it develops into menace to our communications, and to Shan States, immediate necessity will arise for military action. Precise immediate situation, therefore/appears to be that our Military Police posts at Lufang and Hopang are threatened with attack by superior numbers, and there is further possibility of Chinese penetration causing turmoil in our Wa States, which would threaten both maintenance of the civil and military authorities' position in these States and also the peace of the Shan States bordering on Wa States, and would be beyond the power of our Military Police forces to deal with, unless threat from Chinese forces, at present reported in opposition to them, is diminished or removed. Necessity for immediate military action may, therefore, arise either (a) from disaster to any of our Military Police forces or necessity of relieving them in case of investment, or reinforcing them should their position become critical, or (h) from development of Chinese penetration, or (c) from both.11: 21 (2) Except for one section of guns, troops are not being moved to forward areas.

Minister, Peking, to lodge strong protest with Chinese Government is being repeated to you. 2. Our policy must be :— (i) To continue for the present to refrain from any extension of our commit ments and from crossing the Liuchen Line, or taking any action against Chinese forces on the east of that line. (ii) To take all possible steps to protect positions and communications of our military police forces, and so far as possible to preserve control of areas which w 7 e have entered, and of Wa States on the west of the Liuchem Line, with wdiich we have established friendly relations. (iii) So far as military situation permits, to resist by force any attempts by Chinese troops to cross the Liuchen Line. 3. It is consequently very desirable that all possible steps which are considered necessary for the above purposes should be taken to reinforce our military police forces in the Hopang-Lufang areas, with a view at any rate to reducing to a minimum risk of disaster to our forces through investment by superior Chinese forces, or through a general rising in the Wa States stirred up by Chinese intrigue. I note that one section of guns is to be sent to operations area and that Burma Rifles are to move to Lashio to relieve maximum number of Military Police there for reinforcing our columns. Please telegraph existing strength of Military Police in the operations area and number of reinforcements on their way. If ^ | s considered necessary and desirable to move regulars into the operations area, this will not increase difficulties of a settlement of the dispute by diplomatic methods, since if Chinese cross the Liuchen Line in force and attack our columns they will in any case put themselves in the wrong and it will make no difference diplomati cally whether they are opposed by civil armed forces or by regulars. Y r ou should therefore make all the preparations which you consider necessary to meet such an. eventuality.25 4. I suggest that officer in command of the expedition should send messages to the commanders o C iinese tioops at Manchiu and Mengchang and any other nlace where threatening concentrations may be reported, to the effect that (a) discussions regarding disputed frontier and the present situation are in progress between H .S Majesty's Goyernment and the Chinese Goyernment and that the I rovmcial Goyernment of Yunnan is being informed of these CllSC tl SolOXIs ^ (h) while these negotiations are in progress our forces will not cross a specified hne (corresponding to the Linchen Line), which is the extreme limit of the Uninese (jrovernment s claim ; (c) we consider that similarly pending negotiations Chinese forces should not cross bcott Line, which we claim; and (d) in any case, if Chinese forces cross the Liuchen Line, this will be an act of aggression which will be forcibly resisted. 5. Similar messages might perhaps be sent to any Chinese officers who have penetrated into our W a States. No. 51. P.Z. 3915/34. Telegram from Foreign Office to Sir A.

You should immediately protest in the strongest possible terms to the Chinese Government regarding this unprovoked aggression by Chinese uniformed and presumably regular forces. You should state that these forces have penetrated deep into British territory west of the Scott Line, laying special emphasis on the fact that bodies of troops have been located even to the west of the Liuchen Line, which our expedition has scrupulously refrained from crossing, and have come into conflict with the Burma Military Police in the area to the west of that line. You should suggest that it is essential in order to avoid further incidents that immediate orders should be given for withdrawal of all bodies of troops that have crossed the bcott Line, failing which the Chinese Government must take the responsibility for the consequences and His Majesty's Government would naturally consider themselves free to take such action as they considered necessary or desirable. Protests should also be made against the occupation by the Chinese of the zone between the Scott and Liuchen Lines and the intrigues carried on among our tribesmen to the west of the Liuchen Line. It should be stated that the Chinese occupation of the disputed zone can in no way prejudice the British claim to the territory up to the Scott Line. 4. In regard to the despatch by the Chinese Government of an exploring party reported in your telegrams Nos. 38 and 39 Tour (No. 35), you should make representations to the Chinese Governmeut in the following sense:— 5. While the Chinese Government do not admit, and His Majesty's Government claim, the Scott Line, His Majesty's Government do not admit the Chinese claim to the Liuchen Line, and, as His Majesty's Government have scrupulously refrained from crossing the latter out of consideration for the status quo of 30 years' standing m this region, it is reasonable to expect the Chinese, out of a similar consideration, to refrain from crossing the Scott Line. The despatch of the party proposed b} 7 the Chinese Government could only give rise to serious difficulties and postpone, perhaps indefinitely, a friendly settlement of the disputed frontier. If the Chinese Goyernment proceed with their proposal it will, of course, be necessary for His Majesty's Government to retain complete liberty of action, and the Chinese Govern ment will appreciate the difficulties likely to arise if exploratory missions were to he despatched by both sides. 6. On the question of the potential mineral value of this area—of which apparently the Chinese have exaggerated notions—you may assure the Nanking Government, in such manner and at such time as you think fit, that the recent mining investigations carried out by the Burma Corporation's experts in areas 3435 D26 west of the Liuchen Line have yielded only negative results, from which they are satisfied that the neighbouring areas also do not offer any more favourable prospects than those investigated. 7. You should go on to point out that the dispute regarding the frontier is of long stamliog, and can only be satisfactorily settled by an agreed delimitation, such as the Chinese Government have already suggested. His Majesty's Govern ment are quite prepared to agree to this, and would, of conise, adopt a^ reasonable attitude on all points in dispute, but they consider that as a first step it is necessary to settle the principles which should underlie a delimitation, and therefore suggest that these should first be discussed at Nanking with representatives of His Majesty's Government and the Government of Burma. It would, oi course, be essential that representatives of the Government of Yunnan should be associated with the discussions from the outset. When once principles had been settled, a joint commission could, if necessary, be sent to demarcate the frontier on the spot. But to send an advance party before an agreement on principles has been reached would, apart from the other objections already referred to, be a mere waste of effort and unlikely to lead to any satisfactory result. The essential points are to settle the governing principles for a delimitation of the frontier, and, until this has been done, to avoid any interference with the status quo. His Majesty's Government feel confident that, on further reflection, the Chinese Government will agree with this view, and will let His Majesty's Government have early proposals for consideration. 8. You should not yourself mention the question of a reference of the boundary question to the League of Nations, but if the Chinese raise and press this question you should emphasise that direct negotiations on this highly complex issue, though not formally opened, have been definitely envisaged, and that while this is the 1 position it would be premature and entirely unreasonable to suggest a reference to a third party. 9. If you consider it desirable that Consul-General at Yunnanfu should take similar and simultaneous action, please instruct him accordingly. No. 52. P.Z. 3852/34.

Policy laid down in paragraph 2 (2) and (3) may leave you in some doubt as to immediate action to be taken by you with regard to Chinese troops, if any, who have already crossed the Liuchen Line.

No. 55. P.Z. 5056/34. Note from Mr. Holman to His Excellency Mr. Wang Ching-wei, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Nanking, dated Wth June 1934. Sir, With reference to recent correspondence exchanged between Your Excellency and myself on the subject of the southern section of the undelimited Burma-Yunnan frontier, I have the honour to bring to Your Excellency's attention the very serious situation which has now arisen in that area. Reports received since the end of May prove conclusively that Chinese troops and officials have not only been active in the zone between the Liuchen and Scott Lines, but that they have also penetrated into British Wa States, west of the former line. Thus, at the end of May Chinese troops were reported to have arrived at Manchiu (Yakou) between the Scott and the Liuchen Lines. Subsequently uniformed and presumably regular Chinese troops were actually found entrenched on the Panglao Ridge in British territory. These troops opened fire on a force of the Burma Military Police. Later on Chinese troops were seen on the road to Chingshan in British territory north of Lufang. Since receipt of these earlier reports of the presence of Chinese troops west of the Liuchen Line further bodies of Chinese have been active in other British Wa States to the west of Panglao, including Mankwei and Yungpang. There is also conclusive evidence of Chinese intrigues among the tribes in British territory in this area. In the light of the circumstances set forth above, I have the honour, under instructions from His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to lodge the strongest possible protest with the Chinese Government regarding this unprovoked aggression by Chinese uniformed and presumably regular forces, which have penetrated deep into British territory west of the Scott Line. I have to lay special emphasis on the fact that bodies of Chinese troops have been located even to the west of the Liuchen Line, which the British expedition has scrupulously refrained from crossing, and that these bodies of troops have come into conflict with the Burma Military Police in the area to the west of that line. It is, therefore, essential, in order to avoid further incidents, that immediate orders should be given for the withdrawal of all bodies of Chinese troops that have crossed the Scott Line, failing which the Chinese Government must take the responsibility for the consequences, and His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom will naturally consider themselves free to take such action as they consider necessary or desirable. 1 am also instructed to protest against the occupation by Chinese authorities of the zone between the Scott and Liuchen Lines, and against the intrigues which have been carried on among our tribesmen to the west of the Liuchen Line ; and I am ' Not printed; the full text of the Note, as presented, is No. 55.to add that this Chinese occupation of the disputed zone can m no way prejudice the British claim to territory up to the Scott Line. I have further the honour to refer to the information conveyed to me by the Vice- Minister for Foreign Affairs at the Wai Chiao Pu on 14th May, when Mr. Hsu Mo stated that the Chinese Government were sending a mission of enquiry to study conditions in the disputed area on the spot, and that this party would be instructed to cross the Scott Line. It will be recalled that, speaking personally, I strongly -deprecated the issue of instructions to this party to cross the Scott Line, and stated that I feared that any such action might seriously prejudice negotiations for frontier delimitation, such as the Chinese Government appeared to desire. 1 am now instructed by my Government to state that, while the Chinese Government do not admit and His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom claim the Scott Line, His Majesty 's Government in the United Kingdom do not admit the Chinese -claim to the Liuchen Tine, and that, as His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have been scrupulously refraining from crossing the latter line out of consideration for the status quo of 30 years' standing in this region, it is reasonable to expect the Chinese Government, out of similar consideration, to refrain •from crossing the Scott Line. The despatch of a party across the Scott Line proposed by the Chinese Government can only give rise to serious difficulties and postpone, perhaps indefinitely, a friendly settlement of the disputed frontier. Moreover, 1 have the honour to point out that, if the Chinese Government proceed with their proposal, it will, of course, be necessary for His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom to retain complete liberty of action, and the Chinese Government will appreciate the difficulties likely to arise if the explorative missions are to be despatched by both sides. 1 am further instructed to observe that the dispute regarding the Burma- Yunnan frontier is of long standing and can only be satisfactorily settled by an agreed delimitation such as the Chinese (Government have already suggested. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom are fully prepared to agree to this suggestion, but they consider, as a first step, that it is necessary to settle the principles which should underlie a delimitation ; and they therefore suggest that these principles should first be discussed at Nanking with representatives of His Majesty's Government and the Government of Burma. It is assumed that repre sentatives of the Provincial Government of Yunnan, as the responsible local authorities immediately concerned, would be associated with these discussions from the outset. When once the principles have been settled, a Joint Commission can, if necessary, be sent to demarcate the frontier on the spot. But to send an advance party before an agreement on the principles has been reached is likely, apart from other objections, to prove a mere waste of effort and to lead to no satisfactory result. In the view of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, the essential points are to settle the governing principles for a delimitation of the frontier and, until this has been done, to avoid any inter ferences with the status quo. His Majesty's Government feel confident that on further reflection the Chinese Government will agree with this view and will put forward early proposals for their consideration. Awaiting the favour of an early reply, I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration. A. Holman, on behalf of His Majesty's Minister.

P.Z. 5458/34, Note from Wai Chiao Pu to His Majesty's Minister, Nanking, dated IQth June 1934. •Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of Your Excellency's Note dated . 1 regarding the question of the undemarcated southern section 01 the nurma-Yunnan frontier. I have the honour to observe that with regard to the questions as to whether or not the Yunnan Provincial Government had despatched olficials and troops to proceed to lan Hung and investigate, on receipt of His Majesty's Legation's Memorandum of the 2(jth April (No. 30) a memorandum was furnished in reply on the ^nd May stating that the exact circumstances were being investigated 4s to whether the military demonstration on the part of the British Burma authorities nacl or had not crossed the Yellow Line, a matter which was referred to in this Ministry s JNote dated the 2nd March, although Your Excellency on several occasions declared that no such action had taken place, yet definite proof is still lacking. In these circumstances, the Chinese Government, in order to do everything possible t( L ie ! a&lt; ^ 1 an entirely satisfactory arrangement, on the one hand resolved to despatch omcials to effect an investigation on the spot, so as to throw light on the true facts and facilitate the negotiation of a settlement, and on the other has despatched several telegrams to the Yunnan Provincial Government, instructing them that in the absence of the instructions of the Central Government they were not to despatch troops across the boundary, so as to avoid complications. Subsequently the Provincial Government reported by telegram that they had definitely not despatched troops across the Yellow Line, and even beyond the Red Line the Provincial forces also certainly could not unauthorisedly advance in the absence of instructions, Ihe above constitutes sufficient proof that the statement regarding the activities of Chinese troops in the area between the Yellow Line and the lied Line contained in the Note under acknowledgment is clearly not in accordance with the facts, and even more proves that the alleged transgression on the west side of the Yellow Line, the entrance effected into the British district of Ch'ia Wa, the construction of trenches and opening of rifle lire have absolutely no connection with Chinese troops. The protest against the invasion by Chinese troops contained in the Note under acknowledgment therefore cannot possibly be entertained. The Note under acknowledgment further referred to alleged 'intrigues and activities' on the west of the Yellow Line. I would observe that it being certain that the Yunnan forces have not crossed the Red Line, it is even more certain that taey have not advanced beyond the Yellow Line. As stated above, the fact that they cannot be guilty of any intrigues whatsoever is of course obvious. On the contrary, the Chinese for their part have received numerous reports to the effect30 that in the hostilities which broke out in the Panhnng area and the neighbourhood of the Yellow Line in general, armed ollicers and men ot niisJ] Burma were involved - nay more, it is said that the hostilities arose from no other cause than the improper activities o£ the above -mentioned armed forces. In these circum stances China can of course be in nowise held responsible if by reason of all manner of intrigues or oppression the various tribes m the locality are roused to take action in self-defence. It is therefore in a spirit of the utmost sincerity that 1 have the honour to request that His Majesty's Government will issue strict orders, to the British authorities and subjects on the Bui ma-1 unnan liontiei legion to desist from participating, whether directly or indirectly, m any activities of whatever nature that are capable of causing unfortunate complications, so as to secure undisturbed peace on the frontier between the two countries. With regard to the assertion contained in the Note under acknowledgment to the effect that Panlao, Lufang, Mankwei and lungpan are biitish teiritory, I have the honour to state that pending such time as the situation and liansliterated rendering of the various places on the frontier are ascertained with certainty, the Chinese Government must reserve the right to make claim to the said places as- Chinese sovereign territory. i • • To sum np, the intelligence reports received by China regarding tins incident would appear to be completely at variance with the news received by the British on the other. For this reason the Chinese Government are still first and last convinced of the necessity 7 of despatching officials to ascertain the real facts on the spot, so as to obtain materials to serve as the basis of a settlement of the present incident. This investigation is inspired entirely by goodwill, as I have on several occasions already declared, and I am consequently much perturbed that Great Britain on the contrary should be of the opinion that there is any risk of increasing the difficulties thereby. If peace and order in the area between the \ellowand Red Lines could, in fact, be immediately restored and the true facts be brought to light, there would be no objection to issuing orders that the present party of investigation which is already en route should for the time being not proceed further. But in the view of this Ministry, failing an exact investigation, it is much to be feared that difficulties would be unavoidable in the way of the completely satisfactory settlement of the boundary demarcation question which it is desired to achieve. 1 am much gratified at His Majesty's Government's expression of agreement with the Chinese Government's suggestion for the demarcation of the frontier, and this Ministry naturally agrees in principle with the suggestions in the Note under acknowledgment that the general principles for the demarcation of the frontier must first be discussed and settled, and that representatives of the Yunnan Provincial Government and of the Government of Burma should be associated in the discussions. But in order to achieve an entirely satisfactory settlement at an early date, the point to be regarded as of primary importance still remains that in accordance with international practice a survey should be made on the spot, so that the doubts and anxieties of both parties may be immediately resolved to the advantage of the frontier between the two countries. I have the honour to request the favour of a reply and avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration. W ang C hing -W ei.

It wonld be very diffionlt in any negotiations at Nanking to induce Chinese to yield now what they wonld not surrender 30 years ago, i.e. 1 should have little hope of inducing Chinese negotiators sitting over a map to accept anything like the Scott Line I also very much doubt whether it would be possible to discuss point at issue at Nanking with the least prospect of success on the basis of oolitical attachment of tribal groups existing in 1884. 3 It seems to me that best hope would be to get Chinese (1) to admit that basis of settlement is 189/ Convention (m this connection Chinese text of that Convention is vague and badly worded in its references to watershed and we should trv to ensure that its meaning is clearly understood to be that of English text) and (2) to agree on certain principles for delimitation on the ground of a 'line such as is defined m Convention, e.g. to agree to fix on the ground any of the points mentioned in Article o, paragraph 3, of Convention and to delimit on the ground the ' water- parting mentioned in that paragraph and ' mountain range ' referred to in succeeding paragraph. That is how I would interpret ' explore a basis of settle ment (see your telegram No. 236' ::: '). ^ con ^. S' etj such principle accepted in Nanking, there should be a possibility that a Sino-British Commission on the spot might produce a satisfactory line. It might be possible now to secure (two groups undecypherable) and trained surveyors who would have a less lofty disregard for geographical facts and conditions than had those who served on former occasions. It would, of course, be better if a neutral topographical expert could be attached to them to whom disputes could be referred, but you may think this would savour too much of arbitration. 5. I believe the less formal the negotiations at Nanking the more likely they are to succeed. Anything in the nature of a full-dress conference with inevitable Press publicity would make it much more difficult for the Chinese to make the least concession from their 1904 attitude. I venture therefore to suggest that, as a first step, I might be authorised to invite Waichiaopu to agree that basis of settle ment should be 1897 Convention and to attempt in consultation with them to clear up any possible misunderstandings that may exist in connection with Chinese text. This preliminary discussion might show whether there was any prospect of a conference at Nanking succeeding alomg the lines indicated under 2 above. It might also meet Waichiaopu desire for a preliminary meeting referred to in opening sentence of your telegram No. 236.* 6. We should presumably resist Waichiaopu's proposal for a preliminary 'survey,' see my telegram No. 469. 7. I think we should at the outset confine the discussions to Wa States section of frontier (unless Chinese desired otherwise) and ouly seek later if they developed favourably to extend them to other parts.

The telegram suggested the terms of the Note to the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs of 13th July (No. 60).32 been instmctGci by His Msjosty s r'nncipcil ScciGta-ry of StcitG foi 1 oiGigu Affairg to make the following further communication to His Excellency. As already stated in Sir Alexander Cadogan's Note of 11th June, His Majesty's Government consider that the principles undeilying the proposed frontier delimitation should, in the first instance, be discussed. It appears that all the parties concerned are anxious to arrive at a solution of these frontier disputes. The controversy has, however, such a long and complicated history behind it that the best procedure would seem to be to explore a basis of settlement by means of a conference at Nanking, in which representatives of the Governments of India and Yunnan could be associated with His Majesty's Legation and the Chinese Central Government. If the Chinese Government will agree to this procedure, His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom will take urgent steps to appoint representatives with the requisite local knowledge of the Burma side of the question to advise His Majesty's Legation. Pending the meeting of such a conference. His Majesty's Government trust that the Chinese Government will suspend the sending of a mission to the disputed area. His Majesty's Minister is instructed to add that according to the latest reports raids to the west even of the Liuchen Line are continuing, one having taken place on 8th June, and that there is evidence that these raiders have in some instances been accompanied by Chinese irregular troops or militia, who are still in the disputed area between the frontier claimed by His Majesty's Government and the line claimed by China. Sir Alexander Cadogan is further instructed to enquire whether steps have yet been taken by the Yunnan Provincial authorities to give effect to the instructions which His Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Mr. Holman on 11th June (No. 55) were being issued to withdraw all troops from west of the Liuchen Line and from the disputed area. His Majesty's Minister has the honour to urge in this connection that it should be made clear that these instructions apply to any local militia as well as to the regular forces. No. 61.

Burma-Yunnan frontier. 2. We agree with Minister that informal discussions on the lines of paragraph 3 of his telegram are likely to prove more useful than the formal negotiations originally suggested. We also agree, after consultation with Burma Government, that such discussions are essential to preliminary meeting of the Frontier Demarcation Commission. We therefore concur in deprecating premature visit of Chinese mission of enquiry, whose activities would probably cause further deterioration in the local position. 3. We must, however, point out that unless steps are taken to settle the boundary dispute and to confine the enemy forces to agreed Chinese territory by the time the rains cease, we shall almost inevitably be forced to undertake expensive and troublesome military operations, which may have to be extended east of Liuchen Line. Existing defensive inaction is imposed on us by weather conditions, hut when those improve we shall be compelled to adopt a more vigorous policy against Chinese aggressors in order to protect our friends and to maintain our political influence in the Wa States. We therefore trust that the preliminary discussions suggested maybe undertaken at once in order that meeting of Boundary Commission may take place as soon as possible after the rains have ceased. 4. We would also recommend that Chinese Government be told plainly that if Chinese forces, regular or irregular, continue aggressive action against us and our friends in the neighbourhood of the disputed frontier, we shall eventually have to take strong action against them (as soon as weather conditions permit). 5. Burma Government have suggested possibility of aerial survey over the disputed area as soon as visibility improves after the rains, and state that they have33 Tnog^^t thiSC0Uld be Carrled OUt With0Ut difficult y in ve ''y time and They are stroagly in favour o£ it as it will give both Governments valuable ideas of the actual lie of the country, mountain ranges and watershed. We have not had tune fuly to examine proposal and difficulties involved in carrying out such a survey of disputed area It would appear that Burma Government are perW optimistic both as regards time and cost. Provided that it is feasible, we commend proposal to His Majesty s Government for consideration, since results if successful should great y facilitate work of Boundary Commission. Chinese Note summarised m Peking te egram 469- appears to suggest 'survey on the spot,' so this proposal might appeal to them, inclining them to abandon mission of enquiry. No. 62. P.Z. 4744/;U.

I assume, however, that you agree that, as w r as contemplated in 1929, you should depute an officer from Burma to participate in conference. I agree that best tactics may be to base our case on wording of Convention of 1897, but as Scott's survey showed this does not correspond with features of the ground, and in any case it seems very desirable that Cadogan should be assisted by an officer with requisite local knowledge.

The Secretary of State observes that the Chinese Government in their latest j^ote* appear to agree that the general principles for a demarcation must first be discussed and settled in conference, but he finds it difficult to reconcile with this their apparent persistence in their plan for sending a preliminary mission of enquiry to the disputed area, lie agrees with Sir A. Cadogan that the latter proposal must be resisted It is clear that an ex parte investigation by the Chinese m the disputed zone which His Majesty's Government have scrupulously refrained from entering would be most objectionable, and he remains of opinion that, in the light of past experience, a joint investigation would be likely to be a waste of time unless the principles which should form the basis of demarcation have first been agreed upon by a conference of representatives of the two Governments. Unless the Nanking Government suspend their proposed mission of enquny, it may indeed prove useless to continue the negotiations. 3 Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare accordingly suggests that Sir A. Cadogan should now press further for the suspension of the Chinese mission (laying stress on the inadmissibility of a one-sided Chinese investigation in an area which is claimed by His Majesty's Government) and for discussion of principles m conference at .Nanking as a necessary prerequisite to a joint investigation and demarcation; and that he should also (taking note of the Yunnan Governments denial of the despatch of troops beyond the Scott Line) ask that effective steps be taken to secure the withdrawal of the volunteers, militia or other irregulars, or bandits, who are undoubtedly active in the disputed zone, failing which His Majesty s Government will clearly have the right and may be compelled to take all necessary measures to repel or prevent attacks on our police, or interference with our tribes, by such irresponsible bodies. 4. As regards the proposed conference, Sir Samuel Hoare agrees with Sir A. Cadogan and the Government of India that an informal procedure is to be preferred and that it is desirable to avoid publicity so far as possible. 5. The Secretary of State also agrees that as a first step preparatory to a conference Sir A. Cadogan might at once be authorised to take the action suggested in paragraph 5 of his telegram No. 477 (No. 59). If this succeeds, the next step would be for the Government of India, if they agree, to depute an officer from Burma to take part in the further discussions, and it will also be necessary to settle the precise instructions that should be given to the British delegates. In this connection Sir Samuel Hoare observes that the three points of latitude and longitude which appear to be referred to in paragraph 3 of Sir A. Cadogan s telegram No. 477 (No. 59) formed the basis of the Scott Line. Moreover, the Salween-Mekong watershed does not correspond to the line between the first two of these three points and would be even more favourable to Burma. In these circumstances he does not quite understand the statement in paragraph 2 ot &lt;Sir A. Cadogan's telegram that he would have little hope of inducing the Chinese negotiators to accept anything like the Scott Line. He agrees,^ however, that the best tactics may be to take the actual wording of the Convention of 189/ as the starting point in the discussions of the Conference, and that this would he a satisfactory basis for agreement provided that the Chinese do not base exaggerated .claims on the second paragraph of Article 6 (which appears to contemplate merely minor modifications, by mutual agreement, of the general line prescribed by Article 3 of the Convention). But it will be seen from a perusal of Sir G. bcotts Report that during the previous demarcation it was found difficult to apply some of the descriptions in the Convention to the actual features of the ground, owing to the fact that no survey had been made at the time when the Convention was concluded. It was for this reason that it was previously suggested that the Britis desiderata should be based on the spirit of the Convention and the old pohtica status quo, i.e. the position indicated by the approximate boundaries between homogeneous groups of tribes and their political attachments during the P er10 1886-97. The difficulty above referred to is one of the elements which make t e case so confused and intricate, and which make it desirable that the Bntis delegation at a conference should include an officer with local knowledge. is enclosed of a telegram which is being addressed to the Government of In ia on this point (No. 63). 6. Paragraph 3 of the telegram of 18th July (No. 61) from the Government of India is under consideration and it may be necessary to consult them further m regard to it.35 7. As regards paragraph 5 of the Government of India 's telegram. His Maiesty V Government might await further information from them as to the feasihilftv of aa aerial survey before reaching a decision on that suggestion and on the communication, if any, which should be addressed to the Chinese Government on the subject.

I would be grateful for details regarding your reference to expensive military operations as being almost inevitable after the rains if progress of negotiations at Nanking is then unsatisfactory. Recent experience seems to indicate that Military Police are able to protect Was, with whom we have entered into relations from attacks by Chinese irregulars and bandits. I recognise that if these attacks increase and we have to take the offensive against the enemy so as to deal with him adequately, or if Chinese infiltration and intrigue were successful in stirring up friendly Was against us, it might then be necessary to reinforce the Police, replacing those taken from internal security duties by regulars, and also that the possibility of latter being required to support the Police in the forward areas cannot be altogether excluded. But 1 should have thought it not improbable that Military Police will be sufficient for objects of our policy and even for any temporary action that might be sanctioned across the Liuchen Line in pursuit of raiders or to clear out nests of bandits, &amp;c., and would be glad of your views in this respect. 3. Position might be different if you contemplated not only protection of friendlies in north-western quarter of Wa States, but also extension of control to southern Wa States west of Liuchen Line. Is any such plan under consideration ? 4. As regards paragraph 5 of your telegram, I will await further report on feasibility of aerial survey, idea of w T hich is prima facie attractive, though I have not yet consulted Foreign Office and question of giving prior notice to Chinese Government might have to be considered. * Not printed.

Telegram froTTi Government of Burma to Government of India, dated 2nd August 1934. {Bepeated to Secretary of State for India.) 115. Burma Government notes that the Secretary of State s observations are oased on the supposition that the present situation will be indefinitely piolonged, id est, that our forces will have to deal only on limited front with irregulars and bandits, attacking them whenever possible when raiding into our territory, and keeping order in our sphere of influence, our forces being contined to Liuchen Line except possibly for purely temporary action, requiring special sanction to cross the line in pursuit of the raiders or to deal with nests of bandits. Government of Burma agree that {sic) so long as the present conditions continue and there is no serious increase in the enterprise or pressure of hostile forces. . . Military Police can adequately control the situation, but our frontier battalions provide only necessary minimum for frontier defence with reserves no more than sufficient for frontier requirements, and, incidentally, the expenditure utilised for internal security and force contains no provision for the maintenance of force approaching 900 strong in the Wa States. The necessity for maintaining the present Military Police force in the Wa States involves serious subtraction therefore from force available and intended to be utilised for ordinary requirements, and its -continuance must necessarily embarrass the Local Government generally and the Military Police administration in particular. Regular troops cannot suitably take over function of frontier battalions, partly because their organisation, &amp;c., is unsuitable and parti} 7 because military authorities could not contemplate occupation of small outposts by regular troops which is one of the main functions of the Military Police. I^ocal Government cannot therefoie face with equanimity continuance even of the present situation, which, moreover, imposes substantial expenditure on provincial funds which the Local Government cannot afford and which, in the Local Government's opinion, is not a proper charge on provincial funds. Should present position materially worsen, id est, by appearance against us of substantially increased forces, our present force in the field would have to be increased and, in Local Government's view, increase would have to be found from regular troops as the Military Police cannot spare farther reinforcements for the Wa States. Possibility cannot be ignored that hostile action, even if only by irregulars and bandits, might be taken against Burma anywhere on extended border between Burma and Yunnan, and, in view of this contingency, it is more than ever indispensable that frontier battalions should be in position and in sufficient strength to guard our marches. As pointed out above, this duty cannot effectively be taken over by troops. It is quite out of the question, moreover, for Burma Government to meet, from provincial funds, any further increased expenditure in Wa States. A fortiori, if action on any considerable scale should be necessary against hostile forces, or if necessity should arise of occupying territory east of the Liuchen Line, task would be clearly beyond the powers of the Military Police. Presumably, the Government of India have in mind the fact that if Nanking negotiations were to37 fail and the British Government acquiesced in the maintenance of present de facto position, it would virtually mean the abandonment of all territorial claims east of the Liuchen Line. 3. Local (government s policy is still, as it has been from the start, opposed to any avoidable extension of administrative liability, and there is no intention to extend control to the southern \\ a States west of the Liuchen Line unless this is forced on us either by Chinese attempts to conquer or absorb these States or by the necessity of punishing attacks by them on the northern friendly States under our administration. Our policy is to cultivate friendly relations with the southern States, and no doubt such friendly relations must lead in time to some form of responsibility and contiol, but this lies in the future, and present policy is that contact should be limited strictly to friendly relations not involving administration.

Your telegram of the 21st ultimo, 1832 (No. 63). 2. Following are Burma's comments :— ' 1701. Burma Government is not clear as to the precise form of assistance desired to be given to Cadogan by officer from Burma. If deputed officer is to be able to give Cadogan authoritative advice regarding Burma Government frontier policy and whether any particular proposals are likely to commend themselves to Burma Government, he must be senior. On the other hand, if intention merely is to provide Cadogan with an officer acquainted with facts of frontier tribes and custom relations with trans-frontier Chinese authorities, &amp;c., probably suitable frontier service officer could be found, but he could not commit Local Government to any decisions. As regards Wa States themselves, in recent years policy has been to treat them as out of bounds, and our frontier officers have no first-hand know ledge of the Wa States and tribes in them, except in so far as this has been acquired since the expedition went out. G. E. Barton, referred to in our Despatch No. B. 33, dated 4th November 1933, has probably the best actual knowledge of the Wa States and is expert cartographer, but he is, of course, not official. If indication can be given of the character of assistance required, this Government will be glad to depute the best officer it can provide, but presumes that expendi ture will be debitable to the Foreign Office.' 3. We have now had the advantage of appreciating your views as set out in India Office letter to Foreign Office, 21st July, P.Z. 4737/34 (No. 64). We agree that a most important desideratum is that British delegation at conference should include officer with local knowledge and possibly technical knowledge ■of surveying Barton would appear to be best suited for this purpose, and, subject to the views of Cadogan and of the Burma Government, we should be inclined to recommend him if he is willing and available. At the same time, Barton is not an official, and as laid down in your telegram of 26th May last, 1379 (No. 36), it has from the beginning been considered essential that representatives of Burma 'Government should be associated with discussions from the outset. Moreover, the interpretation of Article 3 and more particularly 6 of the 1897 Convention will necessarily involve political and tribal, no less than geographical, considerations, likely at any time to raise questions of frontier policy. 4. For this reason, if dela}' is to be avoided it would seem to be essential that our representatives would have acquaintance with the Burma Government frontier policy and be capable of giving authoritative answers to such questions. It is improbable that officer of this standing can be found who also possesses adequate local and technical knowledge, and we therefore think our delegates should consist of senior official chosen bv Burma Government accompanied by Barton or Burma it rentier Officer as assistant. \\ e are confirmed in this view by consideration that,if Yunnan Government is to be represented, attendance of one of our officers of standing equal to Chinese local representative will become even more necessary. 5. We a&lt; r ree that expenditure involved should not fall entirely on Local Governments matter is one of Imperial interest, but m view of the urgency of the question we suggest allocation of the cost might be left foi future adjustment in consultation with you.

Teichman's Interview with Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs on 6th August 1934. After explaining that 1 had come to Nanking to initiate by preliminary and informal discussions the proposed negotiations for a settlement of the V* a States frontier question, I opened the conversation by giving the following summary of the history of the case, requesting Mr. Hsu Mo to correct me if there was anything I said in which he did not concur. The section of the frontier in question was undelimited, but its description was laid down in Article III of the Anglo -Chinese- Agreement of 1897, The Boundary Commission which was provided for in the said Agreement had met in 1900 but had failed to reach any agreement. There had been no joint survey of the ground in the field, each side had produced their own maps which did not agree with one another, and the only result had been that each side had claimed a frontier line some miles apart from the other. (I purposely refrained in this summary from introducing any controversial points about the merits of the respective claims of the two sides, e.g. that our line was the nearest possible line to the Treaty frontier while the Chinese line was based on imaginary geographical features and ignored the alignment laid down in the Treaty.) Thereafter, the position on the frontier had remained dormant for 30 odd years the39 neighbourhood--i.e. the Wa States region-was ' unadministered territory' both as Mgards Burma and Yunnan ; so that there had been no occasion for either side ?n penetrate there. It &gt;vas, however, known that there were old silver mines in the ne.ghbourhood, and recently early this year, we had sent a geological mL on to investigate the mineral possibilities on our side of the disnnterl A 0 « of fact this party had satisfied themselves that the minerals of the region were not commercially exploitable and had withdrawn. But as it was unsafe for anyone Bntish or Chinese to penetrate into unadministered territory without armed protection, they haa been accompanied by a small force of Military Police It was the presence of these police apparently which had caused all the alarm and excitement on the Chinese side and had led to the allegations that we had violated the disputed frontier; while we on our side had to complain of Chinese incursions into and beyond the disputed aiea. The Chinese Government had then proposed that we should enter on negotiations for a settlement and joint demarcation of the frontier His Majesty s Government had agreed, but had suggested preliminary negotiations at Nanking to settle the principles for the actual delimitation. To this the Chinese Government had in turn agreed, and we had now met to discuss informally these preliminary negotiations. 2. The \ ice-Minister for Foreign Affairs accepted this statement of the case as correct, but referred to the activities of our Militarv Police as havino- provoked disturbances amongst the local tribes and thus led to the subsequent complications. I denied that there had been any trouble with the tribesmen on our side of the disputed area, and pointed oat that what we did in British unadministered territory on our side of that area was^ no^ more the concern of the Chinese than what the Chinese authorities did on their side of the disputed area was any concern of ours. Moreover, the point to which our expedition had penetrated in unadministered territory on our side of the frontier was only some 20 miles from British administered territory, so that the whole nature of the expedition has been grossly exaggerated. (But I puiposely at this stage steered die discussion away from those controversial points, because we know from experience that once one joins issue with Mr. Hau Mo on a matter which has to be pressed home against him, it is hopeless to expect to get any results from the discussion.) 3. Before proceeding further, I suggested to Mr. Hsu Mo that we should begin by discussing the matters at issue on a personal basis, that is to say, on the under standing that any proposals we might make and discuss would be personal ones, and subject to reference to higher authority on each side. In this way we should be able at the outset to explore the best methods of dealing with the question at issue fully and frankly and without commitment on either side as a first step to more formal negotiations later on when we had discovered the best line to follow. This was what we had done, not unsuccessfully, in the many previous negotiations 'we had conducted together. Mr. Hsu Mo fully concurred. 4. I then suggested that we should take text of the Treaty, rather than the various maps and lines of the past, as the basis for our discussion at this stage. In the past each side had produced its own maps, in which the other side did not believe, so that they got nowhere in so far as reaching any agreement was ■concerned. But whatever the maps might say and whatever divergencies they might produce, the meaning of the Treaty text was clear enough, namely, that the frontier was defined by the three co-ordinated geographical points and the watershed. 5. In the course of the ensuing discussion about the Treaty text, Mr. Hsu Mo pointed out that the trouble was that the Treaty text was at variance with the maps (which is true enough, seeing that at least one of the co-ordinated points is off the watershed and that the name ' Kong-Ming-Shen,' if such a range exists at all where we place it, is wrongly transliterated). In due course, however, he accepted my view that we should take the Treaty text as the basis of our discussion, but proceeded to put his finger on one of its weak points, namely, the question of the whereabouts of the Kong-Ming-Shen. The Chinese side had, he insisted, never receded from their position that the Kung-Ming-Shen (of the Chinese text) was in quite a different place and much further west than the Kong-Ming-Shen of our Treaty map. 1 had expected this and pointed out in reply that it was obvious to any reasonable person that the fixed geographical points and the watershed were the governing factors in the Treaty text and that the mention of the Kong-Ming-Shenwas only incidental. Moreover, if points 'B' and 'C' were fixed the frontier could best be laid down along the most direct and appropriate line between them, without reference to the various conjectural Kong or Kung-Ming-Shens of the old maps ; and in any case once these points were fixed the line joining them could not possibly go anywhere near the alleged position of the Chinese Kung-Ming-Shen. (But I anticipate that the Kong-Ming-Shen question may be our main obstacle.) 6. Mr. Hsu Mo went on to observe that it was all very well to talk of fixing a watershed, but that to do so in the field might not be so easy. 1 concurred, but pointed out that having fixed the three points on the watershed it should not be difficult with reasonable good will on both sides to agree on a line approximately along the watershed between them. The distances were moreover comparatively short—it was only a matter of 30 to 50 miles from point to point; and it seemed unreasonable to make such heavy weather of the business, once the points were fixed. 7. At one stage in the discussion Mr. Hsu Mo referred to the Treaty map. I said that was of course a most valuable adjunct to the Treaty, but it was merely illustrative aud little more than a sketch. I reminded him that the troubles of the 1900 Boundary Commission largely arose from the fact that our side produced the Treaty map and the Chinese side an entirely different and fictitious one. 8. Continuing on the subject of the watershed aud my arguments that it was in fact the Treaty frontier, Mr. Hsu Mo enquired where, in our view, disputed States such as Panghung would be found to be in relation to the watershed. 1 replied that different maps might put it (Panghung) in different places, and it might be that it straddled the watershed ; but in any case Panghung was not mentioned in the Treaty text; and 1 suggested that we should do better to confine our discussions to that text at the present stage. No progress was likely to be made by each side referring to their own maps, which did not agree with one another. If, however, we could arrange to produce a joint map, detailed discussions of place names and their positions would have some basis. Tn 1900 the Chinese Government bad no trained surveyors, or at least did not send them to the frontier. Nowadays, Chinese topographers were as good as those of any other country. Therefore, it seemed much better to try and fix the Treaty frontier first, or at any rate decide where the Treaty meant it to be by its geographical definitions. Any necessary adjustments could then, if really desirable, be made on account of disputed places like Panghung. 9. Mr. Hsu Mo seemed eventually to come round to the view that we should, in these preliminary discussions, confine ourselves to the Treaty text, and said that he entirely agreed that the ideal solution would be to agree on joint instruction to a Joint Boundary Commission drawn up in the simplest terms compatible with a clear interpretation of the Treaty text. I thereupon handed him, as a purely personal suggestion of my own, the attached draft outline (see Sub-Legation Savingram to Peking, No. 29) of such an agreed interpretation of the Treaty text. The final sentence, concerning the correction and fixing of the co-ordinated points at the nearest suitable point on the watershed if they were found to lie off it, had been purposely omitted from the original, for fear of rousing suspicion, and was written in on the spot as being a further point which had emerged from our discussion. 10. Mr. Hsu Mo said he would like a day or two to consider our conversation and this paper and would let me know as soon as he was ready to resume the discussions. 11. At a suitable point in the discussion I introduced the question of the Chinese text of Article III of the 1897 Agreement (which is not particularly good or easy to understand). I said, when we had some point under discussion, that 1 had most carefully studied not only the English but also the Chinese text and could find no material divergence. Did he, Mr. Hsu Mo, agree? He concurred, and as we had been working, without his raising any objections, exclusively on the English text, I did not pursue the matter of the Chinese text any further. 12. towards the end of the interview the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs was called from the room, and in the course of conversation with Dr. Liu, Head of41 the European and American Department of the Ministry, who was also nrp^nt r enquired where the Cbmese Mission of Enquiry, which was to visit, the frontL now was, and nrged very strongly the desirability of stopping them from entering the disputed area, and the dangers of serious complications if they did so Dr I m at once replied that the Mission, which was already in Yunnan, would enter the disputed area now that negotiations had been begun. When Mr. Hsu Mo returned to the room I took up this matter with him. He remarked that he did not know why we were so disturbed about this Mission. I replied that it was because Mr. Hsu Mo hac imself told His Majesty's Minister that it would enter the disputed area, i.e. cross the Scott Line. If so, we on our side should naturally reserve full liberty of action, and it required very little imagination to realise the very serious dangers wmcn would arise ii both sides sent separate Missions of Enquiry into the disputes aiea. Moreover, such separate Missions of Enquiry could only brino - back more ex par^e maps and information. What was wanted was a joint enquiry and in the meanwhile we should do all we could to keep the atmosphere favourable to negotiation, i bis would certainly not be the case if we both sent Missions of Enquiry ' into the disputed area. However, I was glad to learn from Dr Liu that the Chinese Mission would not now enter the disputed area. Could I report this as an authoritative statement to His Majesty's Minister ? Mr. Hsu Mo nodded and said that the Chinese Mission would not enter the disputed area pendino- further instructions, and he intimated that they had, in fact, been held up because negotiations had begun. In the course of further conversation on this subiect he fully agreed that it was proper and reasonable that neither side should enter the disputed area while the negotiations were in progress. 13. In conclusion I took up the question of the activities of the Chinese irregulars in the disputed areas and their raids into British territory beyond. I gave the A ice-Minister for Foreign Affairs the substance of Foreign Office telegram No. 25(3 containing instructions to His Majesty's Minister to make further strong representations on this subject, and emphasised the point that, unless a stop were put to the activities of these irregulars, we should be compelled to take the necessary measures to deal with them ourselves. In reply, Mr. Hsu Mo referred to the repeated denials of the Chinese Government and the provincial authorities in \ unnan that any Chinese troops had been sent to the frontier and to the many telegrams which had been sent to 1 unnan on the subject. He intimated that he did not see what more could be done. I said that there probably were further steps that could be taken locally to secure the complete withdrawal of these bands, whoever they might be, to the Chinese side of the disputed area, and urged very strongly that in the interests of all concerned such steps should be taken without delay.

Record of Sir Eric Teichmaris Interview with Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs on Qth August 1934. (Reference, record of interview on 6th August 1934 (No. 72).) At the invitation of the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs we resumed our discussions at the Wai Chiao Pu on 9th August. At the outset Mr. Hsu Mo explained that, in accordance with our mutual understanding, his observations were to be taken as representing his personal views only. (Actually they may no doubt be taken to represent the views of the Wai Chiao Pu departments concerned.) 2. The Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs then proceeded to make a long •■statement, most of which was read out from typed notes. He had carefully -considered the points which had emerged from our earlier discussion and ray tentative and personal proposal, and he had come to the conclusion that the result of demarcating the frontier in accordance therewith would be a line approximating to the Scott Line, which would not be acceptable to the Chinese Government, who, as we were aware, had for more than 30 years refused to accept this line as the frontier. (I refrained from interrupting him by pointing out that this remark- that my proposal to follow the text of the Treaty would produce the Scott Line- was in itself an admission of the correctness of that line.) 3. Continuing, the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs said that there were, in his opinion, certain definite points about the Treaty text which made it difficult if not impossible to use it as a strict basis for demarcating the frontier. In the first place it would, according to all available Chinese information, be impossible to locate ' the line of the water parting between the tributaries of the Salween and Mekong Rivers,' which did not, in fact, exist in the localities in question. (In the course of the subsequent discussion I challenged this statement, and, while admitting that it might in places be difficult to locate the watershed, I insisted that it must be possible in a mountainous region lying between two large rivers to find an approxi mate watershed somewhere ; at one stage in the discussion Dr Liu, who was again assisting the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, observed that in the neighbourhood, for instance, of my point ' A ' there were no tributaries of the Mekong, so that it would be impossible to find the Treaty watershed there.) 3 id) The second point, continued the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, in which the definitions of the Treaty text were deficient and erroneous concerned the Kung-Ming-Shan. There was no such range where the Treaty text said it was located. In actual fact the Kung-Ming-Shan, which the Chinese Government regarded as the most important feature historically and geographically of the Treaty text, was located approximately at longitude 99.02 and latitude 22.55. 4. Thirdly, Mr. Hsu Mo pointed out. Article 6 of the Agreement of 1S97 recognised the vagueness and shortcomings of the Treaty text in that it provided that the frontier line should be verified and demarcated and, if found defective, corrected by a Joint Commission. It was to this provision that the Chinese Government now desired to revert in the forthcoming negotiations, which, it was suggested, might be guided by the following principles:— (i) The treaty provisions should be used by way of reference and not as a strict basis for discussion. (ii) The two parties should agree on certain geographical positions which would serve as cardinal points. (iii) In discussing the above positions, historical facts and political conditions should be taken into consideration. (iv) The Kung-Ming-Shan, the exact location of which should first of all be determined, would conveniently form one of the above geographical positions. (v) The negotiations should be conducted by both sides in a spirit of conciliation and compromise. 5. This last principle, Mr. Hsu Mo explained, was not intended to be an emptv phrase. If the British side would reciprocate and make concessions, the Chinese side would be fully prepared to do likewise and agree to the necessary compromises. , ...Vice-- ally t ' ie .

After the Vice-Mimster for Foreign Affairs had finished his statement r replied that I had careiujy noted all his points, but did not for a moment believe that negotiations conducted on such principles could possibly have any result nor that His Majesty s Government would be willing to enter on them unless the Treaty text was unequivocally accepted as the basis for the discussions and the Chinese claim to a Kung-Jiug-Shan 40 or Lit) miles from the treaty line was abandoned. In that case the frontier would have to remain unsettled, His Majesty's Government as heretofore maintaining their claim to the line laid down by the British Commis- eiouer in 1900. the status quo had lasted in this respect without anv serious, trouble for oO odd, years, and could, I supposed, very well continue indefinitely. Ihe Chinese Government had themselves suggested these boundary negotiations' but it they were not to be carried on in pursuance of the Agreement of 1897 thev could have no basis and could arrive at no result. The Chinese side obiected to the bcott Line, apparently because it was the Scott Line, but in reality their objections to it could only logically be based on its having been laid down cx parte. For iu 1900 the Chinese boundary commissioners had had no proper surveyors and no joint survey of the frontier bad been attempted. The Chinese Government could not thus summaril\ ieject a line, whatever it was called, if it were laid down jointly in accordance with the terms of the Agreement of 1897 without repudiating that Agreement. The Treaty text specifically defined certain fixed geographical points and the watershed. Was 1 to report to His Majesty's Minister that he, the Vice-Minister for Foieign Affairs, had told me that the Chinese Government repudiated the Agreement of 1897 and the definition of the frontier laid down therein ? 1. Mr. Hsu Mo seemed rather shaken by these arguments and said that the Chinese Government did not propose to repudiate the Treaty text and the co-ordinated points and the watershed, if the latter could be found ; but that it was a question of reconciling the Treaty definitions with geographical facts, with special reference to the Kung-Ming-Shan. We continued the discussion in general terms and I continued to insist that nothing could be done unless we adhered to the Treaty points and watershed and abandoned the Chinese Kung-Ming-Shan 40 to 50 miles off the Treaty line. 8. Finally the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs asked whether we could not devise some solution of the deadlock and enquired whether I thought the British side would be prepared to make any concessions, and, if so, of what kind. I replied, having the Scott compromise in mind, that I felt sure that once the Treaty line was established we should be prepared to make any necessary adjust ments to obviate the bisection of tribal statelets and villages. After some further discussion I threw out the tentative and personal suggestion that the Chinese Government should abandon their illogical and unreasonable claim to a Kung- Ming-Shan 40 minutes out of place and accept the Treaty points and definitions as the basis for the negotiations, on the understanding that we on our side would make certain concessions (e.g. the Scott compromise, which gives, inter aiiciy Panhung to China, but I did not mention any of this) once the line was laid down m accordance with the Treaty text. 9. The Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs seemed rather taken with this suggestion and we agreed that we should leave the matter at that point and adjourn the discussions pending further instructions from our respective superiors. Before leaving 1 summarised the results of our discussions, with Mr. Hsu Mo's concurrence, as follows :—We had met for preliminary discussions concerning the proposed negotiations which were to establish the principles for the demarcation of the frontier. I had suggested that these discussions should be based on, and seek an agreed interpretation of, the Treaty text in order that the frontier might be speedily and finally demarcated in accordance with its fixed points and other definitions. Mr. Hsu Mo had replied pointing out that my proposal would result m the frontier being demarcated along the Scott Line, which was unacceptable to the Chinese Government, that the Treaty text was largely incompatible w r ith geographical facts, and especially with the real position of the Kung-Ming-Shan, that it could therefore not be used as a strict basis for discussions, and that the Chinese Government considered that the frontier should be demarcated on the basis of the position ascribed by them to the Kung-Ming-Shan. I had in turn replied that such an attitude on the Chinese side amounted to a repudiation of the Treaty text and would, I believed, make all negotiation impossible. Finally, exploring a44 solution of the deadlock, we had tentatively considered the suggestion that the Chinese side should abandon their Kung-Ming-Shan and negotiate on the basis of the Treaty points and definitions, on the understanding that we on our side would, also make concessions and agree to any necessary adjustments once the 1 reaty line had been laid down. N otb ,—The position of the Kung-Ming-Shan of the Treaty text was the rock on which the boundary negotiations of 1900 were wrecked ; and the attitude of the Wai Chiao Pu as it has emerged from the above discussion, is the same as that of the Chinese negotiators of 34 years ago. The introduction into the Treaty text of the name ' Kong-Ming-Shan,'' by which we apparently meant a range known to us as the ' K'ung-Ming-Shan ' ( ), and its transliteration in the Chinese text as ' Kung-Ming-Shan ' ( ), have been the main cause of the trouble all along ; because the Chinese have throughout insisted that a range of this latter name exists at a point 40 minutes west of where our Kong-Ming-Shan is located in the Treaty text. Whatever the truth may be, the Chinese are apparently convinced of the facts concerning their Kung-Ming-Shan, and no progress is therefore possible until they can be moved from this position.

We endorse policy stated in paragraph 3 of Burma telegram and have no intention of extending control or commitments to the southern Wa States west of the Liuchen Line unless we are forced ,to do so by hostile activities of the Chinese. This answers the question put in paragraph 3 of your telegram. 3. We also accept your appreciation in paragraph 2 of the telegram quoted above as to the capacity of the Burma Military Police to deal with the existing situation. It is, however, possible that the Chinese may resume hostile activities in the neighbourhood of the Liuchen Line when the weather improves unless settlement is reached by negotiation meantime. Even if they do not resume hostilities and existing position of stalemate continues, we must emphasise that, as pointed out by Burma, our present defensive dispositions impose an excessive financial and administrative strain upon Local Government system of frontier defence, which must be ended as soon as possible. Further, it is impossible to forecast the extent of our loss in prestige and local difficulties that may be occasioned by inaction, and our acquiescence in reoccu- pation of disputed area by Chinese forces. More active measures may be forced upon us should this situation materialise. We therefore feel that it is essential for negotiations to be expedited and some agreement reached as to disputed frontier with the least possible delay. In addition, we consider that a decision should be reached in advance as to policy to be adopted in the event ot Chinese forces returning to the Liuchen Line. * Not printed, see No. 72. l j ^ hoiile. : % Mj,45 4.

[ fear that attitude of Chinese Government is very different from what it was in 1900. I also feel that if conference were to meet with Chinese still harping on their Kungmingshan there would be little chance of success. I doubt whether they will abandon Kungmingshan, though there is just a chance that they might if we were to assure them that once treaty line had been drawn on the principle that we propose, i.e. fixing co-ordinated point and finding watershed, we should be piepared to consider modifications to adjustment of line to local convenience, i.e. so that it should not cut the State boundaries. Would you authorise me to put this now officially to Minister for Foreign Affairs and leave with him the only means of refusing what seems a reasonable proposition ? I had thought of suggesting going further and saying (if I could be authorised to do so) that in particular we did not claim State of Panhung, as I understand modification of Scott Line, to which we were in the past ready to agree, gave the State to China. But if we did this the Chinese would be able to say in that case there would be little use in fixing co-ordinated point A, as that point would be well east of any line giving Panhung to China, and we should be edged off our principle of fixing co-ordinated point and finding watershed. But you may think there is some way of utilising this idea if it is not altogether undesirable. No. 77. P.Z. 5398/34.

(.4/50 reported in telegram {not printed) from Peking to Foreign Office, No. 548, dated 20th August 1934.) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs present their compliments and have the honour to acknowledge receipt of a Memorandum dated 13th July (No. 60) regarding the question of the undemarcated southern section of the Burma-Yunnan frontier. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs have the honour to state in reply that the Chinese Government in principle expresses agreement with the suggestion relating to the holding of a conference at Nanking and the participation therein of representatives of Burma and Yunnan, as already stated in the Ministry's Note of 29th June (No. 57). As stated in the Memorandum under acknowledgment, the dispute over this case is of long standing and the circumstances are complex. For this reason, in order to make every effort to achieve a fully satisfactory and effective settlement, it is essential that both parties must mutually display a spirit of compromise. The Chinese Government feels certain that His Majesty's (iovernment must likewise be actuated by a similar spirit and desire. Nanking is situated far from Burma and Yunnan, and pending such time as both parties can definitely certify the true facts of the origin and source of recent incidents, the Chinese Government attaches the greatest weight to a survey on the spot, as already set forth in the previous Note, and this has been throughout and still remains the Chinese Government's attitude with regard to the matter. With a view, however, to the advancement of the present discussions, the Chinese Government have already ordered the officials sent to investigate for the time being not to proceed within the area of the undemarcated frontier during the period of the discussions. As regards the various disorders and breaches of the peace that have occurred within the region of the undemarcated frontier, the Chinese Government have continually received reports, and on the basis of these reports the Chinese Govern ment deeply regret that there is no means of verifying the declarations made by His Majesty's Legation on several occasions to the effect that there had been no crossing of the frontier. In order to avoid all complications, however, the Yunnan Provincial Government has on several occasions been given strict telegraphic orders effectively to stop Chinese troops from crossing the border, while several telegrams have been received in reply stating that action had been taken accordingly, as has already been stated in the previous Note referred to. The Chinese Government for their part have thus done all in their power to adopt a negative attitude so as to maintain the peace of the undemarcated frontier region and still hopes that His Majest\ 7 's Legation will cause instructions to be issued so that due attention may be paid to the strict observance of the frontier line of long standing, and thus substantiate the previous declarations that there had been no crossing of the frontier. In this way disorders and breaches of the peace within the undemarcated frontier region will soon quieten down and normal conditions be restored, as is doubtless the end desired by His Majesty's Legation in common with this Ministry.

His Majesty s Government agree as to urgency of reaching agreement on disputed frontier by negotiation if possible. 3. Policy to be adopted if negotiations fail and Chinese forces return to the Liuchen Line is difficult to decide in advance of events. Much, for example, might depend on extent and character of Chinese occupation of disputed zone. 4. Question whether in such event we should assert our claim to Scott Line by force raises international issues which would be specially difficult if Chinese occupied disputed zone with regulars. In any case, however, it seems probable that extension of our administrative liability eastwards in such circumstances would be a costly undertaking, as maximum amount of local opposition would be stirred up by Chinese, and 1 would be glad of your views on this point. 5. Alternative would be to make Liuchen Line temporary limit of our administration. In this case we should of course repel attacks, whether by irregulars or regulars, and if we were molested by irregulars or bandits it might be necessary to take preventive measures against such bodies and to cross Liuchen Line for this limited purpose. It has, however, to be recognised that if we acquiesce indefinitely in the occupation by the Chinese of the disputed area, this would not be far removed from the abandonment of our claim to that area. Having regard to administrative and financial considerations this may be the wisest policy to adopt, but the choice is a difficult one, and [ would be glad to have your view's and the views of the Government of Burma both on the policy to be adopted and on the military and other arrangements that would be necessary to implement any policy. 6. Although the question now raised is hypothetical, it is nevertheless of some advantage to consider it in a preliminary way at this stage, for if you and the Government of Burma are inclined to favour the alternative policy set out in paragraph 5 this would clearly affect our attitude in the boundary discussions as we would be more prepared to agree to any reasonable compromise.

Boundary in 1894 Convention was based on Scott's reports. There can be no doubt that Scott's delimitation gave effect to conventional boundary and the British Government have told China that they regard it as the boundary settled by the Convention to which China was co-signatory. Boundary question has now passed beyond an inter-Provincial question and has become an international issue, and the Governor recognises that considerations will enter in which are outside the Local Government's sphere and cognisance. But from experience in Burma of Chinese official methods, Governor is con vinced of the danger of allowing China to repudiate the Convention and getting her way by the methods which she has pursued in regard to this boundary. Such a result would involve disaster, loss of prestige, and lead to repetition of the same tactics and, from local point of view, would have reactions all along the frontier which w r ould make very difficult relations with Chinese frontier officials, which, as it is, are not easy. Governor is therefore stongly opposed to any offer to China of ex gratia concessions to induce her to keep her bond. He considers that inter change of concessions should De on mutual basis of compromise emphasised in Chinese Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs' interview with Teichman, 9th August (N T o. 73), and in Chinese Foreign Ministry Note of 9th August. 3. Governor considers approach suggested by Teichman is most promising and suggests that, in order to establish basis for further negotiations, first efforts of the conference should be to get agreement to a Joint Boundary Commission to ascertain on the ground and fix on maps, line resulting from application of the 1894 Convention. In view of the failure of the 1900 Boundary Commission and of the Chinese Government's present attitude, Governor suggests that the Chinese Govern ment should, if possible, be induced to agree to appointment by the League of Nations of Third Boundary Commissioner, b3 T whose decision both parties should be bound in case of differences. Governor regards this as very important, as, if agreement can be reached to have authoritative Boundary Commission on the lines suggested, there is prospect of obtaining boundary which would command international acceptance. Governor regards it as impossible to consider concessions in respect to Wa States boundary till the basis for concession has been ascertained, and suggests that consideration of mutual concessions to be made should be subsequent to the definite fixation of the Convention boundary line. Governor sees no objection to agreeing now to subsequent negotiations for suitable adjustment, based on the spirit of mutual compromise, if this would help to induce Chinese Government to agree to fixation of boundary by Commission on the lines suggested above. 4. Only mutual concessions which the Governor can think of would be to obtain the Chinese Government's acceptance of de facto boundary, north of latitude 25° 35' , in exchange for concessions in Wa States to cover the Chinese encroach ments. Admittedly the Scott Line is the best, in fact, only really satisfactory boundary. Salween was rejected as the boundary in 1889 and it is impossible now to cede to China Panglong, Yungpang and other friendly States. Liuchen Line is not boundary, but merely impalpable line which would make administration impossible. It is also practically the line of the forged Hsueh map indignantly repudiated by us in 1900. Concessions offered and subsequently withdrawn by Scott seem unlikely to be considered sufficient, and there are obvious objections to excluding the portions of49 Panghung west of the bcott Line. There are also strong objections to dividing Wa country set out in Burma letter of 19th October 1906, but at the same time Governor considers that unsatisfactory boundary, negotiated on the basis of concessions from the Scott Line, would be preferable to the continuance of the present unsatisfactory situation. 5. If the conference breaks down, as appears very probable, it seems to us that the decision must be taken on Imperial rather than provincial considerations. Provincial Government definitely opposed to extending present commitments unless circumstances force us. Policy hitherto has been to keep belt of no man's land between us and the boundary we claim. This has not prevented encroach ment and infiltration by Chinese, which eventually would have had to be faced. Events this year seem to make this policy no longer possible. In the abseuce of boundary, either accepted by Chinese or effectively held by us, it is certain that Chinese Provincial Government will countenance raids and disturbances wherever possible up to Salween, if not beyond, and will regard the position as proof of our weakness, which will have its effect on the whole Burma-China frontier. Only alternative seems to be to hold some boundary effectively. We have no wish to extend to the Scott Line, but, m the event of the breakdown of the conference, it appears to be best, if not the only, alternative. Apart from repercussions outside the Province, nature and strength of which we have no means of judging, this course involves military operations, and almost certainly reduction and administration of Wa country this side of the Scott Line, with all its responsibilities. Strong action to this effect might induce the Yunnan Government to acquiesce, but danger of retaliatory action along the length of the frontier would have to be faced and would probably involve increase of the Frontier Force. Task would be beyond resources of Burma and it seems for the Imperial Government to decide if this is only or best way of compelling China to respect Treaty obligations. 6. With reference to paragraph 2, Secretary of State's 2205, 18th September (No. 83). If the suggestions made in paragraph 3 above are adopted, representative from Burma will not be required at the Conference till later stage of the negotiations regarding the concessions. If, however, Burma representative required from the commencement of the negotiations, December or January next would be suitable, and our representative would probably be Clague, Commissioner of the Federated Shan States.

But Cadogan goes to Nanking middle October, and it would be convenient if something could be settled before then, at any rate as regards future procedure in connection with the conference. I should therefore be grateful if you could telegraph your views as early as possible in regard to certain points in Burma Government's suggestions which I understand as follows :— (1) That first stage of conference, to which representatives need not be sent from Burma, should aim merely at setting up Joint Boundary Commission to ascertain line resulting from Convention of 1897. 3435 G(2) That one Boundary Commissioner should be appointed by Council of League of Nations and should have a casting vote, (3) That on receipt of Commission's report second stage of conference should be held to consider mutual cod cessions in respect of line recommended bv Commission. Perhaps principle of such concessions should be that contemplated in last paragraph of Article 6 of Convention of 1897. (4) That at stage (1) above Nanking (Jovernment should be informed that we agree to subsequent negotiations contemplated at stage (3). 3. You might also telegraph your views, if you are ready with them, on question of concessions which we might be prepared to make. Tn this connection, I observe that Burma Government in their telegram of 11th March, No. 27 (No. 18), agreed that best basis for settlement was that suggested in Foreign Office telegram of 23rd November 1929, No. 427,' and your telegram 16th July 1929, No. 2220 S.* This contemplated conceding Scott compromise line, which gives Panghung to China.

Burma telegram dated 20th September, 137 (No. 84), and your telegram dated 18th September, 2205 (No. 83). 2. Burma Government's proposals may be summarised as being for:— (а) Appointment of international Commission with League of Nations arbitrator to fix on ground and maps boundaries as agreed upon in 1897 Convention. (б) In the event of breakdown of negotiations military occupation with concomitant civil administration up to the Scott Line, 3,—(a) W e have admission of the Chinese Vice-Minister, see Peking telegram dated 15th August (No. 76), that the Scott Line approximates to the line of 189^ and 1897 Conventions. * Not printed.iOitl \i I OCCUp^ 111 ' groi 51 Our case is therefore strong one, and we agree that line must be fixed on the and and on the maps as basis of subsequent negotiations, and consider that should form first term of reference to the Ro„.,,l. ro fv j 6 r . , ,■ ,■ , . ; , ' uegouations, and consider that this should form first term of reference to the Boundary Commission proposed We realise that you are averse to any intervention of League of Nations (Wo T,„1U Office letter No. P.Z, 2820/34. 1st May 1934, (No. convinced by past and piesent attitude of Chinese Government that nothing can be accomplished by direct negotiation without outside intervention to influence them. We therefore support Burma Government's proposal for a neutral arbitrator to be provided by the League of Nations. Chinese can hardly justifv refusal to accept^ such a proposal, and we should have nothing to fear from' the award. 0 u. r « ^., c ^.u.uu nave aotnmg to tear Irom the award. Should Chinese Government agree to Boundary Commission with arbitrator we should be prepared to promise, in advance, adjustment of Convention line by negotiation in spirit of mutual compromise, as is, indeed, required bv Article VI of 1897 Convention. 4. We are opposed to the suggestion that the issue should be complicated by raising the question of the de facto frontier north of latitude 25° 35'. An attempt to force an agreement on other sections of the frontier will complicate the issues and create further important difficulties such as are likely to postpone a decision indefinitely. Mutual concessions should, in our opinion, be confined to adjustment of the Convention line in the Wa States' sector on the basis of Article VI of 1897 Convention. We suggest also that these adjustments might form subsidiary term of reference to Boundary Commission. 5. We suggest therefore that Minister at Poking be authorised to propose to Chinese Government appointment of Boundary Commission with League of Nations arbitrator to assemble on the frontier on 15th December (see Burma telegram to Peking, 118, 10th August) (No. 71). In this event, attendance of Burma represen tatives at Nanking will, in our opinion, be unnecessary. Our representatives on the Boundary Commission could suitably be Commissioner, Federated Shan States, and perhaps Barton. See Burma telegrams 122 (No. 78), 16th August, and 137 (No. 84), 20th September, paragraph 6. 6. Burma Government's proposal (h). We are strongly opposed on military grounds to the proposal to occupy the whole of the disputed area up to the Scott Line. Exact location of boundary on this frontier is, in our opinion, matter of no strategic importance, and the accomplishment of the object would involve prolonged and expensive military operations which could not be completed in one dry season. Rear and forward communications are absent and would have to be constructed through a difficult country. Troops would have to be maintained in forward area for indefinite period, involving heavy expenditure on maintenance of military garrisons at end of precarious communications during wet season. Area is most unhealthy and unsuitable for military operations, and opposition from enemy whose fighting value is low is likely to be less than that presented by topography and climate of the country. Our conclusion is that, if occupation up to Scott Line is to be result of breakdown of negotiations of conference or Boundary Commission, we should do all that we can to prevent such breakdown. Time is not of great importance, and if Chinese are reluctant to reach agreement we can, without sacrifice of essential aspirations, acquiesce in delays Similar reasoning applies to proposal for extension of civil administration up to Convention line. Government of India are. in any case, not prepared to face expenditure from central revenues on despatch and maintenance of regular troops in this area, unless such action is forced on them by Chinese aggression or on extension of civil administration. 7. It remains to consider immediate dispositions pending appointment of Boundary Commission and during its operations. During this period we may anticipate possible raids by irregulars or brigands, and we think that policy should generally be that stated in your telegram 1491, 7th June. No change would be made in present dispositions of Military Police and troops unless situation deteriorates, and escorts for Commission would be found by Military Police. Liuchen Line in the northern sector on the Lufang-Hopang front would be maintained and hostile forces crossing it attacked ; pursuit across the border into the disputed area being permitted if warranted by the military situation. Plans should be prepared and troops held in readiness to move via Tahsaileng to the vicinity of Mongmau, should the Chinese invade this area, our policy52 'beins to prepare for eventualities, but to take no action until forced to do so. Should we be compelled by the deterioration of the situation to undertake further military operations, reinforcements will be required from India m proportion to the extent of the operations. Necessary units will be earmarked and arrangements made for despatch, but no movements will take place in advance of emergency arising. . u ^ i 8 Extension of civil administration must in any case be confined to the financial capacity of the Burma Government, since the Government of India are unable to make further contributions. 9. Since the above was drafted we have received your telegram of the 3rd instant 2329 (No. 86). We agree generally in your summary of the Burma Government's suggestions, and will telegraph further, after consultation with Burma, regarding the question of mutual concessions. No. 89. P.Z. 0285/34. Letter from India Office to Foreign Office, dated 15th October 1934. Sir I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to the telegrams from the Government of Burma, No. 137, dated 20th September (No. 84), and the Government of India, No. 124 C., dated 8th October (No. 88), relative to the negotiations with the Chinese Government regarding the Burma-Yunnan frontier. 2. The present proposals of the Governments of Burma and India involve some departure from the procedure proposed to the Chinese Government last June (see Peking telegram No. 371 of 9th June) (see No. 55) and accepted in principle in the Note of 'the Wai Chiao Pu of 9th August, namely, that prior to a delimitation of the frontier, a conference should be held at Nanking to settle the principles of such delimitation. Under the present proposals a Joint Boundary Commission would be set up at once to examine the ground and fix on the map the line resulting from Article 3 of the Convention of 1897, and negotiations by means of a conference or otherwise would take place subsequently to consider mutual con cessions, in the shape of adjustments of this line, such as are prescribed in Article 6 of that Convention. It may, perhaps, be anticipated that the Nanking Government will not object to the mere change in the order of events, since the suggestion for a Boundary Commission came in the first place from themselves, whereas it was His Majesty's Government who proposed that this step should be preceded by a conference. 3. The Secretary of State agrees, however, with the Government of India that the first of the terms of reference to the proposed Boundary Commission should be to examine the ground and fix on the map the line prescribed by Article 3 of the Convention, as a basis for subsequent negotiations. He trusts that, as a result of, and on the basis of, the valuable discussions held by Sir E. Teichman with the Chinese Vice-Minister for Eoreign Affairs on the 6th and 9th August, it may be possible to persuade the Chinese Government to agree to this. While it would, of course, be undesirable to offer any definite concessions in advance of the work of the Commission, Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare agrees that, in order to facilitate agreement on the main proposal, a promise may be made in advance that in the subsequent negotiations on the basis of the Commission's Report, adjustments of the line will be considered in a spirit of mutual compromise. As regards the last sentence of paragraph 4 of the Government of India's telegram, he considers that the second of the terms of reference to the Boundary Commission might be to report, in the light of their local examination of the ground, on any cases in which a question appears to them to arise of modifications on the basis of mutual concessions, in order to avoid the intersection of any districts, tribal territories, towns or villages. 4. Sir Samuel Hoare, after careful consideration, sees no objection to the proposal of the Governments of India and Burma that the consent of the Chinese Government should also be sought to the appointment of a neutral member, with a casting vote (i.e. in effect, a neutral chairman), to the Commission by the League of Nations. If, as may be hoped. Sir A. Cadogan succeeds in securing the consent of the Nanking Government to this proposal, it will be a matter of some urgency to take the necessary steps for such an appointment in time to enable the Commission53 to meet on the frontier as soon as possible and to complete their work during forthcoming open season, i.e. at any rate not later than loth May next ft will U seen that it is suggested by the Government of India that the Commission might meet about loth December. The Secretary of State would, therefore, suggest that after the Chinese Government s agreement has been obtained, the President of the Council of the League might be moved to select a chairman of the Commission if this procedure is considered appropriate and it is not thought necessary to brinff such a matter before a meeting of the Council itself, ^ 5. If Secretary Sir John Simon concurs in these proposals, Sir Samuel Hoare would suggest that immediate instructions might be telegraphed to Sir A Cadosan to take action on the lines suggested in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 above.

Cadogan [Peking), dated 20th October 1934. {Repeated to India, No. 55.) 360. Your telegram No. 540 (No. 76). 1. Matter has been re-examined by Governments of Burma and India. Thev suggest, and His Majesty's Government agree, that most promising procedure for future negotiations will now be, first, to obtain agreement of Chinese Government to appointment of Joint Boundary Commission with League of Nations chairman, with authority to ascertain on the ground and fix on the maps line resulting from application of Article 3 of Convention of 1897 ; secondly, to negotiate in spirit of mutual compromise adjustments of this line of the kind contemplated by Article 6 ■of the Convention. Our idea is that Boundary Commission thus constituted might finally determine the general trend of the frontier resulting from the fixed points and the watershed laid down by the Convention, and report ad referendum on cases for adjustment. Conference with participation of Burma and Yunnan would not be necessary prior to appointment of Commission, but might be held subsequently if this was necessary for the contemplated negotiation of adjustments. 2. I should therefore be glad if you would now take an early opportunity of reopening this matter with Chinese Government and suggest to them that as the valuable discussions held by Sir E. Teichman with Chinese Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs have done much to clear the ground it may be unnecessary to hold preliminary conference at Nanking. Instead of this, we might revert to original proposal of Chinese Government and set up at once a Joint Boundary Commission. His Majesty's Government propose that this Commission should have a neutral chairman and should be given authority to determine on the ground and fix on the map the line prescribed by Article 3 of the Convention of 1897. The line so fixed would form a basis for subsequent negotiation of adjustments such as are prescribed in Article 6 of the Convention. For such subsequent negotiation a conference, in which representatives of Burma and Yunnan would participate, could, if necessary, be convened. 3. It is undesirable that any definite concessions should be offered in advance of the work of the Commission, but, in order to facilitate agreement on the main proposal, you may propose in advance that in the subsequent negotiations on the basis of the Commission's Report, adjustments of the line will be considered in a spirit of mutual compromise. 4. The first of the terms of reference to the Commission would be to fix the line as stated above. As it might also be useful in the subsequent negotiations to have the views of the Commission on cases arising undef Article 6. the second of the terms of reference to the Commission might be to report, in the light of their local examination of the ground, on any cases in which a question appears to them to arise of modifications on the basis of mutual concessions, in order to avoid the intersection of any districts, tribal territories, towns or villages. 5. His Majesty's Government trust that the Chinese Government will agree to the proposal that the Commission should have a neutral Chairman appointed by the Xeague of Nations, As the Commission should meet on the frontier about the 15th54 December, or as early as possible afterwards, in order to complete their work during the forthcoming open season, namely, not later than 15th May next, it seems desirable to avoid delay involved in bringing matter before Council of the League. The Chinese Government might therefore be asked to agree to the selection of the chairman of the Commission by the President of the Council. No. 91. P.Z. 5761/34. Teleqram from Sir A.

At interview on 25th October I explained to Minister for Foreign Affairs views of His Majesty's Government, and handed him memorandum (No. 92), setting forth our proposals in terms of your telegram. Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed his personal appreciation of the proposals and said that he would study them and let me have reply of his Government as soon as possible. No. 92. Record of His Majesty's Minister's Interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 25th October 1934. Also present; Vice-Minister flsu Mo and Messrs. Liu, Li and T'an of the W.C.P., and Sir E. Teichman and Mr. Caccia. B urma -Y unnan F rontier. His Majesty's Minister, after explaining how His Majesty's Government had come to revert to the original Chinese proposal for a Joint Boundary Commission to examine the ground on the spot and the nature of the proposals they now had to make, read out and handed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the attached memorandum setting forth the proposals in question. The Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that he was gratified to learn that His Majesty's Government had accepted the Chinese suggestion for a Joint Commission, and that he personally thought that the proposals now put forward by the British Government would in principle be welcomed. As regards the reference to the 1697 Convention, however, while China must of course observe her Treaty obligations, the Treaty text in question was unfortunately vague and in parts not in accordance with the facts, referring for instance to the position of the Kung- Ming-Shan. He was not, of course, in a position to discuss details at the moment, but, speaking personally, he welcomed the idea of a Joint Commission, and he would lose no time in studying the document presented to him by His Majesty's Minister and would deliver the reply of the Chinese Government with the least possible delay. His Majesty's Minister replied that he naturally did not expect an immediate answer to the proposals, which would require to be carefully studied by the Chinese Government. He desired, however, to urge them very strongly on the Chinese Government as an eminently fair and reasonable offer. After some further remarks in support of; the proposals. Sir A. Cadogan added, with reference to His Excellency's remarks about the Treaty text, that, while its terms might not be entirely satisfactory, a line was in fact clearly indicated and certain fixed points defined. It should therefore be possible for the Joint Commission to fix these points and lay down the line resulting therefrom. The neutral chairman should be of great value in this respect. He, Sir A. Cadogan, felt strongly that the great thing was to get away from the disputed maps and documents of the past and make a fresh start with the Joint Commission on the basis of the Treaty which had been signed by both countries. With goodwill on both sides it should not be so difficult to reach an equitable settlement on the basis of the definition laid down in the Treaty text. His Majesty's Minister also drew the special attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to paragraph 6 of his Memorandum and the proposals therein contained for the selection, without delay, of the neutral chairman by the President of the Council of the League of Nations.55 i_. M r - Wang Chmg-wei replied that, while the matter must of course be considered hy the Chinese boverument he persoua ly was in favour of the proposal to have a neutral number on the Joint Commission and of the suggesdon .nade for his selection. He again expressed his general appreciation of the proposals and promised a reply as soon as possible. i 1 1 E. T. A - C - M emorandum. His Majesty's Minister has the honour to refer His Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs to recent correspondence and discussions between His Maiestv's Legation and the Waichiaopu on the subject of the undelimited southern 'section of the Burma-Yunnan frontier and, under instructions of His Majesty's frincinal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to put forward the following proposals for the consideration of the Chinese Government. 2. In view of the informal discussions already held, which have done much to clear the ground, His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom surest that it may be unnecessary to hold the preliminary conference at Nanking, aslhey had originally proposed, and they are prepared instead to revert to the proposal of the Chinese Government and set up at once a Joint Boundarv Commission Mcije&gt;t\ s Government m the United Kingdom propose that this Commission should have a neutral chairman to be appointed by the Lea erne of Nations and should be authorised to determine on the ground and fix on the map the line of the undemarcated section of the frontier resulting from the fixed points and the watershed between the Salween and the Mekong as prescribed bv Article 3 of the Convention of 1897. v ' 4. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom propose that the line so fixed should form the basis for the subsequent negotiation of any necessarv adjustments of the kind contemplated in Article 6 of the Convention. If it were found necessary a conference, in which representatives of Burma and Yunnan would participate, could be convened for these subsequent negotiations. 5. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom accordingly propose that the first of the terms of reference to the Joint Boundary Commission' should be to fix the line as stated in paragraph 3 above. As it might also be useful in the subsequent negotiations to have the views of the Commission on cases arising under Article 6, the second of the terms of reference to the Commission might, it is proposed, be to report, in the light of their local examination of the ground, on any cases in which the question appears to them to arise of modification on the basis of mutual concessions in order to avoid the intersection of any districts, tribal territories, towns or villages. 6. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom trust that the Chinese Government will agree to the proposal that the Commission should have a neutral chairman appointed by the League of Nations. As the Joint Commission should meet on the frontier about 15th December, or as early as possible afterwards, in order to complete their work during the forthcoming dry season, namely, not later than 15th May next, it seems desirable, to avoid the delay involved in bringing the matter before the Council of the League of Nations, that the neutral chairman of the Joint Commission should be selected by the President of the Council of the League. 7. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom invite the Chinese Govern ment to agree to the above proposals, and they assure the Chinese Government that in the subsequent negotiations on the basis of the report of the Joint Commission, adjustments of the line will be considered by them in a spirit of mutual compromise. No. 93. Extract from Record of Interview with the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs at the Waichiaopu, Nanking, dated 21th October 1934. Mr. Hsu Mo and Dr. Liu Shih-shun. Sir A. Cadogan and Sir E. Teichman. His Majesty's Minister referred to the communication which he had made a day cr two before on the subject of the undelimited southern section of the Burma- Yunnan frontier (No. 92). He presumed that the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs was not yet ready to discuss the matter in greater detail, but he took the opportunity56 of making a few further remarks on the subject. Mr Hsu Mo said that the matter was being studied, and that he hoped a rep y would be given to the propose before His Maiesty's Ministers departure. In the course of the ensuing conversation Sir E Teichman' remarked, referring to the conversations he had had with the Vinp Minister for Foreign Affairs in August on the subject, tiat i r. Hsu Mo had then made a great point of the desire of the Chinese Government to deal with the matte ir a spirit oi conciliation and compromise^ It was obviously in the same V tW the new proposals had been made by His Majesty s Government. Mr. Hsu Mo readilv concurred and intimated that he had hopes of a satisfactory solution beTiU found on the lines of the new proposals. His Majesty s Minister a so mentioned the desirability of speeding matters up as much as possible, if the Joint Commission were going to meet during the present dry season, No. 94. P Z 7125/34. Telegram from Burma to Government of India, dated mh October 1934. 1J.S ft is understood that Boundary Commission will make on the spot minor necessary and agreed modifications of Convention boundary under Article VI, but will report facts as regards major or disputed modifications of line. These will form basis of subsequent negotiations. In course of these negotiations Burma Government would be prepared to accept cession of Panghung and Yungpangand to accept any satisfactory boundary that, can be found provided Chinese agree to it as final But all these are concessions on our side, and it is dilhcuit to visualise any possible ' mutual ' concessions that China could give in respect of Convention boundary. , , . n . , £ n r vi i + Even when China has accepted binding force ot Convention with regard to boundary it appears dangerous to give large and purely ex-gratia concessions which so far as China is concerned, have effect of nullifying Convention. It would appear almost certain to encourage China to pursue the same tactics with regard to northern undelimited boundary, where our frontier is not nearly so strong. It was for this reason that it was suggested that, at the stage of negotiations subsequent to Boundary Commission Report, a satisfactory solution of undehmited northern boundary might be put forward as quid pro quo for somewhat extensive concessions from Convention boundary in Wa States. China might consider repute of mines in Panghung and Petken valuable consideration for such a settlement. 1 his seems to bo in consonance with views of the Government of India in telegram No. 2220 S., dated loth July 1929, which was accepted by Secretary of State, and to be also in accordance with India Office letter to Foreign Office No. 2820/34, dated 1st May 1934 (No. 31).

In the absence of His Majesty's Minister. P.Z 7921/34. Translation of Enclosure to Despatch No. 41 T.S., dated 3rd November 1934. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has the honour to refer to the conversation which he is pleased to have had with His Excellency the British Minister on 25th October 19o4, on the subject of the undelimited southern section of the Yunnan-Burma frontier, and to inform him that the Chinese Government has carefully considered the proposals which His Kxcellency put forward under instructions of His Majestv's Government in the United Kingdom, regarding the setting up of a Joint Boundarv Commission. The Chinese Government, haying on several occasions suggested to His Majesty's Government m the United Kingdom that the two Governments should send representatives to the Yunnan-Burma region to re-delimit the southern section of the frontier, is now m full agreement with the proposal of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom to send a Joint Commission to the spot for that purpose. The Chm.se Government also agrees to the proposal that the Commission to be set up by the two LToyernments should have a neutral Chairman to be appointed bv the President of the Council of the League of Xations. The Chinese Government wishes that the duty of the Chairman shall be to give such advice and assistance to the Chinese and British Commissioners as will enable their work to be brought to a successful conclusion. In regard to the terms of reference to the proposed Commission, the Chinese Government is of the opinion that the Chinese and British Commissioners should first determine on the ground and fix on the map the various points and geographical names which are mentioned in Article 3 of the Agreement of 1897. They should also carefully examine, from the historical as well as geographical point of view, all mountain regions, waterways, tribal territories (including Tsawbwaships), towns and villages in the disputed area and, in the course of such examination, make the necessary modifications as regards the points they may have determined, such modifications to be based either on the provisions of Article 6 of the Agreement or on topographical, historical or political considerations. The Chinese and British tommissioners should finally, in the light of their findings and the readjustments they have made, jointly recommend to the two Governments a line to be indicated on the map as the southern boundary between Yunnan and Burma. The Chinese Government considers it advisable for the Commissioners of the ^ wo ^ overi } meil ts to inform and consult the neutral Chairman at every stage of their W'ork and, in case of disagreement between them on any question, to refer it to him or an advisory opinion. Should the Chinese and British Commissioners, in spite 1 e , ass ^ s ^ ;ance 9 f tf 16 Chairman, fail to reach agreement on any question, they should record their differences of opinion, proceed with the remainder of the work58 assigned to them, and, when finally presenting their report to the two Governments, submit their differences of opinion together with the views of the Chairman. If the Chinese and British Commissioners can happily arrive at complete agreement in recommending the boundary line to the two Governments, it would be only proper for the two Governments to adopt their joint recommendation and ratify the result of their work as soon as possible. If the Report of the Commissioners should contain any points on which they have not been able to reach agreement, it would then be necessary to convene at iNanking a Conference at which representatives of the Chinese Government and His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, including representatives of Yunnan and Burma respectively, -would use their best effort to settle such points by negotiation with a view to tixing, once for all, the boundary in question. i p tt- The Chinese .Government is gratified to note the proposal of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom that the Kepoit of the Joint Commission on -cases of modification should be made m the light of then local examination of the ground and on the basis of mutual concessions, while the subsequent negotiations between the two Governments should be conducted in a spirit of mutual compromise. The Chinese Government is indeed convinced that, in order to reach an amicable settlement of the whole question within the shortest possible space of time, the work of the Joint Commission should at every stage be undertaken on the basis of mutual understanding and concessions and that the subsequent negotiations should be held in a like spirit of mutual conciliation and compromise. The Chinese Government confidently hopes that the scheme as above sketched, which agrees in principle with the proposals put forward by His Majesty s Govern ment in the United Kingdom and which, it is believed, goes more into detail on matters relating to procedure, will be accepted by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, so that the urgent work of re-delimitation of the southern section of the Yunnan-Burma frontier may be undertaken and completed at an «arly date. No. 97. P.Z. 6907/34. Telegram from Sir A. Cadogan (Nanking) to Foreign Office, dated Srd November 1934. (Repeated to Peking and India.) No. 57 (Tour) (R). My immediately preceding telegram (see No. 96). After translation of Memorandum had been read to me I told (group omitted) that there were three points arising out of it which I should like to raise. In the first place, as regards duties of neutral Chairman I understood it was the view of my Government that he should not only advise but also arbitrate between Com missioners in case of a difference of opinion. I added that since Joint Commission work would mainly be of a technical surveying nature, and since in the past difficulties have arisen out of fact that both Governments have been faced with different reports of what is or is not to be found on the spot, it would in any case seem better that neutral Chairman should have power to arbitrate. Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that since Joint Commission line was only to be referred to both Governments for their approval, he did not think that in eventual outcome it would make much difference whether the Chairman arbitrated or recorded his advice, but that he would consider the point I had raised and asked me also to bring his views to your attention. This I promised to do. 2. Secondly, as regards terms of reference of Commission, I pointed out that to instruct Commissioners first to fix geographical names, i.e., Kongmingshan, as well as various points mentioned in Article 3 of 1897 Agreement was to create the very difficulties which have led to a breakdown in the past and which we were trying by our suggestion to avoid on this occasion. Best method of approach seemed to us to be to take those indications in Article 3 which could easily be ascertained by technical surveys, such as point of B1 section of lines of longitude and latitude there mentioned, and to exclude from terms of reference doubtful indications such as geographical names. Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that while point of departure of Joint Commission should be text of Treaty (presumably referring to geographical points laid down in Article 3), and w T hile due regard should be paid to it, a very important function of Commission would be to ascertain what the facts were on the spot59 (presumably referring to location of Kongmingshan) and that both factors should be taken into consideration by Commission in determining an equitable line At Minister for foreign Affairs request I promised to pass on to you hil proposal Imt in the meantime I impressed on him that I thought you would not be able to accep them, and that you would regard this a cardinal matter, f therefore ureed W «■ f pVi' 3 Thirdly, I did not think that it would be advisable to authorise Commission to make necessary modifications in the line they survey, but considered it wo dd avoid possible confusion for them to keep quite separate their duties in respec of surveying a line and in respect of suggesting modifications. I added incidentallv that I though it might be difhcult for them to take the historical as well as geographical factor into account, and that in any case this question was mainly one of procedure which f trusted would not lead to any serious difference between our Governments. Minister for foreign Affairs promised, as in the previous two points f bad raised, to consider my remarks pending my referring his proposals to His Majesty s Government. Ju conclusion, Minister for Foreign Affairs said principal desire of Chinese Government on this occasion was to obtain a settlement in a spirit 01 compromise aud conciliation. No. 98. P.Z. 7027134:. Telegram from Government of India to Secretary of State for India dated \&lt;Uh November 1934. {Repeated to Burma Government.) t 219-1 Reierence paragraph 9 of our telegram of the 8th ultimo, 124 C. (^o. ^8). Mutual concessions. I^uima ^jovernment s views are contained in their telegram of ^9th October, 148 (Xo. 94). In paragraph 4 of our telegram under reference we opposed proposal to raise question of northern undelimited frontier, and it appears from Foreign Office telegram of 20th October, 360 (Xo. 90;, that His Majesty's Government are also inclined to this view, and envisage that cases for adjustment should be limited to Wa States area 2. We have again considered the matter in the light of Burma Government 's views. While appreciating their point that it will be difficult to make mutual adjustments in a States area, we adhere to our recommendation that northern frontier should be excluded from terms of reference to the Commission, We feel that our position in a states area will be stronger if we continue to lay stress before the Commission and the neutral Chairman on the principle laid down in Article 6 of the 1S9&lt; Convention requiring adjustments to be made mutually in any area under delimitation. IE attempt is made to import northern boundary into the question the Chinese, even if they agree to consider it, are likely to be encouraged to demand a larger quid 'pro quo in the a area in return for concessions asked for further north. 3. At the same time we feel that it would not be inconsistent with this principle to make mental reservation regarding the northern boundary, importance of which is explained in the Government of India's telegram 2220 S. of loth July 1929. If as a result of the Commission's Report on ajustments in Wa States sector under Article 6 it is found that these are all in the nature of concessions to China, we should not be debarred at later stage from raising question of northern frontier as condition of our acceptance of concessions in Wa States area. Xo. 99. P.Z. 7102/34. Telegram from Government of India to Secretary of State for India, dated I9?A November 1934. Repeated to Peking and Burma.) 2243. Peking telegrams 56 (see So. 96) and 57 (Xo. 97j, 3rd Xovember and 4th November. We have consulted Burma, whose reply follows :— ' Reference to yonr telegram of the 5th instant, 2141. We agree generally in the views expressed by His Majesty's Minister in discussion with Minister forForeign Affairs and consider that acceptance of Chinese proposals would render the whole proceeding nugatory. Essential object of the Boundary Commission is to fix on the spot and on the map trend of boundary line as they conceive, starting from the terms of the Convention, that signatories intended it to be. Por tins purpose, neutral Chairman must have decisive vote and thus save the faces of the Chinese! So far as the Treaty boundary line is concerned, Boundary Commission's work must be final and not subject to discussion at the conference. Agreed basis of Boundary Commissioners' instructions should be, first, to ascertain and fix the general trend of the boundary as based on the three co-ordinated points mentioned in the Convention ; secondly, to adjust, where necessary, boundary so fixed to fit second general Treaty,viz. watershed system between Salween and Mekong; and thirdly, to adjust revised line so arrived at by minor deviations in the spirit of Article VI of the Agreement. Beyond that, Commission should confine itself to reporting on locally ascertainable facts as possible basis for subsequent negotiations in the conference for major deviation from the Treaty boundary in spirit of mutual compromise and concessions. Essential that demarcation of the Treaty boundary shall precede and be kept distinct from subsequent negotiations between the two Governments for alteration of that boundary on basis of mutual agreement; it is at this second stage that historical and other factors can suitably be introduced and before this stage is reached Boundary Commission will have finished its work.' Our comments are as follows. In our telegram of 8th October, 124 C. (No. 88), we contemplated two distinct terms of reference to the Commission :— (1) To ascertain on the ground, and to fix on the maps, treaty line of Article III of the Convention of 1897. (2) To report on adjustment of mutual concessions on the basis of Article VI of the Convention. For the purpose of the first term of reference, we attach particular importance to the point that the decision of the neutral arbitrator appointed by the League of Nations should be final and binding on both Governments. For the purpose of the second term, we had contemplated, as proposed by the Foreign Office telegram of 20th October, 3t)0 (No. 90), that the Commission should report ad referendum. We adhere to view that finality can never be attained unless both Governments agree to distinguish proceedings under Article III from those under Article VI and to be bound by neutral arbitrator's decision in case of disagreement regarding application of Article III. With regard to Article VI we do not think that Commission should be empowered to adjudicate finally with regard to even minor deviations from the Treaty line. These should be kept separate for adjustment by negotiation on Commission's Report in the spirit of Article VI of the Agreement, 2. We find it difficult to exclude geographical names from the first term of reference. 1897 Convention is full of such names throughout, and we must consider the difficulties of neutral arbitrator empowered to interpret Article III, but with the limitation that he is to exclude from consideration geographical names mentioned therein. It will be for the Commission, and ultimately, in the event of disagreement, for neutral arbitrator to consider what weight to attach to survey points and what to geographical names such as Kongmingshan, and if the two are irreconcilable to decide which should prevail. We think, therefore, that the first term of reference should simply be as stated in Foreign Office telegram 360, 20th October, namely, to ascertain on the ground and to fix on maps (? omission) resulting from application of Article III of the Convention of 1897. 3. You will observe that we are in agreement with the Burma Government, and only differ from them in thinking it unadvisable to give any final discretion to the Commission to make even minor adjustments in the line which they are to fix under Article III of the Convention. No. 100. P.Z. 7102/34. Letter from India Office to Foreign Office, dated 2\st November 1934. Sir, With reference to the telegrams Nos. 56 (see No. 96) and 57 Tour (No. 97) from His Majesty's Minister, Peking, relative to the Burma-Yunnan frontier I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to transmit copies of telegrams from the61 Government of India, Nos. 2243 and 2244, dated 19th November (No. 99), on this subject. Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare would suggest, for the consideration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that a telegram might be sent to Sir A Cadoyan , 1 • il FT* f 5 ^ ^ Xi.. V_ CtVlVJhictll informing him that His Majesty s Crovermnent agree with the views expressed in the Government of India's telegram No. 2243 (No. 99), and instructing him to deal on the following lines with the points raised by the Waichiaopu :— (i) His Majesty's Government note that the Chinese Government agree to the proposal that the Commission should have a neutral Chairman, appointed by the President of the Council of the League of Nations. They consider it essential that the Chairman should exercise all the functions usual in such cases, including that of a casting vote, and are unable to accept the Chinese suggestion that his duties should be confined to giving advice and assistance. Such a restriction would appear to be inconsistent with the position of Chairman, and it might even be difficult to obtain a neutral of the requisite standing under such a limitation. Moreover, the whole object of appointing a neutral Chairman is to avoid the difficulties which rendered the Commission of 1900 abortive. Unless the neutral Commissioner has a final voice on the Commission, the two national Commissioners might make such divergent reports that the two Governments would be brought no nearer to an agreement. (ii) For similar reasons His Majesty's Government consider that the first and most important duty of the Commission should be to ascertain on the ground and fix on the maps the line prescribed by Article 3 of the Convention of 1897 so far as it relates to the undemarcated frontier, viz. the third and fourth paragraphs of that Article. In other words, the Commission should interpret the Treaty provisions on which the two Governments have hitherto failed to arrive at an agreed interpretation. In performing this duty the Commission would give their relative weight to all the provisions and indications in the above paragraphs of the Treaty, namely, the co-ordinated points and the watershed and also the geographical names mentioned. On this point, therefore, it is possible to agree to the Chinese point of view, as stated in the first sentence of paragraph 3 of Sir A. Cadogan's telegram No. 56 Tour (see No. 96). On the other hand, since the primary duty of the Commission could be to interpret the Treaty, it would not be empowered to vary the provisions of the Treaty itself, in the manner that seems to be contemplated by the Chinese Government in the second sentence of paragraph 3 of that telegram, by bringing in extraneous historical or political considerations. {hi) In so far as the Convention in Article 6 provides for local modifications of the general Treaty line on the basis of mutual concessions, His Majesty's Government contemplate that such concessions should be subsequently negotiated in a spirit of mutual compromise (if necessary, at a conference). In order to facilitate, such negotiations, it would be the second duty of the Commission to report ad referendum on cases in which the question of such modifications appears to arise. The subsequent negotiations would also, as stated by the Government of Burma, be the appropriate stage for any consideration which it might be desired to give to historical and other factors. (iv) His Majesty's Government trust that, in the light of the explanations reported in Sir A. Cadogan's telegram No. 57 Tour (No. 9&lt;), and the further explanations suggested above, the Chinese Government will agree to their proposals for the appointment and procedure of the Commission as the best means for promoting a settlement of this long-standing dispute. The appointment of the Commission is of some urgency, as the surveying operations of the Commission are likely to take time, and it is desirable, if possible, that they should be completed during the forthcoming open season.

Chinese Government agree on duties to be assigned to Commission, whose task should be interpretation of Treaty provisions. On the other hand, in performing this task Commission should 'attach equal importance' instead of 'give their relative weight as suggested by His Majesty's Government to all provisions and indications contained m relevant portions of Article 3 of Convention of 1897. 4. As regards second duty of Commission, Memorandum states: Chinese government s proposal is primarily based on Article 6 of Convention. It is believed that it m accordance with this provision Commission can recommend a boundary line to the two Governments it will not fail to accelerate final setrlement of the whole question. 5. Chinese Government consider that if the two Governments can concur in tmal report of Commission they should adopt it by entering into a new Agreement forthwith. If modifications are considered desirable the two Governments would endeavour to negotiate such modifications and embody result in new Agreement _6. Pending conclusion of Agreement Chinese Government would reserve position they have previously maintained regarding future. . 7 - l , e ^P ressed gratification at acceptance by Chinese Government of His Majesty s (government's proposals concerning neutral Chairman, and I said that it seemed to me to go without saying that national Commissioners should be free to make their views known to their Governments. (S. As regards point raised in third paragraph of above I observed that this seemed to be only a question of wording and that our wording seemed to be the better. Commission might at any one point have to give more weight to one ^indication ^ than to another if, in fact, there was a conflict between the two indications ' and that it would not therefore be attaching ' equal ' importance to them. I do not think Chinese attach very great value to this point and they might be induced to drop it, though that would involve a little delay in reaching complete agreement, which, except on this one point, appears now to be in sight. &amp; 9. Meaning of passage quoted in paragraph 4 above was not quite clear to me, but Minister for Foreign Affairs assured me that it meant that Chinese Government accepted our proposals on this point. 10. As regards point in paragraph 5, 1 said that, so far as I understood, this corresponded with your views ; and as regards point of paragraph 6, I said that ms seemed quite natural and that we were, of course, in the same position. 11. As it seemed that we were approaching very near to an agreement, and as ime is getting short, I discussed possibilities of future procedure. We agreed hat first thing to do is to get agreed terms of reference. 1 had already prepared ■preliminary draft based on your instructions, text of which is given in mv immediately following telegram, and J communicated this to Minister for Foreign64 Affairs, making it clear that it had not yet been submitted to you and that His Majesty's Government might therefore themselves wish to suggest changes. I asked him to examine it on this understanding and to let me know as soon as r)ossible whether he had any changes to propose. He promised to do so and suggested that we should make no approach to President of Council of League until terms of reference are agreed. He also enquired how many Commissioners we would propose to appoint. 12. I should be glad to learn whether you wish me to maintain our wording ' relative weight' and whether you approve draft terms of reference. No. 104. P.Z. 7775/34.

Subject to the views of the Government of India and the Government of Burma, the terms of reference to the proposed Boundary Commission suggested by His Majesty's Minister, Peking, appear suitable, with certain verbal modifications. A text embodying the suggested modifications is enclosed with this letter. As the matter is becoming one of considerable urgency, I am to suggest that this text might be telegraphed to Sir A. Cadogan, with instructions that, as soon as he receives the telegraphic concurrence of the Government of India, he should communicate it to the Chinese Government. It is suggested that the telegram to Sir A. Cadogan might be repeated to the Government of India, and Sir Samuel Hoare would ask them to send, and repeat to Peking as soon as possible a telegram stating whether they concur or have any observations to offer. As regards paragraphs 3 and 8 of Sir A.

(6) Phrase ' attach equal importance, (c) Provision whereby Commission should make such modifications in general Treaty line as are necessary on basis of Article 6. For the rest Chinese draft seems to differ from ours only in the matter of wording and I do not see that it is objectionable. If 1 could get Chinese to remove Benes' name and, subject to the approval of Government of India, to accept phrase &lt;l attach due weight,' and further to accept in place of their text our original paragraph 3 concerning secondary duties oi Commission, would you think their draft satisfactory ?

Telegram from Foreign Office to Sir A. Cadogan {Peking), dated 16th January 1935. {Repeated to Government of India, No. 7.) 26. Your telegrams Nos. 7 (No. Ill) and 8 (No. 112) and the Government of India's telegram No. 74 (No. 114). . , u ■ You should endeavour to secure consent of Chinese Government to the lollowing modifications in their revised draft of terms of reference Paragraph 1 is satisfactory subject to the Commission being composed of five members, two to be appointed by each Government, and omission of reference to Dr. Benes by name. Farao-raph 2. As small sections of frontier defined by paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 3 have been demarcated, first sentence should be amended to read 'prescribed in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 3 of the Agreement of 189/ so far as they relate to the undemarcated frontier.' For ' attach equal importance ' substitute ' give their relative weight.' If you cannot secure this, we might accept attach their due weight.' Paragraph 3 is unacceptable both because it provides that Commission should tnahe modilications based on Article 6 of the Convention and also because it provides for a report on the question of other modifications which would apparently he based, not on Article 6, but on extraneous considerations. Appropriate stage for consideration of such factors would, however, be the subsequent negotiations (see paragraphs 3 and 4 of my telegram No. IS l our), and they should^ be excluded from purview of Commission. It is important, therefore, that this paragraph, should read in sense of original paragraph 3 in your telegram No. 771 (No. 104), as amended by my telegram No. 459 (No. 100). Paragraph 5, last sentence. 1 here is no objection to Chinese Goyernniept reserving their position, but a document such as terms of refeience, vhich is in effect a preliminary agreement, is not the appropriate place for such reservation since it might be held to involve recognition of the reservation by His Majesty's Government. It is therefore desirable that this sentence should be omitted. Paragraph 6. 11 the Commission is instructed to introduce a spirit of compromise into its work, the main object of adopting the procedure of a Commission with a neutral Chairman—which is to secure recognition of the general line prescribed by the Convention—might be endangered. Once this general line is accepted, subsequent negotiations will be inspired by spirit of conciliation and compromise. Paragraphs 5 and 6 generally. It does not seem appropriate that the matters covered by paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Chinese dra^t, relating as they do to the subsequent negotiations, should be included in the terms of reference; but if the Chinese object to total deletion of these paragraphs, you may offer to substitute for them the following paragraph, which meets the Chinese point as regards ' conciliation and compromise ' : — 'The question of any local modifications in the light of the report of the Commission under paragraph (3) of the terms of reference, or in the light of such other topographical, historical or political factors as may appear relevant, will be subsequently negotiated in a spirit of mutual conciliation and compromise. For the purpose of such negotiations a conference will, if necessary, be convened at Nanking between representatives of the two Govern ments, including representatives of Yunnan and Burma. The results of the report of the Commission, and of any such subsequent negotiations, will be embodied in a new agreement.'19 .5 1 ij P.Z. 4121/34. air NAVIGATION REGULATIONS for Civil Aircraft for the Territory of Bahrein, and Conditions g-overning: the use of the Aerodrome at Muharraq approved by His Excellency Sheikh Hamad bin 'Isa A1 Khalifah, C.S.I., Ruler of Bahrein.

(14706) THE SEVEN INDEPENDENT ARABIAN STATES.O THE purpose of this paper is to give a brief outline of each of the seven independent Arabian States at the time of the Arab rising against the Turks in June 1916. As the part played by the rulers of these States depended largely on the physical character and economic resources, the manner and life of the people and the form of faith held by them, it has been necessary to touch upon these factors. The regions of South-Eastern Arabia, including the Aden Protectorate, the Hadramaut, the Sultanate of Oman, the Trucial Coast and Qatar, which are in effect cut off from the remainder of the peninsula by the Great Desert, and therefore played little part in the ambitions of the greater Arab rulers and the consequent political and military issues, are excluded. The seven autonomous areas referred to are :— (1) The Imamate of the Yemen ruled by the Imam Yahya. (2) The Principate of Asir ruled by the Idrisi. (3) The Emirate of Mecca (or the Hejaz) ruled by Husein, Emir and Sherif of Mecca. (4) The Emirate of Nejd, ruled by Ibn Saud, Emir of Riyadh. (5) The Sheikhdom of Koweit, ruled by the Sheikh of Koweit. (6) The Emirate of Jebel Shammar, ruled by Ibn Rashid, Emir of Hail. (7) The vague territory containing the Oasis of Jauf, and various outlying oases, in possession of Nuri Bey esh Shalan, Paramount Chief of the Ruwalla. At the time of the outbreak of war in 1914 these seven States were more or less autonomous areas. Each area was vaguely defined, each peopled by a S ro ^P of loosely united tribes, and each governed by a personal ruler who received the varying degrees of allegiance, which the self-interest of the tribes prompted and which the ruler found possible or politic to enforce. (') Each area, except those of Jebel Shammar, Koweit and Jauf, had a distinct political history extending back for more than a century, and, in the case of Mecca, for many centuries. Each had political aspirations prompted, not only by the ambitions of its rulers, but by obvious considerations of advantages for the tribal group, and each had its own particular and traditional enemies and allies. In differing degree too these embryonic States were subjected to exterior influence, exerted chiefly by the Ottoman Empire and Great Britain. I,—The Imamate of the Yemen. Though chiefly a mountainous country, the Yemen is the most fertile and closely settled area in Arabia, and in 1916 contained a population of about a million. The capital is Sana. The inhabitants of the highland Yemen a race of hardy and warlike cultivators, hold the Zeid creed, a schismatic form of Shiahism iudiciously modified in the direction of Sunmsm. The lowland popula tion, on the other hand, are chiefly Orthodox Sunms In theory the position of the ruling Imam is that of an elective spiritual leader, but m practice the office has tended to become hereditary. , , n ^ 4- -p +1. ^1*™^ Turkish administration regarded the Yemen as part of the Turkish vilayet of the name. The whole vilayet comprised the three sanjaks of Sana, Hodeida and Taiz in the mediatised province of the Yemen; the fourth, Asir, formed part (M This memorandum was prepared by the late Mr. W. J. Childs and found among his papers A few modifications and additions have been made to bring it up to date. May m Complications existed in consequence of a custom well recognised in Arabia by which tribes occupying land within one autonomous area would sometimes prefer to g.ve theoretical allegiance to the ruler of another autonomous area, as being more distant and therefore less likely to exercise an unwelcome authority. 8056 [11932] BI I of the autonomous territory ruled by the Idrisi of Asir For reasons altogether obvious, the Turks from the first made greater efforts to maintain their hold over the \emen and the adjoining territory of Asir than any other part of Arabia. Complete rurkish occupation was effected at the close of the 16th century Since then the history of the Yemen has been one of intermittent rebellion and 1 urkish suppression, attended by wide variations of fortune Notwithstanding remoteness from the sources of Turkish power and the • difficult nature of the country for campaigning, the Yemen was the part of Arabia where Turkish occupation and influence were most effective at the outbreak of war in 1914. It was then a mediatised province subject to Turkish suzeraintv and garrisoned by Turkish troops. The ruler, the Imam Yahya, though oppoLd to the Turks nevertheless found advantage in supporting Turkish power durine '[' e w A a J- T he 'Pshot was that the Yemeni Turks were ftrong enough to invadf e Aden 1 rotectorate, defeat a British force at Loheiya in July 1915 nf i penetrate to the suburbs of Aden itself. Though ejected thence they were able to maintain themselves at Loheiya until the conclusion of the war. The Imam was more or less friendly towards the Emir of Mecca but a standing enmity existed between him and the Idrisi of Asir. In the 'rivalry between Hej az, TSejd and Jebel Shammar, the Yemen, chiefly owin? to its geographical situation, had little part. II.- -TAe Principate of Asir ruled by the Idrisi. • boundaries of Asir as it existed as a separate State were indeterminate ^ eaSt ' ai ? d , the . name was vaguely applied to a much greater area than that of the original district. Nor did the authority of the Idrisi run over the eastern part of the territory, which was later included in the name In 1914 Asir according to Turkish theory, was the northern saniaik of the Th t- f'n \.Tf n ' 7 h l Sclalm ' howevei '. w as little more than a theory.

WaS ^ thiS Pr0VinCe 0f Abu Arish that the head^TJ,!^ ni l tiv f 0 [ Fez nanie ! 1 Se yy id Ahmed-el-Idrisi, the venerated 00 whose tenets he had preached at Mecca for more than SBf I nilthirty years, bought land in Sabia, the capital of Abu Arish. There he settled and died in 1837, leaving a reputation of sanctity. As an incident of Seyyid Ahmed's career, he had been the teacher of the original Senussi, who took the covenant in his tariqah at Mecca in 1823. This accident had a considerable bearing upon the subsequent fortunes of the Idrisi family, which increased in wealth and influence, and, in 1841, supplanted the sherifial family of Abu Arish after Asir had been renounced by the Egyptians. The Idrisi house intermarried with the Senussi house, which was now settled in Cyrenaica, in Egypt and in the Sudan. But the chief expansion of Idrisi power was achieved by Seyyid Mohammed, the Idrisi who ruled in Abu Arish during the Great War, the great- grandson of that Seyyid Ahmed who had taught at Mecca. Seyyid Mohammed was born at Sabia in 1876, and educated partly at A1 Azhar, Cairo, and by the Senussi at Kufra. He returned to Sabia about 1900 cherishing the ambition of making Asir independent. By 1910 he had succeeded in reducing Turkish occupation to Ibha, Muhail and Qunfideh, but failed to capture Ibha owing to effective assistance given to the Turks by the Sherif of Mecca. During the Italian war with Turkey he was assisted by the Italians with arms and supplies and made his position in southern Asir secure, though at the time the Sherif of Mecca managed to suborn a large number of his tribal supporters whose territories lay outside Abu Arish. During the Balkan war of 2912-13, however, the Idrisi recovered his influence with these tribes. In 1914 he sought to obtain recognition of his position in Abu from the Government of the Young lurks. He failed, and in consequence declared against them when they carried Turkey into the war. In May 1915 he signed an anti- Ottoman treaty with the Resident; Asir was supplied by His Majesty's Govern ment with arms and munitions and took the field in the following June with a force of 12,000 men. His purpose was to capture Loheiya, but being unsuccessiul in the attempt he withdrew to his own territory at the end of the year, made a truce with the Imam Yahya, and ceased operations against the Turks until the Heiaz rising began in June 1916. After the fall of Jedda in the same month, e promised co-operation with the Sherif of Mecca, and offered to subordinate his own interests to the needs of the common cause, but did not abate his claim to the whole of Asir. , • i i.- When Qunfideh surrendered in July 1916 the town was occupied on his behalf by the sheikhs of Birk, who hoisted the Idrisi's flag. This step affronted the Sherif of Mecca, who despatched a force against the town, but the Idrisi refused to withdraw his garrison and threatened to go over to the Turk 8 whom he was blockading in Muhail and Ibha. In August, however, he evacuated the place but at the same time raised his blockade of the Turkish garrisons, and subsequent attitude towards His Majesty's Government was one of discontent, it not 0 r ^^ t Idrigi w ^ s a y man 0 f almost negroid type, tall and powerful m build, of great energy and decidedly intelligent. In pursuit of his ambitions he was seriously handicapped by absence of noble lineage; among Arab rulers, m fac , ^ was regarded It imrvenu. For him the Turks had an implacable enmity and theZaSthe Yemen was little less hostile. The Sherif of Meeoa despised him, &lt;&lt; tt &gt;&gt; t Y\e sherif once said, a man whom no one recognises to be anything, having made himself sheikh, and landed in some Pj ac ® ^^^y^tot^keep anvone ' The sherif's own interests, however, eventually compelled him to e p on friendlv terms and he endeavoured to mediate between the Idrisi and e Imam. The only Arabian ruler really friendly with the Idrisi was Ibn Saud, ruler of Nejd. Ill -The Emirate of Mecca {or the Hejaz) ruled by Husein, Emir and Sherif of Mecca. According to pre-war Turkish administrative theory, the Hejaz was an Ottoman vilayet exLndmg northward from Qunfideh on borde^ of A S1 r to the head of the Gulf of Akaba, sometimes including the town ot Akaba, some W? it to the Vilavet of Syria. Its eastern boundary was indeterminate in Ol-i-■' JSSS w also in the p ra cUce the northern limit adopted was a much farther south than AKaoa. ^ f w -i QC fr . inolnHp thp oasis line drawn inland from the coast a little north of Wejh so as to include [11932] B 2of Khaibar. This boundary was accepted by the Ottoman Government and supported by the demands of religious prejudice, which forbade Christians to use the Hejaz Railway farther south than Medain Saleh, just outside the lower boundary m question, unless for special official reasons. The Hejaz, so defined had a length from north to south exceeding 600 miles, and a depth inland' includmg Khaibar, of about 200 miles. The vilayet was divided into four kazas ' Yambo, Rabigh, Jedda and Lith. * Physically, this western littoral of Arabia comprised, in a broad view a belt of coastal lowland, a parallel belt of mountain and highland, and then a parallel belt oi falling country which merges into the interior plateau of Arabia. The principal surface characteristic of the Hejaz is a general barrenness due to lack of moisture. Oases are few and small; the largest the one in which Medina stands. The total population in 1916 was estimated as less than 1 million. Onlv one-sixth of the inhabitants are settled in towns and on the land; the remainder are Bedouins, partly or wholly nomadic. Various circumstances combined to place the Hejaz in a position bv itself among the autonomous areas of Arabia. It is the Holy Land of Islam, and its two holy cities of Mecca and Medina respectively the birthplace and burial place of Mahomet, are the chief shrines of pilgrimage for the great Sunni sections of the f rophet s followers This accidental endowment has determined the whole subsequent course of the country's history. The annual pilgrimage of scores of thousands directly or indirectly provided the means of existence for a large proportion of the population. (') The attraction of the Holy Places for Moslems led to the construction of the Hejaz Railway to Medina in 1908 and though nominally an act of piety, this extension from Damascus, as part of the Turkish railway system, had far-reaching political and military aims, for it made Heiaz more accessible to Turkish arms than any other portion of Arabia. Further the importance of the Holy Places in the world of Islam conferred upon the holder of the Emirate and Shenfate ot Mecca, which included the Hejaz, a standing and uifluence vastly greater than that of a merely local Arabian ruler. The position of the Emir and Shenf (') of Mecca, indeed, combined both temporal and religious PhTT f ^ d® 1 rel g mn .g he t d of the dominant sherifial family is ex officio p, ^ 0 t | le f ro P. ? ts t ' b . e -. the Qoreish, and Hereditary Keeper of the Holy I laces It should be noted, however, that the religious bases of sherifial power lay not in any divme attribution, but in reverence for descent from Mahomet and respect for the shenf as an individual who had been entrusted with such lofty duties as were his by right. ' The Emirate of Mecca dates from the 10th century and was an outcome of fhflt' nfrV, I 0 ' ^ 1 1C t V IVe f t0ok the early caliphial rule of the Moslem world. From that period until the close of the 18th century the Emirate was always the e fac o power in tlie Hejaz.

But from this time the Emirate was confronted by dangers more serious than any heretofore. The pilgrims of the Haj were first attacked by Wahabi raiders from Nejd in 1783, an outrage many wT K epe ; t ln sub f quent years, despite the Emir of Mecca. In 1803 a Wahabi expedition took and sacked Mecca itself, and, as an incident of the raid AtThfr^ Shenf S t ^ 1804 anoth er expedition assaulted and ^kMedfna.' world caravans from all parts of the Mahometan world ceased. In 1810 the Wahabi Emir again entered the Holy Cities plundered KLbHthe RWk 0 ^ 4 ^ M t e, l l f na ' which . he caus ed to be opened, and broke the , n e B,a ck Stone) at Mecca m pieces. Spoliation of the Faithful on IslamTuas^mm^r 1 , nte '' 1 P tlon ° f ^e Haj, outrage upon the sacred shrines of am at last moved the Ottoman Sultan to action. As Protector of all Moslems Mahomet A a i fr. u and T ' r k^h forces being unavailable, he s^nt hls with an twl ,5 T ^ yP a g ai ' st . the Wahabis; an adventure which the latter, an aleit e&gt;e to his own ambitions for independence, gladly undertook. The a milliL^peTsorlnToSejaz™ 68 the piIgrima S e acc0 ' mted fOT of nearly half Mo ' )_' ' 'rr-aml Shenf of Mecca ' was a European form of title. Arabs called the ruler of Mecca Emir, and addressed him as Seyyidna (our Lord).\ 5 Egyptian conquest of Nejd, completed in 1817, led the way to Egyptian rule being established in the Hejaz until 1840. During this period the Emirate of Mecca was reduced to a form of authority more shadowy and unreal than any it had known before. In 1840, however, the Porte resumed control. Turkish Government began firmly, and being favoured by dissension among the tribes, prevented an immediate recovery by the Emirate of its old status. Natural forces, making for a return to the autonomous condition, were, however, at work in the country. Progress was definite, if slow. Notwithstanding the consolidation of Turkish power in the Hejaz by Ottoman Pasha during 1886, the Emir of that time, Aun-er-Rafiq, not only retained but improved the privileged position he had recovered. The truth was that Emirs of Mecca were able to do what Turkish authority in the Hejaz never could achieve; they were able to call out Bedouin levies with which, if so minded, they could give the Turks invaluable military support in the Arabian provinces. Emirs of Mecca, therefore, were recognised as chiefs with whom it paid the Turks, even at the cost of large concessions, to be on good terms. In this situation the power of the Emirs could hardly fail to increase with any decline of Ottoman power. And such, in fact, was what happened. At this point it becomes necessary to give closer attention to the Emirate and the affairs of the Hejaz in the years which immediately preceded the war The Emirate was never, in theory, hereditary or restricted, except by pre scription to any of the Ashraf clans( 5 ) or families. For at least a centnry past the Emirs were appointed by the Power occupying the Hejaz but the Ottoman Government kept to the Abadilah house after 1827, with the exception of the periods 1851-6 and 1880-2, when it chose Emirs from the rival house ot Dhaw 1 Zeid: The Emir always stood at the great disadvantage that members of other Ashraf clans or of the Emir's own house, considered themselves equally or bettei entitled to the Emirate. Mecca always contained a strong element m opposition tothemling house, and an Emir seldom avoided having foes within his own household- in fact, one son was as likely to claim the succession as anothei• Husein Ibn Ali, who took the title of King of the Hejaz m 1916 and died m 1925 was a grandson of the first Abadilah Emir (who died ml857) and w as nominated to the Emirate by Riamil Pasha the Anglophil in 1908 In 1908 Husein had then been long resident m Constantinople, uncle, Abadilah, had been nominated to the position before him, bnt dled when on the way to Mecca to assume office.

McMahon, the British High Commissioner at Cairo, to make assumption of the Caliphate one of his purposes. He was careful, however, to avoid adopting any open policy in this direction; he always spoke of the Caliphate as being an office to be filled only by the choice of Islam, but there can be no question that it was a position which not only he himself secretly desired but his ambitious son, Abdullah, avowedly sought it for him. After the tentative prompting to Husein to seek the Caliphate given by Lord Kitchener and Sir H. McMahon in the message of the 31st October, 1914,( 6 ) His Majesty's Government left no doubt that they regarded the question of the Caliphate as one for Moslems alone. They restated this traditional British policy explicitly in a telegram to Sir H. McMahon on the 14th April, 1915. On the 17th November, 1915, they warned him to avoid &lt;c all possibility of being involved in any question concerning the Caliphate.' The subject was accordingly ignored by Sir H. McMahon in subsequent negotiations. In the agreement which Great Britain eventually reached with the Emir, his territorial demands were conceded with certain limitations and reservations. The British protectorate of Aden, the British-protected island sheikhdom of Bahrein and the south-eastern part of Asia Minor were excluded, limitations to which the Emir agreed. Great Britain also specifically excluded Western Syria and made reservations regarding the Vilayets of Bagdad and Basra in Mesopotamia, but on these points the Emir temporised, and though the validity of the British reservations is not open to doubt, the agreement did not contain the Emir's full acceptance of the reservations. Another important British limitation, that nothing in the agreement should prejudice the rights of other Arab rulers then in treaty or about to execute treaties with Great Britain, was also left in a somewhat similar position. Several old treaties between His Majesty's Government and Arab States on the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf were already in force. A treaty had also been signed with the Idrisi of Asir on the 30th April, 1915, and another, with Ibn Sand of Nejd, was concluded on the 26th December of the same year. The Emir's letters nowhere show an unequivocal acceptance of the limitations imposed on him in regard to these treaties. This matter becomes of particular interest in considering subsequent relations between Husein and other Arab rulers. The reservation, in fact, struck deeply at the Emir's ambition to unite the various Arab States, for, as far as those in treaty with Great Britain were concerned, compulsion was ruled out, and unity of the Arab race could be achieved only by friendly consent. . . . „ , Subject to these limitations and reservations. Great Britain m ettect under took to recognise and support Arab independence in the territories proposed by the Emir of Mecca and to aid him with money, arms and munitions. For his part the Emir undertook to spare no efforts to attach all Arab peoples to the cause oi the Allies and to give military assistance to the best of his ability. He also under took not to make peace without the agreement of Great Britain. i 1 hese broad terms having; been arranged, and money, arms and munitions supplied by Urea Britain, Husein and his four sons raised the Hejazi tribes in insurrection agams Turkish rule on 5th June, 1916. Two days later the Emir issued a proclamation denouncing the Turkish Government as dominated by the Committee ot Union arid Progress and proclaiming the independence of the Hejaz. IV. Emirate of Nejd ruled hy Ihn Saud, Emir of Riyadh. Of all the autonomous Arab areas with which this paper deals, the Emiiate of Neid came least under Turkish influence and power. It was too remote, too inaccessible, too poor, to offer permanent attraction for Turkish conquest and occupation. Nevertheless, it did not altogether escape. The hostile acts of its own rulers courted Ottoman intervention, and in ISH an Egyptian army, on behalf of the Ottoman Sultan took and destroyed the capital and ensured Egyptian occupation of a kind for a generation. But thereafter Egyptian and Ottoman influence ceased. Upon this vicarious occupation res ed the chief Ottoman claim to sovereignty in Central Arabia. ^ Vittl^mnrp attempts to establish effective occupation were indeed made ^ than verbal pretension to success, as when, m 1871, Midhat Pasha occupied Hasa the Persian Gulf, the province of Nejd, and on the strength of that achievement ( e ) For this correspondence, see Confidential 13778. 'Oasim, the north-west border province of Nejd, and for fifty years the subject f almost continuous hostilities between the Emirates of Nejd and Jebel Shammar, has physical and economic characteristics meriting special notice. The northern nsrt or Upper Qasim, is pastoral and carries only a sparse population, but Lower n^im which has been described as ' a land of green villages m a winding sheet of sand ' is a stretch of fertile oases 100 miles in length, strung out along the Wadi er Rumma, and separated from each other by intervals of steppe. Ihe spttled population of the whole province was not less than 50,000. From the geographical fact that the province stands midway upon the trans- npninsular route between Mesopotamia and Mecca, it is a trading district by tradition - indeed, it was estimated that one-third of the population were pameleers' or otherwise engaged in transportation. The people are warlike and independent, and stout supporters of Wahabism. Nevertheless, they have a wider outlook and better acquaintance with extra-Arabian civilisation than any other inland region of the peninsula. The two chief towns, Boreidah, 15,000 inhabitants, and Aneiza 10,000, ranked as the largest and most commercia m Tpntral Arabia. As the home of many prosperous and widely-travelled merchants thev were comparatively civilised and wealthy; they were, further self-governing democracies, jealous of their rights and privileges accepting only the over lordship of the Emir of Neid and the payment of an annual tribute. Such are the elements, each supplementing the others, which have produced the history alike of Nejd and of Wahabism. The two form a subject inseparable. In combination they present the story of a primitive State, which, far more than any other in Arabia, possessed the spirit and tradition of conquest and expansion and the native human means of giving effect to these promptings. oi About 1750 an ascetic revivalist and Haji, by name h ' bv W o L q K who nrpaohed a return to the pure and simple form of faith taught by the Prochet tol refuge at Deraiy a P in Nejd, from the incensed people of Haraimala his native town.

Hut fifty years of uninterrupted military success, conquest and spoliation had produced results in Nejd strangely at variance with the austere teachings of the lounder of Wahabism. Treasure torn from shrines as the forbidden offerings ot idolatry, or from individuals as proof of wanton depravity, had filled Riyadh with an accumulation of riches hitherto unimagined in Central Arabia Display that had been corrupting sin, to be punished by death in Orthodox Moslems ceased to be sm and became merit when adopted in the capital of Neid, where at the beginning of the 19th century, luxury, ostentation, pride and favouritism prevailed. On oppression being exerted on the tribes, discontent arose and some oi them emigrated. The Wahabi movement, the mainspring of Neidi power and success, had, in fact, fallen into decay at a time when the Mahometan world was most stirred against it. at , We k aye seen how the plundering of the Holy Places, the violation of Mahomet s tomb, the slaughter and spoliation of believers and the loss of provinces at last prompted the Ottoman Sultan, as nominal Protector of all Moslems, to take forcible action.

In 1812, however, experience so bought, combined with aige reinforcements, enabled progress to be made.

While the Wahabi State was still under the in at inn of EffVPt, a rival Emirate had arisen at Hail under Abdullah-bin- Rashid; it soon grew strong enough to detach Jebel Shammar from Nejd and to dispute the control of Qasim. . . 1 . , . -u In 1869 Abdullah, successor to Feisal, reasserted Ne.idi authority m Hasa on thp Persian Gulf. In 1871, however, the district was occupied by a Turkish We despatched by Midhat Pasha. More serious still were the reverses suffered in thp loxiff struggle between Nejd and Hail. In 1886 Riyadh was captured by Mohammed -bin-Rashid, Emir of Hail, and again in 1891. Then followed a neriod of ten years during which the various districts of Nejd were m charge ot (Governors appointed by the Emir of Hail, representatives of the Sand family were reduced to puppets, and Nejd, in effect, became a vassal State of Hail The historv of Neid now reaches the period from which emerged the latest ■strong ruler of the House of Saud, Abdul Aziz-bin-Saud. the present King of Saudi Arabia. Abdul Aziz, born in 1875, son of Abd-er-Rahman-hin-Saud, was in exile with his father at Koweit when his uncle, the nominal Emir of Nejd, was murdered by order of Ibn Rashid in 1902. With only forty men Abdul Aziz pntered the Sedeir district of Nejd, secured support there, marched on Riyadh,, which welcomed him, and ended the Rashidi domination the same year. Recognising the energy and outstanding qualifications for leadership shown h&gt; Abdul Aziz, his father, Ahd-er-Rahman, renounced his own claims to the Emirate accepted his son as Emir and, assuming the title of ' Imam, took the direction of religious affairs in Riyadh. By 1904 the Emir was master of all Southern Nejd. He marched on Qasim in that year, but was compelled to retire by a force co-operating with the Emir of Hail. In 1906, however, he made anoth attempt and this time succeeded in imposing partial subjection and payment of tribute upon Qasim, both of which he maintained at the cost of recuire fight in S moVa h n e gerTh r reatOTed the Emir both from within and without. Certain grandsons of his late uncle, Saud, claimed the Emirate for their own branch and sought to raise the southern provinces, Khar] and Hanq, m rebellion, the same time Abdullah, second son of the Emir of Mecca entered Qasim with a Heiazi force to support the rights of the Ateibah tribe said to have been infringed by the Emir of Nejd. This Emir's younger brother, wbo^as his repi-esentati^ in Qasim, was made prisoner. Ibn Rashid Emir , .

Hasa was the territory thirwas 7 open to conquest by borders of earlier Nejd, or w t i increase the meagre resources of his State; ^ h - ~ - f ^ [11932]12 Without success he had endeavoured to enlist the support of the Indian Govern ment by offering a renewal of the declaration made in 1866 by his uncle, the Emir Abdullah, to His Majesty's Government regarding British interests in the Persian Gulf.( 8 ) But he was soon to have his opportunity for conquest. At a time when Turkey had her hands full with the Balkan War, and the Emirate of Hail was enfeebled by the dissensions of the Rashid family, some of Ibn Saud's rebellious relatives were enjoying friendly refuge in Hasa territory. They were said, moreover, to be preparing an attack against him. Here were both opportunity and reasonable excuse for prompt action by the Emir of Nejd. Early in 1913 he marched into Hasa, captured Hofuf on the 5th May, and on the 15th May compelled the Turkish garrison of Qatif, the chief seaport, to surrender. The Governor and garrison he allowed to return to Ottoman territory by way of Oqair and Qatar. At the same time His Majesty's Government were negotiating a convention with the Ottoman Government regarding the Persian Gulf and adjacent terri tories. Little was known about the inland Emirate of Nejd, which had had no direct contact with the Gulf and British officials for many years. That it was an Emirate capable of over-running and permanently holding a Turkish province, and that its ruler was really a figure of outstanding importance in Arabian politics, were facts still to be recognised. In negotiating the convention, there fore, His Majesty's Government attached very little importance to Nejd and its Emir. The convention was signed on the 29th July, 1913. The eleventh article of this instrument defined the 'Ottoman Sanjak of Nejd' in such a way that it was made to include not only the coast-line and Province of Hasa, but Central Nejd as well. It thus implied that the Emir was an Ottoman subject and his action against the Turks nothing but rebellion. Having committed themselves to these views, His Majesty's Government were placed in a difficult position when the Emir, unrecognised by the Turks, maintained himself as de facto ruler of Hasa and 300 miles of the Gulf coast-line and made overtures to the Indian Government. Whatever his status in theory. His Majesty's Government could not avoid having direct relations with a ruler of this weight who held so much of the Gulf coast. Acting under instructions from the British Resident in the Persian Gulf {Sir Percy Cox), the British Political Agents at Koweit and Bahrein, the former being Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., went to Oqair, where they conferred with Ibn Saud on the 15th and 16th December, 1913, He showed much friendli ness, invited His Majesty's Government to keep the peace on the coast and revealed the terms the Turks were endeavouring to impose on him. These terms included the readmission of Turkish garrisons; that all communications from foreign Poweis or their agents should be handed over to and dealt with by the Turks; the exclusion of foreigners and their agents from the province, and no concessions to foreigners for railways or motor-car services. In effect, Ibn Saud now desired British mediation. In a memorandum of the 9th March, 1914. His Majesty's Government explained their difficulties m regard to Ibn Saud to the Turkish Government entered a protest against the last three of the Turkish conditions above cited and defined what they themselves required of Ibn Saud. Their requirements included no interference with other Arab principalities in the Gulf; co-operation in main taining the maritime truce in the Gulf for the suppression of piracy • co-operation in suppressing arms traffic; free admission of British traders to Qatif Meanwhile negotiations between the Turks and Ibn Saud continued and on the 15th May, 1914, the Emir signed a treaty with the Vali of Basra. It placed the Vilayet of Nejd in charge of Ibn Saud for life, with succession to his descendants by Imperial firman; it readmitted Turkish troops to the seaports of Hasa; it provided for the Turkish flag being flown and forbade the Emir to take part in foreign affairs or to grant concessions to foreigners. It also required the Emir to aid 1 urkey in war when requested by the Imperial Government. In June the Emir accepted the title of ' Vali of Nejd and Hasa,' but is said not to have regarded it seriously. From the signing of the Anglo-Turkish convention on the 29th July 1913 to the outbreak ot war between the signatories on the 31st October 1914 His Majesty s Government discouraged the advances which Ibn Saud made to them.

Captain Shakespear reached Ibn Sand's camp on the 31st December, 1914, and discussed with him the nolitical situation. It appeared that Ibn Saud was resolved to remain neutra until he could secure a binding treaty with the British Government, and that what he sought was a solid guarantee of his position under what would be, m ^ British suzerainty. On the 4th January, 1915, Captain Shakespear was able to send Sir P. Cox a translation of Ibn Saud's rough draft of the treaty he proposed. When forwarding this document. Captain Shakespear added some observations of his own : ' I venture to submit,' he wrote, ' that Ibn Saud in effect asks (in his rough rlraft of a treatv) for little more than what has been already conveyed m the let ng Residents assurances (the proposals of a British guarantee already mentiSned) if these were meant to apply to the future and were not limited to the present crisis, and if they are interpreted liberally and generously^ In exchange Ibn Saud offers to make himself a British vassal for good reply would be m o st /^antageous to^Great B^ ^ ^ lorig ^ be repeated here; frran that officei da e advised the Emir to temporise further, pleading suffice it to say that Ibn bai Heiazi seaports.

Indeed, at the beginning of January 1915, the Emir of Mecca was uncertain on which side he could range himself with the greater prospect of advantage. His inclinations and judgment impelled him to support Great Britain, but Turkish garrisons were on his land, holding all his chief cities; the war had not begun well for the Allies; he had everything to lose by taking part in unsuccessful hostilities against the Turk. While thus in doubt he received Ibn Sand's reply to Abdullah's letter. That the Emir of Nejd's advice carried weight in the councils of Mecca is not open to question. Thus encouraged to withstand Turkish pressure, the Chief of the Prophet's Tribe continued to temporise; sixteen months were to elapse before he actually rose in arms against the Turks. Meanwhile, he made no move, and those who looked to Mecca for a lead saw no sign, drew their own conclusions and the ^ihad became merely Turkish in its authority and left Arabia unstirred. Nor was Mecca's silence at this critical time without its influence in the wider Islam. But to return to events in Nejd. Ibn Saud had on the 19th January alreadv begun operations against Ibn Rashid, who, with his pro-Turkish confederation oi tribes, had entered Northern Nejd The two forces, in great strength for Arabia, encountered at Jerab, near Majmaa, on the 24th January. The battle resulted in a draw, a result more favourable for Ibn Saud than for Ibn Rashid Hostilities were tacitly suspended, but Ibn Rashid was put out of action; he could not join the Turks as he had intended and could not take part in the early campaign m Mesopotamia, when his appearance might have added considerablv ^ M . a J est y s Government s difficulties. A formal peace was signed bv the rival Emirs on the 10th June, 1915. In this treaty Ibn Rashid recognised all Ibn baud s claims except that of over-lordship and confined his own iurisdiction to Hail its villages, and the Shammar tribes. It is clear too that he renounced a pietensions to Qasim. But the treaty did not have permanent results and relations between the two Emirs remained a condition of armed neutralitv varied by actual hostilities. 4.1. A ^'. ater S au d had to deal with a serious rising in Northern Hasa bv the Ajman tribe He suppressed the movement, but lost his brother in the fiffhtin^ r? 11 ! himself. He then had trouble in Southern Hasa with the A1 Murrah tribe whom he attacked because it had sided with Ibn Rashid. His diffaculties with these tribes arose from the strictness of his rule compared with that of the I urks. During these struggles the British Government assisted the despatch of arms and ammunitions from Bahrein to Ibn Saud and in October presented him with 1,000 rifles and made him a loan of £20.000. ti L' November 1915 the Sherif of Mecca seized the opportunity presented bv Ibn Saud s embarrassments to send Abdullah with a considerable force into Western Nejd Nominally the purpose of this singularly ill-timed incursion was to collect taxes from the Ateibah tribe, but sublequeiit information shows nat the leal object was political and that it was to support the Sherif's interests or pretensions in Southern Qasim, a district claimed by the Ateibah The force got within .0 miles of Riyadh on the Mecca-Riyadh road, before it retired As might have been expected, the movement excited Ibn Sand's violent indiena- l- 1 '.f 118 ?!, J! to to His Majesty's Government that, if they could ot keep the Sherif s activities within bounds, he would have to do so himself £ xrji'z'LTzfr ' m •' the »'» Meanwhile, Ibn Saud followed a pro-British and anti-Turkish policv. and negotiations for a treaty with His Majesty's Government were continued' the reasons making such a treaty desirable from the British point of view are stated 30th .Cu , ary, 1 T9 t L5 n :i r0m ^ India 0ffice t0 the Fo ^ ei g n 0ffice ' dated the m.n'wn M| S .I lablll f ty of , c o nolud j n g a treaty with Emir Abdul Aziz (Ibn feciud) follows not merely from the exigencies of the moment which made it necessary to pay an immediate price for his friendship, but also from the general situation that will be created in the Persian Gulf in the event as the tTlich ffisK ^ 0f the disa PP^rance of Turkish rut fr'om sLra the Fmh'^if ™ men t ar e pledged.

The extent, therefore, to which his claims must be met must be measured not only by the immediate services, which he may be expected to render but also by the potential powers for mischief which, in the event of success, he will possess, and if permanently estranged will doubtless 5 ? exercise Negotiations for the treaty were protracted, but the instrument was eventually signed at Qatif by Sir P.

His misgivings were reflected in his conversation with Sir Percy Cox in December 1915, when he reminded the Chief Political Officer that Wahabis recognised no Caliph after the first four, and added that, if the Emir of Mecca should assume the title, it would make no difference to his status among other Arab rulers. Ibn Saud would appear, in fact, to have scented the wider political ambitions to which the war had given rise in Husein, and was now on his guard. V.— The Sheikhdom of Koweit ruled hy the Sheikh of Koweit. At the time of the Arab rising in 1916, Koweit was of small importance in wider Arabian politics, and its interests pertained as much to the Basra Vilayet as to the peninsula. British influence was paramount. The sheikhdom was generally in rivalry with the Emirs of Hail, but had always been friendly with Ibn Saud. It therefore requires some mention here. Koweit had a coastline to the Persian Gulf of 200 miles, an undefined maximum breadth of 150 miles, and an area of about 20,000 square miles. Its surface is chiefly desert, so much so that of the settled population of about 37,000 at the period under review, all but 2,000 resided in the town of Koweit, and the nomad population was estimated at only 13,000. The sheikhdom had, in fact, no political power, nor the prospect of attaining any. It owed its position as an autonomous sheikhdom to British support, given because the harbour of Koweit was the best in the northern part of the Persian Gulf coast and became the prospective terminal point of the Constantinople-Bagdad Railway. Until the last years of the 19th century Koweit was only an insignificant sheikhdom, with a jurisdiction extending little beyond the town. In 1871, when Midhat Pasha began a policy of Ottoman expansion in Arabia, the Sheikh of Koweit declared himself an Ottoman subject, accepted the rank of kaimakam, and his territory was nominally incorporated in the Vilayet of Basra. But the Indian Government never accepted this arrangement; they were therefore able to insist on dealing directly with the sheikh, Mobarak-us-Suba, when in 1899 the question of a Persian Gulf terminus for the extension of the Constantinople- Bagdad Railway began to loom above the horizon. On the 23rd January of that year the sheikh signed a treaty( n ) with Great Britain, which secured British predominance. In 1904 he accepted the appointment of a British Political Agent at his Court. In return Mobarak was given a subsidy. The Turks made repeated efforts to coerce him by means of Ibn Rashid, from whose forces he was saved in 1905 only by a British landing-party. In 1907 the British Government made a more specific agreement with Mobarak, by which they secured a perpetual base on the foreshore of the Bandar Shuweikh Basin in Koweit harbour, and the right of pre-empting all or any part of his territory which he might propose to alienate. In return they promised that '' the town of Koweit and its boundaries belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba and his heirs after him.' In the Anglo-Turkish Convention^ 1 ) of the 29th July, 1913, the territory of Koweit was recognised as an 'autonomous kaza of the Ottoman Empire,' and the sheikh therefore acknowledged the suzerainty of the Turkish Sultan. His territorial boundaries were defined, practical autonomy was conceded to him, and the validity of his agreements with His Majesty's Government, including the base of land and His Majesty's Government's right to give him support, was admitted by the Porte. On the outbreak of the war Mobarak formally repudiated all connexion with the Ottoman Empire, and in November 1914, His Majesty's Government promised, in return for help against the Turks, ' that Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.' The sheikh died at the close of 1915. VI.— The Emirate of Jehel Shammar {or Hail) ruled hy the Emir of Hail I he portion of Northern Central Arabia known geographicallv as Jebel Shammar, the territory of the great Shammar tribe, formed another of the independent Arabian states at the time of the Arab rising.

Jebel Selmah is not so fine and is considerably smaller in extent. The greatest altitude of each is less thai' 5 600 feet above sea-level. The general surface of the Arabian plateau, thinh falls gradually from south-west to north-east, has hereabouts an elevation o 300 feet The visible height of these Shammar mountains is, therefore, correspondingly diminished, and, except for peaks, does not average more than 1 000 feet above the level of the surrounding country. Jebel Afa has a westward continuation in the form of crags and isolated hills of no great height for above 100 miles- Jebel Selmah has a similar continuation southward foi about half ttot Stance All this broken country is included under the comprehensive name pfeimtlti h n a ru a sed by these mountain ranges has made Jebel Shammar an area favourable for Arab life. Springs abound, though making no underatound water is plentiful and easily reached; there are many oases, and the rainfall is sufficient to ensure pasturage, not only m the upland countiy, but, sorine even on the adjoining sands of the IMefud desert. ifnon this eeoeraphioal Jebel Shammar as a centre, a political Jebel ^hammar arose whose confines varied from time to time with the flu( ^ ua mg IrC^fof ite Emirs in conflict with their neighbours.

Hail now history since the coming of Islam, cleteare D [11932]18 became the capital of Central Arabia, from Jauf-el-Amir, on the edge of the Syrian desert, to the Great Desert of the south, and Mohammed ruled as sole Emir until his death in 1897. How Nejd, under Abdul Aziz-bin-Saud, the present King of Saudi Arabia and Sultan of Nejd, recovered its independence in 1902, has already been related. Towards the close of his reign Mohammed adopted a pro-Turkish policy, which was followed consistently by his successors in return for Turkish support. Explanation of this policy may be found partly in the comparative ease with which Turkish support or Turkish pressure could be directed upon Hail from Samawa on the Euphrates, and later from the Hejaz Railway. Support, there fore, became an alternative the Emirs of Jebel Shammar found preferable to coercion. On various occasions, especially in 1904 and 1905, Ottoman forces assisted the Emirate in its struggle against Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit. Moreover, an aim of Turkish policy at this time was to use Jebel Shammar against supposed British ambitions in Arabia, particularly in the Persian Gulf, where, in the Turkish view, His Majesty's Government had secured the Sheikh of Koweit as a dependent, and, through him, were promoting their interests to the disadvantage of those of the Ottoman Empire. To this end Ibn Rashid was pushed by the Turks into attacking the town of Koweit in 1905, a movement which was countered by His Majesty's Government landing a naval force in support of the sheikh. After the death of Mohammed no ruler had the strength and personality necessary to hold the widespread Emirate of Jebel Shammar together. Indeed, during these years, the House of Rashid was divided against itself, and was infamous throughout Arabia for repeated resort to murder as a convenient means of gaining the succession. In 1906 the ruling Emir, Abd-el-Aziz, was killed in battle with the forces of Ibn Saud and the Mutair tribe in alliance with him. In 1908 a boy of ten, Saud-bin-Rashid, became Emir and was supported in the position until able to direct affairs himself. He ruled Jebel Shammar during the period of the war. Notwithstanding the fact that the innate solidity and loyalty of the Shammar tribe was never better exhibited than under this Emir, his reign witnessed further curtailment of the Emirate. Hostilities with Nejd were almost continuous. In 1910 Ibn Saud compelled Jebel Shammar to surrender the Province of Qasim to his suzerainty. In 1912 Jauf-el-Amir was seized by the Ruwalla sheikh, Nuri-esh-Shalan, who successfully maintained himself against determined Shammar attacks particularly in 1914. When Turkey entered the war in October 1914, Emir Ibn Rashid, then a featherbrained youth of sixteen, already noted for irresponsible violence, worked hand in hand with the Turks. He supplied them, with camels, was actively hostile to the Sheikh of Koweit and the Euphrates tribes who were friendly towards the Allies, and received presents of money, motor cars, rifles, ammunition and even a few machine guns from the Turkish'Government. It seems that he undertook to operate against the Allied flank in Mesopotamia. Probably he would have caused trouble in this quarter but for the campaign started against him in January 1915 by the Emir of Nejd. The battle of Jerrab, near Majmaa, which resulted on the 24th January, may have been indecisive, but it put Ibn Rashid s force out of action for a time and produced a treaty of peace in which the advantage lay with Ibn Saud. By this treaty, signed on the 10th June, 1915, Ibn Rashid's authority was confined to the narrower Jebel Shammar. He withdrew his pretensions to Qasim, and acknowledged Ibn Sand's suzerainty over certain tribes, a matter hitherto in question, and rejected only the Emir of Nejd's claim to the overlordship of Jebel Shammar. But the peace which followed had no reality and Ibn Rashid merely awaited his opportunity. VII.— J auf-el-A mir. The part of Northern Arabia lying around Jauf-el-Amir, which in 1910 came under the independent government of Nuri-esh-Shalan, Paramount Chief of the Ruwalla, cannot be regarded as having been one of the chief autonomous areas of Arabia. It was too limited in resources and could not have direct relations with the outer world in a way possible to a State owning a seaboard. The Yemen, Asir, Nejd, and, in less degree, Jebel Shammar, all had their bases in large settled populations of cultivators; the Hejaz, in the accident that it was the Holy Land of Islam. Jauf, however, had no such permanent foundations. Jauf, as an—-— 19 independent area, rested upon a confederation of purely nomad tribes, who, while ranging over desert and steppe larger in extent than Great Britain, made the Jauf group of oases their rallying point and centre of supplies. Further, tribal confederation and the capture of Jauf alike, were due to the personality of the Paramount Chief, Nuri-esh-Shalan, whom Colonel T. E. Lawrence described as the best Arab sheikh he ever met. It always seemed that the natural condition of Jauf would be one of dependency either upon a powerful Jebel Shammar or on a greater central Arabian State, which included Jebel Shammar, or, again, upon a power seated in the north, such as, for instance, an independent Syria. To cither of such dominant neighbours, south or north, Jauf would have been a valuable possession, as controlling the one route across the desert which separated Central Arabia from Syria. By this route Jauf is about 260 miles from Hail, in Jebel Shammar, and 350 miles from Damascus. Jauf had also a further strategical importance which made itself felt. In the event of the construction of a railway from the north into Central Arabia, the route to be followed would lie from the Hejaz Railway at Jizah in Transjordan and thence up the Wadi Sirhan to Jauf. ' As far as is known no other route is practicable. Jauf-el-Amir (so called to distinguish it from other Jaufs) is merely an oasis a few miles in length, in a depression at the head of the Great Wadi Sirhan. To the north-east are several smaller oases. The group stands in the midst of desert and derives its chief importance from that fact. Jauf was subject to the Emirate of Neid during the period of Wahabi conquests, and later to the Emirate of Jebel Shammar In 1910 Nuri-esh-Shalan, a nomad chieftain whose authority extended over a confederacy of Aneiza tribes, seized the group of oases and with stood all the efforts of the Emir of Jebel Shammar to eject him. , _ In 1916 the population of the oasis group of Jauf did not exceed 11 ,000, but the tribal confederacy of nomads recognising Nuri, a confederacy whose ranging- grounds extended from Jauf in the south to Damascus m the north, and to what is now Transiordan in the west, may have numbered as many as 20,000 souls. Upon this wandering and widely-dispersed population alone rested Nun-esh- Shalan's ability to maintain himself in Jauf. r. rr i • i The northern portion of the confederacy came withm the reach of Turkish authority. Nuri and his House therefore took a lively interest m Turkish aliaiis as matters closely concerning their own future In 1911 the Paramount Chief was invited to Damascus by the Vali, Sami Pasha and was there imprisoned for a vear This indignity alienated him from the Turkish cause. In 1913 the Turkish Government proposed to carry a branch of th ® over to Qaf in the Wadi Sirhan, for the purpose of extending Turkish a ^ h ority o the desert tribes. The scheme was violently opposed by ^^1 and had^to^be abandoned in consequence.

It is recognised that, owing to the nature of the country and the paucity o£ communications, there is no military danger to Burma from the direction of China, The frontier area between the two countries is generally quiet, although there are sional raids from the Chinese side. On both sides of the frontier over most of occa its length the country is divided up among Shan Sawbwas, Wa and Kachin chiefs. 2. After the annexation of Upper Burma in 1886 there was signed with the Chinese Government in 1894 a Convention, later modified by another Convention signed in 1897, which fixed the frontier between Burma and China south of latitude 25° 35' N. In accordance with the terms of the 1897 Convention a Joint Commission was subsequently appointed to verify and demarcate and, if necessary, rectify the frontier as fixed by the Conventions. Agreement was reached by the Commission regarding the demarcation of the greater part of the frontier line, but agreement was not reached in regard to a section approximately 200 miles in length, extending from latitude 23° 30' N. to latitude 22° 10' N. through the difficult and unexplored country occupied by the savage and backward Was. The Chinese Commissioner declined to accept the apparent intention of the relevant Article of the 1897 Convention, which, though it is not altogether clear, definitely prescribes in this area a frontier based on certain co-ordinated points and the Salween-Mekong Watershed. 3. The section of the frontier between latitude 25° 35' N. and Tibet was the cause of a certain amount of friction with the Chinese before the war, and slave- freeing expeditions, which have been carried out more or less regularly during the last 10 years in the area known as the Triangle, in the neighbourhood of this section of the frontier, led the Chinese to renew their claims m 1930 ; but the issue is at present dormant. 4. As regards the undelimited frontier in the Wa States, a frontier line known as the Scott Line, after the British Commissioner, Sir George Scott, was m 1901 notified to the Chinese as that which would be provisionally recognised by His^ Maiestv's Government as the frontier. This line included m Burma the bulk ot the Wa tribesmen. The most westerly line claimed during the negotiations by the Chinese has come to be known as the Liuchm Line and, as it runs through : middle of the Wa country, is regarded by His Majesty s Government as an inconvenient administrative frontier. 5.

During August and September 1934 the Chinese withdrew to the east of the Scott Line, partly because of the difficulties they met with in obtaining supplies and partly, no doubt, because of the firm protests which were made to the Chinese Government. A force of about 700 Burma Military Police have since been kept in the field and conditions in the Wa States have been generally quiet. 7. Meanwhile negotiations with the Chinese Government for the determination of the section of the frontier in dispute were taken in hand. On 9th April 1935 His Majesty's Minister at Peking completed an Exchange of Notes with the Chinese Government providing for the establishment of a Joint Boundary Commission consisting of two representatives of each Government and a neutral Chairman to be appointed by the President of the Council of the League of Nations. The first duty of the Commission is to ascertain and determine on the ground and fix on the map the frontier line prescribed by the 1897 Convention. They will also report ad referendum to the two Governments in the light of their local examination of the ground the cases in which the question appears to them to arise of local modifi cations of the general treaty line on the basis of mutual concessions. In a separate Exchange of Notes the two Governments agreed that the question of any modifications in the frontier line in the light of the report of the Commission or m the light of such topographical, historical or political factors as may appear relevant, will be subsequently negotiated and. if necessary, a conference will be held for this purpose at Nanking. The results of the report of the Commission and of any such subsequent negotiations will then be embodied in a new Agreement. 8. It is possible for the Boundary Commission to work only during the open season, which runs from December until May. The President of the Council of the League of Nations has appointed as Chairman of the Boundary Commission Colonel Iselin, a fewiss national, ^ ho has already presided over a similar Commission which demarcated the frontier between Iraq and Syria and appears to be a most suitable choice. Ihe British Commissioners will be Mr. Clague and Mr. Grose, two officers of the Government of Burma. It is hoped that the Commission will start work in the field m December and the Government of Burma has been authorised to correspond direct with the Chinese Government, through His Majesty's Minister at Peking, on the question of the route to be followed by the Commission and other details regarding its organisation. P olitical D epartment, 14th June 1935.Political Department. SECRET. P.Z. 6650/35 RECENT EVENTS IN TIBET. 1. British Interests. Our interests in Tibet are the maintenance there of an autonomous State under a stable and friendly Grcvernment, able to preserve order and keep the peace beyond the northern frontier of India, and the exclusion from Tibet of any influence hostile to ourselves, such as that of the Soviet Union. It follows that the exclusion of Chinese administration is also desirable, because its unpopularity and inefficiency would lead to disorder, and because of the possibility that at some time in the future the Government of China, and hence Tibet, might fall under Soviet or Japanese control. The policy hitherto pursued by the Tibetan Government of discouraging the entry of Europeans into their 'country also accords —generally speaking—with our interests. Hecefit Ojjicxcil I isits to LTiasd, The Government of Indja act as the agent of His Majesty's Government for conducting relations with the Government of Tibet through the channel of the Political Officer in Sikkim. Since Sir C. Bell's visit to Lhasa in 1921, visits were paid by the Political Officer in 1924 (Colonel Bailey), 1930 (Colonel Weir), 1932 and [933 (Mr. Williamson). Trade Agencies are maintained at Yatung and Gyantse. 3. Our Position in regard to Tibet vis-a-vis China. —Tripartite negotiations took place at Simla in 1914 between China, Tibet and Great Britain regarding the questions (among others) of the status and frontiers of Tibet. So far as China was concerned these negotiations eventually failed (over the question of the Sino-Tibetan frontier), but the Convention, which had been initialled, was accepted by the British and Tibetan Governments as binding between themselves. In 1919 His Majesty's Government took the matter up again with the Chinese Government. The latter, however, after a time showed reluctance to continue the discussions, and eventually in 1921 they were informed in writing that His Majesty's Government did not feel justified in withholding any longer their recognition of the status of Tibet as an autonomous State under the suzerainty of China, and that they intended to deal on this basis with Tibet in the future. At the same time the Chinese Government were informed orally that we should regard ourselves as at liberty to deal with Tibet without again referring to China, to enter into closer relations with her, to send an officer to Lhasa from time to time, and to give the Tibetans any reasonable assistance they might require in the development and protection of their country. In 1921 His Majesty's Government also undertook to the Tibetan Government to give them reasonable assistance in the protection and development of Tibet, and therefore to permit them to import on payment munitions in instalments, provided that they gave an assurance that such munitions would be used solely for self- defence and internal police work. This promise covered the import of 10 mountain guns, 20 machine guns and 10,000 rifles with ammunition. By 1933 all this materia] had been supplied by the Government of India. 4. Sino-Tibetan Frontier. —Since 1930 there has been occasional fighting between Tibetan and Chinese forces on their common frontier, and in 1932 the Tibetan Government asked His Majesty's Government to mediate with the Chinese Government regarding the Sino-Tibetan frontier The Chinese Govern ment refused to accept our mediation, although fighting was stopped. The Dalai Lama, however, was clearly very apprehensive, and in January 1933 renewed his request for our mediation for the permanent settlement of the frontier issue, ile was told in reply in March 1933 that in view of His Majesty's Government's warm friendship for Tibet and keen interest in everything that affects her welfare, they were anxious to seek a permanent solution of the frontier difficulties and to give every possible assistance to that end, but that further pressure on the Chinese to accept mediation would be unlikely to bear fruit. The reply then stated : ' Should Your Holiness decide in these circumstances to accept the Chinese offer of direct negotiations on the frontier question. His Majesty's Government would follow the course of the discussions with great interest and would, of course, be glad if they should lead to a settlement satisfactory to Tibet. I am to add that if Your Holiness should decide to agree to direct negotiations. His Majesty's Government would be ready with friendly advice at all times during and after 4087—7 35 9.35sudi negotiations whenever you required it. If any proposal which was acceptable to the iibetan CTOvernment should emerge from the discussions His Maiestv'q Government would be prepared to offer diplomatic assistance to induce the Chinese ( .overument to conclude an agreement.' This reply was well received hv the Ualai Lama, and appears to have had a reassuring effect. His Majesty's Govern I ' ent ,j; 1 ' l e ' of c ' u rae, less directly interested in the question of the 'location of the omo-1 ibetan boundary than in those of the status of Tibet and her constitutional 1 cicitions wiiii unina. 5 - C7 ^!f se Mission to Lhasa m 1934.—Before the suggested direct negotiations between libet and ( lima developed, the Dalai Lama died in December 1933 The Chinese Government immediately decided to send a Mission of condolence to Lhasa' Huang Mu-sung, the leader of this Mission, arrived at Lhasa, having travelled overland, m August 1934 and left iu December 1934, returning to China via India 1 entative negotiations took place regarding the questions at issue between China and Tibet Huang Mu-sung offered the Tibetan Government substantial con cessions in respect of the Smo-l ibetan frontier and asked in return for the lollowmg:— c (1) An admission of Tibet's subordination to China.

Status of Bhutan—The question whether the status of Bhutan is that of an Indian or a foreign btate is still not precisely determined. Though the Maharaja's predecessor in 1911 paid homage to the King, and the Government of India control the foreign relations of Bhutan, they do not interfere, as they have the power—in certain circumstances—to do in any Indian State, in the internal administration. In 1924 the Secretary of State stated in a despatch that Bhutan ' has at least reached a position from which transition to the status of an Indian State can easily, with the mutual concurrence of both parties, be effected, if this should hereafter appear desirable.' It is not contemplated that Bhutan should be regarded as eligible for federation. Political Department, 27th June 1935.mm r j 0 A \ (f 'if Political Department. SECRET. NEPAL. The British interests in Nepal are the maintenance over a long section of India's northern frontier of a stable and friendly Government. We depend on their goodwill for the recruitment of the 20 Gurkha battalions of the Indian Army and for the ability to employ them overseas, since the Nepal authorities can give or withhold subsequent purification (' pani patya ') or dispensation from the penalty of outcasting. Moreover, the Nepalese Government have on occasion supplied assistance from their own army for duty in India. 2. The nominal King of Nepal (Maharajadhiraja) has no political functions at all, but is the Head of the State for purely ceremonial purposes. The Government is an autocracy under a hereditary Prime Minister and his family council ; the succession to the office of Prime Minister is regulated by a definite Roll of Succession and passes from brother to brother in the same family, and then to the next generation according to age. In the past various Prime Ministers have placed sons by low-caste and therefore illegitimate wives on this roll, though this w T as regarded as a- questionable proceeding. Sir Chandra Shumshere, after having been Prime Minister of Nepal for nearly 30 years, died in 1929, and was peaceably succeeded in turn by his two brothers. Sir Bhim Shumshere, who died in 1932, and Sir Joodha Shumshere. Sir Joodha is a man of little real character or intellect, XncT the sons of Sir Chandra, namely. Sir Mohan, Sir Babar and Sir Kaisar Shumshere, men of progressive ideas, have a great and increasing influence over the administration. The next name on the RoJlof Succession was that of General Rudra Shumshere, but he is one of the illegitimate members of the family referred to above. In March 1934 the sons of Sir Chandra secured the removal of Rudra and all the other illegitimate members from the Roll, and their arrest and banishment to outlying districts. Obvious self-interest was the motive of this coup d'etat, but it solved in advance what would have been a dangerous problem of the near future, for it is improbable that Rudra's succession could have taken place without bloodshed. 3. In 1933 the Government of Nepal decided that they ought to enter into direct relations with His Majesty's Government, partly because of fears as to their future relations with a reformed Government of India, and partly in order to signalise the independent status of their country, about which they are very sensitive. A visit to Katmandu in May 1933 by an Italian Mission (which has since been followed by French, Chinese, and Belgian Missions; precipitated this issue, and the Nepalese Government expressed a desire for the elevation of the status of our representative at Katmandu (who since 1920 had been styled ' British Envoy at the Court of Nepal') to that of a Minister, and for the appointment of a Nepalese Minister in London. This was agreed to and Sir Bahadur Shumshere, the eldest son of Sir Joodha, led a special Mission to London in May-June 1934, in order to confer a Nepalese decoration on the King, and remain as first Nepalese Minister. Sir Bahadur Shumshere subsequently also led a Mission to Rome to confer the same decoration on the King of Italy. 4. When it was decided to raise the status of the British Envoy at Katmandu to that of a Minister, agreement was reached between the India Office and the Foreign Office that, like the post of Minister at Kabul, it will ordinarily be filled by an officer seconded from the Indian Political Department and recommended by the Government of India. The Minister is also authorised to conespond dnect with the Government of India and to act at once on the Government of India s recommendations, subject to the general constitutional control of the Secretary of State for India in regard to all matters which exclusively concern Nepal and India and have no bearing on Nepal's relations with other Powers. In matters of wider concern the Minister addresses the Foreign Office, and the procedure m regard to such correspondence is similar to that in regard to correspondence about Afghanistan, i.e. the consideration of questions is initiated by the India Omce and proposals are then referred to the Foreign Office for concurrence. 5. The Nepalese Government recently repeated a request, which has several times been considered in the past, for the capitalisation, by the cession of and oi 4087—6 35 9.35 P.Z. 6649/35 450 1the payment of a lump sum, of the annual present of Rs. 10 lakhs, which is made to them by the Government of India in recognition of their help during the war and the Afghan War of 1919, when contingents of the Nepalese Army were lent for service in India. This request is now under renewed consideration. 6. The Government of Nepal have shown some anxiety as to the consequences to them of constitutional developments in India. Misapprehending the scope of the proposed reforms, they were afraid that the reformed Government 'might have power to adopt a less friendly attitude towards Nepal. In particular, they no doubt had in mind the possibility of difficulties regarding the maintenance of the Gurkha battalions in the Indian Army, and they have given expression to their fear as to the continued payment of the annual present of Rs. 10 lakhs. They may also have some misgivings lest democratic and possibly subversive ideas might spread without sufficient check from India, and particularly from the many Nepalese subjects resident in India, to the people of Nepal, where there are already faint but audible indications of discontent with the present autocratic regime. In order to remove these misapprehensions, Sir Samuel Hoare gave an interview on 22nd May 1935 to Sir Bahadur Shumshere (who is shortly returning to Nepal) and explained to him the effect of the safeguards in the Bill and, in particular, of the provisions for the reservation of defence and foreign affairs. Sir Bahadur asked that a letter should be sent to him, setting out the position, and this is about to issue from the Foreign Office.

Qnd to cover events subsequent to the letter date. 1. British Int r&lt;-:sts . Cur primary inter:.; t continues to bt the inn intern nee of Tibet aa a buffer state from \. 7 hich any influence h&lt; stile to Inclit rhould be so far as possible excluded. The threat of such :i hostile influence permeating Tib^t has come nearer durir:^ the last i ivc years, i? connection vyith which tv70 factors are to be taken into account. The; first is the^Sino-Japanese v/ar in conseque2:ce of which it is possible t ith^r tlat the Chinese GC'Vernnont driven into the 'Vest, may come to take a more active interest in Tibet, or that Japrn may herself eventually come forward f,s the more dangerous and aggresive heir to Chinese claims in that country. The second factor is the Russian domination of Sinkiang, which has now locomo for all practical purposes complete, as a result gf which it appears that Russian garrisons are now located at certain points adjacent to the northern frontier of Tibet. It m'.y be recognised th. t there is in the long run considerably less to fear from Chinese influence in Tibbt 'than there would' be froi.i that of either Russia or Japan. 2. British Mission to Lhasa . Mr /.Villiamson's I'ijs ion was cut short by his death at Lhasa in November, 1933* '^ 1C was decided that, in view of the Chinese Government's intention to send an escort of officials and three hundred soldiers v/ith the Tashi Lama on his return to Tibet, a further visit by the' Fc litical Officer in Sikkim tc Lhasa was advisable in order to maintain touch, report on the situati a and be at hand for possible mediation between the Tibetan Coverrment and the Tashi Lama. It was also decided to include in the Kissicn Brigadier Neame of the Indian General Stafl in order to obtain expert first-hand military opinion on the military strength of Tibet '-nd on the measures that would be practicable for increasing the military strength of the country. The Mission reached Lhasa on the 24th August, 193^• ^ succeeded in maintaining a friendly contact with the Tibetan Government and neutralising the influence of the Chinese representative ; t Lhasa,and it also had an undoubtedly potent influence as a conciliator, though not as an official mediator, between that Government and the Tashi Lama. Brigadier Kbame 1 3 estimate of the military efficiency of Tib^t was not flattering. A small British Mission has maintained a pied a terrc at Lhasa ever since, and this Mission was joined in January this year by I.'Jr. Gould, the pr sent Political Ofi'icer in Sikkir^, for the celebrations in connection with the installation of the new Dalai Lama. The Mission officers have unioubtedly performed admirable work at Lhasa during theoe last few years in gaining the confidence and friendship of many of the leading Tibetan officials. 3. The T&lt;'-shi Lama . The Tashi Lama died on thu 3Cth November, 1937, and the question of his return to Tibet which had been causing II, so much difficulty,was thereby removed, No reincarnation has yet bev^/ r &lt;. xscovored. 4. T he Dala i Jama . By far the most important event recently j in Tibet has been the discovery of the 14th Incarnation of the Dal' Lama, and his installaticn at Lhasa. The child was disoc^vered in/the district of Silling, on the Chinese side of the Tibetan border, --/d arrived at Lhasa on the bth Cctobor 1939t accompanied by a ChincVe escortof 203C men. Th^ fcr .nl ins t-'.lie. ticn ceroncnics took plncu at Uviza at the end of February. 1940 at v/hich the Chinese Go Vermont were rt.presented by a niseicn headed by I,jr .V.u Chung-Hsin, Presi dent of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Corx'ittee » II* #Gould, the Political Officer in Sikkir., was deputed to attend as the representative of K.L '.G. and the Govermont of India. Apart from the custcp.iry ceremonial presents, li-.Gculd v/as also provided with scire nore porscnal gifts, selected with a one human insight as suitable for a child of six. It is reported that the-Dalai Lara was delighted with therr.. In all the proceedings that have led up to the final reco^niti .n of the Dalai Lam the Tibetan view has been that the Tibetans themselves should be the ultimate determining authority in the choice of the new Daloi Lama and, in spite of Chinese claims to the. contrary, they appear to have succeeded in maintaining this position in practice. The success of the Tibetan Gcv, rnment in avoiding effective Chinese interference in these matters was shown in the fact that at the installation ceremonies the Chinese repre sentatives did nothing that was net also done by the British and other foreign representativest 3• Tibetan encroachment at Tawang and at othor places en the Indian side of the int--rrational frc-r.ti.r . Along the southern side of the international frontier (the'T^d^ahcn Line') between the eastern boundary of Bhutan and the Indo-Burmese border lies a broad belt of tribal territory in which the Assam Government have hitherto made little effort to exert their authority. In consequence the Tibetans have established con siderable influence in many parts of this tribal territory. At Tawang there is a well-known monastery and with the help of its influence the surrounding country is taxed and administered by Tibet. A British expedition which visited this ar^a in 1938 found that the Tibetan administration there was of an exceedingly oppressive nature. Further east, on the upper Bralimaputra cur reports state that Tibetan encroachment is proceeding apace and during the last three years the Tibetans have extended a measure of control to a point 7C miles south of the MiMahon Line. r- Proposals recently put forward by the Governor of Assam for the extension of administration ever Tawang were opposed by the Government of India on the grounds that it was undesirable to incur fresh commitments, financial or otherwise, on this frontier. The Secretary of State, while acquiescing for the tine being in this recommendation recorded that the present state of affairs could not be regarded with equanimity and asked that the whole question should be reconsidered in 194c. -It may -be regarded as certain that no redress in these matters will be effected merely by representations at Lhasa, which has little ocfltrol over the-activities of the local Tibetan officials, but tiiat direct action will have to be taken on the spot if cur ~ rl 4t..q are to be enforced. Friction arising with the Tibetan Gp-Vvinment ever the enforcement of our rights in any areas where ^ %ve Viink it essential to resist encroachment night however be smoctjied over later by concessions elsewhere. 6. The Frcspect . Although for the pr sent there appears tc be immediate prospect of either Japanese or Russian in fluence p.netrating Tibet it must bo recognised that the. effective control of the Tibetan Government does not extend to the outlying /districtsdistricts of the north ard aicrth cast, rtnd that they have very little infori-inticn about the state of affairs prevailing there. The territories stretching to the north of Lhasa in the direction cf Sinkian^ appear however to he desolate and largely uninhabited and perhaps uninhabitable. As regards Chinese influence it is satisfactory that this docs not seen to have increased at Lhasa as a result of It .7#u Chung-Hsin's visit. It had been expected that the installaticn of the new Dalai lam would £ive China a good opportunity of reasserting her influence and that the Becent, who by all accounts is a rxin endowed with no great statesnanship or character, would be quite ready to acquiesce; but whatever the explanation nay be this expectation has not b^en realised. 7 /hile .V/u was still at Lhasa the Chinese Foreign Minister in formed our Ambassador in China that the purpose of I.trWu's visit to Lhasa was to dispel the ii.vpression that China had designs on Tibet, and to persuade the latter that altheufh China would be at all tines ready to help Tibet if she so desired, she hoped to sec her developing alonr her own lines without interference. Whether the Chinese Foreign Minister's statement of policy represents any fundamental change of heart may lc'doubted, but it certainly seems that China has decided that the moment is not ripe for attempting the domination of Tibet. It is uncertain .vhether this decision was influenced by reports received from Mr.Wu at Lhasa that the situation there was less favourable than had been hoped. It has now been decided that Mr.Gould should inform the Tibetan Government of this statement of policy and add that 'in the event of any tendency on the part of the Chinese to £0 back on it His Majesty's Government and the Government of India will certainly rdve the Tibetan Government the support which has always been forthcoming since the time of the last Dalai Lama in maintaining their practical autonomy '. Motijcwhile, it is to*be hoped that British influence at Lhasa will continue, to grow through the efforts of cur representatives there, who have already achieved much in the way of gaining the confidence and goodwill of the Tibetans. Political Department. 30th May, 1940.• Ir Political Department. SECRET. THE PERSIAN GULF. iooKf r0 n^' re with Persian Gulf Questions.-For some time after t J i 0 ? ia i 0filce ' Asides administering Palestine, Transjordan, and tlie Iraq Mandate, had a general responsibility for political questions affecting Arabia including those arising on the side of the Persian Gulf. The Government of India remained responsible for internal questions in Koweit, Bahrein, the Trucia-1 bheikhdoms and Muscat, except that the Colonial Office dealt with oil questions in the Gulf generally. When Ibn Saud became King of the Hejaz, the conduct of lelations W1 th Inm passed to ^ the Foreign Office, and Avhen Iraq became an independent utate and the loreign Office thus became also responsible for Anglo- Iraqi relations, the residue of the Colonial Office main interest in Persian Gulf politics disappeared, and that Department asked to be relieved of its responsibility ^ cQnnection with the remaining Gulf States. The Cabinet then decided, on oth July 1933, that the India Office should receive departmental responsibility for Persian Gulf affairs, i.e. general political questions (as well as internal administrative ones) affecting Koweit, Bahrein, Qatar, the Trucial Sheikhdoms and Muscat* The Political Resident m the Persian Gulf accordingly now corresponds with the India Office and the Government of India regarding all such questions. Several othei Departments (e.g. the Foreign Office, the Air Ministry and the Admiralty) are also concerned in these matters, and interdepartmental co-ordination continues to be ensured through two Sub-Committees of the Committee of Imperial Defence (one of permanent officials and one of Ministers). This system had been established some time previously, and has been found to work well. The differences between departmental views are most often adjusted in the Official Committee, and the few that cannot be thus resolved are submitted to the Ministerial Committee for decision. 2. Tlrit'isfi helattons with Pevstan Gulf Stores. —Muscat is an independent State in s^eoial treaty relations with this country, but also in treaty relationship with France and the United States of America. Koweit, Bahrein and Qatar are independent States in exclusive treaty relation with His Majesty's Government and virtually under British protection, though they are not 'protectorates.' The Trucial Sheikhdoms (Abu Dhabi, Debai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al Qawain and Ras al Khaimah) are in a similar position, though we have not, generally speaking, entered into obligations to protect them by land. The general effect of our treaties with all these States and Statelets, and of the growth of practice, is that we control their external relations, and that they agree not to admit foreign representatives (except in the case of Muscat) or to cede territory to foreign Powers or to grant oil, and (except in the case of Muscat) certain other, concessions without our consent. 3. The Arab Shore Air Route. —In 1931 the Persian Government declined to renew the permit of Imperial Airways to fly over Persian territory, and it was. decided to transfer the service to the Arab shore of the Gulf. For this purpose it was necessary to provide a night stopping place on the Trucial Coast. After prolonged negotiations with many of the Trucial Sheikhs, conducted by the Political Resident, the late Sir H. Biscoe, an agreement was concluded with the Sheikh of Sharjah, under which a resthouse for Imperial Airways passengers was provided at that place. It had already been decided that the strategic route of the Royal Air Force should lie along the Arab shore. Facilities for the necessary refuelling depots and emergency landing grounds for this had to be obtained from the Arab Sheikhs concerned, and this has occasionally been a matter of some difficulty. 4. Oil. —A number of oil companies have in recent years taken an interest in the potentialities of the Arab shore of the Gulf. In 1925 the Eastern and General Syndicate, a firm of concession-hunters, obtained an oil concession from the Sheikh of Bahrein. The Company was not prevented by the terms of the concession from transferring it to foreign interests, and it was found necessary to allow them to * The Foreign Office, of course, retain departmental responsibility for relations with Persia, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, even in matters which affect the smaller States. 4087—4 35 9.35 u (f V.Z. 6647/352 transfer it to the Bahrein Petroleum Company, a subsidiary of the Standard Oil Company of California, though under conditions which adequately safeguard British political interests and on terms which are very advantageous to^the Sheikh Oil is actually being produced In Koweit, prior to 1934, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Gulf Oil Corporation of Pennsylvania were competitors for a concession. As it is not a necessary part of British policy in the Persian Gulf (save on the Irucial Coast and in Qatar, which are specially backward) to exclude loreign traders and concessionaires, provided that our political interests are safe- guarded, the bheikh of Koweit was not prevented from dealing with the Americans ihe latter presently joined forces with the Anglo-Persian Oil Companv, and formed the Koweit Oil Company, in which they are equally represented. An Agreement satistactonly safeguarding our interests was made between this company and His Majesty s Government in March 1934, and a concession was granted to the Company by the bheikh of Koweit in December 1934. Operations are still only at the exploratory stage. In Qatar, the Sheikh has recently granted a concession to the Anglo-I ersian Oil Company, representing the Iraq Petroleum Companv the other partners in which (the Royal Dutch Shell and French and American groups) wi 1 nave to be given tlie option of participating in the concession ; but the British element in the combination to which the concession passes is bound to be substantial and may, it is hoped, be predominant. In this case also, as in that of Koweit an agreement was made between the Company and His Majesty's Government to safeguard our interests during the working of the concession. But the admission o an oil company to work in Qatar also raided political questions of major importance—for example, that of the protection of the Sheikh's undefined landward iron tier. 1 he bheikh has been promised protection (to be afforded by the Royal Air rorce) against serious and unprovoked incursions from outside his frontier. Dimcult negotiations on this and other political questions in connection with the grant of the concession were successfully carried through by Colonel Fowle last May. ^ Ihe bheikh s son was recognised as his heir (though this does not involve a commitment to ensure his succession when the time comes), and the Sheikh agreed to cede to the British authorities jurisdiction over British subjects and protected persons other than subjects of Arab States in the Gulf. Intel est in the Irucial Coast has been aroused by oil developments elsewhere m the Gulf. Recently the Anglo-Persian Oil Company visited Abu Dhabi, and the bheikh of Ras al Khaimah has now made a request for a visit by a geologist of that company. We have been approached by a concession-hunter. Major F. Holmes, regarding the possibility of a concession being granted to a British companv in respect of Abu Dhabi and Debai. ^ 5. Relations with baudi Arabia. In the summer of 1934 the Saudi Government put out feeleis with a view to the establishment of closer relations with His Majesty's Government and mutual co-ordination of policy. On 12th—14th July 19o4 meetings took place between Sir A. Ryan and Ibn Sand, and later on con versations were held in London between Fuad Hamza, Saudi Deputy Minister for oieign Affairs, Sir A. Ryan, and the Foreign Office. It was thought that, while theie could be no question of an alliance with, or military commitment to, Ibn Sand, thoie would be advantage in a rapprochement or entente by which outstanding causes of dispute could be settled ana the friendship between the two Powers reaffirmed. Besides the future of the Hejaz Railway and the right of the British Legation at Jedda to manumit slaves, the questions outstanding between His Majesty's Government and Ibn baud included (a) permission for British aircraft to use the Hasa coast; ih) the treatment of goods transiting Bahrein for Ibn Saud's territory; (c) Ibn Sand s blockade of Koweit (see below); and (d) the eastern frontier of Ibn baud s dominions. It was arranged that bir A. Ryan should enter on formal negotiations at Jedda last winter. The Bahrein transit question, however, was iemitted to a conference at Bahrein of Saudi and Bahreini representatives, and an agreement was reached wdiich will be ratified by the Saudi Government and His Majesty s Government, subject to settlement of one minor point. It has now been decided that the outstanding questions can be handled separatelv and need not be combined in general negotiations. Sir A. Ryan's negotiations have been mainly taken up with the question of Ibn baud's eastern frontier. Under Anglo-Turkish Comentions of 1913 and 1914 the old Ottoman dominions were bounded by a line v SI io wn &gt; as the Blue Line) drawn south from a point opposite the island of Zakhuniya (i.e. approximately along meridian 50° 18' east) to the 20th parallel,western AraWn, 6 lllfq L !fV' bo ' l 1 udiu g the British sphere of influence in south- estern Arabia Ibn Sand has taken the strongest exception to His Majesty's Government s claun that as successor to the Ottoman Empire in this area he has to thp t f •f 0 ' 4 ' 61 ; . He claim s that Ins ancestors acquired rights of sovereignty to the east of it, m which they were independent of Turkey. It was decided that the whole question should be discussed in a generous spirit, and His Majesty's Government are prepared to recognise fbn Sand's sovereignty over a certain area (lying principally m the interior) to the east of the Blue Line, where it would not conflict with the rights of our proteges on the Trucial Coast and our owu strategic requirements. Discussions of the question, however, had not reached the stage of a dehuite settlement before Fuad Hamza and Sir A. Ryan recently left Jedda for London ; it is possible that they may be continued in London. Meanwhile all that has been actually offered to the Saudis is a line running south from the Dohat es balwa to the 20th parallel. G. A owett.-There are certain difficult questions pending in regard to Koweit. The position of this place at the head of the Persian Gulf gives it great importance o is Majesty s Government, both m connection with Imperial air commnnications civil and military, and also on account of the expiry of the Mandate in Iraq and the uncertainty ox our iuture relations with that country. 7. Saudi Blockade of Kov^eit.—Koweit is the natural entrepot for the trade of north-east Arabia, and m view of this she maintains a low customs tariff with ad valorem duties oi 4-41 per cent. Since the war, however, her neighbours in Saudi Arabia and Iraq have adopted high tariffs. Ibn Saud alleges a difficnltv in collecting his duties on goods entering through Koweit. The Sheikh maintains that they should be collected at the Saudi frontier, but Ibn Sand has insisted on other arrangements (e.g. the establishment of a Nejd customs post in Koweit), to which the Sheikh objects as infringements of his sovereignty. For more than 10 years past Ibn baud has imposed an almost complete embargo on trade between Koweit and JSejd and has endeavoured to prevent, usually with success, his tribesmen from buying their supplies m Koweit, their natural market. His real object in taking this drastic action is doubtless to increase the customs revenue of his Hasa ports and quite probably also the much more sinister intention of reducing Koweit to dependence upon himself. This blockade has naturally had a disastrous effect on the pio^peiit^ of Koweit tiade. In 1929, in return for the Sheikh's co-operation against the Akhwan rebels in their revolt against Ibn Saud, His Majesty's Government piomised the Sheikh that the^ wonld do their best to secure for him an honourable settlement of the question, xii 1951 the late Political Resident persuaded Ibn Sand to agree to a meeting of representatives of Koweit and Iraq, with the object of finding a solution. Hut the King subsequently withdrew his consent owing to a misunderstanding about certain Koweiti claims for compensation arising out of the Akhwan lebell.ion m 1929, which could have been used as a bargaining counter in the blockade negotiations, but which Ibn Saud regarded as having been abandoned in a letter written to him direct by the Sheikh, though the latter denied this. Recent!}, howevei, in the couise of his negotiations on Anglo-Saudi relations, Sir Andrew Ryan has succeeded in persuading Ibn Saud to agree again to the holding of a Saudi-Koweit Conference on the blockade, the question of the Sheikh's claims against Ibn Saud being^ tacitly ignored. The Saudi representatives have now (June 1 Joo) ailived at Koweit and discussions are being held on the question ot the Saudi blockade, but it is extremely doubtful whether practical settlement will result from these discussions. The Saudis, for their part, have in the past stated quite frankly that a settlement of the blockade question is not in their interests. 8. The Sheikh's Date Gardens in Iraq. —In return for the Sheikh's co-operation against the Turks during the war. His Majesty's Government in 1914 recognised Koweit as an independent Sheikhdom under British protection, and also promised that the Sheikh's _ date gardens in Iraq would remain in the possession of the Sheikh, and of his successors, and be immune from taxation. In the view of His Majesty's Government the obligation of implementing this promise has now devolved on the Iraqi Government, but unfortunately the former failed, during the currency of the Mandate, to obtain from the latter an undertaking to do so. ^The Iraqis have now in fact imposed taxation on the produce of these gardens ; in addition, on account of a purely technical flaw in the Sheikh's title, actions have .been brought against him in the Iraqi courts to dispossess him o£ large portions of■ ^ - ■ 'Tt ' them (called the Faddaghiyeh Estates), though it has hitherto been possible except in one minor case to prevent judgment being given against the Sheikh'for the tune being. Lengthy and complicated negotiations have taken place with the Iraoi government on this question, and more than one reference has been made to the Law Officers on its various aspects. His Majesty's Government at length conceded to the Iraqis that the question should be solved on the basis that His .UaiVslv s Government n-ould compensate the Sheikh for the taxation of his date gardens and pay the Iraqi Government a sum of £2,000 to buy off the claimants to the Sheikh's adi aghijeh estates, m return for which the Iraqi Government would validate beyond all question the Sheikh's title to the latter. In spite of this, however, and of the most categorical assurances received at various times from the Iraqis that they would settle'this matter in the Sheikh's favour, they have not vet done so and i ibcussious are still proceeding, i he continued inability of His Majesty's Govern om- 1 relations w-itii'tto l&amp;elkh. 6 Shelkh ^ ^ an ^ct on 9. kowcit-Iraq Smugglimj.—'Ybfi pearling trade on which Koweit used to depend is very depressed and she has no agriculture or industry of any importance On account of the Saudi blockade she has been unable for several vears to exwrt much to Nejd, but a large quantity of goods are at present imported into Koweit with a view to being smuggled over the Iraqi frontier. The actual smuedW if however, carried on pnnc.pally by Iraqis, and the Iraqi Government W h tlferto failed to impose an effective customs preventive service on the Koweit-Iraoi i ontiei.
