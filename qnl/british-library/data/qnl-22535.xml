Before departure from Simla, I was, however, given to understand, that I might get T.A. on transfer through^ an act of your generosity and under the rules and regulations governing the transfer of Govt, officials, because I was already holding an officiating clerical appointment at Army Headquarters,Simla, for the last 3^ years and farther in view of the fact that the M.A.G. issued my L.P.C. giving P me ^6 benefit of joining time on the clear understanding that my services were being transferred from one Govt, office to another Govt, office.

Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. ■f/T- ^ 4 £ ■ vII am most grateful to you, Sir, for your kindly granting me an interview on the 12th March. In compliance with your orders, I beg ?ueave to submit the following points for your sympathetic consideration regarding my candidature for an Upper Division post:- 1. That in August 1933, I accepted the post of Passport Clerk, primarily because I hoped ultimately to be given a permanent Upper Division post just as my predecessor (T.Ir. Ites Has f ud) was taken on the cadre and is now an Upper Division clerk. My post as Passport Clerk carried a monthly salary of Rs.180/- p.m. (including House lent Allowance of as.30/-) which was equal to the minimum pay and allowances of an Uprjer Division post. Also owing to the fact that several other Upper Division vacancies had been filled up by the Residency directly by candidates from India just about the time when I joined the Political Agency in 1933. 2. That I was hopeful of my eventual success, since after about li years 1 service under you, you had kindly recommended me in January 1935 for a post in the Up-oer Division. This hope had been further strengthened and implemented by the interview very kindly granted to me by the Secretary to the Honourable the Political Resident (Major C.C.L.Ryan) during his tour in February 1936. This was followed by the Secretary^ most re-assuring letter last year to the effect that on account of my past service I would be considered for direct recruitment to the Upper Division. 3. That during the past 3- L years that I have been Passport Clerk here, quite a number of Lower Division vacancies had been filled up by the Residency by candidates from India. As I had not been asked to accept or given a Lower Division post, I naturally assumed that I would be given an Upper Division one in due course. 4. Recently 2 extra Upper Division posts have been created for Bahrain, one of which has been filled up by a Lower Divisicn clerk. I beg permission to say that I am much disheartened to note that after about 7^- years 1 service in the various Government ofiices (including about 3-^ years' service under you), I have ultimately been offered a Temporary Lower Division vacancy . With the re-organization scheme of the Bahrain Agency, I expected to be given a permanent post in the Upper Division.•_ . That I am 31 years of age and to start at this stage o_ my life in a Lower Division post is a great hardship to me. 6. That in addition to possessing the educational Qualifications necessary for an Upper Division Clerkship i.e. a University degree, I had, when I came to the Persian Gulf in 1933 about 4 years experience in Government offices at Army Headquarters etcetera, whereas those who were recruited direct to the Upper Division aoout the same tine were graduates without any training. I should, therefore, be most grateful if you could kir r! ly recommend to the Honourable the Political Resident that the Rules for the recruitment of clerks be relaxed as a special case and that I be given an Uprer Division post.

If Mr. Hidayat Ullah ^as confirmed ae a clerk in the Lower Division on the 1st April 1937 he must, in accordance with Fundamental Rule 9(13),be held to have a lien on a permanent post from that date. The fact that he was holding the temporary post of 4th clerk, Bahrain from the 1st April 1937 to 20th July 1937 would not in itself entitle him to confirmation in the Lower Division on 1st April 1937. The alternatives therefore seem to be to accord him a lien on some permanent post from 1st April 1937 or to postpone his confirmation to 21st July 1937 on which date he was appointed as Camp Clerk, Bushire. / ^ I.C.S. , Political Agent, Bahrain. 9^ A. jW\\ !V &gt;TC. /64/203 f dated t: December, 1937.

I lay before you the following few lines for your sympathetic consideration (a) that I am suffering from hernia and in order to get rid of this disease I was hoping to undergo an operation by Dr. P/V. Harrison, who is fortunately a specialist in ourgeryj and was therefore waiting for the approach of winter. If this transfer, which is quite unexpected, materialises i would be most unfortunate to loose this valuable chance of the operation. (b) that this transfer will cause me considerable financial loss, i.e. to the extent of about Hs.40/- p.m. ^o much loss means a heavy drain on my meagre pay, specially at the present moment when the prices of all commodities have risen from 150 to 200%, and in some cases even more. (In this connection 1 would like to give you some verbal explanation;. (c) that according to the Kevised Leave rtules, I have earned up to now 98 days earned leave and, to make up 120 days (the maximimum period after which 1 will cease to earn leave any further) I will earn the remaining leave for 22 days during the next 8th months i.e. up to May 1943; when in the ordinary course 1 should go on leave. In this case an inter-transfer like this will cause unnecessary expenditure to the Government. Moreover, it will hardly be beneficial to Government work, because these transfers as are referred to in the telegram, might at least take two months from now or even more. By the time I reach and take over charge of my new post and become conversant with work, my leave will have become due and a new man will again have to be on training for some time. In the recent months this Agency is aware of the difficulties caused on account of changes and transfers. (d) that from 1932 up to now I have been continually serving on the Arab Coast i.e. at Muscat, Kuwait and Bahrain, staying at Muscat from 1932 to 1936, where I suffered not only t climatically (and was obliged to go on leave on medical grounds after spending four consecutive suraners) but also financially at the rate of os.5/- p.m. in basic pay throughout the whole period. During the last ten years (a period, the greater part of which has been very paying on account of the Karan Exchange) I have not had any chance of being posted in Bushire or elsewhere on the Persian Coast, in spite of my request in the beginning of 1940 which was refused, although at that time there i|as a chance of my transfer to Khorramshahr. In Bushire a Lower Division clerk always gets chance to officiate in the Upper Division thereby raising his pay by Hs.25/- P-tfw in addition to ivi.20/- p.m. which a Lower Division clerk on the Persian Coast draws more than the total emoluments of a clerk in Muscat or Bahrain. (fl) Under the circumstances explained above, I beg most submissively that you will kindly consider this application with full justification, firstly in view of the valuable chance l have here for the operation of hernia, secondly the question of my financial loss. Lastly my explanation given in paragraphs (c) &amp; (d) above are worthy of consideration. The solution is not only possible but rather advantageous to the Government. My relief who is not only senior to me in service but has considerable experience in accounts work while he served in the Consulate-General at Meshed, can go to Muscat straight on transfer.

In this connection I may add that though my present service as a Passport Clerk does not count for pension but I am otherwise entitled to leave and all other concessions like permanent establishment. 4» In view ot para.3 of memorandum No.8{ll)-E,^ J u *w- \ s r /@ 3 from the Jr.&amp; p. Department to the Hon'ble the P.R. in the P.G., is an agreement considered necessary please? HU. 22.10. • * An agreement has to be drawn up» Maqbul. 22.10. H.C. examine and report on each point please. hi. g. 2 s . 10 • What happened in case of Ras Masud and previous Passport Clerks ? ■S«G.22.10. P.A. Mr. Hi day atu 1 lah was offered the post of Passport clerk according to the terms of S.No.W® which he accepted wide S.No.-i©lr. The question of L.P.C. therefore does not arise. C.S.R. 1008 quoted by him applies in his case but does not make him entitled to the claim submitted by him. His claim can only be enertained if the L.P.C. which has been received from Simla vide ^.Wo.-ies is accepted. According to the terms which he has accepted he is entitled to one passage and his r.A. bill for this has been drawn and submitted for your signature separately. Mr.Has Masua's case is not quite identical with him as far as the question of T.A. and pay is concerned. Mr. Ras Kasud was engaged at Karachi when P.Aj was on recess and therefore his pay sorted from the day he was taken and T.A. (If tare) granted as for tour accompanying P.A. on return of recess. Maqbul. 18.11.33. Mr. Hidayat Ullah received a certain offer which he accepted - it included a second class passage by sea from Karachi rhers is therefore no question of any other t.a. rate. 2. I have instructed H.C. to look up the corrections in the regulations regarding the grant of t.a. on first Joining as a correction recently came out which has the effect of making y ^ea on first joining no longer admissible. The matter/ /■ will have to be referred to Bushir^. 3. I should like to see what led up to Memo•3(11) E of 22,6.1928 from the F. &amp; P. Dept. G.L. . . 2*12.33. Letter .Jo.26S dated the 29th January 1934 from the Secretary to the P.R. Bushire. * P.A. This settles the question of Mr.Hidayat Ullah's t.a. but we cannot draw this T.A. without previous sanction of P.R. Under these ru^es he is entitled for one and a half passage as on Journey on tour. 2. The second important point for consideration, is though he was offered the post of the passport clerk which he accepted independently and not through his former office, t it seems, that he has no claim for pay and joining time from the date he handed over his duties at Simla and arrived at Bahrain, as there was a break of service, but at the same time it seems hard that one should lose nearly four years of Govt.service particularly as this will affect his pension in later years. On this ground and on the strength of his us Last Pay Certificate forwarded to/by his former office, I think, we may make a reference to Bushire to clear this point. ~ Draft to Bushire submitted for approval please. r cn. it) d 7 /. r a i * u (v e Vv-VW U V~ ^ .9*4, 'A/- a. u [ t' ICL lSt) 7 Application dated the 14th November 1934 from Mr.Hidayat- Ullah, Passport Clerk.

(2) That my name had been registered for an U.D. post in June 1933; in JanuaTy 1935 P.A. very kindly recommended me fo^ a post in the U.D.; I was, however, not then informed in the terms of Bushire memorandum under consideration, although, . I understand, that many vacancies have recently been filled up. (3) That my present age is ove-r 30 years; it is too late for me to hope to be compensated for 6 years uninterrupted temporary service in any way except that the authorities be pleased to accede(3) to my humble prayers. (4) That my present post carries a montftly salary oi Ks.180/- (inclusive of allowance of Rs.30/- p.m.), which is e^ual to the minimum pay plus allowances of an U.D. post. It will now be a great hardship to me to sta-rt on fis.155/- which is the minimum pay and allowances of a L.D. post. Apart from that there are so many other disadvantages,' e.g. loss of seniority and periodical increments which so much count for future promotion. Jhat I have put in years as passport Clerk; during this period I have assisted in the general office routine of the Agency. As regards my work and conduct in other j ices, I submit my testimonials in original for P.A f s kind perusal. In the cin;^stances, I should be most grateful if my application could be treated separately from that of an outsider and wholly inexperienced recruit. V ^ /i- 'ftz- '*('• Hidayat-Ullah.I understand that Mr Hidayatullah had an interview v.ith Secy, this morning , as arranged. 8.

I presume Mr. Zafar Islam is also on the same boat. In case he is, I suggest that Mr. Ismail should be allowed to proceed to Bushire by the same,boat as otherwise there may not be another boat for some time and he may be unnecessarily delayed here. We may ascertain from Mr. Zafar Islam's home people, and if he is on this boat, we may submit the papers for P.A's approval as regards Mr. Ismail. D.F.A.submitted.

Only the Budget Estimates,when these charges were first included in the budget for sanction,would indicate the reasons and circumstances under which this allowance Sfnetloned fc y the Government of India.

I had another severe attack the other night. The Bahrain climate, I am told, is injurious to asthmatic sufferers and the approaching damp weather may still be worse. I shall, therefore,feel highly obliged if i s ^sked telegraphically to grant me 4 months* leave on average pay (for which I applied for in October and had a reminder sent from Khorramshahr in December last) so that I may have change and complete rest. I have since my last leave put in over 3% years 1 uninterrupted service against the normal 3 which entitles one for leave.
