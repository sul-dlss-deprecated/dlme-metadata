The résumé describes the police enquiry into the attempted poisoning, the evidence acquired from witnesses and interviews with those alleged to be involved in conspiracies, and the discovery of the packet containing the poison in a belt belonging to the servant who had placed the poison in Colonel Phayre's glass.The verso of the last folio of the letter contains a 'statement of arrears of the revenue of all the Mahals from Kartik Sudh 1st Sumvut 1930 to Asso Vud 30th Sumvut 1930' (
                           c.1873-4)
