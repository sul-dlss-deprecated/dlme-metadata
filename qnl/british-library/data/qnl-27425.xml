The most interesting statement is that the firmans of Path Ali Shah were in the keeping of Saif-bin-Nabhan. There firmans, if ever they could be found, might throw some light on the question of Basidu, that is, whether the Sultan in the days when he gave Basidu to the British Government (thirty-three years before the date of these letters) held the island of Qishm as a fief from the Shah of Persia, as he held Bander Abbas itself, or whether he held it in his own right. Will you be so good as to return the original letters to us in due course, as they will have to go back to Tehran for incorporation in their proper order in the collection of old archives to be bound eventually and transferred to the Public Record Office?mrnmammmmm (J) as for the firmans of Path Ali Shah, they are with Saif-ihn- Nabhan and are no longer with us. However, all the Persians know well what passed between us and the Shahs. In truth we did not disagree with them, but the disagreements came from them, for no cause or reason. And now, if the Minister wishes to act as an intermediary between us and them, we have no objection to anything which he may sign on our behalf, for we know that his regard for us is equal to his regard for his own life; and we appreciate his intentions, / expressed or implied; and if the matter is soon to be finished, let it be so urgently; if there are difficulties, we ask for an urgent reply so that we may know the situation. All we want (to know) is whatever happend to you in our affair, whether it be small or great; it is for you to inform us; farewell. Written on the 30th of Ramazan, 1271.

I ft®» sir. your obedient servant. The Secretary, public Record OfficeCOPY (L 5439A86/402) Memorandum upon Certrin of the Legation and Consulate Archives known as the ‘’Oriental Secretary’s Papere” and the 'Deposited Documents' in the Consulate. 1933. From the time when the first British Missions came to Persia in the opening years of the nineteenth century, and throughout the greater part of that century, the Ministers and Secretaries of the day seem to have kept a certain number of papers separate from the ordinary archives of the Legation, either because of their special secrecy or importance or because they were at the time the private archives of some particular person and kept by him among his own papers. The rt suit was that a large number of papers were gradually accumulated, ch were never sent home to the Record Office periodically with the ordinary Legation archives. 2. At some date which cannot now be exactly determined, but was probably about the year 1R92, the whole of these papers, or at any rate a large mass of paners, seem to have been handed over to the Vice-Consul for safe keening; and it was probably then that a series of numbers called 'Safe numbers', that is, 'No. - in the safe' was given to these papers. This series, with later additions, seems to have run from 1 to about 340. 3, In the year 1904 it seems to have been decided that a great many of these papers ought more properly to have been in the keeping of the Legation and a great many of them were transferred by the Vice-Consul to Mr. Churchill, the Oriental Secretary, on October 29th in that year. The papers so transferredtransferred were in two divisions, one a collection of 'Treaty’’ papers, numbered 1-22 and a general collection numbered 1 - 66 . The general collection received additions up to the year 192® the last number being 100 . x 4. In the following year, 1905, the papers retained in the Vice-Oonsulate were entered in a register of deposited documents, being numbered 1 - BO, with seven supplementary lists, Da 1 - B, Db 1 - 9, Dc 1 - 7, T)d 1 - 15, De 1 - 5, Df 1 - 19, and Dg 1 - 4. From 1906 onwards the deposited documents were keot in the same register, being numbered by years. The pre-1906 list included a number of deposited documents properly so called, as well as naners formerly belonging to the Legation and transferred in about 1^92. A few miscellaneous unlisted documents were also kept with the old deposited documents. 5. No list is now ovsilable of the former 'In the safe' numbers, but a proportion can be traced from the documents themselves, which sometimes have this number included in the docket. It is probable that the greater part of the original series war transferred either to the 'Oriental Secretary’s Papers' or to the 'Deposited Documents'. A tftble showing such of the 'In the safe' numbers as can be traced is attached. 6 . It is somewhat difficiilt to understand on what principle the division of 1904 was made. Original documents of some historic interest, such as signed conies of treaties or comrunic’tions bearing the seals or ilgnatures of various Bhahs and Ministers, 'Secret' papers, conies of treaties, laws, etcetera, receipts, leases, and miscellaneous correspondence of all kinds, were all to be found in both the 'Oriental Secretary's Papers' and the 'Deposited Documents'. Moreover the descriptions given of the documents, whether in the lists or on the envelopes in which they were folded and put away, were not always very clear or complete; while some of the paoers themselves had in the x It is possible that the actual listing was not done till some years later.(&gt; ■■■■Hi the course of tine becowe nixed. Neither before or after 1904 do ihe papers seem to have been arranged on any chronological or other system. 7. As a consequence a re-arrangement of the two series was made in 1933, on the following lines: (1) All signed conies of trestles and similar original documents have been collected together and sent to the Foreign Office, to the number of 41 (Tehran deso' tch No. 181 of Aoril 22nd 1933) (2) All conies of treaties, etcetera, and generally all naners of interest of which the texts must obviously be available without difficulty elsewhere, have been placed in the Confidential Reference Library. (3) All papers relating to the properties at Tehran and Qulhek have been placed in a separate collection, with six sub-divisions: (A) General 1 - 16. (B) Building of Tehran Legation 1-5. (C) Tehran land 1-4. (D) Tehran water 1 - 17, (E) Gulhek land 1 - 28. (F) Gulhek wrter 1-34. This collection needs further study, translations of most of the documents being lacking. (4) All papers which appear to be 'deposited documents’ properly so called, or relate to accounts, claims, etcetera, and to consular matters generally, have been placed on a revised list of pre-1906 'Deposited Documents' to the number of 60, A great many of the documents have no dates, but, so far as possible the list has been made in chronological order. (5) One or two have been destroyed. A few others are missing: none of these appear of great importance and some of themthem may yet come to light as the result of further examination of the Special Archives (see below), ( 6 ) All other papers have been placed in a series called \ 'Special Archives’* to the number of 78, This series comorisea many original communications from Shahs and Persian Mini steps and a great deal of correspondence in Persian generally, but it is probable that translations of most of the papers appeared in the ordinary Legation archives of the time. This collection needs further study. Like No. 4 it is as far as possible in chronological order. A few papers of recent date from other sources than the **Oriental Secretary’s Papers’* have also been added. 8 . It should be noted that a sort of unofficial appendix to the 'Special Archives’* exists in the form of a box full of unsorted corresnondence in Persian, being papers accumulated by the late head of the Oriental chancery, Abbas onli Khan Nawab, during his service in the Legation and left by him on his retirement in 1988.

S.W.l 2nd June, 1933 I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, a copy of a despatch No» 181 of the 22nd April from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran forwarding certain original documents which in the opinion of Mr. Hoare should more properly be preserved in the archives of this Office or your department or in the Public Record Office than in the archives of His Majesty’s Legation. The documents in question are also enclosed and I am to request their return after perusal. 2. Subject to the views of Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare it is proposed to dispose of the documents in the following manner:~ As regards items Nos. 1, 7, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17 and 24 on Mr. Hoare’s list, although they are described as original texts, they are, in fact, not the original treaties, since the latter are already in the collection of original treaties preserved at the Public Record Office. It is proposed therefore that they should be sent to that Office for incorporation in the early archives of the Tehran Legation, together with items Nos. 2 to 5, 6 , 9, 12, 14, 18 to 23, 25 to 27, 29 and 30 which cannot properly be regarded as treaties. Item No. 8 (Persian text) will be included with the English text in the collection of original treaties kept at the Public Record Office. I terns The Under-Secretary of State India Office.Items Nos. 28 and 53 are important documents and if the originals are not in the archives of your Department, it is proposed to incorporate them in the Foreign Office collection of original treaties. As the Legation archives subsequent to 1900 are still retained at Tehran, it is suggested, subject to Sir Samuel Hoare*s concurrence, that items Nos. 34, 36, 37 and 38, be returned for inclusion in their proper place in the archives. Items Nos. 31, 32, 35, 39, 40 and 41 will also be returned to Mr. Hoare for similar treatment. I am.Copy (L 2591/186/402) No. 181&gt; British Legation, Tehran. 22nd April, 1933. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that there are in this Legation a number of original documents which should more properly, it seems to me, be preserved in the Foreign or Indian Offices or in the Public Records Office. I enclose a list of these documents, which are for the most part texts or treaties or of engagements undertaken by the Persian Government. Few, if any, relate to agreements or undertakings now in force, and are from that point of view unimportant, but most are of historical interest. 2. The list contains references to standard works such as Aitchison’s Treaties wherever it has been possible to trace a reference. 3 . The documents themselves are enclosed in a separate packet. 4 . I am sending copies of this despatch, with a copy of the list referred to in paragraph one, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 77). I have, etc., (Sgd.) R.H. Hoare.
