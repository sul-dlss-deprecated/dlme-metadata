His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad (with his brothers and other*of the al Khalifah) was seated outside the front of the ^asr, whe-e arrangements had been made for the parade and display. fhe Advise-^ was running the arrangements. Phe P.A. sat with the Shaikh, Mrs Loch on the Political Agent’s right and then Shaikh Abdullah (later Shaikh Muhammad arrived and Shaikh Abdullah moved down). On the Shaikh’s left was an Arab and then the Assistant Political Agent and Mrs Cole. Shaikh Khalifah was next on Mrs Cole’s left. phe Police fonaed up and presented arms and then they and Section marched past in various formationi 2 . Phe Shaikh does not take much heed of salutes (or of his anthem), but I got him to stand up by doing so myself when the flag passed.I explained that it was customary to salute a regimental flag, 3. After the Police had marched off, Boy Scouts did various evolutions, including a Maypole and signalling by semaphore a suitable (and evidently well learnt l) message from a distant post to one near the Shaikh. 4. Coffee was served twice. 5. After the Boy Bcouts had moved off, the Political Agent said goodbye to the Shaikh. The whole business took about 1^-2 hours. 6. The next morning the Shaikh informed the Political Agent that the messengers of Bin Sa’ud (Hal wan and Abdul Karim al faris) had seemed much impressed by the Police and said that though they were training men in Riyadh and elsewhere they had none taught as well as these. 7. It would be well next time to warn the driver of the car not to park the car just where the show will take place. I had to have him moved this year and it does not look well. 8. Mrs Belg^ave and Lady Barnett-Lennard watched from their car. James (Hamad on such- 3 - &lt;r\ such occasions in front of the Shaikh) was the^e in a new red Arab robe and dagger. The only other Europeans who came were ,, w, v/ w w » mr k * ^** Nw — \» On the second day, January 10th, the Political Agent accompanied by the Assistant Political Agent, (Captain Cole) both in the Daimler attended the Baladiyah meeting, at 09.20. 7/hen they arrived Shaikhs Muhammad and Abdullah, the Adviser and the A1 Khalifah and other guests were there. The Shaikh arrived about 5 minutes later. A place had been -reserved on the right of the Shaikh for the Senior Naval Officer (Captain Butler) and had unfortunately not been removed when a message came saying that owing to work he could not come. His place remained vacant and the Shaikh had to ask ii he was coming (I thought he was, as the^e was a chairr) before starting the proceedings. Next yea-r we should see that the invitation is answered early enough to avoid such a difficulty* P.f.O.Coffee was served and then four speeches read by the Secreta-ries of the two Baladiyahs Yusuf), by Abdu^ ^ahman al Muawdah (who was involved in selling cultured pearls last year, I think, a relative of Shaikh Muhammad bin f Isa) speaker of the Baha^inah* Between each speech the Police Band played a short tune. Tib was brought immediately afte^ the speeches, as player time had come. The Political Agent and Assistant political Agent said goodbye to the Shaikh and left. 2. The following was the seating on the dais. The Officiating Indian Assistant, Dr. Siddiq. sat on the right hand seat of the front row on the South side of the aisle up to the dais. 3. The speeches we^e much as usual, but (an advance on last year) the Shaikh was (Muhammad Saleh al Shatur and Muhammad Saleh and by Mulla Hasan ibn al Shaikh, the usual Shaikh Muhammad Shaikh P.A. Shaikh Abdullah A.P.A. Adviser Shaikh Khalifah Table : Shaikh Salman bin Hamad. spoken/-- 5 - ,k 6 ) ^ spoken of in one as King 'Hamad al Awal' l That by the cultured pearl dealer was rather dubious and rather of the pan-A^b variety - it did not get as much applause as the rest. It is only the Baharinah now who ’puff’ the British connection. * A message had been sent in the morning to say that she would like to do so. j On the afternoon of the 10th Janua-ry at 15.15 hours the Political Agent and Mrs Loch and the Assistant Political Agent (Captain Cole) went to see the dancers at the ^asr. Mrs Loch went * up on the roof to see the Shaikhah, who asked whether M^s Cole was coming, but was given a suitable excuse. Mrs Loch took with her a photograph of herself given to the Shaikh at the ! Id, which had been framed at the Shaikhah T s request. Mrs Belg^ave was up the^e too. The Political Agent and Assistant Political Agent watched on the ground with the Shaikh. Assistant Political Agent left after about half an hour with a suitable excuse. Adviser was present and Lady Barret t-Lennard watched from the car.Coffee was served at intervals. 2. Haji Abdul Aziz Khunji came to sit next to the Political Agent afte-^ Adviser had left. He had with him a merchant just arrived from Lingah. They complained bitterly oi the killing of trade on that side of the Gulf. 3. The boorish Shaikh Khalil ah is beginning to push his way forward again. 4. The dances we^e well done, but there we^e not such crowds as the yea*** oeiore. The Najdis and the women we^e there. A new dance song was tried called 'Badawi'. At about 16.45 the Political Agent left, Mrs Loch having come down to the car and sent a message. ^ 10/1 On the morning of the 11th January, the Political Agent and Mrs Loch and the Assistant Political Agent visited the Police Pavade ground at 10.00 hou--s to see that all was going on well, phe Advise-!- and Mrs Belgrave were the-e. 2.

With regard to the celebration of TT , TT, s Anniversary, ^-e Sheikh thanked you for your message and fjlly agreed that a garden party at the Agency may put him into inconvenience owing to Amir d a ud's visit. As regards the dinner party at the Agency he also thanked you for your message and said that at this moment he could not give a definite answer, but on Thursday when you call on Amir it Saud he will speak to you about/and decided as to whether a dinner party should be given at the Agency or not. He suggested that you should call on the Amir on 'Thursday the 16th H e cember at 4-30 Arabics time (3-40 A.M). 2 o A' / /22JT, I want the letter below to His Highness the Shaikh to be taken by the Head Munshi and delivered personally to His Highness. Head Munshi should at the same time deliver the following verbal message to His Highness from me. I have not arranged any formal en tertainment at the Agency during the coming celebra tions of His Highness* Anniversary since these cele brations will coincide with the visit of the Amir Saud and I thought that it might be inconvenient to His High er &lt;f cvi OAS* Uy 01 ^ ness to receive an invitation to^the Agency during that visit. I shall, T trust, have the honour fcjk entertain His Highness later when he is not occupied with important affairs. 2. In regard to the Amir Saud*s visit I feel some hesitation in inviting the Amir Saud and His Highness to a formal dinner party at the Agency since I believe His Highness wishes the visit to be as private and in formal as possible. Will His Highness, therefore, be good enough to indicate what he himself would prefer in this matter and will he accept my assurance that I shall feel in no way offended if His Highness indicates that he prefers not to have a formal dinner at the Agency/ On the other hand if he would like to bring the Amir Saud to dinner here I shall be most honoured and could arrange it on Sunday or Monday night. The Head Munshi should be very careful to assure His Highness that I am anxious to fall in with his v/ishes over this matter and shall be entirely satisfied with whatever decision His Highness may reach. 13th December 1937.T—S'mCiisNT No.1878-6/58.

I have the honour to read this speech on behalf of my brother His Highness Shaikh Hamad on the occasion of this seventh anniversary of his accession. Gentlemen, I accept with pleasure the expression of congratulations and good wishes contained in the speeches delivered today and I thank God that I am present here again today, talking to you and receiving your congratulations and blessings which spring from your loyalty and affection, I thank the members of my family, the ^adis ana the Presidents of the Municipal Councils and the people and notables for their congratulations and good wishes and I appreciate their loyal sentiments. Gentlemen, /it this time last year, ^hen you were cele brating the anniversary of my accession, we men tioned the disturbed state of Europe and the possi bility of war. Unfortunately war has broken out. One man only set light to the world and caused this outbreak - that man is Hitler, Hitler and his Nazi government, because of their greed, have caused this war. They wished to enslave the weak nations of Europe which could not defend themselves, but when Hitler invaded Poland England and Prance opposed him, they had a treaty with Poland, c This is not a war between two nations. This is a war between Democracy and Dictatorship, a war between tyranny and the right of private opinion and g freedom. Hitler is fighting to destroy the freedom both of nations and of indi viduals and to obtain universal supremacy. Gentlemen, The ^irabs are a democratic people both by religion and by nature, the ~*rabs are ranged on the side of democracy against Hitler and his lime. Here, in Hahrain, we and our ancestors have, for nearly a century and a half relied upon the strong support of our friendship with Great Britain, Great Britain has brought peace and security to the Gulf and it has protected the xmrab Rulers of the Gulf without taking from them their independence fthen this war began we did what we conceived to be our duty, we informed the British Government that our sympathy was with Britain ana her allies and that we were against Hitlerism and we offered some assistance to the British Government as an expression of our feelings and a contribution towards defending civilisation. Today in thel ” r ~1 -a- the presence of our peoole, we take the opportunity to declare that Britain’s war is our war ana until victory comes all that we have is at the disposal of the British Government. Gentlemen, Here in Bahrain we are far away from the battlefields of duro^e and so far tnis war has not had any important effect on our lives* Thex*e is no shortage of food or of necessary imports and rices have not increased to any great extent* ur government has taken necessary steps to ensure that our people are able to buy food at reasonable prices ana at the same time to ensure that sellers obtain reasonable profits without profiteering unduly at the expense of the whole community* We thank the merchants and shopkeepers for their assistance in carrying out the necessary measures* Gentlemen, In Bahrain, as in all countries of the world, it is now essential that the Government should strengthen its military defences* Our most important source of revenue is from our oil field and we are responsible for defending it from any enemy. We have increased the number of our trained men and we shall increase the present force still more and we have also obtained supplies of modern weapons and ammunition* Our expenditure on defence has increased greatly but it is money well spent and most of it is spent on men from Bahrain. Gentlemen, Trade and pearl industry last year, although affected by the disturbea state of Europe and then by the war. was not altogether unsatisfactory although it was less than the year before* In spite of this however our government was able to increase the Reserve Fund and at the same time to contribute to ards the cost of the war and to carry out many improvements in Bahrain such as the exten sion of the Manamah pier, the extension of the Muharrag sea road, the completion of the women’s hospital and progress in the other hospital buildings, work on the Manajaah - Muharrag bridge is now pro ceeding and we hope that by the end of the summer, if there is no delay in obtaining the necessary material, that the bridge will be finished* Gentlemen, In addition to public works our government has been active in other directions* With the assistance of the British Council we have obtained the services of an English Director of Education and changes and improvements are being made in our schools. There are now about 1400 boys ana 400 girls receiving free education in our government schools. Regarding reforms in the administration of justice, we are trying our utmost to obtain a learned judge to visit Bahrain and give advice on -fjon the composition of a civil and criminal code but we have not yet found a suitably qualified person. This year we hiive proceeded with important measures for improving the public health inclu ding the campaign against Malaria which is the most dangerous illness in Bahrain. The work which has been done appears already to have had some result in Manaman. The reduction of Malaria is a matter of importance to everybody who lives in Bahrain and we hope that all landowners will cooperate with our Government in the work which is being done. Next year we do not propose to embark on any new schemes which require much expenditure. Although the revenue at present is satisfactory we do not know what the future holds in store* The war may last a long time, it may spread to other countries and it may affect our trade and our revenue from oil. Tnis is a time for economy both in public and in private expenditure. Gentlemen, During this year His Majesty king ^bdul al ifaisal aJ.-Gaoud honoured us. His visit was significant of the friendship existing between us and the king of oaoudi-iajabia. His visit will be remembered with pleasure and with admiration. Shortly before the war our brother Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa paid a visit to America. This is the first time that one of our family, or anyone from Bahrain has travelled to the Uniled states. Shaikh Mohomed was received by the President of the United States and was warmly welcomed by the people of New York where he was the guest of the Standard Gil Company of California. Tne meeting between our brother Shaikh Mohomed and the President was a most fortunate occasion. finally, Gentlemen, we thank you again for your congratulations and we hope that tne new year will bring peace to the world and prosperity and happiness to the people of Bahrain.Persons to be invited for H*H s Accession •‘-'ay in 1S41 Shaikhs * 1.

The Shaikh,Shaixh Abdullah,Shaikh Salman and Snaixh Rashid were asked by letter (Shaikh Muhammad was away in Egypt). The merchants on whom the Political Agent calls were asked by an Arabic lorm oi an ordinary invitation and European and American the guests is on the Hie. 2. Tne Snaikh brought a number of sons but they remained outside till we went to see the dancers. 3. Ordinary tea was given with sandwiches,cake etcetera but it would prooabiy be better next year to give sweet biscuits to which most of the Arab guests are accustomed. A sofa was kept for the Snaikh but otherwise the guests divided themselves up anyhow. Shortly after tea all the guests went into the south verandah to see the dancers in the courtyard by th ~ ~ e two bags ot rice. Tne present was actually handed over to the head ol the dancers by the Indian Assistant. On another occasion it would probably be better to have the chairs for those watching the dancers on the root oi tne guard room. The balcony at the back of the house is rather and it is not easy to see the dancing. The Shaikh 1 s sons and the merchants rather crowded round him so that the guests were rather divided up into Arab and European instead ox mixing. It is,however,difucult to avoid this as so lew know Arabic. 4. Shortly beiore sunset coiiee was served and immediately alter it tib. The Shaikh and the Arab guests then left lor their evening meal and the European and American guests stayed lor drinks and smokes (cigarettes had been given to tne guests while watcmng the dancing,except to the Shaikh who does not smoke), b. The Snaikh was apparently pleased at having an At Horae ol guests were asked by ordinary A list ol dancers were brought by the Shaikh and were given /thisOn tne evening oi tiie 31 st January 1934 tne Political Agent accompa ' Senior Naval Onicer,Persian dull car at about 19.00 nours to see tne lights and decorations. Tne driver and IerrashjAiUhaimad Sb.andad,went on tne loot-ooaras. The time was a little early ana there were very lew people about as they were eating tne evening meal. No one got out oi tne car but stops were made at a numoer oi coilee houses where conee and rose water were given. There was some question ox going with tne Shaikh’s party,but on tne wnole it seemed better not to be involved witn the crowd which tills tne streets later on. Division,Mrs. Srs.Loch went round the bazaar in the 3-3-1934.On tne morning oi me 1st February tne Senior Naval Omcer ana tne Political Agent went to a reception given oy tne Balaaiyi m nonour oi the ShaiKn. Two speecnes were maae oy tne Secretaries oi tne Baladiyans ana tnen some verses oy two oi tne men belonging to tne scnools,one oi wnom naa been to Beirut tor training, it was noticeable that tne use of the word ♦MetltV instead oi f Kakim T was very mucn stressed. After coiiee ana tib had been given,tne Shai&amp;n,Senior Naval Omcer and tne Political Agent went on to tne oaicony to see the dancers below, alter which the Senior Naval Ofiicer excused nimselt on grounds of worX and the Senior Naval Oiticer,the Political Agent and Shaikh left.

Tne Political Agent presented prizes of Rs.lS/- and Rs.10/- to the best and second best competitor. 2. Tea and biscuits were served on the ground by arrangements oi the Police. The Shaikh and Shaikhs Abdullah and' RaanToiTvere present. The Shaikh asked Mrs.Loch to give away the prizes 3. Tne question whether it is possible to present a Shield, to be competed tor by tne various sections of the police^should be taken up. An extract about this should oe put on a separate file and submitted to me.
