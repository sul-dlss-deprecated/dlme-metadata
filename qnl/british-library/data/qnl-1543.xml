B. 360. MIDDLE EAST. 32 Turco-Bolshevik Activities : Note by Political Intelligence Officer attached to India Office. I.— The Turkish Unionists (O.U.P.). 1. Before we can arrive at any just appreciation of the political situation in Anatolia it will be necessary first to study the aims of three important political groups which have now formed a sort of triple alliance, namely, the C.U.P., the Bolsheviks, and the Turkish Nationalists. Until we have arrived at a clear appreciation of the aims of these different groups we can form no possible estimate as to the future trend of events. 2. No clearer definition of the O.U.P. policy has come into our possession than that furnished in a report submitted to the Finnish Government by Wetterhoff of a conversation with Talaat Pasha. The importance of this report lies in the confirmation we have received from other sources, confirming to a remarkable degree the policy therein enunciated. The following are relevant extracts :— (a) “ The time for active measures had not yet arrived, but now was the time to prepare, because everything should be ready when the time for action arrives. ’ “ That time would have arrived when the internal unity of the Entente should have finally broken down.” The period of waiting is being organised by the Turks to disorganise and weaken England’s power in Asia. (h) Object.—The forces of Mustafa Keinal form the positive part of the “ programme which is to build up again the ancient Turkish power. “ But no less important is the policy which seeks in other Moslem “ countries to use their powerful national personality in the fight against “ England. Representatives of the Turks are in Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, “ Persia, even in South-East Asia, organising and inciting the national “ conflict. “ Another part of Turkish preparations was the search for contact “ with other nations which have had enough of England’s protection.” (c) Bolshevik, —“He hinted that England’s greatest danger would come from “ Bolshevik Russia, where the hostility to England is boundless. The “ Bolsheviks, in order to weaken England’s power in Asia, have put into “ operation a powerful Bolshevik propaganda in the colonies and vassal “ countries, especially India. “ The ideas which the Bolsheviks are stimulating there differ in part “ from the Socialist programme which they use in the industrial countries “ of Europe. In Asia they cultivate the idea of nationality and freedom “ of religion. “ In this way Russia is at this moment the best and most valuable ally “ of all Mohammedans.” This may be summed up very briefly as follows:—Talaat and his party aim at reconstituting the Turkish Empire, and consider England to be the real stumbling block in their way. Being unable to oppose a united Entente, they seek to limit concerted action and opposition to their aims by producing misunderstandings among the Entente and to weaken England’s position by using the Nationalist movements to embarrass her, and to use temporarily Russia’s hostility to the British to further their schemes. 3. There is one other point of extreme importance hinted at in the above and made clear from our information from other sources. This group (the C.l .1\) seeks to reconstitute Turkey by adding to her territories Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkestan, thus obtaining contact with central Asia. It seeks to gain control of the Bolshevik organisations in these regions and use them for its own purpose. It is this latter policy which is fully realised by the Soviet Government and accounts for the 3021 50 1.21 , Aapparent confusion in Anatolian politics and the rivalry shown in respect of Armenia. I. The main point to be considered for the moment is the understanding between the C.U.P. and Russia. Enver and Talaat fully realised that there was not the slightest hope of achieving their purpose without the support of Russia. It will be observed in {b) above how they also determined to’utilise ‘‘other nations which have had enough of England’s protection ” and to seek in other Moslem countries to use their “powerful national personality” in the fight against England. o. They therefore made serious endeavours to ally themselves with, among others, the Arab movement, the Egyptian Nationalist movement, and the Indian National movement (through Mohtl. Ali), and to bring about an understanding between these different parties and Russia. In order to accomplish this, they sought to reconcile Bolshevik aims with these different Nationalist aims and produce a modus ■mvendi between the two. 'This task was by no means easy. The various Nationalist parties were extremely nervous of the Bolshevik, especially as regards the /eligious aspect. Talaat, however, managed this part of his task extremely adroitly. How he did it may be illustrated by the resolutions arrived at during certain meetings in Switzerland at which the different Nationalist groups were represented. Extract from A.—Resolution at meeting in St. Moritz on 7th January : — “ Formation of the administration of the country (Anatolia) with Socialist principles so long as they do not clash with the principles of Islam.” Extracts from B.—Resolutions at meeting in St. Moritz in May :— 1. The Alliance with the Bolsheviks must be only for a limited period. '1. To render all assistance possible to free India, Egypt, and Persia from England. On the strength of these resolutions, which appeared to leave them liberty of action, the different parties sanctioned the rapprochement with Russia. Enver then returned to Moscow, and on Ibth May Ibid), at a secret conference held in the Moscow Foreign Office, attended by representatives from Persia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Turkestan, India, and Afghanistan, signed an agreement with the Soviet Government for mutual support. 6. It has been stated above that the Unionists wish to get control of the Bolshevik organisations. It will be remembered that the unfortunate “ Mussavat ” government of Baku was successfully overturned by the Communists mainly as a result of the assistance given by the numerous Turkish Unionists. A Soviet Government having been instituted in Azerbaijan, the Unionists have succeeded in gaining considerable control. The infiltration of Unionists in the Turkish Communist Party in Baku still continues ; the}’ thus seek to establish complete control in course of time, and to gain control of Georgia and Azerbaijan in order to connect up with their schemes in Central Asia. They are in this respect working directly against the Bolshevists, and they have one asset of great value on their side, viz., the growing discontent of Moham medans in this part of the world against the Bolshevik. The Unionist plan therefore is to continue the alliance with Russia so long as it enables them to advance their own plans, which are being energetically pursued. 7 8 7. There is only one disadvantage for them, namely, that the Bolshevik is fully alive to the danger. Enver is being carefully watched, whilst the Soviet Government will probably oppose by every means any attempts to overrun Georgia or Armenia. We may conclude this brief review of Unionist plans by saying that the same process is going on in Anatolia as formerly in Azerbaijan ; for the moment the Unionists are assisting to overthrow Mustafa Kemal and the present regime, and are in consequence allied to the pro-Bolshevik party. They are prepared to go much further in the Red road than the Nationalists for the achievement of their private and political purposes. « II.—The Bolshevik Attitude. 8. The well-advertised object of Soviet Russia to attack British, interests in the East is too-'well known to bear repetit ion, and we are here only concerned with that part of their programme that affects Anatolia, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan and4 After Enver Pasha had submitted his report to Moscow on the negotiations with the different Nationalist parties in Switzerland, the Soviet Government definitely made up its mind actively to support the Eastern movement, but only in so far as it coincided or assisted their own aims. The Soviet Government will support no movement that will not acknowledge the Soviet system. 11. No clearer proof of the real aims of the Soviet Government as illustrated above had been given than the following extract of a telegram dated 2nd March 1920 from Tchitcherin to Eliava, Tashkent, for communication to the commissarv of the Caucasus district:— “ (3) We have no intention of encouraging Turkish Imperialism. “ (4) It is impossible to permit Turkish military experts such as the violent imperialist Nuri Pasha to enter Caucasian Mussulman districts. “ (o) Pan-Ielamism, as a counter-revolutionary force, is dangerous to us, in spite of its evident desire to conform itself to Communism, ami sooner or later we will have to light against it.' The above instructions explain the treaty between the Anatolian Nationalists and the Soviet Government; it seeks to safeguard itself by converting Islamism to Communism. Therefore every effort is being made to convert the Nationalist Government of Anatolia into a Soviet Government. This process is not confined to- Anatolia, but is followed with all countries with which Russia has dealings. As an example of this policy to convert Islam, it might also be of interest to cpiote extracts from a telegram sent by Safaroff to Moscow some time in March 1920 :— c: Thb example given to the East, and one which all should copy, will be the Turks’ example of free Communist institutes. It is essential, therefore, that the following reforms be introduced into Turkestan :— “ (1) Equal rights for all parties. “ (G) Education and enlightenment in Proletarian lines. “ (7) Elimination of spiritual nationality. “ (9) The formation of special departments for directing propaganda and agitation work. This last is, for all independent political centres, one of the most important matters.” Compare the- points with those in the treaty between Moscow and Angora. 12. We may sum up Bolshevik policy, therefore, briefly as follows:—Great Britain, forming, in their opinion, the main barrier to the emancipation of the world and to the institution of a universal Soviet regime, must be destroyed ; this mav be done by detaching India from the Empire. As India cannot be taken by a direct assault, it is necessary, as a preliminary step, to create Soviets right up to the Indian borders, and by intensive propaganda in India itself, to create an internal situation that will weaken the Imperial might, which may be still further reduced by anti-militarist propaganda in Europe, and in England in particular. It is part of their policy to use Islam in so far as it may be utilised in an anti-British sense, but to disorganise it by creating national States, and still further by converting Islamism into Sovietism.* 13. Ihere are, however, still more sinister designs, emanating from Trotsky, becoming still more apparent in Bolshevik foreign politics. It must be borne in mind that the whole Soviet system depends on the army. There are increasing indications that the Germans or certain sections in Germany have a most powerful influence in Russia. 1 here appears to be good reason for suspecting that Trotsky, assisted by the German element, has most ambitious schemes of conquest. How far these are approved by Lenin it is at present difficult to say, but they undoubtedly do exist. Whether these plans are capable of any sort of success is again a question of most careful enquiry, and a iurther report will shortly be submitted. In the meantime it is sufficient to call attention to the above, and emphasise the fact that the vast army Russia now has at her disposal constitutes for the State itself no inconsiderable danger A copj' of a valuable document is printed in the appendix to this memorandum, giving instruc tions as to what is to be done in Peorgia; it provides a striking example of Bolshevik methods not only in Georgia, but in Anatolia : most of the instructions advocate methods already in force in the latter country.i) Its farther employment, therefore, may be obligatory for the Soviet Government. Our intelligence points not to a reduction, but a constant increase in strength, which is somewhat significant when we consider that Russia lids, as far as can be seen, nobody to fight—since Wrangel has ceased to trouble her, an armistice has been signed with Poland and peace concluded with Finland. The Russian Government cannot seriously believe that England is threatening her in the East. Thus it is difficult to reconcile her military activity and influx of German officers into Russia, her organisation in Central Asia and the Caucasus, and her reinforcements to Persia, with the military obligations necessitated by her present internal and external situation. Her army therefore provides a political factor necessitating the fullest possible information being obtained, and steps are being taken in this direction. III. —Akmkma. 14. The elimination of Armenia has been prompted by five considerations :— (a) to gain contact with the Nationalists; (6) to deny the country to the Anatolian Government in exactly the same way as Bokhara was denied to Afghanistan ; (c) to prevent by every possible means a junction of the Tartars and Turks. The Bolsheviks fear this possibility extremely (such a combination, which is being worked for by the C.U.P. and desired by the Tartars, would constitute a real danger : in consequence they will never allow Armenia, Georgia or Azerbaijan to become Turkish); (d) to create one more Soviet republic on the principle that has been enumerated above ; (e) to create a corridor into Persia. 15. Throughout the negotiations between the Soviet Government and the Turkish Nationalists this question has been considered as one of the most important. In the telegram of instructions from Tchitcherin to Eliava already referred to, para. (2) contains the following:—“ We will not conclude any agreements guaranteeing to the Turks the oppression of minorities.” In the articles for the Turkish Nationalists’ acceptance communicated through Kaizim Karabekir we read “ (5) The movement “ against the Erivan Republic must cease since this State is friendly to the Soviet “ Republic, and Armenians in Turkey must not be ill-treated.” 16. On 14th August Mustafa Kemal made a speech in the Great National Assembly defending his policy. He stated that Kaizim Karabekir on 4th June submitted certain proposals, including one for measures to be taken against Armenia to stop the massacres of Muhammadans. This particular proposal was accepted, and the Western Army was ordered to prepare to advance. He continues :—“ Ten days after the “ beginning of these preparations (i.e., 16th June) one of our delegates sent to Moscow, “ . . . .as you all know, brought with him a letter from Mr. Tchitcherin. The letter “ stated that the determination of the frontiers of Armenia, Persia, and Turkey “ could be decided by the intervention of the Russian Soviet Government in a “ diplomatic manner. A few days after we w'ere warned by an official letter that an “ accredited Russian Mission was on its way from Kars by train. \\ e then ordered the 44 operations to be suspended after this Mission had met with our delegates at Erzerum. 17. Finally, section 10 of the treaty as we have received it states :—“ The Soviet “ Government will serve as intermediary in the Armenian-Persian-Turco frontier “ question.” The original plan was a combined offensive against Georgia and Armenia ; this fell through owing to the reverses on the Polish front necessitating the withdrawal of the Soviet troops which had been concentrated in Azerbaijan. The Russian Government, therefore, were not prepared to let the Turks invade Armenia till they themselves were on the spot. Hence these orders above to cease operations, which, it should be noted, the lurks obeyed. Meantime Russian efforts to Bolshevise Armenia went on apace; the result is that Armenia is apparently at the present moment a Soviet Republic associated with Moscow, and the lurks cannot now over-run Armenia without definitely breaking with Moscow, and in direct opposition to their treaty engagements, since Russia can now pose as Armenia’s protector. IV.—The Anatolian Nationalists. IS. Mustafa Kemal may be considered a “moderate”; his policy is directed to securing a revision of the treaty of Sevres, including an assertion of the nominal suzerainty of the Sultan over Arabia. The position of the Nationalists was at one 3021 B0 time so lioijeless, and the whole movement so near collapse, that lie sought extraneous assistance. He therefore negotiated with the Italians and the Bolsheviks. The assistance of the former seems Ip have been limited to the supply of arms and perhaps money, but more especially to have been in the nature of a friendly neutrality. Recent indications, however, point to the Italians having modified their attitude when they came to realise how closely associated the Nationalist cause was with Russia. 19. The review given of the C.U.R. and Bolshevik policies has been necessary in order to understand the situation in Anatolia. As stated above, the low ebb of the Nationalist fortunes necessitated negotiations with Russia as the only source of obtaining material assistance, but another factor it is necessary to emphasise is that, both as regards the C.U.P. and the Bolsheviks, the Nationalist movement provided, as Talaat points out, the “positive part ” of their programme. Therefore it was and is in the interests of both to maintain the Nationalist cause. 20. We therefore find both parties strongly represented in Anatolia. It may be considered as a just conclusion from our intelligence that Mustafa Kemal never intended to implicate himself as thoroughly as is the case with Soviet Russia. There is little doubt that, through Talaat in Europe, the Unionist-Bolshevik partv in Anatolia and the astuteness of the Moscow diplomats in defiling with his delegates in Russia he ceased to be a free agent and was deeply committed both against his inclina tions and judgment. He hoped to obtain material assistance ; no doubt he hoped, and still hopes, to be able to break away when the time comes. His position is extremely difficult. There are in Anatolia two main political groups, led respectively by Eyub Sabri, the strong pro-Bolshevik, and Halide Edib, leader of the anti-Bolshevik party. 21. It is not easy to condense Anatolian polities briefly into a comprehensive summary. The following is an attempt in this direction. Acting according to their usual tactics, the Bolsheviks have their secret organisations throughout the country ; these organisations are carrying out strong propaganda assisted by the Turkish { ommunist Party. In addition, through the Mouvahiddin Secret Society, they have been steadily winning over members of the Ureat National Assembly ; such success did they attain in this direction as to seriously alarm the Government and the non-Bolshevik party. The growth of this party impelled Mustafa Kemal to request Eyub Sabri to prevent any further increase, a request that was naturallv refused. They may be considered to have a majority in the Chamber, and it is possible that on this account Mustafa Kemal created a small executive body so as to allow himself freedom of action. Nevertheless, the process of undermining the Government is proceeding apace, and there is now an added danger through the presence of the Bolshevik “Ambassador,” Eliava, assisted by a stall' of (Jd, most of whom are officers. A further disquieting factor is the arrival, according to a Georgian Intelligence report, of two to three hundred Letts and Chinese. There can be no doubt that Russia seeks Mustafa Kemal’s overthrow and the setting up of a Soviet Government. Mustafa Kemal is striving desperately to hold the balance between the pro and anti-Bolshevik parties. He has accepted willingly or unwillingly Bolshevik help and Bolshevik terms. The Bolsheviks do not intend to allow any drawing back.^ The great danger therefore in Anatolia is the possible complete triumph of the Unionist-Bolshevik party. Distasteful as the Armenian situation is to the Turks our indications are that they will have to accept, it, for by a definite resistance to the Bolsheviks on this question Mustafa Kemal runs a grave risk of losing all control and being superseded by a Soviet regime, as he will not only have to face, the Bolsheviks themselves but resist the very strong internal Bolshevik party. 22. Events in Anatolia are moving very rapidly, the Bolsheviks are reinforcing their position systematically and . speedily. I bus any counter measures to support Mustala Kemal or etlace his whole movement should be taken urgently. To be effective they will have to be drastic, unless Mis Majesty’s Government consider it possible to persuade the Soviet Government to renounce their activities in Anatolia and Persia. Even if this were possible the Unionist-Bolshevik party remains and will have to he dealt with. t V.—Conclusion. 2d. 1 he lurkish Unionists have an ambitious plan of gaining control of Central Asia and rhe Caucasus. They may not hope to achieve this without the temporary assistance of Russia, whom th^y hope to hoodwink regarding their real aims. Neithercan they achieve their purpose in the face of England’s attitude towards Turkey and her strong position in the East. The foundation of their plan rests on the Nationalist movement. The Bolsheviks are fully alive to the danger, and will do everything possible to prevent the success of the Unionist plans, but are ready to use them as a means of anti-British activity. The Soviet Government also desires to replace the present Government of Anatolia by a Communistic Government, and are striving hard to accomplish this. Mustafa Kemal, having been committed to a far greater extent than he desired in his relations with Russia, is striving hard not to offend his ally, and at the same time to keep her at a distance. His position, however, is becoming increasingly difficult through the Bolshevik-Unionist organisations in the country itself, and the infiltration of Bolshevik agents. Unless the position of Mustafa Kemal and the non-Bolshevik party be strengthened considerably in the near future, there is a grave danger of complete Bolshevik control eventuating. India Office, 10th December 1920. APPEND! X. Plenipotentiary of the H.S.E.S.R. in Georgia, No. 91047. Tiflis. 5th October 1920. Preliminary Instructions for Work in the Batum Province. General Political Situation in Transcaucasia. Our Government has decided to abandon the idea of forcible intervention in Armenia (1), and has instructed our representative Legrand to organise a powerful communist party in that country through the medium of which we hope to attain our desired objects. According to information which we have received, Georgia, in order to save herself from the wave of Turkish advance, is prepared to treat with Mustafa Kemal, whereby she will undertake to refrain from rendering any assistance to Armenia. This fact points to her weakness and unpreparedness for war. All questions affecting our eastern policy among the Mussulman (Adjar) population of the Batum province will be dealt with by Comrade Stark, who will give you necessary instructions. I would ask you to collect and forward to me all material regarding the violation by the Georgians of Article 5 of the agreement. It is impossible to count on the penetration of our Soviet troops into Georgian territory, as this is not feasible at the present moment. We must attain our rights here, not by force of arms, but by developing a powerful propaganda, and by strengthening our organisations. It is, therefore, essential that you take the following action:— (1) Organise a provincial communist party. (2) Organise a secret communist battalion of combatants, selecting your men from among the brigade of Georgian railway conductors, the workmen in the Batum railway shops and the Ardahan garage, as also among the Georgian troops. (3) Form a combatant communist group among the workmen employed in the forest concessions controlled by the All-Russia Central Union {Centro Soyuz). (4) Afford as strong material and moral support as possible to all organisations working against the Georgian Government. (5) Organise the distribution of literature of a simple and comprehensible nature throughout the entire province. (6) Organise a permanent, reliable and regular method of communication between Novorossisk, the Crimea, Trebrzond and Constantinople. (7) Select competent individuals to supervise the mobilisation of sailors lor the reformation of our Novorossisk fleet (the Batum Sailors' Union should co-operate in this. (8j Organise communist propaganda in the region of Rizeh and 1 rebizond as a set-off to pro-British and pro-French sympathies among the population. (9) Organise military and political intelligence withiji the Batum province and as far as Trebizond inclusive, such intelligence to be in addition to any organisation-worked from the centre. (This includes the observance of the movements of foreign warships, and the collection of all information concerning armed forces within the area in question.) (10) Organise and maintain communist centres in various localities in the province. (I t) Collect data and report on the least violation by the Georgians of any of the terms of the peace treaty. To enable you to carry out the above instructions you are being assigned the sum of 35,000,000 Roubles in old russian money. (Sd.)
