These papers predominantly comprise reports from the British Consul at Tabriz (Clarence Edward Stanhope Palmer).During October and November 1932, calls to boycott the elections to the new Persian majlis by an organisation describing itself as the Nationalist Organisation of Azerbaijan (ff 368-378). Papers include a translation of a manifesto issued by the organisation (ff 369-370).In 1935, reports responding to rumours of civil unrest in Tabriz (ff 357-363).In 1938, deteriorating relations between Iran and Russia, partly in response to Russia’s unease at an increase in trade between Germany and Iran (ff 337-352).The political crisis brought about by the declaration of the Azerbaijan People’s Government in November 1945, and the ensuing Iran-Azerbaijan Crisis, which arose from Soviet Russia’s refusal to relinquish Iranian territory originally occupied by Russia during the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran in 1941 (ff 4-336). Papers include a declaration (in French) made by the National Congress of Iranian Azerbaijan (ff 259-260), and the translated texts of programmes and laws announced by the Azerbaijan National Government (ff 207-209, f 92, ff 77-79, ff 61-63).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Azerbaijan People's Government</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Democratic Party of Azerbaijan</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Tabriz</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Iranian Azerbaijan</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Iran-Azerbaijan Crisis (1946)</topic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iran, Pahlavi dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Russia</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Tabriz</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military operations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Bilateral relations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0003ca#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0003ca#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0003ca#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0003ca#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0003ca#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
