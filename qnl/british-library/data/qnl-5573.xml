The Chamber has had under review the representation on the a ersian Gulf Lights Advisory Committee and desires to suggest to the Foreign Office that the Indian Government he asked to consent to the addition of a representative to be nominated by the British Tanker Company Limited. As no doubt the Foreign Office are aware, the Persian Gulf trade has considerably developed since 1925 and the Anglo- i ersian Oil Company Limited, which has been for some time paying, through its subsidiary company, the British Tanker Company limited, 70 of the total dues and is now responsible for in all approximately 82^1 of the dues, feels that the British Tanker Company is entitled to at least one nominee which will place them in a position on the Advisory Committee more comparable vith their substantial interest involved in the revenue. The other British Companies represented on the Advisory Committee has been consulted and concur in the suggestion now put forward which it is hoped will commend itself to the Foreign Office and the Indian Government.
